Faster!\u201d\u201cYou are a prince? You ruled over tens of millions of citizens and thirty thousand armored horsemen? In the Netherworld Kingdom, you human princes are nothing!\u201dSmack!Smack!A tall, powerful-looking demonic soldier, his face mean and vicious, snarled angrily as he lashed out with his whip repeatedly. The whip flashed like lightning, striking on the bodies of the souls of the dead. He struck the ghost who had been arrogantly proclaiming that he was a prince several dozen times, only stopping when the ghost\u2019s soul had almost dissipated.\u201cI should\u2019ve died. So that means\u2026this is the Netherworld Kingdom?\u201d Ji Ning appeared out of nowhere. He couldn\u2019t help but stare with curiosity at the unfamiliar surroundings. When he heard the arrogant boastings of the prince, Ji Ning couldn\u2019t help but feel suspicious; \u201cTen million citizens? Thirty thousand armored horsemen? In the modern Earth, where would one find thirty thousand armored horsemen?\u201d\u201cFaster!\u201d The massive, glowing minotaur demon soldier stared at Ji Ning and brayed.Ji Ning followed the rest of the regiment.Countless men in white clothes formed into a line, like a long, sinuous dragon, as they slowly moved forwards. At the end of each line, more people in white would suddenly appear. Some of these white-dressed people would shake their heads and sigh. Some would weep. Some would brag and curse. Some would stare in astonishment.\u201cMy father is the Devil King of the Great Snowy Mountain. How dare you strike me! I\u2019ll eat you! Grrr!\u201d\u201cStop hitting me!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dThe ghosts who had just reached the Netherworld Kingdom didn\u2019t know they were dead. Many of them were roaring in anger as they were beaten, but quickly, they were beaten to the point of understanding\u2026that they were dead. No matter how glorious they had been in the past, in death, they now had nothing.\u2026.Time passed quickly. Ji Ning walked for a very long time in that endless line of ghosts. He didn\u2019t dare to say anything. If he spoke, he might be whipped by that minotaur. He had walked in a daze for a long time already. Fortunately, ghosts didn\u2019t get hungry or thirsty.One day, after a long, long period of dazed walking.\u201cJi Ning!\u201d A thunderous sound seemed to echo in the world. The countless ghosts all raised their heads to stare at the sky. Ji Ning stared at the sky as well. From the horizon, an enormous black cloud began to roll over, and atop that cloud was an enormous minotaur god who was glowing with black light.This enormous minotaur god was over a hundred thousand meters tall. He was like a massive mountain. The black cloud he was on quickly flew over from the horizon.\u201cJi Ning.\u201d Atop the massive black cloud, the minotaur god stared downwards, his eyes shooting out twin lofty golden rays of light, covering the entire area below and illuminating the body of Ji Ning, who stood there like an idiot.The glowing light from the eyes of the minotaur god wrapped around Ji Ning\u2019s body, and Ji Ning disappeared from within the ranks of the ghosts. Those ordinary minotaur soldiers were all silent, none daring to make a sound. All of the ghosts were in a state of shock. Only a long time later did they recover.\u2026..Within the boundless black clouds, the titanic minotaur god stood.He stretched out his hand, and on top of his palm was a tiny little dot. Ji Ning.Ji Ning was totally shocked.God.An enormous minotaur god was standing in front of him, and he was standing on its palm?\u201cJi Ning.\u201d The minotaur god peered down at the tiny little speck in his hands.\u201cI have come at the orders of the Lord of Cui Palace to come receive you.\u201d The minotaur god spoke to the tiny speck in his hands, and then with a wave of his hands, Ji Ning was placed into an empty void area. The minotaur god then rose his black cloud and quickly disappeared into the horizon.\u2026..In the Fengdu City of the Ghost World.Within a quiet study, there was a bookshelf and a table next to it. A blue robed man in his middle years was flipping through a book.Ji Ning stood there in front of him.\u201cWhy does the Lord of Cui Palace wish to see me?\u201d Ji Ning was wondering. He had no idea who this Lord of Cui Palace was and had never met him. He was just an ordinary person. How could he possibly know any Immortals? If he had a powerful background, then he wouldn\u2019t have been tormented by his illness his entire life. So why had that Lord of Cui Palace sent the minotaur god to bring him here?\u201cHe summoned me, but then he doesn\u2019t speak to me.\u201d Ji Ning sneaked a glance around the room.The study was very simple. The only decoration was a single painting.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Ji Ning looked at it carefully. This was the painting of a girl. Her feathered clothes were filled with natural grace, and the smile on her lips was even more enigmatic than those on the Buddhas in the temples on Earth. In the blink of an eye, Ji Ning became enamored with studying that painting. The woman in this painting, in terms of appearance or hair or clothing, was extremely alluring.\u201cOh?\u201d The blue robed man raised his head and glanced at him, glancing at the painting in surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that he would have such powers of perception.\u201d\u201cWake up!\u201d The blue robed man shouted quietly.The world of vacant pondering which Ji Ning had been in just now was totally shattered, and he was totally woken up. Only now did he remember that he was in the Lord of Cui Palace\u2019s place.The Lord of Cui Palace had closed his book and was looking at him. Ji Ning\u2019s expression instantly changed. This was because from his current position, he could see the words within the hands of the Lord of Cui Palace: \u201cBook of Life and Death.\u201dThe Lord of Cui Palace was reading the Book of Life and Death?\u201cI\u2019ve just been reading about your life.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace smiled towards Ji Ning.Ji Ning was startled.His life?His previous life appeared in his mind like a dream. His father was a leading researcher in a bioscience program. His salary was extremely high. His mother was an ordinary teacher. His life should\u2019ve been great since he had been born into such a family, but unfortunately, he suffered from constant diseases. The doctors all said that it would be a miracle if he would live to fifteen or sixteen.Therefore, he couldn\u2019t go to school, nor could he play around with his peers. Every day, just by walking for half an hour, he would feel exhausted. His weak body, constantly tormented by illness, caused his childhood to be very lonely. He had heard long ago in the hospital that others were discussing how he should die in his teens. This sort of terrifying feeling of knowing your death was coming soon had tormented his childhood, causing him to be even more of a loner.Fortunately!Fortunately, he had his books and the internet.The books and the internet gave him a \u2018mental world\u2019 which allowed him to avoid the fate of having a twisted personality. Through books and the internet, he ravenously acquired knowledge about the world, and his heart slowly grew calm, making him more rational in the way he viewed the world.He knew that in the world, there were children who were even worse off than him. After all, he still had his parents and he had enough to eat.He was searching for his value in life. He couldn\u2019t just stay here and wait to die, right? While he was alive, he had to do something. And thus, he had asked for a hundred thousand Chinese dollars from his parents and began to do business online. He originally had wanted to make his life more interesting, but unexpectedly, he really had incredible achievements.After many years, he had earned an enormous fortune.But despite that, his illness constantly reminded him that he wouldn\u2019t be able to live for much longer. As his parents didn\u2019t need him to support them, he felt that leaving the money there would be a waste. Thus, before dying, he handed out all of his money, giving it to the poor and sick children throughout the country.\u201cI can\u2019t change my own destiny, but I can change the destiny of those countless poor, sick children!\u201dThis was the deepest desire in Ji Ning\u2019s heart!After handing out all of his money, he hadn\u2019t expected that one day, while he was taking a walk in the streets outside the hospital with his parents, he had simply died.\u201cYour life was bitter since you were born.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace said softly. \u201cBut bitterness didn\u2019t twist you. Instead, it spurred you on to astonishing accomplishments. You not only made a huge sum of money, but more importantly\u2026you gave it all away!\u201d\u201cEighteen years of age. Dead.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace sighed. \u201cFor one to be willing to sacrifice one\u2019s self to rescue a stranger is quite rare.\u201dJi Ning said, \u201cPalace Lord, you praise me too much. If I had lived a long life, I might not have been willing to do this. According to the doctors, at most I would\u2019ve lived another three months. For me to trade those three months of life to allow a little girl to gain dozens of years in her life was worth it!\u201dThe Lord of Cui Palace laughed, and then casually flipped open the Book of Life and Death. His gentle voice carried an infinite majesty. \u201cJi Ning, in your life, you saved over ten thousand people. Your merits are great. For your reincarnation, you shall be reborn into\u2026the Heaven Realm!\u201d\u201cThe Heaven Realm.\u201d Ji Ning murmured quietly.The Lord of Cui Palace sighed, \u201cOnly those who accumulate great karmic merit can enter the Heaven Realm. On Earth, it is very hard for one to reach this level. Knowingly or unknowingly, by giving up your vast fortune and helping all of those children, you accumulated enormous karmic merit. Otherwise, you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to enter the Heaven Realm.\u201d\u201cPalace Lord, what do you mean?\u201d Ji Ning was confused.\u201cPeople are born pure and without malice.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace said. \u201cChildren are totally pure, but later on, the vagaries of life cause them to change\u2026if you were to have helped adults, you might\u2019ve helped some kind people, but it is hard to say who is kind and who is evil. If you had helped evil people, it would\u2019ve reduced your karmic merit.\u201dJi Ning now realized what he meant.\u201cThe Book of Life and Death had preordained that you would only live to be sixteen. However, because of your accumulated merits, you were allowed to live until age eighteen.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace sighed.\u201cWhat?\u201d Ji Ning was shocked. \u201cAre you saying that the fates contained within the Book of Life and Death can be changed?\u201d\u201cOf course they can be changed. Why can\u2019t they be changed?\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace laughed. \u201cFor me, adding a hundred years to a person\u2019s life is nothing. Even if Heaven wanted you to die, it would still give you a chance, much less the Book of Life and Death. A person\u2019s destiny is preordained, true, but it can be changed later on.\u201dJi Ning now understood.It was true.The ancients said, \u201cIf Heaven commits a sinful act, one can go against it; but if you do a sinful act, then you will not be allowed to live.\u201d If Heaven wanted you to die, it would still give you a chance at life. The Book of Life and Death was nothing more than pre-ordained destiny, which one could try and change afterwards.\u201cI believe there are many people who accumulated great merit. Palace Lord, why did you summon me alone?\u201d Ji Ning asked, puzzled.The Lord of Cui Palace laughed. \u201cBecause\u2026you and I are from the same hometown.\u201d\u201cFrom the same hometown?\u201d Ji Ning was stunned. \u201cAre you also from\u2026\u201d\u201cRight. According to the words you \u2018modern\u2019 people use, I\u2019m also from Earth!\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace laughed. \u201cBut that was back in the era of the Sui and Tang dynasties.\u201dThe Sui and Tang dynasties?Ji Ning was extremely excited. \u201cI heard those ghosts say that they were \u2018princes\u2019 or \u2018devil kings\u2019. None of them are from Earth.\u201d\u201cIt is normal from them to not be from Earth. In the infinite universe of space-time, there are three realms; the Heaven, the Netherworld, and the Mortal Realms.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace explained. \u201cHeaven refers to the Heaven Realm! The Netherworld refers to the underworld, the Netherworld Kingdom! Mortal, refers to the Mortal Realm. In the Mortal Realm, there are over three thousand major worlds and trillions of minor worlds\u2026the three thousand major worlds are all extremely vast, and have Immortals and Devils hidden within them. As for the trillions of minor worlds, all of them are much smaller and have much lower populations. Our hometown, the Earth, is one of those minor worlds. Up until now, there are still only a couple billion people.\u201d\u201cEvery moment, in those three thousand major worlds and trillions of minor worlds, there are countless deaths, and the spirits all come here to the Netherworld Kingdom! Tell me, how many ghosts does the Netherworld Kingdom have?\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace looked at Ji Ning.Ji Ning was shocked.My God!Three Realms?The Mortal Realm was enormous. The Earth was just one of a trillion minor worlds. As a human of Earth, in the past, he always thought the Earth was the center of the universe! But now, he realized\u2026that the Earth was just one of a trillion minor worlds, and couldn\u2019t even be considered one of the three thousand major worlds. In an instant, he had a sense of loss and disorientation.\u201cThree thousand major worlds, a trillion minor worlds. Of course there\u2019s many people who have high merit. But it is rare that there is someone from my hometown who has accumulated such high merit, and what\u2019s more, your pre-ordained fate was a short life. For you to be able to reach such a level despite that is very rare! I just happened to have some free time, so I wanted to meet you, my fellow Earth man.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace. \u201cYou are going to reincarnate soon. Let me tell you about the Six States of Reincarnation.\u201d\u201cThe Six States of Reincarnation refers to Devas, Asuras, Humans, Animals, Preta Ghosts, and Hell Beings.\u201dThe Lord of Cui Palace explained, \u201cThose who are born as Devas and Asuras are all considered to be in the \u2018Heaven Realm\u2019.\u201d\u201cHumans and Animals are part of the Mortal Realm.\u201d\u201cPreta Ghosts and Hell-beings are in the Netherworld Kingdom Realm.\u201d\u201cThe Heaven Realm is the place where you are about to be reborn in.\u201d These words immediately caused Ji Ning to grow alert. The Lord of Cui Palace sighed, \u201cThis is the best place to be. When you are reborn into the Heaven Realm, nature itself will give birth to you as a Deva! Only someone who is born naturally by the heavens can be described as a \u2018immaculate lifeform\u2019.\u201d\u201cBorn by nature? Not by a mother?\u201d Ji Ning was absolutely shocked.\u201cOf course.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace laughed. \u201cOtherwise, how could you be considered an \u2018immaculate lifeform\u2019? Strictly speaking, the heavens and the earth will be your parents!\u201d\u201cAfter being born into the Heaven Realm, you will train at an astonishing pace. You will easily be able to enter the Celestial Court and become a soldier or a general of Heaven.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace sighed emotionally.Ji Ning rubbed his eyes.A soldier or general of Heaven?He was going to become a soldier or general of Heaven?\u201cDevas have another advantage; once you turn sixteen, you will regain all your memories of your previous lives.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace sighed. \u201cThe only reason I met you this time was because you had high merit and are a fellow countryman. I didn\u2019t expect that when you came here\u2026you would\u2019ve been spellbound by the painting of Nuwa, the creator of humans. Your insight and perception is indeed very high. For the sake of helping you to become a standout soldier of Heaven, I\u2019ll give you some help.\u201dJi Ning was absolutely delighted. Help him? Help him out?\u201cStare at the painting of Nuwa.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace pointed at the painting on the wall.Ji Ning looked at it.So that woman in the painting was the goddess Nuwa?\u201cThe person on this painting is the most holy and most compassionate primordial goddess, Miss Nuwa.\u201d The face of the Lord of Cui Palace turned solemn. \u201cEver since Pangu died after creating the universe, only she, Miss Nuwa, has reached Pangu\u2019s level. Miss Nuwa is capable of destroying the universe, but also capable of healing it. She can even create new life. Of the countless races, the human race is the most spiritual one, and it was created by Miss Nuwa. She has understood 84,000 truths, and without question, she is the most invincible, powerful presence in the Three Realms.\u201d\u201cThe highest in the Three Realms?\u201d Ji Ning was stunned.Nuwa created humans, and Nuwa repaired the world. He had long ago heard of these myths.\u201cThis painting is used for the visualization technique, but there\u2019s no way you can see the secrets hidden within it.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace laughed. \u201cAlthough you are about to become a Deva and a heavenly warrior and will also be trained in this, let me first teach you a bit of the visualization technique and fulfill the karmic bonds that brought us together.\u201d\u201cThank you, Lord of Cui Palace.\u201d Ji Ning bowed so low, he almost reached the ground.\u201cNo need to thank me. It is nothing more than a visualization technique. It isn\u2019t some sort of secret training method, or a magical technique of the Immortals or the Devils.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace pointed a single finger at Ji Ning\u2019s forehead.Boom!Ji Ning felt his brain suddenly explode, and an enormous figure of Nuwa appeared in his mind.\u201cWake up.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace looked at Ji Ning. \u201cRemember. Often visualizing her will definitely allow you to train your soul. But of course, you are about to be reborn and you\u2019ll need to drink Grandma Meng\u2019s Elixir. You will temporarily lose your memory. When you turn sixteen, you will remember this visualization technique. But that\u2019s enough. It will definitely be enough to let you become an outstanding figure in the army of Heaven! With this visualization technique, you will have a chance to train to become an Immortal. If you wish to become a Celestial Immortal, you will suffer many trials\u2026I hope that you will succeed, and in the future, we will meet again in the Celestial Court.\u201dJi Ning\u2019s heart was filled with excitement.The army of Heaven?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBecoming an Immortal?He really looked forward to it all.\u201cGo.\u201d The Lord of Cui Palace waved his hand.Hua.Ji Ning disappeared.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

How did he suddenly appear in mid-air?\u201cDare I ask, who exactly is the Lord of Cui Palace?\u201d Ji Ning was puzzled. \u201cI heard that before reincarnating, I should meet with the Judges of the Dead, who would investigate my past and present lives, then send me to be reincarnated?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you already see a Judge?\u201d The violet clothed woman laughed. \u201cAs the Custodian of the Book of Life and Death, naturally the Lord of Cui Palace is the First Judge of the Dead! Since he personally came to judge you, of course the other common judges don\u2019t need to come judge you.\u201dIn the Netherworld Kingdom, the highest authority was that of the Yamas of the Ten Halls, the ten Kings of Hell. Immediately beneath them was the First Judge of the Dead, the Lord of Cui Palace, \u2018Cui Jue\u2019.His great fame had long since spread throughout the three Realms.The Mortal Realm was vast beyond compare. It had three thousand major worlds and trillions of minor worlds. Every single living creature, before they were born, would have their good deeds and evil deeds assessed by the Judges. What an enormous task this was! Thus, the entire Netherworld Kingdom had trillions of Judges who were responsible for judging the dead souls of the trillions of worlds. But Cui Jue was the leader of all of the Judges, and was titled the First Judge. He was the true Custodian of the Book of Life and Death. His power was so great that he was virtually on the same level as the Ten Kings of Hell.\u201cLook. The Road to the Yellow Springs.\u201d The woman pointed to a vast road ahead of them, which had countless ghosts slowly trudging along in a line. \u201cIf you follow the road, you will quickly arrive at the Bridge of Despair. After you pass the Bridge of Despair and drink Grandma Meng\u2019s Elixer of Forgetfulness, you can go be reborn.\u201d\u201cGo.\u201dThe woman waved her hand.Ji Ning\u2019s body was suddenly surrounded by golden light, which sent him flying straight down into the front of the line, allowing him to \u2018cut in line\u2019.The minotaur soldiers next to the line, upon seeing the violet clothed woman high up in the air, didn\u2019t dare to say a word. They even arranged for one of the minotaur soldiers to escort Ji Ning and were extremely courteous to him.\u2026\u2026..The Yellow Springs Road was full of mist. Countless souls were making their way through it, and Ji Ning was one of them.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Ji Ning stared in front.In front of him, the mist was very thick. Any souls that entered there disappeared and never came back.\u201cGo on. In front is the Bridge of Despair.\u201d The nearby minotaur soldier said amiably.Ji Ning nodded. Not hesitating, he stepped forward, entering that dense fog.He suddenly felt as though spacetime had changed.\u201cWhere is this?\u201d Ji Ning stared at his surroundings in confusion. In front of him was a small, winding road. Ghostly forms could be hazily made out. In front of him, only a few dozen ghosts could be seen. In front of this little road was a river with rapid, turbid water.\u201cThat should be the legendary Bridge of Despair.\u201d Ji Ning headed forward.\u201cHow strange.\u201d\u201cClearly, countless people entered here. But how come after I stepped in, so few people can be seen?\u201d Ji Ning was quite baffled.How could he know that here at the Bridge of Despair, time flowed differently than in the outside world.As the saying goes, \u2018For each day that passes in Heaven, a year passes in the mortal world.\u2019Time passed here at the Bridge of Despair at an even more extravagantly fast pace. A single day in the Netherworld Kingdom would equal countless years here in the Bridge of Despair.\u201cAh! Ah!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dAs Ji Ning walked onto the Bridge of Despair, he saw that the other side of the bridge had a pool of blood. The pool of blood had all sorts of poisonous bugs, poisonous snakes, and vicious dogs that wildly bit at people. Most of the ghosts simply walked past the pool of blood, but some fell straight into it. Clearly, these people were burdened by great sins, and found it impossible to avoid the terrifying pool of blood.\u201cIf you knew what would happen today, would you have acted so previously?\u201d Ji Ning shook his head, then stared at the other side. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201dNext to the River of Forgetfulness was countless beautiful flowers.Not too far from the bridge was a precious gem which flashed the light, creating many different images. This was the legendary \u2018Gem of Three Lives\u2019, referring to the \u2018previous life\u2019, the \u2018current life\u2019, and the \u2018next life\u2019.Not too far away from the Gem of Three Lives was a stone dais. This was the \u2018Dais of Viewing Home\u2019. After the souls passed the dais, they arrived at Grandma Meng.Grandma Meng was a seemingly very ordinary old grandmother. She held a bowl of water in her hands, handing it over to each soul to allow them to drink from it. After drinking it, the souls would become sluggish and seem to be in a trance, as they automatically began to walk towards one of the six tunnels of rebirth behind Grandma Meng.\u201cDeva. Asura. Mortal. Animal. Preta Ghost. Hell.\u201d Ji Ning stared at the infathomably deep tunnels behind Grandma Meng.\u201cI won\u2019t drink, I won\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t want to forget, I don\u2019t want to forget\u2026\u201dMany ghosts struggled.But no matter how much they struggled, they were forced by an invisible, inexorable force to move forwards. When they arrived next to Grandma Meng, they were forced by the invisible force to drink Grandma Meng\u2019s Elixir. No matter how they screamed or howled, they still drank it\u2026and after drinking it, no matter how strong their emotions were or how deep their memories were, they forgot it all. By then, they were no longer themselves.\u201cI\u2019m entering the Heaven Realm. Although I\u2019ll recover my memories at age sixteen, but by then, will my memories of the sixteen years of life in the Heaven Realm will take precedence, or would the memories of my previous life take precedence? By then, would I still be me?\u201d Ji Ning felt a hint of grief.He understood.In this life, he only lived eighteen years. In the Heaven Realm, during those sixteen years, he would be far more powerful than in this life. Most likely, his current memories would be secondary.\u201cBut what can I do?\u201d Ji Ning was already bound, and he moved forward under that force\u2019s control.The ghosts ahead of him all drank from Grandma Meng\u2019s Elixir. In six more ghosts, it would be his turn.\u201cGrandma Meng\u2019s Elixir.\u201d Ji Ning stared at Grandma Meng.Grandma Meng suddenly raised her head.This was the first time Ji Ning had seen Grandma Meng raise her head. Grandma Meng stared far away into the skies, and then her ancient voice said in fury, \u201cImpudent!\u201dBoom!The skies seemed to shatter and the earth seemed to break. The surrounding skies suddenly began to fracture, and the surrounding mist began to break down and dissipate, exposing the countless ghosts in line in the outside world. The fractures in space transformed a large number of ghosts into dust. Like bubbles that were popping, countless souls began to disappear, all of them screaming in misery.\u201cBoom!\u201d \u201cBoom!\u201d \u201cBoom!\u201d \u201cBoom!\u201d \u201cBoom!\u201d In mid-air, countless black dragons could be seen flying about, each one of them seeing as enormous as a massive, sinuous mountain chain. Ji Ning seemed to be able to see even those heart-freezing dragon scales. The countless dragons were wandering about, having fun in the skies, and then each of the black dragons vomited forth multiple streams of black lightning. Instantly, trillions of bolts of black lightning slashed down, every single one of them causing the heavens and the earth to break apart.\u201cThe Life and Death Formation of the Calamity Dragons? How is it that you dare to attack the Six Paths of Reincarnation? This is a grave sin!\u201d Grandma Meng shouted with unbridled fury. Transforming into a beam of light, she flew towards the tens of millions of black dragons in the sky. Instantly, those countless black dragons surrounded Grandma Meng.Rumble\u2026The world was fracturing, and the muddied waters of the River of Forgetfulness began to form waves. Any ghosts that touched those waters were instantly dissipated. The Bridge of Despair shattered, and the ghosts atop the Bridge of Despair fell directly into the River of Forgetfulness. As for the Six Paths of Reincarnation, those immeasurably deep tunnels were beginning to shake as well, and light was gleaming from within their depths.\u201cUh oh.\u201d Ji Ning stared in terror at the calamity he was witnessing. At the same time, he could sense that invisible binding force dissipate.\u201cI\u2019ll risk it!\u201d When the binding force dissipated, Ji Ning was both surprised and pleased. Half hopping, half-flying, he jumped directly towards the \u2018Mortal Realm\u2019 tunnel. The Six Paths of Reincarnation each were located in different places. Because most people entered the Mortal Realm, the Mortal Realm\u2019s tunnel was directly behind Grandma Meng and was the closest one to Ji Ning. Naturally, Ji Ning chose to jump down into that tunnel.The surrounding ghosts were all jumping down into the various reincarnation tunnels.One ghost dared to try and rush towards the most distant, Heaven Realm tunnel.Boom\u2026A bolt of black lightning struck down. That ghost, who hadn\u2019t managed to dodge in time, instantly dissipated, along with several other nearby ghosts.\u2026\u2026..What exactly had happened in the Netherworld Kingdom? Those countless black dragons that had been circling about in the air, those trillions of black lightning bolts that had wildly struck downwards\u2026that terrifying scene had shocked Ji Ning. But he understood that as an ordinary ghost, there was no point in worrying too much about it. In addition, right now, he didn\u2019t have any time to worry about it, because his head hurt!Ji Ning sensed that his head was in tremendous pain, as though something was frantically grabbing onto and tearing at it.His neck hurt, and his body was suffering tremendous pressure.Hua!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuddenly, he felt at ease, and then, he felt a bone-piercing cold. At the same time, a breath of fresh air entered his mouth. This was the first \u2018breath\u2019 which Ji Ning had taken since dying.\u201cWow!\u201d After taking a deep breath, Ji Ning immediately let out a cry.The cry of an infant.\u201cA son! It\u2019s a son!\u201d Although his hearing was a bit distorted, he could still understand what was just said.\u201cOh. I\u2019ve been reborn.\u201d Ji Ning instantly understood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ji Ning instantly understood that this person was a \u2018giant\u2019, only because right now, he was an infant being held by this man.\u201cYou can leave now.\u201d The man said.\u201cYes.\u201d The three maids said respectfully.The man holding Ji Ning in his arms should be his father. Although he had just gotten a son, he still seemed like a piece of glacial ice, very hard to get close to. He wore a set of beautiful fur clothes, while those three maids also were dressed in animal fur. Clearly, they were of much poorer quality.The room was quite empty. The wall, the dresser, the seats, the bed, all of them were carved from marble. The carvings were quite exquisite and gave off an ancient, beautiful nobility. Atop the bed was a six or seven meter long enormous beast fur, with the fur hanging down to the floor. At a glance, one could tell that this fur was no doubt extremely expensive. Atop that bed, there was a red-faced young woman.\u201cEven the chairs and the dressers were carved from marble. The room itself should be made from marble as well. Father and those three women are all dressed in animal fur. It seems this world doesn\u2019t have a high level of civilization.\u201d Ji Ning secretly said to himself.\u201cSon.\u201d Despite holding his infant son in his arms, that man still seemed very cold, without a hint of a smile on his face. Only, his eyes betrayed his excitement.Ji Ning suddenly had the feeling that a mysterious cold energy entered his body. It was very comfortable, and then, quickly, it passed away.\u201cYichuan, how is my son doing?\u201d The woman on the bed hurriedly asked.\u201cAs expected, his body\u2019s quality is ordinary.\u201d Ji Yichuan said softly.The woman on the bed had faint tears in her eyes. \u201cLet me hold him.\u201dThe man carried the child over in his arms.\u201cBe good.\u201d The young woman looked at the infant, her eyes filled with love. \u201cYichuan, our child was injured in the womb. Although he ate those natural treasures, it only repaired some of the damage. We haven\u2019t done right by our child.\u201dHe had been injured in the womb?Natural treasures?It seemed as though his parents in this world weren\u2019t ordinary people.\u2026..Despite having just given birth to a child, his mother had easily been able to get off the bed. She was also dressed in a white fur, and was in her husband\u2019s arms as they walked out of the room.\u201cYou can clean up in here.\u201d His father, Ji Yichuan, said to those three maids.\u201cYes.\u201d The three maids said respectfully.Outside the door, on the hallway, there was a big, snow white dog. Its fur was as long as cotton, and it appeared very docile. When its gaze fell upon Ji Ning, it was filled with excitement and love.In the wide courtyard outside the room was a giant, pitch-black coiling python which was lining the outside of the courtyard. It had circled around in multiple loops, and its head was raise to a height of dozens of meters. Its body was covered with dark, heart-stoppingly cold scales. The giant python slowly lowered its head and drew near.\u201cGood God!\u201d Ji Ning was frightened. That snow white dog was fine. He had seen plenty of dogs in the past. That snow white one was just a bit bigger.But this coiled, enormous monstrosity? Was it even a snake?Coiled around in endless circles, and its raised head alone was dozens of meters high. The entire thing had to be two or three hundred meters long. Such an awe-inspiring beast was actually in front of his own family\u2019s house? This\u2026this was simply\u2026\u201cSon.\u201d Ji Yichuan didn\u2019t pay any attention to his son\u2019s feelings, or perhaps in this world, people were used to these things already and didn\u2019t feel they were strange. Ji Yichuan pointed at the snow white massive dog in front of them. \u201cThis is your Uncle White. He is your father\u2019s lifelong friend, and he\u2019s saved your life. You must treat him as you would treat me.\u201dThe snow white hound looked lovingly at Ji Ning. Ji Ning could almost physically feel the deep love which the snow white hound bore him.However\u2026He had to call a dog, \u2018Uncle White\u2019?\u201cYichuan, the child was just born and doesn\u2019t understand anything yet. Is there a point to telling him these things?\u201d The young woman said while holding the child.\u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t understand, this is his first time meeting with Little White.\u201d Ji Yichuan raised his head to stare at the massive python. \u201cBrother Black!\u201dHiss\u2026This enormous black python which definitely would\u2019ve made countless nations go insane suddenly transformed into a black mist, and then reformed into a black-haired middle-aged man. The black haired man smiled towards the infant. \u201cYichuan, I still remember how when you first showed your budding talent, I agreed to follow you. I didn\u2019t expect that in the blink of an eye, you would have a son. Child, don\u2019t be afraid. I am your Uncle Black.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go outside.\u201d Ji Yichuan said. \u201cGrandpa and the others are outside waiting as well. Brother Black, it\u2019s best if you return to your regular form. I know it is very uncomfortable for you to be in human form.\u201dHiss\u2026The black haired man nodded, and then he once more transformed into a black fog which quickly returned to that massive, coiled black python. The massive black python immediately slithered towards the outside. Its enormous body moved very quickly. Slither, slither, slither. It easily passed the walls and disappeared.Ji Ning felt that he was still in a state of shock.Although this might be normal to people of this world, to Ji Ning, a man from the Earth, this was simply too stunning. A 200-300 meter long black python had suddenly transformed into a black haired man, and had said that he was his \u2018Uncle Black\u2019?Monster!\u201cCan it be that the snow white hound is also a monster?\u201d Ji Ning had the feeling that this world was more amazing than he could imagine.Husband and wife held the child together as they walked out into the corridor, while by their side was the snow white dog. Once they reached the end of the corridor, they walked onto a stone paved road which led to a garden. Within the garden, there was a thick layer of snow. Many black armored guards were standing there unmoving, while in the center, there were several dozen people standing. These several dozen people all possessed all sorts of miraculous bizarre beasts, venomous pests, and flying beasts.Ji Ning instantly understood. It wasn\u2019t that his father was special. It was that the people of this world all raised strange beasts. Taming them was a common habit.\u201cIt seems in the future, I\u2019ll have to get used to making friends with monsters.\u201d Ji Ning quickly adjusted to this new reality and began to observe those several dozen people. These several dozen people all seemed ferocious as tigers or panthers. Virtually all of them were dressed in beautifully cut animal furs. Only the three women were dressed in silk or cloth garments.This secretly startled Ji Ning.It seemed that not everyone in this world wore animal furs. Silk and cloth already existed here. Judging from the location where the three women were standing, they were of fairly common rank within those dozens of people. Clearly, the quality of those silk or cloth clothes weren\u2019t any higher than the lavish, exquisitely cut animal furs.The silver-haired old man standing in front walked over. \u201cCome, Yichuan. Let me hold the child.\u201d\u201cGrandfather.\u201d Ji Yichuan nodded, then took the child over from his wife\u2019s arms and delivered him to the old man.\u201cThis child truly is beautiful.\u201d The silver-haired old man\u2019s face was filled with joy. He said in praise, \u201cYichuan, now that you have a son, I will no longer worry as much. I\u2019ve been the lord of our prefecture for already eighty years. According to the rules of our clan, a person can only be a Prefecture Lord for no more than a century. I only have twenty years left as Prefecture Lord. Previously, I wanted you to succeed me in the position of the Prefecture Lord of the West Prefecture of our Ji clan, but you insisted on focusing on walking the path of the Immortals. Now that you have a son, as I see it, in the future, he can be the next Prefecture Lord.\u201dThe next Prefecture Lord?Ji Ning was surprised. It seemed as though his status was quite high, and this clan should be a special one as well. Those extremely obedient female servants and those unmoving, black armored guards all were a testament to his clan\u2019s power.\u201cBig brother!\u201d A sudden angry shout.Who would dare to be so disrespectful to the Prefecture Lord?Ji Ning looked in the direction of the noise. He saw a red-haired old man who emanated heat walk over. The man had a eye-catching red earring in his right ear. Wait. It wasn\u2019t a red earring. It was a little red snake the size of a finger. He was actually wearing a snake in his ear?The old man with the snake in his ear walked forward, growling, \u201cThe matter of the succession to the position of Prefecture Lord can\u2019t be so casual as this. In addition, who knows what sort of ability that little fellow would have?\u201d\u201cYichuan\u2019s son\u2019s ability would naturally\u2026\u201d The silver-haired old man was extremely confident. At the same time, a sudden surge of heat entered Ji Ning\u2019s body, then quickly dissipated.\u201cYichuan!\u201d The silver-haired old man stared in astonishment towards the grandson he was so proud of.How could he not be shocked.This was the son of Ji Yichuan, famed as the \u2018Raindrop Sword\u2019. The majestic Raindrop Sword, all by himself, had exterminated countless monsters hidden in deep lakes and high mountains. The countless tribes under the control of their West Prefecture of the Ji clan all knew of the Raindrop Sword. In fact, more people knew of him than knew who the Prefecture Lord was.As long as his child ate some precious treasures while in the womb, the infant would naturally have the finest possible growth conditions.\u201cBig brother.\u201d The snake elder laughed. \u201cIt seems Yichuan\u2019s son is quite average. How can the West Prefecture of our Ji clan, which commands so many tribes, have a weak little fellow take over the important position of Prefecture Lord? How can the people of the Ji clan possibly submit to him? How can the countless tribes be willing to submit to him?\u201d\u201cPrefecture Lord. This little fellow, it seems, isn\u2019t suited to the position of being the next Prefecture Lord.\u201d\u201cThe important position of Prefecture Lord cannot be so casually given away.\u201dThose few dozen people present were all high level members of the West Prefecture of the Ji clan. Many began to speak.\u201cShut your mouth.\u201d Ji Yichuan frowned. As he swept the area with his icy gaze, instantly, many of the clan members fell silent.But the snake elder said angrily, \u201cWhat a huge temper. This is the West Prefecture of the Ji clan! What, we can\u2019t even talk here? Your son as the Prefecture Lord\u2026if your son was qualified, then given the great merits you yourself have rendered to the West Prefecture of the Ji clan, we definitely wouldn\u2019t say anything. But your son is so very average. You still wish him to be Prefecture Lord? The countless tribes under the banner of the West Prefecture of the Ji clan must fight together in territorial battles, and also must struggle against the Diremonsters in the deep mountains and the lakes. How can a weak Prefecture Lord make the clan members willingly submit? How can he make those tribes submit? If the West Prefecture isn\u2019t awe-inspiring, then how will we struggle for power against the surrounding organizations, and how will we go to the mountains and the lakes to slay the Diremonsters?\u201d\u201cI will naturally be the one to kill the Diremonsters of the lakes and the mountains!\u201d Ji Yichuan\u2019s voice was cold as ice.\u201cYou sure are tough. You live up to your reputation, Ji Yichuan. So you\u2019ll go kill all of the Diremonsters hiding in all of the mountains and lakes by yourself? Then I, Ji Lee, will say this to you. If you can kill a hundred Diremonsters, then I will no longer dispute with you over who will become the next Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan\u2019s West Prefecture. I\u2019ll let your son take it over.\u201d The snake elder sneered.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJi Yichuan stared at him.Every single Diremonster was extremely sly and powerful. How could they be so easily killed? Even killing ten of them would be a miracle, much less a hundred.\u201cEnough. The child was just born and can\u2019t take all this stress.\u201d The silver-haired elder stared at them, then ordered, \u201cTonight, we\u2019ll hold a celebratory banquet at the Snowfall Hall. For now, everyone can leave.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe serpent elder was the first to respond, and he did so loudly. He immediately led more than half the people away with him, with the rest quickly returning to their own places as well, leaving this garden.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Late at night, the sky was covered with stars. Ji Yichuan and his wife took their infant back home.\u201cWhoah.\u201d Ji Ning blearily opened his little eyes and saw the night sky filled with stars.Ah.He had fallen asleep. He had actually fallen asleep mid-way.There had been fascinating performances, with musicians, drummers, and barefoot, fur-clad female dancers filling the hall. This was very different from Earth\u2019s performances, but it was still very pleasing to the eye. However, he was still just an infant. Halfway through, he was simply too sleepy and thus he immediately fell asleep.\u201cYichuan.\u201d Yuchi Snow said with a hint of anger while walking in the snow. \u201cAt the banquet, why did you say that you would let our son go seize the golden sword? Don\u2019t you know how hard that is?\u201d\u201cI was able to accomplish it.\u201d Yichuan frowned.\u201cYou are the most powerful member of the West Prefecture of the Ji clan. You were able to do it as a youth, but in the thousand year history of the Ji clan\u2019s West Prefecture, how many have been like you?\u201d Snow was angry. Normally, she was very gentle, but anything which involved her son made her anxious. \u201cAnd today, when the Prefecture Lord raised the question of having our son becoming the next Prefecture Lord, five overseers had agreed. Only a single additional overseer was needed. All you had to do was convince a single overseer\u2026with six overseers in agreement, then our son would have easily been able to become the next Prefecture Lord. Why go seize the golden sword?\u201dSeizing the golden sword was simply too hard.Yichuan shook his head and sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cWhat don\u2019t I understand?\u201d Snow said angrily.\u201cYou haven\u2019t been at the West Prefecture for a long time yet. You don\u2019t understand the intricacies hidden within.\u201d Yichuan explained. \u201cThe ten overseers of the West Prefecture are divided into the Prefecture Lord\u2019s side and Ji Lee\u2019s side. There are three centrists. If we were to draw another overseer into our orbit, the price would have been too high.\u201d\u201cSo what if the price is high?\u201d Snow said unhappily.\u201cYes, if we paid an enormous price, we could let our son become the Prefecture Lord.\u201d Yichuan frowned. \u201cBut if our son is incapable, even if he is allowed to take the position of Prefecture Lord, he\u2019ll just suffer countless miseries, unspeakable miseries. That will be a form of torment!\u201dYuchi Snow was stunned.\u201cI don\u2019t want my son to be miserable.\u201d Yichuan continued slowly. \u201cThus, I brought up seizing the golden sword.\u201d\u201cIf my son possesses astonishing insight and talent and is able to strengthen rapidly, then naturally, he\u2019ll be able to seize the golden sword. No one would say a single word of dissent if he were to take over the Prefecture Lord position after doing so.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cBut if my son is unable to seize the golden sword, then he can just live a life of leisure. I, Yichuan, will protect him his entire life and let him live without any cares.\u201dSnow seemed to have understood.Becoming Prefecture Lord didn\u2019t necessarily mean a life of ease. If an expert became the Prefecture Lord, then naturally, his rule would be stable. But if someone incapable took the position\u2026even if he was forcibly installed, he would just be miserable.\u201cYichuan, I was wrong to blame you.\u201d Snow said softly.Yichuan just lowered his head and rubbed his son\u2019s face. \u201cHis eyes are wide open. This kid woke up long ago.\u201d\u201cRight, Yichuan. What name should we give him?\u201d Snow suddenly asked. \u201cI asked you when I was pregnant, but you weren\u2019t happy with any of the names. Now that he\u2019s been born, we have to come up with a suitable name.\u201d\u201cLet his name come into the world alongside him.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cHow could I not be careful about it? I hadn\u2019t made up my mind in the past, but just now, I suddenly thought of a name\u2026let\u2019s call our son \u2018Ning\u2019, meaning \u2018calm\u2019. No matter whether his life is normal or exciting, no matter if he is weak or becomes an expert, let him maintain a calm, peaceful heart.\u201d\u201cNing?\u201d Snow murmured. \u201cJi Ning. Ji Ning\u2026\u201dJi Ning?The infant in his mother\u2019s arms stared with wide eyes. Was this the name which the First Judge, the Lord of Cui Palace, had preordained that he would have in the Book of Life and Death? Or was it a true coincidence?In this life, he would be named Ji Ning once again?\u2026..The most powerful member of the West Prefecture of the Ji clan was the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan.The second was the \u2018Tiger Demon\u2019, Ji Lee.Within Lee\u2019s Prefecture.\u201cCongratulations and felicitations, father.\u201d A middle-aged man with several dozen braids in his hair said. \u201cThat Yichuan was so arrogant and blind that he actually said he would have his son go seize the golden sword\u2026the West Prefecture has been in the hands of our Ji clan for generations. Not a single person has taken the Prefecture Lord position through seizing the golden sword.\u201dThe old man with flaming red hair and that scarlet snake in his ears slapped his hands together. \u201cWhen I was young, I should\u2019ve become the Prefecture Lord! But at that time, I was simply too much of a show-off and ended up losing to my big brother, Ji Young. That old bastard Young ended up taking the Prefecture Lord position and has been in that position for eighty years!\u201d\u201cEighty full years!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting all this time. Every day has been a crucible.\u201d Lee ground his teeth. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that his line of descent would produce someone like Yichuan! He truly is a glorious, outstanding talent. Fortunately, fortunately, Yichuan is only interested in training to become an Immortal and doesn\u2019t care about becoming the Prefecture Lord. Yichuan was simply too arrogant today. He actually chose such a path for his son.\u201d\u201cIt seems it is the will of Heaven that we take the Prefecture Lord\u2019s position.\u201d The middle-aged man said excitedly.\u201cDon\u2019t be hasty.\u201dLee shouted. \u201cWhen I was young, that loss I suffered taught me\u2026that a person can\u2019t be too happy before one has actually succeeded! What we need to do is prepare!\u201d\u201cFather, do you mean to say\u2026\u201d The man asked.Lee was frowning in concentration.Time slowly passed. The middle aged man sat off to one side, not daring to disturb him. He knew his father was thinking.\u201cRight!\u201d Ji Lee suddenly said in a soft voice. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ll do!\u201dThe middle-aged man looked at his father. \u201cFather, what is your plan?\u201d\u201cIn order to seize the golden sword, one must defeat all of the youths of the tribes and the descendants of the Ji clan.\u201d Lee said in a low voice. \u201cAlthough there are few clan members, they are able to acquire a large amount of treasures and secret manuals, while although there are many youths in the tribes, very few will get any treasures. But despite that, in the quadrennial Golden Sword Ceremony, out of every five or six ceremonies, only once will a Ji clan member win.\u201dThe middle-aged man nodded. \u201cThere are simply too many tribe members. There will always be an extremely talented person who emerges. However, no matter how great their talent, we won\u2019t teach them the truly powerful arts of the Ji clan. We\u2019ll only teach them some of the lesser arts. Although those youths of the tribes might be powerful during the Golden Sword Ceremony, after seventy or eighty years, the most powerful exponents are those of the Ji clan.\u201d\u201cWhat I mean to do is\u2026\u201d Ji Lee said in a whisper. \u201cSelect a few outstanding youths from the tribes and give them a large amount of treasures and resources and train them. Without my training, those tribal youth talents are already so powerful. Once they receive my training, they will definitely skyrocket in power and become even mightier! I refuse to believe that the son of Yichuan will be able to defeat all of them and seize the golden sword.\u201d\u201cRight. Right.\u201d The middle-aged man hurriedly nodded.Usually, the treatment of the tribal youths and of the Ji clan members were totally different.The Ji clan youths were of one family. Naturally, the Ji clan would treat them much better. But in dealing with the youths of the tribes, they would have to both draw them close and also control them well! But this time\u2026he would use all of his talent to cultivate the most promising youths!\u201cFather, if you do this, then Ji Yichuan\u2019s son will definitely lose.\u201d The middle-aged man said confidently.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Lee laughed. \u201cRemember. Plant some of our people by Yichuan\u2019s side. I want to know how rapidly Yichuan\u2019s son grows in power. Only knowing one\u2019s own power and one\u2019s opponent\u2019s power will one gain victory!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The middle-aged man\u2019s eyes were shining.\u2026\u2026Yuchi Snow gently placed her son down atop the warm bed.\u201cNing, be a good boy and sleep tight.\u201d Snow gently kissed her son\u2019s face, then lay down on the bed as well.A pained look was on Ning\u2019s face.He wiped the corner of his lips. He had just drank breast milk. What a weird sensation.The events of the past twenty four hours were simply too shocking, too unbelievable. First, he had passed the Bridge of Despair, but then, just before he was to drink Grandma Meng\u2019s Elixir, a great upheaval had occurred in the Netherworld Kingdom. It was as though the world was about to shatter. He had been lucky enough to react in time and jump into the Mortal Realm\u2019s tunnel, and had been reincarnated into this world.A snow white hound who was his \u2018Uncle White\u2019?A several hundred-meter giant black python that could raise its head up to the level of a house, and also transform into a black-haired middle aged man, who was his \u2018Uncle Black\u2019?And now, he was supposed to seize some golden sword and become some Prefecture Lord?Hey guys, did you think about asking me how I feel about all this?\u201cBah. Infants have no human rights.\u201d Ji Ning licked the milk from the corner of his lips while pondering. Still, a hint of excitement was in his eyes. \u201cTime to train!\u201dThe very first day he had arrived here, he had sensed that his clan was a powerful one. How could a clan capable of commanding countless tribes be ordinary? But clearly, the position of Prefecture Lord had aroused interest from all sides. That old fellow with the red snake in his ear wasn\u2019t weak either. He dared to argue against the Prefecture Lord and squabble with Ning\u2019s father.Screw it!Ning was still just an infant. There was no reason for him to worry about all these things. Right now, the most important thing was to train. Train in the visualization technique \u2013 Nuwa Painting.The Nuwa Painting, according to the Lord of Cui Palace, was something which would allow him to be an outstanding figure, even if he had been born into the Heaven Realm and had joined the Celestial Host, much less here in the Mortal Realm. In the Mortal Realm, it definitely would be the most top tier of visualization techniques. Such a precious technique that had been deeply engrained into his mind was the most powerful source of support he would have in this world.In his past life, he had been tormented by illness for eighteen years. He had been exhausted just by strolling for half an hour. He had simply had enough of that powerless sensation! The sensation of being powerless in the face of death! He had enough! Enough! Enough!!! He would take his destiny into his own hands, and that destiny was to follow the path that the Lord of Cui Palace had spoken to him of: Training to become an Immortal!Training to become an Immortal was the only choice he would make!Ning closed his eyes and began.A hint of natural energy slowly began to enter Ji Ning\u2019s body. It was being attracted into his consciousness and began to strengthen his soul. But because only a tiny amount of natural energy was being absorbed, neither Yichuan nor Snow noticed at all.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe visualization technique was capable of absorbing natural energy?This was simply incredible.The reason was, this wasn\u2019t an Immortal training technique, nor was it a Immortal magic technique. If it was an Immortal training technique, it would wildly devour the surrounding natural energy. But the visualization technique, despite absorbing just a bit of natural energy\u2026was already quite incredible.Whoosh. Whoosh. Tiny threads of elemental energy constantly entered Ning\u2019s infant body.Natural energy repeatedly entered his body and cleansed his body. Infants were born pure. Only after experiencing life would they be sullied by the dirt and grime of the world. But right now, Ning\u2019s body had very few impurities within it. With the natural energy repeatedly cleansing him, he quickly became incomparably pure, as pure as a newborn!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5: Ji ClanThe rays of the spring sun shone down with lazy warmth.A red-lipped, pale-faced child was standing with arms stretched out, while a fur-clad young lady was quickly and carefully helping him get dressed in his fur clothes. Another young lady was waiting next to him with a basin of water and a bowl with rough salt.\u201cIn my past life, I was always sick and dressed myself. I didn\u2019t expect that in this life, I would not only be perfectly healthy, I would also have servants to take care of me.\u201d Ji Ning had been served by people since he was born. When he sometimes automatically began to dress himself out of habit, the two terrified maids, \u2018Spring Grass\u2019 and \u2018Autumn Leaf\u2019, immediately fell to their knees, trembling in absolute terror.\u201cGive it to me.\u201dNow dressed, Ning took over the black bowl of rock salt and headed outside the room. He walked to a nearby fountain, then began to use those white, tough pieces of rock salt to \u2018brush his teeth\u2019.\u201cWhat a disaster this era is. There are no toothbrushes. I have to use my hands to brush my teeth! And there\u2019s no tooth paste, only rock salt!\u201d Ning quickly finished brushing his teeth. Actually, he wasn\u2019t sure why, but he was extremely clean ever since he was born, and he didn\u2019t have any mouth odor. There was no need for him to brush his teeth, but his mother forced him to do it anyways.\u201cGargle.\u201d Ji Ning raised his head, then spat out a mouthful of water, then handed the basin to the nearby maid, Spring Grass.The maid, Autumn Leaf, then offered him a blue stone bowl for washing his face. Ji Ning quickly washed his face, then wiped the water off with a cloth.\u201cAutumn Leaf.\u201d Ning stared at her. \u201cIn your tribe, do you also use salt to brush your teeth?\u201dAlthough he was already four years old and had read many books of the clan and had learned many things, he actually didn\u2019t know much about the situation inside the tribes.\u201cHow could that be possible?\u201d Autumn Leaf had a slightly freckled face. \u201cEven the table salt which we use in the tribes aren\u2019t as white and as clean as this salt. How can we use it to brush our teeth? The men and women of the tribe just use water to rinse their teeth. Many will go their entire lives without brushing their teeth. And also, this sort of basin is extremely valuable and is usually used to boil soup. How can we use it to brush our teeth?\u201dBoil soup?Ning rubbed his eyes. This basin could be used to boil soup?\u201cLet\u2019s go eat.\u201d Ning turned his head and walked away, with the two maids behind him.\u2026\u201cFather. Mother.\u201d Ning arrived in the main hall and immediately stood there and bowed.\u201cMm.\u201dHis father, Ji Yichuan, was seated in front, while his mother was seated to the left. His own position was towards the right. In front of him was a black, marble table, with three big bowls on it. One contained steaming, aromatic meat, another had thick yet soft pastries, and the third was a bowl of hot water. This was his breakfast.If this breakfast for a four year old was placed on Earth, it would probably be enough for three adults to eat. But in this world\u2026every child could eat a tremendous amount of food. Ning was no different.\u201cMmm, it tastes so good.\u201d Ning grabbed a chunk of meat from the first bowl and ate it. Despite having the taste buds of an Earth human, he still felt the food was delicious. Ning knew\u2026because his body was physically average, ever since he was young, he had been fed special food. The meat he ate wasn\u2019t meat from ordinary beasts; it was meat from magical, monstrous beasts. In the tribes, monster meat was extremely rare and precious, but Ning was able to eat it every single day.It had special effects. It would make Ning stronger!\u201cI\u2019m done eating!\u201d Ning ate very fast; it could be described as simply \u2018scarfing the food down\u2019. And then, with a gurgle, he drank all the hot water as well.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Ning ran out, with Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf chasing after him.Snow watched her son run away and laughed, \u201cAlthough Ning was rather weak when he was born, that\u2019s only because he was injured while in the womb. His potential is still very high. Look, every day, he\u2019s able to eat so much monster meat. His body will definitely grow stronger.\u201dYichuan nodded as well. Monstrous beasts weren\u2019t like ordinary animals. Monstrous beasts absorbed the natural elemental energy of the world, and their flesh contained that energy as well. Normally, children wouldn\u2019t be hungry for two days if they ate it for breakfast, but Ning ate it for three meals a day. Clearly, he was able to absorb it all.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..The two maids were carrying thick books behind Ning. Behind them were eighteen massive guards who wore scarlet red armor. The red armored guards had mysterious runes scrawled onto their armor, which faintly seemed to hum with a strange energy, causing all of them to emanate a powerful aura.The Crimson Guards were the most powerful soldiers of the Ji clan. The West Prefecture only had a hundred Crimson Guards who listened only to the command of Ji Yichuan.Yichuan arranged eighteen Crimson Guards to protect Ning at all times. If Ning was to ever be outside the house, the eighteen Crimson Guards would stay right by his side.\u201cTo the training yard.\u201d Ning\u2019s journey was very smooth.Nobody dared to block his path!The city of the West Prefecture was a great and massive city. Within the city was hundreds of thousands of citizens, and there were three major areas. They were the inner city, the military camp, and the training grounds.The inner city was where the Ji clan members of West Prefecture lived. It was the central administrative area!The military camp was the place where the soldiers controlled by the Ji clan of West Prefecture were stationed.The training grounds was where the youths of the Ji clan and of the many tribes controlled by the Ji clan would come to train.The inner city and the training grounds were connected by a straight line. Ning led his servants and guards directly towards the central training grounds. The vast training plaza currently had thousands on thousands of youths there training.\u201cLook, it is Ji Ning!\u201d\u201cThe only child of the Raindrop Sword? Ji Ning?\u201d\u201cAre his female slaves holding books? When those roving merchants came to my clan in the past to sell books, I heard that that the cost of each book was a thousand lambskins.\u201dMany of the youths in the training grounds were talking amongst themselves. There were many who had matured quickly, and thus knew that this child was the son of the number one expert of the Ji clan, Ji Yichuan, the \u2018Raindrop Sword\u2019. Many of the youths actually were quite fond of this child, because although Ji Ning came from a powerful and noble clan, he didn\u2019t bully them at all. But no matter how fond of him they were, they wouldn\u2019t dare tease him.\u201cOof.\u201d Ji Ning sat down on the chair, his eyes filled with excitement.In the previous life, he was often by himself, and so now, in his heart, he really enjoyed crowded, rowdy areas.\u201cGive me the books.\u201d Ning took a thick and heavy book from the hands of Spring Grass. This tome really was thick, roughly twenty centimeters thick, and it was bound by the soft skin of some monstrous beast. In this era where slavery still existed, books were quite precious. Ning, however, could casually flip through the books in their private library and even take a few out.After being born, Ning had primarily done two things\u2026The first thing was to train in according to the visualization technique \u2013 Nuwa\u2019s Painting. His soul had become strong and sturdy, to the point where he now had photographic memory. Just half a month ago, he had even been able to reach the level of dividing his mind into two.What did dividing his mind in two meant? For example, he could simultaneously use his left hand to write an essay while using his right hand to paint a painting. It was as though his consciousness had been divided into two parts which didn\u2019t interfere with each other.Actually, this wasn\u2019t particularly miraculous. According to the books, those who trained in the path to become an Immortal could all use their minds to accomplish multiple things at once. They would be able to use several treasures to attack at the same time. The true brilliance of the Nuwa Painting was that Ji Ning was able to divide his mind in two after visualizing it for just two years.The second thing he had done was to read!Half a year after his birth, when Ning was able to form some words, he had hugged a book and pointed at what looked lke some words in it and said, \u201cThis, this, this\u2026\u201d Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf, being personal maids, all knew how to read. Naturally, they didn\u2019t dare to not reply. With their help and with guesswork, he soon learned how to recognize the words.And then, his reading began!As the saying goes, \u2018spending time sharpening the knife makes the cutting go faster\u2019. Although he was fully devoted to the idea of training to become an Immortal, Ning understood that sometimes, haste made for ineffectiveness. Reading was a way of \u2018sharpening the knife\u2019 to become an Immortal. First of all, he needed to understand what this world was like. He would also learn more about what it meant to become an Immortal, and what types of Immortals there were, and so on and so forth.Only after learning about this would he know what the best choice for himself would be!After reading many books, Ning came to know that the Ji clan of West Prefecture was a small power located within the vast expanse of land ruled over by the Grand Xia Dynasty!The territory ruled over by the Ji clan of West Prefecture stretched for three thousand kilometers from north to south and five thousand kilometers from east to west. There were countless tribes who lived on this land, and all of them were ruled by the Ji clan!What\u2019s more, this was nothing more than the Ji clan of West Prefecture.The Ji clan was an ancient clan. It was divided into the Central Prefecture, the East Prefecture, the West Prefecture, the North Prefecture, and the South Prefecture. All five Prefectures combined made up the entirety of the Ji clan!However\u2026the Grand Xia Dynasty was simply too large. Its territory was nearly limitless, and it was an ancient dynasty which was born during the \u2018Fiendgod Era\u2019. Over a trillion years had passed since the terrifying Fiendgod Era. For a dynasty to be able to last a trillion years was something which Ning found to be inconceivable.The Ji clan was nothing more than a small power within the borders of the Grand Xia Dynasty, but to the countless local surrounding tribes, the Ji clan was definitely their absolute rulers!\u201cThis truly is a world where Immortals and Devils abound.\u201d Ji Ning sighed mentally. \u201cOrdinary mortal realms find it hard for an Empire to sustain for even a thousand years, but in this ancient world, an ancient, large empire is something which is beyond my imagination.\u201cRight. It has been over two year since I was born, and I know very little about training to become an Immortal. It is time I begin.\u201dHe had spent a year in the womb, and when he was born, it was winter, while a new year had come soon after that. Thus, he had lived in this world for over two years now.\u2026.That very night.Both sides of the main hall were filled with lit lamps, and the entire hall was extremely bright. His father continued to sit where he usually sat, with his mother on the left and Ning on the right. The table was still covered with meat as well as plates of vegetables and grains.\u201cNom nom nom.\u201d Ning blew through the meat on the table like a twister, and then raised his head up. \u201cFather, mother!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHrm, what is it?\u201d Yichuan looked at his son, and Snow did as well.Although their son\u2019s intelligence caused them boundless joy, it didn\u2019t startle them too much, because in this vast world, there were plenty of people who were devilishly clever.\u201cI want to train!\u201d Ning said seriously. \u201cI wish to train to become an Immortal!\u201dSeeing the serious look on her son\u2019s face, Snow began to laugh. \u201cTrain to become an Immortal? Yichuan, our son wishes to train to become an Immortal!\u201d\u201cImmortal?\u201d Yichuan looked at his son coolly. \u201cDo you know what training to become an Immortal means?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please instruct me, father.\u201d Ning said respectfully.Actually, after having read so many books, Ning had learned about it long ago. But as a four year old child, there was no need for him to appear so devilishly intelligent.\u201cThen I will tell you and let you understand.\u201d Yichuan\u2019s voice was like ice. \u201cFirst, let\u2019s talk about the seven major stages.\u201d\u201cThe first stage, Houtian. Lifespan of a hundred years.\u201d\u201cThe second stage, Xiantian. Lifespan of two hundred years\u201d\u201cThe third stage, Zifu, the \u2018Violet Palace\u2019. At this level, one will be addressed as Zifu Disciple. Lifespan of five hundred years.\u201d\u201cThe fourth stage, Wanxiang, \u2018Manifestations\u2019. At this level, one will be addressed as Wanxiang Adept. Lifespan of eight hundred years.\u201d\u201cThe fifth stage, Primal. Can be referred to as Primal Daoist.\u201d\u201cThe sixth stage, Void. Can be referred to as \u2018Land Immortal\u2019, or \u2018Earth Immortal\u2019. In the later levels of the Void stage, a heavenly tribulation will test them. If they fail, then they will die and their spirits will be extinguished. If a Primal\u2019s body is destroyed but manages to escape with his soul, then he will become a \u2018Loose Immortal\u2019, whose power is roughly on par with the \u2018Earth Immortals\u2019.\u201d\u201cThe seventh stage, Celestial Immortal. Only at this stage can one be considered to have ascended beyond the Three Realms and no longer be formed by the Five Elements!\u201dYichuan stared at Ning after speaking. He wanted to see the look of awe and surprise on his son\u2019s face\u2026but Ning was just listening intently.\u201cYou say you wish to train to become an Immortal. Thus, I wish you to know how hard it is to become an Immortal.\u201d Ji Yichuan\u2019s voice sank down. \u201cThe first obstacle to becoming an Immortal\u2026is to pass from the Houtian stage to the Xiantian stage!\u201d\u201cWhat does Xiantian mean? Only a lifeform which was naturally born by the heavens and the earth can be described as a Xiantian lifeform. In the distant Fiendgod Era, there were Fiendgods that were born naturally by the heavens and by the earth and which possessed tremendous power from their birth. In addition, there are those who are reborn into the Heavenly Realms as \u2018Devas\u2019 or as \u2018Asuras\u2019. These Devas and Asuras are all birthed by nature itself, and thus by their very nature, they are a Xiantian lifeform. This makes it very fast for them to train, because only Xiantian life forms can train to become an Immortal!\u201d\u201cIt is impossible for mortals to train to become an Immortal\u2026but the Heavens always leave a thread of hope. Thus, in the past, benevolent elders created a set of training techniques which can allow the bodies of ordinary people become akin to the bodies of Xiantian lifeforms. Only then did it become possible for ordinary people to train to become an Immortal.\u201d\u201cBut for an ordinary person to become a Xiantian lifeform is against the natural laws of the universe, making it very hard! The success rate is lower than one in ten thousand! Tell me, is it hard or not?\u201dNing continued to listen.Xiantian lifeform? If it wasn\u2019t for that huge disturbance in the Netherworld Kingdom, he probably would have already reincarnated and become a Deva in the Heavenly Realms. Naturally, that would mean he would already be a Xiantian lifeform. However, currently he was a mortal\u2026and indeed, for a mortal to reach the Xiantian stage was an extremely difficult path.\u201d\u201cThe second great obstacle to becoming an Immortal\u2026from the Xiantian stage to the Zifu stage!\u201d\u201cOnly by establishing a Zifu, also known as a \u2018Violet Palace\u2019, can one continue to train as an Immortal. Establishing a \u2018Violet Palace\u2019 is like laying the \u2018foundation\u2019 when building a house, or seeding the fields in order to harvest the crops. The Violet Palace is the crop field and is the core for an Immortal. It is the basic underpinning of the path of Immortals! Only after one has truly established a \u2018Violet Palace\u2019 in one\u2019s body can one embark on the route to becoming an Immortal. And only then can one be titled a Zifu Disciple! For a Xiantian expert to establish a \u2018Violet Palace\u2019\u2026perhaps one in a thousand will succeed. Tell me, is it hard or not?\u201dNing nodded.Right. It was hard.At the same time, he continued to listen carefully. The books of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture only described these two obstacles. They didn\u2019t describe the obstacles after that.\u201cIn order to establish a Zifu and become an Immortal, one must possess a world-shaking power.\u201d\u201cBut becoming an Immortal, by its very nature, is against the laws of the universe. Thus, starting from the day you step onto the path of the Immortals, in other words from the day on which you establish your Zifu, you will be tested every three hundred years. Every nine hundred years, you will undergo a major tribulation. Thus, as the saying goes, \u2018Three centuries a calamity, nine centuries a tribulation. Calamities are easy to avoid, but tribulations are hard to escape!\u2019 A test every three centuries, and a tribulation every nine\u2026after embarking on the path to becoming an Immortal, this will continue forever, unless you become a Celestial Immortal. Otherwise, the \u2018Three Calamities, Nine Tribulations\u2019 will become your eternal fate.\u201dThree Calamities, Nine Tribulations?Three centuries a calamity, nine centuries a tribulation. Calamities are easy to avoid, but tribulations are hard to escape?Ning truly was shocked by this. Unless one became a Celestial Immortal, everyone who trained in the path of Immortals would have to deal with a test every three centuries.\u2026.Ji Yichuan and Yuchi Snow looked at their son. Right now, there was a look of shock and disbelief on their son\u2019s face. Seeing the stunned look, Yichuan nodded slightly. He had finally managed to shock the little rascal.\u201cOur son is still very young. Why did you tell him all those things?\u201d Snow said unhappily.\u201cMother.\u201d Ji Ning lifted his head up, a smile on his lips. \u201cIt is fine.\u201dJi Yichuan looked at him in surprise.\u201cFather.\u201d Ji Ning laughed. \u201cFrom mortal to Xiantian, from Xiantian to Zifu. These two obstacles alone\u2026are extremely difficult. The \u2018Three Calamities, Nine Tribulations\u2019 are very distant and very far off. I don\u2019t need to worry about them at all for now.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Yichuan nodded. \u201cYour attitude isn\u2019t bad. You are correct. Right now, there truly is no need for you to think about becoming a Zifu Disciple. That\u2019s too far away for you. At the vast area around Mount Swallow, the strongest people in the countless tribes and in the Ji clan are only at the Zifu Disciple level. The path of the Immortals is a hard one. Even our massive Grand Xia Dynasty would perhaps produce only a single Celestial Immortal in the space of a million years.\u201dNing nodded gently.In the Netherworld Kingdom, the Ruler of Cui Palace had told him that the \u2018Nuwa Painting\u2019 would only give him a chance at becoming a Celestial Immortal, and that there were still many obstacles to overcome. And that was assuming that he was going to be a Deva and also a soldier in the armies of Heaven. From this, one could imagine how hard it was for one to become a Celestial Immortal. To escape the confines of the Three Realms and no longer be subject to the Five Elements wasn\u2019t so easily done.\u201cDo you still desire to train to become an Immortal?\u201d Yichuan looked at Ning.\u201cYes.\u201d Ning nodded.Yichuan nodded slightly. If the boy had been terrified just by hearing about this, Yichuan would have been disappointed. What he didn\u2019t know was\u2026how could Ning possibly be scared as easily as this? There was nothing without risk. Even walking on the street, one might be killed by a rock falling down from the skies. Even when eating, one might choke to death. Training to become an Immortal naturally would be extremely risky. It would be bizarre if it wasn\u2019t.\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d Yichuan frowned. \u201cYou are too young, and training techniques are very complicated. If I was to transmit a high-class Immortal training technique to you and you trained in a wrong direction, it would harm your body. But ordinary Immortal techniques aren\u2019t worth learning\u2026\u201d\u201cFather.\u201d Ning said. \u201cI wish to learn the Fiendgod Body Refining Technique.\u201d\u201cOh? You know about Body Refining?\u201d Yichuan was extremely surprised, and Snow began to laugh. \u201cIt seems our son has read quite a few books. He even knows that there are two main paths of Immortal training.\u201dThere were two primary paths of training to become an Immortal.The first was in Ki Refining, refining ki energy! 99% of those who trained to become an Immortal chose this path. This path allowed one to use many mysterious Immortal treasures, create complicated golems, control large amounts of deadly magical beasts, develop powerful magical formations, and also use some extremely vile techniques\u2026in a word, this was an extremely glorious and profound path.The other path was in Body Refining.Supposedly, the three Realms had each given birth to many Fiendgods. All of them were born from nature itself and were powerful from their birth! As for the creator of the universe, Pangu, he himself was the mightiest of them, the Fiendgod of Primordial Chaos. He also possessed the most powerful body\u2026and thus, a number of elders managed to develop this \u2018Fiendgod Body Refining\u2019 technique, which would allow the practitioners to possess bodies on par with Fiendgods. Indestructible bodies, possession of boundless strength, having three heads and six arms, regenerating from a single drop of blood, immortal and undying\u2026these all belonged to the Fiendgod Body Refining method.Reputedly, at the same level of development, a Fiendgod Body Refiner would be able to totally suppress his opponents!\u201cBody Refining is a hundred times more difficult than Ki Refining.\u201d Yichuan said seriously. \u201cThe Fiendgod Body Refining method allows one to possess the power of a Fiendgod. How powerful is that? Hard, very hard\u2026\u201d\u201cFather, first I\u2019ll train the body. Afterwards, I will develop Ki.\u201d Ning said. \u201cThese two training methods can be simultaneously progressed in. By then, I\u2019ll take whatever path I am most skilled in, which will be my primary path. In addition, weren\u2019t you afraid that I am too young and that training in ki will damage my veins? The Fiendgod Body Refining technique doesn\u2019t have this risk.\u201dYichuan and Snow glanced at each other.It seemed their son had thought things through. Indeed, the Fiendgod Body Refining technique primarily exercised the entire body\u2019s muscles and internal organs. As for the blood vessels? It didn\u2019t have much to do with that at all. It must be known that Innate Fiendgods came in all types, and their veins were totally different from the veins of human beings. The benevolence of those ancestors had developed the Fiendgod Body Refining technique from the bodies of the Fiendgods. Naturally, they ignored the veins.\u201cAlright!\u201d Yichuan nodded. \u201cThe Fiendgod Body Refining method is incomparably precious. Our Ji clan in total has nineteen books on Fiendgod Body Refining scattered through our five prefectures. I will let you choose the one you wish to train in!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ning was extremely excited.\u201cBrother Black.\u201d Yichuan shouted towards the outside.A black-haired middle-aged man appeared from outside. His eyes faintly glowed with red light, and his eyes were rather long. It was the human form of that massive black python.\u201cUncle Black.\u201d Ning hurriedly called out. Two years ago, when he was born, he had learned that this black haired man was a Diremonster who had already trained to reach the \u2018Xiantian lifeform\u2019 stage. Generally speaking, animals who had reached a certain level of intelligence would be called \u2018monsters\u2019. After beginning to absorb the energy of nature, since they didn\u2019t possess special training techniques, it was even harder for them to train than it was for humans. Only when they broke through to become Xiantian lifeforms would they possess the ability to transform themselves!The black-haired man smiled and nodded. \u201cYichuan, what do you need?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to trouble you to make a journey to the library.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cBring the abridged versions of those nineteen training methods of the Fiendgod Body Refining techniques here. Ning wants to use them.\u201d\u201cNing wants to use them?\u201d The black-haired man looked at Ning with a laugh. \u201cSomeone who trains with the Fiendgod Body Refining would have the power of a Fiendgod. It seems Ning is quite ambitious.\u201dHua!The black-haired man disappeared into thin air.Ning took a deep breath as he waited. Uncle Black spoke the truth. He was indeed ambitious. The first reason was because he knew that due to his youth, his father probably wouldn\u2019t allow him to train in Ki Refining. Self-study? Ning didn\u2019t have the confidence. The second was that the Fiendgod Body Refining method had some very powerful benefits. To kill a Fiendgod practitioner was more than a thousand times more difficult than to kill a ki practitioner! Fiendgod Body Refining experts, at the same level, could totally dominate a Ki Refining expert!They had both strong self-preservation abilities and strong power. Just based on these two alone, Ning took a liking to the Fiendgod Body Refining method.Hu!A gentle wind appeared out of nowhere, and the black-haired man appeared in the middle of a hall, a smile on his face. \u201cNineteen copies of abridged versions of Fiendgod Body Refining techniques.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNing.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cThe abridged versions only have the first parts of each Immortal training technique, combined with a summary and description of the technique. Take a close look and see which one you want.\u201dThe black-haired man placed the nineteen tomes in front of Ning.Every single tome was very thin. After all, these were abridged versions. Even if they were stolen, they wouldn\u2019t pose a loss for the Ji clan. They couldn\u2019t possibly place precious Immortal training copies in their entirety in the library, after all. However, even these abridged versions of the Fiendgod Body Refining weren\u2019t freely available for others to see. This was why Yichuan had sent the black-haired man to make the trip.\u201cNineteen tomes.\u201dNing began to read in earnest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Fortunately, Ning had learned these words after Ning had been born into this world.Ning took a deep breath. This was a critical choice! One which would determine his destiny!He picked up a book and began to read.[Calamity Fiend]. To train it, one needed to cover one\u2019s body with magic tattoos and use hellfire to temper one\u2019s body. It was extremely painful. After covering the body with nine different types of magic tattoos and after having been tempered by hellfire 81 times, the body would totally transform and become that of a Xiantian lifeform, instantly acquiring boundless strength, the ability to belch hellfire, and immediately regrow a severed arm. This was an extremely hard yet extremely fast way of training. Theoretically, one only needed 81 days in order to reach the Xiantian level.[Indestructible Blood Fiend]. The pain this caused was even greater than that of the [Calamity Fiend] training method. It required three years of magic tattoos, three years of a hellish, tormented existence.[Song of the Inferno]. This required one to train next to a blazing inferno, then to be engulfed by a blazing inferno, and then finally to enter the lava of a volcano without being harmed at all. It required a person to become one with fire. Once a person could control the limitless power of fire, the one would be considered to have reached the Xiantian level\u2026Reading these three, Ning began to frown.Why was it that these Fiendgod training methods were all so painful? It was worse than torture!\u201cYou foolish child.\u201d Snow couldn\u2019t help but speak out. \u201cOnly a few Fiendgod Body Refining methods are truly painful. Only five of these nineteen books are excruciating painful. The others aren\u2019t nearly as bad. I didn\u2019t expect that the first three you picked up\u2026\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Ning let out a sigh of relief.Yichuan, seated nearby, said coldly, \u201cFiendgod Body Refining is far more difficult than Ki Refining. For a mortal to become a Xiantian lifeform is against the natural law of the world. To reach that level through the most difficult method, the Fiendgod Body Refining method\u2026of course it is hard! In addition, these methods which require miserable agony and difficulties, although they are quick, can be considered heterodox methods which cannot be considered to have a good foundation.\u201dNing nodded as he continued to read.[Vajra Buddhist Sutras]. This was a type of Buddhist Vajra training method.[Freeform Soul]. It required an extremely long period of time to train, but after reaching the Xiantian level, it allowed one to freely transform one\u2019s body and filled one with life. Even if one was chopped into many tiny pieces, one would quickly reform. This was one of the topmost life-preserving types of Fiendgod Body Training.[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. Without question, the number one type of Fiendgod Body Training method!\u201cWhat?!\u201dNing\u2019s eyes turned hungry, and he immediately stared at the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] and began to read carefully.The [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] had nine parts.The first three levels were for the Houtian stage.The middle three levels were for Xiantian lifeforms.The later three levels were for the Zifu stage.\u201cIt really is different. Those other training methods, at their peak, only allowed the trainees to become peak Xiantian lifeforms. But this [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] allows a person to reach the peak Zifu level.\u201d Ning continued to read carefully despite his excitement.Upon reaching the Xiantian level, one would be able to control water and fire, and also possess astonishing physical strength. One\u2019s body would be light and agile, and all six of the senses would be sharpened. Severed limbs would regrow.Upon reaching the Zifu level, one would be able to regenerate from a single drop of blood. Upon reaching the Wanxiang stage, one would have amazing powers, such as growing three heads and six arms, the Kuafu Sunchaser ability, or Shining Dragon Eyes ability. But of course, the prerequisite was that one would need to be trained in these magical powers.Fiendgod Body Refining adepts were able to easily suppress Ki Refining adepts of the same level.But the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was able to suppress all other types of Fiendgod Body Refining techniques!This was publicly knowledged!There was no dispute!But training in it was extremely hard, the hardest of all. This, too, was undisputed!\u201cThat will be my choice!\u201d After flipping through the remaining Fiendgod Body Refining books, without hesitating at all, Ning made his choice. \u201c[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve chosen?\u201d Yichuan looked at his son.\u201cYes.\u201d Ning nodded.Yichuan said slowly, \u201cCrimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens\u2019. This is publicly acknowledged by everyone in the world as the most powerful Fiendgod Body Refining method. It is far more profound than the likes of the \u2018Song of the Inferno\u2019, the \u2018Vajra Buddhist Sutra\u2019, or the \u2018Calamity Fiend\u2019 techniques. And that\u2019s just at the Zifu level. The later stages of it are even more profound. If you are able to become a Zifu Disciple, it would be very easy for you to advance to higher levels as well.\u201d\u201cThis is the most widely spread and most easily obtainable type of Fiendgod Body Refining technique.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cBut it is also the hardest!\u201dNing laughed.He had spent two years here in this world reading many books. He knew that refining techniques were extremely important! The more profound the training technique, the harder it was to train in. For the higher level books regarding the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] to be easily obtainable meant that it was all the more important for him to choose this one.\u201cIt has the greatest power! The undisputed best!\u201d\u201cIt is the most widespread one!\u201d\u201cIt is the most easily obtainable method!\u201dYichuan looked at his son. \u201cIt has countless merits, and just one flaw; it is extremely difficult! There hasn\u2019t been a single member of the Ji clan of any of our five Prefectures who managed to reach the fourth part and become a Xiantian lifeform.\u201d\u201cWhat? Not a single member of the Ji clan in all five Prefectures has been able to use it to become a Xiantian lifeform?\u201d Ning was shocked.It was fine if they didn\u2019t reach the Zifu stage.But not even one had reached the Xiantian lifeform stage?\u201cRight.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cNot a single one. Because it is simply too hard, far harder than you can imagine. But I must admit that it is the most mysterious and most powerful Fiendgod Body Refining method. Even in the legends of the Fiendgods, this technique is the most powerful one!\u201d\u201cThen this will be my choice!\u201d Ning didn\u2019t hesitate at all.He was born into the world with the likes of the [Nuwa Painting], one of the highest class visualization techniques which would allow him to stand out even amongst the armies of Heaven. With such a firm foundation, how could he not at least give it a shot? Even if he failed, that wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. He could then choose to train in another technique.\u201cFine!\u201d Yichuan revealed a rare smile on his face. He was very happy with his son\u2019s resoluteness. \u201cThen I will go get the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] for you.\u201d\u201cThank you, father.\u201d Ning was filled with anticipation.\u2026..Dark night.The door to the room was closed, and inside the room, the arm-thick candles were flickering. There were only three people in the room. Yichuan, Snow, and their son, Ning.Ning was holding an extremely thick book with scarlet red letters and reading through it. This was the legendary, most powerful of techniques: [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].\u201cIt really is hard.\u201d Ning was frowning as he read it.The [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] had several major obstacles.The first was the introduction. In order to begin training in it, one had to be able to sense the \u2018Great Yang\u2019 (the Sun) and the \u2018Great Yin\u2019 (the Moon) in the skies. Many other Fiendgod training methods required the absorption of elemental energy, such as fire, water, or electricity in order to build up power. But the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] required its practitioners to immediately begin sensing those two greatest of celestial bodies, and to absorb the energy of the Sun and the Moon.Many trainees simply couldn\u2019t sense the Sun and the Moon at all. And this was just the first step!Afterwards, by absorbing the energy of the Sun and the Moon, one\u2019s entire body would become covered with divine tattoos. This was the second part! After the Divine Sun Tattoo and the Divine Moon Tattoo were completely formed, one could be considered as having completed the first level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]! Actually, from this very first level, one could tell how unimaginably profound this technique was, because many of the other techniques, such as the [Calamity Fiend] technique, all relied on physically carving the magic tattoos onto one\u2019s body.But for the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], those tattoos would be formed naturally, and the divine tattoos were of the Moon and the Sun!Once the first level was mastered, one was usually able to easily reach the third level without any problems.But breaking through to the fourth level and becoming a Xiantian lifeform was even more difficult.It required \u2018Yin and Yang to Fuse, Water and Fire Become One\u2019. Only then could one break past and become a Xiantian lifeform.The later obstacles\u2026those were too far off. There was no need to worry about them.\u201cWhew.\u201d Finishing reading, Ning let out a long breath.Yichuan and Snow looked at their son.\u201cFather, please instruct me with regards to the mysteries hidden within the first level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].\u201d Ning looked at his father.\u201cUnderstanding the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] is very easy.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cAll you need to do is follow the instructions on the pictures. There are nine pictures to the first level. It is very simple.\u201dNing nodded. He had read many books in this world, and when he flipped through it, he had quickly learned what the training method was. But he was worried that he might have missed some sort of profound meaning. After all, training was something he couldn\u2019t be too rash about. Since his father had said that the instructions in this book were very clear, then it was time to start.Ning closed his eyes and raised his fists, then bowed down\u2026this was the first diagram: Bowing to the Sun and the Moon!He carried out all of the movements in accordance with the pictures, seeming almost to move in accordance with a strange ritual dance, and his body carried within it a strange, ancient aura.\u201cHrm?\u201d Yichuan was surprised.\u201cHis very first attempts at the movement are so accurate and so precise.\u201d Snow was surprised as well. Although most people wanted to make the movements properly, they wouldn\u2019t actually be able to do so as precisely as they wished. However, Ning had been training in accordance to the [Nuwa Painting] since his birth. His soul was very powerful, and he had extremely strong control over his body as a result. Given that he had also constantly been cleansed by the energy of nature and his soul was as pure as an infants, it was quite natural that he could easily make accurate movements.Hua!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing\u2019s final movement was to sit down in a kneeling position, his two arms hanging down in front of him, as though one was resting on the sun while the other was resting on the moon.Utter silence.Yichuan and Snow were holding their breaths as well. They knew that it was the critical movement. The earlier dancing movements were only for the purpose of allowing one to sense the \u2018Great Yang\u2019 (the Sun) and the \u2018Great Yin\u2019 (the Moon). Whether or not Ning would be able to sense those two most exalted of stellar bodies\u2026Despite this just being the introductory part to the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], it had prevented countless people from training in it.The two of them knew that the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was the hardest Fiendgod Body Refining method to train, and they knew that the chance of their four year old son being able to master the introductory part was very low. However, parents always hoped that their children would succeed. They waited, hoping for a joyous surprise to happen\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8 \u2013 The Moon in One Hand, the Sun in the OtherNing could feel his consciousness passing through multiple layers of the world\u2019s obstructions, constantly going forward\u2026after passing through countless layers, he entered an infinite, endless void. Deep within that infinite void was two incomparably enormous stellar bodies.One was an enormous stellar body which had huge plumes of raging flames dancing on its surface. It seemed like an enormous ball of flame, and it illuminated the endless void.The other was covered with a layer of unending ice, with an enormous osmanthus tree in the middle of the ice. The stellar body\u2019s cold light also illuminated part of the world.These two ancient stellar bodies, one was the Solar Star (the Sun), the other was the Lunar Star (the Moon).\u201cToo beautiful. Too incredible.\u201d Ning was absolutely stunned. He felt that he could even \u2018see\u2019 those enormous plumes of flame and \u2018see\u2019 the enormous leaves of the osmanthus tree.Others, when training in accordance with the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], found it very hard to even hazily sense the Solar Star and the Star, but Ning could even \u2018see\u2019 the plumes of flame and the leaves on the osmanthus tree.\u2026.Within the hall.Yichuan and Snow were watching in astonishment. They saw countless spots of starlight appear in the area around Ning. The countless spots of starlight were primarily gold and silver in color; scorching hot gold starlight and ice cold silver starlight. They swirled around Ning, not stopping in any location. Slowly, beneath Ning\u2019s left hand, a miniature star formed beneath his left hand, and on it an Osmanthus Tree could vaguely be seen. This was the Lunar Star.And on his right hand, there formed a fiery hot miniature star that was surrounded by a flying Golden Crow. This was the Solar Star.The Solar Star in one hand, and the Lunar Star in the other.Surrounded by starlight, Ning\u2019s face seemed so peaceful, so pious.\u201cThis\u2026this\u2026\u201dYichuan and Snow looked at each other, stunned.\u201cThe Moon in one hand and the Sun in the other?\u201d Yichuan couldn\u2019t help but show his shock on his face, no matter how calm and collected he normally was. \u201cThe Osmanthus Tree was born on one, and the Golden Crow flies around the other?\u201d\u201cThe legendary, \u2018Moon in one hand, Sun in the other\u2019?\u201d Snow stared fixedly at the two miniature stellar bodies which had formed in her son\u2019s hands. \u201cAnd even the Osmanthus Tree and the Golden Crow have appeared\u2026\u201dThe two were in a state of absolute shock. They were not ordinary people. Naturally, they knew much more than the common person, and they had personally read the contents of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] before. They naturally knew what this scene portended. The [Scarlet Diagram of the Nine Shining Heavens] was extremely difficult to train in, and the training speed would normally be very slow.There were several types of \u2018initiations\u2019 one might see.The first type was called, \u2018threads of starlight\u2019. Only two threads of starlight would slowly enter the body. This was the poorest type of initiation and guaranteed that one would be extremely slow in training.The second type was called \u2018clouds of starlight\u2019. A large amount of starlight would surround the body and form a cloud. This was quite good, actually.The third type, was known as \u2018a vortex of starlight, the Moon in one hand, the Sun in the other\u2019. Countless flecks of starlight would swirl around the body like a vortex, while the left hand would form a \u2018Lunar Star\u2019, while the right hand would form a \u2018Solar Star\u2019. This was the peak result. But if the two miniature stars formed to be so realistic as to even show the \u2018Osmanthus Tree on the Lunar Star, Golden Crow on the Solar Star\u2019, then this would be the legendary perfect result.Actually, it wasn\u2019t strange for this result to occur.Ning had trained using the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique since he was born, a technique which even in the Deva realm would be a top class technique. He was even capable of dividing his mind. One could imagine how powerful his soul had become. And in addition, after being born, every day he had been nurtured and cleansed by natural elemental energy, rendering his body as pure as a newborn infant\u2019s body, without any impurities. The purity of his body was on par with a Xiantian lifeform!His body was as pure as a Xiantian lifeform\u2019s.His soul was so powerful that he could divide his mind.With these two strengths combined, it was natural that he would have the utmost aptitude for Fiendgod Body Refining.\u201cFor my son to have this sort of natural gift\u2026\u201d Snow\u2019s face had turned red, and she was so excited that her body was shaking. \u201cYichuan, the Moon in one hand, and the Sun in the other. Osmanthus Tree was born, and the Golden Crow flies! This is something out of the legends! Our son will definitely have great accomplishments when training in accordance to the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].\u201cRight.\u201d Yichuan was very excited as well.When his son was born, he had sensed that his son\u2019s arteries were very weak, and his bones were very ordinary as well. Although he knew that his son had been injured in the womb, he was still somewhat disappointed, because he knew\u2026in this brutal, man-eat-man world, anyone who had no power would find it hard to live a good life. While he was alive, he could protect his son, but what if he died?\u201cThis is my son! The son of Ji Yichuan!\u201d Yichuan held his wife\u2019s hand tightly, and the two stared with excitement and hope towards their son.Which parents didn\u2019t hope that their \u2018children would fly like dragons\u2019?\u2026..Ning\u2019s eyes were closed, and he continued to sit on his knees, holding his two hands in front of him limply, with the Lunar Star in one, and the Solar Star in the other.Those two miniature floating Solar Star and Lunar Stars were separately transmitting energy nonstop into Ning\u2019s body. The power of the Sun and the power of the Moon were quickly absorbed by the ravenous cells in his body, and Ning\u2019s entire musculature and bone structure were undergoing constant transformations.\u201cSwish\u2026\u201d A layer of ice suddenly appeared on the beast fur clothes which Ning was wearing.But then, \u201cCrackle crackle crackle.\u201d The back of Ning\u2019s clothes suddenly began to burn with fire.Both frozen and blazing.This constant interchange was resulting in his furs starting to split apart.\u201cHrm?\u201d Yichuan frowned. He pointed with a finger, and a ray of blue flowing light leaped out of his finger towards Ning\u2019s back, and the already half-ragged fur clothes totally split apart and collapsed, leaving Ning\u2019s back totally bare. On Ning\u2019s tender, young back, there was silver light flashing on the left, while golden light flashing on the right.On the left, frozen side, the silver light was constantly flowing and slowly forming into a pattern.On the right, blazing side, the golden light was also constantly flowing and also formed a separate pattern.\u201cDivine Tattoos!\u201d Snow said softly. \u201cThe very first time he trains, he is already beginning to form the Divine Tattoos. Given this tattoo forming speed, in ten days or so the tattoo will have been fully formed. By then, the first level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] will be done.\u201cRight.\u201d Yichuan watched quietly.Time passed\u2026The Divine Tattoos on Ning\u2019s youthful back continued to grow. One could faintly tell that the left tattoo was that of a rabbit, while the right side was that of a crow.The two great Divine Tattoos. The Divine Moon Tattoo was that of the Moon Rabbit, while the Divine Sun Tattoo was that of the Golden Crow.\u201cHu.\u201d Ning suddenly let out a long breath and opened his eyes. The Divine Tattoos on his back disappeared as well, and the two stellar bodies in his hands quickly dissipated. This caused Ning to be greatly startled. He had carefully read the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], and he knew exactly what it meant for him to have the Moon in one hand, the Sun in the other, especially with the Osmanthus Tree being born and the Golden Crow flying.\u201cWhat a powerful force.\u201d Ning clenched his fists, feeling his body surge with power. \u201cI\u2019m just a four year old child and I\u2019ve just been initiated into the Fiendgod Body Refining method, but I already am this strong.\u201dSuddenly, a cold voice rang out.\u201cPut on a change of clothes.\u201d With a wave of his hands, his father Yichuan made a set of children\u2019s fur clothes appear out of midair, then tossed it to his son.\u201cYes.\u201d Ning immediately grabbed it.Snow was still looking at her son, her face filled with joy. The more she looked at him, the happier she felt. Her son was her pride and her joy. On the day he was born, she had been worried about her son\u2019s future\u2026but now, her son had demonstrated such inconceivable potential. As a mother, in her heart, naturally she felt filled with joy.\u201cNing.\u201d Yichuan said calmly.\u201cFather.\u201d Ning listened carefully.\u201cYour potential is extraordinary. However, if you wish to break through the bottleneck of ordinary lifeforms and become a Xiantian lifeform, and then embark on the road to becoming an Immortal, potential alone isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cYou need to receive the best instruction possible.\u201dNing said respectfully, \u201cFather, please instruct me.\u201d\u201cSnow.\u201d Yichuan looked at his wife, Yuchi Snow. She nodded, and with a flip of her hand, two items appeared. One was a deep green gemstone, roughly the size of a fingernail. It was cut and very beautiful. The other was a flashing, rainbow-colored, fist-sized rock.\u201cThis deep green stone is known as a kalestone.\u201d Snow smiled. \u201cThis is a naturally forming gemstone which contains a miniature dimension inside of it. You can use it as part of a ring and store small items in it, or you can hide and store it within your belt. All you need to do to make it yours is to bind it with blood.\u201d\u201cKalestone!\u201d Ning was overjoyed.Training to become an Immortal was divided into two paths; the Body Refining path and the Ki Refining path.Body Refiners belonged to the Fiendgod path and didn\u2019t teach someone how to use magical treasures.Ki Refiners, after becoming Xiantian lifeforms, would be able to control a few low level treasures\u2026but even the lowest of manufactured treasures had a minimum requirement of the user being a Ki Refiner of the Xiantian level. Thus, most Fiendgod Body Refiners would also concurrently train in Ki.However, Heaven always gave people a chance.There were some naturally occurring objects which only needed to be bound by blood and didn\u2019t have any strength requirements. kalestone was one of them!\u201cBind it first.\u201d Snow handed the kalestone and a shortsword over.\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d Ning accepted them. He didn\u2019t hesitate at all, as he gently pricked his finger with the edge of the shortsword. A single drop of blood fell onto the kalestone and was quickly absorbed, giving the kalestone a hint of a blood color.\u201cGet in.\u201d Ning willed the shortsword in his hand to disappear, and it did, reforming and floating within the miniature dimension inside the kalestone.\u201cCome out.\u201d The shortsword appeared in his hands.\u201cHow magical.\u201d Ning was absolutely delighted.He knew long ago that these naturally occurring dimensional gemstones existed. They weren\u2019t like those manufactured treasures, which all had relatively large internal dimensions. The kalestone, as a naturally occurring object, had a much smaller internal dimension. Some were only the size of a fist or a head! These half-meter long ones were definitely an extremely precious treasure.\u201cMother.\u201d Ning hurriedly said. \u201cPlease help me make a belt and put the kalestone inside of it.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Snow nodded. \u201cThe kalestone can be considered a treasure, but to our Ji clan, it isn\u2019t something particularly valuable. Given your father\u2019s status\u2026a kalestone isn\u2019t even worth discussing! However, the other treasure is something which your father only obtained after a life-and-death crisis!\u201dSnow solemnly handed over the fist-sized rock which shone with the colors of the rainbow.\u201cBind it.\u201d Snow looked at her son.Ning stuck out his finger and once more pricked it gently with the shortsword. A single drop of blood fell onto that flashing rainbow stone. The blood was quickly absorbed, and inside the rock, countless red \u2018arteries\u2019 could suddenly be seen. And then, the fist-sized rock turned into a liquid and flowed towards Ning.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Ning felt his entire body turn cold.\u201cIt is like the kalestone. It is a naturally occurring treasure. The name of this treasure is the Goldstar Shirt.\u201d Snow explained. \u201cYou can use it immediately after binding it. It will quickly enter and become part of your skin. With the protection of the Goldstar Shirt\u2026nothing below the Xiantian lifeform level will be able to harm you with its attacks.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing was shocked. \u201cSo powerful?\u201dHe had never read of this in any of the books.\u201cThe Grand Xia Dynasty, from the Fiendgod Era until now, has existed for countless of years, and the territory it rules over is vast. In the area around Swallow Mountain, our Ji clan reigns supreme. But in some of the more distant areas\u2026there are clans that are even more powerful than our Ji clan.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cIn some of those ancient, mighty clans, some of the promising young youths, while they are still young, they will be given this Goldstar Shirt to help protect them.\u201dNing was startled. Turning to look at his father, he felt a warm feeling in his heart.His parents truly were very good to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the future, you must have accomplishments in the Fiendgod Body Refining techniques, and in term, Fiendgods specialize in body power. What you need to do is to utilize all of your potential and all of your strength.\u201cRight.\u201d Ning nodded seriously.\u201cWith the Fiendgod Body Refining, your strength will be great, your movements will be fast, your vision will be clear at great distances, your hearing will be more sensitive, and even your body\u2019s recovery ability will be astonishing!\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cIn order to transform these into true, mighty power\u2026\u201d\u201cFirst of all, what you need is a weapon!\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cYour strength might be ten times greater than your opponent\u2019s, but your opponent might be able to shoot you to death from afar with an arrow. That\u2019s what makes a good weapon so powerful.\u201d\u201cIn addition, you must be good at actually wielding a weapon. For example, a swordsman who has no internal strength but who has reached the second level of sword mastery, \u2018man and sword become one\u2019, is capable of easily piercing the throat of a powerful yet inexperienced warrior. After all, no matter how much internal strength the warrior has, he can\u2019t block the sharpness of a sword!\u201d Yichuan said slowly.Ning understood this logic of course.A powerful but stupid brute who encountered an assassin who was good at wielding shortswords would die in a single exchange of blows!A strong body was just one aspect. Skill and technique was what determined how much of your power would be actually utilized! For example, in his past life, those competitors in the kickboxing or jujitsu competitions all were roughly on the same level in terms of physical fitness; it was technique and battle strategy which determined their competiveness.\u201cTell me, what do you want to learn?\u201d Yichuan looked at his son.\u201cNing, son, think carefully.\u201d Snow looked at her son as well.Actually, in their hearts, they had already mapped out a plan for their son. After all, as they saw it, their son was still too young, even though he was smart and capable. But they still wanted to ask their son what he wanted, so as to help him learn to think everything through. And then, they would tell him what they thought and let him reflect on the differences.\u201cI want to learn three things.\u201d Ning suddenly said.\u201cFirst of all, I wish to learn archery.\u201d Ning said.He was to walk on the Fiendgod Body Refining path. He would possess astonishing eyesight, and also enormous, heaven-granted strength. Naturally, he had to learn archery. The arrows released by a mighty Fiendgod were definitely capable of breaking past the sound barrier, and the power of its arrows was definitely far greater than the bullets of sniper rifles in his past life. He could kill his opponent from far away. And archery, according to the books he had read, wasn\u2019t too hard to learn.\u201cSecond, I want to learn how to use twin swords!\u201dThe Ji clan specialized in sword techniques!His father Yichuan was nicknamed the \u2018Raindrop Sword\u2019. With a resource such as this at his disposal, he absolutely had to learn how to use swords!\u201cTwin swords?\u201d Yichuan frowned. \u201cContinue.\u201d\u201cThird, I need to learn agility-enhancing techniques and escaping techniques.\u201d Ning said. \u201cThese are what I need.\u201dIf he encountered a powerful opponent, he would flee!Only escaping techniques would allow a person to live longer. And the longer one lived, the more possibilities one would have.Snow laughed. \u201cNing is headed in the right direction. However, I think it\u2019s best if you first start with single swords\u2026there isn\u2019t a single twin sword expert in the entire Ji clan, and when training in swords, the greatest danger is in losing concentration. You must focus all of your concentration on a single sword. Only this will allow you to achieve greater accomplishments.\u201d\u201cYour mother\u2019s words are correct.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son.\u201cFather, mother, I\u2019ve been able to divide my mind since I was born.\u201d Ning raised his head to look at his parents. He wasn\u2019t able to explain about the [Nuwa Painting], and so he just had to claim that he was able to divide his mind since he was born.\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cDivide your mind?\u201dYichuan and Snow were both shocked.\u201cDo you know what dividing your mind means?\u201d Yichuan growled. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as simple as multitasking. It means that your mind can simultaneously contemplate two separate matters without losing any effectiveness or causing any disruption.\u201d\u201cI truly can divide my mind.\u201d Ning said hurriedly.\u201cThen let\u2019s give it a test.\u201d Yichuan\u2019s eyes began to glow with an astonishing light. With one hand, he pulled over two pieces of chalk. \u201cUse these two rocks to write on the ground. With your left hand, write your mother\u2019s name, while with your right hand, write my name. Write simultaneously!\u201d\u201cYes, father.\u201d Ning nodded.Ning took the two pieces of chalk. It felt rather similar to the chalk he had used in his previous life. Immediately, he began to use his hands to write as instructed. Writing with the chalk actually felt quite natural.Hua! Hua!His left hand and right hand easily wrote at the same time, and what he wrote was the ancient, complicated script of this world. On one side, he wrote the name, \u201cJi Yichuan\u201d. On the other, \u201cYuchi Snow.\u201d His strokes were firm and very graceful.\u201cNing, you\u2026\u201d Snow was stunned.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Yichuan was stunned as well.\u201cNo wonder. No wonder you were able to train in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Shining Heavens] so quickly.\u201d Yichuan said slowly. \u201cSo our son\u2019s soul is so powerful that he can divide his mind!\u201dYichuan looked at his son as though he were looking at a piece of priceless, unpolished jade. Extremely excited, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve only been able to reach the level of dividing my mind because I\u2019ve trained for so long. However, I\u2019ve focused on using a single sword since I was young\u2026my path is set, and hard to change! But my son is able to divide his mind since birth\u2026he is a born twin sword user. He will be able to use twin swords as though two people were wielding them and make his opponents feel like they are being attacked by two people at once. What\u2019s more, those two people will have their hearts and intentions totally linked, increasing the effectiveness ten times over!\u201d\u201cFrom today onwards, I will personally train you in using swords!\u201d Yichuan looked at his son.\u2026.Early next morning.The thick natural energy of the world filled the hazy morning. Ning had already been brought by his father to the training grounds.\u201cNing.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son, then pointed at a nearby fur-clad, bearded man. \u201cThis is the number one expert archer of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. His name is \u2018Blindfish\u2019. His archery skills are extremely high. Blindfish, come, let the little fellow see what you are all about.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Blindfish said respectfully.Yichuan walked in front of them towards four marble tablets, each one of them weighing several hundred pounds. Yichuan grabbed one of them, then threw it far away into the distance, and then grabbed another one and tossed that one as well. In the blink of an eye, all four of them were howling through the air.These massive, heavy tablets were thrown with such force that they made the air howl. They were like four missiles, and had transformed into black dots in the sky.\u201cHrm.\u201d A pitch-black greatbow appeared in the hands of the bearded man, Blindfish, along with four arrows. He raised his bow high.Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!Four arrows flashed through the skies, disappearing almost instantly as they chased after those four black dots. Pengpengpengpeng!!!!! Those four black dots totally disappeared.Ning gaped at the sight.He gaped for a long time.\u201cWhen father tossed those heavy stones, he threw them at least one or two kilometers and turned them into missiles?\u201d Ning felt stunned. \u201cAnd this Blindfish\u2019s arrows\u2026I felt like, in the blink of an eye, in less than a second, they arrived at that distance of a kilometer or two away. If we calculate it carefully\u2026these arrows must have at least travelled at the speed of nearly two thousand meters a second.\u201d\u201cThe legendary god, Houyi, once sent out nine arrows in a row and shot and killed nine Golden Crows.\u201d Blindfish laughed loudly. \u201cYoung master, I only possess some superficial skills.\u201d\u201cMaster Blindfish, the rubble won\u2019t hit or hurt anyone when it falls, will it?\u201d Ning suddenly remembered to ask this question.Yichuan shook his head. \u201cNing, your Master Blindfish is a Xiantian lifeform, and has infused his arrows with his own innate energy. When the arrows reached the tablets, they immediately blew the tablets into dust which will drift down slowly. How can there be rubble which would smash anyone?\u201dNing was secretly shocked.Formidable indeed.\u201cFrom today onwards, every morning, you will come train with your Master Blindfish for an hour in archery.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cThis can be considered your morning exercises. Blindfish, sorry to trouble you.\u201d\u201cTo be able to teach the young master is Blindfish\u2019s glory.\u201d Blindfish laughed loudly.Yichuan nodded, then turned and left.The entire training yard was very quiet. Only Blindfish and Ning were there. Not even a servant was present.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Blindfish looked at Ning. \u201cTo an archer, the most important thing is his bows and arrows. The arrow is divided into three parts; the arrowhead, the arrow shaft, and the feathers. As for the bow, it is comprised of the bowstring and the body. Arrows can be made in large quantities, but bows are far more precious!\u201d\u201cThere are two types of bows.\u201d\u201cThe first type of bow is made from an elastic bow body and a tough bowstring. When drawing the bow, the body of the bow will curve\u2026and that is where the power comes from, the curving of the bow\u2019s body. This is the most commonly seen type of bow, and is a fairly simple type of archery. It is easy to produce, and ordinary archers use it.\u201d\u201cThe second type of bow has a tough, inflexible bow body and an elastic bowstring. When pulling the bow, the bow\u2019s body will essentially remain firm, while the bowstring will be pulled to an astonishing elastic length. This bow in my hand is that sort of bow!\u201dBlindfish handed the pitch-black greatbow in his hands to Ning.Ning accepted this simple greatbow, and he instantly felt its weight. This greatbow was at least a hundred pounds heavy. He couldn\u2019t help but stare at it carefully. The body of the greatbow was made from some sort of pitch-black metal which gleamed. The bowstring, however, was as thick as a finger, and carried a blue color. A terrifying fiendish aura could dimly be sensed as coming from the bowstring.\u201cThis bow body was forged from \u2018thunderwind metal\u2019 and is incomparably tough. But the bowstring is even more precious\u2026it was made from one of the draconic tendons of a Diremonster that was slain, a Dragonsnake. It possesses astonishing elasticity. Even if my strength was ten times greater, I wouldn\u2019t be able to break it.\u201d Blindfish laughed. \u201cThe name I gave my bow is \u2018Thunderdragon Bow\u2019.\u201dNing\u2019s eyes shone as he listened. A bowstring made from the tendons of a Dragonsnake, a Diremonster?\u201cCome, let\u2019s begin to learn the proper stance.\u201d With a flip of his hand, Blindfish produced an ordinary bow.\u201cStanding shot stance, crouching shot stance, backwards shot stance, falling shot stance, running shot stance!\u201d Blindfish looked at Ning. \u201cYoung master, your training will be divided into two segments. The first is the basic segment. The second is the mental segment.\u201d\u201cIn the basic segment, you need to practice those five stances to the point where \u2018hand, eye, and arrow become one.\u2019 You must always hit your target. Only then can you move to the next segment.\u201d\u201cIn the mental segment, the stances are no longer important. The only thing you need is for your \u2018mind and arrow to become one\u2019. You no longer need to use your eyes to see. That\u2019s simply too slow. You must rely on your mind! In the blink of an eye, you will draw your bow and fire your arrows upon your target as fast as lightning. In a truly critical situation, you only have a heartbeat to do what you need. Nobody will give you a chance to slowly aim. When you have mastered the mental segment, then you will have completed your apprenticeship.\u201dNing listened and nodded.And then, according to Blindfish\u2019s instructions, he began to train in the proper stance.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWaist straight! Left arm extended!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the correct posture for drawing the bow. Stay in that posture!\u201d\u201cEyes! Eyes! Are your eyes blind?\u201dAs soon as he began teaching in earnest, Blindfish began to roar at him. The ignorant Ning was like a piece of white parchment. Howled at again and again, Ning could do nothing but endure it and slowly learn.A ten thousand meter high building is still built up from the ground floor. An expert archer had to start with the basics as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10 \u2013 FootworkAfter practicing archery for an hour, the Sun had already begun to rise.\u201cNing, child, I shall be the one to teach you footwork.\u201d Yuchi Snow, clad in white furs, smiled as she looked at her son.\u201cYes.\u201d Ning said.Although he had exercised to the point where his waist and his back were bitterly sore, because he had trained in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], his body\u2019s regenerative speed was astonishingly high. Right now, his mind was clear, fresh, and full of energy.\u201cIn close combat, footwork is every bit as importance as sword techniques!\u201d Yuchi Snow said solemnly. \u201cWhen two people engage in a battle, the one with better footwork and agility can make it hard for the opponent to injure them, while they are able to easily injure the opponent.\u201dNing nodded.He understood this logic.Close combat didn\u2019t just mean standing there like an idiot, waving swords and sabers at each other. It was constantly changing positions like an unpredictable shadow. In his past life, he had seen taekwondo and karate experts. Those most elite competitors all valued footwork highly, and their footwork was exquisite, capable of causing ten enemy punches in a row to miss, or at least have their power reduced greatly.The importance of footwork was arguably even higher than that of attacking techniques! Because he had been tormented by illness in his past life, Ning truly and ardently enjoyed watching those competitions, which made him understand the importance of footwork in those taekwondo and karate competitions.In this world where spirits and monsters abounded, the basics were still the same.Footwork was one of the most important things.\u201cI will teach you a footwork technique known as the [Shadewind Steps].\u201d Snow said. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by its ordinary name. This is a very amazing set of footwork techniques. I am the only one who knows it in our Ji clan, and even amongst all five Prefectures, it is considered the highest type of footwork technique. Once you begin learning this footwork technique, you will understand how to dodge and move about in tight areas, while also learning how to easily flee.\u201d\u201cFirst, carefully read the six basic movements.\u201d With a flip of her hand, Snow made a thick yellow book appear out of nowhere.Ning accepted it and began to read it carefully.This book described the [Shadewind Steps] and its six basic movements. All six of the movements were exquisite and profound in their movements and usage of force and energy.\u201cDon\u2019t just stare at it.\u201d Snow pointed at a distant area. \u201cLook over there.\u201dNing turned his head and saw wooden pillars. There must have been thousands of wooden pillars there, and they were all of different height and at different distances from each other. Above these wooden stakes was a number of beast capes, thousands of them which dotted the area like ropes.\u201cThat is known as the Thousand Star Array.\u201d Snow said. \u201cThrough the usage of the Thousand Star Array, within ten years, you should be able to be able to reach the \u2018Ruwei\u2019 stage of the Shadewind Steps. If it wasn\u2019t for the Thousand Star Array\u2026you probably would have to spend a hundred times the amount of time.\u201d\u201cThe [Shadewind Steps] technique has three stages.\u201d\u201cFirst, the basic stage.\u201d\u201cSecond, the advanced stage.\u201d\u201cThird, one with the world.\u201dSnow looked at Ning. \u201cActually, all techniques, be it footwork, sword, saber, spear, or anything else, can be divided into these three stages. For example, the \u2018advanced stage\u2019 of sword technique is often described as \u2018one with the sword\u2019.\u201d\u201cHave you memorized the mysteries of the six basic movements?\u201d Snow asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Ning nodded.Snow then walked towards the Thousand Star Array, then pointed at one of the very short pillars. \u201cGo stand on top of this pillar.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ning easily jumped onto the wooden pillar.He instantly felt wobbly. The pillar wasn\u2019t very thick, and there was only enough space for a single foot. Fortunately, after having trained in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], he had an extremely good sense of balance. This was the only reason why he was able to stand stably.\u201cListen to my orders. Whichever one of the six basic movements I ask you to use, that\u2019s what you use.\u201d Snow said. \u201cThe \u2018advancing\u2019 move!\u201dNing immediately tried to charge forward and step atop another pillar in front of him, but when he brushed against a beast skin rope and, with a swish, he fell down to the ground.\u201cRemember, whenever you are moving in the Thousand Star Array, you must not step onto any of the beast skins. Once you do so, you\u2019ll have to start over again.\u201d Snow said.Ning ground his teeth.He refused to believe it would happen again.He once again hopped onto the short pillar, and then, using the \u2018advancing\u2019 move, he dodged past the beast skin and moved onto the next wooden pillar. However, he had used too much force. His body swayed for a long while before he was able to steady himself on that one foot again.\u201cRemember, your movements must be like nails, driving a nail down with each step. When you land on the pillar, you must be nailed to it!\u201d Snow said. \u201cEach step cannot be too small or too large. It cannot be too light or too heavy. Just now, you swayed wildly. If this was a life or death fight, you would\u2019ve been stabbed to death by an enemy who would\u2019ve discovered a flaw in your attacks. Continue. The \u2018advancing\u2019 move!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018advancing\u2019 step!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018sidestep\u2019 step!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018leaping\u2019 step!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018backwards\u2019 step!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018withdrawing\u2019 step!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018turning\u2019 step!\u201dSnow snapped one order after another.Actually, all footwork techniques relied on these basic movements. But the differences between different techniques were like night and day in terms of skill. Some would make you move as fast as a bolt of lightning, while others would make you as agile and graceful as the wind, or perhaps as unpredictable as a spirit.Each footwork technique had its own mysteries, and naturally would have different effects in battle.\u201cOof!\u201d He hadn\u2019t leapt high enough, and his back had brushed against the beast skin ropes, causing him to be unable to land onto the wooden pillar. He fell down.Not saying a word, Ning climbed back onto the pillar.\u201cOof!\u201d His knee hadn\u2019t been bent enough.\u201cOof!\u201d He had used too much force.\u2026On those thousands of wooden pillars, Ning was moving like a flash, wildly training in these six basic steps. Because of the obstruction of the beast skins, Ning\u2019s body also had to undergo various contortions to dodge them. But no matter what postures he used, the most important thing was that his center of gravity had to be stable, and his feet had to be stable!\u201cMother, how long will I train like this for?\u201d Ning had fallen so many times.\u201cNing, son, start from the shortest pillar and move through all 1008 wooden pillars, then jump down from the tallest one! You are not to touch any of the beast skins on the way!\u201d\u201cIf you are able to complete this within the time it takes for one to take ten breaths, then you will have mastered the \u2018basic\u2019 level of this footwork.\u201d Yuchi Snow laughed.Ning was stunned when he heard this. \u201cWhat? In ten breaths? Such a short period of time\u2026even on running on the flat ground, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that in ten breaths.\u201d 1008 wooden pillars, all of which had to be traversed. That was a distance of a thousand or so meters. It would take him a while to travel that distance at a full run.\u201d\u201cLater, Ning, when you have finished mastering the first level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], you would be able to travel a thousand meters on the ground in ten breaths.\u201d Snow laughed.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Ning was speechless.\u201cMoving in the Thousand Star Array as though you were on the ground\u2026only then would you have mastered the \u2018basic\u2019 stage.\u201d\u201cThen what about the second, \u2018advanced\u2019 stage?\u201d Ning couldn\u2019t help but ask.Snow pushed one of the nearby beast skin ropes, which began to collide with the other beast skins. Soon, the thousand plus beast skins were all swaying against and hitting each other in a totally wild, chaotic manner.\u201cThe second stage, the \u2018advanced\u2019 stage, requires you to once again start from the lowest pillar and move through all 1008 pillars, then jump down from the tallest one, in the span of ten breaths, without touching any of the beast skin ropes. However\u2026for the \u2018advanced\u2019 stage, all of the beast skins will be striking each other.\u201d Snow looked at Ning. \u201cOnce you can do that, you will have mastered the \u2018advanced\u2019 stage.\u201d\u201cBut but but\u2026how is that possible? If all the beast skins are swaying about, how will I dodge them? There would probably only be a split second for me to dodge the beast skins and also jump onto the wooden pillars. And in such a short time frame\u2026\u201d Ning felt that this was simply too hard, impossibly hard.\u201cThat is why I said that with the help of the Thousand Star Array, you should need ten years to reach the \u2018advanced\u2019 stage of the [Shadewind Steps].\u201d Snow said. \u201cFrom now until lunch time, you will continuously practice here at the Thousand Star Array.\u201d\u201cThen what about the third stage, \u2018one with the world\u2019?\u201d Ning couldn\u2019t help but ask.Snow looked at Ning and laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s on an entirely different level. Once you reach it, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d\u201cHow powerful is it? You can at least explain it.\u201d Ning asked.\u201cAlright. If I have to describe it\u2026even ten thousand arrows raining down on me at the same time wouldn\u2019t be able to injure me at all.\u201d Snow looked at her son.\u201cTen thousand arrows at the same time?\u201d Ning instantly imagined a thick cluster of countless arrows raining down, but none of them able to touch him. This was inconceivable. A human\u2019s body occupied a certain amount of space, after all. If those countless arrows filled the skies, logically speaking, there should be no way to dodge them.\u201dSnow smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t be discouraged. Most of the peak Houtian experts of the various tribes are only able to reach the first, \u2018basic\u2019 stage.\u201d\u201cXiantian lifeforms are usually able to reach the second, \u2018advanced\u2019 stage.\u201d\u201cMost Zifu Disciples are able to reach the third stage of \u2018one with the world\u2019. But of course, some extremely talented Xiantian lifeforms are able to reach the level of \u2018unity with the world\u2019\u2026such as your father!\u201d Snow said.\u201cFather?\u201d Ning was surprised and delighted.\u201cYour father\u2019s footwork has reached the level of \u2018one with the world\u2019. And even in swordplay, which is harder to train in than footwork, your father has reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level.\u201d Snow laughed. \u201cThat is why your father is the undisputed number one expert of the Ji clan\u2019s West Prefecture. That\u2019s why his prestige awes all of the countless tribes.\u201dNing\u2019s heart immediately swelled with a heroic feeling. Whatever his father could do, he himself could definitely do, especially since he had the [Nuwa Painting] and the wisdom from his past life!\u201cContinue!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018advancing\u2019 step!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018turning\u2019 step!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018leaping\u2019 step!\u201dNing\u2019s small, young frame carefully flashed about the Thousand Star Array, occasionally falling down.\u2026.After lunch.After having eaten to his fill and rested for a while, Ning was pulled to the training yards once more by his father. The afternoon spring Sun was dazzlingly beautiful, and its rays were very comfortable.\u201cFather.\u201d Ning looked at his glacier-like father, clad in a blood-red beast fur. His heart was filled with awe. His father had killed even Diremonsters such as Dragonsnakes. In terms of strength and skill, his father had already reached an extremely high level. Even some Xiantian lifeforms had come to ask to be taken as his father\u2019s disciple and learn his sword techniques.His father had nine primary disciples, three of which were Xiantian lifeforms. But his father only taught the nine disciples once every month.But Ning? He would be taught every day!\u201cFrom today onwards, I will teach you how to use the sword.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son and said in a cold voice, \u201cThe sword is not the bow, nor is it like footwork.\u201d\u201cArchery training only requires one to become familiar with it. Once one\u2019s strength increases and one\u2019s vision improves, naturally, one will be able to fire more powerful arrows!\u201d\u201cAlthough footwork is important, it is still supplemental\u2026to kill an opponent, you still have to use your sword in the end!\u201d\u201cSwords are considered short weapons! They are light and agile, with two edges. Their usage is more precise and profound than that of sabers; whether by slashing, by stabbing, by chopping, by scraping, or by tapping, one can easily kill the opponent. Sometimes, a person who is training incorrectly can even hurt himself. It is the truest weapon of war.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son.Ning could feel his blood boiling, and he was extremely eager. His eyes were shining. \u201cFather, what sort of sword technique will I learn?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSword technique? Wait a few more years!\u201d Yichuan said coldly.\u201cWait a few more years?\u201d Ning was confused.Yichuan said coldly, \u201cThe movements of the sword are birthed by your body! If you wish to use the sword well, then first, you must control your body well. First, you must train in boxing. After your body and your arms are extremely agile and you can fully control your strength, then your body will be ready to learn sword techniques!\u201d\u201cBut preparing your body isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\u201cYou must also prepare your \u2018mind\u2019 for learning the sword!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11 \u2013 Sword TrainingNing, listening to this, felt totally confused, as though his head was covered by mist and clouds. \u201cFather, you say that I must prepare my body before I can train with a sword. I can just barely understand that. But I must also prepare my \u2018mind\u2019? What does that mean?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be impatient.\u201dYichuan looked at his son. A thick book appeared in his hands out of nowhere. He tossed it towards Ning. \u201cFirst, closely read through this boxing manual. There are sixteen stances in this boxing technique. It contains the simplest yet most fundamental of methods to allow one\u2019s body to exert strength. Once you have mastered this boxing technique, your entire body will act as you will and you will be able to exert strength with ease.\u201d\u201cThe sword is born from your body. If not even your body acts as you wish it to, how can your sword act as you wish it to?\u201d Yichuan looked at his son, worried that his son would bite off more than he could chew. \u201cFirst, you must calm your mind.\u201dNing understood the logic that \u2018sharpening the knife didn\u2019t slow down the cutting process\u2019.\u201cYes, father.\u201d Ning said as he lowered his head to begin reading the book. He began to closely review the mysteries of boxing described in the book. The book was quite thick, but actually, it was because it was made from animal leathers, which made every page very thick.After memorizing the profound secrets, he began to train. His father constantly gave him advice and pointed out his mistakes, or even demonstrated himself so as to help Ning understand.Actually, the [Shadewind Steps] also contained some principles on exerting force, but the [Shadewind Steps] were primarily about using force in the legs. Because he had some prior experience now\u2026Ning learned relatively quickly.Two hours later.\u201cRest a while.\u201d Yichuan looked at his sweaty son. \u201cIn the future, you will spend two hours every day training your boxing, unless and until I judge that your body is prepared to train with the sword.\u201d\u201cPreparing your body to train with the sword is just one aspect.\u201d\u201cYou must also prepare your \u2018mind\u2019 to wield the sword.\u201d Two black metal swords appeared in Yichuan\u2019s hands, and he tossed them to his son. \u201cTake them!\u201dNing took the two swords.Yichuan pointed to an empty area. Hu. A metallic puppet appeared out of nowhere, wielding a single saber.\u201cThis is a puppet.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cKi Refining practitioners of the Immortal way are often good at producing these puppets. This one is just a very ordinary puppet, with the power of a master-level Houtian combatant. However, its body is extremely tough.\u201d\u201cFather, what are those red spots on its body?\u201d Ning wondered.The black metal puppet had over ten red dots on its body. The red dots were located between its forehead, on its throat, on its chest, on its arms, hands, back, and some other areas.\u201cTry stabbing at the red dot on its forehead.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cYou have to be fast.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ning stabbed out fiercely with his right hand.Hua!The tip of the sword pierced forward, but it struck the head, roughly an inch away from the red dot.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Ning was slightly startled. He clearly had aimed at the red dot. He couldn\u2019t help but try stabbing three more times, but the results were always the same, slightly off.\u201cHave you discovered it?\u201d Yichuan said calmly. \u201cAlthough you want to stab it in the middle of the forehead, when you actually try to do so, you aren\u2019t able to do so accurately. How can you stab accurately? First, you have to have to control your body perfectly. Second, you have to train countless times.\u201d\u201cEvery single sword technique can be described as being composed of thirteen specific movements; chop, pierce, scrape, sweep, break, tap, cleave, support, intercept, twist, lift, draw, and sheath.\u201d\u201cChop, pierce, scrape, sweep, tap, cleave; these are used to attack.\u201d\u201cSupport, break, intercept, twist, lift, draw, and sheath; these are used to defend.\u201dYichuan pointed at the metal puppet. \u201cThis puppet isn\u2019t moving at all, and it has nine red dots on its body. Execute the \u2018chop, pierce, scrape, sweep, cleave, and tap\u2019 movements against it. I will teach you the secrets to every single movement and how to move in harmony with your attacks. Every single basic movement must be practiced at least ten million times!\u201d\u201cIn the future, the puppet will begin to move and chop at you with its own saber techniques. You will then use the \u2018support, intercept, twist, lift, draw, break, and sheath\u2019 movements, the seven basic defense movements, to defend yourself. You will train all of these movements ten million times as well.\u201d\u201cAttack!\u201d\u201cDefend!\u201d\u201cAfter you have become familiar with these two, the puppet will engage in battle against you, and you will use the combined thirteen stances to fight against it.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cWhen the day comes when your thirteen basic stances have become engrained into your mind and your bones, and when you are perfectly accurate, that is when you will have absorbed the essence of the sword into your mind. Only then will your mind be ready to train in the sword.\u201dNing listened with his breath held.\u201cPrepare your body.\u201d\u201cPrepare your mind.\u201d\u201cAfterwards, you will be able to truly start training in sword techniques.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cSword techniques are very complicated, but they are still formed from these thirteen basic movements. If you aren\u2019t even able to memorize and absorb these thirteen basic movements\u2026how can you possibly have any achievements in training with the sword?\u201d\u201cAfter you have truly become familiar with the sword techniques I will pass down to you, then you can be considered to have reached the first, \u2018basic\u2019 level of wielding a sword.\u201d\u201cThe sword has three levels as well.\u201d\u201cThe basic level, the advanced level, and the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level!\u201d\u201cThe \u2018advanced level\u2019 for footwork requires precise control over the body. But the \u2018advanced level\u2019 for the sword requires one to have precise control over both the body and the sword, and then merge them into one! It is ten times harder!\u201d\u201cBecoming \u2018one with the world\u2019? That\u2019s even farther off.\u201dYichuan looked at his son. \u201cJi Ning, do you now understand the path you must walk?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ning nodded heavily.The [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] training technique would give him a Fiendgod\u2019s body and inconceivable strength.But the training in footwork and swordplay would decide\u2026how much of that strength he would be able to use!\u201cFather, how long would I need to train before I can reach the level of \u2018one with the sword\u2019?\u201d Ning couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cHard to say.\u201d Yichuan shook his head. \u201cIn the past, I had spent six years mastering the basics, then six more before becoming \u2018one with the sword\u2019. You can say that it took me twelve years!\u201d\u201cTwelve years?\u201d Ning held his breath.His father, despite being young, had become the number one expert of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. Someone as peerless of a talent had him had needed twelve years. Many ordinary people\u2026would spend their lives training without being able to reach the \u2018one with the sword\u2019 level.\u201cDon\u2019t bite off more than you can chew. Take things one stable step at a time.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cLet\u2019s begin. Let me first teach you the \u2018pierce\u2019 movement of the thirteen basic movements!\u201d\u2026\u2026.Under his father\u2019s guidance, Ning\u2019s posture was very correct as he pierced repeatedly! Chopped repeatedly! Scraped repeatedly! Tapped repeatedly!This was very boring.And very tiring.Fortunately, Ning had astonishing regenerating capabilities. And given his experience in being tormented by illness in his past life\u2026he was a person who would not easily give up.After training attacking movements for two hours, he began to train defending movements for another two hours.The metal puppet wouldn\u2019t get tired, delivering endless hacking blows with the saber for Ning to defend against.\u201cYichuan.\u201d Snow stood from afar, watching her son train hard.Yichuan walked to his wife\u2019s side as well, and both of them watched that distant metal puppet battle against their son. \u201cSnow. I didn\u2019t expect this. I really didn\u2019t expect\u2026that our son would have such strong willpower. I had even prepared for him to complain about being tired, and prepared to force him to continue training. I didn\u2019t expect that I don\u2019t need to force him at all!\u201d\u201cWhen he was training his footwork in the morning\u2026\u201d Snow felt sorry for her child. \u201cEven though he said he was tired, all he did was talk. He didn\u2019t stop a single time. Six hours in the morning, six hours in the afternoon\u2026twelve hours of the day spent training. Ning is still very young\u2026\u201d\u201cI still remember when I was young.\u201d Yichuan said softly. \u201cAt that time, I was forced by my father to train. I felt too tired and that I was at the point of collapse, but whenever I gave up, my father would use his whip to beat me. I cried each time I drew my sword or used it to pierce\u2026that continued until I turned ten, and my father was killed by a Diremonster from Eastlake Mountain. The status of my mother and I dropped by a thousand fathoms. Seeing how cold everyone had become towards us and then my mother die of illness\u2026I finally woke up. I no longer said I was tired, or that I was hurting. Every day, I focused on my training.\u201dSomeone who had never trained before would never know how exhausting training was.Tiring to the body. Tiring to the mind.Someone who wasn\u2019t sufficiently mentally resolved or who had insufficient desire wouldn\u2019t be able to persevere.\u201cI had my doubts about our son\u2019s future accomplishments.\u201d Yichuan said softly. \u201cAlthough his aptitude for the Fiendgod Body Refining is very high, if he doesn\u2019t work hard, he still wouldn\u2019t accomplish much\u2026but now, I believe that my son will definitely become one of the true experts of this world. He definitely will!\u201dHearing her husband\u2019s words, Snow stared at her son who was still training in the distance. She gently nodded. \u201cI believe it too!\u201d\u2026\u2026..Watching himself grow stronger, even stronger than those \u2018supermen\u2019 in the movies, was an absolutely wonderful feeling!A year later.Hua!Blindfish, standing far away, threw four stones up into the air. The slightly taller Ning nocked his bow while grabbing four arrows, holding them tightly between his five fingers.Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!Four arrows flashed out simultaneously, leaving behind four trails of air in the sky, hitting all four of the rocks that had been thrown up. The four rocks all shattered into tiny pieces which fell to the ground.\u201cGood.\u201d Blindfish walked over, laughing loudly like the thunder.\u201cMaster Blindfish.\u201d Ning put away the bow.\u201cYou\u2019ve already mastered the mental segment. You\u2019ve even quickly mastered my pride and my joy, the \u2018Quadshot\u2019 skill.\u201d Blindfish praised as he nodded. \u201cI have nothing left to teach you when it comes to archery. Next, you will have to just continuously train and build up experience. As your strength grows, you will be able to fire more powerful arrows. This training courtyard is now too small for you. You need to go to a larger, more expansive place and shoot arrows from a distance of one, two, or even three or four kilometers! The farther away you are shooting from, the more you will have to factor in the wind and the environment.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Ning nodded.Archery required one to be extremely precise.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOne needed to consider the strength of the pull, the trajectory of the arrow, and also the downward pull of gravity. At the same time, one had to factor in the wind speed!Although it was complicated, as long as one could sense the direction and strength of the wind, one would be able to shoot without even needing to aim. This was because the question of from what angle to fire from and how to fire would have already been built into one\u2019s bones from countless repetitive training exercises. At least, to the current Ning\u2026within a range of five hundred meters, not even a fly could escape his arrows!But this was far from being enough!As his strength grew, his arrows would be more powerful as well. Some Xiantian lifeform\u2019s arrows would fly several kilometers and still have tremendous force! The greater the distance, the more difficult it would be to shoot accurately as well\u2026it required even more training and experience.\u201cStarting tomorrow, I won\u2019t come here anymore. Young master, you are the most talented student I have ever taught.\u201d Blindfish looked at Ning. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your talent. In the future, you will definitely become the most terrifying godly archer in the Swallow Mountain area.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12 \u2013 Six YearsWithin the training courtyard, a youth clad in beast fur was wielding a black blunt sword. He stood there, and around him there were nine tall and powerful warriors. These valiant warriors all wore armor and wielding long spears, swords, and sabers, and other weapons in their hands. But none of the weapons had been edged or sharpened.Six years. Ning, who had trained for six years, was now ten years old. But because in this life, he had been training in accordance with the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], he had already reached a height of 1.6 meters tall, just ten centimeters shorter than he had been in his previous life. His appearance was almost identical to how he had looked in his previous life. Perhaps this was what the saying, \u2018a person\u2019s appearance is birthed by their mind\u2019. If one had to find a difference\u2026then the difference was, in his previous life, his face was always sickly pale, while in this life, it was filled with boundless life and energy.\u201cSame rule as always.\u201d Ning stared at the people around him, his gaze even more terrifying than that of monsters. \u201cAs long as any of you can strike me, each person will be awarded a beasthead of gold!\u201d\u201cGrr!\u201d\u201cCareful, young master!\u201d\u201cHaha, a beasthead of gold. Brothers, let\u2019s let the young master see how powerful we are.\u201d These brave warriors began to roar. They were the mightiest warriors within the armies of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture; the Ninefang Warriors! For someone to be awarded the title of Ninefang Warrior required their internal energy to have reached the limits of the Houtian level, and also be warriors with significant battle experience.A beasthead of gold meant ten pounds of gold. Gold coins were used as a form of currency in the countless tribes, and ten pounds of gold, to these powerful warriors, was an extremely attractive offer.But they didn\u2019t dare to be incautious, because Ning\u2019s power had spread across the army long ago. He had often sparred in the army with some of the elite soldiers\u2026and thus, Ning\u2019s ability had risen rapidly, as these warriors all knew. Even if nine of the most powerful warriors joined forces against him\u2026defeating Ning would still be a hard task. However, it was still possible.The blunt black sword in hand, Ning stared quietly at the surrounding people.Actually, ever since he had learned the reputedly most complicated of sword techniques [108 Swords of the Gods and Demons] and mastered it to the point where his father nodded in satisfaction, sparring with the metal puppet had become meaningless. Thus, he was permitted to begin sparring with the large number of soldiers and warriors in their army. While sparring, they always used blunt weapons.At the same time, his father had given him a strict order: \u201cWhen sparring with others, you are only allowed to use a single sword! In addition, you are only permitted to use a tenth of your real strength! Only when sparring with your mother and I are you allowed to use the twin swords. Remember, the twin swords are your secret weapon. You are only permitted to use it when you really intend to kill your opponent.\u201dThus\u2026Although Ning\u2019s fame had become widespread across the army and he had been acknowledged as a rare talent, that was just the tip of the iceberg. But of course, when engaging in battle, Ning used all of his available skill in the \u2018single sword techniques\u2019 and in the \u2018footwork\u2019 techniques.\u2026.The nine warriors surrounded Ning, walking in a circle around him while staring at him as though staring at their prey.Ning just stood there, as unmoving as a mountain.\u201cShua!\u201d One of the nine soldiers surrounding him suddenly charged forward. The bald soldier was wielding a longspear in his hands, and struck out with it like a viper, instantly arriving next to Ning.Faced with this fierce spear, Ning\u2019s body flickered and he drew near the bald warrior\u2019s body, causing the spear to miss its mark.Spears were weakest against close quarters combat!\u201cChi!\u201d The blunt sword in Ning\u2019s hand sliced out. As the sword flashed towards him, the bald warrior hurriedly used his feet to kick against his longspear, sending it sweeping towards Ning as he himself rolled back into the array of soldiers surrounding Ning.\u201cWow, that was dangerous. I almost got ended in one exchange. Brothers, be careful.\u201d The bald warrior quickly called out as he returned to the others.Ning had already stepped on top of that longspear, staring at the people around him. \u201cIt is better if you come all at once. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have no chance.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201dThe nine warriors, sensing the disparity in power, didn\u2019t launch any more probing attacks. They immediately charged forward at full strength.The wind howled. Sabers flashed. The shadow of sword agilely danced about. Spears hissed through the air like dragons. Sticks smashed down like ferocious tigers. Attacks came from every direction towards Ning, while Ning just stood there, just occasionally taking a step back or turning. These seemingly minute movements resulted in many of the warriors\u2019 attacks missing.The clanging sounds of weapons bashing against each other could be heard like thunderclaps. Clearly, these blows carried great force.Occasionally, the sound was just a whisper-soft snick.\u201cNinefang Warriors really live up to their name. These nine have really good teamwork. If it was just five or six of them\u2026I would be able to beat them in an instant. But the nine working together have put me at a complete disadvantage.\u201d Ning found it very difficult to deal with the storm of attacks from these nine warriors. After all, he only had one sword. Under this sort of pressure, he was forced to use his sword techniques and his footwork techniques to their utmost.\u201cHu!\u201d\u201cHu!\u201dThe sword howled.Ning suddenly felt intoxicated. Right at this moment, his body and his sword seemed to be in perfect harmony, and he seemed to even somehow feel the \u2018body\u2019 of the sword itself, and even the wind which blew past the sword at high speed.\u201cChi!\u201d The blunt black sword gently chopped against a cavalry saber. It trembled, but then with a twist, it pushed the enemy\u2019s blade to the side and out of the enemy\u2019s control. And then, the tip of the sword went forward, stabbing into the warrior\u2019s chest. The warrior felt the pressure against his chest, and he immediately retreated two steps, then sat down.\u201cHu.\u201d The blunt black sword slashed through a curved pattern in the air, easily avoiding the opponent\u2019s blocking longspear, then slapping with the flat against the bald warrior\u2019s face. With a bang, one of the man\u2019s tooth went flying and was knocked away.Time seemed to past as slowly as a leaf falling down in the autumn wind.Ning\u2019s sword had suddenly become extremely nimble, and the movements of his sword were careful and minute, able to change in a flash. In a life and death battle\u2026a momentary advantage was enough to change the outcome of a battle into a victory. Thus, although Ning had previously found it very hard to resist those nine warriors, he now, in the blink of an eye, was able to knock them all down.\u201cCongratulations, young master.\u201d\u201cCongratulations, young master, on your swordplay reaching the \u2018advanced\u2019 stage, \u2018one with the sword\u2019.\u201dThe warriors were both shocked and excited. All of them congratulated him.A youth who was merely ten years old was able to reach the \u2018advanced\u2019 stage of swordplay, and become \u2018one with the sword\u2019. This was more incredible than even the accomplishments of his father, the \u2018Raindrop Sword\u2019, Ji Yichuan.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Ning was extremely excited as well. Six years. Six years of constantly training with the sword. Every day, aside from the time he spent training his archery skills outside the city at dawn, he spent virtually all of his time training with the sword. Sometimes he would train with his father, while sometimes he would train with his father\u2019s disciples. Sometimes, he would spar against the army soldiers.The sword had long ago imprinted itself into his bones.After training with the sword for ten million times, his accuracy with the sword had reached a terrifying level a long time ago.And, with his ability to split his mind, his sword techniques became all the more elusive and unpredictable.He had the body of a Fiendgod, and in terms of Ki Refining, he had already reached the peak of the Houtian stage in internal energy. This caused his sword attacks to be unstoppable.And finally, today!All of these accumulated experiences had formed a cohesive whole, and he entered the \u2018advanced\u2019 stage of swordplay, \u2018one with the sword\u2019!\u201cEveryone, today you have helped me to make a breakthrough. Although I don\u2019t have much, I am giving each of you a beasthead of gold. Don\u2019t try to refuse.\u201d Ning laughed loudly.The nine warriors exchanged glances, then said in unison, \u201cThank you, young master!\u201dIf they had simply lost, they wouldn\u2019t have accepted it. After all, these Ninefang Warriors had their own pride and dignity. But for young master Ning to reach the \u2018one with the sword\u2019 level was a major, joyous occasion. Such a joyous occasion\u2026it was only fair and proper that they, too, receive some gifts.\u201cNine of them.\u201dThe distant Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf, his two maids, hurriedly ran over with stone platters. Atop the stone platters were nine beastheads of gold. They were all the highest quality gold! The nine warriors laughed as they accepted it, while at the same time, feeling moved\u2026young master Ning truly was powerful. But they had all seen with their own eyes how hard Ning had worked over these years.\u201cCongratulations, young master. Felicitations, young master.\u201d After the nine warriors left, Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf allowed their faces to be covered with joy and celebration.Six years had passed, and the two maids were now twenty years old. This was the most bewitching age for a woman. Maids such as these would usually be their master\u2019s women, which is why they had long ago in their hearts decided to consider Ning as their world, as their god. To see their young master become so powerful, they naturally were extremely happy.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Ning laughed as well.Anyone would be excited. After all, he had trained bitterly since he was young. How could he not be excited upon succeeding?Only after training with the sword for two years had his father decided that his \u2018body\u2019 and his \u2018mind\u2019 were prepared to learn sword techniques. Only then had he been taught the [108 Swords of the Gods and Demons] technique.After another year, when he mastered the first level, his father permitted him to spar with others.After three more years, culminating in this day today, he had finally reached the second level, the \u2018advanced\u2019 level, becoming \u2018one with the sword\u2019.\u201cSpring Grass, Autumn Leaf, come with me.\u201d Ning called out. What he wanted to do the most right now was to go see his parents.\u2026.Deep in the mountain ranges, there was a series of furious howls.There was a large number of black armored riders, and these armored riders all had extremely thick armor, all covered with spikes as well. Their mounts were tall and powerful furry beasts with a single horn. These furry beasts had two curved, fierce looking fangs which flashed with cold light. Their four hooves were thick and sturdy. When they ran, the earth itself shook.The hundred black armored riders all gave off the aura of powerful experts.\u201cHuh?\u201d The black armored riders all turned to stare at a place nearby. They saw a distant mountain quickly begin to turn red, and then begin to transform into scorching hot lava. A large amount of lava began to pour out from somewhere in the mountain, and faintly, a human figure could be seen walking on top of the lava, his entire body covered with flames. He walked straight towards them.Hu.With a single step, he leaped to the ground. He was bringing with him a ferocious scaled beast that was blackish-brown in color. Behind him, there was also a four-hooved beast that was walking as well. Quickly, the human figure flew out from the middle of the lava, revealing his face\u2026it was a face belonging to an old man, with fiery red hair and a small scarlet snake hanging from his ear. The four-hooved beast also walked to the viper elder\u2019s side, seeming extremely obedient.\u201cMaster.\u201d The hundred black armored riders called out respectfully.The viper elder laughed loudly. \u201cWe came hunting, but I didn\u2019t expect that we would run into an Armored Wyrm. My luck isn\u2019t bad. This Armored Wyrm is very close to becoming a Xiantian lifeform. When I get home, I need to spend some time raising it.\u201d\u201cMaster, master!\u201d A voice suddenly rang out from the skies.Ji Lee raised his head.In mid-air, an enormous flying beast with blue feathered wings could be seen, with a man wearing an exquisite beast pelt seated atop it. After the flying beast landed at high speed, the rider immediately jumped off and landed on the ground, then came to one knee. \u201cMaster, there\u2019s news from the Prefecture.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201d Lee frowned.\u201cYichuan\u2019s son, Ning, has entered the \u2018one with the sword\u2019 stage today.\u201d The man said respectfully.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLee stared at him, the fire surrounding his body blazing hotter. He was so angry that his entire body began to shake. Suddenly, he smashed that Armored Wyrm he had captured into the distant mountain cliff. The heavy monstrous beast, at least ten thousand pounds in weight, turned into a blur. With a bang, it smashed against the distant mountain cliff, and on it appeared an enormous crevice which was now surrounded by hundred-meter long cracks. The Armored Wyrm lay there in the crevice, blood pouring from its head, and its scales shattered. It had been smashed to death.\u201cReturn to the West Prefecture City!\u201d Lee ground his teeth for a long time before finally shouting out this order.\u201cYes.\u201d The hundred black armored riders said in unison. Although they felt that throwing away the corpse of the Armored Wyrm was a huge waste, their master, Ji Lee, was currently in a royal rage. Naturally, no one dared to contradict him.Rumble rumble.Lee, riding his four-hooved monstrous beast, was followed by his hundred black armored riders. They left the deep, mysterious mountain forest and quickly disappeared, only leaving behind that Armored Wyrm in that crevice in the mountainside, its blood still dripping down the cliff.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Behind him was the four-hooved beast. The two entered his estate, and those servants and house guards all knelt down or lowered their heads when seeing him. None of them dared to even breathe too loudly. They could all tell that their master, Lee, was in an extremely foul mood. Someone who upset him might be slapped to death.\u201cFather.\u201d A sound from afar, and a middle-aged man clad in beast fur with dozens of braids in his hair came out.Lee glanced at him. The person was his most competent son, and also one who had become a Xiantian lifeform; Ji Jadewich. Frowning, he said, \u201cJadewich, is this true? I just went out hunting, and shortly afterwards, I received news that Yichuan\u2019s little animal has reached the \u2018advanced\u2019 stage of swordplay, \u2018one with the sword\u2019?\u201d\u201cIt is, father.\u201d Jadewich shook his head and sighed. \u201cToday, Ji Ning and nine Ninefang Warriors were sparring. He made a breakthrough in swordplay while sparring. There\u2019s no doubt about this at all.\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201d Lee let out an angry sound. \u201cThe Heavens have set themselves against me, Ji Lee. My elder brother, Ji Young, was inferior to me, but due to my arrogance, I allowed him to seize the position of Prefecture Lord. He produced an outstanding descendant, Ji Yichuan, making his lineage even more stable. But now, an even more outstanding Ji Ning has been produced, who in six years managed to reach the \u2018one with the sword\u2019 level!\u201d\u201cReaching the \u2018one with the sword\u2019 level in just six years. Those three geniuses we selected from those countless tribes are far inferior to him by comparison.\u201d Jadewich shook his head as well.For the sake of blocking Ning\u2019s progression, they had specially selected three outstandingly talented children near Ning\u2019s age, and began to teach them from a young age. But they were still inferior to Ning.\u201cJust a bit off. If Grizzly was just three years younger\u2026\u201d Jadewich sighed.\u201cGrizzly?\u201d Lee was startled.Grizzly was his foster son.In the past, when he had led the army to punish one of the larger tribes for a transgression, he had encountered a Diremonster, a \u2018Golden Grizzly Bear\u2019. After a vicious, terrifying battle, the Golden Grizzly Bear had finally fled in defeat. Lee then raided the Golden Grizzly Bear\u2019s lair, and found inside the lair an infant child. The infant wasn\u2019t a year old, but was born with tremendous strength\u2026and was very much to Lee\u2019s liking. He had said, \u201cKid, you were snatched by a Golden Grizzly Bear but weren\u2019t killed. Instead, it raised you? Hahaha\u2026from today onwards, you will be the adopted son of myself, Ji Lee. I\u2019ll name you\u2026Grizzly!\u201dIt was common for someone to raise an adopted son who possessed extraordinary abilities.When Grizzly was brought back home, it was determined that he was one year old. He was now thirteen years old. Lee treated and raised Grizzly as a terrifying monstrous beast, having him engage beasts in battle since he was an infant, and sometimes even with monstrous beasts. Naturally, he also taught Grizzly the most suitable training methods\u2026In the middle of all that combat, last year, Grizzly had reached the stage of \u2018one with the saber\u2019.\u201cThe Ceremony of the Golden Sword is held every four years. There will be one this year.\u201d Jadewich narrowed his eyes. \u201cFour years from now, there will be another one. In another four years\u2026Grizzly will be seventeen. Only those sixteen and younger can participate in the Ceremony of the Golden Sword. Four years from now, Grizzly won\u2019t even be able to participate, much less stop Ning!\u201d\u201cThe only hope we have right now is that the three little brats I took in will be able to become a Xiantian lifeform within these next four years.\u201d Lee muttered.\u201cRight.\u201d Jadewich nodded. \u201cI personally selected the three of them out of all of the tribes as the most suited for Ki Refining. They\u2019ve reached the peak of the Houtian level long ago. If a single one of them can advance to the Xiantian level, then our victory is assured.\u201dLee nodded as well. \u201cA Xiantian Ki Refiner is capable of using magical treasures and would definitely win. Only, it is simply too hard to become a Xiantian lifeform\u2026\u201d\u201cAll we can do is wait and see what Fate has to offer.\u201d Jadewich said softly.Lee nodded lightly.Although they were struggling over the Prefecture Lord position, Ji Lee and Ji Jadewich never even thought about killing Ji Ning. In this vast world, for a clan to be able to survive\u2026they had to be unified, and fratricide was definitely forbidden! In addition, Ning had already been selected as a potential heir. If someone dared to try and use a wicked method to kill Ji Ning, most likely everyone in the Five Prefectures of the Ji Clan would join forces to punish the murderer!\u2026\u2026The thick, large candle lit up the hall. Yichuan was seated in the primary seat, while Snow and Ning sat close to him.The three of them were eating the meal in front of them on the table.\u201cYichuan.\u201d Snow looked at her son, his hands and mouth greasy from the meat he was eating. Her eyes were filled with pride. \u201cOur son Ning mastered the basics in three years, and in three more years became \u2018one with the sword\u2019! It seems it will be easy for him to gain the position of Prefecture Lord.\u201dHolding a ramshorn goblet, Yichuan nodded lightly. \u201cWhen Ning sparred with the others, he only used his internal force. He didn\u2019t use any of the power of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], the number one Fiendgod Body Refining method. And in addition, when sparring with outsiders, Ning has only used a single sword.\u201dOthers didn\u2019t know how powerful Ning was, but Yichuan and his wife knew exactly how capable their son was.Seizing the golden sword?As easy as picking something out of his pocket!\u201cNing, at his current level of power, is already easily capable of seizing the golden sword. In four more years, even Xiantian lifeforms won\u2019t be able to stop him.\u201d Yichuan poured himself another cup of wine.Ning continued to simply sit there, eating and drinking prodigious amounts of food.Because he trained in the number one Fiendgod Body Refining, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], he possessed the appetite of a Fiendgod as well. He could easily eat dozens of pounds of the meat of monstrous beasts in every meal. He had reached the third level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] two years ago. He was at a bottleneck now, but with one more step, he would reach the fourth level!The fourth level would let him become a Xiantian lifeform, and one which belonged to the number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique. His battle ability would far outstrip that of normal Xiantian lifeforms by a hundred times or a thousand times.\u201cGurgle, gurgle, gurgle.\u201d Ning drank large mouthfuls of hot water, pouring it all down his mouth, then rubbed his stomach as he put it down. \u201cThat feels good.\u201d\u201cNing.\u201d Snow looked at her son with a laugh.\u201cMother.\u201d Ning was very obedient. He could sense that his father cherished him but also valued the clan, while his mother had placed virtually all of her hopes and concerns in him. In her mother\u2019s eyes, perhaps even the rise and fall of the entire Ji clan wasn\u2019t nearly as important as her son.Snow looked at her son. \u201cWhen your father taught you the [108 Swords of the Gods and Demons], it was the most complicated level of sword techniques you could learn, and it was the most suitable set of sword techniques for you to reach the \u2018one with the sword\u2019 level. However, now that you have already reached that level, the [108 Swords of the Gods and Demons] technique is no longer of much use to you.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cNow, Ning! When I had you prepare your \u2018body\u2019 and your \u2018mind\u2019, I needed you to make all of your attacks as fast as lightning and incomparably accurate. I needed you to imprint those things in your bones. Only then did I teach you the [108 Swords of the Gods and Demons], and the purpose of that was\u2026to let you go from something simple to complicated!\u201d\u201cThe path of sword training first goes from simple to complicated, and then from complicated back to simple. Only then can one be considered to have mastered the sword.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cYou have become \u2018one with the sword\u2019, and you can wield it as easily as your own hands. You can be considered to have gone from complicated back to simple.\u201dNing nodded.He understood this logic. If he was so stupid as to just constantly use those thirteen basic stances, he could still be considered an expert swordsman, but without having truly experienced \u2018going from simple to complicated, then from complicated to simple\u2019, it would be very hard for one to reach the \u2018one with the sword\u2019 level.\u201cNext, you will need to reach the level of being \u2018one with the world\u2019.\u201d Yichuan sighed. \u201cThis step is an extremely hard step.\u201d\u201cOne with the world\u2026\u201d Ning was filled with anticipation.\u201cThe previous sword techniques you\u2019ve learned are now useless to you.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cYour current level is enough to qualify you to learn the highest level swordplay of the Ji clan.\u201dNing\u2019s eyes lit up. The highest level swordplay of the Ji clan?\u201cOur Ji clan is famous because of our swordplay.\u201d Yichuan sighed with emotion. \u201cIn turn, the city of the Ji clan of the Main Prefecture, the \u2018City of Ten Thousand Swords\u2019, was named because the ancestors of the Ji clan rose to fame due to the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords], which they used to establish themselves here.\u201d\u201cAfter thousands of years, the Ji clan now has five highest level sword arts. They are the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords], [Thunderflame Sword], [Illusion Sutra], [Raindrop Sutra], and the [Polaris Secret Manual]. Every single technique is extremely profound and is beyond what the \u2018one with the sword\u2019 level is capable of. If you can make accomplishments in any of them, you will find that their power is boundless.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cI trained in the [Raindrop Sutra]. Most people, even after reaching the \u2018one with the sword\u2019 level, is at most able to select a single one of the arts to train in. This is because dividing the mind is simply too difficult. But Ning, since you are able to divide your mind in two, you would be able to choose two arts to train in.\u201dHu!In Yichuan\u2019s hand, five books suddenly appeared. He casually tossed them out, and they flew straight over, landing in a neat stack on a nearby table, not touching any of the cups or plates.\u201cThe highest level swordplay?\u201d Ning looked at the five books. He understood that these were just abridged versions. Only after he made his choice would he receive the \u2018full versions\u2019.\u201cMake your choice.\u201dYichuan looked at his son and said solemnly, \u201cOnce you have chosen, your choice will be recorded for the Ji clan of the Five Prefectures to review! If it isn\u2019t recorded down, you will be considered to have learned in secret. Anyone who does that will be exterminated by the combined forces of the Five Prefectures.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Ji Ning understood this, but he still couldn\u2019t help but feel surprised. \u201cThen why is it that there was no such restriction on the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] technique that I learned?\u201d\u201cAlthough the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] technique is the number one Fiendgod Body Refining, it is extremely widespread. Virtually all of the tribes on the level of the Ji clan possesses a copy. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t matter if our copy is leaked.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cMost Ki Refining methods and Fiendgod Body Refining methods aren\u2019t very valuable. Only the ultimate techniques of each clan are tightly restricted, like these five sword techniques here. In the area around Swallow Mountain, four of these techniques are possessed only by our Ji clan. Only the [Polaris Secret Manual] is also in the possession of another entity, the Blackflame Sect.\u201dNing nodded.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe knew that in the area around Swallow Mountain, aside from the armies of the Grand Xia Dynasty that were stationed here, there were in total, five other hegemonic powers. The Ji clan was also one of them.These six hegemons engaged in constant battle, but none of them dared to offend the armies of the Grand Xia Dynasty!\u201cRight.\u201d Ning immediately lowered his head and began to read, flipping through these five top-class sword techniques. If a person was at the \u2018one with the sword\u2019 level and then also possessed this sort of top-class sword technique, his power would definitely multiply.\u201cRaindrop Sutra\u2026\u201d This was the first one Ning looked at. This was the top-class technique which had made his father famous.His father\u2019s nickname, after all, was the \u2018Raindrop Sword\u2019!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14 \u2013 The Cage[Raindrop Sutra]. The principle behind it was that of the saying, \u2018dripping water can eventually tunnel through a rock\u2019.Its attacks were soft yet inexhaustible, seemingly as endless as the raindrops falling from the skies during a rainstorm, making the enemy find it difficult to even dodge. In turn, its defenses were utterly airtight\u2026and at the same time, when tens of millions of raindrops converged on one point, it could form a terrifyingly explosive force. Even ordinary drops of water could eventually tunnel through a rock; the sword that had been transformed into \u2018raindrops\u2019 would naturally contain an unshakable, unyielding power.\u201cThe [Raindrop Sutra] truly is profound and wondrous.\u201d Ning nodded as he read it, then picked up the second book, [Polaris Secret Manual].The [Polaris Secret Manual] was part of the legendary [Polaris Sword Manual]. It was divided into seven different sword stances, known as Dubhe, Merak, Phecda, Megrez, Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid. These seven major sword stances all contained the power of the stars. They could be as ferocious and savage as the Voracious Alkaid Wolf Sword, or the extremely soft and extremely sinister Melodious Megrez Sword\u2026The sword technique was unfathomably mysterious, and was very hard to defend against.\u201cWhat a good sword technique.\u201d Ning sighed in amazement as he read, before picking up the other three books.[Thunderflame Sword]. This was something which the ancestors of the Ji clan, when roving and training themselves elsewhere in the world, had been lucky enough to find. They had found a half-burned remnant of a book, and the words in it were not very clear. Only two words on the title could be seen: Thunderflame! In addition, they were only able to reclaim three complete sword stances from the book.All of the stances were used to attack. When the stances were used, it was as though it contained the power of heavenly thunder and hellish flames. There was no question that in terms of attack power, it was the undisputed champion amongst the sword techniques of the Ji clan! For just three stances to allow it to be ranked amongst the Five Major Sword Techniques of the Ji clan, one could imagine how that unnamed complete sword technique\u2026definitely outstripped the other four sword techniques vastly.However, although its strengths were apparent, its weaknesses were also apparent. This was because these vicious stances\u2026were only three in number. Thus, they didn\u2019t perfectly link to each other. In addition, all three stances were purely offensive, without any defensive stances. How could experts, when engaged in battle, have no defensive stances? Thus, very few people would choose to train in this sword technique.\u201cI really want to see what the complete Thunderflame Sword looks like.\u201d Ning couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u201cIf we had a complete copy,\u201d the nearby Yichuan said, \u201cThen it would be, without question, the number one Immortal technique in Swallow Mountain.\u201dNing nodded, then picked up the fourth book.[Illusion Sutra]. Strictly speaking, this wasn\u2019t a sword technique, because once one truly understood the meaning of the word \u2018Illusion\u2019, one could execute an \u2018Illusion Saber\u2019 technique, or an \u2018Illusion Spear\u2019 technique, or an \u2018Illusion Staff\u2019 technique\u2026this was an insidious and powerful attacking technique that allowed one to hide one\u2019s true abilities and actions. Opponents often would die before even knowing what happened.This technique was sinister to the extreme.\u201cThis isn\u2019t suited to my temperament.\u201d The first technique Ning discarded was the [Illusion Sutra]. Picking something suited to a person was very important. A technique that was opposite of one\u2019s natural instincts, no matter how profound\u2026would be incredibly difficult to train. Naturally, Ning immediately discarded it.\u201cHrm, the last one was originally the greatest strength of the Ji clan.\u201d Ning began to flip through the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords].The [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords] was praised as the most complicated of the five sword techniques, far more complicated than the [108 Swords of the Gods and Demons] which Ning had previously learned. But although it was complicated, once one truly mastered it, the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords] could be simplified into three major stances. The \u2018One Sword, Ten Thousand Shadows\u2019 stance, the \u2018Ten Thousand Swords Become One\u2019, and the \u2018Melody of Ten Thousand Swords\u2019.\u2026\u2026Ning closed his eyes, pondering.In terms of being the most awe-inspiring and most complicated, or perhaps even the simplest, it would be the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords].In terms of being the most insidious and difficult to guard against, it would be the [Illusion Sutra].In terms of being the most orthodox, it would be the [Polaris Secret Manual].In terms of having the greatest defense, it would be the [Raindrop Sutra].In terms of the most powerful attack and the deepest, most profound principles, it would be the [Thunderflame Sword].\u201cFirst of all, the [Illusion Sutra] can be excluded. It doesn\u2019t suit my temperament!\u201d Ning pondered. \u201cThe [Polaris Secret Manual] is part of the [Polaris Sword Manual]. In terms of attack, it isn\u2019t very strong. In defense, it isn\u2019t either. It isn\u2019t very exquisite either\u2026it\u2019s comparatively average, but it isn\u2019t weak in any aspect either. When fighting against experts, one must have some sort of advantage! The [Polaris Secret Manual] can be excluded as well.\u201d\u201cOnly three left. The [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords], [Raindrop Sutra], and [Thunderflame Sword].\u201d\u201cThe [Raindrop Sutra] is a must!\u201d Ning thought to himself.The Raindrop Sutra was like a curtain of endless raindrops. It was the most defensive technique amongst the five major sword techniques.In a battle, defensive abilities were even more important than attacking abilities!In his past life, Ning had seen many martial arts competitions. All of the champions were experts at dodging and defense. Even in soccer and basketball, there was the saying that \u2018defense is king\u2019. Although attacks were pretty to look at\u2026it was defense which truly gave the best chances at victory.The venue was different, but the logic was the same!In life and death battles, defense was also important. When encountering an expert more powerful than one\u2019s self, one might reach the point of only being able to defend and not attack. If one\u2019s defense was strong, then perhaps one might still live. But once those attack-focused people encountered those who were even stronger than them, once their attacks were not able to harm the opponent, they were finished.\u201cDefense is the same thing as preserving my life. First, I have to preserve my life; only then can I take the lives of others. In addition, this is the technique which my father used to become famous. With him personally instructing me, I will improve quickly. The [Raindrop Sutra] is a must.\u201d Ning carefully continued to consider. \u201cAs for the [Thunderflame Sword] and the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords]\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, [Thunderflame Sword] it is!\u201d Ning quickly made his decision.If he was like an ordinary person who could only use a single sword technique, Ning probably would\u2019ve made a choice between the [Raindrop Sutra] and the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords].However, since he used twin swords, he already had the [Raindrop Sutra] for defense. Thus, for the second one, he chose the most offensively powerful [Thunderflame Sword]. The [Thunderflame Sword] had, as its flaw, no defensive techniques, but as a twin-sword wielder, that wasn\u2019t a flaw at all. He had already chosen the [Raindrop Sutra] for his defense, and thus what he now truly needed was a powerful killing technique.\u201cThe [Raindrop Sutra] and the [Thunderflame Sword].\u201d Ning made up his mind. \u201cThe [Raindrop Sutra] is excellent at defense, while the [Thunderflame Sword], despite only having three strokes, has three incomparably powerful killer moves.\u201d\u201cIn addition, once my [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] reaches the Xiantian level, my Divine Sun Tattoo and Divine Moon Tattoo will allow me to control fire and water. Water is very suited to the [Raindrop Sutra] while fire is very suited to the [Thunderflame Sword]. I trust they will be of great help to my swordplay.\u201d\u201cIn defending, my defense must be so tight that not even a drop of water can get through!\u201d\u201cIn attacking, my attacks must be as explosively powerful as a fiery volcano!\u201d\u201cI have twin swords. One for defense, one for offense. Or perhaps I can use both for defense. Or both for attack. I\u2019ll do as I please!\u201d Ning rapidly began to evaluate his future possibilities in battle, and he saw the path with crystal clarity. He knew\u2026only once one had a full understanding as to how one would develop and progress would one be able to avoid taking a wrong path. This would help one develop faster!In warfare, strategies were of greater importance than tactics.In a person\u2019s growth, there was a saying that planning counted for more than effort.If one knew the right way one needed to advance towards, even if one didn\u2019t make huge advances every day, after ten or twenty years, one would still reach a high level. But if one didn\u2019t have a clear objective, and just blindly worked hard, a person might just be running in-place without improving, or perhaps even going backwards!\u2026.His careful examination of the books had taken two hours. That huge candle was already half used up. Yichuan and Snow just waited there quietly, occasionally exchanging a few words.\u201cFather, Mother.\u201d Ning suddenly spoke.\u201cHrm?\u201d Yichuan and Snow both turned to look at him. Yichuan spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve chosen?\u201dNing nodded.\u201cNing, son, what have you chosen? One or two?\u201d Snow asked.\u201cI\u2019ve chosen two.\u201d Ning held out the two books. \u201cOne is the [Raindrop Sutra]. The other is the [Thunderflame Sword].\u201d\u201c[Raindrop Sutra]? [Thunderflame Sword]?\u201d Yichuan nodded slightly. As the number one expert of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, despite not having gained any merits in battle after his son was being born, his reputation had only grown. This was because no one knew how powerful Yichuan had become\u2026but no one could dispute that in even ten years, Yichuan had already become the number one expert of the West Prefecture.His judgment was therefore exceptional.\u201cFine.\u201d Yichuan nodded.\u201cI\u2019d like to hear your advice, Father.\u201d Ning hurriedly said.\u201cNo rush.\u201d Yichuan shook his head. \u201cI have some thoughts on the [Raindrop Sutra], but you\u2019ve never trained it in before. Thus, even if I explained my thoughts to you, you wouldn\u2019t be able to comprehend them. You have to first train hard, and even engage in life-and-death battles, before I can successfully guide you.\u201d\u201cTomorrow at dawn, I will give you the full copies of the [Raindrop Sutra] and the [Thunderflame Sword]. At that time, you will perform them in front of me once. As long as you can get the postures and movements right, that will be enough.\u201d Yichuan nodded. \u201cThree days later, you will begin to engage in real battles. Those sparring matches you usually do are too simple and soft. You need to fight in real life-and-death battles.\u201dNing was puzzled.\u201cFather, haven\u2019t I already engaged in life-and-death battles?\u201d Ning couldn\u2019t help but ask. \u201cIn the past, when you acknowledged that my skill had reached the first level in sword training, the basic level, didn\u2019t you have me fight against and kill some prisoners who had been sentenced to death?\u201dHe still remembered the first time he had killed someone. At that time, his entire body had been trembling, uncontrollably so. Although he rationally knew that he shouldn\u2019t be afraid, he still couldn\u2019t help but shake. According to what his father had said\u2026aside from a very few people who lived for slaughter, this was the normal reaction of most people the first time they killed someone.After having killed dozens of people sentenced to death row, he had grown calmer.\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a battle. That was just training your courage.\u201d Yichuan shook his head. \u201cFighting against convicts? All of them were weaker than you. How can that be called a life-and-death battle? Three days from now\u2026I will arrange for you to engage in a true battle with monstrous beasts, powerful ones that have already reached mastery in the Houtian level.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMonsters?\u201d Ning\u2019s face changed.\u201cThose captured monsters will turn insane and ferocious for food and for the chance to live. In addition, they won\u2019t show you any mercy at all.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cIn front of a massive cage, you will fight against the monstrous beasts, one on one. This is the battle which all important descendants of the Ji clan must go through; the \u2018Cage Battle\u2019. Over half of these important descendants will die in that cage.Half?Ning was briefly shocked, but then grew calm again. This was because he knew that the women and the slaves in the various tribes were highly fertile, but the total population here had never changed. Why? Because the savage environment had caused the tribes to need to struggle against the heavens, against the earth, against the Diremonsters hidden within the mountains and valleys, and even against other tribes. Only a few would be able to survive! Even though he was born into the Ji clan, he still needed to face tough, relentless training. Only the elite would survive.It was precisely because all the clan members of the Ji clan were so strong that the Ji clan was famous and had become a local hegemon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15 \u2013Cage BattleThree days later, at dawn, Ning and his father came to Dragon Castle.Dragon Castle was three hundred meters wide, a thousand meters long, and was divided into two parts; the Cage, and the tunnels for the monstrous beasts. The Cage was where the life-and-death battles would be carried out, while the beast tunnels were where the monstrous beasts were imprisoned. Because Dragon Castle held many monstrous beasts inside, it was extremely dangerous, which is why it had been built outside of the city.\u2026..Dragon Castle. Within the Cage.Ning entered the Cage and looked around. This was an empty area that was two or three hundred meters in diameter. The four walls were all made from some sort of black metal, and up above him was black metallic chains that formed a metal web, preventing anyone from fleeing.\u201cThis place is completely sealed.\u201d Yichuan, who faintly emanated a cold aura, said, \u201cThe walls are formed with blackwater iron. Although blackwater iron isn\u2019t a particularly precious material, most early stage Xiantian will find it very difficult to damage such a thick blackwater iron wall. As for the thick chains above, those are also made from blackwater iron. Given your strength\u2026if you are to use the power within the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] and use your full strength, you should be able to break apart the chains. But a web like this formed from many chains\u2026you will probably need the span of ten breaths before you are able to break enough chains to escape.\u201dNing nodded.\u201cLook.\u201d Yichuan pointed towards the air above the net of chains. There was a viewing platform beyond it.\u201cYour mother and I, as well as your Uncle White, will be there watching you.\u201d Yichuan said coldly.\u201cBe careful.\u201d Snow encouraged her son.\u201cRoar!\u201d The snow white dog also looked at Ning, his eyes filled with encouragement and anticipation. This snow white dog was his father Yichuan\u2019s lifelong friend, and was also his own Uncle White. In total, his father had tamed two Diremonsters; one was that massive black python, the so-called Uncle Black! The other was a snow white dog, his Uncle White.Beasts, upon gaining a level of intelligence, could begin to absorb natural energy and transform into monstrous beasts!Monstrous beasts, after managing the difficult art of transformation, would enter the Xiantian level and become Xiantian lifeforms. Only then would they be considered Diremonsters. Generally speaking, Diremonsters were capable of transforming into humans, such as Uncle Black. But amongst monstrous beasts, there was a very unique type of creature: the Godbeasts.Godbeasts were magical beasts that contained some of the bloodline of those ancient Fiendgods of the past. They were born intelligence, and possessed powerful natural gifts. Their strength was far greater than that of ordinary monstrous beasts. They also found it extremely hard to transform into human forms, and for different Godbeasts, the level of difficulty was different as well.Some needed to reach the \u2018Zifu\u2019 level before they could take human form. Some needed to reach the \u2018Wanxiang\u2019 level. Some, even higher\u2026Uncle White was a Godbeast of the \u2018Whitewater Hound\u2019 type, and he had to reach the Zifu level before he could take human form and speak in the human tongue.However, Ning and the Whitewater Hound were extremely close to each other, because after having been taught archery by his teacher, Blindfish, Ning would spend every morning with the Whitewater Hound at the forests outside the West Prefecture training in archery. Yichuan hadn\u2019t been able to rest easy with his son going out by himself, which is why he asked the Xiantian lifeform, the \u2018Whitewater Hound\u2019, to help protect him.The power of a Xiantian level Godbeast was terrifying indeed! The Whitewater Hound was one of the reasons why Yichuan had such a high position and reputation in the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture.\u201cJust watch.\u201d Ning\u2019s lips twisted into a smile.\u201cGrowl.\u201d The Whitewater Hound let out a growl as well, then followed Yichuan and Snow to the narrow walkway. Soon, they arrived at the viewing platform.Ning let out a soft breath, calming himself down as he looked around him.\u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019m in the Coliseum?\u201d Ning secretly murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s a place for battle, and there\u2019s a viewing platform.\u201d He knew that generally speaking, only the important disciples of the clan would be permitted to engage in battle against monstrous beasts here, which is why the elders and family members of the clan would often come watch.\u201cHua\u2026.\u201d \u201cHua\u2026\u201d\u201cHua\u2026\u201dThe sound of chains clanking against each other could be heard from a distant tunnel. Ning couldn\u2019t help but turn to look, and within that pitch black tunnel\u2026he could faintly make out a low, angry growling sound, a sound which actually shook the entire cage. Even the massive chain net above the cage was quivering with the noise.A massive, silver furred head slowly appeared from within the distant tunnel.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Ning looked carefully.\u201cNing.\u201d Yichuan said coldly from the viewing platform above the cage, \u201cYou train in the number one Fiendgod Body Refining, so I specially selected an extremely powerful monstrous beast for you, one with the lineage of the Fiendgods: A Howling Moonwolf.\u201dNing\u2019s eyes widened as he stared above at his father, a look of shock on his face.A beast that possessed the lineage of the Fiendgods?Then that would be a Godbeast, right? But it made sense; Godbeasts were a type of monstrous beast. In the vast world, there were still a good number of Houtian level Godbeasts that roamed about, such as the Armored Wurm, the Earthquake Rhino, the Howling Moonwolf, the Redclawed Goldenraven, the Thundersea Owl, or the Whitewater Hound. Generally speaking, out of every thousand Houtian level Godbeast, only one would be able to break through to the Xiantian lifeform level.\u201cHua\u2026\u201d The metal clanking sound continued.Ning didn\u2019t lose his focus. He stared at the giant tunnel in the wall. He knew that they were probably removing the chains on the other side. Once the chains were removed, the Howling Moonwolf would be released.\u201cPengcheng!\u201d The sound of metal chains hitting the floor.\u201cHoooooowl!\u201d Instantly, a carefree wolf\u2019s howl rang out. In the air above, Yichuan, his wife, and the Whitewater Hound stared carefully down below.Ning held his breath.From the distant tunnel, a massive creature slowly made its way out. Its entire body was covered with beautiful silver fur. It was over two meters tall, and its steps were graceful. It stared at the tiny little pipsqueak standing in the distance; a human male. As one of the special types of monstrous beasts, a Godbeast, the creature\u2019s intelligence wasn\u2019t lower than that of humans.It knew that there were only two possible outcomes after entering this cage. The first was to kill this human and continue to live. The other was to be killed by this human youth.\u201cHe picked a Godbeast for me the first time here.\u201d Ning stretched out his right hand, and a sword appeared in it out of nowhere, gleaming with cold light. \u201cThen let\u2019s kill it.\u201dThe Howling Moonwolf\u2019s massive body weighed nearly ten thousand pounds, but its four legs moved with great agility as it closed the distance. Its long, narrow eyes inspected this human youth.Ning walked forward, one step at a time, with longsword in hand.The distance between the two quickly drew near.\u201cShua!\u201d The Howling Moonwolf\u2019s movements suddenly changed from being graceful to being savage, and it suddenly transformed into a blur as it pounced at Ning, and its previously soft paws suddenly had sharp claws emerge from it as well.Swoosh!At the critical moment, Ning suddenly moved, as graceful as the wind as he dodged the Howling Moonwolf\u2019s pounce, and then stabbed out with the sharp sword in his hand! The stab was extremely forceful and straight, and it was also fast as lightning. If it managed to land on the Howling Moonwolf\u2019s body, it would be able to borrow the charging force of the Moonwolf and tear its body open!\u201cHuh?\u201d As he stabbed, Ning\u2019s face suddenly changed. The sword tip had met with a powerful blocking force. The Howling Moonwolf\u2019s fur had blocked the tip of the sword, preventing it from penetrating through.At the same time, the Howling Moonwolf suddenly sent its tail whisking towards Ning. Unable to dodge in time, Ning quickly used his sword to block.Bang!The Moonwolf\u2019s tail landed against the blade like a heavy iron whip, and the powerful force knocked Ning flying away, his body slamming against the distant blackwater iron wall with a boom. Bang! The thick wall trembled violently.\u201cRoar!\u201d The Howling Moonwolf immediately followed up with another pounce as it slashed at Ning with its claws.Ning quickly dodged with a flying leap.Chi! Chi! Chi! Several deep claw marks appeared on the blackwater iron wall. The Moonwolf landed on the ground, then stared at the distant human youth. Its tail attack was its killing weapon. Its tail had sent the human youth slamming into the wall, but the human youth had actually been able to quickly dodge far away. It understood that this human youth truly was very powerful, powerful enough to give him a good fight.\u201cAn ordinary Ninefang Warrior, upon meeting with that tail, would probably have their organs split open.\u201d Ning frowned as he stared at the Howling Moonwolf. \u201cIt seems I\u2019ll have to rely on the power of the Fiendgod Body Refining.\u201dThese years, he had also engaged in Ki Refining and had reached mastery of the Houtian level.But his attacks with Houtian level Ki Refining techniques couldn\u2019t even break through the fur. How could he use it to fight?\u201cHrmph!\u201dNing let out a deep growl, and from his nostrils came forth two streams of energy that were visible to the naked eye. The streams of energy were causing the air itself to shake. At that moment, the hidden, terrifying potential strength that was lying dormant in his body suddenly exploded forth, and the hidden Solar Strength and Lunar Strength exploded as well, and his entire body began to turn faintly red.With a slight movement of the sword in his hands, Ning shattered the air before him and carved a huge ditch into the thick earth.The distant Howling Moonwolf let out a low growl, staring fixedly at this youth.\u2026.\u201cThe child has finally begun to use the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].\u201d Snow laughed. \u201cBefore this, he was still trying to avoid doing so.\u201dYichuan nodded. \u201cThe Howling Moonwolves have the lineage of the Fiendgods. Their fur is incomparably tough, and ordinary Houtian experts aren\u2019t able to break through it. I chose this creature on purpose\u2026to force Ning to use all of his strength, and see how much of it he can use in a real, life-and-death battle.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think about the look on Ning\u2019s face?\u201d Yuchi Snow asked.\u201cAverage.\u201d Ji Yichuan stared down. \u201cHe\u2019s fairly calm.\u201d\u2026.Spinning the sword in his hand, Ning slowly walked towards the Howling Moonwolf, circling around it.The Moonwolf stared at Ning as well, choosing not to rashly attack. This was because once it attacked\u2026it would expose its own flaws as well. That would the moment which determined life or death.\u201cHrmph.\u201d Not hesitating at all, Ning suddenly charged forward after the Moonwolf, his body becoming a blur.With a howl, the Howling Moonwolf immediately pounced over as well, opening its massive maw and revealing its sharp fangs. Its sharp claws tore at Ning as well.Shua!A flash of the sword!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe shadow of a sword slashed through the air, striking in a short range while changing trajectories nine times. Its speed was terrifyingly fast, so fast that it was as though even the void was being chopped apart with it. Chi chi chi chi chi. The flashing sword chopped at the Moonwolf\u2019s chest, carving out a massive wound, and fresh blood instantly spurted out.\u201cBlock.\u201d Just after Ning chopped out with one sword, he immediately turned his sword back and blocked the Howling Moonwolf\u2019s claw, while simultaneously borrowing the clashing force to fly backwards and retreat.The Howling Moonwolf stared furiously at Ning. The massive wound on its chest was shrinking, and the flow of blood began to slow, but it still continued to drip blood. Clearly, that wound had simply been too massive.The Howling Moonwolf was now truly sensing the impending arrival of death!\u201cThe [Thunderflame Sword]\u2019s technique, \u2018Thunderflash Flint\u2019, really is extraordinary. Ning sighed softly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was now capable of utilizing the techniques of the [Raindrop Sutra] and the [Thunderflame Sword], and his power had increased. However, he had only learned a tiny bit, and he wasn\u2019t even at the level of expertise, much less mastery. After all, even his father, Yichuan, was still pondering on the secrets of the [Raindrop Sutra].Thunderflash Flint was one of the three killer moves of the [Thunderflame Sword]. It relied on a single word; fast!As fast as lightning! As swift as flame!\u201cNing\u2019s swordplay and his footwork are both exquisite.\u201d Snow said in praise from the viewing platform. \u201cAlthough the Howling Moonwolf is as fast as a shadow, even faster than Ning, Ning has relied on the [Shadewind Steps] to constantly change directions. He\u2019s in complete control of this battle. His swordplay has reached the \u2018advanced\u2019 level, and he can quickly make multiple changes in his movements. In dealing with that monstrous wolf\u2026it can be said that his defense is airtight.\u201dYichuan nodded. \u201cWith the Fiendgod Body Refining, Ning\u2019s great strength is his forte, while his speed is a bit weaker\u2026but this is a Godbeast, after all. It has an extremely strong life force. A wound like this is just a skin wound to it. When it starts fighting all out, and with Ning never having experienced such a vicious life and death battle before, the results will be hard to predict.\u201d\u2026.Below, Ning had the feeling that everything was under control, and he continued to wield the sword in his hand as he drew near the Moonwolf.\u201cAwoooooo!\u201dSensing the threat of death from this human youth, the Moonwolf gave a savage howl. All the fur on its body stood up straight as needles, and its eyes turned hard, its pupils flashing. Those who were familiar with Moonwolves could tell\u2026that this one had already entered a wild, bestial state.A terrifying aura spread forth from it, causing Ning to pause.A killing aura?\u201cGrowl!\u201d The Howling Moonwolf charged towards him, the earth shaking beneath it.Ning dodged as agilely as the wind, changing directions with a simple step. At the same time, his sword flashed. Chi! Fresh blood sprayed out once more, and yet another enormous wound appeared on the Moonwolf\u2019s chest, but this time, the Moonwolf didn\u2019t care at all as it sent its two pairs of ferocious paws towards Ning, its knife-like claws slashing through the air.Ning calmly retreated while at the same time, using his sword to block.\u201cKa!\u201dThe Moonwolf\u2019s left paw slammed against the sharp sword, its paw seeming to have transformed into a hook which suddenly latched onto the sword. But how could Ning\u2019s sword, infused with his Fiendgod Body Refining power, be so easily caught? If the two clashed and then immediately flew apart, it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad, but the Moonwolf wanted to fight that power head on with his claws, and so it smashed it hard against the sword.Ka!The Moonwolf\u2019s left paw clearly turned red with blood, and the faint sound of bones breaking could be heard.Hua!The other paw came at Ning\u2019s chest. The distance was simply too close, and there was no chance to block. Ning\u2019s only option was to take a deep breath, and his chest suddenly retracted in by three centimeters. Chi! Chi! Chi! The tough animal fur over Ning\u2019s chest was ripped to tatters. Blood spouted everywhere, and Ning was knocked flying as well, striking against the ground and making the earth itself crack from the impact.Swoosh! Ning hurriedly pulled away.\u201cInjured.\u201d Ning looked at the Moonwolf, his eyes narrowing.Just then, the Moonwolf had actually chosen to use its paw to take his sword head on. The Howling Moonwolf didn\u2019t care about what injuries upon itself were being inflected, as it was going all out. Its left paw was now half useless, and its speed had dropped dramatically as well. But the paw blow it had landed on Ning had torn through Ning\u2019s beast skin clothes. The beast skin clothes were part of the fur from a Xiantian lifeform. Without any monstrous power infused into it, the defense would be a bit weaker, but generally speaking the fur from a Xiantian lifeform would be able to block the attacks of a Houtian monster.However, the Howling Moonwolf was a Godbeast. Its full strength attack was able to rip the fur apart.In order to further train himself\u2026although Ning had the protection of the Goldstar Shirt and could use it to guard his entire body, Ning had shrank its defensive radius to only protect his most vulnerable areas.\u201cA life-and-death battle is different from a spar. I can\u2019t just use the experience I gained while sparring.\u201d Ning quickly changed his calculations. \u201cWhen sparring, nobody will engage in self-destructive behavior, but in a life-and-death battle\u2026the goal is to kill the opponent. For the sake of this goal, any price is worth paying.\u201d\u201cI need to be more careful and more cautious.\u201dNing was like a sponge, quickly absorbing the learned experience. The fierce scar over his chest was visibly shrinking. The blood from it began to stop, and soon, it totally closed over, leaving behind a red line which then turned into white, clear skin. No lasting damage at all!This was the powerful regenerative power provided by Fiendgod Body Refining.Ordinary Fiendgod Body Refining techniques only required a person to reach the Xiantian level before being able to regrow severed limbs. But Ning trained in the number one Fiendgod Body Refining, and his healing abilities were nearly on par with that sort of regeneration already.\u201cExcellent!\u201d Ning cracked his lips into a smile. \u201cIt actually took my sword away.\u201d\u201cRoaaaar.\u201d The sword was stuck right beneath the Howling Moonwolf\u2019s paw. It stared at Ning, its eyes filled with boundless bloodlust. The terrifying recuperative abilities of the human youth in front of it\u2026it understood that this was a Fiendgod in human skin, with even greater healing abilities than Godbeasts.Ning waved his right hand, and yet another sharp sword appeared within it.\u201cCome again.\u201dNing transformed into a shadow as he pounced towards the Moonwolf.\u201cRoaaar!\u201d The Howling Moonwolf charged forward as well.\u2026\u2026The two engaged each other time and time again, each time exchanging blows that nearly took the other\u2019s life. Ning possessed powerful healing abilities and terrifying power, and a fierce sword attack style! But the Howling Moonwolf had its fangs, sharp claws, and tail, all of which it could use as weapons. In addition, its massive body was so large that most weapon wounds were of minimal threat to it.\u201cSo he\u2019s only using the Goldstar Shirt to protect his vital points.\u201d A rare smile appeared on Yichuan\u2019s face.\u201cNing really is trying very hard.\u201d Snow was growing nervous as she watched.Her son\u2019s body was covered in bloodstains. As his mother, how could she not worry?\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Ning has still covered his body\u2019s vital points with the Goldstar Shirt. Even if he is wounded, it won\u2019t be life-threatening.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cAt most, he might lose an arm or a leg\u2026but given his regenerative abilities, with a little bit of time, he\u2019ll grow another one.\u201d\u201cLose an arm or a leg?\u201d Snow couldn\u2019t help but grow frantic, but she knew how difficult the road to becoming an expert had to be.\u2026.\u201cHu!\u201d \u201cHu!\u201d \u201cHu!\u201d Although Ning had the body of a Fiendgod, right now, he couldn\u2019t help but pant for breath. The fur clothes on his body was already ripped apart in many areas, and the wound on his body was rapidly closing.\u201cRoaaaar.\u201dThe Moonwolf let out a despairing growl. It was forcing itself to stand erect, but its two paws were both quivering, as though it could collapse at any time. Its body was covered with dozens of giant wounds, and a particularly vicious pierce-wound was in its head.Both of its legs had been shattered. It was already quite an impressive feat for it to be able to remain standing.\u201cYou lose.\u201d Ning wiped the blood from the corner of his eyes, then said in a quiet voice, \u201cMy power is actually greater than yours, but my victory was quite a difficult one\u2026the reason is because when faced with your bloodlust and your wildness, I was unable to be calm and bring out my full power. You are the first monster that I have ever killed, and thus, I will let you die under my greatest attack!\u201dHua! A second sword appeared out of nowhere in Ning\u2019s left hand. Holding the twin swords, he stared at the Moonwolf.Swoosh!Ning suddenly transformed into a blur as he threw himself at the Moonwolf. The Howling Moonwolf let out a final howl as it threw itself at Ning as well.Two massive flashes of light suddenly appeared, destroying one of the Moonwolf\u2019s remaining good legs, and then, with another flash, a massive criss-cross wound appeared on the Howling Moonwolf\u2019s head, sending blood and brain matter flying everywhere.Ning landed on the ground.The Howling Moonwolf collapsed on the ground, brain matter tumbling out of the massive wound on its head. Its fur was stained with the color of the earth, and its formerly beautiful silver fur had became a stained combination of mud and blood, unsightly to the extreme. A descendant of the Fiendgods of the wolf lineage had died!\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Yichuan looked down at his son.\u201cI feel great.\u201d Ning looked up at his father, his eyes filled with ardor. \u201cLet\u2019s do this once a day.\u201dYichuan\u2019s eyelids twitched. He muttered, \u201cDo you think capturing a peak Houtian level Godbeast is easy? Once every three days. And, most will be ordinary monstrous beasts. If you want to Godbeast, it\u2019ll be a matter of luck. I\u2019ll arrange for the most powerful monstrous beasts here in Dragon Castle to be reserved for your training.\u201dNing nodded. \u201cIf I meet some weaker monstrous beasts, I\u2019ll just rely on my internal force only.\u201dGiven the power of a Fiendgod\u2019s body, your ordinary peak Houtian monstrous beasts would be brutalized by brute force alone. This was why only Godbeasts with Fiendgod heritage in their blood could fight against Ning.\u2026.Time passed by.Ning fought with one monstrous beast after another, and his sword technique and footwork grew more exquisite. At the same time, he learned how to better maintain his calm in life-and-death battles. If his heart was not calm\u2026then his power wouldn\u2019t be able to be displayed to perfection.\u2026.Autumn had come. Swallow Mountain had become incomparably cold, and some weak tribes had their lives become even more difficult. Especially when they were met with the savage attacks of some monsters from deep in the mountains\u2026some smaller tribes might be exterminated!Honghonghong\u2026.The earth was shaking.Atop this barren, desolate wasteland, a large group of black armored riders were riding their long-furred beasts. They seemed like a black flood which was charging across these plains.\u201cHalt.\u201d A cold command. Three hundred powerful black armored riders instantly came to a halt.\u201cCommander, this place is the location where that serpent monster appeared last. This is the territory of the Sharphorn Tribe. Three days ago, the monster suddenly charged at the Sharphorn Tribe and devoured eighteen people, then killed over a hundred. The Sharphorn Tribe was totally destroyed.\u201d A black armored rider said respectfully. \u201cThis creature has been an impending disaster for months. It has killed over a thousand people and devastated over ten tribes. However, all of those tribes were small ones. Logically speaking, it should be a peak-stage Houtian level monster with the lineage of the Fiendgods, or perhaps a Diremonster who has newly reached the Xiantian level.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHrm.\u201dThe bearded man who was riding a white tiger and wore red, fiery scale mail armor nodded. \u201cThis serpent monster has been causing wanton devastation within the area controlled by our Ji clan of the Western Prefecture. It deserves death. It has only appeared in this area\u2026all of you, divide into thirty small units and begin searching. Once you find it, immediately fire the signal arrow.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The three hundred black armored riders acknowledged in unison.Hua\u2026Soon, the three hundred mighty black armored riders divided into thirty small units which went searching in various directions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17 \u2013 Buying a WeaponTwo days later.Within a forest with thick foliage, a large number of black armored riders were surrounding a serpent monster.\u201cRoar\u2026\u201d This was a massive, blood-red serpent which glowed with silver light around its torso. Around its torso, it had two pairs of sinuous claws with four toes, and a pair of terrifying red serpentine eyes. However, right now, the giant snake had been totally covered by a giant net. No matter how much it struggled, it couldn\u2019t break loose.\u201cHahaha.\u201d The bearded man in red armor laughed loudly. \u201cStupid snake. You were caught alive by us so easily. You, go tie it up.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dInstantly, several dozen black armored knights cast one black chain after another, sending them flying towards the giant snake, quickly binding it up. The red serpent was tied up to securely that no matter how it contorted itself, it wasn\u2019t able to do anything. Soon, it had been completely wrapped up by metal chains and bound so securely it couldn\u2019t even open its mouth.\u201cCommander, where does this giant snake come from? Why does it have two claws?\u201d A nearby black armored rider was curious. No matter how long he had been pondering, he couldn\u2019t discern what type of Godbeast this was.The bearded man laughed. \u201cSerpent-type creatures are often intermingled in blood. I myself have seen over a hundred serpents with Fiendgod blood. Only, some bloodlines are very pure and therefore become famous and are named. A sort of mongrel mutant Godbeast like this has no name at all.\u201d\u201cThe young master needs some powerful Houtian level monstrous beasts to practice his sword on. This serpent monster would be a good choice.\u201d The bearded man weighed the snake with his gaze, then nodded in satisfaction. \u201cTake it back.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe black armored riders acknowledged respectfully.The commander of this regiment was a Xiantian-level lifeform belonging to the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture \u2013 the number one expert archer, Blindfish! Blindfish was still one of young master Ning\u2019s instructors, and without question in the Ji clan, he stood on the side of Ji Young and Ji Yichuan. In addition, Blindfish was quite proud of having taught Ning.The story of how young master Ning would use monstrous beasts to train his swordplay had spread quite some time ago.After all, for him to kill one every three days resulted in a large number of monstrous beasts being killed. These beasts were almost all brought back by the black armored riders, and so the news had quickly spread amongst the army.\u201cYoung master Ning reached the peak of the Houtian stage long ago, and his swordplay is at the advanced level of \u2018one with the sword\u2019. In addition, he is training in the most powerful sword technique of our Ji clan. Killing a peak Houtian monster should be a simple thing.\u201d\u201cSupposedly, he\u2019s even killed a Houtian level Godbeast.\u201d\u201cThink about who young master Ning is. He definitely has an extremely sharp, unblockable precious weapon. With a weapon like this, relying on his \u2018advanced\u2019 level sword techniques\u2026killing a peak Houtian level Godbeast isn\u2019t too hard.\u201dThe legends that were circulating amongst the soldiers of the West Prefecture were quite vivid and fanciful.Even the other powerful member of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, Ji Lee, believed that the little fellow Ning was only able to kill a Godbeast because he had some sort of precious weapon.Dragon Castle. The cage.A powerfully built monstrous beast with black spots was lying on the ground. The thick fur on his body had been split open in many places, and blood from those massive wounds stained the ground.Ning was still standing there, frowning as he was thinking. The sharp sword in his hand disappeared into thin air. When fighting with most peak Houtian monsters, he only used his internal energy, and the weapons he used were only fairly decent weapons which couldn\u2019t be described as \u2018precious\u2019. After all, he was already so physically strong that using a precious weapon on top of that would make the training pointless.\u201cJi Ning!\u201d A voice from above.Ning couldn\u2019t help but look up at his father, Yichuan, who was on the viewing platform. This made Ning quite surprised. \u201cFather, why have you come?\u201dBecause he fought every three days here in the Dragon Castle, aside from that first fight with the Howling Moonwolf, the subsequent dozens of battles, his father had not attended\u2026\u201cI wanted to see how your swordplay was progressing.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cHave you reached \u2018initiation\u2019 yet?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d Ning shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t gained expertise in any of the many attacks contained within the [Raindrop Sutra] or the [Thunderflame Sword].\u201dThe [Raindrop Sutra] had a total of nine attack techniques.The [Thunderflame Sword] had a total of three attack techniques.These attack techniques were all very special\u2026if one could train in them to a high level, one would feel as though one had become \u2018one with the world\u2019 and be able to use the power of the world itself. This was what was known as \u2018initiation\u2019. But this didn\u2019t actually symbolize that a person had reached the third level of swordplay, \u2018one with the world\u2019, because the true \u2018one with the world\u2019 level of swordplay was when one could use any sword attack, be it as something as simple as a stab, a chop, or a scrape, and utilize the power of the world itself with the attack. Only then would one be at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level!Initiation only meant that one could temporarily reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 effect when using certain techniques.According to what his father had said\u2026Upon reaching \u2018initiation\u2019, one would have reached a certain level of expertise in a technique.When one reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level, that means one had mastered a technique.According to legends\u2026There was an even higher, more profound level above the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level. The [Raindrop Sutra] and the [Thunderflame Sword] techniques were developed by people who were beyond the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level.\u201cThere is no need for you to be so continuously hard working while training in the sword.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cToday, take Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf and go for a stroll.\u201dNing nodded. \u201cYes, father.\u201dNing turned his head and left through that narrow tunnel. As for the corpse of the dead monstrous beast, someone would come collect it later.\u2026..West Prefecture City had hundreds of thousands of citizens. It was a large city.\u201cYoung master, it\u2019s been so long since we\u2019ve gone for a stroll.\u201d Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf, his two female servants, were clearly very happy as they followed by his side.Ning smiled as he walked on the streets. This was one of the most bustling streets in the entire West Prefecture City. Generally speaking, all the merchants would pass by this street. The street was normally ten meters wide, but there were so many merchant stalls on each side that nearly half the space was taken up, causing there to only be seven meters of walking space left.\u201cLook at this woman. Look at her ample chest, her large buttocks. She can definitely birth many babies. Ten lambskins for her!\u201d\u201cThese men are all fine warriors. They can all lift over a thousand pounds. Just five ingots of gold. If you buy one, we\u2019ll throw in a kid as well.\u201dA bald man dressed in beast furs was shouting at the top of his lungs. He had several dozen fur-clad warriors standing guard around him, while he also had many slaves dressed in dirty, tattered fur pelts. All of them stared pitifully around them, hoping that they would meet a kind master who would buy them. There were signs on their heads.These signs signified that they were for sale.\u2026.They strolled and looked around.There were slave traders, beast fur traders, weapon traders, beast traders, monstrous beast traders\u2026all sorts of people were here. There were even some precious books, precious weapons, poisons and herbs, secret technique manuals, and other things for sale.\u201cOver a hundred warriors in our tribe died for us to acquire this precious weapon, and then we had to make our way back through the wilderness and encounter countless difficulties before we arrived at the West Prefecture City. We weren\u2019t even willing to sell it for thirty beastheads of gold, but you want to try and buy it for ten? That\u2019s too little. At least a hundred beastheads of gold!\u201d A rough-voiced man was shouting from nearby.Ning glanced over in curiosity.He saw around dozens of people in a circle surrounding three strong men wearing pitch-black furs, one of whom had a black snake coiled around his arm. The man continued: \u201cA hundred beastheads of gold, whoever pays a hundred beastheads can take it away!\u201d\u201cHow greedy.\u201d\u201cHe actually dares to demand a hundred beastheads of gold.\u201d Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf both murmured.Ning was surprised as well. A beasthead of gold was around ten pounds. A hundred beastheads meant a thousand pounds of gold. Although to the young master of the Ji clan, it was nothing, to an ordinary tribesman, it was a vast fortune.\u201d\u201cNo matter how sharp it is, it\u2019s just a weapon.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t as though it is some perfect magic treasure. It\u2019s just a damaged magic treasure that can be used as a weapon.\u201d\u201cTwenty beastheads. I\u2019ll pay twenty beastheads at most. You want to sell, and I want to buy!\u201dSomeone made an offer.\u201cA hundred beastheads.\u201d The man didn\u2019t budge at all. The two men by his side watched the crowd carefully, afraid that someone might try to seize their treasure. For the sake of this treasure, many people in their tribe had died, and as they made their way from the tribe to the city through the desolate wilderness, dozens more warriors had died. They had to sell this treasure for a high price.After selling it, they would be able to buy some slaves and some good weapons, so as to allow the tribe to increase its power.\u201cLet me take a look.\u201d Ning saw the precious weapon which the man was clutching and immediately stepped forward.The people nearby all turned to look at him.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cThis is the young master of the Ji clan? The son of the Raindrop Sword?\u201dMany people stepped back modestly. Anyone capable of paying such a high price was an extraordinary person. In addition, in the past few years, Ning had gone every day with the Whitewater Hound outside the city to train in archery. Each time they left the city, many people saw and recognized him as the exalted young master of the Ji clan. The other people who didn\u2019t recognize him, upon hearing others discuss him, were made aware as well.When the man with the black snake saw everyone else step back, then heard the words \u2018young master of the Ji clan\u2019 and \u2018son of the Raindrop Sword\u2019, he was instantly so frightened that his heart began to shake. As people who lived on the territory of the Ji clan, they all knew the legendary Raindrop Sword. This was the number one expert in the entire area around the Ji clan\u2019s West Prefecture, a godlike presence.And the person in front of him was the only child of the Raindrop Sword?\u201cLet me take a look.\u201d Ning said.\u201cHonored young master, please look.\u201d The man respectfully offered the sword in both hands. The two men behind him both felt extremely nervous. They were afraid that this young master who had an extremely high and exalted status would simply take their treasure by force. In the tribes, for a powerful person or person with high status to seize treasures by force was quite common. Although it was forbidden in the West Prefecture City and nobody dared to challenge the laws of the Ji clan, the young man in front of them was a young master of the Ji clan, the only son of the Raindrop Sword!Ning accepted the sword, and his hands sank down slightly from the weight. This was a pitch-black sword. The thick black sheath seemed very plain and unadorned, but if one looked at it closely, one would find that this scabbard actually had three swords sheathed within it.\u201cOne scabbard, three swords?\u201d Surprised, Ning pulled out the swords.Clang!While pulling out the three swords, a cold light flashed on the surface of the swords, and ancient, shattered runes glowed dimly.\u201cWhat a pity.\u201d Ning shook his head and sighed. He had seen many treasures in the prefecture. Seeing those mysterious runes and the power they emanated, he knew that this was previously a magic treasure. It should have been three flying swords which were controlled by a Immortal practitioner. But these runes were all but destroyed. Clearly, this magic treasure was badly damaged. It could only be used as a weapon now.\u201d\u201cChi.\u201d Ning tested his finger against the blade of the sword.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCareful. It is very sharp.\u201d The man with the serpent called out in alarm. This precious weapon could cut through stones like tofu.\u201dNing felt the skin of his fingertips shake slightly. He couldn\u2019t help but feel surprise. \u201cI have the Goldstar Shirt protecting my body, which is currently spread to every inch of my skin. Just then, when I casually sliced my finger\u2026it actually impacted the Goldstar Shirt. If I were to swing the sword down hard, it probably would have broken through the Goldstar Shirt\u2019s defense. I walk through the city streets every day on my way to archery training and have seen countless weapons, but I\u2019ve never seen such a sharp, precious weapon.\u201dOthers only sensed that this weapon was very sharp, but they didn\u2019t know exactly how sharp it was. But Ning had the feeling\u2026that even his Goldstar Shirt would find it hard to block this precious weapon.\u201cI want this weapon.\u201d Ning looked at the man with the snake.The man was both excited and nervous. He hurriedly said, \u201cYoung master, for the sake of this weapon, our tribe\u2026\u201d In front of this young man of exalted status, he was nervous and didn\u2019t dare to demand a certain price.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He tossed it directly towards the man with the black serpent. \u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cJust this little tiny piece of gold?\u201d The man with the black serpent and the two behind him were frantic. They stared at that tiny bit of blue-tinged gold, just the size of a finger. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t even pure?\u201d\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cRespected young master.\u201dThe three men began to call out and beg. How could they possibly return to the tribes with this? The other tribal warriors were outside the city waiting. None of them were willing to enter the city\u2026because the cost of entering the city was a lambskin or some other equivalent value item.\u201cYou pack of idiots. That is thundergold!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m willing to pay a hundred beastheads of gold for that piece of thundergold.\u201d\u201cJust a hundred beastheads? A piece of thundergold of that size, I\u2019d pay 160 beastheads! I can send someone to bring the beastheads of gold right now!\u201d Instantly, the nearby people began to make offers. All of them were people of some status in the West Prefecture City, or came from the clans with Xiantian lifeforms in them, or perhaps belonged to the powerful tribes that were located close to the West Prefecture. How excellent their judgment must therefore be!The man with the black snake hurriedly clutched the piece of thundergold. He clearly felt that the weight of this item was far beyond that of normal yellow gold. He exchanged glances with his two friends, both shocked and overjoyed.\u201cThank you, young master.\u201d\u201cThank you, mighty young master.\u201dThe three men instantly thanked him, filled with gratitude.\u201cNow you thank him? The Raindrop Sword is a major figure whose fame is known everywhere. Think about what sort of status his son has. How could he possibly take your weapon by force? Just the tiniest portion of his fortune that he could casually toss out would astonish you.\u201d A fat, fur-clad old man next to them said in a loud voice. Clearly, these words were intentionally said for the not too distant Ning to hear.Ning chuckled, and then casually made the sheath with the three swords disappear into his kalestone. Because the space inside the kalestone was limited, thus Ning only carried a few beastheads of gold with him. Everything else he had was all precious treasures.\u2026..Within the hall.Ji Yichuan was seated at the master\u2019s seat, while Yuchi Snow sat on his left. The two were slowly eating the food on the table in front of them.Swoosh!A human figure rushed in. It was Ning, who had finished his stroll.\u201cFather, mother.\u201d Ning said hurriedly.Yichuan frowned. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you pay attention to the time when you were taking a stroll outside?\u201dNing obediently didn\u2019t dare to make a sound, hurriedly running to his usual spot, sitting on his knees and beginning to eat. Their lunch was rather sumptuous, with all sorts of meats, bread, and wine on the table. Ning\u2019s current appetite was simply voracious, and virtually all of the food and beverages on the table were devoured by Ning in a short period of time.Snow laughed as she watched her son tear through the food like a tornado.\u201cFather, mother.\u201d Ning suddenly thought of the sheath and three swords he had purchased today. He hurriedly said, \u201cToday, while taking the walk, I ran into three tribal warriors. They should have come from a distant, impoverished place to the Western Prefecture City. They came for the purpose of selling a precious weapon. And I\u2026decided to buy it.\u201d\u201cPrecious weapon?\u201d The seated Yichuan frowned. \u201cIn the treasure warehouse of our Ji clan here in the West Prefecture, we have plenty of precious weapons. In the past, didn\u2019t you already select two precious weapons? How can those lowly peddlers in the city possibly have anything good.\u201dBecause Ning had yet to read the Xiantian level in Ki Refining, he naturally couldn\u2019t control any magic treasures yet, which is why he went to the treasure warehouse to pick out two precious swords. But of course, when training in the cage, he only used ordinary weapons.\u201cFather, the two precious weapons I selected in the warehouse are far inferior to this one I just bought.\u201d Ning said seriously.\u201cOh?\u201d Yichuan looked at his son.\u201cActually, the precious weapon I bought is a damaged sword-type magic treasure.\u201d Ning explained. \u201cThere are occult runes carved onto it, but they are totally damaged. Therefore, it can only be used as a fairly sharp precious weapon. However, it really is sharp, far more so than the previous precious weapons in my residence. If I use some force, I can pierce through the Goldstar Shirt.\u201d\u201cPierce through the Goldstar Shirt?\u201d Yichuan revealed a hint of surprise. \u201cLet me take a look.\u201dNing stretched his hand out, and that simple, unadorned sheath and three swords appeared within it. Standing up, he walked it over to his father.Yichuan accepted it and took a close look at the sheath, then pulled out the three swords. \u201cThe magic runes on the swords are totally destroyed, but it feels as though\u2026this is indeed a flying sword magic treasure! Unfortunately, it\u2019s a damaged magic treasure. Most damaged magic treasures aren\u2019t worth much. At most, they might be sold to be broken down into some other materials.\u201dNing nodded.He had read many books, and knew that damaged magic treasures were not worth much, because the material components of magic treasures had already undergone various fusing techniques, making it so that even if one broke down the magic treasure, one wouldn\u2019t be able to get many of the original components back.\u201cChi!\u201d Yichuan stroked the tip of the sword with his finger, and a hint of blood appeared on his fingertip. A look of shock appeared on his face. \u201cWhat a sharp sword. Without any energy infused into it, the sword is still so incredibly sharp. I\u2019ve never seen such a thing. Snow, come take a look. Can you tell where it comes from?\u201dYuchi Snow accepted it and carefully looked it over, then slowly shook her head after a long time. \u201cI can\u2019t tell.\u201d\u201cMother, if this magic flying sword treasure wasn\u2019t damaged, would it be a \u2018ranked\u2019 treasure?\u201d Ning hurriedly asked.\u201cOf course it would be a \u2018ranked\u2019 treasure.\u201d Snow nodded. \u201cEven though it is damaged, the sharpness of this sword is still on par with some \u2018unranked\u2019 magic treasures. When it was undamaged\u2026of course it was a \u2018ranked\u2019 treasure. Only, exactly what rank it was at, I can\u2019t tell at all. Perhaps no one in the entire area around Swallow Mountain can tell.\u201dNing nodded. He understood this.Generally speaking, the magic treasures owned by a Xiantian level Ki Refiner was \u2018unranked\u2019. Only Zifu Disciples and above would have \u2018ranked\u2019 magic treasures. Forging magic treasures\u2026that was even harder. There was nobody in the entire Swallow Mountain area who was known to be able to forge magic treasures. Perhaps only in those distant, incomparably powerful tribes would there be an expert capable of forging magic treasures.\u201cThe Grand Xia Dynasty has persisted from the Fiendgod Era until now.\u201d Yichuan returned the sheath and the three swords to his son. \u201cIt rules over countless territories, with a history of trillions of years. Who knows how many tribes have risen, fallen, or been exterminated, and how many treasures they have left behind. It isn\u2019t rare to see some magic treasures left over from wars, and our Ji clan has hundreds of damaged magic treasures as well, most of which are of unknown origin. But for this damaged magic treasure to still be so incredibly sharp is quite rare. It is very suited for your use.\u201dSnow then added, \u201cNing, in the future, when you reach the Xiantian level as a Ki Refiner and infuse your life energy into an \u2018unranked\u2019 magic treasure\u2026its power still might be inferior to these swords!\u201dNing nodded.Magic treasures could be unfathomably profound.Generally speaking, when Ki Refiners used magic treasures, they were capable of thousands of bizarre powers. But for Fiendgod Body Refiners\u2026they still specialized in close combat. They had a virtually indestructible body, great strength, speed, and regenerative abilities, which is why even when using magic treasures, Fiendgod Body Refiners would generally use weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, and what not.\u201cThis sheath and its three sword will still be useful to me, even after I become a Xiantian lifeform.\u201d Ning felt delighted. He pondered, \u201cSince it will most likely be with me for a long time, I need to give it a name\u2026Hrm. I\u2019ll call it the \u2018Darknorth sword!\u2019\u201dThere was a reason why Ning had suddenly thought of \u2018Darknorth\u2019.In the past, when his father, Ji Yichuan, had left Swallow Mountain and roamed in the boundless wide world, he had even gone to the north, to the unending ocean. That massive sea was named as the \u2018Dark North Sea\u2019. Within the Dark North Sea, there were many islands. Ji Yichuan had floated from one island to another, and that\u2019s where he had met Yuchi Snow.They became travel companions, and then after experiencing life and death battles, fell in love with each other, then Snow became pregnant.Because of the pregnancy\u2026they finally left the dangerous Dark North Sea and returned to Swallow Mountain. Mid-journey, however, they had run into a dangerous situation and Yuchi Snow had suffered a serious wound. This is why they had said that \u2018Ning suffered an injury in the womb\u2019. At that critical time, the Godbeast, \u2018Whitewater Hound\u2019, had carried Snow on his back and fled.This was why Yichuan often said that Uncle White had once saved Ning.His parents had met, fell in love, then conceived him in the Dark North Sea.The phrase, \u2018Darknorth\u2019, thus had a special meaning to Ning.\u201cFather. Mother.\u201d Ning said seriously. \u201cI have given a name to this sheath and its three swords. Its name will be the Darknorth swords!\u201d\u2026\u2026At the same time Ning acquired the Darknorth swords. In an area within Swallow Mountain known as Serpentwing Lake\u2026.Serpentwing Lake was a massive lake, nearly a hundred kilometers long, so large that one wouldn\u2019t be able to see the end of it.As the saying goes, deep mountains and massive lakes always have monsters within.These words were not false! This massive, mysterious lake, without question, has Diremonsters within it, and countless numbers of lesser monsters. The name of the Diremonster within this lake was Serpentwing. It was an ancient monster, over a thousand years old, and possessed outlandishly strong power. It was born capable of flight, and it could control both water and poison. It was a very ferocious, awe-inspiring Diremonster.Deep in the center of the lake, there was a small island. This was the lair of Serpentwing.\u201cBoom\u2026\u201d A giant black coiled serpent, hundreds of meters long. Its two massive scaled wings were spread so wide, it seemed to encompass the skies. Its scarlet eyes were focused on a group of quivering monstrous beasts. A cold aura surrounded the place, and a layer of frost was on the ground.The densely clustered lesser monsters were all on their knees or on their faces, all of them quivering.Over a hundred monstrous beasts lay fallen on the ground, their bodies covered with frost. They had been frozen solid.\u201cBoom\u2026\u201d The furious Serpentwing let out an enraged roar.Those lesser monsters consisted of all sorts of serpent, crab, and fish-type monsters. They all growled softly in reply. Clearly, they were all incomparably terrified.\u201cROAR!\u201d Serpentwing snarled coldly.Huahuahua\u2026.All the monsters retreated at high speed, as though relieved of a heavy burden. Many of the monsters left the island and entered the depths of the lake, while a portion of them took up defensive positions in various places around the island.\u201cShua.\u201d The giant black snake suddenly transformed into mist, and then it reformed into a black-clothed man.\u201cI, Serpentwing, had ninety two sons!\u201d The black-clothed man ground his teeth. \u201cWhile they grew up, the majority died, and only sixteen survived! And only one of them has the lineage of the Fiendgods\u2026my most beloved son, Redtip!\u201dSnakes were lascivious by nature.Although he himself did not have the lineage of the Fiendgods, he had copulated with many Houtian monsters, some of whom included Houtian stage Godbeasts. To an ancient monster who had trained for over a thousand years\u2026it was fairly easy for him to meet and engage with some Houtian level Godbeasts. But Godbeasts rarely got pregnant, and thus only a single one of his children had the lineage of the Fiendgods. That one was Redtip.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHis most beloved child. He was certain that so long as Redtip could become a Xiantian lifeform, he would definitely possess enormous power and limitless prospects.\u201cRedtip, I told you long ago not to go out before reaching the Xiantian level. Although humans are delicious, if you eat too many of them, the Ji clan would come and deal with you.\u201d The black-robed man growled, filled with misery.His pride and his joy, his son Redtip, had snuck out and discovered that the taste of human flesh was far better than that of other monstrous beasts. Human flesh truly was delicious.And thus, Redtip had gone behind his father\u2019s back and snuck out time and time again to engage in slaughter.\u201cMy child. I have to bring you back.\u201d The black-clothed man instantly transformed back into the enormous winged serpent form. His massive body floated into the air, and then he transformed into a black shadow, streaking across the sky and disappearing into the clouds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These fences were six meters tall and linked together tightly. Beast swarms definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to charge inside past them. Within the massive wooden fences, there were stone houses, wooden houses, and large numbers of fur-clad men, women, children, and elderly people living their lives here.This was a very ordinary tribe with several thousand tribesmen.\u201cMy child was captured within these few dozen kilometers!\u201d The black-robed man walked within a mountain forest, heading towards the massive tribal gate. \u201cAnd this is the tribe nearest the place he was taken from.\u201d\u201cHalt.\u201d\u201cHalt.\u201dThe main gate to the tribe was shut, and on each side there were two archer towers. Each archer tower had five powerful, beast-clad warriors within. All of them had their bows drawn and nocked, and they aimed at the distant, black-clothed man who was drawing near.\u201cOutsider, state your intentions.\u201d A warrior atop the archer tower said angrily.The black-robed man glanced at him sideways, as though looking at an ant. His footsteps didn\u2019t stop, and he continued towards the gate.The ten warriors on the archer tower all grew angry\u2026\u201cKill him!\u201d Instantly, ten greatbows shot out at the same time! Beng! Beng! Beng! One arrow after another screamed through the air at the black-clothed man, each of them containing enough force to shatter boulders or make large trees collapse. But when these ten arrows drew near the black-clothed men, they all went, zizizi\u2026.The shafts of the arrows cracked, then disintegrated.The man continued to walk forward.\u201cNot good.\u201d The ten warriors on the archer tower were alarmed, and one of them grabbed his oxhorn and gave it a mighty blow!\u201cWu, wu, wu!\u201d The deep sound from the horn was powerful and penetrative. It quickly spread to the entire tribe, and the men, women, children, and elders of the tribe all grabbed their weapons while assembling. In order to survive in this world\u2026men, women, children, and elders all had to act as battle-hardened warriors.When the tribesmen assembled and began to roar and charge towards the door\u2026.Shua!That incomparably thick black ironwood gate suddenly exploded, transforming into countless pieces of splinters that flew away. Every single splinter was more terrifying than the arrows of the tribe\u2019s archers, and in the blink of an eye, dozens of warriors located close to the door all died or were maimed. Blood stained the ground, but the warriors weren\u2019t afraid at all. Instead, they charged forward with even more furious howls.\u201cHold!\u201d A shout rang out.A white haired old man dressed in beast fur transformed into a blur as he charged towards the empty ground in front of the door.The enraged tribal warriors came to a halt as they looked at the white-haired old man who wore a grey beast pelt. This old man was the leader of the tribe.\u201cMighty hero, might I ask, what can our Goldblade Tribe do to assist you?\u201d The white-haired old man bowed respectfully. Someone capable of shattering their gate just through releasing his internal energy was, without a question, a Xiantian lifeform, and Xiantian lifeforms, even amongst the local hegemon, the Ji clan, were people with extremely exalted statuses.At this moment, the black-clothed man leisurely strolled in.\u201cI ask you.\u201d The black-clothed man looked at the white-haired elder. \u201cHave there been any serpent monsters in the area recently?\u201d\u201cSerpent monsters?\u201d The white-haired old man paused, then hurriedly nodded. \u201cThere are. Recently, a serpent monster appeared, and many small tribes were devastated by it. The week following that, the tribes sent the news to the Ji clan\u2026and the Ji clan sent their black armored riders to resolve with that calamitous snake monster.\u201dThe black-clothed man\u2019s narrow eyes flashed with cold light.So it was indeed the Ji clan!The Ji clan was a powerful organization in this area. Even an ancient monster like him didn\u2019t want to go bother it. He had previously guessed that it must have been the Ji clan which had captured his son Redtip, and now it seemed this was indeed the case.\u201cKilled or captured?\u201d The black-clothed man continued to ask.\u201cTaken alive.\u201d The white-haired old man said. \u201cThe Ji clan sent their black armored riders, who captured the snake monster alive, then went back. Most likely, it is currently in West Prefecture City!\u201d\u201cWest Prefecture City?\u201d The black-clothed man\u2019s eyes had a hint of fire hidden within them. The fire of rage.West Prefecture City, to Diremonsters, was the most dangerous place possible.That was where the experts of the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture gathered! Diremonsters didn\u2019t dare go there. If his child was there\u2026the chance of him being able to rescue his child and bring him back was very, very low.\u201cHuman.\u201d The black-clothed man looked at the white-haired elder. His voice was cold. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201dWhen the white-haired elder heard himself be addressed as \u2018human\u2019, his face instantly changed.Monster!And it was a terrifying Diremonster who could take human form!\u201cHuhuhu\u2026\u201d The temperature suddenly dropped, and a vast layer of frost began to appear. Even plumes of snow began to drift down. The terrifying low temperature began to spread, and the surrounding tribal warriors quickly were frozen into ice, then shattered into small pieces.\u201cQuick, leave!\u201d The white-haired old man\u2019s hair and eyebrows had a layer of ice form over them, and the tribesmen behind him roared, \u201cA Diremonster! Flee, flee!\u201d\u201cQuick.\u201d\u201cFlee.\u201dAll of the tribesmen gritted their teeth, enduring their pain and rage as they began to flee. Many other tribal warriors shouted heroically as they charged towards the black-clothed man like maddened demons, but when they got near him\u2026the layer of frost on their bodies grew thicker, and then they quickly turned into ice statues.The old man\u2019s internal energy was valiantly fighting. He howled out stutteringly, \u201cYou dare provoke the mighty Ji clan?\u201d\u201cProvoke?\u201d The black-clothed man\u2019s pitch-black long hair fluttered in the air. His eyes flashed with a scarlet red light. \u201cThe snake monster was my child, my most beloved child. I\u2019m not only going to provoke them, I\u2019m also going to break into the West Prefecture City!\u201d\u201cRoaaaar!\u201dA world-shaking furious howl.The black-clothed man transformed into a coiled serpent, an enormous black serpent which howevered in mid-air. The enormous scaled wings of the coiled serpent fully extended, like a massive net which blocked the sun off from the tribesmen. The tribesmen who had scattered in each direction raised their head and saw this terrifying sight, and all of them were filled with utter terror.\u201cIt\u2019s Serpentwing!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Diremonster of Serpentwing Lake!\u201dNot a single tribal warrior now had the thought of fighting back. Ever since they were born, they had heard the ancient legends of the \u2018Diremonster of Serpentwing Lake\u2019. They knew how terrifying Serpentwing was. There was no way their Goldblade Clan could fight against this sort of terrifying Diremonster!\u201cAll die!\u201d\u201cAll of you must die!\u201dThe enormous Serpentwing enveloped the area below with its massive wings, bloodlust in its scarlet red eyes. It suddenly opened its massive maw and breathed. Huuuuuu. An endless, freezing black wind arose, so strong that even a layer of the ground was stripped off, and some stone houses collapsed. The large amount of black wind quickly surrounded the entire area for nearly ten kilometers around.\u201cCough, cough.\u201d The tribesmen all held their throats, their bodies quickly turning pitch black.\u201cNo.\u201d A woman held her child, tears running down her face like a river.\u201cDiremonster, the Ji clan will definitely avenge us!\u201d A powerful warrior who had reached the peak of power in internal energy stopped his own breathing, but the poisonous gas stilled penetrated through his skin. In the last moment of his life, all he could do was let out this bitter shout.Soon\u2026.The territory of the Goldblade Tribe turned into a desolate, silent wasteland. Not a hint of life or sound. All of the tribesmen of the Goldblade Tribe had been turned to ice statues, shattered into pieces, or poisoned to death. The entire area for ten kilometers around\u2026had turned into a charnel house. Even poisonous bug-type creatures had been poisoned to death.The enormous Serpentwing gently flapped its wings as it stared below. After sensing that all life was gone, it casually flew away at high speed, disappearing into the sky.\u2026..Night descended. A cold wind blew drearily. The distant, massive West Prefecture City stretched off into the distance.\u201cSwoosh!\u201d A black shadow easily flashed past the walls, avoiding the patrolling black armored riders and stealthily entering the city.\u201cMy child, where are you?\u201dThe black-clothed man began to search within West Prefecture City.This was the first time the Diremonster, Serpentwing, had entered West Prefecture City. After investigating for a long time, he discovered, to his pain, \u201cMonsters that are taken alive are all delivered to the inner city. And the inner city is the place where the Ji clan lives. It is guarded very tightly. There are many Xiantian lifeforms living there\u2026there is no way I can sneak in.\u201dSneaking into West Prefecture City was fairly easy.Sneaking into the inner city?That was the place where the clan members of the Ji clan lived. How exceedingly tight did the security of such a place have to be?\u201cHu!\u201dA moment later.In the air above the West Prefecture City, Serpentwing flew high into the sky while at the same time, using its natural-born ability to control water, it quickly created a large amount of fog and clouds with the moisture in the air. The fog surrounded the nearby area, and he secretly stared down below from the skies, carefully watching every single place.Past midnight.Ning was by himself in Dragon Castle. Today was the day for his once every three days cage battle.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cYoung master.\u201dThe black armored riders and some servants of Dragon castle were all extremely respectful to him.Ning\u2019s father was the number one expert of the Ji clan! And Ning himself was extremely talented, so many people had already begun to believe\u2026Ning would be the next Prefecture Lord. One could imagine how exalted his status was.\u201cPrepare the most formidable monster.\u201d Ning laughed and called out.\u201cRecently, we had a powerful monster delivered here. It was brought to us by Commander Blindfish. It has the lineage of the Fiendgods.\u201d A one-armed old man called out loudly.\u201cA monster with Fiendgod lineage?\u201d Ning revealed a hint of delight on his face. \u201cExcellent. Today I\u2019ll be able to have a fun fight then. Quick, arrange for it to be sent to the cage.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThe one-armed old man went to make the arrangements.Dragon Castle was divided into the cage and the beast tunnels. Naturally, the beast tunnels was where the monsters lived, all of which were kept in captivity here.\u201cRoaaar!\u201d The massive red serpent wrapped up in chains, upon seeing the human in the massive cage outside, let out a deep, angry growl.\u201cKeep shouting.\u201d The one-armed old man sneered coldly. \u201cYou ate so many humans. Today is the day of your death. Go. Open the door, and then release the chains\u2026let it enter the cage.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe servants who had been installed here for the purposes of taking care of the monsters went to make the arrangements.\u201cRumble.\u201d After opening the gate between the cage and the beast tunnels, a faint, glimmering light could be seen from afar. The giant red snake instantly looked over and began to let out a growling sound.\u201cRelease the chains.\u201d The one-armed elder ordered.\u201cClank.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cClank.\u201dOne chain after another was released. Feeling the layers of chains on its body quickly loosen, the giant red snake couldn\u2019t help but begin to wriggle, making the chains rattle against each other. After the last one was released\u2026with a clanking sound, the entire chain apparatus fell to the floor with a loud sound.The giant red snake stared coldly at the one-armed elder, and then slithered its way at high speed out of the tunnel towards the place which had just been opened to it. It quickly arrived in the cage outside.Within the enormous cage\u2026A red-lipped, white-toothed, fur-clad young man was staring at it from afar. The giant red snake\u2019s saliva instantly began to drool out. Given the extensive man-eating experience it had, it had the sudden knowledge\u2026that this sort of human youngster\u2019s flesh was definitely the most tender and most delicious of them all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Its enormous serpentine head raised high as it stared at Ning. Its natural-born arrogance caused it to hold the human youth in front of it in no regard at all. According to its experience, those people in the tribes like this youth were all very weak. Even though this was the lair of the Ji clan, this sort of youth shouldn\u2019t be that strong.Ning let out a light harrumph.The air in his chest came out as he breathed, shaping into two streams of energy that were visible to the naked eye. His entire body turned slightly red, and a powerful aura began to emanate from him. The distant giant red snake was startled. He could suddenly sense this young man in front of him had a terrifying aura that was no weaker than its own.\u201cRecently, I haven\u2019t had a lot of practice with the [Raindrop Sutra]. I\u2019ll use you to train it.\u201d Ning suddenly moved forward by several dozen meters, the sharp sword in his hand stabbing out at the giant scarlet snake at lightning speed.The giant scarlet snake sent its two massive sharp claws at its thorax directly towards Ning in an arcing slash.\u201cShua! Shua! Shua!\u201d Sword flashing hundreds of times like a fog of light, one stab after another was delivered towards the giant red snake. The giant red snake only dodged three sword attacks aimed at its vitals, taking the rest of the attacks head on. Only a few white spots appeared on its scales. This caused the giant red snake to unconsciously underestimate the strength of this young human by a bit.\u201cWu\u2026..\u201dA strange rumble sound. It was the sound of Ning\u2019s sharp sword slashing through the air, instantly slashing towards the giant red snake\u2019s chest, suddenly creating a two meter long massive wound. The scales split open, and the muscles beneath were torn apart, and fresh red blood instantly spewed out.\u201cRoaaar!\u201d The giant red snake was instantly shocked. How was it that the youth in front of him had suddenly become so powerful?\u2026..Ning was no longer the callow youth who had battled against the Howling Moonwolf. His constant battles against monstrous beasts had given him much experience. Right now, he was actually only using half of his strength, but because the [Shadewind Steps] and the [Raindrop Sutra] all were quite exquisite in the application of force, he still wasn\u2019t at any disadvantage.First, Ning utilized a chain of attacks, \u2018Drizzling Rain\u2019, but against this giant red snake, it proved useless.Then, Ning used the vicious, powerful killing attack, \u2018Rain Line\u2019, which was the technique Ning used to leave that massive, large wound on the giant red snake.Next, Ning used the penetrating \u2018Raindrop Pierces Rocks\u2019 attack.Following that, Ning blocked the wild attacks of the giant red snake by using the technique, \u2018Thin Streams Flow Forever\u2019.The [Raindrop Sutra] had a total of nine stances.These stances were, \u2018Drizzling Rain\u2019, \u2018Tempest Curtain\u2019, \u2018Thin Streams Flow Forever\u2019, \u2018Watertight\u2019, \u2018Rain Line\u2019, \u2018Eternally Fresh Waterflow\u2019, \u2018Merciless Waterflow\u2019, and \u2018Raindrop Pierces Rocks\u2019!Some were attack stances, some were defensive stances.Even the attack stances, however, included defensive components. The profoundness of this technique constantly caused Ning to sigh in amazement and be mesmerized. After all, he hadn\u2019t even reached the level of \u2018expertise\u2019 in this technique, and although his own father, Yichuan, had reached the level of \u2018mastery\u2019 long ago, his father was still studying the [Raindrop Sutra], because the more one reflected on the [Raindrop Sutra], the more one realized how boundless its scope was.\u201cThis technique, \u2018Thin Unending Waterflow\u2019, should be an unrestrained, free-willed attack.\u201d Under the attacks of this monstrous beast with Fiendgod lineage, Ning occasionally had some insights with regards to his sword techniques.But the giant red snake, by contrast, was growing furious!It could tell that this human youth was using it to train in swordplay. Although there were many wounds on its body already, none of them were lethal. But the youth in front of him had only suffered a few light wounds\u2026which instantly healed in the blink of an eye. The youth in front of it was so terrifying that its heart quailed, while at the same time, it felt fear that it was going to die at the hands of this human youth.But even if it was going to die, its inborn arrogance and pride wouldn\u2019t allow it to be toyed with to death.\u201cRoaaaaar.\u201d The giant red snake suddenly let out a wild, earthshaking howl, filled with rage, unwillingness, and carried with it the knowledge of its death.\u2026..The howl split the air.In the air above the inner reaches of the Ji clan, there were many clouds. Within one of the clouds was the black Winged Snake.\u201cRoaaaar.\u201dBy the time this howl made it to the heavens, it was very weak, but Serpentwing was an extremely sensitive Diremonster. In addition, the roar was the familiar voice of its child.\u201cIt is Redtip! My son!\u201d Serpentwing was instantly certain of this. It had been searching around the inner city the entire time, and from kilometers away, its gaze had clearly made out the building known as the Cage. But because of the fog and because of all the steel chains above the cage, it simply couldn\u2019t tell what the Cage actually was.But just at that moment\u2026Upon hearing the sound, it immediately knew that the sound was coming from that cage area!\u201cThere it is!\u201d Serpentwing immediately charged down, its body still wrapped by clouds and fogs, shrouding it from view.\u2026.Within the cage.Ning, hearing the grief-stricken, enraged howl of the giant red snake, knew how the giant red snake was feeling. Immediately, a sharp sword appeared in his left hand as well. \u201cSince you beg for death, then die!\u201dShua!Ning suddenly transformed into a tempest and charged at the giant red snake.Sword light flashed![Thunderflame Sword] \u2013 Thunderflash Flint! Blazing Thunderclap![Raindrop Sutra] \u2013 Merciless Waterflow! Raindrop Pierces Rocks!Shua!The red eyes in the upraised head of the giant red snake slowly dimmed. There was a deep hole in its head now, which had pierced straight through its skull. And then, its massive body collapsed to the ground like a pile of mud, causing the earth to shake. Fresh blood flowed outwards, staining the ground in a river of red blood.\u201cMm.\u201d Ning looked at the corpse of the massive red snake, then inspected its wound.He was studying how effective his killing blow had been.\u201cBlazing Thunderclap truly is a powerful attack. It actually drilled such a massive hole into the snake\u2019s chest. It almost split the snake in half.\u201d Ning nodded as he continued to inspect the damage. \u201cMerciless Waterflow and Thunderflash Flint can both be described in one word; fast! Merciless Waterflow is both fast and agilely unpredictable, while Thunderflash Flint is fast and explosive.\u201d\u201cRaindrop Pierces Rocks has good penetrative ability. It was easily able to pierce through this snake\u2019s skull.\u201d Ning nodded.In the air above the cage, a massive creature was descending through the clouds. Compare to Serpentwing, his child, Redtrip, was nothing more than a tadpole! Serpentwing\u2019s scarlet eyes could already see through the chains of the cage to the scene below. It saw the desolate, miserable sight of the blood-splattered serpent corpse lying on the soft earth, and as it saw this, it felt a terrible fire suddenly fill its consciousness.\u201cMy child!\u201dSerpentwing had gone totally mad. \u201cHuman, pay for my child\u2019s death!\u201dBang!The powerful energy vibrations coming from above the cage made Ning raise his head to take a look.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Ning immediately saw that hundreds of meters away, within the clouds, an enormous serpent with barely visible pair of giant wings was staring at him. The creature was currently charging downwards at him\u2026its wingspan alone was larger than the entire cage.The red-eyed snake\u2019s eyes were filled with boundless killing intent. Ning was shocked, and he understood\u2026that the creature charging down from above was here to kill him!\u201cNot good. Flee!\u201dNing turned his head and immediately wanted to flee!But just as he wanted to flee, he realized that the corridor he had come through had been shut. Generally speaking, during cage battles, they would always be shut, to prevent someone from fleeing before the battle was over! Only after obtaining victory would Ning order people to open the tunnel\u2026but he just killed the giant red snake moments ago, and hadn\u2019t had the chance to give the order yet.In addition, as he had started the cage battle, he had forbidden others from watching him. Generally speaking, only his father watched.After all, his true power was something that had remained a secret all along. For example, the fact that he used twin swords or that he could use ordinary swords to kill a peak Houtian level Godbeast\u2026these were all secrets. The outside world still believed that Ning relied on sharp precious weapons to slay Godbeasts.\u201cShua!\u201d \u201cShua!\u201d Ning immediately threw away the two swords in his hands, and instantly, two more swords appeared; the Darknorth swords!\u201cBreak!\u201dNing exploded forth with all his power, hacking away at the thick chains above him, while also calling out frantically at the top of his lungs, \u201cFATHER!\u201dThe sound rang out, but the speed of sound was actually slower than the downward charging speed of Serpentwing.\u201cDangdangdang!\u201d Ning\u2019s Darknorth swords wildly chopped against the steel chain net up above. In the past, his father, Yichuan had said this: \u201cGiven your strength\u2026if you are to use the power within the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] and use your full strength, you should be able to break apart the chains. But a web like this formed from many chains\u2026you will probably need the span of ten breaths before you are able to break enough chains to escape.\u201dBut now that Ning had the Darknorth swords. They were indeed sharp. Dangdangdang\u2026one chain after another was shattered, but there were simply too many of them. To break enough to allow him to escape would probably require the span of one breath.One breath?The terrifying creature charging from above wouldn\u2019t even need a second before arriving!\u201cNo time.\u201d Even as Ning was chopping the steel chains, he immediately understood this.The massive scaled wings sliced through the air, striking against the chain of webs. These steel chains, which were incomparably tough for Ning, were extremely feeble in the face of this attack of a thousand year old monster. With a series of shattering sounds, countless chains broke apart and flew everywhere. And then, the scaled wings swept directly against Ning.\u201cPay with your own life for my son\u2019s!\u201d Serpentwing\u2019s red eyes stared wildly at Ning.\u201cDodge.\u201dTwin swords in his hands, Ning quickly dodged while at the same time, using the same technique with both swords; \u2018Thin Unending Waterflow\u2019. His sword flashed, receiving the scaled wing that came from above.One layer of sword flash after another intersected, and both swords combined, forming an endless web of sword light. It was as though multiple layers of silk were being wrapped around the opponent\u2019s attack, restricting it.He launched ten of these attacks in a row!\u201cBang!\u201d The massive scaled wing smashed down upon the twin Darknorth swords, and the power of this strike caused Ning to instantly feel the bones in his wrists splitting apart. And then, the blade-like edges of the wing cleaved down upon the dodging Ning, slashing straight through the Goldstar Shirt.Pu!Fresh blood sprayed out, and his left arm, still clutching a Darknorth sword, went flying. Ning\u2019s entire body was sent smashing into the blackwater iron wall, creating a human-shaped impression into the wall. Ning vomited out a large mouthful of blood from his lips.\u201cHu!\u201d Serpentwing raised its scaled wings again, preparing to deal yet another cleaving blow.\u201cThis is the moment!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe now one-armed Ning gritted his teeth, then suddenly scurried out like a massive grasshopper through the broken cage. [Shadewind Steps]. He used this footwork technique to its absolute limits, flashing out like a streak of azure light, fleeing outside.\u201cDie!\u201d A violent wind attacked.Looking behind him, Ning saw an enormous black blur sweep towards him. That was the massive serpent tail of Serpentwing. This whipping attack by Serpentwing\u2019s tail was even faster and even fiercer than the attack of his scaled wings! The air it passed through exploded with terrifying sonic booms, and the tough marble stones of Dragon Castle began to split apart\u2026The enormous black tail was everywhere, surrounding Ning. Given Ning\u2019s speed, there was simply no way he would be able to dodge this attack at all.\u201cI\u2019m finished!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chop, pierce, scrape, slice\u2026he only used these most basic of movements and didn\u2019t even use much force, and so the tree trunk only had some scratches appear on its surface.His wife, Snow, held a bottle of water nearby, watching her man train with a smile on her face, occasionally sprinkling some water on the nearby flowers and grass.\u201cHrm?\u201d Yichuan and Snow simultaneously turned to look in the same direction. Both of them sensed a vibration of energy.\u201cDragon Castle.\u201dYichuan and Snow simultaneously leaped onto the rooftop of the building, staring at the distant Dragon Castle.Dragon Castle was built in a fairly out-of-the-way location in the inner city, at least two kilometers or so away from where Yichuan and his wife lived.They saw\u2026In the air above Dragon Castle was the enormous Serpentwing. Serpentwing\u2019s scaled wings were currently covering the entirety of Dragon Castle, and a bloodstained youth with only one arm was scurrying out of Dragon Castle at high speed, while an enormous draconic tail flashed towards him like lightning.Snow\u2019s eyes instantly turned red. She let out an agonized howl. \u201cNing!\u201dBut the distance was too far.There was no time at all!\u201cVermin!\u201d Yichuan exploded with anger, letting out a sudden, ferocious chop with the blue sword in his hands. Hua! A brilliant wave of blue light flew out from his sword. The three hundred meter long wave of blue light was even slightly larger than Serpentwing itself! It slashed through the air, chopping directly towards Serpentwing.Pengpengpeng!The distant tail of Serpentwing, in the blink of an eye, was struck dozens of times. The entire Dragon Castle exploded and collapsed, sending large amounts of rocks flying everywhere. Many of the servants, guards, and members of the Ji clan who lived around Dragon Castle were injured or wounded, and their blood splashed everywhere. Even some of the monstrous beasts inside the beast tunnels were killed by the impact.\u2026..Just as Ning scurried out of the cage, he was attacked by the massive tail of the serpent.Ning knew that in front of this Winged Snake monstrosity, the Goldstar Shirt of his might as well have been paper. All he had was a peak Houtian level Fiendgod body\u2026.he probably would be smashed into a pile of pulverized flesh in an instant.\u201cNo.\u201dNing simply couldn\u2019t accept this. In this life, he had such a healthy, strong body, had a pair of doting parents, and had the chance to train to become an Immortal, to control his own destiny. He had trained for so long\u2026and everything was just starting. He truly couldn\u2019t accept this!\u201cDodge!\u201d Ning used the [Shadewind Steps] with all his might.Quick, quicker, quicker!\u201cHu!\u201d\u201cHu!\u201dThe wind was howling!Hu! Ning\u2019s body was howling as well!\u201cBang!\u201d The serpent\u2019s tail came smashing down. It scraped past Ning, then smashed against the thick marble rocks of Dragon Castle. Instantly, the entire Dragon Castle had shuddered and large amounts of marble rock had shattered and been sent flying everywhere.\u201cYou managed to dodge?\u201d The red-eyed Serpentwing howled, \u201cYou were lucky enough to dodge once, but do you think you\u2019ll dodge twice?\u201dBang!The serpent tail swung down at him again!But Ning was like a piece of paper, fluttering about in the breeze, as agile as the wind, as unpredictable as a shadow. The serpent tail once again missed Ning, smashing against Dragon Castle once more.\u201cImpossible!\u201d Serpentwing was now truly enraged.It was a Diremonster who had trained for thousands of years and had reached the late-stage Xiantian level. It was many times more powerful than those ordinary early-stage Xiantian Diremonsters. For someone of its power, killing a youth should be simplicity itself, much like how it has easily slaughtered those thousands of tribesmen in the Goldblade Tribe.Pengpengpeng! Serpentwing wildly struck everywhere with its tail, and its wings struck out as well. The entire Dragon Castle was shuddering and on the verge of collapse, and large amounts of stones were flying everywhere. Many servants and black armored riders lost their lives\u2026\u201cDiediedie!\u201d Serpentwing was frantic.A wild cold aura emanated from him, and the temperature dropped, causing some servants to immediately freeze to death.The black poisonous mist came out, and the surrounding Houtian level lifeforms all were poisoned to death.But Ning continued to dodge time and time again in that massive cloud of dust.The cold aura could freeze to death those peak Houtian Ki Refining warriors, but Ning, who trained in the Fiendgod Body Refining technique, his body was more than a hundred times stronger than those Houtian Ki Refiners. These large-scale cold air and poison gas attacks couldn\u2019t harm him at all.\u201cLike the wind. Like the shadows.\u201d\u201cShadewind Steps.\u201d\u201cThis is the Shadewind Steps. The true Shadewind Steps.\u201d Ning totally immersed himself in it, allowing those strikes from the enormous Serpentwing to come as they will, allowing the scaled wings to slash at him as they pleased. He simply followed the natural force of the wind and borrowed it, and also the force of the wind created by his opponent, Serpentwing, to dodge agilely time and time again.He moved like a shadow. Serpentwing couldn\u2019t hit him, no matter how he tried.He moved like the wind. Ning\u2019s body flickered everywhere with such gentle ease, as though he were a leaf that was being blown by the gentle wind.\u201cOne with the world!\u201d\u201cThis youngster has actually reached the level of \u2018one with the world\u2019? His footwork is at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level?\u201d The vicious, otherworldly ancient monster, Serpentwing, was finally certain that this human youth who had killed his son had actually reached the level of \u2018one with the world\u2019. This was a level which this old monster hadn\u2019t reached yet, despite having trained for thousands of years.\u201dOne with the world!Generally speaking, only Zifu Disciples were at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level, while some powerful Xiantian lifeforms would also reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level.Humans naturally had a greater potential for insight than monsters!Only the likes of Godbeasts were on par with humans in terms of understanding.\u201cDamnable.\u201d The ancient monster, Serpentwing, knew that in a short period of time, he wouldn\u2019t be able to kill this human youth.\u201cVermin!\u201dAn enormous blue sword light attacked.The ancient monster, Serpentwing, swung his tail towards that blue sword light, not caring about it at all. \u201cYichuan, do you think that your sword light can harm me from a distance of two kilometers?\u201dBang!Dark green blood splattered everywhere, and wherever the blood splattered, the ground hissed and bubbled. The marble and the blackwater iron all quickly dissolved. That enormous, thick tail had been cut so deeply, it was nearly severed in half.\u201cHow could it be this powerful?\u201d Serpentwing was truly frightened.The number one expert of the Ji clan\u2019s West Prefecture truly was too terrifying.\u201cHu!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let you live for now!\u201d Serpentwing tossed Ning a furious glare, and then with a beat of its two wings, flew into the sky at high speed.\u201cVermin!\u201d\u201cSerpentwing, you dare to barge into the Ji clan\u2019s West Prefecture, and you think you can flee?\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dFrom multiple areas in the inner city, there erupted furious roars, including those of Ji Lee and Ji Young, as well as dozens of Xiantian lifeforms, all of whom shouted at him.\u201cLoan me your Azure Firebird.\u201d Yichuan transformed into a ray of light, flying onto a giant blue bird that was in mid-flight, which had a blue fire blazing on its tail. On the back of this blue bird, there was a woman dressed in black.\u201cYichuan, I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d The black-clothed woman said in her hoarse voice.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dYichuan swept the area below with his gaze. Seeing his son standing within the rubble of Dragon Castle, he couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh of relief\u2026but seeing the bloodstained severed arm of his son, he felt his fury blaze up once more.\u201cHu!\u201dYichuan and the black-clothed woman, riding the Azure Firebird, tore through the air, pursuing in the direction of the fleeing Serpentwing. As for the other Xiantian level people in the West Prefecture, all of them were roaring with fury. A Diremonster had dared to barge into the inner city of the Ji clan\u2019s West Prefecture City? This was totally against all reason!But humans at the Xiantian level were not capable of flight yet, and so they could only watch as Yichuan and his companion flew on the back of the Azure Firebird in pursuit of Serpentwing.\u2026..Ning remained within that state of being \u2018one with the world\u2019. He could sense the strength of the wind, and he could borrow that strength to become as carefree as the wind itself. He could even borrow the attacking strength of the enemy to dodge the enemy\u2019s attacks, as though he were the enemy\u2019s shadow.\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dA feeble moan caused Ning to look around him. The entire Dragon Castle had been reduced to rubble. A large number of servants and black armored riders had died gruesome deaths, either smashed, frozen, or poisoned to death. The sight was unbearable to see.The joy he felt at having the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level of the [Shadewind Steps] faded away.Ning ground his teeth. With a leap, he entered the field of rubble. He began kicking aside pieces of rock, and quickly found his severed left arm, then re-absorbed the Darknorth sword his left arm was clutching back into his kalestone. And then, Ning grabbed his severed left arm with his right arm, pressing it against the stump. By now, the severed stump was no longer bleeding any more.\u201cConnect.\u201d Ning connected the severed arm to the stump, and then extended the Goldstar Shirt to quickly encapsulate his left arm as well, putting it back into position.Even in his previous life, a severed hand or arm that had only been severed recently could be reattached.Ning currently had the body of a Fiendgod. A severed arm only needed a few hours to be regrown, much less a severed arm that was being reattached\u2026Ning could clearly sense his muscles and flesh rapidly grow back, and his bones were quickly reaching out and connecting as well. His arm had already been reattached, but he would still need a little bit longer before reaching his perfect state.\u201cNing!\u201d A somewhat frantic sound rang out.Ning raised his head up. He saw an old man who wore a dark red beast fur pelt standing in the rubble looking down at him. This man was the Prefecture Lord, Ji Young. Prefecture Lord Young saw that Ning was unharmed, and only then let out a sigh of relief. \u201cAs long as you aren\u2019t hurt. As long as you aren\u2019t hurt.\u201d\u201cNing.\u201d An agonized shout.Ning didn\u2019t have the chance to speak with the Prefecture Lord. He hurriedly made his way out from the debris field, and saw from far away his mother running towards him, her face covered with bitter tears.\u201cMother.\u201d Ning called out repeatedly.Seeing her son standing there, Snow instantly began to shed tears of joy. Ning quickly ran towards his mother at high speed, then hugged her. Snow hugged her son back. \u201cWonderful, wonderful. I was so frightened just now. If anything had happened to you, I really don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done.\u201d\u201cMother, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Ning said repeatedly.\u201cYour arm?\u201d Snow looked carefully at her son\u2019s left arm.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Look.\u201d Ning waved his left arm around. The bones and flesh of his left arm had been totally connected by now, and even the cells had been 80% regenerated. Most likely, in just a little bit longer, he would be in perfect condition.Only now did Snow completely relax. She knew how powerful her son\u2019s recuperative ability was, as a Fiendgod Body Refiner.\u201cWhat happened? How could this Diremonster, Serpentwing, dare to have the temerity to attack our Ji clan\u2019s Western Manor?\u201d A heroic voice rang out, and the red-haired viper elder, Ji Lee, came running over, his face filled with fury. \u201cThis vermin is asking to be killed. Also, we need to immediately investigate why it charged and attacked our Ji clan\u2019s Western Prefecture City.\u201d\u201cIt is indeed strange. Doesn\u2019t Serpentwing know that by acting in such a way, it has fully infuriated the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture?\u201d A skinny old man with a scar over his forehead said coldly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOne Xiantian individual after another walked over.Seeing the destroyed Dragon Castle and the large number of corpses and bloodstains, the dozens of Xiantian individuals had very ugly looks on their faces. As the administrators of this large expanse of land, it had been a long time since a Diremonster had dared to attack the West Prefecture. Every single expert of the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture felt both fury and shame.\u201cIt must die!\u201d\u201cWe absolutely must kill that Diremonster, Serpentwing.\u201d\u201cKill it!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The black-clothed woman stared at the rapidly fleeing Serpentwing. \u201cYichuan, this Serpentwing is a late-stage Xiantian level Diremonster. It is quite a bit stronger than my Azure Firebird. Although the Azure Firebird is good at long-distance flight, it\u2019ll still be hard to catch up.\u201cLady Flower, I\u2019ll handle this.\u201d Yichuan\u2019s face was as cold as ice. From within his hands, a silver greatbow suddenly appeared out of nowhere, while in his left hand was an arrow.Hua\u2026.The bow was fully drawn. Yichuan stared coldly at the fleeing Serpentwing.\u201cSwish!\u201d The arrow suddenly transformed into a ray of light, streaking towards the fleeing Serpentwing. At such a short range, the terrifying speed at which Yichuan had launched this arrow, combined with Serpentwing\u2019s massive body, meant that there was no way it could dodge.In terms of pure archery skill, Yichuan was perhaps inferior to Blindfish.But most of the men of the Ji clan were skilled in archery, and this arrow of Yichuan\u2019s\u2026in terms of speed, was even faster than Blindfish\u2019s!\u201cBang!\u201dThe arrow struck Serpentwing\u2019s body, then instantly exploded, creating an enormous, bloody hole. A massive, bone-exposing wound was revealed on the serpent\u2019s body, and it seemed as though with just one more arrow, this serpent would completely explode from the inside. Actually, Yichuan\u2019s arrow had been aimed at those bony wings. But Serpentwing knew\u2026once his scaled, bony wings were injured, he wouldn\u2019t be able to flee. Thus, he had used his own serpentine body to block the arrow instead.\u201cCrackle\u2026\u201d The flesh on the serpent\u2019s body quickly closed, and blood stopped flowing.Serpentwing continued to flee wildly.\u201cYichuan, your Ji clan killed my son. Can it be that you won\u2019t let me seek revenge?\u201d Serpentwing shouted backwards.\u201cVermin, if you let yourself die peacefully, I\u2019ll let you die fast. Otherwise, I\u2019ll make sure you regret it.\u201d Half-kneeling on the back of the Azure Firebird, Yichuan once more nocked that silver greatbow.Serpentwing hurriedly moved to dodge.Bang!Yet another arrow blasted against Serpentwing\u2019s body. Serpentwing howled in agony, and his heart was frantic. \u201cYichuan is the number one expert of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, true, but how can he be this powerful? Earlier, from the great distance of two kilometers, the sword flash of Yichuan\u2019s had still been powerful enough to injure me severely. And now, a single arrow of his can injure me. Even a peak Xiantian-level Diremonster is only at most able to hold me down; there\u2019s no way one would be able to demolish me so easily!\u201dSerpentwing\u2019s courage had been entirely shattered by that sword flash from earlier.A sword flash that could heavily injure him despite having come from over two kilometers away.If it was executed at a closer distance, wouldn\u2019t it have killed him in one blow?\u201cSwish!\u201d \u201cSwish!\u201d \u201cSwish!\u201d Yichuan fired one arrow after another, and Serpentwing could only grit his teeth and use his body to block it. Fortunately, his massive body was hundreds of meters long. Although his enormous body now had over ten massive craters in it, given his powerful life force, he could still maintain his high speed flight.Soon, the wide expanse of earth below gave way to a wide lake.\u201cHu!\u201d Serpentwing immediately charged downwards.\u201cSerpentwing Lake.\u201d Yichuan and the black-clothed woman\u2019s faces both changed.Serpentwing Lake was over a hundred kilometers long. One couldn\u2019t even see the ends of the lake\u2026and what\u2019s more, it was Serpentwing\u2019s lair.Hua\u2026The enormous Serpentwing plummeted down from the skies, diving into the lake. A few large waves arose, but the creature itself had disappeared.As for the Azure Firebird, it continued to hover in the air above Serpentwing Lake.\u201cYichuan, what should we do?\u201d The black-clothed woman asked.\u201cFled?\u201d Yichuan stood on the back of the Azure Firebird, staring down at the massive lake. He said coldly, \u201cHe thinks that just because he is hiding in the water that I won\u2019t be able to do anything to him? Lady Flower, loan me the Azure Firebird for now. I\u2019d like to trouble you, Lady Flower, to immediately return to the West Prefecture\u2026and have my spirit-beast, the serpent, come over.\u201cAlright.\u201d The black-clothed woman nodded.Swish!The black-clothed woman transformed into a streak of light, flashing across the surface of the lake, then disappearing into the distance.\u2026.In the depths of Serpentwing Lake.The enormous Serpentwing lay coiled at the bottom, occasionally licking some of its enormous wounds with its tongue. His enormous life force and regenerative force was causing his wounds to quickly grow stronger, and his flesh was visibly regrowing and extending.\u201cJi Yichuan.\u201d Serpentwing\u2019s eyes were filled with disbelief. \u201cHow can he be this powerful? That Ji Lee is the number two expert of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. In the past, when we fought against each other, he only had somewhat of an advantage over me\u2026but most likely, if this Yichuan is allowed to draw close to me, he would be able to kill me with one blow of his sword. How can the difference be this great?\u201dBefore this, Serpentwing had been confident in his fleeing abilities. As he viewed it, he was a late-stage Xiantian-level Diremonster. Even if he ran into a terrifying peak Xiantian-level creature\u2026he would at most be at an disadvantage. He would still be able to flee. As long as he wasn\u2019t attacked by an entire group of Xiantian life forms, he should be fine.But that sword of Yichuan\u2019s had scared him silly.\u201cGroooowl.\u201d\u201cGaaaaaa!\u201dThe monsters within Serpentwing Lake all began to howl fiercely. This sound instantly caused great shock to Serpentwing, deep within the waters of the lake. He could understand those monstrous cries.\u201cA Diremonster has come?\u201d Serpentwing was greatly shocked. \u201cRight, one of the Diremonsters that the Ji clan of the West Prefecture has tamed is a water-type Diremonster.\u201dSome monsters were avian-types, skilled at flight.Others were water-types, extremely powerful in the water.Some non-water races, upon entering the water, would see their power drop! For example, Yichuan\u2026in the water, his speed probably would be less than a tenth of his usual speed. But in the water, Serpentwing would be even faster than on land! Even if Yichuan were to use his sword techniques, with the water blocking him, the power of his techniques would be much lower as well.Of course, although the power of Yichuan\u2019s sword techniques would be greatly reduced, he could still kill Serpentwing! The problem was that in the water, he would be completely unable to catch Serpentwing. No matter how powerful his sword techniques were, it would be of no use.\u2026.\u201cBrother Black, go search and find that Serpentwing.\u201d Yichuan stood on the surface of the lake, but didn\u2019t sink down at all. \u201cAlthough he is more powerful than you, he is badly wounded. In addition, after finding him, you just need to tie him down for a while and prevent him from escaping. I will immediately charge over and slay him.\u201d\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d The coiled black serpent nodded on the surface of the lake, then immediately sank its entire body into the depths, beginning to search within Serpentwing Lake.Those lesser monsters in the lake all fled in every direction, screaming in terror.\u201cAzure Firebird.\u201d Yichuan looked at the Azure Firebird above him. \u201cStay up there and keep a lookout. Once Serpentwing flees from the lake, immediately chase after and kill him.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The Azure Firebird spoke in a soft voice, then rose at a high speed.Yichuan\u2019s face was grim. Wielding his blue longsword, he paced about on the surface of the lake as though it were flat land. One step at a time, he walked, leaving faint ripples on the surface. His cold gaze stared at his surroundings, as though he could see straight through the lake water to the depths of the lake.\u2026..Ji clan\u2019s West Prefecture.It was dark now, and the commotion caused by Serpentwing\u2019s attack in the Ji clan\u2019s West Prefecture had died down as well.\u201cFather.\u201d Ji Jadewich, his hair parted into dozens of braids, was seated on his knees. After draining all of the wine in his beast-skull goblet, he said, \u201cSerpentwing, that Diremonster, has already fled back to his lair. Serpentwing Lake is extremely large, and so deep that the bottom cannot be seen. If it makes up its mind to hide, a single black serpent searching by itself will find it hard to locate him. Although Yichuan is extremely powerful, it will still be very hard for him to kill that Serpentwing.\u201dLee nodded, but he was frowning. He hadn\u2019t touched any of the wine or meat in front of him. Clearly, he was frustrated by something.\u201cFather?\u201d Jadewich looked questioningly at his father.Frowning, Lee let out a low sigh. \u201cHis sword flash travelled a distance of over two kilometers, but was still able to heavily wound Serpentwing, a Diremonster. The power of that sword has essentially surpassed the limits which a Xiantian lifeform can attain.\u201d\u201cFather, do you mean to say\u2026\u201d Jadewich was shocked. \u201cZifu Disciple?\u201dLee shook his head. \u201cHard to say! If Yichuan had opened his Zifu, the \u2018Violet Palace\u2019, then he should be able to fly about on magic treasures. He wouldn\u2019t just stand there and watch as that Serpentwing, which almost slew his son, turn tail and run away. But if he hasn\u2019t opened his Zifu\u2026the power of his sword attack remains ridiculously large. Thus, I feel puzzled and unable to understand it.\u201d\u201cAlso!\u201d\u201cI saw that Ji Ning had his arm severed, but in the blink of an eye, by the time the dust had settled and I rushed over there, Ning was totally fine.\u201d Lee was frowning.Many Xiantian-level people had seen Ning\u2019s severed arm lying there in the rubble.\u201cThe son of Ji Yichuan, Ji Ning, should be training in some sort of Fiendgod Body Refining.\u201d Jadewich nodded. \u201cIn addition, he has already reached an exceedingly high level, for him to be able to re-connect a severed arm. Only, I am puzzled\u2026how did Ning manage to survive the attack of Serpentwing on Dragon Castle?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand either.\u201d Lee sighed. \u201cI suppose he is lucky.\u201dWhy was Ning able to survive?Perhaps it was because Serpentwing knew who Ning was and thus was afraid to kill him.Perhaps it was because Ning had powerful lifeforce as a Fiendgod Body Refiner and thus was luckily able to survive.Perhaps it was because Ning had some sort of protective treasure given to him by his parents.The experts of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture were all abuzz, guessing wildly over the reason, but none of them guessed that the merely ten year old Ning had already reached the level of \u2018one with the world\u2019 in terms of footwork.\u2026\u2026Ning was currently in the middle of his training area, displaying his Shadewind Steps. In the hundreds of meter wide training field, a blurred form was moving about at high speed. As it did\u2026Shua! Shua! Shua! Dozens of Ning\u2019s appeared out of nowhere.\u201cNing.\u201d A voice rang out.Ning immediately came to a halt.\u201cMother.\u201d Ning immediately went over to welcome her.Yuchi Snow slowly walked over, filled with joy as she stared at her son. After suffering from Serpentwing\u2019s attack, during the day, the Ji clan had prepared a series of cremations and memorial ceremonies for the deceased black armored riders and clansmen killed during the attack. At that time, Ning had secretly informed his mother that his footwork had already reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level. But of course, his mother was the only one he told!At just ten years of age, he had reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level of footwork. Snow had been to many areas of the Grand Xia Dynasty, but she had almost never seen someone as monstrous as this. Actually, because Ning had utilized the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique since birth, his soul was extremely powerful. In addition, he had painstakingly trained in the [Shadewind Steps] since he was young, and thus reached the \u2018advanced\u2019 level two years ago. In that moment where life and death hung in the balance, he had suddenly been able to sense the world and reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level. This was nothing more than success naturally arriving when the conditions were right.\u201cNing.\u201d Snow looked at her son. \u201cYour footwork has reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level. The next step will be to have your sword techniques also become \u2018one with the world\u2019. Do not slacken off.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes, mother.\u201d Ning nodded.For footwork to be at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level meant for the man to become one with the world.But for the sword to be at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level meant for the man, the sword, and the world to all become one. Naturally, it was considerably more difficult.\u201cMother.\u201d Ning asked. \u201cWhen will Father come back?\u201d\u201cYour father went to kill that Diremonster. After killing Serpentwing, he will come home, of course.\u201d Snow said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Ji clan of West Prefecture had long since sent a squad of black armored riders to surround Serpentwing Lake.Within the training yard.One sword attack after another howled and flashed through the air. Ning stood there by himself, training in the [Raindrop Sutra]. At this point, neither black armored riders nor powerful monstrous beasts\u2026were of any use to Ning in terms of improving his swordplay. But his father, Yichuan, had yet to return. Thus, Ning could only train by himself.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Autumn Leaf called out softly.\u201cHrm?\u201d Ning looked at Autumn Leaf, who had a nervous, uncertain look on her face.Frowning, Ning sheathed his Darknorth swords. \u201cAutumn Leaf, what is it?\u201d\u201cYoung master\u2026\u201d Autumn Leaf said in a low voice. \u201cSpring Grass\u2019s father requests to see you, young master.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Ning was stunned.\u201cSpring Grass\u2019s father.\u201d Autumn Leaf\u2019s voice grew slightly louder. \u201cHer biological father!\u201dNing was shocked. \u201cSpring Grass has a father?\u201dHis two personal maids had been slaves their entire lives. When they were very young, they were sold to the Ji clan\u2019s West Prefecture.\u201cWhere is Spring Grass?\u201d Ning asked.\u201cSpring Grass didn\u2019t dare to come see you, young master.\u201d Autumn Leaf said in a low voice. \u201cI could tell that actually, Spring Grass would rather like to see her father, but her status\u2026makes her afraid to say it.\u201dNing suddenly remembered something.Right. Strictly speaking, Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf were his maidservants, and their lives were under his control. From the day they were sold as slaves, they no longer had any contact with their parents. However, people were not like trees or grass; they had feelings.\u201cGo and bring Spring Grass\u2019 father here.\u201d Ning chuckled. \u201cSince he wants to meet me, then let him meet me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Autumn Leaf\u2019s face was covered with joy and she immediately ran out.Ning called towards the outside of the yard, \u201cSpring Grass, come in.\u201d Outside the courtyard, a fur-clad female servant was standing there uncertainly. Hearing the young master\u2019s shout, she had to walk inside. But her face was filled with nervousness and uncertainty\u2026right now, Spring Grass felt many complicated emotions. She was excited, happy, nervous, embarrassed, guilty, and restless.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Spring Grass looked at Ning.\u201cYour father is here. If you want to meet him, you can.\u201d Ning laughed.\u201cBut\u2026but I was bought by the Ji clan.\u201d Spring Grass bit her lips.\u201cHrm?\u201d Ning frowned slightly. \u201cDo my words no longer carry weight around here?\u201d\u201cUnderstood, young master.\u201d Spring Grass glanced at Ning, her heart filled with gratitude. Actually, she had long ago sensed that this most brilliant talent of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, the youngster who would one day become Prefecture Lord, didn\u2019t treat her and Autumn Leaf like most masters treated their servants.\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d Ning looked outside, and immediately saw two figures walking into the courtyard. The one in front was Autumn Leaf, while the one behind was a tall, middle-aged man wearing black beast fur. This middle-aged man had some scars on his face, and his head was lowered, seeming rather nervous.\u201cYoung master, he\u2019s here.\u201d Autumn Leaf said respectfully.The scarred man hurriedly knelt down, pressing his head against the ground and also his two hands down on the ground in prostration. Extremely respectful, he said, \u201cBlacktooth pays his respects to the mighty young master.\u201dSeeing this, Spring Grass\u2019 eyes couldn\u2019t help but turn red.Ning glanced at Spring Grass, then said, \u201cPlease rise.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Only now did the scarred man rise, and as he did, he saw Spring Grass standing by Ning\u2019s side. Father and daughter\u2019s gazes met, and instantly, tears began to flow down both their faces.The scarred man quickly recovered, hurriedly wiping his tears away.\u201cWhy have you come here to my place?\u201d Ning asked.The scarred man took a deep breath. \u201cBlacktooth has come to your place, young master, because I wish to request that young master redeem my child, \u2018Miwa\u2019, back to me.\u201d\u201cRedeem?\u201d Ning was surprised.Redeem?In the years since he had arrived in this world, he didn\u2019t have many people whom he had close relationships with, but Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf, in Ning\u2019s heart, were like big sisters to him.\u201cFather.\u201d Spring Grass couldn\u2019t help but shout out. It was generally possible to redeem an ordinary slave by paying a certain price, but what sort of status did young master Ji have? How could her father possibly redeem her? If the young master was angered, her father might immediately lose his life.At the same time, she fell to her knees with a thudding sound. \u201cYoung master, my father doesn\u2019t understand anything. I beg you, young master, to pardon my father for his disrespect.\u201d\u201cLet him speak.\u201d Ning looked at the scarred man. \u201cIf you have anything to say, say it. If you can convince me, I\u2019ll agree. If you can\u2019t\u2026hmph.\u201dThe scarred man\u2019s heart shook.He understood exactly how much power and authority this young man in front of him had. If this young man wanted his life, it would be simplicity itself to take it. But since he had chosen to come\u2026he had made mental preparations!\u201cMighty young master.\u201d The scarred man said respectfully, \u201cBlacktooth will tell you everything in my heart.\u201dNing only looked at him.\u201cI, Blacktooth, was once the son of a tribal chief.\u201d The scarred man said slowly. \u201cWithin a mountain forest, the Blacktooth Tribe lived a peaceful life. We raised animals inside, and I led the mighty warriors of the tribe to pursue and kill monstrous beasts across the nearby land\u2026and one day, we discovered in a secluded valley a large amount of naturally grown millet rice.\u201d\u201cThe entire tribe was extremely excited and overjoyed with this discovery. With this supply of millet, the lives of our tribe would be much improved, and we would be able to have more tribesmen. However, this news was quickly discovered by another powerful tribe, the Blood Mosquito Tribe. One morning at dawn, when the sky was just beginning to brighten and many tribesmen were still asleep\u2026\u201d The scarred man\u2019s eyes revealed a hint of bitterness and pain. \u201cThey ambushed our clan, slaughtering many of my tribesmen. Our power was far inferior to the Blood Mosquito Tribe to begin with, and we were ambushed. The few of us who were lucky enough to survive had to flee.\u201d\u201cI fled with Miwa, encountering countless perils and dangers on the way before finally fleeing to the West Prefecture City.\u201d The scarred man\u2019s body was trembling slightly. \u201cBut my dearly beloved daughter and my tribal brothers had all died. I had to seek revenge, even if I died doing so. But Miwa was innocent and blameless. I hoped she would continue to live\u2026so I sold her to the Ji clan. In the Ji clan, she would at least have a stable life.\u201dSpring Grass was shaking as well, her tears pouring down. \u201cFather, Father\u2026\u201dShe could never forget\u2026Forget those days of flight. Although she was still young, she would never forget the sight of her loved ones all dying, one after the other, and all her friends of the same age dying as well. Never forget her father desperately fighting to survive one terrible danger after another as they battled their way to the West Prefecture City. At that time, her father had only told her, \u201cMiwa, Father needs to go do what must be done. Miwa, you need to continue to live a good life.\u201d\u201cFather, don\u2019t leave Miwa, Father, Father!\u201d The young Spring Grass had cried bitterly.The still-young Blacktooth had ground his teeth and then left.He had embarked on the road to revenge!\u201cI hated\u2026\u201d The scarred man\u2019s body was shaking. \u201cI wanted to get revenge. Although I was a Ninefang Warrior, to the Blood Mosquito Tribe, I was nothing at all. After I killed four of my enemies, a red-furred Diremonster suddenly ambushed the Blood Mosquito Tribe. That bastard who had led the squad to destroy my homeland was devoured by that Diremonster in one gulp, and the Blood Mosquito Tribe was destroyed. The few lucky survivors of the Blood Mosquito Tribe all joined other tribes.\u201d\u201cI had no enemies left.\u201d\u201cI, who had nothing at all, did not have any way to redeem Miwa, so I became a travelling merchant.\u201d The scarred man said. \u201cAfter one life-and-death experience after another, I managed to find some of the scattered survivors of my tribe, and my merchant caravan became more and more powerful. I gained wealth, and thus alongside the scattered survivors, I founded a tribe\u2026my own Blacktooth Tribe! And I, I became the new \u2018Blacktooth\u2019.\u201d\u201cWhile becoming a travelling merchant,\u201d the scarred man looked at Ning, \u201cI had the chance to chat with a servant of the Ji clan, and learned that Miwa had become the maidservant of you, young master Ji.\u201d\u201cAfter re-establishing the Blacktooth Tribe, I had done all that I had to do. I had done right by my father, and by the past generations of Blacktooths.\u201d The scarred man looked at Ning. \u201cTherefore, I have come. I have come to see my child, Miwa, whom I have seen in my dreams for these ten years. Even if I had to die, I would see Miwa.\u201d\u201cMy Miwa, my child\u2026I want to be with her. She is the last kin who Blacktooth has.\u201d The scarred man\u2019s face was covered in tears.Spring Grass\u2019s face had been covered in tears long ago, and she was bawling loudly.\u201cFather.\u201d Spring Grass ran over, embracing her agonized father.\u201cMiwa.\u201d The scarred man held his daughter as well. He had been waiting for this day for so long.Autumn Leaf, standing to one side, couldn\u2019t help but cry as well.As for Ning, he sighed as he listened.The tribesmen had to fight against the heavens, the earth, and the monsters. Spring Grass\u2019 father, \u2018Blacktooth\u2019, was the epitome of this.\u201cSpring Grass.\u201d Ning spoke out. \u201cDo you wish to be together with your father?\u201dSpring Grass bit her lips, unable to control the tears in her eyes. She fell to her knees. \u201cYoung master, please forgive Spring Grass! I truly do wish to be with my father, I truly do!\u201d\u201cMighty young master.\u201d The scarred man immediately fell to his knees as well.Ning looked at the two of them, father and daughter. The long time they had spent together had resulted in him loving Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf like a younger brother loving a pair of older sisters. He didn\u2019t want Spring Grass to leave him, but he wanted Spring Grass to be mentally anguished even less. \u201cSpring Grass, from today onwards, your liberty is restored to you. You can go with your father.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Spring Grass and Blacktooth were both stunned.Just like that, he had agreed?The two of them, father and daughter, could be together again?\u201cThank you, mighty young master. Blacktooth will forever remember your great benevolence, young master.\u201d Blacktooth, on his knees, thanked him again and again.\u2026.Under Ning\u2019s instructions, Spring Grass had her liberty restored to her. As she left alongside her father, Spring Grass had called out to him, \u201cYoung master, Spring Grass will forever remember your kindness. Spring Grass will constantly pray for you to be blessed, young master, within the Blacktooth tribe. If in the future, young master, you ever pass by the Blacktooth Tribe, I hope you will be able to come pay a visit to Spring Grass.\u201d\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Ning agreed.\u201cWe definitely will go.\u201d Autumn Leaf was crying as well. She and Spring Grass truly were like sisters.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The days continued to grow colder.Ning\u2019s mentality was changing as well.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSpring Grass\u2019 departure, her father\u2019s experiences, Serpentwing\u2019s attack, his father\u2019s departure to kill the Diremonster, his inability to find an opponent to train his swordplay with within the Ji clan\u2026all of these events caused Ning\u2019s mentality to change.He had the feeling that perhaps the West Prefecture City was too small of a place.He wanted to go outside, wanted to see the wider world! He wanted to see how the tribes like the Blacktooth Tribe lived, and what their lives were like! He wanted to be like his father and go fight one Diremonster after another\u2026he wanted to go adventure in this area of the world\u2026\u201cNing, your father is back.\u201d On this snowy day, Snow called out to her son.Only now did Ning see that in the skies above, his father was returning, half-kneeling on the back of that Azure Firebird.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Today, they were celebrating his father\u2019s return, so he actually had the rare chance to drink some wine.\u201cFather.\u201d Ning spoke out.\u201cMm.\u201d Ji Yichuan frowned as he looked at his son.Ning could sense that his father wasn\u2019t in a very good mood, because this attempt to kill Serpentwing had resulted in failure. To kill a late-stage water-type Xiantian level Diremonster which was hiding in the depths of a lake was simply too difficult. If the Ji clan of the West Prefecture truly wanted to directly slaughter Serpentwing, they could if they paid a large price for it, but clearly, the Ji clan of the West Prefecture wasn\u2019t willing to pay that price. For the sake of their pride and honor, the Ji clan of the West Prefecture had already wiped out the other creatures in Serpentwing Lake, then stationed soldiers all around Serpentwing Lake, as well as numerous Xiantian lifeforms, forcing Serpentwing to be afraid to leave Serpentwing Lake. This would be a long battle. Once Serpentwing became the slightest bit incautious, the Ji clan of the West Prefecture\u2019s Xiantian lifeforms would immediately slaughter him.\u201cI want to go out and adventure.\u201d Ning spoke.\u201cAdventure?\u201d Yichuan frowned.Yuchi Snow said hurriedly, \u201cNing, you were just ambushed by Serpentwing. You should know how terrifying Diremonsters are. Outside the Western Prefecture\u2026there are many Diremonsters lying in wait in the high mountains and the deep lakes. To go adventuring outside\u2026you are still too young. Wait a few more years.\u201d\u201cIn the West Prefecture, I no longer have anyone whom I can train myself against.\u201d Ning shook his head.Yichuan snapped coldly, \u201cHow old are you? Wait until you are at least sixteen before going out and adventuring.\u201d\u201cBut Father!\u201d Ning said urgently, \u201cI\u2019ve been in the Western Prefecture since I was a child. I\u2019ve always stayed in this small little area of the Western Prefecture. I want to see the countless tribes in the greater world. I want to be like Father, to go out and adventure, to experience danger, to go fight with those Diremonsters and kill them.\u201d\u201cDiremonsters? Just based on your little bit of power\u2026\u201d Yichuan shook his head.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with my strength?\u201d Ning said hurriedly. \u201cEven under Serpentwing\u2019s full strength attacks, I was still able to survive. What\u2019s the problem with my strength?\u201dYichuan was startled, and seemed to have suddenly thought of something. \u201cRight. I haven\u2019t had the chance to ask you. How did you survive Serpentwing\u2019s attack?\u201dThe nearby Snow laughed. \u201cYichuan, you\u2019ve been dealing with Serpentwing this entire time and hadn\u2019t had the chance to come back, so we haven\u2019t had the chance to tell you. Our son, in that moment of life-and-death when being attacked by Serpentwing, has reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level of footwork. Relying on his \u2018one with the world\u2019 level of footwork, he was able to escape Serpentwing\u2019s attacks.\u201cOne with the world?\u201d Yichuan stared at Ning in astonishment.At merely ten years old, he had reached the level of \u2018one with the world\u2019 in footwork?\u201cReceive three sword blows from me.\u201d With a sudden flip of his hands, Yichuan made three hazy sword-shadows suddenly appear and surround Ning, attacking as fast as lightning.Ning had been kneeling down at the dinner table. Now, he suddenly dodged aside gracefully, moving past those three hazy sword-shadows as gracefully as the wind.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Ning said proudly.\u201cYou really have reached it.\u201d Yichuan stared at his son in amazement. \u201cOne with the world. Your footwork has reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level. Then your swordplay\u2026isn\u2019t too off from reaching the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level as well.\u201dYichuan looked as his son, his heart swelling with excitement as he quickly pondered. His son, Ning, had such a high level of talent. In the area around Swallow Mountain, he was definitely an extremely rare, monster of a talent. Such incredible talent couldn\u2019t be treated as a normal person was! Given Ning\u2019s rapid rate of improvement, there truly was nothing left in West Prefecture City which would prove useful for him in training.\u201cIf you want to go out and adventure, that isn\u2019t completely out of the question.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cBut you need to accomplish a requirement of mine.\u201d\u201cYichuan!\u201d Snow was a bit frantic, but Yichuan stretched his hand out, stopping her.\u201cFather, speak.\u201d Ning was full of excitement.Yichuan nodded. \u201cThe Ceremony of the Golden Sword is hosted once every four years. It is a ceremony which all youths under the age of sixteen will participate in. I want you to seize the golden sword during this year\u2019s Ceremony of the Golden Sword! As long as you are able to seize the golden sword, I will permit you to go out adventuring.\u201d\u201cGolden sword?\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes lit up.He had known long ago about the agreement that if he could seize the golden sword, he would become the next Prefecture Lord. And during these recent years of training\u2026his father had also spoken to him about this matter of \u2018seizing the golden sword to become the Prefecture Lord\u2019.\u201cSeizing the golden sword is very easy.\u201d Ning looked at Yichuan suspiciously. \u201cFather, I only need to use perhaps a tenth of my full strength to seize the golden sword. This isn\u2019t much of a test for me. Can it be that Father, you truly care so much about the Prefecture Lord position?\u201dHis father\u2019s heart was totally set on the Immortal Path.Ning naturally also had the same desire to step on the Immortal Path.\u201cPrefecture Lord position?\u201d Yichuan shook his head. \u201cYou are the son of Ji Yichuan, my greatest pride. I trust that you will be able to go even farther than me\u2026the position of Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture will only be a constraint on you. You will definitely spread your wings and fly higher.\u201dNing was confused. \u201cThen Father, why do you wish me to go seize the golden sword?\u201d\u201cFirst, to let Ji Lee know that he can stop dreaming.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cThe second reason, you will discover after you seize the golden sword. So long as you can seize the golden sword, I will permit you to go out and adventure. But if you are unable to seize it, then be a good child and stay in the Western Prefecture City.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Ning grinned widely.The nearby Snow, on the other hand, was frantic.\u201cEnough, you can go back and get some rest now.\u201d Yichuan said.Ning immediately jumped up and returned to his room, overjoyed. In the main hall, Yichuan began to explain the reason for his actions to his wife, Snow.\u2026..The next morning. Dawn.While Ning was eating with his parents, Snow instructed him, \u201cAfter seizing the golden sword, I won\u2019t block you from going adventuring either, but you have to bring followers.\u201d\u201cFollowers?\u201d Ning said hurriedly. \u201cBut I\u2019m going out to adventure. What\u2019s the point of bringing a big group of followers?\u201d\u201cYou only need to bring two people.\u201d Snow laughed. \u201cThe first is Autumn Leaf. She is familiar with your habits and can cater to your needs. The other servant would be Mowu. Mowu used to be a Ninefang Warrior of the black armored riders, and then he followed your father for a long time. He is extremely loyal. Although he isn\u2019t as strong as you, he has abundant experience in adventuring in the wilds.Ning pondered for a while, then nodded. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll bring them. I can\u2019t bring any others though.\u201d\u2026..\u201cYoung master, you are going to leave the Western Prefecture to go adventuring? And you are going to bring me along with you?\u201d Autumn Leaf was extremely excited. Ever since she was brought into the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, she had not had a chance to leave the city for a long, long time.\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, silly. Hurry up and get all the records on the Diremonsters in the area around Swallow Mountain from the library. Also get the records on the various tribes, and the maps as well. Move them all here.\u201d Ning was feeling very intrepid as he instructed Autumn Leaf, \u201cI need to get a good understanding and prepare a rough path of adventuring for myself.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201d Autumn Leaf all but flew out.Autumn Leaf was Ning\u2019s personal maidservant, and thus ever since she was young, she had been taught extremely good Ki Refining techniques, and thus was close to the peak of the Houtian level. For someone of her status, the personal maidservant of Ji Ning, she naturally would also be taught special techniques as well, permitting her, at a critical juncture, to sacrifice her life for the sake of her master.\u201cComing.\u201d Autumn Leaf came back, carrying a high stack of books. With a thudding sound, she set them down on the ground. This huge stack of books had to be several hundred pounds.Ning hurriedly began to flip through them.One legendary Diremonster after another\u2026Only now did Ning truly realize exactly how many Diremonsters lay hidden within the high mountains and the deep lakes. It was because Diremonsters were both abundant and very hard to deal with. Thus, the Diremonsters and the local hegemons such as the Ji clan actually had an unspoken understanding. Diremonsters usually wouldn\u2019t wildly slaughter humans on a wide scale, while the Ji clan and the other hegemons wouldn\u2019t go all out to slaughter the Diremonsters.Both sides would stay their hands, maintaining their superficial calm.Although some tribes would often be slaughtered and some Diremonsters would be killed\u2026it was all within a manageable degree! There was an invisible line which neither the Ji clan and the other local hegemons, nor the Diremonsters, wished to cross. Once that line was crossed, then a true storm of blood would occur.\u201cBlacktooth Tribe.\u201d Ning pointed at the map. \u201cThis is the newest map of the territory of our Ji clan of the West Prefecture, and the Blacktooth Tribe is a newly erected, small tribe. It should be Spring Grass\u2019 father\u2019s tribe. It is right here, just a thousand kilometers away from us.\u201d\u201cYoung master, young master, we have to go pay a visit to the Blacktooth Tribe and see Spring Grass.\u201d Autumn Leaf said hurriedly.\u201cOf course we\u2019d have to go.\u201dNing nodded. \u201cBut we have to make an adventure of it. First we go here, then here, then here, and\u2026here!\u201d Ning pointed at one dangerous area after another, marked with black colors on the map.\u201cThose are all places where Diremonsters are hiding.\u201d Autumn Leaf cried out in shock.\u201cRight.\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes were shining. \u201cI\u2019m going to go kill some Diremonsters! Don\u2019t worry, the Diremonsters I\u2019ve picked out are all early Xiantian level ones. They are much weaker than Serpentwing. I\u2019ll fight them all, one after the other\u2026until the time comes when I break through and become a Xiantian lifeform myself. After I become a Xiantian lifeform, it will be time to go to Serpentwing Lake.\u201dAutumn Leaf said frantically, \u201cYoung master, Serpentwing is a late Xiantian level Diremonster.\u201d\u201cI have confidence.\u201d Ning said.The number one Fiendgod Body Refining method, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], had boundless strength. Right now, despite only being at the third stage, he could already equal an ordinary early Xiantian level Ki Refiner!Once he broke through to the fourth stage, he would be on par with a late Xiantian level Ki Refiner.Even if he fought Serpentwing head on, he would be on par. But in terms of enlightenment, he was far superior to Serpentwing.\u201cDiremonster. Serpentwing.\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes flashed with a hint of wildness. He couldn\u2019t forget the scene of how Serpentwing had suddenly attacked him. \u201cThis time, when I go out and adventure, my final goal is you. I hope you won\u2019t die before I reach you!\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The Ji clan of the West Prefecture made preparations to welcome the arrival of the quadrennial Ceremony of the Golden Sword. The promising youths which the countless tribes had been preparing were all filled with eagerness, and they registered for it, one after the other. They wanted to defeat one opponent after another at the ceremony and become dazzling, glorious personages. They wanted to let their names spread throughout the countless tribes!\u201cThis time, after the Ceremony of the Golden Sword, I am going to go back to the tribe. I am definitely going to make it into the top eight, so that I will be able to learn the techniques for training to reach the Xiantian level. That way, in my lifetime, I\u2019ll have the chance of becoming a Xiantian lifeform!\u201d A youngster with pitch black skin, carrying a single blade on his back and dressed in ragged beast furs, with two leather shoes on his feet that had been almost worn through.\u201cThe name of Tigerhowl shall definitely spread throughout all of the tribes of this land!\u201d\u201cI am the strongest!\u201d\u201cThis is my final chance to obtain a training manual for Immortal magic.\u201dAll the youths of the tribes were filled with their own desires, and they went to register for the Ceremony of the Golden Sword.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was a holy ceremony.A holy ceremony for countless tribal youths.The entire area under the dominion of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture and all of the young talents living in that area were going to participate in it. They desired to become famous, to obtain a profound Ki Refining technique from this Ceremony of the Golden Sword, or some other powerful techniques. These would become the powerful, awe-inspiring abilities they would rely on in the future.\u2026..\u201cWhat? Ji Ning is participating in the Ceremony of the Golden Sword?\u201d Ji Lee, who had just received this news, stared, and the scarlet viper looped in his ear also spoke. \u201cHe\u2019s only ten years old. He absolutely could wait another four years to participate in the Ceremony of the Golden Sword. Why is he participating now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, even if he fails, four years later, Ji Ning can try again.\u201d\u201cThey have two chances, but I can\u2019t fail even once.\u201d Ji Lee revealed a hint of a smile on his face. \u201cFortunately, back then, I took in my adoptive son, Grizzly.\u201dImmediately, Lee said to a nearby servant, \u201cHave Grizzly come and see me!\u201d\u201cYes, master.\u201d The barefoot female servant bowed, then quickly left.Soon afterwards, a tall young man wearing golden furs came striding in. This youngster had a very fierce aura. His face was covered with golden fur, and his eyes also had a faint gold look to them, unlike ordinary people. At all times, he carried a pitch black straight saber on his back.He strode in, and as he did\u2026he seemed like a skinny, golden grizzly bear. Although he was only thirteen, he was even slightly taller than Lee.\u201cFather.\u201d Grizzly called out respectfully.\u201cGrizzly.\u201d Lee looked at his adopted son, nodding in satisfaction. \u201cThe Ceremony of the Golden Sword is held once every four years. I will arrange for you to be registered in this year\u2019s Ceremony of the Golden Sword. I only have one request: Seize the golden sword!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Grizzly\u2019s voice was deep and thick.\u201cRight.\u201d Lee nodded with satisfaction. Of the many adoptive sons he had taken in, only a very few had made him satisfied, and amongst them, Grizzly was the one he was the most satisfied with. Lee had total confidence in Grizzly\u2019s abilities to prevent Ning from seizing the golden sword in this year\u2019s ceremony.Lee spoke again. \u201cThis time, the one you need to be careful of is the only son of Ji Yichuan \u2013 Ji Ning! Although he hasn\u2019t experienced any real life-and-death battles yet, he has still trained in the highest class techniques of our Ji clan. Although the techniques I taught you are also top-class, compared to his, they are still slightly inferior.\u201dGrizzly nodded.He understood. He was, after all, just an adopted son. But Ji Ning? He was the only son of the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan, and also the heir presumptive of the position of Prefecture Lord. The difference in status between the two was simply too great. Ning could easily obtain the ultimate techniques of the Ji clan, but he, an adopted child, couldn\u2019t possibly be permitted to learn the most powerful techniques of a clan.\u201cIn addition, Ning just reached the level of \u2018one with the sword\u2019 this year.\u201d Lee looked at his adoptive son. \u201cDon\u2019t be over-confident.\u201d\u201cI, your son, will definitely be victorious.\u201d Grizzly growled.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014The Ceremony of the Golden Sword began!Large numbers of tribal youths were at the bottom, fighting against each other wildly. One youth after another was cast out, with the stronger ones left behind. After a full month of battles, finally, the most powerful eight youths were selected. Or, to be more precise\u2026seven youths were selected. There was another person who was automatically registered as one of the final eight, without having to undergo any competitions. Ji Ning!Ji Ning, the only son of the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan! The most talented youngster of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture.According to what the Ji clan of the West Prefecture said to the outsiders, Ji Ning was so powerful that he didn\u2019t need to enter the competition at all. He could directly be included in the top eight.Anger?Injust?\u201cHrmph. On the last day, when he encounters the other seven experts, this Ji Ning will definitely be utterly thrashed.\u201d\u201cHe really will stoop to nothing!\u201d\u201cHe brings shame to the Ji clan!\u201dSome of the tribal youths muttered secretly amongst themselves. Only a very, very few of the tribal youths had heard the news that Ji Ning had already reached the level of \u2018one with the sword\u2019.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cHuahuahua\u2026.\u201d The battle flag flapped loudly.The desolate, cold wind extinguished the furious flames in the hearts of many, because today would be the final day of the Ceremony of the Golden Sword!At the center of the wide training fields, there was an enormous dueling platform, with eight tribal youths standing below it. One of them was the beast fur clad Ning. Outside was a large number of black armored riders who surrounded the dueling platform protectively, preventing any of the tens of thousands of tribal youths and citizens of the West Prefecture City who had come to watch the battles from drawing any closer to the dueling area.\u201cThey are here.\u201d\u201cThe Xiantian lifeforms have come.\u201dThe tens of thousands of spectators gathered here all became very excited. The Ceremony of the Golden Sword had proceeded for so long now, and usually, there weren\u2019t so many spectators. But today was special! Because today was the final day of the Ceremony of the Golden Sword, and the final eight competitors would, in the final contest, determine who was the most powerful and who would seize the golden sword.On the last day of the Ceremony of the Golden Sword, many legendary Xiantian lifeforms would also come and watch!\u201cThat person riding the long-necked monstrous beast, that\u2019s the Heavenly Firehammer.\u201d\u201cThe one riding that white tiger is the number one archer of our Ji clan of the West Prefecture!\u201d\u201cThat\u2026that\u2019s the Fire God, Ji Lee!\u201d\u201cLook, Raindrop sword! Over there, the one with a big, snow-white dog next to him is the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan! The big snow-white dog next to him is a Xiantian lifeform, the \u2018Whitewater Hound\u2019!\u201d\u201cPrefecture Lord!\u201d\u201cThe Prefecture Lord, Ji Young, has appeared as well!\u201d\u201cWhy are there so many Xiantian lifeforms present? There\u2019s too many of them!\u201d\u201cSo many Xiantian lifeforms!\u201d\u2026..Utter insanity. Utter pandemonium.The Ceremony of the Golden Sword was only held once every four years, after all. Generally speaking, only a few Xiantian lifeforms would come watch, but today, many legendary figures had come, such as the mysterious, rarely seen number one expert of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan. Or the man as wild and as arrogant as a Fire God, Ji Lee!The ten overseers had all come, not a single one of them missing.This was because this wasn\u2019t just a Ceremony of the Golden Sword. More importantly\u2026this was a test and skirmish which would determine who the next Prefecture Lord would be! As long as Ning was able to seize the golden sword, then he would be the next Prefecture Lord. Since this event involved something as important as who the next Prefecture Lord would be, almost all of the Xiantian lifeforms in the Ji clan of the West Prefecture naturally came to witness it.\u201cToday is the final day of the Ceremony of the Golden Sword.\u201d A cold voice rang out from a woman with long hair that gleamed with blue light who stood on the dueling platform. \u201cNow, let the eight youths ascend the platform.\u201dShua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!Eight shadows leapt onto the dueling platform in succession.Ning glanced at them and found that virtually all the seven other opponents were staring at him. Clearly, all seven of them felt disdain for him being allowed to directly be placed amongst the final eight without having to advance through the many tiers of battle like they had.\u201cDo you think I wanted it to be like this?\u201d Ning pursed his lips. It had totally been the decision of Prefecture Lord Young for him to be designated as one of the eight. \u201cHowever, these seven fellows really are tall. Even the shortest of them, a woman, is at least 1.7 meters, slightly taller than me\u2026ugh, and this big, stupid fellow is probably 2.3 meters tall.\u201dAlthough they were \u2018youths\u2019, all of them were very accomplished in their training, and most were almost sixteen. Only Ning was just ten years old. Naturally, he was the shortest of them.\u201cThe eight of you will fight each other, one at a time. The loser will leave, and the winner will remain, until four remain. And then, you will duel until only two remain, then finally, the strongest will be chosen.\u201d The long haired woman said.Ning and the other seven youths were listening.Suddenly\u2026\u201cHalt!\u201d A cold voice rang out.The spectating tribal youths and citizens of Ji clan of the West Prefecture all turned towards the sound of the voice. Even the long haired woman turned and frowned. She was a Xiantian level expert of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, and she had only come to officiate today because it was the final day. Who was causing such a ruckus at a time like this? She turned her head and saw\u2026that the speaker was a callous-looking man dressed in white fur.The long haired woman trembled.\u201cThe Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan.\u201d\u201cRaindrop Sword.\u201d\u201cThe Raindrop Sword looks like a giant iceberg, just standing there. I feel my heart growing cold just looking at him.\u201d The tens of thousands of spectators had excited looks in their eyes. All of the Xiantian experts present were like Fiendgods to them, but Ji Yichuan was the most dazzling expert in these lands, a legendary figure.Yichuan sat there and said coldly, \u201cThe final day of the Ceremony of the Golden Sword is for selecting the most powerful of the eight finalists to be the one to seize the golden sword. As I see it\u2026let Ji Ning fight the other seven!\u201d\u201cOne against seven?\u201d The long haired woman was stunned. \u201cBut\u2026but\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cOne against seven? The other seven are all highly talented youngsters.\u201d\u201cBut!\u201dA scene of utter shock.Even the Prefecture Lord, Ji Young, seated next to Yichuan, was amazed. As for the old man with the viper, Ji Lee, who sat on the other side of Ji Young, he immediately laughed loudly. \u201cWonderful. One against seven. Ji Ning is the most talented youngster in our Ji clan of the West Prefecture. Even if he loses, this would be a form of training for him. But Yichuan\u2026if your son loses his battle against the seven of them, then what?\u201d\u201cIf he loses, then he admits defeat, and has nothing to do with the golden sword!\u201d Yichuan said calmly.\u201cGood.\u201d Lee nodded.Ji Young looked at Yichuan curiously, then spoke out. \u201cLet it be as Yichuan has said.\u201d\u201cYes, Prefecture Lord.\u201d The long haired woman, seeing the situation, nodded. The two most powerful factions in the Ji clan of the West Prefecture had both agreed. Naturally, she had nothing to say about it. All she could do was inwardly sigh that the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan, was perhaps too arrogant.\u201cThe eight of you.\u201dThe long haired woman looked at the eight youths. \u201cCome here and select your weapons. After choosing your weapons\u2026wait for my order. Once I give the order, it will be Ji Ning fighting against the seventh of you. If Ji Ning loses, or if the seven of you lose\u2026then this combat will come to an end.\u201d\u201cHua.\u201d With a wave of her hand, the long haired woman made a large number of weapons appear out of nowhere onto the dueling platform. There were all types of weapons. Only, none of them were sharpened!\u201cChoose.\u201d The long haired woman said.Ning and the other seven youths all strode forward, quickly choosing their weapons. Ning chose a sturdy black longsword that weighed roughly fifty pounds.The tens of thousands of spectators below were all engaged in conversation. Many of them were only now seeing the \u2018Raindrop Sword\u2019, Ji Yichuan, for the first time. They felt as though Yichuan was like a piece of ancient, glacial ice, so cold that their hearts trembled. \u201cJi Yichuan is perhaps too arrogant and exacting, and he even treats his son the same way. One against seven? Even if Ji Ning\u2019s true power is beyond that of the other seven, how can he possibly beat all seven of them at once?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s truly insane.\u201d\u201cI hear that Ji Ning is only ten years old, but his father has already ordered him to come here and attend the Ceremony of the Golden Sword, and even wants him to fight one on seven. Poor fellow.\u201dMany of the spectators now began to feel sympathy for Ning. After all, Ning was the smallest and shortest of the eight youths on the dueling platform, and the youngest one as well. In addition, Ning was so handsome\u2026this slender, handsome youngster had a father who was so legendarily cold and severe. One could imagine how strictly this youngster\u2019s father usually governed him.\u201cAre you done choosing?\u201d The long haired woman looked at the eight youths.Seven of the youths were standing on one side of the dueling platform. They had their weapons ready, be it a sickle, a spear, a straight saber, or a sword. All of them stared at Ning.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOn the opposite side of the platform stood Ning, all by himself.Ning wielded a sword in his hands, staring calmly at them.\u201cSince you\u2019ve made your choices\u2026\u201d The long haired woman waved her hand, reclaiming the heap of blunt weapons that were on the side while saying, \u201cThen you can begin.\u201dJust as her words came out\u2026Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The seven figures on the other side of the platform moved over at high speed, simultaneously charging at Ning, who stood on the other side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8 \u2013 Ji Ning\u2019s SwordSeven figures attacked from seven different directions, pouncing towards Ji Ning en masse.Although they had not previously been prepared for a \u2018seven against one\u2019 battle, all of them were the most talented youths in the vast area under the control of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. Even if they were somewhat unhappy towards this young master of the Ji clan, they didn\u2019t dare to be the slightest bit contemptuous. As though by prior agreement, they all chosen to attack at full force!Ning stood there, not moving at all, waiting for the seven blurs to reach him. And when they did, he moved!Hu\u2026.As those weapons all flashed towards him, Ning moved like a gust of wind, demonstrating extreme accuracy and precision in terms of control, positioning, speed, and power\u2026easily dodging and moving through the combined attacks of the seven talented youths.\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cHe dodged?\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201dThe seven youths all halted, their eyes filled with disbelief. Just then, Ning actually hadn\u2019t even used his weapons. Just relying on footwork alone, he was able to easily dodge past their combined attacks. This sort of terrifying footwork\u2026demonstrated that so long as Ning was focused, the seven of them combined wouldn\u2019t be able to even touch Ning\u2019s clothes.\u201cSo fast.\u201d\u201cJust like a gust of wind.\u201d\u201cHe lives up to being the son of the Raindrop Sword. Too formidable. So fast that I couldn\u2019t even clearly see him; all I saw was a blur.\u201d The tens of thousands of spectators all grew excited. In this area, all the people began to train in childhood, so they all were experienced, and yet even most of them were only able to see a blur. One could imagine how fast Ning had moved.\u2026.Ning halted, standing on the other side of the dueling platform.\u201cSeven opponents were unable to force me to use my sword. Their footwork is inferior to mine.\u201d Ning swept the seven opponents with his gaze. Just now, during that brief moment of time, he had already assessed the footwork level these seven opponents were at. \u201cTwo of them are at the \u2018advanced\u2019 level. One is that scimitar wielding youth, while the other is the golden-furred beast. It seems the earlier reports were in error.\u201dAlthough his father was arrogant, Ning himself had sent people to collect details regarding these seven opponents. He only knew that the scimitar wielding youth had reached the advanced level of footwork. He didn\u2019t imagine that this golden-furred beast had also reached such a high level.\u201cBut their footwork is still a bit weaker than mine.\u201d Ning revealed a small smile.He had, after all, already reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level of footwork. Even though on this dueling platform, he would only utilize \u2018advanced\u2019 level footwork, his footwork was clearly more perfected. In addition, he trained in an extremely advanced [Shadewind Steps] type of footwork, allowing him to naturally seize an advantage.\u201cTie him down.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t give him the chance to utilize his footwork.\u201d\u201cAll together.\u201dThe seven youths once more charged forth.But Ning slowly walked towards them.In an instant, the seven youths and Ning once again collided. Swords and sabers flashed in the air, but Ning still moved as though he was taking a casual stroll. The longsword in his hands became like a whip, with all of his force being transmitted to the tip of the sword as he then viciously struck out. In order to reduce the amount of casualties as much as possible during the Ceremony of the Golden Sword, all of the weapons were blunt, and thus were more suited to chopping, sweeping, and whipping type attacks.Fast!Ning\u2019s sword was so fast as to make one\u2019s heart shudder.Ning gracefully walked out from the combined attacks of the seven, while at the same time, making seven lightning-fast whip-like attacks.Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!Five figures were sent flying backwards by the whip-strikes, flying over thirty meters before falling down onto the ground. All of them struggled to their feet, covered with dust. A few couldn\u2019t help but hold their chests, coughing out a hint of blood. Some had cuts on their faces, and their faces were filled with disbelief. This was because just then, they clearly had seen Ning attack with his sword, and they had tried to block it, but none of them had been able to touch Ning\u2019s sword.They hadn\u2019t even been able to touch it! Ning had sent them flying!\u201cOne with the sword!\u201d The five talented youths instantly knew what sort of level this young master Ji had reached in swordplay, and understood how great the gap was between them.Only three youths were left on the dueling platform.Black sword in hand, Ning looked at the nearby scimitar wielding youth and the golden-furred beast. He nodded to himself. \u201cI struck once against each of them, but these two were able to touch my sword. That scimitar wielding youth is very fast with his blade strikes, but he hasn\u2019t reached the \u2018advanced\u2019 level yet. That golden-furred beast\u2026has actually reached the advanced level of \u2018one with the saber\u2019.\u201d\u201cYoung master Ji, remember\u2026my name is Grizzly! Ji Grizzly!\u201d The golden-furred bestial man stared at Ji Ning. \u201cThe one who is going to defeat you is me, Grizzly!\u201dThe scimitar wielding youth\u2019s face changed slightly. \u201cSo I am not the strongest one after all in these many tribes. There are actually two who are stronger than me. Even this Grizzly has already reached the \u2018one with the saber\u2019 level.\u201dHe had been training painstakingly for many years in the martial pavilion.He knew that he was born into a low status and wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain the ultimate saber techniques, and thus he gave up focusing on any complicated saber techniques, and instead focused on making his saber \u2018fast\u2019! His saber\u2026had to be fast enough. The faster the better. He pursued the fastest possible attacks, combining them with his \u2018advanced\u2019 footwork\u2026if he used his saber, he definitely would be able to defeat the other youths.But now he discovered to his amazement that it wasn\u2019t just this son of the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan, who was stronger than him. The virtually unknown golden-furred fellow next to him was stronger than him as well.\u201cJi Ning.\u201d The scimitar wielding youth suddenly growled. \u201cI know you are stronger than me, but I want you to take three saber blows from me! Just take these three saber blows of mine alone\u2026as for you, Grizzly, don\u2019t interfere.\u201dGrizzly stood there disdainfully, a cold smile on his face. This scimitar wielding youth was far weaker than him, and what\u2019s more, Ning\u2019s footwork was simply too formidable, and there was no way to successfully do a combined attack on him anyhow. So he might as well let this scimitar wielding youth seek his own humiliation.Ning, as though thinking about something, glanced at the scimitar wielding youth. He had the feeling that this scimitar wielding youth\u2019s words had some special belief hidden within.\u201cAlright.\u201d Ning nodded.\u201cHua!\u201dThe scimitar wielding youth charged forward like a blur, howling. His eyes were as vicious as that of a wolf\u2019s, and as he drew near Ning, his scimitar came out! The scimitar gleamed brilliantly, and the very first saber-blow was directed towards Ning\u2019s neck. Logically speaking, since the scimitar was blunt, this sort of slashing technique wasn\u2019t very suitable.But clearly, this scimitar wielding youth wanted to demonstrate his strongest, ultimate attacks.\u201cRetreat.\u201d Ning moved like the wind, taking a step back, allowing the scimitar to howl past his body.\u201cChi!\u201dSuddenly, with the flip of his hand, the scimitar wielding youth launched another attack, and this saber-blow was even faster, slashing towards Ning\u2019s neck from the opposite direction. With leap, Ning still managed to dodge, but he even he felt it was a bit difficult. If he continued to use \u2018advanced\u2019 level footwork and the opponent\u2019s scimitar moved any faster, Ning would have to use his sword.\u201cSwish!\u201d The flashing blade suddenly left his hand, moving even faster, arriving close to Ning\u2019s eyes in an instant.The third saber-blow \u2013 The flying saber!The flying saber was spinning in the air, and borrowed the speed from those two earlier attacks, allowing this final flying saber attack to reach an even more incredible speed. Not hesitating at all, Ning attacked with his sword.\u201cClang.\u201d The scimitar and the sword intersected, and the scimitar immediately was sent flying away, landing back into the hands of the scimitar wielding youth.The scimitar wielding youth nodded. \u201cI lose.\u201dAnd then with a leap, he jumped down from the dueling platform. The scimitar wielding youth knew\u2026that this Ji Ning and himself simply weren\u2019t on the same level at all. Even aside from the fact that Ji Ning trained in the ultimate sword techniques of the Ji clan, the simple fact that he had reached the \u2018one with the sword\u2019 level made it impossible for the youth to do anything to Ji Ning. He was already very satisfied with being given the chance to show off his most powerful attacks on this dueling platform.\u201cRecruit that scimitar wielding youth into the Ji clan!\u201d The distant, spectating Ji Young said to one of his personal servants standing behind him. \u201cHe has the potential to reach the Xiantian level.\u201dYes, master.\u201d\u2026.The dueling platform only had Ning and Grizzly left.Grizzly\u2019s eyes flashed with golden light, staring from afar at Ning, while at the same time, his entire body began to glow with a faint gold light as well, and a powerful aura began to emit from him. This caused the distant Ning\u2019s eyes to narrow. \u201cThis Grizzly is also a Fiendgod Body Refiner? It seems he\u2019s reached quite a high level as well.\u201d\u201cJi Ning.\u201d Grizzly growled. \u201cI admit that your footwork is superior to mine! But today, we must determine who the strongest person is, and you won\u2019t be able to acquire the golden sword just by fleeing! You must fight me head on, but unfortunately, if you fight me head out, you aren\u2019t a match for me at all. You will definitely lose!\u201dBlack sword in hand, Ning looked calmly at his opponent.From Grizzly\u2019s ferocious aura, Ning could predict that this Grizzly had definitely gone through life-and-death battles. With his sabercraft having reached the \u2018one with the saber\u2019 level, and that layer of golden life demonstrating that he had trained in a powerful type of Fiendgod Body Refining technique, if Ning\u2019s guess was correct, this Grizzly should have trained in the [Eternal Mysteries of the Yellow Earth]. After all, he had reviewed all of the nineteen books on Fiendgod Body Refining which the Ji clan\u2019s five prefectures had.\u201d\u201cThis person called Grizzly has encountered many life-and-death battles, and is a Fiendgod Body Refiner who has reached the \u2018one with the saber\u2019 level. But he doesn\u2019t have any reputation at all.\u201d Ning secretly mused. \u201cHe definitely wasn\u2019t born in the tribes. He should belong to the Ji clan\u2026nine out of ten says that he is someone whom the viperous Ji Lee cultivated and intentionally kept hidden.\u201d\u201cAfraid?\u201d Grizzly, saber in hand, stared like a hungry tiger at Ning. He didn\u2019t make any movement to go attack Ning of his own volition.Ning, wielding his black sword, began to walk forward in a very calm, natural way, as though taking a stroll in his own home. If he had encountered Grizzly before suffering from Serpentwing\u2019s attack, Ning would perhaps be a bit more trouble, but in the months which had passed since suffering from Serpentwing\u2019s attack, the swordplay of Ning, who had reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level in footwork, had increased dramatically as well.To reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level in footwork, one needed to spend time training. The same was true for reaching the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level in swordplay. Although Ning had yet to reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level in swordplay, Ning\u2019s swordplay was no longer what it had been mere months ago. He didn\u2019t even need to utilize the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] in order to easily defeat this Grizzly.Ning\u2019s sword suddenly moved!\u201cHu!\u201d The sword was as graceful as the rain, descending in an instant.Beautiful to behold.When a killing sword technique could transform into a beautiful sight, it showed that the wielder had already reached an extremely deep level of skill.\u201cBreak apart!\u201d Grizzly roared as he wielded his saber, which flashed with the thickness of blood as one enormous saber-flash after another flew towards Ning. In the blink of an eye, it was though Hell had descended\u2026those enormous flashes of saber-light were the punishing blades of hell, causing one to feel hopeless and as though they deserved to stand there and die beneath those saber flashes.\u201cBloodhell Saber?\u201d Ning\u2019s sword swept out like a gentle sprinkling of rain.His flashing sword flowed together into one stream like rainwater which drizzled down, ensnaring Grizzly. No matter how wild and explosive Grizzly\u2019s Bloodhell Saber techniques were, that drizzling flow of water continued to ensnare it, making it lose its wild, explosive aura.Grizzly felt as though he had suddenly become trapped in a prison of water. There was water everywhere, wildly ensnaring him. He clearly possessed boundless strength, but he wasn\u2019t able to utilize it against the water.\u201cBreak!\u201d Grizzly\u2019s saberplay was incomparably wild. Even though he was constantly being ensnared, he still didn\u2019t hesitate one bit, only growing even more ferocious.\u201cYour saberplay is indeed strong.\u201d Ning said gently.An opponent of this level wasn\u2019t a threat to him at all. Only, the fact that this Grizzly\u2019s saberplay was developed in life-and-death battles was a source of interest to Ning, which was why Ning was willing to exchange ten blows with him to accumulate some experience. Ning knew very well\u2026that compared to some of the elder experts of the clan, what he lacked the most was sufficient experience.\u201cHua.\u201dThe black longsword in Ning\u2019s hands suddenly thrust forward in a straight attack, and instantly, it seemed as though the entire world grew silent. The hazily glowing sword seemed to have transformed into a single drop of rain. This raindrop pierced past the saber, and as it did, the saber shattered. The raindrop then smashed against Grizzly\u2019s chest, like a raindrop falling against a stone. Pa! The faint sound of bones splintering could be heard as Grizzly was sent flying several dozen meters, smashing viciously against the floor beneath the dueling platform, causing a small crater in the earth.Raindrop Sword \u2013 Raindrop Pierces Rocks!\u201cUgh.\u201d Grizzly clutched his chest, spewing out a mouthful of fresh blood.He lowered his head to look at his chest. The fur of the Xiantian-level beast which he wore had split open, and his chest had caved in, his bones broken. And this was with Ning using a very ordinary, blunt black longsword.\u2026..The tens of thousands of spectators watching the training area all fell silent\u2026and then, there was an earth-shaking commotion. They were all in awe. This truly was the son of the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan. No wonder the Raindrop Sword had dared to be so wildly arrogant as to have his son fight seven others\u2026this seemingly handsome, inexperienced young master Ji was simply too terrifying, to easily be able to dominate these seven opponents.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d The Prefecture Lord, Ji Young, let out a loud, carefree laugh, incomparably happy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe won.His lineage had won. Ji Ning had seized the golden sword, and would become the next Prefecture Lord.\u201cRaindrop Pierces Rocks! The advanced level in swordplay!\u201d Sitting next to him, Ji Lee suddenly clenched his right hand, and the stone armrest his hand was resting on was shattered and cracked.\u201cSecond brother.\u201d Prefecture Lord Young turned to look at his second brother.Lee looked at the Prefecture Lord, his senior brother. His face changing, he said in a low voice, \u201cAdvanced swordplay\u2026he\u2019s only ten, but his swordplay is already \u2018advanced\u2019, and he has reached the level of \u2018expertise\u2019 in the [Raindrop Sutra], one of the five major sword techniques of the Ji clan! He is even more of a monster than his father. Senior brother, first your lineage produced Ji Yichuan, and now, your lineage produced a Ji Ning. Heaven has shown it does not favor me. I have lost, and I have nothing more to say!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9 \u2013 The Traceless TalismanPrefecture Lord Ji Young spoke out, \u201cSecond brother, listen to me!\u201d\u201cBig brother.\u201d Ji Lee closed his eyes, and then opened them and growled fiercely, \u201cNo need to say anything else. From today onwards, Ji Ning is the heir to the Prefecture Lord position of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. I, Ji Lee, will definitely be prepared to come when he calls, and will be faithful and loyal as I go out and do battle on behalf of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. I will not be the slightest bit rebellious. I thoroughly admire and submit to Ji Ning. But you\u2026I simply do not admire and submit to you at all!\u201dLee hurriedly turned and left.\u201cFather.\u201d Ji Jadewich, seated next to him, called out, hurriedly following after him.Young watched quietly as Lee left, but he had a hint of a smile on his face. He knew very well that his second brother, Ji Lee, had a fierce temper. Lee was an extremely combative man. He would submit to those who were powerful, but he would never do so to one who was weak! Ever since they were young, in terms of power, he, Young, had been inferior to his second brother. Naturally, Lee had never submitted to him. But Lee had once said\u2026if Ji Yichuan were to become Prefecture Lord, he wouldn\u2019t voice a single word of complaint.Now that Ning had showed that he was even more of a monster than his father Yichuan, and had in such an awe-inspiring manner defeated seven opponents to seize the golden sword, Lee naturally admired and submitted to him in the same manner.If he submitted, he submitted!If he didn\u2019t submit, he didn\u2019t submit!He, Ji Lee, had never admired or submitted to his big brother, Ji Young.\u2026..Sunset.The Snowfall Palace of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture had put on a feast. The settling of the identity of the next Prefecture Lord was an event of enormous importance to the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. After Young stepped down, Ning would assume his position and also become one of the overseers. As for Young, being both a Xiantian lifeform and the previous Prefecture Lord, he would also become an overseer.The Ji clan of the West Prefecture had in total ten major overseers. Any affairs which had a major impact on the destiny of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture were all decided together by the ten overseers. Once Ning assumed his position, the weakest of the current ten overseers would have to step down! The structure of power would completely change. One could foresee how much power would be gained by the current, principal lineage.\u201cWu Sa, Wu Sa Ya!\u201dIn the center of the palace, more than thirty barefoot and half-naked fur-clad young women were dancing.In the area behind the two rows on each side of the palace, there were musicians playing instruments such as drums, pipes, ocarinas, and other such instruments. The sound of the musical instruments were occasionally somber while occasionally lively, reverberating throughout the palace. Within this palace, the most powerful people within the Ji clan of the West Prefecture were currently clustered together, toasting each other and laughing loudly.Ning, as the heir apparent to the Prefecture Lord position, had his own seat as well. In front of him, there was a table that was filled with all sorts of delicious food.\u201cHuahuahua\u2026\u201d A fur-clad young lady was standing to the side, holding a large urn of wine. Seeing that Ning\u2019s beastskull cup was empty, she hurriedly filled it. The urn of wine weighed dozens of pounds, but the young fur-clad lady didn\u2019t spill a single drop of wine as she poured.\u201cIt truly has its own unique charm.\u201d Watching, Ji Ning shook his head dizzily.There was more than one person seated next to Ning.Ji Yichuan was naturally seated on his knees in the middle of the table, with Yuchi Snow by his side, while a large, snow-white dog was on his other side. It was the Godbeast, \u2018Whitewater Hound\u2019.The people qualified to have their own individual seats here in the Snowfall Palace were all people of extremely high status in the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. Even Ning\u2019s mother, Snow, had to be brought in her capacity as the wife of Yichuan, as she herself wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been qualified to have her own seat.\u2026..All of the Xiantian lifeforms had brought either their family or the spirit-beasts they had tamed.Soon, it was nightfall, and the musicians and dancers all depart, and even the female servants and attendants were dismissed as well. It was the time to talk about some major affairs. If they were talking about extremely important, secret matters, even spirit-beasts and family members would have to leave.\u201cEveryone.\u201d Prefecture Lord Young laughed. \u201cToday, the Ceremony of the Golden Sword was concluded. Ning, at the age of ten, defeated seven combatants by himself and seized the golden sword. Naturally, he has become the next heir to the position of Prefecture Lord. However, Ning is still young\u2026it\u2019s best to have him wait a while longer and gain more experience before taking the Prefecture Lord position. As I see it, let\u2019s wait until he is twenty. What do you think, everyone?\u201d\u201cAgreed.\u201d\u201cAgreed.\u201d\u201cNing\u2019s talent is no lower than Yichuan\u2019s. He is very suitable for being selected as the next Prefecture Lord.\u201d Another overseer nodded. Not even a single objection was raised, including from those on Ji Lee\u2019s side.Yichuan, seated off to the side, revealed a rare smile. \u201cPrefecture Lord.\u201d\u201cYichuan, what is it?\u201d Young looked towards him.\u201cI wish to ask for an item for my son.\u201d Yichuan said.Young was puzzled. \u201cWhat item?\u201d\u201cThe Traceless Talisman!\u201d Yichuan said solemnly. As soon as his words came out, the entire hall fell silent. Many of the Xiantian-level people stared at each other in surprise.\u201cThe Traceless Talisman?\u201d Young frowned as he looked at Ning, then asked, \u201cNing, you want the Traceless Talisman?\u201dSitting there holding his wine-filled beastskull goblet, Ning was startled. Glancing at his father, he nodded. \u201cRight.\u201dYichuan said, \u201cNing is the next Prefecture Lord. He should be able to request this Traceless Talisman, right?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Young nodded, and then took a deep breath. With a flip of his hand, a strange jade talisman, glittering with jade light, appeared in his palm. This jade talisman was covered with complicated diagrams and illegible words, and it emanated strange, faint waves of energy which caused the area around it to seemingly distort. With a toss, Young tossed the item directly to Yichuan. \u201cYichuan, this Traceless Talisman is one of the guardian treasures of our Ji clan of the West Prefecture. It must not be used carelessly.\u201dYichuan nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Late night. On the road back from Snowfall Palace, Ning and his parents, as well as the Whitewater Hound, were walking together.\u201cFather. Mother.\u201d Ning said, puzzled. \u201cWhat is the Traceless Talisman. What do you want it for, Father?\u201dSnow laughed as she looked at her son. \u201cThis is the reason why your father said he would only permit you to leave if you participated in the Ceremony of the Golden Sword and seized the golden sword. Because only after seizing the golden sword and settling the question of your position as heir to the Prefecture Lord position would you be able to acquire one of the guardian treasures, the \u2018Traceless Talisman\u2019.\u201dYichuan said with a cold face, \u201cThe Traceless Talisman is an extremely valuable talisman. Three hundred years ago, one of the ancestors of our Ji clan of the West Prefecture, thanks to good luck, managed to acquire it. Back then, he acquired three of them, but he used up two of them\u2026and now only this last one is remaining, and it has become the guardian treasure of our prefecture.\u201d\u201cWhat use does it have?\u201d Ning asked.Yichuan laughed. \u201cAs long as you utilize the \u2018Traceless Talisman\u2019, you can instantly travel to any place within ten thousand kilometers.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Ning was shocked. Instantly travel to any location within ten thousand kilometers?\u201cA talisman like this is something you can\u2019t even purchase if you wanted to, and our ancestor was only able to acquire it through luck.\u201d Yichuan sighed. \u201cTo our Ji clan, obtaining a treasure of this level\u2026is our absolute good fortune. You are the next Prefecture Lord, and thus I used that to acquire this \u2018Traceless Talisman\u2019 without anyone being able to object.\u201dAfter speaking, with a flip of his hand, Yichuan withdrew a jade shortsword that was gleaming with a bloody light, handing it to Ning. \u201cThis jade sword was only completed after being immersed in my blood for a long time. No matter how distant you are, I will be able to sense the location of this jade sword. This time, when you go out adventuring, keep it within you at all times. Remember, as soon as you meet any danger, immediately break this jade sword. When you break the jade sword, I will immediately know, and I will immediately use the \u2018Traceless Talisman\u2019 to instantly teleport to you and save your life.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Ning instantly understood the reason why his father needed this Traceless Talisman.Yichuan barked at him, \u201cOn this adventuring trip, you are not permitted to go too far from the West Prefecture City. This Traceless Talisman has a maximum range of only ten thousand kilometers. Through sensing the location of the jade sword, I\u2019ll know how far away you are. If I sense that you have moved more than ten thousand kilometers away from the West Prefecture City, I will immediately head towards you, capture you, bring you back, and imprison you in the underground prison for three years!\u201dNing rubbed his eyes. Imprisoned for three years in the underground prison? The forever dark underground prison, where the sunlight never shone, was the place where felons and those who were to be executed were held by the Ji clan of the West Prefecture.\u201cYour son will definitely remember.\u201d Ning hurriedly said.Ten thousand kilometers?More than enough. After all, the area which the Ji clan of the West Prefecture controlled was only a few thousand kilometers. If he kept heading west, he would enter the territory of one of the other local hegemons.\u201cNing, son.\u201d Snow asked with concern. \u201cWhen do you plan to head out and go adventuring?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make some quick preparations first.\u201d Ning nodded. \u201cThree days from now.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Three days passed in the blink of an eye.Dawn. The sky was barely lit. Within Ning\u2019s room.\u201cNing, son, take these with you.\u201d With a wave of Snow\u2019s hand, atop Ning\u2019s bed, two large sets of beast fur clothing as well as some other miscellaneous items appeared out of nowhere.\u201cMother.\u201d Ning couldn\u2019t help but say. \u201cI\u2019ve already prepared everything. Clothing, food, tools.\u201dYichuan snapped coldly, \u201cIf we tell you to take it, then take it. Your mother personally stitched every single one of these items with her own hands.\u201dNing\u2019s heart shook. He couldn\u2019t help but glance at his mother. Yuchi Snow\u2019s gaze remained on her son, and Ning could clearly sense the boundless, infinite love within his mother\u2019s gaze\u2026ever since he was young, his mother had taken care of him in every way possible. It was like he was everything to her. For him to go adventuring, his mother most likely was truly frightened for him.As the saying goes, \u2018When the son travels far, his mother worries at home.\u2019 What\u2019s more, this time he was going out to adventure.\u201cFather.\u201d Ning had a serious thought. He hurriedly asked, \u201cThis time, when I go out, will Ji Lee secretly\u2026\u201d\u201cHe will not.\u201d Yichuan said coldly. \u201cThe reason why our Ji clan has been able to remain in existence in this part of the world for so long is because of our internal unity. We absolute forbid infighting. Anyone who violates this would suffer the pursuit and slaughter of all five prefectures of the Ji clan! In addition, I understand Lee\u2019s personality very well. He just doesn\u2019t want to submit to Prefecture Lord Young, but in his heart, he still holds the matters of the Ji clan in the highest regard. In addition, his arrogance is bred into his bones. He disdains doing such things.\u201dNing nodded as though he had understood something.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Ji Lee.\u201d Yichuan barked. \u201cWhat you need to worry more about are those Diremonsters. Diremonsters all possess different innate powers and also have different tactics. Even the Xiantian level experts of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture will often die, much less you, who have not even reached the Xiantian level!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say such things.\u201d Snow said hurriedly. \u201cOur son is about to go out adventuring. Say something more pleasant. Ning, son, Mother has one more thing to give you.\u201d As she spoke, a golden book appeared in her hands. The pages seemed made from gold leaf, and on top of the book there were four ancient-looking words: [Wind Wing Evasion Technique].\u201cThis is a set of footwork techniques, and this is also the most precious Immortal training manual which Mother has. Wait until you become a Xiantian lifeform before reading it.\u201d Snow instructed. \u201cAlso, you are not permitted to teach it to any other member of the Ji clan.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes.\u201d Ning nodded.The [Shadewind Steps] which his mother had taught him was something which only his mother knew! This was because even the Ji clan didn\u2019t possess that footwork technique, so his mother had instructed him\u2026that he was forbidden from teaching the [Shadewind Steps] to the other members of the Ji clan. This [Windwing Evasion] technique was also possessed by his mother alone, and thus she was forbidding him from teaching it to other members of the Ji clan.\u201cAlright. You can head out now.\u201d Yichuan spoke. \u201cIf you are going to leave, then leave. Be straightforward about it.\u201d\u201cFather. Mother. I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d Ning looked at his parents.And then, with a turn of his head, he left. Outside, Mowu and his female maidservant, Autumn Leaf, were waiting for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This beast was shaped like a leopard, and its body was covered with faint leopard-type patterns. It had a single horn on its head. This was an extremely ferocious type of beast. It could clamber up mountains like flat land, and was extremely fast. It was an excellent mount, but of course, it was a bit inferior to a tamed monstrous beast.Given Ning\u2019s status, he was being quite low-key in riding this sort of mount.\u201cWest Prefecture City.\u201d Ning turned and looked back, staring at the distant, enormous city. He had lived there ever since he was young.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Ning shouted.With a kick to the waist of the mounted beast, the mounted beast immediately leapt forward at a gallop, while Autumn Leaf and Mowu hurriedly rode their own black ferobeasts behind.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Winter left. Spring came.On a grassy area within a mountain village, there were dozens of fur-clad men moving forward happily, half of them carrying burdens on shoulder poles.\u201cUncle Dala!\u201d A clearly inexperienced, spear-wielding youngster called out excitedly, \u201cBefore this, you never let us visit Eastmount Marsh, and you said that Eastmount Marsh was extremely dangerous. But this time\u2026we encountered no danger at all, and we managed to catch so many fish. It will be enough for our tribe to eat for a long time.\u201dA heroic, bear-like figure next to him laughed, \u201cAh Yi, you brought us good luck. This time to Eastmount Marsh, not a single tribesman died. This is very rare. However, don\u2019t underestimate Eastmount Marsh. Eastmount Marsh is one of the places in this area with the most Diremonsters within an area of ten thousand square kilometers. But of course, the fish in Eastmount Marsh are boundless in number as well.\u201cAh Yi, this is the first time you\u2019ve gone fishing with us. After a few more trips, you\u2019ll know how dangerous it is. When we go back, you need to exercise more and refine your ki. Only when you are strong will you be able to live a longer life.\u201d A one-armed man next to them laughed.\u201cAh Yi isn\u2019t a child anymore. This time, when we go back, we need to find a woman for Ah Yi. Let\u2019s get some good furs and go to one of the neighboring tribes to exchange them for a fertile woman with big buttocks.\u201d\u201cGet a few more women, so they can birth a few more childrens.\u201dThe older men were all teasing this youth.Just at this time, from the brambles and bushes nearby, a monstrous beast with black fur was lying in wait. Its fur was extremely smooth, and the contours of its body were sleek and soft. It seemed like a panther of some sort. A faint hint of green could be seen in its eyes, and its body was nearly seven meters long. Its furry mane was extremely tough, and it was shaped like a ring of circular spikes.It was waiting. Waiting for an opportunity.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019ll find one for myself.\u201d Ah Yi was a bit embarrassed, and his face was turning red. He hastily called out.\u201cHaha, he\u2019s shy.\u201dThe older men laughed.Suddenly\u2026\u201cRoaaaar!\u201d A black blur suddenly pounced over, pouncing directly towards the closest tribesman, a man who was holding a carrying pole.\u201cMonster!\u201d The other tribesmen hurriedly roared in anger, and the spears in their hands thrust out. They had painstakingly trained since their youth, and had been refining their internal energy for dozens of years, and now possessed great strength. \u201cBang!\u201d The enormous black blur\u2019s claws easily swept aside the spears, knocking them to one side.\u201cQuick.\u201d\u201cKill.\u201dThe surrounding tribesmen all roared with anger, thrusting out with their spears as well. As a small tribe, they didn\u2019t possess any profound Immortal techniques, making spear and polearm type weapons extremely popular amongst them. So long as they trained a few simple movements every day, after a few dozen years, their power would still be extraordinary.\u201cHua!\u201d Stepping on the polearms, the enormous black blur easily leapt up and pounced towards the center of the group of tribesmen.These tribesmen often went to Eastmount Marsh to fish, and thus they selected a fairly safe return path, one which rarely encountered monstrous beasts. But caution was bred into their bones, and so the tribesmen with the carrying poles were all in the center, while the powerful tribal warriors with weapons at the ready were on the outer perimeter.\u201cA monster!\u201d The one-armed man called out hurriedly. \u201cCareful.\u201d As he spoke, he brandished his single blade, pouncing towards the massive black blur.\u201cMonster, die!\u201d The most powerful of the tribal warriors, the bear-like, \u2018Uncle Dala\u2019, also brandished his long greataxe as he threw himself towards the black blur.\u201cKill!\u201dThe nearby tribesmen were all going crazy.All of them knew how powerful Bi\u2019an Tigers were. Just then, six powerful warriors had surrounded and attacked this Bi\u2019an Tiger, but it had easily stepped on their weapons and jumped into their center, causing them all to understand\u2026that this was most likely an extremely terrifying monstrous beast that had already reached the peak of the Houtian level. Today, it was possible that several of them would die.\u201cGrrrrrrrrrr.\u201d The Bi\u2019an Tiger roared angrily. Unlike before, where it moved quickly, this time it stayed where it was, attacking wildly.Clang!The one-armed man was sent flying backwards by the collision, while Uncle Dala continued to chop downwards with his greataxe while roaring wildly. The Bi\u2019an Tiger had also noticed that this greataxe wielding human was the most dangerous of the group, and so he didn\u2019t pay any attention to the other tribal warriors, using his sharp claws to smash directly against the greataxe, causing its trajectory to be altered. However, the greataxe still landed on the flank of the Bi\u2019an Tiger, chopping out a massive wound. Only, the Bi\u2019an Tiger\u2019s muscles around its flank tightened, and very little blood flowed out. The main problem was that the greataxe hadn\u2019t landed a deep enough blow. At the same time the Bi\u2019an Tiger batted the greataxe aside, roaring, the Bi\u2019an Tiger opened its massive maw and bit down towards Uncle Dala.\u201cUncle Dala.\u201d The somewhat stupefied youngster, Ah Yi, was stunned and called out.\u201cDala!\u201d\u201cDala!\u201dThe surrounding tribesmen were all worried as well.Suddenly\u2026\u201cShua!\u201d Something flashed past like a glittering meteor from afar, instantly penetrating the Bi\u2019an Tiger\u2019s skull, then flying out from the other side before penetrating into a giant tree\u2026and then shot out from the other side of the tree as well.\u201cGrrr\u2026\u201dUncle Dala fell to the ground, with the massive body of the Bi\u2019an Tiger on top of him, blood covering Uncle Dala\u2019s face.\u201cUncle Dala.\u201d The youngster, Ah Yi, immediately ran over. He was at the verge of tears.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d That powerful tribesman pushed the Bi\u2019an Tiger off, then stood up while rubbing his face, finding that it was covered with blood. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my blood. It is the Bi\u2019an Tiger\u2019s blood.\u201dThe one armed man walked over and took a glance as well, first looking at the corpse of the Bi\u2019an Tiger, and then at the nearby tree. His pupils contracted, and he whispered, \u201cFor an arrow to pierce through the rock-hard skull of the Bi\u2019an Tiger, and then through the black arrowwood tree\u2026that\u2019s simply terrifying. In addition, the Bi\u2019an Tiger suffered the arrow in mid-leap. This archery skill\u2026\u201d\u201cDefinitely a godly archer.\u201d\u201cA godly archer shot this arrow.\u201d All of the tribesmen stared at the corpse of the Bi\u2019an Tiger, then looked afar into the general direction from which the arrow had come from and where the godly archer must be.Hua! Hua! Hua!Three figures drew from deep within the mountain forests. The tribesmen watched carefully\u2026and soon, they were able to see them clearly. Three people, riding extremely handsome black ferobeasts. The black ferobeasts moved through the mountain slopes as though they were travelling on flat land, and quickly arrived before the tribesmen.\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d Seeing the three people in front of them, all the tribesmen were awestruck.They were riding handsome black ferobeasts, and wore extremely meticulous, beautifully made beast fur clothes. The person in front was a seemingly very young and handsome young man, while by his side was an extremely beautiful girl. The men could swear to themselves\u2026that they couldn\u2019t find such a girl as beautiful as this one in their entire tribe. Although she was dressed in warrior\u2019s clothes, it couldn\u2019t hide her beauty. As for the man on the other side of the youngster, he emitted a fierce, ferocious aura, causing the hearts of these tribesmen to quail.\u201cHu.\u201d The older man leapt down from his black ferobeast, walking over to the tall, thick black arrowwood tree, snatching out the arrow.\u201cYoung master.\u201d The man walked next to the youngster, respectfully offering him the arrow.Ji Ning accepted it.Although they had prepared many arrows for this adventuring expedition, if they abandoned every arrow they shot out, they probably would run out of arrows soon. These were all extremely good arrows\u2026they could be used multiple times.\u201cHonored young master.\u201d The one-armed tribesman went forward, respectfully bowing. \u201cThank you for acting to save us. Might I ask if there is some way in which our Metalstone Tribe can serve you, young master?\u201dThe other tribesmen didn\u2019t dare to make a sound.Someone who brought a maidservant and a manservant while adventuring\u2026this clearly was no ordinary person. And in addition, he had been referred to as \u2018young master\u2019 earlier. Someone who was respectfully addressed as \u2018young master\u2019 was generally the son of a tribal chief of a major tribe with tens of thousands of tribesmen. Clearly, this youngster should belong to an extremely large tribe.\u201cAre you familiar with Eastmount Marsh?\u201d Ning, riding on the black ferobeast, asked them.The tribesmen looked at each other.Why was this young master going to Eastmount Marsh? He definitely couldn\u2019t be going there for fishing like they had, right? It would definitely be very dangerous.\u201cI am.\u201d The powerful, dark-skinned Uncle Dala strode forward. \u201cI have been fishing in Eastmount Marsh for dozens of years now, and am very familiar with this place. Young master, if you wish to go to Eastmount Marsh, I can lead the way for you.\u201d\u201cExcellent.\u201d Ning, mounted on the black ferobeast, laughed ,and then with a flip of his hand, tossed over a \u2018beasthead\u2019 of gold. \u201cCome with me, then.\u201dAccepting the beasthead of gold, Uncle Dala\u2019s eyes instantly lit up. This beasthead of gold, weighing exactly ten pounds, would be more than enough for his child to live off of for the rest of his life. He immediately gave it to the nearby one armed man. \u201cHelp me take it back and give it to my eldest son. If I die, then help me take care of my three little kids.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The one armed man nodded.\u201cReport your name.\u201d Ning said.\u201cHonored young master, you can address me as Dala!\u201d Uncle Dala said respectfully.\u201cDala, mount on her black ferobeast.\u201d Ning pointed to Autumn Leaf\u2019s mount. \u201cAutumn Leaf, you come sit with me.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201dAutumn Leaf leapt down, then immediately mounted Ning\u2019s black ferobeast, then held her arms around Ning\u2019s waist. She had served Ning since he was born, and they were as close to each other as real siblings. In addition, as Ning\u2019s personal maidservant, it was essentially determined long ago that she was Ning\u2019s woman, and thus there were no taboos between them.Uncle Dala, holding his breath, carefully mounted the black ferobeast. He had never ridden on such a fine mount before.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dNing ordered.Hua!Ning and the others rode the black ferobeasts, quickly disappearing into the mountain forests.\u201cUncle Saber.\u201d The youngster, Ah Yi, asked frantically. \u201cUncle Dala is going to take them to the Eastmount Marsh. Will it be dangerous?\u201dThe one-armed man nodded. \u201cThey aren\u2019t like us. That youngsters is definitely the son of a leader of a large tribe, and has received the finest instruction since he was young. That arrow was probably loosed by him. He has most likely come to Eastmount Marsh for a rite-of-passage adventure! He has to kill a certain number of monstrous beasts, but Eastmount Marsh is too large and too complicated an area. Just relying on a simple map isn\u2019t sufficient, so they asked for Uncle Dalat to help lead the way.\u201d\u201cRites-of-passage? But that youngster isn\u2019t an adult yet.\u201d Ah Yi said.\u201cSome people look older than their age, others look younger.\u201d The one armed man said.Actually, right now, Ning was just eleven years old, although he was already 1.7 meters tall, the same height he was in his past life.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBut that young master was very benevolent.\u201d The one armed man sighed. \u201cJust then, when the Bi\u2019an Tiger ambushed us, if that young master hadn\u2019t intervened\u2026several of us probably would have died, and the first to die would have been your Uncle Dala! Having had his life saved, your Uncle Dala would go guide them, even if it cost him his life. In addition, the young master gave him a beasthead of gold. Ten pounds!\u201d\u201cHurry, hurry, hurry.\u201d The one armed man suddenly shouted. \u201cButcher that Bi\u2019an Tiger\u2019s corpse and take it back.\u201d\u201cQuick.\u201d\u201cCome.\u201dOne after another pulled out their knives and hatchets, quickly butchering the Bi\u2019an Tiger\u2019s corpse, and then they continued on their return trip.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At one glance, one could see flying beasts diving down and snatching up fish, or some tails of enormous aquatic creatures wriggling amongst the reeds. Occasionally, a massive head would be seen. This was the world of monsters!\u201cEastmount Marsh.\u201d Ning murmured. \u201cWe\u2019re finally here.\u201dEastmount Marsh was located between the territory of the Ji clan and the Ironwood clan. The Ironwood clan was a hegemonic power on par with the Ji clan, but it was the Ji clan\u2019s enemy!Eastmount Marsh was over a thousand kilometers wide, and was on par in size with a \u2018province\u2019 in his previous life. Such an enormous lake\u2026naturally had countless monstrous beasts here. The monstrous beasts which the Ji clan knew about numbered up to twelve!Ever since leaving the Ji clan of the West Prefecture and adventuring ,Ning had wanted to go fight with a few Xiantian level Diremonsters, but Diremonsters were all hidden within the deep lakes and tall mountains. How could they be so easily found? In the past, he had spent nearly an entire month searching an area without any success. Furious, Ning immediately changed their path and headed straight to Eastmount Marsh!\u201cThere are many monsters in Eastmount Marsh, and many of them are early Xiantian level. I refuse to believe I won\u2019t encounter a single one.\u201d Ning was like a newborn calf who didn\u2019t know the meaning of fear. However, he didn\u2019t dare to be too incautious either, because many clansmen of the Ji clan had died here in Eastmount Marsh, such as his grandfather, who had died here at Eastmount Marsh!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cMowu. Autumn Leaf.\u201d Ning leapt off the back of his black ferobeast and instructed, \u201cEastmount Marsh is too risky a place, and there is danger everywhere. In addition, the black ferobeasts are of no use in the water. The two of you, take these three black ferobeasts and head to the Metalstone Tribe. Wait for me at the Metalstone Tribe!\u201dMowu and Autumn Leaf glanced at each other. They could only reply respectfully, \u201cYes, young master.\u201d\u201cDala.\u201d Ning looked at the swarthy, big man. \u201cYou and I will make a trip to this lake. Help me get used to the general areas around here, and then you can go back and rest at the Metalstone Tribe as well.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201d Uncle Dala said respectfully.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dNing immediately headed forward, and Uncle Dala, hefting his greataxe, followed behind. Autumn Leaf and Mowu watched as their young master entered the distant Eastmount Marsh. Although they were nervous, there was nothing they could do. One of them was a maidservant, while the other was nothing more than a person assigned to teach the young master his abundant mountaineering experience. Their power was far inferior to Ning\u2019s.The vast lake was filled with myriad beautiful scenes.\u201cWithin this great lake, there are places with islands of firmer terrain and grasses as well.\u201d Uncle Dala laughed. \u201cIn fact, there are even some small villages. But of course, most of the muddy areas, if you step into them, you\u2019ll sink into the marsh\u2026and in addition, there is of course the immeasurably deep lake itself. Within the marsh, it is difficult to move about, and if you aren\u2019t careful, you\u2019ll sink into it.\u201dNing was right next to him.\u201cOur Metalstone Tribe has lived in a village near the marsh for centuries now, and often come here to fish. We know exactly where which roads are passable and which aren\u2019t.\u201d Uncle Dala was very confident.Pa! Pa!Striding through the mud, Ning followed this tribal warrior through Eastmount Marsh.\u201cLook.\u201d A beastskin parchment appeared out of nowhere in Ning\u2019s hands. \u201cThis is the map of Eastmount Lake. Lead me to these circled areas.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Uncle Dala was terrified. \u201cThese\u2026these are all places where Diremonsters are hiding. These are the most dangerous places. We don\u2019t dare go near them.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go near them.\u201d Ning shook his head. \u201cJust lead me there, and tell me from afar how to go.\u201dUncle Dala\u2019s forehead was covered in sweat. He nodded. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll lead you, young master.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Eastmount Marsh was simply too vast. It was indeed quite slow for them to move through it relying on their legs alone. In addition, this was Ning\u2019s first time coming here, and the various meandering pathways stretched for thousands of kilometers. Fortunately, the experienced Uncle Dala guided him to one hidden pathway after another, allowing them to easily navigate this marsh.In the blink of an eye, over a month passed.Ning had carried food and beverages within his kalestone, and in addition, they could roast the meat of some monstrous beasts. Whenever they went to sleep, they would just find a random patch of dry land or grass. Ning wasn\u2019t in a hurry to go challenge those hidden Diremonsters. First, he wanted to locate them. Afterwards, he would travel by himself and relying on his \u2018one with the world\u2019 level of footwork to easily walk atop the surface of the lake water. He would be able to traverse a thousand kilometers in but a single day.\u201cThis is the last place.\u201d Uncle Dala pointed from afar at a distant place, where the luxurious growth of aquatic plants, at least three meters high, waved in the wind. \u201cRight there, where the aquatic plants are growing, is the lair of a Greater Beast. Supposedly, this is an extremely, extremely large rhinoceros, an aquatic rhinoceros the size of a small mountain.\u201d\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go back. After returning to the Metalstone Tribe, I will definitely reward you heavily.\u201d Ning said.\u201cYoung master, you\u2019ve given me enough.\u201d Uncle Dala said hastily.This seemingly delicate youngster was actually terrifyingly powerful. During their month in Eastmount Marsh, they had been attacked by quite a few monstrous beasts, but all of them died to but a single blow of the youngster\u2019s sword! Ning didn\u2019t care about the corpses of the monstrous beasts either, but Uncle Dala\u2019s heart ached every time. This was monstrous beast flesh. If they sold it, the tribe would be in a much better situation, but he couldn\u2019t carry it all back, so all he could do was to carve out a few choice parts and take them with him.\u201cHrm?\u201d Ning and Uncle Dala both suddenly stared into the distance.From afar, there was a squad of troops, with quite a few figures within.Deep in the marsh, there were solid areas, muddy areas, and even hilly areas, along with a large mountain. That mountain was known as the East Mountain, which was why this marsh was known as Eastmount Marsh.Off in the distance, a squad of apparently several hundred soldiers could be seen clustered in on a hill. Suddenly, ten figures ran over at rapid speed towards Ning and Uncle Dala.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ning frowned.\u201cQuick, let\u2019s leave.\u201d Uncle Dala was so frightened that he immediately turned tail and ran.Shua!One of those ten men was wearing blue metal armor, and with a howl, he leapt forward at an astonishing speed, blocking off Uncle Dala\u2019s escape path.\u201cThe two of you.\u201d The blue armored man stared at them coldly, pausing only briefly to glance at the exquisite beast fur clothes on Ning\u2019s body, before continuing disdainfully, \u201cCome with us!\u201d\u201cWhat do you want with us?\u201d Uncle Dala, seeing the man\u2019s armor, immediately bowed and said respectfully.The other nine walked over as well, all of them dressed in armor.\u201cHurry up. If we tell you to follow us, then follow us. Otherwise, you die here!\u201d These armor-clad guards all stared coldly while hefting their weapons, clearly very skilled.Uncle Dala looked at Ning.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look for now.\u201d Ning was actually quite calm. These armored guards were clearly no ordinary people, but to him, they were like nothing more than wild chickens facing a ravenous dog. But why did the armored guards want them to follow? If it wasn\u2019t necessary, Ning didn\u2019t want to so casually slaughter others.\u201cMove.\u201d\u201cHurry.\u201dUnder the watchful gazes of the ten armored guards, Ning and Uncle Dala headed towards the hill.There was some grass on the hill, and there were currently hundreds of people there. Most of them were lying there with their hands and feet bound, while roughly a hundred armored guards were in a perimeter around them, while there was a stone seat in the center. On the stone seat, there was a bulky, muscled man, at least six and a half feet tall, wearing thick armor and with a dominating gaze.Ning stared in surprise at the tall armored man who sat in the middle. The \u2018demonstone\u2019 in Ning\u2019s pocket was currently radiating heat. Clearly, it had sensed the presence of a nearby monster. At the same time, Ning could vaguely feel that the massive armored man escorted by the many guards had an extraordinary aura.\u201cThere\u2019s a Diremonster.\u201d Ning hurriedly inspecting everyone carefully.Only humans were nearby. A monster which could take human form was, without question, a Diremonster!Ning had brought many objects with him on this journey, and a demonstone was one of them. Demonstones\u2026were a type of special natural rock. Once they sensed the aura of a monster, they would emanate light and heat. Some cities that were even larger than West Prefecture City would have \u2018Monster Revealing Mirrors\u2019 installed on the city gates, which were formed from multiple demonstones. So long as a monster drew near, the Monster Revealing Mirror would immediately radiate light.Humans had a human aura, while monsters naturally had their own monstrous auras. This was a type of life aura.\u201cDala!\u201d\u201cUncle Dala!\u201dSuddenly, several voices rang out.Ning and Uncle Dala both turned their heads and saw that amongst the bound people, there were ten of them calling towards the two of them. This caused Uncle Dala to immediately have a distressed look on his face. \u201cBlack Tiger, why have you been bound here?\u201d Those ten or so people belonged to his tribe.\u201cDala, why are you here? That giant person is a Diremonster. He\u2019s going to eat us all.\u201d One of the bound tribesmen called out frantically.\u201cDiremonster?\u201d Uncle Dala was shocked.Ning stared back at that massive man in heavy armor, seated in the center of that ring of armored guards. Taking a careful glance, he saw that the giant man had a hint of blood at the corner of his lips, and he was currently smacking them in a satisfied manner. This caused Ning\u2019s heart to immediately become filled with an urge to kill. \u201cSo the Diremonster which my demonstone sensed is him! Eastmount Marsh has a total of twelve Diremonsters. I wonder which one he is.\u201d\u201cShut your mouth.\u201d An armored guard walked over and kicked that bound man, kicking him wildly and repeatedly. \u201cAll of you, shut your mouths.\u201d\u201cYou are harming your fellow humans for the sake of a Diremonster, and you want us to shut our mouths?\u201d\u201cAnd you are the venerable Blue Guards of the Ironwood clan. You really are a disgrace to the Ironwood clan!\u201d\u201cKick away, kick as much as you like, kick us all to death.\u201dThe people being kicked shouted wildly.\u201cStop it!\u201d The massive, heavily armored man seated on the stone bench rumbled. His voice was very deep, as though coming from a bullhorn. \u201cIf you kick them to death, then I\u2019ll eat you.\u201dThe armored guard glanced at the heavily armored giant, and then unhappily stepped back.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAquatic Rhino King!\u201d A bald armored guard growled, \u201cWe have already helped you capture over five hundred people. Our comrades have spread out everywhere to capture people, and have already done our part. Give our young master back to us, and our Ironwood clan will act as though this never happened. Otherwise, if the situation escalates, Aquatic Rhino King\u2026you should know that you are unable to bear the fury of our Ironwood clan.\u201dWatching from a distance under escort from two armored guards, Ning\u2019s eyes lit up.Aquatic Rhino King?There was only a single Aquatic Rhinoceros amongst the twelve Diremonsters of Eastmount Marsh. It was an early Xiantian level Diremonster!\u201cEarly Xiantian level?\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes were filled with a killing intent. \u201cI\u2019ve searched a long, long time for a Diremonster of this level of power. This really is a case of \u2018searching far and wide to no avail, but then discovering it all of a sudden\u2019.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Reaching out with his enormous hand, he grabbed a nearby bound youth, placing the youth down on his thigh. The youth, on the thigh of the Aquatic Rhino King, was like a tiny doll, without any ability to resist at all. The youth screamed in pain, \u201cHe told you to go capture people, so do so. All you need to do is capture a thousand people. Oh mighty Aquatic Rhino King, the two we just captured, plus the nineteen you ate earlier, means that I have already ordered my subordinates to capture five hundred and eighty three humans for you already.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d The voice of the Aquatic Rhino King was still very low and very thick. \u201cI, the Aquatic Rhino King, will do what I promise. After you catch a thousand people, I will definitely spare you.\u201d\u201cBaldy!\u201d The Aquatic Rhino King stared with his massive eyes at the bald armored guard. \u201cDon\u2019t try to use the Ironwood clan\u2019s name to try and scare me. Here in the Eastmount Marsh, every year, how many disciples of the Ironwood clan and the Ji clan die? You came to adventure in Eastmount Marsh. If you die, you die! Even if this soft-skinned, tender-fleshed \u2018young master\u2019 of your Ironwood clan really has an extremely high status, if I were to kill you all, most likely it would be a long time before the Ironwood clan found out that you were all dead, and wouldn\u2019t be able to find out who the killer was!\u201dThe Blue Guards could only grit their teeth.The Aquatic Rhino King laughed, and with a wave of his hand, tossed the bound \u2018young master\u2019 of the Ironwood clan to the ground again.\u201cAll of you, go out and capture more people. Go capture more, quickly. Go capture more of these lowly peasants.\u201d Lying on the ground, the Ironwood clan\u2019s \u2018young master\u2019 was roaring angrily.\u201cBut young master.\u201d The bald armored guard said frantically, \u201cWe\u2019ve already captured virtually all of the hunters and fishers here in Eastmount Marsh. Even if there were any more here\u2026there would only be a very few. It\u2019s going to be very hard to reach four hundred.\u201dThe young master of the Ironwood clan, lying on the ground, howled fiercely, \u201cThen find a tribe. Any who resist, slaughter them all. Bring the rest back here. You should be able to find a few hundred people in a tribe, right?\u201d\u201cMassacre a tribe?\u201d The bald armored guard was stunned.\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d The Ironwood clan\u2019s \u2018young master\u2019 roared, \u201cIf you are afraid, then go to the territory of the Ji clan! Go massacre a clan in the Ji clan\u2019s territory. Kill any who resist and bring the others back.\u201dThe bald armored guard clenched his teeth. \u201cYes!\u201dIf it was a case of the two major sides engaging in battle, or an order from their master in ordinary circumstances, they wouldn\u2019t hesitate at all to kill. But they were now serving a Diremonster to kill and torture other humans\u2026this caused the valiant armored guards to feel incomparable shame.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d The Aquatic Rhino King laughed loudly, his voice like thunder. \u201cGood, good, good. After you round up a thousand humans, I\u2019ll definitely spare you.\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dThe Aquatic Rhino King rubbed his rumbling stomach, licking his lips. \u201cJust ate a man. Now I\u2019m hungry again! Who should I eat?\u201d The Aquatic Rhino King cast his gaze towards the others, and instantly, the people who were tied up all had changed looks on their face. Many people\u2019s eyes were filled with fear.They had personally witnessed this Diremonster eat someone alive earlier. They weren\u2019t afraid of death, but to be eaten one bite at a time was a sort of hell!\u201cUm?\u201d The Aquatic Rhino King\u2019s gaze landed on the distant Ning, and his eyes lit up. \u201cUm, that human youth\u2019s skin is so delicate and so clean. He seems very young. His flesh definitely will be delicious. Quick, someone, go bring him to me.\u201d As he spoke, he began to drool.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Uncle Dala looked frantically towards Ning. There were ten Blue Guards next to them.\u201cMove it.\u201d A Blue Guard grabbed at Ning\u2019s beast fur clothes.Ning turned his head and glanced at the Blue Guard. With a movement of his right hand, he sent his right palm chopping towards the chest of the Blue Guard. Bang\u2026a low sound rang out, and the Blue Guard was sent flying far away into the air. His eyes were bulging and round, and his mouth was hanging wide open. His face was red. Bang! Fresh blood spewed out from his shattered organs. He fell into the watery marsh over a hundred meters away, and as he did, he kicked up a splash of water, then sank down, not moving at all. Clearly, he was dead.\u201cTo willingly serve as the fangs and claws for a Diremonster and harm those of your own race\u2026you deserve death!\u201d A cold voice rang out.Utter silence.The five hundred plus people who were tied up on the hill, as well as the hundred plus Blue Guards, and even that seated Diremonster, the Aquatic Rhino King, all turned to look at the seemingly fragile youngster.A single palm sent someone flying over a hundred meters?\u201cWonderful!\u201d The Aquatic Rhino King was the first to react, and he actually became excited. He naturally was very happy to witness humans killing each other, and he immediately shouted, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to fight him? He just killed one of your people! Quick, fight!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d The other Blue Guards instantly saw red, and all of them transformed into cruel blurs as they pounced towards him. The youngster in front of them had just killed one of their comrades. When their comrade had died to that palm just now, the only thing that could be said was that they were unable to react in time. In addition, this youngster probably trained in some sort of Fiendgod Body Refining technique. He just had a bit of strength, that was all.In a life and death battle, what mattered was the sword and saber techniques which one had refined and trained in. Even if one was much physically weaker, one\u2019s sword would still be able to pierce through an opponent\u2019s skull!Hu! Hu! Hu! Twenty Blue Guards attacked in unison.With a wave of his hand, Ning pushed the nearby Uncle Dala, who went flying. Dala somersaulted in a midair, then landed on the ground, completely uninjured. Uncle Dala looked frantically at the twenty Blue Guards charging towards Ning. \u201cYoung master, be careful.\u201d\u201cBe careful.\u201d\u201cQuick, run.\u201d\u201cYoung man, quick, run!\u201dThe bound prisoners all grew frantic as well, and they began to call out, staring at the youngster with worry. They knew how powerful these Blue Guards were\u2026these Blue Guards were highly experienced Ninefang Warriors who were extremely skilled at group attacks. These were elite soldiers of the Ironwood clan. Only a Xiantian level lifeform would be able to survive the attack of twenty of these Blue Guards.Faced with the attacking Blue Guards, Ning suddenly transformed into a gust of wind, the carefree wind which went where it pleased. When the Blue Guards chopped and stabbed at them with their sabers, spears, and sharp swords, Ning leisurely stepped past, easily making his way past their combined attacks.Hu!Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!A series of palm slapping sounds in a row. Even as Ning made his way past the attacks of the twenty Blue Guards, he slapped out with his palms, each strike coming from his wrist and striking onto the faces of the Blue Guards. Each palm strike of Ning\u2019s carried ten thousand pounds of force, and sent these Blue Guards flying. No one was able to block Ning\u2019s palm.Hu!Ning\u2019s body came to a halt. All twenty of the Blue Guards had been knocked flying to the side, all of their heads and necks crooked and twisted, blood flowing from their mouths, noses, and ears.All of them dead!\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cGood heavens!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026\u201dThe hundreds of bound people and the Blue Guards of the Ironwood clan\u2026even the Diremonster was shocked.\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d The young master of the Ironwood clan who was lying there bound on the floor was both furious and frantic.\u201cWe are the Blue Guards of the Ironwood clan.\u201d The other Blue Guards had very ugly looks on their faces. They were furious, but didn\u2019t dare to make a move.Ning said with cold calm, \u201cTo willingly serve as the claws and fangs of a Diremonster is a crime that deserves death.\u201d The Ironwood clan and the Ji clan were enemies to begin with, and these dead enemies had even been willing to serve as the claws of a Diremonster!Hua!A sharp sword appeared out of nowhere into Ning\u2019s hands. His feet moved, and then sword light began to flash\u2026in the blink of an eye, nine of the Blue Guards held their throats, gurgling a few times, before collapsing, blood flowing from the wound in their necks. In terms of footwork or swordplay, this youngster was extremely fast, causing the other Blue Guards to be terrified.Earlier, Ning had already been terrifying without even using his sword. But now, he began to wield his sword.\u201cQuick, run.\u201d\u201cAquatic Rhino King, save us!\u201d The Blue Guards were completely frantic. This youngster who had appeared out of nowhere was clearly about to massacre them.The Aquatic Rhino King just sat there, laughing loudly. \u201cAll I said was that if you seized a thousand humans, I\u2019d spare you. I never said I\u2019d save you from others. Kill, kill, kill.\u201d The Aquatic Rhino King wasn\u2019t worried at all. To him, a Diremonster, these humans in front of him were nothing more than humans. This was nothing more than internal warfare amongst humans.Chi! Chi! Chi!Blood was flying everywhere, and one Blue Guard after another fell down lifelessly. The Blue Guards all fled in every which way in terror. They were truly frightened now. Their swordplay and saberplay, against this youngster, clearly weren\u2019t enough to even withstand a single blow.\u201cQuick, run.\u201d\u201cQuick.\u201dHu\u2026.moving at extreme speed with the sound of the wind, multiple blurry forms of Ning appeared out of nowhere. Every single Blue Guard fell where they stood. Some had been stabbed through the heart, others had their throats cut. Blood stained the ground. The Blue Guards lay collapsed on the ground, scattered throughout the area.Every single Blue Guard had died!\u201cHrm?\u201d The Aquatic Rhino King, previously just enjoying the show, suddenly stood up, his face changed. The last, full-strength attack which Ning had employed had pushed his speed to the utmost limit, generating dozens of blurry images. This had truly stunned the Aquatic Rhino King. Before this, he hadn\u2019t considered this youngster as a potential opponent. But now, he began to feel a bit wary.\u201cToo powerful.\u201d\u201cSo strong.\u201d\u201cThey deserved to die.\u201d The bound people all felt extremely excited. They hadn\u2019t expected this youth to be as powerful as this. Could it be that this powerful youth was so powerful\u2026that he was going to kill this terrifying Diremonster?Swish! Swish! Swish! Sword light flashing, the ten or so people around Ning instantly found their binds had been cut through.\u201cHuman youth.\u201d The Aquatic Rhino King transformed into a black blur, charging towards Ning and smashing down at him with a massive fist that was covered with a thick layer of ice. \u201cThey are my food.\u201d\u201cClang.\u201dNing struck out with his Darknorth sword, stabbing straight towards that massive fist.BANG!!!!It was as though a mountain had collapsed. Ning flew back a hundred meters, and the layer of ice on the fist of the Aquatic Rhino King also exploded, and even half the arm of the monster had exploded. The watching tribesmen all revealed looks of joy and expectation on their faces. Had the Diremonster\u2019s arm been destroyed?\u201cExcellent.\u201d The Aquatic Rhino King growled. \u201cYou are worthy of me using my real form.\u201dThe Aquatic Rhino King suddenly transformed into a huge, watery fog, and then the enormous fog of water suddenly coalesced at high speed, transforming into a hill-sized, thirty meters tall massive monster. This was an enormous Aquatic Rhinoceros. It was covered with an extremely thick blue hide, and was seventy meters long. It truly was like a small mountain. The energy emitting from its nostrils caused the ground to be covered with a layer of thick ice, and the nearby tribesmen were instantly frozen into ice statues. At this time, Uncle Dala was still rapidly rescuing the other members of his clan.\u201cQuick, leave.\u201d The distant Ning transformed into a stream of light, travelling atop the water. In but an instant, he scurried over, and as his sword flashed, the ropes binding the dozens of men were instantly cut apart.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you leaving?\u201d Ning roared angrily, and then turned to stare at the giant monster.These people quickly grabbed the weapons lying on the ground, cut open the ropes on the people next to them, and then in the blink of an eye, the four hundred lucky survivors quickly fled.\u201cFleeing? I\u2019m going to freeze you and slowly enjoy eating you.\u201d The Aquatic Rhino King stared around him. Instantly, a cold aura began to radiate forth, and the temperature rapidly began to lower. A layer of ice and frost began to spread out, and instantly, some people were turned into ice statues. Only the fastest runners and the likes of Uncle Dala, who had fled long ago, managed to survive.\u201cI am the Ironwood clan\u2019s\u2026\u201d The young master of the Ironwood clan was still shouting fiercely, but halfway through his words, he turned into an ice statue.In the blink of an eye, the area within thirty meters of the Aquatic Rhino King had turned into a graveyard.Only Ning and the Aquatic Rhino King remained, staring at each other.From off in the distance, Uncle Dala and the dozens of lucky survivors still felt the aftertaste of terror. A young man near Uncle Dala said with concern, \u201cUncle Dala, will that young fellow survive?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHe will, he will.\u201d Uncle Dala said with his mouth, but in his heart, he didn\u2019t feel too confident either. Would that youngster with astonishing strength and swordplay be able to defeat the vicious, ferocious Diremonster?\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you left yet!\u201dThe distant Ning roared in anger.Once the battle began, this distance of a three hundred meters, to the likes of Ning or the Aquatic Rhino King, would be nothing at all. He wouldn\u2019t be able to help save them.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Uncle Dala gritted his teeth, then led his tribesmen to flee. As for those of other tribes, they had fled long ago. They had been utterly frightened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Frozen corpses stood there like ice statues, whether on the ground, lying down, or standing up. There was no longer any hint of life in them. These six hundred corpses, especially those of the five hundred innocents, filled Ning\u2019s heart with an even stronger desire to kill.\u201cHuman youth.\u201d The Aquatic Rhino\u2019s four legs seemed like massive pillars, pawing at the ground as it stared at Ning. \u201cYou have angered me. Those were meant to be my food.\u201dThe ice covered Ning, and there was even a layer of frost on his fur clothes. But Ning\u2019s clothes rippled slightly, instantly breaking apart that layer of frost. Still, a large amount of ice continued to accumulate\u2026all Ning could do was constantly break it apart and sent it flying.\u201cYour swordplay and footwork are both quite impressive, but you are still only at the Houtian level. Whereas I, I am a mighty Xiantian lifeform.\u201d The Aquatic Rhino rumbled in deep throated laughter. \u201cSince a few dozen ordinary humans fled, you\u2019ll have to be the compensatory prize. The flesh of a powerful human youth is even more attractive to me than that of a thousand ordinary humans.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t killed a Xiantian lifeform yet.\u201d Covered with frost, Ning stared at the Aquatic Rhino, his voice ice cold. \u201cThus, I have an unquenchable urge to kill a Xiantian lifeform! Aquatic Rhino King, as the first Xiantian lifeform to die to me, you should feel proud! I will chop off your flesh and personally sample it, and I\u2019ll also let my parents and clansmen taste your flesh!\u201dHua!Ning\u2019s left hand suddenly was also grasping a precious sword, and he was now wielding a Darknorth sword in each hand.\u201cTwin swords? So it seems your swordplay is just average. In this area around Swallow Mountain, there isn\u2019t a single person who uses twin swords who had good sword techniques!\u201d The Aquatic Rhino stared at Ning with its enormous eyes, and then casually stamped on the ground, causing the entire area to shake. And then, like a mountain, it came crashing towards him. \u201cDie!\u201dBang!A massive hoof, so large that several men would be needed to wrap their arms around it in a circle, came crashing down from up high, stamping down towards Ning. The air itself exploded with a desolate, ear-piercing boom, and a blast of energy gouged multiple holes in the ground. Long before this hoof actually touched Ning, Ning knew how powerful it was.\u201cSwoosh!\u201d Ning first drew out a sword, which dimly flashed like a faint light of water which cut at the enormous hoof in a thin line. After just barely penetrating into the hoof\u2019s skin, it was no longer able to penetrate any further. Ning immediately moved like a gust of wind and retreated.Bang!!!The earth shuddered, and an enormous crater many meters in size appeared, while Ning himself had already dodged more than thirty meters away.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to escape.\u201d The Aquatic Rhino bellowed as it charged towards Ning. Although it seemed to be clumsy, due to its massive size, it travelled a huge distance with every step. Its enormous hooves created massive crater-like hoof-prints in the ground with each pounding step, and soon, it chased Ning all the way into a mountain forest not too far from the hill.This forest was only a few square kilometers in size.\u201cThese trees won\u2019t be able to impede me at all.\u201d The Aquatic Rhino bellowed, charging through them. In front of the mountain-like Aquatic Rhino, these large trees were like blades of grass being stepped on and moved through by ordinary people.\u201cHe lives up to the reputation of being an Aquatic Rhino. His physical strength is much greater than that of an ordinary Diremonster\u2019s.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cAnd its skin is very thick. Just relying on my internal ki energy and \u2018one with the world\u2019 swordplay, I\u2019m unable to even break through its skin. It seems I\u2019ll have to rely on Fiendgod Body Refining.\u201dSwoosh!Ning, with a leap, suddenly was standing atop the crown of a tall, large tree. Standing on the tree\u2019s leaves, he didn\u2019t sink down at all, staring down into the matching gaze of the Aquatic Rhino.\u201cHuh?\u201d The Aquatic Rhino suddenly came to a halt. He sensed that there was a change to this human youngster\u2019s aura, and in terms of the strength of that aura, it was only very slightly weaker than the Aquatic Rhino\u2019s own. \u201cFiendgod Body Refining?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Ning\u2019s skin was beginning to turn red. The power of the Sun and the Moon had begun to totally fill his body, and his strength instantly rose to the maximum limits.If he could break through and reach the Xiantian lifeform level, the divine power in his body would even be able to appear outside his body.\u201cHaha, you are but a Houtian lifeform. Even if you train in an Fiendgod Body Refining, you are far inferior to me.\u201d The Aquatic Rhino charged forward ferociously, smashing through trees in its wake, and the trees it smashed through all went \u2018pengpengpeng\u2019 as they collapsed, not able to slow it down at all.\u201cHrmph.\u201dStanding on the crown of the tree, Ning stared down coldly at the charging Aquatic Rhino, two swords in his hands.The Aquatic Rhino was physically enormous. Only a freakishly powerful Diremonster such as Serpentwing would be able to fight against it head on. But, as an expert swordsman, Ning would not do such a thing.Shua!At that moment of impact, Ning used his \u2018one with the world\u2019 level \u2018Shadewind Steps\u2019 to their utmost limits, and in but a single sudden movement, he dodged the Aquatic Rhino\u2019s charge. Compared to Ning\u2026the Aquatic Rhino was simply far less agile. While dodging from the Aquatic Rhino, the Darknorth sword in Ning\u2019s hand sliced down towards the Aquatic Rhino\u2019s flank.The sword flashed like a thin line, translucent, gem-like line of light\u2026as though it were a line created by a large number of waterdrops. The line came slashing through the Aquatic Rhino\u2019s flank![Raindrop Sutra] \u2013 Rain Line!\u2018Advanced\u2019 level swordplay!Like the earlier attack he had used to block the Aquatic Rhino\u2019s stomp, this attack also was one which activated on the power of nature. However, last time, Ning had only used his internal ki energy as the foundation for the attack, while this time\u2026the Solar and Lunar energy in Ning\u2019s body exploded. Using the Fiendgod Body Refining strength as his foundation meant that the power of this attack instantly increased by more than a hundred times!\u201cHuala!\u201d The tough hide of the Aquatic Rhino, under the sharp slash of the precious weapon, \u2018Darknorth sword\u2019, had an enormous wound chopped straight through it. Fresh blood burst forth as though from a dam. Bang! An enormous amount of blood exploded everywhere, and shattered intestines could faintly be seen as well.Swoosh.Ning landed on the ground and turned.The Aquatic Rhino, which had been charging at high speed, had come to a sudden halt while simultaneously letting out a roar of both pain and rage. His muscles and flesh were quivering, and the enormous, ripped wound in his body was rapidly beginning to shrink, but Ning\u2019s sword attack had been simply too vicious and the wound created had been too large. Even despite trying hard to suppress the blood from flowing out and to close the wound, blood still dripped out. It no longer seemed as boastful as it had been earlier.\u201cAquatic Rhino King, the day of your death has come.\u201d Ning transformed into a shadow, flying at high speed towards the Aquatic Rhino.\u201cHowl!\u201dThe Aquatic Rhino let out a fierce howl, and then began to charge madly\u2026to the opposite direction. It was fleeing!Fleeing!\u201cIt is going to run away, just like that?\u201d Ning was astonished.But he quickly understood. His father had previously told him that Diremonsters were extremely crafty. Once they sensed any danger to their well-being, they would immediately flee. Clearly, this Aquatic Rhino had already discovered that its hide, which it was so proud of\u2026could be broken through by a slice from this youngster. This meant that one of its greatest defenses was now useless!Ning\u2019s footwork and agility far surpassed the Aquatic Rhino. After all, even the Diremonster, Serpentwing, hadn\u2019t been able to do anything to him for a period of time.The Aquatic Rhino had always relied on its thick hide. It had thought that the youngster in front of it couldn\u2019t hurt it, while all it had to do was keep charging. If it were to even graze the youngster, the youngster would instantly be injured heavily or even die. But now, it discovered that in but an single sword blow, the youngster had split his chest open\u2026how could this be allowed to continue?\u201cFlee.\u201d The Aquatic Rhino fled wildly.\u201cMy thick hide is hard to split open even for those other Diremonsters. How could that human youth\u2019s sword be so powerful?\u201d The Aquatic Rhino was utterly frightened, not knowing what to do.But\u2026How could he flee?Ning, when utilizing his \u2018one with the world\u2019 footwork, was only slightly slower than Serpentwing. He was far superior to the Aquatic Rhino.Shua! Shua! Shua!Ning had already caught up to the Aquatic Rhino.\u201cI serve the Azure Skysnake King. You can\u2019t kill me!\u201d The Aquatic Rhino galloped wildly while bellowing loudly, and then it also let out a desolate scream, \u201cKing! Save me!\u201d\u201cKing! Save me!\u201dThe low, fierce scream travelled a very long distance.Swoosh!Ning\u2019s incomparably agile body suddenly charged forward, while the twin swords in his hands suddenly, simultaneously stabbed upwards. For a moment, Ning\u2019s entire body transformed into a dazzling-to-behold line of fire light, and with utter ruthlessness, he stabbed upwards at the Aquatic Rhino\u2019s neck position. With a \u2018Chi\u2019 sound, the Aquatic Rhino\u2019s skull was broken through. A burst of fire rose over thirty meters into the air before solidifying into a human form. It was the fur-clad Ning.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d The Aquatic Rhino\u2019s eyes were bulging and round. It hadn\u2019t thought that its glorious, brash life would have suddenly come to an end at the hands of this human youth. As a Xiantian lifeform Diremonster, although it possessed strong life force and wouldn\u2019t die even if stabbed in the heart, Ning had selected its true weak point! Forget about the Aquatic Rhino; even if a Xiantian-level Fiendgod Body Refiner had been stabbed in the head, he would also die.Bang\u2026The massive corpse of the Aquatic Rhino collapsed to the ground, crushing many trees beneath it.\u201cThe \u2018Moth Flies Into the Flame\u2019 \u2013 It really does live up to its reputation as the most powerful attack of the [Thunderflame Sword].\u201d Ning landed gracefully from mid-air, not a single hint of blood staining his body. \u201cBy now, even the three major killing blows of the [Thunderflame Sword] have been trained to the point of the \u2018advanced\u2019 level.\u201dThe [Raindrop Sutra] had nine techniques in total, and Ning was already at the \u2018advanced\u2019 level for all of them, able to summon the power of nature.The [Thunderflame Sword] was a bit harder, especially that last blow, \u2018Moth Flies Into the Flame\u2019. Ning had never been able to truly grasp it to the point of reaching the \u2018advanced\u2019 level, but just then, that Diremonster, the Aquatic Rhino, had tried to charge into the nearby marsh waters. If it had made it into the marsh waters, Ning wouldn\u2019t have been able to do anything to it. In order to instantly kill such a powerful Diremonster with such strong life force\u2026ordinary techniques wouldn\u2019t have been enough.Ning had been frantic, and naturally thought of the the \u2018Moth Flies Into the Flame\u2019 attack. Utilizing nature\u2019s energy, he had pierced straight through the extremely thick skull of the Aquatic Rhino, like a moth throwing itself into a fire!\u201cDiremonster.\u201d Ning looked at the mountain-like corpse of the Aquatic Rhino. He couldn\u2019t help but reveal a hint of excitement in his eyes. \u201cThis is the very first Xiantian level Diremonster I have ever killed. But before dying, didn\u2019t he say something about being the subordinate of some \u2018Azure Skysnake King\u2019? Hrm, best that I leave quickly and not allow anything out of the ordinary to occur.\u201dShua!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing instantly appeared next to the Aquatic Rhino\u2019s corpse. His sword flashing, he quickly chopped open the thick skin of the Aquatic Rhino. The skin of the dead Aquatic Rhino was now clearly much weaker than before\u2026in but a few seconds, Ning retrieved from the Aquatic Rhino\u2019s corpse a black, palm-sized object that faintly emanated a fragrant scent. This was the most precious item contained within the Aquatic Rhino\u2019s body; the bezoar. It was often described as a miraculous antidote to poisons. The value of this Aquatic Rhino\u2019s bezoar alone would be enough to acquire an ordinary magic treasure.\u201cTime to leave.\u201d Holding the monstrous rhino\u2019s bezoar, Ning instantly moved like a gust of wind, flying away at high speed while occasionally landing and taking a few steps on the surface of the water.Half-flying, half-walking on the waves, he fled for more than three kilometers.Huahuahua\u2026Suddenly, the water in front of him suddenly began to vibrate, and an enormous whirlpool appeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I didn\u2019t expect the Azure Skysnake King to be this fast! With my \u2018one with the world\u2019 footwork, I can escape the attacks of many Diremonsters. In Eastmount Marsh, there\u2019s only a few Diremonsters that pose a threat to me, but the Azure Skysnake King is one of them.\u201d\u201cOn my very first trip to Eastmount Marsh, I encountered it!\u201d Ning\u2019s brain quickly flashed through the information regarding the Azure Skysnake King which he had read, back in the West Prefecture.The Azure Skysnake King was a Godbeast known as the Azure Skysnake! According to the records of the Ji clan, the last time they investigated it, it possessed the power of an early Xiantian lifeform! But although it was only an early Xiantian lifeform, due to it possessing the lineage of the Fiendgods, its power was actually comparable to that of the Diremonster, Serpentwing.The Azure Skysnake King was famous for its agility! In other aspects, it was perhaps a bit inferior to Serpentwing, but in terms of agility, it was superior to Serpentwing! In addition, the Azure Skysnake\u2019s venom possessed extremely potent, hallucinatory qualities. If it landed a bite on its target, generally speaking, even Diremonsters would be affected by hallucinations!\u201cMy strongest attribute, my agility, is countered by it.\u201d Ning was worried.In this sort of life and death battle, agility was even more important than strength and speed!For example, the strength of the Aquatic Rhino King was far superior to that of Ning! Its defense was far superior to Ning!But in Ning\u2019s eyes, the Aquatic Rhino King was nothing more than a stupid, clumsy idiot. He was able to effortlessly circle around the Aquatic Rhino King and then kill it. It wanted to ram into Ning, but it couldn\u2019t. But what this Azure Skysnake King was most skilled at was agility!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cHuahuahua\u2026\u201d From afar, the surface of the lake was beginning to slowly reveal an enormous serpentine scaled body.The Azure Skysnake King raised its serpentine head high, staring towards Ning, its eyes filled with confusion. It let out a few low growling sounds.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ning frowned, looking back at the Azure Skysnake King. What was this Snake King saying? He couldn\u2019t understand. The Azure Skysnake King was a Godbeast\u2026and at the early Xiantian level, wasn\u2019t able to transform, nor was it able to speak in the human tongue.Hua!A human form suddenly rose from the water to stand next to the Azure Skysnake King. A thin, white-robed man appeared, staring towards Ning. He shouted, \u201cMy King asks you, were you the one who killed the Aquatic Rhino?\u201d\u201cIf I say I didn\u2019t, would you believe me?\u201d Ning asked.\u201cIn this area, aside from you, there are no other humans at all. Who could have done it besides you?\u201d The tall and thin white-robed man laughed coldly. \u201cIn addition, you are able to run atop the water, showing that you have reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level!\u201dSuddenly, the Azure Skysnake King let out a few more growls, and the white-robed man changed the subject. \u201cHowever, in the area around the Aquatic Rhino\u2019s body, there are no Xiantian energy ripple remnants. Could it be that you are not yet a Xiantian lifeform?\u201d\u201cIf I answer you, will you let me go?\u201d Ning asked.\u201cHow could that be possible?\u201d The white robed man laughed coldly. \u201cYou killed one of the King\u2019s subordinates, the Aquatic Rhino. If we so casually let you leave, what would become of the King\u2019s prestige?\u201dNing frowned and shouted back, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then enough chitchat. If you want to fight, then fight. If you don\u2019t want to fight, then I\u2019m leaving.\u201dThe Azure Skysnake King stared at Ning with its enormous serpentine head, filled with questions. The little human child in front of it\u2026it wasn\u2019t afraid of him, naturally. But the area around the Aquatic Rhino was simply too bizarre. There clearly wasn\u2019t any Xiantian energy ripples in the area, but why did the Aquatic Rhino die? Could someone who wasn\u2019t at the Xiantian level kill a Diremonster?\u201cHrmph.\u201d Ning immediately began to run atop the water, transforming into a gust of wind, fleeing at high speed.Although he had come out to adventure, he knew his own limits. If he went to engage in battle against Diremonsters that were too powerful, he was asking for death! Ning had never intended to do battle against the Azure Skysnake King\u2026\u201cHua\u2026\u201d The Azure Skysnake King swam across the surface of the lake, transforming into a silver tidal wave.In an instant, an enormous serpentine head appeared in front of Ning yet again.\u201cHe really is faster than me.\u201d Ning came to a sudden halt, his eyes blazing with wildness. \u201cIt seems this fight cannot be avoided. If that\u2019s the case, then let\u2019s fight!\u201d\u201cIn Eastmount Marsh, the only one faster than my King is that ancient monster, the Snow Toad! Do you know of the Ancient Snow Toad? That is the most powerful Diremonster of the entire Eastmount Marsh. It can freeze and kill you with but a single cold breath!\u201d The white-robed man was walking atop the water, each step causing the water to ripple slightly, his movements not nearly as agile and graceful as Ning\u2019s. \u201cIt is best that you simply accept your death before my King\u2026\u201dNing frowned, then transformed into a streak of light, charging towards that tall, thin, white-robed man. \u201cMonster, you sure are noisy. Eat a sword from me!\u201dSwish!A cold light flashed towards the man. The white-robed man was so frightened that he immediately dove into the water with a splash. He served under the Azure Skysnake King, and in terms of power, he was actually a bit weaker than even the Aquatic Rhino King. How could he dare to fight with this human youth?\u201cGroooowl.\u201d The Azure Skysnake King suddenly let out an angry roar.Ning turned his head to look at him, not afraid at all. Since he wasn\u2019t going to be able to flee, Ning naturally wiped the hesitation and fear away from his heart, leaving only a blazing heat. The heat of battle! Only by fighting an opponent\u2019s whose strength totally surpassed his own would the blood in his entire body truly begin to boil!Hua\u2026suddenly, an enormous green scaled tail emerged from the lake at high speed, sweeping towards Ning at incomparably high speed.\u201cSo fast!\u201d Ning\u2019s entire body was turning faintly red. Clearly, the Solar and Lunar energies in his body had been raised to their limits. At the same time, his feet began to move in accordance with the Shadewind Steps, and he wielded his twin Darknorth swords in his hands, one of which was flashing with blue light on its edge; poison! The Darknorth swords composed of three swords and a sheath. Two of the swords were normal, but one of them had been coated by Ning with poison.In fact, even a small part of the arrows he had brought were treated with poison! After all, while adventuring and engaging in life-and-death battles, the ultimate goal was to kill the opponent! Naturally, any means of accomplishing this would be acceptable. When battling with the likes of the Aquatic Rhino King, Ning didn\u2019t bother with poison, but this Azure Skysnake King was simply too dangerous.With one hand, he executed \u2018Thin Streams Flow Forever\u2019.With the other hand, he executed \u2018Rain Line\u2019.Both Darknorth swords moved, instantly drawing forth the power of the natural world. Huahuahua\u2026a visible, thin, and long stream of water was currently arcing towards the serpentine tail in an attack. This stream of water was incomparably tough, and it wildly wrapped around the tail, causing the power and speed of that tail to slow.At the same time, drops of water had solidified into a thin line, and that thin line chopped directly towards that enormous serpentine body!\u201cBang!\u201d Ning was blasted backwards at high speed by the force of the collision, and water splashed everywhere.\u201cHuala!\u201d Green, emerald-like blood came flying out of a large wound on the serpentine body, but quickly, the flow of blood slowed and the wound shrank. The blood, however, had a faint black color as well, but moments later, it returned to an emerald color. Clearly, the poison on the Darknorth swords didn\u2019t pose much of a threat to the Azure Skysnake King, which was venomous by nature.Swoosh!Ning rose high into the sky, leaping off the surface of the water.The Azure Skysnake King coiled up its enormous body, staring at the distant human youth. This human youth had actually wounded it in a single exchange.Suddenly\u2026The enormous body of the Azure Skysnake King began to shrink at high speed. Previously, it had been even larger than Serpentwing, but in a few seconds, it transformed to a size of only ten meters long, and its serpentine body was now only as thick as a person\u2019s thighs. At the same time, this jade-green Azure Skysnake continued to stare at Ning, emitted a \u2018Hisssssss\u2019 sound.\u201cNot good.\u201d Ning\u2019s face grew even more solemn.The Azure Skysnake King was a Godbeast. It could increase or decrease its size, and was famous for its agility. When it shrank its size, that was when it was the most fearsome!A violet pill suddenly appeared in Ning\u2019s hand out of nowhere, and he immediately tossed it in his mouth. This was an antivenom spiritual pill. It was one of multiple different types of antivenoms which Ning had prepared for this adventuring expedition for when he encountered Diremonsters. This one was particularly effective against hallucinatory toxins and venoms.Ning wielded his twin blades, staring death at the Azure Skysnake King.The Azure Skysnake King\u2019s serpentine head swayed slightly in a confident manner. It seemed like an experienced hunter, searching for Ning\u2019s weaknesses. While swaying, it also slowly began to move closer to Ning, but Ning, striding on water, took one step back after another, maintaining the distance between them.\u201cSwish!\u201dSuddenly, the Azure Skysnake King transformed into a flash of emerald lightning!It charged at Ning!Ji Ning\u2019s eyes flashed with a fierce light. The Darknorth sword in his right hand suddenly transformed into a flash, chopping ray of light as his speed increased to its maximum. This was one of the three killing strokes of the [Thunderflame Sword], \u2018Thunderflint Flash\u2019. This technique relied on a single word; \u2018Quick\u2019! It could be described as the fastest sword attack Ning was capable of, and he used it now to deal with this sudden pounce of the Azure Skysnake King!Shua! Shua!In but an instant, the Azure Skysnake King changed direction twelve times, transforming into a magical, illusory shadow which passed through the Darknorth sword in Ning\u2019s right hand, and even used its serpentine body, now greatly reduced in size but clearly much more powerful, to strike at the Darknorth sword.But Ning\u2019s left hand, also wielding a Darknorth sword, transformed into circles of spinning water as he put on display the most defensively powerful stance of the [Raindrop Sutra], \u2018Watertight\u2019!\u201cClang!\u201dThe serpentine head and the edge of the Darknorth sword collided, and the Azure Skysnake King couldn\u2019t help but have its trajectory slightly altered to one side.The two of them passed each other!\u201cPa!\u201d In that instant when they moved past each other, a terrifying shadow suddenly emerged from the water, striking towards Ning. Ning, unable to block in time, was struck heavily on the chest with a \u2018Bang!\u2019 sound\u2026Ning couldn\u2019t help but immediately vomit out a mouthful of blood, his face turning red as he was sent flying across the surface of the lake.Huahua\u2026The Azure Skysnake King swam at high speed through the waters of the lake, pouncing towards Ning\u2019s position.\u201cThose whip-strikes of that tail are too fast. Much faster than the tail strikes of that old monster Serpentwing.\u201d Ning, in mid-air, flipped around and gracefully landed on the surface of the lake. He couldn\u2019t help but clutch his chest. He could faintly sense that his bones were broken, but the powerful regenerative energies of the Fiendgod Body Refining method was quickly restoring them.Kakaka\u2026the two shattered ribs in his chest quickly were repaired.\u201cBut his strength is quite a bit lower than Serpentwing\u2019s.\u201d Ning stared at his chest. Only his fur clothes had been ripped apart. With the added protection of the Goldstar Shirt, his body hadn\u2019t been injured too badly.\u201cSwish!\u201dThe Azure Skysnake King once more shot towards him as fast as lightning.So very fast!\u201cCome.\u201d Ning wildly wielded his twin swords in an effort to defend. The Azure Skysnake King moved its head as if to bite, moved its body as if to coil around him, and also used its serpentine tail to strike at him. Its entire body was a weapon, and it coiled around Ning, wildly attacking. In this sort of extremely close quarters combat, often, a single second would allow numerous blows to be exchanged.Ning\u2019s [Raindrop Sutra] and [Thunderflame Sword] had both reached the \u2018advanced\u2019 stage, but he had yet to reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level of swordplay!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIf his swordplay was at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level, every ordinary pierce, thrust, scrape\u2026any attack would be able to call on the natural power of the world. Only then was one\u2019s level of swordplay truly at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level. Because Ning had yet to reach this level, thus in this sort of high-speed combat, some of the postures and movements of his attacks were no longer carrying the power of the world.Upon losing the natural power of the world, the power of his swordplay decreased noticeably. This was an enormous flaw, one which Ning was relying on his twin swords to make up for, but still, in the end\u2026if one only defended, one would be defeated!\u201cChi!\u201dThe Azure Skysnake King\u2019s serpentine head bit viciously at Ning\u2019s calf, and its sharp, venomous fangs pierced straight through the fur clothes and the Goldstar Shirt, the venom in its fangs instantly transmitting into Ning\u2019s body. A powerful, numbing, intoxicating sensation quickly spread from Ning\u2019s calf to the rest of his body, and Ning hurriedly swallowed the antivenom spiritual pill which he had been holding under his tongue.\u201cDie.\u201d Ning struck out with the Darknorth swords in both hands, both of them simultaneously executing the \u2018Moth Flies into the Flame\u2019 of the [Thunderflame Sword]. The two swords instantly seemed to have transformed into two scorching lines of fire, piercing down directly towards the head of the Azure Skysnake King which was latched onto his calf!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In terms of power, even I am inferior to that human youth\u2026it seems in the future, when I encounter human youths, I need to be more careful. Still, it looks like that human youth is about to die!\u201d\u201cAfter he dies, I need to go have a taste of that youth\u2019s flesh.

His hair-bindings had been shattered, and his hair was now loose and unbound. But he still wielded those two Darknorth swords with hands that were as stable as ever, and his eyes were still very bright, as though fires were burning in them!Desire!A desire to achieve victory. Even though he was currently at a disadvantage and was being wounded repeatedly, Ning had never even thought of giving up.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cSo what if you trained in a Fiendgod Body Refining method?\u201d The white robed man snickered. \u201cHe\u2019s still only at the Houtian level. Injured repeatedly, then healing repeatedly. Each recovery will take up a large amount of his energy! After the energy in his body is depleted\u2026then, utterly exhausted, he will no longer be able to fight back.\u201dHe could all but see the astonishingly talented youth collapse, and then be dismembered and eaten by the Diremonsters.\u201cHow sad. A heroic figure who would have doubtlessly become legendary throughout this area is going to die, right here.\u201d The white robed man watched, not wanting to miss a thing.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe white robed man\u2019s face changed slightly. \u201cWhy is his swordplay\u2026\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The Azure Skysnake King was simply too strong. After having shrunk in size, the body of the Azure Skysnake King became even tougher, like an iron whip. It had also become even more agile and even fiercer! In terms of strength, defense, speed, it was superior to Ning\u2026Ning\u2019s only advantage was that the pair of Darknorth swords he wielded in his hands.The Azure Skysnake King\u2019s pressuring attacks had caused Ning to enter an empty mental realm where nothing existed except the next attack! He didn\u2019t have any other thoughts, other than thoughts of battle!Kill!Kill!The Azure Skysnake King in front of him was like a nightmare. Its striking attacks was even faster than Ning\u2019s \u2018Thunderflint Flash\u2019! Its coiling body was even more elastic than Ning\u2019s \u2018Thin Streams Flow Forever\u2019 attack! Its whip-like tail struck against Ning, causing him to lose his breath, but fortunately, his two Darknorth swords were able to complement each other.If one sword couldn\u2019t take it, then the second sword would join in!\u201cClang!\u201d \u201cClang!\u201d \u201cClang!\u201dAt first, he was constantly being wounded.However, because he had a Fiendgod Body and had eaten an antivenom spiritual pill, the venom of the Azure Skysnake King, despite causing a bit of numbness, didn\u2019t have any effect on his ability to perform in battle. As for bloodloss\u2026Ning cared about that even less!Slowly\u2026The Azure Skysnake King seemed to find it harder and harder to break through the defenses of the Darknorth swords. It was growing harder for him to wound Ning.\u201cHuahuahua\u2026\u201d The swords flashed everywhere, summoning the power of the world.The Azure Skysnake King transformed into an emerald ray of light, swirling around Ning, attacking him wildly time and time again, but that perfect, mastered swordplay which carried with it the power of the world had created an utterly unbroken defense\u2026one sword attack flashed after another, flowing like quicksilver, revealing no cracks at all, causing each of the Azure Skysnake King\u2019s attacks to be fruitless.\u201cHrm?\u201d Ning suddenly found that he was able to think again.Earlier, the Azure Skysnake King had simply put him under too much pressure, forcing him to totally concentrate on defense and on this battle. But now, that pressure had decreased, and he could spare a little bit of time to think. And when he did, Ning discovered that under the pressure of the Azure Skysnake King\u2019s attacks, his swordplay had become perfected, with each sword blow that he delivered having not a single flaw at all.\u201cMy swordplay\u2026\u201d Ning\u2019s face slowly was covered with a smile.\u201cHahahaha!!!!\u201dNing suddenly laughed loudly, laughed joyfully. \u201cI broke through, hahaha! Azure Skysnake King, thank you for helping me make this breakthrough. I\u2019ve finally reached the level of becoming \u2018one with the world\u2019 in swordplay.\u201dOne with the world!After having experienced these two major, bloody battles, especially with the amount of pressure which the Azure Skysnake King had placed him under, Ning had finally taken the final step and reached the level of being \u2018one with the world\u2019 in swordplay! Actually, Ning had already reached the end of the \u2018advanced\u2019 level in both sets of sword techniques he knew, and had already been very close to breaking through. All he needed was a bit of good luck.If he had stayed in the West Prefecture City and slowly trained on his own through constant repetition, he probably would\u2019ve needed a few more years to break through.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cHisssss!\u201d A low, growling hiss. The Azure Skysnake King had been enraged. The arrogant beast hadn\u2019t expected that the youth he was hunting would suddenly have improved.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of being angry?\u201d Ning ran atop the surface of the water. \u201cI no longer fear you now!\u201d\u201cHisssssssssssss.\u201dHissing with fury, the Azure Skysnake King pounced wildly towards Ning, moving with even greater ferocity, no longer paying attention to its own defense. Previously, as the Azure Skysnake King had the advantage, it didn\u2019t pay too much attention to receiving wounds, but now, the Azure Skysnake King had decided that even at the cost of being wounded, it would still kill this arrogant, belittling human.\u201cCome, you liddle widdle snakey!\u201d Ning wielded Darknorth swords in his two hands. At this moment, he felt as though being able to display his swordplay was a sort of enjoyment, something which was graceful and elegant.He delivered one sword stroke after another, each one perfect and flawless.Even the simplest of chops and stabs were utterly unbreakable and immaculate!\u201cOur fight comes to an end here for today, Azure Skysnake King. This time, thank you so very much for helping me break through.\u201d Ning laughed loudly as he began to run away.Both of the Darknorth swords in his hands were currently executing the \u2018Watertight\u2019 stance of the [Raindrop Sutra]. He wasn\u2019t striving to land any blows, only to be able to defend himself, causing the Azure Skysnake King to be utterly unable to do anything to Ji Ning\u2026and in the blink of an eye, Ning fled far away.\u201dA long time later\u2026\u201cGrrrrrrr.\u201dThe Azure Skysnake King swam back. All it could do was raise its head towards the sky and roar in dissatisfaction. Over the course of its life, it had met multiple Xiantian level humans who had reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level, but it had still beaten the snot out of those humans\u2026but that youngster with the twin swords he had just faced used those two swords as though they were wielded by two separate people who were perfectly linked in their thoughts. Indeed, the threat posed by those twin swords was ten times greater than normal.No matter what sort of disadvantage Ning had been put into, and even if one of his swords had been forced out of position and no longer at the pseudo \u2018one with the world\u2019 level granted by his sword techniques, the other sword would still maintain the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level, causing his actual battle ability to be no lower than that of a single-weapon expert at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level.But now\u2026Ning had truly reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level, and his power had exploded. Even facing against a Xiantian Godbeast, he was still able to flee easily.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Swoosh!He ran as fast as the wind.\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d Ning was extremely delighted. He ran as he pleased atop the surface of the water, moving through Eastmount Marsh before entering the mountain forests. After running a long time, Ning leapt atop a large tree. Passing by the crown of the tree, with another leap, he sent himself floating gracefully several dozen more meters before landing by atop a cliff. With only a few more bounds, he ended up at the peak of this little mountain.Sitting down on the mountain peak, he leisurely withdrew a bottle of fruit wine from his kalestone, then raised his head and poured it into his mouth. And then, Ning happily shouted, \u201cEnjoyable! Today was so enjoyable.\u201dHe had battle against two Diremonsters, and had executed the Aquatic Rhino King! The other, more powerful Diremonster, the \u2018Azure Skysnake King\u2019, was indeed extremely powerful. Under the pressure of its attacks, Ning\u2019s swordplay had suddenly broken through and reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level.\u201cOne with the world!\u201dNing couldn\u2019t help but feel self-satisfied. \u201cAlthough the Xiantian level experts of West Prefecture City can use magic treasures, in terms of skill level, I imagine most of them are inferior to me.\u201d\u201cOnly, I don\u2019t know what level Father is at, exactly. Even before going out and adventuring, Father had become acknowledged as the number one expert of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, and had reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level long ago. Afterwards, he had gone adventuring for nearly ten years and met my mother\u2026and then ever since then, he had been living peacefully at the West Prefecture City. Nobody knows how strong he has become!\u201d Ning pondered this question. \u201cBut previously, when that Diremonster, Serpentwing, had attacked, that sword blow Father sent out from far away\u2026\u201dThat sword blow had truly been terrifying.\u201cMy father\u2019s skill level should still be stronger than mine.\u201d Ning shook his head. \u201cEnough of that. I\u2019m not even at the Xiantian level yet.\u201dXiantian lifeforms possessed extraordinary power.Even Ki Refiners at that level would be able to use all sorts of magic treasures, seals, and formations. As for Fiendgod Body Refiners\u2026they had all sorts of incredible transformations available to them, and they would truly be able to be described as Fiendgods. After all, during the ancient Fiendgod Era, those Fiendgods were all born at the Xiantian level.\u201cThe technique I am training in is acclaimed as the most powerful Fiendgod Body Refining technique. Not a single member of the Ji clan, in its entire history, has ever successfully reached the Xiantian level in it.\u201d Ning was worried about this. \u201cSo how should I break through, exactly?\u201dThe [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was simply too difficult!Actually, Ning\u2019s natural gifts, such as his utterly pure body, as clean as a newborn\u2019s, and the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique, caused the power of his already mighty soul to increase every day! It was extremely beneficial to him in body training, causing his rate of improvement to be extremely rapid. If he had been training in an ordinary Fiendgod Body Refining method, he would have broken through to the Xiantian level long ago.By contrast, in terms of Ki Refining, Ning\u2019s talent was a bit weaker.Because he had been injured while he was in the womb, his meridian system had been damaged. At that time, when his father, Ji Yichuan, and Prefecture Lord Ji Young had investigated the quality of the meridians in his body, they had found that it was very average. The vast majority of Xiantian lifeforms relied on Ki Refining to traverse the Path of Immortals. Fiendgod Body Refining was even more difficult. None of them had expected that although Ning\u2019s Ki Refining talent was rather poor, he would have such a monstrous aptitude for Body Refining.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] has notes.\u201d\u201cI have to \u2018merge Yin and Yang, fuse fire and water\u2019. The power of the Moon and the power of the Sun must combine into a whole, transforming into the \u2018Crimsonbright\u2019 divine power.\u201d Ning pondered this. \u201cBut how would one cause fire and water to fuse? How would one cause the power of the Moon and the Sun to combine into a whole?\u201dAll Ning knew was that fire and water didn\u2019t mix! How, then, could fire and water be fused?This was an extremely difficult step.\u201cI have to reach the Xiantian level!\u201d Ning suddenly rose to his feet. Standing at the mountain peak, his eyes were filled with desire. \u201cThe Xiantian level, in the distant Heaven Realm, is nothing more than a starting point! To the ancient Fiendgods, the Xiantian level is nothing more than the level they were at when they were first born! If I can\u2019t even break through to the Xiantian level, how can I possibly talk about being able to control my own destiny?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She stood there in the area outside the Metalstone Tribe, staring off into the distance.Her figure had attracted the attention and the gazes of this rustic tribe\u2019s youths. Ever since Autumn Leaf had arrived at the Metalstone Tribe, there had been no question that she had become the most beautiful girl here\u2026one youngster after another did their best to find opportunities to show off their strength and valor in front of her, but not a single one had been able to attract her interest.\u201cMiss Autumn Leaf is waiting for her young master, right?\u201d\u201cRight. I hear that Uncle Dala, upon returning, said that her young master is extremely powerful. Over a hundred Blue Guards of the Ironwood clan were all killed by that young master in the blink of an eye!\u201d\u201cOnly a powerful young master like that would be worthy of someone as beautiful as Miss Autumn Leaf.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that he encountered a Diremonster! Most likely, that powerful young master won\u2019t be able to survive his encounter with the Diremonster. When angered, Diremonsters can cause the entire area to change. That one had immediately killed a large group of people by freezing them to death. Uncle Dala and the others were only lucky enough to survive because they fled quickly. If that young master were to die, Miss Autumn Leaf would have to find another person to marry!\u201dThe youths of the tribe all watched from their position by the gate while speaking quietly amongst themselves.As far as they considered, a girl like Autumn Leaf was like one of the legendary goddesses\u2026compare to Autumn Leaf, the other girls of their tribe were as far beneath her as the earth was beneath the heavens.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Autumn Leaf stood there, staring into the distant mountain forest.She was waiting. Waiting for the most important man in her life.\u201cAutumn Leaf.\u201d A powerfully built figure strode out from the tribe. It was the other servant, Mowu. Mowu urged her, \u201cGo back and get some rest. Once the young master arrives, the guards at the gate of the tribe will definitely see him.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Autumn Leaf shook her head gently.Mowu looked at Autumn Leaf, and then he sat down as well on a nearby, chopped-through tree trunk. His forehead was furrowed in worry as well. After Uncle Dala had returned, he had found out that Ji Ning had begun battling with the \u2018Aquatic Rhino King\u2019, a Diremonster. As to what the results of that battle were, no one knew. Although in his heart, of course he still hoped that his young master would return, his rational mind was telling him\u2026the young master probably had met with misfortune!This was because Uncle Dala and the others had spent roughly two days on the journey back from Eastmount Marsh.Given young master Ning\u2019s speed, if he was still alive, he probably would have made his way to the Metalstone Tribe under half a day. Logically speaking, he should have reached the Metalstone Tribe before Uncle Dala and the others had arrived! But Uncle Dala and the others had been back for more than two days, but Ning had yet to return.\u201cIf the young master is dead\u2026Autumn Leaf and I will most likely have to die as well.\u201d Mowu said quietly.If their master died, how could the servants continue to live?Local hegemons such as the Ji clan had very strict internal regulations.\u201cHuh?\u201d Mowu suddenly blinked. From afar, he faintly saw an indistinct, yet familiar figure\u2026the young master\u2019s figure!\u201cYoung master!\u201d Autumn Leaf had already begun to rush over there.\u201cYoung master?\u201d\u201cMiss Autumn Leaf is running over.\u201d\u201cLook, there seems to be someone coming from that side. Could that be the young master which Miss Autumn Leaf has been waiting for?\u201d The youths standing guard at the gate whispered to each other, while some of them also immediately began to run inside the tribe to inform the other tribesmen.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Autumn Leaf watched as the fur-clad, smiling young man walked over. The past two days, she had been constantly repressing her own fear, her nervousness, her wild thoughts\u2026and now, all these various emotions caused her to suddenly begin to shed tears.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Autumn Leaf looked at Ning. \u201cI, I\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, I\u2019m back.\u201d With his astonishing eyesight Ning noticed that from afar, in the middle of the tribe, Uncle Dala and the one-armed man were currently walking in their direction. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cSo Dala made it back already. Was he the one who told you that I was battling with the Aquatic Rhino King? Just because I didn\u2019t come back for a few days, you were frightened this badly?\u201dAutumn Leaf did her best to hold back further tears.\u201cIt was just an Aquatic Rhino King. To your young master, it\u2019s barely worth mentioning.\u201d Ning winked at her, seemingly in extremely high spirits.Autumn Leaf breathed out in astonishment, \u201cYoung master, you killed the Diremonster?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d Ning nodded delightedly.\u201cWow, a Diremonster. Young master, you killed a Diremonster.\u201d Autumn Leaf was extremely excited. \u201cYoung master, you are only eleven years old, but you killed a Diremonster. This\u2026this\u2026\u201d As a personal maidservant, Autumn Leaf\u2019s life centered around Ning. As she always revolved around him, to her, Ning was like her most important family member. Naturally, Autumn Leaf was truly excited to learn that Ji Ning was now capable of killing Diremonsters.\u201dJi Ning hurriedly lowered his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t spread the news.\u201d\u201cRight, right.\u201d Autumn Leaf nodded hurriedly.\u201cCome, let\u2019s go take a look at the Metalstone Tribe.\u201d Ning said. The past few days, Ning had been in the mountain forests, pondering the results of the past two day\u2019s battles. He had also come to realize some mistakes he had made in the previous battles. After careful pondering and consideration of the two sword techniques he had used, he had actually improved quite a bit further.Ning led Autumn Leaf towards the gate of the Metalstone Tribe.Uncle Dala and a group of tribesmen were there, and they went up to welcome him. Leading the tribesmen was a balding old man with white hair. The balding old man walked over and bowed repeatedly with respect. \u201cI, Tyson of the Metalstone Tribe, would like to thank you, mighty young master, for having repeatedly saved the lives of the tribesmen of my Metalstone Tribe. All the clansmen of the Metalstone Tribe feel boundless gratitude for you\u2026and we\u2019ve been waiting for your return.\u201dNing smiled and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with your Metalstone Tribe for a period of time. As for \u2018rescued\u2019, all I did was help out in passing. Also\u2026for now, I don\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, understood.\u201d The balding old man nodded repeatedly.\u201cDala.\u201d Ning looked over.The tall, powerful, bear-like Uncle Dala hurriedly stepped forward, seemingly very excited. \u201cYoung master, when I saw that you returned, I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Ning laughed. \u201cYou helped me for a month in Eastmount Marsh. I told you that when I returned to the Metalstone Tribe, I would definitely reward you heavily. Take this.\u201d As he spoke, within his hands, three \u2018beastheads\u2019 of gold appeared. He tossed it over, each beasthead weighing ten pounds. This bear-like Uncle Dala instantly was stupefied.And then, he hurriedly caught them all, while the surrounding tribesmen all stared at him with envy.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Ning looked at Mowu and Autumn Leaf, then headed straight into the Metalstone Tribe.Ning could easily have given an even more valuable gift, but to a small tribe like the Metalstone Tribe, which had barely a thousand people, truly valuable treasures might cause a disaster instead!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Within the Metalstone Tribe.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Autumn Leaf poured some fruit wine for Ning, then offered him some fruit and some delicacies. \u201cMowu and I have been in this tribe for a month now. Not soon after arriving, we got in touch with our Ji clan.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Ning nodded.While adventuring, every month he had to reach out to and contact the scattered troops of the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture who were stationed in various places throughout the area.\u201cThere is a letter from the West Prefecture City.\u201d Autumn Leaf withdrew a scroll from her sleeves.Ning accepted it. He rolled the yellow parchment open, and as he did, he couldn\u2019t help but reveal a smile. This was a letter his mother had personally written to him! The letter didn\u2019t contain too much; it mainly just consisted of some words of concern. But having just experienced a life-and-death battle, the nagging of his mother actually filled Ning\u2019s heart with a sense of warmth.\u201cEnough, Autumn Leaf. It looks as though it\u2019s been many days since you had a good rest. Go get some rest.\u201d Ning said.\u201cI\u2019m not tired.\u201d Autumn Leaf hurriedly said.\u201cGo.\u201d Ning ordered.Autumn Leaf hurriedly lowered her head, obediently going back to her own room to get some rest.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Time moved on. Every ten days or so, he would make a trip to Eastmount Marsh. Most of the time, though, Ning remained within the Metalstone Tribe, practicing his sword techniques. In the blink of an eye, over a month had passed.Ning was currently seated on the eaves of his house, holding a bamboo reed that was filled with fine fruit wine. \u201cAlthough West Prefecture City is large, it isn\u2019t as comfortable as these small tribes.\u201dResting at sundown, heading out at sunrise.The Metalstone Tribe showed great solidarity. Everyone helped each other, and they all treated each other like brothers.\u201cQuick, quick, quick.\u201d\u201cEveryone, go back.\u201d\u201cQuick, bundle everything up.\u201dSuddenly, the formerly peaceful tribe instantly became a chaotic bedlam of activity. This caused Ning, who was drinking wine leisurely on the top of his building, to grow confused. He immediately leapt down from the building, then grabbed one of the running youths. \u201cYou.\u201d\u201cYoung master.\u201d The youth, seeing that it was Ning who grabbed him, immediately greeted him respectfully.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ning asked. \u201cWhy did the tribe suddenly turn so chaotic? Weren\u2019t you training in spear-fighting just now? Why did you stop?\u201d\u201cThe people of the Blackmount Tribe are coming!\u201d The youth hurriedly said. \u201cThe people of Blackmount Tribe have come to collect furs from us. We need to hide some of the finer furs which the tribe has, as otherwise, if the Blackmount Tribe discovers them, they\u2019ll take them for their own. That would be terrible. Young master, I need to get back immediately\u2026\u201dNing, understanding, nodded. \u201cGo ahead.\u201dAutumn Leaf was watching this from in front of the building as well. She spoke out, \u201cThe Blackmount Tribe is an extremely large tribe with tens of thousands of tribesmen. Each year, these smaller tribes will have to offer them some tribute.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201d Ning frowned. \u201cThis land belongs to the Ji clan! Only my Ji clan has the right to levy taxes. If the Blackmount Tribe is forcing the nearby, smaller tribes to pay them tribute, isn\u2019t that the same as levying a tax?\u201dThe Ji clan levied and collected taxes from every singlet tribe within its borders.At the same time, the Ji clan itself was a subject of the Grand Xia Dynasty, and so most of the tax they collected had to be delivered to the Grand Xia Dynasty!\u201cIn principle, yes.\u201d Autumn Leaf shook her head. \u201cBut how would these smaller tribes dare to refuse? If they were to refuse, the Blackmount Tribe is completely capable of utterly destroying them, then selling off the captives as slaves.\u201dNing let out a long sigh.Right.Because there were too many tribes, there was no way for the Ji clan to manage all of the internecine squabbles between the tribes, so they usually left them to their own devices. Not just the Ji clan\u2026even the Grand Xia Dynasty, who ruled over an enormous, boundless expanse of territory, had to govern in a loose fashion. Wasn\u2019t the Ji clan and the Ironwood clan also in a state of war, viewing each other as deadly enemies? If one\u2019s territory was too large, it became hard to govern!\u201cThey are coming.\u201d Autumn Leaf said. \u201cThe Blackmount Tribe\u2019s tribesmen are coming.\u201dNing looked over as well. He saw that from afar, a group of half-armored, pelt-clad tribesmen were currently strutting around in the area, looking around as if they were in territory which belonged to them. The leader of the Metalstone Tribe, Uncle Dala, and the others were all by their sides, obediently following them, not daring to disobey them at all.The leader of this Blackmount squad, Braveshell, was currently viewing this little tribe with satisfaction.\u201cHmph.\u201d Braveshell glanced at the nearby Metalstone tribesmen. Seeing the frightened, supplicatory looks on their faces, he couldn\u2019t help but feel even more delighted.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven within the Blackmount Tribe, he was a high level, central figure. In a small tribe like this Metalstone Tribe\u2026he could act as he wished! If he was angered, this entire tribe would probably be finished. The hundred guards he had brought with him could probably destroy this sort of small tribe all by themselves. In this sort of small tribe, he had absolute authority.\u201cHuh?\u201d Braveshell suddenly saw that not too far away, there was a young man and a girl standing together. Braveshell\u2019s eyes instantly lit up. The guards by his side, looking along with him, couldn\u2019t help but hold their breaths as well.\u201cBeautiful. Mesmerizing.\u201d Braveshell was instantly stunned, and then his heart was instantly overwhelmed with powerful lust and desire. He definitely had to seize this beautiful girl and make her his personal maidservant. Every day, he would definitely \u2018bestow his affections\u2019 on her! Just thinking about it made Braveshell feel the blood pumping through his entire body.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Laughing loudly, Braveshell walked directly towards the young man and the girl.Ning frowned slightly as he looked at this tall man walking towards him, who was wearing some exquisitely crafted ornaments. The tall men swept Ning and Autumn Leaf with a gaze, as though he were a high ranking tribesman inspecting some goods. In particular, he didn\u2019t disguise the greedy look in his eyes when he was staring at Autumn Leaf. \u201cYour fur clothes were cut and stitched so exquisitely. Did you make it yourself, miss?

This tiny little Metalstone Tribe\u2026I can do what I wish to it, much less \u2018impudent\u2019. I\u2019ll tell you the truth. I\u2019ve taken a fancy to you. Follow me obediently. The last time I took a fancy to a girl, that girl was quite stubborn. She preferred to commit suicide than follow me, so I wiped out her entire family, and sold off her entire clan as slaves! For your little brother here, and your clansmen, you need to make a good decision!\u201dTribesfolk were straightforward individuals. They weren\u2019t very calculating, but at the same time, they were very bloodthirsty. Most of them didn\u2019t fear death, especially beautiful girls like the one in front of him right now. They were definitely the shining jewels of their tribes, and generally they were all very prideful. It was quite common for such beautiful girls to rather commit suicide than to submit to others, once their pride took hold of them. Braveshell didn\u2019t want to see this happen.\u201cVenerable Lord Braveshell.\u201d The balding elder, Tyson, hurriedly urged him, \u201cThese three do not belong to my Metalstone Tribe. There come from a very large tribe!\u201d\u201cA large tribe?\u201d Braveshell\u2019s eyebrows twitched. \u201cNo wonder. I was just wondering how a place like your Metalstone Tribe could produce such a graceful young lady. Miss, tell me what tribe you belong to.\u201d As he spoke, he moved two steps forward, wanting to stroke Autumn Leaf\u2019s face. Autumn Leaf directly delivered a lightning-fast kick to him.Bang!This heavy kick was powered by rage, and it struck heavily upon Braveshell\u2019s chest. Not only did it shatter the ornaments covering his chest, it also sent Braveshell falling back over his head.\u201cImpudent!\u201d\u201cClang!\u201dThe Blackmount guards instantly shouted in anger, and some of them even drew their blades.Braveshell quickly climbed up. He wiped away a hint of blood from the corner of his mouth, then reached out to stop his guards. All his guards knew exactly how vicious and diabolical Braveshell could be, for him to have become a high level, core member of a tribe as large as the Blackmount tribe.\u201cIt\u2019s all over.\u201d\u201cThis young miss is going to suffer a terrible fate.\u201dThe guards all understood that when Braveshell was clearly furious but temporarily suppressed his anger, it only represented\u2026that Braveshell was truly livid! He was currently considering how to vent his fury!Braveshell was on his feet now. His eyes were narrowed, staring at the three like a poisonous viper. He slowly said, \u201cThat kick was rather heavy. Can you let me know where the three of you have come from, exactly? Is it a large tribe, or is it the mighty Ji clan?\u201d\u201cTake a good look.\u201d Mowu stepped forward coldly, revealing with a flip of his hand an emblem.The emblem had a single word on it: Ji!\u201cJi!\u201dMany of the faces of the surrounding guards changed. They all looked at their leader, Braveshell, whose face had turned ashen. He hurriedly bowed in terror, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that I would accidentally offend you. Please pardon me.\u201dMowu\u2019s eyes contained a hint of pity in them, because he knew how much his young master hated evildoers.Autumn Leaf also glanced coldly at Braveshell. Ever since Braveshell said that he had once destroyed a small tribe for the sake of seizing a girl, and sold off all the tribesmen as slaves, Autumn Leaf had felt utter revulsion for him. Because she herself had been sold off after her tribe had been destroyed.Ji Ning simply looked at Braveshell. In an instant, he had already determined that he would punish Braveshell with death!Braveshell had destroyed an entire tribe for no cause? When Ning thought of how the women and children in that tribe had died miserable deaths or had been sold, Ning\u2019s heart was filled with boundless rage! Although this area contained many hidden evildoers, and Ning couldn\u2019t possibly stop them all, when he encountered them, he could never suppress the fury he felt!\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Braveshell, whose face had been ashen, suddenly cracked his lips and laughed, laughed brightly. \u201cIt seems the three of you already have a killing intention. I really don\u2019t know if I should call you stupid or arrogant!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Ning frowned slightly.Braveshell continued to laugh. \u201cSo what if you are of the Ji clan? How many youngsters of the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan go out adventuring as part of their coming-of-age, and how many of them have died! How could the Ji clan possibly discover\u2026if their clansmen were killed by monstrous beasts, or by other tribesmen?\u201d\u201cEven if you have a high status, in this place, you are nothing more than three people. Thus, even if you want to kill me, you should hide it in your hearts\u2026as the books say, \u2018distant water cannot quench a nearby drought\u2019. No matter what your status is, no one will be able to save you.\u201d Braveshell sighed. \u201cI still remember how three years ago, I once enjoyed a young girl of the Ji clan. Her skin was truly fine. My servants all enjoyed her as well, and afterwards, we fed her to the beasts who ate her clean!\u201d\u201cDo you understand now?\u201d Braveshell\u2019s eyes were shining. \u201cStatus doesn\u2019t represent power. At least in this place, I am the one who determines your life and death!\u201d\u201cEveryone.\u201dBraveshell raised his head and said in a loud voice. \u201cMake your move. Kill the two men, spare the woman! After I enjoy her first, each of you will have your chance!\u201d\u201cWooo!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cHaha, let\u2019s do it!\u201dBraveshell\u2019s guards all drew out their blades and swords, valiantly charging forward. The high level military leaders of large tribes trusted their own servants and slaves the most. Whether it was Ji Lee or Ji Yichuan, they all had their own trusted servants and slaves, who would definitely obey them without question.Under Braveshell\u2019s orders, these guards, who were born into his servitude, all dared to charge forward and kill!\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Suddenly, a voice rang out like spring thunder, exploding in the skies.In the skies above, there was someone standing atop an enormous flying bird. That person drew out his longsword and brandished it downwards. In but a second, sword energy criss-crossed everywhere\u2026one ray of sword energy after another rained down, and each blow of sword energy pierced through a guard, easily chopping their bodies apart, sending fresh blood spewing everywhere.\u201cAaaaah!\u201d \u201cNooooooo!\u201d \u201cAaaaah!\u201dAll sorts of miserable cries rang out, but soon, everything became silent again.The hundred-plus servant guards, who had been shouting savagely, all collapsed on the ground. Some had large holes in their chest, while others had been chopped apart. Blood stained the ground. All of them had died miserable deaths! But not a single one of the utterly terrified tribesmen of the Metalstone Tribe had been struck.\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026but\u2026\u201d Braveshell had thought that everything was under his control, but now, his face turned ashen. He stood there numbly, staring at his dead servants, and then at the man standing on the giant bird in mid-air. He stuttered, \u201cXian\u2026Xiantian\u2026\u201dThe people of the Metalstone Tribe all raised their heads. Some were dumbfounded, others were awestruck, while some of the girls in particular just stared unblinkingly.Ning, Autumn Leaf, and Mowu all raised their head to take a look as well.Swoosh!The man jumped down from his mid-air position on the back of the giant bird, landing on the ground.\u201cYoung master.\u201d The man bowed slightly as he said to Ning, demonstrating his respect for Ning.This scene caused all the members of the Metalstone Tribe, as well as Braveshell, feel stunned. Because just then, those lines of energy attacks represented that this person was a Xiantian lifeform! A Xiantian lifeform, in any tribe, no matter how large, was definitely a person of the highest status. Even in the Ji clan, they were high level, core members!Generally speaking, the adventuring youths of the Ji clan who encountered Xiantian lifeforms all had to pay their respects first. But this Xiantian lifeform was actually paying his respects to this youngster?\u201cSpare me.\u201d Braveshell threw himself forward, kneeling in front of Ning, begging, \u201cMighty young master, those words that I said earlier were all wild ravings. I\u2019ve never done such a thing! In addition, once, when I was collecting furs from some small tribes, I acquired a special treasure. It definitely is a magic treasure! As to what type of magic treasure it is, I don\u2019t understand either\u2026as long as you are willing to spare me, young master, I am willing to give this magic treasure\u2026\u201dBefore he even finished speaking.Hu.Braveshell suddenly threw himself towards Ning, his right hand forming a claw, wanting to rip out Ning\u2019s throat. At such a close range\u2026generally speaking, even late stage Houtian experts would find it hard to dodge.\u201cHrmph.\u201d With a casual wave of his hand, despite striking out later, Ning\u2019s hand slapped down onto Braveshell\u2019s skull before Braveshell finished his attack. Braveshell\u2019s body trembled, and then blood began pouring out of his nose and his ears, and his body weakly tumbled to the ground.\u201cHe\u2019s a sly one.\u201d Ning said softly.This Braveshell really was both crafty and vicious, venomous and diabolical, daring to do anything. Even though he knew that his chance of of dealing with the Xiantian level person was low, he immediately made the decision to first use the magic treasure to try and attract Ning\u2019s interest\u2026and then try to capture Ning. As long as he could take Ning hostage, he would have a chance at life.Unfortunately\u2026Ning was someone who could kill even Diremonsters with ease.\u201cSo him and those guards were all on the same side.\u201d The Xiantian level man said with a laugh. \u201cThose guards were all half-armored, while this person was dressed in furs\u2026I hadn\u2019t noticed him.\u201d\u201cThank you for your assistance, elder apprentice-brother.\u201d Ning said with a laugh.The man in front of him was one of the nine major disciples which his father, Ji Yichuan, had trained. His name was Wanfang, and he was an early Xiantian lifeform. Within the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, his status was fairly high, but at his current level of power, he wasn\u2019t quite eligible yet to take command over the black armored riders, while Ning, being the next Prefecture Lord, had an extremely high status.\u201cIf you had been the one to act, young master, things would have gone just as easily.\u201d Wanfang sheathed his longsword while laughing. \u201cBut I came here for an important reason.\u201d\u201cImportant reason?\u201d Ning\u2019s face changed. He kept in touch with the West Prefecture once a month. The person who had come this time was his own elder apprentice-brother. One could imagine how important the reason was, for a Xiantian expert to personally make the journey.\u201cLet\u2019s chat inside.\u201d Ning said hurriedly.Ning glanced at the still-shocked Metalstone Tribesmen. \u201cDispose of the corpses. As for the Blackmount Tribe\u2026in a little while, I\u2019ll ask my elder apprentice-brother to make a trip to the Blackmount Tribe. You naturally won\u2019t have anything to worry about.\u201d\u201cThank you, young master!\u201dThe balding elder and the others all hurriedly fell to their knees. Only now did they understand how exalted Ning\u2019s status truly was. For even a Xiantian lifeform to greet him with respect\u2026a person like this, even the chieftain of the Blackmount Tribe would have to kneel before!Ning and Wanfang quickly entered the stone room, then closed the door.\u201cQuick.\u201d\u201cQuick, clean it up.\u201dThe people of the Metalstone Tribe were filled with pumping blood as they looked at the corpses on the ground. They felt both nervous and excited. Normally, they had to all but worship the ground on which these terrifying Blackmount tribesmen walked on, but now, all of them lay here dead.\u201cSo even you will have an ending like this.\u201d That cold, one-armed man gave a savage kick to the corpse of Braveshell, his eyes filled with rage and hate.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Within the room.Only Ning and Wanfang were present.\u201cElder apprentice-brother, what is the matter?\u201d Ning asked. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d\u201cBecause of the Diremonster, Serpentwing!\u201d Wanfang\u2019s face was solemn.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Our Ji clan of the West Prefecture should have people stationed at Serpentwing Lake, with multiple Xiantian experts present. Could it be that Serpentwing has escaped Serpentwing Lake?\u201dWanfang shook his head. \u201cIf he had simply escaped from Serpentwing Lake, that would be a minor affair! Alas, our Ji clan of the West Prefecture actually ended up helping out Serpentwing. Our Xiantian experts stationed at Serpentwing Lake constantly tried to kill him whenever possible, causing Serpentwing\u2019s every day to be filled with danger. There were several major battles as well! Under that pressure\u2026Serpentwing actually reached the peak of the Xiantian level!\u201d\u201cWhat?! Peak Xiantian level?!\u201d Ning was shocked.A peak Xiantian level Diremonster was truly dangerous. Even Eastmount Marsh had only a single peak Xiantian level Diremonster, that Ancient Snow Toad!\u201cThe Xiantian level experts of our Ji clan of the West Prefecture were only able to just barely survive through relying on their magic treasures. They had to just watch as Serpentwing disappeared!\u201d Wanfang sighed. \u201cAs soon as he heard this news, Master immediately went in pursuit!\u201d\u201cFather went in pursuit?\u201d Ning nodded.Wanfang nodded as well. \u201cBut that Serpentwing can both soar in the skies as well as dive into the seas. His speed is now much faster than before, and as soon as he enters the deep water, even a Zifu Disciple would find it hard to kill him. Master understood this as well, and this pursuit of his ended in failure. Thus, he ordered me to tell you of this affair and to make sure that you are careful. After all, previously, you killed his child.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Ning nodded solemnly. \u201cIt seems I need to leave this Metalstone Tribe now. Serpentwing, hrmph, I didn\u2019t expect he\u2019d survive this long, much less make a breakthrough!\u201d\u201cThis sort of old monster who has been training for thousands of years has accumulated significant experience. It isn\u2019t strange for him to make a breakthrough at last.\u201d Wanfang then said, \u201cThat\u2019s all there is to report. My mission is now complete.\u201dNing hurriedly advised him, \u201cApprentice brother Wanfang, those people you executed earlier belong to the Blackmount Tribe, located not far from here. Go help me rap their knuckles a bit!\u201d\u201cJust leave this sort of minor task to me.\u201d Wanfang nodded.\u2026\u2026\u2026.That very day, Ning led Autumn Leaf and Mowu out of the Metalstone Tribe. As to where he was headed\u2026Ning didn\u2019t inform anyone. Only by acting in such a way would he make it harder for Serpentwing to find him.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-A month after the Serpentwing Disaster, everything was calm again.Originally, after Serpentwing broke through to the peak Xiantian level, he charged out of Serpentwing Lake, beginning to vent his fury upon the area, causing great harm to the nearby tribes and devouring many humans, filling countless tribesmen with fear. He boldly went out in search of Ning, but the news that Ning was adventuring was a secret which few knew. Given that Ning himself was extremely vigilant as well, Serpentwing naturally couldn\u2019t find him!After half a month, Serpentwing encountered Ji Yichuan. Relying on his vastly increased strength, Serpentwing confidently did battle with him, but he didn\u2019t expect that once again, he would be badly injured. Still, his flying speed was much faster than before, and when he fled for his life, even Yichuan wasn\u2019t able to do anything to him. This battle resulted in Serpentwing coming to a decision; he never wanted to fight against Yichuan ever again. If he saw Yichuan, he would immediately run far away.Another month later, Poisondove Ridge stepped in!The Five Prefectures of the Ji clan negotiated with Poisondove Ridge, and the end result was\u2026\u2018The Diremonster, Serpentwing, is forbidden to leave Serpentwing Lake for a hundred years!\u2019\u2026\u2026..Time passed. In the blink of an eye, summer arrived.Within Eastmount Marsh.Two figures lay hidden within the aquatic grass. One was a half-red, half-white man with a vile aura and braided hair, while the other was a muscular man dressed in black.\u201cThe information you have is correct?\u201d The vile-looking man said softly. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited here for three days now.\u201dThe black-clothed man nodded. \u201cRecently, there is a youngster who often comes to fight against the Azure Skysnake King. Every ten or fifteen days, they\u2019ll do battle. In addition, their battles are generally in the area around here. Don\u2019t worry, Master. When the time comes, the Azure Skysnake King will definitely emerge from the depths, and once he enters our formation, he won\u2019t be able to escape!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The vile man nodded. \u201cFor the sake of this day, I have prepared for so long, and also spent an incredible price in order to acquire this Yin and Yang Twin Energy Formation. This time, we must capture the Azure Skysnake King alive and let it become my spirit beast!\u201d\u201cOnce the Azure Skysnake King enters the formation, its life and death will be entirely determined by you, Master.\u201d The black clothed man said.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d The vile man laughed gently. \u201cRight. That youth who often fights against the Azure Skysnake King, do you know who he is?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him.\u201d The black clothed man shook his head. \u201cI know all of the young geniuses of our Ironwood clan, and he isn\u2019t one of them. It seems as though this youngster\u2019s sword techniques are based on the Ji clan\u2019s [Raindrop Sutra].\u201d\u201cJi clan?\u201d A fierce look flashed through the vile man\u2019s eyes. \u201cFor him to be able to fight equally at such a young age with the Azure Skysnake King means that when he grows up, he\u2019ll most likely become yet another Yichuan\u2026since that\u2019s the case, then I, Ironwood Zhan, will give the Ji clan a hand and help them send their genius straight to the Yellow Springs of Hell.\u201dTime passed.Another half day went by. It was now sunset, and in the distance, a fur-clad youngster appeared, walking atop of the waves.\u201cMaster, he\u2019s here!\u201d The black clothed man hurriedly shouted.Zhan turned and looked. Seeing that Ning was walking on water as though it were flat ground, his pupils shrank. \u201cOne with the world!\u201d\u201cHe must die.\u201d Zhan\u2019s heart was now filled with a killing urge. At such a young age, this person was able to reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level. Once this terrifying youngster grew up\u2026he would be far more powerful than even the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan. He might even become the most powerful figure in the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan!\u201d\u201cBrother An!\u201d Ironwood Zhan hurriedly instructed. \u201cAfterwards, you go deal with that youth. Even if you can\u2019t kill him, don\u2019t let him get away. After I subdue the Azure Skysnake King, I\u2019ll immediately hurry over.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The black clothed man said respectfully.Ironwood Zhan stared grimly into the distance.To be able to reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level as a youth\u2026this sort of monstrous talent was countless times more talented than him, Ironwood Zhan. Fortunately, he, Zhan, had been training for over a hundred years. Relying on his years of accumulated strength, it would still be simplicity itself for him to slay this little child.\u2026\u2026\u2026Zhan was hiding within the aquatic grasses, and had secretly set up a formation in the area around this location. Neither their auras nor their voices would penetrate through it. If even their auras couldn\u2019t pass through\u2026then of course, there was no way to sense them. Ning, thus, also didn\u2019t sense their presence either.\u201cLittle snakey-snake.\u201d Ning stood on the surface of the water as he called out. \u201cStill not coming out?\u201dHis voice transmitted directly into the depths of the water.A moment later.BOOM!An enormous emerald serpent erupted forth from the waves, and then its body rapidly shrank to a length of around ten meters, while its head stared, swaying, at Ning while emitting a disdainful snort. Actually, over the course of his multiple battles against Ning, the Azure Skysnake King had gained some insights as well. The Azure Skysnake King had the feeling that he too was about to reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level. Although his battle ability was astonishing, he primarily relied on his natural gifts. In terms of skill level, he was inferior to Ji Ning.This sort of utterly ruthless battles against an opponent, with both using deadly, lethal blows, was the best way for an individual to improve!\u201cOnce I also reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level, you will definitely die.\u201d The Azure Skysnake King secretly said to himself.\u2018Haha, c\u2019mere, little snakey-snake.\u201d Two swords appeared out of nowhere in Ning\u2019s hands.Hua!The Azure Skysnake King flashed towards him like a bolt of green lightning, while Ning went forward to welcome him.\u2026\u2026\u2026Zhan, hiding in the distant aquatic grass, felt even more astonished. \u201cHis swordplay is also at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level! And he uses twin swords to such a perfect degree! It seems he isn\u2019t even a Xiantian lifeform yet, but he is able to fight head on with a Xiantian level Godbeast\u2026this sort of talent is absolutely terrifying! He must be destroyed as soon as possible!\u201d\u201cWhy haven\u2019t they entered yet?\u201d\u201cAlmost.\u201d Ironwood Zhan grew frantic with impatience.He had laid down his formation in advance. Although the formation took up a large amount of space, there was some distance between the formation and Ning\u2019s battle with the Azure Skysnake King.\u201cAlmost\u2026\u201dIronwood Zhan\u2019s heart was frantic, but he had to suppress his impatience. Because he knew that once he revealed himself\u2026the frightened Azure Skysnake King would instantly dive into the water, at which point he wouldn\u2019t have any chance at all to deal with him.All he could do was watch as the distant battle continued.Sometimes, Ning would be sent flying, while at other times, a wound would appear on the body of the Azure Skysnake King. The two battled amidst the waves, with Ning constantly gliding atop the waves, sometimes charging forward, other times dodging. On multiple occasions, they almost entered the formation, but the end, they didn\u2019t\u2026this truly was nerve wracking.\u201cSwish.\u201dOn one exchange of blows\u2026\u201cThey\u2019re in!\u201d Zhan\u2019s eyes were red. At this moment, Ning and the Azure Skysnake King had just barely entered the formation. They were at the very edges of it. But Zhan no longer dared to wait any longer. Perhaps in the next moment, Ning and the Azure Skysnake King would once more leave the area of the formation.\u201cUp!\u201dZhan\u2019s face was fierce.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ning, at the borders of the formation, suddenly felt a thrill race through his mind. This was because Ning\u2019s soul was already extremely powerful, so much so that he could unconsciously sense any deadly dangers nearby. An invisible terror suddenly filled Ning\u2019s head, and he had the feeling that if he didn\u2019t move, he might really die!\u201cRetreat!\u201d Ning glided backwards at maximum speed, and as he did so, he just so happened to leave the edges of the formation.\u2026\u2026\u2026..As Ning retreated past the edges of the formation, he saw that the surface of the water in front of him suddenly transformed into a scene of chaos. One enormous white energy wave after another appeared, intersecting with enormous black energy waves, creating countless \u2018nets\u2019 covering the area in front of him. The power of this enormous formation made Ning\u2019s heart shake.This was something set up by a late stage Xiantian Ki Refiner, who then suddenly released all the terrifying power he had previously placed in the surrounding area.\u201cThe Azure Skysnake King is within the formation!\u201d Ning\u2019s heart clenched. After having battled with this old opponent so many times, seeing that the opponent had fallen into the formation, Ning felt worry for him as well.\u201cGrooooowl.\u201dA black human figure suddenly flew into the air, transforming into a black Bi\u2019an Tiger that was over thirty meters long. The furry mane around its neck was spread out like an enormous fan, rising up to the heads. Its jade eyes were filled with savage fury, and it pounced directly towards Ning.\u201cA Bi\u2019an Tiger?!\u201d Ning instantly understood who it was that had set up the massive formation. \u201cThe only Xiantian lifeform who has a Bi\u2019an Tiger as his spirit-beast is Ironwood Zhan, of the Ironwood clan! A late-stage Xiantian expert!\u201d\u201cGotta go!\u201dNing knew very well the difference in power between the two of them. Ironwood Zhan was extremely famous, and was legendary for how sinister he was. When he used his magic treasures, even the Azure Skysnake King was far from being his match!\u201cSwish!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuddenly, a black light shot towards Ning.With a quick sword stroke and a \u2018clang\u2019 sound, Ning sent the black light flying back towards that Xiantian level Bi\u2019an Tiger. The Bi\u2019an Tiger roared, \u201cChild of the Ji clan, today, shall be the day of your death!\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201dA sharp, ear-piercing scream of pain shook the heavens, emanating from within that formation. Ning couldn\u2019t help but feel his heart shudder as well. He knew that this was the desolate cry of the Azure Skysnake King. Despite having fought with Ning for so long, the Azure Skysnake King had never before let out such a miserable sound. Clearly, it truly was in dire straits this time.\u201cLittle green snake, I hope you\u2019ll be able to survive this affair.\u201d Ning could only silently pray. Not daring to hesitate at all, he immediately began to flee across the surface of the lake while blocking the furious attacks of that Xiantian level Bi\u2019an Tiger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But with each step, waves exploded beneath his feet. After all, it had yet to reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level. It had to rely on its released monstrous energy to forcibly walk atop the water. In addition, it was only a land-based beast to begin with. Naturally, its running speed was even slower! Actually, even in the mountains, the forests, or the plains, its speed would probably still be slightly lower than Ning\u2019s, much less now, on water! It could only watch as Ning quickly escaped. \u201cGrrrr.\u201d The Bi\u2019An Tiger could only return. Staring at that ferocious battle going on within that massive formation, the Azure Skysnake King, occasionally expanding while occasionally contracting, the tiger mused, \u201cHow can this Azure Skysnake possibly resist the magical formation? No matter how long it struggles, in the end, it will have to submit!\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- The formation called upon the natural power of the world and had unimaginable strength! This Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation\u2019s power was far beyond the ability of the Azure Skysnake to resist. \u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201d Ironwood Zhan stood atop the water, pointing at the distant enormous emerald snake, which was currently entangled by those countless streams of black and white energy. \u201cAzure Skysnake, now that you have fallen into my formation, no matter how much you struggle, it is useless. Best obediently surrender and acknowledge me as master. That way, you\u2019ll suffer a bit less!\u201d \u201cGroooowl.\u201d The Azure Skysnake raised its head, roaring with fury. \u201cYou don\u2019t submit?\u201d Although Zhan didn\u2019t understand, he could sense the Azure Skysnake\u2019s fury and enmity. He immediately laughed coldly, \u201cAzure Skysnake, in this boundless world, it is the human race which is truly in charge! It is the Grand Xia Dynasty who has unified this land! No matter how powerful you are, Godbeast, what can you really do? Even if I release you, others will come to capture you. I think you had best obediently submit to me!\u201d Ironwood Zhan was speaking nonstop. But no matter what he said, the Azure Skysnake didn\u2019t pay attention to him, causing Zhan to truly grow angry. \u201cFine, then. I want to watch and see\u2026if your bones are tougher, or if my Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation is tougher!\u201d \u201cCrackle\u2026\u201d Black and white energy streams were wildly wrapping about it like a millstone, grinding the Azure Skysnake\u2019s scales to the point of shattering, with its jade blood staining the water below. But this scale-ripping, flesh-tearing pain couldn\u2019t make the Azure Skysnake lower its proud head in the slightest. Shua! The Azure Skysnake suddenly shrank to the thickness of a finger, temporarily escaping the entanglement of the black and white energy streams, but immediately afterwards, the energy streams once more wildly wrapped around it. The energy continued to dissipate and reform without end! How arduous would it be to avoid these energy streams? \u201cAaaaargh!\u201d The finger-thick, miniature Azure Skysnake let out a fierce cry, suddenly transforming to an enormous size once again, even larger than Serpentwing! Sometimes large, sometimes small, it continuously struggled. Only in this way would it be able to reduce the amount of time the Yin Yang energy streams ground down upon it. After all, that grinding sensation truly, truly was painful. At the same time the little Azure Skysnake was struggling, it was repeatedly trying to pounce towards Zhan as well. But the power of the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation was simply too great, not giving it the slightest chance to draw near Zhan. Struggling repeatedly, the wounds on its body grew greater and greater. Its scales were shattered, and its jade blood leaked out. \u201cYaaaaaaa!\u201d \u201cYaaaaaaa!\u201d One fierce cry after another. The Azure Skysnake King was still struggling. As a monstrous beast, it was incomparably arrogant. How could it submit to this human in front of it? If it was a human Zifu Disciple, perhaps the Azure Skysnake would have been willing to lower its head, but this Ironwood Zhan wasn\u2019t qualified. \u201cHuh?\u201d After a long time, Zhan began to frown. \u201cHow is it still struggling?\u201d Zhan stared at the Azure Skysnake, still incomparably wild despite being badly injured and being covered in wounds. \u201cAlthough only part of the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation\u2019s power has been released, if it keeps on acting like this, it will be ground to death by the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation! Can it be that it would rather die than submit to me?\u201d Zhan gritted his teeth. With a thought, he caused the black and white energy streams binding the Azure Skysnake to begin to dissipate. \u201cAzure Skysnake!\u201d Zhan pointed at the wounded, exhausted Diremonster. \u201cI relied on the formation to suppress you, so most likely, you aren\u2019t convinced! Then you and I shall do battle. I won\u2019t rely on the assistance of the formation\u2026as long as you can defeat me, I will release you. But if you lose, then you\u2019ll submit to me. Agreed?\u201d \u201cYaaaaaa!\u201d The Azure Skysnake let out a few vicious sounds, then transformed to a length of ten or so meters. This was the most powerful form it could transform into. And then, it pounced towards Zhan! \u201cHmph.\u201d A long black whip appeared out of nowhere in Ironwood Zhan\u2019s right hand. The whip had multiple natural-growing sharp nails embedded into it. This long black whip was the magic treasure, \u201cBlackwood Vinewhip\u201d. It was one of the famous magic treasures of the Ironwood clan. With a powerful whipping motion, he sent the whip towards the Azure Skysnake, and it transformed into an enormous black blur. Shua! Shua! The Azure Skysnake rapidly dodged, managing to move past this whip. \u201cHuahuahua\u2026\u201d Ironwood Zhan continued to brandish the long whip in his hand. The whip spun in circle upon circle, covering the skies in countless enveloping circles towards the Azure Skysnake. And then, with a ripping sound, the Azure Skysnake lost yet another piece of scale and flesh from its body. \u201cSssssssssssss.\u201d The Azure Skysnake let out a furious hiss. Despite being wounded, it still pounced forward. Zhan only smiled coldly, continuing to brandish his Blackwood Vinewhip. This wasn\u2019t the first time for him to fight against the Azure Skysnake. He was an expert at using the whip, and was completely able to counter the Azure Skysnake\u2019s agility! However, the Azure Skysnake was capable of fleeing very quickly. In the past, Zhan wasn\u2019t able to do anything about it, but now that the Azure Skysnake was trapped within the formation, there was nowhere for it to run. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Zhan stood there, long whip dancing, with each whipping blow containing a power capable of cracking a small mountain, causing the Azure Skysnake\u2019s body to crack open on multiple locations. \u201cMy strength is greater than yours. You had best obediently submit.\u201d \u201cPa!\u201d The magic treasure\u2019s slammed against its body. Given that Zhan himself was a late-stage Xiantian expert, he was completely capable of suppressing it. \u201cSwoosh!\u201d This time, as it dodged past through dancing long whip, the Azure Skysnake suddenly disappeared, and then reappeared a few dozen meters away. Ironwood Zhan was astonished, but immediately afterwards, his face changed greatly. \u201cSssssss\u2026\u201d The Azure Skysnake called out in excitement, while at the same time, with every single slithering motion of its body, it seemed to teleport dozens of meters, if not even farther. \u201cDie!\u201d Ironwood Zhan\u2019s face was ferocious, and he seemed to have gone insane. Rumble\u2026. The formation shuddered, and large amounts of black and white energy vicious slammed down towards the Azure Skysnake, but the Azure Skysnake only glanced icily at Ironwood Zhan, then disappeared with another slither. \u201cBang!\u201d The black and white energy collided, transforming into large amounts of chaotic energy. \u201cDamnable!\u201d Ironwood Zhan howled madly, fists waving furiously. \u201cDamnable!!!\u201d \u201cVoid Blink! Void Blink!\u201d Ironwood Zhan\u2019s face was ferocious, and his eyes were red and insane. \u201cThis Azure Skysnake is actually capable of using Void Blink. Right. It is due to that child of the Ji clan. That child of the Ji clan has battled against the Azure Skysnake repeatedly\u2026it must be that this has caused the Azure Skysnake to improve, allowing it to reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level and be able to utilize the Void Blink!\u201d Ironwood Zhan was utterly enraged. Although there was only a single Azure Skysnake in the Swallow Mountain area, there were quite a few in the boundless territory ruled over by the Grand Xia Dynasty. Thus, Ironwood Zhan knew very well how powerful Azure Skysnakes were, which was why he so desperately wanted to tame this one. Generally speaking, Diremonsters were capable of controlling water, or poison, or fire, or son on and so forth. Even the likes of the Aquatic Rhino King and Serpentwing, non-Godbeast creatures, had this ability. But as a Godbeast, the Azure Skysnake King didn\u2019t have a special ability\u2026 But actually, it still had something! Only, the Azure Skysnake King\u2019s natural ability was simply too powerful. While it was at a low level of power, it wasn\u2019t capable of utilizing it. Much like how a normal monstrous beast wasn\u2019t capable of controlling water at the Houtian stage but was able to at the Xiantian stage, this Azure Skysnake King\u2019s natural ability had to do with the \u2018Void\u2019. Even after it reached the Xiantian lifeform level, it still had to reach the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level before it was capable of instantly becoming one with the void, allowing it to utilize the Void Blink technique! \u201cVoid Blink!\u201d Ironwood Zhan ground his teeth. \u201cA Azure Skysnake King capable of developing the Void Blink technique will quickly become incomparably powerful!\u201d The Void Blink\u2026 This allowed the Azure Skysnake to be capable of going to some very secretive places, and even go steal some of the world\u2019s spirit fruits. This represented that its growing speed was about to enter a phase of explosive growth! Without question, this Azure Skysnake King was about to leave Eastmount Marsh and begin an adventuring journey. After all, only by going to other places would it be capable of acquiring more natural treasures and grow more rapidly in power. If it always stayed here comfortably, it would be a waste of its talent! \u201cGiven the amount of hatred it bears me, in the future, when it returns to Swallow Mountain, it might come looking for me seeking revenge.\u201d Zhan was both furious and frightened. \u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!\u201d Ironwood Zhan bellowed in fury, the sound of his roars causing even the water to explode! He was furious. \u201cAll because of that Ji clan child!\u201d Ironwood Zhan ground his teeth, filled with utter hatred. If Ji Ning hadn\u2019t caused the Azure Skysnake King to advance so rapidly, how could it have suddenly made a breakthrough during this battle? Most likely, Zhan would have already tamed the Azure Skysnake. Now, he not only had been unable to tame it, he had also offended a powerful future enemy. The Azure Skysnake would definitely remember this grudge! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 The massive formation vanished. Ironwood Zhan collected all eight of the formation flags, then walked out atop the water, a sinister, shadowy look on his face. \u201cMaster.\u201d The Bi\u2019An Tiger transformed into a black-clothed man, flying over. Seeing the look on his master\u2019s face, he knew that the taming attempt had failed. He hurriedly said, \u201cMaster, don\u2019t be angry. This Azure Skysnake was simply too foolish. It was its own fault that Master killed it!\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t die!\u201d Ironwood Zhan said coldly. \u201cIt didn\u2019t die?!\u201d The black-clothed was astonished. \u201cThen it?\u201d Ironwood Zhan shook his head. \u201cIt actually managed to comprehend the Void Blink technique. It fled.\u201d \u201cButbutbut\u2026\u201d The black-clothed man found it hard to believe as well. The Azure Skysnake had actually managed to comprehend the Void Blink technique at the critical juncture. \u201cAll of it is the fault of that Ji clan child.\u201d Zhan said coldly. \u201cHis power was on par with the Azure Skysnake. After repeated battles, the Azure Skysnake has improved greatly. Thus, during this battle, it suddenly sensed the world, allowing it to become \u2018one with the void\u2019 and use the Void Blink technique! This Ji clan\u2019s child ruined everything. I will definitely strip his skin and rip his tendons. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to get rid of this fury in my heart!\u201d The black-clothed man nodded repeatedly. \u201cMaster, don\u2019t worry. Before this, I shot several of my back-spikes at him, which are stained with the \u2018Iceflower Liquid\u2019. Some of the Iceflower Liquid has already gotten onto his body. As long as we release the Ice Wasp, we\u2019ll definitely be able to find him. \u201cFine.\u201d Zhan withdrew a gray sack from his waist. Loosening the sack, a semi-translucent, gem-like wasp flew out at high speed. \u201cPursue.\u201d Zhan and the Bi\u2019an Tiger followed behind the Ice Wasp at high speed. After they left, a green snake suddenly emerged atop the peaceful water. The green snake stared from afar, a look of hope in its eyes. After it had battled against Ji Ning so many times, the two of them were evenly matched for so long. In addition, Ning had helped contribute to it being able to break through to the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level of movement technique and comprehend the Void Blink technique. It felt some gratitude towards Ning. \u201cSsssss\u2026.\u201d The Azure Skysnake let out a soft sound. It hoped Ning would be able to escape. It had already done what it was capable of. After all, although right now, he had very formidable fleeing abilities, in terms of actual power, he was far from being Ironwood Zhan\u2019s match.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After leaving Eastmount Marsh, he continued to flee at high speed, moving most likely over a thousand kilometers through the mountain forests before coming to a halt. Actually, by now, the Golden Crow [the Sun] had already completely sunk beneath the horizon. However, the eastern horizon was still very red, and there was still some light cast on the ground.\u201cWhew!\u201d Ning wiped the sweat from his forehead.\u201cI first ran three hundred kilometers on water, then another thousand kilometers on land. In addition, I was moving at my maximum speed. I\u2019ve never run like this before. I didn\u2019t expect that even with a body like mine, I still ended up so sweaty.\u201d Ning usually could run for a thousand kilometers on Eastmount Marsh without sweating at all, but this time, he really had moved at his utmost speed.Feeling exhausted, Ning slowly walked forward. There was a pool in front of him, and within the pool, there were a few floating lotus flowers. The flowers were not stained at all by the mud, and their stems were straight. The fragrance of the lotuses entered his nose, causing the exhausted Ning to let out a hint of a smile as he sat down next to the pool.\u201cI guess I managed to make it through that setback.\u201d Ning withdrew a bamboo reed with a flip of his hand. The reed was filled with clean water. Raising his head, he took two gulps.\u201cI wonder how the little green snake is doing.\u201d Ning sighed lightly. \u201cLittle green snake, don\u2019t blame me. I\u2019m not able to help you either. Alas, I haven\u2019t reached the Xiantian level.\u201d\u201cXiantian!\u201dJust thinking about this made Ning feel a hint of worry.The [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], as the most powerful Fiendgod Body Refining method, was extremely powerful, but training it was simply too difficult. Even someone with his background found it so hard to breakthrough. \u2018Merge Yin and Yang, Fuse Fire and Water\u2019. How was this accomplished?\u201cWhat do I need to do in order to break through?\u201d Ning pondered bitterly.Hu!A gentle breeze blew by. The cool, summer night breeze was so comfortable. The breeze wafted through the lotus flowers in the pool. Some spun in place, first towards one direction, then towards the other.Having reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level in the [Shadewind Steps], Ning naturally was able to mentally become one with the wind. When the wind blew past the lotus blossom, he could clearly sense\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201d Ning suddenly revealed a look of curiosity. \u201cWhen the wind blows the lotus, it turns both left, then right!\u201dNing suddenly felt as though he understood something.\u201cIf a leaf is blown by the wind, it will be blown wildly without any rhythm at all!\u201d\u201cIf it was a small tree that was being blown down by the wind, it would only shake from left to right! That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t have any enormous round leaves.\u201dBut when the lotus flower is blown upon, the petals of the lotus can turn left or turn right, cancelling out this force.\u201dRaising his head, Ning stared at the sky. It wasn\u2019t completely dark yet, but in the skies, he could already faintly see the light of the moon. \u201cThe Golden Crow [Sun] falls, and the Moon Rabbit [Moon] rises!\u201d\u201cTurn left, turn right!\u201d\u201cDay and night. Because there is day, thus there is the concept of night!\u201d Ning murmured to himself. \u201cIn a place of utter darkness, a tiny hint of light is incomparably brilliant! The left and right turns of the lotus petal allow it to cancel out the two contrasting spins, allowing it to cancel out the force of the wind and stay in place, unmoved.\u201dNing closed his eyes.His spirit was already \u2018one with the world\u2019, and he became one with the wind and the lotus flowers in the pool.He could faintly sense some sort of enormous Principle, which hid ancient secrets that had existed since the creation of the endless universe\u2026this secret, was the Dao [The Way]! The wind held the Dao within it, and the Dao itself was vast and unknowable. But when the wind blew past the lotus flower\u2026Ning was capable of seeing the shadow of the Dao flash through the lotus flowers. Capable of finding a hint of the movements and the true appearance of the Dao!Ning quietly sat there in the lotus position by the side of the pool, completely lost in thought as he attentively meditated on the hint of the \u2018Dao\u2019 which he had sensed from the lotus flowers circular movements.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Comprehending the Dao was something that one could hope for but not ask for.In that moment when his soul, his thoughts, the environment, and everything else all fused together, he was able to just barely touch a hint of the Dao. But in order to touch the Dao\u2026the prerequisite was that one would first have to become \u2018one with the world\u2019. Only after one\u2019s mind could completely become one with the world was one capable of touching the Eternal Dao.\u201cHuahuahua\u2026\u201d A stream of water slowly flowed through a small creek covered up by the wild grass.\u201cGugugu!\u201dNight descended, and the forest was now filled with the croaking of frogs.Slowly\u2026.Rays of light began to surround Ning, still seated in the lotus position. First, some rays of watery light appeared, slowly forming one enormous lotus petal after another around him. One watery lotus petal after another surrounded Ning, currently blossoming while swaying gently in the breeze.Immediately afterwards, dots of fiery light began to gather as well, forming into fiery lotus petals. These enormous lotus petals of flame also wrapped around Ning.Two layers of lotus petals.The first layer was of watery lotus petals. The second was of fiery lotus petals. Each layer had exactly three petals.\u201cHu!\u201d Fire and water intersected. A wind arose out of nowhere.Huahuahua\u2026.Between the two layers of lotus petals, a wind arose out of nowhere. The two layers of lotus petals began to swivel. The lower layer of watery lotus petals swiveled to the left, while the upper layer of fiery lotus petals were turning to the right! The two layers of lotus petals were completely turning in opposite directions\u2026slowly, sluggishly, they rotated, but Ning himself didn\u2019t utilize any of his own strength at all.Everything happened by nature.\u201cSwoosh!\u201d A gray-furred wolf loped out from within the forests, its jade eyes focused on that distant, fur-clad youth. Only, those enormous lotus petals, multiple meters in size, which were surrounding that fur-clad youth made the wolf slightly confused. As a beast with low intelligence, however, its innate sense was telling it that those rotating petals of fire and water were nothing more than part of the world, just like the clouds\u2026there was no need to pay attention to them.The gray wolf bared its fangs, staring at the fur-clad youth.It was very hungry!The fur-clad youth was just sitting there without moving, as though he was asleep. He definitely wouldn\u2019t have the ability to fight back. In addition, the flesh of this youth seemed so tender and delectable. The gray wolf could already feel its saliva coming into its mouth.It hesitated no more!\u201cSwoosh!\u201d The gray wolf charged forward rapidly, pouncing forward with fangs bared, preparing to bite down on that fur-clad youth.But as soon as it leapt within two meters of those layers of lotus petals\u2026\u201cBoom!\u201dThe wind created by those two layers of lotus petals contained within them a hint of the destructive force of the world. In an instant, it chopped that wolf into tiny pieces, with blood splattering everywhere, some seeping deep into the earth, while the rest flowed into the pool.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Nightfall.Ironwood Zhan and the Bi\u2019an Tiger he commanded, in the former of a black-clothed man, were currently following behind that Ice Wasp as they traversed the mountain forests.The Ice Wasp was just a wasp, after all. It wasn\u2019t an enormous flying beast, nor was it a Diremonster. One could imagine how much slower it was! It was far from being even a tenth as fast as Ning\u201cThis child of the Ji clan really can run.\u201d Ironwood Zhan\u2019s face was gloomy and sinister. \u201cAfter leaving Eastmount Marsh, he kept on fleeing\u2026\u201dThe black-clothed man said hurriedly, \u201cMaster, the Ice Hornet\u2019s flying speed is much slower. If this child of the Ji clan keeps running without stopping, all the way to one of the Prefectures of the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan, we probably won\u2019t have any way to catch him.\u201d\u201cRun all the way to one of the Five Prefectures?\u201d Ironwood Zhan shook his head. \u201cToo far. Eastmount Marsh is already at the borders of the Ji clan\u2019s territory. To run from the border to one of the Five Prefectures at once? That child of the Ji clan shouldn\u2019t run that far.\u201d Although he said this, in his heart, Zhan was worried as well. If Ning truly had run to any one of the Five Prefectures, no matter how confident Zhan was in his abilities, he wouldn\u2019t dare to charge into the lair of his enemies.\u201cWe\u2019ll slowly pursue him.\u201dIronwood Zhan said. \u201cWherever the Iceflower Liquid passes by, it will leave that unique aroma. It won\u2019t dissipate for at least three days. We can\u2019t smell it, but the Ice Wasp can. As long as that child of the Ji clan doesn\u2019t flee to the Five Prefecture, he will die!\u201d\u201cRight, he will die.\u201d The black-clothed man said hurriedly.\u201cHe ruined everything for me, and caused me to have a powerful future foe.\u201d Ironwood Zhan could visualize that Azure Skysnake adventuring in the outside world through the usage of its Void Blink, becoming more powerful, reaching the Zifu level, then coming back to kill him\u2026he couldn\u2019t help but feel fear, while at the same time, he hated Ji Ning even more. \u201cI definitely have to personally tear his skin off and rend his tendons!\u201d\u201cRight! Tear his skin, rip his tendons!\u201d The black-clothed man ground his teeth as well.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013The Golden Crow [Sun] was beginning to raise its head over the eastern skies. It was daybreak. Ironwood Zhan and the Bi\u2019an Tiger under his command were still slowly pursuing. They had pursued for so long, both of them had bellies full of anger. This child of the Ji clan really was too cautious. After leaving Eastmount Marsh, he had actually fled for at least another thousand kilometers.A Ice Wasp that flew for a thousand kilometers would be very tired as well. Fortunately, this Ice Wasp was a mutant.\u201cMaster.\u201d The black-clothed man\u2019s eyes lit up, and he hurriedly pointed to the distant.\u201cHuh?\u201d The also-tired Zhan turned to look in that direction. Instantly, he could make out an indistinct human figure at the distant side of a pool. This caused his mind to instantly wake up.Ironwood Zhan\u2019s eyes lit up. He licked the corner of his lips, then said mentally, \u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201dBetween master and spirit beast, at a close distance, there was the ability to maintain psychic communications. As for the exact distance\u2026it depended on how powerful their souls were. Generally speaking, a Xiantian lifeform and his spirit beast had to maintain a distance of ten meters if they wanted to be able to converse mentally.The two carefully crept forward, trying not to make any noise.But in truth, even if they made some noise, Zhan wasn\u2019t afraid. He was, after all, a late stage Xiantian expert. When running at full speed, he was a bit faster than even Ji Ning, and in addition, he carried on him a \u2018Divine Movement Seal\u2019 as well as a number of other ordinary Dao seals. How could he possibly allow Ning to escape?\u201cWhat an idiot. No matter how careful I am, I still am making some noise, but he didn\u2019t notice at all. He should be a Fiendgod Body Refiner. Logically speaking, he should have excellent senses. Hmph, hmph, he really has no experience at all. He\u2019s probably fallen asleep.\u201d Zhan laughed coldly. \u201cAll the better. It will make my life easier. Otherwise, I\u2019d have to waste a Divine Movement Seal.Ironwood Zhan and the black-clothed man continued moving forward.Slowly\u2026They could make the person out clearly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat?\u201d They were both stunned.This was because the Sun had already risen by now. Under the light of the Sun, those enormous fiery lotus petals and the watery lotus petals appeared semi-translucent. After all, these lotus petals were not real lotus petals. They were formed by the energy of the world. Under the light of the sun, they instantly appeared semi-translucent.The two layers of enormous lotus petals were still slowly swiveling in opposite directions, but contained within them a very strange rhythm. In the center of these two enormous layers of rotating lotus petals, Ning was seated there in the lotus position.\u201cWhat\u2026what is this?\u201d Zhan, although highly experienced, had never seen a sight like this. \u201cCan it be that this is created from internal ki?\u201d\u201cStill, even if he has broken through to the Xiantian lifeform stage, he is still only an early stage Xiantian. I imagine he doesn\u2019t have any magic treasures on him.\u201d A fierce look appeared on Zhan\u2019s face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But the more he looked at them, the more nervous he became. He was, after all, a late stage Xiantian expert. Although he hadn\u2019t reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level, he could already dimly sense how extraordinary those two layers of petals were.\u201cMaster.\u201d The Bi\u2019an Tiger looked at Zhan as well. \u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be impatient. He is in front of us and won\u2019t be able to escape. Let\u2019s give him a test, first!\u201d Zhan instructed mentally. With a wave of his hand, he released his Xiantian force, which directly dragged a rock into his hand. And then, with a powerful throw, he infused this rock with his Xiantian energy, transforming it into a ray of light which shot straight towards Ji Ning, still seated in the lotus-position.Although he just threw a rock, a Ninefang Warrior would definitely be killed.\u201cHua!\u201dWhen the stone reached the area of ten meters of Ning and intersected with those two layers of lotus petals, it instantly became frozen! That invisible killing energy, with a hiss, transformed the rock into dust.The Bi\u2019An Tiger and Ironwood Zhan both felt their hearts tighten. They exchanged glances. Clearly, they were somewhat puzzled by those two mysterious lotus layers.\u201cI refuse to believe it.\u201d Zhan sneered coldly, and the Blackwood Vinewhip appeared in his hands out of nowhere.\u201cHu!\u201dIronwood Zhan lashed out with his long whip. The Blackwood Vinewhip elongated, coiling around a thick nearby tree. With a massive pull! Honglong\u2026the entire tree was ripped out by the roots, carrying with it a large amount of dirt, swinging about along with Zhan\u2019s whip.Boom\u2026this tens of thousands of pounds heavy tree smashed directly towards Ning, seated in the lotus position. When the massive tree trunk slammed against those two layers of translucent, enormous lotus leaves, it instantly shattered apart. However, the terrifying power of the collision contained within the massive tree caused the two layers of lotus leaves to tremble.Ning, who had been meditating in the lotus position, shook slightly. His eyes opened up.As his eyes opened, he saw that the two enormous lotus leaves surrounding his body were dissipating as an enormous tree trunk smashed down upon him. In the distance, Ironwood Zhan and that black-clothed man were sneering coldly at him.\u201cYou ruined my good fortune!\u201d Watching the two layers of enormous lotus petals dissipate, Ning instantly realized what he had gained this night, and also realized how priceless these insights had been. If nobody had disturbed him, he probably would have been able to gain insights for even longer. But unexpectedly, Zhan had ruined it for him. It must be understood that these moments of enlightenment were something which could only be hoped for and not asked for. It might be decades, if not centuries, until the next time something like this would occur.\u201cDamn you!\u201dNing swept out with a palm, and with a booming sound, smashed that massive tree trunk into two halves. One half landed into the middle of the pond, crushing many of the lotus flowers. The other half fell down against several other nearby trees, sending dust everywhere.\u201cLittle child of the Ji clan!\u201d Ironwood Zhan laughed ferociously. \u201cYou fled a thousand kilometers into the forest, but I still caught you in the end! Today is the day you die!\u201dNing glanced at him coldly, and then immediately summoned forth the Lunar energy and the Solar energy in his body. Over the course of the previous night\u2019s meditation, he had gained just a hint of insight into the true nature of the Dao, but that hint of insight was enough to allow him to understand, without question, what the method was for breaking through to the next level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. Nothing in the world was truly opposite of anything else! It was much like how night and day were seemingly opposites, but in reality, were just two different aspects of the sky.It was much like the two layers of fire and water lotus petals that had surrounded him. Not only did they not cancel each other out, they had even increased each other\u2019s power. Why?A lotus flower had a stalk, which was what allowed the lotus petals to swivel!The \u2018stalk\u2019 of the two layers of fire and water lotus petals was Ning himself!Solar energy, Lunar energy\u2026how to fuse them?By finding that \u2018stalk\u2019 which connected the Solar energy and the Lunar energy!\u201cCome!\u201dNing\u2019s eyes were filled with absolutely certainty.His body had already completely brought forth all of his Solar and Lunar energy, which instantly filled every part of his body. Be it his hair or his skin or his organs or his very cells\u2026it filled every part of him! Every single thread of Lunar energy and Solar energy began to swirl around each other, but their natures caused them to be unwilling to fuse.\u201cHuahuahua\u2026\u201d All of the Lunar energy and Solar energy were swiveling, like the lotus flowers that had been blown upon by the wind.They were also like the two \u2018fish\u2019 of the yin-yang Taiji diagram, forever chasing each other.The Sun. The Moon.They constantly chased after each other\u2026and as they did, they contained that hint of the Dao which Ning had understood.Slowly, in the center of the circling Solar energy and Lunar energy, a new force arose!Instantly\u2026In that deep, boundless void, separated from this place by incomprehensibly many worlds, there lay the two Supreme Stars; the Solar Star [Sun] and the Lunar Star [Moon]. Each of them emitted a hint of their power; the Solar Truefire and the Lunar Truewater appeared on each side around Ning, and also activated the power of fire and water of the surrounding world.\u201cBang!\u201d \u201cBang!\u201dThe surrounding world instantly became filled with a sea of flame as well as an abyss of water.Though this took time to describe, in truth, as soon as Ning had shattered that tree, he had immediately activated the energy in his body and began to break through. Ironwood Zhan and his Bi\u2019an Tiger saw with their own eyes the boundless flames and water appear out of nowhere, causing even them to feel fear. Wherever the water passed through, everything was frozen into ice sculptures, while wherever the fire passed through, everything was consumed by the flames.At the same time, within the surging water, the faint outline of the Jade Rabbit could be seen.Deep within the boundless flames, there was also the shadow of a three-legged Golden Crow.Between the Jade Rabbit and the Golden Crow, there was Ning!\u201cThis\u2026this\u2026\u201d Zhan was so shocked, his face changed dramatically. \u201cCan this be the legendary\u2026the legendary [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]?\u201dThe Golden Crow and the Jade Rabbit had both appeared!Without question, this was the legendary [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], the number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique. In the entire Swallow Mountain area, in at least the past thousand years, there hadn\u2019t been a single person who was known to have relied on this technique to become a Xiantian lifeform. Although Zhan had read this technique and knew what the breakthrough looked like, this was his first time personally witnessing the amazing spectacle of a breakthrough.\u201cHrmph.\u201d Ironwood Zhan\u2019s hands summoned a formation flag out of nowhere. He immediately flew backwards, then began running around Ning, surrounded by boundless water and fire, in a circular pattern, while constantly throwing out one flag after another, all of which stabbed deep into the mud.In but a few seconds, eight formation flags had all been planted, covering an area of a square kilometer.Ironwood Zhan now simply stood from afar and watched.\u201cMaster, kill him.\u201d The Bi\u2019an Tiger said hurriedly. \u201cRight now, he is breaking through. This is his weakest moment.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Zhan hurriedly shouted. \u201cHe trains in the number one Fiendgod Body Refining, and is currently surrounded by the power of the Supreme Stars, the Solar Star and the Lunar Star! When breaking through to the Xiantian lifeform level, these two Supreme Stars will send down a hint of their Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater, breaking through countless barriers to allow him to evolve and be reborn into the body of a true Xiantian-level Fiendgod.\u201d\u201cThen it becomes all the more important for us to stop him.\u201d The Bi\u2019an Tiger said frantically.\u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d Ironwood Zhan\u2019s face was ashen as he stared at the distant Ning, wrapped by the endless flames and water. \u201cRight now, he is surrounded by boundless icy water and cocooned in flames. At the heart of the boundless icy water is a hint of the Lunar Truewater! At the heart of the endless flames is a hint of the Solar Truefire! Even if a Zifu Disciple were to touch it, he would instantly be frozen and shatter or be burnt to ashes, much less you and me! Not even his soul would be left. He wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to go to the Netherworld Kingdom to be reborn!\u201d\u201cAs fearsome as that?\u201d The Bi\u2019an Tiger was shocked.\u201cOf course it is!\u201d Ironwood Zhan\u2019s face was solemn. \u201cThis is power which comes from the two Supreme Stars! Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater. Who dares to touch them?\u201d\u201cThen, then are we just going to watch?\u201d The Bi\u2019an Tiger said frantically. \u201cJust watch as this child of the Ji clan becomes even more powerful?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d Zhan growled. \u201cRight now, the two Supreme Stars have bequeathed their power to him, and he is beginning to transcend his mortal coil and be reborn into a true Xiantian Fiendgod. After he breaks through, that hint of Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater will disappear. After all, the power of the Solar Truefire and the Lunar Truewater doesn\u2019t belong to this little child of the Ji clan himself.Ironwood Zhan sneered coldly, \u201cI\u2019ve already set down the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation. After this little child of the Ji clan breaks through, he\u2019ll no longer have the protective power of the Supreme Stars. I will immediately activate the formation! No matter what, he\u2019ll only be an early Xiantian lifeform without a single magic treasure. I, on the other hand, am a late Xiantian lifeform with the assistance of the formation!\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d The Bi\u2019an Tiger nodded as well.\u201cBut this child of the Ji clan really is amazing!\u201d Ironwood Zhan couldn\u2019t help but sigh in praise. \u201c[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. This is the legendary, most powerful Fiendgod Body Refining technique. Virtually all tribes of a certain size are in possession of it! But in a thousand years, in the entire Swallow Mountain area, there hasn\u2019t been a single person who has reached Xiantian through it. If he is permitted to grow, he will definitely become the number one person of the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan, and perhaps even the entire Swallow Mountain! But no matter how powerful he will be, right now, he will only have reached the Xiantian level. Haha\u2026I feel wonderful when I think about how I\u2019m about to kill such a monstrous genius.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-What did Xiantian mean?It meant to be born from the heavens and from nature. Only that was a true Xiantian lifeform.Generally speaking, most Ki Refiners only had the inner ki energy in their bodies transform into Xiantian Afterwards, the energy would wash through their entire body, allowing them to reach a quick and agile state! But actually, this was the weakest type of Xiantian body. A casual sword thrust through the heart would cause them to die.But for Fiendgod Body Refiners\u2026their entire body would be reborn into the body like a Fiendgod\u2019s. Fiendgods could have their bodies chopped into eighteen parts, but as long as their head wasn\u2019t destroyed, they would not die! Generally speaking, most Fiendgod Body Refining techniques were low-grade, to the point of even relying on tattooing the divine patterns onto their bodies.But the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] relied on the power of the two Supreme Stars to naturally generate those two major divine tattoos.When breaking through to the Xiantian level, the Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater of the two Supreme Stars would descend\u2026fire and water would coincide, giving birth to a Fiendgod\u2019s body! This sort of Fiendgod body wasn\u2019t one bit inferior to those trueborn Fiendgods of the ancient Fiendgod Era. Thus, this was reputed to be the number one technique in the world!\u201cPipa!\u201d Ning could sense every single cell in his body explode. And then, the divine power of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] caused the Solar Truefire and the Lunar Truewater to begin to reforge every single cell anew. The hint of Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater which the two Supreme Stars had sent down, in turn, were being utterly consumed in the process of forging this new Xiantian Fiendgod.The mortal vessel fell away!The Fiendgod body formed!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHua\u2026The Solar Truefire and the Lunar Truewater were consumed, and the countless amounts of fire and water which surrounded them dispersed as well, revealing the fur-clad Ji Ning. Although he had leapt into the Xiantian level, the furs hadn\u2019t been damaged by the fire and water at all. Only, Ning\u2019s skin was now emitting an enchanting radiance, as though he were a gem formed by the heavens.Ning opened his eyes and stared at the distant Ironwood Zhan and the Bi\u2019an Tiger. He said only two words. \u201cNow, die!\u201dThe Divine Solar Tattoo and Divine Lunar Tattoo on his back instantly activated.Boom! Boom!An enormous flaming dragon and an enormous water dragon appeared out of nowhere, formed from the fire and water summoned by the Divine Solar Tattoo and Divine Lunar Tattoo. Containing terrifying destructive power, it charged straight towards the distant Ironwood Zhan and Bi\u2019an Tiger! This was the proof of the Xiantian level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]; the ability to control fire and water!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhan hurriedly activated his Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation, while shouting loudly, \u201cBe careful, he can control fire and water. The ability of Xiantian Fiendgods of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] to control water and fire is extraordinary. Once water and fire come out simultaneously, even most ordinary Xiantian lifeforms can be killed!\u201dThe reason he shouted so loudly was because as soon as the Bi\u2019an Tiger had seen the fire and water, it had already transformed into its real body and begun to retreat. Once the distance between the two increased, they were no longer capable of spiritual communication. But how could the speed of the Bi\u2019an Tiger compare to that of the water and fire?\u201cBoom\u2026\u201d An enormous water dragon instantly coiled around the Bi\u2019an Tiger, causing a layer of frost to appear on it. At the same time, the other fire dragon also wrapped itself around the Bi\u2019an Tiger. The water dragon and fire dragon simultaneously coiled around it, the water dragon filled with boundless cold, while the fire dragon was filled with endless heat\u2026Hot and cold.Pa! Pa! Pa!The Bi\u2019an Tiger\u2019s fur began to crack, and his red flesh and muscles began to be revealed, then quickly char.\u201cGrooooooooowl.\u201d The Bi\u2019an Tiger roared.\u201cStill not dead!\u201d Ji Ning\u2019s gaze grew colder.The water dragon that had been coiling around the Bi\u2019an Tiger suddenly loosened, then quickly began to transform, changing into an enormous flowing lotus petal. At the same time, the fire dragon also quickly transformed into a blazing lotus petal.The water lotus petal was below.The fire lotus petal was above.The Bi\u2019an Tiger was in the middle. Despite how it tried to struggle and flee, it was useless. The two lotus petals followed it wherever it went.\u201cWaterflame Lotus, smelt!\u201d With a thought from Ning, instantly the two lotus petals began to slowly revolve. It was like two terrifying millstones slowly crushing down while revolving. Earlier, Ning had just been unconsciously activated the energy of the world to form those two protective lotus petals through his slight understanding of the Dao, and yet the power had already been so tremendous. But now, Ning was himself a Xiantian lifeform, capable of controlling both fire and water. Adding onto that basic power the hint of the Dao he had understood\u2026the power became hundreds of times greater than before.The petals of the Waterflame Lotus revolved. The Bi\u2019an Tiger caught between them only felt a surge of heat and cold, and it felt far more miserable than before! Its entire body seemed to have lost all feeling! At the same time, as the water and fire intersected, a wind arose out of nowhere, and that wind filled with a powerful killing force descended directly upon the Bi\u2019an Tiger.\u201cKa\u2026\u201d The Bi\u2019an Tiger\u2019s charred body was like a porcelain doll. It shattered into many little pieces, its eyes filled with incomprehension as they grew dim.The Bi\u2019an Tiger had died!\u201cIt is actually this powerful.\u201d Ning\u2019s heart was filled with surprise and delight as well. \u201cWith the water and fire I control as the base, and then formed into the protective Waterflame Lotus which I developed, I was able to execute a middle Xiantian level Diremonster, without even giving it a chance to fight back.\u201dAlthough the above took time to describe, a battle between experts was incredibly fast.From the moment when Ning created the Waterflame Lotus to the moment when the Bi\u2019an Tiger died, only a heartbeat\u2019s worth of time had occurred.\u201cBoom\u2026\u201d The Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation which had surrounded this square kilometer fully released its power as well, and lines of black energy and white energy criss-crossed towards Ning.Ironwood Zhan was shocked by how easily his Bi\u2019an Tiger had been executed as well. And then, with a savage expression, he howled, \u201cWithin my Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation, even if you are a monstrous talent which Swallow Mountain sees once in a millennium, you will still surely die! Die!\u201dLines of viper-like black and white energy instantly pounced towards Ning.\u201cHrmph.\u201dWith but a thought, instantly fire and water appeared out of nowhere next to his body. The fire and water transformed into lotus petals, with two layers of enormous petals of the Waterflame Lotus hovering about him, waiting for those black and white energy streams to attack. When they did\u2026with a thought from Ning, the Waterflame Lotus suddenly fused!Like a budding flower, those upward-pointing lotus petals formed into a massive lotus flower bud that was over ten meters high, instantly ensconcing Ning within them.\u201cPengpengpeng\u2026\u201d The black and white energy waves came crashing down.The Waterflame Lotus, although having fused into a flower bud, was still slowly swiveling. The inner layer was made of fire lotus petals, while the outer layer was made from water lotus petals. They continued to slowly swivel in opposite directions. No matter how the black and white energy struck against it time and time again, sometimes just barely breaking through the outer layer of the water lotus petals, the water lotus petals would once more reform into their normal appearance.After all, fire and water could always part and reform; they weren\u2019t solid substances to begin with. Even if they were occasionally broken through, with but a thought, Ning could reform them!\u201cWhat?\u201d Ironwood Zhan was shocked. \u201cHow is this possible? My Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation\u2026this is an extremely powerful formation. Given my power when using it, even if I were to meet with an opponent who was a peak Xiantian lifeform, I wouldn\u2019t be afraid. How could it be that it can\u2019t even break through the protective lotus of this child of the Ji clan? What is that protective lotus? How is it that I\u2019ve never even heard of it?\u201dBut how could Ironwood Zhan know that Ning had previously already reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level. The greatest benefit of his previous night\u2019s worth of enlightenment was\u2026this protective lotus, which already had a hint of the true meaning of the Dao within it.A Xiantian lifeform created by the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was incomparably powerful to begin with, and the fire and water it controlled was far stronger than that of the fire and water which most Diremonsters could create. When infusing that with the hint of the true Dao through the Waterflame Lotus, blocking a mere formation naturally was nothing at all.\u201cIronwood Zhan, you\u2019ve chased for such a long time. Let me repay you now, and send you on the next leg of your journey!\u201dWithin the lotus bud, Ning stared through the flowing water lotus petals and the blazing fire lotus petals, seeing the distant, unclear figure. In addition, his mind had reached the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level\u2026naturally, he could sense the auras of all nearby creatures, and could clearly sense the location of Zhan.\u201cDie.\u201dWith but a thought from Ning.In the area where Ironwood Zhan was standing, yet another fiery lotus petal and watery lotus petal appeared. One above him, one below him, crushing down upon Zhan like millstones.\u201cFormation, aid me!\u201d Ironwood Zhan, seeing the situation, was terrified. This was how his servant, the Bi\u2019an Tiger, had died just now. He hurriedly controlled the black and white energy streams, wildly wrapping them around himself to block the grinding, crushing force of this Waterflame Lotus. By doing so, he was just barely able to block it. Although occasionally, some fire and water would break through, his Xiantian ki was able to block it.\u201cHow can he simultaneously create two lotus flowers?\u201d Zhan was filled with shock and dread. \u201cSuch a powerful attack should take up almost all of his concentration.\u201dBut how could he know\u2026When he was four years old, Ning\u2019s soul was already almost on par with a Zifu Disciple. Right now, his soul was already far above that of a Zifu Disciple. Dividing his mind to execute two separate Waterflame Lotus techniques was simplicity itself.\u201cYou actually haven\u2019t died!\u201d Protected within the lotus bud, Ning quickly charged towards Ironwood Zhan.\u201cRetreat.\u201d Ironwood was so frightened that his face changed. He ground his teeth.Flee!This decision was made quite decisively. He was, after all, born into the Ironwood clan. He knew very well that once someone trained to the Xiantian lifeform level in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], the power of the practitioner would be hundreds of times that of ordinary Fiendgod Body Refiners. Although right now, Ning was only an early Xiantian lifeform, he was capable of matching other late-stage Xiantian Fiendgod Body Refiners!He, Ironwood Zhan, was nothing more than a late-stage Xiantian Ki Refiner. Engage in close combat with a Fiendgod Body Refiner of this level? That was just suicide!Before this, he had been relying on the fact that Ning didn\u2019t have any magic treasures, but if even the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation couldn\u2019t do anything to Ning, if he were to continue to fight with Ning, would that be suicide?\u201cAn early Xiantian whose battle power is equivalent to a peak Xiantian. What a monster. The Ji clan actually produced such a monster. I definitely have to inform the Ancestor and have him be exterminated as soon as possible. Otherwise, in the future, he will be a calamity to the Ironwood clan!\u201d Ironwood Zhan was utterly terrified, especially by those Waterflame Lotuses. They were simply too powerful.Formations had to be prepared in advance, but Ning\u2019s Fire Water Lotus could be created with but a thought, and it was even more powerful than his formation. This was too\u2026\u201cHe must be eliminated.\u201d Ironwood Zhan\u2019s only thought was to go back and report this to his clan\u2019s Ancestor.\u201dBoth the Ironwood clan and the Ji clan\u2026as two of the six hegemons of the Swallow Mountain area, had Zifu Disciples standing guard over them. That was why they had the ability to be acknowledged by the Grand Xia Dynasty to become ministers of the Grand Xia Dynasty.\u201cDivine Movement Seal!\u201d With a flip of Zhan\u2019s hand, a black, leaf-like paper seal suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The paper seal was covered with what looked like veins of blood, and was covered with an ancient, strange character which faintly emanated a mysterious, rippling aura. Ironwood Zhan sent a surge of his Xiantian ki into this seal.Hua!The seal instantly transformed into a shadowy word which fused into Ironwood Zhan\u2019s body.\u201cFlee!\u201d Ironwood Zhan immediately transformed into a ray of light, quickly fleeing afar, not even bothering to collect his Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation flags.This was because Ironwood Zhan knew very well that right now, he was still relying on the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation to protect him against that Waterflame Lotus. In addition, collecting those eight formation flags would also take up time. It would give that terrifying youth of the Ji clan a chance to catch up to him, at which point, he wouldn\u2019t just lose the eight formation flags. He would lose his life.\u201cHe ran?\u201d Ji Ning hurriedly chased afterwards. His Xiantian Fiendgod body, matched with his \u2018one with the world\u2019 footwork, caused his speed to become even more rapid. He transformed into a ray of light as well, chasing after Zhan.\u201cJust slightly slower than me?\u201d Ironwood Zhan was greatly shocked. \u201cBefore, when he hadn\u2019t yet broken through to the Xiantian level yet, I was faster than him. But now, even after using a precious Divine Movement Seal, we\u2019re roughly on par.\u201d Ironwood Zhan couldn\u2019t help but feel his heart ache with the cost, but grinding his teeth, he took out yet another Dao seal, covered with that same ancient network of veins atop it. He filled his Xiantian ki into that Dao seal.Yet another illusory word appeared, then entered his body.Light Body Seal!\u201cSwoosh!\u201d Ironwood Zhan transformed into a blue blaze as he retreated even faster.\u201cWon\u2019t be able to catch him.\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes had a hint of unwillingness to accept this outcome in them. As an Fiendgod Body Refiner expert, his speed was already incredible. But Ironwood Zhan had utilized two Dao seals in succession; a Light Body Seal, and a Divine Movement Seal\u2026although these seals weren\u2019t nearly as valuable as the \u2018Traceless Talisman\u2019, they were still able to allow Ironwood Zhan\u2019s speed to explosively increase.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing didn\u2019t have any Dao seals right now. In addition, even if he had them, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use them, because Dao seals and magic treasures all required one to have Xiantian ki in order to use them.Swoosh! Swoosh!Ironwood Zhan fled out of the area of the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation, pulling ahead of Ning, causing Ning to be unable to utilize his Waterflame Lotus against him. This was because the Waterflame Lotus was formed through his ability to control fire and water, but there was a limit to how far a Xiantian Fiendgod could maintain the control. At too great a distance, control would no longer be possible.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Ironwood Zhan let out a sigh of relief. Without the threat from the Waterflame Lotus, and having pulled away from Ning, he finally relaxed. But then, he was filled with hate. Hatred for this Ji Ning. After all, he had lost his Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation.\u201cBoy of the Ji clan, feel happy for now. I will definitely report this to the Ancestor, and also to Snowdragon Mountain! The Ji clan is the mortal foe of both my Ironwood clan as well Snowdragon Mountain. A monster like you is someone which both Snowdragon Mountain and my Ironwood clan will eradicate as soon as possible.\u201d Ironwood Zhan\u2019s heart was filled with hatred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Right at that moment, the many large, tall trees in front of him suddenly began to crash down in front of him, completely blocking the road ahead of Zhan. Some of those trees even flew through the air towards him at high speed.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Ironwood Zhan\u2019s face lost all color.With a mighty wave of his black vine whip, he transformed it into a series of rays of light, slicing towards several trees that were flying towards him. As though they had been chopped apart, the large tree trunks were split in half, but Zhan\u2019s speed had been lessened as well.\u201cHuahua\u2026\u201dFrom every direction, many branches, tree trunks, and even boulders and chunks of earth all began to fly over, wildly throwing themselves at Ironwood Zhan.\u201cWhat, what is going on?\u201d Zhan was completely stunned.\u201cThese boulders, branches, trees, why are they all flying towards me?\u201d Zhan had never heard of something like this. Even a Zifu Disciple would only be able to fly on his own magic treasures by standing on them, then ordering the magic treasures to fly! Not even Zifu Disciples were capable of making ordinary items fly like this.Countless boulders and tree trunks filled the sky, smashing towards Zhan and forcing his speed to lessen.\u201cIronwood Zhan, you won\u2019t be able to flee!\u201d From behind, another ray of light shot towards him. It was Ji Ning, and Ji Ning was shouting at him.\u201cHow did you accomplish this?\u201d Zhan shouted while slicing through the trees, hoping to continue to be able to flee, but under the attack of the surrounding earth, boulders, and tree trunks, he wasn\u2019t able to run at high speed at all.Ji Ning only smirked.Right.He had accomplished this. Just then, after Zhan had used the \u2018Divine Movement Seal\u2019 and the \u2018Light Body Seal\u2019, he had nearly fled. Naturally, Ji Ning had grown desperate! In that frantic moment, Ning had discovered that his powerful thought waves were causing even the water of the pool and the earth to shake.He could clearly sense how his consciousness seemed to have become an invisible hand, capable of grasping the nearby trees and mud, as well as all other things.\u201cDivine will!\u201d Ning instantly was filled with a surge of wild joy.When a soul grew excessively powerful, some strange things would occur.Generally speaking, Zifu Disciples were capable of splitting their minds!Generally speaking, Wanxiang Adepts were capable of \u2018divine will\u2019!Primal Daoists were capable of opening the \u2018eye of heaven\u2019 and utilize their \u2018divine sense\u2019!visualization techniques were extremely rare and mysterious. In the Ji clan, nobody had even heard of such a thing as a visualization technique! If one wanted to strengthen one\u2019s soul? Generally, the only method was to train their will, meditate on the Dao, and strengthen first the body, then the soul. Ji Ning\u2019s training in accordance with the [Nuwa Painting] had already nearly reached a limit. That night of enlightenment towards the Dao had been extremely beneficial to his soul.After gaining a greater understanding of the Dao, fire and water had then descended from the heavens, giving him a Fiendgod\u2019s body. As the body grew stronger, the soul would strengthen once again.Unconsciously, Ning\u2019s soul had already reached the level of being capable of \u2018divine will\u2019! Only, he didn\u2019t know that until when Ironwood Zhan had fled. Desperate, Ning unconsciously had caused his willpower to affect the water and the earth, which made him realize what he had achieved.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to flee.\u201d Ning used his divine will to control the nearby things, causing the nearby trees, mud, and stones to all surround Zhan.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cCan it be that this wasn\u2019t done by this child of the Ji clan? Is there a terrifyingly powerful practitioner of the way of Immortal who, seeing the talent of this child, has decided to help him?\u201d Ironwood Zhan was unable to flee, try as he might. He felt both frantic and terrified\u201cWaterflame Lotus!\u201d Ning\u2019s gaze focused on him.The enormous fire lotus petal appeared above Ironwood Zhan, while an enormous water lotus petal appeared beneath Ironwood Zhan. At the same time, the two slowly began to swivel.\u201cI don\u2019t know which elder is present?\u201d Ironwood Zhan called out loudly, while revealing a Dao-seal in his hand. This Dao-seal transformed into an illusory diamond, then disappeared into his body, and his body began to glow with a faint golden light. \u201cI am a disciple of the Ironwood clan, and I am on very good terms with Snowdragon Mountain as well.\u201d\u201cStop struggling.\u201d The formerly distant Ning had already arrived.\u201cChild of the Ji clan.\u201d The golden light on Ironwood Zhan\u2019s body was trembling and swaying. He repeatedly, viciously twirled out the Blackwood Vinewhip in his hand, which quickly elongated as it flew towards Ning.Ning wielded a sword in each hand. He was as fast as lightning.\u201cChi!\u201d The Darknorth sword in his left hand utilized the \u2018Watertight\u2019 technique. As soon as the Blackwood Vinewhip touched the Darknorth sword, it naturally wrapped around it, but Ning voluntarily began spinning his left sword\u2026the Blackwood Vinewhip wrapped around it many times, and in the end, Ning\u2019s left hand actually was able to snatch the Ironwood Vinewhip.Swish!Ning\u2019s right hand reached an even faster level.\u201cBreak!\u201d Zhan roared fiercely while pulling at the Blackwood Vinewhip, but he wasn\u2019t able to budget it at all. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t die here. I can\u2019t die to this little child of the Ji clan!\u201d Sensing death draw nearer, Ironwood Zhan became even crazier. He even released the Ironwood Vinewhip in his hand.Turning his head, he continued to flee!\u201cBang!\u201d Slowly being ground down by the Waterflame Lotus, the golden light on his body finally cracked and dispersed.\u201cAaaah.\u201d Ironwood Zhan\u2019s clothes were instantly ground into dust by the Waterflame Lotus, revealing his body, which was beginning to turn black. He emitted an agonized scream.\u201cSwish!\u201dA raindrop pierced straight through Zhan\u2019s forehead.And then, the Waterflame Lotus dissipated. Ning withdrew his sword, looking quietly at the charred Ironwood Zhan.Ironwood Zhan\u2019s eyes were bulging. Even his eyebrows were gone, while in his forehead, there was a bloody hole. His eyes were filled with disbelief and rage. He hadn\u2019t imagined that he would die at the hands of this youth. In his heart, he even more hated that \u2018elder\u2019 who had blocked his flight. If it hadn\u2019t been for that elder practitioner, he would have been able to flee.\u201cImmortal practitioner?\u201d Ning said to himself softly, his heart filled with a silent excitement.Finally!He had finally become a Xiantian lifeform!Even the world-famous, powerful expert, Ironwood Zhan, had died in the face of his might.\u201cEven though I was reincarnated into the mortal world!\u201d Ning growled in his heart. \u201cRelying on my own efforts, I was still able to become a Xiantian lifeform! And that was just the beginning! The beginning of myself, Ji Ning!\u201dThe experiences of his past life. Everything he had seen in this one.They had all allowed Ning to have a heart that was filled with an incomparable urge to grow stronger. An urge to control his own destiny. To not be controlled by others, to not be controlled by fate!\u201cThis is just the start!\u201d Ning took a few steps forward, walking to Zhan\u2019s corpse. With but a thought, a gust of flame instantly turned Zhan\u2019s corpse into nothing but ash, leaving behind only an armguard and that Blackwood Vinewhip.\u201cOh?\u201d The armguard and the whip both flew into Ning\u2019s hands. Ning inspected them carefully. \u201cSo this armguard is actually a storage-type magic treasure! The Blackwood Vinewhip is also a magic treasure.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d Ning returned.He returned to the pool, collecting those eight Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation flags. The flags were all very dark and grey, and yet they emitted pulses.\u201cMagic treasures, Dao-seals. All of them are only usable when one is at least at the Xiantian level as a Ki Refiner.\u201d Ning collected all these things into his kalestone. \u201cI first have to reach the Xiantian level as a Ki Refiner as well.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Ning cleaned up the surrounding area. As for the corpses of the Bi\u2019an Tiger and Ironwood Zhan, he transformed them all into ash. Ning then once again continued his meditations by the pool side, because he had the sense\u2026that training his ki to the Xiantian level would be very easy!The night after that battle!Ning still sat in the lotus position by the side of the pool, and for the moment, the dantian in his body began to change and rumble! The original powerful threads of ki began to rotate and then condense into liquid drops. One drop of ki began to solidify, and Ning\u2019s body also began to attract some mist which wrapped around him.\u201cSo I\u2019m about to break through.\u201d Ning smiled.When he had been in the womb, his meridians had been damaged. If he had been relying on Ki Refining to reach the Xiantian level, it would have been very hard. But upon reaching the Xiantian level through the [Scarlet Diagram of the Ning Shining Heavens], Ning\u2019s entire body had been transformed into a true Fiendgod\u2019s body by the Lunar Truewater and Solar Truefire of the Solar Star [Sun] and the Lunar Star [Moon]. Because his entire body had been transformed, his mortal body had been transformed into a Fiendgod\u2019s body, and his meridians had been remade anew as well!Currently, Ning\u2019s meridian network had become perfected and unblemished. The meridian channels were far wider than that of most Xiantian Ki Refiners! In addition, Ning had a very high level of enlightenment, so naturally, he was now about to break through.\u201cThe storage-type magic treasure.\u201d Ning held the armguard while activating the ki in his body. He quickly managed to bind it to him.\u201cStorage-type magic treasures and natural kalestones really are different.\u201d Ning instantly felt overjoyed. This armguard held an enormous storage space. Within an area of chaos, there was a storage area of tens of meters across. There were many items inside as well, such as clothes, food, gold, and other things.The most valuable items were those eight Dao-seals! They had been slowly accumulated by Ironwood Zhan over many years. Today, he had used three of them in one breath, but he had still died in the end.\u201cA pity there are no other magic treasures.\u201d Ning shook his head. Still, this was as he had expected. A Xiantian lifeform was already quite lucky to have just two or three magic treasures.\u201cThis bow is pretty good.\u201dWith a flip of his hand, Ning retrieved a simple, unadorned greatbow from within the storage-type magic treasure. \u201cThis should be the bow which Ironwood Zhan normally uses. After reaching the Xiantian level, I am in need of a good bow.\u201dHua!As he applied force to it, the monstrous, Fiendgod-like power he possessed easily drew the bow.\u201cGood boy.\u201d Ning praised, then he took a good look at it. The bow had two things drawn on it that looked like characters; \u2018Jia Yong\u2019. This name made Ning puzzled. \u201cIt should be the name of the bowyer who made this bow, I suppose.\u201d\u201cWhen I return to the West Prefecture City, I\u2019ll exchange this Blackwood Vinewhip for another magic treasure.\u201d Ji Ning collected everything, extremely happy. \u201cWithout experiencing the bone-freezing cold, how could one experience the fragrant scent of the flowers assailing the nose? Four years of training the sword. After training to now, I\u2019ve broken through and am about to enter a brand new world. I suppose this counts as finally smelling the fragrant scent of the plum blossoms assailing the nose.\u201dThis breakthrough resulted in him reaching the Xiantian level in both ki and as a Fiendgod.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven his soul had reached the \u2018divine will\u2019 level.And the hint of understanding regarding the true Dao which he had gained by the side of the pool had allowed him to develop an ultimate attack, the \u2018Waterflame Lotus\u2019.\u201cOh, right, and there\u2019s that!\u201d Ning took a breath, letting himself calm down. As he did, with great solemnity, he took out the book his mother had given him, the most precious secret manual his mother possessed, which she had forbidden him to teach to any other members of the Ji clan. She had told him that he was only to use it upon reaching the Xiantian level.Ning carefully looked at the golden cover of the book, and those four characters on the cover: [Wind Wing Evasion Technique]!And then, Ning opened the book and began to read.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6 \u2013 The Return\u201cWindwing Evasion is the root and foundation for our Yuchi clan. It is not to be transmitted to outsiders!\u201dUpon opening the gold-leaf pages, this was the very first line of characters, which caused Ji Ning to be stunned. The Yuchi clan? His mother was Yuchi Snow. Could this mean that his mother belonged to the Yuchi clan? In this wide land, those who were born into poor circumstances and didn\u2019t have a good clan name would just randomly pick names for themselves, such as \u2018Blacktooth\u2019, \u2018Blackstone\u2019, \u2018Ironhead\u2019, etc. Generally speaking, only large-scale clans had proper surnames!\u201cMother has never mentioned the Yuchi clan to me.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cI am Mother\u2019s child, and I can thus be considered to have the blood of the Yuchi clan in my veins. But strictly speaking, I am only half a Yuchi clan member. And yet, Mother still taught this to me. However, from my birth until today, I have never heard of a Yuchi clan.\u201dThe number of books Ning had read could only be described as \u2018many\u2019! But the books had no records of a Yuchi clan, which meant that the Yuchi clan was not a clan from the surrounding area.That made sense\u2026Mother and Father had met in the distant Dark North Seas, and then they had gone adventuring together.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard Mother discuss the Yuchi clan. Perhaps Mother left the clan, or perhaps the Yuchi clan collapsed? Forget it, it doesn\u2019t matter right now.\u201d Ning lowered his head, continuing to read. This book explained in detail the history of the [Windwing Evasion] technique.The ancestor of the Yuchi clan, Yuchi Anton, was born a slave.Once, when hunting on a mountain, he had rescued a heavily injured child. He had worked hard to take care of this child, and the child slowly recovered. Only after half a year did the child reveal his true identity\u2026as it turned out, this person who had appeared to be a child was, in reality, a Celestial Immortal who had trained for countless years and had long since escaped the Three Realms. This time, he had encountered a great disaster, and thus he had used all his abilities in order to flee to this mountain, but by then, he had become powerless. If he had ran into an ordinary little monstrous beast, he probably would have been eaten.This child had named himself Suhuan, and claimed that he had already become an Immortal in the Fiendgod Era.And then, this Immortal named Suhuan had taught Anton training methods. Who would have thought that Anton was actually more talented in Fiendgod Body Refining methods\u2026Suhuan had stayed by Anton\u2019s side for fully a hundred years, carefully teaching him, while at the same time transmitting to him a divine ability, the [Windwing Evasion]. And then, Suhuan had said, \u201cOur karmic destiny has come to its end. I hope you will shape up!\u201dAnd then, he had flown away.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cCelestial Immortal?\u201d Ning was shocked. \u201cDivine ability?\u201dThis\u2026this\u2026.Even in the Netherworld Kingdom, according to what the Lord of Cui Manor had said the celestial soldiers and generals of the Heaven Realm, after acquiring the likes of the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique, would have to experience countless tribulations before becoming a Celestial Immortal! In the Grand Xia Dynasty, perhaps a million years would pass without a single Celestial Immortal being born. They truly were creatures who had transcended the Three Realms, who were no longer bound by the restrictions of the Netherworld Kingdom or of the Heavenly Court. They were Immortals who did as they pleased.\u201cWho would have thought that the ancestor of Mother\u2019s Yuchi clan would have had a history like this.\u201d Ning felt shaken. \u201cThis history is far more incredible than our Ji clan\u2019s.\u201d\u201cIn addition, the [Windwing Evasion] is a divine ability!\u201dNing couldn\u2019t breathe.What was a \u2018divine ability\u2019?Some of the more famous divine abilities, included the \u2018Kuafu Sunchaser\u2019, \u201972 Transformations\u2019, \u2018Three Heads, Six Arms\u2019, \u2018Houyi Shooting the Sun\u2019. These were the natural abilities which the ancient, mighty Fiendgods had developed. Only these abilities could be described as \u2018divine abilities\u2019! Only Fiendgod Body Refiners could train in them, and only upon reaching the Zifu level could they begin their training!Every single \u2018divine ability\u2019 was incomparably precious. Many Fiendgod Body Refiners, upon reaching the Zifu Disciple level, were clearly capable of learning divine abilities, but they didn\u2019t have any chance to do so.\u201cDivine abilities should only be usable at the Zifu stage. But Mother instructed me to begin learning at the Xiantian stage. Why is that?\u201d Ning continued to read the detailed information regarding the training methods for the [Windwing Evasion].Hua!Flipping through the golden pages, another golden page appeared before him, but clearly, this golden page was somewhat different from the previous pages. This golden page still had a hint of stellar light glowing from it, and there was a diagram engraved at the top of it. It was that of a giant Roc in flight.At times, it stretched its wings. At times, it sank down. At times, it flew throughout the Nine Heavens. At times, it sank into the seas. At times, it landed on the ground. At times, it burrowed deep into the earth\u2026Ning couldn\u2019t help but feel affected by this diagram. It was as though he had seen an enormous Roc in flight. In addition, the great Roc in this diagram was covered by countless specks of stellar light, and these specks of stellar light\u2026seemed like the divine power flowing through the critical parts of the great Roc\u2019s body.The spots of light seemed to be focused on a pair of wings.\u201cThe great Roc spreads his wings, and travels a hundred thousand kilometers as it flies!\u201d\u201cThis is what Master Suhuan told to me. Unfortunately, I am far too distant from that level. The descendants of my Yuchi clan must focus on training in this [Windwing Evasion] technique. I hope that one day, one of them will be able to reach the highest \u2018divine ability\u2019 level. The eighty one Roc diagrams of the [Windwing Evasion] has profound secrets hidden within it. It must be meditated upon! The benefits to it are boundless!\u201d\u201cThe [Windwing Evasion] is divided into multiple layers and levels. Once the divine power in one\u2019s body reaches the level of being able to condense into a pair of wings, only then can one be considered to have developed a \u2018divine ability\u2019. However, the [Windwing Evasion] remains a divine technique, and it would be jealously desired by some extremely powerful tribes of the Grand Xia Dynasty. The descendants of my clan absolutely must use wing-type magic treasures alongside this divine ability. Thus, not only can they rely on the power of the magic treasures to fly even faster, they can also prevent others from knowing of the existence of this divine ability\u2026\u201dNing closed the book.Only after a long time was he able to calm down.\u201cMy mother truly does have an extraordinary background.\u201d Ning frowned. \u201cBut clearly, although each page of this book is golden, the paper of those eighty one Roc diagrams are different from that of the other pages. In addition, such miraculous diagrams were most likely left behind by that Immortal, Suhuan, himself.\u201d\u201cImmortal Suhuan, despite teaching the [Windwing Evasion], most likely only left a single copy. In other words, the Yuchi clan should only have a single secret manual!\u201d Ning hypothesized.Although this was his first time viewing the eighty one Roc diagrams, Ning felt extremely certain that these eighty one Roc diagrams did indeed contain boundless secrets. It was the same feeling he had when he was gaining insights into the Dao\u2026the feeling of immeasurably deep secrets. Most likely, only a person who had reached the highest levels of training in this divine ability was able to carve and draw them down.\u201cAncestor Yuchi only had a single copy of this secret manual, but my mother is in possession of it.\u201d Ning pondered. \u201cCan it be that the Yuchi clan was destroyed? Or was there another reason?\u201dAlthough he felt somewhat worried for his mother\u2019s relatives, he had never had any attachments to the Yuchi clan, and so Ning quickly stopped thinking about it.\u201cI need to carefully meditate on this.\u201dThe moon hanging high above him, Ning quietly sat down by the side of the pond, flipping through and looking at the Roc diagrams.The [Windwing Evasion] was divided into many different levels.Only after one\u2019s divine power was able to form wings could one be considered to have developed a divine ability. However, the requirements for divine power were very high; only a Zifu Disciple was capable of it.\u201cMy mother had me begin to read it at the Xiantian level.\u201d Ning laughed. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not able to use divine power to form wings, the eighty one Roc diagrams contain boundless, endless secrets and mysteries. After I gain insight into them, it will still be very beneficial to my body.\u201dNing had already gained a hint of the true meaning of the Dao.The higher one\u2019s level of enlightenment was, the more easily one would be able to tell that the eighty one Roc diagrams contained boundless truths, and even more infinite mysteries. Naturally, he would meditate on them intensively.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Time passed.The Golden Crow fell. The Moon Rabbit rose.One day passed after another. Ning remained within that mountain forest, completely focused on the [Windwing Evasion]. His body flashed through the mountain forests time and time again, and his movements took him farther and farther each time, at faster and faster speeds, with greater ease each time.\u201cI\u2019ve already trained here for over a month.\u201d Ning suddenly came to his senses as he stared at the sun in the sky. \u201cIf I don\u2019t go back, most likely Autumn Leaf and the others will frantically report back to West Prefecture City.\u201d\u201cTime to go back.\u201dNing revealed a smile on his face. Turning to glance at the surrounding area, he saw that the pool was as calm as ever, and the aquatic grass in the pool still continued to slowly drift about.\u201cIn the past month or so, I\u2019ve improved dramatically.\u201d Ning felt incomparably delighted. Whether in Ki, as a Fiendgod, his soul, or even his newly learned divine ability, the [Windwing Evasion], he had improved greatly.\u201cTime to go.\u201dNing instantly leapt up.Swoosh!Like a blurry image, or like a bird in flight, he instantly flew over a kilometer away. His speed was now faster than when Ironwood Zhan had simultaneously used the \u2018Light Body Seal\u2019 and the \u2018Divine Movement Seal\u2019.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In a desolate tribe within the wilderness, there were many overturned stone rooms. The tribe was in a state of desolation. Clearly, the tribesmen had all departed long ago. This was an abandoned place.But at the edges of the tribe, there were a few dozen stone houses that were absolutely spotless, where a group of black armored guards were gathered together.Autumn Leaf was seated on a stone bench, quietly staring into the distance while waiting.Previously, due to the appearance of the Diremonster, Serpentwing, at Serpentwing Lake, Ji Ning had immediately led Autumn Leaf and Mowu out of the Metalstone Tribue\u2026but after the Serpentwing event had died down, Ning had permitted Autumn Leaf and Mowu to temporarily stay here with these black armored guards.The territory which the Ji clan ruled over was simply too vast.Thus, they had squads of black armored guards scattered throughout their domain. Whenever they were needed, they could immediately congregate while shocking and overawing countless tribes.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Autumn Leaf stood up in surprised delight.Those black armored guards and Mowu also turned to look. They saw from the distance a blurry figure appeared in a flash within those ruined tribal houses, then smile and walk towards them.\u201cHuh?\u201d Autumn Leaf was slightly startled. She could tell that her young master, who was walking towards her from afar, was somewhat different. His entire body seemed to radiate a familiar aura, as though the essence of the heavens and the earth were within him! But of course, only she, who had been by Ning\u2019s side since he was young, was able to notice many of these little qualitative changes in Ning.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Mowu stepped forward to pay his respects.\u201cYoung master.\u201d The nearby group of black armored guards all fell to one knee.\u201cMake your preparations. It is time for me to head back.\u201d Ji Ning laughed as he spoke.Autumn Leaf was startled. \u201cGo? Go back?\u201d\u201cFirst to Serpentwing Lake.\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes had a hint of anticipation flash through them. On this adventuring trip, he had decided long ago that upon breaking through and becoming a Xiantian lifeform, he would go deal with Serpentwing. Although Serpentwing had currently broken through to the peak Xiantian level, Ning was still completely confident.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYoung master, you\u2026\u201d Autumn Leaf revealed a look of surprise and delight. Naturally, she knew that Ning planned to go deal with Serpentwing as soon as he broke through to the Xiantian lifeform level.\u201cRight.\u201d Ning nodded.Autumn Leaf was extremely cautious. She didn\u2019t say anything, only nodded repeatedly. \u201cMowu, hurry, gather our things. We\u2019re heading out.\u201dMoments later.Ning, Autumn Leaf, and Mowu, riding three black beasts, departed this ruined tribe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ning and the others had looks of irrepressible joy on their faces. No matter what, they were finally coming home from the border region of Eastmount Marsh. They drew closer and closer to West Prefecture city.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d Autumn Leaf called out.\u201cHm?\u201d Ji Ning looked towards her.Autumn Leaf hurriedly said, \u201cOn this trip to Serpentwing Lake, we\u2019ll pass by Spring Grass\u2019 Blacktooth Tribe. How about let\u2019s go visit her at the Blacktooth Tribe? It has been a long time since I\u2019ve seen her. I miss her very much.\u201d\u201cSpring Grass?\u201d Ning was startled, and in his heart, a surge of longing arose as well. Autumn Leaf and Spring Grass had accompanied him ever since he was young. They were like sisters to him. Originally, despite being unwilling to part from her, he didn\u2019t want to cause Spring Grass to feel sorrow, which was why he permitted her to be with her father again. Now that Spring Grass was suddenly mentioned, Ning couldn\u2019t help but feel a hint of excitement as well as anticipation. \u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go pay a visit on the way.\u201d\u201cThank you, young master.\u201d Autumn Leaf hurriedly said with gratitude.\u201cI want to go as well.\u201d Ning smiled, and as he did, he slapped the black beast on its head, ordering it to change directions slightly.Although in theory they were paying a visit to the Blacktooth Tribe \u2018enroute\u2019 to Serpentwing Lake, in truth, it was still something of a long detour.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013In a rather open mountain cave below a mountain wall, with many large wooden fences nearby. There were some armors hung up in the mouth of the cave, while there were also some long-furred beasts strung up on the trees. Some powerfully built men, their upper bodies bare, were casually chatting while seated, roasting the flesh of a beast.At the cave entrance, ten black armored guards were on watch.\u201cSomeone is coming.\u201d One of the black armored guards called out loudly, and those men who were eating turned to look. One of them, a bare-chested man, stood up and walked over, frowning slightly as he looked over.Three figures made their way over at high speed from within the mountain forests. Seeing that it was three people riding black beasts, they immediately relaxed.The bare-chested man\u2019s face immediately changed, and he hurriedly calld out, \u201cThe young master has arrived, so why haven\u2019t you paid your respects yet? Quick quick quick, all of you, rise!\u201d After speaking, he immediately rushed forward, coming down to one knee at the entrance. Very respectfully, he called out, \u201cYoung master!\u201dBoth the armored men as well as the men with bared chests all came over and knelt down while calling out, \u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cRise.\u201d With a flip, Ning descended from the black beast, laughing at the leader of these black armored guards. \u201cYou\u2019ve met me before?\u201d He had been preparing to take out his insignia just now.\u201cI, Wuzhan, was lucky in the past.\u201d The heroic figure had a scarred face, and his body was powerfully built. \u201cYoung master, in the past, when you sparred with Ninefang Warriors, I once sparred with you, young master. Thus, I was instantly able to recognize you, young master. Behind you should be that Miss Autumn Leaf, your maidservant, young master. I recognize her as well.\u201dNing laughed.So that was the reason why. In the past, he often sparred with Ninefang Warriors, and many of the Ninefang Warriors of the black armored guards had sparred with him. It wasn\u2019t strange for him to meet one of them stationed outside.\u201cI need to ask you about something.\u201d Ning said. \u201cIt has to do with Serpentwing Lake. Come. Let\u2019s talk inside.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d This Captain Wuzhan immediately said. \u201cYoung master, please come with me.\u201dWuzhan guided Ning inside, towards a spacious stone room.\u201cA while ago, Serpentwing ran amok not too far from us. Even we suffered some repercussions.\u201d Wuzhan let out a laughing breath. At this time, another black armored guard came over with a plate of fruits. Ning casually picked up a fruit and took two bites. \u201cHe even came to your place?\u201d\u201cNo. If he had, we\u2019d have been dead for sure.\u201d Wuzhan shook his head. \u201cHowever, at the time, we were all terrified. In the face of Serpentwing, we black armored guards wouldn\u2019t be able to fight back at all. Although we managed to avoid that calamity, many tribes suffered disasters. I can only use the word \u2018miserable\u2019 to describe what happened to them! At that time, we were hoping that Serpentwing would be executed by our Ji clan, but unfortunately\u2026\u201dNing nodded.In the end, Poisondove Ridge had interceded and engaged in negotiations with the Ji clan, with the result being that Serpentwing only had to be confined within Serpentwing Lake for a century.\u201cHas Serpentwing been in Serpentwing Lake the entire time?\u201d Ning asked. \u201cAlso, is he at the bottom of Serpentwing Lake, or in the central island?\u201d\u201cThe bottom of the lake, of course.\u201d Wuzhan said hurriedly. \u201cHow could he dare to stay on the island? He is afraid that our Ji clan will act against him.\u201d\u201cBottom of the lake?\u201d Ning seemed to have thought of something.It seemed that it wouldn\u2019t be so easy for him to kill Serpentwing.\u201cWuzhan.\u201d Ning asked. \u201cDo you know of a tribe known as the Blacktooth Tribe?\u201d\u201cBlacktooth Tribe?\u201d Wuzhan nodded. \u201cI know them, of course I know them. The leader of the Blacktooth Tribe is a very skillful man. He was able to found a new tribe. No ordinary person is capable of founding a new tribe. Unfortunately, the many tribes which Serpentwing harmed had the Blacktooth Tribe amongst their number.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Ning\u2019s face changed dramatically. His heart shuddered.Could it be\u2026Based on what he knew, originally, even before Serpentwing attacked him, Serpentwing had destroyed a small tribe. Everyone in the tribe had died. In the end, it was only through the examination of the corpses of those poor victims that it was determined that Serpentwing was the killer.\u201cDoes the Blacktooth Tribe still exist?\u201d Ning asked hurriedly.\u201cIt does.\u201d Wuzhan nodded. \u201cThis time, Serpentwing caused disaster everywhere. He\u2019d go to a tribe, engage in some slaughter, then leave! It didn\u2019t try to wipe out everyone! After all, to exterminate an entire tribe would take more time and make it easier for our Ji clan\u2019s Xiantian lifeforms to catch up. But although the Blacktooth Tribe wasn\u2019t wiped out, more than half of its tribesmen died. It really is terrible.\u201d\u201cOver half?\u201d Ning\u2019s heart began to clench.\u201cDo you know Spring Grass?\u201d Ning hurriedly asked. \u201cMy maidservant, Spring Grass. Is she still alive?\u201d\u201cSpring Grass?\u201d Wuzhan said questioningly. \u201cI know Spring Grass. You have two maidservants, young master. Can it be that Spring Grass is no longer following you, young master?\u201dNing had released Spring Grass to her freedom, but very few people knew this.\u201cNo. I granted her freedom. She is the daughter of the chief of the Blacktooth Tribe.\u201d Ning said hurriedly.\u201cI don\u2019t know about this.\u201d Wuzhan shook his head. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve seen Blacktooth, I don\u2019t know anything about his daughter.\u201dNing took a deep breath.Worry!Concern!More than half the people of the Blacktooth Tribe had died. Too many had died. Perhaps Spring Grass was amongst them.\u201cDefinitely, she definitely has to be alright.\u201d Ning ground his teeth, then immediately left the stone room.Outside, Autumn Leaf and Mowu were currently seated in a circle with the black armored guards, enjoying some roast meat.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Autumn Leaf and Mowu both turned to look.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Ning hurriedly shouted.Autumn Leaf and Mowu\u2019s gazes were filled with puzzlement. Why were they leaving in such a hurry? However, they didn\u2019t dare ask too much. They hurriedly rose, no longer eating as they headed towards their black beasts.\u201cTo the Blacktooth Tribe.\u201d Ning\u2019s face was gloomy. Kicking the waist of the black beast, he immediately sent it bounding forward.The three black beasts quickly charged into the distant mountain forests.\u201cCaptain, what happened?\u201d The other black armored guards were extremely puzzled. As for Wuzhan, as he walked out of the stone room, he too frowned as he stared into the distance. \u201cSpring Grass? The daughter of the chief of the Blacktooth Tribe?\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Ning\u2019s heart was blazing with worry. Autumn Leaf and Spring Grass, although nominally his servants, were in truth like big sisters to him. He still remembered how when he was young, he would point at the words on the books and stammer out questions. At that time, Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf, despite being \u2018tormented\u2019 by their young master, could only obediently reply.\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cNo way she\u2019s dead.\u201d Ning was extremely worried.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Autumn Leaf asked with concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She could tell that her young master\u2019s face was exceedingly ugly right now. She rarely saw her young master look so furious.Ning shouted, \u201cThe Blacktooth Tribe suffered an attack by Serpentwing. More than half its tribesmen died.\u201d\u201cAh?!\u201d Autumn Leaf was instantly shocked. \u201cThen Spring Grass\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll know once we get there.\u201d Ning shouted back coldly.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!The three black beasts moved at high speed. By the time the sun was beginning to set, the three black beasts arrived at a sparsely covered mountain forest. From the distance, they could faintly see a tribe.\u201cHalt.\u201d Ning shouted.The three beasts quickly came to a halt.\u201cYoung master?\u201d Autumn Leaf\u2019s face was red with worry as well.\u201cGo over there.\u201d Ning pointed into the distance. From the distance, dozens of fur-clad men were currently chopping down trees using hatchets. They were most likely collecting firewood.\u201cThey should be the clansmen of the Blacktooth Tribe. If we ask them, we\u2019ll know.\u201d Ning immediately rode his black beast over, with Autumn Leaf and Mowu following from behind.Soon.Ning arrived in front of those dozens of fur-clad woodcutters. These men all raised their spears and sabers, carefully watching them approach.\u201cI have a question for you.\u201d With a flip of his hand, Ning immediately brought out his insignia, which had a single character on it; \u2018Ji\u2019.\u201cJi clan?\u201dThese tribesmen were all shocked.\u201cDoes your tribe had a person named Spring Grass? She is the daughter of your chief.\u201d Ning barked.\u201cThe chief\u2019s daughter?\u201d A one-eyed man hurriedly said. \u201cOur Blacktooth Tribe doesn\u2019t have anyone known as Spring Grass. Our chief\u2019s daughter is named Miwa!\u201dNing was startled, then he hurriedly said, \u201cRight, her name is Miwa. Is she still alive?\u201d\u201cDead.\u201d\u201cMiwa\u2019s dead.\u201d The tribesmen all said.Ning\u2019s face changed dramatically, and the face of the nearby Autumn Leaf turned utterly white. Her body swayed, and then she collapsed from her black beast. Mowu hurriedly leapt off of his own black beast and caught Autumn Leaf. Autumn Leaf\u2019s face was pale and utterly without color. Her tears had already begun to flow down uncontrollably.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHow did she die?\u201d Ning shouted. \u201cWas it Serpentwing who killed her?\u201d\u201cSerpentwing killed many of the tribesmen of our tribe. Even one of the chief\u2019s son died.\u201d The one-eyed man said. \u201cMany of our tribesmen died right away, while a few others suffered from shrapnel from exploding rocks which smashed into their body, or were frozen\u2026they didn\u2019t die right away, but they were injured. Afterwards, their wounds festered, while others became extremely ill. All of them held on, but eventually died. Many badly injured tribesmen died like that. Miwa, as well, died of illness afterwards.\u201d\u201cSpring Grass!\u201d Autumn Leaf wailed.Ning\u2019s face became all the more terrible, and the mental waves generated by his violent thoughts caused the nearby trees to begin to shake and vibrate.\u201cSerpentwing!\u201d Ning ground his teeth and howled, \u201cI, Ji Ning, so swear that I will definitely kill you! I will definitely kill you!!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They felt as though the entire world around them was shaking.Kill Serpentwing?The youth in front of them was going to kill Serpentwing?\u201cYou didn\u2019t lie to me.\u201d Ji Ning swept this group of tribesmen with his gaze. \u201cMiwa truly died?\u201d\u201cWhy would we lie? The entire Blacktooth Tribe knows this.\u201d The group of experts were filled with terror and panic. Whether it was due to this youth\u2019s aura or the \u2018Ji\u2019 insignia he held, they were in terror of him.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dNing mounted his black beast and began to head straight into the distant Blacktooth Tribe.Autumn Leaf and Mowu mounted their own black beasts and followed.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-There were more than ten tribal warriors standing guard on the two archer towers on each side of the fence gate.\u201cOutsiders, halt.\u201d A warrior immediately shouted angrily.His face sunken, Ning took out his insignia and shouted back, \u201cTell Blacktooth to come see me!\u201dUpon seeing the insignia, the warrior above were terrified and quickly called out, \u201cPlease wait, I\u2019ll go inform the chief right away.\u201d As he spoke, the warrior jumped down directly to the ground, then began to fly towards the tribe. In but a few moments, a black fur clad, scarred man ran in their direction, under escort of a number of warriors. It was the chief of the Blacktooth Tribe, Chief Blacktooth.When he saw the three figures mounted on black beasts, especially the leader, his body suddenly trembled. He immediately howled, \u201cQuick, open the gate and welcome the young master of the Ji clan!\u201d\u201cYoung master of the Ji clan?\u201d The people of a small clan like the Blacktooth Tribe naturally were shocked. They hurriedly began to open the heavy gate.Blacktooth was the first to fall to his knees. \u201cBlacktooth pays his respect to you, young master.\u201dThe other tribal warriors all knelt down as well.\u201cTo your residence.\u201d Ning remained on his black beast as he gave the instruction.\u201cYes.\u201d Blacktooth quickly led the way up ahead.Ning looked at Blacktooth. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a hint of hatred in his heart! He knew that Spring Grass\u2019 death couldn\u2019t be blamed on Blacktooth, and he believed that Blacktooth was heartbroken as well. But Ning couldn\u2019t help but feel hatred and pain\u2026originally, when he had given Spring Grass into her father\u2019s care, he had never imagined that she would die, just like this. If Spring Grass had remained by his side\u2026Ning\u2019s left hand couldn\u2019t help but clench into a fist. Even his knuckles were turning white.\u201cYoung master, this is my residence.\u201d Blacktooth arrived at one of larger stone houses of the tribe. There were two women and a young child at the doorway. These two women and the child were clearly cautious and uneasy.\u201cHe is?\u201d Ning looked at the young child. This child looked very similar to Spring Grass\u2026causing a pang in Ning\u2019s heart.\u201cMy son.\u201d Blacktooth said respectfully, while at the same time, barking to his women and his son, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you left yet?\u201dThe two women and the child immediately left.\u201cSpeak inside. Mowu, you stand guard at the doorway. Don\u2019t let anyone in.\u201d Ning immediately dismounted his black beast and led Autumn Leaf into the house. Blacktooth, terrified, followed him in.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Within the room.Ning looked at Blacktooth, sitting down on a stone chair and saying coldly, \u201cBlacktooth, when I gave Spring Grass into your care, my hope was that the two of you, father and daughter, would be reunited and live a good life! But why is it that I didn\u2019t see Spring Grass upon entering the tribe?\u201dBlacktooth hurriedly said, \u201cYoung master, right now, Spring Grass isn\u2019t within the tribe!\u201d\u201cNot within the tribe?\u201d Ning frowned as he stared accusingly at Blacktooth. Blacktooth still wanted to lie about it?\u201cSoon after Spring Grass returned to the tribe, she encountered a young travelling merchant whom she took a liking to. I knew that travelling merchant, so I had faith in him.\u201d Blacktooth said in a very practiced manner. \u201cWhen one\u2019s daughter grows up, she will have to get married. Thus, I had my daughter marry this travelling merchant. Before Spring Grass left with this travelling merchant\u2026she left a letter for you, young master.\u201dBefore this last sentence, Ning was beginning to grow truly angry as he listened. Blacktooth, you dare deceive me! But upon hearing this last sentence, Ning said softly, \u201cLetter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get it now.\u201d Blacktooth hurriedly ran into a nearby room.\u201cYoung master?\u201d Autumn Leaf looked at Ning.Ning said softly, \u201cDon\u2019t be impatient.\u201dNing\u2019s intelligence wasn\u2019t low. He wasn\u2019t an idiot who only knew how to train. From the intelligence he had gathered\u2026.there was no question that Spring Grass had died! First of all, all of the people outside the tribe were in total agreement, and they even said that Ning could ask anyone in the tribe and would still get this answer.There was no reason for that group of people to deceive him.Also\u2026after having been separated from her father for so long, Spring Grass had wanted to be with him so much that she had even left Ning! How could she immediately get married and leave not long after reuniting with her father?\u201cYoung master, this is the letter Spring Grass left for you.\u201d Blacktooth held a white beast skin parchment and handed it over.Ning took a deep breath. Letter? This was most likely her will. The will which Spring Grass had intentionally left behind amidst her grave illness\u2026Ning stretched out his trembling hand and accepted the white beast skin, opening it and reading carefully.Those graceful characters appeared. These characters were very familiar to him. Upon seeing them, Ning\u2019s heart instantly shook. It was Spring Grass\u2019 handwriting!\u201cYoung master, after returning to the tribe, I was truly very happy, very happy. I saw my father, and I even have two little brothers\u2026I feel as though I did when I was a child, when I was with my parents\u2026.\u201dThis is what the letter said.The letter included all of the joy which Spring Grass had felt. Ning could sense the joy emanating from these words. Spring Grass truly had been happy when she returned to the tribe.\u201cTwo little brothers?\u201d Ning had a thought. Previously, he had only seen a single son of Blacktooth\u2019s, while previously the clansman had said\u2026when Serpentwing had run amok, more than half of the Blacktooth Tribe had died, including the son of the chief.Ning continued to read.\u201cI met him.\u201d\u201cEvery single woman has a man who is destined for her. As soon as I saw him, I knew that he was the one. When I see him smile, I feel happy. When I see him frown, I worry. When I see him training hard with the sword, I stand there and watch. Just looking at him is a gift given by heaven. Thus, I decided\u2026to marry him!\u201dNing clearly saw that there was a splotch here, as though left behind by a tear.Ning\u2019s heart shook.Marry?Was the man which Spring Grass spoke of actually himself? As soon as I saw him, I knew that he was the one. When I see him smile, I feel happy. When I see him frown, I worry. When I see him training hard with the sword, I stand there and watch\u2026.If you wanted to marry me, why didn\u2019t you say it to me yourself!Ning shut his eyes, unable to prevent the tears from flowing down.Although Spring Grass was only a maidservant, most of the men in this area would marry quite a few women. In his previous life, Ning hadn\u2019t loved any woman. In this life, he had quickly become accustomed to this culture. Even if he truly married several women, that wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. But they had to be women which he dearly loved.Ning would have been willing to nod and agree to letting Spring Grass become his woman.\u201cYoung master!\u201d The nearby Autumn Leaf saw that Ning was shedding tears. Her heart couldn\u2019t help but clench. She had been a maidservant since she was young. Naturally, she wouldn\u2019t read a letter while Ning was reading it. But when she saw Ning cry\u2026Autumn Leaf\u2019s heart became panicked.Ning opened his eyes.He continued to read.\u201cYoung master, if you can see this letter, that means you came to the Blacktooth Tribe to see me.\u201d\u201cI really am very happy, very happy. Spring Grass is just a maidservant. For you, young master, to come to the Blacktooth Tribe to visit Spring Grass means at least\u2026Spring Grass has a small place of her own in your heart, young master\u2026Spring Grass is very happy, very happy, truly, very happy.\u201dThe letter concluded here.Ning\u2019s eyes were wet.Very happy?Are you truly very happy?\u201cHahaha.\u201d Ning laughed loudly. His laugh was so sorrowful. This was someone who had been with him his entire life, like family.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Autumn Leaf was worried.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYoung master.\u201d Blacktooth was terrified and uneasy as well.Ning turned to stare at Blacktooth, his eyes as sharp as swords. He growled, \u201cBlacktooth, you still want to try and deceive me? Speak, tell me, tell me everything!!!\u201dUpon hearing this, Blacktooth\u2019s face changed dramatically. And then his body began to tremble.Thud!Blacktooth\u2019s knees hit the ground. His entire body shook in agony, and for a long time, he let out a desolate, heartbroken cry. \u201cMiwaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ji Ning stood there quietly, looking at the agonized Blacktooth, not saying a single word.\u201cSince you already know, young master, then I won\u2019t lie any more. Young master, come with me.\u201d Blacktooth rose and walked out of the room.Ning and Autumn Leaf followed behind him.Blacktooth led the way in front, all the way towards the very back of the tribe. In the very back of the tribe, there was a small door in the wooden fence. Through the wooden door\u2026there was a cemetery far past it. Many of the erected tombs were newly made. Clearly, this was a freshly built cemetery.\u201cYoung master?\u201d Autumn Leaf looked towards Ning, her eyes filled with a hint of unease.Ning held his breath as well. He understood where Blacktooth was taking him.\u201cRight here.\u201d Blacktooth pointed at a seemingly ordinary grave. In front of this grave, there was a large stone, which had just a few words carved into it: \u2018Daughter, Miwa. Erected by Father, Blacktooth.\u2019\u201cSpring Grass.\u201d Ning quietly stood there, looking at the grave.In his life, he had rarely experienced the sensation of heartbreak. Compared to those strong, powerful emotions, Ning preferred calm, quiet, warm emotions. The feeling of seeing someone every morning, and affection for each other slowly growing deeper.Calm and peaceful was real!To treat someone as part of your own life. At least in this life, from when he was an infant until now, the amount of time Spring Grass had spent with him was most likely even greater than his parents had. Ning hadn\u2019t realized it when she was alive, but now that he knew she was dead, he felt as though a piece of his heart had been chopped off.It hurt very much!\u201cBlacktooth.\u201d Ning stood there, looking at the tombstone. Slowly, he said, \u201cTell me everything. Tell me everything which happened after Spring Grass returned.\u201dBlacktooth nodded.\u201cAt first, on the way back, she was actually quite sad. Sad that she had to part with you, young master.\u201d Blacktooth sighed. \u201cBut after she arrived at the tribe and saw her two brothers, Miwa clearly became much happier. She\u2019d often spend time with her two little brothers\u2026the days passed in happiness, and at that time, Miwa had looked forward to young master one day coming to visit her.\u201d\u201cOnly!\u201dBlacktooth\u2019s voice sunk. \u201cOne day, Serpentwing arrived. It was like a nightmare, causing countless members of our tribe to die, one of which was my son, Waterfront.\u201d\u201cThe death of Waterfront, her little brother, hurt Miwa very much.\u201dNing remembered that beast skin letter which discussed some of the events Miwa had experienced upon returning to the Blacktooth Tribe. Many were stories regarding her and her two little brothers. Clearly, Miwa truly doted on her two little brothers. This caused Ning to quietly come to the decision that he would have to help out Spring Grass\u2019 sole surviving brother, as a way to help console Miwa\u2019s soul in heaven.\u201cSerpentwing\u2019s attack caused the entire Blacktooth Tribe to fall into an abyss of fear and pain! The tribesmen were afraid, afraid that Serpentwing could attack again. Some of the tribesmen even fled the tribe and joined other, larger tribes.\u201d\u201cEveryone in the tribe was in a state of panic.\u201d Blacktooth continued, \u201cMany tribesmen would leave. Actually, after Serpentwing\u2019s attack, our tribe\u2019s population became less than a thousand. With so many tribesmen fleeing\u2026if this continued, the Blacktooth Tribe would have fallen apart soon.\u201dNing nodded.\u201cI had undergone countless difficulties in order to build the tribe. Naturally, I didn\u2019t want it to fall apart just like that.\u201d Blacktooth said. \u201cSpring Grass felt sympathy for me, so she put down her embarrassment and wrote a letter and asked the tribesmen to deliver it to West Prefecture City to give it to you, young master. She wanted to ask you, young master, to help my Blacktooth Tribe.\u201d\u201cOnly, we quickly received the news that you, young master, were out adventuring.\u201d Blacktooth shook his head.Ning ground his teeth.Right.He had gone adventuring long before Serpentwing had reached the peak of the Xiantian stage. Naturally, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to find him.\u201cThe tribesmen suggested that our Blacktooth Tribe should consider go asking for the protection of that extremely large tribe, the \u2018Riverside Tribe\u2019.\u201d Blacktooth said in a dark voice. \u201cAs long as we could receive the protection of the Riverside Tribe and be permitted to temporarily reside within Riverside City, everything would be fine.\u201d\u201cRiverside City?\u201d Ning murmured to himself.As one of the hegemons of the Swallow Mountain area, the Ji clan naturally had to control the many tribes within this territory. No tribe\u2019s population was permitted to expand beyond fifty thousand! Once they expanded beyond fifty thousand, they might become a threat to the Ji clan\u2019s rule. Thus, if that happened, the Ji clan would definitely use some brutal, ruthless methods to overawe the surrounding tribes.Thus, a fifty thousand man tribe was considered an extremely large tribe. The Riverside Tribe was one such tribe! Because the tribe was large, the walls of the tribe were made from enormous rocks, like a small city. Although it couldn\u2019t compare to a large city like the West Prefecture City which held hundreds of thousands of citizens, it was still an extremely powerful tribe amongst the countless tribes.Generally speaking, tribes that were able to erect such a city had a Xiantian lifeform guarding them.\u201cRiverside City had two powerful Xiantian lifeforms. Diremonsters wouldn\u2019t dare go there.\u201d Blacktooth said. \u201cOur Blacktooth Tribe only had a few hundred people. As long as we could enter Riverside City! Once Serpentwing was dealt with, everything would then return to normal.\u201d\u201cWe went to pay our respects to a powerful figure within Riverside City, River He, and offered treasures, wanting him to accept our Blacktooth Tribe hide within for a time.\u201d Blacktooth ground his teeth. \u201cBut that River He was very picky. He didn\u2019t have any interest in those treasures we offered. But he took an interest in Miwa.\u201d\u201cHe wanted Miwa to become his woman, and in exchange, he would help the Blacktooth Tribe this time. You know how haughty Miwa is. Of course she didn\u2019t accept. She immediately left!\u201d A ferocious look flashed through Blacktooth\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat River He actually sent his subordinates to go capture Miwa, wanting to forcibly take her back.\u201d\u201cHowever, Miwa was very powerful, and she used very high class sword techniques as well. She beat Jiang He\u2019s servants half to death\u2026Miwa had also said at the time, \u2018My master is the young master of the Ji clan. Jiang He, don\u2019t go too far!\u2019\u201d\u201cThat Jiang He just laughed loudly and said, \u2018Even if you are the maidservant of young master Ji, you are just a female servant. If you were able to successfully ask your young master for help, then you wouldn\u2019t come here asking me for help. What\u2019s more, how could the maidservant of a young master of the Ji clan end up in such a small tribe?\u2019\u201d Blacktooth ground his teeth. \u201cThis Jiang He added another sentence\u2026\u2018If you become my woman, I will protect the Blacktooth Tribe! Otherwise, just wait for death.\u2019 After this, we left Riverside City.\u201dAutumn Leaf, hearing this, was enraged. \u201cHow could Sister Spring Grass possibly agree to him!\u201d\u201cSpring Grass wouldn\u2019t agree.\u201d Ning shook his head while looking at Blacktooth.\u201cRight. Spring Grass was completely unwilling.\u201d Blacktooth shook his head in pain. \u201cBut seeing how panicked the tribesmen were and how members of the tribe often fled, and seeing how agonized I was\u2026.for the sake of me, her father, after agonizing for three days, she still agreed.\u201d\u201cHow could Sister Spring Grass be so stupid!!!\u201d Autumn Leaf was frantic.Ning shut his eyes.He could imagine the mental struggle which Spring Grass had gone through during those three days. For the sake of her father, was it worth it?\u201cMiwa became River He\u2019s woman.\u201d Blacktooth\u2019s voice was trembling slightly. \u201cBut when Miwa was completely unprepared, River He suddenly launched a sneak attack, smashing Miwa\u2019s dantian with a palm strike and dispersing all of the ki in her body while mocking her\u2026.\u2018You stupid woman, there are countless tribes which want to be protected by my Riverside Tribe. Just because you became my woman, I have to help you? Hahaha, what a dreamer!\u2019\u201d\u201cDetestable!!!\u201d Autumn Leaf was so angry that she was shaking.Ning ground his teeth.Spring Grass. Oh, Spring Grass!Why did you trust that bastard? Why did you have to sacrifice yourself for your father? Why?\u201cThe Serpentwing affair quickly calmed down. The Ji clan imprisoned Serpentwing within Serpentwing Lake, causing Serpentwing to not dare to come out at all.\u201d Blacktooth said. \u201cOnce this news came out from the Ji clan, all the tribes quickly settled down. The hearts of our Blacktooth Tribe\u2019s tribesmen calmed down as well, and some of the tribesmen who had fled actually returned.\u201d\u201cI was worried about Miwa, so I went to look for her.\u201d Blacktooth said in a low voice. \u201cOnly when I went looking for her did I find out the situation had changed. After using all sorts of methods, I finally managed to have a private meeting with Miwa. As soon as Miwa saw me, Miwa began to cry, cry so hard!\u201dNing shut his eyes.He could imagine Spring Grass\u2019s agony, regret, and heartbreak.\u201cShe said that this was her own mistake. It was her own stupidity, and that it wasn\u2019t the fault of myself, her father. She had willingly done this.\u201d Blacktooth said in agony. \u201cShe also said\u2026she didn\u2019t want you, young master, to learn of this. She didn\u2019t want to make you feel heartbroken, which is why she concocted this story of her marrying a travelling merchant, which she left for you in that letter she gave you.\u201d\u201cAfter giving me the letter, Miwa died. She took poison.\u201d Blacktooth said softly. \u201cI knew how much agony my daughter was in. Death was perhaps a type of release. Actually, when she died, she was murmuring your name. She didn\u2019t want you to know why she died.\u201dNing gently nodded.Understood.He understood.After having been with each other for so long, how could he not understand what Spring Grass was thinking?She wanted that happy, cheerful Spring Grass to live on in Ning\u2019s heart\u2026.she didn\u2019t want Ning to learn of the humiliations she had suffered!\u201cEvery single woman has a man who is destined for her. As soon as I saw him, I knew that he was the one. When I see him smile, I feel happy. When I see him frown, I worry. When I see him training hard with the sword, I stand there and watch. Just looking at him is a gift given by heaven\u2026\u201d\u201cI really am very happy, very happy. Spring Grass is just a maidservant. For you, young master, to come to the Blacktooth Tribe to visit Spring Grass means at least\u2026Spring Grass has a small place of her own in your heart, young master\u2026Spring Grass is very happy, very happy, truly, very happy.\u201dNing opened his eyes, tears faintly visible within them.He quietly walked towards the tombstone, sitting down in front of him. Holding a bamboo tube in his hands, he said softly, \u201cSpring Grass, in the past, you always poured wine for me. It is my turn to pour wine for you.\u201d The wine within the bamboo tube dripped onto the ground in front of the tombstone.\u201cI know. I understand. I know that you are forever the happy Spring Grass, forever happy!\u201d\u201cYour stupidity truly is adorable.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing laughed, but his eyes were filled with tears. \u201cI know what happened to you, but I don\u2019t look upon you. How could a little brother look down on his big sister? Although sometimes his big sister might be a bit stupid\u2026you will always be the big sister of Ji Ning.\u201dHearing the words, \u2018big sister\u2019, the nearby Autumn Leaf\u2019s lips trembled, and she let out a whimper.\u201cSis, you were too tired. Sleep, sleep, have a good sleep.\u201d Ning said softly. \u201cThose people who took advantage of you, sis, those people who caused you to be heartbroken\u2026I won\u2019t spare any of them. Not one.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dNing put down the bamboo tube and rose. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Riverside Tribe.

Shaking his head, Blacktooth said, \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d But a look of anticipation through his eyes. He knew\u2026that this young master of the Ji clan was going to the Riverside Tribe to get revenge for his daughter.But given the status of the Riverside Tribe, would this young master of the Ji clan be able to do so?\u201cEven if young master Ji isn\u2019t able to get revenge, his father, the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan, definitely is.\u201d Blacktooth\u2019s heart was filled with hatred. He truly hated River He, but unfortunately, his own strength was insufficient.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014The Riverside Tribe was hundreds of kilometers away from the Blacktooth Tribe, and mountains lay in the way. Only when the sun rose on the next day did they arrive at the Riverside Tribe.Every single nearby tribe was living within the city.A place where over fifty thousand tribesmen were living\u2026this was essentially a city.\u201cAll of you, come over.\u201d\u201cRight, go on in.\u201d\u201cGo on through.\u201dThe armored guards at the gate inspected the items of the people entering the city. The Riverside Tribe had enemies, and they were concerned about people possibly smuggling in large amounts of siege bows and other such weapons.\u201cHuh? You three!\u201d Suddenly, an armored guard saw three black armored beasts galloping over at high speed. Seeing that they didn\u2019t seem to have any intentions on slowing down, he immediately shouted, \u201cQuickly come to a halt. If you charge through the gate of our Riverside City, we will release arrows.\u201d Instantly, the archers above on the guard tower nocked their bows. They wouldn\u2019t show any mercy at all.Swoosh!Ning, who had been seated on the back of that black east, suddenly flew into the air, charging onto the top of that enormous city wall. And then, a surging wave of invisible energy instantly swept outwards. The dozens of armored guards that were originally on top of the city guard tower felt their bodies suddenly sway, and then they smashed downwards out of the guard tower.Suddenly, Ning was the only person standing atop the guard tower.Those armored guards fell down, all of their faces grimy with dirt, and some of the unluckier ones even had bones broken. However, these were all powerful, valiant warriors. They normally wouldn\u2019t be injured much just from falling down from the top of the city walls. They only were now because they had been caught off guard by that energy wave which had knocked them down.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on.\u201d\u201cHe, he\u2026\u201dA group of armored guards stared at Ji Ning, standing atop the city walls, and then looked at their empty hands. Hurriedly, they moved to pick up the bows that had fallen onto the ground as well.Standing atop the city walls, Ning stared into the city and let out an enraged bellow, \u201cRiver He, I order you to come out!\u201d\u201cRiver He, I order you to come out!\u201d \u201cRiver He, I order you to come out!\u201d \u201cRiver He, I order you to come out!\u201d \u2026.This furious bellow that seemed to have come from a Fiendgod exploded forth like thunder. The guards that had been nearby the city walls as well as some passer-byers all clapped their hands to their ears in pain, and some of them even began to flee.The furious roar echoed throughout every location of the entire Riverside City.Ning\u2019s face was dark. With a massive kick, an enormous exploding sound was heard!\u201cDONG!\u201d An enormous wall like this one which was six or seven meters thick was extremely durable, but thanks to Ning\u2019s kick, it began to vibrate powerfully. One giant crack after another began to appear on the tall, powerful city wall, and some distortions and cracks even began to appear in the ground below it. This kick had caused even the ground nearby to ripple and shake as though the ground was a pool of water, and those armored guards were so terrified that they hurriedly retreated.\u201cDONG!\u201d Ning delivered yet another kick!The nearby earth began to shudder yet again, and a large number of cracks had now appeared within the wall. Many stones began to tumble down, and the stone guard tower itself began to shudder, as though preparing to crack at any moment.\u201cDONG!\u201d Ning delivered one final kick!Rumble\u2026.The city wall which was already covered with countless cracks finally collapsed. Many boulders came falling down. Instantly, the massive city gate became a pile of rubble. The tall, massive city walls fell downwards towards the street. This scene of rubble lying everywhere caused those armored guards and civilians who had run away long ago to stare in shock.\u201cMy God\u2026\u201d\u201cThe city towers\u2026\u201dNone of them could believe it. The walls of the main gate to a city were the thickest, most stable parts of the city. Even siege machines would at most attack the gates. Attacking the city walls would be entirely useless. That seamless, tough stone that was six or seven meters thick\u2026.even if a person slashed down onto it with a knife, at most a scar would be left behind.Kicking down the city walls with just three kicks?Swoosh! Swoosh!Autumn Leaf and Mowu, riding their black beasts, quickly arrived at the area of rubble. By now, Ning had already landed on the rubble as well.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-River Sansi was current seated in the lotus position within a quiet room, fragrant room.He was the chief of the Riverside Tribe, a very famous and reputable person in the territory controlled by the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan.\u201cRiver He, I order you to come out!\u201d An enraged bellow suddenly rang out.\u201cHuh?\u201d River Sansi suddenly opened his eyes.DONG! DONG! DONG!The subsequent three massive sounds caused River Sansi\u2019s face to change. He immediately transformed into a ray of light, hurrying out.Moments later.River Sansi, as a Xiantian lifeform, had already reached the city gates, where those enormous sounds had come from. Upon seeing the destroyed city gates and the rubble, River Sansi\u2019s eyes instantly turned red! The city gates had been destroyed. This was like spitting directly into the Riverside Tribe\u2019s face, giving them no leeway at all.\u201cYou are River Sansi?\u201d Ning stood atop the rubble. Seeing this black haired old man suddenly appear, he immediately barked towards him. The entire Riverside Tribe only had two Xiantian lifeforms, one male, one female. The male, of course, was River Sansi.The black haired old man stared at Ning, his face an ugly sight. \u201cNo matter who you are, you can\u2019t trample the honor and dignity of our Ji clan like this.\u201d As soon as he spoke, within his hands, a purple set of chains appeared. With a massive whirl, he sent those chain links flying towards Ning in an attack. Just from the way Ning was acting, there was no question at all that he was the person who had done this.Swoosh!Ning suddenly charged forward, moving forward at an intense speed, generating a faint howl like that of a great Roc.Swish! Ning landed a kick directly on the chest of that black-haired old man, causing the black haired old man to fly backwards. A deep crevice appeared in the stone ground, with the old man sunken into it. The black haired old man immediately jumped up, clutching his chest, a hint of blood on his lips. His face covered in astonishment, he looked at Ning. \u201cYou\u2026who are you?\u201dHow could this happen? His magic treasure had yet to strike Ning, but Ning had sent him flying with a kick. Fortunately, he was protected by his Xiantian Ki.\u201cHmph.\u201d Ning sneered coldly. \u201cHave River He come out.\u201dShua!Yet another figure appeared, this one red-colored. It was an old lady with white hair dressed in red clothes. The old lady hurriedly helped prop up River Sansi. \u201cSansi, are you alright?\u201d\u201cBe careful. He is very powerful.\u201d River Sansi said quietly.The red-clothed old granny look at Ning, shouting, \u201cI don\u2019t know how our Riverside Tribe has offended you. In addition, who are you? You destroyed our gates. I trust you wouldn\u2019t be so cowardly as to not even dare to give us your name!\u201dNing said coldly, \u201cJi clan! Ji Ning!\u201d\u201cJi Ning?\u201d The red-clothed granny was puzzled.\u201cJi Ning?\u201d The black haired elder, River Sansi, was greatly astonished. He hurriedly said in a soft voice to the nearby granny, \u201cAunty Snow, the next Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture has been decided upon already. It is someone named Ji Ning. But he is only eleven years old. How could he\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture?\u201d Aunty Snow was shocked.Although they were shocked at Ning becoming a Xiantian lifeform at the age of eleven, they were even more shocked by Ning\u2019s status; the next Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture! It was common for a person to become a Xiantian before reaching the age of twenty. The Ji clan alone had quite a few, such as Ji Lie who had also been hoping that one of the three tribal youths he had brought up would reach the Xiantian level before the age of sixteen. If Ji Ning had trained in other Fiendgod Body Refining methods, he most likely would have reached the Xiantian level as a toddler.In the numerous tribes, there were even more talented individuals.There were quite a few who reached the Xiantian level before the age of twenty. River Sansi was one such person! But these tribes didn\u2019t have any powerful, ultimate techniques. The more they trained, the lower their potential became compared to the Ji clan!\u201cJi clan of the West Prefecture?\u201d Aunty Snow stared at the youth in front of her. Their Riverside Tribe was within the territory of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture and was under their direct authority!If the Ji clan of the West Prefecture wanted to destroy the Riverside Tribe, it could be accomplished as easily as lifting their hand up.\u201cYoung master!\u201d A voice suddenly rang out.Over a hundred black armored guards appeared from afar. Upon seeing Ning standing atop the rubble, the leader of the black armored guards, greatly shocked, immediately fell down to one knee. The other black armored guards all hurriedly called out respectfully, \u201cYoung master!\u201d\u201cRise.\u201d Ning glanced at them sideways. In these extremely large tribes, the Ji clan would usually send a squadron of a hundred black armored guards to stay there and watch over them.\u201cYes.\u201dThe black armored guards hurriedly ran over, standing around Ji Ning.\u201cYoung master Ji Ning.\u201d The old granny, Aunty Snow, bowed slightly. \u201cSince it is River He who angered you, young master, my Riverside Tribe naturally will not protect him. Sansi, go bring River He out as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d The black haired elder, River Sansi, immediately went.A single Xiantian individual wouldn\u2019t be enough to cause the Riverside Tribe to lower their heads! Even if the Xiantian belonged to the Ji clan, that didn\u2019t mean anything. After all, everything had to have a reason. The Ji clan couldn\u2019t act wildly either, otherwise how could the many tribes submit peacefully? A single ordinary Xiantian lifeform was not able to destroy a large-scale tribe.But if it was the Prefecture Lord himself! Then the situation would be different.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cKeep training!\u201dRiver He was an extremely handsome young man with white skin. Only, his eyes contained an extreme arrogance. Currently, he was holding a whip while looking at a toddler, who was wielding a shortsword and training in swordplay. \u201cNo matter how sore or painful your arm feels, endure it. You will be the future clan leader of our Riverside clan!\u201d\u201cYes, Father.\u201d The toddler gritted his teeth, continuing to train. He didn\u2019t dare stop. Stopping meant a whip would come his way.Suddenly\u2026.\u201cRiver He, come out.\u201d A furious roar rang out.River He\u2019s face changed. \u201cWho dares to be this impudent and act like this in Riverside City? This person cannot be ordinary.\u201dDONG! DONG! DONG!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe three kicks which had smashed open the city walls were like kicks against his heart, causing River He to unconsciously feel panic. \u201cWho is it? Who has come looking for me?\u201d No longer paying any attention to anything else, Riverside He hurriedly rushed towards the outside.\u201cHe, what is it?\u201d The inside of the manor was in a state of chaos. His wife came out as well, seemingly very panicked. Some of his other women were worried as well, but some of them were secretly rejoicing at his impending misfortune.\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201d River He headed outside.Just as he walked out of his manor, from afar, a black figure suddenly pounced downwards, arriving directly in front of River He. River He was shocked when he saw the person. \u201cClan leader.\u201d The black haired elder, River Sansi, stared at him coldly. Sansi had an extremely ugly look on his face, and there was blood at the corner of his mouth. His clothes were extremely dirty. \u201cThis is all your doing.\u201d As he said this, he grabbed River He by the neck, as though he were picking up a chicken.Swoosh! He transformed into a ray of light, moving at high speed towards the city gate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, given that he is still young, I wonder if he might perhaps be spared?\u201d In the struggles and battles between tribes, it was generally possible for an important person who had been captured to be released in exchange for a ransom.Ning glanced at her coldly, not saying a word.Aunty Snow instantly frowned. She understood that young master Ji Ning\u2019s decision to kill River He was unshakable.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhy have the city gates been destroyed?\u201d\u201cWhat is going on in the Riverside Tribe?\u201d\u201cLook, look, that youngster is surrounded by a group of black armored guards. He must be an important figure within the Ji clan.\u201d Some of the outsiders who had come to engage in trade in Riverside City quickly began to congregate towards this direction.Seeing the situation, Aunty Snow immediately shouted, \u201cHave all those onlookers f*ck off.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe armored guards of the Riverside Tribe immediately acknowledged, and quickly began to shoo aside those outsiders as well as even some people of the clan, not letting them draw close.\u201cOut of the way!\u201d\u201cOut of the way!\u201dOne unit after another of guards quickly ran at high speed towards the distant streets, all of them wielding bows and other sorts of weapons. The leader of the units were all core, high-level people of the Riverside Tribe. Clearly, they had heard those explosive sounds from earlier and were worried that an enemy had come in force, and so they had quickly brought their own people to come over.\u201cGranny Snow.\u201d A white-haired elder led a group to rush over. Upon seeing Aunty Snow, he immediately called out respectfully.Aunty Snow only glanced at him.One squadron after another drew near. All of the core members of the Riverside Tribe had arrived.\u201cSwoosh!\u201d A black shadow drew near at high speed as well, only slowing down once it reached the armored guards. Those armored guards wanted to block the black shadow, but when they saw it come to a halt, they were shocked. \u201cClan leader!\u201dRiver Sansi\u2019s face was like ice. Still holding onto that handsome young man, he passed straight through the crowd. All of the core members of the tribe stared at River He in confusion. River He was one of River Sansi\u2019s grandchildren, and was greatly valued by River Sansi. In the Riverside Tribe, his position was in the top ten of the entire tribe. Why had the clan leader dragged him here?\u201cSwish!\u201d River Sansi directly tossed him out.River He fell face-first into the rubble and rocks, wounds appearing on his face and his body becoming covered with dust. He hurriedly raised his head and stood up, looking around him. Soon, his gaze settled down upon the fur-clad youth who was surrounded by black armored guards.\u201cYoung master Ji Ning, I brought him for you.\u201d River Sansi stood together with Aunty Snow.\u201cYou are River He?\u201d Ning stared judgingly at River He. He couldn\u2019t help but think of poor Spring Grass, and his heart began to flood with a desire to slaughter!River He could feel that this young master Ji Ning emanated an aura of power and influence. In front of this young master Ji Ning\u2026even the clan leader and Granny Snow had to lower their heads.\u201cRiver He pays his respects to you, young master.\u201d River He said respectfully.\u201cRiver He\u2026River He\u2026\u201d Ning gently murmured, his eyes as sharp as daggers as he stared at this youth in front of him. \u201cDo you know why I have come to find you?\u201dNing\u2019s voice was very soft.But when River He heard his voice, his heart shook. He could sense the murderous intent contained within Ji Ning\u2019s voice!\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d River He stared at Ning. \u201cYoung master Ji Ning, have you come to kill me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ning nodded.The entire area was utterly silent.River Sansi and Aunty Snow just watched. The core members of the Riverside Tribe just watched as well. They could tell\u2026that this young master Ji Ning clearly had the power to change their entire world. Even the clan leader had to submit to him. In addition, Ji Ning\u2019s desire to kill River He was clearly very strong. They just quietly sighed to themselves\u2026the glorious River He, whose prospects had been limitless, was going to die today!\u201cYoung master Ji Ning, if you wish to kill me, then I have no choice but to die.\u201d River He\u2019s handsome face didn\u2019t have a hint of fear on it. He looked at Ning. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know why you are going to kill me, young master?\u201d\u201cWhy I am going to kill you?\u201d Ning looked at him.Hua.A Darknorth sword appeared out of nowhere into Ji Ning\u2019s hands. Sword light flashed across River He\u2019s body. Instantly, a terrifying, suppressive aura swept out, but River He didn\u2019t dodge. The nearby River Sansi and Aunty Snow just watched quietly as well. Even if Ji Ning had killed River He with this sword attack, they wouldn\u2019t say a word.Chi! Chi! Chi! River He\u2019s body now had six bloody holes appear on it. His blood flowed outwards from those holes, which were situation in his legs, shoulders, and other non-lethal points.\u201cThis!\u201d River He stared, his eyes wide. \u201cShe\u2026she was your\u2026\u201d\u201cNow do you understand?\u201d Ning looked at him.The sword technique he had displayed just now when stabbing six bloody holes into River He was the sword technique of Spring Grass. When River He had originally ordered his servants to capture Spring Grass, this was the technique Spring Grass had relied upon when she had beaten those servants half to death before leaving.\u201cA mere woman. Young master Ji Ning, you are going to kill me for a mere woman? Women are nothing more than merchandise, just property.\u201d River He howled in disbelief, unwilling to accept this. \u201cI\u2019m willing to offer ten or a hundred women to you, young master. In addition, she was just a slave. I\u2019m willing to do anything so long as you are willing to spare me, young master.\u201d\u201cIn my eyes\u2026you can\u2019t even compare to a single hair on her head.\u201d Ning said coldly.His face ashen, River He immediately retrieved a dagger from within his breastpocket. In a gloomy voice, he said, \u201cYoung master Ji Ning, I, River He, have offended you, young master, and I deserve to be killed. There\u2019s no need for you to dirty your hands, young master. River He will end it personally.\u201d As he spoke, he stabbed with his dagger towards his heart.Dang!A sword flash collided against the dagger, sending it flying.\u201cYou actually think you\u2019ll be able to die so easily?\u201d Ning stared at River He. \u201cWhen she died, she did so in agony and humiliation! How can I possibly let you die so easily?\u201dRiver He gritted his teeth as he looked at Ning.Ning shouted, \u201cMowu!\u201d\u201cYoung master.\u201d Mowu immediately stepped forward.\u201cThe suspension punishment.\u201d Ning said coldly. \u201cHang up him at the top of Riverside City.\u201dRiver He\u2019s face turned white.The suspension punishment generally meant one would have his hands and feet bound up, then hung up in the air and given nothing to eat or drink while allowing the sun to bake the criminal. In addition, prior to this, Ning had left six bloody holes on River He\u2019s body. Given River He\u2019s life force, he naturally wouldn\u2019t die due to bloodloss, but the blood he had lost would attract some birds. The birds which would dare to draw near to the top of Riverside City were all ordinary birds. They would occasionally take a peck out of River He\u2019s flesh.He would slowly be tortured to death in the midst of starvation, agony, and terror\u2026In addition, countless tribesmen would all be watching. The humiliation he would feel in his heart would cause a proud figure like River He even more agony.\u201cYes.\u201d Mowu quickly retrieved a set of chains and began to bind and fetter River He. River He knelt there, his head lowered, not daring to make a sound.\u201cFather!\u201d A fierce cry rang out, and a toddler came running out from the crowd.\u201cF*ck off.\u201d Seeing that toddler running over, he hurriedly shouted in anger, \u201cF*ck off, f*ck off!\u201d\u201cFather.\u201d The toddler sobbed. Although his father was strict in forcing him to train with the sword, his father deeply loved him.The distant River Sansi frowned. \u201cTake the child away!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dImmediately, two guards charged forward, grabbing the child and leaving with him. But that child continued to wildly struggle while staring at Ji Ning, his eyes filled with hate.Ning only stared back calmly at the child. When he was very young, his father, Ji Yichuan, had him train in courage by having him go kill some prisoners. He had seen far more terrifying glares before. The slave markets of West Prefecture City\u2026he had seen numbness, despair, insanity, hatred, supplication. He had seen every sort of gaze there was.\u201cHang him up at the highest point of the city.\u201d Mowu had two black armored guards help.River He was completely tied up in metal chains, and his hair was a mess. The nearby tribesmen watched, some of their eyes filled with pity. Others delighted in his misfortune. This humiliation caused River He\u2019s entire body to shake constantly.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Mowu said softly towards Ji Ning. \u201cThat son of River He\u2019s\u2026when cutting grass, you must tear out the roots!\u201dNing glanced coldly at Mowu.Mowu hurriedly lowered his head, not daring to say anything else.\u201cI will spend the next few days at Riverside City.\u201d Ning looked at the nearby River Sansi and Aunty Snow. \u201cNo need to trouble you. I will stay at the place where the black armored guards are stationed. I will watch as River He slowly dies. After he is dead, I will leave.\u201dThe bodies of the surrounding core members of the tribe all shook. All of them could sense the hatred within Ning\u2019s voice.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-At first, River He didn\u2019t have too many problems, baking there in the sun. Afterwards, when some crows began to feast on his flesh, and when the sun began to cause his skin to dry and crack, revealing his red flesh, the pain he went through was absolute hell.Because of the ki in his body, River He\u2019s life force was very strong, but this now became a source of agony to him.He was baked in the sun until his skin cracked and his flesh congealed. In the midst of this agony, he moaned for three days and two nights before finally dying.This entire time, Ning remained at Riverside City.After the black armored guards reported that River He had died in agony, Ning finally took a cold look at River He\u2019s tattered corpse, then turned and led Mowu and Autumn Leaf away, mounted on their black beasts.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Ning left Riverside City at night.Riverside Sansi was currently seated in front of a table, quietly drinking wine from a beastskull cup.There was a toddler kneeling within the courtyard.\u201cCai, child.\u201d Sansi lifted his beastskull cup. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you one more time. Do you want to kill young master Ji Ning?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t dare. Cai doesn\u2019t dare.\u201d The kneeling toddler said hurriedly.\u201cAlas.\u201dRiver Sansi shook his head. In a soft voice, he murmured, \u201cThe hatred you feel will be a disaster to my Riverside Tribe.\u201d\u201cServants!\u201d River Sansi called out.\u201cMaster.\u201d A servant entered and knelt down.\u201cAlright.\u201dRiver Sansi said coldly, \u201cExecute all of those servants of River He. None of them are to be spared! River He\u2019s women are to be sold off at the slave markets!\u201d\u201cClan leader.\u201d The toddler grew frantic. One of them was his mother.\u201cAnd him.\u201d River Sansi looked coldly at the toddler. \u201cRiver He\u2019s only son\u2026he is to be sold off at the slave market as well!\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d The toddler hurriedly kowtowed. \u201cClan leader, spare me, spare me!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The servant replied respectfully, and then stepped forward, grabbing the toddler, then departing.The toddler continued to struggle, sob, and cry.Slave?Why!Why had this happened!Watching as the toddler cried and called out in agony, River Sansi was silent.\u201cMaster, you are going to sell River He\u2019s women and children as slaves?\u201d A human figure appeared within the dark corners of the room.River Sansi nodded. When River He had been undergoing the suspension punishment, Sansi had sent people to secretly ask River He\u2026and only then did he understand that the source of this problem came from the Miwa of the Blacktooth Tribe! River Sansi had even sent people to the Blacktooth Tribe to speak with Blacktooth to clearly understand what this was about. And then, he had put to death all of the servants who knew anything about this affair at all.\u201cJi Ning doesn\u2019t wish for Spring Grass\u2019 affair to spread out.\u201d River Sansi said calmly. \u201cSpring Grass had once said that she was the servant of young master Ji. Everyone who heard these words needs to be put to death.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no point in keeping River He\u2019s women either.\u201d\u201cRiver He\u2019s sole child, Cai\u2026he has too much hatred towards Ji Ning. I asked him several times. Although he verbally stated that he wouldn\u2019t seek revenge, how could a toddler like him deceive me? I could see straight to his heart in a single glance. His hatred of Ji Ning is bone deep.\u201d Sansi shook his head. \u201cAt such a young age, he has already learned to cover up his thoughts. In the future, once he rises to a position of great power within the tribe, given the hatred he feels for Ji Ning, I fear that he might act in a way that would cause our entire Riverside Tribe to be destroyed!\u201d\u201cEverything that I am doing is to ensure that the Ji clan knows that our Riverside Tribe is loyal!\u201dThe man in the darkness was silent.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBreaker Three.\u201d River Sansi spoke out.\u201cMaster.\u201d The man in the darkness replied.\u201cSend out Breaker Nine.\u201d River Sansi said. \u201cTake Cai away in the darkness and send him to the territory under the control of the Ironwood clan and have him just join a small tribe at random. Make him give Cai good training! If Cai has talent and always works hard, give him good tutelage. If Cai quickly forgets his hatred and doesn\u2019t train hard, then kill him and have Breaker Nine return.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The figure in the darkness nodded.\u201cHatred\u2026is a source of strength as well.\u201d River Sansi murmured softly. \u201cOur Riverside Tribe, compared to the Ji clan\u2026we\u2019re too weak, too weak\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If we let him grow up, in the future, it will most likely be detrimental to you, young master.\u201dJi Ning cast a sideways glance at Mowu.Autumn Leaf hurriedly said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Mowu who said this to me. I knew that you wouldn\u2019t be happy, but after thinking about it for a long time, I felt I had to say this.\u201dNing let out a sigh. \u201cMy enmity was with River He. I have no enmity with his son. I went to get revenge. Why do I have to harm his child as well?\u201d\u201cBut when tribes engage in battles against each other, we generally utterly destroy any remaining threats\u2026\u201d Autumn Leaf wanted to speak.\u201cI understand.\u201d Ning nodded. \u201cFor the sake of the tribe\u2019s survival\u2026any sort of measures and means can be used! But how can a small child like him possibly affect my Ji clan? My Ji clan controls this area, and has put countless people to death. Who knows how many people secretly hate our Ji clan? The reason that my Ji clan is able to remain in command isn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t offend people, but rather because we ourselves are powerful!\u201dAutumn Leaf begun to understand a bit.\u201cEven if we don\u2019t offend others, if we aren\u2019t powerful, others will still come and destroy you.\u201d Ji Ning said calmly. \u201cBut if we are powerful, then those secret enemies might secretly feel resentment, but publicly they will still be very respectful. Most likely, a century later, their sons and grandsons will have truly become loyal subjects of our Ji clan.\u201d\u201cIn addition, when experts train, the heart and mind is very important.\u201d Ning said.The mind and the heavens become one! One with the world!The mind gains insights into the Dao, and learns the true meaning of the Dao!Ning understood that a person who was training in the Dao had to be true to himself. Only with a clear mind and clear conscience could one improve at a faster rate when training.\u201cIf a person is not true to himself, not only will he be frustrated, he will also come to a halt in his training, or perhaps even lose ground.\u201d Ning shook his head. \u201cIf I, Ji Ning, want to kill someone, I will only kill him and him alone. I will not harm his wife and children! This is my true self!\u201dIn his past life, his illness had tormented him and caused him to always be alone. Lonely people often would become accustomed to think about many things. Some thought about too many things and would go insane, while others would see through their own heart and mind and become wise. Ning was one of those who had seen through his own heart, which made him all the more broad-minded and calm. If he hadn\u2019t seen through his own heart, how could he have had such resolve to keep training so bitterly in this life?Autumn Leaf and Mowu glanced at each other.Be true to themselves?They didn\u2019t understand!\u201cEnough.\u201d Ning saw the looks on their faces and shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t overthink it. Let\u2019s go to Serpentwing Lake.\u201d\u201cYoung master, aren\u2019t you going to the Blacktooth Tribe? Didn\u2019t you say\u2026that you wanted to help take care of the little brother of Spring Grass?\u201dAutumn Leaf asked.\u201cNo rush.\u201d Ning shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll make a trip to Serpentwing Lake first and kill Serpentwing, then head to the Blacktooth Tribe\u2026the original cause of this disastrous affair was still Serpentwing. One of Spring Grass\u2019 two little brothers died to Serpentwing as well. I will use Serpentwing\u2019s death to commemorate Spring Grass, and then I\u2019ll take her only brother to the West Prefecture City with me.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dNing rapped his black beast on its chest slightly, and it instantly began to gallop forward.Autumn Leaf and Mowu followed him towards Serpentwing Lake as well.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014They travelled by day and rested at night. Given the rapid pace at which the black beasts travelled through even mountainous terrain, they still spent three full days before arriving at a place near Serpentwing Lake.\u201cGreetings, young master.\u201dTen black armored guards fell down to one knee.Ning, seated on the black beast, nodded while instructing, \u201cMowu, Autumn Leaf, the two of you can stay here and rest for a bit. Serpentwing Lake is a few kilometers up ahead. I can\u2019t take you there. I will go to Serpentwing Lake by myself.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Mowu and Autumn Leaf were both very respectful.Ning descended from the black beast, and then, moving as agilely as a great bird, charged into the distance. With but two flashing movements, he disappeared from the field of vision of those ten black armored guards, Mowu, and Autumn Leaf. This was the first time the black armored guards had seen Ning displaying his footwork techniques, and they stared in amazement and disbelief.Serpentwing Lake was currently forbidden territory.The Ji clan had arranged for dozens of scattered little squads to be spread around the area, each of which had ten black armored guards. They were located in different areas around Serpentwing Lake, so as to keep a close watch on Serpentwing.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cHuahuahua\u2026.\u201d The hundred-kilometer long Serpentwing Lake was vast. One couldn\u2019t see the other side of the lake. Such an enormous lake would of course have three-foot high waves, even when it wasn\u2019t windy.Ning stood by the shore, staring at Serpentwing Lake. In a soft voice, he said, \u201cThis lake truly is immeasurably deep. Even though I can control water, if I were to enter its depths\u2026my speed would probably still be far inferior to Serpentwing.\u201dThe deeper one went, the greater the water pressure would be, and the harder it would be to control water.A human who was in water wouldn\u2019t even be able to bring out 10% of his power, but a water monster would be more powerful than usual.\u201cRight now, although I am powerful, compared to a peak Xiantian Diremonster\u2026most likely, I\u2019m just slightly more powerful.\u201d Ning said to himself. And this was because he trained in the [Windwing Evasion], and had gained a hint of understanding into the true nature of the Dao. After all, just by relying on the four stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] alone, he would only roughly have power comparable to other late-stage Fiendgod practitioners.Compared to Serpentwing, his power would actually be slightly lower.Swoosh!With a series of movements, Ning travelled a kilometer, walking atop the water as though it were land.\u201cSerpentwing!\u201d Ning let out a loud bellow.\u201cSerpentwing!\u201d \u201cSerpentwing!\u201d \u201cSerpentwing!\u201d \u2026.The sound echoed like thunder, spreading everywhere and piercing deep into the depths of the water of the lake.Moments later\u2026.In the depths of the sea, within a twisting, dark lair, the Diremonster, Serpentwing, was currently slumbering. His enormous scaled wings surrounded him, protecting his body.\u201cSerpentwing!\u201d A sound pierced through the water, directly arriving to him.The slumbering Serpentwing suddenly opened his scarlet eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Serpentwing let out a low growl. \u201cInvestigate immediately.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe sound of screams from terrified lesser water monsters could be heard from outside. Although humans usually weren\u2019t able to understand the languages of these lesser monsters, these lesser monsters could all understand each other.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014There were two black armored guards hiding within the wild grass fairly close to Serpentwing Lake.\u201cSerpentwing?\u201d\u201cSomeone is challenging Serpentwing.\u201d The two black armored guards exchanged glances of amazement, then hurriedly turned to look. However, they were dozens of kilometers away from Ning, and thus they couldn\u2019t see him at all.\u201cI\u2019ll keep watch. You go make the report.\u201dThere were over ten black armored guards on watch at all times around Serpentwing Lake, and right now, the three black armored guards closest to Ji Ning were all able to see him. This group of black armored guards had been dispatched from West Prefecture City. Naturally, they were able to recognize Ning.\u201cIt is young master Ji Ning.\u201d\u201cYoung master Ji Ning has come to challenge Serpentwing? But young master Ji Ning truly is powerful. He is able to stand atop the water as though it was flat ground. Just like Commander Ji Yichuan had been!\u201d\u201cStop talking. Hurry and go back to make the report.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014The amazed black armored guards quickly spread the news to all of the little squads, but given their speed\u2026as one might imagine, it would take them at least a day before they were able to reach West Prefecture City.Ning continued to walk calmly on the surface of the vast waters of Lake Serpentwing.Huahua\u2026.The head of a large green snake appeared, along with the head of a large black fish. Breaking through the surface of the water, they stared into the distance.\u201cA human youth?\u201d The two monsters exchanged glances.Hua!They both dove into the deeper water, making haste to the watery lair of the Diremonster, Serpentwing.\u201cMighty King, mighty King, there is a human youth in the water above.\u201d The green serpent monster and the black fish monster both growled out frantically.\u201cA human youth?\u201d Serpentwing\u2019s scaly wings spread out, and his scarlet eyes stared at those two lesser monsters, who were so terrified that they trembled as they nodded.\u201cBut that human youth is standing on the water, just like that Ji Yichuan had done so in the past. The water doesn\u2019t sink down at all.\u201d The green serpent monster said hurriedly, while the black fish monster also nodded. \u201cRight right right.\u201d\u201cStanding on the water without it sinking at all?\u201dSerpentwing disappeared into a black mist, then reformed into a black clothed man.The black clothed man stood there, his slender, narrow eyes filled with suspicion. Serpents were by their very nature cautious. Given that he had also been pursued and often tricked into traps on multiple occasions by the Xiantian experts of the Ji clan, he had long ago become an easily startled creature. Now, a human youth who could walk on water had suddenly come to challenge him. How could he not be suspicious?\u201cHave you seen him before?\u201d The black clothed man looked at the two lesser monsters.\u201cNever, never. Before this, we have clearly memorized the appearances of those Xiantian lifeforms surrounding our Serpentwing Lake. This human youth definitely isn\u2019t one of those Xiantian lifeforms.\u201d The green snake monster hurriedly said, and the black fish monster nodded.The black clothed man nodded. \u201cThen I will go take a look.\u201dSwoosh!He stealthily slipped out of his watery lair. Although in his human form Serpentwing wasn\u2019t nearly as fast as when he was in his true form, his true form was simply too enormous. If he appeared at the surface of the water, he would cause an enormous commotion and would definitely be noticed.\u201cWho is it?\u201d The black clothed man quickly and stealthily lifted his head out of the surface of the water to take a look around him.He immediately saw that roughly eight or nine kilometers away, there was a fur-clad youth. The youth looked very fine and delicate, but he casually walked atop the surface of the water. The area around the youth was completely barren and empty. There were no other human experts there at all.\u201cIt is him!\u201dThe black clothed man\u2019s narrow eyes instantly became filled with a terrifying, ferocious light.A murderous look!A hateful look!These feelings instantly filled his mind, causing the water around him to begin to tremble with the force of his emotions.The distant Ji Ning seemed to have sensed him, as he turned to look. Ning instantly saw him. Although Serpentwing was currently in human form, Ning immediately recognized that this was the Diremonster, Serpentwing.\u201cSerpentwing!\u201d Ning let out an angry shout.The black clothed man gave Ning a cold, sinister glance, and then sunk down slowly into the depths of the lake.\u201cSerpentwing.\u201d Ning ran over at high speed over the surface of the water, quickly arriving at that part of the lake. Staring downwards into the depths, he shouted, \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to kill me? Don\u2019t you have a hatred for me which is so deep, it is engraved into your bones? Come out, come out\u2026I am waiting here for you to come kill me.\u201dDeep within the water.The narrow eyes of the black clothed man were burning with the flames of rage. He truly was filled with an incomparable desire to fly upwards, attack, and devour the flesh of this Ji Ning.\u201cI personally killed that big crimson snake.\u201d\u201cHahaha, I killed him with a single blow. He really was pathetic!\u201d The voice from above continuously transmitted downwards, further stoking the flames of Serpentwing\u2019s rage.The black clothed man was trembling slightly, but he managed to suppress the killing urge in his mind. \u201cI can\u2019t be hasty. Can\u2019t be hasty. If I am hasty, I will fall into the Ji clan\u2019s crafty trap. Before this, Poison Dove Ridge and the Ji clan only agreed that I would be restricted from leaving Serpentwing Lake for a century, and that only the highest level members of the clan, the Zifu Disciples, would be restricted from acting. There was no agreement forbidding those Xiantian lifeforms from acting against me.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHumans and the monsters fought viciously against each other.However, there were some limits and some restrictions. For example, the true leaders of each side wouldn\u2019t act against and bully the weaker members of each side. That old monster at the Zifu level wouldn\u2019t kill\u2026and the Zifu Disciple of the Ji clan wouldn\u2019t kill either.After all, the Zifu level experts were the foundation.Once Zifu experts began to fight each other, once one fell, that would shake the very foundations of a clan. Neither humans nor monsters wanted their foundations to be shaken.\u201cThe area around that Ji Ning is empty. There are no humans there.\u201d The black clothed man\u2019s eyes flashed with a ferocious light. \u201cBut why would he come to throw his life away? Most likely, his father, Ji Yichuan, and some other Xiantian lifeforms are nearby, utilizing some sort of concealing formation technique to hide there. Once I come out, I will most likely instantly be attacked en masse.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The only sound that could be heard was that of the wind blowing atop the surface of the lake, and the waves it created.\u201cSerpentwing is even more careful and cautious than I had expected. Not only does he remain within the depths, even when I, his most hated foe, appeared, he still doesn\u2019t dare come attack me.\u201d Ning frowned.To draw Serpentwing out would be very hard!Otherwise, the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan wouldn\u2019t have been unable to do anything about Serpentwing. Ji Ning\u2019s breakthrough to the Xiantian lifeform level was still a secret, with very few people aware of it. Serpentwing naturally didn\u2019t know either. In the eyes of Serpentwing, Ning was perhaps just an eleven year old youth who had very powerful footwork techniques. He wasn\u2019t a threat, but despite that, Serpentwing still managed to curb his impulse to attack.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ning suddenly frowned.Some heads were jutting up secretly from far away in the pond.\u201cLesser monsters.\u201d Out of nowhere, that greatbow Ning had retrieved from Ironwood Zhan suddenly appeared, along with four arrows. He quickly nocked his bow and fired.Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!The four arrows instantly pierced outwards, terrifying those lesser water monsters to hurriedly dive down. But how fast were Ning\u2019s arrows? Immediately, a series of agonized howls could be heard, and even a large fish tail flapped on the surface of the water. Leaving behind only a pool of blood, the lesser monsters all hid themselves away.\u201cSerpentwing.\u201d Holding his greatbow, Ning shouted, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you, a mighty Diremonster, would be forced to the state of only daring to have those lesser monsters appear. You really make me look down upon you!\u201d\u201cJi Ning.\u201dA deep, growling voice suddenly emerged from the depths of the lake.Ning instantly felt a surge of joy in his heart. Serpentwing finally had spoken.\u201cDon\u2019t even think that you can succeed in using these despicable measures. Do you think I don\u2019t know that your father and the others are hiding nearby?\u201d The growling voice emanated from the depths. \u201cHow could you, a little child of the Houtian level, possibly have come to throw your life away?\u201d\u201cHahaha, Houtian?\u201d Ning laughed loudly. His body immediately began to be covered by a layer of hazy light, while he pointed at the surface of the lake. A sword light shot out from his fingernail, piercing straight into the depths of the lake. \u201cOpen up your serpentine eyes and take a good look!\u201dSwish!The sword light tunneled through the depths of the lake, creating tremors.\u201cHuala\u2026\u201d Several kilometers away, a black figure raised his head up, staring in his direction with eyes filled with shock. \u201cXiantian? You are already Xiantian?\u201d\u201cDare you battle me?!\u201d Ning shouted. \u201cIf you are worried that I have arranged an ambush, then you can pick any location in the lake or any island within this hundred-kilometer wide Serpentwing Lake! You and me, one on one. Dare you battle me?\u201dSerpentwing stared at the distant youth atop the water. He hesitated.Even if Ji Yichuan and his men were lying in ambush, how many places could they possibly have prepared an ambush?\u201cYou humans are incomparably crafty. Even if you, a youth, have reached the Xiantian level, how could the Ji clan possibly let you just die? There must be some scheme I don\u2019t know about.\u201d Serpentwing immediately sunk deep into the water while roaring angrily, \u201cIf you have any courage, come to the depths of the lake. I will definitely have a battle with you here. Above the water? I definitely won\u2019t fall for your tricks!\u201dNing, atop the water, cursed angrily, \u201cAs cowardly as a mouse!\u201dSwoosh!Ning was so furious that he immediately turned and left, walking atop the waves and quickly arriving on the island in the center of Serpentwing Lake. He leapt directly atop the island.\u201cHow can he be so cowardly.\u201d Ning didn\u2019t have any ideas either. He wasn\u2019t so arrogant as to head directly into the bottom of the lake to do battle with a peak Xiantian aquatic Diremonster.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-At the bottom of the lake.\u201cMighty King, mighty King, that human youth is on the island.\u201d Several lesser monsters reported.\u201cHe went to the island?\u201d The black clothed man sat there, suppressing the fury in his heart.\u201cFather, Silvertip and the others are on the island.\u201d Suddenly, a serpent called out in worry.\u201cSilvertip?\u201dThe black clothed man was instantly shocked.He remembered now. Ever since Poisondove Ridge and the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan had engaged in their negotiations, he had carefully remained beneath the water, not even daring to go to his lair on the island! But those children of his and those lesser monsters weren\u2019t as cautious. They would occasionally head to the island. After all, in the past, that island was their true home.\u201cHow many? How many of my children are on the island?\u201d The black clothed man shouted angrily.\u201cIt should just be Silvertip. But there are hundreds of lesser monsters there.\u201d The serpent immediately reported.The black clothed man\u2019s face changed greatly when he heard this. \u201cImmediately send some lesser monsters to inform Silvertip and have him immediately come back.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Ning was a human, after all. When walking atop the water, he had to maintain his mind at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level at all times. Since for now he had no way of forcing Serpentwing out, Ning headed directly to the island to take a rest.\u201cThis island used to be Serpentwing\u2019s lair in the past.\u201d Ning glanced at the surroundings. \u201cIn the past thousand years, this place has always been the territory of monsters. Since I\u2019m unable to have Serpentwing come out, then I might have a good look at this island!\u201dNing slowly walked about.Each step, however, was like the wind, as graceful and as fast as gentle smoke. He wandered about the muddy beaches of the island. The island had an area of roughly twenty kilometers. It wasn\u2019t a small one. There were some hills and creeks in the island.\u201cGrowl\u2026.\u201d From afar, a millstone-sized crimson crab was currently waving its big metal pincers, staring at Ning.\u201cLesser water monsters.\u201d Ning kicked a rock, which with a \u2018Swoosh!\u2019 shot out. Then, with a clang, it struck on the crab monster\u2019s shell, causing it to flip around multiple times before it came to a halt and stopped moving. When Ning left, the giant crab flipped over yet again, hurriedly charging back down into the depths of the lake.This used to be Serpentwing\u2019s lair was in the past, after all. Even though Serpentwing currently wasn\u2019t here, there were still quite a few lesser aquatic monsters who lived on this island. When they saw Ning, these lesser monsters wanted to attack him. The weaker monsters were taught a lesson by Ning, while when dealing with the peak Houtian monsters, Ning showed no mercy at all.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ning suddenly turned and looked into the distance. From afar, there was a great cavern entrance, from which a large silver serpent suddenly emerged. By the side of this silver serpent were a number of lesser water monsters that were many meters wide.None of those lesser monsters were physically small.Most likely, all of them were peak Houtian.\u201cSwoosh!\u201d Ning moved, instantly charged forwards.\u201cHurry and leave.\u201d\u201cLeave.\u201d\u201cThat human youth should be a Xiantian lifeform.\u201d These peak Houtian lesser monsters all growled to each other. None of them attacked Ning. Rather, they all scattered in every direction, towards the distant waters of the lake.That greatbow and four arrows appeared in Ning\u2019s hands, and he once more pulled his arrow.After firing those four arrows, he fired four more!Hua! Hua! Hua! One arrow after another shot out.Instantly, the ten physically largest Houtian lesser water monsters were all killed. Some of the smaller, weaker monsters were able to escape into the water.\u201cJi Ning, you killed yet another one of my sons. I will definitely kill you, definitely kill you!\u201d An enraged growl echoed from the depths of the lake, causing Ning, who had been preparing to enter the lair entrance, to be astonished.\u201cKilled another son? How many children does this old monster have?\u201dNing curiously swept the surrounding area with a glance. There were three Houtian-level snake-type aquatic monsters that he had killed with his arrows. Which one was Serpentwing\u2019s child? Ning didn\u2019t know that the old monster, Serpentwing, originally had 92 children, only many had been eaten by other monsters or killed by humans, with only sixteen surviving.Two more of those were then killed by Ning.However, to Serpentwing\u2026the one he was the most devoted to was still Redtip, the one which had Fiendgod heritage.\u201cOld monster Serpentwing, all you can do is shout out verbally. Does this lair of yours have any more children within it? I\u2019m going to go in and kill them.\u201d Ning called out as he entered the lair.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-This lair was a place where Serpentwing had lived for a thousand years. It was dark inside, with twisting paths.Ning moved forward, his Darknorth swords at the ready.Within the lair, he repeatedly encountered some aquatic monsters who charged at him. Some were ferocious, others were bizarre. As soon as they saw this human youth, it was as though they had seen a delicacy which they all wanted to devour. For some of the extremely weak lesser monsters, Ning would just knock them flying\u2026whether they died as a result or just fainted, he didn\u2019t bother with them further.But Ning still exterminated all of the peak Houtian aquatic monsters.\u201cThis lair truly is infathomably deep.\u201d Ning continued going deeper into the twisting tunnels of the lair. Suddenly, within the dark tunnels, a blurry, enormous beast shadow appeared in the shape of the head of a giant grizzly. This enormous shadow of a grizzly head seemed to open its mouth wide, trapping Ning within.Ning\u2019s face changed dramatically.At the same time, he discovered that he was now completely incapable of movement. He could neither advance, nor retreat.\u201cThis, this\u2026is a relic site!\u201d Ning instantly thought of this term.In the boundless world, from the Fiendgod era to the modern era, countless numbers of experts had existed throughout the countless years. There were thus an uncountable number of Fiendgod relic sites and Immortal mansion relic sites throughout the land. Since humankind was spread across the entire world, people would often accidentally enter some ancient Fiendgod relic sites, some of whom would be able to gain some benefits from these places.Most, however, died within these Immortal relic sites and Fiendgod relic sites. In just the books which Ning had read, there were many famous ancient relic sites that had devoured countless creatures.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI actually encountered a relic site. Live. I will definitely make it out alive. Definitely!\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes were filled with incomparable desire. He understood that in the face of these ancient relic sites of great powers and Fiendgods, he, a mere Xiantian, had no chance to fight back at all. His only choice was to submit to it, and then later try to come up with a way to escape.The enormous shadow of a grizzly bear head swallowed Ning with one gulp.The shadow vanished.Ning vanished as well.The tunnels within Serpentwing\u2019s lair remained as calm and peaceful as ever, as though nothing had happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14 \u2013 Aquatic ManorJi Ning could sense spacetime changing. It was similar to the feeling he had when he had jumped into the Six Paths of Reincarnation.A heartbeat later, everything calmed down again.\u201cThis place\u2026\u201d Ning hurriedly inspected his surroundings. He himself was in a large, wide corridor that was three hundred meters tall and three hundred meters wide. When Ning turned to look behind him, he was greatly shocked. Behind him was the exit to this corridor, but the outside was covered with a vast, endless amount of water. The water, however, was completely unable to enter this corridor, as though some sort of invisible screen was blocking out the water.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Ning carefully stepped over, an arrow appearing in his hand. He sent it piercing directly towards the water.Chi!The arrow collided with an invisible barrier. No matter how he tried, he couldn\u2019t pierce through.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Ning hurriedly took ten steps back, then took out that \u2018Jia Yong\u2019 greatbow. Letting out a soft snort, his entire body began to be covered with a crimson red light. Clearly, the Fiendgod energy was being completely released. Pulling the bow into a near circle, he immediately shot out an arrow, which flew like a ray of light towards that invisible barrier.The arrow was shattered to pieces, falling to the ground.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Ning frowned, carefully inspecting this corridor yet again.\u201cThe corridor alone is three hundred meters tall.\u201d Ning looked through the invisible barrier into the boundless water outside. \u201cThis building is definitely astonishingly large, at least multiple kilometers across. And it was built underwater\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it at the bottom of Serpentwing Lake?\u201d Ning shook his head.Serpentwing Lake was only a lake with an area of a hundred square kilometers. It would be quite hard for such an enormous structure to fit within it. Most likely, if it was in Serpentwing Lake, the Ji clan would have discovered it long ago.\u201cJust then, I had the sense of spacetime twisting, as though creating a tunnel in space.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve entered a separate dimension.\u201dAfter having read many books, he knew many things.The books had recorded that in the countless years of time\u2019s passage, some powerful Immortals or powerful Fiendgods were able to create their own little dimensions. A single grain of sand might store an entire world of its own! Some Immortal estate relic sites or Fiendgod relic sites were located in these small dimensions and small worlds. Normally, it was impossible to find them. Only by luck or misfortune would one accidentally enter.However, these estates left behind by these great powers were all extremely dangerous. After all, how could the Immortals and Fiendgods not leave behind some defensive mechanisms? The vast majority of those who entered relic sites would die. If one was able to stay alive and flee, that would already be a stroke of luck. As for those legends of people who were able to actually obtain treasures from within, Ning didn\u2019t even dare think of that?\u201cCan\u2019t be greedy! I just need to work hard to stay alive and escape.\u201d Ning carefully inspected his surroundings.The unknown represented opportunity.But it also represented enormous risks!\u201cThis underwater estate\u2026for now, I\u2019ll call it the Serpentwing Aquatic Manor.\u201d Ning casually picked a name for it. Since for now he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave this corridor, he might as well head in.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013The corridor was wide and tall, and the floor seemed to be made from a single massive slab. Ning tried everything he could think of, yet still was unable to leave a single mark on the walls.After walking a short while.The corridor turned, and Ning\u2019s eyes narrowed. From afar, he saw one white skeleton after another, littering the floor. The flesh on these skeletons had rotted away long ago, but the strange thing was, there were very few magic treasures on the ground. Only some of the most distant, most complete skeletons on the far left still had some armor, weapons, and magic treasures near them.\u201cThe other corpses don\u2019t have magic treasures?\u201d Ning was suspicious. \u201cEven if they don\u2019t have magic treasures, they should at least have some sharp weapons. How could they not have a single one?\u201d\u201cSwoosh!\u201dWith a thought, Ning sent his divine will outwards, picking up all of those skeletons with armors and weapons and depositing them in front of him.Swish.As soon as they landed on the ground, the skeletons instantly shattered.\u201cIt seems they died long ago.\u201d Ning glanced at the armor and weapons. He immediately picked them up and began to use his Xiantian ki to attempt to bind them, but as he did so, he discovered\u2026because the previous owners had died too long ago, two of the magic treasures didn\u2019t have any magic power within them. Thus, Ning was easily able to bind them.\u201cEven I can bind them. It seems these are only unranked magic treasures.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cIt seems the dead only had Xiantian level power.\u201dAnd then, Ning began to inspect the various corpses. He quickly noticed a ring on one of the corpse\u2019s fingers. He immediately picked up the ring and began to bind it. Indeed\u2026this ring was the dead person\u2019s storage-type magic treasure. Taking a casual glance inside this storage magic treasure, Ning was greatly shocked. The space inside it wasn\u2019t that great, somewhat smaller than Ironwood Zhan\u2019s.But\u2026\u201cSo many magic treasures.\u201d Ning was astonished. Within this storage magic treasure, one magic treasure was floating after another, all possessing extraordinary auras. There were weapons, formation treasures, armor, and even more storage treasures.\u201cWhy would a single person need to carry this many magic treasures?\u201d Ning glanced at the many corpses in the distance, none of which had magic treasures on them. \u201cMost likely, this person had collected the magic treasures of all the others.\u201dNing quickly began to bind them.As he started binding them, he discovered\u2026this storage ring had a total of 112 storage-type magic treasures, 136 weapon-type magic treasures, 31 armor-type magic treasures, and 16 bizarre magic treasures, including formation-types. There were quite a few Dao-seals as well, but unfortunately, too much time had passed, and the magic power within the Dao-seals had all leaked out. Only ten or so Dao-seals were still somewhat serviceably usable.\u201cIf I\u2019m able to bind them, then these are all unranked magic treasures.\u201d Ning murmured. \u201cThe previous owners of these magic treasures were all Xiantian lifeforms. In other words, everyone who came to this tunnel in the past were all Xiantian lifeforms.\u201dNing selected one of the storage-type magic treasures that had a storage space of nearly three hundred meters, a storage belt, and wrapped it around his waist. This storage belt, on the surface, looked like it was nothing more than a sturdy, plain belt. Ning then selected an excellent armor, binding it and then wearing it over his skin.This armor was far more powerful than the Goldstar Shirt. The Goldstar Shirt was thus decommissioned, and Ning stored it away.Actually, these magic treasures didn\u2019t make Ning particularly overjoyed. After all, he was the next Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. He would easily be able to obtain protective treasures.\u201cHowever, the number is quite great. All together, the value is probably comparable to a low-ranked magic treasure.\u201d Ning didn\u2019t think about it any longer. The fellow in front of him had also acquired many magic treasures, but in the end, he had also died. What mattered was escaping with his life.Wielding his two Darknorth swords, Ning carefully made his way forward. After all, there was no other path he could take. His only choice was to advance!In terms of power, the Darknorth swords weren\u2019t inferior to these unranked magic treasures. In addition, he didn\u2019t have to use any Xiantian ki in order to use them. Naturally, Ning would prefer to keep using his Darknorth swords.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Ning stepped forward carefully.As he walked past those skeletons, he became even more cautious. Suddenly\u2026PA! PA! PA! PA! PA! PA! PA!One golden pea after another suddenly appeared out of thin air. Many golden peas appeared in the surrounding area, all of which let out a clear ringing sound as they hit the floor. And then, these golden peas quickly began to melt, transforming into a golden liquid, each drop of which then quickly transformed into weapon-wielding, golden-armored celestial warriors.Flashing with golden light, the incomparably dazzling, powerful celestial warriors and celestial generals stood around him.\u201cGrowing soldiers from peas?\u201d Ning was stunned. At the same time, he could sense that these golden-armored celestial warriors all had powerful auras. He could sense they were all at the Xiantian level of power. \u201cAnd there\u2019s eighty one of them?\u201d\u201cYou who dare trespass in the manor, prepare to die!\u201d The eighty one golden-armored celestial warriors shouted in unison, and then they charged over and attacked.The two Darknorth swords in his hands, Ning instantly understood everything. Those skeletons had most likely been killed by those eighty one golden armored soldiers. Not hesitating at all, Ning instantly began to utilize the Windwing Evasion technique. With a \u2018Swoosh\u2019 sound, he ran across the side of the walls of the corridor like a giant Roc in flight, instantly passing through those eighty one golden armored soldiers and wanting to continue forward.\u201cFormation, activate!\u201d The eighty one golden armored warriors shouted in unison.Instantly, at two sides of the corridor, a hazy mist arose. As Ning charged into the mist, he shot out with his sword, but was unable to pierce into it even slightly.\u201cDon\u2019t even think of escaping.\u201d The eighty one golden armored warriors charged over once again.\u201cA Trap Formation?\u201dNing looked at the two hazy mists. \u201cIt seems if I don\u2019t kill these eighty one golden armored soldiers, I won\u2019t be able to continue. Those fellows all died, but I\u2019m not as weak as them.\u201dSwoosh!Ning utilized the Windwing Evasion technique, once again running across the surface of the corridor at high speed until he arrived behind the golden armored soldiers, and then he stabbed directly at one of those soldiers.\u201cDang, dang, dang!\u201d Three sword blows at once.Bang!Ning pierced through the head of that golden armored soldier, but the soldier still stabbed backwards with his spear.\u201cWhat.\u201d Ning was so frightened, he hurriedly jumped back in retreat.\u201cEven a Xiantian level Fiendgod Body Refiner stabbed through the head would definitely die. How could this golden armored soldier not die?\u201d Ning instantly grew frantic. Just then, in that short exchange, he had discovered that the spearcraft of that golden armored soldier could only be considered at the \u2018advanced\u2019 level, but in terms of strength, it was no lower than Ning\u2019s.The worst part of it was\u2026not even stabbing through the soldier\u2019s head had done anything.\u201cKill!\u201d Ning\u2019s stabbing blow through that soldier\u2019s head seemed to have truly infuriated these golden armored soldiers, who all began to bellow angrily and wildly attack him en masse.Ning utilized his footwork, moving through the attacking golden armored soldiers. At every moment, he was dealing with three separate opponents. By relying on his twin Darknorth swords, he stabbed through the throat, skull, and various other fatal points of the golden armored guards, but the golden armored guards remained undamaged.\u201cWaterflame Lotus!\u201d Ning was frantic.Huahuahua\u2026.In the area around Ning, three enormous lotus petals of fire and three enormous lotus petals of water appeared, surrounding him in every direction. The two layers of lotus petals were slowly swiveling in opposite directions. Instantly, six of the golden armored soldiers who were within the range of the Waterflame Lotus became crushed by the pressure of the Waterflame Lotus back into liquid form.But the golden liquid quickly flowed outside the range of the Waterflame Lotus, then once more reformed into six Golden Armored Soldiers.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Ning, seeing the situation, couldn\u2019t believe it. They had already been dissolved; how could they reform?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that the previous Xiantian lifeforms were too weak; it was that these eighty one golden armored soldiers are completely unkillable.\u201d Ning clearly found himself at a loss for how he should deal with these eighty one golden armored soldiers. After all, even after they were crushed, they simply liquefied then returned into human form.\u201cKill!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe six golden armored guards which had been crushed seemed to have caused these golden armored guards to be even angrier.\u201cPrepare the formation!\u201d The eighty one golden armored soldiers shouted angrily in unison. All of these golden armored guards flew out at high speed, quickly completely surrounding Ji Ning.These golden armored guards formed into two circles, an inner circle and an outer one. The inner circle had twenty seven golden armored guards, while the other one had fifty four, all of them pointing their spears at Ning and staring at him angrily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15 \u2013 The Full StoryThe twenty seven golden armored soldiers simultaneously stabbed out with their glittering golden spears, carrying boundless force as they attacked Ji Ning! The fifty four golden armored soldiers behind also simultaneously aimed their spears, preparing to swap in at any moment.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a flaw. There definitely is a chance for success. If they truly are immortal, then they would exhaust me to death through by using up my energy.\u201d Wielding the Darknorth swords in his hands, Ning charged forward, as fast as the wind. Dangdangdang! The Darknorth sword and the spears clashed. Ning blocked the spears while at the same time, charging into the midst of those golden armored soldiers.\u201cRetreat!\u201d\u201cAttack!\u201dThe twenty seven golden armored soldiers in the center retreated in unison at high speed, while the fifty four golden armored soldiers then formed an even wider encirclement, allowing Ning to be the \u2018turtle in their jar\u2019.\u201cCan it be?\u201d Ning suddenly frowned.\u201cWaterflame Lotus!\u201d Ning made his decision.Huahuahua\u2026.Around him eight pairs of Waterflame Lotuses suddenly appeared, each one created from a single water lotus petal and a single fire lotus petal. Because this attack contained a hint of the true meaning of the Dao, even Ning had to use his full force when utilizing this attack, and dividing his mind to the point of creating these eight Waterflame Lotuses was extremely arduous for him.\u201cKakaka\u2026\u201d The eight Waterflame Lotuses swiveled, grinding like millstones while surrounding sixteen golden armored soldiers. These golden armored soldiers all frantically dodged, but all of their bodies began to crack from the tremendous pressure.\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe golden armored warriors howled angrily, bellowing as they dodged past the Waterflame Lotuses and attacked Ning.Ning, wielding his Darknorth swords, was like a vicious tiger. His sword shadow danced like fire, instantly chopping one of the golden armored warriors into three pieces. But the body of the warrior who was chopped into three pieces quickly then reconnected and reformed, then once more bellowed and attacked Ning.\u201cSo this really is the case. This really is the case.\u201d Ning was jubilant, and he laughed loudly. \u201cWhat nonsense about these golden armored warriors having \u2018immortal bodies\u2019. That\u2019s just for frightening people. Every time I injure you, your power goes down. Haha. I want to see how long you can hold on for.\u201dPreviously, when the eighty one golden armored guards had set up their formation attacks, Ning, when blocking, had discovered that the power of these golden armored guards had dropped slightly. Although it wasn\u2019t by much, Ning\u2019s senses were extremely sensitive, so he was still able to discover it.Thus, Ning simultaneously created eight Waterflame Lotuses, badly injuring those sixteen golden armored warriors.After exchanging blows with them again, Ning discovered\u2026that the power of these golden armored warriors had weakened considerably.\u201cThe eighty one golden armored warriors are like a single unit. If one is badly wounded, the others will be affected as well.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cIn addition, these golden armored warriors are made from golden liquid. They don\u2019t have any \u2018vital points\u2019 to speak of. As long as I constantly injure them, their magical power will constantly deplete\u2026and in the end, they will definitely collapse.\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe golden armored warriors were utterly fearless.Ning continued to control the eight Waterflame Lotuses, causing them to surround and grind down against the golden armored warriors repeatedly, while at the same time he himself constantly dodged with his Darknorth swords\u2026Ning discovered that each time, when he stabbed the golden armored warriors with his swords, their power dropped very slowly. However, when the Waterflame Lotuses ground them to pieces, the power would drop somewhat faster.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-This was a war of attrition.\u201cSwish!\u201d One golden armor warrior shattered and fell apart, transforming into nothingness. Then all eighty one golden armored warriors completely disappeared.Ning let out a long breath, releasing his nearby Waterflame Lotuses.\u201cToo\u2026too troublesome.\u201d\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have the Waterflame Lotus technique, I probably would\u2019ve been exhausted to death.\u201d Sensing the remaining \u2018Crimsonbright\u2019 divine power in his body, Ning couldn\u2019t help but sigh. The Crimsonbright divine power in his body only had roughly half left. And this was only because the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] technique he trained in resulted in an extraordinarily dense base of power.This battle had primarily relied upon Ning using the Waterflame Lotus to grind them into small pieces repeatedly, while he had only utilized the Crimsonbright divine power in his Darknorth swords to defend! Despite that, half of his divine power had been used up.Ning glanced behind him, seeing those corpses lying on the ground. Some of them had been transformed into dust from the battle, but a few still remained.\u201cThose that died here were most likely exhausted to death.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cFiendgod Body Refiners are proficient at long-lasting, endurance battles, but I still found it so hard. How could those who relied solely upon Ki Refining to reach the Xiantian level possibly survive?\u201dHua\u2026The two walls of mist at each side of the tunnel slowly dissipated.Ning carefully made his way towards the corner of the corridor, not going forward yet. He instead took a glance towards the other side, and saw that far away, on the other side of the corridor, there were corpses present as well.\u201cThere\u2019s even more corpses. It seems the next corridor is just as dangerous. I really wonder how many dangers this ancient relic site contains within it.\u201d Ning\u2019s heart shivered. \u201cAnd most likely, those who died there had successfully passed through those eighty one golden armored soldiers.\u201d\u201cCome.\u201dNing stared at those corpses on the other side of the hall. He realized that here as well, only a few of the corpses had armor and weapons on them. He used his divine will to pull one of the corpses and its magic treasures over to himself.\u201cThose who were able to break through the previous corridor most likely had quite some magic treasures.\u201d Ning carefully inspected the skeleton. The large skeleton was more than three meters tall. The most likely location of its storage treasure was on the armguard covering its skeletal arm. Ning quickly removed the armguard and bound it. \u201cIt really is a storage-type magic treasure.\u201d\u201cSo many things.\u201dThis storage-type magic treasure had more than a thousand magic treasures within it. Ning easily bound all of them, but he discovered to his resignation\u2026that all of them were unranked magic treasures.\u201cAll of them are unranked.\u201d Ning shook his head. \u201cAlthough there\u2019s more than a thousand, all of them combined are worth perhaps less than 1% of the Traceless Talisman.\u201dThe Traceless Talisman was a guardian treasure of the Prefecture!Even ranked magic treasures would find it difficult to compare to it.\u201cTake a rest first.\u201d Ning sat in the lotus position. Taking out a bamboo tube, he opened the cork, raised his head, and drank it. Then he took out some roast meat and began to eat. \u201cAlthough these old fellows who died left behind their storage treasures, they didn\u2019t leave behind any food at all. It has been too long. Their food became dust long ago.\u201d\u201cThese unranked magic treasures aren\u2019t very useful to me either.\u201d\u201cAfter all, I only need a few magic treasures.\u201d Ning shook his head. For example, storage-type magic treasures; what was the point of having several hundred? Would he gain any extra power at all? If he wasn\u2019t able to survive, most likely the thousand-plus unranked magic treasures he had found would in turn be discovered in the future by someone else.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Ning sat there, eating and drinking, not in a rush to go forward.At the same time, the Crimsonbright divine power slowly began to recover.After eating and drinking, Ning then flipped through each storage-type magic treasure to see what was inside. Occasionally, he saw some training manuals or sword technique manuals. However, the most important ultimate technique books were generally destroyed after being learned, to prevent them from being leaked to others! Thus, these books which had been brought were all quite ordinary, not very valuable.Only a single copy was comparable to the [Raindrop Sutra].\u201cI suppose this is an unexpected benefit.\u201d Ning laughed. And then he once more began to flip through the large number of storage-type magic treasures, searching through them.Clothes!Utensils!Toys!All sorts of curiosities were removed. During the treasure searching process, Ning\u2019s mood improved greatly as well.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ning suddenly picked up a strange piece of bark. He was about to toss it, but then he saw the words atop it. His face immediately changed.\u201d\u201cWudan, our clan just received word that Immortal Juhua, someone who has lived for millions of years, ever since the Fiendgod era, has publicly announced that he is accepting disciples. Although Immortal Juhua is a Loose Immortal, for him to be able to survive millions of years and undergo countless tribulations without dying means, according to our clan leader, his power is not inferior to that of a Celestial Immortal.Immortal Juhua has never before accepted a disciple. Not even the Second Prince of our Grand Xia Dynasty was able to successfully become his disciple.The news that Immortal Juhua is accepting a disciple has been spread long ago.In addition, Immortal Juhua has also said publicly that the student he is accepting must be a Fiendgod Body Refiner, who at least must be at the Xiantian level, and at most can be of the Zifu level! He would set down two paths\u2026one for Xiantian lifeforms to traverse, while the other is for Zifu Disciples to traverse.There are three trials in each path!After breaking through the three trials without dying, one would become the heir to Immortal Juhua!Immortal Juhua will only accept a single disciple!As for the place he is accepting a disciple, Immortal Juhua has set his immortal estate down in the Thousand Autumns Island of the Darknorth Sea. Most likely, he will only leave after recruiting his disciple. Traveling from our place to the distant Darknorth Ocean\u2019s Thousand Autumns Island will take at least half a year. Make haste. If you are late, someone else will seize the opportunity. Wudan, I\u2019ve given you the news. Whether you go or not is your decision.Signed, Godbanian Water!\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Looking at this incomparably ancient tree bark in his hands, Ning couldn\u2019t breath. \u201cGodbanian clan? This tree bark should be the bark of a Godbanian tree. No wonder this ancient letter was able to persist for so long.\u201dThe Godbanian tree was immortal and would never decay.Some precious items would generally be put in wooden cases made out of Godbanian wood. Godbanian trees were the unique products of the \u2018Godbanian clan\u2019, and it was their proof of identity. That was a truly incomparably powerful clan, unspeakably more powerful than the Ji clan. That was a clan that could be described as supreme, even thoughout the entirety of the vast domain of the Grand Xia Dynasty!\u201cImmortal Juhua?\u201d Ning frowned, pondering. \u201cImmortal Juhua was accepting a disciple. He existed in the Fiendgod Era, and had been alive for millions of years when he started looking for a disciple. But from the Fiendgod Era until now, it has probably been billions or trillions of years.\u201d\u201cFar too much time has passed since this \u2018seeking a disciple\u2019 affair. That Immortal Juhua most likely died long ago.\u201d Ning understood.Loose Immortals would constantly undergo the Three Calamities and the Nine Tribulations. It was a miracle for a person to survive millions of years without dying. How could one possibly have survived to this era?\u201cThen this underground estate\u2026\u201d\u201cIt should be the underground estate where Immortal Juhua tested potential disciples. This corridor that I am currently in should be one of the two corridors for his potential disciples.\u201d Ning said to himself.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing looked at the distant corpses.Although those corpses were clearly of Fiendgod Body Refiners, the fact that they still remained meant that they didn\u2019t die too long ago.Clearly, Xiantian-level or Zifu Disciples who were Fiendgod Body Refiners often were transported into this Immortal estate. He himself was one of those unlucky souls.\u201cSince Immortal Juhua decided to take an apprentice, the requirements for his apprentice must have been extremely strict. Otherwise, he would have easily accepted a disciple long ago.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cThere are three trials on each path. It seems that was the first trial just now, which forced me to rely on the Waterflame Lotuses in order to pass through it. The next two trials will most likely be even more terrifying and dangerous\u2026how will I past them?\u201d\u201cCan it be that I will be like them? That I will die and rot here?\u201d Ning looked at the distant corpses, not breathing as he pondered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16 \u2013 The Waiting ParentsWithin West Prefecture City.\u201cYichuan, I heard Ji Ning has already broken through to the Xiantian level. Congratulations!\u201d\u201cYichuan, your son really is formidable.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s only eleven this year, right? A Xiantian at eleven. He ranks amongst the top three talents of the past thousand years for our Ji clan\u2019s Five Prefectures.\u201dJi Yichuan, who had always been like an implacable glacier, had a rare hint of delight on his face. Although he was still stiff-faced, those who were familiar with him could sense how happy Yichuan currently was. Ever since Ning had kicked down the walls of the Riverside Tribe with three kicks, then knocked River Sansi flying with another kick, the news had quickly spread back to the Ji clan.This news had already spread across all five of the prefectures of the Ji clan. As his father, Ji Yichuan naturally felt very happy in his heart. The past two days, he often heard words of praise and congratulations. By nature, people liked to praise the praiseworthy even further. Now that Ning had already been selected to be the next Prefecture Lord, and also was so monstrous as to become a Xiantian lifeform at age eleven, everyone understood that in the future, the lineage of Ji Yichuan and Ji Ning would be incomparably glorious.This father-son duo\u2019s status in the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan would undoubtedly be extremely high.\u201cLook at how happy you are.\u201d Yuchi Snow held a flask of water as she watered the flowers.\u201cHow can I not be jubilant?\u201d Yichuan sat on a nearby stone bench. Flipping his hand, he retrieved a bamboo flask, contentedly drinking fruit wine. \u201cNing was able to kill the Aquatic Rhino King before reaching the Xiantian level. Now that he has broken through to the Xiantian level\u2026he was able to send that Riverside Sansi flying with one kick. River Sansi reached the Xiantian level long ago, and is an expert Ki Refiner of the middle Xiantian level, yet he couldn\u2019t take a single blow from my son. This means that Ning should have reached the Xiantian level in the Fiendgod Body Refining methods as well!\u201dAccording to the news from the black armored guards stationed at the Riverside Tribe, Ning had executed sword flashes to send River He\u2019s shortsword flying.Clearly, Ning had already reached the Xiantian level as a Ki Refiner.But Yichuan knew his son very well, and knew the weaknesses in his son\u2019s arteries. Most likely only after the Fiendgod Body Refining technique raised him to be a Xiantian level and remade his body would Ning be able to make a breakthrough as a Ki Refiner.\u201c[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].\u201d Yichuan looked at Snow. \u201cThis is the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. The legendary number one Fiendgod Body Refining method! Our Ji clan has never had someone break through to the Xiantian level through it, but Ning accomplished it. In the future, he will definitely be even more powerful than me. His name will be spread throughout the countless tribes, and our Ji clan will become greater and greater!\u201dYichuan was filled with a heroic vigor right now.\u201cThe Ji clan will become greater?\u201d Snow nodded gently. \u201cPerhaps because of my son, the Ji clan will reach the same heights of glory as my Yuchi clan once had, but sadly, my Yuchi clan\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no clan that will exist forever without perishing.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cEven the almighty Grand Xia Dynasty which has existed for countless years, ever since being founded during the Fiendgod Era, exterminated other ancient dynasties before unifying this land. Those ancient dynasties had their own extremely long history as well. Weren\u2019t they destroyed in the end also?\u201dYuchi Snow nodded. \u201cI understand. I\u2019ve already made my peace with this. In Ning\u2019s veins also flows the blood of my Yuchi lineage. In the future, when Ning\u2019s name is known throughout the boundless earth, my ancestors of the Yuchi clan will feel very happy as well, no doubt.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Yichuan nodded.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Just as the husband and wife couple were chatting happily, the face of Ji Yichuan, who had been drinking wine from the bamboo tube, suddenly changed. This was the moment where Ning, at Serpentwing\u2019s lair, had suddenly been transported into that mysterious, ancient underwater estate relic site.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Seated next to him, Yuchi Snow noticed that her man\u2019s mood had dramatically changed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Yichuan shook his head. \u201cOnly, I just remembered something I have to do.\u201dSnow frowned. \u201cYou want to deceive me? Your face is completely incapable of fakery. Given your mental willpower, normal matters aren\u2019t able to cause you to panic\u2026and for you to panic to this degree, this must be a major event. Speak.\u201dLooking at his wife, Yichuan sighed, \u201cI originally gave Ning a jade sword. No matter how far away he is, I\u2019ll be able to sense Ning\u2019s location. I had warned him quite strictly that he is not permitted to wander more than ten thousand kilometers away from the West Prefecture City. If he goes beyond it, I will capture him, bring him back, and put him in the prison for three years.\u201d\u201cWhat, he went more than ten thousand kilometers away from West Prefecture City?\u201d Snow hurriedly asked.\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d Yichuan\u2019s face was unpleasant. \u201cI can\u2019t sense the jade sword at all.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Snow, shocked, suddenly rose to her feet, then began to cough, cough very hard.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to say it, but you forced me to.\u201d Yichuan hurriedly helped support his wife, rubbing her back. \u201cFeel better?\u201dSnow said frantically, \u201cHow can you not be able to sense the jade sword? Didn\u2019t you say that you can sense it no matter how far away it is? If you can\u2019t sense it\u2026does that mean Ning has encountered danger?!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t panic.\u201d Yichuan said hurriedly. \u201cThere\u2019s two possible answers for why I can\u2019t sense the jade sword.\u201d\u201cThe first possibility is that Ning has encountered some danger, and then took out the jade sword, but before he was able to break it, the enemy instantly disintegrated the jade sword.\u201d\u201cThe second possibility is that Ning was instantly transported to a very distant location, so distant that even I can\u2019t sense it.\u201dSnow calmed down.Snow was very experienced as well, and she nodded. \u201cEven if your jade sword was destroyed and broken into small pieces, you should still be able to sense it. Unless it was completely disintegrated; only then would you be unable to sense it. But right now, Ning is very strong. He was able to send River Sansi flying with one kick. If he encountered such great danger that he had to take out the jade sword\u2026he would be able to break it instantly. How could it be that he wouldn\u2019t even have the opportunity to break it?\u201d\u201cIn addition, if an enemy wanted to kill Ning, but was capable of instantly destroying the jade sword in Ning\u2019s hands before Ning had a chance to break it, then he would have the power to easily kill Ning. Why bother with breaking the jade sword?\u201dSnow\u2019s train of thought helped her calm down slightly.Logically speaking, her son shouldn\u2019t have died yet!\u201cSo it\u2019s the other possibility.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cNing was instantly transported to an incomparably distant location. I can sense my jade sword no matter where it is\u2026although this is a slight exaggeration, within an area of a million kilometers, at least, I should still be able to sense it. To instantly be transported more than a million kilometers is rather inconceivable as well. I think the more likely answer is that Ning should have been transported to another dimension. He stumbled into a relic site.\u201d\u201cStumbled into a relic site?\u201d Snow nodded as well.The two of them had adventured in the outside world, and had significant experience. They knew that this vast, boundless world was incomparably marvelous. The relic sites that were left behind from the Fiendgod era alone were uncountable in number. Some of those greater powers were capable of opening their own small dimension or small world.\u201cWhere was the last place you sensed Ning\u2019s at?\u201d Snow asked hurriedly.\u201cSerpentwing Lake!\u201d Yichuan said.\u201cLet\u2019s go to Serpentwing\u2026cough!\u201d Snow started to cough again.Yichuan said hurriedly, \u201cI\u2019ll go. You can\u2019t go out yet.\u201d\u201cNing is in danger. How can I not go?\u201d Yuchi shook her head. \u201cYou know this stems from the illness that I had when I was pregnant with Ning. It\u2019s fine.\u201dSeeing the look in his wife\u2019s eyes, Yichuan could only nod. \u201cFine. We\u2019ll go find Aunty Flower and borrow her Azure Firebird. We\u2019ll head to Serpentwing Lake at full speed.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014The vast Serpentwing Lake was very calm.A godlike husband and wife couple were currently standing atop the back of an enormous Azure Firebird, flying at high speed in the air towards Serpentwing Lake.\u201cHurry up and report to the great King that Ji Yichuan has come again. He brought a woman as well.\u201d\u201cJi Yichuan.\u201d\u201cAnd sitting on that Azure Firebird.\u201dSome of the lesser aquatic monsters glanced into the sky, then, terrified, hurriedly went to make their report.On the back of that Azure Firebird, Yichuan and his wife exchanged glances. Soon, Yichuan pointed at a nearby shoreline. \u201cThere are black armored guards there. Azure Firebird, go there!\u201d The Azure Firebird hurriedly flew towards that direction, and the two black armored guards that had been keeping watch on the shores of Serpentwing Lake stared in astonishment at the male and female atop the back of the distant Azure Firebird.\u201cOur respects to you, Commander!\u201d The two black armored guards hurriedly fell to one knee in terror. They all recognized Yichuan.\u201cI ask you, have you seen my son, Ning?\u201d Yichuan asked directly.\u201cWe saw him.\u201d One of them, the taller black armored guard, immediately replied. \u201cJust now, young master Ji Ning was walking atop the surface of the lake, calling out for Serpentwing to come and do battle with him.\u201d\u201cSerpentwing?\u201dYichuan and Snow both had the same thought. However, they didn\u2019t believe that their son, at his current level of power, wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to break the jade sword when fighting against the Diremonster, Serpentwing. In fact, they even believed that Ning was fully capable of staying alive in the face of Serpentwing\u2019s attacks.\u201cBut this time, the Diremonster, Serpentwing, wasn\u2019t willing to come out.\u201d The black armored guard said. \u201cYoung master Ji Ning called him out to do battle multiple times. His voice echoed across the entire lake, and most likely the black armored guards in the other areas all heard it as well. But because Serpentwing still refused to come out, nothing happened. We were too far away, so as to where young master Ji Ning went afterwards while walking on water, we don\u2019t know.\u201dThe island was located in the center of Serpentwing Lake.The distance from the shore to the island was tens of kilometers. At the distance of tens of kilometers, the black armored guards were not able to see Ning at all.\u201cOh? You are certain they didn\u2019t do battle?\u201d Yichuan quickly asked.\u201cThey didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t hear anything at all.\u201d The two black armored guards were absolutely certain.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Yichuan went to the other black armored guards to ask them these questions, and even sought out Autumn Leaf and Mowu, who were waiting at the designated meeting point. From these two, Yichuan understood that Ning had come in anger, intending to execute Serpentwing, but Serpentwing had remained in hiding and hadn\u2019t come out\u2026Ning had remained standing atop the water, and then walked off and disappeared!\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d Standing by the lakeside, Yichuan and Snow stared towards the vast lake, frowning in concern.\u201cWife, what do you think?\u201d Yichuan looked at his wife.Snow said pensively, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any disturbance at all. It shouldn\u2019t have been a battle. It\u2019s very possible that it really was an ancient relic site! These relic sites might be in the middle of an empty area, only sealed off from us by a thin barrier, but we can\u2019t see them or sense them at all.\u201d\u201cPerhaps our son is within a world that is hidden within a single speck of sand at the bottom of Serpentwing Lake.\u201d\u201cOr perhaps he is within an ancient, hidden formation.\u201d\u201cOnly, the two of us aren\u2019t capable of dealing with any of these possibilities.\u201d Snow shook her head. \u201cAll we can do is wait. Wait for our son to come back to us, alive.\u201d\u201cRight. Wait.\u201d Yichuan looked at the immeasurably vast lake as well. \u201cI believe our son will come from afar, walking across the water back to us.\u201dSnow nodded gently, leaning against her man.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThey were still waiting. Waiting for their son\u2019s return.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Within the corridor of the aquatic estate, it was very dark. It felt that even the passage of time was slow here.Ning, his divine power fully recovered, finally stood up. Staring at the other corner of the corridor and its corpses, he understood that he had nowhere to retreat to. If he wanted to leave, he had to go forward!\u201cI have to live.\u201d Ning stared at those distant corpses, then walked over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17 \u2013 Dao Battle-ArmorWielding a Darknorth sword in each hand, Ji Ning headed straight towards the center of this ancient corridor.Suddenly, a thousand or so meters in front of him, several blackish-blue seeds appeared at the same time, four ahead of him, five behind him. These seeds appeared at the same time as nine sets of battle armor. The battle armors were all completely black, and the weapons were identical as well; long staffs that were seemingly made of stone.Nine seeds. Nine sets of battle gear.\u201cHua\u2026\u201d The blackish-blue seeds suddenly transformed into a liquid, flowing into the armors, then transforming into massive men with blackish-blue skin. These massive men were several meters tall and had two horns in their foreheads. Their faces were ugly, and they had sharp fangs in their mouths. They donned the armor, while simultaneously picking up those three-meter long stone staffs next to them.The nine ugly giants all glanced at each other, their eyes filled with savagery and excitement.\u201cIt\u2019s been so long. We\u2019re finally out again!\u201d\u201cThis time, the person we have to deal with is this human youth. Such a tender-fleshed human. I can squeeze him to death by myself. The nine of us combined, and with these godly weapons and armor, haha\u2026this is going to be too easy.\u201d\u201cSet up the formation first.\u201dThe nine ugly giants all began to chant the words to some foreign tongue which Ning couldn\u2019t understand, but his face quickly changed, because he understood that these ugly giants which had sprouted from those seeds were intelligent, and even capable of conversation!The two ends of the halls once again became filled with dense fog.\u201cHuman, prepare for death.\u201d The nine ugly giants all released furious roars. The ancient armor on their bodies immediately began to emit dazzling black light. The black light, emitting the stench of blood, quickly connected with each other, forming an enormous spiderweb in mid-air.Ning was shocked. \u201cDao Battle-Armor?\u201dDao Soldiers were a type of seed-soldier often used by the Grand Xia Dynasty. The Ji clan\u2019s most powerful seed-soldier, the \u2018Scarlet Guardians\u2019, were the lowest-level type of Dao Soldiers. Every single Dao Soldier\u2019s armor contained a large number of rune inscriptions, and the Dao Soldiers were capable of combining their energy together to attack the opponent together. They were also capable of combining their defense.Dao Battle-Armor like that of the Scarlet Guardians of the Ji clan were at most capable of allowing nine of the Scarlet Guardians to combine forces. Once they joined together, nine Scarlet Guardians were even capable of giving an early Xiantian expert a good fight.What\u2019s more, the Ji clan had five hundred thousand of these powerful seed-soldiers, the Scarlet Guards!This was the true backbone of the Ji clan.Normally, missions were carried out by black armored guards. Each time the Scarlet Guardians were sent out, it was only after the Ji clan\u2019s Five Prefectures all agreed to send them out, and it would have to involve a major event of the Ji clan.\u201cDao Battle-Armor. Aren\u2019t they all used for Houtian experts? And they should be covered with a large number of runes that can be seen at a glance.\u201d Ning stared at them. \u201cBut these nine strange giants have armor that don\u2019t have any runes on top of them, and each of them have power that is not weaker than that of a Xiantian.\u201d\u201cThis is going to be trouble.\u201d Ning held his breath.Dao Battle-Armor which Xiantian experts could use was something which the six hegemons of Swallow Mountain simply did not have. Ning hadn\u2019t even heard of such a thing. Most likely, only the armies of the Grand Xia Dynasty had them!\u201cKill!\u201d The nine ugly giants raised their large, thick staffs, charging towards Ning from both directions with angry roars, that enormous illusory spider web still connecting them from up above.Ning immediately transformed into a ray of smoke, quickly pouncing towards the direction which only had four of those strange ugly giants, who were maintaining a distance of several meters from each other as they wielded their massive stone staffs and charged forward wildly with long steps.\u201cKill!\u201d One of the ugly giants raised his enormous stone staff up high, then smashed downwards.\u201cCome on.\u201d Ning let his strength explode as well. His Fiendgod-like power completely filled his Darknorth swords, and he took this blow head on. He wanted to get a clear understanding of the strength of these ugly fellows.Swish!The stone staff was as thick as a man\u2019s thigh and over three meters long. It slashed through the air, smashing down on Ning\u2019s Darknorth swords. Immediately afterwards, with a \u2018Swoosh!\u2019 Ning\u2019s entire body was sent flying backwards, while the strange giant only took a single step back, garbling in his racial tongue, \u201cThis human has great strength. However, he still cannot compare to me, much less the nine of us combined.\u201dAlthough Ning had only fought one of them head on, because of the Dao Battle-Armor\u2026in reality, that staff blow had contained the combined strength of those nine strange giants.Flying backwards through the air, Ning felt his entire body was numb. His hand was damaged, and even the Darknorth sword in that hand flew out.\u201cCan\u2019t take it head on!\u201d In mid-air, Ning flipped over, his Fiendgod body quickly healing. Still in mid-air, he stepped onto the sides of the corridor walls, then like a giant Roc, scurried out, quickly leaping past the oncoming charge of those nine strange ugly giants.\u201cDon\u2019t run!\u201d\u201cWhat sort of talent is fleeing?\u201d\u201cHumans only know how to run.\u201dThe nine strange giants opened their fanged mouths, howling angrily. They discovered that this human was even faster than them.Ning pointed from a distance. \u201cWaterflame Lotuses!\u201dHuahuahua\u2026Every single Waterflame Lotus was formed from a fire lotus petal and a water lotus petal. Six sets of Waterflame Lotuses appeared out of nowhere, completely surrounding those nine ugly giants within. Every single lotus petal was slowly swiveling in opposite directions, forming a terrifying grinding, killing force.\u201cWhat a powerful human.\u201d The nine ugly giants came to a halt and looked at each other. \u201cWithout this godly armor, we probably would\u2019ve been injured long ago.\u201dNing saw that the nine giants had come to a halt, and were even conversing in their strange tongue.But his ever-successful Waterflame Lotuses were completely unable to harm them.\u201cNo use.\u201d Ning was surprised. Last time, when fighting against Ironwood Zhan, Zhan had relied on his formation and his Diamond Seal to hold on for a long time, which let Ning understand that his Waterflame Lotuses couldn\u2019t actually break through everything. \u201cMy Waterflame Lotuses were developed just recently, and were originally meant to protect me. Thus there are some deficiencies when using them to attack.Wielding their stone staffs, the nine strange giants once more charged forward en masse.\u201cLotus Protection.\u201d In the area around Ning, three fire lotus petals and three water lotus petals appeared, surrounding him. When the nine strange giants charged over and collided with the swiveling Waterflame Lotus, they were all impacted and were no longer able to attack Ning together.Ning, wielding his Darknorth swords, chose one of them to attack!\u201cDie.\u201dHis sword flashed like fire, moving at astonishing speed as he displayed the killing technique of the [Thunderflame Sword], the \u2018Thunderflash Flint\u2019.Hua! Hua! Hua!Rays of sword light shot towards the giant, who howled with valiant fury as he brandished his stone staff. The stone staff was incomparably heavy. Last time, when Ning had struck it, his entire body had gone numb. No longer daring to take it head on at all, Ning completely relied upon his marvelous sword techniques to deal with the giant in front of him.The battle armor was only capable of protecting part of the body. The head and some other areas were still exposed.Ning\u2019s sword blows were all aimed at this giant\u2019s head!Only, each blow was hampered by that dense black light. After just barely breaking through the obstruction, it was only capable of leaving some wounds on the giant\u2019s face, which immediately would heal, leaving the giant unwounded.\u201cKill, kill, kill.\u201d Ning was going all out.\u201cI want to live! So I have to kill you all!\u201d Ning used all his strength, even filling the Darknorth swords with his Xiantian ki as well. All he could do, however, was to leave some flesh wounds on these strange giants. The giants were capable of completely ignoring the negligible drop to their strength from these wounds.They fought for the amount of time it would take to brew a pot of tea.Because he had been controlling the Waterflame Lotus this entire time, and also fighting all out, his divine power was being used up at a fast rate.\u201cTheir power isn\u2019t dropping at all. I\u2019m not even able to badly injure them.\u201d Ning could sense that he had less than half his divine power remaining. He didn\u2019t dare to keep fighting them head on like this. He hurriedly flashed through their encirclement.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!Ning utilized the Windwing Evasion, scurrying first in this direction, then in that direction, dodging the pursuit and attacks of these strange giants.\u201cHuman, don\u2019t run.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to run.\u201d\u201cHumans are only able to run.\u201d These nine ugly giants roared angrily as they ran forward majestically, continuing their attacks. Ning didn\u2019t take them head on at all, relying on his Windwing Evasion to throw them off time and time again.In his heart, Ning was sighing.He had trained in swordplay for so long, but in the end, it was still the Windwing Evasion technique which allowed him to stay alive!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Another long period of time passed.\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d While fleeing, Ning was thinking frantically. Staring at the nine furiously roaring giants, who didn\u2019t seem to grow tired at all, he thought, \u201cThey have been chasing me for half a day now, but they still aren\u2019t getting tired. My divine power, however, is down to 20%.\u201dThe Windwing Evasion technique required him to use his Crimsonbright divine power as well! Although it used it up at a rate that was far slower than the rate it was used up in battle, running around for half a day would consume a great amount as well.\u201cMy full-strength sword attacks are only capable of giving them some light flesh wounds.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cBut the nine of them are actually those nine transformed seeds, just like those eighty one golden armored soldiers I fought earlier. When I shattered their army, they immediately reformed.\u201dNing understood very well\u2026Even if he were to pierce through their heads, they still probably wouldn\u2019t die.More importantly, his full strength attacks were only capable of leaving behind some flesh wounds.\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\u201cWhat exactly should I do?\u201d Ning constantly pondered.He had no options.Despair!\u201cIn the long-ago distant past, those Fiendgod Body Refiners of the Xiantian level who were transported probably watched, just like me, in despair as their divine power was used up, and then were killed.\u201d Ning now understood his weakness. His weakness was that his [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was only at the fourth stage.This corridor was meant for Fiendgod Body Refiners of the Xiantian level to go through.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen Immortal Juhua had accepted disciples, most likely the majority of those who had attempted these trials were at the peak Xiantian level as Fiendgod Body Refiners! But Ji Ning? Only when reaching the sixth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] would he be a peak Xiantian. He was currently only at the fourth stage! In terms of the purity or the depth of his divine power, he was still at an incomparable distance from the limits of the Xiantian level.It was only natural that he wouldn\u2019t be able to complete these three trials.\u201cCompared to those Xiantian experts who wanted to become the disciple of Immortal Juhua and came here to attempt these trials, my divine power is very shallow.\u201d Ning understood. \u201cFortunately, I gained a hint of understanding in the true meaning of the Dao, and then developed the \u2018Waterflame Lotus\u2019 technique, which is why I was lucky enough to complete the first trial! Otherwise, I probably wouldn\u2019t even have been able to complete the first one.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026there are three trials.\u201d\u201cForget about the third trial. This second trial\u2026\u201d Ning could sense that he already had dropped to less than 10% of his Crimsonbright divine power left. Deep in his heart, he felt both panic and despair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18 \u2013 Determining Life and Death\u201cI can\u2019t keep running. If I keep running, the Crimsonbright divine power in my body will be completely used up. Once my divine power is used up, I will definitely die. I won\u2019t even be able to struggle.\u201d Ji Ning suddenly came to a halt, then turned to look towards the four ugly giants, already extremely angry due to the long chase. The ugly giants wielded those stone staffs, charging forward with large steps.\u201cHe finally stopped running.\u201d\u201cThe human should be out of divine power by now.\u201d\u201cCompeting with us in running. We could run for several more days without fear.\u201d The nine ugly giants wanted to devour this human in front of them.Ning wielded a sword in each hand, standing there calmly.Faced with life and death, Ning\u2019s spirit was incomparably calm and empty. In this moment, he had thrown all other thoughts to the back of his mind, and in his heart, the only thing remaining was this battle.\u201cHmph.\u201d The nine ugly giants charged forward, and Ning immediately charged forward as well. Three fire lotus petals and three water lotus petals slowly swiveled around him, causing the giants to be unable to attack Ning simultaneously when they drew near him.Ning\u2019s sword struck out.A sword like fire!Wanton slaughter!\u201cHaha, his sword is too weak.\u201d\u201cToo weak.\u201d The ugly giants didn\u2019t care at all. Ning\u2019s sword pierced through the protection of that thick black light, but was only able to leave behind a hint of a wound.Although Ning was very calm, he was using his full force.\u201cNot much divine force left.\u201d Ning could feel that his divine power was ebbing. Grinding his teeth, he suddenly charged forward like a giant Roc soaring into the skies.Swoosh!The corridor was a hundred meters high, so Ning leapt a hundred meters into the air. While flying, two ancient Dao-seals appeared in Ning\u2019s hands. One was a Light Body Seal, while the other was a Divine Movement Seal. The Xiantian ki in his body immediately rushed into the two Dao-seals, and two queer surges of power immediately flowed into Ning\u2019s body.\u201cThe last sword!\u201d Ning hit the very top of the corridor, and then with two kicks, released all of his power!He charged downwards!Fast!Fast!Fast!Relying on the force from springboarding off the ceiling, the always-terrifying speed of the [Windwing Evasion], and the force of gravity pulling him downwards, as well as the Light Body Seal and the Divine Movement Seal, his speed became all the more terrifying! In this moment, Ning\u2019s downward charging speed had reached a heretofore unreached level, as fast as light!Speed is power. When speed reaches a certain extreme, the power of the sword would naturally be great as well.\u201cThe raindrop holds the meaning of Raindrop Pierces Rocks. The raindrop can become a Rain Line, a Thin Stream, a river or an ocean.\u201d As Ning charged downwards, he was using the killing stroke of the Raindrop Sutra, the \u2018Raindrop Pierces Rocks\u2019. As he did so, in his mind, he couldn\u2019t help but think back to the scene of his father, Ji Yichuan, teaching him swordplay. His father had once demonstrated all nine stances of the Raindrop Sword for him, three times.At this moment, when faced with death, Ning immediately understood.When his father demonstrated the swordplay, he moved very slowly. He started from \u2018Raindrop Pierces Rocks\u2019, then moved to \u2018Rain Line\u2019, \u2018Eternally Fresh Waterflow\u2019, \u2018Merciless Waterflow\u2019, and then finally returned to the \u2018Raindrop Pierces Rocks\u2019.Right after that, it transformed into \u2018Drizzling Rain\u2019, \u2018Tempest Curtain\u2019, \u2018Water Curtain Links to Heaven\u2019, and finally returned once more to the \u2018Raindrop Pierces Rocks\u2019!After that, it transformed once more into \u2018Thin Streams Flow Forever\u2019, \u2018Watertight\u2019, before finally returning to \u2018Raindrop Pierces Rocks\u2019 once more!\u201cRaindrop Pierces Rocks is the most powerful attack, but also the weakest attack. The amazing mysteries in the [Raindrop Sutra] are inexhaustible and boundless. One can spend a lifetime training in it. Remember\u2026Raindrop Pierces Rocks!\u201d Yichuan had said these words. At the time, Ning had felt he understood them.But after that night of meditating on the Dao, and these repeated life-and-death battles, Ning at this moment finally, truly understood what his father had labored to teach him.\u201cThis is the attack.\u201d\u201cRaindrop\u2026!\u201dNing, charging downwards at high speed with twin swords, immediately drew away one of the stone staffs of an ugly giant, sending it smashing to one side. With his right hand, Ning pierced directly towards the ugly giant\u2019s skull! The ugly giant\u2019s stone staff had missed its downwards smashing mark; naturally, he didn\u2019t have the chance to raise it back to block, but he wasn\u2019t afraid at all. \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Pierces Rocks!\u201d Ning only stared calmly at the head of that giant.Chi!His sword was like water, like a heavy raindrop landing upon a stone. Pa! The sword instantly pierced through that thick black barrier, driving itself deep into the head of that giant, even into the brain. The terrifyingly natural power of the blow suddenly exploded. There was nothing in the body that could block it, and so, instantly, with a \u2018Swish!\u2019 sound, the head exploded. It transformed into a puddle of black water, and the armor and the stone staff all fell to the ground.\u201cCollect.\u201d Ning immediately collected both the armor as well as the stone staff into his own storage magic treasure.The pool of black water quickly reformed into the strange giant again, who called out in shock, \u201cHow is that possible? How is that possible?\u201d\u201cNothing is impossible.\u201d Ning was now completely confident. He understood that these nine strange giants were no longer able to stop him.\u201cDie.\u201dNing only had to control his Waterflame Lotus to quickly once more smash the strange giant into a puddle of black water. Without the protection of the Dao Battle-Armor, the giant wasn\u2019t able to resist the crushing force of the Waterflame Lotus at all.\u201cThe eight of you can die as well now.\u201d Ning transformed into a blur, once more flashing forth like lightning.All nine Dao Battle-Armors had to be linked together for them to be able to assist each other. Right now, the strange giants weren\u2019t able to combine their strength at all. Now, when facing Ning\u2019s vastly improved swordplay\u2026they became unable to flee. All of them were killed, one after the other, and even their Dao Battle-Armor and stone staves were stored by Ning into his storage treasure.\u201cDie.\u201dNing stood there unmoving, only relying on the Solar and Lunar Divine Tattoos to control six Waterflame Lotuses, repeatedly grinding down on those nine giants, smashing them time and time again into black water. Even though they reformed, Ning would simply grind them apart again.After being crushed just a few times, the nine strange giants completely collapsed and weren\u2019t able to reform.The fog at the two ends of the corridor slowly faded away.\u201cFather.\u201d Ning gently murmured.Although that night he had spent meditating on the Dao resulted in Ning gaining a hint of true understanding regarding fire, water, and wind, understanding was nothing more than understanding; whether or not it could be used was another matter. In the past, Ning only understood the Waterflame Lotus, this single technique, which was meant for self-protection, not for attacking.But just now, relying on the guidance his father had given him to be his foundation, in that moment between life and death, he had finally understood the true meaning of the [Raindrop Sutra] \u2013 the True Meaning of the Raindrop!In terms of levels of understanding\u2026The level above \u2018one with the world\u2019 was that of the \u2018True Meaning\u2019!\u201cThe True Meaning of the Raindrop originates from the \u2018raindrop\u2019.\u201d Ning sighed in amazement. \u201cA single raindrop is the source. When there are many raindrops, it can transform into a line and become the \u2018Rain Line\u2019. When there are even more raindrops, naturally it can begin to flow and have life force, which is the \u2018Eternally Fresh Waterflow\u2019. And once the waves swell to an unblockable tide, that becomes \u2018Merciless Waterflow\u2019. But when the countless raindrops all come together, you can still describe it as just a single raindrop.\u201d\u201cRaindrop Pierces Rocks is the most powerful attack of the Raindrop Sutra, but also its weakest.\u201d Ning laughed. \u201cThat is true for defense as well. Drizzling Rain, Tempest Curtain, Water Curtain Links to Heaven\u2026they all become Raindrop Pierces Rocks in the end. Thin Streams Flow Forever and Watertight also become Raindrop Pierces Rocks.\u201d\u201cThe True Meaning of the Raindrop.\u201d\u201cAn unending circle.\u201d Ning sighed in amazement. \u201cNo wonder Father said that one can spend a lifetime on the Raindrop Sutra.\u201dWithout question, his father had clearly understood the True Meaning of the Raindrop long ago.One truly could spend a lifetime to understand that the [Raindrop Sutra] could infinitely circle in on itself to grow even more powerful.Strictly speaking\u2026Upon gaining insight into the True Meaning of the Raindrop, the [Raindrop Sutra] itself actually became without value. Perhaps the ancestor who had originally developed the [Raindrop Sutra] himself only reached this level, the True Meaning of the Raindrop, after having in some lucky circumstance developed these nine techniques that could forever cycle without ending. But of course, it was also possible that it was some sort of powerful Fiendgod or powerful Immortal who intentionally developed this sort of inexhaustible, circular, increasingly powerful swordplay.\u201cRaindrop Pierces Rocks. Raindrop Pierces Rocks.\u201d Ning chanted softly, and then he shut his eyes to rest. That battle had been too exhausting.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014After resting and eating to his fill, Ning\u2019s divine power recovered and then he began to perfect his True Meaning of the Raindrop. Upon having learned the True Meaning of the Raindrop\u2026he was completely capable of using one small raindrop after another to create a thin line, then execute the \u2018Rain Line\u2019. The power of this attack was far greater than that of Raindrop Pierces Rocks.Time flowed on.Ning ate and drank. Fortunately, prior to this, his kalestone and Ironwood Zhan\u2019s storage treasure all had some food within it. What he lacked right now was time. As time went out, if he was able to increase his [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] by another stage, if he could make his swordplay become even more powerful, then his chances of survival would naturally become greater.Ning understood\u2026He had relied on the Waterflame Lotus to make it through the first trial, while in the second trial, he had been pushed to his limits, at which point he had gained insights into the True Meaning of the Raindrop, finally making that breakthrough in peril. Based on the increase in difficulty, the third trial would definitely be very terrifying. Since Immortal Juhua had publicly called for a disciple, one could imagine how difficult this third trial must have been.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014By Serpentwing Lake.Ji Yichuan and Yuchi Snow, husband and wife, were temporarily staying here by the side of Serpentwing Lake. They were quietly waiting. Waiting for their son to return. But as one day after another passed, their hearts grew increasingly frantic, because the more time passed, the lower the chances were that their son was still alive.\u201cCough, cough.\u201d Snow was coughing.\u201cDon\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic.\u201d Yichuan saw that in one short month, his wife\u2019s illness had rapidly worsened, making him feel all the more pity for her.\u201cI don\u2019t want to panic either.\u201d Snow stared at the endless waters of Serpentwing Lake, then sighed. \u201cBut Ning, Ning, he\u2026it\u2019s been more than a month. Why hasn\u2019t he come back yet. Why hasn\u2019t he come back yet!\u201dTo Yuchi Snow, her son was her whole world.\u201cOur son will definitely come back. Definitely. When you were pregnant with Ning, the roots of your illness took hold. You can\u2019t be angry, and you can\u2019t panic. You know that. Take care of your body.\u201d Yichuan\u2019s heart was as frantic as a scorching fire. In his heart, he cared deeply about his son, but he was also worried about his wife by his side. Ever since that great battle they had fought on the way back from the Darknorth Seas\u2026Although the Whitewater Hound had braved a serious injury to take his wife away and flee, and their son had been lucky enough to survive, his wife and his son had both been injured.\u201cNing.\u201d Yichuan stared at the boundless lake waters as well. \u201cYou have to come back alive.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Within the endless hallway.There was no day or night within this hallway, and there was no way to clearly judge the passing of time. His appetite was enormous, but the amount of food in the kalestone wasn\u2019t that much, nor the amount in Ironwood Zhan\u2019s storage treasure. After all, they could hunt for food at any time in Swallow Mountain, while the kalestone had size limitations, so why put in too much?After a month, all of the stored food was completely devoured.\u201cThin Streams Flow Forever and Rain Line have all reached the \u2018True Meaning of the Raindrop\u2019 level.\u201d Ning said to himself. One was a defensive technique, while the other was offensive. His power could be considered to have greatly advanced. \u201cAfter a month of training, my divine power has grown stronger as well. This third trial is the final battle\u2026\u201dNing understood how terrifying this final trial would be.He also understood that if he passed through it, then he would survive.But if he failed, he would die!\u201cWhether it is life or it is death, it all comes down to this.\u201d\u201cIf I die, I will most likely go to the Netherworld Kingdom again. This time, I probably won\u2019t be so lucky as to avoid drinking Granny Meng\u2019s Elixir. After drinking it, I will no longer be myself.\u201d Ning had a dim sense right now, the deep, unconscious sense which one would have when one\u2019s soul grew powerful. His unconscious sense felt a type of incomparable terror right now, as though he was about to face an incomparably terrifying trial.\u201cTime to determine life or death.\u201dWielding the Darknorth swords in his hands, Ning headed directly for a twisting corridor, which still had three corpses on it that hadn\u2019t completely rotted away, as well as some magic treasures scattered on the floor.Ning used his divine sense to pick them up, calmly binding them. Upon investigating, he found that there were thousands of magic treasures stored within a storage treasure, all of which he could easily fuse. Indeed, these were all unranked magic treasures. However\u2026such a terrifying number still represented an incomparably astonishing wealth. Ning was very calm though. Because\u2026if he died, what use would these be?\u201cYou finally came.\u201d A hoarse voice rang out, in the tongue of the humans which was spoken everywhere throughout the Grand Xia Dynasty.Ning immediately looked over. From afar, in a place filled with black mist, a figure walked out. He had a crooked body, an oily green gaze, and his entire body was covered with black fur. He seemed to walk very slowly, but with each step, he travelled dozens of meters. \u201cA pity. You are too weak.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHua!In an instant, he appeared in front of Ning. His fan-sized, big grey palm carried a dense, deathly aura which slammed down towards Ning. This simple slap was so fast that Ning was completely unable to dodge. All he could do was relying on using his two swords to execute his ultimate defensive technique, \u2018Thin Streams Flow Forever\u2019, to block it. This \u2018Thin Streams Flow Forever\u2019 technique was currently also holding the True Meaning of the Raindrop within it.\u201cSwish!\u201d Ning was knocked flying, and his hands instantly turned numb.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Ning wanted to tighten his grip over the Darknorth swords in his hands. If his swords were sent flying, how would he use his sword techniques? But his fingers were already completely numbed and had no feeling. Hua! Hua! His shattered fingers and his two Darknorth swords flew far away, smashing into the distant walls and emitting a clear ringing sound.Every part of Ning\u2019s skin had split open, and he was surrounded by a bloody mist. The fingers on both hands had been shattered. And so, his entire body covered by that bloody mist, he flew backwards and smashed against the distant ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 1 \u2013 His WaitingJi Ning slammed onto the ground, but he felt the area around him was so quiet. So terrifyingly quiet.He couldn\u2019t hear anything at all.At the same time, his entire body had lost all feeling. The powerful life force within his Fiendgod-like body immediately got to work, and his divine power quickly began to heal everything. The torn muscles and skin on his body, and even his torn intestines and organs began to rapidly heal. Ning\u2019s ears could now hear again, and he gained feeling in his body again.\u201cPain. Such pain.\u201d Ning hurriedly looked into the distance. In that moment when he had completely lost all feeling and lost all hearing, he had been terrified.\u201cTruly too\u2026too terrifying.\u2019 Ning stared at that distant, stooped, black-furred monster which emanated that thick, deathly aura. \u201cThat slap\u2019s speed was so fast I couldn\u2019t dodge at all. His strength in turn is far greater than the combined strength of those nine strange giants!\u201dThe black-furred monster stood there quietly, his oily green eyes staring at Ning. He let out a hoarse sigh, which carried an endless resignation and disappointment. \u201cI\u2019ve waited for far too long, so long that I\u2019ve forgotten time. All you need to do is pass the three trials without dying. You don\u2019t need to kill me. You just need to knock me down, to injure me. That\u2019s all.\u201dWith difficulty, Ning climbed to his feet, the ground stained with blood.\u201cKnock you down?\u201d Ning stared at the stooped, black-furred creature.\u201cNo. More precisely speaking, as long as you can injure me, can break my skin, can make me bleed.\u201d The black-furred creature said slowly, \u201cI will immediately fall down. I\u2019ve already calculated\u2026the last time, when Immortal Juhua was recruiting a disciple, there were ten people who had completed the trials and appeared before me. It was so rowdy. There was one of them, a youth, who relied on an extremely powerful Dao-seal to injure me. But I just took a step back instead of falling down\u2026if I had fallen down, there would have been no need for me to endure these countless, lonely years. Loneliness truly is terrifying, very terrifying\u2026\u201dListening to this, Ning held his breath.The black-furred creature in front of him had actually existed in the era of Immortal Juhua. He definitely wasn\u2019t training the Immortal ways, because there was no way for an ordinary Immortal to live this long. Only by becoming a Celestial Immortal would one truly have an unlimited lifespan, but there was no way a Celestial Immortal would be like the person in front of him. Most likely, a single breath from a Celestial Immortal would disintegrate Ning.\u201cMaster only said that anyone able to injure and knock me down would be considered to have passed this trial.\u201d The black furred creature said slowly in that hoarse voice. \u201cCome. Injure me. As long as you can injure me, I will immediately fall down.\u201d\u201cInjure you?\u201d Ning\u2019s divine will once more picked up those two Darknorth swords. His severed fingers were reattached. This black-furred monster only watched silently, not interfering.The black-furred monster looked at Ning, then said slowly, \u201cCome at me full force. Everyone in the countless years who has come before me, I have given them this same chance. As long as a person can injure me, I will immediately fall down. Only\u2026none of them were able to injure me. Not one!\u201dNing\u2019s heart shook.\u201cOnly that one time, when Immortal Juhua was recruiting a disciple, did that Dao-seal injure me. Why didn\u2019t I fall down? Just that one time. I missed that opportunity and never had another one.\u201d The black-furred creature spoke very slowly. Tormented by countless years of loneliness, he no longer wished to live.\u201cInjure him?\u201d Ning was frightened and shocked.Based on what this creature which had most likely lived since the Fiendgod era was saying, only a single person had ever been able to injure him, and that was through using a Dao-seal!\u201cThese people who made it here over the years most likely also included geniuses who had reached the level of comprehending the True Meaning of the Dao.\u201d Ning felt an unbearable pressure. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\u201cCome.\u201d The black-furred creature began to walk forward, his body hunchbacked. \u201cCome. Wound me.\u201dNing clenched his Darknorth swords.Swoosh!Ning suddenly charge into the air, two Dao-seals appearing in his hands. They were a Light Body Seal and a Divine Movement Seal\u2026although he had found many Dao-seals in the storage magic treasures on the corpses, virtually all of them had lost their magic power over the passage of countless years and become useless. Only a hundred or so seals were left, amongst which the Divine Movement Seal and the Light Body Seal were the most common. The two Dao-seals immediately entered his body upon activation.\u201cDie.\u201d Ning charged upwards, reaching the ceiling of the corridor, then kicked off with his two legs, utilizing the Windwing Evasion as he charged down from the top of the prefecture.At this moment, Ning had reached the limits of his speed.\u201cDie!\u201dNing\u2019s entire strength was focused on the Darknorth sword in his right hand, stabbing directly downwards.The stooped frame of the black-furred creature came to a halt, raising its head and staring upwards with its oily green eyes at the downwards charging Ning. He just watched, watched quietly\u2026his eyes didn\u2019t have a hint of life, seeming very slow and numb.\u201cRaindrop!\u201d\u201cPierces Rocks!\u201dNing charged downward, the tip of his sword transforming into a drop of water. \u2018Drip\u2019. It dripped onto the fur-covered face of that black-furred creature. At this moment, both his divine power as well as his Xiantian ki were being released at full power, and penetrative force from his high speed combined with the \u2018True Meaning of the Raindrop\u2019 had formed an extremely terrifying sword\u2026\u201cChi!\u201dThe tip of the sword pierced onto the black-furred creature\u2019s face, who simply continued to look at Ning with an upraised face.\u201cYou are still very far off.\u201d The black-furred creature sighed, his oily green eyes filled with boundless disappointment. \u201cI need to keep waiting, keep waiting\u2026as for you, I have no choice but to kill you.\u201dNing\u2019s sword had stabbed onto the black-furred creature\u2019s face, but hadn\u2019t left behind any injury. Unwilling to accept this, the Darknorth sword in his twin hands executed the \u2018Rain Line\u2019 and \u2018Moth Flies Into the Flame\u2019, two great killing strokes, stabbing at the creature\u2019s chest and face, but once again, he was unable to harm the creature at all.\u201cRetreat.\u201d Ning hurriedly retreated dozens of meters.The black-furred creature\u2019s stooped form continued to make its way forward, slowly shuffling, but moving dozens of meters with each step. In terms of speed, he was actually even faster than Ning! Whether it was walking speed or attack speed, he was faster than Ning. This was the first time Ning encountered someone faster than him in this corridor of trials.Previously, he was able to rely on his Windwing Evasion to flee and buy time for himself, but this time, he was not able to do so.\u201cHow can his skin be as tough as this?\u201d Ning was incomparably frantic. Although the other Fiendgod Body Refiners of the Xiantian level who had previously fallen here served as proof that harming this black-furred creature was an incomparably difficult task, Ning still felt a sense of hopelessness after he himself truly used a full force attack and yet was unable to scratch the other\u2019s face.\u201cDie. Stop struggling.\u201d The hoarse voice rang out, and the stooped black-furred figure appeared out of nowhere by Ning\u2019s side.Ning\u2019s body immediately became surrounded by three fire lotus petals and three water lotus petals, swiveling slowly in opposite directions and generating a stirring force. But to this black-furred creature, the force generated by the Waterflame Lotus was like nothing more than walking within small rippling waves, unable to budge his body at all.Ning\u2019s two hands once more executed the \u2018Raindrop Pierces Rocks\u2019 attack, stabbing at the black-furred creatures legs and genitalia.\u201cI\u2019m unable to flee, and defense is useless. I have to find a chance of survival. Killkillkill! Perhaps the other parts of his body have a weak point that I can stab.\u201d Ning definitely wouldn\u2019t just give up.\u201cStop struggling.\u201dThe black-furred creature sighed, and his fan-shaped giant palm once more slapped down towards Ning. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to take about Ning\u2019s swords, allowing them to stab on his body as he still slammed his palm down on Ning\u2019s body.\u201cBang!!!\u201dThe armor-type magic treasure Ning was wearing instantly split apart, and the giant palm, filled with that dense deathly aura, went straight through Ning\u2019s chest, and then Ning himself was sent flying far, far away.Bang.Ning lay there on the floor, a huge hole in his chest. His body had nearly been torn in half. Ning lay there, completely unable to move. Such a huge hole suddenly appearing in his chest had caused his entire body to be paralyzed. He had to wait for the life force in his body to begin to regenerate it, but that needed time. He would most likely need half a minute before he would be able to recover his ability to move again.But that distant, black-furred creature was already walking over again. Most likely, in just another second, he would be in front of Ning.\u201cDie.\u201d The stooped figure of that black-furred creature ambled forward.\u201cNo!\u201d Ning\u2019s heart was filled with incomparable ardor, ardor for life. He had died before, and had even gone to the Netherworld Kingdom and had seen Grandma Meng\u2019s Elixir. So he all the more desired life\u2026he didn\u2019t want to go drink Grandma Meng\u2019s Elixir. \u201cWhat should I do? How can I survive? I can\u2019t even move\u2026right now, all I have left is my divine will. Can it be that I can rely on my divine will to wrap up the Darknorth swords to pierce into the black-furred creature.\u201dNing felt hopeless.Ning knew very well the level of strength the divine will was capable of. When he had killed Ironwood Zhan, he had investigated. Divine will was capable of wrapping up trees, boulders, with a force that was roughly equivalent to a late-stage Xiantian Fiendgod Body Refiner! The power of will made physical was very powerful and very strong. But what good would it be right now?\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cI also have them.\u201d Ning, seeing the black-furred creature draw closer, suddenly thought of something, letting out a heroic cry. \u201cAll out, now!\u201dHuahuahua\u2026.In the area around Ning, one magic treasure after another appeared out of nowhere in a dense cluster. Sabers, swords, spears\u2026thousands of magic treasures hovered there. These magic treasures were all controlled by his divine will, and the blade tips, sword tips, and spear tips were all pointed towards that black-furred creature.\u201cAll of my Xiantian Ki! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Ning had gone completely mad. The Xiantian ki in his dantian fully entered every single magic treasure.These were all unranked magic treasures that had been left behind by deceased Xiantian lifeforms over the course of countless years. Ning had been able to easily bind them. All of these were usable by Xiantian experts, but generally speaking, Xiantian experts would wield them with their hands. Ning, because he had divine will, was able to use his divine will to wield the magic treasures.It was as though thousands of hands had suddenly snatched up every single magic treasure, aiming them at the black-furred creature.All of his Xiantian ki had entered every single magic treasure, causing Ning\u2019s meridians to be torn. Generally speaking, a Xiantian lifeform could battle for a very long time, but Ning had used all of his Xiantian ki to be dispersed amongst thousands of magic treasures, causing the amount to drop.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cKill!\u201dNing\u2019s badly damaged, completely immobile body lay there as he howled heroically with a savage look on his face.His heroic howl was filled with incomparable ardor for life!Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Countless sword flashes, saber flashes, spear flashes, and more all shot out, instantly turning the entire corridor into a wall of dazzling white color. All of them were aimed with incomparable accuracy, stabbing out at the same time at the body of the black-furred creature, who had already closed his eyes and spread his arms out.\u201cBang\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2 \u2013 The Fifth MasterThousands of magic treasures shot out like rays of sword light, blade light, spear light, and more. They were like thousands of Xiantian Ki Refiners attacking in unison! But Ji Ning did this all by himself. If Ning hadn\u2019t reached the \u2018divine will\u2019 level of the soul, there would have been no way for him to control so many magic treasures so accurately.If Ning hadn\u2019t gained such astonishing regenerative abilities at the Xiantian level as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to so wildly have all of his ki explode outwards; the only thing that would have happened was that his arteries and meridians would completely shatter, resulting in him becoming a cripple.\u201cSwish\u2026.\u201dThe black-furred creature didn\u2019t block at all, nor did he dodge at all. He held his arms wide and closed his eyes. He was waiting\u2026hoping\u2026The corridor was a cacophony of sound.The black-furred creature was like a mountain collapsing. With a rumbling sound, he fell over!\u201cDid I wound him?\u201d Ning stared with incomparable hope.Right now, his body was ravaged, his meridians and arteries were ripped, and not a single drop of his Xiantian ki was remaining.\u201cI must have\u2026I must have\u2026\u201d Ning stared hopefully. From afar, the fallen black-furred creature suddenly sat up, lowering his head to look at his chest. At his chest, his black fur had been torn apart, revealing faintly red flesh and deep green-colored blood. A thin line of blood oozed out from the wound, and then the wound rapidly healed, leaving behind only that line of deep green blood.Ning\u2019s eyes instantly turned round, and he stared at the traces of deep green blood on the chest of that black-furred creature.Success!He had succeeded!He would live!\u201cFather. Mother. I\u2019ve survived.\u201d Ning\u2019s Fiendgod-like body was quickly recovering. Although he was unable to move, Ning forgot his pain; rather, he felt wild joy at having overcome that tribulation.\u201cWounded me. You wounded me.\u201d From afar, the black-furred creature was first stunned, and then he raised his head, letting out a wild, heroic howl. \u201cAoooooooooooooooooo!\u201dThis heroic howl contained incomparable madness, sadness, and a sense of release.Ning managed to sit up as well now, and he stared at the distant, howling black-furred creature\u2026.the loneliness and torment which could be heard in this great howl, which had been suppressed for trillions of years, caused even Ning\u2019s heart to feel a sour bitterness.After a long time, the sound ceased.The black-furred creature stood up and look at Ning. In his hoarse voice, he said, \u201cThank you, my new master! Hurry up and bind this Immortal mansion. We will meet again.\u201dHua!Immediately afterwards, the black-furred creature disappeared into thin air.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Ning quickly was able to stand up as well. The previous wounds to his meridians had been completely healed now, and he collected the thousands of magic treasures that lay scattered on the floor, storing them into his storage treasure.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that in the end, I would rely on these unranked magic treasures to pass the third trial.\u201d Ning let out a long sigh. A Fiendgod Body Refiner at the Xiantian level was able to use thousands of magic treasures in a single combined strike\u2026he had never even heard of such a thing, so prior to this, he hadn\u2019t even considered the possibility.This was because this sort of action would only be possible for a freakishly talented person like Ning, who clearly was only a Xiantian level, and yet whose soul was already on the level of having \u2018divine will\u2019.Ning had been visualizing the [Nuwa Painting] since he was an infant. The [Nuwa Painting] was one of the best visualization techniques even in the Celestial Realm or the Netherworld Kingdom, much less in the mortal realms\u2026 the likes of the Ji clan had never even heard of \u2018visualization techniques\u2019. In fact, Ning believed that even in the entire vast area controlled by the Grand Xia Dynasty, the best visualization techniques couldn\u2019t necessarily compare to the [Nuwa Painting].\u201cSuccess.\u201d\u201cI successfully passed this tribulation.\u201d Ning stared at his surroundings. He saw the corpses and skeletons in the distance on the ground, and felt all the more emotional. \u201cThe dead became these skeletons. The survivor, according to what the black-furred creature said\u2026I should be the new master.\u201dNing was in no hurry to advance. Instead, he sat down in the lotus position and rested.It took a full day for the Xiantian ki in his body to return to normal. Only then did Ning rise and continue to advance. When walking through the twisting corridors, Ning didn\u2019t move very quickly. Instead, he carefully inspected this ancient Immortal estate.After a long time\u2026\u201cUm?\u201d Ning saw that not far away, there was an exit, outside of which a pillar could faintly be seen.\u201cI\u2019ve arrived?\u201d Ning quickly walked out of the exit, and as he did, he had to suck in a cold breath. This was an incomparably vast palace, at least thousands of meters high. Compared to this vast palace, the nearby hundreds of meters tall corridors appeared to be extremely small.In the front of the palace, there was an enormous praying mat, which was also three hundred meters in diameter.And in the back of the palace\u2026There were also hundreds of enormous prayer mats scattered about as well.\u201cSuch an enormous prayer mat?\u201d Ning\u2019s heart was filled with many questions. \u201cPrayer mats are meant to be sat on, but this three hundred meter long prayer mat\u2026what sort of a giant would sit atop this? And it seems that in addition to the giant who would sit at the top of the hall, there would also be hundreds of other giants sitting in front of him.\u201cThe Immortal estate of Immortal Juhua?\u201d Ning shook his head.If the Immortal was a human, his body should be sized like a normal humans.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Ning hurriedly walked about, carefully inspecting this palace. The entire palace was very old and plain. Aside from those hundreds of prayer mats, there were no other decorations at all. One plain stone pillar after another supported the palace hall, and on each of the two sides of the palace hall were corridors, some three hundred meters tall, others three thousand meters tall.There were three of the corridors that were three thousand meters tall, while only two of the corridors that were three hundred meters tall.\u201cI can\u2019t go in?\u201d Ning discovered that he wasn\u2019t able to enter any of the corridors, including the one he had just come from. It was as though there was an invisible wall blocking them.\u201cThe palace door!\u201d Ning turned to look at the imposing palace door. Outside the palace door\u2026there was an area completely enveloped in mist that one couldn\u2019t see through at all.Ning stood there, in this incomparably vast palace. He was as small as an ant. He then walked over to one of the prayer mats and sat down. He himself was only 1.7 meters in height, but he was seated on a three hundred meter long prayer mat. Ning felt that this was quite amusing.\u201cIt really is comfortable.\u201dWhile sitting on the prayer mat, Ning could feel his mind growing more alert, and even his thoughts became much more rapid and nimble.\u201cHow strange. I clearly have made it past the three trials and arrived at this palace hall. But right now, I\u2019m not able to enter any of the corridors of the palace halls. I\u2019m trapped here.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cThe original master of this Aquatic Manor, having left behind those three trials, should have made some preparations for the successor who passed those trials, right?\u201dFor example, the black-furred creature was teleported to him, then teleported away.He himself had been teleported here as well\u2026clearly, someone should be controlling this Aquatic Manor.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Right at this moment, as Ning was sitting on the prayer mat and pondering, suddenly, from one of the three thousand meter tall corridors off to the side of the palace hall, an old black bull walked over.As though sensing it, Ning turned his head to look. As he did, he saw an old black bull that was many meters in length slowly walk in. The old bull\u2019s eyes were filled with curiosity and liveliness as it carefully inspected Ning.\u201cSenior, might I ask who you are?\u201d Ning immediately spoke out.Most likely every single creature which appeared within this Aquatic Manor was extraordinary.\u201cMe?\u201d The old black bull shook its head. \u201cDon\u2019t call me \u2018Senior\u2019. I\u2019m nothing more than the spirit of a magic treasure.\u201d\u201cSpirit of a magic treasure?\u201d Ning was astonished. \u201cMagic treasures have spirits?\u201dHe\u2019d never heard of such a thing.\u201cI\u2019m the magic treasure which Immortal Juhua always kept by his side.\u201d The old black bull sighed. \u201cChild, don\u2019t think too much about it. Even if I brought my \u2018body\u2019 in front of you, given your power, there is no way you would be able to bind me.\u201dNing nodded. He understood this. As a Xiantian, he was only capable of binding some unranked magic treasures. Even ranked treasures had high and low level ones. The more powerful the magic treasure, the more difficult binding it was!\u201cMight I ask about the status of the master of this Immortal estate?\u201d Ning hurriedly asked.\u201cDead. All dead.\u201d The old black bull shook its head. \u201cDead for I don\u2019t even know how many years.\u201dNing nodded to himself. It was as he had thought.\u201cIt has been too long, far too long. Over these slow, countless ages, I\u2019ve teleported in quite a few Xiantian-level Fiendgod Body Refiners, as well as Zifu Disciples.\u201d The old black bull sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, not a single one was able to succeed. At most, they would make it to the third trial, where they would all die. I didn\u2019t expect that you, child, who clearly don\u2019t have sufficiently dense divine power, would be able to succeed. This can be considered a miracle.\u201d\u201cThat third trial in particular.\u201d\u201cYour soul has actually reached such a stage of power. However, the technique which you used is completely impractical.\u201d The old black bull said disdainfully. \u201cThousands of magic treasures, aimed in a single direction. All the enemy has to do is dodge, and then you would have to immediately control thousands of magic treasures to change direction and aim at him again\u2026it will be very hard for you to actually strike your enemy.\u201dNing nodded. \u201cTrue.\u201d\u201cHowever, that golem was driven to nearly the point of insanity by the torment of countless years of loneliness, and so he actively welcomed the attack.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cAnd so, you succeeded.\u201d\u201cGolem?\u201d Ning said in surprise. \u201cIt was a golem?\u201dHe had seen golems before. When he had been training with a sword, his father had procured a training golem for him. But that black-furred creature just now\u2026it had blood, had flesh, and was even capable of speech. How could it be a golem?\u201cChild, how much do you know? There are many different types of golems. That one just now was just a golem which had a soul inserted into it.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cAfter implanting a soul into it, it gains intelligence and is even capable of displaying the \u2018one with the world\u2019 sage, or even more profound sword techniques, saber techniques, boxing techniques, etc. Naturally, its power would multiply manifold.\u201dNing now understood.\u201cAs the soul trapped within the golem who is forever incapable of being reincarnated, it will be endlessly tormented.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cHowever, your own level of enlightenment is not low. That lotus flower you created earlier was based on the fact that your body has the Divine Solar Tattoo and the Divine Lunar Tattoo. For you to have these two great divine tattoos means that you most likely are training in the most powerful Fiendgod Body Refining technique of the Fiendgod era, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. Given your density of divine power, I expect you have only reached the fourth stage!\u201dNing hurriedly said, \u201cSenior, your judgment is wise.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] is a very powerful technique.\u201d The old black bull sighed. \u201cYou were able to break through to the Xiantian level, but you are only at the fourth stage. Most likely, you broke through just recently. You should be only ten or so years old as well.\u201d\u201cEleven.\u201d Ning didn\u2019t try to hide it.\u201cAn eleven year old Xiantian who trains in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. And at such a young age, you were able to reach the \u2018True Meaning of the Dao\u2019 in swordplay.\u201d The old black bull shook its head. \u201cA genius like this is someone whom even the Grand Xia Dynasty would expend countless efforts in cultivating and training. There\u2019s no way they would be willing to let someone like you take tutelage under the auspices of Immortal Juhua.\u201dNing lifted an eyebrows.\u201cActually, just by reaching the sixth stage, given the amount of divine power you would have, and your understanding of the \u2018True Meaning of the Dao\u2019, you would have been able to succeed in the third trial. However, for you to succeed in the way you have is still quite impressive. Your soul is powerful, and your level of enlightenment is high. Your future accomplishments will be limitless.\u201d The old black bull sighed. \u201cI still have to congratulate you. You have become the fifth master of this place.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He slowly ambled over, his body seeming vaguely illusory. He wasn\u2019t a material creature, after all; just the spirit of a magic treasure.\u201cOf course it is you.\u201d The old black bull said.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. What I meant was\u2026I\u2019m only the fifth master?\u201d Ning hurriedly asked. \u201cCan it be that Immortal Juhua wasn\u2019t the first one?\u201dHe had previously discovered the letter on that Godbanian tree bark, and had hypothesized that after Immortal Juhua died, he shouldn\u2019t have given this Immortal estate to anyone else.\u201cImmortal Juhua was the third master of this Immortal estate.\u201d The old black bull said.\u201cWho was the fourth?\u201d Ning asked.The old black bull\u2019s eyes held a hint of wistful memory in them. He slowly said, \u201cIn those days, Immortal Juhua\u2019s fame was widespread. He was someone who stood at the very forefront of the entire Grand Xia Dynasty. A Loose Immortal capable of living for millions of years is an absolute miracle. The Three Disasters and Nine Tribulations which everyone who embarks on the Immortal path must endure\u2026each tribulation is fiercer than the last. He had lived for simply too long, and the difficulty of the tribulations had reached an inconceivable level. Even Celestial Immortals probably wouldn\u2019t be able to survive them. The longer he lived, the more the people in the Grand Xia Dynasty became aware of how formidable he was.\u201d\u201cImmortal Juhua knew that his time was limited, and so he wanted to accept a disciple, and thus he spread the word\u2026that he would only accept a Fiendgod Body Refiner who was at least a Xiantian lifeform but no more than a Zifu Disciple. Of the major clans of the Grand Xia Dynasty, the ones who were in the know all sent their disciples to attempt the trials of that corridor.\u201cTwo corridors. One for Xiantian lifeforms, one for Zifu Disciples.\u201d\u201cOne young person after another died. In the end, finally, a Zifu Disciple named \u2018Rampart\u2019 successfully passed the three trials of his corridor, and thus Rampart became the fourth master of this Immortal estate.Ning nodded.Immortal Juhua was the third.Rampart was the fourth.\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d The old black bull shook his head. \u201cIn the face of the endless tribulations, Immortal Juhua died. Not long after Immortal Juhua died\u2026Rampart, who was merely at the \u2018Wanxiang Adept\u2019 level died as well. As for how he died and where he died, that\u2019s unclear. Ever since Rampart died, this Immortal estate has not had an owner.\u201dNing nodded, then said questioningly, \u201cRampart didn\u2019t carry the Immortal estate with him?\u201d\u201cCarry it with him?\u201d The old black bull said in a low voice. \u201cHe was unable to even completely bind this Immortal estate. How could he have carried it with him?\u201d\u201cHe, a venerable Wanxiang Adept, was unable to bind it?\u201d Ning asked.The old black bull said, \u201cChild, don\u2019t underestimate this Immortal estate. This Immortal estate has an extraordinary background and history, and binding it is extremely hard. You should know that the more powerful a magic treasure is, the harder it is to bind it. This Immortal estate is actually a \u2018dwelling\u2019 type magic treasure\u2026only by becoming a Primal will one become just barely capable of binding it and carrying it.\u201d\u201cA Primal can only just barely bind it; he wouldn\u2019t be able to completely control this Immortal estate, which has some secret areas within that he still wouldn\u2019t be able to enter. Only by becoming an Earthly Immortal or a Loose Immortal will one truly be in control of this Immortal estate.\u201dNing understood. It made sense. If one was able to easily bind a magic treasure which was capable of teleporting people, that would be bizarre.\u201cChild, do you now understand how extraordinary this Immortal estate is?\u201d The old black bull said complacently.\u201cElder, you can address me as Ji Ning.\u201d Ning said.\u201cChild Ji Ning.\u201d The old black bull stepped onto one of the giant prayer mats on the ground. \u201cTake a look at this prayer mat. The prayer mats are all hundreds of meters wide. Have you considered why?\u201dNing pondered, then said, \u201cElder, when I first arrived within this palace hall, I was very puzzled as well. There is no need for an Immortal estate to have such enormous prayer mats. I actually wondered\u2026if this Immortal estate was previously lived in by a race of giants or some other races.\u201d\u201cAlthough Immortal Juhua was only a Loose Immortal, he survived for millions of years before dying.\u201d The old black bull sighed. \u201cHe is the only Loose Immortal I know of who lived for so long! Why was Immortal Juhua so powerful, and why could he last for so long before dying? It was because of this\u2026this Immortal estate!\u201d\u201cThis Immortal estate\u2019s age is beyond reckoning. According to the guesses of Immortal Juhua, this should have been the dwelling of an extremely powerful Fiendgod, which is why such enormous prayer mats, beds, and corridors were built.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cImmortal Juhua had, when he was young, made it past three trials before becoming the third master of this place.\u201d\u201cImmortal Juhua had to pass three trials as well?\u201d Ning was stunned.The old black bull said, \u201cThe three trials\u2026.was the rule set down by the first master of this Immortal estate! That first master should have been an extremely powerful Fiendgod. Judging from the way the giant prayer mats in this hall are laid out, that Fiendgod should have been sat on the one up front, expounding on the Dao, while below many other Fiendgods would listen. Haha, these are all the affairs of the past. The Fiendgod Era ended long ago.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The old black bull and Ning chatted for quite a long while.Ning finally couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cAs the fifth master of this Immortal estate, what sort of benefits do I get?\u201dThe old black bull blinked.\u201cImmortal Juhua was a Loose Immortal who had lived for millions of years. He should have left some things behind.\u201d Ning asked.The old black bull remained silent.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cAlas!\u201d The old black bull finally let out a sigh. \u201cThe third master and the fourth master both died, and they died too long ago. Immortal Juhua had originally given Rampart some treasures, but Rampart died outside. Countless years have passed, and you can\u2019t possibly get anything from Rampart. Immortal Juhua did indeed leave some magic treasures within this Immortal estate, but you won\u2019t be able to get them.\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Ning asked. \u201cAren\u2019t I the master of this Immortal estate now?\u201dThe old black bull shook his head. \u201cImagine that you are the owner of a storage-type magic treasure, but you aren\u2019t able to bind it. Will you be able to take out the treasures within it? This Immortal estate is a dwelling-type magic treasure. If you don\u2019t bind it, there are many areas you cannot enter. Right now, you are only able to be here in the main palace hall. The other areas are off limits to you.\u201d\u201cI can only enter this main hall?\u201d Ning was astonished.\u201cYou should have discovered that you are only able to be in this main hall and that you are unable to enter the other areas of this Immortal estate.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cFirst become a Zifu Disciple; that will allow you to bind the control talisman. When you bind the control talisman, there will be many benefits to you. You will be able to enter many of the areas within the Immortal estate, and you\u2019ll also be able to voluntarily enter the Immortal estate from outside; for example, at Serpentwing Lake, you\u2019ll be able to enter the Immortal estate as you please.\u201dPa!Out of nowhere, a dark gray talisman appeared, landing on the floor with a clattering sound atop a prayer mat.\u201cThis is the control talisman.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cOnly the master is permitted to have the control talisman. Hurry up and take it. Once you reach the Zifu Disciple level, you\u2019ll be able to bind it. After binding it, come back to the Immortal estate. Right now, you aren\u2019t able to enter any place at all, and you won\u2019t be able to get anything.\u201dNing collected this talisman.The talisman was very rough. Atop it, there was a complicated, ancient-looking character; \u2018Left\u2019! Just a single character. Although Ning had never learned the meaning of this character, upon seeing it, he naturally understood what it meant.\u201cControl talisman?\u201d Ning stored it into his storage-type magic treasure.\u201cAlright. You\u2019ve taken the control talisman, and I\u2019ve told you everything. You can leave now.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cI\u2019ll send you off now and teleport you back to that island in Serpentwing Lake.\u201dNing hurriedly called out, \u201cStop!\u201dThe old black bull looked towards Ning. \u201cIs there something else?\u201d\u201cJust like that\u2026I\u2019m supposed to leave?\u201d Ning couldn\u2019t help but say. \u201cI just barely survived, and I\u2019m supposed to leave with just a control talisman?\u201dThe old black bull blinked twice. \u201cWhose fault is it that the previous owner has already died? If he was alive, he could probably guide you or help you. But I\u2019m just the spirit of a magic treasure\u2026I don\u2019t have any magic treasures or curios of my own. As for you yourself, you train in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], the number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique which was even better than the technique which Immortal Juhua trained it. What can I give you? Oh! You probably don\u2019t have any visualization techniques, right?\u201d\u201cvisualization techniques?\u201d Ning was startled.The Lord of Cui Palace had given him the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique!\u201cvisualization techniques are capable of refining the soul and strengthening it.\u201d The old black bull said hurriedly. \u201cThis is something only the most powerful of clans have access to. I have a visualization technique in my memory. I\u2019ll transmit it to you.\u201d\u201cTransmit?\u201d Ning was curious.\u201cTake out a quill and some ink.\u201d The old black bull urged.Flipping his hand, Ning took out a quill and some ink, as well as a large piece of beast skin, placing them to one side.The old black bull looked at the quill, which began to hover in the air. \u201cI am the spirit of a magic treasure who has trained for countless years, but my \u2018divine will\u2019 is most likely still weaker than yours. Still, grabbing a quill isn\u2019t too difficult.\u201d Controlling the quill, he began to draw a painting onto that glossy beast skin parchment. Soon, a picture of a Buddha that had a compassionate look on his face began to appear on the parchment.This Buddha had the sun and the moon behind his back, and radiated boundless light.Just by looking at it, Ning felt slightly affected.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d The old black bull casually controlled the quill and tossed it to one side, then said delightedly, \u201cThis is a painting of the true form of Buddha, and the Shining Sun Moon Buddha at that! This [Inner Visualization of the Shining Sun-Moon Buddha] is the visualization technique which Immortal Juhua had previously used. I always was by his side, looking at this painting of Buddha, and thus I naturally memorized it. Although my painting isn\u2019t as good as the original, as long as you often look at this painting of Buddha\u2026you will definitely strengthen your soul.Ning was puzzled. \u201cInner visualization of Buddha?\u201d\u201cTo become a master of the Great Dao, aside from your body, you must understand the myriad mysteries of the Great Dao.\u201d The old black bull said.Ning only felt resigned. Compared with the [Nuwa Painting]\u2026it wasn\u2019t even comparable. His [Nuwa Painting] had been imprinted by the Lord of Cui Palace into his very soul and his memory. Naturally, he could sense it much more clearly. This old bull had simply drawn out an image of Buddha based on his own memory.\u201cCan it be that you already have a visualization technique?\u201d The old black bull noticed that Ning wasn\u2019t very excited, and he couldn\u2019t help but nod. \u201cMakes sense. Your soul is so powerful. You should already have a visualization technique. Right\u2026\u201dThe old black bull pondered for a while.Ning just waited.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis old bull was the spirit of an extremely powerful magic treasure who had followed Immortal Juhua for countless years. He should know many things.\u201cI remember now. Before this, you controlled thousands of magic treasures, right? I have a secret sword formation technique that is suitable for you to learn.\u201d The old black bull suddenly said hurriedly. \u201cIn the past, I watched Immortal Juhua kill a powerful enemy who controlled a large number of flying swords in a formation to attack his enemies. His sword formation was thus recorded down by Immortal Juhua, who carefully looked through it. Although I only saw it once, I completely memorized it. I\u2019ll make a copy for you.\u201dNing hurriedly took out a large number of beastskin parchments.The old black bull once again controlled the quill and began to write with it.At the very top of the beastskin parchment were four words: [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4 \u2013 Lesser Thousand Swords FormationJi Ning watched off to the side, not daring to disturb the old black bull as he wrote. On the skin parchment, one line of words after another swiftly appeared, along with the occasional formation diagram.Soon, the pages of skin parchment were completely filled.\u201cAll done.\u201dThe old black bull tossed the quill aside, saying delightedly, \u201cChild Ji Ning, you can be considered to be exceptionally talented. A Xiantian who actually has such an astonishing soul! Only with a sufficiently powerful soul is one suited for utilizing this \u2018Lesser Thousand Swords Formation\u2019. However, the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] also requires flying sword type magic treasures, and it has exceptionally high requirements with regards to the amount of magic treasures.\u201cI have plenty of these unranked magic treasures.\u201d Ning laughed.The old black bull shook his head. \u201cOnce you reach the Zifu Disciple level, those unranked magic treasures will no longer be usable. At that time, what you will need is ranked magic treasures, and generally speaking, you will need a large number of flying sword type magic treasures in order to utilize this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] technique\u2019s power.\u201d\u201cA large number of ranked magic treasures?\u201d Ning was stunned. \u201cHow many?\u201d\u201cThe [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] at this highest level requires 729 flying swords.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cEven if you are just using the weakest types of ranked magic treasures, you still need 729 of them\u2026the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] requirements regarding magic treasures are very high. The more flying swords, the better. The more you have, the greater the power of this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] technique.\u201dNing was stupefied.Over seven hundred ranked magic treasures, and all sword type? He wasn\u2019t sure if the entire Five Prefectures of the Ji clan combined would be able to buy so many, even if they sold off all their assets.\u201cAs your power increases, the number of flying swords you can use will naturally increase.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cStarting from Mortal-level magic treasures to Earth-level magic treasures, to Heaven-level magic treasures, to Immortal-level magic treasures\u2026\u201d\u201cI, I\u2026\u201d Ning felt an unbearable pressure. He hurriedly said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been hard for Immortal Juhua to procure and leave behind a few hundred flying swords here in this Immortal estate prior to his death, right? And Immortal Juhua killed that powerful enemy, who used the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] right?\u201dThe old black bull shook his head. \u201cThat great enemy was known as the Thousand Swords Immortal! Immortal Juhua had to expend enormous amounts of effort in order to kill him. Although he had acquired those flying sword magic treasures after killing him, it was a waste to just keep them without using them. Thus, Immortal Juhua immediately traded them away for a large number of precious materials, which he then forged me out of! Thus, if you want to acquire thousands of flying swords from Immortal Juhua, it is impossible. Truly powerful Immortals will usually only carry a few magic treasures which they are particularly skilled in. After killing an enemy, they will immediately use the enemy\u2019s tools to upgrade their own magic treasures! They won\u2019t just leave them there to be wasted.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Ning was somewhat despondent.\u201cDon\u2019t think too much of it. Don\u2019t think that just because you received this Immortal estate that you\u2019ll instantly fly to the heavens.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cThere are countless relic sites left from the Fiendgod Era, but how many people are able to truly stand at the very top of the Grand Xia Dynasty? The fourth master, Rampart, only reached the Wanxiang Adept level before dying. Don\u2019t end up like him.\u201dThe old black bull continued, \u201cMy creation was thanks to this Thousand Swords Immortal. Thus, I paid especial attention to this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. I didn\u2019t just read it once; I also carefully pondered it. I\u2019ll explain to you.\u201dNing immediately began to listen attentively.\u201cThe [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] uses nine flying sword type magic treasures to form the base of a formation! You need nine formation bases\u2026in order to form a sword formation. This is the most basic sword formation, which requires eighty one flying sword type magic treasures . This is the first level [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] attack.\u201d\u201cIf you are able to control a second set of eighty one flying swords and have these two sword formations cooperate\u2026your power will instantly multiple! This is the second level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]! You will need 162 flying swords!\u201d\u201cIf you are able to control 243 flying swords to have three sword formations join forces, your power will multiple once more. This is the third level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]!\u201d\u201cFour sword formations will again multiply the power, and is known as the fourth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].\u201d\u201cAnd so on and so forth.\u201d\u201cIn the end, with nine sword formations combined, you will need exactly 729 flying swords, which will be the ninth level of this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. The power is so great\u2026as to be inconceivable! But of course, given your current soul strength, even if you are able to control many unranked flying swords, you are far from being able to reach this level for now.\u201dNing nodded as though understanding.\u201cFor example, if you were to become a Wanxiang Adept, you would be able to use unranked magic treasures to set up nine sword formations! But if you were to use ranked magic treasures, most likely you wouldn\u2019t even be able to set up two or three sword formations.\u201d The old black bull said, \u201cThe more powerful a magic treasure is, the more mental energy you use up in controlling them. Naturally, it won\u2019t be easy to control them. But this also means that even after becoming a Celestial Immortal, you can still use this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. However, by then, perhaps you would have acquired an even better sword formation. But of course, this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]\u2026should be good enough for you to use for a thousand years.\u201d\u201cThe most important secret of this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] lies in the \u2018Lesser Thousand Seal Lines\u2019\u2026\u201dThe old black bull continued to explain some of the mysteries.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014A while later, Ning had finished reading the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] for the first time. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh in astonishment. Compared to the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], that \u2018Yin-Yang Twin Energy Formation\u2019 which Ironwood Zhan had used was absolute trash.Ning immediately and quickly withdrew nine sword-shaped magic treasures from his storage treasure. Because these were all unranked magic treasures, generally speaking they were meant to be held in the hand when engaging in battle; there were thus some differences between them and flying swords.\u201cLesser Thousand Seal Lines.\u201d Ning tested drawing the lines out on the floor with his finger.Given Ning\u2019s control of his body, he was naturally able to completely duplicate the seal lines.The old black bull, by his side, shook his head. \u201cNo. It isn\u2019t the appearance that needs to be the same; the inner meaning needs to be the same. When you draw the \u2018Lesser Thousand Seal Lines\u2019, you need to faintly activate the power of the heavens and the earth. Only then will the seal lines be complete.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Ning continued to draw.Because his copying ability was quite accurate, and given that Ning had already reached the \u2018True Meaning of the Dao\u2019 level, and also had a faint hint of understanding regarding the \u2018Dao\u2019\u2026after drawing it 312 times, he drew a seal line which was capable of utilizing a hint of the power of the world.\u201cRight.\u201d The old black bull nodded. \u201cYour level of comprehension is very high, your soul is powerful, and you are very sensitive towards the heavens and the earth. It is only normal that you learn quickly\u2026remember, the Lesser Thousand Seal Lines is the base for the entire [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. You must not reveal it. Once the Lesser Thousand Seal Lines are revealed, some of the larger tribes will definitely be able to develop this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] just based on the seal lines.\u201dNing nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cThen you can begin.\u201d The old black bull watched from one side.Ning let himself calm down, and then he withdrew a small basin from within his storage treasure. He placed his finger within the small basin, and from within his fingernail, one drop of blood after another began to well up and flow out. Soon, he had a small basin that was half-full of blood. Watching to the side, the old black bull shook his head and sighed emotionally, \u201cFiendgod Body Refiners have extremely powerful life force. They can be chopped into many pieces without dying, while Ki Refiners will die to a blow to the heart. If a Ki Refiner was to lose this much blood, their face would turn pale. For you, though, most likely your body replenished the blood as soon as you let it out.\u201dNing didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he picked up a sword-type magic treasure, which suddenly shrank in size greatly. Ning\u2019s finger, stained with blood, began to draw atop the sword.In the blink of an eye, a single Lesser Thousand Seal Line appeared on the sword. A bloody light flashed, and quickly, the seal line completely merged into the sword.\u201cSuccess.\u201d The old black bull nodded.Ning then picked up yet another sword-type treasure. Once he had mastered the Lesser Thousand Seal Lines, he virtually never made a mistake. During this attempt at the trials, he had acquired thousands of magic treasures, with swords being extremely common. He had a full thousand sword-type magic treasures. Ning straightforwardly drew onto 729 of the sword-type magic treasures.\u201cFormation base!\u201d Ning sat there in the lotus position, and imposed his will.Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!Immediately, nine swords swung into the air around Ning, slowly revolving. But there was something missing. Ning frowned.\u201cRemember. The power of the sword formation comes from attuning to the heavens and the earth.\u201d The old black bull said to one side.After the amount of time it took to brew tea.The nine swords hovering around Ning were faintly carrying within them a type of invisible intent. It was as though the nine swords actually formed a single entity. In that moment, the nine swords were positioned in a very perfect manner with respect to each other.\u201cThe formation base is complete. Formation, arise!\u201d Ning willed it, and then 72 more swords suddenly lifted up, all of them in groups of nine.The first level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] required 81 swords to be formed into a formation.\u201cHuahuahua\u2026\u201d81 sword-type magic treasures circled and hovered around Ning, while Ning himself closed his eyes as he controlled them. Soon, with the Lesser Thousand Seal Lines in each sword as the base, the 81 sword-type magic treasures began to emit a hazy glow while countless sword glows quickly converged around Ning.A constantly fluctuating sword light hovered there in the air next to Ning.Ning finally opened his eyes and stared at the hovering sword light next to him. This sword light was the Xiantian ki of his which had been transformed and compressed by the magic formation of the 81 sword-type magic treasures. The amount of power had already caused a qualitative change, and the strength was astonishing.\u201cNot too bad.\u201d Ning willed it. Another 81 swords rose into the air.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The old black bull stood there, watching. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh in amazement at the strength of Ning\u2019s soul. This wasn\u2019t as simple as what he had done earlier, just stupidly and wildly controlling thousands of magic treasures to go forward in one direction. He had to carefully control every single flying sword\u2026causing them to form a perfect, complete sword formation which was continuously able to summon the power of the heavens and the earth.\u201cHe mastered the third level as well. In terms of strength alone, the power of his sword light right now isn\u2019t any longer than his earlier attack of thousands of magic treasures.\u201d The old black bull sighed in astonishment. The power of this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] multiplied several times over with each increase in level.Hundreds of sword-type magic treasures swiveled around Ning, with the surface of each sword having a hint of light on it. In front of Ning, the solidified, devouring sword light grew even more powerful.Yet another 81 swords entered the mix, with the level of difficulty in controlling them quickly increased as well.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing\u2019s forehead began to be covered in sweat.Rumble\u2026All of the swords were hovering with a faint light.\u201cSuccess.\u201d The old black bull was stunned, incomparably stunned. \u201cHe is actually able to utilize the fifth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]!\u201dPapapapapapa\u2026405 swords clattered and fell to the floor. His forehead covered in sweat, Ning opened his eyes and murmured to himself, \u201cThe fifth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] is too arduous. My head hurts terribly. Normally, in battle, I should limit myself to the fourth level. Using the fourth level is much easier.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5 \u2013 Ancient RitesThe old black bull looked at Ji Ning, head covered in sweat, and said in praise, \u201cFormidable, formidable. Child Ji Ning, at such a young age, you are already able to utilize the fifth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. Compared to you, that Rampart is nothing worth mentioning at all! I didn\u2019t expect that after the Immortal estate has waited for so many years, an unpolished jade like you would appear!\u201dNing murmured to himself, \u2018unpolished jade\u2019? He himself had the experiences of his previous life, the [Nuwa Painting], and had been training hard since he was young. All these factors combined were what led to the old black bull praising him as being a piece of \u2018unpolished jade\u2019.\u201cSenior, right now, I find it difficult to utilize the fifth level.\u201d Ning repeatedly shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m only able to use the fourth level freely.\u201d\u201cUsing it freely is more important.\u201d The old black bull sighed. \u201cHave you discovered that although the fourth level of this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] only allows you to control three hundred or so flying swords, in terms of power, it is already greater than when you wildly controlled thousands of magic treasures!\u201dNing revealed a hint of amazement. \u201cEven more powerful than the combined attack of thousands of swords from earlier? Although I was able to feel that the sword light I created was done so in a free manner and that it held great power, I didn\u2019t know exactly how much power it had.\u201dThe old black bull said, \u201cThe fourth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] will allow you to kill most peak Xiantian lifeforms as easily as you wish.\u201dNing was delighted upon hearing this.\u201cSenior.\u201d Ning hurriedly asked, \u201cDare I ask, how is my current power? How does it compare to a Zifu Disciple?\u201d\u201cRight now, you have two primary types of battle tactics. The first relies on your Fiendgod body and your close-combat sword techniques.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cYour swordplay already carries within it a hint of the True Meaning of the Dao. Most Xiantian lifeforms aren\u2019t at such a high level of comprehension; most peak Xiantian lifeforms are at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 stage. Just based on this alone, you are at an advantage compared to most peak Xiantian lifeforms! But of course, I\u2019m just talking about \u2018ordinary\u2019 Xiantian lifeforms. If your enemy is as much of a freak as you are, whose swordplay is not inferior to you, then it would be hard to say who would win.\u201dNing nodded.He understood. For example, his father, Ji Yichuan. His swordplay was most likely still inferior to that of his father; after all, Father had long ago reached the peak Xiantian level. Ning naturally wouldn\u2019t be a match for his father.\u201cIf you relied on your [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]\u2026\u201d The old black bull continued, \u201cGiven your powerful Fiendgod body, if you use hundreds of flying swords to form into a [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], the power will indeed be very formidable. In terms of strength, it will be far beyond that of peak Xiantian lifeforms. It should have reached the power level of most early Zifu Disciples.\u201d\u201cJust early Zifu?\u201d Ning felt that his improvement should be larger than this.The old black bull shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate Zifu Disciples. Once Zifu Disciples internally establish their Zifu, the \u2018Violet Palace\u2019, their bodies will begin to generate elemental power! Even simple attacks such as punches and kicks will be far greater than that of the Xiantian level. These are two fundamentally different levels! In addition, more importantly, Zifu Disciples are capable of using ranked magic treasures.\u201d\u201cRanked magic treasures are extremely powerful. Zifu Disciples, when using them, are far more powerful than you Xiantians can imagine. The difference between a peak Xiantian and a Zifu Disciple is like that of an infant and an adult.\u201d The old black bull sighed in praise.Ning understood.Right. From the Xiantian level to the Zifu level was a fundamental change. It allowed one to be able to use ranked magic treasures. It was much like how a Xiantian lifeform could kill a peak Houtian expert as easily as chopping vegetables. Zifu Disciples could kill Xiantian lifeforms just as easily.\u201cRemember.\u201d The old black bull shook his head. \u201cNo matter what, do not underestimate Zifu Disciples. Every single Zifu Disciple has bizarre, strange abilities. Some are skilled at formations, others are skilled at venomous pests, still others at controlling souls or creating golems, or even sorcery\u2026there\u2019s no way to describe them in \u2018general\u2019. If you run into someone who is a bad matchup for you, you will definitely die.\u201d\u201cThe weak can overcome the strong.\u201d\u201cIf a bad matchup happens, an early Zifu expert can slay a late Zifu expert.\u201d The old black bull sighed. \u201cThe path of Immortality includes everything in existence. There are too many techniques\u2026a Zifu Disciple might be weak, but if he had raised millions of terrifying venomous insects, even a Wanxiang Adept might be devoured alive!\u201dNing swallowed a cold breath of air.\u201cBut it\u2019s rare.\u201d The old black bull said hurriedly. \u201cIt\u2019s quite rare for someone of a lower rank to kill someone of a higher rank. For example, someone like you who has such an incredibly powerful soul as well as hundreds of flying swords, and the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]\u2026many factors combined to give you this sort of combat potential. I\u2019m just warning you not to underestimate any opponent. Even Xiantian lifeforms.\u201dNing nodded gently. \u201cUnderstood.\u201dUpon reaching the Zifu Disciple level in particular, no one was easy to deal with.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013In his heart, Ning was still quite joyful. On this trip to the underground estate, he had acquired a killing attack; the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]!\u201cChild Ji Ning.\u201d The old black bull continued, \u201cBefore this, when I watched you attempt the trials, I discovered that the power of your swords is fairly average. Can it be that you aren\u2019t aware of the \u2018Fiendgod Bloodforging\u2019 technique?\u201cFiendgod Bloodforging technique?\u201d Ning blinked. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dThe old black bull couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cIn the Fiendgod Era, virtually all people with a bit of power or clans of a decent size would know about this. This is because every single Fiendgod knew it, and this was something which every single Fiendgod had to learn. I saw that you are clearly a Fiendgod Body Refiner, but you it seemed as though you didn\u2019t know the Bloodforging technique. Naturally, that made me curious.\u201d\u201cSenior, please instruct me.\u201d Ning asked hurriedly.Having an old person at home was like having a treasure.This sort of old man who had lived since the Fiendgod era knew so many things.\u201cFiendgods are not the same as we humans.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cThey don\u2019t train in Ki, and are unable to use magic treasures. However, they need weapons as well. As their strength increased in power, however, how could they find a suitable weapon for them? Thus\u2026the great powers amongst the Fiendgods developed the Fiendgod Bloodforging technique!\u201d\u201cFirst, find a weapon, and then utilize the complicated Rites of Bloodforging! After the bloodforging is completed the weapon will be able to absorb various auras, such as a baleful aura, an evil aura, a killing aura, and other auras. The more enemies you kill, the more powerful the enemies you kill, the more the weapon will naturally strengthen. It can change in size and weight as you please.\u201d\u201cThis sort of weapon is often referred to as a \u2018divine weapon\u2019, a \u2018demonic weapon\u2019, or a \u2018slaying weapon\u2019.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cAs the strength of the master increases, and as the master kills more and more powerful opponents, the strength of the weapon will increase as well, to the point where in the Fiendgod era, some divine weapons and demonic weapons were even more powerful than Immortal-level magic treasures.\u201dNing\u2019s eyes were shining.Right. The heavens were always fair. The Fiendgods were completely unable to use magic weapons, but thus they had some techniques to make weapons for themselves. So it was through absorbing baleful auras and other auras; causing their divine weapons to increase in power through slaughter.\u201cSenior, please teach me.\u201d Ning said hurriedly.\u201cSince I\u2019ve mentioned this to you, of course I will teach you.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cThe Rites of Bloodforging are very complicated. Listen carefully.\u201dThe old black bull stood there, expounding on the process of the Rites of Bloodforging, while at the same time drawing down some diagrams on occasion. Ning just listened and memorized.Why was it known as the Rites of Bloodforging?The primary required ingredient was the blood of Fiendgods. For a human Fiendgod Body Refiner, only the blood of one who had naturally developed divine tattoos while reaching the Xiantian level would suffice, as only then would they have been reborn into the body of a Fiendgod. Only such a person would be able to use the Fiendgod Bloodforging technique. Some of the lower-class Fiendgod Body Refiners were unable to use this bloodforging technique.\u201cHuahuahua\u2026\u201d Ning took out a gourd. This gourd was originally used to store wine. It didn\u2019t look large, but it was able to contain ten thousand kilograms of wine. Ning poured out all of the remaining wine in the gourd, not leaving a single drop behind, and then placed his finger into the gourd.Blood dripped out from his finger, flowing into the gourd.A long time later.\u201cA thousand kilograms of blood is enough.\u201d The old black bull said to the side. \u201cThis bloodforging technique is only usable by Fiendgods. Normal Ki Refiners who lose this much blood will definitely die.\u201dNing sat there in the lotus position. Immediately after having released the blood, the powerful life force in his body naturally began to regenerate his blood. The only thing which was used up was divine power. When the divine power in Ning\u2019s body was reduced to just half, roughly a thousand kilograms of blood had entered the gourd.\u201cThere are seven steps to the rites. You must be sincere.\u201d The old black bull warned.Ning respectfully knelt down and kowtowed three times, and then stood up before kneeling down and kowtowing three more times. He did this eight times, in all eight directions!\u201cHua\u2026\u201d Ning suddenly overturned the gourd in his hand. From within the gourd flowed out a large amount of fresh blood. As soon as it flowed out, it was wrapped up by Ning\u2019s divine will and quickly scattered in an area of roughly two hundred and fifty meters around him. The countless droplets of blood formed into a massive diagram, a diagram of a head with disheveled hair.The diagram completed.Boom! Instantly, a bloody aura that was visible to the naked eye began to shine.\u201cThe descendant kneels in supplication to the Ancestor God.\u201d Ning called out in a loud voice.The first step of the bloodforging rites \u2013 Begging the Ancestor God!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014The complicated Rites of Bloodforging continued for nearly half a day. The bloody light in the area had already formed into a bizarre character. According to what the old black bull had said\u2026this sort of character was known as Fiendgod characters! It was a type of writing which the heavens had naturally given birth to. Although he had never learned it before, the first time he had seen the characters, he understood it.The meaning of this Fiendgod character was\u2026\u2018KILL\u2019!\u201cHuahuahua\u2026\u201d Three Darknorth swords appeared in mid-air. As soon as they appeared, they began to hover there. The weapons which Ning was planning to use the Rites of Bloodforging on were these Darknorth swords! Because, according to what the old black bull had said, although the Fiendgod Bloodforging technique didn\u2019t have very high standards necessary towards weapons, the better the base material was, the better the results would be. Those unranked magic treasures were simply too inferior.Based on the judgment of that old black bull, the Darknorth swords should have previously been Heaven-level magic treasures. Although the runes atop them had been destroyed, the only thing that matter for bloodforging was the physical material components. As for the runes, those were meaningless.\u201cHua!\u201d \u201cHua!\u201d \u201cHua!\u201dThe \u2018Kill\u2019 character formed by the nearby blood began to shoot shadows out from itself, entering the three swords. That enormous \u2018Kill\u2019 character hovering in mid-air began to dim, and then disappeared. The entire hall once more returned to its usual calm.Ning let out a long breath.\u201cSenior.\u201d Ning couldn\u2019t help but say. \u201cJust then, I sensed an awesome presence that seemed even higher than that of the \u2018Dao\u2019\u2026\u201d He had meditated on the Dao before, and had gained a hint of an insight into the aura of the Dao. However, just now, when undergoing the Rites of Bloodforging, that ancient, natural aura that had emanated forth made him feel as though he had touched a powerful, mighty existence which was even more ancient than the Dao.The old black bull sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t dare to say a word during the Rites of Bloodforging. I was completely stunned. Take a look and see how your weapon seems.\u201dWith a wave of his hand, the three Darknorth swords landed in Ning\u2019s grasp. Picking one up with his divine will, he sliced it against his arm. Chi! The skin on his arm, seemingly as tough as leather, began to emit sparks, then finally cracked apart into a wound.\u201cMuch sharper.\u201d Ning was shocked.\u201cYour Darknorth swords were made from good materials.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cRight now, your close combat abilities have increased dramatically. Most peak Xiantian experts won\u2019t be a match for you. In close combat, you are only one or two levels lower in power than when using the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. However, you must understand that you are training in the number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique. Your close combat strength will increase at a monstrous rate. For example, when you train to the sixth stage, your close combat power should completely eclipise the power of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]! Once you then learn a close-combat type \u2018divine ability\u2019, it will become effortless for you to do battle against those at a higher level.\u201dNing\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cElder, do you know any divine abilities?\u201d\u201cDivine abilities? Those are the secrets of the great powers amongst Fiendgods, which are not taught to outsiders.\u201d The old black bull shook his head. \u201cImmortal Juhua only knew a single divine ability; the \u2018Heavenly Transformation\u2019 technique. Unfortunately, I never asked him about it. Alright\u2026given your potential, in the future, you will definitely have the chance to learn a \u2018divine ability\u2019. Once you do, it will be normal for you to fight those at a higher level. That is the power of a true Fiendgod!\u201dNing nodded.He understood. As an Fiendgod Body Refiner, he had a good foundation. In a few years, he would reach the sixth stage. His [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] would also strengthen alongside his soul, and he was very talented. The only problem was that the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] had very high requirements with regards to magic treasures. When he became a Zifu Disciple, he would have to get hundreds of ranked magic treasures\u2026his head hurt just thinking about it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cEnough. You can go back now.\u201d The old black bull said.\u201cThank you so much, Senior.\u201d Ning naturally had packed away the scrolls of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] and the [Inner Visualization of the Shining Sun-Moon Buddha]. Although he himself didn\u2019t need the visualization technique for himself, he could still leave it for his parents or the Ji clan.\u201cYou can go.\u201d The old black bull said.Hua!Ning only felt an enormous illusory grizzly head appear, swallowing him within its maw. Spacetime around him once more distorted. He understood that he was about to return to Serpentwing Lake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was the place he had been teleported from. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh.This event truly had been something he had barely survived.However, in the end, he had lived, and his power was much greater than before as well.\u201cNext time I go in, I\u2019ll need to have first bound this control talisman.\u201d Ning stretched out his hand, and a roughly made talisman appeared within it, with the Fiendgod character for \u2018Right\u2019 embedded on it. Ning had tested binding it, but unfortunately, his Xiantian ki was completely unable to enter it. It seemed as though he absolutely had to wait to become a Zifu Disciple.\u201cRight?\u201d Ning murmured. \u201cWhy is there a \u2018Right\u2019 character on this talisman? I wonder what sort of history it has.\u201dAnd then, Ning pushed it to the back of his mind as he stored the talisman again. With a leap, he moved out from the corridor as agilely and as quickly as a gust of wind.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Serpentwing Lake, within a crude room. Ji Yichuan and his wife were living here.Yuchi Snow was currently quietly seated at the side of the lake. In her hand, she held a cup of boiling hot water, which she was slowly drinking.\u201cSnow, Snow.\u201d Suddenly, a cry of excitement rang out from within the room. Yuchi Snow immediately turned her head to look. The normally glacier-like Yichuan now had his face covered with excitement and joy as he rushed out. On his chest, some drops of water could be seen, with the faint scent of wine.Yuchi Snow, seeing the way her man was acting, had a sense that she knew what had happened. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI can sense it.\u201d Yichuan said hurriedly. \u201cI can sense the jade sword. It is completely unharmed! Previously, Ning definitely must have suddenly entered a secret, hidden area, a small dimension or a small world, or perhaps an ancient formation. He has already come out of that hidden area alive.\u201dEncountering a relic site was a matter of luck, but it also represented an enormous risk! Ning hadn\u2019t left for over a month, and so the two of them had been growing increasingly concerned and increasingly panicked.Yuchi Snow closed her eyes. Two flows of tears came out, and she murmured to herself, \u201cThank the heavens and thank the earth. Thank the heavens and thank the earth.\u201d\u201cHe is currently in the center of Serpentwing Lake, most likely on that island.\u201d Yichuan said hurriedly.\u201cLet\u2019s go see him.\u201d Snow stood up.\u201cRight.\u201d It had been a long time since Yichuan had lost his composure like this. Even when he had learned that his son had broken through to the Xiantian level, he hadn\u2019t been this excited. Immediately, he took his wife by the hand and began running across the surface of the lake as though it were solid land, transforming into a streak of blue mist as he hurried afar.The Azure Firebird couldn\u2019t always be here waiting. After all, that was the spirit-beast of Ji Redflower! In recent days, Yichuan and Snow had been living here, while the Azure Firebird had gone home.Suddenly\u2026\u201cDiremonster Serpentwing, I, Ji Ning, have come again! You still won\u2019t come out?!\u201d A loud roar spread in every direction, including into the ears of Yichuan and his wife, still walking across the surface of the lake.\u201cNing, he\u2026\u201d Yuchi Snow couldn\u2019t help but reveal a hint of a laugh on her face. \u201cAs soon as he leaves that hidden relic site, he immediately once again challenges that Serpentwing.\u201dYichuan nodded. \u201cJi Ning relied on the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] to become a Xiantian, and so he wasn\u2019t that far off from Serpentwing to begin with in power. This time, within that hidden relic site, perhaps he had some certain gains\u2026and now that I can sense his location, there\u2019s no need for any concern.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Snow nodded as well.The two continued to move forward.Soon\u2026\u201cLook!\u201d Yichuan saw from afar, in the distance, the waves of the lake were parted as a youngster was walking directly towards the bottom of the lake. \u201cThat kid has actually parted the waters and is heading directly towards the bottom of the lake.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s going to the bottom of the lake?\u201d Snow was shocked.Yichuan shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be worried. You watched Ning as he grew up. Can it be that you don\u2019t know his temperament? If he wasn\u2019t confident, would he go down?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Snow nodded.\u201cLet\u2019s go over, but we\u2019ll stay on the surface of the lake.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll monitor the situation down below at all times. As soon as anything goes wrong, I will immediately go down.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cDiremonster Serpentwing, I, Ji Ning, have come again! You still won\u2019t come out?!\u201d After calling out while at the surface of the lake, Ning waited for a long time but Serpentwing still did not come out. Ning immediately made the decision to use his power to control fire and water to take command over the water around him in Serpentwing Lake.Huahuahua\u2026.The waters of the lake were parted by an invisible hand, and were parted, revealing a corridor into the water.Ning walked directly towards the bottom of the lake. The deeper he went, the more powerful the water pressure became. Ning directly controlled a cylindrical underwater \u2018corridor\u2019 roughly ten meters across as he walked down through the corridor.\u201cThat\u2019s the one named Ji Ning.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201dThe aquatic lesser monsters within the lake stared from afar as a human walked down through a corridor. All of them once more went to make the report.Serpentwing\u2019s nest.The Diremonster, Serpentwing, had already transformed into human form, and was seated on a chair. He was forcibly suppressing his rage. \u201cThis Ji Ning came over a month ago to challenge me, and now he is challenging me again! The lake is so enormous. If some Xiantian lifeforms are hidden nearby, who would know? I know you have a trap. How could I let myself fall for it?\u201d\u201cGreat king, great king.\u201d\u201cGreat king.\u201dThree lesser aquatic monsters came charging over.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Serpentwing growled.Of the three lesser aquatic monsters, the leader, a prawn monster, hurriedly reported, \u201cGreat king, that Ji Ning suddenly parted the waters and has begun entering the depths of the lake.\u201d\u201cEntering the lake?\u201d Serpentwing suddenly stood up, then immediately said, \u201cWhen he parted the waters, what method did he use?\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t see him use any Xiantian Ki, nor did we see anything special. The waters simply naturally parted.\u201d That prawn monster said hurriedly.Serpentwing said in astonishment, \u201cNo wonder this Ji Ning dared to challenge me in such a way. So he was capable of controlling water as soon as his Fiendgod Body Refining technique reached the Xiantian level. I wonder which type of technique he trains it. Who cares. When I went to the Western Prefecture City, he was only at Houtian level. Now that he has reached the Xiantian level, he is still only at most an early Xiantian!\u201d\u201cHe actually dares to enter the lake!\u201d The long, narrow eyes of Serpentwing were flashing with a ferocious light. \u201cHell has no doors, but you insist on barging in. I, Serpentwing, will naturally grant you your wish and send you to the depths of the eighteenth level of Hell.\u201dSerpentwing immediately charged out of his nest.If they were on the surface of the lake, Serpentwing would be afraid of an ambush. But the bottom of the lake was his territory. Humans who entered it wouldn\u2019t be able to use a tenth of their power; even if Yichuan had entered, he would only at most be able to wound Serpentwing.\u201cJi Ning is actually as stupid as this? It makes sense. He\u2019s just an eleven year old child. His power is great, and so he thinks he is a peerless talent, and he has no regard for anyone. You killed my boy Redtip. I will definitely kill you.\u201d Serpentwing, upon leaving his nest, immediately transformed into his enormous winged serpent form, swimming at high speed.\u201cSo it really is him!\u201dSerpentwing suddenly came to a halt. Staring into the distance, he saw that from afar, Ning was already very close to the bottom of the lake, and a cylindrical downwards corridor was constantly being created, with a human youth slowly walking downwards.\u201cHe really did come to the bottom of the lake.\u201d Serpentwing\u2019s red eyes were filled with a murderous light. \u201cHe really is asking for death.\u201dHua\u2026He quickly swam over.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Ning was wielding the Darknorth sword in his hand, striding on the water as he walked towards the bottom of Serpentwing Lake. Wherever he walked past, the waters of the lake naturally parted to form a corridor.\u201cHrm?\u201d Ning immediately saw that enormous black shadow draw close to him.\u201cSerpentwing!\u201d Ning immediately recognized him. As the enormous black shadow drew near, that ferocious head of Serpentwing\u2019s grew clearer as well. Those scarlet red eyes were staring angrily at Ning.\u201cJi Ning!\u201d Serpentwing let out a furious howl, his voice ringing out. \u201cYou killed my son. Today, I will make you pay for it with your life!\u201dJi Ning roared back, \u201cOld monster, you have slaughtered humans in the thousands. You caused the death of Spring Grass, and today, I will personally execute you!\u201dThe original cause of so many things!So many people had died. Spring Grass had died. All of this came from the enmity between himself and Serpentwing.\u201cHahaha, you will execute me? Little child, you truly don\u2019t know your own limits. You actually dare to come into the depths of the water\u2026once you are within the water, you won\u2019t be able to return to the surface of the lake until your next life!\u201d Serpentwing was supremely confident. \u201cYour father wounded me multiple times, but I will let him share the pain of losing a child with me!\u201dAs soon as his words came to an end, Serpentwing suddenly scurried forward, charging straight towards the corridor which Ning had created.\u201cHua\u2026\u201d First, a serpentine tail pierced into the watery corridor, smashing straight towards Ning. Serpentwing\u2019s current speed and power\u2026was immeasurably greater than the Azure Skysnake\u2019s.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHe lives up to being a peak Xiantian-level Diremonster.\u201d Ning was startled. In terms of speed alone, the late Xiantian-level Serpentwing was actually somewhat weaker than the Azure Skysnake, but in strength he was definitely above the Azure Skysnake. But now, even in terms of his weakness, speed, Serpentwing was superior to the Azure Skysnake.As for his strong point, power, Serpentwing had reached an awe-inducing level.\u201cOld monster, prepare for death!\u201d Ning immediately utilized his Windwing Evasion, transforming into blurred smoke that was even faster than the whipping attack of the serpentine tail of Serpentwing, immediately leaping onto the body of the snake.\u201cRoaaaaaaaaaaar.\u201d Serpentwing turned his head, opening his foul maw and biting down towards Ning.Ning, wielding his Darknorth swords in his hands, leapt up and directly stabbed towards Serpentwing\u2019s serpentine head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Swish! Swish! Swish! Gleaming with black light, the venomous liquid spread out towards Ji Ning, who didn\u2019t dodge at all. The Darknorth sword in his left hand immediately executed the \u2018Watertight\u2019 technique, deflecting the venomous liquid to one side, and it landed on Serpentwing\u2019s own body.\u201cCrackle\u2026\u201d Serpentwing\u2019s scales were immediately set alight, but then afterwards the venomous liquid sank into Serpentwing\u2019s body, absorbed by him.Ning\u2019s left hand had pushed aside the venomous liquid. His right hand was stabbing straight for Serpentwing\u2019s head!His sword flashed like a ray of light!Hua!This sword contained the power of the True Meaning of the Waterdrop, and was so fast that it caused even Serpentwing to be shocked. He hurriedly tried to twist his head away.\u201cRaindrop!\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes were filled with a cold, flashing light. \u201cPIERCES ROCKS!!!\u201dThe sword light flashed straight through the side of Serpentwing\u2019s head, piercing straight through those scales and then burrowing straight through the side of his head. Beneath the injury, one could faintly even see the white skull bone, and an enormous amount of green blood sprayed out from the wound.\u201cHe actually injured me?\u201d The old monster, Serpentwing, went completely berserk. He wildly swung his head, his enormous scaled wings quickly sweeping towards Ning as well, and even his serpentine tail struck out, seeking to constrict Ning. For a moment it seemed as though he had been possessed, and the waters of the lake around them began to bubble and froth.Ning, wielding his two swords, moved like a shadow. \u201cNot only will I injure you, I will kill you!\u201dAlthough Serpentwing was stunned at the power of the swordplay Ning had displayed, he refused to believe that he, an old monster who had been training for a thousand years, would be defeated by this little human child. What\u2019s more, Ning was the one who killed his most beloved child, Redtip\u2026in this moment, Serpentwing had only one thought \u2013 kill Ji Ning!Huahuahua\u2026The waters of the lake swirled about, and the enormous scaled wings as well as that unpredictable serpentine tail attacked wildly. The waters of the lake was the domain of the aquatic monsters, and here, Serpentwing was like a tiger who had been given wings.Using the principles of \u2018using generals against soldiers, using earth to block floods\u2019, Ning continued to use appropriate, matching techniques to deal with the attacks. His sword techniques flashed out, leaving behind one wound after another on the serpentine tail and scaled wings of Serpentwing.\u201cHow is this possible!\u201d\u201cHow can he possibly defeat me!\u201d\u201cDie! Die! Die! I will make you die!\u201d The old monster Serpentwing was now completely berserk.Ning continued to battle against him, and occasionally, with but a glance, he would create a fire lotus petal or a water lotus petal. The fire lotus petal and water lotus petal would appear directly above and below Serpentwing, boxing him within. As the fire lotus petal and water lotus petal slowly swiveled in opposite directions, Serpentwing began to howl as his scales began to crack. \u201cFORM!\u201dAbove his head, a layer of frost rapidly appeared, while at the same time, his serpentine head shook violently, dispersing the Waterflame Lotus.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-They battled wildly within the lake, causing utter chaos. None of the lesser aquatic monsters dared to draw near.Serpentwing\u2019s body was covered with multiple gaping wounds, and green blood oozed everywhere, staining the surrounding lake water green.Above the lake.Ji Yichuan, dressed in white fur, stood there with Yuchi Snow. The entire surface of the lake was shaking wildly, as though deep within the lake, an enormous aquatic monster was shaking.\u201cSuch a large commotion.\u201d Yichuan\u2019s eyes lit up.Snow nodded as well. \u201cIt seems Ning is giving that old monster Serpentwing a great deal of pressure. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be such a large commotion. Look, the water of the lake is turning green, and there are corpses of fishes and prawns.\u201d The nearby undulating waters of the lake were beginning to have corpses of fish and prawns float on the surface. Clearly, they had been poisoned.Yichuan took a sniff with his nose. \u201cThis is the blood of Serpentwing. His blood is highly venomous. Even after having been diluted by the lake water, most fish and prawns will be poisoned to death by it.\u201d\u201cHe has lost so much blood.\u201d Snow\u2019s amusement became even more pronounced. \u201cNing\u2019s power has improved greatly.\u201d\u201cRight. To let a peak Xiantian-level old monster like Serpentwing lose so much blood is indeed very impressive.\u201d Yichuan was very eager as well.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Serpentwing had already used all the power available to him, but he still had yet to even injure Ning. Instead, his body was now covered with wounds, all inflicted by the sharp Darknorth swords in Ning\u2019s hands.\u201cAfter I reached the peak Xiantian stage, in this area controlled by the Ji clan, there\u2019s only a few people more powerful than me! All of them are extremely famous\u2026how could this punk Ji Ning be so powerful? Most likely, not even that Ji Lee is a match for him.\u201d Serpentwing, after going berserk for a time, had calmed down, and had begun to plan for a retreat.The power Ning had displayed truly was astonishing.As an old monster, Serpentwing\u2019s body was naturally powerful\u2026the sword attacks of most Xiantian-level Ki Refiners probably wouldn\u2019t even break through his scales. But Ning\u2019s swords were incomparably sharp! They sliced right through, leaving massive wounds, or pierced right through, gouging great holes.\u201cIn a few more years, won\u2019t this Ji Ning be even more powerful than his father?\u201d The rage in Serpentwing\u2019s heart was quickly dissipating, leaving behind only terror and alarm. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to outfight a freak like him. I\u2019d best flee!\u201dSwoosh!With a shake of his serpentine tail and a turn of his serpentine head, the two scaled wings began to tremble\u2026and Serpentwing began to attempt to flee at high speed.\u201cOld monster Serpentwing, don\u2019t even think about fleeing!\u201d Ning, currently standing on Serpentwing\u2019s body, simultaneously controlled the corridor of water while utilizing the Windwing Evasion technique rapidly.\u201cIf I want to leave, I\u2019ll leave.\u201d Serpentwing bellowed. With a shake of his tail, the waters of the lake immediately grew turbulent, and a surge of water immediately drenched Ning.Immediately afterwards, Serpentwing felt extremely delighted.A corridor formed by controlling water? Serpentwing was an aquatic monster who could also control water. To destroy it would naturally be extremely easy. If he wasn\u2019t able to beat Ning, could it be that he also wouldn\u2019t be able to flee?\u201cHuh?\u201d Serpentwing suddenly, vaguely felt a terrifying threat appear. He couldn\u2019t help but to turn his head and look.In the lake waters behind him, Ning was currently standing upright and floating, surrounded by countless sword-type magic treasures. Every single one of them was covered with a faintly glowing light. A glowing sword of light formed from Xiantian ki that had been passed through and transformed by over three hundred flying sword magic treasures was currently hovering next to Ning, flickering.\u201cMagic treasures? So many magic treasures?\u201d Serpentwing was stunned.Swish!The glowing sword of light flashed, instantly traversing hundreds of meters. Serpentwing could sense that this glowing sword of light contained boundless power. He wanted to turn his head to dodge it, but the glowing sword of light only curved slightly when arcing, and thus still pierced with great precision straight through the center of Serpentwing\u2019s serpentine head.Bang!The sword of light pierced straight through Serpentwing\u2019s skull, carrying with it green blood as well as some brain tissue.\u201cAaaaah!\u201d Serpentwing stared at Ning in astonishment. \u201cThis formation, formation\u2026\u201d\u201cYou should feel honored that you died beneath this sword formation.\u201d Ning slowly walked over, and the waters of the lake parted before him. Serpentwing\u2019s eyes grew dim, and then his enormous body began to slowly drift downwards\u2026This old monster of Serpentwing Lake, who had been treated as a local tyrant for thousands of years, had died!Watching the corpse of Serpentwing slowly drift down, Ning had very complicated feelings in his heart. It was this old monster who had gone to Western Prefecture City to attack him\u2026resulting in this chain of events. When he had gone out adventuring and exploring, he had treated Serpentwing as his ultimate goal. Although Serpentwing had broken through to the peak Xiantian level in power, Ning had still executed him!\u201cCollect.\u201d Ning grabbed Serpentwing\u2019s enormous corpse. With but a thought, he stored it into an empty storage-type magic treasure. Although Serpentwing\u2019s corpse was massive, when rolled up, it could still fit into one of the storage-type magic treasures. Although Ning didn\u2019t have many other things, he had nearly a thousand storage-type magic treasures.\u201cTime to go back up.\u201d With but a thought, the waters parted above him, and Ning began to walk upwards.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Yichuan and Snow were standing atop the lake, waiting.\u201cNo more movement?\u201d Snow looked at the slowly calming waters. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on down there any longer.\u201d\u201cSerpentwing was most likely unable to do anything to Ning.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cThus, he probably retreated. This battle has come to an end.\u201dSnow looked at her man. \u201cCan\u2019t it be that Ning executed that old monster?\u201d\u201cExecuted? In the water, that old monster can battle when he wants and flee when he wants. Beating him is easy, but executing him? Hard, hard, hard.\u201d Yichuan had personally fought with Serpentwing a few times. He couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. But then his eyes lit up, and he stared into the distance. \u201cLook. Ji Ning is coming out.\u201dSnow turned to look as well.From afar was the island in the center of Serpentwing Lake. A white wave was rising up next to the island, and the wave then parted, creating a corridor. A youth dressed in beast furs was walking through the waves, heading straight for the island.\u201cNing!\u201d Snow immediately called out.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Ning had been walking on the waves and heading for the island, but in his ears, he suddenly heard that familiar call. \u201cNing!\u201d\u201cMother?\u201d Ning was stunned, and he hurriedly turned to look.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFrom afar, he saw Ji Yichuan, dressed in white furs, and Yuchi Snow. They were rapidly running towards him on water. This sight caused Ning to be both astonished and delighted.Yichuan and Snow landed on the island.\u201cNing.\u201d As soon as she had arrived, Snow immediately grabbed her son by the hand, carefully inspecting him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Even if Ji Ning was wounded, given the strength of his Fiendgod body, he will quickly recover.\u201d Yichuan looked towards Ning, his eyes filled with satisfaction. \u201cTo be able to battle with a peak Xiantian-level Diremonster and cause him, Serpentwing, to flee helplessly\u2026Ning, you have improved even more than I predicted.\u201dNing was startled, and then he quickly said, \u201cFather, I executed the Diremonster, Serpentwing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The two of them knew that their son wasn\u2019t the type of person to tell lies, but this was simply too\u2026when the experts of the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan had battled Serpentwing numerous times, they hadn\u2019t been able to execute Serpentwing.Ji Ning said hurriedly, \u201cFather, please look.\u201d With a wave of his hand, out of nowhere, an enormous thing covered in wounds appeared in the pool next to them. Those enormous scaled wings, that viscous green blood\u2026they all testified to this creature\u2019s identity.\u201cSerpentwing?\u201d\u201cSerpentwing?\u201dYichuan and Snow looked at the enormous corpse. They couldn\u2019t help but exchange a glance.\u201cIt seems my son\u2019s strength\u2026his strength is quite extraordinary.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cNot only did he kill Serpentwing, he also was able to store Serpentwing\u2019s corpse within storage-type magic treasures.\u201d\u201cFather. Mother.\u201d Ning didn\u2019t hide anything. \u201cWhen I was adventuring at Eastmount Marsh, I encountered the Ironwood clan\u2019s Ironwood Zhan.\u201dYichuan and Snow were both startled.Ironwood Zhan?That was a dangerous foe.\u201cHe probably was there to deal with the Azure Skysnake to try and force it to become his slave.\u201d Ning said. At this point, he began to sigh a bit as he thought back to how he and the Azure Skysnake had battled repeatedly with each other, with the two being unable to harm each other, and how slowly, they began to build respect for each other as opponents. In the end, as he did not find the Azure Skysnake\u2019s corpse within Ironwood Zhan\u2019s storage treasures, nor did he see the Azure Skysnake become a tamed slave, Ning understood that the Azure Skysnake, at that critical juncture, had probably developed its natural ability, \u2018Void Blink\u2019.An Azure Skysnake who had developed the Void Blink technique was like a carp who had transformed into a dragon! It had definitely left the Swallow Mountain area to roam the world in search of natural treasures\u2026It was hard to say if they would ever meet again.Ning quickly returned to his senses. \u201cWhen Ironwood Zhan battled the Azure Skysnake, I took the chance to flee, and I fled over a thousand kilometers out of the mountain forests\u2026and by the side of a pool, as I rested, I was lucky enough to suddenly gain an understanding of the Dao.\u201d\u201cAn understanding of the Dao?\u201d Yichuan and his wife exchanged glances. They held their breaths.\u201cI spent an entire night comprehending the Dao, but I didn\u2019t expect that in the end, I was disrupted by the pursuing Ironwood Zhan.\u201d Ning shook his head. \u201cHowever, in my fury, I immediately utilized the Yin and Yang power, fusing it into the Crimsonbright divine power. Heavenly water and fire descended upon me, transforming me into a Xiantian Fiendgod\u2019s body as I became a Xiantian lifeform. At that time, my power dramatically increased, and I then first killed Ironwood Zhan\u2019s spirit-beast, that Bi\u2019An Tiger, and then Ironwood Zhan himself!\u201dYichuan said in surprise, \u201cYou killed Ironwood Zhan?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Ning waved his hand, and within it appeared a black rattan whip. \u201cThis is Ironwood Zhan\u2019s personal weapon.\u201dUpon seeing the Blackwood Vinewhip, Yichuan nodded and sighed in approval. \u201cThis is indeed his Blackwood Vinewhip. As soon as you reached the Xiantian level, you defeated and slayed Ironwood Zhan. It seems as though that night you spent comprehending the Dao helped you improve quite substantially.\u201dNing nodded. \u201cThat night, as I comprehended the Dao, I gained insight into a hint of the True Meaning of the Dao.\u201d\u201cThe True Meaning of the Dao?\u201d Even Snow called out in shock.\u201cWas it truly the True Meaning of the Dao?\u201d Yichuan didn\u2019t dare to believe it either.In raising one\u2019s level of enlightenment, the higher one went, the harder it became.Above the level of \u2018one with the world\u2019 was the \u2018True Meaning of the Dao\u2019! Even most Zifu Disciples hadn\u2019t reached the \u2018True Meaning of the Dao\u2019 level! Yichuan, in the past, had only managed to reach this level thanks to special circumstances, and in addition, this was something which the Ji clan had held as a secret and never made public. Others only believed Yichuan to be at the \u2018one with the world\u2019 level.\u201cMy son is only eleven.\u201d Snow\u2019s eyes were shining. \u201cBut he\u2019s actually reached the level of the \u2018True Meaning of the Dao\u2019, and is training in what is acknowledged as the number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. With this sort of talent, it would be exceptionally easy for him to be accepted for tutelage by some of the major powers.\u201d\u201cNo rush, no rush.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cAre you able to actually utilize the True Meaning of the Dao that you comprehended?\u201dComprehension was one thing, but being able to utilize it was another thing altogether.At the ancient aquatic estate, Ning had been in a near-lethal situation when he finally managed to execute the \u2018True Meaning of the Raindrop\u2019.\u201cFather, please watch.\u201d The Darknorth swords appeared in Ning\u2019s hands, and he shot a sword into the air. Hua! The tip of the sword seemed like a drop of rain, causing the air around it to ripple violently.\u201cTrue Meaning of the Raindrop!\u201d Yichuan nodded repeatedly. \u201cThis is the True Meaning of the Raindrop. That night you spent comprehending the Dao allowed you to be able to put the True Meaning of the Dao on display through your swordplay? This is\u2026this is\u2026\u201d Yichuan didn\u2019t even know what to say. Swallow Mountain, at least, had never seen such a monstrous talent.Most likely, only in those distant, super-massive tribes would an equivalent talent exist.\u201cI was only able to comprehend the True Meaning of the Raindrop in a hidden area.\u201d Ning said. \u201cI imagine, Father and Mother, that you both knew that I was trapped within a hidden area.\u201dThe couple hurriedly nodded.\u201cYour son suddenly disappeared, and caused you such worry, Father, Mother\u2026\u201d Ning, after seeing his parents, quickly understood this. His father had no doubt been unable to sense the jade sword, and thus had frantically rushed over. After all, the aquatic palace was in a completely different dimension. How could his father sense the jade sword there? At that time, most likely his father was worried that he was dead. Ning could completely guess at how his father and mother had felt, having been worried for so long. He couldn\u2019t help but feel rather ashamed.\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d Yichuan sighed. \u201cWhen I was adventuring back in the day, I saw multiple relic sites, but never entered them. Although relic sites offer great opportunities, perhaps not even one out of a hundred will come out of a site alive. Your mother and I are very happy that you came out of it alive.\u201dSnow gently rubbed her son\u2019s hair as well.Over this past month, she truly had been very worried.\u201cBut I imagine in that hidden area, your gains were quite substantial. You were actually able to execute Serpentwing in one encounter.\u201d Yichuan said. He didn\u2019t believe that his son would be able to kill Serpentwing solely after having comprehended the True Meaning of the Raindrop. After all, Yichuan himself had long ago gained insight into the True Meaning of the Raindrop. In addition, Yichuan had merged every single one of the nine sword techniques of the [Raindrop Sutra] with the True Meaning of the Raindrop, and yet was still unable to kill Serpentwing.\u201cRight. I received the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].\u201d With a wave of his hand, Ning retrieved those multiple pieces of fur parchment, offering them to his parents.Although the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] was a secret, there was no need for Ning to hide anything from his parents.\u201c[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]?\u201d Yichuan and his wife both took a look, but as soon as they did, their faces changed.\u201cThis, this\u2026\u201d Yichuan and his wife were completely stunned. They were quite experienced, especially Snow, whose lineage was extraordinary. They were quickly able to tell how special this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] was.Yichuan couldn\u2019t refrain from saying, \u201cThis [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] is even more powerful than any of the \u2018ultimate techniques\u2019 of our Ji clan. Snow, this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] is most likely comparable to your tribe\u2019s [Windwing Evasion] technique.\u201dOff to one side, Ning couldn\u2019t help but sigh.That which Fiendgod Body Refiners needed most was divine abilities! But every single divine ability, even in the Fiendgod era, was not permitted to be taught to outsiders. Not even the old black bull in that ancient aquatic estate had known any. It was only because the Yuchi clan had helped that Celestial Immortal and saved his life that they had gained a \u2018divine ability\u2019. The value of a divine ability was perhaps even greater than that of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]! Fortunately, his mother had given this \u2018divine ability\u2019 to him, as otherwise, who knows how long it would have taken before he would have had a chance to learn his first divine ability?\u201cThis [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] possesses extraordinary power. It is a peerless formation technique that can allow a person to battle at a higher level of power.\u201d Yuchi Snow said. \u201cOnly, the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] has very high requirements for magic treasures as well as the soul. This is its weakness.\u201d\u201cRight. Several hundred magic treasures. Who can acquire so many?\u201d Yichuan nodded as well.But Ning said, \u201cFather, Mother, in the hidden area, I acquired many unranked magic treasures. Simply too many.\u201d As he spoke, he brought out the storage armguard and gave it to his parents, while at the same time, Ning withdrew all of his personal ki from within the magic treasures, so as to allow others to more easily bind them.\u201d\u201cToo many?\u201d Yichuan accepted the armguard, puzzled. He quickly bound the armguard, and as soon as he investigated it, he couldn\u2019t help but reveal a look of shock.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Snow immediately asked.\u201cThe number of magic treasures\u2026is most likely in the thousands.\u201d Yichuan sighed.\u201cSo many!\u201d Snow was shocked as well. Although they didn\u2019t care about unranked magic treasures, there were \u2018thousands\u2019 of them within. Even the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan would be envious of such a fortune.Ning added, \u201cThose magic treasures are useless to me. I\u2019ll hand them to Father and Mother for you to dispose.\u201d He had dozens of storage treasures and over a thousand sword-type magic treasures, as well as various other scattered magic treasures, such as wing-type magic treasures\u2026which was very suited for him to train in the [Windwing Evasion] technique. The scattered treasures also included some Dao-seals, formations, and others items.As for the thousands of storage treasures, blades, whips, staffs, spears, and axes, he might as well give all of those to his father.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Ning had first acquired the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], then shown off so many magic treasures. His parents had yet to fully recover, before Ning spoke once more. \u201cThis time, in the hidden area, I acquired a treasure. This will be of true benefit to our Ji clan.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Yichuan and Snow immediately looked over.With a wave of Ning\u2019s hand, a beast fur scroll appeared. Atop the beast fur scroll, a sun and a moon hung high in the sky, sparkling with boundless light down upon a Buddha.\u201cA visualization technique!\u201d Yichuan and Snow simultaneously spoke out.Ning said with surprise, \u201cFather, Mother, you know already?\u201d\u201cHow could we not know?\u201d Snow stared at the painting of the Buddha. \u201cIn the past, my Yuchi clan also had a Visualization painting, but afterwards, the Visualization painting was lost in a struggle with another tribe. But Ning, this visualization technique is a technique which can allow one to strengthen the soul. The soul is a person\u2019s foundation. While normally it is hard to see the benefits of a strong soul, the benefits are invisible and tremendous. You should leave this with you and use it at all times.\u201dNing hurriedly said, \u201cIn the hidden area, I was fortunate enough to have a Visualization painting imprinted directly into my memory! It is even clearer than this!\u201dSnow, understanding the situation, said joyfully, \u201cMy son\u2019s karmic luck is extraordinary. According to legends, the ancestor of my Yuchi clan met a Celestial Immortal, who with but a single finger point imprinted the Visualization painting directly into his soul. It was even clearer than the painting, and it could be visualized at all times. I didn\u2019t expect that in this hidden area, my son would also have such a stroke of fortune.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing thought back to how, while he was being reincarnated, he had run into the Lord of Cui Palace in the Netherworld Kingdom, and how the Lord of Cui Palace had also used a single finger to imprint the [Nuwa Painting] into his soul\u2019s memory.\u201cFather, Mother, the name of this visualization technique is the [Inner Visualization of the Sun-Moon Buddha].\u201d Ning added.\u201cJi Ning.\u201dYichuan\u2019s heart was pounding as he looked at his son. \u201cThis [Inner Visualization of the Sun-Moon Buddha] will have a long-lasting impact on the Ji clan. I will immediately take it back. However, this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] should not be publicized for now. It is too hard to train in, and aside from you, no one in the Ji clan is capable of bringing forth the power of this [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. After your own strength improves in the future, you yourself can decide whether or not you want to publicize it. As for those unranked magic treasures, I will help you dispose of them.\u201d\u201cLet it all be as you decide, Father.\u201d Ning replied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9 \u2013 The Marquis of StillwaterJi Yichuan looked at his wife. \u201cSnow, Ji Ning\u2019s strength can be considered at the absolute top for all below the Zifu Disciple level. The Swallow Mountain region is unable to contain him any further.\u201dSnow nodded as well. She understood what her man was saying.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ji Ning looked at his parents, somewhat puzzled.Yichuan said, \u201cJi Ning, you should know about the six great powers here at Swallow Mountain.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Ning nodded. \u201cSwallow Mountain has six local hegemons. They are our Ji clan, the Riverbank clan, the Kou clan, the Blackfire Cult, the Ironwood clan, and Snowdragon Mountain. Of the six hegemons, our Ji clan, the Riverbank clan, the Kou clan, and the Blackfire Cult are allies, while the Ironwood clan and the Snowdragon Mountain are allied!\u201dThe six major hegemons of Swallow Mountain were arrayed into two alliances, and the battles between them were very fierce, with Xiantian lifeforms often dying.Yichuan continued, \u201cBut are you aware of the reason as to why the alliance between the Ironwood clan and Snowdragon Mountain is capable of forcing us other four hegemons to ally together?\u201d\u201cI am not.\u201d Ning shook his head.These secrets were not recorded in any books.\u201cThe six great powers are all guarded by Zifu Disciples.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cYour power is most likely already invincible against anyone below the Zifu Disciple level. In a few more years, you will most likely become a Zifu Disciple, so I must tell you these things now!\u201d\u201cThat Ironwood clan is not worth mentioning!\u201d Yichuan said seriously, his eyes filled with a murderous light. \u201cBut the Snowdragon Mountain is a truly formidable enemy. They are truly frightening. In our Swallow Mountain region, Snowdragon Mountain is merely a single branch of the true Snowdragon Mountain Sect.\u201d\u201cA branch?\u201d Ning was stunned.Of the six hegemons, Snowdragon Mountain was the most powerful force. But this Snowdragon Mountain was merely a branch?Yichuan looked at his son and said solemnly, \u201cThe power of the Snowdragon Mountain Sect is thousands of times greater than that of Swallow Mountain\u2019s Snowdragon Mountain Branch, and thousands of times greater than our Ji clan! This is a colossal, top-tier clan which is not inferior than your mother\u2019s Yuchi clan!\u201dYuchi Snow looked at her son as well. \u201cThe [Windwing Evasion] includes the history of my Yuchi clan. My Yuchi clan is an extremely ancient, top-tier large clan. Clans like the Ji clan\u2026are completely incomparable to the likes of my Yuchi clan. But of course, that was all in the past.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Ning, hearing his parents speak of these things, instantly had a desire to learn more about this boundless world. The Yuchi clan, Snowdragon Mountain, and those legendary, distant top-tier clans. They were all so far away from Swallow Mountain.\u201cNing, do you know how large the Grand Xia Dynasty is, exactly?\u201d Snow looked at her son.\u201cI do not.\u201d Ning shook his head.The Grand Xia Dynasty had been founded in the Fiendgod Era, and had destroyed other ancient dynasties to unify this vast world. It had existed for trillions of years! The books which described the territory of the Grand Xia Dynasty all used the same word: Boundless!How enormous would such a dynasty be? How deep would its roots be?\u201cWhen the Grand Xia Dynasty unified the world, it divided the world into 3600 commanderies, and also assigned 800 Marquises!\u201d Snow said slowly. \u201cBecause the world is simply too vast, even Immortals and Fiends found it difficult to govern it. Thus, they divided it into 3600 commanderies. Amongst these 3600 commanderies, there are large ones and small ones, but even the smallest are extremely vast.\u201d\u201cSwallow Mountain is under the governance of the Stillwater Commandery, which is the territory ruled over by the Marquis of Stillwater.\u201d Snow said. \u201cThe commandery city of Stillwater is nearly a million kilometers away from us.\u201d\u201cThe commandery city of Stillwater? A million kilometers away from us?\u201d Ning could completely imagine how in that distant, distant region, there was an incomparably ancient, vast, and bustling city. In that place, Immortals and Fiends congregated, their decisions impacting this entire enormous region.Snow continued, \u201cThe commandery city of Stillwater is the seat of power for the entire Stillwater Commandery, a place where Immortals and Fiends reside. However, Stillwater Commandery is simply too vast, and there are tens of thousands of regions within it like our Swallow Mountain\u2026thus, some of the most top tier clans, schools, and sects are all scattered throughout the area!\u201d\u201cAs large as that?\u201d Ning held his breath.\u201cAs the saying goes, the heavens are high and the ruler is far away. With the world divided into 3600 commanderies, the power of those Marquises in the territory they rule is absolutely monstrous.\u201d Snow sighed. \u201cThe imperial city of the Grand Xia Dynasty is simply too far away. In history, there have even been some Marquises who rebelled. Those wars truly are wars where Immortals and Fiends slaughter each other and countless experts fall. Truly terrifying.\u201dNing nodded.The flaw of having an enormous territory was the difficulty one would have in governing it. Even the high and mighty Marquis of Stillwater was unable to completely govern his vast territory, and so he allowed the various tribes to slaughter and battle each other.\u201cAfter some of the Marquises revolted, the Grand Xia Dynasty, so as to better govern the various regions, began to frantically build one commandery city after another in the various commanderies, and even Swallow Mountain has over ten of these commandery cities.\u201d Snow looked at her son. \u201cEvery single city has a matching \u2018official writ\u2019!\u201d\u201cOfficial writ?\u201d Ning listened carefully.\u201cRight. Official writ!\u201d Snow continued. \u201cBy binding an official writ, that means you are in control of one of those commandery cities, and are in name one of the officials of the Grand Xia Dynasty. However, these official writs are ranked magic treasures, and thus only Zifu Disciples and above can bind them.\u201d\u201cSwallow Mountain has ten of these commanderies within it.\u201d Yichuan spoke out as well.\u201cOf the ten commandery cities, one is Swallow Mountain City, where the armies of the Grand Xia Dynasty are stationed! Of the other nine cities, our Five Prefectures of the Ji clan is in control of one, the \u2018Thousand Swords City\u2019 of our Central Prefecture.\u201d Yichuan explained. \u201cThe Riverbank clan, Kou clan, and Ironwood clan all have one as well.\u201d\u201cThe Blackfire Cult has two commandery cities. Snowdragon Mountain has three commandery cities.\u201d\u201cActually, long ago, the Ji clan, the Riverbank clan, the Kou clan, the Blackfire Cult, and the Ironwood clan all were considered part of the local tribes of Swallow Mountain.\u201d Yichuan sighed. \u201cAfterwards, when Snowdragon Mountain acquired one of the official writs for one of the cities and got involved in this region, the Ironwood clan, the weakest of the clans, quickly threw themselves in with Snowdragon Mountain. However, we other four powers continue to resist.\u201d\u201cWe are all officials of the Grand Xia Dynasty, and within our own commandery cities, it is forbidden for Immortal practitioners to battle each other. To disobey this rule is to challenge the Grand Xia Dynasty, punishable by death!\u201dNing, hearing his father\u2019s explanation, couldn\u2019t help but frown. \u201cFather, Mother, based on what you are saying, if Immortal practitioners are forbidden from battling within the commandery cities on pain of death, would it be very hard for one tribe to try and destroy another one?\u201d\u201cHard?\u201dSnow laughed coldly. \u201cEasy! For example, Zifu Disciples have a limited lifespan. Upon death, the official writ becomes an ownerless object, at which point, the tribe will quickly collapse.\u201d\u201cAlso, Zifu Disciples can\u2019t always stay within their commanderies. As long as they come out and are killed, then their official writs can be seized and their tribe will be finished.\u201d\u201cAnd then of course, there are some utterly lawless, large, powerful clans!\u201d Snow said. \u201cThey will send people over to your commanderyity to assassinate the Zifu Disciples of your clan and take away your official writ. What can you do about it?\u201dNing was stunned. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cWithout any proof, what will you do?\u201d Snow laughed. \u201cBut of course, the mightier a power, the more cautious they will be. Challenging the laws of the Grand Xia Dynasty is a capital offense. They wouldn\u2019t casually do such a thing, and even if they decide to, they would use some very secretive methods. All I am trying to tell you is that there are many possible ways to destroy a tribe. You might not make trouble for others, but they might for you. In the end, the most important thing is strengthening one\u2019s self!\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cThe Marquis of Stillwater controls this vast region, but aside from the armies of the Grand Xia Dynasty stationed here, there is another squad of Immortal practitioners, known as the \u2018Raindragon Guards\u2019. According to legend, only Wanxiang Adepts are allowed to join the Raindragon Guards! By relying on the Raindragon Guards, the Grand Xia Dynasty is able to better control its vast territory. Remember. The Raindragon Guards cannot be trifled with.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cNing, given your talent and comprehension, you would find it very easy to request tutelage under a major power. After you go out adventuring, it would be best for you to find a major school or power to take shelter under.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Yichuan and Snow told their son many things. They knew that Ning would definitely advance onto a far greater stage, and perhaps even become a major figure in the entire Stillwater Commandery\u2026naturally, they carefully instructed and warned him, telling him everything which they knew.Only now did Ning truly understand how vast the world was. Only now did he know about the Raindragon Guards of the Grand Xia Dynasty, all formed from Immortal practitioners. Of the great army controlled by the Marquis of Stillwater. Of some of the top tier clans, schools, sects\u2026and of course, many other clans that were powerful in their own localities, that had been able to control official writs for a long period of time. Below them, of course, were countless, innumerable minor tribes.\u201cWhew.\u201d Ning\u2019s heart was beginning to fill with ardor.\u201cJi Ning, I will take away the corpse of Serpentwing. To outsiders, we shall simply say that I was the one to kill him.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cAfter all, you are very young. If we were to publicize that you were the one who killed him, it will only cause endless difficulties.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let Father handle all of these things.\u201d Ning said hurriedly. \u201cRight, Father, I want to build a residence here at Serpentwing Lake. In the future, I will often live here.\u201d\u201cLive here?\u201dYichuan and Snow looked around them. This area was very peaceful.\u201cRight. This is a good place.\u201d Yichuan nodded. \u201cI will arrange for some people to help you build a residence here. Your mother and I will go back now. While adventuring, come back and visit us often.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI will. I will go back to West Prefecture City in a few days.\u201d Ning nodded. He was going to take a trip to the Blacktooth Tribe to bring Spring Grass\u2019 younger brother to West Prefecture City. This was the promise he had made to Spring Grass.\u201cHurry back.\u201d Snow gently stroked her son\u2019s head.\u201cRight.\u201d Ning nodded. He understood that this trip he had made into the Aquatic Manor had caused his parents great worry.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014That day, Ning led Autumn Leaf and Mowu back to the Blacktooth Tribe, mounted on their black beasts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10 \u2013 [Nine Scrolls On Formations]The journey from Serpentwing Lake to the Blacktooth Tribe was a long one. Even with the black beasts travelling all day and only resting at night, three days time was needed.Night time.The campfire was blazing. Ji Ning and Autumn Leaf were by the side of the campfire, while Mowu was on watch, so as to not allow any impudent wild beasts to interrupt his young master.\u201cI haven\u2019t had the chance to take a good look at the miscellaneous items I acquired in the Aquatic Manor.\u201d Ning suddenly remembered that although he had gone through all those magic treasures he had acquired during the first and second trials, of the thousands of magic treasures and miscellaneous items he had acquired at the third trial, he had bound them then immediately battled that black-furred golem, then met with that old black bull. He hadn\u2019t had any time to flip through them at all.\u201cOne of the miscellaneous items I found in the first or second trial was a secret manual that is nearly as good as the [Raindrop Sutra]. The number of miscellaneous items in the third trial was several times greater than in the first two.\u201d With a wave of his hand, Ning brought out one item after another, which he then made disappear afterwards.Autumn Leaf just watched to the side, curious.A long time later\u2026\u201cYet another secret manual, the [Clearwind Manual]?\u201d Ning flipped through it, and was instantly delighted. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a swordplay manual, and it directly instructs one in how to utilize the True Meaning of the Dao. It is comparable to the [Raindrop Sutra].\u201dNing\u2019s judgment and vision was much keener than before. After all, he had gained insights into the True Meaning of the Dao, and as he carefully read the contents, he quickly could vaguely sense that the ultimate goal of this type of swordplay was to develop the \u2018True Meaning of the Clearwind\u2019.Actually, the deceased people in the corridor were all only at the Xiantian level, so how powerful or profound could the manuals they were carrying on them possibly be? Actually, a consummate skill such as the [Clearwind Manual], logically speaking, shouldn\u2019t even be in there. For example, Ning hadn\u2019t brought the [Raindrop Sutra] or the [Thunderflame Sword] with him. From this, one could tell that the previous master of this manual most likely came from an even more powerful, top-tier clan who didn\u2019t restrict manuals on this level too tightly.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013There really were many miscellaneous items in the third trials, and plenty of treasures as well. Ning found as many as three powerful techniques! After flipping through these manuals, Ning began to carefully inspect the other miscellaneous items, the ones that didn\u2019t look like manuals.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ning suddenly flipped out a jade carving!This was two foot long square piece of jade, and on the jade there was carved an image of an old man with a long beard.\u201cWait!\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes lit up, and he carefully inspected it. At first glance, he had thought that this was just a carving, but as he took a closer look\u2026he felt as though the square jade piece was actually covered with countless small characters that formed some small images. These characters were the characters used in the Grand Xia Dynasty.The characters were tiny! If an ordinary person saw it, they probably wouldn\u2019t even notice it, but Ning was no ordinary person. His visual acuity was astonishing, and he could see a housefly from a distance of ten kilometers! With such visual acuity, naturally he could read the dense, tiny characters on the jade carving.\u201cHow marvelous.\u201d\u201cThis piece of jade has hundreds of thousands of words carved onto it, and the countless works actually formed the image of a long-bearded elder.\u201d Ning first exhaled in amazement, and then he began to search for the place where these characters originated. Soon, he found that in the leftmost upper corner, there were four prominent characters\u2026[Nine Scrolls on Formations]!Ning\u2019s eyes lit up as he carefully continued to read.\u201cI, Wu Daoyan, have focused exclusively on formation techniques for over eighty thousand years. I was lucky enough to survive the last tribulation, but I think that the next great tribulation in nine hundred years time, I will not be able to survive. I am unwilling for the essence of my formation techniques to be lost, and so I have recorded down the knowledge of my formation techniques within these nine scrolls! I hope that someone with the right karmic fortune will carefully learn and comprehend it!\u201d The opening words caused Ning to feel delighted. Anyone who was capable of living eighty thousand years and yet still be subject to the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations was almost certainly a Loose Immortal.Immortal Juhua was able to live for millions of years, but most Loose Immortals weren\u2019t able to live that long. Three Calamities, Nine Tribulations; the calamities were easy to avoid, but the tribulations were hard to escape. A great tribulation every nine hundred years! Each tribulation more powerful than the last, continuously accumulating until even a Loose Immortal like of Immortal Juhua, on par with a Celestial Immortal, would not be able to withstand it.\u201cThe knowledge of a Loose Immortal regarding formation techniques. This is something that is no less valuable than the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] or the [Windwing Evasion].\u201d Ning immediately understood how valuable this was. \u201cWith this knowledge regarding formations, someone actually went to enter the trials of the underground estate\u2019s corridors. Jeeze\u2026\u201dThe person who acquired this knowledge on formations was most likely someone who was unskilled in formations. After all, the abstruse mysteries of formations were very hard to comprehend. Generally speaking, Immortal practitioners only knew how to set up formations; they didn\u2019t understand the principles behind the formations. For example, Ning only knew how to set up and control the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. Immortal practitioners would generally prefer to spend their time in binding more powerful magic treasures, or more powerful magic techniques. Those who would lower their heads and study formations were indeed very rare!And what\u2019s more, formations were extremely abstruse and hard to understand, making researchers in formations even rarer!Most likely, the person who received this didn\u2019t understand it. Even up until the point of his death, he still hadn\u2019t had any accomplishments, and thus he had gone to attempt the underground estate.There was another possibility as well, that it was someone like Ning\u2026someone who accidentally entered Serpentwing Lake and thus was forcibly teleported into the Aquatic Manor, then died within.\u201cNo matter what happened, this [Nine Scrolls on Formations] is now mine. And here I was, wondering how it could be possible that, given there were thousands of storage treasures, signifying thousands of people, how could not a single one of them been carrying something truly valuable?\u201d Ning said to himself joyfully. \u201cI finally acquired a valuable treasure. Time to take a good look.\u201dHe immediately lowered his head and began to read this [Nine Scrolls on Formations].Formations could be set up using all sorts of things, and some truly miraculous, large-scale formations could even make the world itself part of the formation!\u201cInteresting.\u201d Many people felt that the [Nine Scrolls on Formations] were dry and boring, but Ning began to smile as he read them. Formations required a high ability to compute and understand. One had to be able to calculate! Ning, in his previous life, was exceedingly smart. Because of his illness, he was unable to go to school, so he had to teach himself everything! He had taught himself through reading books online, and his knowledge had far outstripped those of the same age as him, especially in the sciences. Despite his young age, he had earned a vast fortune!In this life, he had acquired the [Nuwa Painting] and was able to divide his mind, thus making his mental computational abilities even nimbler!In the previous life, on Earth, the education system had taught Ning how to think. Although Earth was just one of trillions of little worlds, its educational system was far superior to this world\u2019s, where, for example, Swallow Mountain was still at a tribal era of development\u2026even the descendants of the Ji clan would generally only be able to read, while the members of lesser tribes wouldn\u2019t even be able to recognize any characters.Given this sort of level of education, it was only natural for everyone here to find it incredibly hard to analyze formations.It can be said that although perhaps the skilled scientists of Earth wouldn\u2019t necessarily all become formation experts, they would at least be very promising prospects in this regard.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013The education Ning had received in his past life was like \u2018software\u2019. In this life, Ning had an extremely powerful soul, which was like \u2018hardware\u2019!Naturally, he was very well suited for training in formations!\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Ning revealed a smile while reading. \u201cThat Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation and other formations like it truly are crude. They completely rely on activating the power of the world. There\u2019s no skill at all in them.\u201dThe more he read, the more Ning appreciated it.But slowly, the smile on Ning\u2019s face disappeared, and it was replaced by a frowning concentration, mixed with occasional stupefaction.\u201cFormation techniques really can\u2019t be underestimated.\u201d Ning nodded. \u201cThe way of formations is as vast and boundless as the seas. I\u2019m only able to understand the most basic principles, but as soon as I see some slightly more abstruse, complex parts, I am completely lost. It makes sense. Although in this boundless world, most people are a bit stupid, there are still many geniuses as well. Upon focusing on something for hundreds or thousands of years, they will of course vastly exceed those of us on Earth.\u201d\u201cYoung master, the sun is up. We should head out.\u201d Autumn Leaf suddenly called.\u201cAh?\u201d Ning suddenly discovered that it was already day.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Formation techniques were as boundless as the seas. Upon understanding the first scroll of the [Nine Scrolls on Formations], one could be considered a formations expert. Unfortunately, Ning wasn\u2019t able to completely understand even that first scroll. This caused him to become more humble and not feel so self-delighted.\u201cThrough analyzing formations, I will have more options and more tactics available to me.\u201d\u201cAlso, when I use the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], I can make it more nimble and won\u2019t have to use it in such a static manner.\u201d Although Ning was just a basic student of this field, he now had a basic understanding of the way of formations, with the essence of it being \u2018guidance\u2019! For example, at first, when he stupidly just simultaneously controlled hundreds of flying swords, he had to spend effort controlling every one minutely, which was simply too mentally exhausting.Fortunately, his soul was very powerful, and so he was easily able to execute the fourth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].But if he were an expert on formations, he would be able to have some of the critical swords \u2018guide\u2019 the other swords, which would greatly reduce the amount of load on his soul, and allow him to easily execute more powerful levels of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cYoung master, the Blacktooth Tribe is up ahead.\u201d Autumn Leaf called out.Only now did Ning halt his pondering on formations. Raising his head, he saw that in the distance, the sentries of the Blacktooth Tribe had noticed them.\u201cIt is young master Ji.\u201d\u201cQuick, hurry and report this to the leader.\u201dThe tribesmen of the Blacktooth Tribe had seen Ji Ning last time. This time, the three of them were once again travelling together, mounted on the three black beasts. They were quickly recognized.As Ning and the other two arrived at the gates to the tribe, Blacktooth was there to personally welcome them.\u201cMy respects to you, young master.\u201d Blacktooth had a large group of tribesmen behind him, all of them kneeling in unison.\u201cMm.\u201d Ning nodded. \u201cTake me to Spring Grass\u2019 place.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Blacktooth said hurriedly. The only person in the Blacktooth Tribe who had any sort of a connection to Ji Ning was Spring Grass.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing suddenly looked sideways, glancing a skinny toddler standing behind Blacktooth whose face was rather sickly, yet seemed similar to Spring Grass. Ning remembered seeing this toddler last time, and thus he spoke out. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201dThe toddler was stunned.Blacktooth, following Ning\u2019s gaze, turned to look at his son. He hurriedly said, \u201cQuick, response to the young master\u2019s words.\u201dOnly now did the toddler stutter out, \u201cMy name is Bluestone!\u201d\u201cBluestone, Bluestone\u2026\u201d Ning gently murmured to himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He only felt that this youth was a very powerful figure. The entire tribe seemed to be afraid of him.\u201cBluestone.\u201d The youth dismounted from the black beast, then walked over and held his hand.\u201cCome with me. Let\u2019s go to your big sister\u2019s tomb and kowtow to your sister.\u201d Ji Ning took Bluestone\u2019s tiny hand, and Bluestone, stupefied, just let himself be led away, not daring to resist. By his side, Blacktooth and the other tribesmen naturally didn\u2019t dare to argue.And so, just like that, they made their way through the tribe before arriving at a large graveyard behind the tribe.Once again, they came before that tomb.\u201cSpring Grass. I came.\u201d Ji Ning had prepared some sacrificial items which he had prepared when passing through some of the nearby tribes along the way. He placed all of them in front of the tomb carefully, while at the same time saying gently, \u201cThat Riverside He of the Riverside tribe is dead now. Serpentwing of Serpentwing Lake is dead as well. Your enemies are all dead.\u201dAs soon as these words were uttered, Blacktooth and the others next to him were startled. What? The Diremonster, Serpentwing, was dead as well?\u201cBluestone should be your only remaining little brother.\u201d Ning reached his hand out, pulling the dumbstruck Bluestone forward. \u201cI swear before your tomb that I will definitely provide good tutelage to Bluestone\u201dBluestone was somewhat stunned, but his father, Blacktooth, was incomparably delighted. He hurriedly said, \u201cThank you, young master.\u201d He himself was just the leader of a small tribe. What sort of a future would he be able to offer his son? But if someone as exalted as the young master of the Ji clan were to help out, then his son\u2019s future would be very different.\u201d\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t oppose it.\u201d Ning glanced at Blacktooth. \u201cIn the future, I will be spending quite a long period of time by Serpentwing Lake. If you want to see your son, come to Serpentwing Lake and find me there.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Blacktooth said respectfully.\u201cBluestone, kowtow to your big sister.\u201d Ning looked towards Bluestone by his side.\u201cOkay.\u201d The toddler hurriedly knelt down and kowtowed three times.Ning waved towards the side. \u201cAll of you can leave now.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201d Autumn Leaf included, everyone withdrew. Even Bluestone was led away by Blacktooth. In this wild, desolate graveyard, the only one remaining was Ji Ning.\u201cJust the two of us now.\u201d Ning withdrew a bamboo reed, beginning to drink wine. \u201cToday, your young master will spend some time chatting with you. In the future, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to come visit you too often.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Ning drank fruit wine in front of the tomb while chatting with \u2018Spring Grass\u2019. In the blink of an eye, an hour passed.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ning suddenly frowned. As a Fiendgod-like entity, his senses were extremely acute. He easily detected minute trembles in the ground. \u201cThousands of warriors! And the distance should only be twenty kilometers. Thousands of warriors, gathering twenty kilometers away? Can it be that a tribe is about to attack the Blacktooth Tribe?\u201dWith regards to the struggles between the various tribes, the Ji clan usually pretended not to notice them.\u201cBlacktooth was originally a travelling merchant, and thus should be smooth and slick in establishing relationships.\u201d Ning was puzzled. \u201cEver since founding this Blacktooth Tribe, no other tribes have ever attacked. Why has a tribe come to attack this time? And with thousands of warriors at that?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take a look.\u201d Ning immediately rose.Regardless of whether it was for Spring Grass or for Bluestone, he couldn\u2019t just stand and watch with arms folded.Although the Ji clan usually pretended to not notice these intertribal struggles, once they did interfere, the tribes they controlled naturally didn\u2019t dare to disobey.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Ning walked within the tribe, heading straight for the gates.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Mowu and Autumn Leaf hurriedly followed him.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Blacktooth led his tribesmen to follow him as well. Ning just barked, \u201cTwenty kilometers outside of here, thousands of warriors are gathering and advancing towards us. Right. There should be two to three thousand of them. Your Blacktooth Tribe needs to immediately prepare.\u201dBlacktooth was shocked. \u201cTwo or three thousand warriors? Impossible. Only an enormous tribe would be able to mobilize two to three thousand warriors. A tribe of that size wouldn\u2019t bother with our Blacktooth Tribe. Our entire population, including women, children, and the elderly only number one thousand or so. We aren\u2019t worth such a large military mobilization!\u201d\u201cIf I say it is so, then it is so!\u201d Ning glanced at him sideways, saying nothing more.\u201cRight.\u201d Blacktooth naturally didn\u2019t dare to say anything else, and he hurriedly began to shout. \u201cQuick quick quick, enemies are coming to attack! Quickly, gather around!\u201d\u201cRumble\u2026\u201d A low beast horn sound quickly rang out, filling the entire tribe. The muscular warriors of the tribe, the elderly and the womenfolk, all grabbed their sabres, swords, spears, and bucklers, while all of the children hid themselves.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Ning was staring into the distance at the gates, while all of the tribesmen of the Blacktooth Tribe were holding their weapons with bated breath in preparation. All of them were staring towards the distant mountain forests.Slowly\u2026They began to clearly sense footsteps coming. After all, how could two or three thousand warriors on the march make no sound at all? This caused Blacktooth and the others to be all the more amazed. It must be understood that Ning had already informed them long ago of the rough number of people coming.\u201cSo many.\u201d\u201cSo many warriors.\u201dThe tribesmen of the Blacktooth tribe were all stunned. From afar, a densely packed swarm of human figures were emerging from the forests, with the ones in front armored. It was like a flood of metal coming their way at high speed, causing the Blacktooth Tribe\u2019s members to feel their hearts turn cold.\u201cHalt!\u201d The order came, and the three thousand warriors immediately formed ranks roughly half a kilometer in front of the Blacktooth Tribe\u2019s gates.\u201cBlacktooth Tribe, listen up!\u201d In front of the enemy troops, a powerfully built bald man was bellowing. \u201cWe are from the Firewing Tribe. Quickly open your gates and surrender to us, and you have a chance at life. If you resist, those who resist shall all be killed, while the rest of the tribesmen shall be sold as slaves.\u201dThe voice echoed in the air.The Blacktooth Tribe was in a state of panic.\u201cWhat to do?\u201d\u201cSo many warriors. There\u2019s thousands of them.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re finished.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t young master Ji here?\u201d The Blacktooth Tribe had no fighting spirit at all now. First of all, their tribe was newly founded to begin with, as many of the tribesmen were gathered from those who had fled from other tribes. They didn\u2019t have too strong a sense of loyalty to the Blacktooth Tribe yet. And secondly, the Blacktooth Tribe had less than five hundred tribal warriors, but in front of them there were three thousand!Once battle began, they would quickly be defeated!\u201cEveryone in the Firewing Tribe!\u201d Blacktooth hurriedly went forward and said loudly, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you have come to my Blacktooth Tribe. If you have any demands, our Blacktooth Tribe will naturally work hard to meet them.\u201d\u201cEnough chitchat!\u201d The bald man in front of the enemy lines bellowed back. \u201cSurrender or battle!\u201dNing frowned, glancing at Mowu by his side. Mowu nodded, then immediately walked forward while shouting, \u201cOur young master Ji Ning is here. Leaders of the Firewing Tribe, why haven\u2019t you come to pay your respects yet!\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you come to pay your respects yet!\u201d \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you come to pay your respects yet!\u201d \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you come to pay your respects yet!\u201d The voice echoed within the forests, causing a commotion amidst the Firewing Tribe as well.In the center of the enemy formation, there was a group of men who were riding mounts.\u201cYoung master Ji Ning?\u201d\u201cThe Ji Ning who was at the Riverside Tribe?\u201d\u201cAside from that Ji Ning, who would dare order the leaders to go pay their respects to him?\u201d The high-level figures of the Firewing Tribe were all immediately stunned. The Firewing Tribe was also a large tribe with more than twenty thousand tribesmen, but because their tribe didn\u2019t have any Xiantian lifeforms, thus they had already reached their limits and didn\u2019t dare to expand any further. Compared to the Riverside Tribe, the Firewing Tribe was on a lower level.The Riverside Tribe wasn\u2019t too far away from them. With over a month having passed, these higher level members of the Firewing Tribe naturally all knew of what had happened, and had learned of Ji Ning\u2019s name.\u201cChief.\u201d\u201cChief.\u201d All of them looked at black-bearded man whom was escorted in front of them.By the side of the black-bearded man, a youth whose hair fell down his shoulders said in a low voice, \u201cNothing more than a descendant of the Ji clan. There\u2019s no need to pay any attention to a descendant of the Ji clan in this sort of tribal war. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\u201cAttack!\u201d The black-bearded man immediately shouted loudly.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat? Attack?\u201d\u201cChief!\u201dThe high level figures of the tribe who were around the black-bearded man were all stupefied. They didn\u2019t expect that their chief, who was both valorous and wise, would act so stupidly. Given the chief\u2019s status, he should clearly be aware of what the name \u2018Ji Ning\u2019 represented. If it was an ordinary member of the Ji clan, that was one thing, but this was Ji Ning, who had forced even the Riverside Tribe to lower their heads before him!\u201cKill!\u201d Those three thousand warriors were all ordinary tribesmen. How could they know what this name \u2018Ji Ning\u2019 represented? Hearing their chief\u2019s orders, they immediately bellowed and charged forward.\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cCharge!\u201dLike an steel flood, the armored warriors in front charged forward, while the beast-fur clad men were behind them. The earth shook, and it seemed as though even the skies grew dark. The tribesmen of the Blacktooth Tribe were all stupefied, and some even began to cry out, \u201cSurrender, we surrender!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re finished.\u201d \u201cQuick, run.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Ji Ning, standing at the gates, watched as the dark, dense mass of people charged forward. Immediately, he was suspicious. \u201cMy name should be known to all of the slightly larger tribes, especially after I acted against the Riverside Tribe. It should have spread throughout the area under the control of the Ji clan. Why is the black-bearded leader still ordering an attack?\u201dNing was puzzled.The Blacktooth Tribe was a small tribe. It didn\u2019t have much wealth. Mobilizing three thousand warriors to attack it was quite bizarre, in and of itself. After hearing his, the enemy still decided to attack? That was all the odder.However, just based on the fact that this Firewing Tribe dared to ignore his name, and just for the sake of the prestige of the Ji clan alone, he naturally had to act now.\u201cHmph.\u201dIn front of the gates of the Blacktooth Tribe, Ning suddenly leapt forward like a giant Roc in flight, instantly flashing through the air. At the same time he leapt up, enormous waves suddenly appeared out of nowhere in the area around him, and the incomparably turgid waves instantly formed like the waters of a flood. Huahuahua\u2026the boundless waves rolled forth, smashing directly towards those three thousand tribal warriors.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWaves.\u201d\u201cWhere did all this water suddenly come from?\u201d\u201cXiantian lifeform, a Xiantian lifeform.\u201d The three thousand warriors were instantly terrified. They previously had high morale, but upon those rolling waves crashing upon them, all of them began to collapse and everything fell to chaos. These warriors all understood that only Xiantian lifeforms and Diremonsters were able to accomplish the ability to control fire, water, poisonous gases, and the like. If a Xiantian lifeform wished to do so, slaughtering three thousand men was simplicity itself.Indeed, Ning didn\u2019t actually wanted to slaughter them. He only controlled the waves to smash down upon them. If he used fire or ice to freeze or burn them to death, the scene would have been completely different.\u201cHua!\u201d With a single bound, Ning travelled over a kilometer, landing directly in front of that black-bearded figure, grabbing him by the neck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At this time, the waves disappeared, and those knocked down tribesmen all knelt in terror as well.Instantly, the black mass of men were all on their knees, aside from the black-bearded man Ning had seized.\u201cPa!\u201d With a toss of the hand, the black-bearded man was sent rolling twice on the ground.\u201cYoung master Ji Ning.\u201d The black-bearded man was shuddering.\u201cYou don\u2019t recognize me?\u201d Ning looked at him.The black-bearded man shook his man hurriedly. \u201cNo, no, I heard of young master Ji Ning\u2019s fame long ago.\u201d\u201cThen you still ordered an attack?\u201d Ning frowned.\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d The black-bearded man didn\u2019t know what to say for the moment. This caused Ning to be even more puzzled. The leader in front of him clearly knew his name, and was frightened of him. So why, then, had he dared to issue that order?Ning shouted, \u201cI ask you, why do you attack the Blacktooth Tribe?\u201dThe black-bearded man immediately hesitated.The high level members next to him said hurriedly, \u201cYoung master Ji Ning, the Blacktooth Tribe is only a small tribe. Our Firewing Tribe didn\u2019t want to attack them at all! Only, the chief insisted on coming. We didn\u2019t oppose him, as it was just a small tribe and thus not worth it.\u201d\u201cThis was the decision of the chief and the chief alone.\u201d\u201cWe all opposed it.\u201d\u201cHalf a year ago, the chief ignored our opposition and forcibly led the warriors out and destroyed a small tribe with only a few hundred people, and sold off everyone, man, woman, child, and elder alike as slaves to his good friend, Zig! Look, that one right next to the chief is Zig! The chief trusts him very much!\u201d A silver-haired fur-clad elder pointed to the long haired youth next to Ji Ning.Swoosh!The kneeling long haired youth suddenly shot out a black light from his sleeves towards the nearby Ning.\u201cClang!\u201d Ji Ning\u2019s body was covered by beast furs, and underneath them he had magic treasures protecting him. Naturally, this attack was blocked.\u201cHmph.\u201d Ning looked at the long haired youth, but discovered that the youth\u2019s face had already begin to turn black. At this moment, the other high level members of the Firewing Tribe were angrily howling and reaching out with their hands to seize the youth, planning to subdue him. \u201cHe dares to ambush the young master. He deserves death.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t touch him!\u201d Ning immediately barked.But a muscular man of the Firewing Tribe who had charged in front had already touched the arm of the long haired youth. The pitch-black color on the arm of the youth instantly transmitted to the right arm of the muscular man.\u201cSwish!\u201d Ning pointed out with a fingernail, and a ray of sword energy swung out, chopping the left arm of the muscular man off.The long haired youth slumped to the ground, his entire body pitch black, and his seven orifices bleeding with black blood. That man whose arm had been chopped off by Ning had black blood flowing out of his severed arm as well.\u201cPoison!\u201dThe surrounding Firewing tribesmen all retreated in surprise.Ning\u2019s expression was grave. \u201cSuch fierce poison.\u201d\u201cAaaaah!\u201d The chief of the Firewing Tribe, that black-bearded man, suddenly called out, then hurriedly pointed at the corpse on the ground. \u201cIt was him! It was him! Young master Ji Ning, it was all him. He originally spat a mouthful of smoke at me, and I lost my faculties. Although I knew what was going on, I treated this Zig as my master and obeyed him from my heart. Whatever he wanted me to do, I would do. Even if he wanted me to die, I wouldn\u2019t resist at all. When I heard your name, young master, it was he who ordered me to attack. I clearly didn\u2019t want to offend you, young master, but as soon as he instructed me, I immediately gave the order.\u201dThe black-bearded man stared in shock and fury at the corpse on the ground. \u201cIt was that mouthful of smoke.\u201dThe high level members of the tribe, upon hearing this, were all awestruck.\u201cWhat?\u201d Ning was surprised as well.In the entire Swallow Mountain area, only the \u2018Blackfire Cult\u2019 was in possession of drugs that could control a person, but the most famous medicine which the Blackfire Cult had was the \u2018Holy Fire Pill\u2019. Upon eating the Holy Fire Pill, a person would become unswervingly loyal to the Blackfire Cult and not even fear death! Only, the \u2018Holy Fire Pill\u2019 of the Blackfire Cult wasn\u2019t a breath of smoke.\u201cAnyone capable of creating this thing is definitely a very powerful warlock or alchemist.\u201d Ning was secretly startled, and he turned to look at the leader. \u201cSpeak. What did this Zig want from you?\u201d\u201cTo buy slaves!\u201d The black-bearded man said hurriedly. \u201cHe first bought slaves from us twice, over two thousand slaves! Afterwards, he controlled me and ordered me to swallow up some smaller tribes and have all the members of those tribes be sold as slaves to him. He would arrange for those people to be taken away.\u201dNing was puzzled. What was the point of buying so many slaves? Generally speaking, tribes would buy slaves to use them for manual labor or as servants. Slaves had to eat as well, and providing enough food for so many wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201cHis subordinates?\u201d Ning asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that he sent subordinates to take the slaves away? So many slaves, including women, children, and elderly, would have travelled very slowly. You should be able to find traces of them.\u201d\u201cI can. I can.\u201d The black-bearded man nodded hurriedly. \u201cTen days ago, his subordinates took a group of slaves away. They were headed towards the east. Two days ago, a hunting squad of our tribe saw that slaver squad. Most likely, in two days they couldn\u2019t have gone too far. We should be able to find them quickly.\u201dNing nodded.\u201cMowu. Autumn Leaf.\u201d Ning turned to look into the distance.Mowu and Autumn Leaf immediately ran over.\u201cYoung master.\u201d The two looked at Ning.\u201cI have something to take care of.\u201d Ning said. \u201cThe two of you, immediately send word to the nearest station of black armored guards, and have the hundred closest black armored guards to escort you and Bluestone to Serpentwing Lake. My father will arrange for a dwelling to be built at Serpentwing Lake, and you will temporarily live on the island in the center of it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Mowu and Autumn Leaf assented.\u201cAs for you.\u201d Ning looked at the black-bearded man. \u201cYou will immediately arrange for your hunter squads to provide me with two guides. I want to find that slaving squad.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201d The black-bearded man hurriedly said, and then roared backwards behind himself, \u201cThreeknife, Cardcloth, come over here.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Ning led the two guides on the backs of the black beasts, traveling by day while resting at night in hot pursuit. That squad, guiding hundreds of elderly and infants, naturally travelled much more slowly. They would at most be able to advance a hundred kilometers a day.\u201cYoung master, there clearly are footsteps here.\u201d A swarthy man with braided hair said hurriedly. \u201cThe tracks are very clear. They should have been made less than a day ago. We will soon catch up to them.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Ning nodded.They continued the chase.Soon, they saw a large cluster of figures. All of them, male and female, were fettered by the hands, with the rope being attached to a tree trunk. A group of men and women were bound all together, carrying a tree trunk. By doing so, anyone who attempted to flee would pull others with him, and once the movement became apparent enough, the slaver escorts would easily notice.\u201cHurry, hurry up.\u201d The slaver escorts were soldiers wielding whips, and they would occasionally lash out with the whips. As for some of the toddlers, they were tied up and seated on horses, with eight or ten toddlers tied up on each horse, allowing them to move more quickly.The looks on the faces of the men and women were full of grief, and their eyes were filled with despair.Half a month ago, they were in their own tribes, living peaceful, happy lives with their families. But now, they had become slaves and were being escorted to an unknown area.\u201cYou two, take these three black beasts and return. Have your tribesmen arrange for them to be sent to Serpentwing Lake.\u201d With a flip of his hand, Ning withdrew two beastheads of gold. \u201cYou made a trip with me. I won\u2019t mistreat you.\u201d\u201cThank you, young master.\u201d The two tribesmen hurriedly thanked him.Ning nodded, then patted his black beast. He had ridden this black beast while adventuring. After having spent so much time with it, he was rather reluctant to part with it.\u201cYou can go now.\u201d Ning immediately dismounted, then began to travel by himself. After all, this squad was moving very slowly. There was no need for him to ride the black beast.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The slaver squad continued to advance through the mountain forests. On the road, although they encountered some monstrous beasts, the slaver escorts were powerful experts, almost all of them peak Houtian level, with three of them being Fiendgod Houtian experts. They easily killed the monstrous beast.\u201cIt is indeed odd.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cLarge-scale purchasing of slaves, and using medicines to control the leader of a tribe to engage in the large-scale capture of slaves. Even the slaver escorts have peak Houtian Fiendgod practitioners.\u201d\u201cHurry up!\u201d\u201cHurry up.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d The slaver escorts seemed to be rather happy.Ning secretly followed from behind. This place was already at what was considered the border between the Ji clan and the Ironwood clan, while up ahead was a chain of mountains.This group of slavers were heading towards the mountain range.\u201cEnter the mountains.\u201d The squad continued forward.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing moved from behind, but just as they arrived at the base of the mountain, the sun which been bright in the sky suddenly changed as soon as Ning followed them into the mountains. It was as though day had suddenly transformed into night. The area around them had turned pitch black, and only some faint details of the surrounding area could be made out. The entire area seemed to be covered with black fog.The black fog was everywhere, and it was filled with a cold aura.\u201cA formation.\u201d Ning immediately understood that he had entered a formation.\u201cSomeone actually came to die. Hahaha!\u201d An evil, ear-piercing laugh suddenly rang out. \u201cLittle human child, your flesh will definitely be very delicious. I will slowly devour you bite by bite.\u201dNing stood there, staring into the endless black fog surrounding him. He could just barely see to a distance of ten meters. Beyond that, he couldn\u2019t see anything. In his hands, the two Darknorth swords had already appeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 13 \u2013 Zifu Disciple\u201cGo ahead and kill me.\u201d\u201cEven as a ghost, I won\u2019t forgive you.\u201d\u201cAaargh!\u201d\u201cNo, no, no!\u201dStanding in the middle of the boundless darkness of the great formation, sounds could vaguely be heard from everywhere, as though many people were suffering terrifying torments. Ji Ning was secretly startled. \u201cThey wildly purchased so many slaves, and even controlled the leaders of some tribes to snatch up some slaves through battling other tribes. What are they doing!\u201d\u201cNo matter what, first I have to leave.\u201d Ning stared seriously at his surroundings. With a \u2018swoosh\u2019, he charged forward, moving more than a kilometer. And then, he once more turned and began to sprint, retreat, leap forward\u2026within the pitch black, foggy formation, Ning moved around at high speed for a long time, but no matter where he moved, he remained within the formation filled with the dark fog and cold air.\u201cNot good.\u201d Ning\u2019s face changed slightly. \u201cThis is no ordinary maze formation. I moved at such high speed and constantly changed directions, but the formation remained utterly stable. The person controlling this formation is most likely not a Xiantian lifeform.\u201dDuring this past month of pursuit, Ning had focused on training in the [Nine Scrolls on Formations] and had made some accomplishments. Although he was unable to easily defeat the formation in front of him, he was able to tell\u2026this was far above the likes of simple formations such as the Yin Yang Twin Energy Formation. It was an extremely intricate formation, and a magic treasure capable of setting up this sort of formation would have to be considered a ranked magic treasure.There was no way for a Xiantian lifeform to bind a ranked magic treasure.\u201cA person on the level of a Wanxiang Adept wouldn\u2019t deign to act in such a manner in a place like Swallow Mountain. Nine out of ten\u2026the person who set up this formation should be a Zifu Disciple, and one specialized in using poisons.\u201d Ning quickly came to this conclusion based on what he had encountered previously.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cHuman child, I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d The ear-piercing laugh reverberated within the endless black mist.Ning just stood there, completely unmoving, while at the same time, around him appeared three fire lotus petals and three water lotus petals. The two layers of lotus petals slowly swiveled around Ning in opposite directions\u2026\u201cHahaha!\u201d A sinister laughter echoed.Shua!A shadow suddenly leapt forth from the dark mist, pouncing towards Ning. But when that shadow saw Ning being protected by the Waterflame Lotus, it paused slightly.\u201cHmph.\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes had a fierce look flash past them, and he immediately charged forward, his Darknorth sword in his hand transforming into a ray of firelight as he executed the \u2018Thunderflash Flint\u2019, chopping the shadow in half.Hua\u2026.The shadow instantly split into mist, then glided backwards before reforming into a mutant beast. Hidden in the darkness, there was no way to clearly see the mutant beast at all.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a human child, this is a human Xiantian lifeform who has been training for who-knows how many years!\u201d The ear-piercing sound emanated out from the mist, travelling a long distance. \u201cThis human most likely broke through to become a Xiantian when very young, and so his features remain so very young. In addition, he has a protective lotus surrounding his body. The lotus flower around his body should be a magic treasure.\u201dFrom far off in the distance, another clear, cold voice echoed forth. \u201cIf he isn\u2019t a Zifu Disciple, he doesn\u2019t matter. Just kill him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll handle it.\u201d The mutant beast in front of Ning, hidden in the mist, said directly.Hearing this, Ning\u2019s face changed slightly.If he isn\u2019t a Zifu Disciple, he doesn\u2019t matter. For someone to dare say something like this most likely meant that the person who set up this formation really was a Zifu Disciple! In addition, the one who had attacked just now was nothing more than a monstrous beast, most likely a spirit beast under the command of that Zifu Disciple.\u201cMy Master said.\u201d The mutant beast in the mist slowly began to change positions, occasionally appearing here, and then over there. \u201cWhen adventuring in the outside world, the younger a human you encounter, the harder they are to deal with. It looks like his words weren\u2019t wrong\u2026but unfortunately, you ran into me!\u201dNing just stood there calmly.After a person reached the Xiantian lifeform stage, that person would no longer be a mortal, and his appearance would remain virtually unchanged. Only when he began to reach the limits of his life would he slowly age. Thus, elderly looking Xiantian lifeforms were virtually all over a century old. Ji Yichuan, who had first made his name echo in Swallow Mountain, and then had gone out adventuring for many years before bringing his wife back, was now nearly fifty, but he still looked exactly as he had when he was a youngster. If a Xiantian lifeform looked like a child, then that meant that he became a Xiantian lifeform when he was a child.Thus, the younger one appeared, the harder they were to deal with.Even some Immortals might have the appearance of a child.\u201cSwish!\u201d \u201cSwish!\u201d \u201cSwish!\u201dSuddenly, three black rays shot towards Ning, but when they hit those swiveling lotus petals of fire and water which were protecting Ning, they just barely broke through the first layer of lotus petals, but the second layer successfully blocked them.The enormous black shadow emerged from the mist, and an enormous claw grabbed towards Ning!\u201cDang!\u201d Ning\u2019s sword light flashed, and the grab attempt was blocked while Ning himself dodged to the side.\u201cEh?\u201d Ning frowned as he looked. This was a mutant beast which looked like a panther. Ning was actually momentarily unable to recognize what sort of mutant beast this was, primarily because many mutant beasts had mixed lineages, which would often resulted in mutant beasts. The mutant beast in front of him could only be said to look similar to a Bi\u2019an Tiger. Its body was extremely long. The mutant beast stared at Ning, its tail swaying. Its tail had circles of black bony spikes which, if struck onto a person\u2019s body, would definitely be no weaker than a whip-type magic treasure striking a person.Ning\u2019s pupils contracted, and he transformed into a blur.Windwing Evasion!Swoosh!Moving as fast as lightning, he pounced towards the mutant beast, and the mutant Diremonster\u2019s twin claws snatched towards Ning as well.\u201cRaindrop Pierces Rocks!\u201d A water-like sword light flashed past, seeming like a drop of water falling down, and with a thundering sound, that mutant Diremonster collapsed to the ground, rolling a few times before coming to a halt, no longer moving. Its head had a large hole in it, with blood and brain matter flowing outside.Ning quietly landed on the ground, still holding his twin swords as he cautiously stared around himself. He only glanced sideways at the mutant beast. \u201cNothing more than a late-stage Xiantian level Diremonster!\u201d\u201cBlack Needle!\u201d\u201cBlack Needle!\u201d From afar came the call of that cold voice. \u201cIs that human dead yet? Black Needle! Black-\u201dQuickly, that clear, cold voice went silent.\u201cI killed the mutant, but he didn\u2019t know about it. It seems that mutant beast wasn\u2019t his spirit-beast.\u201d Ning understood that there wasn\u2019t necessarily only a single Zifu Disciple here in this mountain. It was very possible that a hidden power was here! But the person capable of setting up this sort of formation had to at least be a Zifu Disciple.\u201cThis is big trouble.\u201d Ning hadn\u2019t imagined that in the Swallow Mountain area, at the borders of the Ji clan and the Ironwood clan, such a powerful force was hidden.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Ning was trapped within the great formation. The protective Waterflame Lotus swirled around him, and in his mind, he was constantly pondering formations. The [Nine Scrolls on Formations] were abstruse, especially those extremely hard to memorize diagrams, but Ning had still been able to forcibly commit the contents of the first scroll to memory. He was currently using the greater part of his mental power to analyze them.\u201cI have to break this formation. While trapped here, all I can do is allow them to use whatever techniques they have against me.\u201d Ning focused on analyzing the formation, while constantly hearing miserably cries, fierce curses. It seemed as though a true hell was hidden within this mountain.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Ji clan of the West Prefecture. Snowfall Palace.Ji Young was seated at the throne of the palace, while Ji Yichuan, Ji Lee, and others were all seated below him, their faces all solemn.\u201cIn the past ten days.\u201d Ji Lee\u2019s voice was rather hoarse, and his eyes were rather red. \u201cThe Five Prefectures of our Ji clan has already had multiple Xiantian lifeforms disappear! We have neither found them alive nor found their corpses!\u201d\u201cPrefecture Lord, who has come to the territory of our Ji clan to cause trouble?\u201d\u201cFind them and destroy them.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve almost gone crazy in the past few days. My close friend! I must find him and rescue him.\u201dThe members of the Ji clan seated below couldn\u2019t help but howl.Ji Lee, glaring, let out a hiss, \u201cMy son has gone missing as well. I must find him, I must!\u201d And then, he looked at the Prefecture Lord, seated in the throne. \u201cElder brother, up till now, how many Xiantian lifeforms have gone missing? Also, who exactly is acting against our Ji clan? Have we found the culprit?\u201d\u201cBased on the news which the Central Prefecture just sent over, up till now, already twenty three Xiantian lifeforms have gone missing.\u201d Ji Young shook his head. \u201cAnd most of them are fairly powerful and quite famous Xiantian lifeforms! The Five Prefectures of the Ji clan have lost five of our Commanders who were outside. As for where they have gone, there\u2019s no trace of them at all.\u201d\u201cThis is provoking our Ji clan. They show no regard for the Ji clan at all.\u201d Lee bellowed.Young\u2019s eyes were red. \u201cAll the ones who went missing were quite powerful and were at least mid-stage Xiantian lifeforms. There were even late-stage Xiantian lifeforms, and even peak Xiantian lifeforms! They are running roughshod over our Ji clan, then pissing on our faces! We have to find the culprits! No matter how great the price, we must destroy them!\u201dYichuan, seated to one side, spoke out. \u201cThey must be destroyed indeed. However, based on my experience, this power should have a Zifu Disciple guarding it.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Everyone looked towards Yichuan.Yichuan, after all, had gone adventuring outside. He had even gone to the Darknorth Seas. His experience was greater than theirs.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYichuan continued, \u201cThere are two possibilities which have the greatest likelihood. The first is that it should be some sort of fleeing tribe, who lost their city and no longer have a base and were sent wandering\u2026but the remnants of this tribe are still very powerful. Thus, they want to cause a battle here in Swallow Mountain and conquer a commandery city through it.\u201dWith a commandery city, they would have their own territory. Only then would a tribe have a base!\u201cThe second possibility is that it is a fleeing Immortal practitioner. The Immortal practitioners of some evil sects will use souls and corpses to train in some evil magic spells. Snatching Xiantian lifeforms is done because Xiantian lifeforms have more powerful souls, and can be better used to train in some magic spells.\u201d Yichuan said.\u201cAnd the disappearance of Xiantian lifeforms,\u201d Yichuan continued, \u201cBased on the intelligence of our Ji clan, is not just limited to the Ji clan, but also the nearby Ironwood clan! The Riverbank clan has Xiantian lifeforms missing as well. Only, we don\u2019t know how many Xiantian lifeforms they have lost. For them to act so wildly means that the power which has come to our Swallow Mountain is not weak. We absolutely must get revenge, and we must rescue the missing Xiantian lifeforms, but we cannot be rash. We need to first discover the true situation regarding the opponents, and then set a strategy to destroy them at one blow!\u201dEveryone in the palace went silent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14 \u2013 Revered MasterJi Yichuan walked by himself on the stone brick road, his forehead furrowed in thought. He knew that this affair would be a tough trial for the Ji clan, but any organization which wanted to survive in this world would have to be able to endure repeatedly trials! After passing them, the roots of the clan would naturally grow deeper and grow more powerful. But if they weren\u2019t able to pass them, then the clan would be exterminated! It would be lucky if even a few survivors managed to flee and pass down the bloodline.\u201cMaster.\u201cMaster.\u201d Some of the servants knelt down on the side to welcome him.Yichuan walked into his residence, then headed back to the place where he normally stayed. Suddenly, a female servant hurriedly rushed over. Upon seeing Yichuan, she was so frightened, she immediately knelt down.\u201cWhy are you in such a rush? Consider your image!\u201d Yichuan frowned and barked.\u201cMaster.\u201d The female servant\u2019s face was white with tension. \u201cMadame, Madame, she\u2026\u201dYichuan\u2019s face instantly changed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Snow?\u201d\u201cMadame fainted!\u201d The female servant said frantically.\u201cFainted?\u201d Yichuan\u2019s face instantly turned white. As an expert Ki Refiner, how could she faint? If his wife fainted, there could only be one reason.\u201cSnow!\u201d Yichuan instantly turned into a gust of wind, disappearing from that area.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Within the room.Yuchi Snow was quietly lying on the bed. Her face was rather pale, but her features were still so beautiful, so calm.\u201cSnow.\u201d Yichuan instantly appeared within the room. Seeing his wife lying there, he hurriedly walked forward and carefully inspected her. He couldn\u2019t help but glance at the female servant. \u201cWhat exactly happened?\u201dThe female servant was shaking in terror, and had knelt down long ago. \u201cMaster, the Madame had been drinking tea and was perfectly fine. Nobody touched the Madame, and nobody spoke with the Madame. But suddenly, the Madame\u2019s body turned weak and she just collapsed. All of us panicked. I carefully lifted the Madame back into the room, while Keepleaf went to call you, Master.\u201d\u201cHow could this happen.\u201d A look of agony was on Yichuan\u2019s face. \u201cHow could this happen! Quick, quick, go have Shaman Cao immediately come over!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The female servant immediately retreated, leaving behind only Yichuan and his wife in the room.Yichuan sat at the side of the bed, looking at his wife. He stretched his hand out to stroke her face, murmuring, \u201cIs this day truly here? When you gave birth to Ning, I feared that this day would come. I don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t believe it. You will definitely survive. I will accompany you and we will both watch our son become into an incredible hero.\u201dMoments later.A big-bearded old man dressed in filthy animal skins walked in. His body naturally carried an herbal fragrance. Shamans and apothecaries were a group of people who had a great deal of experience in natural herbs and remedies. The boundless world was a very miraculous place, and it had all sorts of curious types of things living within it. Even the most seemingly ordinary herbs, once combined in a certain manner, could have some unique effects.This Shaman Cao was one of the most skilled in herbs in the Ji clan of the West Prefecture.\u201cShaman Cao.\u201d Yichuan looked towards the big-bearded elder. \u201cMy wife just fainted for no reason. You take a look.\u201d\u201cCommander, please step back.\u201d Shaman Cao said in his hoarse voice, and Yichuan hurriedly moved to the side, stepping back to make way for him. Shaman Cao stretched out his dry hand, as skinny as a chicken claw, placing it against Snow\u2019s forehead. Instantly, a spot of green light was birthed from Shaman Cao\u2019s palm, and it began to slowly seep into Snow\u2019s body.A very strong herbal odor began to fill the area.Shaman Cao closed his eyes. After a long time, Shaman Cao took his hand back. As for Snow, who had previously been in a state of unconsciousness, her eyebrows trembled, and then she opened her eyes.\u201cSnow.\u201d Yichuan, shocked and overjoyed, hurriedly went forward while at the same time looking at Shaman Cao. \u201cHow is my wife?\u201d\u201cPlease forgive me for my inability.\u201d Shaman Cao shook his head. \u201cCommander, you\u2019d best go invite the clan leader.\u201d\u201cThe clan leader?\u201d Yichuan\u2019s heart clenched.The clan leader was the clan leader for the entire Five Prefectures of the Ji clan. His name was Ji Ninefire. An old fellow who had lived for nearly four hundred years, a true ancestor of the Ji clan. Of course, he was also a Zifu Disciple! Ji Ninefire loved to research, and had significant accomplishments in both formations, medicines, and poisons. In terms of medical treatment, he was naturally incomparably superior to Shaman Cao.\u201cI\u2019ll immediately take Snow over to him.\u201d Yichuan said hurriedly.\u201cNo.\u201d Shaman Cao said hurriedly. \u201cCommander, you cannot be rash. The Madame currently can\u2019t withstand any shaking or bumping. She needs to quietly recuperate. If you can invite the clan leader to come, that would be for the best.\u201d Shaman Cao came to a halt. He knew that inviting the clan leader to come would be very difficult.Yichuan nodded, then immediately instructed a nearby maidservant, \u201cImmediately go invite Commander Ji Redflower over.\u201dMoments later.Redflower, dressed in red clothing, walked in. \u201cYichuan, what do you need me for?\u201d\u201cAunty Flower.\u201d Yichuan, upon seeing this person, hurriedly said, \u201cI want to ask you to ride on your Azure Firebird and immediately head to the Central Prefecture. Invite the clan leader to pay a visit to our Western Prefecture.\u201d\u201cInvite the clan leader?\u201d Redflower was startled. The clan leader had stopped managing the clan\u2019s affairs long ago, and spent all of his time in research and training\u2026even if Ji Young, the Prefecture Lord of the Western Prefecture went to invite him, the clan leader still probably wouldn\u2019t come. \u201cIf I go invite him, would he come?\u201dYichuan said hurriedly, \u201cJust tell him that I, Ji Yichuan, have a life-and-death matter and that I am asking the clan leader to come to the Western Prefecture City. The clan leader will definitely come.\u201dAlthough Redflower was still puzzled at why Yichuan was so confident that the clan leader would definitely come, she still nodded. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go make a visit to the \u2018City of Ten Thousand Swords\u2019.\u201dThe Grand Xia Dynasty had erected countless commandery cities throughout the world. The Ji clan was only in control of a single one, the \u2018City of Ten Thousand Swords\u2019. This was the \u2018Central Prefecture\u2019 of the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan! As for the Eastern Prefecture, Western Prefecture, Southern Prefecture, and Northern Prefecture, they had all been built by the Ji clan, and had nothing special about them.\u201cSorry to trouble you.\u201d Yichuan said in thanks.Redflower immediately left, then quickly mounted her Azure Firebird and left the Western Prefecture City, heading towards the City of Ten Thousand Swords!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The maidservants in the room had left as well, leaving behind only Yichuan and his wife, Snow.\u201cYichuan.\u201d Snow smiled, lifting her head up to look at her man.\u201cSnow.\u201d Yichuan sat by the side of the bed, holding his wife\u2019s hand.Snow shook her head gently. \u201cI know it. You know it too. When we returned from the Darknorth Sea and suffered that attack on the way back, we were very lucky to be able to survive and return. The past ten years have been very calm and very happy. I am already content.\u201d\u201cIf, if that year, you hadn\u2019t given birth to Ning\u2026\u201d Yichuan\u2019s voice was somewhat hoarse.Snow gently shook her head. \u201cThis is our child. I had to give birth to him. Even though using the secret technique resulted in me losing some years of my life, it was worth it! I had been heavily injured. If I hadn\u2019t given birth to Ning then, who knows if I would have been able to give birth later on. Ning has the blood of both of us in his veins. And what\u2019s more, his life was bought using the life of my elder brother.\u201d\u201cElder brother.\u201d Yichuan still remembered that great battle they had fought on the way back.That great battle had changed the fate of three people.The Yuchi siblings, and himself, Ji Yichuan.\u201cQuick, take my little sister and go! Quick, go!\u201dThe image of that tall, powerful back. That furious roar. Yichuan had never forgotten it.\u201cIf we gave up Ning, perhaps I would have been able to live for a few more years, but I wouldn\u2019t have been able to have a child with you. I would have regretted it my entire life. He has the bloodline of the Ji clan, and he also has the bloodline of my Yuchi clan.\u201d Yuchi Snow said gently, \u201cI\u2019ve had ten years by your side, and I also have an incomparably clever son\u2026I am incomparably happy and incomparably satisfied. These past ten years, I have felt very blessed and very happy.\u201dYichuan gently held his wife\u2019s hand.\u201cNing is my pride and joy.\u201d Snow said slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t regret giving birth to Ning.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Yichuan nodded gently. \u201cI understand. Understand. In less than two hours, the clan leader will be here. Let the clan leader take a look. Perhaps it isn\u2019t too terrible.\u201dSnow nodded. \u201cIf I can live for another year or two, let\u2019s not tell Ning about this for now. If I won\u2019t be able to live for much longer, then let Ning return.\u201d And then, Snow looked towards her man, her eyes shining. \u201cYichuan, I am so blessed to have had you and Ning.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Yichuan looked at his wife and said gently, \u201cI feel the same way.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-But neither Yichuan nor Snow knew that right now, their son Ning was in dire straits. He was in the great mountain between the borders of the Ji clan and the Ironwood clan, which from afar seemed ordinary and unremarkable. Upon entering this mountain, however, one would fall into a pit of endless dark fog and never come out again.The protective lotus petals swiveled around him. Ning sat there in the lotus position, currently focusing on the [Nine Scrolls on Formations], constantly hypothesizing and thinking about how to break this formation as soon as possible.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013At the midpoint of the mountain.One miserable scream after another emanated from places throughout the midway point of the mountain. All sorts of furious, hateful curses, wild pleas, and sobs all constantly assaulted the ears, while in the center of the mountain, there were multiple pillars with men and women bound to them. At a glance, one could see over a hundred men and women, their bodies covered in scars.Beaten, humiliated, tormented\u2026all sorts of cruel methods had been used on them.\u201cXiantian lifeforms? You still think you are Xiantian lifeforms? Hahaha, drink it all, drink some of this wonderful urine to quench your thirst!\u201d The muscular servants were wildly tormenting them.Standing in the center of the mountain, there were six beautiful dressed men and women. They calmly watched all of this.\u201cWe\u2019ve purchased more than a million ordinary slaves in this Swallow Mountain region, and seized nearly a hundred Xiantian lifeforms. However, we are still quite a ways off from the requirements of Master.\u201d A black-clothed woman who had a scorpion on her shoulders said slowly.\u201cSenior apprentice-brother is currently outside capturing Xiantian lifeforms. We\u2019ll quickly be at the necessary numbers.\u201d A handsome youth smiled. \u201cHowever, one of Master\u2019s spirit-beasts, Blackneedle, went to kill an enemy within the formation, but was instead killed. My fellow apprentice-brothers and apprentice-sisters, how do you think we should deal with this?\u201d\u201cYounger apprentice-brother, you are naturally talented. It\u2019s best if you go.\u201d\u201cYounger apprentice-brother\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe nearby men and women all looked at the handsome youth. Seeing the situation, his face darkened. None of these fellow martial apprentices were fools. Although all of them has extraordinary abilities, since they knew that the person within the formation could easily kill the spirit-beast \u2018Blackneedle\u2019, none of them were willing to go. After all, going meant encountering some risk.Suddenly\u2026Kakaka\u2026From within the mountain, a location began to turn and swivel. One metal plate after another began to move open, revealing a corridor. Within the dark corridor, there was a hint of green light, and an icy cold aura swept out from within.\u201cMaster.\u201d The six men and women all called out respectfully in unison.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15 \u2013 WraithFrom the dark abyss below came a sharp yet calm voice. \u201cLittle Seven, you are the most clever. You can go handle this matter. Get rid of this intruder.\u201d\u201cYes, revered Master.\u201d The handsome youth didn\u2019t hesitate at all as he replied with respect.\u201cGo, then.\u201dJust as the words ended\u2026Kakaka\u2026..The metal board immediately rose up from the floor, once more tightly sealing away that corridor. Only now did those six men and women let out sighs of relief. Although they were their master\u2019s closest disciples, whenever they faced their master, they still felt terrified. This was because those disciples who had dared to offend their master had all been tortured to death, and would never even have the chance to be reborn.\u201cWho knows what sort of magic treasure Master is currently refining.\u201d A violet-clothed young man said softly. \u201cAll together, from start to finish, including the people we tortured to death in other places, we\u2019ve killed hundreds of Xiantian lifeforms, and an uncountable number of ordinary people. Master even said that once he finishes with this magic treasure, even if he encounters a Wanxiang Adept, he won\u2019t be afraid. Who knows what sort of magic treasure this is?\u201d\u201cIt definitely is a terrifyingly powerful one.\u201d\u201cRight now, Master\u2019s magic treasure is only half completed, but he already pays no attention to those Zifu Disciples located in the tribes of Swallow Mountain. When he truly completes is\u2026\u201d The six men and women chatted softly. They were very curious about this mysterious magic treasure which their master was busy creating, but unfortunately, their master had remained deep within his study this entire time and had forbidden anyone from entering.As for that tunnel, as soon as it shut, not a single sound would come from outside.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dA blurry, savage ghost suddenly came out from the body of one of the Xiantian lifeforms bound to the pillar. It let out a soundless scream, and then that blurry ghost sank down into the stones, being gathered to the depths of the mountain, towards that hidden room. This scene caused those six men and women to feel nervous. Only a true dread wraith would be visible to the naked eye.\u201cYet another wraith!\u201dThe six men and women thought back to their second apprentice-brother, who had offended their master. He had been tortured to death, and then he had been transformed into a dread wraith, then been absorbed in. Even wraiths were being drawn down\u2026clearly, whoever died there would never have the chance for rebirth.\u201cLittle Seven, go deal with the enemy in the formation.\u201d His fellow apprentices exhorted.\u201cStop rushing me.\u201d The handsome youth immediately walked outside.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014The dark fog was everywhere. The handsome youth quietly moved forwards, and everywhere he went, that black fog automatically opened a pathway for him.A Dao-seal appeared out of nowhere in the handsome youth\u2019s left hand. On the surface of the Dao-seal, there was a blood vessel like pattern of strange characters. On his right hand, a horsetail whisk appeared.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d With a flip of the horsetail whisk, hundreds of white strands of light immediately transformed to a size of dozens of meters, swirling around towards the lotus-position seated Ji Ning.Ji Ning was seated in the lotus position. Suddenly, he sensed something, and he raised his head to look.The entire area around him was filled with those white strands.\u201cBreak.\u201d Ning barked softly, and the Waterflame Lotus that had been swiveling around him instantly increased greatly in size. The two enormous layers of lotus petals swiveled, and those invading white strands that had sought to entangle him were all snapped, completely unable to draw near Ning.\u201cControlling fire and water?\u201d The pupils of the distant, handsome youth immediately contracted. \u201cIt seems he is a Fiendgod Body Refiner at the Xiantian level. This will be troublesome. I had wanted to rely on my horsetail whisk to directly seize him, but it seems that won\u2019t be possible.\u201d The hundreds of white strands quickly returned, then disappeared. In his right hand, a long whip appeared.\u201cYou\u2019ve invaded our formation. Immediately report your name!\u201d The handsome youth shouted.Ning was already on his feet, and he glanced at the handsome youth. \u201cThis is the border between the Ironwood clan and the Ji clan, but you seem to neither be of the Ji clan nor of the Ironwood clan. Who are you, exactly?\u201d\u201cIf I told you, you\u2019d be frightened to death.\u201d The handsome youth sneered.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give it a try and see if I\u2019ll be frightened to death.\u201d Ning wielded a sword in each hand.\u201cThe only thing you need to see is my whip.\u201d The handsome youth didn\u2019t continue the conversation. Clearly, he didn\u2019t want to explain where he was from. He immediately struck out with his whip, and the black whip slashed through the air, elongating at high speed. By the time it reached Ning, the whip had already transformed into a black serpent head which bit straight at Ning.Ning just looked at it. As soon as the long black whip broke through the first layer of the fire lotus, it was blocked by the second later of the water lotus.\u201cWhat sort of technique is that lotus of fire and water?\u201d The handsome youth wasn\u2019t like that spirit-beast from earlier; he could immediately tell that Ning was a Fiendgod Body Refiner who could control fire and water, but he didn\u2019t understand how Ning\u2019s technique worked.Swoosh!Ning, who had previously been just calmly looking at the whip, suddenly without any warning began to use the Windwing Evasion technique. He instantly leapt over towards that handsome youth at an astonishing speed. At the same instant he leapt forward like a gust of smoke, the Darknorth swords in his hands executed Raindrop Pierces Rocks, stabbing straight towards the head of the handsome youth.\u201cHard to deal with. Flee!\u201d This entire time, the handsome youth had been clutching that Dao-seal in his left hand. He suddenly activated it and it transformed into a blurry shadow and entered his body\u2026and then the handsome youth suddenly disappeared into thin air.Swoosh. Ning appeared in front of where that handsome youth had been. He began to frown. \u201cAn escape technique? He should have relied on that Dao-seal to use this technique. A Xiantian Ki Refiner actually has an escape-type Dao-seal. The Zifu Disciple behind him definitely dotes on him.\u201dDao-seals were divided by class as well.The Divine Speed Seal, Light Body Seal, Diamond Seal, Giant Strength Seal, and other Dao-seals were all the lowest class seals, which escape seals were clearly on a higher level. For example, the \u2018Traceless Talisman\u2019 was a type of Dao-seal that was so precious you couldn\u2019t even buy it with money. Only, unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t carrying the \u2018Traceless Talisman\u2019 on him. Even if he was, because Ning was trapped within this formation, he was unable to tell which direction he was in, there was no way that Ning could use it to go directly into the insides of the mountain. Of course, he could still rely on the Traceless Talisman to immediately flee, but unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have it on him.\u201cAlthough I have Escape Seals on me, this trapping formation has activated the five elements. I\u2019m completely unable to \u2018escape\u2019.\u201d Ning was certain about this. He had pondered for a long time, and he could be considered to have a good level of attainment in formations.He had some understanding regarding the formation he was trapped in as well.When the five elements were activated, there was no way to \u2018escape\u2019, unless the master of the formation voluntarily helped out. Unfortunately, the master of this formation only wanted his death. How could he help out?\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The handsome youth quickly charged back to the midway point of the mountain.\u201cLittle Seven\u2019s back.\u201d\u201cYounger apprentice brother, have you executed the enemy?\u201d\u201cWith our younger apprentice brother having personally intervened, he definitely captured the trespasser with ease.\u201d Those fellow apprentices, seeing the look on the handsome youth\u2019s face, immediately knew that he had definitely failed, so they immediately began to ridicule him.The handsome youth barked back, \u201cFellow apprentices, you have no idea as to how powerful this enemy is. If I had just been a bit slower in fleeing, I probably would have lost my life to him.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s that formidable?\u201d\u201cDoes he have some sort of powerful magic treasure?\u201d The other five men and women were all astonished. They knew how powerful this younger apprentice-brother of theirs was.The handsome youth said hurriedly, \u201cHe is just like our senior apprentice-brother. He trains in both ki and Body! He is a Xiantian level practitioner as a Fiendgod Refiner as well, and he was able to reach me in an instant. Fortunately, I had been holding the Escape Seal from the very beginning, and so I was lucky enough to escape. His speed alone indicates that he is probably a peak Xiantian-level Fiendgod Body Refiner.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cA peak Xiantian Fiendgod Body Refiner?\u201d\u201cWhere did such a powerful figure suddenly come from?\u201d The other five fellow apprentices were all shocked.The handsome youth sighed, \u201cIt seems we\u2019ll have to wait for our senior apprentice-brother. Senior apprentice-brother has already reached the peak Xiantian level in both ki and Body, and he also has all sorts of magic treasures and poisons\u2026the large majority of the hundred Xiantian lifeforms we have caught in the Swallow Mountain area were all captured by senior apprentice-brother.\u201d\u201cWho is speaking about me?\u201d A low voice rang out.The six men and women hurriedly turned to look. At the halfway point of the mountain, near that enormous cave entrance, a man dressed in a black cloak with unbound hair walked in. That icy, sinister aura was just the same as their revered master\u2019s. The man was currently carrying a large sack. As he walked into the mountain estate, he tossed the bag to the floor. At the opening of the bag, some feet could be seen.\u201cSenior apprentice-brother.\u201d The six men and women immediately called out respectfully. They all knew exactly how formidable their senior apprentice-brother was. They had all fled secretly with their master, and on the way, their senior apprentice-brother had even battled once against a Zifu Disciple and lived to tell the tale.\u201cI went to the Kou clan\u2019s territory and seized these three Xiantian lifeforms. I\u2019ve already destroyed their dantian\u2019s. Go tie them up.\u201d The black cloaked man instructed.Immediately, servants charged forward and dragged out the three people in the sack. One woman, two men. The woman was incomparably charming, but in a dazed state.\u201cSo even the bewitching beauty, \u2018Kou Hua\u2019, was captured.\u201d\u201cThree more.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAll of the Kou clan.\u201dThe captured Ji clan, Ironwood clan, and Riverbank clan Xiantian level members of the Swallow Mountain region all glanced over. Immediately, the black-cloaked man\u2019s face turned savage, and his eyes emanated a green light. \u201cI ordered you to torment them, torment them until they go insane, torment them until they died. But look at them; they actually have the presence of mind to look at these three. If you aren\u2019t able to torment to death, if a single one of them doesn\u2019t become a dread wraith, then I will make sure all of you become dread wraiths!\u201d\u201cYesyesyes.\u201d Those servants were absolutely terrified, and then all of them threw themselves forward, using all methods at their disposal to torment these Xiantian lifeforms with destroyed dantians.Seeing their senior apprentice-brother angry, the other six men and women were all frightened as well.The black-robed man turned his head to look at his fellow apprentices. \u201cJust now, you were speaking of me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16 \u2013 Clansmen\u201cSenior apprentice-brother, within the formation with our revered master set up, an enemy who secretly entered has been trapped. He looks just like a youth.\u201d That handsome youth addressed as \u2018Little Seven\u2019 immediately said. \u201cBut his power is astonishingly great. Even one of Master\u2019s spirit-beasts, \u2018Blackneedle\u2019, was killed, and I almost lost my life as well.\u201dThe black-clothed man frowned. \u201cOh? He\u2019s that powerful?\u201d\u201cVery powerful. That enemy is also both a Ki Refiner and a Body Refiner. He should be a peak Xiantian expert. Only you, senior apprentice-brother, will be able to kill him.\u201d\u201cOnce senior apprentice-brother uses his \u2018Intoxicating Dragonspit\u2019 technique, no matter how powerful he is, he will definitely faint and be easily captured.\u201dAll of them were boasting and praising him.The black-clothed man looked at the fellow disciples. \u201cJust a single intruder causes all of you to feel helpless! Hmph, Master is currently busy forging his magic treasure and cannot spare any attention. Since the six of you aren\u2019t able to do anything else competently, then you can go personally torment those Xiantian lifeforms. At least you\u2019ll be helping Master with his magic treasure.\u201d\u201cYes, senior apprentice-brother.\u201d The six men and women all responded in unison, and then all of them picked up the various tools on the floor and began to walk towards those Xiantian lifeforms.Those bound Xiantian lifeforms who had their dantians destroyed were virtually all from the Swallow Mountain region. As for the other Xiantian lifeforms, they were extremely rare, because most had been tortured to death long ago. Even the few dozen who didn\u2019t die yet were at the verge of death.\u201cBoth a ki and a Body Refiner? Peak Xiantian? Let\u2019s take a look.\u201d The black-clothed man snorted, then walked out.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cThe Three Powers [Heaven, Earth, Man] as the foundation.\u201d Ji Ning, surrounded and protected by his Waterflame Lotus, was seated in the lotus position, quietly chanting while looking at the formation around himself. \u201cThe Five Elements, with water and earth making up the majority\u2026the variables lie in these areas.\u201dIn his mind, a model of this enormous formation naturally came into being. He was currently thoroughly investigating the secrets of this formation.Ning suddenly rose to his feet.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!Instantly, he transformed into blur and repeatedly changed directions several times. The faster he moved, the greater the amount of pressure he would place on the formation, giving him a chance to test where the strengths and weaknesses of the formation lay.\u201cIt is even more profound and intricate than the formation I just envisioned.\u201d Ning shook his head. \u201cIf I had a chance to see the formation flags or formation marks, I would quickly understand the secrets of this formation.\u201d He knew that this was a formation controlled by a Zifu Disciple. Perhaps because the Zifu Disciple, for some special reasons, was busy, he had been unable to come and deal with Ning personally.But Ning knew that this was just a temporary situation. Once the Zifu Disciple attacked, given how powerful a Zifu Disciple naturally was, given that Ning was trapped within this confusing formation, he would definitely die.\u201cI must break this formation.\u201dTime was of the essence. Under this invisible pressure, Ning whole-heartedly was analyzing this formation, and his understanding of formations was constantly increasing. Fortunately, his previous life had given him a good foundation, while in this life, his soul was incredibly powerful, and he also had the guide to formations left behind by that Loose Immortal. Only because he had these three aspects combined did he have such an astonishing rate of improvement. However, to break this formation by this Zifu Disciple\u2026he was still quite a ways off.The great formation of this Zifu Disciple, if one wanted to destroy it through strength, would have to use tremendous force! Power at the same level naturally wouldn\u2019t be enough. Perhaps even a Wanxiang Adept would find it difficult to destroy it forcibly. As for Ning, without question, he had to defeat the formation through understanding its secrets. Only then would he be able to easily defeat it. Break through it by raw force? He was far from being able to.\u201cWu!\u201d The black fog in front of him seemed to grow slightly dimmer. A dark figure could faintly be seen in the distance, which was currently looking at Ning, seated in the lotus position, with curiosity. \u201cControl over water and fire? That protective lotus seems to be rather extraordinary.\u201dPu!The black-clothed man was currently holding a bottle in his hand. He pulled the stopper out, and the bottle began to release gusts of a mind-intoxicating scent. This bottle contained within it \u2018Intoxicating Dragonspit\u2019. If one directly drank this thing, perhaps even a Wanxiang Adept would immediately faint. But of course, it would be quite hard to get a Wanxiang Adept to drink it. After all, as soon as he smelled it, he would know not to drink it.The scent of Intoxicating Dragonspit alone, when smelled, was enough to cause virtually all Xiantian lifeforms to faint and collapse. As the senior apprentice, he had been bestowed this Intoxicating Dragonspit by his revered master, which was why he was able to stealthily capture so many Xiantian lifeforms.\u201cFall, fall, fall!\u201d The black-clothed figure looked expectantly at Ning.\u201cHm?\u201dThe lotus-position seated Ning felt a fragrance assault his nostrils. Immediately, his body went soft and his head grew dizzy. However, by relying on the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] and the Fiendgod body it had given him, which was incomparably stronger than that of normal Fiendgods, although Ning felt slightly dizzy, the divine power in his body, when activated, quickly blocked this feeling.\u201cWhich scoundrel is using tricks from hiding!\u201d Ning hurriedly stood up and shouted loudly!\u201cHahaha. You are indeed a Xiantian-level Fiendgod, and thus very hard to make faint.\u201d The distant black-clothed man walked over. \u201cA Xiantian-level Fiendgod Body Refiner whose body is akin to a Fiendgod\u2019s. To make you faint is as hard as making a Zifu-level Ki Refiner faint. This is why all of the people I have been capturing in Swallow Mountain have been Xiantian Ki Refiners.\u201d\u201cXiantian Ki Refiners, upon smelling this, will immediately collapse. After destroying their dantian, they won\u2019t be able to resist at all. Fiendgod practitioners, however, will be able to regrow their dantian after it is destroyed. They are quite hard to control. In addition, torturing a Xiantian Body Refiner to death is too hard.\u201d The black-clothed man mumbled to himself.Ning stared at the distant, black-clothed figure. His swords were in his hands, and he was incomparably cautious, because the distant man, when walking over, gave off an invisible pressure\u2026the tyrannical aura which only a Xiantian Fiendgod gave off. Clearly, the man had already activated the divine power in his body. Once his power was fully activated, he would attack.\u201cYou said you captured Xiantian lifeforms?\u201d Ning stared at him.The black-clothed man didn\u2019t answer the question. A look on his face that seemed like a smile and yet wasn\u2019t, he said to Ning, \u201cIf my guess is correct, you should be young master \u2018Ji Ning\u2019 of the Ji clan.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Ji Ning was startled.In this era, communication was only possible through shouting to others, while distant communication was through running between tribes. Thus, only the high level members of some tribes knew of Ji Ning\u2019s name. Even if they knew his name, however, they wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize him\u2026\u201cIt seems I didn\u2019t guess wrongly.\u201d The black-clothed man sighed. \u201cIn the entire Swallow Mountain area, there can only be one person who is so young in appearance, and yet is a Xiantian lifeform who is even capable of making my fellow apprentices think he is a peak Xiantian expert. The only person capable of this must be the one who kicked down the city walls with three kicks and sent River Sansi flying with one kick. Young master Ji Ning.\u201d\u201cYou know quite a lot.\u201d Ning looked at him.The black-clothed man sighed. \u201cOf course. I have to. In accordance with the orders from my master, I had to go capture a large number of Xiantian lifeforms throughout the Swallow Mountain region. Naturally, I need a good understanding of the intelligence reports regarding the various Xiantian experts of the Swallow Mountain area. If I didn\u2019t prepare in advance and ended up accidentally \u2018kicking an iron board\u2019, I would be in trouble! For example, your father, Ji Yichuan\u2026he had become a peak Xiantian long ago, and I even suspect that he is already a Zifu Disciple. I definitely wouldn\u2019t go capture a person like him.\u201d\u201cOnly after getting a good understanding of a person would I go capture him. That is why so many Xiantian lifeforms went missing in the Swallow Mountain area, and yet no one knows who did it.\u201d The black-clothed man looked at Ning. \u201cSo young, and yet so astonishingly strong. In the entire Swallow Mountain area, only you fit the criteria. In addition, this is the territory of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, and you yourself are of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture.\u201dNing was stunned.Many Xiantian lifeforms had gone missing in the Swallow Mountain area? Why was it that he hadn\u2019t heard of this?Actually, this was something which had only recently occurred. The capture of Xiantian lifeforms had to be done quickly. By the time the disappearance was noticed, perhaps days would have passed, and it also took time for the entire tribe to make a decision on what to do. Thus, he had to frantically seize the opportunity to capture as many as he could. He couldn\u2019t capture them slowly. Once the major powers of the various forces of Swallow Mountain reacted and began to set traps, it would be dangerous.\u201cNearly a hundred Xiantian experts have \u2018gone missing\u2019 in Swallow Mountain.\u201d The black-robed man looked at Ning. \u201cBecause this place is near the Ji clan, many of the Ji clan have gone missing, twenty four in total. There are some who directly belong to your Ji clan, while others belong to the tribes of your Ji clan. The Ji clan controls so much territory that I imagine up till now, your Ji clan still hasn\u2019t gotten a full picture of how many Xiantian lifeforms have gone missing.\u201dNing was astonished.The Ji clan\u2026had actually\u2026had actually lost many Xiantian lifeforms?\u201cSome have gone \u2018missing\u2019 from your Ji clan of the West Prefecture as well. Let me report a few names. I imagine you recognize them.\u201d The black-clothed man said. \u201cJi Jadewich. Ji Shan. Poortile. Earthshaker. Blindfish. These five all directly belong to your Ji clan of the West Prefecture. You should know them, right?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dNing\u2019s face instantly turned white.Ji Jadewich\u2026that was the son of Ji Lee, his most talented son. In the past, during the fierce struggle between Ji Lee\u2019s lienage and the current line in control of the Prefecture Lord position, Jadewich had been one of the most fiercest in the struggle. Ning had once deeply disliked this man.Ji Shan was a Xiantian lifeform of a younger generation of the Ji clan. Although he wasn\u2019t a Commander, the Ji clan of the West Prefecture had very great expectations for him. After all, his surname was \u2018Ji\u2019, and he also belonged to the primary line of descent.Poortile was a newly promoted Xiantian lifeform which had been trained and recruited by the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. In Western Prefecture City, Ning had seen him quite a few times. Each time when Poortile saw him, he would bow slightly and call out, \u201cYoung master Ji Ning!\u201dEarthshaker was one of the twelve Commanders of the Ji clan!Blindfish\u2026Blindfish\u2026.Blindfish!!!\u201cMaster Blindfish!\u201d Ning\u2019s heart was trembling.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMaster Blindfish had taught him archery. To Ning, he was the closest, most familiar figure of the five.All of them were familiar figures. After all, ever since he was young, he had grown up in Western Prefecture City. He had met with all of the Xiantian lifeforms of Western Prefecture City. Each year, at the gathering at Snowfall Palace, he would see this group of people. He was very familiar with them all. These people were his clansmen! Some of them had grudges against him, some of them were of the same lineage as him, while some were friends of him. One of them as the master archer who had taught him archery!\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ning\u2019s face turned pale.\u201cYou know them all, right? Haha.\u201d The black-clothed man suddenly shouted loudly, \u201cJi Jadewich, Ji Shan, Poortile, Earthshaker, Blindfish, your young master Ji Ning of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture is within the formation. Your young master Ji Ning will soon accompany you! Hahaha\u2026\u201dThe voice was very loud, and it transmitted directly into the distant tunnel midway up the mountain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ever since the day he had arrived in this hellish place, he had lost all hope. Currently, he was currently grinding his teeth, enduring the pain while taunting them, \u201cIs that all you got? Harder, hit me harder. Come at me, boy. Didn\u2019t you drink enough milk when you were a lad?\u201dSuddenly\u2026\u201cYour young master Ji Ning will soon be coming to keep you company! Hahaha\u2026\u201d That laughter rang towards them.\u201cJi Ning!\u201d The bearded Blindfish\u2019s body trembled, and then he roared hoarsely with all his might, \u201cYoung master Ji Ning, hurry and flee! There is an Immortal practitioner here developing an evil magic treasure!\u201dJi Jadewich, also bound by Blindfish\u2019s side, had been holding his head down, exhausted, but now his spirit was roused, and he raised his head as well. He murmured: \u201cJi Ning? Ji Ning?\u201d\u201cJi Ning! Quick, flee! Quick, leave!\u201d Jadewich howled desolately as well, striving to make himself heard.In the past, although he had wanted for his father\u2019s lineage to take over the Prefecture Lord position, since they had lost, he had submitted whole-heartedly. Ji Ning was their Ji clan of the West Prefecture\u2019s next Prefecture Lord! He had personally seen Ning\u2019s talent, and knew that the Ji clan of the West Prefecture would definitely become even more powerful because of Ji Ning. His dantian had already been destroyed and he had been captured. He didn\u2019t want the most promising genius of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, the next Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, to die here as well. This was a humiliation to the Ji clan!\u201cQuick, flee!\u201d Jadewiched howled heroically.\u201cYoung master Ji Ning, quick, leave!\u201d Ji Shan howled as well.They had all been caught here, and had often seen those dread wraiths enter that underground tunnel. From that, as well as the discourse of those six handsome men and women, they had learned\u2026that this was utterly a devil\u2019s lair!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013The black fog around him billowed, but from afar came furious, frantic howls.\u201cYoung master Ji Ning, hurry up and flee! There is an Immortal practitioner here developing an evil magic treasure!\u201d\u201cYoung master Ji Ning, hurry and leave.\u201d\u201cFlee.\u201dAlthough they had been tortured to the point of their voices turning hoarse, because he was so familiar with these people, Ning could tell who they were.\u201cDevleoping an evil magic treasure?\u201d Ning forcibly swallowed down the fiery anger in his heart as he stared at the black-clothed man.The black-clothed man chortled strangely. \u201cThe genius of the Ji clan, the mighty young master Ji Ning\u2026don\u2019t be so impatient, don\u2019t be so angry. They will all die. As for you, you\u2019ll die too.\u201d He wanted to arouse Ning\u2019s fury. When a person was enraged, they would lose their calm, and after doing so, their chances of victory would decrease.\u201cGo die!\u201d Ning was like a tiger leaving the mounting, releasing a surge of seemingly unblockable power as he charged straight forward.\u201cHmph, so rash. And they say you are a genius? In the end, you are still too young.\u201d The black-clothed man said to himself. In his hands, he wielded black weaver\u2019s shuttles in each hand, whirling them like devils as he welcomed the charging Ning. The two black shuttles stabbed towards Ning, and as the two drew near\u2026Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!The two black shuttles actually shot out multiple black needles in a cluster towards Ning. Because they were too close, and the attack of the black needles was simply too fast, although Ning\u2019s swordplay was powerful, he found it hard to block them all. Luckily, Ning\u2019s body had those two layers of the Waterflame Lotus to block those black needles. The black needles just barely managed to break through the first layer before collapsing, and as they did, the earth immediately began to emit a hissing sound.\u201cAll stained with poison.\u201d The two Darknorth swords in Ning\u2019s hands stabbed angrily outwards towards the black-clothed man.The black-clothed man moved like a ghost, the two black shuttles in his hands just barely able to dodge while also shooting out those black needles.\u201cWhat a formidable Ji Ning.\u201d The black-clothed man was secretly shocked. \u201cHis protective lotus flower is too powerful. It\u2019s actually able to affect even my own movements. Luckily, my robes are actually formed from an armor-type magic treasure, as otherwise, the power of the protective lotus alone would have torn my clothes apart.\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dA sword shadow suddenly pierced through the black-clothed man\u2019s arm, and the black-clothed man immediately leapt backwards at high speed, his face gradually turning savage. \u201cWhat a marvelous, profound protective lotus you have. My Blackblood Needles are unable to break through it. It seems I\u2019ll have to use power to break it.\u201d The two black shuttles in his hands disappeared, and then in his hands appeared a long staff formed from six shuttles, while at the same time, the area around the body of the man began to faintly swirl with fire as a powerful aura began to emanate outwards.\u201cStaff?\u201d Ning was secretly startled.Earlier, when they had battled, he had noticed that this black-clothed man\u2019s ability in wielding those black shuttles was truly quite weak. Only, the sudden shooting out of those Blackblood Needles was rather sinister. Now that the opponent was using a staff, Ning finally understood\u2026that this was the weapon which the opponent was actually an expert in.\u201cA staff is a long weapon and a heavy weapon.\u201d Ning mused. \u201cFiendgod Body Refiners generally like to use heavy weapon type magic treasures, using power to break through magic.\u201d\u201cReceive my attacks.\u201d The black-clothed man transformed into a black blur, and the longstaff was lifted up high and instantly began to increase in size rapidly, while its weight rapidly increased as well. The staff itself most likely now weighed tens of thousands of kilograms, and it smashed down directly towards Ning\u2019s head!Ning\u2019s Darknorth swords swept upwards.Clang!An enormous clashing sound. Ning himself was sent flying backwards, creating a deep gouge in the earth. His two hands had cracked apart at the thumb, and blood had already dyed the sword handles red.\u201cWhat tremendous power, even greater than mine by far. Although I am merely at the fourth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], I\u2019m still comparable to most late-stage Fiendgod Body Refiners. This black-clothed man is actually even stronger than me. He must be a peak Fiendgod Body Refiner.\u201d Ning understood that he had encountered a true opponent this time.To kill an Fiendgod Body Refiner at the Xiantian level was a much harder proposition.\u201cI want to see how many staff blows of mine you can take.\u201d The eyes of the black-clothed man flashed with a faint green light. He charged forwards with large steps, emanating an aura as mighty as a dragon\u2019s, and as he drew near Ning, he delivered the longstaff in his hands in a forward blow. A direct attack!\u201cStaves focus on power! Swords focus on skill!\u201d Ning shouted, while at the same time, a pair of green wings appeared behind him, seemingly made out of steel. This was the wing-type magic treasure which Ning had acquired out of the thousands of magic treasures found in the Aquatic Manor.The [Shadewind Steps] was nothing more than one of the most basic foundations to the divine ability, [Windwing Evasion]. When using this set of wings to utilize this divine ability, the power was much greater, comparable to a tiger being given a set of wings.Hua!Ning\u2019s wings trembled, and instantly, like a giant Roc, his speed tremendously, bizarrely increased. He flashed past like a gust of wind, constantly changing direction as the Darknorth swords in his hands struck out once and again against the black-clothed man.\u201cYayayaya!\u201d The black-clothed man was completely in a state of frenzy. His ki had activated the runes scribed onto his longstaff, causing the power of the Weight Seal to continue to grow. The staff seemed to have transformed into a small mount. Luckily, he was a peak Xiantian Fiendgod Body Refiner, as otherwise he wouldn\u2019t even be able to budge such a heavy weapon.\u201cIf you can\u2019t hit someone with the staff, so what if it is heavy? Die!\u201d Ning seemed to have been possessed as well. The existence of that Zifu Disciple was a source of invisible pressure for him. Those tormented clansmen of the Ji clan caused Ning\u2019s heart to feel as though it was being scorched.\u201cKill! Kill! Kill!\u201dJi Ning, relying on his wing-type magic treasures, moved like a ghost, his speed even greater than the black-clothed figure\u2019s. The Darknorth swords in his hands, having already undergone a Bloodforging, were incomparably sharp. His swordplay which contained the \u2018True Meaning of the Dao\u2019, in terms of technique, was at a level higher than the black-clothed man\u2019s as well.\u201cBang!\u201d A large hole was blasted through the waist by a piercing blow, but then immediately afterwards, the hole immediately grew small, then disappeared, having completely healed.\u201cHua!\u201d A large wound was carved out on his back.\u201cChi.\u201d His face was cut and scarred.\u201cYayaya!!!\u201d The black-clothed man was being driven insane by this battle. His all but unkillable body, when paired with his \u2018one with the world\u2019 level of staff-play, allowed him to easily dominate most peak Xiantian Ki Refiners. He hadn\u2019t expected that this time, he had run into a wall. The opponent\u2019s strength was a good deal weaker than his, but the opponent was nonetheless an expert Fiendgod Body Refiner whose swordplay was clearly on a higher level!Swish!Ning was sent flying away by a grazing blow of the staff. Although the skin on his hands were ripped open from the shock of the collision, they instantly healed. After all, as his swordplay was extremely skilled, Ning would only occasionally suffer a bit, while the opponent was truly dancing on the fine line between life and death. If he was to be stabbed by Ning in the head, a fatal blow, then he would die for sure.\u201cBang!\u201d Using both swords at the same time and moving like a ghost, the dance at the precipice of life and death finally came to a stumbling halt.Bang!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe black-clothed man\u2019s waist had a sword light flash past it, and an enormous wound appeared. He fell to the ground, his body chopped in half.\u201cFormidable, formidable.\u201d The black-clothed man ground his teeth. \u201cHowever, you can go die now.\u201dHua.Just as Ning\u2019s wings fluttered and he pounced towards the black-clothed man with his two swords, a bottle appeared in one of the hands of the black-robed man. He suddenly smashed it into the ground, which immediately exploded open against the rocky floor of the mountain. A thick white fog instantly poured out. Ning, seeing the situation looked bad, hurriedly retreated at high speed, but the faint fragrance still assaulted his nostrils. Although he had already stopped his breathing early on, that odor still invaded and burrowed through his body.\u201cTransform into a pool of liquid!\u201d The black-clothed man gritted his teeth as he stared at Ning, the two halves of his body quickly drawing close together and beginning to fuse together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Once it touched the body, it would quickly invade and corrode the body, melting it into a puddle of liquid! Even this peak Xiantian \u2018senior apprentice\u2019 himself had to use an antidote against it. The youth in front of him was clearly weaker than him in strength, and based on his understanding, young master Ji Ning had only recently broken through to the Xiantian level.\u201cNo matter how monstrous of a genius you are, as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, you are far inferior to me. Even I am not able to withstand it. You will definitely die.\u201d The black-clothed man looked expectantly.Ning\u2019s face changed. It really was a case of a certain type of master producing a certain type of disciple! In the past, Ning had calculated that this Zifu Disciple must be an expert poison user, and this black-clothed fellow in front of him was also skilled in poisons.The white corrosive fog\u2026Ning felt numbness begin to spread and erode his entire body.\u201cGotta hold!\u201d Ning circulated the Shining Scarlet divine power in his body, and the powerful Fiendgod life energy also began to wipe away the poison.\u201cDie!\u201d While forcibly suppressing this corpse essence in his body, the wing-type magic treasure on his back suddenly howled as Ning pounced towards the black-clothed man on the floor. Regardless of whether or not he was able to disperse this corpse essence in his body, he had to first kill the man in front of him. Otherwise, if he were to be dead from poison while the other was still alive, how hateful a thought would that be!\u201cHahaha, the more you move, the faster you die.\u201d The black-clothed man wielded the six shuttle longstaff, his footsteps thundering on the ground and causing the earth to shake. Clearly, he was using all of his strength! \u201cGo die!\u201d He raised the six shuttle longstaff high, smashing it down towards Ning like a giant mountain.Shua! Shua! Relying on the Windwing Evasion, Ning moved like a ghost, moving in an arc to attack the black-clothed man from the side.\u201cKill! Kill! Kill!\u201d Ning wildly pounced forward, while the longstaff in the black-clothed man changed directly slightly to welcome Ning. The two had already exchanged blows multiple times and knew very well how powerful the enemy was. The black-clothed man was physically strong, while Ning\u2019s swordplay was marvelous, and he was an expert in twin swords.Dong!A nearby piece of head-sized rock suddenly flew up, moving at supersonic speed as it smashed towards the black-clothed man\u2019s head. The distance was too close, and the stone came flying from behind\u2026the black-clothed man didn\u2019t have eyes in his back. By the time he vaguely sensed the ripples in the air caused by the stone, it was too late!\u201cBang!\u201d The stone, wrapped up by Ning\u2019s divine will, was moving at an incredible speed. It was as though a late-stage Xiantian Fiendgod Body Refiner expert had viciously thrown it at full force against his head.The stone shattered into tiny pieces.Blood flowed from the black-clothed man\u2019s head, while at the same time, he stumbled.\u201cClang!\u201d \u201cChi!\u201dTwo rays of sword light, one which blocked the six-shuttle longstaff, while the other sword light slashed straight through the black-clothed man\u2019s face, stabbing out from the back of his skull, carrying some brain matter and blood!Bang!The power of the six-shuttle longstaff stick forced Ning to retreat backwards by multiple steps, and naturally the sword was drawn out as well. There was a hole directly in the forehead of the black-clothed man, but there was no way it could possibly be healed. Forget about him; if Ning\u2019s skull had been pierced through, even he would have died without question.\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026.\u201d Fiendgod Body Refiners possessed astonishing life force, allowing the black-clothed man to have a final few moments of life. He stared at Ning, struggling to open his mouth. \u201cYou\u2026\u201dAnd then he fell down, causing the ground to tremble.\u201cHuff\u2026huff\u2026huff\u2026\u201d Ning stood there, his breathing rather ragged. He stared at the corpse in front of him, knowing how unwilling this person had been to accept death like this, how mystified this person had been in death. Most likely, this black-clothed \u2018senior apprentice\u2019, in the moment of his death, was still trying to puzzle out why his head had suddenly suffered an attack. Who had attacked him from behind?Divine will. This was Ning\u2019s killing technique.Once it was used, if he was unable to kill his enemies with it, his enemies would immediately use Escape Seals and instantly run away. Most likely, by then, even the Zifu Disciple would know that Ning possessed a \u2018divine will\u2019 ability. Thus, it was not to be used lightly, and when used, it had to kill the enemy.Previously, Ning had been fighting with him head on, but because of the poison, Ning could no longer afford to waste time. Thus, he used his divine will to control the stone.The two had been on par in terms of general power. In a life and death battle, one couldn\u2019t be the slightest bit careless. When that stone had carried boundless force in smashing down on the black-clothed man\u2019s head, his staff techniques had become completely chaotic. Naturally, he was even less able to fend off Ning\u2019s divine, ghost-like swordplay, with the result being a sword stabbing straight through his fatal point between his forehead.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Ning began to laugh, raising his head and shouting heroically, \u201cCome! Each one of you who comes shall die! However many comes, however many I shall kill! Hahaha\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Ning was incomparably crazed.He was in utterly dire straits, and his clansmen had been trapped here. His chance of survival was very slim. Ning naturally became all the more frenzied. Killing an expert of the enemy naturally made him feel incomparably satisfied.There were deep gouges everywhere on the ground, with shattered rocks littering everywhere. After all, prior to this, Ning\u2019s swordplay had activated the power of the world itself, while the enemy was also incomparably strong. Naturally, the area around them had been reduced to rubble.\u201cPoison?\u201d Ning could already sense that the corpse essence in his body was being slowly ground away by the natural life force in his body that was being created by the Crimsonbright divine power. \u201cIt seems it still can\u2019t do anything against my Fiendgod body.\u201dNing was different from that black-clothed \u2018senior apprentice\u2019.The black-clothed man couldn\u2019t withstand the poison\u2026but Ning trained in the number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique, while the Crimsonbright divine power was born from a fusion of the power of the sun and the power of the moon, while his divine body had been formed and birthed by Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater. In terms of quality, his body was untold times more powerful than other Fiendgod Body Refiner bodies.\u201cThat black-clothed man\u2019s power was clearly much greater than the previous man\u2019s. Most likely, he has a fairly high status in this place. Perhaps he has some secrets on this formation on him.\u201d Ning hurriedly began to search the black-clothed man\u2019s corpse, but unfortunately\u2026The Zifu Disciple himself actually wasn\u2019t an expert in formations. All he had done was set up formation flags in a very formulaic way. Ning thus naturally wasn\u2019t able to find any information regarding this formation on the corpse.\u201cHowever, he has quite a few Dao-seals and bottles and elixirs on him.\u201d Ning collected them all, but didn\u2019t have any time to investigate these battles. First of all, he didn\u2019t dare to pull out the stoppers for fear of them being poisoned, and second of all, he himself didn\u2019t know anything about poisons. It was best for him to spend his time focusing on the formation and increasing his abilities in formations. Breaking this formation as soon as possible was what mattered.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Within the mountain.The six beautifully dressed men and women were currently, as per the senior apprentice\u2019s orders, torturing these Xiantian lifeforms.\u201cHaha, with our senior apprentice personally handling this, your young master Ji Ning\u2019s death is assured.\u201d\u201cIn the formation, I heard senior apprentice say that young master Ji Ning is still a youth? Little Seven, you are nearly thirty years old this year. Can it be that this young master Ji Ning is even younger than you?\u201d The six men and women chatted amongst themselves.One of the nearby men bound to the pillar, a bald man whose body was covered with scars, howled at them, \u201cYoung master Ji Ning of the Ji clan is perhaps just eleven or twelve years old this year. Compared to him, you are like worms on the ground while he is like a divine dragon in the skies!\u201d\u201cShut your mouth.\u201d The nearby servants immediately used heated irons to torture and burn him.\u201cSix fools! You want to compare yourselves to young master Ji Ning!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to express how inferior you are.\u201d\u201cHahaha, almost thirty years old, but he wants to compare himself to young master Ji Ning? I\u2019m laughing so hard my stomach hurts!\u201dThose nearly hundred Xiantian lifeforms of the Swallow Mountain area all began to shout out and mock them.\u201cBeat them, beat them!\u201d The six men and women shouted angrily.Suddenly\u2026\u201cCome! Each one of you who comes shall die! However many comes, however many I shall kill! Hahaha\u2026\u201d That wild, frenzied voice was filled with both hysteria and utter, incomparable madness.\u201cWhat?!\u201d The faces of those six changed.They were certain that this wasn\u2019t the voice of the senior apprentice. Then\u2026it could be only the voice of that trapped young master Ji Ning.\u201cCan it be that our senior apprentice-brother died?\u201d They were all in a state of panic. Without question, the senior apprentice was by far the most powerful of their group. Even if he didn\u2019t use the many insidious options available to him, he was still incomparably strong.\u201cSenior apprentice-brother!\u201d\u201cSenior apprentice-brother!\u201dThe six men and women shouted outwards, but their senior apprentice-brother didn\u2019t respond.\u201cIf you want to find your senior apprentice-brother, then go to the Netherworld Kingdom!\u201d That wild, impudent voice rang out from afar.\u201cSenior apprentice-brother died.\u201d The six men and women looked at each other, their eyes filled with awe.\u201cKilled by a youth of just eleven or twelve years of age.\u201d\u201cOnly eleven or twelve, yet he was able to kill our senior apprentice-brother? Is\u2026is there such a monstrous talent in the world? Even in our school, there has never been such a monster. Most likely, only those legendary top-tier tribes under the protection of Immortals will there be monsters like this.\u201d The six were completely overawed. After all, they quite broad experience.Their own school was a major school.But they had never seen anyone eleven or twelve years old who was so possible.\u201cKakaka\u2026\u201d The iron board in the center of the mountain began to slowly swing open, revealing that dark, gloomy tunnel. The tunnel had a hint of green light emanating from within it, and its cold, sinister aura caused the six men and women to shiver.\u201cMy boy Gan!\u201d That shrill voice was quavering. \u201cThat \u2018Ji Ning\u2019 killed my boy Gan. He will die, definitely die!!!\u201dThe six men and women felt their hearts shake. As for those servants, all of them were shuddering. None of them could predict what this person would do when enraged.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat \u2018Ji Ning\u2019 is only eleven or twelve years old? What a monster. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he is an enemy, I would recommend him for entry into our school. But he killed my boy Gan! He must die!\u201d The shrill voice was filled with hate. \u201cLittle Seven, come in.\u201d\u201cCome in?\u201d The handsome youth was startled.He had never before entered the cavern in the mountain. That was a forbidden area.\u201cQuick, enter.\u201d The shrill voice carried anger within it.\u201cYes.\u201d The handsome youth didn\u2019t dare to hesitate any longer. Clearing his throat, he hurriedly walked towards the black tunnel, then leapt into the cavern.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was nearly three hundred meters deep, and the handsome youth, when jumping down, released his Xiantian Ki, allowing himself to descend as lightly as a goose feather, while at the same time, every so often, he would grab onto the sides of the dark tunnel to slow his descent. After a while, he finally stepped on the ground.\u201cThis is so deep. Uh, where is Master\u2019s secret room?\u201d The handsome youth hurriedly looked everywhere while carefully advancing through the winding tunnels. Up ahead, there was a dazzling green light. Soon, he reached an open stone door, behind which was an area filled with green life, as well as ripples which made the heart tremble.\u201cMaster.\u201d The handsome youth called out from outside the stone door.\u201cEnter.\u201d The shrill voice screeched.\u201cYes.\u201d The handsome youth suppressed his terror and walked in. This was a sealed stone room that was ten meters in diameter. In the center of the stone room, there was an enormous boulder, upon which was a man who wore loose black robes, had a skinny, pale face, and long, flowing black hair. The man\u2019s eyes emitted an otherworldly green light, and his entire body seemed to be made out of solidified evil.In front of this person was an enormous cauldron, and above the cauldron, there was a burning green flame that emitted a freezing aura. Beneath the green flame, there lay hovering an unadorned, blood-red cloth banner, which had a number of either hidden or visible ferocious faces on it. The faces were either screaming soundlessly or bellowing as they tried to swallow each other and battled each other.The entire cloth banner was surrounded by a layer of black light that was visible to the naked eye.\u201cSin!\u201d The handsome youth\u2019s heart was trembling. \u201cA grave sin.\u201dThose who did good accumulated karmic merit. Those who did evil accumulated sins.Those who had committed grave sins would naturally emanate a heart-shaking evil aura. But the aura of sin around the cloth banner was actually so strong, it was visible to the naked eye. This was simply astonishing.\u201cThis is a magic treasure which was born from endless amounts of sin.\u201d The handsome youth was both terrified as well as desirous. He knew very well that when one created this sort of magic treasure that was refined from sins, when one underwent the Three Calamities or Nine Tribulations, the power of the trials would be incomparably powerful. But this sort of magic treasure itself was incomparably, astonishingly powerful as well. This was why some evil schools were clearly committing countless grave sins, and yet were still able to continue forward in training to become an Immortal.It was because these evil paths allowed one to advance more quickly, and to even battle against foes of higher levels.\u201cNo wonder Master said that once his magic treasure is completed, he wouldn\u2019t even fear a Wanxiang Adept.\u201d The handsome youth couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201cLittle Seven.\u201d The long-haired man, seated in the lotus position, spoke in a shrill voice. \u201cMy boy Gan was my first disciple. He was like a son to me! This Ji Ning killed my son. How could I, Bei Goodson, possibly forgive him?\u201dThe handsome youth lowered his head.\u201cI need to refine this magic treasure. I can\u2019t spare any attention.\u201d Bei Goodson\u2019s green eyes stared at the handsome youth. Creating this sort of deeply sinful magic treasure was incomparably dangerous to begin with, and there were constant repercussions from the creation process. There were some people who were themselves bitten to death and had their souls dispersed by the dread wraiths they had created. Of course, if one truly wanted to force a pause, one could, but the price would also be great.\u201cLittle Seven, I bequeath unto you one Hearteater Powder.\u201d A bottle appeared out of nowhere in the palm of Goodson\u2019s right hand, and he casually tossed it towards the handsome youth.The handsome youth accepted it, then stared at the bottle in terror. \u201cHearteater Powder?\u201dHe had heard of the famous Hearteater Powder before.The price of this one bottle of Hearteater Powder was more valuable than even a ranked magic treasure. Countless Zifu Disciples had died to Hearteater Powder, and it was incredibly hard to procure. Even his own master had only been able to acquire this terrifying poison because he had been born into their school and had connections.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I can\u2019t be distracted, how would I possibly be willing to waste this Hearteater Powder?\u201d Goodson said shrilly. \u201cRemember. Smash the bottle within thirty meters of that Ji Ning, and he will definitely be poisoned. Once the Hearteater Powder enters his body, although it takes effect slowly and will need three days, it is virtually impossible to get rid of it once one has been poisoned. He, a mere Xiantian Fiendgod Body Refiner, will die without question, even if what he is training in is the legendary number one Fiendgod Body Refining, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]!\u201dThe handsome youth nodded\u201cRemember. You yourself need to be careful. Stay far away. If you are poisoned, come to me. I will give you the antidote.\u201d Goodson said.\u201cYour disciple is still competent to perform a minor task like releasing poison.\u201d The handsome youth said.\u201cGo.\u201d Goodson\u2019s gaze fell upon that blood-red cloth banner beneath the swirling green flames. The countless dread wraiths within the cloth banner occasionally appeared, extending their necks out towards Goodson and wildly trying to bite at him, but Goodson\u2019s oily green eyes remained cold and deadly.The handsome youth bowed respectfully, then left. When leaving this deep, dark tunnel, he jumped at high speed, occasionally clamping onto protruding pieces of rock on the stone walls. Soon afterwards, he left the tunnel.Kakaka\u2026The iron boards turned, and the tunnel was shut once more.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Within the black mist.The Waterflame Lotus surrounded him, and Ning\u2019s soul was currently pondering at high speed, with one hypothetical formation after another appearing within his mind, and the construction of the formation changing nonstop. As Ning frantically analyzed these formations, his level of understanding with regards to formations continued to rise.\u201cHuh?\u201d Ning suddenly felt a spike of fear.When a person\u2019s soul was as powerful as his, one would be able to unconsciously sense terrifying dangers approaching. The last time his soul had this feeling was when he was attempting the third trial in the ancient Aquatic Manor. This time, however, the feeling was even stronger than last time, as though no matter how he struggled, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to escape this danger.\u201cDanger?\u201d Ning opened his eyes to stare around himself.Suddenly\u2026The black fog in front of him to the right naturally parted, and in that instant, a large amount of white threads instantly wrapped towards him. In the distance, that handsome youth could be seen wielding a horsetail whisk in one hand and a Dao-seal in the other. The white threads of the horsetail whisk instantly attacked Ning.\u201cHmph.\u201d Twin swords appeared in Ning\u2019s hands, and the Waterflame Lotus blocked those white threads.\u201cBoom!\u201dIn that instant when those thousands of white strands and the Waterflame Lotus collided, it was as though something exploded. Only now did Ning realize that the thousands of white strands of had contained a bottle within it. In the instant their attacks had collided, the bottle had been smashed apart. Seeing the battle smash open, his soul could feeling that incomparably terrifying danger sense intensify, causing Ning\u2019s face to change.\u201cThere had to have been something in the bottle.\u201d Ning was no fool, but he couldn\u2019t see anything. It was odorless and invisible!The distant, handsome youth had immediately retracted his horsetail whisk in that instant the bottle had smashed open, and had also used his Escape Seal, immediately fleeing and disappearing.\u201cThis\u2026this bottle.\u201d Ning had an uneasy feeling.\u201cAh!\u201dSuddenly, a stabbing pain appeared in his heart. Ning\u2019s face turned ashen, and he held his chest. The Crimsonbright divine power in his body immediately began to search throughout his entire body, but no matter what, it still couldn\u2019t find any hint of poison. However, his heart continued to feel that slow, stabbing pain, and his entire body began to slowly ache. There was no way to stop it at all. Even his head was starting to hurt.\u201cWhat should I do? The poison has invaded my entire body, but my Crimsonbright divine power isn\u2019t able to sense it, nor can my divine will.\u201d Ning, at this moment, suddenly remembered the words of that old black bull in the underwater estate. He had been warned not to underestimate any opponent, especially those who trained to become Immortals.Immortal practitioners had varied techniques. One could simply use poison to kill you. No matter how powerful your ability to fight was, they could simply refuse to fight you.This was how Immortal practitioners were!Nobody knew what anyone else was truly capable of\u2026.\u201cHahaha.\u201d From afar, a delighted sound could be heard. \u201cJi Ning, no matter how monstrous of a genius you are, you will definitely die.\u201dWithin that great formation, Ning\u2019s face was unsightly. Although neither his divine will nor his Crimsonbright divine power could sense the poisonous elements, he could feel the pain wracking his entire body. This invisible poison was slowly, constantly devouring his entire body. Although the devouring process was slow, it was inexorable in its progress. Even his incomparably powerful Fiendgod lifeforce in his body was unable to remove it.\u201cWhat a fierce poison. Odorless, colorless, and undetectable.\u201d Ning was surprised. \u201cAlthough it isn\u2019t like some other poisons which instantly take effect, it seems to have embedded itself deep in every single cell. There\u2019s no way to remove it at all. If this continues, in most likely just two or three days, my body will be finished.\u201d\u201cTwo or three days?\u201dNing\u2019s eyes began wild.\u201cIn the last two or three days, even if I die, I will destroy this formation.\u201d Ning\u2019s heart was beginning to blaze with a heaven-reaching fury. \u201cI will wipe them all out, or if I\u2019m lucky, maybe even find the antidote on their bodies.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to run.\u201d\u201cI must destroy this formation!\u201dNing sat down in the lotus position and closed his eyes. The protective lotus flower swivelled around him as he once more frantically endeavoured to analyze formations.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Within the mountain.That handsome youth walked back, then glanced at Blindfish, Ji Jadewich, and the other members of the Ji clan, who had looks of shock and fury on their faces. The other members of the Ji clan of the East Prefecture, North Prefecture, South Prefecture, and Central Prefecture all looked at him angrily as well.\u201cWhat are you looking at? Your young master Ji Ning was poisoned. In three days, he will definitely die.\u201d The handsome youth was completely confident. \u201cForget about him. Even a Zifu Disciple who is poisoned by this poison will definitely die.\u201d\u201cOur Ji clan\u2019s Patriarch will definitely come.\u201d\u201cHe will definitely exterminate all of you, and he will also rescue young master Ji Ning.\u201dBlindfish and the others weren\u2019t willing to believe that Ji Ning would die.\u201cHahaha, your clan\u2019s Patriarch?\u201d The handsome youth laughed wildly. \u201cHow could a small tribe here in your Swallow Mountain possibly have poison of this level? Even in our school, this sort of poison is hard to obtain. Stop looking at me. I won\u2019t tell you what poison it is.\u201d\u201cGo die.\u201d\u201cYou will all definitely die.\u201dThe members of the Ji clan all cursed at him, and even the other bound Xiantian lifeforms began to curse in their despair.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWithin West Prefecture City of the Ji clan.Ji Yichuan was currently accompanying his wife, Yuchi Snow. Occasionally, he would look outside towards the door.Suddenly, through the door, he could see that from afar, an Azure Firebird appeared in the skies, with two people on its back. One was the red-clothed Ji Redflower, while the other was a red-haired, gray-robed elder. At a single glance, Ji Yichuan recognized him\u2026that was the true pillar for the entire Ji clan.The Ji clan\u2019s clan leader, Ji Ninefire!\u201cSnow, Snow, the clan leader is here.\u201d Yichuan hurriedly shouted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

According to legend, when Ninefire was young, he had an incomparably explosive temperament, but because Ninefire had lived nearly four centuries by now, while the oldest member of the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture was only a century or so in age, the stories of what Ninefire had been like when young were lost to legends.\u201cClan leader.\u201d Ji Yichuan, upon seeing the clan leader, immediately revealed a look of urgency in his eyes. \u201cSnow, she\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard from Redflower.\u201d Ninefire nodded. \u201cLet me take a look.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Yichuan immediately led the way forward. At this moment, Snow had already left her bed, curtseying respectfully. \u201cSnow greets the clan leader.\u201dNinefire said, \u201cYour body is very weak right now. First lie down. There\u2019s no need to stand on empty ceremonies.\u201dOnly then did Snow half lie down on the bed, while Ninefire sat on the chair by the side of the bed. He stretched his hand out, placing it against Snow\u2019s wrist, gently tapping with his finger\u2026immediately, a spot of red, fiery light immediately enveloped Snow\u2019s entire body. In this instant, it seemed as though Snow\u2019s entire body was covered by a layer of flames.Yichuan watched nervously by the side, while Ninefire\u2019s eyes were closed.As much time as was needed for a pot of tea to be brewed passed before the fiery light surrounding Snow\u2019s body vanished. Only now did Ninefire open his eyes as well. Facing Yichuan, whose face was filled with anticipation, Ninefire couldn\u2019t help but let a soft sigh, then gently shake his head. \u201cThe seeds of the illness have taken deep root. There\u2019s no way for it to be reversed.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d Yichuan\u2019s face instantly turned white.Ninefire sighed. \u201cThat year, your wife was a peak Xiantian expert. During that disaster, it was one thing for her foundation to have been damaged; if she had been immediately treated, it would have been fine. But your wife then executed that secret art which took her own life energy\u2026it was like another blow to her already heavily injured body, causing the illness to be even more deeply rooted! Unless you can find some sort of pill suitable for mortals to use to extend their lives\u2026there is no other method.\u201d\u201cLongevity-enhancing pill for mortals?\u201d Yichuan looked his wife, and Snow looked back at him. Their gazes intersected, and Snow sighed gently. \u201cYichuan, I understand my illness.\u201dIf it was just a matter of consuming a longevity-enhancing pill, although such a pill would be incomparably expensive, if Yichuan bankrupted himself, sold off all his possessions as well as the thousands of unranked magic treasures Ji Ning had given him, and also borrowed some money from the Ji clan, he might be able to acquire one such pill. But the additional requirement of \u2018suitable for mortals to use\u2019\u2026the price would instantly rise by several additional levels.The more powerful a medicinal pill, the more powerful the medicinal effect. A pill that was capable of extending a person\u2019s lifespan was a pill that defied the natural course of heaven. A pill that not only did this but also did it in such a way which allowed the weak, fragile bodies of a mortal to be able to endure the process\u2026the preciousness of such a pill was far beyond what the likes of the Ji clan could possibly imagine.\u201cYichuan.\u201d Ninefire said slowly, \u201cI\u2019ve refined some pills. I will immediately arrange for them to be sent over. Your wife should have another three months of life.\u201d\u201cThree months!\u201d Yichuan\u2019s face completely changed.Snow just revealed a smile. She said, \u201cYichuan.\u201d Yichuan hurriedly turned to look at his wife, who laughed and said, \u201cThree months is better than I had anticipated. I regret nothing. I did what I did that year in order to give birth to Ning. If I hadn\u2019t given birth to Ning, I might have been able to live an extra twenty years, but every single day of those twenty years, I would have been in a hell of regret. But now, every day of these ten years that I have lived, I have lived happily. It\u2019s enough, it\u2019s enough. Have Ning come back. I want to see him. As long as he is by my side, all is well!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Yichuan hurriedly nodded, then after pondering for a moment, shouted, \u201cBrother Black, Azure Firebird.\u201dImmediately, from outside, a black-clothed man and an azure-clothed woman stepped in. It was the human forms of the black serpent and the Azure Firebird.\u201cBrother Black.\u201d Yichuan said hurriedly. \u201cJi Ning will easily be able to recognize your voice. Thus, ride atop the Azure Firebird and quickly head to the border region between our Ji clan and the Ironwood clan.\u201d As he spoke, a map appeared in Yichuan\u2019s hands. He just casually glanced towards the door, making sure of their directions, then carefully sensed the location of the jade sword which Ning was holding.Staring at the map, Yichuan quickly ascertained a location. With a gentle tap of the finger, he pointed to a mountain on the map, and a spot of blood stained the map there. \u201cJi Ning is currently at this location. He hasn\u2019t moved this entire time. Based on my sense, although there are slight uncertainties regarding the distance between us, he\u2019s definitely within a hundred kilometers of this mountain. As long as you ride the Azure Firebird to the air above the mountain, then call for him and say that his mother is critically ill and that he is to quickly return, he will definitely hear it.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d The black-clothed man said hurriedly. \u201cYichuan, don\u2019t worry. Ning\u2019s hearing ability is far beyond that of ordinary people\u2019s. He should be able to hear my voice from as far as two or three hundred kilometers away.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t possible for mortals to project their voices a hundred kilometers, but it was simple for a Xiantian lifeform. For example, when Ning had been at Serpentwing Lake and shouted at Serpentwing, his voice had also projected throughout the lake.\u201cAzure Firebird, I\u2019ll have to trouble you to make a trip.\u201d Yichuan looked at the azure-garbed woman.\u201cA small matter.\u201d The Azure Firebird\u2019s voice was very gentle. \u201cWe can\u2019t delay for even a moment. I\u2019ll immediately head out along with Elder Brother Black.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d The black-clothed man also nodded right away.Taking the map with them, the black-garbed man quickly mounted onto the back of the Azure Firebird, then quickly flew towards the direction of the borders between the Ji clan and the Ironwood clan.\u201cNing, son.\u201d Snow watched as the Azure Firebird flew high into the sky, and in her heart she began to miss her son. The closer she drew to death, the more she wanted to see her son, her dearly beloved son.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013The Azure Firebird\u2019s speed was astonishingly fast. In less than two hours, she had already arrived in the air above that mountain.\u201cThis is the mountain.\u201d The black serpent nodded. From high up in the air, it was very easy to recognize the landscape below.\u201cElder Brother Black, call for him right away.\u201d The Azure Firebird urged.\u201cRight.\u201d The black serpent stared below, then immediately infused his voice with monstrous energy, shouting loudly, \u201cYoung master Ji Ning, your mother is critically ill. Quickly return!\u201d\u201cYoung master Ji Ning, your mother is critically ill. Quickly return!\u201d This voice echoed down from the heavens, quickly covering an area of two hundred kilometers of the forests and mountain below. And directly beneath them, deep within that mountain\u2026there were a million commoners, whom the two spirit-beasts didn\u2019t notice at all.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Within the mountain.Those Xiantian lifeforms that were bound to the pillars were still undergoing countless amounts of torment. They had to endure torture, and yet they were still kept alive. This was because the longer they were tortured, the greater the rage and hatred these Xiantian lifeforms would feel! The more powerful, the deeper their hatred, the fiercer the dread wraiths their souls would transform into.\u201cYoung master Ji Ning, your mother is critically ill. Quickly return!\u201d The voice drifted down from far above.Although a great formation was hidden here, causing the curses and cries of the million commoners within to be trapped and unable to leave, the sounds from the outside world could still come in\u2026it was much as how the Zifu Disciple, \u2018Bei Zishan\u2019, was deep within the secret in the mountain and could hear the sounds from the outside world, even though the sounds from within the secret room wouldn\u2019t go out.That way, they could more easily detect what was going on in the outside world.\u201cYoung master Ji Ning, your mother is critically ill. Quickly return!\u201d The voice echoed throughout the mountains, the voice shockingly loud.\u201cWhat a loud voice.\u201d\u201cWho is shouting up there?\u201dThe six beautifully dressed men and women all looked upwards towards the sky, with one of them, a scraggly, bearded man, hurriedly saying, \u201cFellow apprentices, do you hear that? They are calling for that Ji Ning.\u201d\u201cJi Ning\u2019s mother is critically ill?\u201d The women with the scorpion said in surprise. \u201cHis mother\u2019s ill?\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d The most muscular man of the group, a man with cyan hair, began to laugh loudly. \u201cThat Ji Ning is a monstrously talented figure. If he is allowed to develop, who knows how terrifying he will be in the future? But he won\u2019t be able to live for more than three days, and is trapped within the formation. His mother is clearly critically ill, but even if he shouts until he is hoarse, his voice won\u2019t escape!\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d The handsome youth sighed. \u201cMost likely, he is in a state of extreme rage right now.\u201d\u201cI must say, this Ji Ning really is a formidable figure. At eleven or twelve years of age, he was able to kill our senior martial-apprentice. But his final doom is so pitiful. He will pass away in the midst of despair, rage, pain, and regret. Hahaha\u2026this is the end of this genius!\u201dThese fellow apprentices chatted amongst themselves. They could imagine how Ji Ning currently felt, which made them feel all the more delighted.\u201cMadame is critically ill?\u201d\u201cYuchi Snow is critically ill?\u201dThe Ji clan of the West Prefecture\u2019s Blindfish, Ji Jadewich, Poortile, and other members were all incomparably astonished, enraged, and filled with hate. At the same time, they felt a hint of pity for Ji Ning. After all, he had less than three days to live, and his mother was critically ill, yet he had no way to return\u2026this sort of pain must be heart-breaking.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Right. Everything was exactly as how those fellow apprentices deep in the mountain imagined. It was also exactly as Blindfish and the others feared. Ning was currently feeling utterly agony and grief in his heart.\u201cMother!\u201d\u201cMother!\u201d Ning\u2019s tears began to fall down uncontrollably. He was in such pain, his entire body trembled. His heart felt as though it was being cut by a knife. That woman who had loved him since he was a child, that woman who had treated him as her world\u2026that woman who always, uncontrollably doted on him. She was actually critically ill? Critically ill?\u201cAaaaaah!\u201d Ning suddenly threw his head upwards, letting out a howl of incomparable pain. This howl spread throughout the mountain, but no matter what, it couldn\u2019t spread out from it.As for those six men and women within the mountain residence, when they heard the howl, their hearts couldn\u2019t help but tremble. That could sense the boundless grief and pain contained within that howl.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cYoung master Ji Ning.\u201d Blindfish wept. That precocious, brilliant four year old toddler who he had personally taught archery\u2026how had he ended up like this? This was even more agonizing and terrifying that the torture his body had endured.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cI\u2019m going to leave, I\u2019m going to leave, I\u2019m going to leave.\u201d Ning\u2019s voice was quavering. \u201cBreak the formation! I\u2019m going to break the formation!\u201dNing forced his eyes shut.An incomparably powerful surge of emotion swept his entire body, filling his entire spirit. He was going to break the formation!!! He had to leave it, he had to go see that woman who treated him as more important than her life. He had to see her!!! Otherwise, even if he died and went to the Netherworld Kingdom, he would feel incomparable guilt and regret!\u201cBreak the formation. I\u2019m going to break the formation.\u201d Ning\u2019s closed eyes were trembling, and his soul, filled with this incomparably powerful emotion that was even greater than what was felt at the moment between life and death, reached a new limit as he frantically visualized methods for the breaking of this formation.Blood began to leak out from Ning\u2019s nose, and blood was coming from his ears as well.Clearly, this surge of powerful emotion had injured his body.\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Ning\u2019s soul, which had been constantly testing out new formations, suddenly halted. An incomparably complicated formation model suddenly appeared in his mind, which contained every possible variable within it.Ning opened his eyes.\u201cMother!\u201d Ning raised his head, letting out a frenzied howl. \u201cI will go back to see you, I will definitely go back to see you! Wait for your child!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euImmediately, he transformed into a blur, moving through the formation. Ning moved like a ghost, quickly reaching a place which was still covered with thick black mist, but which had a black formation flag inserted into the earth. The runes atop the formation flag were currently fashing. Ning reached out, directly grabbing the flag and giving it a powerful pull.Instantly, the black mist that had been covering the entire world vanished, revealing a clearly visible mountain scene. From afar, many servants were staring in astonishment towards him.\u201cWhat.\u201d The six men and women rushed out of the mountain, staring in his direction with astonishment. \u201cThe formation was destroyed!\u201dNing was holding the formation flag in his hand, the light of utter madness in his eyes.\u201cKill! Kill him! Kill him at all costs! He cannot be permitted to leave this place alive!\u201d Suddenly, a shrill voice filled with incomparable rage emanated from underground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Kill! \u201cHe cannot be permitted to leave this place alive!\u201d Those six lavishly dressed men and women began to shout as well. They knew very that with their formation broken and with the protective, hiding shroud which it had given them gone, they would quickly be discovered\u2026and once Ji Ning escaped, the news would quickly spread and they would immediately be found. They had to capture back the formation flag to this bewildering formation! Ji Ning had to be executed as well! \u201cKill!\u201d \u201cKill him!\u201d A large number of servants charged wildly towards Ji Ning as well. Ning immediately stored the formation flag into his storage-type magic treasure, while at the same time, the wing-type magic treasures on his back immediately activated as he rushed outwards. At the same time, a boundless amount of scorching fire immediately descended, which surrounded those servants and began to burn them, causing the servants to all scream in agony. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Three figures from within the group of servants came pouncing out towards Ning. \u201cXiantian lifeforms?\u201d Ning immediately recognized that all three of them were Xiantian lifeforms. \u201cIt seems this despicable Immortal practitioner has quite a few Xiantian lifeforms under his control.\u201d \u201cKill him.\u201d \u201cThe Master has given the order to kill him.\u201d These three Xiantian lifeforms were filled with murderous intent. They were all servants of Bei Zishan who were controlled through poisons. They didn\u2019t dare to disobey the orders of Bei Zishan\u2019s orders. Immediately, they transformed into rays of light, streaking from different directions to attack Ning, but Ning simply used his Windwing Evasion technique to move forward and directly clash with one of them, a fat-headed, big-eared, bearded man. \u201cRaaaawr!\u201d The big fellow was wielding a large hammer. Swish! A sword light flashed, and the big fellow rolled to the ground, falling down while clutching his chest, blood staining the ground. In but a single exchange, Ning\u2019s sword had pierced through his heart! \u201cLittle baby.\u201d A hawk-nosed man roared angrily as he charged forward, and as he did, a flash of sword light chopped half his head off, and he died on the spot. The third Xiantian lifeform, an older man, was so terrified, his face changed and he immediately retreated. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Boundless amounts of flame descended, and two Xiantian lifeforms had been killed in an instant as well. The third had been so terrified, he had immediately retreated. This caused those six men and women to stare at each other, the looks on their faces unpleasant. \u201cWhat terrifying speed!\u201d \u201cHis swordplay is far superior to any of us. No wonder he was able to kill our senior fellow apprentice.\u201d All of them understand that even if they all charged together, the result would most likely be that single same word; \u2018death\u2019. Right now, Ning was like a life-taking god of death. On one side, boundless amounts of fire scorched those servants, while on his side, he had slaughtered those Xiantian lifeforms. All together, the servants, spirit-beasts, and disciples of Bei Zishan totaled more than ten Xiantian lifeforms. \u201cFlood Dragon Dao-Soldiers!\u201d The youngest of the six, that handsome youth, suddenly let out a fierce howl. \u201cFlood Dragon Dao-Soldiers.\u201d The other five fellow apprentices immediately understood. All of them shouted furiously, while at the same time, their bodies quickly became covered with a layer of black armor. The six of them were now all garbed in the same black armor. \u201cRumble\u2026\u201d For a moment, the entire mountain seemed to tremble. This great mountain had actually been hollowed out long ago. Aside from the primary place midway up the mountain, there had been a large number of smaller caverns dug out as well. After all, more than a million commoners were being tortured here. From this number, one could imagine how many caves had been created to hold them. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Like raindrops falling from the skies in a dense cluster, from each mountain cave flew out one deep green armored Dao-Soldier after another. Each Dao-Soldier was covered with complicated, ancient runes which drew upon the energy of the world. \u201cDao-Soldiers!\u201d Ning\u2019s face changed. He watched as from afar, a large number of soldiers emerged from the hundreds of caves in the mountain. He immediately recognized them for Dao-Soldiers! \u201cIn addition, these are even more powerful Dao-Soldiers than the \u2018Crimson Guard\u2019 of my Ji clan.\u201d Given his experience, Ning naturally could sense the power of those runes on these Dao-Soldier\u2019s armor, causing him to be all the more surprised. More than ten thousand Dao-Soldiers descended from the skies. And there were more than ten black armored Xiantian lifeform Dao-Soldiers as well, all charging forward. \u201cKill. Kill as many as I can.\u201d Ning understood that he definitely couldn\u2019t let them join forces. He immediately swept out with his wings, moving like a giant Roc towards a location a kilometer away. These Dao-Soldiers were virtually all at the Houtian level, and thus were much faster. \u201cAll of you, die!\u201d Ji Ning, his face spotted red thanks to the poison, had gone completely insane. In an instant, an enormous amount of celestial fire and boundless amounts of freezing frost descended from the skies, wildly sweeping out in each direction. Ning was currently exhausting all of his power to control water and fire. \u201cCareful.\u201d \u201cAssemble the formation!\u201d Of the more than ten thousand Dao-Soldiers, every nine of them linked up, summoning forth the power of the natural world. Faintly, behind their bodies, the illusion of a dragon appeared. Faced with the attack of that scorching flame and freezing frost, most of those who had linked up just barely managed to withstand the attack, while those who had not instantly lost their lives, especially those who were at the center of the flames and of the frost. The surges of heat and cold intersected, causing even those who had linked up to lose their lives. \u201cGrand Flood Dragon Formation!\u201d The ten-plus black-armored Xiantian lifeforms wanted to charge together in formation as well. \u201cNot good.\u201d In the Aquatic Manor, Ning had seen nine Xiantian lifeforms using Dao-Soldier armors. How could he just stand by idly and permit these ten or so people to do as they pleased? \u201cWaterflame Lotus, grind them all to death!\u201d In an instant, Ning formed nine Waterflame Lotuses, surrounding nine of those people. The nine Waterflame Lotuses appeared out of nowhere, each with one petal of fire and one petal of water, one above and one below, and they ground down at their targets. \u201cAaaah!\u201d The woman with the viper on her shoulder let out a shrill scry, and was killed, ground into fine pieces. \u201cQuick.\u201d \u201cAssemble the formation.\u201d Although all of them wanted to assemble the formation, of the nine people covered by Waterflame Lotuses, six of them had already died while three were heavily injured. This caused the remaining Xiantian lifeforms to all be shocked\u2026this sort of ability was simply too terrifying. At such a great distance, this man was capable of simultaneously killing six Xiantian lifeforms? Generally speaking, Xiantian lifeforms weren\u2019t capable of long-distance attacks, because they were unable to ride on magic treasures to engage in distant attacks. The six dead people were quite unfortunate; they weren\u2019t afraid of the fire and water which Ning was capable of controlling, but they hadn\u2019t expected that Ning would execute this \u2018Waterflame Lotus\u2019, which contained a hint of the True Meaning of the Dao. If they had known in advance, they would have all immediately prepared protective Dao-seals, and thus wouldn\u2019t have instantly lost their lives. \u201cAssemble the formation!\u201d The handsome youth\u2019s black armor immediately began to glow with runes, while at the same time those runes which appeared connected with the illusory dragons behind the many ordinary Dao-Soldiers, connecting together into a large whole. In the blink of an eye, the handsome youth connected with a thousand of the ordinary Dao-Soldiers, and behind him appeared the illusion of a Flood Dragon. \u201cAssemble the formation.\u201d \u201cAssemble the formation.\u201d One Xiantian lifeform after another immediately began to link together with the Dao-soldiers. Some activated a thousand, while others activated five hundred. Although the maximum was a thousand Dao-Soldiers, Ning had killed simply too many of them. \u201cUnfortunately, too many Dao-Soldiers have died, and we don\u2019t even have nine thousand. Otherwise, once we combined to form the entire Flood Dragon, we could effortlessly kill him.\u201d One illusory Flood Dragon after another appeared in mid-air, resulting in a total of eight illusory Flood Dragons, which were controlled and formed by those eight Xiantian lifeforms and thousands of Dao-Soldiers joining formings. \u201cBut even though we aren\u2019t able to transform into a greater Flood Dragon, he will still die.\u201d \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Deep within the mountain, in that private room. The green flame continued to flicker in the middle of that ancient, unadorned cauldron. The blood red banner was currently hovering there, as a large number of dread wraiths were howling silently, wildly attacking. Bei Zishan was seated in the lotus position, his face incomparably sinister. \u201cThis person named Ji Ning was actually able to break my grand formation.\u201d Zishan was both frantic and angry. He himself had been, this entire time, hiding, fleeing, and trying to refine this powerful magic treasure and thus suddenly rise in power. But without this great formation hiding him, there was no way for him to hide at all. In addition, there were still many dread wraiths that had yet to be absorbed. Right now, what he was trying to do was forcibly bring the process to a halt, as he would rather give up the many dread wraiths. However, this sort of incomparably sinful magic treasure was also incomparably dangerous to make. If he wasn\u2019t careful, he would be devoured by it instead. He had to be extremely careful and cautious, even in an attempt to stop\u2026he still had to kill each and every single one of those dread wraiths who had yet to be refined before he could be killed. If he tried to do it forcibly, he himself would be devoured. To come to a halt needed time. \u201cMaster, there are less than nine thousand Dao-Soldiers.\u201d From within the mountain, a spirit-beast who had transformed into a human male\u2019s form called out frantically. \u201cWhat!\u201d Bei Zishan, currently forcibly repressing his agitation, upon hearing the words from his spirit-beast, immediately grew frantic. \u201cLess than nine thousand Dao-Soldiers? With less than nine thousand, there\u2019s no way to transform into a giant Flood Dragon. Given the power of this Ning, he can absolutely flee.\u201d Right at this moment, the blood-red banner suddenly began to shake, as countless dread wraiths wildly attempted to break free. \u201cNot good.\u201d Bei Zishan forced himself to calm down. He knew that as soon as he lost his grip, those dread wraiths would throw themselves upon him, and he would probably die here today. Bei Zishan immediately made a small bag appear in his hand, which appeared similar to a brocade purse. From within the little purse, a black coffin appeared out of nowhere, which with a thud landed against the ground. The coffin immediately opened, and a heart-trembling aura emanated forth. A large paw, covered with black fur, grabbed the sides of the coffin, and then sat up. This was a black-furred zombie which had glowing green eyes. Whoosh. The black-furred zombie landed on the ground, its body surrounded by a black energy that was visible to the naked eye. The black energy was a necromantic aura, and if a Xiantian lifeform were to absorb it, that person would definitely be poisoned to death. This zombie\u2026was one of the final trump cards which Bei Zishan had. He had worked hard to create it from the corpse of a Zifu Disciple. \u201cGo. Kill him.\u201d Zishan gave the order. Zombies were neither living nor dead. The black-furred zombie was at the level where it had a certain degree of intelligence. It could recognize the disciples of Zishan, and it could also quickly recognize situations as well as whom its enemies were. This black-furred zombie was already comparable to a Zifu Disciple, and it was extremely dangerous. \u201cUmm.\u201d The black-furred zombie let out a low grunt, then walked out, then with a single leap, jumped out from the nearly 150 meter deep tunnel.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Azure Firebird and the black serpent were currently high in the air, waiting impatiently. They were under orders to locate Ji Ning, but previously, the black serpent had already shouted three times, without any response at all. \u201cCan it be that the young master isn\u2019t here?\u201d The black serpent said frantically. \u201cBrother Black, look below.\u201d The Azure Firebird spoke in the human tongue. The black serpent looked downwards, only to see that on the formerly calm mountain, a large number of armored Dao-Soldiers had appeared, surrounded by frost and with fires blazing\u2026those Dao-Soldiers and Xiantian lifeforms had forcibly formed into eight illusory Flood Dragons, and the power emanating from those illusory Flood Dragons caused even the Azure Firebird and the black serpent in the air to feel shock. \u201cDao-Soldiers\u2026thousands of them that can join together?\u201d The Azure Firebird and the black serpent were shocked. The various local hegemons of Swallow Mountain weren\u2019t capable of such things. Only the Grand Xia Dynasty\u2019s soldiers that were stationed at Southmont City were capable of this. \u201cSuch power\u2026even if the two of us were to go attack, we\u2019d probably be easily annihilated.\u201d \u201cLook, young master Ji Ning.\u201d In front of these thousands of Dao-Soldiers, appeared a beast-clad youth who was emanating an aura of incomparable wildness and savagery. It was Ning! \u201cYoung master Ji Ning! How can he possibly oppose thousands of joined Dao-Soldiers?!\u201d \u201cJi Ning, quick, flee!\u201d The black serpent shouted frantically in the air. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Those Xiantian lifeforms bound against the pillars within the mountain stared towards the outside nervously as well. Outside, the boundless amounts of flame and frost that had appeared caused them to be shocked as well. \u201cYoung master Ji Ning, that Zifu Disciple is currently refining that evil magic treasure. For now, he can\u2019t be distracted. Quick, flee!\u201d Blindfish howled frantically. \u201cJi Ning, quick, leave! If you dawdle, it\u2019ll be too late!\u201d Ji Jadewich roared as well, his throat going hoarse. \u201cQuick, leave!\u201d All of the Xiantian lifeforms of the Ji clan were shouting frantically. They had been bound here for so long, and often heard the conversation of those people, and saw some dread wraiths enter the depths of the mountain\u2026they knew that there was a Zifu Disciple here refining an incomparably vile magic treasure. Once this person completed it and personally attacked, what would the repercussions be? \u201cWhat? Thousands of linked Dao-Soldiers?\u201d The group of bound Xiantian lifeforms suddenly saw that those many Dao-Soldiers who were being burnt by fire or frozen by frost suddenly formed into multiple illusory Flood Dragons. They were only able to see a small portion, but this was already enough to shock them. \u201cQuick, flee\u201d \u201cJi Ning, leave now!\u201d All of them were incomparably frantic. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Hearing the frantic shouts from his Uncle Black from the skies, as well as the voices of his Master Blindfish, Ji Jadewich, Poortile, Ji Shan, and the others who were bound deeper in the mountain, how could Ji Ning, already poisoned, not go even wilder? Flee? Why would he flee? Even if he fled, he would unquestionably die. If he could risk his life to kill that Zifu Disciple, he might instead have a chance at life. \u201cKill!\u201d Ning saw the thousands of Dao-Soldiers in front of him. Not hesitating at all, he released his most powerful killing blow. Rumble\u2026. More than three hundred sword-type magic treasures appeared out of nowhere around Ning, every single sword glowing dimly with white light, while at same time activating the power of the natural world. Ning had already reached a very high level of attainment in formations, and so his ability to execute the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] had clearly improved greatly as well. It wasn\u2019t like in the past, where he controlled it by rote and by memory; he now understood some of the mysteries inherent within, and knew how to guide them more effectively. \u201cWhat are those?!\u201d \u201cHow can swords fly like that?\u201d \u201cFlying magic treasures?\u201d The eight Xiantian lifeforms amongst those thousands of Dao-Soldiers were completely stunned. Seeing the hundreds of flying swords all hovering there, they instantly thought of something\u2026Zifu Disciple! One had to at least be a Zifu Disciple in order to control magic treasures and fly on them. This was all but common knowledge. But now, this youth was actually flying on magic treasures. But how could they have imagined that Ning\u2019s soul had already reached the level of \u2018divine will\u2019, which was why he was able to accomplish this? \u201cHe\u2019s a Zifu Disicple, Master, he\u2019s a Zifu Disciple. That youth is a Zifu Disicple!\u201d Some of the Xiantian lifeforms in the Dao Battle-Armor were already beginning to cry out desolately. \u201cDie, then.\u201d Ning instantly controlled that pulsating, glowing sword in front of him. Swish! That pulsating sword light immediately slashed out in an incomparably beautiful arc, leaving behind a desolate, beautiful line in the air. It easily chopped through that handsome youth\u2019s chest, and the handsome youth stared, wide-eyed, in disbelief. \u201cZifu\u2026Zifu\u2026\u201d Even in death, he couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cNo!\u201d The tall, muscular fellow just began to cry out, but before he finished it, he was pierced through by the sword glow as well. Their Dao-Soldier formation hadn\u2019t truly formed into a Flood Dragon, after all; they had only formed eight illusory Floor Dragons. Every single illusory Flood Dragon was formed from a single Xiantian lifeform Dao-Soldier and hundreds or a thousand Houtian Dao-Soldiers. In terms of defense alone, they were actually inferior to the combined forces of the nine Xiantian Dao-Soldiers of the second trial of the Aquatic Manor. Ning was naturally capable of winning through close combat and using the True Meaning of the Raindrop, but doing so would be very tiring, and he would have to face a group attack. But now\u2026 By relying on this level four [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], he was able to bring forth the power of an early Zifu Disciple using a ranked magic treasure. Even if the enemy truly had nine thousand Dao-Soldiers and nine Xiantian lifeforms and was capable of forming into a true Flood Dragon, Ning would still be able to fight. And now, when the enemy was like a platter of loose sand, unshaped and unformed, he naturally chopped through them as easily as chopping through vegetables. \u201cZifu Disciple!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a Zifu Disicple.\u201d The sword light slashed out in another graceful arc, piercing through those eight Xiantian Dao-Soldiers in sucession. No matter how those Xiantian Dao-Soldiers attempted to flee, their speed was incomparably slower than the speed of that sword light. Even though the nearby Houtian Dao-Soldiers all tried to help block, those Houtian Dao-Soldiers were simply executed as well. \u201cA Zifu Disicple!\u201d \u201cZifu Disciple!\u201d One desolate scream after another shook the entire mountain. These Xiantian Dao-Soldiers were filled to the brim with unwillingness to accept this. They hadn\u2019t imagined that this youth named Ji Ning was actually a Zifu Disciple! Ordering them to battle against a Zifu Disciple? They weren\u2019t able to accept that this was how they would die. If they had known, they wouldn\u2019t have come out at all. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \u201cWhat.\u201d \u201cThis\u2026.\u201d In mid-air, the Azure Firebird and the black serpent watched with wide eyes, their mouths hanging open. From below, Ning was controlling hundreds of swords which were hovering in the air, and then formed into a single sword light which was dominating everyone and everything. This was power on a completely different level. Much like how Xiantian lifeforms could massacre Houtian experts, that sword light effortlessly executed those eight Xiantian Dao-Soldiers, and with their deaths, those Houtian Dao-Soldiers naturally were unable to maintain their grand formation. \u201cNing, he\u2026he\u2019s a Zifu Disciple?\u201d The black serpent, who had watched Ning grow up since he was a child, was somewhat stunned as well. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Even Blindfish, Jadewich, Shan, and the others trapped within the mountain who had been frantically calling for Ning to flee were stunned. From this angle, they couldn\u2019t see Ning, but through the cave entrance, they were able to see many Dao-Soldiers. They personally saw those Dao-Soldiers dressed in black armor, which was to say the Xiantian Dao-Soldiers, be easily pierced through one by one by an incomparably brilliant sword light. All of those Xiantian Dao-Soldiers collapsed, dead. In addition, as they died, all of them were howling with grief and rage, \u201cZifu Disciple!\u201d \u201cA Zifu Disciple!\u201d \u201cA Zifu Disciple?\u201d Blindfish and the others, including the other pitiable Xiantian lifeforms from the other powers here at the Swallow Mountain region, were all somewhat numb. Could it be that aside from Ning, there was another Zifu Disciple who was attacking? But right at this moment\u2026 Bang! A black shadow suddenly leapt out from the already opened entrance to that dark underground cave. His green pupils swept those Xiantian lifeforms who were bound within this cave. There were still some ordinary servants here who hadn\u2019t joined the battle. Two unlucky bastards, because they had been fairly close to the cave entrance, had their bodies immediately invaded by the black necromantic energy swirling around the black-furred zombie when it appeared. \u201cAhhh!\u201d \u201cAhhh!\u201d The two unlucky bastards hadn\u2019t been able to become Dao-Soldiers. Naturally, they were quite ordinary in ability. As soon as the necromantic aura invaded their bodies, they let out desolate howls, then quickly dissolved into puddles of liquid. The black-furred zombie had already, with a single step, moved past the cave entrance. \u201cYoung master, be careful!\u201d Blindfish howled frantically. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Ning, after seeing that the Xiantian Dao-Soldiers had been executed, retrieved his three hundred plus swords. After all, he was still just an early stage Xiantian lifeform. The Xiantian ki in his body wasn\u2019t dense enough! If he were to control thousands of swords, his ki would probably be used up in a single attack. If he just used these three hundred or so, he was still only able to execute it ten times. His true opponent was that truly terrifying Zifu Disciple. \u201cRoaaaaar.\u201d An angry roar rang out, and from the distance, a black shadow flew over. \u201cIs that the Zifu Disciple?\u201d Ning\u2019s wing-type magic treasure trembled, and he immediately flew out in an arc, putting some distance between them. With a smashing sound, that black shadow smashed into the ground, causing a massive, thirty meter wide crater to appear on the ground. When Ning saw this, the look on his face changed. The black-furred zombie stared at Ning, that black, fog-like necromantic aura swirling around his body. \u201cThis fellow is so strong, and his speed is very fast.\u201d Ning was still stunned, and he even was reminded of that black-furred aberration who had served as the third trial in the Aquatic Manor. However, this black-furred zombie gave Ning an evil, baleful feeling, and had that black fog swirling around his body. That aberration who served as the third trial in the Aquatic Manor didn\u2019t. \u201cKill.\u201d The black-furred zombie stared at Ning, then charged towards him. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Activating the wing-type magic treasures, Ning moved like a ghost, constantly dodging. Although each time he dodged, it was rather difficult, he was still able to evade. Occasionally, the Darknorth swords in his hands would land blows on the black-furred zombie, but only white smudges were left on it. \u201cThis fellow seems quite similar to the black-furred aberration in the Aquatic Manor. His strength is great, his speed is fast, and his body is incomparably tough. However, his strength is much lower.\u201d In their exchange of blows, Ning immediately discovered that the black-furred zombie\u2019s method of using force was very clumsy, while the black-furred creature in the underwater estate has intelligence. In terms of both footwork and palm techniques, although each movement seemed simple, even with Ning\u2019s miraculous evasion techniques, he still couldn\u2019t dodge. \u201cNot even at the advanced level of technique. Definitely not a Zifu Disciple. The antidote to my poison is probably being carried by that Zifu Disciple. He hasn\u2019t come out, which means he definitely isn\u2019t able to be distracted right now. I have to seize the opportunity to get rid of him.\u201d Ning understood that for the Zifu Disciple to still not come out meant the man was definitely in a tough situation. While he was ill, go for the kill! Swoosh! The wing-type magic treasures on Ning\u2019s back trembled, then took him in an arcing line, moving past the black-furred zombie. The zombie howled ferociously, wanting to attack Ning, but how could Ning, when using the [Windwing Evasion], be caught by the likes of him? \u201cJi Ning?\u201d A sinister, cold, sharp voice suddenly emanated out from the mountain. Ning immediately saw that midway in the mountain, at the ground in front of the cavern entrance, there was a man dressed in a loose black robe. This man\u2019s hair was loosely bound, and his face was utterly ashen, without a hint of color. The oily green eyes the man had caused even greater shock to Ning than the black-furred zombie had.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3 \u2013 A Battle To the Death!Bei Zishan swept the surrounding area with his gaze. He saw the areas frozen by frost or scorched by flames and those many corpses. In particular, when he saw, amongst the corpses, the bodies of those Xiantian lifeform Dao-Soldiers, Zishan\u2019s heart clenched. He ached! These were his subordinates. For forging and refining this sort of sinful magic treasure, he needed many subordinates to torment and torture people, and also some powerful subordinates to capture Xiantian lifeforms for him.\u201cAll ruined.\u201d Zishan looked towards Ji Ning, his gaze filled with a sinister maliciousness. \u201cMy students and servants were all wiped out by you. Those potential dread wraiths that I had been cultivating and refining for so long, and was about to finish with\u2026you forced me to stop. I, Bei Zishan, was actually by a little child like you to suffer such a loss! I won\u2019t mistreat you. In fact, I will have to \u2018thank\u2019 you and let you have a taste of what it is like to have your soul be tormented!\u201cZifu Disciple.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a Zifu Disciple.\u201dAmidst the thousands of Dao-Soldiers, there were still quite a few screaming in terror.\u201cYou are a Zifu Disciple?\u201d Bei Zishan stared at Ning. After all, his evil magic treasure was only half completed because of Ning\u2019s interruption. However, even with this half-completed magic treasure, Zishan could be considered a peak Zifu figure. Based on the discussion between his disciples, however, this Ning was just a twelve year old youth of the Ji clan.A twelve year old who had become a Zifu Disciple?If this was true! Then Zishan was actually worried. For someone so young to have become a Zifu Disciple most likely meant that this person had some miraculous events occur. Perhaps he might have some sort of hidden, secret technique.\u201cZifu Disciple? If I said I wasn\u2019t a Zifu Disciple, would you believe me?\u201d Ning said coldly.Swoosh!Zishan had been just standing there, but suddenly, a boat appeared beneath his legs. Stepping onto the boat, Zishan instantly began to pull away from Ning. Zishan, dressed in his long black robed, stared coldly at Ning. He had already decided to consider that Ning was an expert on the same level as him, and so he immediately pulled away.Immortal practitioners came in all types. Fiendgod Body Refiners preferred close combat, while others who liked to use magic treasures, poisons, golems, and more would naturally prefer to pull to a distance before using their techniques. After all, close quarters combat was very dangerous. Bei Zishan, for example, liked to use poisons and magic treasures.\u201cBoom!\u201d A black claw suddenly appeared, sweeping forwards and attacking Ning from behind.Ning\u2019s wing-type magic treasure trembled, and he flew out in an arc, immediately dodging past. As for that black claw, the wind from the attack alone had caused the ground to tear apart. The black-furred zombie, bellowing, charged towards Ning.\u201cBei Zishan, prepare to die!\u201d Ning, while dodging the black-furred zombie, simultaneously manifested more than four hundred sword-type magic treasures, all of which were under Ning\u2019s control and immediately emanated a blurry white light.\u201cIndeed. There\u2019s no need to forcibly control them all. All I need to do is just guide them into the correct flow. When I simply control the critical points of the Lesser Thousand Sword Formation\u2026it becomes much easier to control this Lesser Thousand Sword Formation.\u201d Ning previously, while meditating on formations, had tested out the fifth level of the Lesser Thousand Sword Formation. At the underwater mansion, although he had been able to use it, it had been too exhausting.But this time, it was clearly much easier for him. In addition, thanks to Ning\u2019s nonstop testing, his control over the 405 sword-type magic treasures had become much more dexterous, and it became easier and easier for Ning\u2019s \u2018divine will\u2019 to control them.\u201cMagic treasures!\u201d Zishan, astride his flying boat, saw this from afar. His face changed. \u201cHe\u2019s able to control magic treasures and fly on them. So he is indeed a Zifu Disciple! So many sword-type magic treasures\u2026.most likely they are almost all unranked, but so many unranked magic treasures joined together still pose a formidable threat.\u201d\u201cRoaaaaaaar.\u201d Growling, the black-furred zombie was still in pursuit of Ning, attacking again and again.Ning, relying on his incomparably dexterous Windwing Evasion, was able to dodge aside time and time again. In a battle of life and death, one had to rely on one\u2019s advantages. This black-furred zombie clearly was incomparably strong and indestructibly tough. Battling with it head on was simply idiocy. Ning naturally understood that this black-furred zombie was probably reared by Bei Zishan. As long as he could kill Zishan, there would be no need to fear this black-furred zombie.\u201cLesser Thousand Sword Formation, level five!\u201d Ning constantly controlled the many swords hovering around him, and given that his understanding of the intricacies of the formation was rapidly increasing, his ability to utilize it was become greater as well.\u201cGo!\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes suddenly flashed as he stared at the distant Zishan.In front of him, there formed a flickering, unstable sword light, which suddenly shot out into the distance, as fast as lightning, leaving behind only seemingly solid yet seemingly illusory arc in the skies. It stabbed directly towards the distant Bei Zishan. Zishan had long since produced a horsetail whisk-type magic treasure in his hands, and seeing the attack, he immediately brandished the horsetail whisk, which transformed into three thousand white threads that sought to entangle that piercing sword light.Both this flying boat as well this horsetail whisk were ranked magic treasures! Their power was formidable.\u201cCrackle\u2026..\u201d\u201cNot good.\u201d Zishan\u2019s face changed, and he hurriedly controlled his horsetail whisk, making it so that even as those three thousand white threads were blocking and entangling the sword light, a large number of the white threads were also emanating rays of light, with each layer of them ablating and frantically neutralizing the oncoming force, causing the sword light to have lost almost all of its power before it even reached Zishan\u2019s body.This caused the distant Ning\u2019s face to change as well. The power of the fifth level of the Lesser Thousand Swords Formation definitely wasn\u2019t weak. The fourth level could be comparable to an early Zifu Disciple using a ranked magic treasure, so the fifth level had to be comparable to a more formidable Zifu Disciple, right?\u201cYou really are a Zifu Disciple.\u201d Zishan stared at Ning, his face filled with savagery. He shouted, \u201cAt such a young age, you are such a monster. How can I possibly spare you!\u201dIn Zishan\u2019s hands, a black item suddenly appeared which looked like a wasp\u2019s nest. At the same time, it quickly grew greater, to the size of three meters tall. It was filled with countless holes, and there with countless buzzing sounds, one golden wasp after another swarmed out from those countless holes, instantly charging out. In the blink of an eye, those many wasps filled the skies, pouring towards Ning in a flood.\u201cVenomous bugs.\u201d Ning was startled, and in front of his body, an utterly unstoppable sword light formed once more. \u201cKill!\u201dSwish!A sword light pierced through the skies, directly flying towards those countless, tightly clustered swarm of golden wasps. With crackling sounds that were quite unpleasant to hear, the sword light slaughtered hundreds of the venomous bugs before having passed through to the other time. By now, more than half of the energy of the sword light had been used up, and it turned in an arc, once more stabbing into the swarm. This time, however, it used up all of its power in the swarm, with another few hundred of them having died.\u201cI can\u2019t let this continue.\u201d Ning, while using his wing-type magic treasures to dodge, immediately discarded the notion of using the Lesser Thousand Sword Formation to attack.The Lesser Thousand Sword Formation used up a truly astonishing amount of energy. Ning had only used the fifth level version of the attack twice, with a single fourth level version of this attack. However, as a result, only sixty or seventy percent of his Xiantian ki remained. There were, however, hundreds of thousands of these venomous bugs, while a single sword light of his had only killed seven or eight hundred.Even if he had an unlimited amount of Ki, most likely he would only be able to unleash three more sword lights before the venomous bugs would have arrived before him.\u201cHe\u2019s dead for sure.\u201d Bei Zishan stared at Ning.\u201cWaterflame Lotus!\u201dNing let out a low growl, and surrounding him, one fiery lotus petal after another, along with one water lotus petal after another, formed and merged, creating a lotus bud that was protecting Ning around him.\u201cThree buds of Waterflame Lotuses.\u201d Ning had used his full strength. Every single Waterflame Lotus bud was created from three lotus petals of fire and three lotus petals of water. A larger lotus bud protected the smaller lotus petals, and thus\u2026these three layers of Waterflame Lotuses surrounded Ning, who in the middle of them was constantly using his Windwing Evasion.The reason for this was that the black-furred zombie was constantly chasing, causing Ning to not dare to slack off in the slightest.\u201cBzzzzzz\u2026.\u201d The countless, tightly clustered venomous bugs spread out towards Ning, wildly boring down towards the surface of the Waterflame Lotuses, easily piercing through the first layer.The three Waterflame Lotuses that were formed into six layers were constantly swiveling, and as the many venomous bugs sought to burrow through them, one after another were killed by grinding, swiveling power of the layers of the Waterflame Lotuses. However, they quickly reformed and burrowed through the gaps between each of the layers of the Waterflame Lotuses, continuing to burrow downwards. They quickly passed through the second layer, the third layer, the fourth layer\u2026but many of the venomous bugs were dying as they did.\u201cA protective technique that contains the True Meaning of the Dao! Where did this Ji Ning learn this from?!\u201d Watching so many of his venomous bugs die from afar, Bei Zishan not only ached for his lost, he also was astonished. This was because although a supreme sword technique was precious, this sort of protective technique was even more precious. Even in his own sect, such a technique would rarely be learned.How could he have imagined\u2026that this was a technique which Ning had developed on his own.\u201cThey broke through the sixth level!\u201d Ning, wielding his Darknorth swords, was wildly blocking the venomous bugs who had broken through the sixth level. However, the carapaces of these golden wasps were tough and very hard to destroy. After blocking just a few, another wasp appeared, biting Ning\u2019s body, breaking through the protective armor, and chomping down onto the flesh.\u201cDie.\u201d Ning\u2019s Darknorth swords stabbed out wildly against the venomous bugs, while the injuries to his body were automatically healing.\u201cI can\u2019t continue like this. Although I have the body of a Fiendgod and will automatically heal, as the numbers of these venomous bugs increase\u2026I\u2019ll still be devoured alive by them in the end.\u201d Ning was frantic. \u201cThese venomous bugs are all under Bei Zishan\u2019s control. All I need to do is kill Bei Zishan.\u201dNing ignored the venomous bugs, preparing for a final, all-out assault.\u201cHe has the body of a Fiendgod.\u201d Watching from afar atop his flying boat, Zishan couldn\u2019t wait any longer as well. His face was filled with rage. \u201cHis regenerative abilities are so astonishing, and he also has that protective technique! If this continues, even if my wasps are able to devour him, the vast majority of my precious wasps will all die. Although this magic treasure of mine hasn\u2019t been completed yet, and using it will cause great harm to the dread wraiths within\u2026I can\u2019t wait any longer!\u201dBei Zishan extended his hand, and instantly, a bloody banner appeared. The banner circulated with a layer of black light \u2013 solidified sin!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen the banner appeared, the surrounding world seemed to grow dark.\u201cJi Ning, prepare to die!\u201d Bei Zishan brandished the banner in his hand.\u201cBei Zishan, prepare to die!\u201d Ning, surrounded by the many venomous bugs who had broken through his three Waterflame Lotuses and were wildly attacking him, let out a bellow as well. Around him, 486 sword-type magic treasures appeared. In this critical moment, Ning was wildly testing his own limits as well, because if the fifth level couldn\u2019t kill the enemy, then if he was going to use this technique, he had to use the sixth level!The bloody banner flapped in the air!486 sword-type magic treasures also hovered there, as a blurry sword light appeared in front of them!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4 \u2013 Bei Zishan!Ji Ning had never before used the sixth level of the Lesser Thousand Swords Formation before. Originally, back at the Aquatic Manor, using the fifth level alone had taken him to his limit. However, after he had spent time training in accordance with the [Nine Scrolls on Formations], Ning had learned how to better guide the swords in the Lesser Thousand Sword Formation through certain patterns. When he had used the fifth level, it had been fairly effortless for him, and so he now felt that although it might be difficult for him to use the sixth level, he should still be able to succeed.\u201cI have to succeed. If I fail, I die!\u201d Ning put his full power on display, and 486 sword-type magic treasures hovered around him. Ning used his divine will to carefully control the critical \u2018juncture\u2019 swords of the Lesser Thousand Sword Formation, then slowly allowed the other swords to follow those junctures, causing those 486 swords to constantly fluctuate, like the waves in a sea.Although it was difficult for Ning to control them, the 486 swords still began to glow with that blurry white light.\u201cSuccess!\u201d Although Ning still had to defend against those wasps and even be bit by them, while at the same time dodge against the attacking black-furred zombie, Ning was incomparably excited! By relying on his successes in developing formations, he had been able to manifest this sixth level of the Lesser Thousand Sword Formation.\u201cKill!\u201d Ning stared savagely at the distant Bei Zishan, standing on his flying boat.In front of his body, that incomparably sharp sword light coalesced, compressing to the utmost limit possible, and then, following Ning\u2019s will, shot out like a meteor, slicing through the air and attacking towards Bei Zishan with an utterly indomitable, unstoppable aura.\u201cDie!\u201d Standing atop the boat, Zishan also brandished the bloody banner in his hand.The banner stirred.The world around them turned dark, and one dread wraith after another, all visible to the naked eye, moaned as they flew out from the banner. These dread wraiths were the most powerful survivors of the battles between the dread wraiths. Nourished by the banner, they had become even more powerful! And this was with the treasure only being half completed; if it had been completely forged, it would be truly formidable.Despite that, however, this half-finished magic treasure was enough to allow Bei Zishan to stare down arrogantly at the vast majority of Zifu Disciples.\u201cRoaaaaar!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cDevour you!\u201dThe countless wraiths were incomparably savage, emitting ear-piercing shrieks. After having been nourished by the banner, these dread wraiths were capable of making sounds now! They all charged forward in a flood towards Ning at an impossibly fast speed. But of course, compared to Ning\u2019s Lesser Thousand Sword Formation\u2019s sword light, the Lesser Thousand Sword Formation\u2019s sword light was still a bit faster.\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d Zishan brandished the horsetail whisk in his hand, and it transformed into three thousand white strands, frantically attempting to block. However, this sword light was far more powerful than the previous one, and it chopped straight through the multiple layers. Bei Zishan frantically lifted up the handle of the bloody banner which he was holding, using it to block that sword light.But the sword light was just too fast. Zishan just barely managed to touch it in time.\u201cCrackle\u2026\u201d The sword light struck the handle of the banner, and the entire bloody banner trembled slightly. The sword light instantly grew even weaker, and then it finally slammed into the armor-type magic treasure which Bei Zishan was wearing, that black robe. It just barely managed to leave behind a black smudge on the black robe, and then it disappeared.\u201cFortunately, I blocked it. It nearly broke through my body and claimed my life.\u201d Zishan was shocked as well. A battle against a Zifu Disciple was a battle where death was always just a breath away. If one wasn\u2019t careful and was hit by an enemy\u2019s attack, one would lose one\u2019s life. \u201cHmph. With those dread wraiths gnawing at him, he won\u2019t be able to concentrate enough to launch another one of these sword lights. Those dread wraiths will gnaw him to death, no question about it.\u201dZishan was extremely confident. Even if he himself was bitten by those dread wraiths, he would die.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Ning watched as those countless, tightly clustered dread wraiths howl as they flew towards him. His face couldn\u2019t help but change. These howling dread wraiths easily bypassed his six layers of Waterflame Lotuses. Dread wraiths were ghosts, and so weapons and Waterflame Lotuses were completely unable to block them.\u201cDevour you!\u201d\u201cDevour.\u201dCountless dread wraiths surged forward, instantly completely engulfing Ning within them, wildly rushing into Ning\u2019s body.\u201cHe\u2019s dead for sure.\u201d Watching from afar, Zishan was confidently awaiting the moment when Ning would invariably collapse. However, immediately afterwards, Zishan\u2019s face began to change, because the bloody banner within his hand was beginning to tremble, and its aura was beginning to weaken as well as its power decreased. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2026what is this?\u201dZishan was shocked and angered.This banner was his trump card, his killing technique! But now, the aura of the banner was weakening nonstop, which meant that the power of the banner was dropping. The foundation of this magic treasure was those dread wraiths\u2026which meant there was only one possibility. Many dread wraiths were dying!\u201cHow is this possible? Those dread wraiths are ghosts which are filled with hatred and murder. There\u2019s no weapon at all capable of blocking them, and they are ripping and biting at the enemy\u2019s soul. These countless dread wraiths aren\u2019t able to devour his soul?\u201d Zishan didn\u2019t dare believe it. Even a Zifu Disciple\u2019s soul probably wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand these ghosts for long before being utterly devoured.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Within Ning\u2019s consciousness.Ning\u2019s soul was there, and countless dread wraiths were flooding it, letting out howls as they attempted to devour it.\u201cWhat to do?\u201d In his consciousness, Ning could sense those countless dread wraiths flooding in. He was shocked. The soul was a person\u2019s foundation; if the soul was gone, then one wouldn\u2019t even be able to reincarnate. At the same time, Ning had never had the experience of battling against ghosts.\u201cThe [Nuwa Painting].\u201d This was the first thing which Ning thought of.In his consciousness, a Ji Ning dressed in white clothes appeared, sitting in the lotus position. At the same time, behind his body, hovering in mid-air, there appeared the form of Nuwa. Maiden Nuwa seemed to have become truly timeless, with the passage of time not diminishing her in the slightest. Her eyes were filled with grief and sympathy, like the eyes of a mother. She also emanated boundless amounts of light, covering the surrounding area.When the many dread wraiths came charging over and touched the boundless light emanating from Maiden Nuwa, the evil aura emanating from their forms truly vanished. On their faces appeared smiles of peace and bliss.All of them looked towards Ji Ning with grateful gazes. Some bowed in thanks, while others knelt in thanks.And then, one after another vanished, returning to the Netherworld Kingdom to be reborn.The many dread wraiths continued to charge forwards, but the image of Maiden Nuwa dissolved their evil auras, and once they were no longer possessed by that evil, there was no way those ghosts could continue to remain here in the mortal world. All of them thus went to the Netherworld Kingdom.Actually, Ning\u2019s own soul was comparable to that of a Wanxiang Adept to begin with. Even if he didn\u2019t manifest a visualization of Maiden Nuwa, given the power of his soul, there was no way these dread wraiths would have been able to kill him\u2026after all, the magic treasure was only half complete. It was only useful against Zifu Disciples, and it wasn\u2019t strong enough to deal with Wanxiang Adepts.However, if he had done that, Ning would have been relying on the power of his soul to forcibly kill each of those dread wraiths.As Ning instead visualized Maiden Nuwa, those dread wraiths were instead all purified and sent to be reincarnated, which was a great karmic merit.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Although this took a long time to discuss, in truth, it happened in an instant.Ning had no fear at all of those countless dread wraiths charging into his body, attempting to devour his soul. Instead, he just stared at the distant Bei Zishan, and let out a bellow. \u201cKILL!\u201dSwish! Swish! Swish! Swish!A ray of sword light flashed out, followed immediately by another one\u2026four bursts of sword light shot out towards the distant Zishan. These four bursts of sword light virtually exhausted all of the Xiantian ki in Ning\u2019s body, as the amount remaining was not enough to permit him to unleash a fifth. This was Ning\u2019s full strength attack!\u201cHow is that possible? How could a youth not be afraid of his soul being devoured by dread wraiths?!\u201d Zishan, still gripping that bloody banner, was in disbelief. When he saw those rays of sword light shoot out, he was so terrified that he immediately controlled his flying boat to flee.But how could the speed of the boat match the speed of the sword light flashes?Zishan, terrified, brandished his horsetail whisk to defend while also thrusting out with his banner, but although he was just barely able to block the first attack, the second attack slashed outwards in an arc, directly piercing through the black robes that served as an armor-type magic treasure, stabbing into his body.Swish! Swish!The two other rays of sword light also instantly pierced through his head and his neck. In the corner of his forehead, a hole appeared. His neck, meanwhile, was completely cut through, and his head went flying.\u201cImpossible\u2026\u201d A look of disbelief remained on Zishan\u2019s face.The distant black-furred zombie came to a halt as well, confusion appearing in its eyes. As for those venomous wasps, many of whom had died as they had thrown themselves in their attack on Ning, they quickly retreated as well. Those three Waterflame Lotuses had crushed to death countless wasps, and without an order from their master, they naturally would prefer to flee.Only now did Ning retrieve his sword-type magic treasures, a look of disbelief appearing in his eyes. \u201cI\u2026I killed a Zifu Disciple? I succeeded?\u201dBut right at this moment\u2026From Bei Zishan\u2019s corpse, just as it was falling down from the flying boat, a golden light suddenly appeared. Given Ning\u2019s visual prowess, he could instantly tell\u2026that it was a golden bug!\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d A golden bug actually flew out from the body? Ning felt puzzled, while at the same time, he felt that something was off. He had the sense that he couldn\u2019t allow that golden bug to fly away\u2026but his Xiantian ki had been almost completely exhausted, while the Waterflame Lotus wasn\u2019t capable of being manifested at such a great distance.\u201cRumble\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the entire world seemed to transform from day into night. In the night sky, many stars twinkled and flashed, and as they did, the countless stars seemed to have transformed into a stellar sea. Within that stellar sea, there was an enormous full moon, and as the light of the moon shone down, the soft moonlight landed upon the body of that frantically fleeing golden bug.The golden bug seemed to be utterly terrified, flying at high speed and trying to flee.But suddenly, that soft moonlight solidified into a giant hand, with gently grasped that golden bug, which in its incomparable terror, let out a terrified cry. \u201cSpare me, spare me!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCrunch!\u201d With a light squeeze of the giant moonlight hand, the golden bug was crushed into dust.And then, that night sky, those millions of stars, and that moon all disappeared, with the skies once more returning to daylight.\u201cThis\u2026this is\u2026\u201d Ning stood there, his face filled with shock. \u201cA Manifestation of stars\u2026a Wanxiang Adept! A Wanxiang Adept!\u201d\u201cYou were too careless.\u201d From high up in the air, a man flew over on the wind, dressed in a blue robe and with long, unbound hair. He had a smile on his face. \u201cYou worked so hard to kill the body of that Bei Zishan, but you almost let him borrow the body of the Life Gu-Bug to flee. Bei Zishan was an expert in using bugs, so naturally he raised a Life Gu-Bug. In killing him, you should\u2019ve killed his Life Gu-Bug as well. By not doing so, you almost wasted all of your previous effort. That wouldn\u2019t have been good.\u201dNing understood that he had met a major figure today. Swallow Mountain didn\u2019t have any Wanxiang Adepts. Ning immediately bowed respectfully. \u201cJi Ning greets you, senior.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Laughing, he said, \u201cMy surname is Mu, while my name is Xiao. Others address me as Adept Mu.\u201d\u201cGreetings to you, Adept Mu.\u201d Ning felt his heart calm down. This Wanxiang Adept whom he had never met had just told Ning his name and surname. Clearly, he held an excellent opinion of Ning.\u201cThank you, Adept Mu, for intervening. Otherwise, if this Bei Zishan were to have fled, he most likely would have caused more calamities in the future.\u201d Ning immediately expressed his gratitude.Adept Mu had a smile on his face as he shook his head. \u201cActually, I should be the one thanking you. I came here for the purpose of killing this Bei Zishan, and I spent months investigating before I found him hiding here. Unfortunately, this Bei Zishan set up that large formation. Although I am a Wanxiang Adept, if I were to attempt to break the formation\u2026I didn\u2019t have confidence in my ability to do so. Thus, I have been waiting here. I was planning to wait until he left the formation before exterminating him, but I didn\u2019t expect that I would end up personally witnessing a fine performance.\u201dNing was stunned.What?So this Adept Mu had been hiding here early on, and had been watching everything occur?\u201cAfterwards, you broke open the formation.\u201d Adept Mu sighed. \u201cOnly then did I know that it was you who did it. A youth who was able to break this formation. Formidable. In addition, I didn\u2019t expect that all of those Dao-Soldiers, Xiantian lifeforms, and even Bei Zishan himself would be disposed of, all by you alone. Hahaha\u2026that made things simple for me.\u201d\u201cIf I had known that Adept Mu was present, then I wouldn\u2019t have had to exhaust myself.\u201d Ning said hurriedly.Adept Mu looked curiously at Ning. \u201cJi Ning, I wish to ask you. Are you a Zifu Disciple? Or a Xiantian lifeform?\u201dA person\u2019s strength couldn\u2019t be judged from the surface.However, Adept Mu was someone who had been watching for a very long time from outside. In particular, after Ning broke open the formation, he had watched carefully as Ning engaged in those battles. As the saying goes, the eyes of the viewers are the clearest\u2026Adept Mu discovered a number of issues which made him believe that Ning shouldn\u2019t be a Zifu Disciple.\u201cI have not yet established my \u2018Violet Palace\u2019.\u201d Ning didn\u2019t hide it.Adept Mu immediately revealed a look of surprise. \u201cIndeed! I saw that your swordplay is exquisite, and that you should have reached the level of the \u2018True Meaning of the Dao\u2019. If you were a Zifu Disciple, when you used your elemental energy to execute such exquisite swordplay\u2026you should have been able to easily defeat that black-furred zombie, and that battle should have been very simple for you. But you were actually in dire straits, which is why I guessed that you shouldn\u2019t be a Zifu Disciple. Only, if you aren\u2019t a Zifu Disciple, then you must be using \u2018divine will\u2019 to control all those sword-type magic treasures and fly with them. You, a mere Xiantian lifeform, have such a powerful soul. This truly is rare, quite rare!\u201dNing nodded.He didn\u2019t deny it, because even in the records and books he had read, he had read of some incomparably monstrous Xiantian lifeforms who were able to do what he did.\u201cMy soul was powerful at birth.\u201d Ning said. \u201cEver since I was a child, I could divide my mind. Afterwards, when I gained insights into the True Meaning of the Dao, my divine will was formed.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Facing a Wanxiang Adept, a person with the power to easily destroy him, Ning naturally didn\u2019t have to play any games. Since he was an incomparably monstrous talent, he had to show it off. That might even be of benefit to him.\u201cI want to ask you another thing.\u201d Adept Mu looked at Ning, as though he were looking at a piece of unpolished jade. \u201cAre you training in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ning nodded.\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201d Adept Mu laughed delightedly. \u201cDo you know who I am? Why I was in pursuit of Bei Zishan?\u201dNing looked at Adept Mu, then shook his head. He had never met the man; how could he know who he was?Adept Mu said directly, \u201cI am a Raindragon Guard of the Grand Xia Dynasty. I am under orders to pursue and kill Bei Zishan.\u201d\u201cRaindragon Guard?\u201d Ning was stunned.After he had killed that Diremonster, Serpentwing, his parents had given him a general explanation of the Stillwater Commandery, and how there was a powerful force within it that absolutely could not be offended; the Raindragon Guards! The Raindragon Guards was the most powerful military organization within the Grand Xia Dynasty, completely composed of Immortal practitioners, and according to legend, only those at least at the Wanxiang Adept level were able to join.The Raindragon Guards had an extremely special status. They directly served the Grand Xia Dynasty!Amongst the incomparably numerous forces and powers spread across the entire Stillwater Commandery, the two most highly ranked were the Marquis of Stillwater and the Raindragon Guards! The Marquis of Stillwater was the master of this area, and his roots here were very deep. But the Raindragon Guards were directly subordinate to the Grand Xia Dynasty. They themselves had numerous experts, and behind them they had the entire Grand Xia Dynasty as their backer.\u201cJi Ning.\u201d Adept Mu looked at Ning. \u201cThe Grand Xia Dynasty\u2019s Raindragon Guards are the most powerful force in existence in this vast land. No single tribe, no single school, no single sect\u2026can come even close to comparing with my Raindragon Guards!\u201dNing nodded, acknowledging this.\u201cThe Raindragon Guards are quite independent and under no restrictions. Once you become a Raindragon Guard, you can be blessed with a tribe, and that you can carve out a territory of ten thousand kilometers for the land of your tribe. This land will be protected by the Raindragon Guards! Even if you die, the Raindragon Guards will protect that land for a thousand years. No power will dare invade it, as if they do, that would signify a challenge to the Raindragon Guards, and we Raindragon Guards will tear out any such invading force by their very roots!\u201d Adept Mu said.Ning had heard his father say as well that the Raindragon Guards did indeed have an exalted status, and even their tribes would benefit.\u201cAdept, you\u2019ve said so many things, but I cannot become a Raindragon Guard.\u201d Ning laughed.Adept Mu just looked at Ning. \u201cI ask you this. Are you willing to become a Raindragon Guard?\u201d\u201cME!?\u201d Ning\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI\u2026I\u2019m just a Xiantian lifeform. Even if I want to, my power is far from being sufficient.\u201dBut Adept Mu just shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a major issue if your power is weak. Right now, you aren\u2019t able to directly join the Raindragon Guards, but our Raindragon Guards has an auxiliary corps as well! Much like how some schools, sects, and tribes will intentionally attract some geniuses to join them, we Raindragon Guards also have an auxiliary corps which will draw in some geniuses to join for instruction and guidance.\u201d\u201cUpon joining the auxiliary corps, you\u2019ll have access to all sorts of training techniques and even divine abilities.\u201d Adept Mu sighed. \u201cIf you consider the Raindragon Guards to be a school or a sect, then we are the most powerful one of all. We have countless Immortals practitioners, and even Celestial Immortals have appeared from within our ranks.\u201d\u201cBut of course, the threshold for joining the auxiliary corps is quite high. It isn\u2019t just anyone who can join. Fortunately, you train in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], the number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique in the world.\u201d Adept Mu looked at Ning. \u201cAnyone who relies on the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] to become a Xiantian lifeform can immediately enter the auxiliary corps. There\u2019s no need to undergo the various trials.\u201d\u201cThe [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] is simply too hard. Every single person who can use it to become a Xiantian lifeform is a monstrous talent.\u201d Adept Mu sighed emotionally. Ning, standing there, made a sound of agreement. It was true. He himself had spent that night meditating on the Dao before understanding how to fuse fire and water and to break through to become a Xiantian lifeform. Others most likely would also have to find their own secret ways to fuse fire and water as well.\u201cEvery single Immortal practitioner who trains in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] is extraordinary.\u201d Adept Mu said. \u201cFor ordinary Immortal practitioners, only those at the Wanxiang Adept level are permitted to join the Raindragon Guards.\u201d\u201cBut for [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] practitioners, as long as they reach the Zifu level and learn a divine ability, their battle power will be equivalent to a Wanxiang Adept\u2019s, and thus they would be allowed the chance to enter the Raindragon Guards. But of course, that just means you\u2019ll have the chance to; whether or not you\u2019ll actually be able to enter depends on your ability.\u201d Adept Mu said. \u201cI myself only was able to join the Raindragon Guards after becoming a late-stage Wanxiang Adept.\u201dNing, hearing this, blinked twice.Late-stage Wanxiang?The Raindragon Guards truly were difficult to join!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Right at this moment, those thousands of surviving Dao-Soldiers were all staring towards this direction in terror. From the skies, two figures descended as well; they were the human forms of the Azure Firebird and the black serpent. They, too, stared towards Ning.\u201cYou go rescue Master Blindfish and the others. I have some things to discuss with this senior.\u201d Ning immediately instructed.\u201cYes.\u201d The Azure Firebird and the black serpent responded. After having watched the grand battle between Ning and Bei Zishan, their hearts were filled with dread.Although Ning was frantically worried about his mother, he naturally couldn\u2019t slight or be discourteous to this Wanxiang Adept in front of him. Ning even had the intention of inviting him to go to West Prefecture City.\u201d\u201cAs long as you join the prepatory army, your future prospects will be limitless.\u201d Adept Mu said. \u201cIn the future, you becoming a Raindragon Guard will be a matter of course. The chances you will have there will be far greater than what you have here in the tribes, at least. Think about it carefully. If you are willing to join the auxiliary corps, then go back and bid your parents farewell. I will take you directly to Stillwater City!\u201dTo Stillwater City?Ning was stunned.\u201cAdept Mu.\u201d Ning said hurriedly. \u201cThere are so many benefits to joining the auxiliary corps. I fear there must be some sacrifices as well, right?\u201d\u201cNaturally.\u201d Adept Mu nodded. \u201cUpon joining the auxiliary corps, until you become a Zifu Disciple, you are forever forbidden from leaving the mountain.\u201d\u201cForever forbidden from leaving the mountain?\u201d Ning was puzzled.Adept Mu said, \u201cThe headquarters of we Raindragon Guards is located on the peaks of a tall mountain. The auxiliary corps is there as well! If you can\u2019t even become a Zifu Disciple, then you will simply die of age on the mountain. After becoming a Zifu Disciple, you can often leave, but you\u2019ll still need to spend most of your time on the mountain, as you\u2019ll only leave on orders. Only when you become a Raindragon Guard will you have freedom.\u201dNing nodded.He could tell that the auxiliary corps was actually comparable to a school. If one didn\u2019t become a Zifu Disciple, one wasn\u2019t permitted to leave, while even after becoming a Zifu Disciple, one would be stationed on the mountain and only be allowed to leave on orders.\u201cI have my Aquatic Manor.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cImmortal Juhua, by relying on that ancient Aquatic Manor, was able to live for millions of years, even as a Loose Immortal, and his power was comparable to a Celestial Immortal\u2026there are many secrets contained within the Aquatic Manor which I must investigate. Once I become a Zifu Disciple, I\u2019ll be able to bind the control talisman. Why should I be in a hurry to join the auxiliary corps?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAdept Mu, standing there, spoke again. \u201cNing, who in the Swallow Mountains can possibly provide you tutelage? For someone as naturally gifted as you, you must expand your horizons.\u201d\u201cThank you, Adept.\u201d Ning pondered for a time, then shook his head. \u201cAdept, I imagine that you heard as well that my mother is gravely ill. For now, I don\u2019t wish to go.\u201dAdept Mu, hearing this, nodded. \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I won\u2019t press you. This is the talisman of the Raindragon Guards. In the future, if you encounter any danger on the road to Stillwater City, if you show off this talisman, perhaps it might be of use.\u201d As he spoke, he turned over his hand, and a square black talisman appeared in his palm, with the image of a Rain Dragon on it.\u201cThank you, Adept.\u201d Ning immediately accepted it. \u201cJi Ning has one thing to request of you, Adept.\u201dAdept Mu immediately laughed. \u201cYou assisted me in exterminating Bei Zishan of Snowdragon Mountain. I had wanted to help send you to Stillwater City to enter the auxiliary corps of the Raindragon Guard, but I didn\u2019t expect you wouldn\u2019t want to go\u2026I was worrying about how to repay your assistance. Go ahead and tell me. If I can help you, I will.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This Bei Zishan had been a Zifu Disciple of Snowdragon Mountain?Ji Ning temporarily suppressed this line of thought, then immediately said with sincerity, \u201cMy mother is gravely ill. I expect that my Ji clan is unable to save her. I would like to ask you, Adept Mu, to go on a trip to visit my Ji clan of the West Prefecture and save my mother\u2019s life.\u201dAdept Mu saw the look on Ning\u2019s face, and he couldn\u2019t help but sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not talented in medical treatments, but I can go take a look. If I can save her, naturally I will. But if I cannot\u2026\u201d\u201cAdept, if you are willing to go, Ji Ning will be forever grateful.\u201d Ning said hurriedly.\u201cScum, get over here!\u201d Adept Mu suddenly turned and stared into the distance, barking loudly. From afar, that black-furred zombie whose entire body was swirling with that necromantic aura walked over obediently, staring at Adept Mu with a hint of dread in its oily green eyes.Adept Mu waved his hand, and a violet coffin appeared in front of him.\u201cGet in.\u201dAdept Mu gave the order.The black-furred zombie obediently opened the coffin, then leapt in and lay down, then closed the lid behind it.\u201cThis is a corpse-preserving coffin.\u201d Adept Mu, with a wave of his hand, took back the corpse-preserving coffin while explaining to Ning, \u201cThis black-furred zombie had just lost its master. If it were to be permitted to roam about, it would definitely harm many people. Thus, when I was speaking with you, I used a thread of my ki bind it to myself.\u201dNing nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You were the one to kill Bei Zishan, and so I won\u2019t touch any of the things he left behind.\u201d Adept Mu said. \u201cOnly, at your current level of power, you are not able to tame this black-furred zombie, and so I am taking it with me.\u201dAs he spoke, Adept Mu looked at the distant corpse of Bei Zishan. Zishan\u2019s corpse immediately flew over, along with his various magic treasures, including the flying boat, his horsetail whisk, the bloody banner, and the nest which held the hornets. Adept Mu reached out with his hand, and a ring which had been on Zishan\u2019s fingers flew off, entering Adept Mu\u2019s hand.\u201cThis is a ranked storage-type magic treasure.\u201d Adept Mu said. \u201cYou are unable to bind it, so I will help you in retrieving the items within.\u201dWhoosh\u2026.Soon, Adept Mu completed his binding of the ring, and as he did, a large number of miscellaneous items appeared out of nowhere onto the ground, amongst which were Dao Battle-Armor suits, foodstuffs, some golden items, as well as some alchemical ingredients as well as various bottles.\u201cJudging from the look of your skin, you should have suffered a poisoning by the Hearteater Powder.\u201d Adept Mu flipped his hand, and one of the little bottles on the ground flew up, with the words \u2018Hearteater Antidote\u2019 written atop it. Clearly, with so many bottles present, Zishan himself was worried that he would use a wrong bottle, and so had labeled all of them.Adept Mu opened the bottle\u2019s plug, glanced at it, then nodded. \u201cThis is the antitode. Eat a pill. You can collect these various items and ranked magic treasures as well\u2026although you are currently unable to bind them, when you become a Zifu Disciple, you will be. Don\u2019t have any worries; although these things are treasures to you; they aren\u2019t worth anything to me at all.\u201d\u201cThank you, Adept.\u201d Ning was very grateful.Although he knew that these things weren\u2019t worth much to the Adept, the actions of this Adept Mu were clean and decisive. How could Ning not feel grateful for how well the man was treating him, a mere Xiantian lifeform?\u201cOne day, I absolutely must repay this kindness.\u201d Ning said to himself.Ning swallowed the pill, which gave off a clear, fragrant taste, almost like a pellet of sugar. As soon as the pellet entered his stomach, it immediately dissolved. Soon, he felt a warm sensation throughout his entire body, and every single bit of Hearteater poison that was spread throughout his body suddenly dissolved like the snow, quickly and completely disappearing. The pain which had been spreading throughout his body vanished as well, and those red spots on his face faded.\u201cThis hornet\u2019s nest\u2026\u201d Adept Mu pointed at the hornet\u2019s nest, which had many venomous hornets within. \u201cThe hornet\u2019s nest is an unranked magic treasure. You can bind it. However, as for the many hornets within the nest\u2026to control them mentally, you\u2019ll have to become a Zifu Disciple, and then slowly bind them with your Ki. Prior to becoming a Zifu Disciple, remember to often bring them food to eat. Don\u2019t starve them to death. If they are starved, they will start to kill each other and devour each other.\u201dNing nodded immediately. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cHurry up and bind the hornet\u2019s nest. Oh. Here\u2019s a manual on binding hornets. This is a secret manual of Snowdragon Mountain. It isn\u2019t that precious, but it does contain the basics for binding hornets and pests.\u201d Adept Mu immediately saw a fur-clad book amongst Bei Zishan\u2019s possessions. \u201cBinding hornets is fairly simple. Only, finding them is very hard, and so too is raising them. There\u2019s no need for you to be in a rush to learn. These things can wait for you to become a Zifu Disciple before learning.\u201dNing accepted the manual, which had three characters atop it: [Insect Binding Manual].\u201cBecause this hornet\u2019s nest has venomous insects, there\u2019s no way you can store it within a storage-type magic treasure.\u201d Adept Mu handed the nest to Ning. \u201cHowever, the hornet\u2019s nest can change in size. You can shrink it, then carry it on you.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ning acknowledged. He immediately accepted the enormous black hornet\u2019s nest. Prior to handing it over, Adept Mu had already erased the remaining magic power that the hornet\u2019s nest had contained, and so Ning was able to easily bind it. Otherwise, Ning would have had to spend an enormous amount of time just wiping out the remnant magic power left behind by Bei Zishan.\u201cSmaller, smaller, smaller.\u201d Ning looked at the black hornet\u2019s nest rapidly shrink, until it was the size of a finger. With a flip of his hand, he picked up a cloth sack, then placed the hornet\u2019s nest within it. He placed the sack within his clothes, and the armor-type magic treasure he was wearing shifted in configuration slightly, accommodating the sack within.\u201cCollect them all.\u201dNing waved his hand, and collected the many miscellaneous items on the ground, as well as manuals and poisons which Bei Zishan had left behind.As for Bei Zishan\u2019s ranked magic treasures, Ning didn\u2019t touch them.\u201cThese ranked magic treasures.\u201d Adept Mu pointed at the bloody banner as he spoke. \u201cI am going to take away this Myriad Wraiths Banner. This is a magic treasure which was birthed from sins. I need to take it back\u2026and it is also proof that I\u2019ve accomplished my mission. You can keep the rest.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Only now did Ning collect the other ranked magic treasures.He was unable to use any of them, and so all he could do was to collect them for now.\u201cThe Myriad Wraiths Banner\u2026\u201d Adept Mu picked up the bloody banner, which glowed with a faintly visible black aura. \u201cWho knows how many people were tortured to death to create it? What a terrible, weighty sin! This Bei Zishan really was fated to die; he actually used this Myriad Wraiths Banner against you, but your soul is already at the \u2018divine will\u2019 level. How could this incomplete Myriad Wraiths Banner possibly do anything to you?\u201dAdept Mu was under the impression that Ning had relied on his powerful so to destroy all of those dread wraiths. He didn\u2019t know that Ning had, in reality, had relied upon a visualization of Maiden Nuwa in order to pacify all of those dread wraiths.\u201cLook. This is sin. Sin so heavy, one can see it with the naked eye. And yet, boundless karmic merits are very hard to see.\u201d Adept Mu pointed at the black aura surrounding the bloody banner. \u201cSin which one can already see with the naked eye\u2026you can imagine how grave and serious the sin is. We Raindragon Guards naturally must exterminate a person who has committed such grave sins.\u201dNing looked and nodded.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Within the mountain cave, Blindfish and the others had their bodies and clothes covered with blood.\u201cQuick, lift them up.\u201d\u201cHurry.\u201dThe black serpent and the Azure Firebird were shouting at those servants. How could the servants dare to resist? They obediently lifted, carried, and piggybacked those who were unable to walk on their own.\u201cThe young master?\u201d\u201cWhere is young master Ji Ning?\u201d Blindfish and Ji Jadewich asked, along with others.The black serpent just said, \u201cThe young master is outside.\u201dBlindfish was still able to walk on his own, but Jadewich had to be lifted. All of them walked out of the cave, and as they did, they saw those thousands of terrified Dao-Soldiers, as well as the corpses which litered the ground, as well as Ji Ning, off in the distance, who was currently chatting with Adept Mu.Ning turned to look. When he saw his master Blindfish, his entire body covered with blood, as well as Jadewich and the others be carried over, he couldn\u2019t help but feel his heart ache. He couldn\u2019t help but call out, \u201cMaster Blindfish.\u201d\u201cYoung master.\u201d Blindfish spoke as well.\u201cYou\u2026you all\u2026\u201d Ning didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cThank you, young master.\u201d\u201cThank you, young master Ji Ning.\u201d Not just the people of the Ji clan; even those Xiantian lifeforms of the Riverbank clan, the Ironwood clan, the Kou clan, and the various other clans, all of whom had their dantians shattered, spoke out in gratitude. The destruction of their dantians made them cripples, but they already felt boundless gratitude for being able to see the sun again and for being able to return to live amongst their clans.In his heart, Ning felt boundless sourness. These people included the enemies of the Ji clan, true, but in the past, they were glorious, respected Xiantian lifeforms. But now, all of their dantians had been destroyed.The hint of excitement he had felt prior to this when he had acquired all of those treasures of Bei Zishan completely vanished. Ning turned to look towards those servants and barked, \u201cHow many more people are imprisoned within this mountain?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s most likely more than a million people imprisoned here, but it\u2019s hard to say if even half remain alive.\u201d Immediately, some servants spoke out nervously.Ning, hearing this, was stunned.A million?\u201cWhat a sin!\u201d Adept Mu shook his head and sighed. \u201cJi Ning\u2026these thousands of Dao-Soldiers as well as hundreds of thousands of surviving commoners\u2026let those two spirit-beasts deal with them. The two of you, remember that those thousands of Dao-Soldiers were innocent. They were forced to do what they did by Bei Zishan. Do not further violate the proscriptions against murder.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The black serpent and the Azure Firebird hurriedly nodded. They had previously seen the power of those Flood Dragon Dao-Soldiers. Although they could spare the lives of those Dao-Soldiers, they absolutely would take away those Dao Battle-Armors.\u201cI\u2019ll handle everything here to you two.\u201d Ning instructed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d The black serpent and the Azure Firebird responded.\u201cJi Ning, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go to your Ji clan\u2019s West Prefecture City.\u201d Adept Mu said. \u201cI can bring these people along as well.\u201dAs he spoke, he waved his hand, and a leaf appeared out of nowhere. The leaf rapidly expanded in size, and soon became an enormous leaf that was dozens of meters long. Ning, seeing this, immediately had Master Blindfish, Jadewich, and the other members of the Ji clan all stand atop the leaf. As for the Kou clan, the Riverbank clan, and the other clans, they temporarily rested here, awaiting their clan\u2019s forces to come pick them up.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAdept Mu, Ning, Blindfish, and the other Xiantian lifeforms of the Ji clan who had their dantians destroyed had all mounted the leaf. The enormous green leaf, dozens of meters long, flew rapidly into the air, quickly flying beyond the peaks of the mountains and disappearing into the skies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7 \u2013 Seeing MotherThe single green leaf had Ji Ning as well as more than twenty others on it. It flew through the clouds, hurrying towards the direction of West Prefecture City.Everyone was either seated or lying down, while Ning and Adept Mu Xiao were standing.\u201cAdept, prior to this, you said that Bei Zishan was from Snowdragon Mountain?\u201d Ning asked the question he had been contemplating.\u201cRight. Snowdragon Mountain.\u201d Adept Mu glanced at Ning and nodded. \u201cSnowdragon Mountain can be considered one of the most powerful forces of the entire Stillwater Commandery, and within the school, there are multiple Primal Daoists who stand guard. Their roots are quite deep.\u201dNing was secretly shocked.Multiple Primal Daoists?\u201cPrecisely because the school is so large and it has so many methods of training, it also possessed some evil techniques, and so naturally, it will also have some Immortal practitioners who have embarked upon an evil path.\u201d Adept Mu said. \u201cSnowdragon Mountain cares more about power, and thus within it, it possesses Demon practitioners, Evil practitioners, Immortal practitioners, Buddhist practitioners, and all sorts of other practitioners. It values power the most.\u201dAdept Mu sighed, \u201cPrecisely because within it, the \u2018fish and dragons are mixed together\u2019, many people are attracted to Snowdragon Mountain, causing its power to grow even more enormous. Some Zifu Disciples who have departed from it will establish their own territory elsewhere, under the banner of Snowdragon Mountain. They can be considered branches, I suppose. These branches will often collect some talented youths and send them to the main school. Thus, Snowdragon Mountain continues to grow more and more powerful.\u201d\u201cBut of course, compared to our Raindragon Guards\u2026Snowdragon Mountain is incomparably inferior.\u201d Adept Mu laughed. \u201cAny one of the Loose Immortals which we Raindragon Guards have stationed here in the Stillwater Commadery is capable of eradicating the entire Snowdragon Mountain school.\u201dNing nodded.This was no joke.Snowdragon Mountain was nothing more than a school, while the Raindragon Guards was the most powerful military force the Grand Xia Dynasty possessed, overawing the entire world. Of course they weren\u2019t on the same level.\u201cLook. We\u2019re here.\u201d Adept Mu pointed into the distance. \u201cWest Prefecture City is up ahead.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re here?\u201d Ning was stunned. He saw that in the distance, there was a forest which surrounded a magnificent city. This was indeed West Prefecture City, where he had lived since he was young. Ning couldn\u2019t help but feel stunned. \u201cThe speed at which Wanxiang Adepts travel on their magic treasures truly is astonishing! A distance of thousands of kilometers was travelled in the blink of an eye.\u201dAnd then, Ning began to worry. \u201cI wonder how Mother is doing. Mother has always been well. Why is she suddenly gravely ill?\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Within West Prefecture City.Yuchi Snow was resting in her room, while outside of the room, her husband, Ji Yichuan, was currently speaking with Ji Ninefire.\u201cThis is all caused by that calamity from the past.\u201d Yichuan shook his head.Ninefire sat there, nodding slightly. \u201cThat disaster changed the destiny of the two of you, husband and wife. Yichuan, you were the most talented genius our Ji clan had produced in a thousand years. When you were a child and your father died, you suddenly began to soar\u2026you had already established your \u2018Violet Palace\u2019 and embarked onto the path of Immortals as a Zifu Disciple. Unfortunately, it was all ruined.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if my future potential on the path of Immortals is gone.\u201d Yichuan shook his head and sighed. \u201cDuring that disaster, the elder brother of my wife, the most powerful of us three, lost his life for the sake of protecting myself and Snow. Snow had already been badly injured, but for the sake of birthing Ning, she utilized a secret technique that used up her own lifeforce\u2026although my future potential on the Immortal path has been destroyed, I got off the easiest, out of the three of us.\u201dNinefire shook his head gently, sighing.Fate makes fools of men!Adventuring in the vast, boundless world outside was indeed far more dangerous than living here in Swallow Mountain. Experts were as common as the clouds. There would be lucky encounters, but there would also be disastrous ones. For example, when the Yuchi siblings and Yichuan had met with that crisis, the result had been this.\u201cHm?\u201d Ninefire suddenly lifted his head.From high up in the air, a green leaf was slashing through the skies until it landed within a courtyard. Atop this leaf were Adept Mu, Ning, Blindfish, Jadewich, and many others.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Yichuan stared in astonishment at the people in front of him, then immediately dashed over. \u201cJadewich, Shan, Blindfish\u2026you all came back? What happened to all of you? How is it that all of you are injured? What have you all been doing these past days? Why did you all suddenly go missing?\u201d\u201cGreetings, Patriarch.\u201d The twenty-plus Xiantian lifeforms of the Ji clan quickly recognized their Patriarch, and in unison, they immediately called out.Ninefire naturally knew that more than twenty Xiantian lifeforms of his clan had gone missing, and he had been utterly frustrated by this affair. Now, seeing these Xiantian lifeforms all reappear, he was both surprised and delighted. He hurriedly said, \u201cWhen we realized you had gone missing, our entire Ji clan started to serach for you. Are you all well?\u201d\u201cOur dantians have been destroyed, but we are very lucky to still be alive.\u201d Jadewich said hoarsely.\u201cDantians destroyed?\u201d Ninefire stared, wide-eyed.A nearby youth with long hair called out as well, \u201cPatriarch, it was only thanks to Ji Ning as well as this Adept that we were able to survive this time.\u201d\u201cAdept?\u201d Ninefire and Yichuan felt a surge of electricity in their hearts.Adept\u2026Then that meant this was a Wanxiang Adept! The entire Swallow Mountain area didn\u2019t have a single Wanxiang Adept.The two both looked at Adept Mu. Actually, when they first saw him, they had the feeling that this was an extraordinary figure. To be able to ride on a magic treasure to come here\u2026they guessed that he was at least a Zifu Disciple, but they didn\u2019t expect that he was actually a Wanxiang Adept. They saw how Ning was standing to the side of this Wanxiang Adept, as though they seemed to be on good terms. In their hearts, they couldn\u2019t help but feel puzzled as to how Ning had managed to end up getting to know this Wanxiang Adept.\u201cJi Ninefire (Ji Yichuan) greets you, Adept.\u201d Ninefire and Yichuan both said respectfully.\u201cActually, I\u2019m the one who should be thanking Ji Ning.\u201d Adept Mu laughed calmly.\u201cJi Ning?\u201d Ninefire and Yichuan looked towards Ning.A look of worry appeared on Ning\u2019s face, and he immediately said, \u201cI learned that Mother is gravely ill, so I invited Adept Mu to come to our West Prefecture City\u2026\u201d\u201cSnow is right inside the room.\u201d Yichuan suddenly realized, and he immediately spoke out.Adept Mu Xiao nodded, then walked towards the nearby room. Ning and Yichuan followed behind, while Ning asked softly while walking, \u201cFather, what happened? How could Mother suddenly have fallen ill?\u201d\u201cIt was that illness left behind in the past.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cI\u2019ll explain to you in detail later.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013After entering the room, they had the maidservants leave. Aside from Snow, who was lying on the bed, only Adept Mu, Ning, Yichuan, and Ninefire were present.Yuchi Snow opened her eyes, looking at the newcomers. She couldn\u2019t help but reveal a trace of puzzlement in her eyes.\u201cSnow, this is Adept Mu, whom Ning asked to come.\u201d Yichuan said hurriedly.Hearing this, Snow immediately used her arms to prop herself up. \u201cYuchi Snow greets you, Adept.\u201d\u201cGive me your right hand.\u201d Adept Mu sat down on the stone bench next to the bed.Snow extended her rather ashen right hand. She saw, now, that standing by the side of Adept Mu was Ning. She looked at her son\u2026and as she did, a look of delight appeared on Snow\u2019s face.Adept Mu stretched out with a single finger, gently tapping it on Snow\u2019s wrist. Immediately, a spot of green light, filled with life energy, spread out, quickly enveloping Snow\u2019s entire body. Ning and Yichuan, seated nearby and watching, felt restlessness in their hearts. After waiting for a good long while, Adept Mu began to frown. \u201cStrange. Strange.\u201dNing, hearing this, felt nervousness in his heart. He hurriedly asked, \u201cAdept, my Mother, she\u2026?\u201dStill frowning, Adept Mu said, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not specialized in medicine, I can tell that your Mother doesn\u2019t have any sickness. Rather, her lifeforce has been almost entirely used up\u2026given how little lifeforce your mother has left in her body, she\u2019ll most likely be able to live just three more months.\u201d\u201cHer lifeforce has nearly been used up?\u201d Ning\u2019s face changed.\u201cWhen my wife was pregnant, she was injured.\u201d The nearby Yichuan said hurriedly. \u201cAfterwards, she then used a secret technique which spent her own vitality to protect the fetus.\u201dAdept Mu nodded. \u201cYour wife was originally a Xiantian lifeform, and judging from the purity of the remnants of ki in her body, she should have been a peak Xiantian lifeform. Unfortunately\u2026that injury she suffered should have been a severe one. Her dantian was destroyed, and logically speaking, she shouldn\u2019t have been able to preserve the fetus. Your wife used a secret technique to ignite her own lifeforce in order to protect the fetus, but the cost of this secret technique was extremely great. To replenish what the usage of it cost is almost impossible.\u201dHearing this, Ning was flabbergasted.His mother had been a peak Xiantian expert? Her dantian had been destroyed, and she had used a secret technique to ignite her own lifeforce to protect the fetus?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, from what he had seen from when his mother had taught him footwork, she was indeed an expert. However, that year when he had been in his mother\u2019s womb, what exactly had happened? His parents had always intentionally hidden the truth of what had happened when his mother was pregnant from Ning, refusing to tell him.\u201cAdept, please save my mother.\u201d Ning said frantically.\u201cTo save her, the only method is to extend her lifespan.\u201d Adept Mu sighed. \u201cThere are plenty of spirit pills for curing diseases, and I myself have spirit pills that can be used for Immortal practitioners to extend their lifespan. But unfortunately\u2026to let a mortal have an extended lifespan is thousands of times more difficult than to have an Immortal practitioner extend their lifespans. This sort of medicine is something which I, in the Raindragon Guards, have only heard of. I don\u2019t even know where to find them. Most likely, only Immortals would be able to produce them.\u201dThe nearby Ninefire, hearing this, was shocked. Raindragon Guards?\u201cImmortals!\u201d Hearing this, Ning felt as though his heart had suddenly turned to ice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Before leaving, he pulled Ji Ning aside to give him advice in private. \u201cJi Ning, your talent is extremely high. It is guaranteed that you will walk far on the path of Immortals! Immortal practitioners have very long lifespans. Unless his friends and family are also Immortal practitioners, you will have to watch as all of them die of old age. Actually, this is a form of self-improvement with regards to your mind towards the Dao. Since you have become an Immortal practitioner\u2026you need to be prepared. No matter how much pain you suffer, you must escape from the midst of your grief. Otherwise, it will be very hard for you to overcome the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.After Adept Mu left, Ji Ninefire also immediatedly headed towards the mountain where Bei Zishan had hidden himself. That place, after all, had Flood Dragon Dao Battle-Armor.Ning travelled by himself to Serpentwing Lake.\u201cThere\u2019s still hope. My mother still has hope for surviving.\u201d Ning ran through the mountainous, forested wilderness, occasionally using his Windwing Evasion to advance. His running speed was far faster than the travelling speed of those black beasts, and after expending a large majority of his divine power, he managed to arrive at Serpentwing Lake in just two hours.\u201cThat ancient Aquatic Manor has had multiple masters. Immortal Juhua was the third master. Ignoring the other masters, Immortal Juhua himself had lived for millions of years as a Loose Immortal. He definitely had quite a few medicines, and perhaps some of them are able to allow mortals to have extended lifespans.\u201d Ning ran across the surface of the water to the island.\u201cYoung master.\u201d\u201cGreetings, young master.\u201dThere were quite a few people on the island, who had arrived long ago to build a residence there. Autumn Leaf and that young child, Bluestone, were there as well. Seeing Ning run in their direction across the surface of the water, they immediately went to welcome him.\u201cI have something to do. You can retire for now.\u201d Ning instructed, then immediately transformed into a blur, disappearing from their field of vision. This caused Autumn Leaf and the other servants to feel rather puzzled.Ning soon arrived at the entrance to the cave. He continuously went deeper in, and after a few moments, he arrived at the place where he had been teleported away from last time.\u201cSenior.\u201dNing called out frantically. \u201cQuick, let me enter the estate. I have something important to do.\u201dThe dark tunnel caverns were completely silent. There was no response at all. This caused Ning to be all the more frantic. The old black bull had originally said\u2026that Ning should only return after he had bound the control talisman. But currently, he was just an early Xiantian lifeform. How long would it be before he would become a Zifu Disciple? His mother only had three months left. He had no other options, besides coming here and begging!\u201cSenior, I truly have an urgent matter involving life-and-death. I sincerely implore you, Senior, to let me in.\u201d Ning begged frantically.Silence.Rumble\u2026Suddenly, the surrounding space twisted, and in the cavernous area in front of him, an enormous bear\u2019s head once more appeared. The bear\u2019s head opened its giant mouth, swallowing Ning within it, and Ning disappeared from within the estate.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Spacetime twisted\u2026and then all was calm.Ning stared in front of him. In front of him was that majestic, ancient palace hall, in the center of which were those incomparably enormous prayer mats. An old black bull ambled over and let out a sigh. \u201cJi Ning, didn\u2019t I tell you to wait until you bound the control talisman, at which point you would be able to naturally sense the Aquatic Manor and come as you pleased? You are just a Xiantian lifeform. Why have you entered again?\u201d\u201cSenior.\u201d Ning said hurriedly. \u201cMy mother is gravely ill. I truly have no other methods, so I came here to beg.\u201d\u201cYour mother is gravely ill?\u201d The old black bull shook his head. \u201cSince you have chosen the path of Immortals, you need to be prepared for these things.\u201dNing hurriedly shook his head. \u201cSenior, my mother is still young. She shouldn\u2019t die so soon! Previously, I asked a Wanxiang Adept to help take a look at my mother\u2026and that Wanxiang Adept said that my mother, in the past, had used a secret technique to expend her own lifeforce to rescue me. By now, her lifeforce is almost completely used up, and she only has three months of life left. To save my mother, a medicinal pill that can allow mortals to extend their lifespans is necessary. However, that Wanxiang Adept himself had only heard of such pills, and said that most likely only Immortals were in possession of them. I have no other choices, and so I came to the Aquatic Manor.\u201d\u201cA medicinal pill that can allow mortals to extend their lifespans?\u201d The old black bull sighed. \u201cThat is something that can described as an Immortal pill. Generally speaking, only Loose Immortals or Earthly Immortals can produce such a thing.\u201d\u201cImmortal Juhua was no ordinary Loose Imortal. He definitely has this sort of medicinal pill, right?\u201d Ning asked frantically.The old black bull looked at Ning, then shook its head. \u201cImmortal Juhua had been alive for millions of years. His family and friends had died long ago. He had no need of such pills, and so he didn\u2019t have any of them.\u201dNing\u2019s heart trembled.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Ning said hurriedly. \u201cI imagine Immortal Juhua must have left behind quite a few magic treasures. Give me a magic treasure which has a valuable comparable to that of an Immortal pill, and I\u2019ll take it and trade\u2026\u201dAs soon as he said the words, Ning knew that he was making a mistake.He cared too much about his mother\u2019s life, and so he had lost his bearings and equanimity. Even his words lacked proprietry.\u201cFoolishness!\u201d The old black bull shouted. \u201cYou yourself said just now that even a Wanxiang Adept has only heard of this sort of Immortal pill. You want to trade for it? With who? You, a Xiantian lifeform, hold a magic treasure on that level? If you show it off, most likely those powerful Immortal practitioners will just kill you for it. Trade for it? If you don\u2019t have enough power, how will you trade?\u201d\u201cIn addition! You haven\u2019t even bound the control talisman, and the only place in the Aquatic Manor you can enter is just the main palace. You aren\u2019t even able to enter the other places. On what basis am I supposed to hand over one of the magic treasures Immortal Juhua left behind?\u201d The old black bull shook his head. \u201cAnd what\u2019s more, this isn\u2019t even my decision to make.\u201d\u201cNot your decision to make?\u201d Ning was stunned. \u201cThen\u2026\u201dThe old black bull sighed. \u201cI\u2019m just the spirit of a magic treasure Immortal Juhua always kept on him! The true controller of this Aquatic Manor is the Spirit of the Aquatic Manor!\u201d\u201cSpirit of the Aquatic Manor?\u201d Ning was puzzled.The old black bull explained, \u201cThe entire Aquatic Manor was forged by the first master, who was incredibly mysterious. Even Immortal Juhua himself felt that this Aquatic Manor has secrets which even he had been unable to discover. The Spirit of the Aquatic Manor\u2026has been carrying out the laws and rules set forth by the first master. It won\u2019t violate the rules in the slightest.\u201d\u201cTeleport someone outside into this place? The Spirit of the Aquatic Manor can do that. But allow you to go to other places within the manor? Without binding the Aquatic Manor, that definitely will not be permitted.\u201d The old black bull said. \u201cIt also cannot possibly give you one of Immortal Juhua\u2019s magic treasures. After all, it is the Spirit of the Aquatic Manor. It will definitely obey the orders of the first master of the manor.\u201dNing was stunned.\u201cWhen, for example, the fourth master died in the outside world, the Spirit of the Aquatic Manor would at most act to find the next master.\u201d The old black bull shook his head. \u201cWe spirits of magic treasures are different from you humans. You can change. But we will definitely respect the will of our master.\u201dNing understood. Magic treasures were covered with all sorts of runes and bindings. For example, some golems which were forged\u2026even long after the death of their master, the golems would still obey their original orders. The same was true for dwelling-type magic treasures. After the owner of a dwelling died, the rules the owner had set down would still be obeyed by the spirit of the dwelling.When he understood this, Ning felt despair, deep within his heart.The old black bull looked towards Ning. \u201cOn the path of Immortals, you will see your family and friends die of age, one after the other. You will also see some friends die in battle\u2026you will have to learn how to accept these things! Go, now!\u201dWhoosh!An enormous illusory bear\u2019s head appeared, engulfing Ning within its mouth.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Ning returned to West Prefecture city. Returned to the side of his mother. By now, it was already late at night.\u201cNing.\u201d Yuchi Snow, lying on the bed, saw her son. Her eyes immediately lit up. \u201cWhere did you go? I couldn\u2019t find you.\u201d\u201cMother.\u201d Ning hurriedly walked forward, half-kneeling by her side. He held his mother\u2019s hand. \u201cI went out for a trip. However, I won\u2019t make any more trips. I\u2019ll accompany you and stay by your side.\u201dSnow gently stroked her son\u2019s hair. She laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. If you are busy, do what you need to do. Just remember to come visit your mother.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Ning nodded gently, and as he did, he couldn\u2019t help but shed tears.The only thing he could do now was accompany her mother for the final three months. This was the only filial act he could now do.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Night.His mother had already fallen asleep. Ji Yichuan and Ji Ning, father and son, were within a hall.\u201cFather.\u201d Ning looked towards his father. \u201cIt is time to tell me, I think, what exactly happened in the past.\u201dYichuan looked at his son, and as he did, he thought of what Blindfish and the others had said regarding what Ning had done in the mountain. He understood that his son had grown up. Sighing, he said, That year, your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I thus decided to return to the Ji clan. At that time, your maternal uncle was worried, so he escorted and protected us on the way back.\u201d\u201cMaternal uncle?\u201d Ning had never before heard that he had an uncle.\u201cYour uncle\u2019s name was Yuchi Mount.\u201d Yichuan\u2019s eyes had a hint of memory within them. \u201cYour uncle was exceedingly intelligent, and he also knew how to treat others. He had many friends. He had also become a Zifu Disciple early on. If it weren\u2019t because he wanted to escort myself and your mother back, your uncle probably would\u2019ve had a chance at restoring and reestablishing the Yuchi clan. Unfortunately, your uncle died. He died for the sake of protecting the three of us. All three of our lives, we have because your uncle gave up his own! This great debt\u2026is hard to repay!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing, hearing this, felt a heavy feeling.An uncle! Yuchi Mount!He had never heard of this name. This moment was deeply engraved into Ning\u2019s heart.\u201cI\u2019ve only heard that your uncle had a daughter, your maternal cousin. Unfortunately, I have no idea where your cousin is.\u201d Yichuan shook his head and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m unable to repay him. Unable to repay him\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat exactly happened? Who harmed and killed my uncle, and also caused the roots of her illness?\u201d Ning immediately asked. \u201cWho was it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After hesitating, he said, \u201cAll I can tell you is that he is a disciple of Snowdragon Mountain, and that his grandfather is a Summit Master of one of their mountain summits, an individual on the Primal Daoist level.\u201dNing\u2019s face changed.Primal Daoist?\u201cHe himself is just a Zifu Disciple and not worthy of being afraid of.\u201d Yichuan shook his head. \u201cBut behind him stands a Primal Daoist\u2026we truly cannot irriate him! If we struggle against him, the only result will be the extermination of the entire Ji clan. This is why your mother and I have never mentioned this, nor said a single word regarding this in front of you. Ever since that, after your mother and I stealthily returned to the Ji clan, we have always remained very low-key. However, most likely that person didn\u2019t hold your mother and I in any regard at all.Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cYou are now an adult, and you are very talented. According to what that Adept Mu said, it is possible that you might one day join the Raindragon Guards. This is why I have told you these things. Otherwise\u2026I had planned to never tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat is he called?\u201d Ning pursued this line of questioning.\u201cOnce you become a Wanxiang Adept, I will tell you.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cIf I were to die, your Uncle White will tell you. That year, your Uncle White risked his life to carry your mother and flee. He saved your life, and he knew exactly what happened that year.\u201dNing said frantically, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me now?\u201d\u201cWhat good would it be if I did tell you?\u201d Yichuan barked. \u201cWill you go seek revenge? That\u2019s just looking for death! First be patient and endure. After enduring for a few years, you\u2019ll have calmed down as well.\u201d\u201cRemember\u201d!Yichuan stared at Ning. \u201cDon\u2019t let hatred cloud your eyes. In this vast, endless world, slaughter and hatred is omnipresent. It is guaranteed that you will one day leave Swallow Mountain. In the vast world outside, those major schools, clans, and powerful sects are all hard to deal with.

Dry leaves fell.Yuchi Snow was seated on a long bench in front of her room. The beast fur pelt laid on the bench was warm and soft. There was a layer of beast fur on Snow\u2019s body as well. Her face was even more ashen now. She held her son\u2019s hand, then turned to say towards Yichuan, who was standing next to her, \u201cYichuan, bring those beast furs over.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Yichuan immediately entered the room, quickly returning while carrying a pile of beast fur clothes.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d Ning looked at the beast fur clothes.Yichuan said, \u201cYour mother hasn\u2019t had anything to do in recent days, and so she\u2019s been sewing these beast fur clothes. Every single thread and stitch is the labor of your mother\u2019s hands.\u201d Seated there, Snow said softly, \u201cThere\u2019s quite a few by now. I only made twelve sets of clothes in the past three months. They are all suitable for your current size and stature. In the future, Mother won\u2019t be able to be by your side, but these clothes will accompany you.\u201dNing\u2019s eyes stung, and he couldn\u2019t refrain from tearing up.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d Snow gently stroked her son\u2019s face. \u201cI know that soon now, I won\u2019t be able to last any longer.\u201d\u201cMother!\u201d Ning\u2019s voice was trembling.\u201cMother has experienced many things in this life.\u201d Snow said slowly. \u201cWhen I was an infant, I lived in a large clan with unlimited, glorious prospects. When I was young, I fled alongside my Father, eventually meeting your father and adventuring alongside him, braving danger. Afterwards, I lived ten peaceful years at the Ji clan\u2026in my life, I\u2019ve had a father who loved me, older brothers and sisters who loved me, a man who loved me, and you\u2026my most beloved son. I truly feel content.\u201dNing\u2019s tears were coming down nonstop. He couldn\u2019t control them, no matter what he tried. The only thing he could do was continuously hold his mother\u2019s hand. His mother\u2019s hand was no longer smooth; it had become rough and leathery, like a dry leaf without any vitality.Snow said slowly, \u201cIn your body is the bloodline of the Ji clan, as well as the bloodline of my Yuchi clan. For your mother to have had you\u2026is your mother\u2019s greatest pride in life.\u201d\u201cMother\u2026\u201d Ning stared at his mother.\u201cNing, son\u2026in the future, will you stay for a long time at Serpentwing Lake?\u201d Snow looked at her son.Ning nodded.As an Immortal practitioner, one had to have a base, after all. West Prefecture City was too crowded and had too many people. Serpentwing Lake was much calmer. In addition, Serpentwing Lake had the Aquatic Manor\u2026in the future, he would indeed often stay at Serpentwing Lake.\u201cAfter I die.\u201d Snow looked at Yichuan, by her side. \u201cAfter I am cremated, spread my ashes over Serpentwing Lake. Yichuan, you won\u2019t be jealous, will you?\u201dYichuan\u2019s eyes were moist. He forced out a laugh. \u201cSlightly jealous, actually. However, after I die, my ashes will also be spread over Serpentwing Lake. By then, we\u2019ll be together again, right?\u201dSnow laughed.Yichuan gently embraced his wife.\u201cNing, son.\u201d Snow\u2019s voice was growing weaker. She smiled. \u201cI want to look at our Yuchi clan\u2019s Windwing Evasion. Demonstrate it for me.\u201d\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d Ning rose to his feet.Behind him, out of nowhere, a pair of wings appeared. And then, forcibly resisting the pain in his heart, Ning began to execute the Windwing Evasion. Ning moved about like a giant Roc, gliding through the air, landing atop of a distant roof, and then with another flash, gliding to another place. His two wings trembled, and his movements were like that of an illusion.Ning, in this moment, was whole-heartedly focusing on displaying the Windwing Evasion, because this was the last request of his mother.\u201cWind!\u201d\u201cWind!\u201dAs Ning displayed it, the wind blew against him, like his mother\u2019s hand gently stroking his face. The touch of the wind was a caress of someone who didn\u2019t want to let go.Slowly\u2026Ning\u2019s movements became all the more marvelous, and he seemed to have truly become a giant Roc, moving all the more faster and all the more freely, incomparably agile.He was a giant Roc, a giant Roc who flew in the skies beyond the Nine Heavens. Ning, unconsciously, was unconsciously incorporating that insights he had gained that night into the True Meaning of the Wind, and merging it with the Windwing Evasion. He even incorporated some deep emotions into them, like a bird who was longing for the wind.\u201cThe great Roc.\u201d Snow\u2019s eyes lit up as she watched, and she murmured softly, \u201cThe great Roc\u2026\u201dShe seemed to have seen her older brother.That tall, stalwart man who had protected and cherished her since she was young. Her brother\u2019s usage of the Windwing Evasion was so similar to the way in which Ning\u2019s Windwing Evasion looked\u2026\u201cBig Brother\u2026\u201d Snow seemed to have returned to the past.A large courtyard. Her older brother was there, training in the Windwing Evasion, while her, as a toddler, was running around calling out, \u201cBig Brother, Big Brother.\u201d\u201cLittle Sis.\u201d That man, as tall and mighty as a mountain, turned to look at her.\u201cBig Sis, Father.\u201d She saw two more figures, one an elegant middle-aged man with a long beard, while the other was a seemingly cold and arrogant young woman. This was her father and her older sister.\u201cBig Brother. Big Sis. Father\u2026I\u2019m coming.\u201dThe child-Snow ran forward, ran to the side of her older brother, her older sister, and her father. Together again. They were finally together again\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lying in Yichuan\u2019s arms, Snow closed her eyes.A peaceful smile was on her face.\u201cAhh\u2026ahhhh\u2026.aaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d Yichuan opened his mouth, making some noise, but wasn\u2019t able to speak. He tightly clutched his wife, raising his head high, but the tears still came spilling out.The distant Ning came to a halt. His entire body trembling, he took one step forward after another, walking towards his mother\u2019s side, then kneeling down.\u201cMother!\u201d Ning began to sob, a rumbling, heart-broken sound.\u2026\u2026\u2026..The sound spread outside of the courtyard. The servants outside, hearing the sobs of their young master Ji Ning, filled with such agony, misery, and sadness, immediately understood that their mistress had already died. All of them couldn\u2019t help but to lower their heads, their tears spilling out. They would never forget this benevolent mistress of theirs.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026\u2026..Ning left West Prefecture City, going to live on the island in Serpentwing Lake.According to the dying wishes of his mother, he personally scattered her ashes within the waters of Serpentwing Lake. From that day onwards, Ning gained a new hobby. He liked to lie down atop a small boat, allowing the boat to drift freely in the waters of Serpentwing Lake.It was like\u2026Lying in the embrace of his mother.

In the blink of an eye, nearly five years passed.Serpentwing Lake. Brightheart Island.Brightheart was the name which Ji Ning had given this island in the center of the lake. The island had multiple buildings constructed atop it, and the formerly desolate island had been made into a beautiful place, like an unearthly utopia. It was currently at the changing of seasons from spring to summer, and all sorts of flowers were blooming and eye-catching. After careful arrangements by some servants, they appeared all the more beautiful and captivating.\u201cBig Sis Autumn Leaf, Big Sis Autumn Leaf.\u201d A youth dressed in blue clothes ran over while shouting.Autumn Leaf, who had been boiling a kettle of tea, turned to look. Laughing, she said, \u201cBluestone, your archery lessons have concluded? Did your Master Blindfish rebuke you?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Bluestone rubbed his head and said resignedly, \u201cHow can I not be rebuked? Each time I practice archery, Master Blindfish will always lecture me. He\u2019ll also often compare me to Big Bro. But how can I compare to Big Bro? You know what a genius he is!\u201d\u201cYou need to treasure this chance.\u201d Autumn Leaf viewed Bluestone as she might her own little brother. She said seriously, \u201cYoung master himself said that although Master Blindfish had his dantian destroyed, that just made him become even more focused on archery\u2026and his archery abilities have risen to a whole new level. It\u2019s only because Master Blindfish is living here on Brightheart Island and because the young master asked him to do so that he is willing to teach you. You need to work hard. If you master it, it will be a consummate technique for you.\u201dBluestone immediately nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201dBluestone\u2019s life on Brightheart Island was quite carefree. Ning whole-heartedly treated him as he would a little brother, and acted towards him as an older brother would. One could tell how close their relationship was, just by the way Bluestone addressed him; generally speaking, a younger individual would address a more senior one as \u2018Elder Brother\u2019. Only someone who grew up together and thus were very close to each other would use the term \u2018Big Bro\u2019.\u201cRight.\u201d Autumn Leaf laughed and nodded.\u201cWhere is Big Bro Ji Ning?\u201d Bluestone asked. \u201cTraining with the sword?\u201dAutumn Leaf laughed, \u201cHe\u2019s not training the sword.\u201d\u201cOh. Then he\u2019s sleeping on Serpentwing Lake.\u201d Bluestone laughed. After having lived on Serpentwing Lake for five years, he had become well acquainted with Ning\u2019s habits. Ning, aside from training with the sword, spent most of his time casually drifting on Serpentwing Lake aboard a small boat while napping.\u201cRight. He\u2019s sleeping.\u201d Autumn Leaf turned to look towards that boundless lake as well.Bluestone couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cOriginally, I asked Big Bro Ji Ning why he is always sleeping on Serpentwing Lake. Big Bro just said\u2026he is training. I don\u2019t get it. How can sleeping atop Serpentwing Lake be training? But Big Bro Ji Ning\u2019s swordplay really is becoming increasingly more powerful. Two years ago, Commander Yichuan acknowledged that he didn\u2019t believe he could beat him!\u201d\u201cRight. The young master\u2019s swordplay has reached an unfathomably high level.\u201d Autumn Leaf sighed. \u201cI once watched the young master train with the sword, and when I did, I saw some aquatic birds flew over en masse, then fly around him in a circle for some time, unwilling to leave.\u201d\u201cSo bizarre!\u201d Bluestone was surprised.\u201cIn the past, Commander Yichuan would spar once with the young master every year. Two years ago, when he felt he wouldn\u2019t be able to win, he stopped coming. Unfortunately, the young master forbade me from watching, so I don\u2019t know how what the battle scene between the Commander and the young master was like.\u201d Autumn Leaf felt a hint of longing. In her eyes, the swordplay of Ji Yichuan had reached a mythical level long ago, but her young master\u2019s swordplay had apparently reached an even higher, deeper level.Yichuan lived on Brightheart Island as well. However, it was on the other end of Brightheart Island. He normally was a solitary, arrogant figure, forbidding anyone from approaching him, and without any servants serving him. Only Ning was permitted to go to his residence to accompany Yichuan, his father.\u201cI\u2019m truly curious. What level has Big Bro reached in swordplay, exactly?\u201d Bluestone\u2019s eyes were filled with veneration.\u201cLook.\u201d Autumn Leaf suddenly looked towards the lake.\u201cHuh?\u201d Bluestone turned to look as well.In the distance, a single boat could be faintly seen. At first, a look of delight appeared on Bluestone\u2019s face as he took it for the boat on which Ning slept, but when he looked more closely\u2026he saw that this was a large ship, the one which often delivered people to and from the shores of the lake. After all, quite a few people were now living on Brightheart Island, with nearly a hundred servants being present. Large amounts of food would often be delivered to the island, and some outsiders would come visit. Naturally, they had to have this ferry.Atop the ferry.There was a group of youths atop the ferry, and they were chatting and joking amongst themselves.\u201cThe Central Prefecture Lord told us to come pay our respects to Ji Ning.\u201d A big, burly-chested youth had a hint of disgruntlement in his eyes. \u201cWe are the Central Prefecture of the Ji clan. We are far more powerful than the other four Prefectures! The six of us are the most powerful members of the younger generation of the Ji clan of the Central Prefecture. To have us come spar with this Ji Ning is one thing, but he actually said that we were to come \u2018pay our respect\u2019 and have this Ji Ning \u2018provide guidance to us\u2019? And that we had to be reverential towards him?\u201d\u201cShut your mouth.\u201d A handsome looking youth said. \u201cThe Central Prefecture Lord stated that we must be respectful and that we must address him as young master Ji Ning.\u201d\u201cFine, fine. Young master Ji Ning.\u201d The big youth couldn\u2019t refrain from adding, \u201cThat\u2019s fine for the rest of us, but Ji Mo, you are the number one, ultimate genius amongst the younger generation of our Ji clan of the Central Prefecture. You became a Xiantian expert at age fifteen, and reached the level of mastery long ago in the ultimate technique of our Ji clan, the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords]. That Ji Ning\u2026although that young master Ji Ning became a Xiantian expert a few years earlier than you, the two of you will simply spar at most. How can you be asked to \u2018pay your respects\u2019 to him and have him \u2018provide guidance\u2019 to you?\u201d\u201cJi Mo.\u201d A black haired woman said. \u201cTongzhan speaks the truth. The instructions the Central Prefecture Lord gave us, none of us will openly oppose, but in our hearts, none of us truly submit either. We are the most talented youths of the Central Prefecture, while that Ji Ning\u2026that young master Ji Ning is only the most talented youth of the West Prefecture. No matter how much of a genius he is, at most he\u2019ll be a bit more powerful than us. How can he be qualified to have us \u2018go pay our respects\u2019 to him?\u201d\u201cEnough, all of you.\u201dThe handsome youth\u2019s gaze was like water. He swept everyone with his gaze, and the other five youths all fell silent.Ji Mo was, without question, the number one figure in the younger generation of the Ji clan of the Central Prefecture. In addition, ever since he had been young, he had followed by the side of Granny Shadow, and thus Mo\u2019s status was all the more unique\u2026many people were certain that Mo would be the next Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan of the Central Prefecture.\u201cYou all know that I follow Granny Shadow.\u201d Mo said slowly.\u201cRight.\u201d Looks of awe appeared in the eyes of the other five.Granny Shadow\u2026In the entire Ji clan, there were two people who stood at the very pinnacle of the clan. One was the Patriarch, Ji Ninefire! The other was Granny Shadow! Granny Shadow was the sibling and younger sister of Ninefire, an old granny who had also lived for nearly four centuries. But, without question, she had been at the Zifu Disciple level for three hundred years.The two of them were the two publicly acknowledged Zifu Disciples of the Ji clan.As for whether or not there were other Zifu Disciples hidden in the shadows, that was hard to say. A clan would naturally want to hide some cards up their sleeves, interchanging truth and lies. This led to longevity.\u201cGranny Shadow personally taught me swordplay.\u201d Mo said softly. \u201cMy swordplay, compared to Granny Shadow\u2019s, is unimaginably weaker. Do you know why the six of us have been sent by the Central Prefecture Lord to Serpentwing Lake to pay our respects to Ji Ning?\u201d\u201cI hear the North Prefecture, the East Prefecture, and the South Prefecture had already sent their younger generation members over to pay their respects to young master Ji Ning, and so our Central Prefecture sent the six of us as well.\u201d\u201cWrong.\u201dJi Mo shook his head lightly.\u201cOur Central Prefecture is the root of the Ji clan. The Patriarch and Granny Shadow are both within our Central Prefecture.\u201d Mo said. \u201cThe territory that our Central Prefecture takes up is the greatest, and the number of Xiantian experts we have far surpasses the number the other four prefectures have. Even the Crimson Guards are stationed in our Central Prefecture. Why, then, must our Central Prefecture act in the same manner as the other prefectures?\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s the reason?\u201d They all looked towards Mo.Mo said softly, \u201cThe reason is, one year ago, Granny Shadow made a trip here to Serpentwing Lake.\u201d\u201cGranny Shadow came to Serpentwing Lake?\u201d The other five youths instantly began to think of many possibilities.Mo said, \u201cThe Patriarch had once praised young master Ji Ning highly, saying that in the future, he would definitely be the number one expert of our Ji clan! Granny Shadow thus decided to come here to Serpentwing Lake to personally see what sort of ability this Ji Ning had\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat did Granny Shadow say?\u201d The five youths looked expectantly at Mo.Mo\u2019s eyes had a very strange light to them. He said slowly, \u201cAfter Granny Shadow returned, I repeatedly asked her how I was in comparison to young master Ji Ning. The only thing Granny Shadow would say was that it was hard to compare. That it was hard to compare. I kept on asking her what level of swordplay this young master Ji Ning had reached, and Granny Shadow just replied with a single phrase; \u2018unfathomably deep\u2019!\u201d\u201cUnfathomably deep!\u201d The five youths were stunned. For even Granny Shadow to say such a thing\u2026how terrifying was Ji Ning\u2019s swordplay?\u201cEveryone, time to disembark.\u201d A sailor said loudly.Only now did the six of them look over. The ferry had already neared the shore, and from afar, various buildings arose within their vision, an amazingly beautiful sight. The six of them couldn\u2019t help but sigh in amazement in their hearts, while Ji Mo\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThis is where Ji Ning lives?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

From the island, four figures walked over, the leader being a beautiful woman dressed in simple, plain clothes. By her side was a youth dressed in blue, while two Crimson Guards followed them from the side. There were a total of a hundred Crimson Guards on the island, which Ji Ninefire had especially stationed here.\u201cI imagine you are Manager Autumn Leaf.\u201d Ji Mo, the leader of the six youths, extended his hand, and within it, a beast skin appeared which had some words written atop it. \u201cWe are here at the commands of our Central Prefecutre Lord, and we have come to pay our respects to young master Ji Ning.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Autumn Leaf accepted the beast skin parchment and glanced at it.All of the various matters pertaining to Brightheart Island were under Autumn Leaf\u2019s control, and she had been appointed as the General Manager by Ji Ning.Autumn Leaf carefully read through the beast skin parchment, then lifted her head and smiled. \u201cWe had already received the news previously and had been informed that six outstanding talents of the Central Prefecture were coming. Everyone, please follow me.\u201d\u201cWe have come to pay our respects to young master Ji Ning. Might I ask when young master Ji Ning will be able to see us?\u201dWhile following Autumn Leaf, the six youths asked this question.Autumn Leaf just said, \u201cEveryone, don\u2019t be hasty. You will definitely see the young master today.\u201dSoon, the six youths were led to a quiet, reclusive residence which was specially used for receiving guests. Autumn Leaf instructed a pair of maidservants, \u201cThese six are our esteemed guests from the Central Prefecture. Take good care of them.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The two maidservants acknowledged.\u201cEveryone.\u201d Autumn Leaf looked at the six of them and laughed. \u201cOnce our young master has time, I will definitely come inform the six of you. Everyone, you must be tired from your journey. You can rest here for now.\u201dAfter speaking, Autumn Leaf led Bluestone and the others away.\u201cHmph, people of high status really are troublesome!\u201d The tall, muscular youth, Ji Tongzhan, was so angry his eyes bulged. \u201cWhat could this young master Ji Ning possibly be worrying about, living here in such a secluded, quiet little lake island? This female manager even said \u2018when our young master has free time\u2019. Jeeze\u2026they really hold us in no regard at all.\u201d\u201cThe Central Prefecture ordered someone to convey the letter long ago to inform them of our arrival. It\u2019s one thing for young master Ji Ning to not come welcome us, but he won\u2019t even let us know when he will meet with us, and instead just has us wait here like fools?\u201dThese youths were all the talented, favored sons of heaven.Although they believed that Ji Ning was one level stronger than them, they were still people of the same age. For them to be slighted like this\u2026they were rather unhappy.\u201cEndure it!\u201d Ji Mo just sat there and called out to them quietly. \u201cWe are here to pay our respects. Thus, wait here obediently for young master Ji Ning to summon us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just discontent, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cRight. Everyone talks about how powerful young master Ji Ning is, but none of us have ever met him. He\u2019s only sixteen years old. How powerful can he be?\u201d These youths all chatted amongst themselves. Even Ji Mo, seated there, in his bones had the untamed arrogance inherent to all geniuses. What one heard didn\u2019t matter. What one saw was what really mattered!Until he personally witnessed Ji Ning\u2019s abilities, in Mo\u2019s heart, he too had a small ball of fiery anger that was currently smoldering.\u2026\u2026..The sun had already set, and the night fog had covered the entire western horizons. The setting sun\u2019s red glow covered the earth, causing the surface of Serpentwing Lake to appear as beautiful as a painting. Far away on the surface of the lake in this \u2018painting\u2019, a small boat was swaying as the water pushed it forward.\u201cIt\u2019s the young master\u2019s boat.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the young master.\u201dThe maidservants had noticed long ago, and they had immediately informed Manager Autumn Leaf. Autumn Leaf and Bluestone quickly arrived on the beach, staring at that distant little boat.Within the boat.Ning was comfortably lying there, his eyes shut. The lake around him was completely silent, as silent as a painting. Suddenly, he could vaguely sense the auras of many people in the distance, and as he did, his eyelids twitched, then opened.\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Ning immediately stood up, stretching lazily.He was still dressed in those beast fur clothes. However, these were formed from the transformation of a protective magic-treasure\u2026after all, he only had a few sets of beast fur clothes which his mother had sown for him. If he always wore them, they would eventually be ruined. Ning couldn\u2019t bear for that to happen, and so he stored them away. However, he still changed the appearance of his armor-type magic treasure into beast furs. He felt the most comfortable dressed in them anyhow.\u201cSplash.\u201d The speed of the boat suddenly increased rapidly, and it broke through the waves, advancing at high speed, charging towards the distant island.Ning stood there atop the little boat, smiling as he greeted his Autumn Leaf and Bluestone.When the boat drew near the island, it actually disappeared. Ning walked atop the waves, arriving at the beach.\u201cYoung master.\u201d Autumn Leaf laughed as she went to welcome him.\u201cBig Bro Ji Ning.\u201d Bluestone immediately ran over as well, saying excitedly, \u201cToday, six youths of the Central Prefecture came. They act so high and mighty and look down on people so much, they might as well have their eyes growing from the tops of their heads.\u201dNing seemed to have thought of something. \u201cOh? This is that group of the most talented youths of the Central Prefecture?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Autumn Leaf nodded. \u201cThey arrived at noon.\u201d\u201cHave them come to the sword training field.\u201d Ning laughed. \u201cSince the Central Prefecture had them come, their intention is for me to give these youths a sound beating.\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll go invite them right now.\u201d Autumn Leaf immediately said.\u2026\u2026\u2026The sword training field.This was a wide area of more than three hundred meters, locate in front of Ning\u2019s residence. This was the place where Ning usually trained with the sword.\u201cI\u2019ve already drank five bottles of water. It\u2019s almost night. He\u2019s finally willing to meet us.\u201d\u201cThis Ji Ning has been made out to be a near legendary figure. I wonder what he\u2019s actually like.\u201dThe six men and women spoke to each other softly, all clearly quite excited. They were filled with boundless curiosity towards this legendary young master Ji Ning. Autumn Leaf led the way from up front, and they soon arrived at the sword training field. \u201cThe young master is there. You can go there.\u201dJi Mo and the other six looked over carefully.In the distance, a youth dressed in beast furs could be seen standing there. From his appearance, he wasn\u2019t too tall; he was still at the same height he had been when he had broken through to become a Xiantian expert. Only, for some reason\u2026just by standing there, Ning seemed to have become one with the surrounding area, as though the entire scene was one in a painting.The beast fur clad youth suddenly turned, leaving that earlier state of seeming to be a person in a painting. He seemed to have transformed into an Adept. Actually, before this, Ning had fused his soul with the world and was meditating on the \u2018Dao\u2019! Ever since he had moved to live on Serpentwing Lake, especially after he began to rest there on that little boat and casually drift on the surface of the lake each day, his entire soul had become incomparably peaceful and calm, and incomparably close to nature.At the same time, Ning\u2019s swordplay had advanced by leaps and bounds. His level had risen nonstop, to the point which by now, Ning was able to infuse the \u2018Dao\u2019 he had learned casually and freely into his techniques. Although there was no way he could completely absorb himself into the Dao, like he had that night by the pool, to train in such a manner\u2026was already inconceivable. This caused his swordplay to reach a truly astonishing level.\u201cAll of you, come over.\u201d Ning spoke out.Mo and the others all looked at this young master Ji Ning. His features were handsome and delicate, like a youth\u2019s. Only, he had a natural, reserved aura about him, an aura which one could only achieve after constantly improving upon one\u2019s mind and spirit.\u201cGreetings, young master Ji Ning.\u201d Mo and the rest of the six all walked forward and said respectfully.\u201cI heard that the most talented youth of the Central Prefecture is Ji Mo. Which of you is Ji Mo?\u201d Ning said directly. Since he was to give them a beating, he might as well just pick the strongest one. This would be more effective.\u201cMe.\u201d Mo said, his eyes fierce.Ning nodded. \u201cWhat do you train in?\u201d\u201cThe [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords]!\u201d Mo\u2019s eyes held great confidence within them. \u201cI just mastered it. I hope young master Ji Ning will provide me with some guidance.\u201d\u201cMastered?\u201d Ning nodded. \u201cThe [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords] is an ultimate technique which guards our entire clan, and is extremely marvelous. Take out your sword and use your most powerful sword attack against me. Let me see exactly how well you use the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords].\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Mo drew out his icy longsword. The longsword had some faint runes atop it. Clearly, this was a weapon-type magic treasure. Mo shouted out, \u201cYoung master Ji Ning, be careful.\u201dSwish!Instantly, the sword transformed into countless illusions, all of which appeared and swept forward towards Ning.Ning just stood there, watching. Just as those countless sword illusions enveloped him, he stretched out a finger and lightly tapped. \u201cBreak!\u201d Immediately, all of the sword illusions vanished, with the true form of the longsword appearing. Tapped by Ning\u2019s finger, the longsword which had flying towards Ning at high speed suddenly flew away on its own power.\u201cThis\u2026this\u2026\u201d Mo stared in shock, his eyes wide. The other five youths were completely stunned as well. Just by relying on his finger, he was able to flick away a sword which contained the power of the world? And they didn\u2019t feel that Ning\u2019s finger moved very quickly.\u201cHow is that possible\u2026my sword\u2026?\u201d Mo didn\u2019t dare believe it. \u201cYour force clearly wasn\u2019t that great. How could you instantly guide my force away and make my sword fly out?\u201d\u201cLet me ask you this.\u201d Ning barked. \u201cWhat techniques does the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords] have?\u201dMo hurriedly said, \u201cThe [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords] has three techniques in total. The \u2018One Sword, Ten Thousand Shadows\u2019 stance, the \u2018Ten Thousand Swords Become One\u2019, and the \u2018Melody of Ten Thousand Swords\u2019. Amongst them, the \u2018Melody of Ten Thousand Swords\u2019 is the most powerful lkilling technique. What I used just now was that most powerful technique, the \u2018Melody of Ten Thousand Swords\u2019!\u201dNing said, \u201cMelody of Ten Thousand Swords\u2026Melody of Ten Thousand Swords\u2026the most important part of it isn\u2019t the \u2018ten thousand swords\u2019, it is in the word \u2018melody\u2019!\u201d In recent years, Ji Ninefire had especially arranged for people to send over the various sword and saber techniques the Ji clan possessed, and Ning had flipped through all of them. At Ning\u2019s current level, he himself could develop techniques on par with these skills. All he had to do was to get an understanding of their essence.\u201cMelody?\u201d Mo was awestruck.\u201cWatch carefully.\u201d Ning pointed with his finger, and a ray of sword light solidified, slicing through the air.Immediately, the sky was filled with sword images, and the countless sword images appeared everywhere, seemingly quite similar to the \u2018Melody of Ten Thousand Swords\u2019 which Mo had just used. But at the same time, these countless, densely clustered sword shadows seemed to form into multiple musical notes, each of which had their own differences. These countless sword shadows actually formed into a single, high-pitched song.Passion!Celebration!Ji Mo and the other six were completely stunned. They could actually sense a sort of joy emanating from those countless sword shadows, which seemed to have a life of their own.\u201cWatch now.\u201d Ning shot out another ray of sword light, once more forming into countless blurry sword shadows. Those countless sword shadows affected each other, each of which seemed to be independent and yet which linked up with the others\u2026the countless musical notes transformed into a song, but this song was filled with boundless killing intent, a killing intent which caused their courage to turn cold.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEvery single sword shadow seemed like a soldier, and the countless soldiers were bellowing while charging forward, covering the skies and filling the skies with their killing intent.The faces of Mo and the other five were completely ashen. They couldn\u2019t help but unconsciously retreat.\u201cDo you see?\u201d The sword light from Ning\u2019s finger vanished. \u201cThis is the \u2018melody\u2019. The soul of the entire sword technique! It doesn\u2019t matter what type of soul it is; only with a soul will your ten thousand swords truly become one, and truly become the astonishing sword melody!\u201dThe other five felt utterly astonished.As for Ji Mo, who had an extremely deep level of accomplishment with regards to the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords], he was thoroughly convinced and subdued. With a \u2018bang\u2019 sound, he immediately knelt down in front of Ning. \u201cPlease accept me as your disciple!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, for a sword technique to have a \u2018soul\u2019, what was required was an understanding of the Dao. This wasn\u2019t something that could simply be taught! Ning next provided guidance to the others, one by one. The attitudes of these youths had immediately become incomparably humble. All of them raised issues which had normally puzzled them, and Ning naturally was able to very easily resolve them. Just in terms of sword technique alone, there was no one within the Ji clan who could compare to him.He spent four full hours providing guidance to them, and afterwards, Ning sent them off.\u201cGo back and spend some time pondering these things. I won\u2019t keep you here any further.\u201d After providing guidance, Ning himself left.The six youths just watched longingly as Ning left. How they wished that Ning could spend some more time giving them guidance!\u2026\u2026\u2026..Night.Ning was seated in the lotus position on his bed mattress, training. Elemental energy was constantly surging towards him, entering his body and liquefying into Ki. After a long time, when he sensed that his dantian had become somewhat swollen, Ning came to a halt.\u201cMost likely, within a few more months, I will be able to establish my \u2018Violet Palace\u2019 as a Ki Refiner.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cHowever, to reach the Zifu Disciple level as a practitioner of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] will require me to reach the seventh level of that art. I wonder how long it will be before I reach it.\u201dBy now, he had already reached the peak of power as a Xiantian lifeform as both a Ki Refiner and as a Fiendgod Body Refiner.The technique he was using to train as a Ki Refiner was an ordinary technique of the Ji clan, known as the [Water Element Art]. The quality of the ki provided by those who trained in this technique was fairly poor, but it was easy to breakthrough to become a Zifu Disciple! Given Ning\u2019s current level of understanding regarding the Dao, once the accumulated ki in his body reached a certain level, he could rely on it to immediately establish his Zifu \u2018Violet Palace\u2019!\u201cThis [Water Element Art] is a very ordinary technique.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cIt can only allow a person to train to the Zifu Disciple level. After establishing the \u2018Violet Palace\u2019, I\u2019ll have to acquire a new Ki Refining technique.\u201dThe further a Ki Refining technique allowed one to progress, the more valuable it was.\u201cWhen the time comes, I must find a more formidable Ki Refining technique.\u201d Ning pondered to himself. \u201cThe [Water Element Art] is, in the end, a very superficial technique. If I continue to use this sort of superficial technique in the future\u2026most likely, my development in Ki Refining will come to a halt at the Wanxiang level.\u201dThis was the difference between a high class technique and a low class technique!A high class, hard-to-learn technique was hard to start training in, but it allowed one to begin slowly walking in the right direction, constantly advancing on firm footing.As for low class techniques, they made it easy for one to establish the \u2018Violet Palace\u2019, and if one went all out, one had the chance to reach the Wanxiang Adept level. But\u2026to become a Primal Daoist? There was no hope of it whatsoever.The Ji clan, after all, was a fairly low level clan. It didn\u2019t have any high class Fiendgod Body Refining techniques or Ki Refining techniques. It did have the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] technique, which was unique in that it was widely spread throughout the lands. The other Ki Refining techniques the clan possessed were all very poor; this was why the likes of Ji Ninefire and Granny Shadow had been training for nearly four centuries, but were still at the Zifu Disciple stage.\u201cI have to go out adventuring.\u201d Ning was rather eager. \u201cI\u2019ll wait to establish my Violet Palace first. By then, I will be better equipped to protect myself. The little power I have right now is still rather insufficient.\u201dNing knew his own power quite well.As a Ki Refiner, he was at the peak Xiantian level; however, half a year ago, he had already become capable of executing the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], and his attack power should have reached the peak Zifu Disciple level! His weakness was that his ki was used up too quickly, and that he wasn\u2019t able to fight for as long as most Zifu Disciples.As a Body Refiner, he had reached the peak Xiantian level in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. He was already comparable to early, ordinary Zifu Disciple level Fiendgod Body Refiners! Given his current lifeforce, even if his skull was pierced through, he still wouldn\u2019t die! Although his attack power was somewhat weaker than that of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], once battle truly began, his body was still the more powerful aspect of the two.\u201cAlthough the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] is incomparably sharp\u2026\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cIf I were to encounter a Zifu Disciple who is an Fiendgod Body Refiner and whose body is incomparably durable, even if I can chop through his body with a ray of sword light, his body would quickly heal.\u201d\u201cAgainst Zifu level Ki Refiners, I can give them a good fight, even if they are peak Zifu Disciples.\u201d\u201cBut against Fiendgod Body Refiners\u2026I can deal with early stage ones, but anything stronger than that will be hard.\u201d Ning knew this very well. \u201cI wonder what I need to do to breakthrough in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. Transform Yin and Yang\u2026Blood-Drop Rebirth\u2026what must I do to achieve this?\u201dNot dying when one\u2019s head was cut through wasn\u2019t much.But if he could reach the seventh stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], he would possess the ability to regenerate himself from a single drop of blood! Life energy as powerful as this made it extremely hard for other Zifu Ki Refiners to deal with him. To kill an Fiendgod Body Refiner expert\u2026how hard it was! The only way was to slowly exhaust the expert of all his divine power.\u201cBlood-Drop Rebirth.\u201d Ning was filled with eagerness.Actually, the current Ning was already an absolute monster. For attack, he had the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]! He had also become a peak Xiantian in the number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique, and even Zifu Disciples would find it hard to kill him! It was hard for others to kill him, but by relying on the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], he could kill others from far away.\u201cNot enough, not enough. If Bei Zishan\u2019s insect swarms were ten times greater in number, they would still be able to kill me through exhausting my power..\u201d Ning didn\u2019t dare to be the slightest bit incautious.He still remembered what the old black bull had told him\u2026That he was not to underestimate any Immortal practitioner! You are formidable, but aren\u2019t others also in possession of formidable techniques?\u201cWhew.\u201dNing shut his eyes, beginning to visualize the [Nuwa Painting]. The visualization of the Nuwa Painting was something he continuously did. The reason he was now able to execute the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] was primarily thanks to the power of his divine will.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.The sky slowly brightened.Ning, seated quietly in the lotus position on his bed, suddenly opened his eyes, frowning as he carefully reached out with his senses.\u201cWas it just me?\u201d Ning murmured to himself.\u201cRumble\u2026\u201d A surge of incomparably powerful elemental energy rippled outwards, washing through Serpentwing Lake in an instant like a huge, roaring wave. This enormously powerful elemental ripple caused Ning\u2019s face to change. Swish! He flew straight out from the window, flying to the crown of a large tree and staring outwards.\u201cNorthward.\u201dNing stood there atop the tree\u2019s crown, staring into the distant north. The incomparably savage elemental ripple had come from the north.It was like the ripple caused by a stone being thrown into a pool of water. In a distant point to the north, incomparably powerful natural, elemental ripples were being cast out in every direction\u2026.one ripple after another surged outwards, sweeping out for thousands of kilometers, constantly broadcasting outwards.\u201cWhat a terrifying elemental energy ripple.\u201d Ning was amazed and stunned. \u201cTo be able to arouse such a powerful elemental aura\u2026the rate at which I absorb elemental energy when training, compared to this ripple, is like the light of a firefly compared to the glorious splendor of the sun and the moon. What is going on? What has caused such a powerful ripple?\u201dSwoosh!From another place within the island, a figure flew out, leaping across the tops of some trees and buildings, advancing at high speed. Soon, the figure reached Ning\u2019s side. It was Ji Yichuan, clad in a white beast fur jacket.\u201cFather.\u201d Ning looked at his father.\u201cYou felt it as well.\u201d Yichuan looked solemnly towards the north.\u201cRight. The north.\u201d Ning nodded, then said with incomparable solemnity, \u201cA terrifying elemental energy ripple. It was inconceivably strong. Given what I sensed, if I\u2019m not mistaken, this elemental energy ripple should have originated from thousands of kilometers to the north.\u201dYichuan nodded as well. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense it as clearly as you did, but the impression I received was essentially the same.\u201d\u201cFather, what on earth happened to cause such a powerful elemental energy ripple?\u201d Ning hurriedly asked.\u201cThere are many possibilities.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cIt is possible that a duel between Immortals has caused these elemental ripples. It is also possible that an ancient relic site has suddenly emerged! It\u2019s also possible that an Immortal magic treasure has revealed itself!\u201dNing\u2019s face changed. \u201cThen our Ji clan\u2026\u201dThe land thousands of kilometers to the north remained the territory of the Ji clan. The West Prefecture City of the Ji clan was to the southwest of the Central Prefecture City. The region thousands of kilometers to the north was one of the centermost areas of the entire Ji clan!\u201cNo matter which of the possibilities it is, it isn\u2019t good for our Ji clan.\u201d Yichuan said in a low voice.Ning\u2019s face became ugly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA battle between Immortals? An emergence of a relic site? An Immortal magic treasure revealing itself? Other unknown possibilities? How could the Ji clan, whose most powerful experts were only on the Zifu level, possibly withstand these things?\u201cCome, let\u2019s take a look.\u201d Yichuan said.\u201cFine.\u201d Ning was incomparably worried as well. At the same time, he immediately used his ki to send his voice to Autumn Leaf, who was staying in a room not too far from his own. \u201cAutumn Leaf, I\u2019m heading out. You are in charge of Brightheart Island.\u201dSwoosh!The two flew into the air at high speed, then running across the waves, quickly transformed into blurred rays of light which advanced to the north at high speed. At their level, when they put all their energy into their footwork techniques, they were actually rather faster than even the Azure Firebird, and many times faster than ordinary mounts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 13 \u2013 ImmortalA thousand kilometers south of the City of Ten Thousand Swords, the only commandery city of the Grand Xia Dynasty which was under control of the Ji clan. This place was a desolate mountain forest, completely ordinary and unremarkable! However, in the air above this desolate mountain forest, an enormous vortex had appeared! This was a rainbow vortex, thirty thousand meters high, its influence omnidirectional.This enormous rainbow vortex was wildly pulling in the surrounding elemental energy. Because the collection of elemental energy was too vigorous, and the density of the collected energy was too high, the swirling pressure compacted it to the point where a rainbow of colors had appeared. This enormous elemental vortex\u2026agitated the elemental aura in the surrounding area to surge outward in waves, causing those powerful ripples to broadcast in every direction!This elemental vortex was shaped like a sharp awl, pointed directly downwards towards the ground. Clearly, the origin of this natural vortex was directly located within the ground region of that desolate mountain forest.\u201cWhooosh!\u201dA male figure appeared in the air, amidst the vibrating elemental energy. This man had long, loose hair, and wore black, traditional robes which had a strange beast embroidered onto them. He wore a crested crown on his head, and his face was as pale as jade. He naturally emanated a lofty aura, and his gaze was directed downwards, staring towards that origin point which the swirling, enormous elemental vortex was \u2018pointing\u2019 towards.\u201cOh?\u201d The black robed man nodded slightly. \u201cThis Anomaly\u2026it should be that someone has reached the Void stage and become an Earth Immortal! I wonder if which side this new Earth Immortal belongs to\u2026this is Swallow Mountain. The number of large tribes, schools, and sects located near Swallow Mountain can be counted on one hand. The closest one is the Heavenly Saint Sect! Can it be that one of the Primal Daoists of the Heavenly Saint Sect has made a breakthrough? But if it were one of the Primal Daoists of the Heavenly Saint Sect, there should be protectors and guardians nearby.\u201dWhile pondering, he continued to stand there, watching quietly in mid-air.The appearance of an Anomaly such as this meant that this person had already succeeded. It would be too late to stop it.Rumble\u2026The enormous elemental vortex suddenly collapsed, causing the nearby elemental energy to violently tremble, but soon everything returned to normal. Right at the moment that the elemental vortex collapsed\u2026a man appeared out of nowhere, garbed in fiery red robes and carrying three greatswords on his back. His two temples had hints of white hair, and he swept the area with a lightning-like gaze, soon noticing the black robed man who stood in the distance in mid-air.\u201cCongratulations, my fellow Daoist, for having returned to the Void and become an Earth Immortal!\u201d The black robed man laughed.\u201cMight I ask who you are, fellow Daoist?\u201d The man carrying the three greatswords on his back asked immediately. He didn\u2019t dare to be discourteous either; he knew that the Anomaly generated by his breakthrough had lasted for only a short period of time. For someone to be able to sense it and also hurry over in such a short period of time\u2026that was no ordinary feat.The black robed man laughed. \u201cI am Northmont Skyfall! And you, fellow Daoist?\u201dThe red robed man, hearing this, was shocked.Northmont?Throughout the Stillwater Commandery, this surname was known to represent the most exalted force present; the Marquis of Stillwater! The Marquis of Stillwater was of the Northmont clan! Ever since the time when the Grand Xia Dynasty unified the world and bequeathed marquisdoms, the Northmont clan and the Marquis of Stillwater had been in control of this region. Their roots were extremely deep, far more so than any of the other forces present in Stillwater Commandery. The only organization capable of competing for supremacy in this region was the Raindragon Guard, which represented the Grand Xia Dynasty itself!A look of delight was on the red robed man\u2019s face as he said hurriedly, \u201cSo it is Immortal Laxiao! I was wondering who within the Stillwater Commandery could instantly notice this elemental Anomaly, and had guessed that only the Northmont clan of Stillwater was capable of this! I didn\u2019t expect that the famous, world-renowned Immortal Skyfall had come in person. Compared to you, Immortal Skyfall, I\u2019m just a junior. I imagine that you, Immortal Skyfall, have never even heard of my name. However, I did have a nickname in the past; Daoist Firedragon. Immortal Skyfall, have you heard of me?\u201dThis Immortal Skyfall who stood before him was a Loose Immortal who had lived for tens of thousands of years. The longer Loose Immortals lived, the more terrifying they became. Although he was confident in being able to stay alive if Immortal Skyfall attacked, he knew that in terms of power, as a new Earth Immortal, he was probably a level weaker in strength.\u201cDaoist Firedragon?\u201d Immortal Skyfall was briefly startled. He truly hadn\u2019t heard of this figure before. He immediately said, \u201cI truly haven\u2019t heard of you. I imagine that prior to this, fellow Daoist, you weren\u2019t present in the Stillwater Commandery region.\u201d\u201cWhen I was a Wanxiang Adept, I went to the East Sea.\u201d The red robed man immediately said. \u201cWhile adventuring in the East Sea, I suddenly broke through to the Primal stage, and acquired the nickname of Daoist Firedragon. Because I was in the distant, remote East Sea\u2026it isn\u2019t strange that you have never heard of me, Immortal Skyfall. A hundred years ago, I returned once more to this region. Perhaps because I felt very moved upon returning to my ancient homeland, I had a sudden feeling and thus immediately found a place to start training. I sealed myself into a training cave for a hundred years, and today, I just made my breakthrough.Immortal Skyfall nodded. \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is. Daoist Firedragon, might I ask where your homeland was?\u201d\u201cI myself am from Stillwater Commandery.\u201d Daoist Firedragon said. \u201cUnfortunately, my clan was eliminated long ago. I won\u2019t lie to you, Immortal Skyfall; the purpose of this return of mine was to seek out my clansmen and rebuild my clan, and also to avenge my clan and execute this blood feud.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Immortal Skyfall laughed clearly. \u201cSo Daoist Firedragon, you are of my Stillwater Commandery? My Stillwater Commandery now has yet another Immortal. I truly am overjoyed! It is karmic which brings the two of us together, Daoist Firedragon. As for your matters, you can consider them to be the matters of the Marquis Palace of Stillwater. There\u2019s no need for us to continue speaking here. Come, let\u2019s go to Stillwater City. My clan\u2019s Lord Marquis will definitely receive you, fellow Daoist, with the greatest of ceremony.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll obey your request rather than standing on ceremony.\u201d Daoist Firedragon laughed as well.An Immortal was someone worthy of befriending.Immortal Firedragon was in no rush to join a side right now. He had to see what sort of offers would be made to him, after all. He knew very well that in the end, this boundless world belonged to the Grand Xia Dynasty. If he wanted to rise and to make his clan grow and prosper, it was best if he either joined with the forces of the Grand Xia Dynasty, or if he joined with the forces of the various Marquises, who had deep roots in their respective areas.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Immortal Skyfall stretched his hand out, taking Immortal Firedragon\u2019s.Whoosh!They disappeared from mid-air.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.The City of Ten Thousand Swords was the base and foundation of the Ji clan. Ji Ninefire and Granny Shadow both lived within this city. What\u2019s more, that elemental Anomaly originated from just a thousand or so kilometers from the city; given their speed, the two of them naturally soon arrived at the desolate mountain forest.\u201cIt should be right here.\u201d Ninefire and Granny Shadow, along with an old servant, were currently standing atop a large magic calabash gourd. Ninefire was staring down at the desolate mountain forest. He said, \u201cBut why is it that it seems as though this mountain wilderness is very calm. There\u2019s nothing special here.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t see anything either.\u201d Granny Shadow and the old servant were watching as well.\u201cElder Brother.\u201d Granny Shadow said in her hoarse voice. \u201cI\u2019ll go down and take a look. Ah Xing, you stay here as well.\u201d\u201cMistress, let me go.\u201d The old servant let out a hoarse whisper, and then transformed into a ray of light, descending towards the desolate mountain forest below.Granny Shadow was frantic. \u201cAh Xing!\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Ninefire looked at Granny Shadow. \u201cThis old servant of yours truly is devoted to you.\u201dThe earlier, violent ripples of elemental energy clearly involved a major affair. The first person to investigate thus would be taking on great risk. Ninefire, as the Patriarch of the Ji clan, was the true pillar of the clan and thus couldn\u2019t be risked. This was why Granny Shadow was about to go down, but the old servant went down first.\u201cIn the entire world, Ah Xing is the most loyal person to me.\u201d Granny Shadow said gently.Moments later\u2026A blur from below rose into the skies, landing atop the flying gourd. It was that old servant with unbound hair and dressed in beast furs. Ninefire immediately asked, \u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201cThere is a large amount of elemental ore below.\u201d The old servant said in a low voice.\u201cA large amount of elemental ore?\u201d Ninefire frowned. \u201cHow much?\u201d Elemental ore contained gems which possessed elemental energy. However, the amount of elemental energy which people were able to absorb each day was limited, generally speaking. At a certain point in time, it would be impossible to absorb any more. Ordinary elemental gems were thus used to set up formations, or they might be useful in creating golems.But training? They weren\u2019t very useful.But of course, some rare natural treasures existed that didn\u2019t place much of a strain on the body, but which when ingested could provide power comparable to ten or even a hundred years of training. In addition, amongst elemental stones, there were high quality ones which had special effects. The elemental energy within high class elemental stones was very pure; when absorbing the energy within them, the body wasn\u2019t placed under much strain, and thus by using them, in a single day, one would be able to make gains comparable to ten days of normal training. However, the rate of consumption of stones for training in such a way was significant as well! It wasn\u2019t so bad if one only occasionally used a piece or two of high class elemental stones, but if an Immortal practitioner wanted to use them for long term training, one would have to buy thousands or more.This wasn\u2019t something which the Ji clan was capable of affording.\u201cVery many. Very many.\u201d The old servant said solemnly. \u201cIt should be an elemental ore mine. In addition, my superficial scan turned up high quality elemental stones already.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat? An elemental ore mine? With high class elemental stones?\u201d Ninefire was instantly stunned.An elemental ore mine?Generally speaking, certain special environments would produce elemental ore mines. But of course, one was also capable of intentionally forming an elemental ore mine. For the sake of making his breakthrough, Immortal Firedragon had to have enough elemental energy present for him to use. Thus, he was willing to pay a high price to set up a grand formation which drew in the surrounding elemental energy. Day after day, month after month, an elemental ore mine was formed.\u201cElemental ore mine?\u201d Granny Shadow revealed a look of excitement as well. \u201cOur Ji clan is about to suddenly rise to prominence?!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look first.\u201d Ninefire suppressed his excitement. He immediately collected his magic gourd, and the three of them descended at high speed into the desolate mountain forest, diving into the ground to investigate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ji Ning and his father, Ji Yichuan, were currently moving at top speed, moving towards the origin of those elemental ripples.\u201cEh? I have never competed against Father in speed before. Father is actually this fast?\u201d Ning was extremely surprised. His divine body was comparable to that of early-stage Zifu-level Fiendgod practitioners. Given that he also had the Windwing Evasion technique, one could imagine how fast he was. Even when he didn\u2019t use his wing-type magic treasure, he was still very fast\u2026but his father, Ji Yichuan, was able to move at the same pace as him.\u201cFather, your footwork technique\u2026? Can it be that you have established your Violet Palace?\u201d Ning use his ki to ask mentally while hurrying forward. He didn\u2019t realize that when the disaster had occurred, aside from the injuries suffered by the Yuchi siblings, his own father, Yichuan, had been heavily wounded as well.\u201cNo need to ask.\u201d Yichuan clearly didn\u2019t want to discuss it. \u201cThis speed is already my maximum.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Ning nodded.If he were to use his wing-type magic treasures, he would still be able to increase his speed by quite a bit, but there was no need.Swoosh! Swoosh!The two moved forward like blurs of smoke. Moving at such an astonishing speed, this distance of thousands of kilometers was traversed in just a single hour! Their speed was completely at that of the Zifu Disciple level.\u201cIt should be in this region.\u201d Ning came to a halt, standing atop the crown of a large, ancient tree. He stared towards a mountain forest. \u201cThe ripple originated from no more than three hundred kilometers away.\u201d\u201cShould be.\u201d Yichuan nodded as well.\u201cLet\u2019s take a close look.\u201d The two looked about carefully as they ran forward atop the trees. Soon, Yichuan jumped directly down into the ground, emerging shortly afterwards. \u201cNing, come over here.\u201d Ning immediately leapt down, moving like a ray of light to the grassy area where Yichuan was currently standing.Ning hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThere are elemental stones underground.\u201d Yichuan said solemnly. \u201cAnd this should be an extremely rich elemental ore mine. I\u2019ve even noticed high quality elemental stones.\u201d\u201cHigh quality elemental stones?\u201d Ning was shocked as well. \u201cThe area under the control of my Ji clan actually has high quality elemental stones?\u201d\u201cThis vein of elemental stones is extremely rich, and there are very few other ores mixed in. Still, because these are elemental stones\u2026there\u2019s no way to traverse through them using ground-tunneling arts.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cJust by using ground-tunneling arts, I was only able to burrow to a depth of a hundred and fifty meters, which is where the elemental ore mine begins. Further down\u2026is an extremely rich vein of elemental ore.\u201dNing nodded. Ground-tunneling techniques allowed one to pass through ordinary dirt and rocks, but some special materials were completely impassable. Elemental stones, for example, were impassable.\u201cSwish!\u201dFrom afar, a hundred kilometers away, a golden light suddenly rose into the skies, emitting an ear-piercing sound.Ning and Yichuan both turned to look.\u201cThe golden arrow of the Ji clan!\u201d Ning and Yichuan, upon seeing it, immediately used their movement techniques to hurry forward. They traversed a kilometer with every single movement. This golden arrow of the Ji clan was used as a summons, calling all of the men of the Ji clan in the surrounding area who saw it to hurry forward to its location.\u2026\u2026..Ning and Yichuan saw from far away that more than ten people were present, amongst them the gray-robed Ji Ninefire and Granny Shadow. The others belonged to the Central Prefecture of the Ji clan; after all, this place was closest to the Central Prefecture City, the City of Ten Thousand Swords. These people turned to look and recognized this father-son duo.\u201cYichuan, the two of you, father and son, really are fast.\u201d Ninefire said.\u201cWe hurried over from the City of Ten Thousand Swords, but we just arrived. You two, father and son, are located at the border regions of West Prefecture City, but you arrived as well.\u201d\u201cFormidable.\u201dThese Xiantian experts all said in praise.\u201cYou came quite quickly.\u201d A laugh rang out. A ray of light descended at high speed, then walked over. It was a middle-aged man dressed in beast furs.\u201cTruekeep, you came as well.\u201d Ninefire smiled and nodded.Ning saw this middle-aged figure come over. This man was named \u2018Ji Truekeep\u2019, and he was the number one figure of the Ji clan of the Northern Prefecture, on par with Ning\u2019s father. For him to be able to hurry over from North Prefecture City so quickly\u2026it seemed that Ji Truekeep should be a Zifu Disciple as well.\u201cOn the surface, my Ji clan only has Ji Ninefire and Granny Shadow, two Zifu Disciples.\u201d Ning said to himself. \u201cHowever, a clan must have heirs and members amongst the younger generation who have reached the Zifu Disciple level. Now, it seems as though this Ji Truekeep truly is a Zifu Disciple. My father, given the earlier movement abilities he displayed, should also be a Zifu Disciple!\u201dYichuan and Truekeep glanced at each other, nodding.Yichuan spoke out, \u201cPatriarch, why have you summoned us?\u201d\u201cI imagine that you have discovered as well,\u201d Ninefire said solemnly, \u201cThat underground, there is an elemental ore mine. A very rich vein of elemental ore.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d All of the clansmen nodded, their eyes filled with excitement.Based on the rules of the Grand Xia Dynasty, the land within ten thousand kilometers of a commandery city belonged to the master of that commandery city! As for any territories under dispute outside of that area, the ownership of those regions depended on who had the strongest fist. This elemental ore mine was extremely close to the City of Ten Thousand Swords. According to the rules set by the Grand Xia Dynasty\u2026without question, it belonged to the Ji clan!\u201cNot only is this vein very rich, it is also very large.\u201d Ninefire looked towards the surrounding area. \u201cWe will now carry out a detailed analysis and mapping of this elemental ore mine. I will fly towards the southeast. Truekeep, you fly towards the north. Shadow, you fly towards the southwest. As for everyone else, carefully investigate how deep this mine is and the quality of the ore within it. No matter what the results are, within four hours, we\u2019ll regroup here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d All of them assented.Soon, three rays of light flew towards three different directions, while Ning, Yichuan, and the others burrowed into the ground. Because there was no way to use ground-tunneling arts through elemental ore, the only option they had to was to slowly dig through.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Ning\u2019s body became surrounded by the petals of his Waterflame Lotus, which slowly swiveled about him, easily digging into the ground below.This allowed Ning to easily move deeper into the ground, step by step.As soon as he went downwards, the earth and mud above him collapsed.But Ning just ignored it, continuing to move downwards\u2026and he soon ran into the surface layer of the elemental ore mine. Large amounts of elemental ore were connected to each other like ugly rocks. These were all low-quality elemental stones, and just by looking at them, one wouldn\u2019t be able to see much of a difference between them and ordinary rocks. The only difference was that they emanated quite a bit of an elemental aura.Crackle\u2026The Waterflame Lotus easily dug downwards, and Ning continued to move down at an astonishing rate.\u201cSo deep.\u201d Ning could sense that he had already tunneled downwards for a hundred kilometers, but he was still surrounded by a large amount of elemental stones. \u201cThe hundred kilometers above me is filled with elemental stones. How deep is this elemental ore mine? And the top of the elemental ore mine was only a few dozen meters from the surface of the ground. How is it that nobody has discovered this mine, in all this time?\u201dWhat Ning didn\u2019t understand was that before Immortal Firedragon had set up a grand formation, who could have possibly found it?\u201cSwoosh.\u201d He finally encountered ordinary mud yet again.\u201cThree hundred kilometers deep.\u201d Ning was stunned. \u201cOre mines are generally spread out horizontally. If even the vertical depth is so great, how wide must the mine be?\u201dSwoosh!Following this, Ning immediately began moving upwards at high speed.A long time later\u2026He finally emerged once more, appearing on the surface of the ground. He quickly returned to the gathering spot, where Ninefire, Granny Shadow, the old servant, and Truekeep were already present.\u201cJi Ning.\u201d Ninefire looked towards Ning, his eyes lighting up. \u201cYou\u2019ve already completed your investigations?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Ning nodded. He glanced around. Traveling three hundred kilometers into the ground was far more difficult than flying thousands of kilometers in the air. Fortunately, he had been able to rely on his Waterflame Lotus, which borrowed the elemental power of the world, to move so easily. The others had to exhaust their ki in order to slowly dig.\u201cHow deep is it?\u201d Ninefire and the others all looked towards Ning.\u201cThree hundred kilometers.\u201d Ning said.The faces of Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and Truekeep changed. They couldn\u2019t be bothered to feel amazed at how Ning had, in a single short hour, made a round trip underground of more than three hundred kilometers. This was because they were already beginning to grow panicked.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ning hurriedly asked.\u201cThis elemental ore mine\u2026\u201d Ninefire said solemnly. \u201cWe\u2019ve finished our investigations as well. It has a circumference of at least four thousand kilometers! If it has a depth of three hundred kilometers\u2026then this truly is an enormous large-scale elemental ore mine. To our Ji clan, such an enormous elemental ore mine isn\u2019t a blessing; it is a calamity!\u201dA grand calamity!Ning instantly understood. A stomach of a certain size could only hold a certain amount of food; if you filled it with too much, you could die from overstuffing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis is a rich vein, and an enormous one.\u201d Ninefire said solemnly. \u201cOnce we begin to excavate it, the value of the ore within will definitely be countless times greater than the total assets of the Ji clan. Tell me, how can our Ji clan handle it?\u201dThis mine\u2026This mine had been formed after the peak Primal Daoist, \u2018Daoist Firedragon\u2019, had paid an enormous price in order to set up a large formation to collect elemental energy, so as to help himself break through. This mine had been forming for one hundred years. If it was completely mined out, the value of it would be comparable to half the assets of an ordinary Primal Daoist. Because Daoist Firedragon had broken through to the Earth Immortal level, his horizons had been expanded and he no longer cared as much. In addition, mining the elemental ore would simply be too difficult; even a Primal Daoist probably would be too lazy to go through the mining. Only, the likes of Wanxiang Adepts would go wild with excitement for something like this.\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d Granny Shadow immediately asked.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of others. I\u2019m only afraid of Snowdragon Mountain!\u201d Ninefire\u2019s face was filled with worry. \u201cThe Snowdragon Mountain of the Swallow Mountain area is just a branch clan. Behind it\u2026is the true Snowdragon Mountain Sect! A major sect which has Primal Daoists standing guard over it. And, based on my calculations and the passage of time, the Zifu Disciples of the branch sect of Snowdragon Mountain should have already arrived in the nearby area!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A thousand kilometers away from them\u2026There was a screen hovering in mid-air, and atop that screen, there were four figures, staring down below. Suddenly, a ray of light rose into the skies. It was a large, armored, muscular man who was standing atop a greatsword. This muscular man had a hint of a blue light glowing from his skin, and standing there in midair atop that greatsword, he looked like a Fiendgod.\u201cMy fellow disciples.\u201d The muscular man had a look of delight on his face. \u201cI\u2019ve finished my investigations. There is a large amount of elemental ore underground, with high quality elemental stones within the deposit. This is a very rich vein of elemental ore.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d A long-haired man who wore a black robe and had eight bloody trigrams in front and behind him nodded, then laughed. \u201cJunior apprentice-brother Ju San, thank you for your hard work. Who would have expected that an elemental ore mine such as this would have been hidden within the territory of the Ji clan? Right. Junior apprentice-brother Ju San, have you found any traces of mining?\u201dThe muscular man shook his head.The black robed man nodded in satisfaction. \u201cThe Ji clan has never sold elemental stones to outsiders. It seems that prior to this, they hadn\u2019t discovered this vein either. My fellow disciples, I\u2019d like to trouble you to go in each direction and investigate carefully exactly how large this vein is, while I will investigate how deep it is. After finishing our investigations, we\u2019ll gather here again.\u201d\u201cYes, elder apprentice-brother Ziqi.\u201d Three men and women, including the muscular man, acknowledged, then each flew away on their own flying-type magic treasures, transforming into rays of light that flew towards four different directions to investigate.The black robed man collected his flying screen while rushing towards the ground, smashing through it and burrowing deep.\u2026\u2026.A long time later.The three men and one woman who had left earlier had already returned, flying on their magic treasures.\u201cElder apprentice-brother Ziqi still hasn\u2019t finished exploring?\u201d A green-haired man said in surprise. \u201cIt seems this mine really is quite deep.\u201d\u201cBased on just what we\u2019ve learned, this elemental ore mine has to have a circumference of four thousand kilometers.\u201d A nearby woman whose hair was also emanating a green light said solemnly. \u201cIf it\u2019s deep as well\u2026then this mine is going to be an astonishing one.\u201dRight after she finished speaking.Swoosh!From below, a ray of light surged towards the heavens, then came to a halt. It was their black-robed elder apprentice-brother, Ziqi.\u201cElder apprentice-brother Ziqi.\u201d The three men and woman bowed respectfully. Actually, all five of them were Zifu Disciples and of the same generation. Logically speaking, there was no need for them to act like this. But this Ziqi\u2019s power was definitely far above theirs.\u201cWhat an elemental ore mine. It is at least three hundred kilometers deep.\u201d The black-robed man sighed in surprise.\u201cThree hundred kilometers?\u201d\u201cThat deep?\u201d\u201cThe four of us have found that this mine has a circumference of four thousand kilometers. For it to also have such an astonishing depth\u2026this elemental ore mine is simply too\u2026\u201d The three men and one woman were all in a state of shock. Some mines were fairly shallow, and it made sense for a mine of a circumference of thousands of kilometers to just a few kilometers deep. But this one was three hundred kilometers deep!The black-robed man shouted, \u201cThis elemental ore mine belongs to Snowdragon Mountain!\u201d\u201cRight, it belongs to our Snowdragon Mountain!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve rendered a major merit. The main sect will definitely reward us heavily.\u201d\u201cOur chance has come!\u201dThe five of them were all incomparably excited. They were easily able to tell the general size and scale of this elemental ore mine and knew the value of it. The value was inconceivably high! Most likely, even those Primal Daoists that stood at the very pinnacle of power in Snowdragon Mountain would care deeply about this place.\u201cElder apprentice-brother Ziqi.\u201d The green-haired woman frowned. \u201cThis place is very close to the City of Ten Thousand Swords. According to the laws of the Grand Xia Dynasty, this place should be considered as belonging to the Ji clan.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is the Ji clan?\u201d Ziqi snorted coldly. \u201cDare they intervene in Snowdragon Mountain\u2019s mine?\u201dThe nearby green-haired man nodded. \u201cNo need to worry about the Ji clan. Snowdragon Mountain is definitely taking over this elemental ore mine! But no matter what, we can\u2019t be too incautious. According to the laws of the Grand Xia Dynasty, this place is the territory of the City of Ten Thousand Swords, which means this mine belongs to the Ji clan. Our Snowdragon Mountain cannot openly violate the laws of the Grand Xia Dynasty!\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Dong Ziqi nodded lightly.True.Even if they had to skirt the laws, they definitely couldn\u2019t openly challenge the Grand Xia Dynasty! Even the Marquis Palace of Stillwater Commandery, which was almost as ancient as the Grand Xia Dynasty itself, wouldn\u2019t dare to challenge the Grand Xia Dynasty!\u201cRight now, I\u2019m only afraid of one thing.\u201d The green-haired man frowned. \u201cIf the Ji clan were to send someone to ally with the army of the Grand Xia Dynasty and sign a contract giving this site up to the Grand Xia Dynasty\u2026! If they were to directly sign over this mine to the Grand Xia Dynasty, then there would be nothing that we can do!\u201d\u201cApprentice-brother Hefang speaks reason.\u201d A cold-faced, gray-robed man nodded. \u201cWe have to be careful.\u201d\u201cWe do have to be careful.\u201d The muscular man said frantically, \u201cThe Ji clan definitely will realize that they aren\u2019t strong enough to hold this mine. If they give up the mine to the Grand Xia Dynasty, then the Ji clan will at least gain thirty percent of it! This would also result in them having the Grand Xia Dynasty supporting them. We wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything.\u201d\u201cSign an agreement?\u201dDong Ziqi\u2019s eyes were dark and gloomy. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to do!\u201dThe other four looked towards Dong Ziqi.\u201cThe garrison of the Grand Xia Dynasty in the Swallow Mountain region are in Swallow Mountain City.\u201d Dong Ziqi said. \u201cThe general of that garrison is a good friend of mine.\u201d\u201cBut elder apprentice-brother Ziqi, as soon as the Ji clan makes a report and offers to transfer the mine\u2026a mere general wouldn\u2019t dare to suppress the news. If he forcibly suppresses the report of something as major as this, and is later discovered to have done so, then the general will definitely have his soul shattered and dispersed in punishment.\u201d The green-haired man said, concerned.Ziqi said, \u201cI know that. He won\u2019t dare to forcibly suppress the news, but at least he\u2019ll be able to delay it!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d The other four looked at Ziqi as well.\u201cYou should know.\u201d Dong Ziqi said. \u201cThe first part to signing an agreement of relinquishing a mine is the report to the higher ups! Afterwards, the higher ups will immediately send people to investigate the Ji clan\u2019s territory. Only after they have verified that there is indeed such a mine within the Ji clan\u2019s territory will they sign the contract.\u201dThe other four nodded.This was indeed the case.Once the report was made, someone would immediately be sent over. The efficiency would be very high.\u201cAs soon as the report is made, we won\u2019t be able to act as we please.\u201d Ziqi said, \u201cWhat we can do is to have the garrison general at Swallow Mountain City delay as much as he can\u2026and in addition, it will take time for the person sent by the Grand Xia Dynasty to make his way over. This will be enough time for us to seize the City of Ten Thousand Swords!\u201d\u201cSeize the City of Ten Thousand Swords?\u201d The other four nodded gently.\u201cAs long as we take over the City of Ten Thousand Swords and acquire the official writ, then we will be the masters of the City of Ten Thousand Swords. In accordance with the laws of the Grand Xia Dynasty, the mine will belong to us. Even if the Grand Xia Dynasty sends someone over\u2026because the official writ has a new owner, there will be no way for the Ji clan to sign a contract.\u201d Ziqi said.\u201cFine. We\u2019ll take over the official writ!\u201d\u201cOnce the official writ is in our hands, we will be the masters of the mine.\u201d Cold light flashed in each of their eyes.Ziqi said in a low voice, \u201cIf the Ji clan dares to resist, then annihilate them!\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d The other four nodded, not worried about the Ji clan at all.\u201cElder apprentice-brother Ziqi, before this, when we were investigating the size of the mine, we discovered that the Ji clan\u2019s forces were within a thousand kilometers.\u201d The green-haired woman said.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Ziqi said as he let out a cold snort. \u201cLet\u2019s go visit the Ji clan.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026Right at this moment, in the air above the elemental ore mine, quite a few Zifu Disciples were conducting investigations, including the Ironwood clan, the Riverbank clan, the Kou clan, the Blackfire Cult\u2026they were all local forces of Swallow Mountain. Only the forces of the Grand Xia Dynasty, stationed in Swallow Mountain City, were not present.\u201cWhat a rich vein.\u201d\u201cSuch an elemental ore mine\u2026just looking at it is frightening.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..The desolate mountain forests. The Ji clan\u2019s forces were gathered there, deciding what to do.\u201cJi Ninefire!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuddenly, a gloomy voice rang out. This voice caused the faces of quite a few clansmen of the Ji clan to change. Ning\u2019s soul, being so powerful, wasn\u2019t impacted much. He raised his head to look. He saw that high above them in mid-air, an enormous screen was descending towards them at high speed. Standing atop the screen were five men and women, all of them with extraordinary auras.The leader of the group was emanating a deathly cold aura. He was dressed in black, and the front and back of his robe were covered with eight bloody trigrams.\u201cDong Ziqi!\u201d Ninefire\u2019s face changed slightly.Ning looked carefully at the five on the screen, paying special attention to their leader, Dong Ziqi. \u201cHe is Dong Ziqi, of the Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain?\u201dDong Ziqi\u2019s fame was widespread, and he was quietly acknowledged to be the number one expert of the six hegemons of the Swallow Mountain region!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16 \u2013 Crossing SwordsJi Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and the others had long ago come to view Ji Ning as the future pillar of the Ji clan! They naturally had long ago allowed Ning to view the intelligence reports the clan had regarding the various ancient monsters and Zifu Disciples of the various forces spread throughout Swallow Mountain. Ning knew very well\u2026that this Dong Ziqi was a peak Zifu Disciple, one who had come from the main sect, whose abilities were far more powerful than those available to the local tribes of the Swallow Mountain Region. Dong Ziqi\u2019s most powerful ability was the \u2018Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation\u2019!This was different from other great formations, which generally needed to be set up in advance. This \u2018Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation\u2019 was rather similar to the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]; one could activate it with a thought. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t as high level and as formidable as the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], but this was a peak Zifu Disciple. When such a man used this formation, he probably would be able to fight a new Wanxiang Adept to a standstill. This wasn\u2019t something which could be compared the likes of Bei Zishan, who had to rely on the Myriad Wraiths Banner.\u201cIt\u2019s quite rare for us to be able to see you, fellow Daoist Dong.\u201d Ninefire\u2019s attitude was very humble. \u201cFellow Daoist Dong, might I ask why you have come?\u201d\u201cJi Ninefire.\u201dThe five Zifu Disciples atop the banner landed on the ground. They swept the Ji clansmen with their gaze. Their eyes were filled with lofty arrogance; clearly, they held the Ji clan in no regard. This caused Ning and the others to feel a hint of rage in their hearts, but they understood\u2026they had to suppress it.\u201cThe land which your Ji clan controls really is a blessed area. It actually has an elemental ore mine.\u201d Ziqi\u2019s cold, sinister eyes stared at Ninefire. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the elemental energy vibrations which emanated from here two days ago, we wouldn\u2019t have had any idea. Hmph. I imagine that your Ji clan has secretly mined out quite a few elemental stones. You really are quite bold.\u201dLooks of anger couldn\u2019t help but appear in the eyes of the Ji clansmen, but Ninefire used his ki to bark at them mentally, \u201cAll of you, endure it!\u201d\u201cMy Ji clan just discovered it as well.\u201d Ninefire maintained a smiling face towards Ziqi.\u201cJust discovered it?\u201d Ziqi swept the Ji clansmen with his gaze. \u201cHave you investigated the size and scale of this elemental mine?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d Ninefire shook his head. \u201cAll we know is that this is a rich vein of elemental ore.\u201dZiqi said in a cold voice, \u201cSince you don\u2019t know, then I\u2019ll tell you. Not only is this a rich vein, it stretches to a circumference of four thousand kilometers, and is three hundred kilometers deep as well! Your tiny little Ji clan is completely unable to try and swallow such an enormous elemental ore mine; if you tried, it would choke you to death!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Ninefire laughed. \u201cIn the end, my Ji clan can just offer this elemental ore mine to the Grand Xia Dynasty. By then, our Ji clan will obtain 30% of it, while the Grand Xia Dynasty will obtain 70%. In addition, our Ji clan will also receive the protection of the Grand Xia Dynasty, at which point we won\u2019t fear anyone.\u201dZiqi\u2019s pupils contracted.These locals!Although they didn\u2019t come from any sects, and thus remained Zifu Disciples despite having trained for nearly four centuries, after having lived so long, these people had become incomparably crafty. Just now, he had been so arrogant, but Ninefire had remained all smiles. However, at the critical point in their negotiations, Ninefire had directly given voice to what Snowdragon Mountain feared the most.\u201cListen up!\u201d Dong Ziqi\u2019s voice was incomparably cold. \u201cThis elemental ore mine is being taken over by Snowdragon Mountain! Don\u2019t threaten me. If you threaten me\u2026the only result will be the destruction of the Ji clan!\u201dNinefire\u2019s face changed.The others, such as Granny Shadow, were all both angry and agitated when they heard this. Ning felt a smoldering rage burn in his heart as well. Clearly, according to the laws of the Grand Xia Dynasty, this elemental ore mine belonged to the Ji clan! But Snowdragon Mountain\u2019s people wanted to just take it from them, and in such a domineering manner?\u201cFellow Daoist Dong.\u201d Ninefire suppressed his rage.Just now, he had just decided to bring out the strongest \u2018threat\u2019 he could must\u2026so as to cause the opponents to feel nervous, and then engage in negotiations. He didn\u2019t expect that these people didn\u2019t want to negotiate at all; they acted with completely tyranny, wanting to take advantage of the Ji clan in their weakness!\u201cThis is Swallow Mountain.\u201d Ninefire said solemnly. \u201cThe main Snowdragon Mountain Sect is millions of kilometers away, but once my Ji clan makes the report, in just a few days, the Celestial Envoy of the Grand Xia Dynasty will arrive. By then, we will just directly sign a transfer agreement. Actually, our Ji clan doesn\u2019t have that much ambition; the only thing we desire is to survive!\u201d\u201cSurvive?\u201d Ziqi laughed coldly. \u201cAt least you know your own limits!\u201dNinefire said, \u201cSnowdragon Mountain can arrange for people to mine this quarry. Our Ji clan definitely will not disturb you during the mining process. After you have completed your mining\u2026all we ask is that you remove all of your forces from the Ji clan\u2019s territory. As for the ore in this elemental ore mine, my Ji clan will not ask for a single stone of it! My Ji clan is willing to set up an Oath of Heavenly Law with your Snowdragon Mountain!\u201dOath of Heavenly Law\u2026This was useless for ordinary mortals, but no one who had stepped onto the path of Immortal cultivation would dare to violate an Oath of Heavenly Law.\u201cOh?\u201d Ziqi hesitated.\u201cElder apprentice-brother Ziqi.\u201d The nearby muscular man sent mentally through his Ki. \u201cThese conditions aren\u2019t bad. We don\u2019t care about the territory the Ji clan controls anyhow. What really matters is that elemental ore mine. Since the Ji clan is willing to allow us to harvest all of the ore within the elemental ore mine\u2026if they are willing to set up an Oath of Heavenly Law, then they won\u2019t dare violate it.\u201d\u201cIdiot.\u201d The green-haired woman to the side sent mentally as well. \u201cThis is just a delaying tactic of the Ji clan! The Ji clan is going to set up an Oath of Heavenly Law with \u2018us\u2019, but not with those of us here. Even if we fellow disciples swear to an Oath of Heavenly Law, the high level members of the main sect can still decide to just cast us aside and exterminate the Ji clan. They definitely want us to have a high-level member of the main sect to come here and swear the oath. But we would first need to send work back, and by the time the high-level member of the main sect comes\u2026more than enough time will have passed for the Ji clan and the Grand Xia Dynasty to have signed an agreement.\u201d\u201cYounger apprentice-sister, your words have merit.\u201d The gray-robed man sent mentally as well.Dong Ziqi nodded slightly.The Ji clansmen were still awaiting their response.\u201cYour Ji clan wishes to swear an Oath of Heavenly Law with Snowdragon Mountain\u2026might I ask, which member of Snowdragon Mountain do you wish to come swear the oath with you?\u201d Ziqi looked at Ninefire.Ninefire laughed. \u201cAny Wanxiang Adept is acceptable. The fate of our Ji clan rests on this agreement; naturally, we must be cautious. The weight of an oath of a Zifu Disciple of Snowdragon Mountain isn\u2019t quite enough\u2026and we don\u2019t dare trust fully in it either. I imagine that you, fellow Daoist Dong, also understand that the oath of a Zifu Disciple doesn\u2019t have much binding power over the main Snowdragon Mountain Sect.\u201dDong Ziqi narrowed his eyes.A single Zifu Disciple? The main sect could sacrifice one with but a word.But a Wanxiang Adept was different. The main sect only had a limited number of them, and when they swore an oath, it represented the main sect swearing an oath! If the main sect dared to sacrifice even a Wanxiang Adept, wouldn\u2019t it cause the other Wanxiang Adepts and Zifu Disciples to have an icy feeling in their hearts? To cause the Wanxiang Adepts of the clan to all have lessened loyalty, for the sake of an elemental ore mine, wasn\u2019t worth it. Thus, it was most appropriate for a Wanxiang Adept to come and swear the oath.\u201cJi Ninefire!\u201d Ziqi said in a freezing voice. \u201cYou want a Wanxiang Adept to come and swear an Oath of Heavenly Law with you? They are high level members of my main sect, which is over a million kilometers away! After we send the message, it will take at least ten days or half a month for a Wanxiang Adept to come! Within ten day\u2019s time, your Ji clan would most likely have secretly signed an agreement with the Grand Xia Dynasty long ago!\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Ninefire hesitated.\u201cAs I see it, you had best hand over the official writ!\u201d Ziqi shouted. \u201cHand over the official writ for the City of Ten Thousand Swords to us! Snowdragon Mountain will continue to permit you to live within the City of Ten Thousand Swords, and everything will remain unchanged for the Ji clan\u2026after we have completely excavated the elemental ore mine, we will return the official writ to you!\u201dNinefire was frantic. \u201cHow can that be acceptable?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d Granny Shadow said angrily as well. \u201cThe official writ is the very foundation of the Ji clan.\u201dNing just watched.These people of Snowdragon Mountain\u2026you gave them an inch, and they attempted to take a mile! They made it sound so nice and simple; they would return the official writ after finishing the excavation? What if they didn\u2019t? In addition, the Ji clan had already made a huge concession in being willing to offer the entire mine to Snowdragon Mountain. How could it be that Snowdragon Mountain now desired to take away the official writ as well, and \u2018give it back\u2019 in the future?\u201cHmph.\u201d Ning\u2019s face was ugly to behold, and the same was true for the other members of the Ji clan.\u201cDo you think that our Snowdragon Mountain clan will lie to a petty little clan like the Ji clan?\u201d Ziqi shouted.\u201cIt seems as though Snowdragon Mountain has taken advantage of quite a few clans.\u201d Ninefire was enraged as well. \u201cOtherwise, why would a branch of Snowdragon Mountain have come to Swallow Mountain!\u201dZiqi\u2019s face changed.Outrageous!Ninefire actually had become harder and more forceful! Zifi swept the Ji clansmen with his gaze, noticing that youngest, solitary figure, the fur-clad youth. He immediately sent through his Ki, \u201cJunior apprentice-brother Muse, the Ji clan only has a few Zifu Disciples. The one with the most potential is this Ji Ning; he is the one who, according to the stories, killed Zishan.\u201d\u201cJi Ning.\u201d The gray-robed man noticed the fur-clad youth in front of them as well.That battle he had with Bei Zishan that year\u2026Ning\u2019s reputation had been spread throughout the various forces of Swallow Mountain long ago. After all, at that time, quite a few Xiantian lifeforms of the various clans had all been sent back to their own clans, causing them to become aware of how terrifying Ji Ning was, and that Ji Ning should be a Zifu Disciple! A Zifu Disciple at age eleven or twelve\u2026how terrifying would he be in the future? The various powers had taken notice of Ning long ago, and the intelligence reports regarding Ning were thus incomparably detailed.Everything which had happened to him since he was young, as well as his appearance and his habits\u2026they had all been collected and compiled.Dong Ziqi didn\u2019t care about anyone else in the entire Ji clan; the only one he cared about was this Ji Ning! He didn\u2019t fear the current Ji Ning; what he feared was the future Ji Ning! Given Ji Ning\u2019s talent\u2026in the future, it probably wouldn\u2019t be too hard for him to become a Wanxiang Adept.\u201cJunior apprentice-brother Muse, the member of the Ji clan with the most potential and who poses the greatest threat is this Ji Ning. The entire Ji clan treats him as their treasure.\u201d Ziqi sent mentally. \u201cHe is still fairly young, however, and at present, he shouldn\u2019t be too powerful. Zishan, that fool\u2026aside from being able to forge that Myriad Wraiths Banner, which was fairly powerful, his own level of ability wasn\u2019t that great. In addition, the results of that battle probably had something to do with that Wanxiang Adept. Ji Ning\u2019s own level of power is most likely not that great.\u201d\u201cJunior apprentice-brother, make a sudden attack and capture Ji Ning! By then, with Ji Ning in our hands, do you think the Ji clan will dare to disobey the orders of our Snowdragon Mountain?\u201d Ziqi sent mentally. \u201cEven in the extremely unlikely circumstance that they don\u2019t care about Ji Ning\u2019s life, we will then simply kill Ji Ning. Without him, the Ji clan won\u2019t pose a threat to us at all in the future.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d The gray-robed man nodded.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing was indeed a threat to them. Nobody feared Ning right now, but they feared the future Ning.\u201cJunior apprentice-brother, if you suddenly use your magic technique to attack, even I will have some trouble fending it off. You shouldn\u2019t have any problems in subduing Ji Ning.\u201d Ziqi sent mentally. Although his power was greater than that of Muse\u2019s, he had to first activate his Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. By the time he did so, the Ji clan would probably be at maximum vigilance.Thus, they had to make a sudden attack, and succeed in an instant! For this, Muse was the best choice.\u201cLeave it to me. I made a breakthrough in this technique of mine not long ago.\u201d Muse sent back mentally with great confidence.\u201cThen we\u2019ll just wait for you. Once you take down Ji Ning\u2026we will have the upper hand.\u201d Ziqi said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Rain Line!At a single glance, Dong Ziqi saw clearly the Ji clan\u2019s weakness. His thoughts were completely correct; Ji Ning was indeed the future pillar of the Ji clan! In this group of Ji clan experts\u2026even if Ji Ninefire and Granny Shadow had to die, they wouldn\u2019t let Ning die!\u201cNinefire, I urge you to obediently hand over the official writ.\u201d Ziqi frowned as he shouted.\u201cMy Ji clan is indeed weak and small, which is why we are willing to offer this elemental ore mine to you without requesting any part of it. But for you to try and forcibly take over our official writ\u2026you are perhaps going too far! The official writ is the foundation of the Ji clan. How can my Ji clan\u2026\u201d Ninefire\u2019s face changed halfway through his words, and he couldn\u2019t help but lower his head to look at the ground.The ground was trembling slightly.Dong Ziqi\u2019s group of five stood in the distance, and in their midst, the gray-robed man\u2019s eyes flashed. The ki in his body had long ago entered the ground. By the time the Ji clan\u2019s Zifu Disciples sensed it, the technique had already been executed!\u201cBOOM!\u201dStrands of green, wooden vines emerged suddenly from the ground, all of them flailing about wildly, covered with a layer of deep green light. The thin, slender strands of vines twined about each other like a tough cord rope. They suddenly emerged from the ground beneath Ning\u2019s feet, instantly wrapping themselves around Ning!Fast!Completely caught off-guard!\u201cWhat!\u201d The faces of Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and the others changed. In the blink of an eye, Ji Ning, who had been standing next to them just moments ago, had been wildly entangled by those countless rattan vines.\u201cQuick, save Ji Ning!\u201d Granny Shadow shouted.\u201cToo late!\u201d Dong Ziqi, standing in the distance, just laughed loudly as he spoke.Bang!The countless vines wrapped around Ning whipped out violently, throwing him towards the ground. With a rumble, an enormous crevice appeared within the ground, with Ning and those vines already burrowed deep within the ground.\u201cSnowdragon Mountain, you actually\u2026\u201d Ninefire\u2019s face was savage.\u201cRelease my son.\u201d Ji Yichuan was frantic as well.Every member of the Ji clan wanted to save Ning, but the sudden emergence of those vines, which had wrapped around Ning and then thrown him underground, caused them to not know what they should do to save him.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Dong Ziqi just laughed wildly as he turned to look at the gray-robed man. \u201cJunior apprentice-brother Muse, bring Ji Ning over here\u2026\u201d Dong Ziqi\u2019s face suddenly changed, because he saw that his fellow disciple\u2019s forehead was matted with sweat. Clearly, he was already going all out in this struggle.\u201cThat Ji Ning is currently breaking through my technique\u2026\u201d The gray-robed man\u2019s eyes had turned red, and he was pouring all of his ki into the technique.\u2026\u2026.Underground.A seed had grown into thousands of wooden green tendrils, which were now heavily entangling themselves around Ning. Within the entangling clutches of the vines, a Waterflame Lotus was surrounding Ning, constantly swiveling around him and frantically resisting these tendrils, unceasingly killing them one by one while the dead vines were unceasingly being reborn.\u201cImmortal practitioners truly have many techniques at their disposal. This technique wasn\u2019t included in our intelligence reports. I wonder which branch member of Snowdragon Mountain used it.\u201d Ning had suddenly suffered an attack, and this attack was too fast, giving him no time to break through before he had been thrown underground.Due to the constriction of the tendrils, the amount of space Ning had to move in was too limited, giving him no chance to use the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] at all.Thus, the first thing Ning had done was to execute the Waterflame Lotus.\u201cSwivel, swivel\u2026\u201d The Waterflame Lotus slowly swiveled, grinding those thin vines that wanted to entangle Ning into dust. Nearly five years had passed since that battle with Bei Zishan, and during these five years, Ning\u2019s improvements with regards to his understanding of the Dao had only grown greater and greater.If early on, the insight he had gained with regards to the Dao was just a thread, over the course of time, he had gained more threads of the True Meaning of the Dao.These many thin threads\u2026had drawn close to each other, naturally resulting in a thicker thread.Ning\u2019s time spent at Serpentwing Lake in particular, where he was virtually always in tune with the world\u2026had resulted in him reaching a very high level of understanding. Actually, this was something which could only be accomplished by an Immortal practitioner who had reached a very high level of understanding. When one could always be in tune with nature and always be able to go attune with the Dao, it was only natural that one would gain many insights into the True Meaning of the Dao.His level of understanding had risen.Thus, the power his Waterflame Lotus now had was naturally much greater than before. That murderous grinding power alone would most likely instantly grind even peak Xiantian experts into tiny pieces in but an instant.\u201cDarknorth sword.\u201d Within the Waterflame Lotus, Ning drew forth a Darknorth sword.\u201cLonging! Rain Line!\u201dNing murmured softly to himself.Each time he used this technique, he couldn\u2019t help but think of his mother. This technique was one which he had developed thanks to the boundless longing he felt for his mother! It was the longing each drop of rain held for each other drop which allowed them to form a line of rain\u2026the insights Ning had gained over the past five years into the Dao had resulted in him developing many techniques, but this was the most powerful of them all.This technique contained within it a boundless, powerful longing. It was born from the [Raindrop Sutra], but it had left the Raindrop Sutra far behind.\u201cSwish\u2026.\u201dNing simultaneously struck out with two Darknorth swords at the same time, piercing past the Waterflame Lotus, which seemed to be like a shadow, not obstructing Ning\u2019s swords in the slightest. Ning\u2019s swords seemed to be like the caress of a mother, carrying boundless longing within them\u2026as they summoned a large amount of natural power which directly coalesced atop the two swords.Anyone seeing this technique would unconsciously feel a sour feeling in their hearts, sense a powerful, endless yearning.\u201cCrackle\u2026\u201d Many vines were instantly shattered. Although they were very tough, they were still chopped apart. In the face of Ning\u2019s most powerful close-combat sword technique, the technique of Zifu Disciple Muse was unable to contain Ning.Actually, the first reason for this was that Ning\u2019s swordplay had already far outstripped that of most Zifu Disciples. Most likely, even many Wanxiang Adepts wouldn\u2019t be on par with him in this regard.The second reason was that Ning\u2019s Fiendgod body was simply too powerful, comparable to an early-stage Fiendgod Zifu Disciple. His strength was so mighty, and his swordplay was so formidable; how hard must it be for a technique to contain him!Sword light flashed and danced, shattering a large number of frantically twisting vines. Ning followed his sword light and rose into the sky, breaking through the earth and arriving on the surface of the ground.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cBang!\u201dJust as the Ji clansmen were worriedly looking at the ground, into the hole from whence the rattan vines had disappeared, suddenly, hundreds of meters away, the ground suddenly exploded as a ray of sword light soared into the sky. A fur-clad youth, wielding a pair of swords, his body surrounded by a Fire-water Lotus, suddenly drifted up, then landed on the ground.\u201cHow is that possible!\u201d Dong Ziqi\u2019s face changed dramatically. Others might not understand this technique of his junior apprentice-brother\u2019s, but he understood it very well. A sudden attack from this technique\u2026it would be very difficult for someone to break through it. Even if one succeeded, it would only come at great effort.\u201cThat Ji Ning broke through?\u201d The muscular man behind Ziqi stared as he growled, \u201cHow is that possible. I\u2019m a Fiendgod practitioner, but even I wouldn\u2019t be able to break through if senior apprentice-brother Muse captured me.\u201dJunior apprentice Ju San was the newest Zifu Disciple of the five, who had only recently established his Violet Palace.He was just an early Zifu Disciple, but he was a Fiendgod practitioner! As an early Fiendgod practitioner\u2026his battle strength was also amazing. It didn\u2019t matter if others injured him, but if he landed a hit on someone else, that person would die! This was the advantage which Fiendgod practitioners had; if he trained to become a late stage Fiendgod Zifu Disciple, even Dong Ziqi would address him as \u2018senior apprentice-brother\u2019.\u201cHe broke through?\u201d\u201cHow old is he?\u201d\u201cSenior apprentice-brother Muse\u2019s \u2018Myriad Ancient Green Vines\u2019 technique\u2026was broken, just like that?\u201d That green-haired male-female pair stared as well, their faces filled with disbelief.In their group, Muse\u2019s status was second only to Ziqi, precisely because of how powerful he was! In particular, his ambushing abilities with the \u2018Myriad Ancient Green Vines\u2019 had caused the other fellow disciples to feel endless admiration for him. The restricting power of those green vines was indeed tremendous. How physically strong was a Fiendgod Zifu Disciple? And yet, even such a person was unable to break through.But the person who had broken through it\u2026was only sixteen years old! No matter how monstrous of a genius he was, it was too\u2026But how could they know that Ning\u2019s physical strength was comparable to their junior apprentice-brother Ju San to begin with. In terms of his level of attainment in the sword, he vastly outstripped Ju San by many levels!\u2026\u2026.\u201cJi Ning.\u201d\u201cJi Ning.\u201d Ji Ninefire, Ji Truekeep, Granny Shadow, and the other members of the Ji clan all stared at Ning with surprise and delight. At the same time, they felt unbearably pleased at the looks of shock and amazement on the faces of the five Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain! Simultaneously, the Ji clansmen couldn\u2019t help but feel stunned at Ning\u2019s power. Ninefire\u2019s eyes actually narrowed as he sighed in his heart that he felt he was growing more and more mystified by this kid.The Waterflame Lotus surrounding Ning vanished, and he walked over.\u201cJi Ning!\u201d A hoarse voice rang out.Ning turned to look.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFrom afar, there was a gray-robed man with an ashen, pallid face who stood by Dong Ziqi\u2019s side. The man was staring fixedly at Ning. \u201cYou\u2026what\u2019s the name of that sword technique of yours?\u201d\u201cLonging.\u201d Ning said softly. \u201cRain Line!\u201d\u201cRain Line?\u201d The gray-robed man stared wide-eyed in disbelief. \u201cThe power of the Rain Line technique of your Ji clan\u2019s [Raindrop Sutra] is this great?\u201d He was quite familiar with the nine sword stances of the [Raindrop Sutra].\u201d\u201cThere are quite a few things that you don\u2019t know.\u201d Ning snorted coldly, no longer explaining.This sword technique was birthed from the Raindrop Sutra, but it was no longer the same as the Rain Line technique of the past.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The four Zifu Disciples behind him were still in a state of shock.\u201cThis Ji Ning is even more powerful than anticipated.\u201d Ziqi pondered. \u201cHe\u2019s only sixteen years old, but even junior apprentice-brother Muse is unable to take him down! Most likely, only I will be capable of killing him.\u201d If he were to personally attack, he would have to use his Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. Once the formation appeared, then the two sides would fight to the death, and there would be no chance to salvage the situation.Dong Ziqi was very self-confident, but he also understood that the Ji clan\u2019s power wasn\u2019t weak either. If they were really to fight against each other, his side would lose one or two of their five Zifu Disciples.If he could let the other side retreat in the face of encroaching difficulties, that would be for the best.\u201cJi Ning, formidable.\u201d\u201cWell done.\u201dThe Ji clansmen all looked towards Ning. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Ji Yichuan looked at his son. Seeing that his son was unwounded, he relaxed.\u201cDong Ziqi!\u201d Granny Shadow said in a fierce voice. \u201cWhat was the meaning of this? You suddenly attacked a member of our Ji clan! All of us are present, and yet you still dare to behave so rashly.\u201d\u201cYour Snowdragon Mountain clansmen are too wild and unbridled.\u201dThe Ji clansmen were all very angry, but they still forced themselves not to attack. The opponents, after all, belonged to Snowdragon Mountain.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Dong Ziqi just laughed. \u201cSudden attack? That\u2019s a nasty way to put it. My junior apprentice-brother simply heard long ago that your Ji clan produced a genius with exceptional talents, and that even junior apprentice-brother Bei Zishan of our Snowdragon Mountain died in his hands. Today, when we saw this genius, he couldn\u2019t help but feel his hands itch and want to have a little spar. What, can it be that a Zifu Disciple of our Snowdragon Mountain is forbidden from sparring with a member of your Ji clan?\u201d\u201cYou call that a spar?\u201d Granny Shadow said in a fierce, hoarse voice.\u201cNaturally.\u201d Ziqi said. \u201cAnd now, it seems that this genius of your Ji clan is indeed formidable. He was able to break through the technique of my junior apprentice-brother. Admirable, admirable.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Granny Shadow felt a fiery rage build in her belly. She had lived for nearly four centuries, but had never been angered like this before. If she didn\u2019t have other things holding her back, she would\u2019ve attacked long ago, but for the sake of the rest of the Ji clan, she had to endure it.A savage look flashed past Ziqi\u2019s eyes, and he snorted coldly. \u201cForget about sparring; even if we really killed that Ji Ning, what would your Ji clan do about it?\u201d Dong Ziqi\u2019s cold, sinister eyes swept past this group of Ji clansmen, and a disdainful smile was playing at the corner of his lips, causing the Ji clansmen to feel all the more enraged.Swollen with arrogance!What Ziqi was doing was being swollen with arrogance, with the intention of completely suppressing the Ji clansmen!\u201cPatriarch.\u201d Truekeep was truly enraged now, and he shouted, \u201cOur Ji clan cannot let ourselves be so easily abused as this. I\u2019d rather live and stand fighting rather than die kneeling. Our Ji clan has made one concession after another, but Snowdragon Mountain just continues to advance and pressure us further. Do they really take our Ji clan to be made out of mud, for them to mold as they please? Let\u2019s go all out against them! Five of them came today. We are definitely going to make sure at least half of them die!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go all out.\u201d\u201cPatriarch, let\u2019s go all out.\u201d\u201cThey refuse to give our Ji clan a way out. We won\u2019t let them live either.\u201d Immediately, quite a few Ji clansmen egan to bellow with rage.This caused Dong Ziqi and his group of five to be slightly startled. Snowdragon Mountain was indeed mighty, but that was thanks to the main sect! The Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain, by itself, was more powerful than the Ji clan, true, but only to a certain point\u2026after all, everyone only had access to Zifu Disciple level fighters at most. If they really went all out, even if Snowdragon Mountain eradicated the Ji clan, the losses to the Swallow Mountain branch would still be heavy.\u201cShut your mouths.\u201d Ninefire turned and shouted mentally through his Ki, his voice reverberating within the ears of each member of the clan.The clansmen all looked towards Ji Ninefire.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cWhat are they discussing?\u201d That muscular young man, Ju San, asked the other members of Snowdragon Mountain mentally.\u201cThese local bumpkins.\u201d The gray-robed Muse sent back. \u201cThey are used to life in the tribes, where they would rather break than bend. If you force them too far, they\u2019ll go all out\u2026we gave them a bit too much pressure, and so they are beginning to fight back.\u201dDong Ziqi sent back confidently, \u201cNo need to worry. Ninefire is an old fellow who has lived for nearly four centuries. He is quite sly. He will remonstrate with and hold back those other clansmen.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.The Ji clansmen were secretly speaking mentally to each other.\u201cSnowdragon Mountain has gone too far, true.\u201d Ninefire sent mentally. \u201cBut no matter how arrogant they behave, we have to endure it. Or are we really going to fight against them?\u201d\u201cBut Patriarch, we can sign a transfer agreement with the Grand Xia Dynasty. By then, we would have the protection of the Grand Xia Dynasty, and we would even receive thirty percent of this elemental ore mine.\u201d A muscular member of the Ji clan sent mentally.\u201cFool!\u201d Ninefire sent back. \u201cTo sign a transfer agreement with the Grand Xia Dynasty, we must first make a report, at which point an Celestial Envoy of the Grand Xia Dynasty would come to inspect this elemental ore mine. Only at the very end would a transfer agreement be signed! This process takes time. During the course of such a long period of time, our Ji clan would most likely suffer the risk of annihilation!\u201d\u201cFor the sake of thirty percent of an elemental ore mine, cause the entire clan to fall into the risk of annihilation?\u201d Ninefire shouted. \u201cFoolishness, utter foolishness! And even if we truly do succeed in signing a transfer agreement, resulting in the Grand Xia Dynasty protecting our Ji clan for a thousand years\u2026what about after that thousand years? By then, Snowdragon Mountain would come to take revenge on our Ji clan, and our clan would still end up doomed. That\u2019s why I would rather give this entire elemental ore mine to Snowdragon Mountain.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is too infuriating.\u201d\u201cToo\u2026\u201dThe hearts of every Ji clansman burned with rage.\u201cNo matter how angry and unwilling to accept it we might feel, for the sake of the Ji clan, we have to endure it all.\u201d Ninefire sighed mentally to them. \u201cAs long as the Ji clan can continue to exist and prosper, so what if we have to suffer some mistreatment?\u201d\u201cIf you have to blame someone, then blame us for not being strong enough. This clearly is a stroke of luck bestowed upon us by the heavens, but we are unable to accept and make use of this elemental ore mine.\u201d Ninefire looked towards Ning. \u201cJi Ning, you are the most incredible talent which our Ji clan has ever produced, since the founding of the clan. If you continue developing, even becoming a Wanxiang Adept is virtually guaranteed.\u201dAll of the clansmen looked towards Ning, their eyes filled with hope and longing.Right.The hopes of the Ji clan\u2019s future rise to prominence rested on him! These Xiantian lifeforms of the Central Prefecture previously had held some doubts regarding Ning\u2019s power, as prior to this, they had only heard rumors about him\u2026but now, they had personally witnessed Ning reveal some of his power. He had even broken through the technique of a powerful Zifu Disciple expert of Snowdragon Mountain. Ning was only sixteen years old! When they thought of Ning\u2019s potential, all of them were excited.\u201cHowever, no matter how great a genius someone is, once he\u2019s dead, he\u2019s no longer a genius.\u201d Ninefire looked at Ning. \u201cFor the sake of our Ji clan, you must survive and live a long life.\u201dNing nodded gently.He thought of a person\u2026the fourth master of the Aquatic Manor. Rampart. The man who, despite the presence of so many competitors, had successfully become the personal disciple of Immortal Juhua. There was no need to say anything about his talent\u2026but he had died as a Wanxiang Adept.\u201cWe members of the Ji clan will firmly remember the insults we have borne today.\u201d Ninefire looked at every member of the clan. \u201cWe have to grow strong. After we grow strong, others will not dare to insult us, look down on us.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d The clansmen all nodded, and Ning nodded as well.\u2026..Dong Ziqi and his group of five Zifu Disciples just watched to the side. Watched as the group of Ji clansmen all forcibly restrained and swallowed the anger. Seeing the looks on their faces, they couldn\u2019t help but snicker. This was something they had seen too many times. In the past, when they had acted on orders from the main sect, those minor tribes and clans had all been forced to bend their waists and lower their heads in the face of Snowdragon Mountain.\u201cDong Ziqi.\u201d Ninefire turned his head to look towards Ziqi and the others.\u201cFinished chatting?\u201d Ziqi looked at Ninefire. \u201cBut Ninefire, let me tell you clearly that no matter what, you must hand over the official writ for the City of Ten Thousand Swords! If you don\u2019t hand it over, then the destruction of your Ji clan will be impending!\u201dThe members of the Ji clan were barely able to restrain their rage, which was now painted upon their faces.They \u2018had\u2019 to hand over the official writ?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWasn\u2019t this the same as forcing their Ji clan to give up their territory?Ninefire clenched his teeth, his face ugly to behold. One word at a time, he ground out, \u201cMy Ji clan can give up the official writ and leave this land! This land will all belong to Snowdragon Mountain.\u201d\u201cWhat.\u201dEveryone was stunned. Ning stared at the Patriarch in shock as well.Ninefire continued to speak, grinding each word out. \u201cBut your Snowdragon Mountain must give our Ji clan an official writ as well, to give our Ji clan a place to resist! We\u2019ll use the official writ for our City of Ten Thousand Swords in exchange for another official writ of a large commandery city of the Grand Xia Dynasty. Our Ji clan is willing to leave our homeland and depart.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wasn\u2019t willing. He truly wasn\u2019t willing. But he saw that all the members of the clan around him, including his father, Ji Truekeep, Granny Shadow, and the others were all silent. As long as the Ji clan could continue to survive and prosper, then they would be willing to endure even departing from their homeland!\u201cAs long as Snowdragon Mountain will hand over an official writ.\u201d Ninefire said in a low voice. \u201cThen our Ji clan will immediately hand over the official writ for the City of Ten Thousand Swords!\u201d\u201cOfficial writ?\u201dIn the distance, Dong Ziqi and the other five looked at each other, quietly discussing this amongst each other.\u201cSenior apprentice-brother Ziqi, what should we do?\u201d The green-haired woman sent mentally. \u201cHand over an official writ?\u201d\u201cHand over?\u201d Ziqi looked at the green-haired woman. \u201cJunior apprentice-sister He Xing, will you hand over one?\u201dThe green-haired woman immediately shut her mouth.These Zifu Disciples who had left the main sect and independently set up branches were all those who didn\u2019t have much potential, and could be considered outer members of the sect. The commandery cities of the Grand Xia Dynasty they had taken over in the Swallow Mountain region was their foundation as well! It was also the foundation of many of their tribes, and their forces had coalesced there long ago. How could they give them up?Hand over an official writ?Who would hand it over?The elemental ore mine would be given to the main Snowdragon Mountain Sect. Why should we sacrifice? Why should our tribes sacrifice? Every single commandery city had three Zifu Disciples. They had to all agree before the official writ would be relinquished! But who would be willing to relinquish a base they had built up over so many years?\u201cWe aren\u2019t willing to give ours up, but can it be that our fellow disciples in other areas would be willing to hand over a commandery city of theirs?\u201d Ziqi shook his head. \u201cOur Snowdragon Mountain has many branches, and those fellow disciples of those branches won\u2019t care about us at all. How could they be so kind-hearted as to relinquish a commandery city for us?\u201d\u201cAt least, it\u2019s impossible for our Ju clan. I don\u2019t agree, and my uncle in the clan won\u2019t agree either.\u201d The muscular man said hurriedly. \u201cForget it. I refuse to believe the Ji clan will really dare to resist.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dThe green-haired man nodded. \u201cForce the Ji clan! If they resist, we will exterminate their clan! If they obey us, they will still be able to stay alive! I trust the Ji clan knows what they should do.\u201d\u201cRight. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve done this.\u201d The muscular man, Ju San, nodded as well.\u201cThen that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d The gray-robed Muse nodded as well.Dong Ziqi looked at his four fellow disciples. Although not every member of the Swallow Mountain branch had come, since after all they couldn\u2019t possibly summon everyone just for the sake of an elemental ore mine, these five represented all of the various internal factions of the Swallow Mountain branch.\u201cFine.\u201d Ziqi nodded. \u201cThen that\u2019s what we will do. Just as junior apprentice-brother Ju San said, this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve done this.\u201dSnowdragon Mountain had many branches.With so many branches, how could they take over enough commandery cities? Fighting for each one?That was lunacy.They could simply use the butcher\u2019s blade and their fame to frighten others simultaneously. In truth, the vast majority of tribes would, in the end, grit their teeth and swallow their rage, voluntarily relinquishing their official writs and obediently leaving. But of course, some battles would occasionally occur, as there were no absolutes. Dong Ziqi, however, was confident that his side\u2019s power was definitely superior to that of the Ji clan\u2019s.\u2026\u2026..The Ji clan was waiting.Although they felt heartache and unwillingness, Ning and everyone else had begun to mentally prepare for leaving their homeland. As long as the Ji clan was able to continue to survive, it would all be worth it. The Ji clan was waiting for Snowdragon mountain\u2019s response.\u201cRight.\u201d Ziqi let out a light snort. \u201cJi Ninefire.\u201dEvery Ji clansmen looked towards Ziqi, while Ninefire said hurriedly, \u201cThis is the final, bottom line of the Ji clan.\u201d\u201cBottom line?\u201d Ziqi laughed coldly. \u201cBottom lines are meant to be broken! Ji Ninefire, you want to trade the official writ for the City of Ten Thousand Swords for another official writ? You really are dreaming. Right now, I\u2019ll give you two options. The first option is that you defy my Snowdragon Mountain, and your Ji clan wait for annihilation. The second option is that you hand over the official writ to the City of Ten Thousand Swords. Our Snowdragon Mountain sect will permit your Ji clan to continue to live in this area. After the elemental ore mine has been fully excavated, we will return the official writ to the City of Ten Thousand Swords to you. This is the promise of myself, Dong Ziqi!\u201dThe faces of every member of the Ji clan changed.What?Promise?What a dogshit promise! What was a promise worth? Just by a saying a few empty words, he was demanding that the Ji clan hand over their official writ?\u201cZiqi.\u201d Ninefire was both furious and frantic.\u201cShut your mouth.\u201d Ziqi snapped in a fierce voice, his cold, sinister eyes staring at Ninefire. \u201cYou only need to choose\u2026to continue surviving, or to be annihilated! This is the decision for you to make, Ji Ninefire! If you choose the annihilation of your clan\u2026well, it has been a long time since my Eight Trigrams Dragon Blood Formation has truly drawn blood.\u201dThe other four Zifu Disciples by his side all had savage looks flashing in their eyes. They were born in the main sect, and had each learned some powerful techniques. Their abilities were quite a bit superior to the abilities of ordinary, local experts. If they truly were to fight all out\u2026there were three more Zifu Disciples in their headquarters. In total, they had eight Zifu Disciples!\u201d\u201cChoose!\u201d Dong Ziqi said coldly.On the Ji clan\u2019s side, some people were so angry that they were trembling.\u201cPatriarch!\u201d Some clansmen called out loudly.\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d Ninefire raised his head, howling heroically. \u201cI, Ji Ninefire, am ashamed to meet the ancestors of the Ji clan!\u201dNing ground his teeth, his entire body trembling.As for the distant Dong Ziqi and the other four, they watched this with cold smiles on their faces. The decision to give up an ancestral homeland would indeed cause someone to feel ashamed to meet one\u2019s ancestors. But would these local bumpkins dare to resist? Resistance meant death!\u201cDie!\u201d Ninefire suddenly threw out six black spheres, which transformed into six rays of light, flying directly before Dong Ziqi\u2019s group of five.\u201cThunderflame Pearls!\u201dDong Ziqi and the other four were greatly startled. As they came from the main sect, they immediately recognized these very common and extremely vicious and sinister Thunderflame Pearls. They contained the power of lightning and fire, and held extremely explosive force. Once ki caused them to explode\u2026they would immediately detonate, and the power of the explosions would be very shocking. The sudden explosion of six Thunderflame Pearls at a close distance could cause even Zifu Disciples to die.\u201cThese local bumpkin clans really do have some treasures. They are actually able to throw out six Thunderflame Pearls at one go.\u201d Even as Ziqi was frantically dodging, this thought drifted into his mind.The five Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain quickly separated into separate directions.Boom\u2026Powerful explosions of thunder and flame burst forth, and dazzling serpents of electricity blasted out in every direction, while flames began to burn the entire area, causing the entire world to shake. The power was indeed astonishingly fierce.\u201cArise!\u201d A look of utter savagery was in the eyes of Ninefire, who had just thrown out those six Thunderflame Pearls.Swooosh\u2026Suddenly, the desolate mountain wilderness in the nearby area was surrounded by mist and fog. Mist and fog appeared everywhere, and even Ning was only able to see to a distance of ten meters with the naked eye.\u201cNot good.\u201d Dong Ziqi, who had just dodged the last attack and was feeling rather smug and disdainful, saw the mist which had appeared out of nowhere. His face instantly changed. \u201cA bewildering formation!\u201d\u201cThat sly old fellow threw out those six Thunderflame Pearls not for the purpose of killing us, but to make sure that the five of us would all put some distance between us.\u201d Ziqi\u2019s face completely changed. He stared at the thick mist around him. He could only see to a distance of six meters with the naked eye. Previously, upon encountering the Thunderflame Pearls, they had all dodged at full strength, trying to move as far away as they could.Thus, those fellow disciples had all put tens of meters of distance between each other. As long as they were more than fifteen meters away from each other, within this bewildering formation, they would be affected by the master of the formation, resulting in them moving further and further away from each other.\u201cThis Ji Ninefire is planning to completely separate the five of us.\u201d Ziqi was both frantic and furious.\u201cSenior apprentice-brother!\u201d A distance voice rang out. \u201cIt\u2019s a bewildering formation. We\u2019ve all been separated. Ji Ninefire, that old bastard, is planning to kill us one by one! They will definitely have several Zifu Disciples join forces to fight against each of us one by one!\u201dAlthough he could hear the sound, within the bewildering formation, directions constantly changed, and so he couldn\u2019t tell where it came from at all.\u201cFellow apprentices Ju San, Muse, He Fang, and He Xing, are all of you together?\u201d Ziqi called out frantically.\u201cI\u2019m with my older brother.\u201d A female\u2019s voice rang out.\u201cI\u2019m by myself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alone as well.\u201dThe other two voices caused Ziqi\u2019s heart to grow cold. He understood that although He Fang and his sister were together, Ju San, Muse, and Ziqi himself had been completely separated. And even if the two He siblings joined forces\u2026once the Ji clan attacked together, they would also be in great danger.\u201cThis time, I really have fallen into the trap of that old fellow.\u201d Ziqi was both frantic and furious. \u201cBut how could he have set up this formation in advance?\u201d\u2026\u2026.Separated from each other within the fog of the bewildering formation, the five Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain were in a state of panic. At this time, the Ji clan\u2019s side was both excited and shocked.\u201cPatriarch, why did you suddenly attack?\u201d\u201cAnd this\u2026this\u2026this\u2026what\u2019s going on with this formation?\u201dAll of the clansmen were stunned.Ninefire swept everyone with his gaze, then growled, \u201cMy Ji clan isn\u2019t a soft bone for them to chew on. They are riding on our heads to the point where they are even pissing and shitting on our faces. How can we possibly take any more of this? Rather than slink away like cowards, let\u2019s battle to our heart\u2019s content. In the end, my Ji clan will still have a chance!\u201d\u201cObey my orders!\u201d Ninefire commanded.All the clansmen awaited.\u201cNorthwind, you go lead Ji Mo and the others to immediately board our birds to stealthily leave Swallow Mountain in three different streams.\u201d Ninefire said. \u201cThey will pass down the lineage of the Ji clan.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cJi Winterpool, immediately head to Swallow Mountain City and make a report to the Grand Xia Dynasty that an elemental ore mine has appeared within the territory of the Ji clan. I entrust this task to you. Remember, arrange for multiple messengers. You have to ensure that at least one group makes it to Swallow Mountain City.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dNinefire swept the rest with his gaze. \u201cEveryone else who is not at the Zifu Disciple level, return to the City of Ten Thousand Swords. Leave this place to us. Go.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith a thud, these members of the Ji clan all fell to their knees. They looked at Ninefire, Ning, Truekeep, Yichuan. Although they didn\u2019t say anything, all of them then quickly left.\u201cWe are the only ones left here.\u201d Ninefire swept the remaining people with his gaze. \u201cThese five arrogant Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain have already been separated by my formation. As long as we attack them one by one, we can completely exterminate them!\u201d\u201cJi Ning.\u201d Ninefire looked at Ning. \u201cYou are the hope of our Ji clan, and the future of our Ji clan. If the situation truly grows dire, you are to immediately use the Traceless Talisman to flee! As long as you survive, our Ji clan will not be exterminated!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ning gritted his teeth and replied.\u201cPrepare to kill, then.\u201d Ninefire began to laugh loudly. \u201cIt\u2019s been so many years since I\u2019ve gone wild. I suddenly feel much younger, and filled with anticipation, like the first time I entered my marital bed!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

None of them had seen the Patriarch set up the formation, and after the Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain had come over\u2026there was no time to set up a formation either.Ji Ninefire glanced at the people before him. \u201cWhen considering matters, one needs to take a longer view of things. When I first had an inkling of how large this elemental ore mine was, I grew concerned that it would attract the greed of Snowdragon Mountain, and so I began to take precautions against them! What if Snowdragon Mountain came and tried to pressure us? Thus, early on, I set down the formation in the area around us. If we didn\u2019t end up fighting, fine. If we did though, then we naturally have to seize the upper hand. As for why I didn\u2019t tell the rest of you? If I told you and let you all be aware of the great formation around us, would you have all displayed such rage and grief? Snowdragon Mountain\u2019s people probably would have realized, found the formation, and broken through it long ago.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Ning and the others all nodded.But Ning understood as well\u2026Although this wasn\u2019t very strange or mysterious once explained, earlier, everyone had been stunned and astonished by the size and scale of this elemental ore mine. None of them, however, had thought to set down a formation first. This was a matter of experience and foresight!\u201cNo matter what, my actions cause me to feel ashamed to meet the ancestors of the Ji clan. I\u2019ve let the Ji clan fall into peril.\u201d Ninefire said in a low voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to choose this path at all. Choosing this path means fighting Snowdragon Mountain head on. My Ji clan must sign an agreement as soon as possible with the Grand Xia Dynasty. Once we sign the agreement, we will at least be guaranteed of a thousand years of safety. A thousand years from now, I have faith that our Ji clan would have risen to prominence. Even if we are still weak though, a thousand years is enough time for our Ji clan to have made our arrangements.\u201d\u201cNow\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go kill them, as many as we can. The more we kill, the less pressure our Ji clan will be under.\u201d Ninefire swept his gaze across everyone. Granny Shadow. The old servant, Ah Xing. Truekeep. Yichuan. Ning. These were the top-tier fighters of the Ji clan. \u201cI, Shadow, Ah Xing, and Ning will join forces to kill the He siblings! Truekeep, Yichuan, the two of you go deal with Ju San.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Everyone acknowledged the order.Shadow hurriedly asked, \u201cThen what about Dong Ziqi? He\u2019s a calamity waiting to happen. We must eradicate him early on.\u201d\u201cHe and Muse have located each other and joined forces already.\u201d Ninefire said. \u201cWe will deal with them in the end.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll guide you through the fog.\u201d Ninefire immediately advanced, and Granny Shadow, Ah Xing, and Ning all followed him. The four of them were the most powerful four members of the Ji clan. As for Truekeep and Yichuan, a corridor naturally formed for them through the mist, and they advanced at high speed as well.\u2026\u2026..Within the formation.Dong Ziqi\u2019s face was icy and sinister. \u201cI actually fell into the old crook\u2019s scheme.\u201d In the area around him, eight black crystal balls appeared out of nowhere, each of which was the size of a person\u2019s skull. Within them, a faint image of a draconic shadow could be seen swimming about. The eight bloody trigrams on the black robe he was wearing immediately radiated a bloody light.The bloody light encompassed those eight distant black crystal balls.\u201cArise!\u201dOne enormous, shadowy, blood-colored dragon after another appeared in front of Ziqi. There were eight shadowy blood-colored dragons. They swirled amongst each other, constantly roving about within the formation.\u201cFellow disciples, stay where you are and do not move.\u201d Ziqi shouted, while at the same time, he controlled his Eight Trigram Blood Dragons Formation, constantly expanding the scope of the formation.As the scope of the formation increased, those eight shadowy blood dragons also swam about in a wider and wider area. Soon, the width of the formation reached a scope of three hundred meters, encompassing the nearby Muse within it as well. This sort of large formation, which spread out in every direction\u2026made it so that even in a bewildering formation, there was no way one would be completely bewildered!\u201cSenior apprentice-brother Ziqi.\u201d The gray-robed man, Muse, said in surprised delight. He was overjoyed at having been brought within the perimeters of the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation.\u201cWhere are our other fellow disciples?\u201d Ziqi looked around him.\u201cNot here.\u201d Muse shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m the only one within your Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation.\u201dDong Ziqi ground his teeth, then immediately called out in a high voice, \u201cI am together with fellow disciple Muse. He Fang, He Xing, the two of you need to be careful. And Ju San\u2026take care of yourself.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cWe siblings aren\u2019t afraid of them.\u201d\u201cIf they want to kill me, I\u2019ll make sure one of them dies as well!\u201dThree voices rang out.\u201cDamnable.\u201d Dong Ziqi said unhappily. \u201cWe fell into that old crook\u2019s trap. Otherwise, if the five of us joined forces, how could we be put into such a situation by the likes of the Ji clan? I myself am able to kill more than half of them. Junior apprentice-brother Muse, your accomplishments in the Myriad Ancient Green Vines technique are quite profound. If you use the Myriad Ancient Green Vines technique, can you break this formation?\u201d\u201cIt would be very difficult.\u201d Muse shook his head. \u201cEven if I could break it, I would need a very long time, and I probably wouldn\u2019t have enough ki energy.\u201d\u201cUse it as much as you can.\u201d Ziqi said. \u201cI have a bottle of ki recovery pills. Take it.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d Muse gritted his teeth. \u201cThen I\u2019ll hand over the defense to you, senior apprentice-brother.\u201dZiqi said confidently, \u201cYou are within my Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. Even if several of them attack together\u2026I have no fear of them. The only thing I\u2019m afraid of is that they won\u2019t come for me! How detestable\u2026if I had known earlier, I would\u2019ve started to kill them from the start. Now, I can\u2019t even find them, even though I want to kill them.\u201d He, by himself, was equal to his other four fellow disciples if they joined forces. But unfortunately, although he had power, he had no place to exert it.\u201cArise.\u201dMuse stood there, and a single seed fell into the ground.Whoosh!Many tendrils suddenly grew out from that seed, wildly spreading out in every direction.\u201cBewildering formations will bewilder the senses.\u201d Muse said in a low voice. \u201cMy vines will be affected by the bewildering formation as well. It will be hard for them to move in the correct direction. Still, these vines can constantly grow and expand towards empty areas\u2026as long as they continuously fill up the area, if they continuously grow, then naturally they\u2019ll be able to cover the entire formation, and perhaps even go beyond it. My mind is one with these vines. So long as the vines are able to leave the formation, I will know it.\u201d\u201cBut what I don\u2019t know is how large this formation is. After all, when the diameter expands tenfold, the number of tendrils I need to grow is increased a hundredfold. The larger the formation is, the more exhausting it will be for my Ki.\u201d Muse didn\u2019t feel much confidence.\u201cLet\u2019s go all out.\u201d Ziqi gritted his teeth. \u201cTrapped here, the only thing that will happen is that we will be butchered as they please.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Muse didn\u2019t say anything further, striving to expand and empower his technique.Rustle, rustle\u2026Countless vines frantically grew out and elongated, but in the bewildering formation, where they had no sense of direction, these vines grew out in a wild, unorderly manner as well. Still, one thing was certain\u2026they were to grow in the direction of areas where there were no vines! To cover as much new space as they could!\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In another area.Ning, Ninefire, and the others were present.\u201cThe He siblings are up front.\u201d Ninefire said. \u201cI\u2019ll launch the first attack, and then part open the mist. You will see the two of them. All of you, immediately use killing attacks.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Ning nodded.Whoosh!More than seven hundred sword-type magic treasures suddenly appeared in the area around Ning, each of which glowed with a hazy white light. The swords gently ebbed and flowed, unceasingly summoning and coalescing the power of the world. Ning\u2019s ki was constantly being transformed through these magic swords as well, and in front of him, a dazzling, eye-catching white sword light had taken form.[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] \u2013 Level Nine!\u201cWhat a sharp sword light.\u201d Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and the old servant, Ah Xing, were shocked. Although they hadn\u2019t interacted with it, they could sense how sharp this sword light was.Granny Shadow pointed with her finger, and in front of her, three flying swords appeared as well, each of which glowed with a faint, fiery light.Next to her, the old servant Ah Xing lifted his hand, and a warhammer appeared within it.\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d Ninefire waved his hand, and a mottled, five-colored flying sword suddenly pierced through the air. Ninefire was famous for using poisons and formations\u2026although this flying sword was a ranked magic treasure, to be more precise, it was a poison sword.\u2026\u2026A hundred meters in front of Ning, He Fang and He Xing, brother and sister, were present. The two had used a number of Dao-seals, and their bodies were covered by golden light. At the same time, two magic treasures were constantly flying around them, one which looked like an iron pestle, while the other was a strange-looking tiled jar magic treasure.\u201cWe can\u2019t see our surroundings. They will definitely ambush us. Be careful.\u201d The green-haired man, He Fang, said softly.\u201cRight.\u201d His younger sister, He Xing, was incomparably cautious as well.Suddenly\u2026A five-colored flying sword suddenly descended at an astonishing speed. However, as the He siblings were constantly on-guarded, they immediately used their techniques to defend.\u201cWhoosh\u2026\u201dThe floating tiled jar suddenly emitted a large amount of green liquid into a watery curtain, which was incomparably tough and unyielding. Once the five-colored flying sword pierced into the curtain of green liquid, the speed of it immediately slowed greatly.\u201cWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\u201dThree flying swords glowing with fiery light slashed through the skies as well. It was the three flying swords of Granny Shadow.This instantly caused the faces of He Fang and He Xing, brother and sister, to change greatly. They hurriedly worked to block it as well, but the water curtain was beginning to be unable to withstand it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBang!\u201d An enormous black warhammer, carrying even more incomparably ferocious power, smashed straight through the quivering water curtain, and then smashed onto the golden light covering the body of He Xing, the younger sister. The golden light instantly trembled violently, as though it was about to shatter.\u201cNot good.\u201d\u201cQuick, let\u2019s run. If we stay here, we\u2019re just going to serve as punching bags.\u201d He Fang and He Xing, after having suffered successive strikes, had begun to panic. Clearly, there were quite a few enemies.Swish!A dazzling sword light suddenly slashed out in a lonely arc, leaving behind a beautiful, dreary afterimage as it instantly pierced through the quivering barrier of golden light covering He Xing\u2019s body\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There\u2019re no other options!\u201d Her green hair suddenly emitted a dazzling green light while at the same time, her entire body dimly glowed with a green aura. As for that sword light which had just pierced through the golden aura protecting her body, it clashed straight against that green aura. The green aura trembled, and rippling runes appeared on its surface, but in the end, with a boom, it blew apart.The remaining energy in the sword light was quite weak now, so weak that it wasn\u2019t even able to pierce through the protective magic treasure He Xing was wearing.\u201cElder Brother! The talisman which Master gave us was broken through in just one attack.\u201d He Xing said frantically.This was too terrifying.The power of that sword light was most likely close to that of a casual blow from a Wanxiang Adept. Even the talisman her master had given her to protect her was only able to take a single blow.\u201cLittle Sister, let\u2019s go all out.\u201d Mu Fang gritted his teeth. \u201cWe can\u2019t hope for a lucky break to occur. We have to treat this as our potential tomb, for us to have a chance of surviving.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Xing nodded.A look of resoluteness appeared in the eyes of these two siblings. Their auras grew savage, and a layer of bloody light arose on their skin.\u201cForbidden arts!\u201d The distant attackers, Ji Ninefire, Ji Ning, Granny Shadow, the old servant Ah Xing saw this, and their faces changed.Forbidden arts\u2026Generally speaking, they referred to forbidden techniques that were used through sacrificing one\u2019s own lifespan. They could only be used at enormous cost, and once the cost was made, it was very hard to recover from it. But precisely because the cost was great, the power one had upon using a forbidden art would rapidly rise as ewll.\u201cYou want to kill us? Come, then.\u201d\u201cCome.\u201dAfter having used a forbidden technique, He Xing and He Fang both had savagery in their eyes.\u201cThey are like trapped beasts right now.\u201d Ninefire hurriedly sent mentally to the others. \u201cAlthough they are surrounded and attacked by us, they are still Zifu Disciples, and they\u2019ve used forbidden techniques. If we aren\u2019t careful, some of us might die. We have to be cautious. We have the advantage. I\u2019d rather we give up some opportunities than risk our lives. We just have to find a single good opportunity, at which point we can kill them.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Granny Shadow narrowed her eyes.The old servant, Ah Xing, just stared at the distant He siblings, controlling that great warhammer of his.As for Ning, he unleashed a second sword light.The four were working together!They wildly attacked the He siblings in unison. Amongst these five enemy Zifu Disciples, the He siblings actually had only average strength; they were ranked behind Dong Ziqi and Muse! As for Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and Ah Xing, they were old fellows who had lived for nearly four centuries, each of whom were actually a good amount more powerful than the He siblings. And that\u2019s not even mentioning the monstrous Ji Ning!Only through using forbidden arts were the He siblings capable of just barely holding off the joint attacks of these four.\u201cDespicable, sly Ji clansmen.\u201d He Fang and He Xing were cursing wildly while controlling their magic treasures to resist. Because they had used forbidden arts, their ability to control magic treasures had clearly increased\u2026in particular, the water curtain which flew out from the tiled jar was actually able to resist Ning\u2019s [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]!This caused Ning to sigh in his heart.His enemies were Zifu Disciples, while he himself only had peak Xiantian-level Ki. For him to be able to fight against someone at a higher level who was even using forbidden arts\u2026the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] should be proud of itself.\u201cElder Brother, that Ji Ning is too powerful.\u201d He Xing had a look of despair in her eyes. \u201cEven going all out, I\u2019m only able to block him alone.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m almost unable to hold out any longer as well.\u201d He Fang was simultaneously blocking the other three.Suddenly\u2026At the same instant, He Fang and He Xing each released a Dao-seal radiating a black light from their hands. They instantly activated the pair of Dao-seals, which immediately transformed into tens of rays of black light which quickly attacked Ninefire and the other three! Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and the old servant Ah Xing were shocked, and they hurriedly used what abilities they had to resist. As for Ning, he wielded two swords in his hands, with the Waterflame Lotus swiveling around his body.\u201cBoomboomboom\u2026\u201d The rays of black light pierced directly through the Waterflame Lotus, but were blocked by Ning\u2019s Darknorth swords.But Ning couldn\u2019t help but stagger backwards, taking six heavy steps back, the ground cracking with each step.\u201cSuch power.\u201d Ning stared at his waist. A large hole had been pierced through his waist, but in the blink of an eye, his flesh quickly grew out, regenerating the wound and not leaving behind a single scar.\u201cJi Ning, it\u2019s good that we have you. Otherwise, that technique alone would have wounded us, and perhaps one of us would even have died.\u201d Ninefire was frightened as well. That black light had simply been too fast. Once it pierced through their bodies\u2026the other three were all Ki Refiners. If they weren\u2019t careful, they would lose their lives.Granny Shadow sent mentally as well, \u201cThese two really live up to their reputation as being members from the main sect. They have so many techniques. If we aren\u2019t careful, we might fall to one of them. Let\u2019s pull away slightly; at a longer distance, it\u2019ll be easier for us to deal with them.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Ninefire nodded. \u201cThe two of them are close to the breaking point. If we keep it up a little longer, they will definitely die.\u201dHearing this, Ning frowned.The Patriarch and the other two were all Zifu-level Ki Refiners. They didn\u2019t dare fight in close quarters combat, because in close quarters combat, if one suffered an attack that was too fast and which didn\u2019t give one a chance to dodge, one could easily die. It was correct for them to decide to pull away\u2026but Ning himself was a Fiendgod Body Refiner! How long would it take for them to continue wasting time like this? They had to end this quickly!\u201cPatriarch, leave it to me.\u201d Ning shouted mentally to them, while at the same time, a pair of wing-type magic treasures appeared out of nowhere on his back. The wings fluttered, and Ning soared into the air like a giant Roc, instantly appearing in front of He Fang and He Xing, the two siblings.\u201cCareful.\u201d Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and Ah Xing were all shocked, but they knew that Ning was a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and that he trained in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. They weren\u2019t too worried about him.\u201cPerfect timing.\u201d He Fang and He Xing, the two siblings, were startled, then delighted.Prior to this, they had been filled with rage.Ninefire and the others had been too crafty; they had insisted on fighting at a distance, not giving the two of them a chance to fight back! The two were all but standing there and letting others beat down on them. They didn\u2019t dare to make the slightest mistake, because if they did, the enemies would seize the chance to kill them. But who could forever be perfect and never make a mistake? Just as they were feeling despair, Ji Ning charged over.\u201cAfter killing you, our deaths would have been worth it.\u201d\u201cThe genius of the Ji clan.\u201dThe He siblings had gone mad in their desire to kill Ning.But Ning, moving like a giant Roc, arced outwards in a curving, solitary line as he attacked He Xing. His target was her, as she had already used up a protective talisman. In front of Ning, there was a flash of sword light, and the Darknorth swords in his hands executed his most powerful attack\u2026Rain Line!\u201cBang!\u201dThe sword light flashed outwards!He Xing\u2019s beautiful head was sent flying into the air, her eyes still filled with disbelief and shock.\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d The nearby He Fang stared at Ning.There was a wound on Ning\u2019s head, which carved straight through his forehead, but this wound quickly healed. The reason why he was able to kill He Xing, a Zifu Disciple, in a single exchange was not only that Ning\u2019s swordplay vastly outstripped the opponent\u2019s; it was also because Ning fought in a way where the two of them would both take \u2018lethal\u2019 wounds, allowing her to stab him with her sword. This was why he was able to kill her in a single exchange.\u201cYou\u2026have reached the Zifu Disciple level as a Fiendgod as well?\u201d He Fang didn\u2019t dare believe it.Killing a Fiendgod Body Refiner was far more difficult than killing a Ki Refiner.Previously, Ning had used the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], which was clearly a Ki Refiner technique. And Ning was only sixteen years old\u2026He Fang and He Xing had both believed that given his age, Ning should only have opened his Violet Palace as a Ki Refiner! He most likely had yet to be able to open his Violet Palace as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and should only be a Xiantian-stage lifeform. Generally speaking, a Xiantian-level Fiendgod Body Refiner\u2019s head was still a critical area. Even someone who trained in the number one technique, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], would have to reach the peak Xiantian level before having no critical areas anywhere in the body. That was why He Xing had wanted to sacrifice her life in that exchange.\u201cLittle Sister.\u201d He Fang stared at the corpse on the ground, then suddenly let out a heroic howl. \u201cSenior apprentice-brother Ziqi, avenge us and annihilate the Ji clan!!!\u201d\u201cBack.\u201d Ning\u2019s face changed, and his wing-type magic treasure fluttered as he frantically retreated.\u201cBoom.\u201dHe Fang suddenly exploded.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe Zifu Violet Palace in his body was like an enormous lake which contained endless amounts of lake water. This lake water was actually liquefied ki energy! When He Fang detonated his Zifu \u2018lake\u2019, all of the liquefied ki energy that had accumulated in his Zifu instantly transformed into usable Ki. Even if his body had to blow apart, he wanted to make this liquefied ki instantly transform and blast outwards. The power of this elemental blast was simply terrifying.The savage, boundless wave of ki spread out, rippling in every direction! Instantly, the turbid wave of elemental ki blasted into the frantically retreating Ji Ning, submerging him within it!BOOM!!!\u201cJi Ning!\u201d\u201cJi Ning!\u201d The distant Ji Ninefire and the other two were shocked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ning lay deep within the crater, fresh, crimson blood splattered everywhere. The wing-type magic treasure on his back was already twisted\u2026but within the crater, Ning was quickly recovering. He stretched his hand out, lifting himself upwards and quickly returning to his feet.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Ning said hoarsely. That earlier explosive force had damaged even his throat. As he arose from the deep crater, the various wounds on his back were quickly healing, and the terrifying injuries his body had sustained were rapidly regenerating. Moments later, not even a scar could be seen. As for Ning\u2019s protective magic armor, it quickly reformed into the shape of the beast fur clothes his mother had made for him.This caused Ninefire and the other two to sigh in amazement. This was what Ki Refiners like them envied the most with regards to Fiendgod Body Refiners.If it was them, they probably would have died long ago!\u201cThe power of a detonating Zifu \u2018lake\u2019 truly is terrifying.\u201d Ning sighed in amazement.Establishing the \u2018Violet Palace\u2019 was part of the Immortal path. The Zifu was like a lake that contained liquefied ki energy. The Zifu lake was thus the foundation for an Immortal practitioner! A fruit tree that wished to bloom and birth fruits had to have a patch of land, while Immortal practitioners who wished to reach the Wanxiang level or become a Primal Immortal\u2026had to have a Zifu lake! This was their foundation. Zifu Disciples would constantly accumulate their ki energy, expanding the size of that lake\u2026But once the accumulated ki energy was detonated, the first to die from the explosion iwould be the practitioner! Only then would others be hit by the explosion.\u201cThis is why the three of us didn\u2019t dare to attack in close combat. Only you, a Fiendgod Body Refiner, would dare draw near.\u201d Ninefire said.\u201cFormidable.\u201d Ning said softly.\u201cThe lifeforce possessed by Fiendgods truly is astonishing.\u201d Granny Shadow said hoarsely.\u2026\u2026\u2026..In a different area.The eight shadowy blood dragons of the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation roved about sinuously. In the center were Muse and Dong Ziqi. Ziqi had a gloomy look on his face, and his eyes were filled with a boundless killing intent. He truly wished to charge out and kill them. But that group of Ji clan cowards didn\u2019t dare to come face him.\u201cLittle Sister! Senior apprentice-brother Ziqi, avenge us and annihilate the Ji clan!!!\u201d A fierce voice suddenly rang out, and then\u2026a deafening, massive explosion.Muse, seated in the lotus position, opened his eyes, which were filled with a look of sorrow. \u201cThe He siblings are dead.\u201d\u201cNot only dead; he even detonated his own Zifu lake. He was forced into dire straits.\u201d Ziqi\u2019s voice was hoarse, and his eyes were filled with rage. He, Dong Ziqi, had actually been forced into such a terrible situation, and by the puny little Ji clan. This caused the look on Ziqi\u2019s face to become all the more terrible. He howled savagely, \u201cI, Dong Ziqi, swear that I will definitely annihilate the Ji clan! Definitely!\u201d His roar rang out.\u201cI will definitely annihilate the Ji clan! Definitely!!!\u201dAs Ning heard this, his face changed slightly. He could sense the wild savagery and killing intent held within this shout. By his side, Ninefire just said coldly, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t kill them, they would still annihilate our Ji clan for not handing over the official writ! If they want to kill us, then they need to be prepared for the possibility that we might kill them. Screaming loudly now is the act of a coward.\u201d\u201cCome. Let\u2019s go deal with Dong Ziqi.\u201d Granny Shadow ground her teeth, speaking in a hoarse voice.\u201cRight.\u201d The old servant, Ah Xing, acknowledged.Ning was filled with boundless killing intent as well\u2026against these enemy forces who wanted to annihilate the Ji clan and give them no options, Ning wouldn\u2019t feel a hint of pity!\u201cJi Ning.\u201d Ninefire just frowned. \u201cImmediately go to your father\u2019s place. Assist them in killing Ju San.\u201d\u201cMy father?\u201d Ning was startled.Can it be that his father, Ji Yichuan, and Ji Truekeep had met with trouble in their combined effort to deal with that \u2018Jusan\u2019?\u201cIt\u2019s Muse.\u201d Ninefire said urgently. \u201cMuse is currently using a magical technique, causing a large number of vines to rapidly grow out nonstop. They\u2019ve already grown near the place where your father is. Once those vines encounter Ju San\u2026! Dong Ziqi and Muse will quickly follow the vines and rejoin with Ju San! Once the three join forces, it will be even more difficult to kill them.\u201dA path through the mist had already appeared in front of Ning.\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Ning transformed into a blurred shadow, quickly advancing forward.\u201cWe\u2019ll go deal with Dong Ziqi and Muse.\u201d Ninefire looked towards Granny Shadow and Ah Xing. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to kill them, but we need to disturb that Muse\u2026ideally, making it so that Muse won\u2019t be able to continue to use that technique of his. Those vines have grown so large\u2026Muse definitely had to use up quite a bit of mental energy and Ki.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Granny Shadow and Ah Xing both nodded.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!The three quickly hurried towards Ziqi\u2026and as for Ning, as he flew forward, he saw the vines rapidly growing, but by relying on the Windwing Evasion, he was able to dodge past them and not touch them.Soon.From far away, the sound of explosions could be heard, and the fog grew thin as well. Ning saw two figures standing in the distance; it was his own father, Yichuan, and his clansman, Truekeep.\u201cOh? Father isn\u2019t using any magic treasures. Can it be that Father hasn\u2019t established his Zifu yet?\u201d As Ning hurried over, he discovered that Truekeep was currently controlling magic treasures to battle against that muscular man named Ju San, while Ning\u2019s father, Yichuan, was brandishing his sword, releasing one last after another of sword light, each of which flowed out like a stream of water, constantly racing towards that muscular Ju San. Those blasts of sword light seemed like entangling threads, constantly restricting and binding Ju San.Truekeep was the main force, while Yichuan was support!\u201cDamnable.\u201d Ju San bellowed.\u201cFrom what the Patriarch previously said, it seems as though my father is a Zifu Disciple. But why is it that I\u2019ve never seen Father ride on a magic treasure?\u201d Ning was puzzled. \u201cIn fact, that year, when I suffered the attack from Serpentwing, when Father pursued Serpentwing, he didn\u2019t ride on a magic treasure back then either. What\u2019s the reason for this?\u201dNing had asked his father before, but his father had refused to answer.\u201cAfter this battle, I\u2019ll ask the Patriarch.\u201d Ning buried these doubts in his heart, while at the same time, a pair of Darknorth swords appeared in his hands, while the wings on his back fluttered, sending him piercing through the air.Prior to this, when He Fang had detonated his own Zifu Lake, the previous pair of wing-type magic treasures had been destroyed, but fortunately, Ning had quite a few sets of these unranked treasures.\u201cFather, Uncle Truekeep! Leave this Ju San to me!\u201d Ning shouted loudly, then transformed into a ray of light, charging towards Ju San.Yichuan and Truekeep both turned to look. \u201cJi Ning!\u201d\u201cHahaha, perfect!\u201d From afar, mighty Ju San, who had power but no place to expend it, watched as Ning charged towards him. He was overjoyed! He was a Zifu Fiendgod Body Refiner! Fiendgod Body Refiners loved to engage in close quarters combat. Prior to this, Truekeep and Yichuan had continuously kept far away from him, and he, Ju San, was not proficient in movement techniques, and thus was completely unable to catch up.To be constantly beaten down on, but be unable to catch up.What sort of torment was this!Although he had opened up his Zifu as a Ki Refiner as well, he hadn\u2019t spent too much time and effort on learning how to ride magic treasures. His primary efforts had been expended on close quarters combat.\u201cCome, come, come. Let me take a look at this genius of the Ji clan and see how powerful you are.\u201d Behind Ju San, a pair of black wings had appeared. As he went forward to engage Ning, he clearly was quite agile.\u201cWing-type magic treasure?\u201d Ning looked at the pair of wings on Ju San\u2019s back, and his eyes couldn\u2019t help but light up. The vast majority of Fiendgod Body Refiners would use wings, so as to make them more agile. \u201cIt should be a ranked magic treasure. I was worrying about how, after breaking through to the Zifu level, I wouldn\u2019t have any ranked wing-type magic treasures.\u201dBoom!Boom!Two people. One came from the main sect of Snowdragon Mountain, and although he trained in a fairly ordinary Fiendgod Body Refining technique, known as the [Mighty Demon \u2013 Introductory], he was an early Zifu Disciple. Although the name of this technique seemed quite ordinary, it was quite a bit superior to the techniques the Ji clan possessed, such as the [Sutra of the Future Buddha] or [Indestructible Blood Fiend], even though those techniques had more impressive-sounding names. Generally speaking, the more powerful a sect was, the more modest the names their techniques would be.As for the other person, this person trained in the technique that even in the Fiendgod Era was the indisputable number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. But this person was only a peak Xiantian.\u201cBANG!\u201d \u201cBANG!\u201dJu San was wielding a greataxe, while Ning was wielding a pair of swords.The two exchanged blows\u2026It was like a pair of juvenile Fiendgods from back in the Primordial Era who were fighting against each other. Instantly, the earth began to quake, then split apart, sending rocks flying everywhere! The two both had wing-type magic treasures behind them, and they they wildly battled each other in close quarters combat, completely unafraid of the occasional wounds they suffered. As for Ju San\u2019s body, one wound after another appeared atop it.\u201cThis Ju San\u2019s axecraft is quite impressive. The greataxe is very large, making it so that when it defends, it is almost like a buckler.\u201d Ning said to himself.\u201cJi Ning has actually reached the Zifu level as a Fiendgod practitioner as well.\u201d Ju San was even more shocked. \u201cAnd his usage of dual swords is all the more marvelous and skilled. I\u2019ve focused on my axecraft for nearly a century, but I actually can\u2019t compare to his swordcraft! I\u2019m at a disadvantage with every exchange\u2026\u201d Right now, he had only left two wounds on Ning\u2019s body, and that was only because Ning had willingly accepted the blow in order to deliver one to him as well. But as for Ju San, his body had suffered over a hundred wounds on it by now. But of course, all of them had healed automatically.Ning\u2019s swordplay became even more ferocious and wild.\u201cFaster, faster, faster!\u201dNing understood that as the opponent used a heavy weapon, the greataxe, he himself had to fight based on his speed. The faster Ning was, the more flaws the enemy would reveal.\u201cLike the wind!\u201d\u201cLike the flame!\u201dNing\u2019s left and right hands each held a sword, but they used completely different swordplay techniques. One sword was as illusory as the wind, while the other sword was as aggressively scorching as a flame. Both of them were shockingly fast, and the two worked in unison, creating a explosive combination. The power of the two techniques multiplied, feeding off each other!\u201cFaster! Even faster!\u201d Ning battled wildly against Ju San, raining down blows upon him.Ju San\u2019s movements became disordered, unable to keep up.\u201cSLASH!\u201dA sword blow that was as strangely agile and graceful as the wind slashed past the greataxe, and also slashed through Jusan\u2019s waist. Crunch. Blood flew everywhere, and Ju San was bisected.\u201cHere\u2019s my chance.\u201d Ning instantly entered a berserk mode.Thunderflash Flint!Thunderflash Flint!Thunderflash Flint!Ning\u2019s two swords simultaneously executed this technique. There was nothing weird about this technique, nothing savage about it; all it had was speed! One ray after another of sword light wildly chopped down on the bisected halves of Ju San\u2019s body, causing Ju San\u2019s body to constantly shatter, but Ju San\u2019s head continued to roar, \u201cIt won\u2019t be so easy to kill a Fiendgod Body Refiner!\u201d\u201cWaterflame Lotus.\u201d Ning executed his final, killing stroke.Those countless pieces of Ju San\u2019s body became enveloped within a Waterflame Lotus. The petals of the fire and water slowly swiveled against each other. After five years of training, the murderous grinding power of Ning\u2019s Waterflame Lotus had reached a terrifyingly strong level. These completely defenseless chunks of bloody flesh were completely ground into dust.Grind! Grind! Grind!The pieces of bloody flesh tried frantically to reconnect to each other, reforming into a person. But they were constantly being ground down by the Waterflame Lotus!Rumble\u2026The chunks of bloody flesh were completely ground to dust, completely unable to reform once more.Ju San! Dead!\u201cLooks like I acquired a set of ranked wing-type magic treasures in advance.\u201d Ning stretched his hand out, collecting the nearby spoils, including the wing-type magic treasures, the greataxe, the protective magic-terasures, and the various other magic treasures.Ning turned to look.Truekeep and Yichuan stood there watching from afar, looks of disbelief and shock on their faces. They had watched as two Fiendgod experts battled wildly and viciously against each other\u2026it was power against power, and as soon as one fell, the other wildly charged forward to dismember him, giving him no chance at all to recover. Fortunately, Ning had his Waterflame Lotus, as otherwise it would have been hard for him to so quickly dispose of this Ju San.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Ning said hurriedly. \u201cFather, Uncle Truekeep, we need to hurry up and rejoin the Patriarch. There are only two more remaining!\u201d\u201cTher are only two more remaining?\u201d Truekeep and Yichuan were excited as well. They hadn\u2019t imagined that in this battle, the Ji clan would actually have achieved such a glorious success, with only two Zifu Disciples remaining now.However, it was the most powerful two!\u201cKill them.\u201dNing, Yichuan, and Truekeep transferred into rays of light, hurrying back to regroup with Ninefire and the others\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In front of Ning formed an irresistible, unblockable sword light. With a thought, the sword light formed from the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] shot through the air.[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] \u2013 Level Nine!\u201cSwish!\u201dThe dazzling sword light charged straight into the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation, and in the instant that it did so, the shadowy blood dragons immediately bellowed and charged forth. Cracklecracklecrackle\u2026the sword light just managed to eradicate a single shadowy blood dragon before the power of the sword light was used up, but soon, the shadowy blood dragon once more reformed.\u201cWhat.\u201d Ning was amazed. \u201cI was only able to destroy a single dragon? And it almost immediately reformed?\u201dDong Ziqi, within the formation, gave the distant Ning a cold, insidious look. In a hoarse voice, he said, \u201cYou live up to your reputation as being the genius of the Ji clan. Only sixteen years old\u2026and yet you are able to destroy one of the dragons of my Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. However, the little bit of power you have is far from being sufficient.\u201d\u201cNing, don\u2019t charge in.\u201d Ninefire sent mentally in a frantic voice. \u201cThis sort of formation is perfectly suited to countering Fiendgod Body Refiners. As soon as you charge within, you\u2019ll be attacked by all eight of those blood dragons, and they will rip you to pieces.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Ning nodded.Although Fiendgod Body Refiners were superior to Ki Refiners\u2026there was no such thing as an absolute truth!Ki Refiners had their powerful experts as well, who were able to fight against those at a higher level as them. The [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] was one such example! Or, for example, those Ki Refiners who bred countless venomous pests, which would be released out in a flood, devouring everything in their path. Fiengod Body Refiners were more powerful, yes\u2026but that was as a whole. On an individual level, there were incomparably glorious and talented Ki Refiners as well.\u201cThe six of us should join forces to attack and see if we have any chance of winning.\u201d A killing intent flashed through the eyes of Ninefire.A flying sword flew through the air!Venomous bugs danced out!A sword light pierced forward!In an instant, the entire world seemed to be filled with various techniques and attacks, which flew towards the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. Within the formation, Ziqi laughed wildly. \u201cExcellent!\u201d Those eight shadowy blood dragons, which had been peacefully swimming about, suddenly turned savage as they charged forward to welcome those attacks. They blocked one magic treasure after another, and as some of the dragons dispersed, they quickly reformed.The eight shadowy blood dragons coiled about in a circular rhythm, forcibly taking on the attacks of Ning and the rest of the six.\u201cCowards of the Ji clan, if you have any ability, come into my Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation.\u201d Seeing that the attacks had been completely blocked, Dong Ziqi, standing within the formation, became even more arrogant. \u201cYou killed three of my fellow disciples because you had the advantage of numbers. In terms of actual ability, how could your Ji clan be a match for us? If we were to really fight, I, Dong Ziqi, would be able to annihilate you all!\u201dOutside the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation, Ninefire, Granny Shadow, Ah Xing, Yichuan, Truekeep, and Ning were astonished at the power of this formation.\u201cFormidable.\u201d Ninefire sent mentally. \u201cAlthough I have long heard of the power of Dong Ziqi\u2019s Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation, I\u2019ve never fought against it. It seems that the eight dragons within the formation are all comparable to a peak Zifu Disciple. With the eight joining forces\u2026the power is truly astonishing. Even if the six of us truly want to go all out and kill him, most likely three of us would die.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in life that has no risk.\u201d Granny Shadow sent. \u201cLet\u2019s kill this Dong Ziqi!\u201d\u201cOur Ji clan has too few Zifu Disciples! But Snowdragon Mountain has plenty of them. It isn\u2019t worth it for us to die alongside these two.\u201d Ninefire refuted.Ning stared at the distant Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation.What to do?After having attacked for the amount of time needed to brew tea, although Ning had only occasionally released an attack from his [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], the ki energy in his body was more than half used up.\u201cHold your attacks.\u201d Ninefire sent. \u201cWe\u2019ve attacked together for so long now, but we haven\u2019t had a single chance for breaking through. If we don\u2019t take any risks, we won\u2019t be able to kill Dong Ziqi. In addition, those vines are constantly growing outwards. Soon, they\u2019ll have exited the perimeters of my bewildering formation. Forget it. We\u2019ll just let them go this time.\u201d\u201cLet them go?\u201d Truekeep\u2019s eyes were filled with disbelief. \u201cPatriarch, if we lose this opportunity, in the future, Dong Ziqi will definitely come together with other Zifu Disciples. Killing him will be even more difficult.\u201d\u201cFool.\u201d Ninefire sent furiously. \u201cWe aren\u2019t trying to annihilate Snowdragon Mountain. What we are trying to do\u2026is to let the Ji clan survive for a longer period of time! The six of us need to endure for as long as we can, to endure until the Grand Xia Dynasty\u2019s Celestial Envoy arrives! Once we sign our agreement, then we will have succeeded. Our lives are more important than Dong Ziqi\u2019s life! If we go all out and three of us die so that we eventually kill the two of them\u2026when Snowdragon Mountain comes for revenge, they\u2019ll come with an entire group of Zifu Disciples. By then, how can the remaining people delay for any longer?\u201dTruekeep instantly came to his senses.Killing the enemy was secondary. What really mattered for the Ji clan was to overcome this tribulation.They had to endure and survive until the Grand Xia Dynasty\u2019s Celestial Envoy arrived! As for killing the Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain, that was a secondary goal. Killing a few extra Zifu Disciples would reduce their future pressure, but if today, they suffered too many losses, then it wouldn\u2019t be worth it.Within the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation, Dong Ziqi was feeling taut and nervous as well. As the saying goes, it is hard for a pair of hands to fight off two pairs. He was faced with the attacks of six Zifu Disciples, each of which was displaying numerous techniques which filled the skies. Just now, he had just barely blocked the attacks of these six. If the Ji clan\u2019s forces were to use forbidden arts to go all out\u2026he would be in great danger as well.\u201cEven if I die, I\u2019ll drag them down with me.\u201d Dong Ziqi\u2019s eyes flashed with wildness.\u201cSenior apprentice-brother Ziqi.\u201d Seated in the lotus position, the ashen-faced Muse suddenly opened his eyes, a look of wild joy within them. \u201cMy vines have already extended to beyond the bewildering formation.\u201dZiqi was stunned, and then he was overjoyed as well. \u201cWe can leave?\u201dIf he could live, of course he would rather live than fight to the death.\u201cI can sense the location of that vine. By following my senses, we can charge straight out.\u201d Muse hurriedly rose to his feet. \u201cSenior apprentice-brother Ziqi, control the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. We\u2019re going to leave.\u201dA green leaf appeared out of nowhere.The green leaf extended to the size of multiple meters, and Muse and Ziqi stepped atop the leaf. Around them, those eight bloody dragons continued to swim about. Clearly Ziqi was continuously maintaining the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSwoosh!The green leaf began to fly in a strange, zig-zagging manner, occasionally advancing, then retreating, then turning, then retreating, then retreating, then advancing\u2026the movements were completely bizarre. But in truth, this was caused by the disruptions to their sense of direction within the formation. Although it seemed as though they were constantly changing directions, in truth, they were moving towards the outside this entire time.Whoosh\u2026Standing atop the leaf, Muse and Ziqi suddenly saw the desolate mountain forests outside.\u201cWe\u2019re out.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re out. We made it out.\u201d Ziqi and Muse both had looks of surprise and joy on their faces. They had been trapped within the bewildering formation and unable to escape, giving their enemies complete control over what to do. That was indeed quite torturous. Now that they had escaped, they naturally felt incomparably jubilant.\u201cJi clan!\u201d Ziqi gritted his teeth.Muse\u2019s face was sinister as well. \u201cThree of my fellow disciples have died miserable deaths here. How can we not avenge this great enmity?\u201d\u201cJi clan!\u201d Dong Ziqi\u2019s voice echoed for hundreds of kilometers. \u201cJust wait for your clan to be annihilated!\u201dSwoosh!A green leaf instantly slashed through the skies, quickly disappearing into the horizon.And as it did, six figures walked out from within the bewildering formation. It was Ninefire and the other five. Ninefire turned to look towards the distant, desolate mountain forests, and he spied several figures from afar. Ninefire said in a booming voice, \u201cRiverbank clan, Kou clan, Blackfire Sect\u2026\u201d As soon as he spoke, one figure after another flew over at high speed.\u201cForgive us for being unable to assist.\u201d\u201cBrother Ninefire, it wasn\u2019t appropriate for us to intervene.\u201dOne mental voice after another was sent over.And then, those figures mounted on their magic treasures and flew away, departing. All of the Zifu Disciples of the various powers in the Swallow Mountain region had been drawn here by those earlier elemental waves of energy. Although they weren\u2019t able to see the battle between the Ji clan and Snowdragon Mountain, they were able to guess what had happened. In particular, upon hearing Dong Ziqi\u2019s final, angry words, they could tell what those words had implied.\u201cAlas.\u201d Watching as those figures left, Ninefire shook his head. \u201cThis elemental ore mine has major implications. It will definitely draw the attention of even more Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain. No wonder the Blackfire Sect, the Riverbank clan, and the Kou clan weren\u2019t willing to interfere.\u201dIn the Swallow Mountain region, the Ji clan, the Blackfire Sect, the Riverbank clan, and the Kou clan were allied with each other, and they jointly resisted Snowdragon Mountain and the Ironwood clan.But what they jointly resisted was the Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain! But this elemental ore mine\u2026soon, the Zifu Disciples of the main Snowdragon Mountain Sect would come to attack Swallow Mountain, and when that happened, for them to annihilate the Blackfire Sect, Riverbank clan, and Kou clan would be simplicity itself. Of course they didn\u2019t dare interfere. No matter how great the benefits might be, they still wouldn\u2019t dare to intervene.\u201cPatriarch, what should we do now?\u201d Truekeep spoke out.Ning and the others turned to look at their Patriarch.Ninefire said slowly, \u201cThis time, the Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain has suffered severe losses. Three of their Zifu Disciples are dead. They will definitely invite their comrades from throughout the region to have them hurry over here. Given the allure of this elemental ore mine, there will be a large group of Zifu Disciples who will attack Swallow Mountain.\u201dNing and the others all nodded.\u201cThey will definitely invite those nearest Swallow Mountain. Given the speed of Zifu Disciples, they\u2019ll probably arrive in just a day or two.\u201d Ninefire said. \u201cWe have two options.\u201d\u201cThe first option.\u201d\u201cWe can hide.\u201d Ninefire said. \u201cWe can make it so that the Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain are unable to find it. We only need to hide for a few days, and wait for the Angel arrives to sign a transfer agreement with us. This is a fairly safe route\u2026but it will thrust the countless clansmen of our Ji clan into mortal danger.\u201d\u201cThe Zifu Disciples will be here soon, within just a day or two. In just a short day or two, the hundreds of thousands of tribesmen and clansmen belonging to our Ji clan won\u2019t be able to make it far.\u201d Ji Ninefire sighed. \u201cWhen the group of Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain find that they are unable to locate us, to give vent to their rage, they will massacre our clansmen, or perhaps seize them and sell them off as slaves. This is normal.\u201dThe faces of Ning and the others all changed.Hundreds of thousands of their compatriots!\u201cThe second option.\u201d Ninefire said. \u201cWe publicly state that we will be in a certain location, and that we will set up a formation there. We publicly declare\u2026that Snowdragon Mountain can come and kill us there, if they are able to.\u201d\u201cSnowdragon Mountain is a major sect. Sects like them care deeply about their reputation. If we publicly set up this formation, once their Zifu Disciples come, they will definitely attack the formation full force in an attempt to break it. They won\u2019t lower themselves to go slaughter a group of mortals. If they did so, once the word spread, this would be a great stain on Snowdragon Mountain\u2019s reputation. But if we hide, resulting in them being unable to find the \u2018culprits\u2019, they will definitely massacre the people of the Ji clan, so as to demonstrate how the supremacy of Snowdragon Mountain is not to be challenged.Ning and the others all nodded.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRight.Major sects cared about their reputation!If they hid, then those Zifu Disciples would use the excuse of wanting to demonstrate how the supremacy of their sect was not to be challenged, and go massacre the members of the Ji clan, so as to warn others.But if the Ji clan\u2019s experts stood out and openly proclaimed they would be at a certain location within a formation, then the enemies would no longer be able to go act against those ordinary mortals.\u201cEveryone, speak. What choice should we make?\u201d Ninefire looked at his clansmen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Patriarch, his father, and the others were all very calm. Clearly, they had already made their decision.\u201cI am the Patriarch.\u201d Ji NInefire said very calmly. \u201cFor the sake of the Ji clansmen. For the sake of the Ji clan\u2019s reputation! I will stand out and welcome this battle with Snowdragon Mountain!\u201dGranny Shadow said in her hoarse voice, \u201cI\u2019ve lived nearly four hundred years. Can it be that I, Ji Shadow, am going to hide so as to live for a few more years while watching my clansmen fall into danger? In addition, I feel very happy that I\u2019ll be able to face death with my elder brother.\u201d\u201cWherever my mistress is, I shall be there.\u201d The old servant, Ah Xing, actually spoke out, a rare event indeed.\u201cIt\u2019s enough for we three old fellows to be there.\u201d Ninefire smiled.\u201cPatriarch!\u201d Truekeep spoke out. \u201cI know the limits of my own talent. Even amongst the Zifu Disciples of the Ji clan, I am only average. It\u2019s virtually impossible for me to become a Wanxiang Adept! This battle\u2026is the most critical battle which will determine the fate of my Ji clan. I cannot hide from it.\u201dYichuan smiled as well. \u201cPatriarch, you know my situation as well. My Immortal path is shattered. I don\u2019t want to die a silent, meaningless death. I must participate in this battle.\u201d\u201cThe two of you\u2026\u201d Ninefire shook his head.Ning, hearing this, was stunned.His Immortal path was shattered?Didn\u2019t his father always say that his heart was focused on following the Immortal path? Why did that change?\u201cFather, you said your Immortal path is shattered?\u201d Ning stared at his father in disbelief.Yichuan looked at his son, a rather complicated look on his face. \u201cActually, while adventuring in the Darknorth Sea, I had already broken through to the Zifu Disciple level. Afterwards, when your mother became pregnant with you, I had already reached to the middle Zifu level. I led your mother, wanting to return to Swallow Mountain, but your maternal uncle was worried, so he escorted us back.\u201dNing listened intently.He knew that a calamity had occurred on the way back.\u201cAfterwards, we met with a disaster.\u201d Yichuan said. \u201cYour mother was badly injured, but your Uncle White led you back. Your uncle and I both executed forbidden arts, using all our might to delay the enemy! During that battle, your uncle died while I was badly injured. Because I used a forbidden art for too long a period of time, the damage done to my Zifu Violet Palace was too great, and my Violet Palace became warped and atrophied, unable to expand again in the future. In other words, it is impossible for me to increase my power. I will forever remain a mid-level Zifu Disciple.\u201d\u201cBecause of the atrophication of my Zifu, I\u2019m only able to draw out a hint of the ki energy within my Zifu.\u201d Yichuan shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can ride on a magic treasure with just that tiny strand of Ki! Thus, I focus on my swordplay, with that strand of ki being the foundation of it. I draw forth the power of the world with every single blow of sword light.\u201d\u201cBut of course.\u201d Yichuan said somberly. \u201cI can still use a forbidden art one more time, forcibly drawing out a large amount of ki energy from within my Zifu. But given how my Zifu is already warped\u2026there\u2019s no need to repeat what I said earlier. Once I use a forbidden art, most likely within one hour, my Zifu will completely shatter, and I will be transformed into a cripple. In other words\u2026I, your father, can only be a Zifu Disciple for one more time. After one last bout of glory, I will become a cripple.\u201dNing was stunned.No wonder his father\u2019s swordplay was so powerful! No wonder his father never rode on a ranked magic treasure!\u201cMy Immortal path is shattered. I only have one opportunity to use this forbidden art again.\u201d Yichuan looked at his son. \u201cPreviously, I was keeping this opportunity in abeyance for you. I wanted to protect you. I wanted you to hold on to my jade sword, and upon encountering any danger, you would shatter that jade sword, and I would immediately hurry over to you. Even if you encountered a Zifu Disciple, I would have the power to rescue you. For the sake of my son, it would have been worth it.\u201dNing\u2019s heart was trembling.So the truth was\u2026So the truth was, his father had been planning on this.\u201cBut you no longer need my protection.\u201d Yichuan smiled. \u201cYour mother is dead as well. My Immortal path is shattered. And you are an adult, now. I have nothing holding me back. I will not retreat, this time. This will be the last battle I shall ever fight, and it will also be the most glorious battle of my life. If I die, I would rather die in this battle, die for the sake of the Ji clan!\u201dNing stared at his father, at his father\u2019s smile. His father rarely smiled, but the smile on his father\u2019s face was a very relaxed one. Although Ning felt bitter pain in his heart, he didn\u2019t try to dissuade his father.\u2026\u2026.Of the six, five of the elders were preparing to do battle.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Just as Ning spoke out.Ninefire barked, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for us to go risk our lives, but you, Ji Ning! You are the hope of our Ji clan! Your talent is something which our clan has never given birth to before! You must continue to live!\u201d\u201cPatriarch, I know what you mean.\u201d Ning shook his head. \u201cBut I am not willing to hide and just watch as you risk your lives. I am not willing!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ninefire said, enraged.\u201cBut Patriarch, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not a brash and mindless brute. If I see that the situation is unsalvageable, I will immediately leave and save my own life.\u201d Ning looked at the Patriarch. \u201cI have a Traceless Talisman. I imagine, Patriarch, you know how powerful the Traceless Talisman is. Once I activate it, I will instantly be able to travel to a distance of up to ten thousand kilometers.\u201d Ever since his mother had died, his father had given the Traceless Talisman to Ning.Ninefire was stunned.The Traceless Talisman? Of course he knew that the Ji clan of the West Prefecture had this treasure. He had once desired it, but the Ji clan had its rules which no one could violate.\u201cSince that\u2019s the case.\u201d Ninefire nodded. \u201cFine. You can come along with us. But if the situation grows unsalvageable, you must immediately leave.\u201dAnd thus, right here, within the desolate mountain forest filled with the fog of the bewildering formation, the six members of the Ji clan made their decision. Together, they would battle against Snowdragon Mountain.\u201cThere are only six of us.\u201d Ninefire was actually filled with a boundless martial spirit. \u201cAs for Snowdragon Mountain, after their Swallow Mountain branch suffered such a loss, they will definitely invite some of their fellow disciples from the surrounding branches to come. By then, an entire group of Zifu Disciples will attack us en masse, and perhaps even a Wanxiang Adept might come as well! Fighting them head on is idiocy. What we need to do is to delay. Thus, we must set up multiple layers of formations.\u201d\u201cRight. Formations. Patriarch, you are the most skilled amongst us in formations.\u201d Truekeep was filled with anticipation as well.\u201d\u201cI will set up multiple layers of large formations.\u201d Ninefire looked towards the other five. \u201cLeave the formation setting to me. What the rest of you need to do is come up with ideas to improve your own fighting abilities, such as perhaps using some of the supreme guardian treasures of your respective prefectures\u2026\u201dEveryone nodded.\u201cAlso!\u201dNinefire lowered his head, looking into the ground. \u201cBeneath this desolate wilderness, in an area with a circumference of thousands of kilometers, there lies hidden an enormous elemental ore mine! But the strange thing is, prior to this, nobody had ever discovered it. The vein is very close to the surface, yet nobody discovered it. In addition, previously, there had been such a powerful, forceful elemental energy wave.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Ning nodded as well.Indeed. It had been the elemental energy ripple that had attracted their attention to this place. It was very bizarre.\u201cPerhaps a strange, incredible treasure has just entered the world.\u201d Ninefire said. \u201cThe elemental energy ripple that came prior to this could have been created by the emergence of this unique treasure, which might have caused the surrounding area to transform into an elemental ore mine.\u201d\u201cOr perhaps an Immortal was training here. When Immortals train, the amount of elemental energy they consume is as vast as an ocean.\u201d Ninefire sighed. \u201cIf they train for a long period of time, an elemental ore mine will naturally form.\u201dGranny Shadow frowned. \u201cElder Brother, are you saying\u2026?\u201dNing and the others all looked at Ninefire.\u201cI am guessing.\u201d Ninefire\u2019s eyes held a hint of desire. \u201cThat this elemental ore mine must have a secret behind its origins. Perhaps it has some treasures within, or some precious items left behind by an Immortal! Even items casually discarded by an Immortal\u2026are enough to allow our Ji clan\u2019s power to increase greatly.\u201d\u201cPatriarch, are you suggesting\u2026?\u201d Truekeep grew excited as well.\u201cTreasures?\u201d Yichuan and the others all stared towards the ground.Ninefire nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s dig into the ground and do an investigation. Perhaps we might find something.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dEach of them felt that the words of the Patriarch were reasonable. That elemental energy ripple from earlier had indeed been bizarre, and it was also strange that this elemental ore mine had never been discovered. Perhaps some treasure was hidden within.\u201cJi Ning.\u201d Ninefire looked at Ning. \u201cThat protective lotus technique of yours seems to dig very quickly. It\u2019ll be up to you. We\u2019ll follow from behind you.\u201dNing nodded. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll begin, then.\u201d\u2026\u2026..Rumblerumblerumble\u2026Ning controlled his Waterflame Lotus, making it swivel through the ground, constantly digging deeper into it. Those elemental stones were easily broken through, carving out a tunnel. Ning moved quickly and constantly, digging deeper and deeper, while Ninefire and the rest of the five were behind him.\u201cHis speed is so fast.\u201d Truekeep sighed in amazement, following from behind.\u201cWhen we started digging, we were fast as well, but after exhausting a large amount of our Ki, we had to begin to slow down. But Ji Ning is completely relying on borrowing the power of nature.\u201d Ninefire had already been able to see through Ning\u2019s Waterflame Lotus, and that it was formed from natural power.They continued to go deeper.\u201cJi Ning, wherever the quality of the elemental ore is the finest, that is where you should dig.\u201d Ninefire said. \u201cIf there are any treasures present, they should be located at wherever the elemental energy is the strongest.\u201dNing nodded.He had noticed as well\u2026that different areas had different quality elemental stones. Some places only had low-grade elemental stones, while other places had quite a bit of high-grade elemental stones.\u201cRumblerumblerumble\u2026\u201d The Waterflame Lotus drilled down, like a giant dragon swimming through the underground ore deposit, constantly boring in the direction of high-grade stones.After an hour\u2026\u201cThe majority of stones here are high-grade stones. You can pick them out with ease.\u201d\u201cThis is a precious location.\u201d\u201cSo many high-grade elemental stones.\u201dAlthough they knew all along that this was a rich vein, they hadn\u2019t imagined that this elemental ore mine would actually have a location within it with such an abundance of high-grade elemental stones.\u201cBang!\u201d Suddenly, an explosive sound.Ning came to a sudden halt, causing Ninefire and the other four behind Ning to come to a startled halt as well.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ninefire asked hurriedly.\u201cIn front of me, there is a very tough, unyielding stone. My Waterflame Lotus is actually unable to drill through.\u201d Ning said, puzzled. The power of his Waterflame Lotus was now tremendous, and generally speaking, even forged weapons would be shattered by it, to say nothing of rocks. \u201cIt really is strange.\u201dRumblerumblerumble\u2026The Waterflame Lotus quickly swept away the nearby stones, allowing Ning to get a good luck at what was in front of him; a very flat, rocky surface.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d Ning was puzzled. Ninefire, Yichuan, and the others were puzzled as well.Ning continued to control his Waterflame Lotus to scatter aside the surrounding elemental stones\u2026and soon, what appeared before their eyes was part of an enormous stone room, with a door in front of it.\u201cThis\u2026this\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is a stone room! Manmade! Even Ji Ning\u2019s Waterflame Lotus is unable to break through it. This is no ordinary stone room; it must have been left behind by an Immortal.\u201dThe members of the Ji clan all revealed looks of wild joy on their faces.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDeep within the ground, more than a hundred kilometers down, in the heart of this elemental ore mine, they had discovered a stone room. Who amongst them would believe that it was a common room?\u201cJi Ning, don\u2019t go too close. Beware of restrictive spells.\u201d Ninefire said. \u201cKeep away from it, and control your magic treasures to open the stone door at a distance.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Ning nodded.All of them hurriedly retreated, while Ning directly controlled a sword-type magic treasure, sending it flying outwards and pushing at the stone door. Rumble\u2026the stone door slowly turned, revealing an entrance. Instantly, an incomparably thick surge of elemental essence spurted out from within that stone room, causing Ning and the rest of them to feel incredibly comfortable.\u201cThere must be Immortal treasures within.\u201d Ninefire called out frantically.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could feel the Xiantian ki in his dantian rumble as it continuously grew. \u201cWhat pure, dense elemental energy. The elemental energy released just by opening the door to this stone room is already so dense\u2026then what about inside the room?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go in rashly. There might be danger within.\u201d Ji Ninefire hurriedly warned. \u201cI\u2019ll release a bug to go investigate inside.\u201dNinefire opened his mouth, and a black wasp immediately flew out, quickly flying through the stone door and darting into the stone room. After a span of time of ten breaths, the black wasp flew back out, and Ninefire swallowed it once more into his body.\u201cHow is it?\u201dEach of them looked at Patriarch Ninefire, who just laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve finished my investigation. There\u2019s no danger at all within. Come, let\u2019s go take a look! You follow behind me. Even if there are dangers hidden within the stone room that I could not detect, I will be the first to die. Ji Ning, you walk in the very back!\u201d\u201cRight. Ji Ning needs to stay in the back.\u201d Each of them looked towards Ning.There was nothing Ning could do. He didn\u2019t argue, instead just docilely following from behind. Ninefire and Granny Shadow were in the very front, and as soon as they entered, the sound of their delighted, amazed cries rang out. \u201cWhat a treasure! What a treasure!\u201d \u201cThis place definitely was a place where an Immortal trained. Definitely!\u201dNing, hearing this, had an itchy feeling in his heart. What exactly was inside?\u201cYou can all come in. I\u2019ve swept it with my Ki. There\u2019s no danger.\u201d Ninefire said.Immediately, everyone entered, and even Ning hurriedly followed them inside.\u201cWhat thick elemental energy.\u201d This was the first thing Ning sensed when he entered; that there was an incomparably dense, natural elemental energy in this place, causing all of the pores of his body to swell open and welcome it, absorbing as much of it as they could. The entire room seemed to be filled with a visible, verdant aura off life energy. This was a natural color which would appear once natural elemental energy reached a certain density.\u201cJi Ning, shut the stone door. Don\u2019t let this elemental energy leak out. This stone room is rather special. Once the door is shut, the elemental energy won\u2019t leak out.\u201d Ninefire said.\u201cYes.\u201d Ning understood this as well. Prior to this, it was only when he had pushed the stone door open that the elemental energy had leaked out. Rumble\u2026the stone door shut.Ning looked curiously in detail at his surroundings.This room was thirty meters in diameter. There was even a door nearby; there should be other rooms within as well.\u201cLook.\u201d Ninefire pointed at a large pool, which was filled with a layer of thin green liquid. The green liquid was slowly swirling, filled with boundless life energy. The reason why the air here was emanating that incomparably dense elemental energy was because the liquid was releasing it into the air.\u201cI am absolutely certain.\u201d Ninefire said confidently. \u201cThat it definitely was an Immortal in training who caused this elemental ore mine to be formed. He intentionally set down a formation to summon a boundless amount of natural elemental energy from the surrounding area. After many years of accumulated energy, the elemental ore mine was formed. But to an Immortal, what is necessary isn\u2019t elemental stones, but rather, this\u2026\u201dNinefire pointed at the water pool filled with the layer of green liquid, incomparably certain. \u201cLiquefied elemental essence! This is the true essence of natural elemental energy, extremely pure liquefied elemental essence!\u201dNing and the others held their breaths.Liquefied elemental essence?If one described the elemental energy contained within high-grade elemental stones as \u2018very pure\u2019 and as being not very burdensome to the body, and capable of increasing training speed tenfold, then liquefied elemental essence\u2026was the purest form of elemental essence, which place no strain on the body whatsoever. One could completely absorb and convert it within a short period of time.For example, some Immortals, after being reincarnated, would lose their memories and become ordinary mortals. Once they regained their memories, however, based on the insights they had gained into the heavenly Dao, as well as the power of their souls, they could for example obtain and make use of a legendary \u2018Nine Cycles Golden Pill\u2019, which contained an ocean\u2019s worth of elemental energy, and which also placed no burden on the body, allowing one to quickly absorb it all within a short period of time.Once a reincarnated Immortal regained his memory and swallowed a \u2018Nine Cycles Golden Pill\u2019, then just by relying on the natural elemental energy contained within the pill\u2026he would be able to once again become an Immortal within a single day!To improve in one\u2019s training?Strengthen one\u2019s soul! One\u2019s level of understanding! One\u2019s techniques! Elemental energy! Not a single one of these four could be lacking! As for reincarnated Immortals, it was because they possessed the first three already, which was why they could rely on a single \u2018Nine Cycles Golden Pill\u2019 to instantly become an Immortal. If they didn\u2019t have the Nine Cycles Golden Pill, even reincarnated Immortals would have to slowly, step by step train and rise in power. As for ordinary mortals, if they swallowed a \u2018Nine Cycles Golden Pill\u2019, they would be instantly exploded by the sea of elemental energy the pill contained!The Nine Cycles Golden Pill\u2026was the stuff of legends.But Ning had read about liquefied elemental essence in books before. Liquefied elemental essence, in sufficient quantities, could be comparable to a Nine Cycles Golden Pill.\u201cThe Immortal who trained here\u2026\u201d Ninefire said excitedly. \u201cHe definitely had accumulated a large amount of liquefied elemental essence here. Because of his training, he had already used up the vast majority of it, leaving behind only this thin layer. But even just this thin layer\u2026is perhaps comparable to the entire wealth of our Ji clan. And in addition, even if our Ji clan had the wealth to buy something like this, we still wouldn\u2019t be able to.\u201dEveryone present was excited.They all understood that liquefied elemental essence would allow a person to avoid spending a long period of time in absorbing and refining energy! Thus, it had long ago been monopolized by large sects and large clans. They might gift it to some truly monstrous talents, or some top-tier experts, making it so that they wouldn\u2019t have to waste too much time in slowly refining elemental energy. How could the Ji clan possibly be able to buy something like this?\u201d\u201cPatriarch, with this, will you be able to break through to the Wanxiang Adept stage?\u201d Ning asked hurriedly.\u201cOur Ji clan\u2019s training methods are fairly poor.\u201d Ninefire shook his head. \u201cIn theory, I can break through, but in reality, our Ji clan, from past to present, has never produced a single Wanxiang Adept! I\u2019ve trained for nearly four centuries now. If it were possible for me to become a Wanxiang Adept, I would\u2019ve broken through long ago. This liquefied elemental essence is useless to me, or for your Granny Shadow. But for you, Ji Ning, it has quite a bit of use!\u201d\u201cRight. Ji Ning, you are the most suitable person for usig it.\u201d Granny Shadow looked at Ning as well, her eyes filled with expectation. \u201cYou are such a genius. In truth, for you to have been born to our Ji clan has resulted in the Ji clan holding you back. You have to waste so much time in slowly accumulating elemental ki energy. If you were born within some top-tier clans, you would train much more quickly than you have thus far.\u201d\u201cJi Ning, use it.\u201d Yichuan said as well. \u201cDon\u2019t be hesitant and shy. I know exactly what level you are on. In terms of insight, most likely all of us are at least a level bellow you. By relying on this liquefied elemental essence, you absolutely can reach a higher level.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Truekeep, Ninefire, and the others all looked eagerly towards Ning.Ning felt a warm feeling in his heart.Such a treasure\u2026And yet, they were all leaving it for him.\u201cPatriarch, I won\u2019t be shy then.\u201d Ning said directly. \u201cI\u2019ll immediately take the liquefied elemental essence and begin to train.\u201d It would be hard for him to break through as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and even if he wanetd to try, he needed the power of the Sun and the Moon\u2026and so, this liquefied elemental essence was more suited for him in training as a Ki Refiner. He had reached the necessary level of insight long ago; he absolutely could establish his Zifu foundation!\u201cGood.\u201d Ninefire and the others were filled with excitement and anticipation. To them, this liquefied elemental essence would only be able to raise their power by a limited amount. But to the most monstrously talented member of the Ji clan, Ji Ning\u2026it would most likely increase his power tremendously.\u201cI\u2019ll go look at the other rooms and see if there\u2019s anything else we can use.\u201d Ninefire said hurriedly.There was the other room nearby.In that room, there was only a stone bed, a stone chair, and a stone table. Nothing else.\u201cIt seems this place was just the place where the Immortal shut himself in for training, while this other room was the study where the Immortal would rest and flip through Immortal manuals.\u201d Ninefire said. \u201cThe other room is a room where the Immortal actually trained.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else.\u201d\u201cNo other treasures.\u201dYichuan and the others took a careful look as well, but this stone room just had a primary room and a side room. It was very simple and plain, and one could tell at a glance that there was nothing else here. They used their ki energy to sweep it as well, but couldn\u2019t find any hiding places for treasures.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Ninefire and the others returned to the main room. They looked at Ning, then instructed, \u201cJi Ning, you remain here and train. Remember, shut the stone door. There\u2019s a secret mechanism above the door. Once you shut the door, no one outside will be able to open it. We\u2019ll wait aboveground for you.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d Ning nodded.Ninefire and the others all quickly left, leaving only Ning behind in the stone room. Ning pushed the door shut, locking it in place.Training was something very important. One had to be very careful. Otherwise, if one was disturbed at an important point during the training, it would be very dangerous.\u201cThis time\u2026I should be able to establish my Zifu.\u201d Ning looked at the pool, filled with that spiritual liquefied elemental essence. He didn\u2019t hesitate any further, immediately sitting down next to the pool and immediately activating his [Water Element Art] technique. The [Water Element Art], although a very basic technique, was one in which establishing the Zifu was simple.However, after establishing his Zifu, Ning needed to change to a different type of Ki Refining technique. Otherwise, just by relying on this poor technique, it would be quite difficult for him to become a Wanxiang Adept. In theory, it was possible, but only in theory. As for becoming a Primal Daoist? Even in theory, it was impossible!However, Ning wasn\u2019t impatient. He primarily trained as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, after all. In the future, he would also leave Swallow Mountain. Naturally, he would be able to acquire a higher level technique.\u201cRumble\u2026\u201d Ning activated the [Water Element Art], and immediately began to absorb the elemental energy nearby. The elemental energy within this stone room was simply too dense, and it constantly condensed into Ki.Ning opened his mouth.Absorb!Immediately, part of the liquefied elemental essence within the pool flew up into the air. Controlled by Ning\u2019s divine will, the essence flew straight into Ning\u2019s mouth and entered his body. As soon as the liquefied elemenetal essence entered his body\u2026it instantly transformed into elemental energy. The incomparably pure elemental energy constantly circulated within his dantian, transforming directly into elemental ki energy. It was successful at a single go! It didn\u2019t place any stress on his body at all. Ning could constantly, unceaselessly continue to absorb and transform this energy.\u201cRumble\u2026\u201d The green water-type ki in his dantian began to surge about like endless, vast waves, wildly swirling and constantly accumulating!\u201cAgain.\u201d Ning once more opened his mouth, drawing some liquefied elemental essence into his body.A massive wave of energy arose within his dantian. His elemental ki energy, which originally needed a long period of time to slowly accumulate, quickly reached a limit. Boundless amounts of elemental energy swirled ferociously in his dantian under great pressure, as though the space in his dantian was too small, unable to contain so much elemental energy.Rumble\u2026Instantly, something happened, like when Pangu split open the primordial chaos and created the heavens and the earth! The chaotic, monocolored dantian suddenly exploded!In the area around Ning, who had been quietly seated in the lotus position by the side of the pool, a large amount of watery mist suddenly arose out of nowhere. In this moment, he could so very clearly sense the \u2018Dao\u2019, but soon afterwards, the feeling disappearing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI established my Zifu! Now that my Zifu is established, I have my foundation for continuing my training as an Immortal practitioner.\u201d Ning said softly to himself.Within his body, in the location where the dantian had previously been.This was now a vast, empty, boundless space. This vast, empty space contained a limitless amount of violet ki which filled it. This strange location, quasi-real and quasi-imaginery, was the Violet Palace! Every single person, upon establishing their Zifu Violet Palace, would have the same thing. However, as to what sort of level a person would be able to train to in the future, that depended on each person\u2019s destiny and techniques.\u201cAbsorb!\u201d Ning opened his mouth, and more liquefied elemental essence from the watery pool into Ning\u2019s body like water.The vast, spread-out space with violet ki instantly had the first drop of elemental ki formed from it. Soon, a large amount of ki was constantly coalescing. Within this boundless, empty, illusory void, a small pool began to form, which quickly transformed into a small pond\u2026elemental ki continued to solidify and accumulate, and the size of the pond continued to grow as well\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26 \u2013 Stormclouds ApproachingJi Ning was seated next to the pool of water in the lotus position. His aura was like that of savage waves crashing down. He continued to open his mouth, absorbing the liquefied soul essence within the pool, causing that layer of liquefied essence to quickly deplete.But suddenly, Ning shut his mouth.\u201cWhew.\u201dA smile on his face, Ning opened his eyes. He glanced at the green, liquefied soul essence in the pool. \u201cIt let me break through as a peak Xiantian expert, allowing me to establish my Zifu, then solidify my base as an early Zifu Disciple. It has saved me at least a year or two of effort. I used up a third of the liquefied essence!\u201dIn a short period of time, just long enough to boil a pot of tea, not only had he established his Zifu, he had also solifidied his base. Even Ning, at his astonishing rate of improvement, would have needed a year or two.If I use the remaining two thirds of liquefied essence to train, I might be able to reach the mid-stage as a Zifu Disciple.\u201d Ning understood that since he had already stabilized his base as an early Zifu Disciple, by relying on the remaining liquefied essence, he absolutely had the possibility of breaking through again, but if he really were to rely on the [Water Element Art] to train to the mid-stage as a Zifu Disciple, his future Ki Refining path would become difficult.After all, the [Water Element Art] was a very low-class technique. It was fine to use it to establish a Zifu, because every person\u2019s Zifu was the same. But if Ning was to use it to break through to the middle of the Zifu level? There would be a very negative effective on the purity of his elemental energy. This single wrong step would be something which he would be unable to undo in the future. In the future, it would become ten times or a hundred times more difficult for him to become a Wanxiang Adept.\u201cI\u2019ve already made a large leap forward and become a Zifu Disciple! Even if I break through to become a mid-stage Zifu Disciple, the amount of benefit I would see in terms of power would be limited.\u201d Ning pondered to himself. Leaping to a new level was a qualitative transformation! But a small leap within the same level didn\u2019t have that much of an impact on his power.Xiantian lifeforms could dominate Houtiane experts.Zifu Disciples could dominate Xiantian lifeforms!Even an early Zifu Disciple could still dominate most peak Xiantian lifeforms. This was a qualitative difference. To battle someone at a higher level? Difficult!But if an early Zifu Disciple were to battle a mid-stage Zifu Disciple\u2026it would be hard to say who the victor was. This sort of small gap within the same level didn\u2019t result in huge differences in strength.\u201cEven if I use up the remaining liquid, the amount of power I would gain would be limited, and it would destroy my future path. Not worth it.\u201d With a flip of his hand, Ning made a talisman appear, which had a Fiendgod word on it; \u2018Right\u2019. This was the control talisman for the Aquatic Manor. Ning stared at it, an eager light flickering in his eyes. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve established my Zifu, and I am confident that if I were to meet Dong Ziqi again, I would be able to suppress him and perhaps even kill him\u2026this time, I will have to face not just Dong Ziqi by himself, but an entire group of Snowdragon Mountain experts.\u201d\u201cI hope this Aquatic Manor\u2026will allow my power to rise to a new level.\u201d\u201cGiven that this Aquatic Manor was able to produce the likes of Immortal Juhua, it should be extraordinary.\u201d Ning said eagerly. A drop of green elemental ki passed from his hand into the talisman, quickly binding it.A surge of ancient-feeling power seemed to awaken, causing Ning to feel the desire to worship it from the depths of his heart.\u201cWhat a fellow.\u201d Ningn stared at the talisman. \u201cI really wonder who the first master of the Aquatic Manor was.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dNing immediately arose, while at the same time, with a flip of his hand, he produced a palm-sized jade bottle. This was an unranked magic treasure. Although it was the size of his palm, it was able to contain within it thousands of kilograms of fine wine. Ning had quite a few storage-type magic treasures like this one. For example, when Ning had undergone the Fiendgod Bloodforging process in the Aquatic Manor, he had used one such gourd to contain a thousand kilograms of blood.\u201cGo in.\u201d Ning stared at the liquefied elemental essence in the pool. Summoning his divine will, ripple, ripple\u2026the liquefied essence rose into the air, passing through the neck of the jade bottle. Every single drop was put in, leaving not a single drop remaining.\u201cI wonder which Immortal left behind this stone room.\u201d Ning, before leaving, took a final glance around the room. \u201cIt has caused such a calamity to my Ji clan, but it also allowed me to establish my Zifu in advance.\u201dNing understood in his heart that this wasn\u2019t the fault of that Immortal; if he had to blame someone, he could only blame the Ji clan for being too weak.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dHe left the stone room. Ning then used his Waterflame Lotus, which swiveled about him, carving a path straight out from within this elemental ore mine. He quickly charged upwards at a constant pace. Ning knew that it would take some time for him to charge a hundred kilometers upwards, and so two magic treasures appeared in his hands; one was a palm-sized flying boat magic treasure, while the other was a pair of black wing-type magic treasures.The flying boat had belonged to Bei Zishan, while the black wings had belonged to Ju San. They were both ranked magic treasures.\u201cNow that I\u2019ve reached the Zifu level! I am able to use these ranked magic treasures.\u201d Ning understood that when reaching a new level, one benefit was a qualitative improvement to his personal strength, while another benefit was that the type of magic treasures he could use had also risen. These two benefits, combined, made it so that Zifu Disciples could absolutely dominate Xiantian lifeforms.\u2026\u2026..Boom!A petal of the Waterflame Lotus burst forth from the ground, with Ning behind it.\u201cJi Ning.\u201d In the distance were Ji Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and the others. They had long since dispersed and recollected the surrounding bewildering formation, and the sight of the desolate mountain forests had returned. Only, in parts of the forest, the traces of the earlier battle could still be seen.\u201cPatriarch. Father.\u201d Ning hurriedly walked over.\u201cYou came out quite quickly. We just arrived on the surface not long ago.\u201d Ninefire and the other four walked over, laughing. \u201cTruekeep just emerged moments ago as well.\u201dNing thought about it. He had been in training for as much time as it takes to brew a pot of tea; the amount of time he had spent boring through the ground had actually been greater than that. The Patriarch and the others had most likely had to spend more time boring through the ground than he did\u2026and so, doing the math, it seemed as though they probably really did emerge at roughly the same time.\u201cRight, Ji Ning.\u201d Ninefire asked. \u201cPrior to this, when you killed Ju San. What magic treasures did you acquire?\u201d\u201cQuite a few.\u201d Ning said.The nearby Grany Shadow explained in detail, \u201cWe need to do an accounting of these treasures, to see who they are most useful for. This is the easiest way to put them to good use.\u201dNing nodded. \u201cJusan had one flying transportation magic treasure, one storage magic treasure, one protective magic treasure, one magic greataxe, and a pair of magic wings! The magic wings are useful to me, but the others are not.\u201d Ning had already acquired a ranked storage magic treasure, a transportation magic treasure, and a protective magic treasure from Bei Zishan. Thus, only this pair of ranked wing-type magic treasures was useful for him.\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d Ninefire looked at Ning.\u201cSwords!\u201d Ning said. \u201cI only need ranked flying swords. Other things are useless to me. The more ranked flying swords, the better.\u201dHis two sources of combat power were close quarters combat and the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].In particular, now that he had established his Zifu, the power of his [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] had naturally grown only greater. However, if he continued to use unranked swords\u2026his power would most likely only rise by one or two levels. If, however, he was able to completely exchange them for ranked swords, Ning felt that he would probably be able to give even a Wanxiang Adept a good fight.\u201cRanked flying swords? The more the better?\u201d Ninefire, Granny Shadow, the old servant Ah Xing, and Yichuan all repeated softly, then offered one or two flying swords each.\u201cAll together, we have five flying swords that we don\u2019t need for now.\u201d Ninefire looked at Ning. \u201cIs it enough?\u201dNing was rather disappointed.Five?Useless.His [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] required at least nine swords to be used together in order to work and creation a formation base! And nine formations bases were required for each [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] formation! In other words, the smallest unit, the \u2018formation base\u2019, required at least nine ranked swords. And, to make his [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] truly transform in power, he needed at least eighty one ranked flying swords. Only by using them as the foundation would the power of the other, unranked swords become truly explosive.But of course, the ideal solution would be to only use ranked flying swords\u2026According to Ning\u2019s calculations, if he only used ranked flying swords, he would only be able to use the third level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. But the power of it would be incomparably greater than before! Quality was even more important than quantity!\u201cHow many do you need?\u201d Ninefire asked.\u201cI need seven ranked flying swords. The more, the better. If I had several hundred, it would be even better.\u201d Ning laughed. Sword-type magic treasures were very common; Ning had acquired a pair of ranked flying swords from Bei Zishan alone. If they could come up with another seven, then Ning would have nine in total, enough for a single, smallest unit \u2018formation base\u2019. With this formation base as the core, the power of the entire [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] would double or triple!\u201cSeveral hundred?\u201d Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and the others were all shocked. However, when they thought back to the scene of Ning utilizing the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], they realized that he did indeed have seven hundred plus flying swords swirling around him. It seemed as though Ning really did indeed need a large number of flying swords. But several hundred ranked magic treasures? Even if the entire Ji clan bankrupted itself, it wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it.\u201cWe\u2019ll strive to help you come up with seven more swords.\u201d Ninefire said, then changed the subject. \u201cSnowdragon Mountain will publicize this to their comrades. Most likely, they will come for battle in a day or two. Before this, you can all go back and pick up any treasures that you need or take care of any matters that need addressing. Afterwards, we will regroup here.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSwoosh!Ninefire, Granny Shadow, and Ah Xing mounted an enormous wine gourd, quickly disappearing into the horizon, leaving behind only Ning and his father.Ning understood that this was rather like taking care of one\u2019s post-mortem affairs.\u201cFather, will you return to West Prefecture City?\u201d Ning looked at his father.\u201cNo. To Serpentwing Lake.\u201d Yichuan shook his head. \u201cI want to visit Little White. The two of us are like brothers who have shared life and death together. No matter what, I have to see him again.\u201d Yichuan had stayed for five years at Serpentwing Lake, and the Whitewater Hound had stayed with him this entire time.\u201cUncle White?\u201d Ning nodded gently.The Godbeast \u2018Whitewater Hound\u2019 had an extremely close relationship Ning\u2019s father. They had adventured together to as far as the Darknorth Sea. The time they had spent together was even longer than the time Ning\u2019s father and mother had spent together. Indeed, they really were lifelong brothers.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d A flying boat appeared beneath Ning\u2019s feet, and Yichuan mounted it as well.Whoosh!The flying boat instantly rose into the air, quickly passing through the skies and into the clouds\u2026Swallow Mountain had a total of ten commandery cities. Snowdragon Mountain had three of them, which were similar to the commandery city the Ji clan controlled, the \u2018City of Ten Thousand Swords\u2019. As soon as Dong Ziqi had invaded Swallow Mountain, he had given the name of the city he had taken over the name of \u2018Snowdragon City\u2019, so as to let everyone know that this was a branch of Snowdragon Mountain!Although afterwards, they had taken over two more commandery cities, the heart of this branch of Snowdragon Mountain remained in Snowdragon City.\u201cWhere are they? Where are the others?In the air above Snowdragon Mountain, three figures stood there atop a flying screen, staring into the distance as a greef leaf hurtled through the air, with Dong Ziqi and Muse standing atop it.\u201cWhere are the other three? All dead?\u201d These three figures asked frantically. The three of them were the three other Zifu Disciples of the Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain. They were of the \u2018Ju\u2019 clan and the \u2018Dong\u2019 clan. Earlier, the Zifu Disciple belonging to the Ju clan, Ju Nianxiong, had seen that his nephew\u2019s life-talisman had shattered, and so he had hurried over to Snowdragon Mountain. The two elders of the Dong clan were terrified upon hearing this, knowing that something must have gone wrong.But they didn\u2019t expect that not only had Ju San died, even the He siblings had died.\u201cThey died. My three fellow disciples all died.\u201d Dong Ziqi gritted his teeth. \u201cIt was the Ji clan. They set up a formation early on, then suddenly attacked, causing us to be caught offguard. My three fellow disciples were ganged upon and killed one by one. With the He siblings dead, most likely that official writ was taken away as well.Three commandery cities. They were split up between the Dong clan, the He clan, and the Ju clan. One of the official writs had been carried by the He siblings.\u201cThe Ji clan is asking for death!\u201d Ju Nianxiong\u2019s eyes were bloodshot.The nearby Muse said in a cold voice, \u201cThis time, due to the elemental ripples, we went to go investigate. We discovered that there was an enormous elemental ore mine within the Ji clan\u2019s territory, with a large number of high-grade elemental stones. The entire quarry has a circumference of four thousand kilometers and a depth of three hundred kilometers.\u201cWhat!\u201dNianxiong and the two elders of the Dong clan were badly startled.\u201cThe Ji clan wasn\u2019t willing to hand it over, so we ended up in a battle.\u201d Ziqi forced the words out.The shorter of the two elders of the Dong clan howled in a furious voice, \u201cThe main sect desperately needs an enormous elemental ore mine such as this! If we offer it to the main sect\u2026this will be a great merit for us. The Ji clan actually dares to oppose Snowdragon Mountain? Then we\u2019ll destroy the Ji clan, we\u2019ll annihilate them all!!!\u201d\u201cOf course we\u2019ll annihilate their clan!\u201d Ziqi\u2019s eyes flashed with a cold light. \u201cBut what I fear the most is that the Ji clan will sign a transfer agreement with the Grand Xia Dynasty.\u201dThe two Dong elders and Ju Nianxiong both paused. If a transfer agreement truly was signed, then even Snowdragon Mountain wouldn\u2019t dare to interfere. Challenge the Grand Xia Dynasty? Did they want to die?\u201cBut the Ji clan needs to first make the report, then await the arrival of the Celestial Envoy of the Grand Xia Dynasty. It will take at least three days. If we can do our best to delay, we can delay for a period of time.\u201d Ziqi said hurriedly. \u201cSo we have to hurry. We have to invite our comrades and have them arrive at Swallow Mountain as fast as possible, so that we can annihilate the Ji clan together.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Everyone nodded.The Ji clan had killed three of their Zifu Disciples, leaving them only five. If they went and fought all out, even if the won, most likely most of them would die. No matter how great the merit they rendered would be, they had to be alive to win plaudits for it.\u201cThe four of you, go invite the various Snowdragon Mountain branches nearest to us.\u201d Ziqi said. \u201cI myself will head to Swallow Mountain City to meet with the garrison general, and ask him to delay as long as possible.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The four nodded.\u201cInvite a few dozen comrades. By then, with dozens of us together\u2026we will utterly crush and annihilate the Ji clan with ease.\u201d Ziqi said. \u201cThere\u2019s virtually no danger when we join together into a group, and everyone will have a share of the glory.
