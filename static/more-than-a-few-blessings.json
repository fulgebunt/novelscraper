As a result, his life was meaningless and died after graduating from college.(Chengyu* = Cheng is to carry and Yu is extra. I don't really know it. Maybe it's to receive more? It's hard to guess)He sat in the public seat, looking at a pair of lover's walking in front of him that makes his eyes blind. After a long time he patted the dust that didn't exist on his clothes and walk slowly in the dormitory building.Clean shirt and sweater vest, fitted jeans and casual shoes, a very ordinary dress, but it makes Lu Chengyu looks clean and respectable, making the girls look at him a few times.Greeting his acquaintances along the way to the dormitory, his roommates were playing in the room. One of his roommates saw him and didn't turn his head to ask him, \"Third*, where have you been? Old four* was looking for you just now.\"(Third* = I guess it's there ranking in the room, third is Lu Chengyu who's the third older in the room.)(old Four* = As I said it's the order of their age but it has a laosi/old in it.)\"Just go out and walk,\" who would have thought that he's dead and suddenly finds himself lying in the dormitory bedroom, he can't calm down. However, for his own image, he had no choice but to stroll outside the dormitory quietly to vent his shocked and ecstatic mood.As for the old four Chen Jin who Second Zhang Hong mentioned, he don't know what to say to this person.

He sat across the chair and lifted his chin, \"Didn't you always takes care of Chen Jin? He was looking for you just now. We also couldn't get through your cell phone. You've comeback now, at least give him a call.\"\"Okay,\" Lu Chengyu took out his cell phone, went in front of Zhang Hao's computer and gave Chen Jin a call. He look closer to the computer desktop and look at the game that Zhang Hao played and uninterestedly ask, \"You're still playing this game, did you find a work yet?\"\"I'll went to the same company with Guang Lin and will report on monday, How about you?\" Zhang Hong knew that Lu Chengyu is not interested in the game and threw him an orange in the table. \"What's the matter? We're brother's you don't have to be polite.\" A year ago, Lu Chengyu's parents had an accident. Although there was a compensation, but he's alone without his parent's, his life is not that good.\"There's nothing wrong with work. I'm your brother so there's no way I'll be polite to you!\" Lu Chengyu smiled and patted Zhang Hao's shoulder. Then he peeled the orange in his hands and said, \"I'm going to move out tomorrow. How about having a meal together tonight?\"\"Move out tomorrow?\" Zhu Guanglin, who has been paying attention to the game and look at him. Lu Chengyu didn't see Chen Jin around and said, \"Yes, I'll wait for Cheng Jin to come back.\" Chen Jin is introverted. Although they are a good people, but they did not have much contact with Chen Jin. In addition, Chen Jin's family's conditions are not very good. They are willing to help him but they also consider his pride. Therefore, in the past four years, their relationship with Chen Jin is more moderate and\u00a0 less intimate.Lu Chengyu always pays attention to him. It will be good for a while but it can't be always.Lu Chengyu always acts like a gentleman, so he takes care of Chen Jin. Among his three roommates, Chen Jin is the most close to Lu Chengyu. Therefore, he also wants Cheng Jin to join them.After hearing Zhu Guanglin mention Chen Jin's name, Lu Chengyu nodded his head. After he refused Chen Jin in the past life, he did not often see him. Whenever he see Chen Jin, he was always in bad luck. This is really a miserable reminder and a strange thing. He can't also blame him.In the evening, with white shirt and casual suit, Lu Chengyu and his three roommates ordered a table of dishes in the restaurant outside the campus and drink a lot of wine. Upon returning to the dormitory, Zhu Guanglin and Zhang Hao sleep like a dead. Lu Chengyu shook his head and brush his teeth. he just look back and see Chen Jin's pair of good-looking and wet eyes looking at him. He suddenly feel that bad things will happen.\"Lu Chengyu, we have been living in the same dormitory room, why did you always take care of me?\" Che Jin lean against the door and stood unsteadily.\"We are cla.s.smates. We should take care of each other, right?\" Lu Chengyu put down his toothbrush and cup in his hands and tried to squeeze past Che Jin's side. He didn't really want to hear this confession.\"If I say... I like you, do you believe it?\"\"I don't believe!\"Chen Jin, \"...\"After a moment of silence, Chen Jin smile and said, \"I know you don't believe me, but I'm serious.\"Lu Chengyu walk in front of him and pat Chen Jin's shoulder. \"Okay, you don't have to joke about this between your buddies.\" He took his\u00a0cell phone\u00a0in his pocket pants and show it in front of Chen Jin. \"Today is April fool's day.\"Chen Jin look at the date displayed on the mobile phone. It is April 1st and he look at the casual expression of the person in front of him. His original tension turned into anger, \"Lu Chengyu, we have been getting along for many years, didn't you know me? You don't have to accept my confession, but don't trample my heart.\"Pushing away the cell phone in front of him, Chen Jin turn and walk away to the door and suddenly stop. He turn to look at Lu Chengyu with a force smile on his face and gritted his teeth, \"Since you don't want to accept me then don't be good to me! If I knew that this day would come. I would rather not know you four years ago and did not live in the same dorm with you.\" After that, he opened the dormitory door and walked out without hesitation.Listening to the heavily closing of the door, Lu Chengyu rub his face with his hands. what did he do? Not to say that he is not interested in men, even if he likes men, it is not good if its Chen Jin. When he saw Chen Jin's family is not in a good situation, going to university is also not easy. Therefore, he took care of him. Now it became his fault.He lay back to his bed and pull the quilt in his body. He is somewhat confuse, Chen Jin ran away in the middle of the night before causing him to worry overnight. As a result, the second day of his interview failed but in the end it was Chen Jin who pa.s.sed in the company. The president's child of that company later became Chen Jin's partner, Liang Deyou. Looking back on this things, Lu Chengyu felt that life was a h.e.l.l pot of dog blood.The next day, Lu Chengyu accompanied by his two buddies, move his things to a taxi. When he is about to leave, he see Chen Jin go out from a private car. The person who is in the driving seat is Liang Deyou.Lu Chengyu has no intention of saying h.e.l.lo to the two of them and bent over to get into the taxi but was stop by Chen Jin. He look back at the two men walking towards him and said something to the taxi driver. He stand and leaned back against the door elegantly.\"you are Lu Chengyu?\" Liang Deyou look at him with a smile and slowly extend his hand to lu Chengyu. 'My surname is Liang, Xiao Jin's friend. h.e.l.lo.\"\"h.e.l.lo.\" Lu Chengyu reach out and held out his hand and quickly took it back. Although his life is not good in his past life, but his ability to being polite is perfect. Otherwise, it is not easy being a looby manager of a luxury hotel. Although his action's are polite, it also reveal a high taste.Chen Jin did not notice the hidden meaning of Liang Deyou's action. he only look at Lu Chengyu, \"You're moving and didn't even tell me?\"\"When we had dinner together last night, didn't I say that I was leaving the dorm today?\" lu Chengyu hook his lips. \"Since you're back to school, I'm relieve. I'll go first.\"Chen Jin saw the smile on his face and could not help but ask, \"Is there really no possibility between us?\"Lu Chengyu look at Liang Deyou. The man's face is not very good. He touch his chin and said, \"Chen Jin, we have been cla.s.smates for four years, don't waste our friendship.\"\"Okay, I understand.\" Chen Jin look pale and stare at Lu Chengyu deeply and finally turn away. When Liang Deyou saw this, he glare at Lu Chengyu and follow up.Zhao Hong and Zhu Guanglin notice that something was wrong. but the two of them were closer to lu Chengyu and Lu Chengyu did not say anything. They naturally would not ask.\"Well, I'm going first. Take care and when you're free, we'll go and drink together again.\" Lu Chengyu chicly wave and sat on the taxi and close the door. he wave his hand again to his two buddies and said, \"Mister, please drive.\"\"Well,\" said the taxi driver who has been impatient for a while. After a short distance he said, \"Are you graduating this year?\"\"Yes,\" lu Chengyu look up at the driver's seat and smile. \"I'm sorry for letting mister wait for me.\"\"It's okay,\" he wave his right hand and skillfully turned the steering wheel on the other hand. The car quickly turn in a corner. \"I see that boy is interested in you. Not that i'm a big talker, but I'll tell you don't go that way, looking at you young man being so handsome, what kind of girlfriend can not find?\"Lu Chengyu said oh. You're thinking like that mister, did your wife know?\"Oh, don't worry about this. I've been driving for years. I've seen a lot of men and women fighting in the car. Also crying and resentment, being married is also unreliable. Not to mention both men,\" the driver feeling good about his advice and continue \"However, my wife is still very reliable.\"Lu Chengyu continues to says oh. Uncle, you say so much is to show love?After getting off, the driver also deliberately reduce Lu Chengyu's taxi fare by five dollars and drove away at the fastest speed as a plane.Lu Chengyu was sprayed in the face with the cars exhaust gases and sigh.

It is one of the rapidly growing area so the housing estate price here is not low and the sorrounding's conditions are also good. Lu Chengyu's parent's bought a house here. When they bought it, they told him that it was for him and his wife to be. As a result, the house had just renovated and his parent's died unexpectedly.Inside the elevator, he press the b.u.t.ton and there were a few people who greets each other. Lu Chengyu didn't know anyone here, in the 6th floor he left the elevator and take out the key to open the door.After cleaning the empty room, Lu Chengyu take out his laptop and plug in the network cable. He listens to a few random songs and went to the balcony. He found that his cactus is still alive and he pour a little water in it. After that, he lean against the balcony fence and look at the rockery that sprays a water in the middle of the district. He suddenly feel down.His parents were intellectual. Later his father resigned from being a teacher to became a company department manager while his mother is a university professor. So when choosing a new house, it is very important that it is an eco friendly community. But the both of them didn't get to stay in the new house but instead died. His uncles and aunts and the other family didn't calculate/took what his parents left for him and it was also another kind of kindness. After all, he didn't have a parents anymore. And the others also have a child to care about, not to mention he is no longer a child.He calls the water company to send him a pure water and sat in front of the computer and found some information that he wants use. Lu Chengyu touch his chin in thoughts. He had already graduated for almost nine years when he pa.s.sed away but it is in such a short span of nine years that the economy has developed rapidly and several leading companies are already the most widely known. In their reunion, Chen Jin is the manager at Liang's branch office and was touted by everyone and mentioned the momentum of several companies. It seems that the development of Liang's was very good.He didn't know anything about his parent's death that year so he would go to Liang's interview when he was about to graduate. A few years later, in Liang's arrogant appearance and sneer, he finally knew that his parent's who had been killed by falling objects and crashed in to their car were in the site of Liang's estate company.This incident happened because the construction safety measures are not correct. Therefore, the court decided to sentenced the construction company to take responsibility and compensate Lu Chengyu in a large amount of money. However, who will be happy to take this large sum of money in exchange of their loved ones lives?He later met Chen Jin and Liang Deyou in the hotel for honeymoon and Liang Deyou spoke in contempt. At that time he thought, how could there be a d.a.m.n thing in this world. Because of love Liang Deyou was jealous without a reason, he talked to him like he was a garbage and thinks high of himself. He thinks his lover, Chen Jin, as a saint. This kind of stupid man thought he was a protagonist of a romantic drama.Therefore he cannot maintain his demeanor and beat this self-righteous dog thing. He beat him until Liang Deyou shouted for help to his father and mother. before leaving, he also kicked his third leg. He didn't know if it can be use later. Who knows that he accidentally died the same night. He didn't know if Liang Deyou search for him for revenge and finds out that he's already dead and gets mad.Liang Deyou was probably shocked when he was beaten by him. Because how can someone who's kind and polite beats people and in such a rhythmic and stylish style. But there's nothing he can do. He has always been a civilize person but he is not always the kind of guy who can hold back his anger.\"Hua Ding International...\" He smiled and look at the official website of Hua Ding International and lean lazily on the sofa. \"This is it.\"After driving to the security brokerage company in the afternoon to open an account. He directly starts to buy Hua Ding International's shares so his commission broker is surprise. After all, someone new will replace the position of the current ceo. The economy is chaotic and many investors are not optimistic about this. The stock price is getting lower in the recent years. He did not expect that someone will buy so many shares of Hua Ding at this time.But as a broker, he didn't say anything and buy it according to the customer's intentions. As for buying something good or not, it is the customer's business.The stocks now market are getting more miserable. The stocks now is not that great compare to before. The people who buys some are more cautious now than the past.For Lu Chengyu, Hua Ding international will surely benefit him. He did not think that this stocks will send a big fortune. He is just confident about this company and didn't want to waste this good opportunity because next month, the Hua Ding International's stock price will rise again.Hua Ding International is now in a turbulent storm. It is rumored that the internal forces have fought very hard. The older members wants to control the new president. It is very lively. However, in the end, the Hua Ding International's new president control the over all situation and became the overlord in the industry.When Lu Chengyu think of this he sighed and thought that they are the same young people. How can the difference be so great?Seeing that the time is early, he found a Chinese food shop and order a few dishes. But before he eats it in half, he saw a man in a well-trimmed suit walking with a beautiful woman.\"Yu?\" The man in the suit look at the food on his desk and ask in a dry tone. \"How have you been recently? If you have time then come to our house.\"\"Brother Dong.\" Lu Chengyu call politely and let the two to sit down and wipe his mouth with a napkin. \"I didn't expect to meet you here. I will graduate soon so i am a bit busy. If I have some time then I will visit in your house.\" Lu Dong is the son of his uncle. He studied abroad for two years and after returning to china, he mix with other people well. They regard him as the young talent of the old Lu family. However, he do not have much contact with this cousin so they talk casually.\"That's good.\" Lu Dong see Lu Chengyu doesn't seem to think of asking his family relatives help him. He is relieve and then introduce his girlfriend beside him, \"This is my girlfriend Shen min, we will marry in the second half of the year. You must come.\"\"This beautiful and gentle beauty is actually going to be my sister-in-law is a blessing for brother Dong.\" Lu Chengyu smile and pick up the purple teapot on the table. He poured a cup of tea for Shen Min and Lu dong. He praise \"I will be in time for your wedding brother.\"Lu Dong is happy because of Lu Chengyu's praise. Shen Min has a very good family life. She is beautiful and look like a good wife. Many people will surely envy him. Shen Min wave her hand and say, \"You are almost graduating. Did you found a job yet? If not then don't search anymore. It's better to work in our company. Although I'm not very good at it, but I'm also someone who works in the department manager. At least I can arrange you a job there.\"In his memory, Lu Dong's wife seems to be the daughter of their company's boss. Every new year, Lu Dong has always been praise by their relatives. Is it this Shen Min? But before he learned that Lu Dong played with other women. He didn't know what happen to the two of them again.Shen Min is very well educated. Although she did not know which family side this young man in front of her is related to her boyfriend, her words and actions are very polite. She take the cup of tea and say thank you and take a sip and drop it. After looking at this young man who didn't change the expression on his face, he found that this man is very demeanor. When he poured the tea, his movements are very standard. He has a gentleman's aura and people can't help but want to be good to him.\"I do not know this is?\" She hesitated and smile and push Lu Dong's shoulder. \"You haven't introduce him to me yet.\"\"I forgot, he is my cousin and goes to Q school and he will graduate this year.\" Lu Dong said in a stiff tone. Then he added, \"My brother's situation is not easy. You will be his sister-in-law soon so you should take care of him.\"Shen Min lightly push him again and frown. 'What did you say?\" They can talk about it privately. But he should not talk like this in front of the person it self even if he is his cousin. It is not good.Lu Dong also notice that what he say is not right and smile at Lu Chengyu. \"Brother, I have something to do so we will go first.\"\"Okay.\" Lu Chengyu seem to have found Lu Dong's thought to show off a little. He smile at the two people. \"Walk slowly brother Dong and sister-in-law. If I have a time afterwards we will sit again together.\"Lu Dong see Lu Chengyu's att.i.tude and didn't show off anymore. He hurriedly left with Shen Min. Lu Chengyu look at the back of Lu Dong. The smile on his face faded a little and sneer and continue to eat.This is a Chinese restaurant is called Baixuan Restaurant and have a good taste. The price here is not low. Its so pricey\u00a0that he can't afford waste the food.After eating the food and is ready to pay the bill, a hand holding a wallet appear behind him. \"Sir, you drop your wallet.\"He glance back. It is a man in a black suit and looks pretty good. His expressionless face makes him feel that it was majestic man. He also saw this kind of person in his previous life. He knows that this kind of person cannot easily be close with so he did not intend to talk more. He takes the wallet, smile and thank the man and pull out the card to the waiter. \"Please also put the gentleman's payment together.\" Then he turn back to the man who wanted to refuse, \"I hope you won't refuse. This is a thank you for helping me.\"In this world, he don't have a lot of money. Not to mention the fact that he recently use a lot of ID cards. He also keep a bank card inside. If he lose some of the doc.u.ments he had obtain from the securities brokerage company, he will be in a trouble.When people pick up something and return it, it's called kindness.The cashier look at the man behind him and quickly found out that the price list for the two people has exceeded the savings in the balance account. \"I'm sorry sir, your bank card has insufficient balance.\"\"Oh?\" Lu Chengyu take the bank card in the cashiers hand and change it into a golden card and did not explain anything and just say, \"Try this.\"This kind of things always happen to the cashiers. The average people who encounters this matter will be somewhat embarra.s.s and say that they take the wrong card. But this man is so calm, it is really rare. But it is this att.i.tude that makes people believe that he really take the wrong card, or else how can he be calm?He quickly pays his bills and Lu Chengyu say to the man behind him. \"Thank you for picking up my wallet. If it weren't for you picking up my wallet, the I would be in big trouble.\" He pointed to the ID card and driver's license in the wallet and then raise his hand. \"Goodbye.\" Although the expression on his face is calm, his heart is bleeding. What kind of people eats a food that even his balance in his bank card is not enough, there are still thousand balance in there!In this moment, he realize the true meaning of a word, that is, don't pretend to be loaded, it will hit you fast like lightning!His hands tremble as he walk out the door.Ater Lu Chengyu left, Yam Mu ask the cashier. \"How much money did he pay?\"The cashier look at the price list. \"Mr. Yan, it is a total of 8,638, because you have a VIP card, all the drinks is 16%.\" Mr. Yan is a frequent visitor to their shop, usually he eats a not expensive food, but today he is with his friends. He order more foods and also added a bottle of wine, the price is not cheap.Yan Mu nodded his head and look at the door of the restaurant. He see that the youth just stop a taxi, go inside and left.He frown. If he remember correctly, the company is looking for a new staff and he seems to see this man's profile, is it him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

BTW if anyone knows how to link this one -> [1] to the description below, please tell me, I'm a noob in WordPress. Thanks, o(\u3003\uff3e\u25bd\uff3e\u3003)oChapter 3: SuccessAfter receiving the consumer texts sent by the bank, Lu Chengyu felt that when he stepped out of Baiwei Restaurant, his chic and unrestrained style was all broken into dregs. How many thousands does it cost for a person's meal? Whose family's black sheep[1] is this?The next morning, Cheng Yu received an interview call from Hua Ding Personnel Department. He found a casual suit from his wardrobe. As a newly graduated college student, it is not a good choice to wear a mature-looking cloth when looking for a job. It is far better to dress neatly and tidily to impress the interviewer. If people want mature employees, why they want to recruit fresh graduates but not directly select employees with working experience?In his past life, Cheng Yu believed that Hua Ding International has internal changes, so did not submit resumes to the company. After his interview with Liang Company \u2018s failed, he becomes a manager in a company and ran errands with another manager for two years. After all the troubles, he qualified to take one artist under him. As result, the investor did not interested [2] in the artist, but interested in the manager. Cheng Yu didn't want to play with this game, thus he resign from the company. Later on, he opened a small fast-food restaurant. Before he had earned his money, they smashed his shop. Someone, with no reason, accused him of using ditch oil [3] and tell it to a local tabloid, considered as it genuinely disgraceful.After closing the small fast-food restaurant, he was introduced to a crew as an a.s.sistant by an acquaintance. As a result, he met someone who wanted to support him before he knew this guy was an investor in the play and he was eventually tossed out of the crew. Those years had not been a good one, and his relatives treated him coldly. After that, he found some jobs, but somehow something went wrong. Finally, he became the lobby manager of a star-rated luxury hotel. As a result, when he was about to be promoted, he died.Talents of dignified Q Branch of Economic Management, mixed together with this situation, were also considered \u201cgood-for-nothing\u201d [4]. He felt that he must be a negative example of many alumni in the same grade, but later he seldom attended cla.s.smates'a.s.sociations. What other people thought had little to do with him.But looking back on the days of his past life, it's hard to say it was tragic,even he didn't understand. He started smoothly and profitably many times, but when the critical moment came, he lost the chain inexplicably. It's like G.o.d hates him and wants him to be unlucky.\u201cWho has not died since ancient times, only early death and late death,\u201dCheng Yu skillfully operated the computer, looking up the information he wanted, smiling coldly,\u201cBut cannot die in vain.\u201dEarly the next morning, he changed his clothes and stopped a taxi instead of crowding in the bus or the subway, so that he wouldn't get tired when he reaches to Hua Ding Headquarters.Cheng Yu look up at the glittering sign of Hua Ding Headquarters and the vigours security guard at the gate. He straightened his collar and walk, not too fast nor too slow to the Hua Ding's main door.The receptionist knew that there would be many interviews today, so he quickly explained the location of the interview to Lu Chengyu.After entering the elevator, Lu Chengyu felt that Hua Ding Headquarters was somewhat cold, which was not like the atmosphere of the headquarters of a large company. It can be seen how much the impact of Huading's turbulence was. He somewhat understood why the industry was surprised when Huading got up.Half an hour before the interview begins, all the job seekers are sitting in a conference room waiting for the interview to begin, which shows that Huading attaches great importance to talents. When Lu Chengyu entered, there were six people, four men and two women. Six people saw him come in. They only raised their heads and went to play with their mobile phones.Lu Chengyu chose a seat nearby with a smile on his face. He looked around unconsciously and saw a camera in an obscure corner. If he hadn't worked in the hotel for some time, he couldn't have found it.On the conference table, there were several coloured materials about Huading. He took a book and turned it slowly. He hadn't looked at it for two minutes, but there was another person beside him.\u201ch.e.l.lo,\u201d he looked up at the people beside him, it was quite a beautiful girl.\u201ch.e.l.lo,\u201d the girl also politely nodded to him and smiled back. She imitates Chengyu behaviour; she took a copy of a book and turned it over slowly.At 9:40, the interview officially began. There were twelve people coming for the interview. Because two a.s.sistants are recruited, thus ten out of twelve people should be eliminated (T/n: huh..meaning that the company wanted to recruit only 4 people. 2 people (the a.s.sistants) are already guaranteed the job, thus left only 2 places?)Lu Chengyu felt a little confused. Whose a.s.sistant is this? Department Manager or Branch Manager?Huading International has branches elsewhere and has set foot in several industries but its main focus is on electronics and real estate. Even if the interview is successful, these newcomers are likely to be delegated to the branch.Lu Chengyu admits that he has ambition. That's why he came for an interview when Huading was unstable. Having gone through so many bad luck in his past life, he should have saved a lot of good luck for this life, right?This society is very realistic, only if they stand high enough to settle old accounts, people can not arbitrarily oppress.He is not someone who is too self-contained [5], someone able to speculate things and also someone who unwilling to let go.The first few people who went in for the interview came out very quickly, their faces were not very good, and one of them even began to complain: \u201cIt's yourself who is about to get bankrupt, still demanding so many things, when I can't find a job?\u201dLu Chengyu knocked twice at the door and entered the interview room. There were three men and one woman sitting in the room. Their faces looked very mild. But this kind of people can make others easily relax their vigilance and finally show their weaknesses unconsciously.After introducing himself, the four interviewers asked him a few questions in turn, which was not too tricky. They would like to see more the comprehensive qualities of the job seekers.After answering these questions in an orderly manner, Lu Chengyu finally heard them ask questions about business trips. He laughed and said, \u201cThere's nothing wrong with business trips.\u201d In his last life, he ran around for work and almost became a dog. It's normal for him to go to work on business trips. He feels that accepting business trips is completely stress-free.This society is always a world of relationships and abilities, no exception.Several interviewers nodded, and the middle-aged woman sitting on the far right pushed her gla.s.ses on the bridge of her nose, showing a professional smile: \u201cWelcome to join our company, please report to the Personnel Department next Monday, then we will sign the contract.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and nodded. He got up and nodded to the four men. \u201cThank you very much. I'll be there on Monday.\u201dFour interviewers all smiled back and waited for Chengyu to go out. The middle-aged woman wearing gla.s.ses said, \u201cThis young man is young and calm, and there will be a lot of room for development in the future.\u201d\u201cIf it weren't for his information here, some of his behaviours are not very clear, I really have to suspect that he's a veteran in the workplace.\u201d said the Vice Personnel Department, a 40-year-old man, who wiped his half-bald forehead, drew a tick on Lu Chengyu's job description and put it in a drawer. \u201cNo wonder someone called to ask about this man last night.\u201dFour of them are senior in the workplace. They knew that Lu Chengyu is not someone who knows people on the top manager (T/N: as in he got a recommendation or know top bra.s.s). It's a rare time that some of the top students like his ability, and the top students in the Q Branch of Economic Management are willing to come to Huading to work at this time.Lu Chengyu left Huading Headquarters and felt a little unexpected. How can a company like Huading hire people directly in an interview?Looking at Hua Ding International's glimmering signboard shower with sunlight, no matter what company, as long as the name is added with the word \u201cinternational\u201d, it will look like a bull's fork, not to mention the name of Huading, China's Ding [6], which is really powerful.Turning around the corner, he saw a lottery betting station. He stops walking and reminisces the day when he fails his job interview. While he went to search for a job everywhere, he got lucky and draw a prizewinning ticket in a lottery but he can't remember the winning number is for sports lottery or lucky lottery.In the end, Lu Chengyu bought four note body lottery [7] and two-color ball for luck lottery [8]. It has been 8-9 years ago when we won this lottery, many of his memories have long been blurred, but now he's just trying his luck.Anyway, the total amount of eight lottery tickets is 16 yuan, and the waste not as bad as the buddy he met last night.After putting the tickets in his wallet, Lu Chengyu found an antique tea house and sat down. He ordered a cup of bamboo leaf green [9]. He listened to the quiet Guqin music. Through the second floor window, he watched the people coming and going downstairs. He slowly brings out his mobile phone and gracefully read the online novel that he had not finished last night.(T/N: Oh nooo, when I thought I'm translating modern novel\u2026\u2026..there's trap everywhere \u2220(\uff9f\u0414\uff9f)/ Below is the plot of the novel MC's reading, nothing to do with this novel, so it's okay not to understand it, but if you understand it, write in the comment since I am sooo bad in translating Wuxia or Xiaxia novels)The protagonist should be on the verge to move forward to the early period of Yuan Dynasty. But why hasn't his girlfriend appear yet, but it's was his teacher who brushes his existence everywhere (don't ask me why..I'm gonna put the real description from novel below [10])But then, this novel is magnificent in portraying atmosphere. Whether there is a girlfriend or not is just icing on the cake. The author is very good at writing, and the description of the protagonist has made up for all the deficiencies.It was wonderful to see from where he sat, then he heard a girl's slightly unexpected voice, \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d The beautiful female voice makes him to quickly pull out the bookmarks, put them to the novel, then smile and look up, \u201cIs it you?\u201d He didn't expect to meet the girl he interviewed with before here, it's a coincidence.Chengyu gets up and goes to the other side of the table. He gently moved the carved chair back, whispered, \u201cI didn't expect to meet you here. It's too fateful. Let's have a drink together, please sit down.\u201dZhang Jiayu hesitated for a moment. Seeing that the other party had dragged the chair away, she laughed and thanked him. She sat down on the chair and looked at the tea list handed over by Lu Chengyu. \u201cI don't know much about tea. I really don't know what kind of tea to drink.\u201dAfter listening to her, Lu Chengyu knew that this was a girl with a straightforward personality. He laughed and said, \u201cGirls drink rose tea to invigorate their blood and improve their looks. The taste is okay. Why don't you try it?\u201dZhang Jiayu did not pretend to be an expert. She nodded directly. Originally, because she was hired by Huading, she came to the tea restaurant around here so that she could have a good relationship with her future colleagues. She didn't expect to meet the person who had just been interviewed.\u201cMy name is Lu Chengyu. I will work in Huading in the future. Miss, how should I call you? I wonder if we will have the chance to be colleagues in the future?\u201d Lu Chengyu ordered some cakes with Chinese tea. Looking at the girl's expression, the interview results should be very satisfactory.\u201cDon't call me Miss. My name is Zhang Jiayu. We both have \u201cYu\u201d in our names. That's fate. You can call me Xiaoyu (Little Yu).\u201d Zhang Jiayu smiled brightly, but she declining Lu Chengyu's respecting att.i.tude towards her, \u201cWe'll be colleagues in the future.\u201dLu Chengyu also smiled and spoke with less politeness and more casualness, which was enough for the other party to perceive his intimacy. \u201cIn that case, you may call me Dayu (Big Yu). In the future, if you need to repair a computer or move something big, just call me,\u201d said Chengyu to Zhang Jiayu. As for whether they will work in the same place in the future, it's not important. It's important to let each other know that he has the intention to help her.Sure enough, because of his att.i.tude, Zhang Jiayu's words and deeds have become a lot of casual, and when the tea is almost finished and after eating the cake, they have exchanged mobile phone numbers, added WeChat, and even follow each other Weibo.After they separate, Lu Chengyu has been marked with a big red tick by Zhang Jiayu in her heart.[1]\u8d25\u5bb6\u5b50 [b\u00e0i ji\u0101 z\u01d0]a prodigal son squandering the family fortune; black sheep; a spendthrift; wastrel; a black sheep ;[2] this part: in the novel it stated that this investor didn't look at the artist, but the manager. \u201cLook\u201d might as well as \u201cinterested\u201d, who wanna look things that not interested, muahahaha.[3] \u5730\u6c9f\u6cb9 [d\u00ec g\u014du y\u00f3u]cooking oil that has been used and discarded (and, in China, sometimes illegally recovered from gutters and sewers, reprocessed and sold back to restaurants)[4] \u7a9d\u56ca [w\u014d nang ]feel vexed; be annoyed; stupid, cowardly and timid; good-for-nothing; -I choose good-for-nothing as MC stated because he brings a negative image to university[5] \u6e05\u9ad8 [q\u012bng g\u0101o]aloof from politics and material pursuits; self-contained; pure and lofty ;[6] \u9f0e [d\u01d0ng][\u540d] an ancient cooking vessel with two loop handles and three or four legs; as symbol of dynasty;[7][8][9][10]\u4e3b\u89d2\u5e94\u8be5\u5c31\u5feb\u8981\u8de8\u8fdb\u5143\u5a74\u671f\u4e86\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8eab\u8fb9\u7684\u59b9\u7eb8\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u51fa\u73b0\uff0cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHmmm\u2026 it is still a mystery to me on how to do the hyperlink in WordPress and luckily this chapter only has 3 descriptions below, so bear with me until I solve the mystery\u2026 Or can I just put the description within the paragraph?Chapter 4: EntrySince he had to go to the company on Monday, Lu Chengyu bought several suitable suits for his workplace and also starts to buy Huading International's stock. By the end of his spending, Lu Chengyu was left with 50,000 in his bank card. He saves this money as security for the future and did not plan to spend it now.Huading's current stock's price has almost become a joke in the stock market. Many investors are eager to sell their stocks, so Lu Chengyu bought as many stocks he can buy at a very low price. Otherwise, how can he buy so much with the money on his hand? If it weren't for the lack of money on hand, he would have bought all the stocks he could buy.After cooking a bowl of instant noodles and take a nap in the evening, Lu Chengyu suddenly remembered about the lottery's tickets he bought before. He took it out and plan to cash out the prize. The reason he could remember the winning numbers, it's not because his IQ is against the sky, but because the order of the numbers is too easy to memorize.\"06 07 08 09 11 22 33\"He threw chopsticks into the bowl, reciting the number, and looked up the winning number on the internet. Although he is familiar with this number, it does not mean that it is the winning number of this issue, so he didn't take it seriously. But, when he checks the lottery prize number, he was stunned.He couldn't believe it. He looked at the opening date nearly ten times and the number of days on his lottery ticket, he shivered and held the sports lottery in his hand. \u201cReally\u2026 middle?\u201d(T/n: opening date (the day they announce winning number) and days of lottery; usually you need to claim your prize within a week from the open date, but if you didn't claim within a week, the prize will not be given to you, btw, there are three categories of prize: High, Middle, Low).He felt like he had been already hungry for several days and then suddenly he was given a table full of food; he even starts to think that this is a dream.Lu Chengyu shivering and start to pinch his thigh. He almost ecstatically slammed a drink next to his computer and start to check the amount of middle prize for each bet. This time, he shivered a few times, the amount of the prize awarded in each bet was more than 5.9 million.He bought a total of four bets of sports lottery, that is to say, nearly 24 million. After 20% of the tax is deducted, there are still about 19 million left. This unexpected fortune really knocked him off his feet. He had never seen so much money in his last life.Lu Chengyu tried his best to calm down, he went to the bathroom and wiped his face with cold water. Since he won the prize, it's better not tell anyone. When he goes to received the prize tomorrow, he plans to dress low-key.Although aren't necessarily tabloid reporters squatting at the door, the experience of his previous life told him that caution is the best, money cannot be disclosed, even if it is a trophy.It was until late midnight did Chengyu able to sleep. Early the next morning, he took a bus to the cash centre. Then he receives the winning cheque and leaves the cash centre as fast as he can. He went to the bank and transfer all the amount on the check to his bank card. After the transaction is completed, he touches his bank card and he sighed in relief. From what he experienced in his previous life, he had already understood the importance of money and power.After he gets home, he went to Commission brokers and let him buy Huading's stocks for him. He spends almost all the money he had on hand. Just when he owned nearly 3% of the shares, another large-scale purchasing power appeared in the stock market and made a very big investment. In just a few hours, Huading's share price has been selling like hotcakes, making the shareholders who hold Huading shares be delighted. Although some people have the intention to observe the stock price for a few days before deciding to sell or not, thinking about the current situation of Huading, they hesitate for a few moments before selling the shares in their hands for peace of mind. (T/n: they think since Huading might bankrupt soon, they will be more happy to sell their share ).Lu Chengyu understands that someone purchased Huading stock intentionally, and he does not know which side of Huading's internal forces is involved. According to the future development of Huading's company, 9 out of 10, the person who bought back all these shares is the new president of Huading International.He didn't intend to compete with this force, nor did he have strong financial resources, so he stopped buying stocks and held the 3% shares in his heart, which was enough.\u201cUnexpectedly this time, someone bought a lot of our Huading stock,\u201d Cao Jingshen said, frowning as he looked at the trading volume of Huading stock market on his computer. \u201cI thought someone was holding the shares maliciously, but after we raised the share's price, he stopped. It's not hard to say that this is a shareholder has confidence in Huading, or he just comes to buy shares for a cheaper price?\u201dThe man sitting next to him looked at the trading volume and thought for a moment. Affirming that it was just an accident, he said, \u201cDon't worry. Go ahead and buy as much as you can. I don't want to put up with those people any more. Huading is too big, so does the number of people in management; if its rights are in one hand, that's enough.\u201dCao Jingshen no longer talks much at the moment. His fingers are typing fast on the computer. The stock market war has long been doomed. Those rivals who want to break down his boss is bringing out of these dizzy tricks. Now, it is not certain who will break down.It was sunny on Monday. Lu Chengyu had a hard time getting up and wash his face. Then he went downstairs to have breakfast at the breakfast shop outside the neighbourhood and squeeze into the crowded bus.When he arrived at Huading Headquarters, he still had extra 15 minutes before the time to work. After he arrived at the Personnel Department, he realized that the people in the Personnel Department haven't arrived yet. He raised his wrist and looked at his watch, it was less than five minutes from the time to work. It seems that many employees in Huading also have problems. (T/n: besides the company itself have problems, the employee's att.i.tude is also a problem).When Lu Chengyu arrived, the half-bald Vice Head of the Personnel Department saw him and nodded satisfactorily to Chengyu. He was a very sensible young man. He was neither too early to get to the company nor too late, which was just right for the new staff.He opens the door that leads to the Personnel Department and looks at several office staff at communal s.p.a.ce in the department. He smiled and said \u201cXiao Lu is here. He comes in with me\u201dLu Chengyu recognized the man as one of the interviewers and looked at the name tag that is on the man's chest. It turned out that this man named Du Peng, Vice Head of the Personnel Department.\u201cSit down\u201d. After Chengyu sat down, Du Peng put a cup of water from the water dispenser in front of\u00a0Lu Chengyu. \u201cThe company suggests you stay at Headquarters for the internship before continuing to arrange your specific position.Lu Chengyu took up the paper cup and said thanks. He took a sip before putting it down. When he heard Du Peng's words, he did not speak in a hurry and waited for Du Peng's next words.\u201cThis is because the company recruits few college students like you, thus there are no training courses. But whether there are training courses or not, is not so important. The most important thing for young people is to study hard.\u201d When Du Peng looks at Lu Chengyu's calm face, he couldn't guess his thoughts for a moment. But he thinks of the importance attached to Lu Chengyu from his superior, Du Peng's speech and att.i.tude were very polite.\u201cYoung and talented people like you are highly valued by the company. The company has free meals for employees at noon. If you work overtime, there are additional overtime fees. As long as you sign the employment contract with the company, there are various insurance and security payments. So you have to believe in the sincerity of the company.\u201d After that, Du Peng take out the internship contract from the drawer.Lu Chengyu has carefully read the contract in his hand. Just when Du Peng thought he had something to ask, Chengyu took out his pen and signed his name on the contract.Du Peng looked at the signature of the contract and laughed with amazement. \u201cIt's beautifully written. A person's personality is reflected in how they write. Xiao Lu, you have a great talent\u201d.\u201cMr Du is very kind\u201d. Lu Chengyu separated the contracts into two parts, one of which was handed to Du Peng with his both hands and another one is for him. Chengyu hesitated for a moment. \u201cI don't know which department I'm going to report to today.\u201d\u201cSecretary Cao has been busy recently. You graduated from Q University. But not a match to Secretary Cao, why don't you go and learn under his leadership?\u201d said Du Peng while laughing. He keeps the contract and handed Chengyu his work card. \u201cSecretary Cao is on the 23rd floor. That's the Secretarial Department. You can report now.\u201dChengyu takes the work card and nodded to Du Peng. After that, he politely excuses himself from the office and went to the elevator. He looks at the work card on his hand, it has a small picture of himself, his name and his position. His position is the a.s.sistant to Chief Secretary. Why is it a.s.sistant to Chief Secretary, not a secretary to Chief Secretary?It seems that Secretary Cao should be the Chief Secretary of the senior management, and 9 out of 10, secretary to the new president. Therefore, the Personnel Department a.s.signed their new recruit to this man. The Personnel Department is probably a legendary \u201cgra.s.s on the top of a wall which sways with every wind\u201d [1]. These old school people look down upon inexperience-freshly-graduates, therefore although two new people were hired by the end of the interview, n.o.body was in charge of them.To put it in an ugly way is that they don't think high to the inexperienced graduates. If they have that spirit, they might as well fight to the death with others.When the elevator stopped on the 18th floor, two clerks with doc.u.ments in their hands came in. When they saw the b.u.t.ton to the 23rd floor is lit, they take a look at Lu Chengyu and closed the elevator door.After reaching the 23rd floor, Lu Chengyu pinned his work card to his left chest and walked calmly on the bright and clean floor. Not far away, he saw the Chief Secretary office sign. He came forward and knocked three times.\u201cPlease come in.\u201d said someone with a young voice, estimated to be not more than 30 years old.Lu Chengyu gently opens the door, he saw a man of about 30 years old, dressed in a suit, reading doc.u.ments. There were a notebook computer and some doc.u.ments on his desk. From a glance, he knew that this person is busy.\u201cAre you Lu Chengyu?\u201d Cao Jingshen looked up and saw a young man who looked like a model standing at the door, he slightly frowns. \u201cFirst, familiarize yourself with the workflow. Your office is in the fifth compartment outside. This afternoon, there will be a company meeting. You will go with me.\u201d He took a folder on his desk. \u201cThese are the contents of the afternoon meeting. You can take a look at them.\u201dLu Chengyu took the folder and found that the folder had some weight. He looks at the Chief Secretary Cao, maybe this person has some scruples with his appearance?\u201cYes. I'll have a good look later. \u201d He held the file well. Since they both have no other question, Chengyu close the door and left the office. He went to the office area and found a workplace marked No. 5. After greeting his colleagues, he sat down.The desk is clean and the computer looks new. After switching on the computer, he checked it. There is no malicious monitoring software or virus on the computer. Well, it seems that computers are as clean as desks.He went to the Logistics Department to collect a set of office tools for his work and tidied up his desk. Lu Chengyu began to understand his work and conference materials for this afternoon's meeting.This afternoon's meeting was actually about personnel changes, and this change is not small. Many people in positions will be implicated. It seems that the new strict president is going to severely cut cancer [2] with his hand.There are rumours saying that President Yan[3] himself, as his surname, is very calm and serious, doesn't like to receive media interviews and play with any celebrity. In his past life, Chengyu heard that an actress was hyping him up. Since then, the actress has not been able to receive any job, could've means just one thing, President Yan took an action. So, by the year Chengyu died, President Yan was still in the first place on the hottest single man ranking.Chengyu was quite sure that now since President Yan dares to hold such meeting,It appears that the biggest storm in Huading is about to begin.[1] \u5899\u5934\u8349 [qi\u00e1ng t\u00f3u c\u01ceo ]; a person who bends with the wind; fence-sitter ;[2] people who bring more harm than benefit to the company[3] \u4e25 [y\u00e1n] tight; rigorous; strict; severe;Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWell, while translating this chapter, I was like \u201cOh Yan Mu is so cool, so HANDSOME (\u25cf\u2661\u2200\u2661) \u201c, but then, the real bomb here is Chengyu \u0669(\u2661\u03b5\u2661 )\u06f6, I bet everyone gonna chant Chengyu's name by the end of this chapter. MUAHAHAHA~Chapter 5: Excellent SkillsTwo or three o'clock in the afternoon is the peak hour for employees to feel tired and muddle-head in the office. But today is different, all Huading's employees feel energetic. This is because they have heard some gossip and know that this afternoon's meeting will be tense. They don't dare to think the outcome of this meeting. It is not easy to find a better job nowadays. Many people are worried that the company will lay off its employees because of the recent recession. So at the beginning of the meeting, many employees waiting for the conclusion about dismissing staff.Lu Chengyu followed Cao Jingshen into the conference room on the 28th floor. Cao Jingshen gave him a laptop and said, \u201cYou will take notes of today's meeting.\u201dIs this his job as a stenographer? Lu Chengyu looked at the silver-enclosed notebook in front of him. It looked very new and seldom being used.\u201cIn the future, if you are using your own laptop, you can bring it to work. If you don't have any laptop, the company will provide one for you.\u201d Cao Jingshen looks at Lu Chengyu and found that he was checking on this laptop. Cao Jingshen pushed his eyegla.s.ses and said, \u201cRest a.s.sured, this notebook is new.\u201d He implies that no one is doing something to the laptop.Lu Chengyu said while laughing: \u201cIs this laptop is free of charge?\u201d\u201cIf you sign a contract with the company for more than two years, you can get it for free.\u201d Cao Jingshen opened a folder and stopped looking at Lu Chengyu. \u201cThe premise is that you can formally pa.s.s the probation period.\u201d\u201cThen I'll use this one,\u201d said Lu Chengyu, as if he hadn't heard anything from Cao Jingshen, he opened a blank doc.u.ment on the laptop and wait leisurely for the meeting to begin.Cao Jingshen looked up at him and said nothing. The meeting room became quiet, but neither of them felt awkward and they do their own thing.Soon several major shareholders and managers of various departments' branches came one after another, and basically, everyone had a secretary behind them. Lu Chengyu finally understood why Huading still had a Secretarial Department and Cao Jingshen was the chief-secretary. Indeed, Huading's internal organization is very complicated.At 2:50 p.m, all the related people have arrived. Just when everyone thought the big boss would be late, Cao Jingshen suddenly stood up and went to open the conference room's carved door. A young looking man, aged around 27 \u2013 28 years old, in a black suit and tie came in. To Lu Chengyu's surprise, he felt familiar with him. Where he had seen him?\u201cThe meeting can begin now. Let's discuss our views about the company.\u201d Yan Mu sat down on the boss' chair. Without looking at anyone he threw one file straight onto the table.\u201cEr shu (Second uncle) and San shu (Third uncle) are the old people in this company, so it's better to start with you two.\u201d After Yan Lao Er (Yan second old man) and Yan Lao San (Yan third old man) exchanged look, Yan Lao San opened his somewhat unhappy mouth and said, \u201cWhy does it sound like you are asking for guilt when you said that?\u201dYan Mu look at Yan Lao San for a while before he said, \u201cSince you don't want to talk about it, let's have a look some good things that I have here. There is strength in the number, so if anyone sees any wrong information, feel free to point it out.\u201d He turned to Cao Jingshen, who was sitting beside.\u201dJingshen, give out a copy of the information to everyone.\u201dCao Jingshen opened a folder and took out a stack of papers. He hand over half of the papers to Lu Chengyu.Lu Chengyu did not hesitate. He went to the other side and give out the papers, one by one in order. When he gives it to Yan Lao San, he received a sneer of disdain. Chengyu saw Yan Lao San taking a picture of the information that he just gives out, page-by-page. When he gave the papers to Yan Lao Er, Chengyu saw he was very calm. It seems like the second uncle was calmer than the third uncle.The indifference att.i.tude of people in the meeting who take the information change as soon as they read it. After they read it, many people start sweating, especially Yan Lao San. It was splendid to see his face change from red to green and green to white.Lu Chengyu did not look at the contents of the information. The remaining papers were placed casually in front of Cao Jingshen. As soon as he sat back in his position, he heard a bang. He looked up and saw Yan Lao San smashing a teacup. The secretary behind him was bowing awkwardly to pick it up.Yan Mu ignored him and began to talk about the company's new regulation. Lu Chengyu listened to it while typing quickly on the blank doc.u.ment to record. For a while, only Yan Mu's voice and Lu Chengyu's keyboard-tapping noise were heard in the quiet conference room.After Yan Mu finish explaining the new regulation, he looked solemnly at everyone in the conference room. \u201cI heard that some people are going to resign. We always talk about democracy in Huading. If anyone wants to leave, I will never persuade them to stay.\u201dLu Chengyu recorded the last sentence. When he heard Yan Mu's last statement, he could not help but lit a candle to the people present. It seems that Yan Mu is forcing some of them to leave their jobs voluntarily so that the company can pay less dismissal compensation fees, which is quite perfect.The people in the meeting understand what Yan Mu try to imply. In this situation, anyone who has any record of illegal operation in the company has to leave their post voluntarily. Since Yan Mu dares to say such things, he must have any kind of evidence in his hands.\u201cAh Mu, is this something proper for you to do?\u201d said Yan Lao Er while holding his teacup. Then he laughed and say \u201cAfter all, if so many people quit their jobs in such a large company as Huading, wouldn't it show instability in outsiders' minds? Now we have a lot of problems in Huading, if we fall down again\u2026and if the eldest brother who is in Heaven now knows it, he wouldn't be in peace and wants to come back.\u201dFor Chengyu, it is a disgusting tactic when someone tries to take advantage by being older than you and saying things like \u2018I'm doing this for your own benefit', just like what Yan Lao Er trying to do to Yan Mu now. This person has a serious moral problem. Chengyu takes a look at Yan Mu. Although his face doesn't change, Yan Mu's eyes seem cold when he looks at Yan Lao Er, as if he were looking at a rat in a garbage dump.\u201cSince this company has become mine, I have the final say, and my father has pa.s.sed away. As for the reason why this company has so many problems, you should be the one who knows best from everyone else\u201d. Yan Mu sneered, \u201cWhat's more Er Shu, you have added a new family member recently, a healthy baby boy, it is not good to mention about the deceased.\u201dHearing this, Yan Lao Er's face cannot remain calm because of shame. Because of this illegitimate son, he has lost his face in front of other staff when his wife goes to the company and makes noise. Now that Yan Mu mentions it again, naturally, he was not in a better mood.\u201cNonsense. Yan Mu, you are absolutely being disrespectful. Since eldest brother is not here, I will take his place to teach you a lesson today.\u201d Yan Lao San who already lost his face long ago, at last, unable to remain calm as he has a fierce temper, he picked up the teacup in front of his neighbour seat and threw it at Yan Mu.The teacup in this conference room is opaque with white background and blue flower [1], it is impossible not to bleed if someone was. .h.i.t by it. Everyone here, including Yan Lao Er, was shocked. If it really hit someone, even resigning wouldn't be enough to solve the problem.In this instant, a folder flew over towards the teacup and collided with it on the air. The teacup crash in the middle of the conference's table. The tea inside the teacup splashed all over Yan Lao Er's head and face. He was covered with it.The atmosphere in the entire conference room suddenly became extremely weird. n.o.body expected Yan Lao San to do such mindless things, not to mention that someone would able to stop the teacup. Now they are having a meeting, not holding a Wulin [2] compet.i.tion, aren't they?At the same time, a pair of eyes is looking towards the man who throws the doc.u.ment before, only to find that he (Chengyu) was a young man he has never seen before. Is this Yan Mu's new appointed bodyguard? But it doesn't look like it, this man looks pure and has white-snow-like skin.\u201cSorry, my hands slipped.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, he gets up calmly and takes the folder back. He pulls out a handkerchief from his trouser's pocket, wiped the water stains on the folder and returned it to Cao Jingshen, who was sitting on his left-hand side. Just now, the only thing near to Chengyu was a laptop in front of him. Only the folder in front of Cao Jingshen is suitable to throw.In his previous life, Chengyu has spent more than half a year in the martial arts hall, and work for some time in a bar. He is embarra.s.sed to say that he has both skills.\u201cOh, that's all right.\u201d Cao Jingshen holds his gla.s.ses, unconsciously accepts the folder and looks at Lu Chengyu in a different way. Which part of this boy does his boss take a fancy to? (T/n: well, I bet it was all his part (\u2665\u03c9\u2665*))After a strange silence, Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu, who was calm from beginning to end and turned to Yan Lao San. \u201cIt seems that my San Shu is very dissatisfied with me. In this case, you don't have to come to Huading tomorrow. I will send the dismissal letter to your office in the afternoon.\u201d When Yan Lao San was about to get angry again, he added quickly, \u201cIf San Shu didn't agree, we'd leave it to the police to deal with the things you did before.\u201dYan Lao San's face was red and he held his breath for half a day. He hit the table and stood up. \u201cOkay, now you have strong wings [3], thinking that we old man are useless. Lao Tzu [4] doesn't need any dismissal letter from you. From today on, Lao Tzu doesn't work anymore!\u201d After that, he slammed the door and left the conference room.Originally, the others were harbouring intention to stay in Huading, but after Yan Lao San compromise, they gave up their initial intention. It's better to quit the company now. If Yan Mu really get angry and expose their affairs, they won't be able to mingle in this circle anymore in the future.Yan Mu saw everyone in conference room understand this immediately. Therefore, those who in Huading wouldn't dare to do anything funny in the future. He uses the best steel to make the knifes edge[5], it's enough to do this kind of things once so that everyone knows his means.Yan Lao Er is more sensible compared to Yan Lao San. Now that he knew the whole situation was settled and it was useless to make trouble, he finally signed his name on the resignation letter.The people in the conference room gradually sign the resignation letter. Yan Lao Er was still sitting in his seat with a smile on his face and looked at the Yan Mu who didn't show much expression from beginning to end. He lit a cigarette, walk to the window and said, \u201cYou are not like your father.\u201d\u201cNot being like him is the luckiest thing in my life.\u201d mocked Yan Mu and he laugh. Although his father is somewhat capable, he was a schemer and trickster. If it wasn't for the woman he kept outside the house come and make noise about their son, his mother (Yan Mu's mom) wouldn't die because of illness. If it wasn't for his grandfather have power in politics, his mistress and illegitimate sons would enter his family.Lu Chengyu hung his head lower silently. He seems to listen to something he shouldn't hear.Yan Mu sneered. Those days, the Yan family depended on the Mu family to get a firm foothold, until today, they didn't dare to offend Mu Jia.When Yan Lao Er heard this, he put extinguish his cigarette in the ashtray: \u201cAnyway, now your surname is Yan, not Mu.\u201dYan Mu raised his lips and laugh sarcastically.Yan Lao Er felt somewhat chilly on his back when he listens to Yan Mu's laugh. He picked up his suit jacket on the chair and walked past Lu Chengyu. He said with a smile, \u201cThe young man is in good health and has good hands.\u201dLu Chengyu laughed and said, \u201d You will be healthy if you sleep and wake up early.\u201dYan Lao Er felt that the Lu Chengyu was laughing at the fact that he went out to find a woman at night and made an illegitimate child. His smile sank down, he turned around and left.Lu Chengyu helplessly shrugged his shoulders. Yan Lao Er's temper is bad, in spite of the fact that he was older than him.He looked back and saw his big BOSS is looking at him.LU CHENG YU! LU CHENG YU! LU CHENG YU!

    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySorry for the late release, this chapter only shows some stalker-possessive-male-lead-usual-behaviour in Yan Mu, too bad Chengyu didn't know it. I hope it will not be long until he realized it. HA HA HA \u03c8(\uff40\u2207\u00b4)\u03c8Chapter 6: Adapt\u201cYour reaction is very fast,\u201d Yan Mu's eyes shifted from Lu Chengyu to Cao Jingshen's folder, which Lu Chengyu used to smash teacups. \u201cNowadays, there aren't many college students who are as physically fit as you are.\u201d\u201cUsually I do a lot of exercises and I used to play basketball before, it was due to the conditioned reflex that I somehow managed to throw precisely. ,\u201d said Lu Chengyu, he saved the doc.u.ment file, close his laptop and smiled at Yan Mu.After a while, Yan Mu's lips moved. He said: \u201cJust now, thank you.\u201d He glances at Cao Jingshen and leaves the office.Cao Jingshen saw his glance and follow him out. Lu Chengyu was left alone in the conference room, he scrutinises the room before slowly walks out of the room while holding his laptop using one hand.When he walks into the elevator, he saw several people who partic.i.p.ate in the meeting just now. All these people appearance are good. When they saw Lu Chengyu entering the elevator, they nodded to him. From that, Chengyu can deduce that these people are Yan Mu's ally.Either it is a business world or politic world, one's standing is important. If you choose the wrong place to stand, your life is going to be tragic.Back to his cubicle, Lu Chengyu printed out the previous meeting minutes and then continued to familiarize himself with Huading's internal situation. No matter how Huading's future gonna be, what he needs to do now is to do his job well.When it's about time to get off work, Lu Chengyu found that his office's colleagues were very enthusiastic about him as a newcomer. So, when he wants to go home, there were many people said they wanted to hold a welcome party for him. With a big smile on their face, they told Lu Chengyu if there was anything he didn't know, just ask them.During today's noon break at the canteen, these people have still alienated him. But now, they have become so excited. This is not because they are relieved since they can stay in Huading, but because Chengyu was the a.s.sistant of the President's secretary, meaning that he is one of the new President's faction.After leaving the company, Lu Chengyu takes a crowded bus that was more tightly packed than canned bus this morning. He began to consider buying a second-hand car. Although he has a miserable working experience in his past life, he was able to buy a second-hand Chery. This life shouldn't be worse than that and he doesn't really care whether others would gossip about how an intern was able to buy a car.In this society, it doesn't really matter if someone gossiping about you. What is important is whether you have or not the ability to block the gossip.Regardless of how well and perfect someone can do his job, there always be someone else slander him behind his back. Only the person who has \u2018someone strong behind his back', or they have \u2018money' are able to block gossip. If someone who has both of this and yet still being slander by someone else, let alone him, who someone doesn't have both.(T/N: For Chengyu, he doesn't care about gossip because regardless of how strong your backer or how much you money you have, someone still gossips about you. As for him who don't have both, it is not a surprise if someone wants to tell gossip about him, so he doesn't care)After Chengyu gets off the bus, he went to a noodle shop in his neighbourhood and ordered a bowl of beef noodles, added with two dishes of meat and a plate of vegetables. Lu Chengyu loves to eat Tang Thiong [1] noodles here. It has quite a strong taste. All these years, he only likes the taste of this shop although this shop's front is not impressive.The owner of the noodle shop is a fat man of about forty years old. Every time he sees Lu Chengyu, he puts extra two pieces of beef in his noodles. This young man has a good appet.i.te and is a frequent customer. Some girls in the shop come to eat noodles just to see him. Since he is the boss, he puts extra beef to in Chengyu's noodle to reward him.He couldn't help but sigh with emotion when he heard about this young man's family. This young man has no father or mother in his early twenties. Fortunately, he had a house and was a student from a famous university. If he was an ordinary person, it would not be easy to find a wife. Nevertheless, it is not easy for such a young child to live alone without parents.As usual, Chengyu didn't take the coin balance from the boss shop. The fat boss smiling while looking when Chengyu is leaving. He can't help but feel that this young man appearance is handsome. If his daughter is a few years older than now, he wanted Chengyu to be his son-in-law.Lu Chengyu returned home with a pile of junk food he bought from the supermarket near the entrance of his neighbourhood. He put drinks and beer in the refrigerator and turned on the TV. He casually glances at the television and saw entertainment news, where a female celebrity was humbly saying something.Looking at this scene, Lu Chengyu laughed. In his past life, while working in the production team doing all the odd jobs, he remembers that this female actress was a guest actor in a drama. She was full of airs and he couldn't see any modesty in her that she shown on the television right now. When he remembered those time during the crew was in trouble, Chengyu sneered and picked up the remote control to change the channel.She has a small heart, and it was precisely her style to repay the kindness that she received by complaining and show dissatisfaction.Cao Jingshen looked at the meeting minutes in his hand and pushed his gla.s.ses. The record was clear and even summarized. But, this isn't the part that surprised him. The most surprising thing was that the meeting minutes were recorded exactly the way how the meeting was held, but somehow it made people feel that boss is doing the right thing, while on the other side, Yan Lao Er had a shallow meaning.The meeting minutes are not reports. So every sentence must be written truthfully and clearly to record the process of the meeting and you can't add your own judgment. But, for such a simple task as writing meeting minutes, Chengyu was able to get others to feel like this.Cao Jingshen was excited looking at the whole meeting minutes one by one while can't help but feel that Chengyu has a rare talent. Not to mention that he is only a student who has not graduated formally, even if he is a veteran in the business, there aren't many people able to do this. For this kind of person, Cao Jingshen had to find ways to keep him.With this in his mind, Cao Jingshen hurried to the president's office, knocked twice at the door, then pushed the door and said, \u201cBoss, look at this meeting minutes!\u201dYan Mu took the meeting minutes, he read a few lines, put down the records and said, \u201cVery good.\u201dCao Jingshen knows that he can get a \u201cvery good\u201d sentence from Yan Mu, even he agrees with it. Then he said, \u201cWhen Lu Chengyu came to report this morning, I thought he looked better than his brain. Now I have to admit that it's me who's blind.\u201d(T/n: Jingshen thought Chengyu is only good looking but not clever but it the truth is that boy really have talent, so he admits that he wasn't good at judging people.)Yan Mu looked at the time, it was 8:00 p.m. He gets up from his chair, picked up his suit coat, and lightly threw out a sentence: \u201cAlso it is true that he is good-looking.\u201dCao Jingshen stunned for a while, he doesn't know how to reply to that. After a moment of hesitation, he continued to speak: \u201cI mean, this potential talent, we must hire him.\u201d\u201cWhen he comes to interview here during the turbulent time, it shows that he intends to stay in\u00a0Huading,\u201d Yan Mu tightened his tie. \u201cJust follow the normal procedure. He is a wise man who knows what he wants.\u201dAfter he thinks about it, Cao Jingshen nodded. He thinks that the boss was right. \u201cI see.\u201d\u201cIt's already late. You should go back early to have a rest.\u201d Yan Mu put on his coat, \u201cIt's time for me to leave work, too.\u201dWhen Cao Jingshen turned around and saw Yan Mu had already left the office. Then he thinks about it. He folded the meeting minutes and put them in his pocket. He went out of the office and saw the shredder outside. He hesitated and then solemnly put them in the shredder.The only way to keep something safe is to make sure no one saw it. There are still several commercial spies in Huading that haven't been pulled out. He can't let this potential talent taken by rivals.Lu Chengyu works smoothly in the next few days. He wonders if he shocked Cao Jingshen so much by revealing his hand in the conference room. Cao Jingshen was being more gentle to him compared on his first day. There was more communication between the two of them in during work. But even so, he didn't have contact with the big boss. All he did was more to coordinate work in various departments every day, or to sort out various doc.u.ments.After three weeks of work, the car he bought finally got its license tag on. Although it was only a hundred thousand or so, he was in a very good mood. Anyway, he owns a car.Huading has an internal parking lot, so Lu Chengyu went to apply for an underground parking pa.s.s and went to work by his car.After more than a month later, Lu Chengyu returned to school to defend his thesis. Only then he knows that Chen Jin had obtained quota to attend Liang's foreign meeting, so he used a video conference to defend his thesis. Maybe it was Liang Deyou who helped him considering Chen Jin's application was easily pa.s.s.In fact, instead of facing Chen Jin, Lu Chengyu was relieved. Although there is no resentment between him and Chen Jin, there is not much brotherhood left.His thesis defence was easy. Lu Chengyu had a hot pot with Liang Hong and Zhu Guanglin and they went to KTV to sing.They went out from KTV after they done with singing. His mind sobers up when he was blown by the night breeze. Chengyu raised his hand and looked at the watch using the street lamp. It was already after 12 a.m., and sadly he said, \u201cI need to sleep, I have to go to work tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYou didn't ask for leave tomorrow?\u201d Zhang Hong patted him on the shoulder and said, \u201cCondolence.\u201d\u201cGet out of the way.\u201d Lu Chengyu gave him a slap on Zhang Hong hands that he places on his shoulder. \u201cHow do I know that I'll be howling with you two till midnight?\u201d\u201cYou speak like you didn't enjoy singing just now\u201d. Zhang Hong pulled out his ears and said, \u201d Besides your two brothers, who else are able to stand your hideous singing? You have a nice voice but tone-deaf, what a rip-off.\u201d\u201cIf you are saying this means that your sense is dead,\u201d Lu Chengyu stretched his lazy waist, \u201cAll right, I'm not going to talk to you anymore, let's go back.\u201dZhu Guanglin, who had never spoken, hesitated for a moment and said, \u201cLao San (third old), didn't you prepare to enter Liang's company before? Then, why did you choose to go to Huading? Was it because of Chen Jin\u2026\u201d?Zhang Hong frowned and stared at him. \u201cLao Zhu (Old Zhu, from Zhu Guanglin name), what are you talking about?\u201d\u201cNo reason.\u201dLu Chengyu put his hands in his trousers pocket and laughed, \u201cI just think Huading has a lot of room for development, so I choose Huading. I'm not gonna spend my working life in Liang Company and let Liang Deyou gain profit from it. You guys might not know that Liang Company was responsible for my parents' accident.\u201dZhu Guanglin and Zhang Hong looked at each other face. Zhu Guanglin looked apologetic and said, \u201cSorry, Lao San, I don't know about it. I just drank too much and talk nonsense. Don't take it to heart.\u201d\u201cThat's just a small thing, I don't take it to my heart.\u201d laughed Lu Chengyu, he really seems doesn't care about it, \u201cEven I know about this recently although the accident happens more than a year ago and it doesn't have anything to do with you. There are a few things I can't tell even we are best friends.\u201dZhu Guanglin speechless looking at Lu Chengyu calm face calm. Eventually, he grins to Chengyu, walk to him and they give each other a pat on the shoulder.Yan Mu sat in his car and watched Lu Chengyu say goodbye to two young people. Then, he saw Chengyu took a taxi and left. He pulled down his necktie and threw it aside. The young man nowadays is so energetic. He has to go to work tomorrow and but dare to have fun till midnight. (T/N: stalker-detected ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0))No wonder people say that three years difference is a generation-gap. He's just six or seven years older than these people and yet he feels like they live in two different worlds with these young people.However, when he was studying abroad, he did not seem to be as leisurely as they were. It seems that it has nothing to do with age and personality.Realising that he was thinking of something useless, Yan Mu stepped on the accelerator with one foot and a car that worth near ten million flew out at full speed.Inside the taxi, Lu Chengyu saw a black Maybach pa.s.s by behind him and couldn't help but to look at it more than twice.\u201cAi ya [2], that Maybach cost around 10 million dollars. I've seen pictures of this kind of car on the internet, and even its used cars ought to cost more than 8 million!\u201dThe taxi driver carefully drives his car away from the Maybach. \u201cI need to drive carefully when I see this kind of car. If I accidentally scratch it, I, ordinary person, can't afford to pay for it.\u201dHearing this, Chengyu felt sad, suddenly he realized that there is nothing to be excited when he got 19 million.Go to h.e.l.l, rich man! [3][1][2] \u54ce\u5440 [\u0101i y\u0101] : interjection of wonder, shock or admiration[3] Chengyu said \u201cGo to your sister\u201d but I change to \u201cGo to h.e.l.l\u201d because usually in Chinese, if they want to curse someone, they mention family, like your mom, (ni ma) etc. [On a side note, I don't think Chengyu want Yan Mu to go to someone else, he better go to h.e.l.l if he does that, hahaha, just kidding.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAwkward time with Yan Mu and Chengyu\u2026 (\u2044 \u2044\u2022\u2044\u03c9\u2044\u2022\u2044 \u2044)\u2044Chapter 7: Where is moral integrity?After a short month's renovation, Huading's internal affair restlessness slowly returned to the normal work pace. Due to the large scale of personnel mobilization, the staff left behind are particularly serious. Huading's salary and welfare are first-cla.s.s in the industry. Everyone is going all out, making sure that they able to stay in Huading. The more advantages one can get in the workplace, the more people are attracted to work here.When Lu Chengyu chooses Huading, other students who heard the news feel either regrettable or happy for Chengyu's misfortune. However, seeing Huading slowly and steadily gaining some momentum, many people began to sigh again. Chengyu really\u00a0worth to be the school figure, he has the ability to think in long-term.As long as Huading can slowly revive, Lu Chengyu can be hired again, which is more cost-effective for the company to pay his salary rather than hiring someone with experience. You know, everyone likes a person who doesn't leave you when you are in trouble and Chengyu choose to work in Huading during the turbulent time.Lu Chengyu is not interested in caring about what other students think of him. Since his past life, these people' opinions are not important\u00a0and even less important in this life.\u201cXiao Lu, there's a new Chinese restaurant under the company. I got a couple of coupons, two for you.\u201d said a female co-worker. She went to Lu Chengyu and put two coupons on his desk. \u201cTwo days ago, you brought us that dumpling, it tastes really good, where did you buy it?\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Lu Chengyu was not tried to be polite, he takes the coupon given by the female co-worker and began to explain,\u201d At the entrance, right corner of this company, their business is booming. I managed to buy it by queuing early. I was lucky that day.\u201dThis female co-worker is known as Tang Xuan, manager Luo's secretary. She is 26 \u2013 27 years old and has worked in Huading for two or three years. Manager Luo is around fifty years old woman who is very capable of working. Many people in the company respect and fear her. It's said that she is willing to work in Huading because she has a good relationship with the boss's mother.Lu Chengyu's work has occasional contact with Manager Luo, but he doesn't feel anything terrible about Manager Luo. In his past life, he has seen women with higher working ability.Tang Xuan looked at the time: \u201cIt's twelve o'clock. Continue your job after lunch.\u201d She had heard gossip about Lu Chengyu's ability is highly valued by top management. She thought it was just a rumour, but after working together, she felt that even if the top management does not value Lu Chengyu, they can't erase Lu Chengyu's excellence.She has worked for several years after graduating from university and hasn't seen such a good man for a long time. He looks handsome, has a nice personality, excellent ability and good manners. This is a model of a good man in China. If she hadn't been five years older than him, she would have decided to chase Chengyu.\u201cAlready lunch?\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at the time displayed on the computer desktop, then he saved the typed project doc.u.ment and added a pa.s.sword to it, \u201cLet's go together.\u201dThey went downstairs together to the restaurant on the 10th floor. There are free-meal for employee areas and small special stir-fried dish areas that required extra money. When Tang Xuan went to the free-meal area, Lu Chengyu went to the special stir-fried area and ordered several dishes. Then he finds a good seat and greets Tang Xuan to have dinner together. While they were eating, he inadvertently asks for some information about Huading's past.Since Lu Chengyu is not asking about taboos in the workplace, so Tang Xuan has nothing to hide. After dinner, Tang Xuan said, \u201cThere are rumours in the company that you are a rich second generation and you drive to work before you graduate.\u201dTang Xuan vaguely reminded Chengyu that someone in this company was gossiping behind his back. Lu Chengyu smiled and opened a bottle of drinks and handed it to the other party. \u201cIt only took about 100,000 yuan to buy a car and add a license to it. Is there a rich second generation like me?\u201d Then he kept his voice down and said mysteriously, \u201cLong ago, I won 200,000 yuan lottery tickets. I even cover my face when I go to collect the prize. Don't tell anyone.\u201dTang Xuan's eyes changed slightly and then she said, \u201cOK, having that good luck, you can't stop me from asking you to buy meals for me.\u201d\u201cDon't embarra.s.s me Sister Xuan, I need to pay tax for the 200,000 yuan lottery and only left with 160,000 yuan, plus there's not much left after I buy a car.\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed, \u201cBut since Sister Xuan has spoken, I'll invite our Secretariat to have dinner tonight. We'll go to either self-service hot pot [1] or hot skewers [2]. You can choose.\u201d\u201cIt's generous enough,\u201d Tang Xuan took a sip of the drink given. \u201cOkay, I'll tell them later, let's go to the self-service hot pot. Although there are many women in our department, they are heavy eater.\u201d\u201cOkay, I have to trouble you with this, Sister Xuan,\u201d Lu Chengyu laughed and he screwed the lid of another drink. His manner was full of gentleman's style.Tang Xuan remembered that the other party had opened a drink to herself first. Thinking about this, Tang Xuan is in a better mood and then she sighs again. It's a pity that he's much younger than her. She's not good at being in love with a younger man.From a corner, Cao Jingshen watched Tang Xuan and Lu Chengyu leave together. It has been only one month, but Lu Chengyu was so familiar with everyone in the department. Although Tang Xuan is only 26 \u2013 27 years old, many people can't catch up with her work's ability and interpersonal skills. She is Manager Luo most trusted person. She has never looked up to other male secretaries in the Secretarial Department and usually prefers to be with female secretaries. Everyone knows that Tang Xuan is a beautiful and independent woman, mostly being noticed as the Invisible Big Women, how can she get together with Lu Chengyu?Yan Mu finished his dinner and saw Cao Jingshen staring at the entrance of the restaurant, he wiped his mouth and ask, \u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d\u201cNothing, I just think Lu Chengyu is good to the opposite s.e.x.\u201d said Cao Jingchen, he unconsciously sighs a little, \u201cHe even able to take down a woman like Tang Xuan.\"Yan Mu looked across Cao Jingshen's face, he got up, took up the tray and slowly opened his mouth. \u201cIt's mainly because of how he looks.\u201dCao Jingshen looked at his boss's back and quietly took off his gla.s.ses and wiped them. Sometimes people with a lesser word can kill others when they speak.(T/N: Yan Mu told Jingshen that he is not handsome compared to Chengyu. Savage~)After work that day, Lu Chengyu went to eat hot pot with other colleagues and they went for karaoke. The next day, many people from the same department were close to Chengyu. This is because he was drunk and accidentally slips out that he won 200,000 yuan lottery, thus everyone knew that Chengyu was able to buy a car using that money. They all are making fun of his good fortune. Although there were people who envy, no one will be so jealous because of a mere 200,000 yuan. In this soaring price society, with 200,000 yuan, he can't even afford to buy a few square meters of a toilet in the second ring's property.Cao Jingshen didn't go to the party that evening, but after that party, he saw the people in the department treat\u00a0Chengyu differently. They become friendlier compared to before. He did not investigate what happened, but he thinks highly of Lu Chengyu. It wasn't easy for an intern to integrate with the other senior staff in Department so quickly. Even if everyone is polite because Lu Chengyu is his a.s.sistant, it will not really help him to enter the workers' circle. Furthermore, sometimes it was due to Lu Chengyu is his a.s.sistant, he will be even more unable to integrate into that circle.This is the same as the primary school students who have any secrets and will not tell their cla.s.smates who are the cla.s.s monitor, this is a natural psychological exclusion, To get rid of this psychological exclusion, it has depends on one's ability.Therefore, Lu Chengyu can do this step, enough to prove that he is not simple.Because Lu Chengyu is still in his internship period, Cao Jingshen naturally told Yan Mu about this matter. Yan Mu's response is still the same as usual, that is, no response.\u201cThere will be Q University Graduation Ceremony in a few days.\u201d Yan Mu signed his name on a doc.u.ment. \u201cThe degree certificate will be awarded.\u201dCao Jingshen was confused and he looks at Yan Mu.Yan Mu did not explain to him, but said, \u201cEmpty my schedule that day.\u201dCao Jing nodded his head when he heard Yan Mu. He recalled that there weren't any big cooperation plan last week, so he did not ask many questions.At the end of May, the weather was getting hotter. As soon as Lu Chengyu left his office, he felt that he could not breathe without the air conditioner. When he arrived at the underground parking lot and walked up to Ben Teng (his car's brand name [3]) while holding his car key, he was shocked to find that his little Ben Teng served as a foil to million-dollar Maybach beside it, making his car looks like a chunk of c.r.a.p.Lu Chengyu felt very envious and jealous. He looked up and down at Maybach, it's shine like black jewels. He even circled around it. Finally, he couldn't help but take out his mobile phone and take a photo of Ben Teng and Maybach. He erased the license plates and he sent the photo to his Weibo.\u201cAs a small Ben Teng car owner, I instantly understand what is the hatred of the rich when facing this sharp gap between the rich and the poor.\u201d After Chengyu edits this paragraph, Lu Chengyu posts it on his Weibo.Just when he successfully sent his post, the Maybach car's door in front of him was opened and he can see a shiny leather shoe stretched out from the car. The man who comes out from the car is not a stranger to Lu Chengyu. (T/N: WHAAATTT? YOU WERE INSIDE THE CAR?? \u2211(\uff9f\uff9b\uff9f\u3003))\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Yan Mu walk to Lu Chengyu and saw Chengyu put his mobile phone in his trousers pocket. He thought Chengyu was embarra.s.sed and handed the car key to him. \u201cDo you want to try it?\u201d\u201cI like the price of it more than the car.\u201d Lu Chengyu opens Yan Mu's car using the keys given. Then, he enters the car and touches the interior of that car. There no is embarra.s.sment shown in Chengyu's face. He gets out of the car and touched its door. \u201cIt's too expensive and I'm not confident to drive this car without shaking, better I don't do it.\u201dYan Mu nodded after he listens to Chengyu's excuses and he took the keys back. \u201cThere will be opportunities in the future, I'll drive and you sit.\u201dLu Chengyu saw Yan Mu's earnest face and didn't know what to say for a while. A person with this kind of personality tends to have a dedicated character. He thought about it and answered earnestly, \u201cThank you, boss. If there is a chance, I must sit in your car.\u201dYan Mu looked back at his Maybach, and after a long silence, \u201cDoesn't like cars.\u201dLu Chengyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dIn fact, sometimes too honest is also a disadvantage.(T/N: Yan Mu thought Chengyu like the car, but when I ask Chengyu if he wants to drive it, Chengyu reject it, so Yan Mu was like.. \u201coh, he doesn't like the car\u201d)\u201cWell, Boss, I'll go first,\u201d Lu Chengyu open his car's door and nodded to Yan Mu. He reverses the car and when the car came out at the corner of the parking lot, he saw from his rearview mirror that Yan Mu seemed to be still standing in that place.When he returned home, Chengyu found that his Weibo had an unprecedented amount of sharing and each of the forwarders expressed their happiness by taking pleasure in other peoples misfortune. The proof is that there a bunch of praising fanatics under his post in Weibo.This society's style to knee and lick the rich is too immoral. The most hateful thing is that he is not one of the rich people!(T/N: while others are praising how rich the car is, chengyu just feel a stab in his heart because it wasn't his car = other take pleasure(praising him) by his misfortune (not his car).)[1][2][3]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lu Chengyu drives to and from work every day. He glad that he doesn't have to squeeze into the bus. Waiting for a bus at a bus stop in this weather is like frying eggs on top of your head.Lu Chengyu's graduation ceremony will be held on June 1st, he has pa.s.sed his graduation thesis and defence. He was notified on May 30th. In his past life, he remembers that at this time of year, many parents took pictures with their children in Bachelor's clothes at Q University with cameras, and graduates' and their parents' faces were filled with joy and pride.Thinking of this, Lu Chengyu closed his mailbox, looked at the dense words on the word doc.u.ment, he exhaled, and continued to work on the project. He has looked up a lot of data in this project and even working on it every day. After investigating many markets, he had a general idea, which directly affected whether he could gain a firm foothold in Huading or not, so he didn't want to screw it up.In the afternoon, Lu Chengyu sent doc.u.ments to Cao Jingshen's office and told him that had to ask for leave on June 1st. Cao Jingshen knew he was going to attend the graduation ceremony, so he didn't make difficult for Chengyu, \u201cYou'll have to a party that evening since it's a graduation ceremony. Come back to work on June 3rd.\u201d\u201cThank you, Chief,\u201d said Lu Chengyu, putting down the doc.u.ment and smiling, \u201cI am touched by your generosity.\u201d\u201cThere's a lot of things that you'll feel touch in the future,\u201d Cao Jingshen take out a doc.u.ment and threw it at Lu Chengyu without raising his head, \u201cStop talking nonsense, help me send this doc.u.ment to the President Office. I'm going to the Personnel Department later. I don't have time to go up.\u201dLu Chengyu catches the doc.u.ment and stops talking. When he left the office, the smile on his face faded slightly while waiting for the elevator.On the first floor of the president's office, there is a solemn taste from inside to outside, which unconsciously arouses people's spirits. Lu Chengyu knocked on the President Office's door. When he went in, he saw Yan Mu writing on a notebook without facial expression.Sensing him come in, Yan Mu stopped writing: \u201cSend doc.u.ments? Just put it on the table.\u201dLu Chengyu has become accustomed to the way his boss looks stiff and talks less. He put down the doc.u.ment and get ready to leave the room. He was stopped before reaching the door.\u201cThe day after tomorrow is your university's graduation ceremony. I have a research project to cooperate with your university. Let's go together later.\u201d After Yan Mu finish speaking, he hesitated for a moment and added a question, \u201cAll right?\u201d These two words are somewhat stiff as if they were squeezed out from him.\u201cIt's just that, I don't know if we are going from the same way.\u201d Lu Chengyu hesitated for a moment, but when he looked at Yan Mu's stern face, he changed his mind, \u201cIf it isn't inconvenient to Boss, let's go together.\u201dAlthough the change rate of his boss's face and expression is very low, he can still see that the other side wants to agree with the proposal.\u201cGood, I will pick up you in the morning.\u201d Yan Mu look at the door, \u201cGo back to work.\u201dLu Chengyu raised his eyebrows and irrefutably went out of the office. Of course, he didn't forget to close the door behind him. In his heart, he knew that Yan Mu plan to give him some important position in Huading, or else, why would he spend money and energy to him? (T/N: It's love..)Chengyu remembered clearly about the man who wanted to do unwritten rule [1] with him from his past life\u00a0history. At that time, this man wanted to cooperate with Huading. Unfortunately, Huading's top management board look down to him, so he went to please the staff inside Huading. Afterwards, Chengyu didn't know how that man did it but he really got on a big boat named Huading, made a lot of money and then he began to invest in the entertainment industry. The man was lucky enough to invest in a successful film as soon as he entered the circle, and then gain a firm foothold in the entertainment circle as well.If it weren't for this, that man wouldn't have been so stable in the entertainment industry that no one can force him to stay out of this industry.What he has to do now is to chop down that man's source of money. Without it, there will be no problem. Without money, what kind of movie investment can he do? Without money and status, how can he threaten others to do unwritten rules with him?Lu Chengyu sneers while thinking of this. His favourite thing now was to pit to death those who had offended him in his past life.Ai yo [2], what a petty man, really making others ashamed of him and yet he would rather die than repent.Lu Chengyu has two Weibo's account. One is an account that he used all the time named \u2018Chengyu' and the posts' content are proper, serious and full of high-grade information. In this Weibo, most of his friends are the people who know him from his college, high school alumni and some familiar relatives and friends.Another account is called \u201d Extra Fish Yu\u201d which full with all kinds of roasting and ridiculing post of wretched things. His followers are the people who he doesn't know on the Internet. There are large fans in both of his Weibo. Lu Chengyu didn't feel any discomfort being a guy with who post elegantly on one side and crudely on the other side, he even feels an indescribable sense of comfort in his heart.[Extra Fish Yu]: The big boss said that he would drive with me to the university to attend the Graduation ceremony. What should I do in case I feel a loss in a luxury car, which is worth tens of millions of dollars? What should I do to make people feel that I am cool and n.o.ble, not that I have never seen the world before?Soon, under this post, there's a lot of people \u2018like' it and afterwards, people with correct advice slowly emerges. As for the word \u2018together' that been mention in comments, Lu Chengyu calmly ignored it. Everyone can joke casually across a network, but there will be serious people as well as people who are fooling around.Early that morning, as soon as Lu Chengyu washed and changed his clothes, the mobile phone on the table rang. When he saw the caller ID is someone he doesn't know, Chengyu hesitated to pick up the phone until he realized that Yan Mu's car is downstairs.He went to the window, opened the curtain and looked down. He saw the envious Maybach parked in the temporary parking s.p.a.ce outside the building. Yan Mu is standing straight like a ramrod beside the car's door and exuded his \u2018don't-come-close' aura surrounds him.When he went downstairs to Yan Mu, Chengyu saw Yan Mu's posture remain unchanged. He smiled and said, \u201cI am sorry for having kept you waiting for so long.\u201d\u201cIt's okay,\u201d Yan Mu looked at his wrist.w.a.tch. \u201cGet on the car, we'll have breakfast before we go.\u201dLu Chengyu opened the front pa.s.senger's door and sat down. Then he showed Yan Mu the way to go to the breakfast shop for breakfast.The breakfast shop is not big. There are several clean tables and the shop owner is a middle-aged couple. When they see Lu Chengyu come in, the proprietress greeted with a laugh, \u201d Xiao Yu is here. How old are you today?\u201d When she saw Lu Chengyu followed by an extraordinary man, she asked, \u201cThis your friend, what do you want to eat?\u201dYan Mu looked at the small breakfast shop and then looked at Lu Chengyu.\u201cHe will be having the same as me.\u201d Lu Chengyu took two pairs of chopsticks and sat down with Yan Mu on a small table. He said as he handed them to Yan Mu, \u201cThere are many thin stuffed buns in this shop. The eggs are all eggs from local chicken collected from the countryside. Soybean milk and fried sticks are also tasty and hygienic. Wait until you taste it.\u201dAfter taking over the chopsticks, Yan Mu listened to Lu Chengyu's words and nodded, \u201cI am not a picky eater.\u201dThe proprietress quickly brought up what Lu Chengyu wanted. Two bowls of steaming steamed buns, four fried sticks, two eggs, two gla.s.s of soybean milk, plus two small pickles' dishes that look crisp and delicious.Then Yan Mu saw Lu Chengyu eating fried dough sticks and drinking soybean milk which is obviously greasy, but the person who sits in front of him can eat so well and quickly and he couldn't find even half of the ugly appearance that he usually saw when other people eat this.Yan Mu unable to restrain himself, he grabs a steamed stuffed bun [3] and put it in his mouth. This bun is a mushroom and chicken stuffing. It tastes delicious and not greasy. It tastes better than many big hotels.Then he learns to eat fried dough sticks [4] like Chengyu. But since he was not fond of fried food since childhood, he finished a fried stick and didn't taste anything special about it.\u201cAre you done?\u201d Lu Chengyu finished his breakfast and saw Yan Mu had a small bag of a fried stick left in front of him.\u201cFull,\u201d Yan Mu wiped his mouth and said with a wooden expression, \u201cIt's delicious.\u201dIs he trying to explain that he didn't finish eating wasn't because he dislikes the breakfast' taste but because he was too full to eat?Lu Chengyu couldn't help but look at Yan Mu's eyes. Somehow he feels that Yan Mu who's in front of him a quite dull, there must be something wrong in his brain.Lu Chengyu naturally picks up the leftover foods and eats it. After that, he wiped his mouth and gets up to pay for the bill.\u201cI pay.\u201d Yan Mu stood up after seeing Chengyu wants to pay for the bill.\u201cTake it as I'm paying for the gas,\u201d Lu Chengyu laughed and took out some quarters to pay the proprietress. \u201d It doesn't cost a lot boss, don't mention it. If we have a big meal together in the future, I'm sure I won't s.n.a.t.c.h the opportunity to pay from you.\u201dSpeaking of this, Chengyu suddenly remembered that when he first met Yan Mu, he spends more than 8,000 yuan to pay for a meal. Suddenly felt a little pain in his heart.\u201cFine.\u201d Yan Mu nodded and he kept in his mind that he would pay for Chengyu when they had a big meal together.When they returned to the car, Lu Chengyu took two pieces of chewing gum from his pocket and shoved one of it to his mouth and gave one piece to Yan Mu. When he saw the doubtful stares from Yan Mu, he began to explain, \u201cSteamed buns' smell is heavy. We should pay more attention to them on some occasions.\u201dThen, for the first time in his life, Yan Mu drive a car while chewing a gum. He felt that it is acceptable.After they reach to the university, both of them went to separate ways. Lu Chengyu had to go to the auditorium to attend the graduation ceremony and take a picture of graduation while Yan Mu went to talk to the professor of the research inst.i.tute.After entering the auditorium, Lu Chengyu found the number area a.s.signed to his cla.s.s. He can see that Zhu Guanglin and Zhang Hong have arrived, while Chen Jin is sitting next to them.When Zhu Guanglin and Zhang Hong saw Lu Chengyu, they asked him to come and sit down. Lu Chengyu smiled and sat down in the empty seat next to the three men. Then he said, \u201cYou three come early.\u201d\u201cHow can we come late? Both of us wake up before 6 o'clock today.\u201d Zhu Guanglin touched his hair. \u201cThen we came by bus. The crowded bus almost messes up the hairstyle that I did yesterday.\u201d\u201cThat's just your usual hairstyle after you wake up, you didn't go to any hairstylist yesterday and it's not because of the bus,\u201d Lu Chengyu raised eyebrows. \u201cDon't give a c.r.a.p excuses for you messy hairstyle.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d Zhu Guanglin gave him a slap on his back and saw Lu Chengyu dressed neatly. He looks so handsome and there was a refreshing smell all over him. Zhu Guanglin couldn't help sighing, \u201cSure enough, a handsome guy can wear anything perfectly, even their hair and clothes are nicely lined.\u201d\u201cDidn't you know nowadays was face-seeing society[5]?\u201d Zhang Hong approached and said in a slightly obscene tone, \u201cBy the way, Chen Ya asked people to inquire about your news the other day, do you know?\u201dChen Jin, sitting next to him, heard Zhang Hong's remark. His face changed slightly. Chen Ya was the cla.s.s flower of his cla.s.s. She was beautiful and had a good personality. She also lives around here. Therefore, he knows that her family conditions were very good. There are rumours in the cla.s.s that she likes Lu Chengyu. Although it has not been confirmed, in recent years he has found that Chen Ya is really treated Lu Chengyu different from other people.Maybe it is because of this that Lu Chengyu is so disdainful of his intention. Without him, there are Chen Ya, or w.a.n.g Ya and Zhang Ya, how could Lu Chengyu take a fancy to him?Only he was foolish enough to go and confess, and the result was nothing but an embarra.s.sment to each other.\u201cWhere did you hear the gossip?\u201d Lu Chengyu shook his head helplessly. \u201cChen Ya's mother knows my mother and because I changed my mobile phone number without telling her, she asks Chen Ya to ask me. Don't talk nonsense. Be careful, don't make Chen Ya slap your face.\u201d What Chengyu said was half true and half false. The true part is their mother really know each other, but the false part is the reason why Chen Ya was looking for him.He had explicitly refused Chen Ya the other day and he didn't want to talk about it. If this kind of thing spread out, maybe others will praise him as a charming devil seducer, but for girls, it is a very hurtful thing. Real men won't gossip about women's feelings.When Chen Jin heard this, he had a bitter smile on his face. This man always does this. He is polite in everything he does. He suddenly realized that perhaps Lu Chengyu was just being ridiculous to him as to other female cla.s.smates.He feels that he hates people like Lu Chengyu. Maybe what he needs is a man who is only good to him, a man other than Lu Chengyu.[1] unwritten rules: a sponsor or investor ask you to sleep with them, then they will provide chances in movie etc for you.[2] \u54ce\u54df [\u0101i y\u014d]: Oh, dear!; Ouch!; Ow!; Good gracious! ;[3][4][5] face-seeing society: a person worth (such as trustworthiness, attraction, etc) is being judged just by looking at his/her face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then the graduate representative came on stage to give a speech. When Zhang Hong and Zhu Guanglin both looked at Lu Chengyu who didn't have any ma.n.u.script with him, they were stunned. They did not think that the graduate chosen to represent the university is their own dormitory brothers.There was a roar of applause, especially among the girls, as soon as Chengyu went up to the stage. For girls, Lu Chengyu is good-looking, good-natured and respectful to girls. Such a man is always appreciated by girls, so once he comes on stage, he gets a lot of cheers.\u201cFemale comrades applauds so warmly that when I step down, I don't know if I won't be beaten by my male comrades. Please take it slowly. If I go back to work with an ugly appearance that will affect the company's image, my boss would've fired me.\u201d Lu Chengyu stepped onto the stage and made a fearful expression, which caused the whole audience to laugh. The envy and jealousy feelings in the male comrades dissipated because the other side is just like them, he also was afraid of the boss and worried about work. What he feels is relatable to others which make people dispel that sentiment.\u201cI am both honoured and worried to be elected as a representative of graduates. Thank you very much for the trust of teachers and cla.s.smates. As one of the students that are graduating, standing on this rostrum, I remember the four years I spend in university.\u201d With a smile on his face, Chengyu began to talk about the university's past and the big auditorium gradually quieted down. Many people recalled their four years of university, thinking that this will be their final relaxing years.Hearing Lu Chengyu's speech, many people started to realize that there were so many wonderful happenings in these four years. But after they stepped out from this campus, they will become the members of busy work life. No one knows whether their future gonna be ordinary or magnificent, but the four years that they spend in the university will always exist in their life.\u201cHuman life is like a long river with an end. What we have to do is to let the river pa.s.s through as many beautiful places as possible. When the river dries up, we should not have too many regrets when we recall yesterday. Today is the last time that we sit in the Q University's hall as students, but we are always Q Uni' adults. What is the school motto of Q University?\u201d\u201cGentlemen strive for self-improvement!\u201d Someone answered loudly below.\u201cYes, regardless you win or lose, gentlemen should strive for self-improvement constantly. I wish all the alumni present here a vast expanse of sky and sea in this lifetime and continuous self-improvement!\u201dMost of the former graduate representatives read their ma.n.u.scripts on the stage. When the school leaders saw Lu Chengyu went on stage without any ma.n.u.script, they were worried.But after listening to Lu Chengyu's speech, they were relieved and nodded in their hearts. The representative selected this time has good mental quality and good physical condition. At this school forum, there will never be any complaints from girls. Every graduation ceremony representatives are people who can't see their faces with the bottom of the bottle. (T/N: representative usually reads from the ma.n.u.script that others can't see their face.)After Lu Chengyu finished his speech, he bowed on the stage and to the teachers who are sitting. Then he calmly stepped down from the platform and went to his seat.Q University is a famous university in China. So every year, the graduation ceremony receives a lot of attention. Some media even find photos of handsome men and women in bachelor's robe and upload them to increase the exposure of its official Weibo.When Lu Chengyu stood on the platform, some girls took pictures of him. At the end of the graduation ceremony, the cla.s.s photo is taken in the auditorium, and after that, the graduates are free to take their own photos.Zhang Hong and Zhu Guanglin worked tirelessly to take pictures of anyone who wish to take pictures with Lu Chengyu and most of it was female students. The male students are just there to enjoy liveliness.After dealing with a large number of people, Zhang Hong and Zhu Guanglin hang weakly on Lu Chengyu's shoulders, Zhang Hong let out a long heavy sigh, \u201cLao San, if you go on like this, your two brothers will be envy, jealous and hate you. You are the winner in your life but a public enemy of a man.\u201d\u201cWe've been together for four years. Don't you know me yet?\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at Zhang Hong sadly, \u201cYou guys are my most important people.\u201d\u201cf.u.c.k, Lao Tzu feel disgusted.\u201d Zhang Hong and Zhu Guanglin pushed Lu Chengyu aside at the same time. When they saw that Chengyu fell to the gra.s.s in a better posture than others, they scolded at the same time, \u201cd.a.m.n!\u201dWhile sitting cross-legged on the gra.s.s, Lu Chengyu watched two middle-aged couples waiting nearby. It was Zhu Guanglin and Zhang Hong's parents. If they accompanied their sons all the time, they are afraid Chengyu feels uncomfortable since he didn't have parents. Although Chengyu has a miserable past life, Zhu Guanglin and Zhang Hong's parents have helped Chengyu a lot to get through it.He smiled at the two men and took off his bachelor's hat. \u201cUncles and aunts are here too. Go and walk with them around the university. I'm going to continue my life as a winner and take pictures with beautiful women.\u201dZhu Guanglin wanted to say something, but Zhang Hong opened his mouth first. He smiled and said, \u201cThat's all right. Without your brothers, let see if you can find any beautiful lady.\u201d\u201cGet lost,\u201d Lu Chengyu stand up of the gra.s.s and patted the gra.s.s on his clothes. \u201cHaven't you heard the saying that gold shines everywhere?\u201dAfter both of them left, Lu Chengyu sat in the shade while holding to his degree certificate. He leaned against the trunk, and under his b.u.t.tocks was a cold meadow. He stretched his legs and looked at the smiling students on the gra.s.s, his smile faded a bit.Occasionally someone came and sit down with him to take a photo. He laughed and agree with it. All these people came over anxiously and left with a laugh. Only he sat where he was and had not moved.This is because other trees' shades are full of people. If he leaves, this place might be taken by someone else. On such a hot day, this trees' shade is a good place.The summer winds are blowing and as he listens to the sound of laughter around, Lu Chengyu leisurely stretched his lazy waist. He looks at the white flowers on the gra.s.s and began to close his eyes and relax his mind.When he closed his eyes, his hearing seems to get sharper. As soon as he heard someone is coming close to him, Chengyu opens his eyes.\u201cBoss?\u201d Lu Chengyu blinked and watched as Yan Mu squatted in front of him, holding two bottles of cold drinks in his hand. It was unexpected, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dQ University is so big. What are the chances that Yan Mu are able to find him sitting under a tree? How much coincidence does it take?\u201cI just pa.s.sed by and saw you sitting under the tree,\u201d Yan Mu handed the water to Lu Chengyu. \u201cIt's cold.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu took the drink, unscrewed the bottle cap and took a sip. Instantly he feels refreshed. Lu Chengyu notice that Yan Mu was still squatting in front of him, he asked, \u201cIs the discussion with the professor done?\u201dYan Mu nodded. \u201cHmm, we worked together before.\u201d\u201cIs the company moving towards biology industries?\u201d Lu Chengyu thought about it. Biology is widely used. Many industries are linked to biology. But the pre-investment is very big. Although there are some risks, the returns are quite high.\u201cJust try it first,\u201d Yan Mu learns Chengyu manner on how to sit down on gra.s.s.\u201d But our company will be focusing mainly on electronics and real estate.\u201dPreviously, Huading doesn't have a connection with any other company or family that can help them when it comes to real estate, they can't gain profit in this field. Lu Chengyu suddenly understands the conversation between Yan Mu and Yan Lao Er before. Now he realized that Mu family was the first-cla.s.s family in Beijing. Yan Mu had such a background, with a firm vision and a hard wrist, no wonder Huading was the leader in the business circle later.\u201cNow the entertainment industry is developing very fast. If the boss is interested, you can try to think about it,\u201d Lu Chengyu carelessly shook his drink, \u201cThis is just an idea for development since Huading hasn't been able to make money from real estate.\u201dYan Mu looked at the certificate that was beside by Lu Chengyu. \u201cEntertainment industry?\u201d\u201cYes, like investing in movies or TV shows,\u201d laughed Lu Chengyu, \u201cAs long as you invest in good scripts, sometimes they are low-cost, high-recovery, andthere are also women's products, which are very profitable industries.\u201d\u201cHuading will not be involved in the entertainment industry, not suitable.\u201d Yan Mu shook his head.Lu Chengyu understands where Yan Mu is coming from. Although the momentum of Huading is declining, Mu family is the backbone of this company now. Hence, when it comes to entertainment, it does taste like self-depreciation. The older generation probably thinks that the entertainment circle is not so respectable, although Lu Chengyu feels that this is nonsense.\u201cBut I will consider private investment,\u201d Yan Mu said to Lu Chengyu, who thought he was unhappy because he refused his (LCY) idea. \u201cI don't think the entertainment industry is bad.\u201d\u201cEntertainment circles are not as good as they are,\u201d Lu Chengyu said indifferently, \u201cas long as the profit is good enough.\u201d\u201cHmm,\u201d Yan Mu looks at the certificate again, he hesitated for a while before he opened his mouth, \u201cLet me take some pictures for you.\u201dLu Chengyu was stunned and did not know what to say for a while.\u201cDon't want?\u201d Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu with a wooden face, touched the watch on his wrist, and silent.\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu handed him his mobile phone, put on his bachelor's hat, and took a few steps with a smile to take up the certificate. \u201cMake me look handsome.\u201dYan Mu nodded, take the mobile phone and took a picture for Lu Chengyu. After taking a few pictures, their location began to shift and began to take pictures in other corners of Q University.\u201cSo many pictures of me. Let's take a picture together.\u201d When Lu Chengyu took the mobile phone and was ready to ask a pa.s.sing cla.s.smate to help him take a picture, he found that the mobile phone had low power, and automatically turned off the camera function, \u201cNo power.\u201dA black cell phone handed him in front of him. \u201cUse mine.\u201d\u201cOkay, remember to forward this picture to me later.\u201d Lu Chengyu took the cell phone from Yan Mu and saw a schoolgirl coming across the street. She smiled gently. \u201cYoung sister, please do me a favour.\u201dWhen she saw the one who talks to her is in his bachelor's clothes, she knew that he was a graduate. When she looked carefully, she said happily: \u201cSenior Lu?\u201d Then she saw a man standing not far away, thinking that he was Lu Chengyu's relative; she promised to help him.Lu Chengyu went to Yan Mu and put his hand around his shoulder, signalling 1,2,3 toward the camera. As for Yan Mu, his mouth moved and he shows a scrupulous smile.The little young sister and Lu Chengyu took a photo together before she leaves happily. Lu Chengyu took off his bachelor's hat and robe and wiped his sweat. \u201cIt's really hot. Let's go to lunch. There's a lot of delicious foods near Q University.\u201dJust then, he saw Liang Deyou and Chen Jin coming this way across the corner.Yan Mu found that his face was not right, he looks at Chengyu's line of sight but unfortunately, there were many people on the road, he did not know what Lu Chengyu saw.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For a while, three of them didn't speak about anything.Liang Deyou knows himself well, that he liked Chen Jin. Therefore, has a sense of rejection towards Lu Chengyu, his potential rival, and very happy to see Lu Chengyu feel depressed.He'll make Chen Jin understand that such a man as Lu Chengyu is not worth liking at all. The only person worth to accompanies him is Liang Deyou.He has a good family background and has been favoured by his elders since childhood. Everyone around him flattered him and wanted some benefit from him. Only Chen Jin is different from these people, and naturally, he will not let such a special person leave his side.As for Lu Chengyu, he lives in a circle of people who he(LD) has never seen. Lu Chengyu is an exquisite person. This kind of person usually pays more attention to interests than justice. In the critical moment, the first person to run away must be Lu Chengyu.Maybe he looked at Lu Chengyu with prejudice from the beginning. So he believes that the other side has no good quality. Liang Deyou hates many people these years, and Lu Chengyu is just one of it, isn't it easy for him to hate a person without any reason?As long as these two people who tired with each other stands together, they emanate a kind of unexplainable rejection aura surround them. Lu Chengyu looked at Chen Jin with a smile and said nothing.\u201cYour speech today is wonderful,\u201d Chen Jin said after a long silence. \u201cA lot of people are crazy about your speech.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled. \u201cWe're going to have lunch later. Shall we go together?\u201dWhen Chen Jin heard the word \u201cwe\u201d, he found a man who a few steps behind Lu Chengyu wearing a white shirt and place a suit coat on his arm. He had never seen the man but guessed that the man was Lu Chengyu's relative. Then, he nodded to the man and said, \u201cNo, I've already discussed with Deyou about a place to eat.\u201dLiang Deyou, unlike Chen Jin, saw at a glance that the person behind Lu Chengyu was not a simple person. He smiled and said, \u201d Mr Lu's friends are really extraordinary.\u201dLu Chengyu's smile remained unchanged: \u201cMr Liang needn't belittle yourself, you are not ordinary either.\u201dLiang Deyou laughed and said, \u201cA man who talks smoothly often strong in appearance but weak in reality [1].\u201d He turned around and hug Chen Jin's shoulder as if unintentionally do that, \u201cXiao Jin, where is the store you just told me? I'm hungry.\u201dIt turned out that from the beginning, the two of them had an affair. Lu Chengyu looked at Liang Deyou, who deliberately showed his affections in front of him. He put his hand in his trousers pocket and said gracefully, \u201cNow that you two have a place to go, I won't bother you either. Goodbye.\u201dChen Jin moved his lips, looked at Liang Deyou, who was still hugging his shoulder, and eventually, he didn't say anything.Liang Deyou, however, found it a little boring. Lu Chengyu had a graceful manner from beginning to end, which made him seem to make trouble out of nothing [2]. If he knows that it's going to be like this, he wouldn't reject Lu Chengyu's resume in the beginning. If Lu Chengyu was working in Liang's office now, Liang Deyou believes that he wouldn't dare to use this kind of att.i.tude towards him.Lu Chengyu is a man who is good at seeing the wind and steering the rudder and disregard moral principles in pursuit of profit [3].When Lu Chengyu moved away from them, Chen Jin pushed Liang Deyou aside and frowned. \u201cYou are going too far with what you said just now\u201d\u201cWhere is it going too far?\u201d Liang De sneered and looked at Lu Chengyu's departure direction. It didn't take much to clean up such a powerless person.\u201cThose two were your cla.s.smates just now?\u201d After reaching to the Q University's gate, Yan Mu asked, \u201cIs there any problem?\u201d\u201cOne of them is my cla.s.smate and the other is his friend,\u201d Lu Chengyu bought a bag at a boutique on the roadside and put all his certificates and bachelor's robe in it, \u201cThere are indeed some problems.\u201dThey walked side by side along the roads which have stalls selling various kinds of food on both sides. Yan Mu, whose appearance is a little out of tune with the surrounding, walks on this road and looks at people that come and go. He tries to remember words that have to do with easing someone out from his anxiety, until a few moments later, he dryly said just three words, \u201cDon't be sad.\u201d (T/N: I thought you are going to say \u201cI love you\u201d hahaha)Faced with his boss's lack of vocabulary, Lu Chengyu has accepted the words calmly. He took Yan Mu to the restaurant he used to go to and found a good place to sit down. Then he said, \u201cThe price of this shop is not comparable to Baiweixuan, but it tastes good.\u201d After that, he pa.s.ses the menu to Yan Mu.Looking at the menu in hand, the name and price of the dish printed on A4 paper are sealed with plastic film, to protect it from oil and water. There is no pattern on it. The only advantage is that the black characters on the white background can be seen at a glance.Two popular dishes were ordered. Yan Mu handed back the menu to Lu Chengyu. He ordered several dishes skillfully. He didn't even need to look at the menu. The waiter who wrote down the names of the dishes beside him also speak in familiar ways, \u201cDo you want to add a boiled fish? This morning, fishes from Huang He River just arrived and still alive and jumping. If you want, we can kill one for you.\u201d\u201cWell, don't pick too big, or we can't finish it,\u201d said Lu Chengyu while smiling. After the waiter to left, tore up a set of disposable utensils in front of him, \u201cThere will be few opportunities to eat in these places in the future.\u201dYan Mu silently tore up his disposable utensils and waited for the dishes, cups and chopsticks set, he said: \u201cIf you want to eat later, you can drive over.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled, but he knew very well that in the future, he would have less time to spend in these places. He has so much to do that he doesn't know if he can achieve it.A dish was served quickly and the last one served was boiled fish. After the meal, both of them eats till their stomach stretch out. Yan Mu could not believe that he would eat so uncontrollably after he walks out of the restaurant.The afternoon in June is not suitable for walking. Yan Mu didn't say that he would leave immediately. Lu Chengyu took him to a book bar near Q University to pa.s.s the time. The book bar offers free books, but the seats, coffee and tea cost money. It's a good place for some poor middle-cla.s.s' young people to spend their time.Yan Mu ordered a cup of coffee while Lu Chengyu ordered a cup of tea. They chose a small round table by the window to sit down. They took the books they wanted to read and sat quietly. Although they did not speak, the atmosphere was very good.After reading prose, Yan Mu took his eyes off the book and looked up to the opposite side. He saw that the young man had fallen asleep on the sofa, and there was a joke book on his knee. It's unexpected that someone would sleep in such an elegant manner and read a joke book.With a smile on his lips, Yan Mu dropped his head down and continued to read his prose. He suddenly felt that it was interesting to occasionally leave his circle on a quiet afternoon and just relax quietly.Lu Chengyu woke up after nearly an hour's sleep. He rubbed his sore neck and saw Yan Mu holding a collection of essays. He looked out of the window and see the white sunlight. He took a pen and note paper in the box on the table and drew a kitten.Yan Mu saw his action and knew that he was bored, so he closed his book and made a gesture \u2018lets-go' towards him.Two people walk out of the book bar around 3 or 4 o'clock. Both of them stare at the afternoon sun and decided to stroll around Q University. They saw a lotus pond in which the lotus blossoms just right, the grove where lovers often go and other interesting places.On their way, Yan Mu saw people who knew Lu Chengyu greet him from time to time when they saw him. When they found a bench under the shade of a tree and sat down on it, they both realized the beauty of shade.Yan Mu pulled up his shirt sleeve and looked at a teaching building hidden behind a tree shadow. \u201cYour university is beautiful.\u201d\u201cAfter watching it for four years, I have\u00a0got used to its' beautiful appearance,\u201d said Lu Chengyu while uns.c.r.e.w.i.n.g the drink bottle's cap that he bought on the road. Lu Chengyu smiled and shook his head, \u201cAt the beginning, my parents told me that when I graduated, I must choose the most beautiful place in the university and take a picture with them. As a result, the loving couple left me to take pictures here alone, and the place that I thought was beautiful became ordinary. \u201cYan Mu nodded: \u201cWhen I graduated, I was the same as you.\u201d When he was studying abroad, his mother had died of illness, but his father only cares about his lover's illegitimate son. Grandpa was old and could not go abroad freely. Therefore, there was no family to accompany him during his graduation ceremony.\u201cSince we are talking about this, I want to thank the boss for accompanying me for so long,\u201d Lu Chengyu holds a cold drink bottle. \u201cWithout you, I would really be taking a photo alone.\u201d\u201cDon't mention it.\u201d Yan's eyes moved from Lu Chengyu to the green gra.s.s, still expressionless, \u201cI just happen to come here.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu expressionless, few words man, he suddenly feels the rumours about number one man in \u201cHighly Eligible Bachelor\u201d ranking doesn't seem true. Yan Mu isn't t seem so cool, n.o.ble or difficult to get along with.Yan Mu left at about 5 p.m., and Lu Chengyu was going to attend the cla.s.s graduation party at 6 p.m. So he did not hold Yan Mu up. By the time he arrived at the hotel, half of them are the students arrives are from his cla.s.s which have more than forty students.When he arrived, his cla.s.smates greeted him, and a group of people soon gathered together to talk about what they had encountered in their work. After going out to work only for more than a month, many students have become more mature than before.Some people asked Lu Chengyu about Huading. Lu Chengyu said helplessly, \u201cIf I had known the inside information of Huading, I would have been the Huading senior executive and have been a successful person by now.\u201d Now that he has entered the workplace, he has to remember his ident.i.ty and can not disclose the company's affairs. Who knows, maybe the cla.s.smates are from the rival company?\u201cWhat a brag!\u201dThe boys laughed loudly. Everyone was a fresh graduate. Even if they came out of a famous school, the company could not permanently hire them immediately. So no one felt that Lu Chengyu had told a lie, but started to play a joke on Lu Chengyu. Lu Chengyu was not angry. He immediately made fun of each other with these boys. Anyway, he would not lose anything by doing that.When the atmosphere was right, the cla.s.s monitor counted the number of people and found that there seemed to be one person missing. For a while he did not know who was missing, so he had to ask his roommate to check who was not here. If he finds out who hasn't come, he would call that person immediately. After all, everyone else is ready for dinner.Zhu Guanglin pulled Zhang Hong and Lu Chengyu aside and whispered, \u201cIt seems that Chen Jin hasn't arrived yet.\u201dLu Chengyu did not speak. He was not fit to take care of Chen Jin's affairs. So he to show helpless look to Zhu Guanglin. When he was going to ask the other party to call Chen Jin, he saw Chen Jin come in from outside. Chen Jin chose a place that has some distance from Lu Chengyu and sat down without saying a word.Zhu Guanglin has a fierce temper. Seeing Chen Jin like this, he could not help frowning, but he noticed that neither Zhang Hong nor Lu Chengyu had much reaction, so he had to bear his heart's discontent, and the three men sat down side by side, just as if nothing had happened.Other interested students in the cla.s.s also found that there was something wrong with several people, but Chen Jin was usually alone and arrogant. Most of them had a better relationship with Lu Chengyu. Seeing that the three of them did not say anything, others certainly would not open their mouths. As soon as the dishes were served, they began to pour wine to each other.At this time, no one has any scruples. After all, it is the last time to be crazy in College life. Even girls like Chen Ya began to roll her sleeves and toast. In a place like Q, the most beautiful woman is not a delicate woman, but a beautiful paper woman [5].After Chen Ya and other girls fill up several boys' cup, Chen Ya put a bottle of cold wine in front of Lu Chengyu again, \u201cLu Chengyu, in the future we will go to different places. Everyone gathers, will you drink or not this wine?\u201d\u201cA wine from a beauty, even if I have to lie on my stomach down the table, I will drink it,\u201d Lu Chengyu picked up the bottle, smiled at Chen Ya and poured the whole bottle in front of the whole cla.s.s.Chen Ya looked at the way he looked up and drank. His eyes were calm with friendship. When he finished drinking, Chen Ya reached out and patted him on the shoulder. She looks at him like a good brother, \u201cOkay, sister won't embarra.s.s you. Later on, when you come to eat my mother cooked dinner, don't tell that sister drink wine ah.\u201d(T/N: Chen Ya called herself \u2018sister' when speaking to Chengyu)\u201cNo problem, Lord Queen.\u201d Lu Chengyu knows that Chen Ya accepts him as a friend. He remembers that Chen Ya was the same in his past life. She dared to love and to regret, able to put an end to her feelings and finally she married a good man who could cook.The rest of the cla.s.s started to fuss when Lu Chengyu drank the whole bottle of wine in one breath. After hearing what Chen Ya said, everyone finally believed what Lu Chengyu said before. It seems that Chen Ya really has no other meaning to Lu Chengyu. It turns out that because the two families have known each other for a long time that Chen Ya treat Lu Chengyu different from other people.It's not a secret in the cla.s.s that Lu Chengyu's parents died unexpectedly. So during this time, n.o.body made fun of Chen Ya and Lu Chengyu. Instead, they rushed together to fill Lu Chengyu cup and the cla.s.s flower cup that challenges Chengyu to drink.A group of people drank in disorder. Someone came to Chen Jin to propose a toast, but Chen Jin refused the toast directly. The toaster was quite drunk. He said directly, \u201cYou don't have to drink this wine, but it really doesn't give face to your buddies ah.\u201d(T/N: the toaster means that Chen Jin can choose to reject his toast, but that means Chen Jin, as a friend, didn't give face to him)Chen Jin looked at the gla.s.s of wine in front of him and remained motionless. \u201cDrinking is bad for your health. Even if you don't drink this gla.s.s of wine, whoever is your buddy, remains your buddy, whoever isn't your buddy, remains not your buddy. Regardless of how much not your buddy drink wine, if he's not your buddy, then he won't be your buddy.\u201d\u201cIf you don't want to drink, just say so, don't have to give so many reasons,\u201d the toaster took the gla.s.s and was somewhat unhappy with Chen Jin's words, he starts complaining, \u201cgo on with that att.i.tude, looks who's gonna like you.\u201dThe atmosphere was awkward and the speaker was drunk, but many people were still sober. Chen Jin, who had not drunk, was even soberer. He looked at the speaker calmly and said, \u201cw.a.n.g Yang, what do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cYou don't understand what I mean?!\u201d w.a.n.g Yang slams his gla.s.s on the table and spilt most of the wine, \u201cAlways put on an unhappy look, did someone owes you something?\u201d\u201cw.a.n.g Yang, what nonsense are you saying when you were drunk?\u201d The monitor didn't want to spoil the graduation party because it was the last meal in their college life. So he took w.a.n.g Yang to his side and ask him to sit down. He poured him a cup of tea to him and saw that he seemed to be sobering up. The monitor said to Chen Jin, \u201cChen Jin, don't bother with a drunkard. He is angry at work and drinks madly.\u201dw.a.n.g Yang also knows that he has made a mistake. Although he does not appreciate Chen Jin's behaviour, the other side has not done anything to pit him. He just not satisfied with Chen Jin's looks and Chen Jin's words are not pleasant to listen to, so his tempers somewhat rises. Now that he a little bit sober, realised that his words were incorrect, he apologized to Chen Jin using the monitor's statement: \u201cChen Jin, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind just now. You don't have to worry since whatever I said was nonsense.\u201d\u201cThe monitor may not be quite right. Everyone says the truth when they are drunk. I think w.a.n.g Yang is the same,\u201d Chen Jin's face was condensate and he watched the muddy-look of the cla.s.s monitor and w.a.n.g Yang. These people were always like this on the surface and hide their real appearance behind. If they were the same as the rich second generation like Zhao He in their cla.s.s, they would have been another face long ago, \u201cI would also like to ask w.a.n.g Yang what do those words mean. Better explain the meaning of those words, there's nothing to be concealed.\u201dOriginally, after w.a.n.g Yang apologized for this, it was just to soothes their relationship or trouble in front of everyone else. Even if there was something they don't satisfied with, they could deal with it privately. But since Chen Jin said these words openly, the cla.s.s leader and w.a.n.g Yang face feel so heavy that they can't lift it up. Other cla.s.smates couldn't enjoy any more, all the sudden, they feel not fun anymore.Seeing that the cla.s.s monitor and w.a.n.g Yang were silent, Chen Jin stood up with a mocking smile on his face, \u201cWell, since I'm not welcomed here, and I don't affect your mood, I'll leave first.\u201dThe whole cla.s.s watched Chen Jin leave. After a moment's silence, the rich second generation, Zhao He said: \u201cf.u.c.k, Chen Jin is brainsick. Just don't drink that motherf.u.c.king wine, why need to stir up trouble?\u201dLu Chengyu remembered that in his past life's graduation party, it seemed that w.a.n.g Yang and Chen Jin had some disagreements, but the scene was not as uncomfortable as it is now. Later, when he attended a cla.s.s reunion, some people talk to Chen Jin, but w.a.n.g Yang, Zhao He and others seemed reluctant to talk to him from beginning to end, and Chen Jin did not seem to like these people either.After dinner, they went to KTV set up by Zhao He's family to sing together. Zhao He's parents also left them a luxurious private room. All student from their cla.s.s screaming and howling until midnight before they were picked up by their relatives or friends.Zhao He wants to arrange a driver to take the drunk Lu Chengyu to the hotel for a night's rest. As a result, he found that Lu Chengyu's mobile phone rang and he answered the phone. After that, he realizes that the other party was Lu Chengyu's boss.When he heard that the other party was coming to fetch Lu Chengyu, he told him the KTV's address. As soon as he finished speaking, the mobile phone shut down automatically because it had no battery. He looks at the black screen on the mobile phone and looks at Lu Chengyu sleeping on the sofa, Zhao He shook his half-drunk head. It's a pity that such a competent, handsome man, doesn't have parents and apathetic relatives. Fortunately, he met with a humane boss, although\u2026.his boss' tone sounds quite cold.Next][1] \u5916\u5f3a\u4e2d\u5e72 [w\u00e0i qi\u00e1ng zh\u014dng g\u0101n]: strong in appearance but weak in reality (idiom)[2] \u65e0\u7406\u53d6\u95f9 [w\u00fa l\u01d0 q\u01d4 n\u00e0o]: be deliberately provocative; find fault with no reason whatsoever;[3]\u89c1\u5229\u5fd8\u4e49 [ji\u00e0n l\u00ec w\u00e0ng y\u00ec]: forget honour at the prospect of profits; to sell one's soul for gain[4] \u94bb\u77f3\u738b\u8001\u4e94 [zu\u00e0n sh\u00ed w\u00e1ng l\u01ceo w\u01d4]: highly eligible bachelor; desirable male partner[5] \u5973\u6c49\u7eb8 [n\u01da h\u00e0n zh\u01d0]: a girl or a woman who is strong or independent, she can deal with various problems just like a man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(Since I haven't found a way to link it to below), So this chapter, I made some changes, comment below and tell me which one you prefer (\u00b4\u03b5\uff40 )\u2661Chapter 11: Opportunities Falling from the SkyZhao He didn't wait long in the karaoke box [1]. He saw a waiter coming in with a man wearing a shirt with his suit coat on his arm, Zhao He rubs his unsober head, \u201cAre you Lu Chengyu's boss?\u201d while looking up and down at the man. Although he can't see the clothes and shoes' brand, he can still see that it is not cheap.Yan Mu went to the sofa and squatted down. He looks at Lu Chengyu, who's drunk and had fallen asleep. He shook Chengyu's shoulder, but after he saw that Lu Chengyu did not respond, he knew Chengyu was dead drunk. Then, Yan Mu said to Zhao He, \u201cThank you for taking care of him.\u201d After saying it, he asked for the waiter's help to hold Lu Chengyu and he lay him on his back. Then Yan Mu walked steadily to go outside the door.As Zhao He watched Yan Mu carried the man out of the karaoke box, he was stunned for a moment. Then he realized that Yan Mu forgot his suit coat that he put on the sofa, he runs after Yan Mu to outside. When he arrived at the parking place outside KTV, he saw Yan Mu placing Lu Chengyu into a Maybach. At the moment, he sighed, \u201cf.u.c.k me, it's a limited car!\u201dHis family is rich. However, in this capital city, rich families are like clouds. (T/N: there are many rich families) Even if Lao Tzu is quite rich, Lao Tzu can't afford to buy that kind of car, and even if Lao Tzu can, Lao Tzu won't spend money on it. (T/N: Zhao He called himself Lao Tzu @ ore-sama). He takes advantages to see this car closely. He saw that Yan Mu place Chengyu at the front pa.s.senger seat and fastened Chengyu's seat belt well. After that, he handed back Yan Mu's coat to him and hesitated for a moment before he said: \u201cHe has no one in his family and today everyone drank a lot, please take care of him.\u201d\u201cI know. Thank you for reminding me.\u201d Yan Mu covered Lu Chengyu with his suit coat, turned on the air conditioner inside the car, nodded to Zhao He, and then he started the car and drove away.Yan Mu's steadily drive the car. So when he had reach downstairs of Lu Chengyu's building, Lu Chengyu still slept soundly, he even didn't change his posture.Yan Mu unfastening the seat belt, he looked at the building in front of him and lifted Lu Chengyu out of the car. His expression changed slightly. Although Lu Chengyu doesn't seem fat, after he loses consciousness, Yan Mu have to struggle to lift him(LCY) up.Lu Chengyu felt his head dizzy as if he had lost control of it. After several painful flips, he sat up with a quilt in his arms and looked around, only to find out that it was his room. He has no idea how did he reach home. He drank too much last night. He forgot that he had just graduated from university and didn't have the drinking capacity that he has 8 years later. Time really change people, not only it can make you grow older, but it also can also make you get more adapted to the society.When he heard the noise outside, he was stunned. He jumped down from the bed and he goes out of the room. What he saw is a frightening scene in front of him, his company's big boss walked towards him with fried eggs and milk on his hand. He was stunned for several seconds before he said: \u201cBoss?\u201d\u201cI called you last night, your cla.s.smates told me that you were drunk.\u201d Yan Mu saw him wake up, he turned to put the breakfast on the dining table, and then went back to the kitchen to bring out his breakfast. When he sees Lu Chengyu still standing at the door, he asks: \u201cIs your stomach uncomfortable? You don't want to eat?\u201d\u201cNo, I'm okay\u201d Lu Chengyu went back to the bathroom and quickly wash his face and brush his teeth. Then he sat down at the dining table and began to eat Yan Mu's fried eggs. He has to admit that this fried egg is much better cooked than what he can do. He drank a mouthful of milk and thanked him, \u201cThank you.\u201dThe relationship between them is Lu Chengyu is the employee while Yan Mu is the boss. Generally, only employees have to please the boss, and not the boss takes care of the employees. If an employee encounters the opposite situation, it can only be said that the employee has had bad luck.Yan Mu came to pick him up because his cla.s.smates told him that he(LCY) was drunk. He also took care of him overnight. What kind of spirit is this? This is a combination of revolutionary friendship and Lei Feng's spirit [2].\u662f\u96f7\u950b\u822c\u7684\u7cbe\u795e [the spirit of Lei Feng]: named after Lei Feng, a model of altruism and dedication for the Communist Party\u201cSmall things, no need thanks. I used your room last night without your consent. I'm sorry.\u201d Yan Mu's eating posture is very standard, which is somewhat like a ruler. Lu Chengyu even found that he ate almost the same amount of food every time.Hearing the other side's words, Lu Chengyu eagerly said: \u201cBoss, you take care of me for one night, and you even have to prepare your own room. It was me who should say sorry.\u201d This time his sorry is absolutely sincere. Just like when he say thanks just now, he really meant it.Then, after Lu Chengyu said it, he drinks the half cup milk while Yan Mu starts speaking, \u201cIf you are sober enough to prepare your own room, I won't have to take care of you.\u201dThese sentences, similar to spitting, are said from the mouth of this expressionless man, simply have a brute effect. Lu Chengyu almost choked on the milk, and he smiled dryly: \u201cNext time, I'll make sure to drink less wine.\u201d \"\u201cHmm.\u201d Yan Mu nodded in agreement. \u201cDrinking hurts the liver. It's not good.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded his head under his opponent's serious eyes and said, \u201cI'll keep that in mind.\u201dThen he saw the other side's eyes showing a meaning of \u201cyou are still saved\u201d, so he had to silently bow his head and continue to struggle with the fried eggs.When Lu Chengyu finished eating, Yan Mu insisted to clean the dishes and then left Lu Chengyu's home wearing yesterday's clothes. Before leaving, he reminds Lu Chengyu to have lunch on time instead of going to work today.While Lu Chengyu watched the other side enter the elevator, he touches his chin and began to think. It seems like no matter what kind of group, for example, the rich second generation group, there are people with distinctive behaviour in it.At the moment when the elevator's door was about to close, Lu Chengyu heard another solemn voice coming from the elevator.\u201cRemember to work on time tomorrow.\u201dHowever, the people who called \u201cboss\u201d is the same everywhere.Lu Chengyu goes back to the house to take a bath and changed his clothes. Afterwards, he sat on a sofa in the living room, he found fresh fruits on a fruit tray under the tea table. Needless to say, Yan Mu went out to buy it this morning.He couldn't help laughing looking at the fruits.In the afternoon, Lu Chengyu went out and looks for a ca.s.serole dish series' shop for lunch. He only ordered two light dishes. If he drinks too much, his will have an upset stomach and he can't eat anything else.The ca.s.serole pigeon soup [3] tastes very good and stimulates Lu Chengyu's appet.i.te.When he starts to eat it, he hears the people at the next table spitting bitter water [4]. He turned his head around and saw two men in their thirties sitting face to face. Both of them has bitter faces and messy hair. They looked somewhat in a difficult position.\u5410\u82e6\u6c34 [t\u01d4 k\u01d4 shu\u01d0 ] to complain bitterly; to pour out one's sufferingsn.o.body knows these two people now, but Lu Chengyu knows them very well because they are Zhang Shuo, a very famous director and Qu Lingbei, a famous screenwriter. It is rumoured that they are good brothers for many years. In their early years, they became famous for shooting a movie that had a million-yuan investment but a box office of 900 million yuan. That small-budget movie had made several artists popular and eventually became the main door for both Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei to enter the entertainment circle.They worked together to make several good and popular movies. In the year when Lu Chengyu died in his past life, they were already the wrists in the entertainment circle. (T/N: already have a firm foothold in the entertainment world). He didn't know that when both of this man hasn't got into the entertainment circle, they look like this.\u201cWhy don't we just forget it,\u201d said Qu Lingbei, he lifts his face up and takes a sip of wine, \u201cWe have been running around for months, who will join us.\u201d\u201cIf Lao Tzu had one or two million, Lao Tzu would never need to ask for money from those grandchildren.\u201d Zhang Shuo wiped his face. \u201cWe've wasted so much energy. If you quit, then the previous efforts are not in vain?\u201d\u201cOf course it will be in vain,\u201d Qu Lingbei said while forcing a bitter smile, \u201cA few days ago, my relatives got me a job. The salary was very good. I want to try it.\u201d His children are going to primary school soon. Although his wife always supports him, he can't let his wife and children suffer because of his dream. What kind of man is that?Zhang Shuo keeps silent. He knew his friend's difficulty. The other side is not like him as he ate alone. His friend had a wife and children in his family. It's impossible to go on like this all the time.\u201cAre you going to make a movie?\u201d Lu Chengyu's face didn't show even half ashamed for eavesdropping on other people's conversation. He looked like a curious young man and asked, \u201cWhat movie is it?\u201dZhang Shuo looks at the young man from the neighbouring table. He knows that their conversation was overheard by the other party. He replied in a somewhat upset tone, \u201cWe don't have money now. What kind of movies can we make?\u201d\u201cIt's going to cost a lot of money? \u201cLu Chengyu remembers in an interview with a TV station later, Qu Lingbei once told this experience. Just in time that both of them decided to give up, a big supermarket's owner was very interested in their script, and finally invested 2 million, which allows them to successfully shoot the film. Who knows that the movie will be a hit, leading them towards their peak of life, also made the supermarket owner rich.\u201cThat's right. Even we are shooting a small-budget movie, it still gonna cost around 2 to 3 million.\u201d Zhang Shuo looks at Lu Chengyu's exquisite appearance, he was curious and thinks that this young man wants to be an actor, \u201cYoung man, it's not easy to enter the entertainment circle.\u201d\u201cI don't want to enter the entertainment circle, but I like movies. If it's only two or three million yuan, I can give you money to shoot the movie.\u201d Lu Chengyu saw that the other party doesn't believe it, \u201cor we'll find a place to talk about the details.\u201d He doesn't have much cash in hand now, but he can still afford two or three million yuan.Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei didn't hold any hope, but now since they have nowhere to go, better they listen to this young man's words. Anyway, they won't lose anything if they listen to it.However, when they sit down in the teahouse, really get the details settled and get the lawyer to sign the contract, the two people reacted. They have been running around so many days without any result, but unexpectedly met a n.o.bleman in a restaurant?That afternoon, the first instalment money was deposit in both man' accounts. Zhang Shuo looked at the balance in his bank card, his smiling chubby face looks a bit distorted.This is literally a sum of money that fell from the sky, smashing them, making them dizzy.Lu Chengyu was also in a good mood. For him, this was an opportunity that falls from the sky. He read the script in the afternoon and the two men are ready to shoot \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b. Several years later, this movie remains an excellent example of a small-budget movie with high-profit returns. Even many movie investors are envy and jealous of the supermarket owner. What kind of s.h.i.t luck can they find this money?But Lu Chengyu knew very well that the supermarket owner didn't really have much money. Even when he signed the cooperation letter with Zhang Shuo, he didn't have enough money to invest in movies. But this man went to Huading and made a small fortune in real estate. Only then he had enough funds to invest in \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b.The man's name was Huangchuan, and later he became a famous investor in film and television circles. At the same time, he also was the b.a.s.t.a.r.d who wants to do unwritten rules with Lu Chengyu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I accidentally read the names wrong in Chapter 8, I have changed it, I'm sorry~~And the school has started, so expect late release as I am incompetent to juggle my life with studies, homework, translating etc, but I'll try my best to bring at least one chapter per week. (\u2022\u0300\u1d17\u2022\u0301)\u0648 \u0311\u0311\u00a0 \u00a0 BTW next chapter is super long..[Next]Chapter 12: What's wrong? (Insect Catcher)The next day, Lu Chengyu returned to work in the company and saw Yan Mu's att.i.tude towards him is the same as usual, he knows that Yan Mu has precisely this kind of temper, so he maintains his calm manner when he was working. However, he put a lot of effort to make a plan book for Huading.Cao Jingshen knew Lu Chengyu was a capable man, but he didn't expect that the other party would make such a wonderful plan book. He seems quite excited looking at the doc.u.ments on his hands. While pushing his gla.s.ses on the bridge of his nose, Cao Jingshen asked, \u201cHow long have you been working on this plan book?\u201d\u201cBefore entering Huading, I had this idea. \u25a1\u25a1's development speed is very fast. Now there are many local media reports about air quality and water pollution. Maybe in the near future, people will pay more attention to this problem. At that time, we Huading has been at the forefront and become a leader in similar products.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled. He was too young in his past life, oblivious to certain things. When he went to Liang's interview, he boldly put forward this idea. Later, he failed in the interview, but someone in Liang Company stole his idea to make a plan that made Liang Company earned a lot of money. Now, in this life, he has honed this idea as early as possible, so he can make it into a plan book, and it is more detailed and close to life compared to Liang Company \u2018s plan.By next year, the country will vigorously mention the concept of PM2.5. Severe haze weather often occurs in the next few years, and then many people who do not have access to this knowledge will be alarmed. It turned out that they all lived in such a bad environment, and then everyone gets anxious about their health problems.If there is demand, there will be a market. As long as one's takes the lead in this market, he or she will be the victory.Cao Jingshen closed the plan book, \u201cThere are already such products in China, but the market is very pessimistic, so many of these companies have shifted their investment into other industries.\u201d\u201cTherefore, we must seize this opportunity. Our Huading reputation is there. As long as we develop good quality and useful products, we will welcome the spring of this market.\u201d Lu Chengyu's tone is calm, not like a young man who tries hard to prove his achievements, rather his tone is to make other people think that what he said is very reasonable. \u201cIn the past year or two, the media have frequently mentioned about environmental issues. I think this is a signal.\u201d He's willing to take this plan out now not only because he wants to be the top executive of Huading, but also because he has already believed in Cao Jingshen and Yan Mu's personality through observation during this period.Learn from one's mistakes, this is \u25a1\u25a1 old saying, but it was also our forefather's wisdom.Cao Jingshen is given an important position by Yan Mu is because he has vision, courage and meticulousness, which is why he was so excited when he saw the plan book. After listening to Lu Chengyu's remarks, he found that although Lu Chengyu was only a recent graduate in his early twenties, he had good observation, calmness and vision. If such a person can't shine brilliantly in the future, it just means that G.o.d doesn't have eyes.\u201cI'll give the plan book to the boss.\u201d After Cao Jingshen said this, he looked at Lu Chengyu and found that he was calm, still standing in a good-looking demeanour, and could not see any expectations or worries. He can't help sighing, no wonder there are more and more female clerks in the Secretarial Department recently, his elegant appearance is the reason ah.Since Cao Jingshen have already said that, Lu Chengyu will not continue to pester about this issue or give a meaningful glance to him. Whether or not Yan Mu give attention to this plan depends on its' usefulness, rather than him explaining it over and over again so that he can get an approval.There are taboos in the workplace; pestering endless or give a meaningful glance to someone.In an idol drama, the plot goes with the heroine explains again and again and then impress the big boss. That's the golden finger given to the heroine by the scriptwriter. But in reality, the biggest possibility to happen to you if you do that is you will be fired.Of course, there may also be an unforeseen incident where the big boss was impressed and use your idea, but the reason why an unforeseen incident is called unforeseen incident is that the probability of an ordinary person to encounter this fate is too small. His past life's experience tells him that unforeseen incident related to him has nothing to do with good things.So, that afternoon, Lu Chengyu take advantage during office hours to log in to Weibo, he found a hot topic called \u2018Q University's Gra.s.s HD Photo'. When he opened the topic, his face suddenly froze.Isn't the man who in his bachelor's robe, with his degree in hand, sitting near the tree trunk is him? He looked at the nine pictures on the Weibo. There are pictures during his speech on stage, pictures of him holding his diploma, and the pictures of him laughing at others on the gra.s.s.Then he quietly opens his own Weibo's page, which is \u201cMore Than One Year\u201d. Sure enough, the number of fans has soared by tens of thousands and the comments section are bustling with excitement. Even there are some people were saying that the top scholar is cute and so on.He pauses his hand that holds the mouse and then with a malicious smile on his face, he sends a post on Weibo.\u201cMore Than One Year: Have you finished your homework? Have you pa.s.sed the exam? None of these is accomplished, yet scrolling on Weibo.\u201dSoon, his post's comment section is full with the sound of grief and anguished wailing.\u201cLots and lots reply @ More Than One Year: I can feel the world's malice from the top scholar.\u201d\u201cStop More Gift reply @ More Than One Year: Thinking about this semester's Advanced Mathematics' failing grade, suddenly I feel my knee are somewhat in pain.\u201dThere are many malicious things in the world. Lu Chengyu smiled and closed his Weibo, instantly, he feels a little bit better.For him, even if he is popular in Weibo for a while, it doesn't matter because humans are forgetful. When something new appears, anything in front of you will soon be forgotten.This is because, for many people, the Internet is a part of oneself mask. All they want is a simple relaxation and happiness. They don't have to face many complicated things like reality. So they simply appreciate the jokes on the internet, beautiful women, handsome men and star gossip. Afterwards, they pick up their spirits and continue facing the reality.So, he doesn't think of how much this is going to affect him. Anyway, these people are going to forget about it in a few days.\u201cXiao Lu, what are you doing?\u201d Tang Xuan went to Lu Chengyu and handed him a pack of snacks, \u201cYour probation period is coming soon. Did Chief Cao say how to arrange you?\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d After unpacking the snack package, Lu Chengyu put a piece in his mouth, and then put it aside. Beautiful woman's kindness shouldn't be rejected, this is how elegant man conduct. However, a man's preference for snacks is not conducive to his image. Exactly one piece is enough.Just, this snack is delicious, maybe after work, he can go to buy some and bring it back home.\u201cI don't know yet, n.o.body told me,\u201d Lu Chengyu wiped his hand and says \u201cThe chief didn't tell me anything about it, but if I were a.s.signed to a branch office, then I can't see Sister Xuan, the most beautiful woman.\u201d\u201cBranch?\u201d Tang Xuan smiled and said, \u201cDon't worry, I will see you very often in the future.\u201d On the surface, although she didn't say anything specific, she seems to know something. Actually, she heard from Manager Luo about the Personnel Department's arrangement to Lu Chengyu. She told her that the top management attaches great importance of this small intern, Lu Chengyu's ability, which would definitely allow him to remain in the Headquarters.Only then did Lu Chengyu understand Tang Xuan's intentions. She was here to sell herself well since afterwards, they were bound to see each other more often in the future. The relationship between colleagues also affects the quality and progress of work. (T/N: she already guess that Chengyu gonna stays in Huading, that's why she retaining a good relationship with him, they are going to be co-workers later anyway.)\u201cIf I can stay at the headquarters after my probation period, I'll invite everyone for a meal to celebrate,\u201d said Lu Chengyu with a smile, \u201cBut if I can't stay here, then Sister Xuan'll invite us for a meal.\u201dImmediately several people in the same department cheering for this. Regardless who wins, someone will pay for their meal today.Suddenly, a few cheering people quiet down at the same time. Lu Chengyu was puzzled and he turned back to see Cao Jingshen and Yan BOSS are standing at the hallway. Yan BOSS hung up one of his signature-face-series, which is the expressionless face. From his expression, Lu Chengyu unable to tell whether or not he had heard their discussion just now.Tang Xuan quietly go back to her work desk. How can the boss be here at this time?\u201cLu Chengyu, come to my office,\u201d says Cao Jingshen while nodded to Lu Chengyu and did not blame others for slacking at work. He went straight to his office with Yan BOSS.Under the sympathetic eyes of his colleagues, Lu Chengyu walked into the office and saw Yan Mu is holding the plan book he had made.\u201cYour idea is very good. I have decided to let Huading enter this industry,\u201d Yan Mu said. \u201cThis plan is very detailed, there is no problem to directly carry out the idea according to it .\u201d He paused for a while and speak again, \u201cDo you know the value of this plan?\u201d Unlike Cao Jingshen, he is not only a businessman but also an insider of the revolutionary circle of Beijing. Therefore, he knows the above policy earlier than anyone else. In recent years, attention has been paid to air quality problem and it will be put forward as the most important thing. So there will certainly be a broad market for products in this area.He knew the news above, so he understood the value of the plan. However, for Lu Chengyu to have this kind of observation power is an amazing feat.Therefore, for such talents, as bosses, they will attach great value to him. It is just human nature.Yan Mu took out a contract and put it on the table. \u201cIf you have no objection, sign it.\u201dLu Chengyu takes the contract and reads it. Soon enough, he was somewhat surprised and look onto Yan Mu's eyes. He thought Yan Mu would give him a big bonus because of this plan. What he didn't expect was that the other side promised to split up his profit by 2% as long as Huading produced the related products in the future.2% doesn't sound like much, but Lu Chengyu knows that as long as Huading occupies the market, financial gain will surely roll in the company in the future. That 2% profit is a big profit, which has exceeded Lu Chengyu's expectation.As a boss, is it really okay to be so generous?Is it okay not matched at all with the capitalists' style of exploiting the working cla.s.s?\u201cI want you to stay,\u201d Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu. \u201cYou are very talented, which for Huading, your value has greatly exceeded the 2% profit.\u201d\u201cSince boss has said that much, how can I be fussy?\u201d Lu Chengyu took a pen and sign his name on the below section in the contract, \u201cas the saying goes, thousand-mile horses are common, but Bole is not [1]. Since the boss has trusted me, I will try not to let you down.\u201d[1] the person with talent is rare, but the person who is able to recognize the talent is even rarer and valuable than the talented person.Yan Mu looks at the three big characters of the signature like dragons flying and phoenixes dancing\u00a0[2] on the contract, then he said with a solemn face, \u201cI believe in you, you won't let me down.\u201d[2]\u9f99\u98de\u51e4\u821e\u00a0[l\u00f3ng f\u0113i f\u00e8ng w\u01d4]:\u00a0lively and vigorous flourishes in calligraphy; \u00a0beautiful penmanship; \u00a0\u00a0elegant handwriting; \u00a0exquisite calligraphy; something like below \u21d3Lu Chengyu just smiled and didn't say anything.Cao Jingshen who sat on one side, silently pushed his gla.s.ses quite a few times. He always felt as if something was wrong. Was it his illusion?Cao Jinchen sat on one side, silently pushed several gla.s.ses. He always felt as if something was wrong, was he delusional?

    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySo\u2026..s**t happens!It was during a raining night that I realized that s**t happens since last year. Here's the story. As I was scrolling on the net, suddenly I have the urge to search \u201cmore than a few blessing\u201d using google. Guess what? Yes, there was another website posting my translation and claim that you can read it for free, high quality, blablabla.. Dude! What the heck? My blog is much more better than you, much more freer than you (yes, I shouldn't be using \u2018much more' in one sentence, I couldn't care less by now.)Chapter 13: PromotionSince Yan Mu has given his consent to the plan book, in Huading, no one dares to oppose Yan Mu's opinion. Therefore everyone is getting ready and hold production's meeting for this product. Although some people worry that such new products will not easily sell in the market, the last proposal was approved in the meeting.Afterwards, they found that one of the people in charge of the product development was a freshly graduated college student, some people objected for that person to be the person in charge. However, after hearing a speech by that young man, their objection gradually disappeared, and even faintly feel that this young man have the courage and starts to think that in the not-so-far future, this younger generation will surpa.s.s them.Lu Chengyu had long antic.i.p.ated that there would be objections, so he was well prepared with his speech. After he gave the speech and the meeting ends, he shut down his laptop and went out of the meeting room with the shareholders. The shareholder was ecstatically praised him along the way. Hearing all these praises, Lu Chengyu maintained his humble and modest appearance in front of everyone that makes a lot of people have a favourable impression towards him.Cao Jingshen noticed that Lu Chengyu's laptop today is not the one provided by the company, but the one he has not seen. From the outer look of that laptop, it should be the one that Lu Chengyu often used before he comes to Huading. It seems that Lu Chengyu had antic.i.p.ated that there would be objections and had already thought about the content of his speech, which is the reason his speech today is wonderful and perfect.Fortunately, this kind of person is from my own company. It will be a real headache if he is from a rivals' company.Back at his desk, Lu Chengyu took a teacup and brewed a cup of tea in the tea room. After a few sips, he took a slow breath and took out the data sheet he had brought from the Sales Department this morning. He looks at the data, one by one, and notices that orders' quant.i.ty of Huading's various products has gradually improved recently and even a lot of big orders can be seen. This shows that Huading's market has gradually stabilized. But who thought that Huading is getting dumber and dumber that no one will expect because you guys are reading at\u00a0aggregator site.He looks at the stock price of Huading in the stock market on his laptop. The stock price has been popular all the way before, now it has gradually become calm, There's not much risk in selling and buying. (T/N: remember the time where Huading's share was so bad that it has been selling like hotcakes? that's what it means by \u201cpopular before\u201d.) Although the stock price has risen a lot and Lu Chengyu would make a lot of money if he sold his shares, he had no intention of selling them.When \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b finished airing in theatre chain, he will have enough cash in hand, and then he will continue to buy some Huading shares. After he holds more than 5% of the shares, he will become one of Huading's major shareholders and have the decision-making power of Huading. Soaring birds just dead by now. Its because Yan Mu said I dont like you readers read at aggregator siteHe picks up the teacup with fragrant tea inside it and drank the tea. He knows he's an ambitious man, therefore he's not going to hide his ambition.Lu Chengyu closed the share market's website and continue to read the sales data on his hand.\u300aSoaring Birds\u300bfilm's shooting only took two to three months to complete and now, he is thinking about the theatre chain' problem. In his past life, Lu Chengyu has been in the entertainment circle. He knew the fact of how many films are made in every year but there aren't many films actually aired on the big screen due to audit and theatre chain's problem.\u300aSoaring Birds\u300b doesn't have p.o.r.nographic, violence or any anti-social content, hence it won't have problems during auditing. As for the theatre chain\u2026Lu Chengyu touches his chin and he wondered if Yan Mu had any way of solving this problem. More importantly, would Yan Mu help him? He won't since Jingshen love him, Yan Mu is just for him~ the end. no more Yan mu x Chengyu, dream on guys.During July, the hot season, Lu Chengyu's internship started. All staff in Huading Headquarters know that there is a very excellent intern, not only he has an outstanding in ability and appearance, but also he is responsible for the development of a new product Huading. But everyone plans to kill Chengyu tomorrow, so they kill him today.No one knows about the new product, but many people hear that the boss was amazed after he read the intern's plan book. He signed a contract with the other party and even gave 2% of the profits to him.Hence, as soon as the internship period starts, everyone was very curious about the legendary intern's new position, don't know which department he will land on?In the president's office, Lu Chengyu looked at the work contract in hand but did not sign his name. Cao Jingshen looked at him several times.(T/N: the contract LCY sign in the previous chapter is about the product, profit, etc, this contract here is for his work like position, salary, holidays, staff benefit etc)Yan Mu looks much calmer than Cao Jingshen. He flips through the doc.u.ments as usual, but we can see that he reads the doc.u.ments faster than usual.After a long time, Cao Jingshen finally couldn't resist and says, \u201cAre you dissatisfied with the contract?\u201d Yes I am, I want all Huading share's dude, and stop preying my seme.\u201cNo, the terms of this contract are very generous. For fresh graduates, such a high annual salary is far beyond the average level.\u201d Yan Mu gives him a salary that equals to someone with six to seven years of working experience and carefully lists the insurance and welfare provisions, showing sincerity beyond common sense.\u201cIn that case, you\u2026.\u201d Cao Jing Shen saw Yan Mu is frowning, so he didn't speak the rest of the word but he looked at Lu Chengyu holding the pen in his hand, worried that Chengyu would not sign the contract.Yan Mu looked up at Lu Chengyu and said earnestly, \u201cHuading will give you enough room for development. I believe you will also bring development to Huading.\u201dThis is equivalent to a promise that later on in Huading, Lu Chengyu will be reused. After listening to these words, he smiled, \u201cI am ambitious, therefore I believe Huading will realize my ambition.\u201d He opened the lid of the pen and signed his name on the contract.\u201cWelcome to join us formally in Huading.\u201d Yan Mu stood up and extended his hand to Lu Chengyu. Chengyu brings out a gun and start shooting everyone, here. They all die.\u201cThank you for the opportunity boss gave me,\u201d Lu Chengyu grasp Yan Mu's hand.A few seconds later, they both let go of each other's hands at the same time. Yan Mu made a seat-invitation gesture to Lu Chengyu and then they sat down, \u201cUsually, new peoples will be placed in other departments of the company but your ability and vision are enough to prove that you do not need to go to the following departments to hone yourself and I'm lacking an a.s.sistant now. After a period of time, I'm going to appoint you as manager.\u201dCao Jingshen glances at Yan Mu in surprise, his decision to let Chengyu be a manager in headquarters is too frightening. By letting Lu Chengyu become a.s.sistant to the president, he's afraid that it is only a springboard for him to serve as a manager in the future. Although he knew Lu Chengyu was really capable, he had to say that his boss's decision still surprised him. After all, the promotion of this position has gone beyond the industry's default rules.Preparing a newly graduated young man to be the general manager of such a large listed company, this kind of matter not only can be written in financial newspapers, but I'm afraid it can even be included in entertainment newspapers.\u201cThe boss is working overtime. Of course, as an a.s.sistant, I can't get off work on time,\u201d answered Lu Chengyu, \u201cI don't mind working overtime, but is it possible to get an extra meal during overtime?\u201dDoes that mean Lu Chengyu accept the boss arrangement for his position?\u00a0Cao Jingshen feels that his whole person is a bit bad. The boss is bold enough to employ the new people and the new people are also bold enough to accept them. Should he say that both of them are very confident, or should he say that he is too fussy?As Cao Jingshen thinks of this, he could not help but push his gla.s.ses. Although the boss is somewhat rigorous and monotonous, he is a man of vision and courage. When Yan Mu recruited managers and when Jingshen joined the company, Yan Mu didn't care about anything but their abilities. Maybe for the boss, other people' opinions are not important at all. What matters is whether the person is worth it or not.Asilong as Lu Chengyu has this value, it doesn't matter what school he graduated from and how many years he worked.Anyway, it's a good thing for employees to meet such a boss. In this circle, there are more bosses who are jealous of a capable and virtuous personage than bosses who really value talents. No he didnt. he just love Jingshen, they are the main couple dude.After Lu Chengyu left the president's office, Cao Jingshen said, \u201cHe is very confident.\u201d\u201cSelf-confidence is better than arrogance.\u201d Yan Mu looked at the signed contract with Lu Chengyu's name and date on it. \u201cTomorrow I will send you a new a.s.sistant.\u201dCao Jingshen pushed his gla.s.ses, hesitated for a moment before he said, \u201cBoss, I learned something about Xiao Lu's family a few days ago\u2026\u201d\u00a0Yes ,Im gonna catch them all pokemonYan Mu looked at Cao Jingshen and he frowned.Cao Jingshen knew Yan Mu didn't like to talk about people's behaviour behind his back, but he bit his teeth and told the story, \u201cI read Lu Chengyu's files a few days ago and found out that his parents had accidentally died. I checked about it a little bit and discovered that his parents'death was related to Liang's Company.\u201d Cao Jingshen appreciated this young man, Lu Chengyu. Hence, he told Yan Mu about this matter, he subconsciously wanted Yan Mu to take care of Lu Chengyu a little bit more in his work. After all, Lu Chengyu will have to deal directly with him in the future.\u201cLiang Company?\u201d Huading and Liang Company are rivals in real estate. During the time when Huading was having an internal crisis, Liang Company gets a lot of advantages and convenience because of it.Yan Mu understood why Lu Chengyu's cla.s.smates said that strange thing that night when he was drunk, and why there was no trace of other people's living in his house. There were some doubts in his heart. But now, it was finally confirmed by Cao Jingshen.\u201cI see, don't publicize about this.\u201d If this kind of matter known to everyone, there might be some people who may sympathize, but inevitably, there may be some people who see this matter as their gossip's subject behind Chengyu's back.\u201cDon't worry, I won't go around talking about this kind of thing,\u201d Cao Jingshen put on his gla.s.ses and his appearance remained the same, which is a social elite. He sighed, \u201cI just think about Lu Chengyu, it wasn't easy for this kid.\u201dAfter a long silence, Yan Mu said, \u201cYou called a man who is only eight years younger than you as \u2018kid', is it taking advantage of Lu Chengyu?\u201d He looked at Cao Jingshen's face again and was silent for a moment, \u201cI was wrong, you are not taking any advantages.\u201dWhen Lu Chengyu returned to the downstairs to the Secretarial Department, many people asked him about his new position. He just waved his hand, \u201cAll senior able to foretell with miraculous accuracy, the boss told me that I'm able to stay in HQ. It's my treat tonight. Let's go out for a meal.\u201dThe whole department immediately cheering and starts to discuss the place to eat. Finally, a more upscaled buffet restaurant is chosen, they ask Lu Chengyu to eat there and they wrapped the reason in nice-sounding phrases which are \u201cas practice for him.\u201dSince the misunderstanding of buying a car was cleared up, everyone knows that Lu Chengyu is not a rich second generation. As a student who just graduated and work, they know how much money he had since they all have been there, and experience the life of a freshly graduated student. Therefore, although they sound excited, they measured Chengyu's ability to cater them and choose a proper restaurant. Not to mention that Chengyu is getting upgraded, not downgraded, they are pleased to make a good acquaintance with him.The people who want to join with this situation will join them but the people who don't know how to act tactfully or interested in anything, don't have to join them.Lu Chengyu's response with a smile. In his heart, he knew that these people give him face not only because of their knowledge and interest but also because of Yan Mu's attention towards him.If the decision of his arrangement is to be at a branch office, out from HQ, he knew that these people won't invite him to dinner. The real reason of why he wanted to invite them for dinner is he fears that these people will remember his promise and demand something that might burden him later on as a debt of grat.i.tude. (T/N: he don't want to owe anyone anything so he asked them out now, hence these people won't be able to make excuses saying that Chengyu needs to pay them \u2018the debt' and do something..)Chengyu looks at his desk that he has been staying for nearly three months. Tomorrow, he will move to the 28th floor, which represent the highest level. His journey just begins.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There might be some weird sentences structure, please don't kill me. To tell the truth, I'm not quite satisfied with this chapter but I believe it is readable and can be understood. (I had been correcting this chapter for days, hahaha, and my brain just went offline on me). I'm sorry for my incompetence. ( \u02c3\u0323\u0323\u0325\u03c9\u02c2\u0323\u0323\u0325 )Just remember, Yan Lao San = Yan Old Third = San Shu = third uncle, the guy who throws teacup before, oh yes, he has appeared~If you aren't reading this novel at shunraikitranslations, Yan Mu gonna ends up with Liang Deyou while Chengyu gonna be mine. If you want to stop this from happening, read it at shunraikitranslations okay?Chapter 14: WristIn the evening, the whole department went to dinner together, but since they had to go to work the next day, they didn't stay up late. After the dinner, all of them went to separate ways. But before they separated, everyone told Lu Chengyu that they would call him if there were any gathering in the future.Lu Chengyu smiles and agreed. He drove back and reach home before 10 p.m. After taking bath, he couldn't sleep so he lay on the sofa with his laptop. Chengyu surf the Cape Forum and he takes part in a thread. This thread's OP, who is a five-cent sockpuppet[2],\u00a0loves to say that the foreign's moon is rounder [1].\u00a0Chengyu drives the OP to the corner for a while,\u00a0\u00a0and when the other party has already burned with a frenzy of rage, Chengyu calmly closes the forum.[1] \u9a6c\u7532 m\u01ce ji\u01ce: sockpuppet (Internet slang); When a real person registers more than 1 IDs in the same forum and uses them at the same time, the commonly used or well-known ID is generally called the primary ID, and the other ID is called the sockpuppet ID.[2] There is such an allusion that when a person returns from a foreign country, he feels that foreign countries are better than his hometown.It's his usual style to throw his hand and walks away when other parties stomp in anger. Although this style makes some people in the Cape Forum mad at him, he is firm and unrepentant.As usual, he goes to search online on the latest information about Liang Deyou. Then he saw a news story about Mr Liang stepping aside to the second line and gave his only son to take over Liang Company.Liang Deyou's father, Liang Guoming is an example of an individual who starts from scratch before he becomes rich. In his early years, he was the workshop director of the state-owned enterprises. Later, he went into business in Shanghai. Fortunately, it was a good time to find gold. He earned a lot of money. Later, he began to invest in the real estate industry. He also encountered with the great opportunity of soaring houses' price. Now, he is a well-known big boss in the industry. He only has one son, Liang Deyou and for many years, there are no beautiful women from outside are able to enter his family.\u201cLiang family\u2026\u201d said Lu Chengyu while picking up the pickled chicken feet [3] on the table and slowly chew it. He points the mouse over the photo of father and son. From the top to bottom of Liang Guoming's body, he can be seen as nouveau riche. No matter how expensive his clothes are, one can see his origin from a glance. On the other hand, Liang Deyou looks like a rich family. After chewing the pickled chicken feet, Lu Chengyu looks painfully at the chicken's bone on his hand and then look at the trash can that's a few meters away from him. Then he gets an idea. He took two paper towels and placed them on the coffee table. Next, he tossed the bones on the towels and decided to throw them into the trash can after he had eaten the pickled chicken feet. His sitting posture on the sofa now is comfortable and he too lazy to move.[3]Since there is no other news on Liang, Lu Chengyu hacked Huangchuan's computer through the network to find out what he plans to do. He\u00a0discovers that Huangchuan is planning to invest money into a film in the near future but he still lacks some funds.Although there are a lot have changed in his life now, there are several things which are the same as his past life. For example, Liang Deyou begins to learn how to manage Liang Company and Huangchuan still planning to invest in films, but the most profitable film, \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b is in his hand.After clearing all his tracks on Huangchuan's computer, Lu Chengyu opens a new pack of pickled chicken feet and continue to chew. Then he starts to watch a live men's football match online. When he saw the team has lost the game, he shook his head with a sigh. Maybe, no matter in this life or past life, the only thing that's guaranteed to remain unchanged is the \u25a1\u25a1 men's football.After he closes webpage of the live football game, Lu Chengyu looked at his watch, it was almost eleven o'clock. He chews the pickled chicken feet on his hand, put the bones on the paper towels, roll them and threw it into the trash can. As for not to eat after you brush your teeth before going to bed, he had forgotten all about it.Waking up early every day is a painful ordeal for Lu Chengyu. He changed his clothes and looked blankly at several dirty clothes in the room. Then, he walks calmly to the bathroom to wash his face. As usual, Chengyu drives to breakfast shop before he went to the company, he arrives at Huading exactly 15 minutes early before his work time.When he arrived at the Secretarial Department to pack up his things, he saw that Cao Jingshen had arrived. After he greets Jingshen, Chengyu went to the elevator while holding a box. When he pressed the elevator b.u.t.ton to go to the 28th floor, he suddenly remembered that before this, Yan Mu seemed to have an a.s.sistant beside him, but this a.s.sistant disappeared shortly after he arrived at the company.It seems that there may be some problems with the former a.s.sistant's status. I wonder if it's a business spy or someone else from Yan's family.On the 28th floor, he found a room with an a.s.sistant room's sign above it, just right beside the president's office. When he opened the door, he can see that this room was clean. There was a pot of Narcissus [4] on his desk, two pots of magnificent flowers on his balcony and some company information' files on the bookshelf near the wall.[4]This flower is poisoning to people, as for why it places in his room is a mystery.After settling his things in the room, he sat down on his chair. The chair's backrest and headrest were very comfortable and it was good to lean on when he was tired.He looks at the new set of computers on the computer desk and the internal telephone, it seems that the office is carefully arranged. He doesn't know if it was Yan Mu's deliberate instructions or it was the Logistics Department's staff who give him face, or perhaps it was both?The door of the office was knocked several times. He looked up and saw Yan Mu standing at the door.\u201cBoss?\u201d He got up from his chair and said, \u201cHow can I help you? Is there any works?\u201d\u201cAre you satisfied with the office?\u201d Yan Mu handed him a folder and looked around the office surroundings. \u201cThis is the personnel details of the company's various departments. You should know more about it. Later, when I'm busy, I'll leave it to you to coordinate the work of all departments.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded his head and took over the folder. From certain points of view, the president's a.s.sistant is more important than the president's secretary. If people in this position don't have the ability and flexible enough, they really can't do it.Yan Mu's decision to let Lu Chengyu be an a.s.sistant has also been carefully considered. He has observed Lu Chengyu's style of conduct, as well as his manner of etiquette, and he is very satisfied with him. Perhaps there's nothing wrong with Chengyu except that he's younger. Most importantly, this person knows what to say on any occasion and how to deal with people, which is a more important aspect than anything for an a.s.sistant.In this industry, there's are such thing as an a.s.sistant losing his business because he does look offensive. Sometimes, it's more prudent to choose an a.s.sistant than a secretary.\u201cThe office is very good,\u201d Lu Chengyu put the folder on his desk. \u201cI will learn the works as soon as possible.\u201dYan Mu nodded and he saw that there was nothing out of normality in Chengyu's office, he turned around and left the office. For him, the employee's working att.i.tude is very important, and Lu Chengyu's att.i.tude is very good.During noon break, Yan Mu went out of the office and prepared to go downstairs to eat. When pa.s.sing by the a.s.sistant room, he found that Lu Chengyu had gone down. He did not stop at his feet and went downstairs immediately.When he arrived at the dining hall, he saw Lu Chengyu was sitting at a table with several people, whispering something to each other while eating.\u00a0 These people are managers from several departments.Judging from the way these people talked so happily, he really can't see that Lu Chengyu was not familiar with these people before.\u201cBoss,\u201d Cao Jingshen walked up to him and glanced his eyes towards Lu Chengyu. Then he calmly said, \u201cI've already helped you to get you your meal.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Yan Mu nodded to Cao Jingshen and follow him to sit down in the corner with him. Yan Mu's meal usually consists of two meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, one soup and one fruit. He ate his meal slowly and calmly. Occasionally, when Cao Jingshen made interesting suggestions, he nodded slightly but only said a few words. The habit of speaking as limited as possible during meals has already been engraved in his bones.Please read this at shunraikitranslation.home.blog for fast and HQ translation.Lu Chengyu came down as soon as he got off work to meet one or two department managers. These department managers know that he is the newly promoted president's a.s.sistant and that both sides want to get along well with each other. So, in less than a few minutes, they begin to call each other \u2018elder brother' and \u2018younger brother'. If it's in swordsman fiction, they have already become sworn brothers.After a meal, several people had begun to discuss when they would go fishing together at the farmhouse. They have already exchanged their phone numbers and save it in their phone book. When they parted, everyone was very happy.But actually, they plan to pit Chengyu and make his life a living h.e.l.l in Huading, no oneTang Xuan saw Lu Chengyu separated from several department managers before she began waving to him. When he approached, she looked around, and with a mysterious smile, she said, \u201d Just now, I just heard news in the Logistics Department. Do you want to hear it?\u201d\u201cWhat news?\u201d Lu Chengyu sat down beside her and speak with a curious tone. \u201cDid the boss have a girlfriend, or which beautiful woman in this company is getting married?\u201d\u201cLook at you,\u201d Tang Xuan glance at him, \u201cIt's about you.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Lu Chengyu raised his eyebrows, \u201cWho in the company doesn't know about me being an a.s.sistant president?\u201d\u201cChief Cao Jingshen called the Logistic Department yesterday and asked them to set up a good office layout for your office,\u201d Tang Xuan raised her chin, \u201cEveryone knows what kind of person Chief Cao is. He'll call the Logistics Department and say it was the boss' wish. Now you know how much the boss thinks of you.\u201dWhen Lu Chengyu heard the words, he immediately laughed and joked with Tang Xuan. However, after hearing this news from Tang Xuan, Chengyu was filled with respect and grat.i.tude towards Tang Xuan, his co-worker.In the far corner, Cao Jingshen suddenly thought that if Lu Chengyu was a rich second generation and had the skill acting like this, he would've no idea how many women will be harmed.When he snapped out of it, he saw Yan Mu already finished eating. He looked at the cold meal in front of him and suddenly lost his appet.i.te.\u201cIn this afternoon, Mr Yan Lao San want to come to the company. He said he would bring a man to you,\u201d said Cao Jingshen, \u201cDo you wish to meet him?\u201d Yan Lao San hasn't appeared in the company since the unpleasant meeting three months ago. Don't know what he thinks today, all of the sudden he decided to come to the company.\u201cHe dares to come, naturally I dare to meet him,\u201d said Yan Mu lightly. However, when Jingshen talks about Yan Lao San, it can be seen that there is no trace of kindness towards relative in Yan Mu's eyes.Yan Mu really likes Yan Lao San since he has the urge to smack people using legs now.At 4:00 p.m., Lu Chengyu received a call from the front desk saying that Yan Lao San had arrived and his appointment was at 4:20 p.m. Chengyu looks at the schedule that was arranged by Cao Jingshen and saw that Jingshen really did arrange time for Yan Lao San's appointment, so he said, \u201cLet him come up.\u201dAfter he put down the phone, Chengyu went to the elevator and stood there. Within less than two minutes, he saw Yan Lao San, with a cigar in his mouth, come out from the elevator with a short, fat man and two bodyguards.Lu Chengyu's eyes swept over the peoples behind Yan Lao San and smile politely as he walks towards them and says, \u201cMr Yan Lao San, the president has been waiting for you in the office, please come with me.\u201dYan Lao San recognized him at a glance. He frowned at the moment and then he laughed, \u201cYou are a talented young man with a remarkable face. You have been already transferred to work on this floor.\u201dAnyone who hears what's Yan Lao San said just now, they are able to detect the strange tone in his voice as if he was implying that Chengyu climbs up and earn his position now with his face. This bearing can really be regarded as quite rude.\u201cMr Yan Lao San is flattering me,\u201d Lu Chengyu extended his hand and made an inviting gesture, \u201cI am young and ignorant, don't deserve your praise. You didn't mention anything else but only praising me, Mr San is forthright magnanimous, I feel inferior to you,\u201d For this kind of brainless things, Chengyu doesn't want to spend effort on him. (T/N: Chengyu doesn't want to rebuke/refute what Yan Lao San said about \u2018climbing up using face' so he takes the high road by not saying anything)The corner of Yan Lao San's mouth hooked up and he sneered and impatiently said, \u201cOkay, don't talk nonsense to Lao Tzu, take me to that young boy, Yan's office.\u201dLu Chengyu was still smiling when he heard this tone. He maintained a polite and respectful att.i.tude and did not lose his dignity from beginning to end.The slightly fat men behind Yan Lao San has taken advantages to scrutinize Lu Chengyu several times while he was talking to Yan Lao San. When he saw Lu Chengyu's graceful gesture leading them forward, his eyes drool with desire.Read this novel at shunraikitranslations, the fastest and HQ translation, trust mePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When the two black-clad bodyguards were going to follow in, he raised his hand over and stopped them, then he said with a smile, \u201cWhy don't you wait outside the door?\u201dTwo bodyguards looked at how Lu Chengyu raised his hand just now and they knew that this man was somewhat skilled. Since it wasn't proper to make a scene on other person's territory, they all look up to Yan Lao San and wait for his instruction.Yan Lao San's face was dark and gloomy, but he still instructs the two bodyguards to stay outside with his eyes. He takes off the cigar from his mouth, clip it in between his fingers and says with ridicule tone, \u201cMy worthy nephew raised a good dog.\u201d\u201cDogs have a lot of hair. I don't like them.\u201d Yan Mu slightly wrinkled his eyebrows when he saw Yan Lao San was shaking off the cigar ashes down on the floor, \u201cThird uncle (San Shu), just because you like dogs, don't a.s.sume everyone will like them\u201dYan Lao San, who has been countered by Yan Mu's words, choked for a while. Then he sat down on the sofa, he pointed to the man behind him, \u201cThis is Huangchuan, mine and your third aunt's nephew and he is your brother, get acquainted with him.\u201dYan Mu raised his lower eyelids and looked at the man behind him, who was slightly fat, short and ugly. He silently shifted his eyes and looked at Lu Chengyu several times before expressionlessly saying, \u201cMy brothers' surname is Yan and Mu.\u201d (T/N: His dad is from Yan Family, while his mom is from Mu family, don't confuse it with Yan Mu's name and as for why he looks at Chengyu is because Huangchuan is quite ugly, so he needs to clean his eyes by looking at handsome Chengyu)Instantly, Yan Lao San's face was facing down because of shame, he throws his cigar on the floor and grinds it with his shoe's sole, then he said calmly, \u201cIf you say that, you simply don't think much of your third aunt?\u201d\u201cYou are the one who supposed to take care of the third aunt, Third Uncle, don't confused about this relationship,\u201d said Yan Mu while reclining back to his chair, \u201cThird Uncle's joke just now is not funny.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Yan Lao San was angry and forcefully rushed forwards as if he wants to attack Yan Mu. His two bodyguards who were standing at the door saw the situation and immediately hasten to enter the office. But before they can do anything, suddenly they felt pain on their lower abdomens, and in an instant, they realized they were kicked towards the office's wall and even knocked down the bonsai tree at the corner.Such a big movement let the angry Yan Lao San honestly stop. At the same time, several people in the room looked at the young man that standing at the door smiling.\u201cI'm sorry, my leg accidentally cramped,\u201d Lu Chengyu went to the nearest bodyguard and stooped down to reach out to the man and try to help him up. This action frightened the bodyguard and he shrinks back, his whole body was close to the corner and didn't dare to reach out.Lu Chengyu stood up and patted the dust on his trouser legs. He smiled at Yan Lao San and said, \u201cExcuse me, I'm disturbing your conversation, please continue.\u201dYan Lao San swallowed his saliva. How could he get angry? He was choked back to his stomach by Chengyu's movement. He looks at his two bodyguards huddled in the corner and looks at the Yan Mu's who didn't change his expression from beginning to end, he had to endure his anger. He returns to the sofa and sits down, \u201cI came to see you today for the sake of my nephew.\u201d He didn't wait for Yan Mu's reply and continue to say, \u201cI heard that you are looking for a contractor for a project in Jin Hexian recently. You might as well leave it to Huangchuan. This boy is careful and sure to do well.\u201dHuangchuan immediately facing Yan Mu to win favour by fawning and give a pleasant smile to him. When he smiles, his five senses [1] instantly muster in the same place, which looks really hideous. Lu Chengyu who stood beside with a smile plastered on his face suddenly thinks to himself, the artists who had been doing unwritten rules with Huangchuan in his past life must have good psychological quality. Otherwise, how could they calmly face such a person?[1] \u4e94\u5b98\u00a0\u00a0 [w\u01d4 gu\u0101n]: five sense organs of TCM (nose, eyes, lips, tongue, ears); facial featuresHuading bought a piece of land in Jin Hexian. Due to the land size is quite small, this land is suitable to build a small residential area and even the construction plan has been designed, but the construction team has not yet been determined. Yan Lao San's trip here is nothing more than to let Huading hand over the matter to Huangchuan.Although Jin Hexian's project seems small and not worth mentioning, it is still able to bring profit to Huading, and any mistake in doing this project will cost a lot of money.For Yan Mu, although Jin Hexian is not a big project invested by Huading, it is impossible to hand over construction plan of a small residential area to an unfamiliar person. He looked at Huangchuan, who has been smiling and showing his missing teeth, Yan Mu quickly move his eyes away from this man, \u201cThe staff that involve in Jin Hexian has already talked the construction team. Since Mr Huang is the third uncle's nephew, how can he be handling these insignificant small matters?\u201d\u201cAs long as the young people are willing to endure hardship, why not giving it to him?\u201d said Yan Lao San while laughing, \u201cWhat's more, it's only a small investment in Jin Hexian. What's the reason you can't rest a.s.sured with my nephew?\u201d\u201cI wonder if Mr Huang has a construction qualification certificate?\u201d At this time, Lu Chengyu slowly opened his mouth and said, \u201cThe reputation of Huading's construction of residential communities is known as second to none in this industry. The reason, of course, is that Huading's building quality is good and the residents can trust it, so the choice of contractors is very important. I wonder what buildings Mr Huang has built before?\u201dIn the real estate sector, some people will get the contract for building houses and then spend money to rent other people's construction qualification certificates, so that they can build houses smoothly and make a good profit. Huangchuan probably belongs to this category, because Chengyu knows very well what Huangchuan used to do, which is absolutely not related to architecture.When Huangchuan heard Lu Chengyu's question, his original smiling face suddenly became stiff and he stammered, \u201cThis\u2026 I have only recently begun to enter this industry, which requires more support from President Yan, more support.\u201d\u201cThat is to say, Mr Huang, you haven't worked in this field before?\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled meaningfully. While Huangchuan is in trance, Chengyu suddenly said, \u201cI don't know whether you want tea or coffee. I'll prepare it for you.\u201d\u201cNo need,\u201d Yan Lao San looks angrily at Lu Chengyu, and his tone was even worse, he stood up, \u201cThink about what my nephew asked. Since you are busy, I'll leave first,\u201dHe went to Lu Chengyu and looked at the smiling young man. He stretches out one of his hand and pat him on the shoulder and said, \u201cYoung man, really brave.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and bowed his head, he said, \u201cThank you Mr Yan San for your praise. This younger generation is not worthy of it.\u201d\u201cHumph!,\u201d Yan Lao San take off his hand from Chengyu's shoulder and left. When Huangchuan saw the situation, he said goodbye to Yan Mu and then followed him out. While walking outside, Huangchuan looked again at the handsome young man standing at the door. He saw that the young man showed a strange smile to him.He went out of the office and walks toward the elevator. Then he saw the two bodyguards behind his uncle covering their abdomen, he sighs with emotion and said: \u201cWho was that young man just now, President Yan's secretary? He looks so young.\u201d\u201cWho knows what he is,\u201d sneered Yan Lao San, \u201cHe just graduate this year and yet being transferred to work beside Yan Mu. Only they know themselves what kind of fishy things happen between them.\u201dWhen Huang Chuan heard this, his mind suddenly thinks in a crooked way. It was not impossible that President Yan is the same as him. He looks so proper that Huangchuan didn't think Yan Mu is the same as him.But that young man just now looks really delicious. No wonder even President Huading is attracted to him.The president's office was calm again. Yan Mu saw Lu Chengyu bending over to tidy up the bonsai tree that had just been knocked over by Yan Lao San's bodyguards and he asked, \u201cYou know that Huangchuan just now?\u201d Otherwise, people like Lu Chengyu would not have that kind of att.i.tude just now.Luo Chengyu placed back that bonsai tree at an attractive angle in the office. After he heard Yan Mu's question, he claps his hand and said: \u201cI've heard about this man. He has some problems in his character. If Jin Hexian's project is given to him to do it, it will be a small matter for him to gain profit by underhand means. If he slacks off and reduced the material quality of the building, it will be a big problem.\u201d\u201cWell, Huading's buildings can't be handed over to such people.\u201d said Yan Mu while nodding and he added, \u201cThe man's appearance is not very good either.\u201dLu Chengyu silently glanced at Yan Mu and nodded his head, agreeing with Yan Mu's statement. Sc.u.m like Huangchuan, living is truly a sin. Such a person who lacks virtue, talent and appearance, how many mistakes did his parents make that such a green-rice son who is full of defects can partic.i.p.ate in the life race and attain the first place?Yan Mu looked at the bonsai tree that had been placed back in new angle by Chengyu, \u201cJust now, thank you so much.\u201d\u201cI'm your a.s.sistant. It's my professional ethics to deal with these problems.\u201d said Lu Chengyu while smiling, \u201cI haven't been exercising lately, and my feet haven't been strong enough.\u201dYan Mu can't help but place his hand on his abdomen and speak with a solemn tone, \u201cIt's already great.\u201d\u201cThank you for your compliment,\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at the time and said, \u201cIt's almost five o'clock. I'll talk to you during the personnel meeting. I'll go out first.\u201dYan Mu look at the closed door, start to concentrate on his doc.u.ment, but still from time to time, he looks up at the bonsai tree that has been well placed.At the end of the day, Lu Chengyu saw that he did not need to work overtime. He went to his car at the underground parking lot and drive back home. Then he saw Yan Lao San and Huangchuan sit in a car, side by side. They are smiling and there is no trace of anger can be seen in their face, unlike when they leave the office room that afternoon.They left the President's office before 5 p.m and yet now they are leaving Huading. Did Yan Lao San bring Huangchuan to meet someone in the company after they left the office earlier?Lu Chengyu starts the engine, control the car's speed and he steadily drive his car out from the underground parking lot. The afterglow of sunset did not make him feel warm, but only make him feel hot. In summer, if you see the sunlight, you will only feel hot.While turning on the air conditioner in his car, Chengyu sneered. Huangchuan really wants to use Huading but it won't be easy.Sure enough, Huangchuan visited Huading several times in the next few days and invited people from Huading management to have dinner. However, since there is no one on top management has relented, no one dared to answer Huangchuan's request.A few days later in the afternoon, Lu Chengyu had just come out of the elevator and walks towards his car. He had not yet reached his car, and suddenly, a man came out of the elevator. After recognizing the person, Chengyu pretended to be frightened and did not see the person clearly. He kicked the person to the ground with one foot.After the man fell heavily to the ground and made a dull noise, Lu Chengyu was surprised and said, \u201cIsn't this Mr Huang? I just beat a purse-stealer the other day, when I see someone rush over, I thought someone is taking revenge onto me, that's why just now I moved my foot. I didn't think it was you, I'm so sorry.\u201d\u201cIt's alright, it's alright.\u201dHuang Chuan stood up with a bitter laugh over his protruding stomach, \u201cIt's just a misunderstanding, Is Mr Lu already off the job?\u201dLu Chengyu raised his eyebrows. It seems like Huangchuan had inquired about him. Otherwise, how could he know his surname? \u201cIs there any injury to Mr. Huang? Why don't you go to the hospital?\u201d Chengyu knows a technique of kicking foot but not leaving any trace and yet it is very painful. It can be seen from the sweat on Huangchuan's forehead and his pale face.\u201cDon't worry, I'm not hurt,\u201d said Huangchuan while laughing. \u201cI'm here today to invite Mr Lu to have dinner together. I wonder if you have time for Mr Lu?\u201dAlthough Lu Chengyu likes to eat without paying, he really has no appet.i.te for people like Huangchuan. When he just about to reject Huangchuan's offer, he heard footsteps behind him. Chengyu couldn't help but looks back and saw Yan Mu coming out of the elevator with a straight back and firm pace. It might because of Huangchuan's face hurting his eyes, but this time, when Chengyu was looking at Yan Mu, he felt that there was an aura of \u201cI'm handsome, I'm rich, I'm president\u201d all over Yan Mu's body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16: Visiting filming setHuang Chuan didn't think that he would meet the President of Huading at the parking lot. First, he was stunned and then greeted him with a happy face. \u201cI didn't expect to meet President Yan here. Why don't we have a potluck together?\u201d At first, he wanted to use Huading's internal staff to pave the way for him so that he could get the small project under Huading's banner. Who would have thought that he unexpectedly b.u.mps into Huading's President here? Of course he will spare no effort to worm his way into being a friend with Yan Mu.Yan Mu slightly wrinkle his eyebrows after he managed to take a good look to the person who's talking to him. Then he saw Lu Chengyu is standing a few steps away from Huangchuan, Yan Mu walks across Huangchuan and went beside Lu Chengyu without saying any words.When Huangchuan saw Yan Mu's action, he immediately remembers what's his uncle has told him before. It seemed like there was really something fishy is going on between a.s.sistant Lu and President of Huading. He starts to speak up, \u201cIt's rare to meet both President Yan and a.s.sistant Lu today. There is a new French restaurant opened in the Eastern District recently. If you have time, why don't we all go there?\u201dLu Chengyu raised his eyebrows and looks at Yan Mu. He can see Yan Mu looks displeased towards Huangchuan right away. Apparently, he didn't seem to like him very much.\u201cThat's okay, thank you for Mr Huang's gracious invitation but I have other things to do this evening, so I can't go.\u201d Lu Chengyu continues to speak, \u201cMr Huang must be busy, I won't take any more of your time, I'll leave first.\u201dWhen Huangchuan heard Lu Chengyu's refusal, he saw that Chengyu already has gone before he manages to stop him. Obviously, Chengyu is not in the mood to eat with him now. Huangchuan looks at Yan Mu, he hopes that Yan Mu will agree to eat with him due to his relationship with Third Uncle as in giving him face because he is Third Uncle's nephew.\u201cNo need, thank you,\u201d Yan Mu answered briefly and go to his car. Under Huangchuan's gaze, Yan Mu drove his car away.\u201cAren't you two just stinky money? Why the h.e.l.l put on airs?\u201d Huangchuan kicked the building pillar with one leg and spit, \u201cEven that little toy boy is acting up, peii [1].\u201c[1] \u5478 [p\u0113i]: pooh!; to spit (in contempt)As soon as Lu Chengyu's car left the parking lot, he saw Yan Mu's car coming from behind. Chengyu slowed down his car and rolled down the window, he waved to Yan Mu, \u201cSee you tomorrow, boss.\u201dYan Mu was stunned. When he was ready to wave back to him, he saw Lu Chengyu's car is already in front of him. Yan Mu looked at his hand and closed the window.When Lu Chengyu drove past a public square, he saw Liang Company's real estate advertis.e.m.e.nt on the big screen there. In the advertis.e.m.e.nt, Liang Company's high-grade community area looks splendid and magnificent, just like a fairyland. At the same time, the advertis.e.m.e.nt also declares that living in this community is a symbol of good status and high-quality taste.The slogan for this advertis.e.m.e.nt looks quite vulgar [2] but it didn't stop the local tyrant to buy houses from this community considering how they like to show off their financial status to everyone else.[2] vulgar slogan: Liang stated that if you buy houses in our community, then you have status and high taste, if not, then you don't have status or taste.When Chengyu failed in Liang Company's interview, he did not pay much attention to Liang Company's affairs. He only knew that although the house in Liang Company's community was expensive, it was quickly sold out. Only a few years later, the quality problem appeared in this community area, and Liang had to spend a lot of energy and money to settle the matter.But later on, Huading took everything and read at Shunraikitranslations babe.\u201cDo you have no eyes? Want to die?!\u201dWhen Lu Chengyu heard the roar in front of him, he slowed down his car and looks in front of him. He found that a car was parked in front of him and there were some fruits and vegetables scattered on the ground. The object of scolding was Chen Jin, who has already worked in Liang Company.Lu Chengyu frowned and he did not want to entangle in this problem. Who knows that when he was just about to change lanes and go around, Chen Jin suddenly looked up at him and the next moment, both of them look at each other. Now, Chengyu was too embarra.s.sed to leave.Lu Chengyu parks his car beside the road and walks to the driver who was still shouting at Chen Jin, he knocked on his car's window. \u201cWhat is this, buddy?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing? Do you think you have more people, you can bully me?\u201d The driver looks tall and strong and he was not afraid when he sees a young man who looked like a refined person knock on his car's window, he yelled, \u201cIt's easy to walk on such a wide road and yet b.u.mp onto my car, doesn't this show that he got no eyes? Isn't this harmful?\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and waited for the man to finish yelling, then he leaned on and place one of his hand on top of the car's roof and raised his eyebrows: \u201cBuddy, this is the entrance and exit of the square. There are many pedestrians walking here. Look at the place where you parked. It's less than one meter from the zebra crossing. You are lucky that you didn't crash into someone today. If someone gets hurt, it's won't be a small matter.\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you threatening me for money?\u201d The driver raises up his voice. It seems like if Chengyu admits that he is threatening him, the driver will use his fist and beat up Chengyu.\u201cThat's a terrible thing to say, do you think that my brother is lack of money?\u201d Lu Chengyu inserts his head through the car's window and grabs the driver's shoulder, \u201cThis matter, is this how you are going to ask for forgiveness to the victim family?\u201d(T/N: Chengyu means that if the driver really hit someone with a car, will he say things like \u201cthreatening for money\u201d to the victim's family for the accident that he caused although he was the one wrong.)After Lu Chengyu put his hand on the driver's shoulder, the driver's face change to red and then to white. After apologizing, he threw down several banknotes, step on the accelerator and drove away quickly.Lu Chengyu picks up and gave the money to Chen Jin. Seeing that Chen Jin didn't take the money, he stooped down and pick up the fruits and vegetables that had not been damaged on the ground. He put the money together with the fruits and vegetables, \u201cWhere do you live? I'll drive you back.\u201dChen Jin looked at the bag full of vegetables and fruits and he shook his head, \u201cNo need, I live quite close from here. Thank you for just now.\u201d He doesn't want to meet Lu Chengyu at all. Only when he doesn't see this person that his feelings will fade.\u201cNo need to say thanks.\u201d Lu Chengyu had nothing to say with Chen Jin. He had some complicated feelings about Chen Jin. In the beginning, Chengyu cares about Chen Jin because Chen Jin's family conditions were not very good. Who knows that Chen Jin had feelings for him, and Chengyu refused Chen Jin. Finally, Chen Jin was with the man that related to the accidental death of Chengyu's parents. Although this has nothing to do with Chen Jin and he knows that Chen Jin did nothing wrong to him from beginning to end, he is unwilling to have much contact with Chen Jin.Chen Jin reluctantly smiled and looked at Lu Chengyu's car that was parked by the roadside. He nodded to Lu Chengyu and walked across the sidewalk to the opposite side of the street.Lu Chengyu turned around and got on his car. He closed the window and switch on the air conditioner, only then he felt less hot compared of being outside. He looked at Chen Jin's back, shook his head and then he drives back home.Chen Jin shook his leg and throw away all the fruits and vegetable later on in love.During the weekend holiday, Lu Chengyu went to the \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b's studio to see the filming's progress. As soon as he entered the studio, he heard Zhang Shuo's voice shouting at an actress. When Zhang Shuo saw Chengyu is coming, he reluctantly suppressed his anger and greet Chengyu.As the investor in the film, Lu Chengyu seldom appeared and did not attend the opening ceremony before. Therefore, when others saw that the director is being extremely polite to a handsome young man, they wonder which star's younger brother and so on, ready to play a part in this movie.After learning about the shooting progress, Lu Chengyu did not say anything but watched the performances of the actors behind the monitor. To be honest, the heroine's acting skills in this movie is not outstanding, but fortunately, the success of this movie lies in the wonderful plot and the laughing factor between several male actors' ridiculous conflict. Whether or not the heroine is just the decoration of the film is not so important.Several male actors in this movie are not well-known actors. Although they have some strength, they have a mediocre look. In the past, they were just acting as pa.s.serby A or B in TV dramas. No one would have thought that these people would become the new generation of powerful actors because of this movie. Even one of them won the t.i.tle of film emperor in a few years later.After they finish shooting several scenes, Zhang Shuo called several leading actors to greet the investor. Only then did everyone know that this handsome young man was not an artist, but the movie's investor.The several leading actors who have been called by the director to meet Chengyu has spent a lot of time in the entertainment circle. After listening to the director's introduction, they all came forward to greet Lu Chengyu. Lu Chengyu used a gentle tone while speaking to these actors and he also took some photos with them and asked for their' signatures.The action taken by Chengyu really make these several actors feel excited. With their status in the entertainment circle, they don't have many fans, but now the investor himself is taking pictures with them, even asked for their signature. This investor really gives them face and didn't take his ident.i.ty as an investor to embarra.s.s them. In this circle, it is not a new thing for investors making things difficult for the actors.One of the male stars, Gao Boyang, felt that Lu Chengyu seems so familiar. After he spends some time thinking, he finally remembered and said, \u201cMr Lu looks very similar to the person who was popular in \u2018Q University's Gra.s.s HD Photo' in Weibo some time ago, but you look more energetic than him.\u201d This statement is very appropriate because whether or not Lu Chengyu is the person in \u2018Q University's Gra.s.s HD Photo', Boyang meant to praise Chengyu.After Gao Boyang said this, several other people looked at Lu Chengyu. Lin Mengmeng, the actress, nodded her head and said, \u201cYes, you really look like him, I have even forwarded that post in Weibo.\u201d The people who mix around in the entertainment circle are not stupid, they can tell one or two gossips.In his previous life, Lu Chengyu used to work as a manager to an actor and also mix around performers and production crew in drama team, thus he knew that it was not easy for actors, they just say these things to please the investor. Chengyu smiled and said, \u201cYou two are really worthy of being stars, you can recognize me.\u201dAll people like to hear praises, so does this actor and actress. When Gao Boyang and Lin Mengmeng heard this, the smiles on their faces became somewhat sincere.Zhang Shuo listened to their conversation, but his face showed some contemplative expression. Finally, his face became a little hesitant. Lu Chengyu, who is good at observing people's feelings, began to ask, \u201cWhat's wrong, Director Zhang?\u201dZhang Shuo looked at Lu Chengyu, laughed a few times and rubbed his hands and said, \u201cI need a gentle college student to appear in the next few scenes but after a while, I can't find any suitable actor for it. Now you are here, and the role is quite suitable\u2026\u201d He wanted to say that it would save a lot of money, and Lu Chengyu was the popular person in \u2018Q University's Gra.s.s HD Photo' before, which might be a selling point of the film.But when he thinks that the other party neither doesn't lack money nor want to enter the entertainment circle, he did not say the rest of his words.Lu Chengyu immediately understood what Zhang Shuo trying to say. He remembered that there was such a college student role in \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b, but only for a few scenes. The significance of this \u2018Mr Perfect' [3] college student's appearance is to produce a funny element by comparing the downfall and helplessness of the male actor's gra.s.s-root [4] nature.[3] \u9ad8\u5bcc\u5e05 [g\u0101o f\u00f9 shu\u00e0i]: \u201cMr Perfect\u201d (i.e. tall, rich and handsome) (Internet slang)[4] \u5c4c\u4e1d [gra.s.s-root]: self-deprecating (A self-deprecating person knows his own weaknesses and shortcomings and isn't afraid to point them out, often in a humorous way)\u201cAre you asking me to make a guest appearance?\u201d Lu Chengyu touched his chin and laughed, \u201cNo problem, then Director Zhang must remember to pay my salary.\u201dZhang Shuo laughed and said, \u201cIsn't this salary comes out from your own pocket?\u201d But he was relieved that Mr Lu was indeed a very good man. Chengyu did not meddle on how he directs the movies, gave funds on time, good-tempered, talkative and reasonable. As a director, he was lucky to meet such a good investor.A person can achieve this much although he is just a young man, Zhang Shuo really doesn't know what kind of person he will be in the future.Shunraikitranslation.home.blog-> read here okay?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWow, what a fast release~! Is what you guys probably think right now, so here's the truth. I start translating Chapter 16 quite a few days ago. Then why the heck did you didn't release it?\u00a0 Well, it turns out when I was translating the last part of that chapter, there was some part that doesn't make any sense to me, then I went to read Chapter 17, which explain a lot on what's going on, leads to this situation -> translating both chapter on the same time = more delays in publishing the chapter.And when I finished translating Chapter 16 and went to translate the last part in Chapter 17, aiming for double release, yippiee~But, guess what, Chapter 17 and 18 has the same thing (?) as Chapter 16 and 17. (Confusing as h.e.l.l, it just meant that I manage to translate the first part in Chapter 18 by the time I post this chapter) What with this first, second, third part? MTaFB novel usually has 15k++ in each chapter (yes, I count it wrong, it was 15k~ )\u00a0So each part = approximately 5k characters. I just hope Chapter 18 and 19 don't have this kind of thing (?) or else expect a late release.Without further ado, lets read it~Read this novel at shunraikitranslation.home.blog or I'm gonna married Yan Mu.Chapter 17: Borrowing a car.Although Chengyu has promised Zhang Shuo to act as \u2018Mr Perfect' in his movie, they have a problem with the venue, thus all his scenes will be taken tomorrow. Another important problem is they haven't found the luxury car for \u2018Mr Perfect' yet. Zhang Shuo and the producer are planning to rent a famous car's brand from the car rental shop for the movie's group early tomorrow's morning, so they have to move back their plan.When Zhang Shuo and the producer are talking about luxury cars, Lu Chengyu suddenly remembered Yan Mu's Maybach and he touched his chin, Chengyu said, \u201cLuxury cars\u2026 What kind of cars do you want?\u201cIt will be better if it's more expensive,\u201d when Zhang Shuo heard Lu Chengyu's tone, he knows that the boss might have a way, he thought for a while and boldly said, \u201cAt least worth more than a million dollar.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded and took out his cell phone. After he thinks about it for a second, he dialled his phone. After two or three beeps, he heard Yan Mu's voice.\u201ca.s.sistant Lu, what can I do for you?\u201dLu Chengyu coughed and said, \u201cBoss, are you free now? I need your help.\u201dWhen Yan Mu, who was having dinner with his friends, heard this, he placed down his chopstick and asked, \u201cI'm free, what's wrong?\u201d\u201cMy friends are shooting a movie and they need a famous car's brand, but due to their limited budget and unable to find the right car for a while, I want to ask if is it okay for you to lend your car to the movie's crew tomorrow,\u201d Lu Chengyu organizes his speech so that he can be polite and not flattering at the same time, \u201cWhen I think about it, the person nearby me who drives luxury car is only you, boss.\u201d\u201cLuxury car?\u201d Yan Mu thought about it carefully and suddenly he remembered that there was an Aston Martin sports car [1] worth nearly 50 million dollars in his garage. Two or three years after he returned home from abroad, his father gave him this car. Due to the fact that this car could go overspeed with a slight step on the accelerator and he doesn't like driving this flashy car around, this car has been kept in his garage. A few days ago, he just had people examined and repair all the cars in his garage so there will not be any safety problem. Yan Mu said, \u201cI have an Aston Martin sports car in the garage from a few years ago. The price is about forty-five million. Can it be used in the movie's group?\u201d[1](T/N: this car looks so\u2026\u2026FREAKING RICH~! no wonder Chengyu's choked)Lu Chengyu can hear himself choking when he heard about the car. He plans to borrow the 10 million-dollar Maybach. Who would have thought that the other party would generously lend him a more valuable Aston Martin sports car, which made him a little speechless for a while, but can't blame him for not thinking that far, he hadn't imagined seeing this luxury car at all.Yan Mu thought that his car was not good enough since there was no response from Lu Chengyu through his mobile phone. After all, many people around him like cars. They are even willing to throw out their money for cars. But Yan Mu is not the kind of person who likes cars, so he doesn't have many choices of cars in his garage, \u201cIf not, I will find my friend to lend you a car. Where did you shoot the movie? What kind of luxury car do you need? Tomorrow, I'll send you the car.\u201dWhen the two of Yan Mu's friends who were eating with him heard this, both of them raised their mouth and make an ambiguous smile. They wink and make signs to each other.\u201cNo, no need to do that, Aston Martin is great. I'll drive it tomorrow, how can I let you drive the car, boss.\u201d Lu Chengyu pressed down the tremor in his heart's tremor that caused by the luxury car and he rubbed his nose, \u201cI can't let the person that I borrow things deliver it to me.\u201d\u201cIt's all right, I have nothing to do tomorrow. I'll wait for you to send the address of the shooting's venue tomorrow through messages, I will send the car to you.\u201d Yan Mu saw that his friend is winking towards him, \u201cI have something to do, I'll hang up first.\u201d\u201cWhich young star that Ah Mu likes that he has to send the luxury car in front of her house?\u201d Zhuang Yu smiled and said, \u201cIt's rare for you to fall for someone without us knowing it. Tell us more about her, maybe someday in the future, we can take care of her.\u201d(T/N: okay, in Chinese language, usually they used \u2018you' for both male and female, their conversation above used \u2018you', so I can't detect whether it is \u2018she' or \u2018he' but I choose \u2018she' because I don't think they know Yan Mu's preference and the following dialogue leans more to \u2018she'.)Zhang Zeyun, who was at the same table as Yan Mu and Zhuang Yu nod his head. Although Yan Mu is already 27 \u2013 28 years old this year, he didn't show interest towards any woman. When other people in his circle having fun with cars, he was studying abroad for a doctorate; when everyone else is having fun with women on a yacht, he used his skill and crushed the head of Yan's family and his illegitimate son from outside. Now that the former head of Yan family is already dead, he reorganized the chaotic Huading and held it firmly in his hands. He is the winner of life. Since his childhood until now, the other families' parents in the capital keeps on comparing him with their sons which leads to many people hates Yan Mu.But as friends, they know it. Yan Mu is not really naive and guileless, but rather, he was not interested in this kind of things. What's the point of living such a regular life? Even if it's a messy and crazy life, it doesn't waste your youth. So now they were so interested to hear which young star Yan Mu might be involved with.\u201cNot a young star, he's just a friend wanted to borrow a car,\u201d Yan Mu put his cell phone on the table and frowned. \u201cHe's a very capable man. Don't make such a joke.\u201dZhang Zeyun and Zhuang Yu know Yan Mu's disposition. Both of them were somewhat helpless, apparently, this matter is not something to joke about. They both nodded their head to show that they won't be joking about this matter anymore in the future and let Yan Mu properly cherish this person.Director Zhang looks at Chengyu's strange expression after he hung up the phone, he went to Chengyu and with careful tone, he asked, \u201cIs there any problem with the car?\u201dLu Chengyu looked at him and gave a dry cough: \u201cDon't worry, it will be delivered early tomorrow morning.\u201d He asked Zhang Shuo the address for shooting tomorrow. After sending it to Yan Mu, Chengyu saw Zhang Shuo still looked anxious. He laughed and said, \u201cMy boss is are fine lending his car. As director, you are more anxious than I am?\u201dZhang Shuo blushed, he scratches his head and smiles to hide his embarra.s.sment, \u201cIt's not that. I'm worried that the movie couldn't keep up with the schedule since I'm planning to release it during the National Day, so I'm a little bit panicked.\u201dLu Chengyu knows that if they delay for one day, the crew will spend an extra day. Now the crew's budget is rather tight. Later on, editing and auditing will cost money. So when filming, we should try our best to seize the time and avoid wasting resources. As a director, Zhang Shuo treats his works as if its' were his children, so he is more worried about movies than the investor.\u201cNational Day is really a good time to release movie,\u201d Lu Chengyu think for a bit. \u201cRest a.s.sured, I will let the studio's producer cooperate with you as much as possible.\u201dZhang Shuo smiled, turned around and asked the actors to get ready. His voice was so loud that the whole group could hear him.Gao Boyang, Lin Mengmeng and other leading actors know that is it not good to continue surrounding the investor and they went to start working. By the time they finish shooting several scenes, the young investor has already left the filming set.The young investor was actually a goblin come straight from h.e.l.l on h.e.l.l, woooww~Early the next morning, the movie team have set up the venue beforehand. Zhang Shuo saw Lu Chengyu coming, he took him to the makeup artist and she began to make up Chengyu. As for clothes\u2026 Zhang Shuo looked at the Lu Chengyu's clothes that he specially changed today, his casual suits, shoes and wrist.w.a.tches are better than the one prepared by the movie team, so they need not be changed.After she has done with makeup and change Lu Chengyu's hairstyle, the makeup artist looked up and down at him several times. This man was very handsome, but it seemed that there was something missing. She even tried placing sungla.s.ses or other accessories but she can't find that feeling.Lu Chengyu saw the makeup artist scratching her ears and cheeks. He took out a pair of golden-rim gla.s.ses from his casual suit and wear it. Then, suddenly the makeup artist felt \u2018this is it!', Chengyu stood up and said, \u201cLet's go and see if the car has arrived.\u201dZhang Shuo stood outside the dressing room and saw Lu Chengyu come out. He looked up and said, \u201cThis, this is it!.\u201dLu Chengyu is a college student who has a good family background, handsome appearance and elegant manners. He is just like a n.o.ble son in the upper-cla.s.s family that has this kind of family-style n.o.bility emanate all over his body. Only in this way can he can have a sharp contrast with gra.s.s-roots [2] male actors and able to produce black humour and criticism of reality through the plot.[2] \u5c4c\u4e1d [gra.s.s-root]: self-deprecating (A self-deprecating person knows his own weaknesses and shortcomings and isn't afraid to point them out, often in a humorous way)Lu Chengyu gently pushes his gla.s.ses on his nose bridge with one hand and put another hand into his trouser's pocket. He slightly rises up his chin and looks at Zhang Shuo. Suddenly, Zhang Shuo can see the four-big letters of \u2018Y\u012b Gu\u0101n Q\u00edn Sh\u00f2u [3]' behind Lu Chengyu.[3] \u8863\u51a0\u79bd\u517d [y\u012b gu\u0101n q\u00edn sh\u00f2u]: dressed up animal (idiom); fig. immoral and despicable personZhang Shuo was even more excited. This is what he wants. This feeling. Although there weren't many scenes of this college student, they were very important. So he can't find the right person. Now, it's a great satisfaction for him to find an actor who is 100% in line with his own expectations.However, Zhang Shuo's happy event today is not over yet. He saw Lu Chengyu answer a phone call and suddenly his face slightly changed. Lu Chengyu walks to the movie studio's front door. Zhang Shuo guessed that the car must have arrived, so he followed Lu Chengyu to join in the excitement.Then he saw a crowd of people surrounding a shiny car in front of the movie's studio. Due to there's a lot of people, he can only see the car's roof.The onlookers saw that the investors and the directors are coming their way, so they make a path to them. When Zhang Shuo saw the car, he was dumbfounded. Although he hadn't eaten pork before, he had seen pig running [4]. Isn't this is the Aston Martin sports car that came out two years ago? He went to an auto show before. This sports car was not only expensive but also limited edition. Their entire budget was only 2 \u2013 3 million only. When such a luxury car came to the movie site, he suddenly felt somewhat unreal.[4] used to connect with other people's things. Although he has not experienced it personally, he has heard of it, has seen it and understand it a little bit.Lu Chengyu walk to the car and saw Yan Mu get off from the car. He pushed back his gla.s.ses and smile towards Yan Mu, \u201cThank you, boss, for helping me with this trip.\u201dYan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu who wear gla.s.ses and saw there were some makeup's traces on his face. After a while, Yan Mu asked, \u201cYou want to be an actor?\u201d\u201cNo, it just movie crew happen to lack of actors so I was pulled in to act in this movie and my scene should able to complete within half-day.\u201d Lu Chengyu took off his gla.s.ses and smiled brilliantly at Yan Mu, \u201cAre you not used to me looking like this?\u201d\u201cNo, it looks good,\u201d Yan Mu handed the key to Lu Chengyu. \u201cCan I stay for the shooting?\u201d\u201cDo as you wish, you can see it,\u201d Lu Chengyu turned his head and looked at Zhang Shuo who was behind him, \u201cDirector Zhang, will it be a problem?\u201d\u201cNo problem. This gentleman is your friend. Just looking will be no problem.\u201d A small movie budget like this, no reporters will be willing to take pictures and even less potential for someone wants to spy this movie.\u201cThat's good.\u201d Lu Chengyu took Yan Mu to the director's monitor and sat down. On such a hot day, this place not only was hidden from the sunlight and there is also an electric fan here. \u201cI'm going to finish shooting these scenes first. And then, let's eat together at noon. I'll treat you.\u201d Yan Mu's generous act of borrowing a luxury car has made him forget that Yan Mu has made him spent more than 8,000 yuan on a meal when they first met.Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu's back and the messy background around him. Then he straightened his back and sat down on the grey stool beside the monitor.Although he didn't know much about filming, however, looking at a.s.sistant Lu appearance today, it seems like filming is quite interesting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He He He\u2026Read at Shunraikitranslation.home.blog or you guys gonna get married to some guy like Huangchuan.Chapter 18: The whole weekendThe biggest difference between the rich and poor movie team is that the poor movie team have fewer people and equipment, and even the pa.s.serby actors are mostly played by their own crew members.On the streets full with tall buildings, a man with greasy dirt all over his body, was prepared to take out a coin from his trousers pocket to buy steamed bread from a roadside trolley. As a result, his feet slipped and the coin in his hand rolled out along the floor tiles.The poor man was ready to chase the coin, but suddenly a flashy sports car rushed out and stopped just above the coin. His throat moved and he turned aside to look at the old man who sells steamed bread. He rushed forward and lie on the ground, reaching the coin from\u00a0under the car using his hand to get it back.Just as he breathed a sigh of relief, the door suddenly opened and the camera lens gives a shot towards the shoe that stretched out of the car's door first, followed by long legs, and finally fell on the beautiful chin along with the elegant casual suit.\u201ch.e.l.lo, is there any trouble?\u201d as the man speaks, his lower jaw moves and the words utters from his mouth was very polite and courteous.The camera turns to the protagonist, who was still laying on the ground and look at the car's owner in a daze. The foolish look was extraordinarily ridiculous. The camera followed the protagonist's eyes and shoot to the car's owner again. The camera moved upward along the white chin, with slightly upward-warped lips, straight nose, and peach blossom eyes, which are loved by women, hidden under the golden-rim gla.s.ses [1], astonishingly handsome.[1]-somewhat like this (?)\u201cIs there anything under the car?\u201d The car's owner bends down gracefully and smiles while reaching towards the protagonist who was still laying on the ground and he said, \u201cIf it's alright, please come out.\u201dThe long, white fingers stretched out in front of the protagonist give an illusion of his dirty face becoming even dirtier.\u201cOkay, CUT!\u201d Zhang Shuo clapped his hands delightedly and said, \u201d Mr Lu's acting skills are very good. It's a pity he does not to enter this circle!\u201dSitting next to Zhang Shuo, Yan Mu he gave him a look. \u201cIf he were an actor, it would be a pity for other industries.\u201dZhang Shuo forgot that there was still this man sitting beside him. He shook the round plastic fan [2] in his hand, wiped the sweat on his forehead and chuckled. \u201cNaturally a man like Mr Lu shouldn't be an actor, but I can't be blamed if I want to praised Mr Lu's acting skill.\u201d As a person who doesn't have any experience to act in a movie, Lu Chengyu had a good grasp on which position to stand. Although he got several NGs, Chengyu has performed well, much better than the heroines in this movie.[2]\u201cDirector Zhang, is this scene is over, isn't it?\u201d Lu Chengyu came over and went behind the monitor to see his performance just now. He saw Yan Mu gave him a water bottle, Chengyu took the bottle and drinks it in a few gulps. Then, he pushes Yan Mu to one side so that he could feel the wind blow from the electric fan.In his previous life, he worked as a manager to an artist in a brokerage company. He also worked in a drama production. He knew one or two things about acting, therefore he could adapt quickly.When the makeup artist saw Chengyu was resting, she quickly took the opportunity to touch up his makeup. She said, \u201d Mr Lu, your acting just now is so handsome!\u201dLu Chengyu just laughs and wait for her to touch-up his makeup. After she finished it, Chengyu wear that gla.s.ses again and speak towards Yan Mu who sit beside him, \u201cBoss, I still have two more scenes and it will be done.\u201d\u201cEn, don't worry,\u201d Yan Mu took the round plastic fan beside him and fanning towards Lu Chengyu for a few times. Seeing that Chengyu was in a hurry to catch up with the next scene, he was afraid that talking would affect the mood of the other party when filming, so he did not speak much. (T/N: *cough*husband material*cough*fanning wife*cough*)\u201cThank you.\u201d Lu Chengyu noticed Yan Mu's action and gave him a grateful smile. The next scene's setting is already done, Chengyu put down his water bottle and he gets ready for shooting. After he stands up, he smiled at Yan Mu. All in all, he met a very kind boss.The next scene was the protagonist used a hilarious way to break \u2018Mr Perfect's gracefulness. Afterwards, \u2018Mr Perfect' have no other choice than calmly leave him. The final scene is the car sped out and blew the exhaust smoke onto the protagonist's face.Shunraikitranslation.home.blog is the best, read there\u00a0 dude~~It was until 12 noon that they finished shooting all scenes. Lu Chengyu took off his gla.s.ses and hurried to remove his makeup. Seeing the tall and big Yan Mu still sitting on that small, broken stool, Chengyu quickened his pace and went towards Yan Mu. He pushed back his wet hair and said, \u201cBoss, let's go.\u201dYan Mu stood up and thinks for a bit. He then turned around and took the round plastic fan that has the words \u201cInfertility, go to XX hospital\u201d printed on it and gave it to Lu Chengyu. \u201cThe fan is nice and cool.\u201dLu Chengyu also likes this fan, which was given out on a roadside by the hospital for free publicity. He took the fan and starts fanning himself. He also asked Zhang Shuo to buy ice drinks for the crew before he left with Yan Mu.Zhang Shuo watched Lu Chengyu and the man who didn't talk from beginning to end, get on the Aston Martin sports car and leave. He came to the a.s.sistant director beside him and said, \u201cGo to the supervisor and ask for money to buy ice drink. That's what Mr Lu asked.\u201d Although he doesn't know the man who was called \u2018boss' by Mr Lu, his guts telling him that the person who able to lend tens of millions of luxury cars casually, can't be offended by them.Rubbing love, rubbing shoess~ if you read this message, then this is a fake chapter.In the car, Lu Chengyu was still fanning himself frantically: \u201cJust now, when I drove this car, I almost hit the tree. Boss, can we lower the air conditioner temperature?\u201d Sure enough, driving a luxury car can make your hands tremble.\u201cI don't like driving this kind of car either,\u201d Yan Mu said, looking straight ahead and controlling the speed steadily. \u201cYou can't lower the temperature. You'll catch a cold.\u201dLu Chengyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dDoesn't that mean he doesn't like this car?Seeing Lu Chengyu did not speak, Yan Mu thought that he was angry about lowering air-condition's temperature. He slowed down the car's speed and looked at him from the side, Yan Mu said with great emphasis, \u201cIt's really bad for your health if the temperature is too low.\u201d Then he turned on the CD and started playing light music.Lu Chengyu nodded silently and fanning himself slowly. He leaned against the window and looked out. He said nonchalantly, \u201cI have half a day to rest this weekend. I find that the rest time is always shorter than the working time.\u201d\u201cWell, it's only two days off,\u201d Yan nodded approvingly. \u201cYou'll have fewer vacations in the future.\u201d Recently, there is nothing going on in the business, therefore Lu Chengyu can stay idle. But when all the work has started, his vacation won't be two days per week.Lu Chengyu shook his head helplessly and put the round plastic fan on his seat. \u201cI've accepted my fate.\u201dYan Mu close his mouth and stay silent. He did not know whether Lu Chengyu thinks it was a pity that the holidays had been reduced, or whether he just spoke casually.Both of them are talking to each other and listens to the cheerful rhythm of pipa[3] playing throughout the car, all the way to the restaurant. Finally, they arrived at the place where they want to eat. It's a well-decorated Chinese restaurant. Since the peak hour for lunch period has already pa.s.sed, the usually-busy restaurant has empty seats.[3] \u7435\u7436 [p\u00ed pa]: Chinese lute, with 4 strings, a large pear-shaped body and a fretted fingerboardAfter following Lu Chengyu into the Chinese restaurant and eat delicious and inexpensive dishes, Yan Mu suddenly discovered that his new a.s.sistant seems to know every nook and cranny in the capital city that has delicious food.After they eat, both of them went back to the car and Yan Mu said, \u201cYou know the capital quite well.\u201d\u201cI know quite a bit about the capital city, I have been living here for more than twenty years,\u201d said Lu Chengyu, yawning. \u201cMy parents are also foodies, so I've been following them around since I was young.\u201dRecalling of what Cao Jingshen mentioned to him about Chengyu's family circ.u.mstances, Yan Mu pondered for a while and then said, \u201cThat's good. I've spent most of my time abroad, and I haven't tasted many delicious local foods.\u201d\u201cThat's alright, I bring you and we go together in the future,\u201d said Lu Chengyu while smiling, \u201cI'm just afraid if the taste is not something you're used to.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Yan Mu shook his head. \u201cI'm not a picky eater.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu. At a glance, this kind of person can be identified as not a foodie. As a foodie, you need to have, not only the ability to explore a new place for delicious cuisine, you also need be a picky eater. Not being picky about food is simply tarnishing your reputation as a foodie.\u201cI'll make sure to call you if I find a delicious restaurant.\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at the pa.s.sing scenery out of the window. It is more appetizing to eat with someone compared to eating alone.Yan Mu solemnly nodded his head. After he sends Lu Chengyu at his house, Yan Mu reminded Lu Chengyu again about the promise. Only after he received a guarantee from Lu Chengyu that he did let Lu Chengyu go upstairs.When Chengyu reaches his house, he walked to his balcony. There he can see Yan Mu's car slowly turning around and left his neighbourhood. He supports his cheek with one of his hand on the balcony fence and he chuckled. Then, Chengyu takes a watering pot and water the cactus on the balcony.As for the trivial matter of can't watering the plants at noon in summer, he could not remember it at all.Yan Mu is driving back home, but then Zhuang Yu called him. He told Yan Mu that his car broke down, so Yan Mu have to fetch him.By the time he arrived, Zhuang Yu's car had been towed away and Zhuang Yu were squatted under the tree waiting for him.When Zhuang Yu saw him, he rushed to open the front pa.s.senger's door and he sat there. He breathes a sigh of relief, \u201cIt really hot today. Ouch, f*ck, what is this thing?\u201d He felt as if there were something beneath his b.u.t.tock. He reached out and saw what it was. After he saw what it is, he glances at Yan Mu with somewhat complicated stare.This kind of shoddy round plastic fan is not something that Yan Mu will use ah, and what's with this fan's cover?Yan Mu glanced at him. \u201cWhat's wrong?\u201dMaybe Yan Mu expression was too calm, making Zhuang Yu unable to ask him anything. He casually throws that fan to the back seat, \u201d This is the car that your friend wants to borrow, right? Why are you driving it?\u201d\u201cHe was done using it,\u201d Yan Mu paused a bit, \u201cYou have inspected your car recently, haven't you? Why would it broke down?\u201d\u201cHow would I know why,\u201d chuckled Zhuang Yu with a strange expression. \u201cThey think I'm a unique existence in Zhuang's family. Moreover, under my name, there are cinemas that earn a lot of profit.\u201dYan Mu was silent for a while: \u201cAnyway, you should be more careful.\u201dZhuang Yu just sneered, he leans lean against the back of the chair and closes his eyes. Obviously, he was not in a good mood when they talked about those people in his family.Yan Mu lowered the CD's volume. When he was waiting at the traffic lights, he suddenly remembered Lu Chengyu. I wonder how he spends his time alone after work?After sweeping a large pile of rind and paper sc.r.a.ps on the tea table into the trash can, Lu Chengyu looked at the clock. It was almost ten o'clock in the evening. He stretched out his lazy waist and look at the people in the forum who were angry at him. Chengyu was in a good mood, he hums and turning off his laptop. (T/N: remember how Chengyu likes to pick a fight in forums just to make others angry as a way to spend his time? He's doing that.)Just at this moment, he received a call from his cousin Lu Dong. He was invited to attend Lu Dong and Shen Min's wedding next Sat.u.r.day.After he promises to be there on time, Lu Chengyu heard the beep from the other side's phone. Lu Dong hangs up his phone quite fast, seems like he was anxious to call someone else.Lu Chengyu touched his wallet. Anyway, he needs to prepare gift money for the wedding occasion. After adjusting the air-conditioner's temperature, he rolled and snug into the big, comfortable **.Translator notes: If you guys are interested in listening to Chinese pipa, here's a link.

MwahahahaChapter 19: DisturbanceAfter the weekend, Chengyu continues working earnestly. He had been investigating for a week and roughly understood the relationship between the company's internal management. But maybe because Yan Mu is now the president of Huading, other people in various departments are very kind to him as he is the president's a.s.sistant. No one will deliberately make things difficult to him. He knows that most of these people are smart. As long as there are no problems in their work, he will not be able to find anything.The a.s.sistant president isn't supposed to supervise all employees in the company. The workplace is not like an elementary school cla.s.s where the students tell the teacher every trivial thing, that's is the management trainers' job. If a particular person pulled hatred towards themselves, ultimately that person will only be disliked by all and in\u00a0the end, get fired from his job.For example, sometimes Chengyu went to other departments and saw some of the employees log in to their Weibo and also chat with each other when they were sleepy. He doesn't mind about it, as long as these departments do their work well and on time. As for those who violate the rules of the workplace and divulge the company's information, even if he does not deal with it, department managers will report to their superiors because they fear being implicated with it. Generally, the result of most of these things is dismissal.Read this at Shunraikitranslation.home.blog, don't support stealer websiteAfter meeting with two clients' manager, Lu Chengyu took a sip of coffee from the table. He picked up the signed contract and stood up to see the little girl at the door looking at himself admiringly. He smiled at her and leave the meeting room. If he remembered correctly, that new girl should be Cao Jingshen's new a.s.sistant.That little girl eagerly smiled back at Lu Chengyu. She looked at Lu Chengyu's back and sighed. Although both of them have the same position, which is an a.s.sistant, the differences are too big. a.s.sistant Lu was able to meet clients and handle the contract. His eloquence's skill is something really beyond an average person's ability, simply an example of a male G.o.d that she has in her mind.Recalling that a.s.sistant Lu was popular as the most handsome boy in \u2018Q University's Gra.s.s HD Photo' post on Weibo before, she took out her cellphone and send a post on Weibo, \u201cWatching the process of the male G.o.d's elegant and graceful demeanour to solve two difficult clients with few words. Handsome male G.o.d, please accept my knee[1], I demand to be your old powder[2]\u00a0@ More Than One Year\u201d[1] When you encounter the Great G.o.d level's person, you can use \u2018accept my knee' to express your respect for the Great G.o.d in a way that gives your knees. Something like below, and it literally mean to gives your knee to the other person:[2] old powder: someone that blindly follows you regardless of anything.Leggingss~Short pantss~ no one will buy it becoz they dont have knees anymoreeAfter posting it, she logs out of her Weibo and continued working. Little did she knew, her post has been forwarded by many netizens. Some people are eager to convey the post while others mock it as deliberately to create hype. Later, in the middle of this debate, Lu Chengyu's reputation as \u2018Top scholar Lu' changed to \u2018Male G.o.d Lu'.Lu Chengyu didn't know that he was getting popular again on Weibo. He gave the signed contract to Cao Jingshen, and he freeloads a box of teleaf in pa.s.sing while strolling in Cao Jingshen's office before he slowly returning upstairs to his office. Then he received an inside call from the front desk, saying that a gentleman named Mu Qirong wanted to see Yan Mu, and had he already told Yan Mu in advance.Since his surname is Mu, it should be a relative of his boss' mother. He hesitated for a moment, but he went to the president's office and knocked on the office's door, \u201cBoss, a gentleman named Mu Qirong said he wanted to see you.\u201d Chengyu would get Yan Mu's appointment schedule from Cao Jingshen in advance every day. But there is no Mu Qirong's name on today's appointment schedule.Yan Mu was paying attention to the doc.u.ments. When he heard Lu Chengyu's reports, he was stunned for a moment before he said, \u201cLet him in.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Lu Chengyu exited the office. He used the inside phone to call the front desk, asking them to let Mu Qirong go to the president office. After hanging up the phone, Chengyu thinks for a bit and goes to the elevator to wait for Mr Mu.The relationship between Yan Mu and Mu Qirong is they are cousins. It's was due to Mu Qirong's mother distressed that Yan Mu has no parents alive and Yan family doesn't care about Yan Mu, she asked Mu Qirong to visit Yan Mu and invite him to partic.i.p.ate in Mu family's c.o.c.ktail party. But he and Yan Mu didn't grow up together, how much words can he speak? (T/n: they both are not familiar with each other so they neither have common interest nor have any topic to converse.)As soon as the elevator's door open, Mu Qirong saw a young man in a dark grey suit waiting outside. Seeing Mu Qirong come out from the elevator, he showed a polite smile on his face.\u201ch.e.l.lo, Mr Mu. I'm the president's new a.s.sistant. Please come this way.\u201d Lu Chengyu took a quick look at the steady pace and sharp eyebrows of the man that just came out of the elevator. Most people who like this should be quite eager to be first, and ought to be a decent person. Of course, Lu Chengyu didn't rule out the possibility of this person could be an animal in clothes[3].[3] \u8863\u51a0\u79bd\u517d [y\u012b gu\u0101n q\u00edn sh\u00f2u]: immoral and despicable person\u201cThank you very much.\u201d Mu Qirong thanked Lu Chengyu. Before entering Yan Mu's office, he nodded to Lu Chengyu before pa.s.sing over him and walk to the front.\u201cMr Mu is courteous, please,\u201d Lu Chengyu gently pushed open the presidential office's door. After asking Mu Qirong to enter, he stepped back and closed the door.Yan Mu sees Mu Qirong come in, he put down his pen and stood up to greet Mu Qirong and ask him to sit down on the sofa. Both of them are too embarra.s.sed and awkward to speak nonsense. Neither of them is this kind of talker, so when they get together, the surrounding's temperature gets cold.\u201cThere will be a c.o.c.ktail party at home the day after tomorrow. Both Mom and Grandpa want you to come.\u201d Mu Qirong said with a dry cough, clarifying his purpose to visit Yan Mu. \u201cAre you free the night after tomorrow?\u201dYan Mu nodded. \u201cThe day after tomorrow is Wednesday.\u201d Then they looked at each other and said nothing. After a while, he heard a knock on the door. Yan Mu looked up and saw Lu Chengyu standing outside with two cups of coffee.\u201cCome in,\u201d said Yan Mu. Lu Chengyu came in, he bends down and put two cups of steaming coffee on the table. Yan Mu naturally hold the cup and scratch the rim of the cup with his index finger.\u201cThis freshly brewed coffee is quite hot. Please be careful,\u201d said Lu Chengyu after he takes note of Yan Mu's action just now. With a warm smile, Chengyu said, \u201cPlease excuse me.\u201dAfter Lu Chengyu left, Mu Qirong looked at the closed office door and he nodded, \u201cYou new a.s.sistant is much better than the last one.\u201d The last a.s.sistant that worked with Yan Mu was a.s.signed by the older generation of Yan Family. Although Mu Qirong was not interested in Yan family's calculation, he has met with the old a.s.sistant several months ago, he knew that Lu Chengyu wasn't a person to be wary.\u201cEn,\u201d Yan Mu's expression become slightly softer and he takes a sip of his coffee, \u201cHe's very good.\u201dMu Qirong looked at the steaming coffee, with a piece of unmelted ice floating in the middle. He didn't reach for the cup. \u201cAs long as he wasn't intentionally sent by others. Although he seemed young, he can handle matters steadily.\u201d\u201cI should have nothing to do on Wednesday night. I'll be there on time.\u201d Yan Mu put down his coffee cup and wiped his mouth. \u201cHe wasn't sent by anyone.\u201dMu Qirong, who had heard his cousin's willingness to attend the reception, was stunned. Only then did he understand when his cousin said \u201che\u201d, Yan Mu was referring to his a.s.sistant just now. He looked at Yan Mu's ease expression and he nodded: \u201cWell, just pay attention like usual.\u201dThe ice in the coffee cup has melted, the temperature of the coffee has gradually dropped, and the office was full of the aroma of coffee.Lu Chengyu only knew that the Mu family had not sat for long that day and left. Although he didn't know what the other party was doing, he knew that as an a.s.sistant, there is a boundary of what he can manage and what he can't manage.So when Yan Mu left work early on Wednesday afternoon, he didn't feel surprised. Bosses like Yan Mu, who almost everyday commute to work on time, are already exemplary representatives of the CEO community.After sorting out some doc.u.ments that need to be handled personally by Yan Mu, Lu Chengyu received a call from Cao Jingshen saying that Yan Lao San had come again with Huangchuan. The front desk didn't stop them and now they are wreaking havoc at Secretarial Dept.After listening to Cao Jingshen, Chengyu frowned. Did Yan Lao San already know that Yan Mu is not in the company before, then he decided brings peoples with him? Chengyu loosened the top b.u.t.ton of his shirt. When he arrived at the Secretarial Department, he saw Yan Laosan sitting in the Secretarial Department's public area with his legs crossed like he owns the place. He saw a broken cup laying on the ground, and four bodyguards with dark gla.s.ses stood on the aisle, looking fierce.Wearing big sungla.s.ses in office, does Yan Lao San thinks that he is filming a police movie now?\u201cIsn't this Mr. Yan San? What brings you here today?\u201d Lu Chengyu took off his suit coat and casually threw it on a desk. He walked to Cao Jingshen and looked at Yan Lao-san with a smile, \u201cUnfortunately, the boss just went to a c.o.c.ktail party, you come here for nothing.\u201d\u201cIt's you again,\u201d said Yan Lao San when he saw Lu Chengyu. He frowned and looked at the four bodyguards he brought.He moved his hip and coughed a little. He still acted like an elder uncle, \u201cCould it be Yan Mu doesn't want to see his third uncle, so he deliberately went off work early?\u201d\u201cWhy does Mr. Yan San think so?\u201d said Lu Chengyu while looking at Yan Lao San with unbelievable expression, \u201cThe boss's parents have pa.s.sed away. You are one of his few elders. How could he don't want to meet you? If Mr. Yan San told the boss in advance that you would come to Huading, how would the boss go to the c.o.c.ktail party?\u201dThis remark is to state that Yan Mu is a good person, while Yan Lao San, who came to Huading without a prior appointment is to create trouble. Although Chengyu's word seems polite, the real meaning actually has no trace of politeness, like a slap to the face.Yan Lao San suddenly blushed with anger. Unfortunately, he can't refute it, he just murmured, \u201ca.s.sistant Lu's mouth is still so sharp, I don't know if anyone has told you that people who talk a lot are often unlucky.\u201dLu Chengyu, as if he hadn't heard the threat in Yan Lao San's words, took the teacup from the secretary a.s.sistant who was frightened and trembling. He bends down and put his hands in front of Yan Lao San. He laughed and said: Thank you Mr. Yan San for reminding me, but my mouth is stubborn and I can't control it. You can always forgive me. I will change it slowly in the future.\u201dYan Lao San only look at the teacup that Lu Chengyu was holding, he didn't intend to take the cup, he looks at Lu Chengyu.Huangchuan saw that things were not right. He squeezed out a smile and took the cup in Lu Chengyu's hand. Actually, he wanted to touch Chengyu's hand. Who knows that the other party's hand seems to have eyes, before he could touch it, Chengyu swiftly moves his hand away.\u201cIf Mr. Yan San has any matter to discuss, you can call the boss directly.\u201d Cao Jingshen stepped out from behind Lu Chengyu and his hidden eyes under the lenses swept over to Huangchuan's hand, which holds the teacup, \u201cYou are his family, what can't be discussed?\u201dYan Lao San glance at both of them. He hit Huangchuan's hand which still holding the teacup and the teacup smash on the floor. Panting with rage, Yan Lao San left the Secretarial Dept.Lu Chengyu looked at their backs, he raised his mouth and speak in a mild way, \u201cMr. Yan San is really a straightforward man.\u201d He kicked the teacup fragments on the ground and looked at Cao Jingshen, \u201cRight?\u201dCao Jingshen took off his gla.s.ses and sneered, \u201cHe has no idea of death or danger [4].\u201c[4]\u4e0d\u77e5\u6b7b\u6d3b [b\u00f9 zh\u012b s\u01d0 hu\u00f3]: to act recklesslyYan Lao San seems to have an idea that the boss won't do anything to him, unexpectedly he did not consider that the boss has evidence on shameful things that he did in the past. Even Yan Lao Er, who is so shrewd, scared to do anything, why does Yan Lao San still doesn't understand this?\u201cIf he is courting death, others can't stop him.\u201d Lu Chengyu picked up his suit coat which was still on the table. \u201cIt's time to get off work. I'm going home.\u201d\u201cGood-bye.\u201d Cao Jingshen put on his gla.s.ses, smiled at Lu Chengyu's sight of his back. Then he turned around and asked people to clean up the office, but did not notice that his new secretary a.s.sistant secretly took a photo of Lu Chengyu's back with her mobile phone.If you can read this,meaning that you have been reading fake chapter all along, wowTherefore, that evening, after Lu Chengyu came back from jogging and login to his Weibo, he found that his Weibo account, More than one year, which has the prestige as a top scholar before, begin to buzz again.It seems like he has to urge these young people who scrolling in Weibo to study hard and get to work on time.What my brain thinks while translating Mu Qirong and\u00a0Yan Mu' conversation:Mu Qirong:\u00a0Are you free the night after tomorrow?Yan Mu: The day after tomorrow is Wednesday.Mu Qirong:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Yan Mu:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Mu Qirong:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Yan Mu:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Me: Well, that's awkward\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chengyu slightly frowned and he quickly sends a post in his Weibo. Dude, accept my knee tooo\u201cMore Than One Year: There are golds under a man's knees and there are diamonds under a girl's knees. Don't casually give your knees to others, or you are making things difficult to your knees. Especially fellow men, if you give me your knees, what will you used when you want to propose to your girlfriend later? Everyone, study hard and get to work. Don't play with your knees anymore.\u201d\u201cLululu: The male G.o.d educates people with such a solemn tone, it's really extraordinary ah.\u201d\u201cNine days Nine Fishes: Male G.o.d! Male G.o.d! Please accept my knees too!\u201d\u201cA piece of tofu: Top scholar male G.o.d, you are such a serious person. Do your colleagues in the company know that?\u201d\u201cLove is blind:read this and you guys are reading fake chapter, my condolence\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and stopped reading these messages. He switched to other pages in Weibo and scroll on funny posts. While doing that, he checked some comments on the discussion of Huading electronic products by netizens on the Internet, so that he can understand better the psychology of young customers.After reading all kinds of comments, Lu Chengyu suddenly realized that \u300aSoaring Birds\u300bdid not cooperate with any advertis.e.m.e.nt sponsors and the filming was shot solely using his own private funds. If he can shoot Huading's products and the newly developed high-level residential areas, it will be good propaganda for Huading. He might be able to ask Yan Mu to help him with the theatre chain later on.Chengyu knows what kind of sensation the film will cause after it is released, so he won't give up the chance to publicize Huading, but this matter can only be decided after discussing with Yan Mu.On Thursday, after work, Lu Chengyu went to meet with Yan Mu, who wasn't so busy during that time, to discuss his plan.Yan Mu, after listening to Lu Chengyu's words, meditated for a while and said, \u201cWhat do you mean by using soft sell [1] to advertise Huading into the film?\u201d It's not like Huading hasn't tried to advertise in other TV dramas or movies, but the effect was mediocre.[1] soft sell: sales approach that features subtle language and a non-aggressive technique, designed to avoid angering potential customers and pushing them away.\u201cYes,\u201d Lu Chengyu understands what Yan Mu try to hint him, Chengyu said, \u201cAlthough this is a small budget film, my intuition tells me that this film will be popular. If Huading's products are in this film, this will be a good channel for publicity.\u201dYan Mu knows that nowadays, informatization is a critical thing and propaganda is also an important part of the company's products. In recent years, many companies spend more and more money on propaganda because everyone knows that good publicity can impact on sales revenue. But even though they invest a lot of money towards advertising, the effect is not necessarily good.There are too many advertis.e.m.e.nts nowadays, and because of the pressure in life, people's patience is getting worse and worse. So when they are watching TV, they get very impatient to sit through the advertis.e.m.e.nts and they would change the channels.Therefore, placing advertis.e.m.e.nts in TV movies, or in the name of certain variety shows, is quite acceptable to people, and also at the same time able to increase their popularity.Perhaps because of his trust in Lu Chengyu, Yan Mu felt that the film might really able to increase Huading's fame, so he said: \u201cWell, the cost of advertising for this movie\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, this is a movie that my friends and me shooting for fun. It's our own company, and why are we talking about the advertising fee?\u201d Lu Chengyu waved his hand, \u201cI'll call Director Zhang later and discuss on how to add the advertis.e.m.e.nt.\u201d Then he raised his head and saw Yan Mu, who had always been serious, showed a smile, and Chengyu somewhat unable to react to it. What did he say that made Yan Mu so happy like this?\u201cBoss?\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu doubtfully and waited for Yan Mu to look up at him, \u201cIs there any work I need to do? If it's all right, I'll go out first.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Yan Mu nodded, and the smile on his face had disappeared.Lu Chengyu doesn't care either. Before turning around and reaching the door, Yan Mu stopped him. He looked back and saw that Yan Mu was holding two palm-sized boxes in his hand.\u201cI heard from Jingshen that you like tea. Take this.\u201d Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu that still standing straight, Yan Mu adds, \u201cThis tea is from home given by my friends. I can't drink so much. So, you can help me with this tea.\u201dLu Chengyu takes it from Yan Mu's hand and shake the box of tea, Chengyu smiling and said: \u201cThank you, boss.\u201dChengyu glanced at the box of tea's name, West Lake Longjing Tea[2], this is a good thing ah. Summer is the best time to drink this kind of tea.[2]I'm getting tired to do all these,can u just read at shunraiki?Looking at Lu Chengyu coming out of the office with a smile, Yan Mu's face unconsciously softened a bit. He turned over the doc.u.ments in his hand and realized that he was somewhat distracted. After taking a few deep breaths, Yan Mu slowly returned to normal.As soon as Lu Chengyu returned to his office, he couldn't wait to open the box of tea and smell the fragrant tea. He turned his head and looked at the tea bag which was worth only three yuan lying in his cup. Without hesitation, he fed the tea to the flowers on the balcony and replaced it with the tea given by Yan Mu.Holding the newly brewed tea, Lu Chengyu sat in his office chair and slowly dialled Director Zhang's telephone. Then he talked with Director Zhang about adding Huading's advertis.e.m.e.nt in the movie.As a director, in fact, he did not like to add too many advertis.e.m.e.nts to his works, but Zhang heard that Lu Chengyu talked about it with a tone of consultation with him. Chengyu also emphasizes that the quality of the film is the most important thing, if it is absolutely not good to add advertis.e.m.e.nt, then it is alright not to include it.At first, Zhang Shuo was slightly embarra.s.sed. After listening to Lu Chengyu's words, he felt that it was not a big deal to include an advertis.e.m.e.nt in the movie. With his cooperation with Qu Lingbei, he could easily do such a small thing. Such a good investor as Mr Lu, he can't make it difficult for the other party, can he? (T/N: Qu Lingbei is the screenwriter for the movie)Hearing Zhang Shuo's affirmative reply, Lu Chengyu hung up the phone with a smile, move his chair and drank a cup of tea slowly. He hummed a few songs, turned on his computer and began to process some doc.u.ments from various departments. As an a.s.sistant, there are some less important doc.u.ments he needs to manage in order to help the president. If everything needs to be done by the boss himself, it will be exhausting and endless.However, Yan Mu's trust in him has exceeded his expectations. Has this man never suspected that he might be a commercial spy?Aware that his mind flying quite far, the corner of Lu Chengyu's mouth hooked up. If he was in Yan Mu's position, before letting someone to be in an important position, he would check that person's background first.Thursday has already pa.s.sed and soon it will be Friday. Basically, on this day, employees who can take weekends off will feel better, but Lu Chengyu's mood is not so good because he received phone calls from several relatives of Lu's family. These were his uncles and aunts. Although they seldom contacted each other regularly, the day before Lu Dong was going to get married, these people finally remembered their nephew.Apart from Lu Dong's mother, his aunt called Chengyu to invite him to the wedding. The second uncle and the second aunt ask him on how much he prepared to give for the gift money. They also wanted to ask him about his current job and tell him how much their son or daughter earned each month.Lu Chengyu sighed after receiving the phone calls from these relatives. In his previous life, since the death of his parents, he had little contact with these relatives. Perhaps his relatives also thought that after he graduates from college, his life had been a bit disgraceful. They seldom contacted him or even talked about their nephew in front of outsiders. He also did not want to go to his apathetic relatives' home to look for such vague kinship. So he seldom meets them and his affection became even weaker.When his parents died unexpectedly, besides the apartment lives he now, he still had an old house and deposit money, plus the accident compensation, which was enough to make many people red-eyed. At that time, his friends at the university worried that his relatives would make a living out of that money. But it turns out that relatives on both sides of the parents are kind enough. No one has ever calculated against him, but they are not enthusiastic about him. They are just being polite to him on the surface.When he sold his old house for a sum of money, n.o.body cares about it. If it hadn't been for his restaurant which gone wrong and let Chengyu lost a lot of money, he would have been a small, well-off man. When Chengyu died in his previous life, he doesn't know who gets his money in the bank and his apartment.No matter how he was in his previous life, the Chengyu right now is not embarra.s.sed or awkward to answers the calls from his relatives, he just a bit uninterested.\u201ca.s.sistant Lu, here are the datasheets you want,\u201d The a.s.sistant secretary knocked on the door and paused for a few seconds before she pushing the door and went in the room. She regretted her action of sending out a post on Weibo concerning Lu Chengyu before, which arouse people's concern towards Chengyu. Thus, when she's facing Lu Chengyu now, she felt ashamed of herself and have a guilty conscience.\u201cTroubling you,\u201d Chengyu took the datasheets and smile at her. Looking at her shy and embarra.s.sed expression, Chengyu asked, \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\u201ca.s.sistant Lu, I'm here to apologize to you.\u201d Li Tong now regrets her actions of the past two days. Even though she admires Lu Chengyu's ability to work, she should not send his real-life events to Weibo. Fortunately, this is just a joke, which does not cause any trouble to a.s.sistant Lu, but what if because of her post, a.s.sistant Lu's life was affected, how will this matter end?When she woke up yesterday morning, she felt a bit regretful but because she didn't have the courage to apologize, she deleted both posts on Weibo.But now that a.s.sistant Lu is being so polite and courteous to her, she feels even more shameless to look at him, \u201cI sent two posts in Weibo the day before yesterday, and I didn't expect it will cause many people to leave messages and comments on your Weibo. I won't do this mindless thing again. I'm really sorry.\u201dLu Chengyu was stunned for a moment before he laughed and said, \u201cIt's all right. The hype on the Internet from two days ago has already ended .\u201d He paused and said, \u201cThe best thing is you can understand what you did wrong. Knowing your own mistakes can help you to improve yourself. Don't make such mistakes in the future.\u201d After saying that, Chengyu was worried if the little a.s.sistant's feeling sad, so he comforted her, \u201cNever mind, go ahead, I'm not angry.\u201d Although he does not like this kind of thing, he still appreciated the att.i.tude of the other party. (T/N: this kind of thing refers to when she post about him on Weibo)Chengyu has met many types of different people in his previous life. There were some people who make mistakes and they even make bogus accusation towards the victim. Li Tong was able to admit her mistake and apologize just means that this young girl has no moral problems. Cao Jingshen has a good a.s.sistant.Li Tong was somewhat muddleheaded when she went out of the a.s.sistant room. When she recalled the gentle words from a.s.sistant Lu, she can't help rubbing her slightly red cheeks. She will never do this kind of stupid thing, and a.s.sistant Lu is really a real male G.o.d ah!The way he smiled just now almost make she scream out \u2018Handsome!'Outside the president's office, Yan Mu looked at Li Tong's back when she was standing in front of the elevator and he turns his sight to look at the closed door of the a.s.sistant room. After hesitating for a moment, Yan Mu casually walked by the a.s.sistant's office. Through the unsealed shutters, he saw Lu Chengyu holding a cup and looks carefully at a doc.u.ment on the table.Yan Mu slowly slowed his footsteps. He frowns and starts to think, why is it he thinks that looking at a.s.sistant Lu's earnest appearance\u2026\u2026.makes ones feel comfortable?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySorry for the late release (like seriously late~) My real life is quite busy that I sometimes sleep like 3 hours per day, or skip sleep altogether. Here is the next chapter that I squeeze all my life essence time\u00a0to translate for weeks, so if you guys find something weird, like the name or something, just write it in the comment, my brain stops functioning by now.[][][Next]Chapter 21: Nouveau RicheWhen Lu Chengyu drove to the hotel, the parking s.p.a.ce was almost full. He drove his little Benteng around and find a parking s.p.a.ce in the corner.After straightening his coat, Lu Chengyu got out of the car, closed the door and entered the hotel lobby. The hotel is well-known throughout the capital. It is the usual place to holds a wedding banquet here. It takes at least half a year before to book this place.As soon as he entered the lobby, he can see that there is a desk for receiving gifts on both sides. It seems to be a separate gift for both men and women. Visually, the number of bride side's guests is significantly higher than the bridegroom side's guests.The bride has a good family background and knows many people. This situation really makes the bridegroom side's looks desolated.[T/N: In China, usually they separate the guest from the bride and the bridegroom, so here, they can see clearly that the guest from bridegroom is less than the bride.]Read at shunraikitranslation please. I'm not gonna be mad at youLu Dong and Shen Min are talking to a middle-aged couple wearing very expensive clothes. So, Chengyu didn't bother them, he went straight inside and give the gift money.Lu Chengyu's uncle and aunt are greeting guests. When they see Lu Chengyu coming, they greet him with a smile.\u201cCheng Yu is here,\u201d the uncle laughed and took two steps forward. He looked at him and saw that he was dressed up very well. He said, \u201cI haven't seen you for a long time, and you didn't come to our house.\u201d\u201cI just graduated, so this is the time when I need to work hard. I usually have less time to rest and sleep. When my work is stable, I will come to your house.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled at Lu Yongguo. How Chengyu couldn't see that the smile on his uncle's face more to politeness than intimacy. In this kind of family relationship, it is better to distance himself(LCY) from it rather than being intimate.Lu Chengyu took out the monetary gift that he had been prepared and gave it to his aunt, Lu Suyun, who is responsible to receive the gift and his second uncle Lu Chang Jun, who is responsible to register the monetary gift. When both of them saw the amount of the monetary gift, their complexion's change.Lu Suyun jokingly speak out: \u201cCheng Yu, how's your work? How much is your salary?\u201d This gift is quite generous among ordinary people.\u201cI work in the city and my boss is a good person. Also, my salary is quite appropriate, just a little busy.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and answered two questions. He looks at the time and it was 11:40. It seemed that the banquet was about to start.Lu Suyun realizes that Lu Chengyu did not want to talk about his work in detail. Although she sighed that this nephew was estranged from her, she did not continue to ask him questions. She just greeted Lu Chengyu with a gentle att.i.tude and asked him to go to the second floor where the banquet is being held.After saying a few casual polite remarks with several elders, Lu Chengyu went up to the second floor. Earlier, he drove all the way over without washing his hands, when he thought about having dinner later, Chengyu turned around and went to the bathroom.As soon as he reached the door of the bathroom, he heard the second uncle's son, Lu Liang, is talking to the aunt's son, Sun Junyi, inside the bathroom.\u201cThis morning, when we accompany Dong ge to meet the bride, why didn't ask Chengyu to come along with us? If Chengyu is there, the bride's best friends will unlikely to make things difficult, we don't need to wait for a long time for them to open the door.\u201d (T/N: ge: brother)\u201cAuntie didn't tell you, the eldest aunt was afraid of Chengyu's fortune will influence the newcomers. Therefore, they inform Chengyu to come to the wedding ceremony and as for welcoming newlywed, they didn't mention it to him.\u201d(T/N: in a Chinese wedding ceremony, the groom will decorate the car and went to the bride's home to fetch the bride, then they need to pa.s.s the block by the bridesmaids (by getting their consent, not kidnap the bride), after succeeding, he will take the bride to the wedding hall.)\u201cHow awkward it would be if Cheng Yu knew about it,\u201d Sun Junyi said dryly, with a lower voice. \u201cBesides, Cheng Yu has good grades, looks handsome, and his job hunting went smoothly. Is there anything wrong with him?\u201d\u201cThird uncle and third aunt\u2026\u201d Lu Liang cough dryly, suddenly he thinks that it is not appropriate to speak more about this topic, \u201cForget it, just pretend that we don't know this matter and let's not tell Chengyu about it.\u201dLu Chengyu stood outside the bathroom, silently retreat back a few steps. After that, he makes heavier footsteps and entered the bathroom as if he had just walked around the corner.When Sun Junyi and Lu Liang heard the footsteps, they stop talking to each other. When they saw it was Lu Chengyu, whom they had just talked about, both of their expressions were somewhat unnatural.\u201cChengyu, when did you arrive? We were just saying that you were going to be late,\u201d said Lu Liang while wiping his hand and squeeze out a smile, \u201cOnce several of our brothers sit together, let's have a good drink.\u201dLu Chengyu washes his hand and said: \u201cLiang ge is a good drinker. Better not to include me to drink wine together. Spare me, if when the newlyweds giving a toast but I've already drunk, how embarra.s.sed it is.\u201d Chengyu went to the hand dryer to dry his hand, sighed, \u201cI've been busy planning these days. I didn't go to bed until midnight last night. Fortunately, the traffic jam is not serious today, so I didn't miss the wedding ceremony.\u201dWhen Lu Liang and Sun Junyi heard the word \u2018planning', both of them can guess that Chengyu was able to mix well in the company, or else, how could someone who just enter the company able to touch this thing? With this in mind, the expression on both men was a lot gentler.Sun Junyi saw the natural expression on Chengyu's face, he was relieved. It seemed that his cousin had not heard what they had just said.He went up and grabbed Lu Chengyu's shoulder and said, \u201cWho believes you can't drink? Don't say anything, we'll all drink together later, and you can't run away from us.\u201dLu Chengyu smile and he easily turn his hand to the back and make a punching gesture towards Sun Junyi's shoulder. These three brothers went out from the bathroom with a smile on their face, looking like they were good brothers to each other.After the three left, a closed toilet compartment door opened. Cao Jingshen frowned and walked out. He came to attend his cousin's wedding. He didn't realize that Lu Chengyu was a relative of the groom, and what they had just said\u2026There are some people who are particularly superst.i.tious will avoid doing any taboo things, but this is too obvious. Whether or not Lu Chengyu had just heard it, he felt that with Lu Chengyu's EQ, he could perceive alienation and discomfiture.Sighed, it's hard to speak of matters between the relatives.Nevertheless, Cao Jingshen really hates Chengyu, so for him, it's a win-win situation.When the banquet begins, Lu Chengyu listens to MC on stage, stirring up the emotions of the audience, getting them to laugh. Chengyu stroke his somewhat hungry belly, this morning, he forgot to take his breakfast. He looks at the table where there are tobacco and sugar were placed, he feels even hungrier.After a while, they began to serve the dishes. Lu Chengyu did not have the habit of drinking on an empty stomach, he fills his stomach with several mouthfuls of food and starts to cope with toasts given by his cousins from both sides of his parents.Although Lu Chengyu eats several dishes to pad his stomach in between the toasts, confronting the berserk toast mode, he finally began to get dizzy. By the time the newlyweds came to toast, the people at the table were getting a little drunk and already in a confused state. On the contrary, Lu Chengyu is a more presentable person among these people on the table. Facing the newlyweds' propose for a toast, he rashly works his half-drunk brain to think a few words of blessings to the newlyweds, didn't let the mood becomes awkward.The newlyweds were followed by their parents, who introduced their relatives' ident.i.ty, looks embarra.s.sed. After a quick toast to the table, they went to another table. (T/N: the one look embarra.s.sed is both of the parents)After the banquet, Lu Chengyu shook his dizzy head and watched his cousins at the same table being supported by aunts and uncles. After he sobers up, Chengyu stood up and walked slowly towards the door to go outside. As soon as he reached the lobby downstairs, he heard someone calling himself. When he looks back, he saw Cao Jingshen striding towards him.\u201cYou drink?\u201d Cao Jingshen walked up to him and smelled the alcohol on Chengyu. \u201cI'll take you back.\u201dLu Chengyu did not refuse, and he gave Cao Jingshen his car keys. \u201cThen, ask someone to help me drive my car back to my home.\u201d\u201cYou still drink although you know that you need to drive? Did no one's teach you that you can't drink if you are driving?\u201d Cao Jingshen pushed his gla.s.ses and said, \u201cYou might as well just get drunk and forget all about it.\u201d When Cao Jingshen remembered the conversation he heard before in the bathroom, his mood was somewhat complicated. Lu Chengyu is really graceful. If he encounters this kind of thing, he may turn around and leave, ignoring the embarra.s.sment of others.It is reasonable to say that, people like Lu Chengyu doesn't seem like returning his grievances with virtue [1], but it seems to Chengyu, it was like nothing important had happened.[1] \u4ee5\u5fb7\u62a5\u6028 [y\u01d0d\u00e9b\u00e0oyu\u00e0n]: to return good for evil (idiom) / to requite evil with goodOr is it that because Lu's family has always had such an att.i.tude, Lu Chengyu has been used to it, so he doesn't care about these people at all?\u201cIf you're drunk, are you going to carry me back?\u201d Lu Chengyu glanced at Cao Jingshen. \u201cI'm afraid you can't carry me.\u201d\u201cI noticed that when you drunk, your mouth becomes really cheap,\u201d Cao Jingshen dragged Lu Chengyu to the sofa on the lobby. \u201cDid the dogs eat your usual elegance?\u201dLu Chengyu looked at him and did not speak, but he proved that he was still an elegant, handsome young man with his sitting posture, even attracting the attention of the woman who walks by.Cao Jingshen was trying to keep talking, but he heard the phone ringing and the screen showed that the caller was Yan Mu. He had to answer the phone first and let go of Lu Chengyu.Lu Chengyu fall down on the floor and start screaming, Jingshen frowned his headLu Yongguo was receiving guests at the door when he saw Lu Chengyu sitting and talking with a man in a suit. He couldn't help looking at his son Lu Dong: \u201cWho is that man, your friend?\u201dLu Dong turned his head and recognized at a glance who was talking to Lu Chengyu. Isn't that Xiao Min's fierce cousin, Cao Jingshen. How did Chengyu know him?\u201cHe's Xiao Min's cousin. I heard he's the chief secretary of Huading. He's a very powerful person,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cEven Xiao Min's family is polite to him.\u201d (T/N: Xiao Min is the bride, Shen Min)Lu Yongguo does not understand, \u201cIsn't my daughter-in-law's family has their own company? Why need to be polite to a chief secretary?\u201dLu Dong was too lazy to explain the differences in workplaces to his father. He thought and said, \u201cDid Chengyu had told you where he works now?\u201d\u201cUsually, how much times do we spend to stay in touch with him,\u201d said Lu Yongguo while looking at Lu Chengyu for several times, \u201cIf we keep in touch with him too much, then what should we do when others say that we are actually concern about the dead peoples' things (Chengyu's parents' property, insurance etc),\u201d Although the property indeed stir up some emotion in his hearts, Lu Chengyu has not only one elder. When other elders are watching, although there are some people who wanted to covet Chengyu's property, they didn't do it because they want to save their face, it will be shameful to do this kind of things.Lu Dong frown but when he saw Shen Min coming towards himself, he stopped talking about it.When Shen Min came to Lu Dong, she saw Lu Chengyu sitting with Cao Jingshen, but she was not surprised at all. Perhaps subconsciously, she has labelled Lu Chengyu as \u201cvery competent\u201d, so it's normal for them to know each other.Cao Jingshen hung up the phone and looked at Lu Chengyu, who was still sitting there. \u201cThe boss is nearby. He will send you back. I have something to do in the afternoon.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Lu Chengyu rubbed his forehead, just now while he was in a trance, he seems to hear Cao Jingshen mention Yan Lao San. Apparently, the boss wants to settle accounts of this matter. But because of the relationship between Yan Mu and Yan Lao San, this matter will personally be handled by Cao Jingshen.Seeing him like this, Cao Jingshen put his cell phone in his pocket, \u201cI'll have your car driven back for you, and remember to go downstairs and pick up your keys.\u201dLu Chengyu continued to nod his head and thank Cao Jingshen. His honest appearance left Cao Jingshen unable to get mad with him, but he couldn't hold his breath. For him, Lu Chengyu is half of his apprentices in the workplace. When he sees that Chenyu is drunk and he doesn't say a word, Cao Jingshen feels that something was wrong in his heart. (T/N: Jingshen wants to nag to Chengyu because he is somewhat his(Jingshen)'s apprentices, but looking at Chengyu's honest appearance, he didn't want to do it, but somewhere in his mind, he feels like he should say a word or two, that's why his heart feel something wrong).In less than fifteen minutes, Cao Jingshen saw Yan Mu coming in from the gate, and his face looked very serious. When he saw them, he strode over with big strides.Before Cao Jingshen opened his mouth, he saw Yan Mu pull out a bottle of sobering medicine from his suit trousers bag, insert a straw and handed it to Lu Chengyu.\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu's expression twisted for several seconds after he finished drinking. He looked up at Yan Mu and smiled awkwardly. \u201cI'm bothering boss again.\u201d\u201cLung injury caused by smoking cigarette, liver injury due to alcohol poisoning, be moderate,\u201d Yan Mu saw that he had finished drinking. He took the empty bottle and threw it into the garbage can beside him. \u201cGo, my car just parked outside the door.\u201d\u201cIs okay to park at the entrance of the hotel? Wouldn't the security guard come out?\u201d Lu Chengyu stood up and thought it would be better to get on the car earlier. In case the security guards came, it is humiliating.\u201cIt's not okay, but I'm the boss.\u201d Yan Mu went to the door and found some people standing at the door looking at Lu Chengyu. He frowned while opening the door, \u201cDo you know these people?\u201dHearing Yan Mu was the owner of this hotel, Lu Chengyu seemed quite calm. Nouveau riche does have a lot of a.s.sets that Chengyu wasn't surprised after knowing this, which is why he was calm. Chengyu has no doubt that maybe one day Yan Mu, like a man in love stories, would casually buy an island. Because the world of wealthy people doesn't have logic.Seeing the 50 million Aston Martin that Yanmu drive today, Chengyu looks back at his relatives and he pretended to be very drunk. Then, he lay on Yan Mu's shoulder: \u201cWell, yes.\u201d He didn't want to be questioned about personal matters anymore. He felt he had to take the best course.Yan Mu's shoulders were slightly stiff. After a moment of stunned, he reached out to hold Lu Chengyu and help him by bringing him to the front pa.s.senger seat. He fastened Chengyu's seat belt for him. After closing the door, he stepped on the accelerator and the others were looking at the nouveau riche(Yan Mu) as he left.The relatives of Lu\u00a0Jia who knew the value of Aston Martin's sports car were in a complicated mood for a while. Originally, Chengyu was able to study at a prestigious university. After he graduates, he knew a man who wasn't so simple, a person without parents like Chengyu's life is so good? (Jia = family)Lu Dong looked at the direction in which the Aston Martin sports car disappeared and suddenly felt a little dull.[][][Next]Translator rambling section:Is it normal to ask someone's salary?

    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator: ShunraikiEditor: NaedaChapter 22: This is not \u2018love'?Because Yan Mu's mobile phone had rung several times, he was forced to park the car by the side of the road. When he brought the car to a stop, he took out the wireless headphones and finally answered the persistent phone call.\"f.u.c.k, Mu ge, why didn't you call when you said you were going to call?\" Zhuang Yu's voice blasted through the speakers, his tone was quite angry.\"Sorry, I had something to do. You guys just go to the afternoon party without me,\" Yan Mu said. He glanced at the Lu Chengyu beside him. \"I'll treat you tomorrow.\"\"Alright.\" Zhuang Yu knew that Yan Mu had something to settle with Yan Jia. Normally, Yan Mu was not the type of person to leave without saying anything in advance. \"Okay, I'll tell them. You take care of yourself.\"\"Thank you.\" Yan Mu hung up the phone, frowning. What happened to him today? He left early without telling his friends; he stopped at the door regardless of the hotel rules. This was not in line with his usual style. These disrespectful acts violated his years' worth of education.Although Lu Chengyu was half drunk, he was still able to tell that there was something wrong with Yan Mu's expression, so he shifted his gaze away quietly. Sometimes, a person had to know when not to ask questions.The car gradually moved along. Lu Chengyu leaned back on his comfortable chair and listened to the soothing sound of Guqin music. Slowly, he fell asleep.Taking advantage of when the lights turned red, Yan Mu covered Lu Chengyu with his suit coat. This was the second time he had to send the drunk Lu Chengyu home.As a boss, he knew that his concern for Lu Chengyu was exceeding the emotional line between a supervisor to his staff. As the lights turned green, he started the car and drove steadily forward. Maybe, there were some things he should think about seriously.When the car entered the community, Yan Mu half-hugged Lu Chengyu back to his apartment.After settling the man into the **, Yan Mu half squatted down, taking off the other party's shoes. He put the door keys on the bedside cabinet, opened the window, and silently looked at the sleeping Lu Chengyu.The first time he saw Lu Chengyu's interview resume, Yan Mu had thought that he might be a very energetic young man. Who would've known that he would happen to meet the real person at Baiweixuan the next day and, by chance, also pick up the younger man's wallet. If Yan Mu hadn't walked fast enough, Chengyu's wallet would've been picked up by another person.At that time, Lu Chengyu had turned around and said 'thank you' with a smile adorning his face. For some reason, Yan Mu recalled the clean and smooth white shirt Chengyu had wore. It made the people who look at it want to move closer, but at the same time, also reluctant to reach out to touch for the fear of wrinkling and dirtying the pure shirt.After a long time in his thoughts, Yan Mu suddenly frowned. His friends had said that he was dull and boring. Does Lu Chengyu, a man who never lacked attention in the company, think so, too?Walking out of the master bedroom, Yan Mu went to the kitchen and found that the mung beans he had bought were still in the refrigerator. Seeing that the bag of mung beans had not moved, he knew that Lu Chengyu seldom cook for himself.He placed the mung beans in the bowl to soak them. Then, he circled around the room and found that the garbage bin was almost overflowing with trash. It was full of snack packages and peels, as well as wrappers for instant bread. There wasn't that much garbage when he was here the last time.Bending over to collect all the garbage, Yan Mu turned back to the room, took away the key, and carried the trash out of the door.Xiao He was hired as the CEO's driver, but because Yan Mu often liked to drive by himself, he usually did odd jobs in the company. Due to his honesty and diligence, his wages increased by 5% during this period.However, right now, this honest, diligent young man felt that there was something wrong with his eyes.He had just parked a.s.sistant Lu's car and was ready to take the keys upstairs. As a result, he saw his boss coming out with several garbage bags, the garbage bags in which were incompatible with his elegant clothing.Poor Xiao He was stunned for several seconds before he ran toward Yan Mu, reaching for the bulging trash bags in his boss's hands. \"Boss, why are you here? Let me carry these.\"\"No need,\" said Yan Mu, avoiding Xiao He's hands. \"I'll hold it. Are you here to deliver the car keys to a.s.sistant Lu?\"Xiao He nodded. When he saw that the boss really didn't need his help, Xiao He just scratched his head and smiled. \"I've parked the car, but when I called a.s.sistant Lu's phone just now, n.o.body answered. So, I decided to go upstairs to give him the car keys.\"\"No, just give me the keys.\" Yan Mu took the keys from Xiao He's hand and let him go back.On his way home, Xiao He thought of a couple reasons why his big boss suddenly appeared downstairs of a.s.sistant Lu's apartment. Using his own knowledge and self-awareness, the most logical reason for his boss' appearance was that he had property here in this neighbourhood; the most illogical reason was that the boss was helping a.s.sistant Lu clean his room.Although the boss was good, he was not good enough to help his subordinates clean their rooms. Even if Xiao He put this on the internet, he bet that no one would believe him. He felt that he was thinking too much, and, as a driver, one thing he had to do was hold his tongue. So, this matter was secured tightly in his heart.Yan Mu didn't care about what Xiao He thought. After he threw away the garbage, he went to the nearby supermarket to buy fruits and vegetables. When he came back to Lu Chengyu's apartment, the young man was still sleeping.After Yan Mu handled the ingredients, he threw them in a pot to cook slowly over a mild fire. Yan Mu knew that there was a study room in Chengyu's apartment, but it was too impolite to enter without the owner's consent. In the end, he decided to sit on the sofa and turn on the TV to kill time.\"You say you don't love her, but you always look at her, pay close attention to her, even going as far as to ignore your ident.i.ty and do things you normally won't do for her. If you're saying that you don't love her, are you lying to me or fooling yourself?\"Yan Mu, who had originally wanted to change the station to the news channel, suddenly stopped his movement. He stared at the grieving woman crying and shouting at the man in the television, his eyebrows tightly furrowing. In the end, he took out his cell phone and dialled his friend's number.Zhuang Yu was playing tennis with his friends. When the bodyguard brought his mobile phone into the court, he wiped his sweat and took the phone. Seeing that it was Yan Mu calling, he immediately laughed. \"What is it, Mu ge? Do you have time to come and play now?\"After Zhuang Yu heard the following unexpected remarks from Yan Mu, his expression became strange. \"You've done that much for this person, but you don't know why?\"There was silence from the other end of the line. Sighing helplessly, Zhuang Yu said, \"Congratulations Mu ge, your spring is here. What kind of beauty can make a person like Mu ge bow down? Bring that person over tonight\u2026\" Before Zhuang Yu could finish his sentence, he heard a beep coming from his phone. Did Yan Mu just hang up on him?!\"He's a 28 years old man yet still so shy,\" Zhuang Yu threw his cell phone to his bodyguard. \"Even people like Mu ge have someone to pursue. Aren't I pitiful?\"\"Sir, you broke up with Miss Yang two days ago,\" the bodyguard said in a flat tone. He caught Zhuang Yu's phone. \"Miss Yang also said that she never wants to see you again.\"\"As a bodyguard, you have excellent skills and brains; but for an employer, you can be quite annoying.\" Zhuang Yu frowned at his bodyguard.The bodyguard was silent for a long time, but finally, he stood up to the pressure and said, \"If a bodyguard doesn't have a brain, he isn't suitable for this line of work. Nowadays, work isn't easy.\" A few days ago, he heard a brother, who had worked for Master Yan San, said that because he rushed to the door on impulse, he was beaten and thrown to the wall in one blow by a gentle-looking young man. The brother had then change his job, now selling kebabs at the night market.Zhuang Yu glanced at his bodyguard. Movies with powerful bodyguards dressed in black were f.u.c.king deceptive because, in reality, none of the bodyguards he hired were reliable.When Lu Chengyu woke up, he could tell that it was already evening from the turned on lights in his room. He smelled the aroma drifting from outside the door and swallowed his saliva. After changing out of his alcohol-stained clothes, Chengyu went to the living room and saw Yan Mu sitting on the sofa watching a movie. Even though he was sitting on an ordinary sofa, the man's back was as straight as a ruler, and he exuded an indescribable aura from head to toe.Chengyu touched his chin. Don't tell me, is this the legendary exquisite threatening aura?\"Awake?\" Seeing Chengyu walk out of his room, Yan Mu wanted to give the younger man a smile. The corner of his lips, however, only quirked up by a little. Suddenly, he stood up and paced quickly into the kitchen, bringing out the mung bean porridge [1] and pork foot soup [2] he had already cooked that morning.[1][2]Lu Chengyu looked doubtfully at the kitchen door. Was it just him or was the boss walking with both his hands and feet swinging in the same direction? Is my mind not sober yet because I just woke up? [T/N: walking with same hand and feet: Yan Mu swing his left hand and leg at the same time, like the kind of nervous type of walking]Just when Chengyu was about to head into the kitchen to help, Yan Mu came out with the dishes in his hands. The soup in the insulated bowl was steaming with white smoke. Looking at Yan Mu's expressionless face as the man held two bowls of porridge, Lu Chengyu's lips curled up to a smile. He went to the dining table and said, \"What did you stew, boss?\"After handing Lu Chengyu a spoon and a pair of chopsticks, Yan Mu went back to the kitchen and returned with a plate of pickles and two empty bowls. He placed them on the table. \"You have drunk wine before, so eating these will be good for your stomach.\" He looked at Lu Chengyu but quickly averted his eyes. Holding the soup ladle, Yan Mu added, \"I saw fresh pork feet at the supermarket this afternoon, so I bought some.\"A bowl filled with soup was given to Lu Chengyu. He picked up a spoon and scooped some, blowing on it twice before stuffing it into his mouth. Although the soup was hot, it was tasty. Lu Chengyu nodded eagerly. \"It's delicious. I heard from my friends that when a person whose ten fingers do not touch the sun and spring water [3] go abroad, they will come back with cooking skills. Is that true?\"[3] ten fingers do not touch the sun and spring water: spoiled, a pampered person who does not have to work hard for housework.\"It's not that exaggerated.\" The corner of Yan Mu's lips slightly bend up as he watched Lu Chengyu blow on the soup and stuff it in his mouth. \"But it's true that many people go abroad to learn simple \u25a1\u25a1's cooking by themselves.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded. \"Being away from home is the best exercise to temper one's self, ah,\" he sighed ruefully.When Yan Mu recalled that Lu Chengyu lived in this empty **** house by himself, he squeezed his chopsticks tightly and changed the topic to work.Looking at Lu Chengyu seriously discussing his work while drinking soup, Yan Mu thought that, in fact, talking while eating was not an unacceptable behavior.After dinner, Yan Mu accompanied Lu Chengyu and sat together with him for a while. When he made sure that Chengyu didn't have any discomfort from his excessive drinking last night, Yan Mu stood up and said his farewells.Lu Chengyu tried to persuade Yan Mu to stay, but when the latter refused, he escorted the older man to the elevator. He didn't leave as the elevator doors closed and, instead, watched as the numbers on the elevator's panel descended to the ground level. Only then did he return to his apartment.Opening the refrigerator, Chengyu saw the fresh fruits and vegetables neatly arranged inside and couldn't help laughing. Meeting such a good boss\u2013he would be embarra.s.sed to face this pile of fresh fruits and vegetables if he didn't do a good job to job Yan Mu.Lu Chengyu then took a snow pear from the refrigerator, washed and gnawed it.More than a week later, Lu Chengyu received a call from Director Zhang. They had finished filming\u300aSoaring Birds\u300band were now beginning on the last stage: get approval from above and finish everything within a month.Lu Chengyu hung up the phone and looked at the calendar on his desk. No wonder there were always mooncake advertis.e.m.e.nts on TV recently. It turned out that the Mid-Autumn Festival was coming soon.He drew a circle on a certain date of the calendar. On this happy day, families will celebrate the festival. Wouldn't it be a little more lively if Liang Company's housing problems were to be exposed early?He liked excitement and lively surroundings the most. On behalf of the traditional \u25a1\u25a1 reunion's holiday, how could there be no gossip to liven things up?Translator and Editor rambling section:Naeda: Fl.u.s.tered Yan Mu is honestly my bias.Shunraiki: I just want to know what brand of comforter/blanket Chengyu use. ** didn't help me to get any kind of hint at all\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, due to cost reasons, investors couldn't reduce the prices. In the end, a lot of newly developed residential areas in M County became ghost cities with no living inhabitants. Many investors became trapped.\"The land of M County?\" Lu Chengyu was in the president's office. After listening to Yan Mu's conversation with Cao Jingshen, he hesitated and asked, \"Is it the area near the North District?\"Cao Jingshen nodded doubtfully. He didn't understand why Lu Chengyu asked such a strange question. Looking at Yan Mu, he found that the other was listening attentively. \"What's wrong with the North District?\"\"I heard that M County has a small population. Will other companies investing in real estate there affect the housing market?\" Lu Chengyu arrived at Yan Mu's desk and leaned in front of the computer. He brought out some information and news about M County. \"In these residential areas, those who can afford it don't have the desire to buy houses, while those who with the desires don't have strong enough economic strength to do so.\"\"However, in the next two years, this place would be vigorously developed. Now that the price of M County is low, if we can get some of its land, it will be a rare opportunity,\" Cao Jingshen frowned. \"Our market should not only consider the people of M County but also the foreign investments and migrant workers.\"\"But the development plan would not necessarily be successful. If it fails, the money invested cannot be earned back in a short period of time.\" Lu Chengyu remembered that M County did developed that year, but because the actual operation was too difficult, the plan was held back for a year. At that time, he didn't know how many developers were trapped, but there were a few that even jumped off of buildings. It caused a lot of sensation, triggering some societal reflection of housing markets.After \u25a1\u25a1 years, housing prices tend to stabilize, and there are some places with prices lowered. Therefore, even if M County's real estate can recover after he died in his past life, it would not make much of a profit. On the other hand, if these funds were instead used to invest in other industries, although he didn't know by how much, there would still be more profit.In Lu Chengyu's previous life, he didn't know whether or not Huading had invested in this place. However, he should advise Yan Mu and carry out his responsibilities.Cao Jingshen listened to those words and fell into deep thought. He just thought that the price of land was cheap but didn't think of the development issues. Lu Chengyu's words were like a wake-up call.\"You're not optimistic in M County's market?\" Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu, as if trying to search for something in his expression.\"I'm just giving a suggestion,\" Lu Chengyu shook his head. \"But personally, I really don't like this place very much.\"Yan Mu nodded, then he closed the tender in his hands before handing it to Lu Chengyu. \"I see,\" he paused in thought. \"Tomorrow, I'm going to the bidding meeting in M County. You're coming with me.\"Lu Chengyu looked at the tender and nodded.\"Make a new tender. Although we don't want to win the bid, we still have to go through it.\" Yan Mu agreed with Chengyu and said, \"M County is not really an easy place to develop. What you said is correct.\"Beside him, Cao Jingshen sighed. When he talked about it before, his boss doubted the success of the M County development project. Unexpectedly, Lu Chengyu doubted this, too.These days, he felt that Lu Chengyu was really a one-in-thousand, hard to come by a.s.sistant. No wonder the boss paid more and more attention to him.\"I'm going to book a plane ticket to M County this evening.\" Cao Jingshen withdrew from the office and immediately made a phone call to book the flight tickets and hotel rooms.When Lu Chengyu returned to his office, he changed the tender once more and checked the recent temperature of M County. Besides the sun being quite intense and the weather being quite hot, there was nothing special to pay attention to. So, Chengyu rushed home early in the afternoon, packed his bags, and headed straight to the airport to join Yan Mu and Cao Jingshen.Chengyu also brought a pack of cond*m, in case suddenly Yan Mu wants to make out.After boarding the plane, Lu Chengyu discovered that Cao Jingshen bought business cla.s.s tickets, which were much more comfortable and s.p.a.cious than economy cla.s.s. As soon as he laid down on his cozy seat, he heard Cao Jingshen explaining to Yan Mu, \"This flight only has two cla.s.s options. Although it's not comparable to international flights, it's still good.\"Before he reincarnated, Lu Chengyu was reluctant to buy even an economy cla.s.s ticket. How could he, someone who would rather squeeze in crowded trains if he could save a bit of money, endure this display of wealth?\"En,\" Yan Mu nodded and looked at Lu Chengyu, who was sitting beside him without saying a word. \"If you feel bored later, sleep for a while.\"Lu Chengyu smiled at Yan Mu. \"Okay.\" How could a man like Yan Mu\u2013wealthy, good-looking, great at cooking\u2013not find a wife after nine years? For all my female friends, you are all guilty of this heinous crime: wasting resources.\"I didn't expect to meet Mr. Lu here. It's really fate.\" An annoying voice that was somewhat familiar to Chengyu sounded behind him. As Lu Chengyu looked up, he saw a man he didn't want to meet\u2013Liang family's young master, Liang Deyou.Liang Deyou was followed Chen Jin, who was dressed as an elite, with two bodyguards behind them. Chen Jin apparently saw him too, but looked down and pretended not to see him.\"This is the so-called \u2018though born a thousand li[1] apart, souls that are one shall meet [2]'. Mr. Liang was able to fly in the same plane with me at a height of thousands of miles. Indeed, we really have a lifetime predestined relationship.\" Lu Chengyu smiled at Liang Deyou, \"It's a surprise, ah.\"[1] Li: a unit of measurement in China that is equal to about a third of a mile, or about 547 yards or 500 meters.[2] \u6709\u7f18\u5343\u91cc\u6765\u76f8\u4f1a [y\u01d2u yu\u00e1n qi\u0101n l\u01d0 l\u00e1i xi\u0101ng hu\u00ec]: Describe two people who were fated, no matter how far apart they will meet.Liang Deyou was disgusted by Lu Chengyu's happy-because-we're-thousands-of-li-apart-but-still-able-to-meet expression. He turned around and sat with Chen Jin on the other side of the aisle, then said to Lu Chengyu, \"I heard that Mr. Lu is a person from this city and rarely travel out of town. Is Mr. Lu not use to being on a plane?\"\"It's not that bad.\" Lu Chengyu heard that the other side was trying to ridicule him for not being on a flight before. Instead of getting angry, he smiled, \"I can't open the window, it's quite stuffy.\"Liang Deyou sneered. He felt that the man before his eyes was unbearably vulgar. How did Chen Jin like him before? And who was the man sitting with Lu Chengyu? His eyes didn't seem that friendly.Liang Deyou didn't remember Yan Mu, but Chen Jin still had an impression on him, recognizing him as the man with Lu Chengyu during graduation day. He didn't know why, but subconsciously, he didn't like this seemingly difficult person. Maybe it was because of the other's momentum?Yan Mu glanced at them and pursed his lips. Remembering Liang Deyou's mockery of Lu Chengyu just now, he felt embarra.s.sed because the former heard what he said moments before about Lu Chengyu's first time flying on a plane. It was as if Liang Deyou was ridiculing him.\"Why don't you just say that when the plane takes off, you will open the window and touch the clouds?\"Chen Jin found that it was the man with gla.s.ses, who was sitting in front of Lu Chengyu, that spoke in such a joking tone. It seemed that this man was familiar with Lu Chengyu.\"Although I'm just a fresh graduate with little social experience, don't lie to me. Can we see clouds at night?\" Lu Chengyu pulled up the sleeve of his white shirt and looked at Cao Jingshen with an innocent expression, deliberately making a strange remark, \"Furthermore, it seems that the wind outside the plane is strong. Can you open the window?\"Cao Jingshen pushed up his gla.s.ses and, with a serious expression, said, \"Quickly go to sleep. You can do it after you fall asleep.\"Lu Chengyu raised his mouth and revealed eight neat white teeth to Cao Jingshen, \"Ha ha.\"[T/N: okay if you guys don't understand the sarcasm level of both Chengyu and Jingshen, here is the explanation. [if you guys can understand it, feel free to skip this explanation.] Chengyu said about open the window is to be sarcastic to Deyou as Deyou said this is the first time Chengyu on a plane, does he know anything about flying? he doesn't, right? Chengyu is a noob regarding flying on a plane. so Chengyu try to be as noob as he can by sarcastically said that he can't open the window although its stuffy here, but then jingshen is being more sarcastic by saying, why don't you just say that you can open the window and touch the cloud, that's more amateur and noob for the first-time-flight-pa.s.senger-remarks.]Jingshen is trying to help Chengyu but didn't he know, Yan Mu was mad at him.Looking at the scene in silence, Chen Jin's mood was somewhat complicated. It seemed that Lu Chengyu easily got along with everyone, and they even liked him. No wonder Chengyu looked down upon people like himself.Liang Deyou tilted his head and saw the heavy expression on Chen Jin's face.Yan Mu turned his head and looked at Liang Deyou, then he silently moved his sight away. Compared to his father, this Liang's young master was too far behind.The old Liang family patriarch now wanted to retire and pa.s.s on the company to his heir. This decision would probably be the greatest evidence of him being unable to make sound decisions in his old age despite his long record of having keen insight.As the plane took off smoothly, it was already dinner time. Flight attendants began to distribute drinks, fruits, and dinner to the pa.s.sengers. Lu Chengyu didn't like the western style, so he chose traditional Chinese food. When Chengyu was halfway through his meal, the plane encountered turbulence and shook violently. Chengyu immediately reached for the drink cups and steadied it. After confirming that the drinks didn't spill, Chengyu relaxed his breathing.Yan Mu noticed his actions, so when Chengyu finished drinking, he rang the bell to call for the flight attendant to give Lu Chengyu another cup.The latter looked at the gla.s.s full of orange juice in front of him. \"\u2026\" He just didn't want to waste juice.Both of them plan to do \u2018orange-juice-spill-play' later on because of what happen today.After getting off the plane, the people in charge of receiving them in M County took them to the hotel they had booked before. When Lu Chengyu picked up the room card at the reception desk, he saw Liang Deyou and Chen Jin also coming in. The moment he and Liang Deyou locked eyes, Liang Deyou's face sank. Chengyu blinked and gave them a brilliant smile.Liang Deyou turned his head away and said to Chen Jin, \"Chen Jin, is there something wrong with your obnoxious cla.s.smate?\"Chen Jin glanced at Liang Deyou, \"You're the first person to state that he has a problem, so\u2026what do you think?\" Although he complained that Lu Chengyu didn't like him, Lu Chengyu was a very good person. He didn't want to act like an immature brat like Liang Deyou.\"I knew you still couldn't give up on him,\" said Liang Deyou with an ugly face. \"But he doesn't like you at all. Do you know that?\"Chen Jin stared at him and walked away silently, as if he was too lazy to speak.Therefore, when Lu Chengyu was about to go upstairs, he found Liang Deyou staring at him inexplicably, looking like he wanted to start a fight.He touched his chin and whispered to Cao Jingshen, \"Is there something wrong with that young master?\"Cao Jingshen pushed up his gla.s.ses, \"Maybe he's a second-stage critical patient, ba.\"Liang\u00a0 Deyou had leukaemia, which is the reason why he wanted Chen Jin. He loves him.This was the best hotel in M County, but in terms of facilities and service quality, there were still some gaps between this hotel and the first-cla.s.s hotels in Beijing. Lu Chengyu looked at the time. It was more than 9 P.M., but there were not that many pedestrians outside on the streets.Like him, Yan Mu also noticed this. He reached out and patted Lu Chengyu on the shoulder. \"Let's go in.\" Fortunately, the decision to abandon the bid was made. Otherwise, they would really lose a lot of money.The three people's rooms were next to one another. Lu Chengyu chose the room in the middle. If there was any noise in the rooms on both sides, he could detect it on time.After he put away his laundry, Chengyu took his notebook and came out of his room. Then, he heard someone coming out the opposite door. He looked up and saw Chen Jin, who was followed by Liang Deyou, also coming out.Chen Jin didn't think that things would happen so coincidentally. Remembering that he was rooming with Liang Deyou and that this was seen by Lu Chengyu, he suddenly became uncomfortable.\"Yo, what a coincidence,\" said Liang Deyou. He walked to Chen Jin with a grin on his face and blocked Chen Jin from Lu Chengyu's line of sight. \"Mr. Lu is also here for the bidding this time?\" There were several real estate companies in Beijing that were interested in M County's development plan. Which company did Lu Chengyu come from? How was he able to represent the company right after he started working?\"There's an old saying: 'know one's enemy as well as oneself'[3]; 'fight a hundred battles, win a hundred victories'[4]. If Mr. Liang is not clear, go back and ask you father. He should be able to teach you well.\" Yan Mu suddenly stepped out of his room. Glancing at Liang Deyou expressionlessly, he turned to Lu Chengyu and said, \"Get in, Jingshen is already here.\" Without looking at Liang Deyou, he took Lu Chengyu back into his room.[3]\u77e5\u5df1\u77e5\u5f7c [zh\u012b j\u01d0 zh\u012b b\u01d0]: know ones own and the enemy's situation [strength][4] \u767e\u6218\u767e\u80dc [b\u01ceizh\u00e0nb\u01ceish\u00e8ng]: to emerge victorious in every battle / to be ever-victoriousLiang Deyou looked at Yan Mu's back and, after half a day, spat out two words, \"f.u.c.k it!\" Where did this man come from to speak as he will? \"Did his family not teach him about courtesy?!\"Looking at the closed door, Chen Jin suddenly remembered that the company Lu Chengyu was working for now was Huading International. Was the person who just came out a senior staff or the president of Huading?Lu Chengyu, now\u2026 What height are you already standing at?Translator and Editor rambling section:Naeda: ngl, i kinda forgot about the chen and liang duo lolShunraiki: Haha, Chengyu haven't got his revenge to both of these guys, I bet we're gonna see them more after thisPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I've corrected the previous chapter. Enjoy this chapter \uff08\u2010\uff3e\u25bd\uff3e\u2010\uff09.Chapter 24: The little expert in digging pits.In the evening, the three of them discussed how they were going to deal with tomorrow's bidding without offending the local company. After the discussion, they retired for the night.When Lu Chengyu came out of Yan Mu's room, Chen Jin and Liang Deyou were no longer in the corridor. Even if they were, those two people probably wouldn't want to see him that much either. It was better for the two sides to not meet often since they were both tired of each other.Early the next morning, Lu Chengyu and the other two went downstairs to the restaurant for breakfast. At the buffet, Lu Chengyu realized that Liang Deyou was standing beside him. He laughed and whispered, \"Mr. Liang is here to partic.i.p.ate in the bidding this time?\"Liang Deyou sneered and did not look at Lu Chengyu: \u201cWhy? You don't dare to fight with us Liang Shi[1]?\u201d[1]\u6c0f [sh\u00ec]: clan name\"Mr. Liang doesn't know that my current employer is Huading International, the Huading that is well-known in the industry?\" He took two steamed dumplings on the tray and sighed slightly, \"Although Liang is rapidly developing these recent years, it is still far behind our Huading. With Huading here, Mr. Liang, you are doomed to run for nothing.\"\u201cWhat, Huading?\u201d Liang Deyou sneered, \u201cThe company, whose share prices had fallen to the lowest level in the stock market some time ago, have the nerve to compare with us Liang Shi?\"\"Huading is a big family that has been handed down for many years. As the saying goes: 'a lean camel is bigger than a horse',\" Lu Chengyu put down the tongs and glanced at Liang Deyou, flashing him a smile. \"Mr. Liang probably has little contact with the upper circle of Beijing and doesn't know what it values. Yan Jia[2] is not comparable to some enterprises that have made a fortune in a short period of time.\u201d[2] \u5bb6 [ji\u0101]: family; \u00a0 household; home; a person or familyLu Chengyu's sentences were enough to dig at Liang Deyou's heart. Although the Liang family had made a lot of money in recent years, it had not officially entered the upper circle of Beijing. On the basis of fame, it was not as good as Huading's Yan Jia. For this kind of thing, it was okay if not said out loud, but once someone does, it simply made Liang Shi lose face.He gritted his teeth and sneered, \"I want you to see which is stronger in the end: a dying camel or a galloping horse.\"\"Oh, I'll rub my eyes and wait[3], but it's better for Mr. Liang to not be too confident.\" Lu Chengyu smiled at Liang Deyou, gracefully striding to the side for the milk. As for Liang Deyou's face, what did it have to do with him?[3] \u62ed\u76ee\u4ee5\u5f85 [sh\u00ecm\u00f9y\u01d0d\u00e0i]: lit. to rub one's eyes and wait (idiom); to wait and see; keep your eyes open and wait for the eager expectations or close attention to the movements and outcomes of the situation.Yan Mu was looking at them in a happy face, he hope to get married with Chengyu soonNot far away, Cao Jingshen pushed up his gla.s.ses, looking sympathetically at the Liang Deyou who was rushing out of the breakfast hall in anger. He walked to Lu Chengyu and asked, \u201cHey, what did you say to that young master to make him look like that?\u201d\u201cI told him a story about a camel and a horse. He didn't like camels and went off angrily. Who knew he had such a small stomach [4]?\u201d Lu Chengyu put a gla.s.s of milk on Cao Jingshen's tray and smile brightly at him, \u201cA gla.s.s of milk in the morning is good for your health.\u201d[4] small stomach: low tolerance;\u00a0narrow-minded and relatively stingy.Looking at the milk on his tray, Cao Jingshen raised his eyebrows. The more he got to know Lu Chengyu, the more he felt that this person was not all graceful or elegant. A sharp-tongue, mean-minded expert in pitting people is who Lu Chengyu really was.Yan Mu, who had already picked his breakfast, sat at the table waiting for Lu Chengyu and Cao Jingshen. After they sat down, he asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d\"Just digging pits and waiting for someone to jump in,\" Lu Chengyu said in a low voice as he looked around. \"That Liang young master has such a wonderful personality. If I don't dig a little pit for him, I'll feel sorry for my conscience.\"Cao Jingshen looked at him suspiciously. A thing like a conscience, did Lu Chengyu really have it?Yan Mu nodded and didn't comment on Lu Chengyu's behaviour. But, after a while, he suddenly said, \u201cLiang is our rival in the industry. If Liang's successor keeps doing this, sooner or later, he will waste all of his father's efforts.\u201dLu Chengyu, while drinking milk, did not speak. He didn't know much about Liang's family in his previous life but vaguely remembered that Liang Deyou took over after a few years. At that time, Liang Deyou's temperament was much calmer than it is now. Although his EQ was not high, his IQ obviously increased throughout the years.Liang Deyou might experience something in the future that would temper his att.i.tude. Otherwise, with his current manners, he would kill himself even before Huading lifted a finger.Cao Jingshen suddenly whispered, \u201cAlthough the economy here is not very developed, the hotel's grade is not low.\u201d\u201cOrdinary people can't afford to spend money, but there are always people willing to spend money that is not their own,\u201d Yan Mu tone was somewhat complicated. \u201cSometimes, the direction is determined as good, but if someone decides to abandon that direction, the result can only be lost.\"Lu Chengyu and Cao Jingshen both knew what Yan Mu was alluding at. At the thought of Yan Mu's mother's family background, they both exchanged glances and led the topic elsewhere. There were things that they couldn't afford to hear and couldn't afford to interfere with.Yan Mu didn't seem to want to continue this topic. He drank a mouthful of milk and began to eat what was on the plate. Halfway through the meal, he observed that Lu Chengyu liked to eat Luo Hanguo fruit, so he gave him the Luo Hanguo on his plate and continued to eat silently.Luo HanguoNoticing his movements, Cao Jingshen looked at Lu Chengyu, who was sitting beside him. When he saw that Lu Chengyu naturally said thanks to Yan Mu, Cao Jingshen quietly took back his sight.Jingshen already know his boss has fallen in love with Chengyu and buried his feelingsM County's bidding venue was about 20 minutes away from the hotel. Because there weren't as many vehicles on the road compared to Beijing, leading to no traffic jam, Lu Chengyu and the others arrived a little earlier than expected.The reception staff saw the company brand hanging on their chest. Realizing that they belonged to a big company in Beijing, they eagerly and enthusiastically arranged them for them the front seats.Lu Chengyu looked around the luxurious and s.p.a.cious venue as he sat down with Cao Jingshen on his right and Yan Mu on his left. He put his notebook on the table and plugged in his wireless Wifi adapter, waiting for the bidding to begin.After a few moments, the bosses of both large and small companies arrived; it seemed like the market interest of M County attracted many people. Listening to the noise around him, he whispered in Yan Mu's ear, \u201cBoss, the boss of Shengrong Company in S County also came.\u201dYan Mu raised his head and saw Shengrong Company's boss, Sheng Shaoyuan, walking toward him with a beaming smile on his face. In response, he stood up and shook hands with the other party. After saying a few words, they both sat down politely. There was nothing to indicate that they were both compet.i.tors at all.Sheng Shaoyuan actually in love with Jingshen although he knew he has no money.Sheng Shaoyuan was not a simple person. From the polite conversation, Lu Chengyu had heard just now, Sheng Shaoyuan seemed to be implying that the investment in M County was just a pa.s.sing event. Was this a demonstration of his position, or was this person aware of the hidden risks that came with bidding in M County?He turned to look at Yan Mu and found that the man wasn't at all surprised by his opponent's behaviour. He even vaguely felt that Yan Mu knew why Sheng Shaoyuan would say such words.M County was selling a lot of land in this bidding compet.i.tion. As an opener, they began by selling the land that didn't have much development value. Yan Mu and Shengrong's boss bought a small piece of land that wasn't worth much. Then, they no longer actively bid, as if they are waiting to get the last big heads: the two pieces of land in the North District.After more than an hour of bidding, it finally time for today's highlight. The bidding of Land A in the North District was first. The three largest real estate companies present and two other companies that joined together became the main bidders.Shengrong was the first company to give up, followed by the two cooperating companies.Only Yan Mu did not seem to take Liang Deyou in his eyes from beginning to end. Every time Liang Deyou called out a price, he would add another 100,000 yuan to it.Liang Deyou flushed with anger at Yan Mu's behaviour. He bit his teeth and continued to raise the price. Then he looked at Yan Mu, wanting to see how the president of Huading would bid.Chen Jin looked at Liang Deyou in embarra.s.sment. This price had already exceeded the company's fixed base price. Land A in the North District had soft soil, which required a great investment in development, and was abandoned by a few bidders.Although this place would be developed in the future, the price was enough to buy the same area of land in third-tier cities, not to mention the cost of demolition and construction in the later period. To estimate, it would cost a lot of money. M County was a remote and spa.r.s.ely populated county. How could it be worth this price?Yan Mu seemed to be aware of Liang Deyou's vision. His mouth hooked up to an imperceptible smile, and he stopped bidding.Land A's site finally belonged to the Liang family. Sheng Shaoyuan applauded slowly and said to the Secretary beside him, \u201cHuading's boss' hand is very poisonous. Young master Liang is still too tender. Sooner or later, he will be killed by Mr. Yan.\u201dThe Secretary wondered, \u201cIsn't Mr. Yan really trying to buy this land?\"\u201cDon't look at this person's decent and serious appearance,\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan scratched his chin with his clean and slender forefinger. \u201cThat's a wolf-dog that can't bark but bites hard.\u201dThe secretary was silent for a while, \u201cI don't think Mr Yan would like your metaphor very much.\u201d\u201cI like it, and he can't hear it anyway,\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan glanced at the secretary. \u201cI'm sure you won't say it, will you? \u201cThe Secretary frowned. \u201cBoss, did you say something just now?\u201d [T/N: Good secretary will wipe their memory according to boss's instructions\u2026]Then, they looked at each other and laughed. Loud and continuous applause sounded for Liang's success in buying Land A, which was really a great joy to celebrate.Read this at Shunraikitranslation, I use my tear, sweat and blood translating for free.When Liang Deyou successfully won the bidding of Land A's site, he looked in Lu Chengyu's direction and found that the latter was clapping at him with a smiling face. He couldn't see the slightest bit of annoyance. As if a fly had entered his throat, Liang Deyou felt uncomfortable to the point of wanting to vomit. Even his sense of achievement began to drop sharply.The remaining Land B was taken by two other real estate companies. In the midst of all the excitement, the bidding meeting ended satisfactorily.Organizers prepared a hearty buffet lunch for investors at the hotel. Lu Chengyu looked at expensive fruit and luxury dinner, and remember a few words from the great poet Du Fu, a poem mocking Zhu Menfujia[4], and then excitedly chose what he liked to eat.[4] I forgot where I read about this poem, but from what I understand, the poem reveals the social reality of the disparity between the rich and the poor.\u201cBefore, our side had investigated Liang Shi's bottom price, and it doesn't seem to be this high,\u201d Cao Jingshen said while clipping the two lobster b.a.l.l.s to his plate. He continued to speak to the Lu Chengyu beside him, \u201cIs there some problem with this?\u201d\"Didn't you say that he has eighth-grader syndrome[5]?\" Lu Chengyu put some scallops on his plate. \"It's not the bottom price that has a problem but the young master's brain.\"[5] eighth-grader syndrome: or known as chuunibyou, j.a.panese colloquial term, typically used to describe early teens who have delusions of grandeur, who so desperately want to stand out that they have convinced themselves they have hidden knowledge or secret powers. More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChunibyoCao Jingshen looked at Lu Chengyu suspiciously. If no one stimulated Liang Deyou's syndrome, it wouldn't have been so severe. Just who was it that made the young master lose his reason?As if he hadn't seen Cao Jingshen's suspecting eyes, Lu Chengyu tasted the scallops and frowned. \u201cIf you want to eat aquatic products, it's better to go to the Linhai area.\u201dCao Jingshen, \u201cHa ha.\u201dLu Chengyu turned to look at him, raised his chin, and motioned him to look to the left, \u201cBoss is coming.\u201dCao Jingshen knew that Chengyu was not going to explain it to him for the time being, so he said, \u201cI saw it. Do you need me to thank you for your reminder?\u201d\u201cYou're welcome,\u201d Lu Chengyu said, smiling. \u201cI've always been a warm young man.\u201dCao Jingshen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHaha.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, he just picked up a few pieces of beef and lettuce before sitting down at a nearby table. Evidently, he was already used to seeing his secretary and a.s.sistant getting along. As the boss, he didn't bother asking what they were talking about.Many company secretaries have delicate relationships with their boss' a.s.sistants. Obviously, both of Yan Mu's right and left-hand men handled these problems very well and didn't need Yan Mu's worry. However, it would be better if these two people were a little bit farther away.Lu Chengyu and Cao Jingshen sat down with their boss. As he drank a mouthful of red wine to suppress the taste of scallops, Lu Chengyu said. \u201cBoss, what kind of mooncake is our company going to prepare for the Mid-Autumn Festival?\u201dYan Mu looked at Cao Jingshen. It's obvious that this matter was under the responsibility of the Logistics Department, which was none of his business, so he didn't care about it.Cao Jingshen shook his head. \u201cI don't know. We might decide according to the old rules. Are there any problems?\u201d\"Since boss just took office this year, it's better to launch a voting system in the company's forum to let everyone choose for themselves,\u201d\u00a0 Lu Chengyu smiled. \u201cAlthough it's only a small matter, at least it would let them understand that the new boss is different from the previous boss.\u201dYan Mu, as president, really didn't pay attention to these trivial matters. However, although they might seem small, these little things go a long way.As an a.s.sistant, Lu Chengyu putting forwards these ideas showed that he was a very careful person and experienced in his work. Yan Mu nodded and softly said, \u201cGood.\u201d\u201cThen, I'll prepare the voting process when I get back.\u201d Seeing that Yan Mu agreed, Lu Chengyu wrote it down.But no one knows, Chengyu actually didn't take note and problems arises later on.\u201cYou three look happy, do you mind adding two more people?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, Sheng Shaoyuan sat down with his tray, \u201cThis morning's bid was interesting. Mr. Yan is indeed a business elite.\u201d\u201cMr. Sheng overpraised. The real winner today is that young man from Liang Shi,\u201d Yan Mu raised his cup of red wine to Sheng Shaoyuan. \u201cWe were only accompanying the young master as sidekicks this time.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d sighed Sheng Shaoyuan. \u201cThis trip can be considered as chasing a wild-goose[1].\u201d[1] \u00a0 \u767d\u8dd1\u4e00\u8d9f [b\u00e1ip\u01ceoy\u012bt\u00e0ng]: to go on an errand for nothing.Read this at Shunraikitranslations, it's totally free and there's a lot of cookies here~Lu Chengyu listened to Sheng Shaoyuan with a smile, but from Cao Jingshen's att.i.tude, he could tell that there was something strange going on. This Sheng Shaoyuan's heart was much more complicated than what he showed on the surface.\u201cIs this young man Mr. Yan's a.s.sistant?\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan suddenly looked at Lu Chengyu and said with a laugh, \u201cHe looks young. Nowadays, young people are getting more and more fierce.\u201dLu Chengyu laughed and said, \u201cMr. Sheng is also young and promising. I just learned a little from Secretary Cao.\u201dAfter Sheng Shaoyuan heard what Lu Chengyu said, he slowly smiled and cut the steak on his plate. Turning to Yan Mu, he said, \u201cThis steak is a little bit old. There are some things that will be more delicious if it's tender.\u201dYan Mu nodded: \u201cThat's true. Even old cows like to eat tender gra.s.s[2].\u201d[2]\u00a0 \u8001\u725b\u5403\u5ae9\u8349 [l\u01ceoni\u00fach\u012bn\u00e8nc\u01ceo]: a romance where the man is significantly older than the womanSheng Shaoyuan's secretary silently thought, 'Isn't \u2018old cows like to eat tender gra.s.s' a phrase to curse others?'\u201cHaha,\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan's face changed slightly, then he smiled and got up, \u201cI've been disturbing Mr. Yan for so long, I should return to my seat.\u201d After that, he picked up his plate and left the table.The secretary following him whispered, \u201cBoss, are you interested in that a.s.sistant?\u201d\u201cThat little a.s.sistant is not a simple person,\u201d said Sheng Shaoyuan, frowning and shaking his head. \u201cAnd Yan Mu obviously intends to protect him. I prefer mutual consent, and it's better not to provoke such decent people.\u201dThe secretary was silent. So boss, you do realize that you did bad things.After lunch, they drove with the organizer to see the landmarks of M County. After dinner, when they returned to the hotel, it was already more than 11 p.m.Once Lu Chengyu returned to his room, he took a bath and went to bed. As for other things, all of them were temporarily forgotten.Sheng Shaoyuan actually didn't give up, he went to organizer and ask for chengyu's numAfter returning to the capital, Lu Chengyu made a small voting poll and posted it on the forum. Judging from the votes the following days, the most popular mooncakes were egg yolk mooncakes [3], lotus seed paste mooncakes[4] and etc.; the most disliked one was probably Wuren mooncakes[5].[3][4][5]Some colleagues even left a message below saying how they wanted Wuren mooncakes to roll out of the mooncake circle, showing how bitter and disgusting this mooncake tasted.So, at the end, Chengyu used his right as ceo a.s.sistant and choose wuren mooncakeWhile everyone was fighting over the mooncakes in the forum,\u300aSoaring Birds\u300bhad just been audited. Now, all they needed to do was contact a theatre chain and win a slot to release this movie on National Day. This step was crucial; each year, who knew how many movies failed to appear in front of the audience because of there being no contacts with the theatre.Because this year's Mid-Autumn Festival coincided with National Day, many upcoming movies took this as an excellent opportunity to be released, and many cinemas had already started introducing films with famous actors. It's already hard to say if a movie like\u300aSoaring Birds\u300bcould be released, let alone being released during this holiday.Therefore, when he left work Friday afternoon, Lu Chengyu thickened his face and went to find Yan Mu. He had prepared his speech and persuasion, but as soon as he finished talking about the film, Yan Mu asked, \u201cIs this the movie you made with your friends?\u201dMaybe it's because the other party's att.i.tude was too casual, but Lu Chengyu got a little embarra.s.sed. He nodded: \u201cI have some money in hand, so I went to invest in a small-cost film.\u201dYan Mu frowned, obviously thinking of the box office war, \u201cHow about Yuhe Film City?\u201d\u201cYuhe?\u201d Lu Chengyu was stunned. This was a well-known theatre chain in China. There were many cinemas under Yuhe Film City's banner, and this theatre chain had been invested and built by the owner himself. Of course, to choose movies for this well-known theatre chain, the owner must be very picky.\u201cDoes Boss know the owner of Yuhe Film City?\u201d\u201cHe's my friend,\u201d Yan Mu thought, \u201cI'll take you to meet him tomorrow, so bring the movie with you. Let him watch it, and he will give the final say on this movie.\u201d\u201cThank you, boss,\u201d Lu Chengyu knew Yan Mu's character. Willingly bringing him to meet the owner of Yuhe Film City was already the biggest back door. Wouldn't it be too much if he wanted the other party to directly give him the green light without even showing him the movie?In this line of business, to form a relationship with someone, he needed to know the other party's rules. If he couldn't abide by those rules, he wouldn't last very long in the circle. Lu Chengyu planned to mix in the entertainment business for a long time, but if their first meeting led to the other party thinking that he, Lu Chengyu, was annoying, how far could he go in the future?aRGHHH, MY TOOTHACHESS~! HOW CAN I EAT SWEET AFTER THIS, I LOVE SWEET!Outside the teahouse beside the main road in Beijing, Zhuang Yu got out of his car and looked at his friend, who was sitting by the window, and the young man beside him. With a doubtful face, Zhuang Yu strode in.\u201cMu-ge,\u201d he sat down opposite Yan Mu. Looked at Lu Chengyu, he took off his sungla.s.ses and, with a smile on his face, asked, \u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d\u201cThis is my a.s.sistant Lu Chengyu,\u201d Yan Mu turned to Lu Chengyu and began to introduce Zhuang Yu. \u201cThis is my friend of many years. Now, he is the owner of Yuhe Film City.\u201dZhuang Yu felt that something was amiss, but from Lu Chengyu's appearance and behaviour, he didn't seem like some artists in the circle who would hold someone's thigh for unwritten rules. Slightly smiling, Zhuang Yu said, \u201cSo you're the a.s.sistant Lu that Mu-ge has been talking about recently. h.e.l.lo.\u201d\u201ch.e.l.lo, Mr. Zhuang.\u201d Looking at the other party's outstretched hand, Lu Chengyu smiled and politely bowed slightly to shake his hands, \u201cI've been looking forward to meeting you.\u201dZhuang Yu's smile broadened, and he shook Lu Chengyu's hand, \u201cMr Lu is too polite.\u201d Then, he looked at Yan Mu, \u201cMu-ge, last night you said on the phone that there was something you wanted to discuss with me. What is it?\u201dAfter Yan Mu explained his intention, Zhuang Yu scanned Lu Chengyu up and down un.o.btrusively, then gently chuckled, \u201cSince it's Mr. Lu's film, there's no problem telling the cinema to release it on National Day.\u201d\u201cI know Mr. Zhuang has a good relationship with the boss, but you're a businessman. The box office battles in the major cinemas during the short and long vacation are also fierce. I can't let the cinema suffer losses because of my selfish interests,\u201d Lu Chengyu took the film out of his bag and put it in front of him. \u201cLetting the boss introduce me to you is already the biggest back door, so the procedure of choosing films must follow the rules.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The way Zhuang Yu looked at Lu Chengyu began to change, \u201cWhat's wrong with Mu-ge\u2018s recommendation?\u201d\u201cBoss is not a movie watcher, but an expert in investing in movies. I'm afraid his vision in choosing movies is not as good as that of the vegetable market aunt,\u201d Lu Chengyu pushed the film in front of Zhuang Yu again, \u201cSo I would like to ask Mr. Zhuang to spare some time to watch this movie. If you think the movie can be shown, please consider arranging the cinema venues under your banner to show this movie.\u201dA small-budget movie like this didn't have grand premieres, nor press conferences, because even if they did, there weren't many reporters who would want to report it.\u201cOkay,\u201d Zhuang Yu picked up the movie, then he said while smiling, \u201cXiao Lu, you are a straightforward person. I really appreciate youngsters who have both ability and a straightforward att.i.tude. Afterwards, if you have time, let's go out together and have fun. It'll surely be enjoyable.\u201d\u201cAs long as you are not playing ten thousand cards[6], Mr. Zhuang, feel free to call me.\u201d Lu Chengyu heard that the other party had changed his address and his tone was relaxed, \u201cOf course, if you are playing with cars or planes, don't call me. I'll probably can't stop myself from touching them.\u201d[6] its gamble, Lu Chengyu didn't use directly the word gambling.Zhuang Yu was amused by Lu Chengyu's att.i.tude, so he ordered a cup of tea casually, \u201cI don't like to play these. I usually play tennis or go to a farmhouse and spend the day there. Among my friends, I am a good fisherman.\u201dAfter listening to those words, Lu Chengyu had a better impression of Zhuang Yu, and he immediately became energetic, \u201cHave you ever been to that farmhouse on the Eastside? The fruits and vegetables in that field are all-natural. They are big and full of water. The fish made by their cook are also very delicious and aren't comparable to that made in the cities.\u201d\u201cHow can I go there\u2026.\u201d Zhuang Yu was also happy; he discussed with Lu Chengyu about which farmhouse had a good environment, how to catch fish, how to pick lotus buds, and even how to loosen the soil so that the vegetables could grow well.Yan Mu seldom went to those kinds of places, so, although they mentioned the places' name, he didn't know about them. Yan Mu drank the tea silently while listening to his friend and Lu Chengyu's conversation about the agritourism[7] around Beijing's suburbs, as well as which foods were delicious and which weren't; they talked as if they regret not having met the other sooner.[7] agritourism: tourism in which tourists stay with local people in rural areas abroad.At the end of the day, both of them developed such a good relationship that they began calling each other \u2018xi\u014dng d\u00ec' [8]. Before they left, Yan Mu heard that they've already discussed where to go and what to do together on National Day.[8] \u5144\u5f1f [xi\u014dng d\u00ec]: brothers; \u00a0 fraternal; brotherly;After saying goodbye to Zhuang Yu, Lu Chengyu said to Yan Mu, \u201cBoss, your friends are really nice.\u201d\u201cHmm, birds of a feather flock together[9],\u201d Yan Mu opened his car's door, \u201cZhuang Yu is a good person, he's just a bit fickle[10].\u201d[9] \u7269\u4ee5\u7c7b\u805a [w\u00f9 y\u01d0 l\u00e8i j\u00f9]: similar things come together (idiom); like draws like.[10]\u82b1\u5fc3 [hu\u0101x\u012bn]: fickle (in love affairs) / dissipated / unfaithful.Lu Chengyu laughed and followed him into the car. \u201cAre you praising yourself?\u201dYan Mu: \u201c\u2026\u201dIn fact, his emphasis was on the latter sentence.[T/N: Yan Mu trying to say that Zhuang Yu is not a good choice(?) because he's fickle in love, which is the sentence that Yan Mu try to emphasize.]Towards dawn that evening, Yan Mu was woken up by Zhuang Yu's phone call. As soon as he pressed the answer b.u.t.ton, he heard Zhuang Yu's excited voice coming out of his mobile phone.\u201cf.u.c.k, Mu-ge, your friend is a genius. Tomorrow, call him to come sign a film introduction contract with me and ask him to make the posters more beautiful. I will hang them out for him to publicize.\u201dYan Mu: \u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cForget it, you tell me his phone number. I'm going to get in touch with him myself. f.u.c.k, Laozi chatted with him for so long yesterday but forgot to ask for his phone number, f.u.c.k, f.u.c.k.\u201dYan Mu was stunned by his several \u2018f.u.c.ks'. He heard the other side still chattering and took a breath. \u201cZhuang Yu, it's the wee hours of the morning now.\u201d\u201cIt's wee hours?\u201d\u00a0 Zhuang Yu was somewhat surprised. He paused for a moment, perhaps taking a look at the clock, \u201cReally, I forgot the time when I watched the movie. Mu-ge, say \u2018okay' to Lu xiong di[8] and let him come to our company early tomorrow morning. I'm going to introduce this movie exclusively!\u201dListening to the beep, Yan Mu put the phone aside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26Chapter 26: Xiao Yu, you are famous againZhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei could hardly believe their ears when they received Lu Chengyu\u2019s phone call. Mr. Lu had contacted the theatre chain so quickly, and the other side was the famous Yuhe Film City in China. This was beyond their expectations.\u201cThis Mr. Lu is not a simple man.\u201d Qu Lingbei recalled Lu Chengyu\u2019s usual behaviour. He was a very graceful and easygoing young man. The crew, from the director to the handyman, had a good impression of him.Furthermore, this person was aware of the shortcomings of an amateur director; when shooting films, he never criticized them, nor did he tell the scriptwriter to revise the script just because of an actor\u2019s flattery. His actions were truly rare in the circle.Writers in this circle\u00a0\u2014\u2014\u00a0apart from some famous ones\u00a0\u2014\u2014\u00a0for the most part, would be forced to change the script. Sometimes, they would even need to change the male protagonist to the second male lead, the female protagonist to the third female lead. At first, they thought Lu Chengyu wanted to act in this movie and use the investment money as a ticket to do so. However, contrary to expectations, Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t have much interest in filming. He only played a minor supporting role in order to fit the image and save the cost.\u201cAbility is ability, but as long as I look at his face, I will unconsciously regard him as a fresh graduate student,\u201d Zhang Shuo scratched his head. \u201cThen, we will send the things to him now?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t send it over, do you intend to keep it for yourself?\u201d He remembered that the poster was designed by Mr. Lu, and the poster maker was also the person Mr. Lu contacted. \u201cQuickly go and move the things to the car.\u201dThey moved the leaflets and posters to some worn-out vans and headed all the way to Yuhe Film City. When they arrived, Lu Chengyu was already waiting for them by the gate.But they never thought that one day, things gonna change\u2026\u201cBoth of you have worked hard,\u201d Lu Chengyu went to them and helped to pick up a box of items. \u201cI already got in touch with Zhuang-ge. We\u2019ll go up now.\u201dZhang Shuo followed him nervously. After entering the elevator, Zhang Shuo asked uneasily, \u201cMr. Lu, how many showtimes a day will the owner of Yuhe Film City arrange for us?\u201d\u201cWorried?\u201d Lu Chengyu turned to Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei, both of whom were nervous, and laughed, \u201cI believe in you guys. Even if they arrange fewer showtimes in the beginning, they will certainly add more later.\u201dZhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei blushed when they heard this, but they felt that Mr. Lu\u2019s words were sincere, and he wasn\u2019t just speaking to comfort them.The door wasn\u2019t closed when they arrived at the office. Inside, they saw Zhuang Yu talking to someone on the phone.Lu Chengyu took the two men back a few steps, waited for Zhuang Yu to hang up the phone, then went up and knocked on the door frame twice. Outside the door, he said, \u201cZhuang-ge, are you busy?\u201d\u201cXiao Lu?\u201d Seeing Lu Chengyu with two other men, Zhuang Yu smiled and let them in. After a few words, he led the conversation to the main track and began talking about advertisements and allocating cinemas.Nowadays, the profit share of the cinema chain wasn\u2019t much, and Zhuang Yu also had no intention of competing for the benefits in this area with Lu Chengyu. Because Yuhe Film City had a lot of cinemas under its name, the main topic of conversation between the two was about division of cinemas for\u300aSoaring Birds\u300b.Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei watched Zhuang Yu and Lu Chengyu calling each other\u00a0xiong di, laughing and talking about the cinemas\u2019 division. Clearly, it was a warm scene, but as they both stared, stunned, they couldn\u2019t help but feel there were some kind of confrontation going on between the two men.\u201cWell, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m very grateful that Zhuang-ge\u00a0has helped me so much this time.\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to invest in movies nowadays. There\u2019s a lot of big and small expenses to consider. If I could get more than 35% of the box office returns, that wouldn\u2019t be bad.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that could be done about it. Even investing in a cinema chain is not easy. To build a small cinema casually, including projection equipment, large and small, and other facilities, tens of millions of dollars are needed.\u201d Both of them apparently have the same view. Zhuang Yu sighed, \u201cTo do all of this just to scrape a living, both of us certainly don\u2019t have it easy, ah.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded, looking like a man who was reduced to a beggar from a faraway place.Zhang Shuo: \u201c\u2026\u201dQu Lingbei: \u201c\u2026\u201dDid they really think about his and Qu Lingbei\u2019s feelings when they said that?Well, they did actually. Zhuang Yu didn\u2019t know that he\u2019s going to be the third man.Eleven o\u2019clock in the evening, on the fourteenth day of the eighth month of the lunar year, the 30th of September on the Gregorian calendar, \u300aSoaring Birds\u300bwas released silently. At this time, posters of the film had been hung outside the cinema. Although neither the director nor the actors were people they\u2019d heard of, because the posters were very eye-catching and of good quality, some couples who had started their holiday bought tickets for the show with a dispensable mentality. Nevertheless, the attendance rate was less than 20%, which was very low.However, from the beginning to the end of the movie, almost no one left early. From time to time, the audience burst into laughter, the atmosphere so warm it hardly resembled a theater with low attendance.Halfway through the movie, some people already tweeted about the funny and humorous scenes in \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b, but, because there was only a small number of people who posted, there was no response. By the end of the movie, however, there was more content about the film on Weibo.\u201cLulululu: The hell, the way I watched the movie must be wrong. I seem to see the recently most handsome top scholar from Q University in this movie. The way the male god put on glasses is simply asking this old woman to scream \u201chandsome\u00a0la\u201d. This movie is extremely hilarious. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll watch this movie again and ask my friend to come with me.\u201dLulululu was a well-known Weibo user. After she sent out her post, many people thought that it was an advertising post, while others began to get interested in the movie. Under the post, they asked who made the movie.On the third day, \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b became a hot topic on Weibo. Some people even started making memes of the male lead in the movie and Gao Fu Shuai [1] , played by Lu Chengyu, to make fun of * Si and Gao Fu Shuai.[1]\u9ad8\u5bcc\u5e05 [g\u0101of\u00f9shu\u00e0i]: \u201cMr Perfect\u201d (i.e. tall, rich and handsome) (Internet slang)But anyway, the picture of Lu Chengyu wearing gold-rimmed glasses and gently pushing them with his right index finger had gone viral on Weibo.When the small-cost movie was in theatres at the same time as the famous ones, it unexpectedly was able to come through and win the battle in one strike. From an attendance rate of less than 20% to full attendance, many cinemas began inserting extra showtimes for the movie. Despite this, some people complained on Weibo that when they queued for tickets at 1 PM, they could only buy ones for 12 PM. Then, they expressed their hope that the cinema would continue adding showtimes for this movie, showing how popular it was.Some media joked that \u300aSoaring Birds\u300bwas a black horse that killed this year\u2019s film circle. Some experts came out to study the reason for the movie\u2019s high popularity. Others said that this kind of low-level comedy movie was just a box of fast food; it seemed interesting, but it actually had no nutrition.However, this argument was quickly taken down by the expert who made this criticism when others mocked him for not watching the movie. This was because even an ordinary person could tell that the directors and writers used comedy as a disguise to produce meaning and helplessness of the people at the bottom, show the protagonists\u2019 optimistic attitude towards life, as well as express satire for certain social behaviours. Humour was interesting, but it could be full of meaning.\u201cThis kind of film that can convey both meaning and humour is clearly a good work, but in some people\u2019s eyes, it has become worthless garbage. Perhaps in the eyes of some people, if the movie doesn\u2019t have an investment of more than 100 million yuan, doesn\u2019t have famous actors, and is not the usual type of literature movie, it is not a good film. I don\u2019t know if the expert or professor who has this view is lamenting about nowadays film circle or just have a black sense of humour?\u201dThis was posted by one of the film critics and was quickly forwarded by many people making others who read this post pondered over his words.On the fourth day of the film\u2019s release, it was revealed that \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b had a total investment of fewer than three million yuan. In order to save costs, the director and the crew played as various passers-by roles.The male lead actor, Gao Boyang, joked on Weibo, saying that the most valuable thing in the whole group was the sports car Gao Fushuai drove. If something had gone wrong with that car, even if he sold everything in the movie group, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgSomeone asked him on Weibo: How did the crew get this limited-cost sports car when they were so poor?Gao Boyang answered that the investors borrowed it from friends, but did not mention who the investors were or who the people they borrowed from were. However, the fans were not interested in the investors. In their impression, the investors\u2019 appearance could be automatically blurred. Although there might be some good-looking uncles, they all had some sort of family background and couldn\u2019t be inundated, so no one cared..In this movie, the most famous actor was not male lead or female lead, but the male actor who had fewer scenes, Mr. Gao Fu Shuai. It had to be said that in this realistic society, having a handsome face was still very cheap[2].[2] \u5360\u4fbf\u5b9c [zh\u00e0n pi\u00e1n yi]: gain an extra advantage by unfair means.In just a few days, the number of fans on Lu Chengyu\u2019s Weibo had risen to millions, and the enthusiastic younger ones called him \u2018Male God\u2019. However, some male movie fans seemed to be less polite to him. They just praise him a bit for his success in getting the role. Some fans who liked to ridicule and hate on the rich shouted out that he, Gao Fu Shuai, should be burned to death. They were so jealous of Lu Chengyu they called him the \u2018zhu\u0101ng b\u012b[3] man\u2019.[3] \u88c5\u903c [zhu\u0101ng b\u012b]: a human behaviour that has two meanings:a) to show off, pretend to gain vanity, self-satisfaction and even deception, to show others the temperament they lack.b) to falsely conceal one\u2019s abilities from others, but actually give others hints, when others really ask for help, he won\u2019t help them.Reference:\u00a0https://baike.baidu.com/item/\u88c5BHowever, since most of his fans on Weibo were cute and tough sisters, most of the time, these male compatriots would be attacked by their strong and rich language skills.So recently, Lu Chengyu\u2019s favourite thing to do was scrolling on Weibo and read comments of Meng Mezhis[3] waging war with the men. However, because of the strong fighting power of the sisters, Lu Chengyu made up his mind. In the future, he must be as warm as the spring breeze to his female compatriots, otherwise, if the female compatriots become a bone-chilling wind, it would be tragic.[3] \u840c\u59b9\u7eb8 [m\u00e9ng m\u00e8izh\u01d0]: a network term for cute girl.\u201cMy great heavenly Meng Mezhi is strong!\u201d He sighed for a moment before sending out this post on his Weibo. Afterwards, he sadly found himself a wretched factor as this post unwittingly began spreading out. Fortunately, most people thought that he was thanking the female fans for helping him talk, so many of them praised him as cute on this post.However, even so, there are still some creatures under this post that failed to understand.Three hours after the post was sent out, he accidentally saw a comment, which was supposed to be from a man. From the man\u2019s words, Lu Chengyu was deliberately flattering women. He also talked about how superficial heavenly women were, and how they only focused on appearances and wealth. He said they were inferior to the virtuous women from such-and-such country, going as far as to describe them as \u2018n\u01dabi\u01ceozi [4]\u2019.[4] \u5973\u8868\u5b50 [n\u01dabi\u01ceozi]: the woman expresses herself with the price tag; nickname for prostitutes. That is, women sell their bodies in a straightforwardly priced price and bargain.Although Lu Chengyu was a man, most of the girls around him were very good, and his mother was also a very good person. The man who held such contempt towards women, so much that he even cursed them, probably making his mother feel sorry for giving birth and raising him. This type of man, afterwards, no matter how successful he was, he was nothing but a loser.\u201cMay you have abundance year after year : I have been fond of pleasing people since childhood, to my parents when I was a child, to my teachers when I was a student, and to my supervisors and colleagues after graduation \u256e(\u256f_\u2570)\u256d. But please remember, swearing friends, think about the people who raised you before you speak. Swearing at people will not make you look high and noble, but will only make you look too deplorable. For me, flattery is respect and cherishment, because only when you respect others, will others respect you.\u201dThis post was similar to self-ridicule and admonishment, causing many people to forward it. Many male compatriots also stood on his side.One day ago, a man who made fun of Lu Chengyu\u2019s character in the movie also forwarded this post. He wrote the following sentence: \u201cMale God, I also want to flatter you.\u201dThis, of course, attracted a group of goodwill mockery. From then on, Lu Chengyu\u2019s status as a male god was formally settled.After reading his previous post, some male fans who did not like him found that there was no ostentation of wealth, no self-elevation, and no pretension of petty money on Lu Chengyu\u2019s Weibo. Instead, he solemnly gives out some interesting professional theories, as well as some local delicacies. And these places were hardly high-consumption venues, but roadside stalls or small restaurants.As a result, many male fans also had a good feeling for him, and gradually, there were less and less people calling him the zhu\u0101ng b\u012b man. Of course, there were a few exceptions who were deliberately finding faults with him.He looked at the lively Weibo, smiled, then closed it.Lu Chengyu open the country\u2019s largest public forum and sent out what had been prepared before. The good drama regarding the movie was already in full swing. Now, another good drama was just about to begin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27Chapter 27: Dealt Liang Shi a heavy blowJust as\u300aSoaring Birds\u300bwas blowing up on the internet, there were suddenly pictures of Chairman Liang\u2019s lover, who he kept outside[1] and hidden from his wife and son, exposed online. Of course, what really made the public angry was that the person who exposed the pictures also exposed Liang Shi\u2019s high-end neighbourhood. That neighbourhood had just passed the quality inspection when this incident, which caused a great safety concern, occurred.[1] outside here means that the lover is not married to the guy who already married, or mistress.Just as they were suspecting the informer to be Liang company\u2019s rival, this person also released Liang company\u2019s real-estate\u2019s tax evasion, revenue defraudation, and false accounts soon after. After a series of evidence was listed by the whistleblower, his tone was found to resemble an insider of the Liang family. The reason why he put out all these evidence was because he didn\u2019t like young master Liang\u2019s arrogant attitude.Most people didn\u2019t care about which company evaded taxes, defrauded their revenue, and made false accounts. However, who made Chairman Liang a well-known private entrepreneur in recent years, with journalists often praising him in newspapers as a good man who cares for his wife and family? There were also TV stations showcasing his and his wife\u2019s, Zhang Fang\u2019s, support of each other over the years as they built their fortune, leading many people to believe that Chairman Liang was a good man who never forgot his wife.Liang Guoming, Chairman of Liang\u2019s company, kept a mistress, and there was evidence his mistress gave birth to his daughter. His original image of a good man collapsed in an instant.If evidence of a man\u2019s cheating was posted on the internet, most people would, at most, mock that his \u201ccircle was really chaotic\u201d, and then the matter would be over with. However, if the role model of a good man was seen in dozens of photos with different mistresses and even had a daughter with one of the said mistresses, the people\u2019s trust in him would shatter. How much they once admired and respected him before was how much they hated him now.At this point, it became a huge farce in the business circle. Later, some people came out to expose the female stars involved with Liang Guoming. Some even claimed that he once took care of a male artist. In the end, everything turned into a double farce between the entertainment and business circle.In this world, there would never be a lack of people who will throw stones at someone who fell down a well [2] . Lu Chengyu only sent some obscure things about Liang Guoming on the internet, but more were anonymously sent by Liang Guoming\u2019s former opponents. These opponents spontaneously found people to expose Liang Guoming\u2019s various scandals.[2] \u843d\u4e95\u4e0b\u77f3 [lu\u00f2 j\u01d0ng xi\u00e0 sh\u00ed]: to throw stones at sb who fell down a well (idiom); to hit a person who is downLiang Guoming\u2019s transition from an ordinary person to a well-known private entrepreneur showed that he had the means, and the people he had offended were not a few, so many people were waiting for his bad luck.Because it was so popular on the Internet, many print media also started to report the situation. Thus, those who did not use the internet frequently also knew that Liang Guoming was an unjust rich businessman, as well as a real-life Chen Shimei [3].[3] Chen Shimei: a Chinese opera character and a byword in China for a heartless and unfaithful man.Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_ShimeiAfter these incidents, not only did Liang Guoming\u2019s reputation stink, but many of Liang\u2019s product sales were also affected.What\u2019s worse was that the tax bureau began checking Liang\u2019s accounts. Some people who had a friendship with Liang Guoming did not dare participate in this matter. As for the quality of the high-grade residential area built by Liang, the housing quality inspection department intervened and had it re-examined. The final result was not unexpected to all; there were problems with the housings\u2019 quality.The end results showed that there were moths involved in the quality problems of the houses, and they were brought out to report criticism. Since then, some people started to ridicule Liang Guoming as a professional salesman of pit goods and scum men.As the incident became more and more serious, Liang Guoming\u2019s wife, Zhang Fang, stepped forward to forgive her husband\u2019s derailment and accused netizens of meddling. Only she knew how good her husband was. She did not believe any other accusations.Liang Guoming also apologized to his wife in front of the public media. He also said that Liang\u2019s heir will always be Young Master Liang Deyou alone. He quickly mended and filled the previous tax loopholes, then made appropriate compensation to the housing quality.Originally, Liang Guoming, as the legal representative of the company, should\u2019ve been sentenced for the tax refund, tax evasion, and housing quality. However, due to his good attitude of admitting to his mistakes, his making up for the taxes omitted in the past, and his revelation of a medical certificate that showed he was over sixty years of age and had diabetes, he was released on bail after less than a day in detention.Liang Deyou, Liang\u2019s successor, cried in front of the media, saying that his father was old and in poor health. He told them how much suffering his father went through during his youth and how difficult life had been for him. Finally, he asked the media and netizens to let his father go.The netizens who felt sympathy for Zhang Fang and Liang Deyou in the beginning, after seeing this reversal drama, didn\u2019t have the slightest bit of sympathy anymore. Still, others said that Liang Guoming and his family were people favoured by the heavens.\u2018The so-called life is like a play. It all depends on acting skills.\u2019 The Liang family expressed these two sentences incisively and vividly.At the end of the story, although Liang Shi was saved, the whole of Liang Shi\u2019s vitality was badly damaged, and their product market shrunk significantly. In order to gain capital turnover, Liang Guoming even sold several branches under his wings. Only then did he barely sustain the company.Since then, Liang Guoming, a private entrepreneur, fell from the altar. Netizens gave their family new names: Liang Guoming was \u2018Film Emperor Liang\u2019, Liang Deyou was \u2018Crown Prince Liang\u2019, and Liang Guoming\u2019s wife was \u2018Film Emperess Zhang\u2019.The short National Day was as busy as New Year\u2019s Day. Contrary to what others might expect, Lu Chengyu, as the first person to bury funerary dolls [4], had the leisure to go to the farmhouse and, in the name of being close to nature, have fun with Zhuang Yu.[4] \u59cb\u4f5c\u4fd1\u8005 [sh\u01d0zu\u00f2y\u01d2ngzh\u011b]: lit. the first person to bury funerary dolls (idiom) / fig. the originator of an evil practice; the initiator of evil; \u00a0 creator of a bad precedent;Leisurely roasting his own fish on the grill, Lu Chengyu handed cumin to Zhuang Yu, who was sitting next to him. \u201cZhuang-ge,\u00a0the taste of barbeque without cumin is not delicious,\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cPut it on now?\u201d Zhuang Yu looked doubtfully at the fish in his hand, which was cut in a mess. \u201cI recall that you only sprinkle some cumin on it when the fish is almost baked.\u201d\u201cIf not, sprinkle it on now and sprinkle again when the fish is almost baked?\u201d Lu Chengyu was not particularly sure when to turn the fish. When he did, one side of the fish was somewhat charred. \u201cI always felt like there was something wrong.\u201dZhuang Yu nodded. Before, when he came to the farmhouse to have fun, he wouldn\u2019t solely be preoccupied with eating. Originally, he saw Lu Chengyu\u2019s seemingly very professional technique and thought that Lu Chengyu was a master in this, but facts proved that the other party only had the bearings of a professional.Zhang Zeyun, who sat beside Zhuang Yu, had given up on the dark-baked chicken wings in his hands. Looking at how Zhuang Yu and Lu Chengyu was still struggling with the fish, he couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cI say, why on earth do you feel the need to do this to yourself? My whole body now stinks of unpleasant smoke.\u201dZhuang Yu and Lu Chengyu looked up at Zhang Zeyun, then looked at each other. Just now, while they were on the road, they casually said they wanted to grill something with their own hands. The thought that the two of them would suck at it never crossed their minds.After Zhang Zeyun bared the truth to them, both instantly stopped continuing with their original idea. Zhuang Yu threw his fish into the trash can, \u201cForget it, let\u2019s go fishing.\u201dThen Zhang Zeyun and several other friends saw Zhuang Yu and Lu Chengyu, whom they had just met, walking towards the pond. They looked at each other.\u201cI say, Lao Zhuang seems to fit in well with this one named Lu Chengyu,\u201d a friend couldn\u2019t help but start to talk, \u201cThis is really rare. Lao Zhuang has a good eye in choosing friends. Unexpectedly,\u00a0 he made friends with a young man from outside our circle [5] .\u201d[5] circle here means Lu Chengyu isn\u2019t from their rich second generation\u2019s circle.Even in the same circle, there were ordinary friends and close friends. Zhang Zeyun, Zhuang Yu and Yan Mu had been iron brothers for many years. Although they had good relationships with these three people, their friendship was incomparable with these three people\u2019s friendship.\u201cXiao Lu is a good person.\u201d Zhang Zeyun did not tell these friends that Lu Chengyu was the investor of an outstandingly famous film recently, knowing that this film made Zhuang Yu a lot of money. Both of their characters fit together, so it was no surprise that they were able to get along with one another. He laughed and said, \u201cAs long as the person is clean and innocent, who cares about which circle he\u2019s from.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFrom Zhang Zeyun\u2019s words, several others could hear his meaning: he wanted to protect Lu Chengyu. Immediately, they realized that Lu Chengyu wasn\u2019t Zhuang Yu\u2019s little sweetheart but his real friend.Several people immediately stopped talking about this matter and simply went fishing with Lu Chengyu. Their attitudes towards him no longer held superficial politeness, becoming more natural.When Zhuang Yu almost caught a fish, he was interrupted by his bodyguard, who walk from behind to deliver his handphone. Looking sadly at the fish that had fallen off the hook, he took the handphone and said, \u201cMu-ge.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re coming?\u201d Zhuang Yu looked at Lu Chengyu, who was ten meters away from him, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll wait for you to have lunch. You\u2019re in luck, Xiao Lu and I were able to catch some big fish.\u201dZhuang Yu then hung up the handphone and handed it to his bodyguard, his face complicated.\u00a0Mu-ge doesn\u2019t like parties with too many people. Today, he volunteered to come here\u2026The fish in the pond were raised by the owner of the farmhouse. It\u2019s easy to catch a lot of fish. In just an hour, Lu Chengyu caught several big fish.He looked at his watch\u2013it was almost eleven o\u2019clock. Then, Lu Chengyu took his fishing rod, handed it over to the farm staff, and let them cook the fish. He turned and saw that Zhuang Yu was still fishing, so he didn\u2019t disturb him. Instead, he headed to the gazebo by the side of the pond to drink tea.If he didn\u2019t have the experience of being a luxury hotel lobby manager in his past life and didn\u2019t know the manners he must exude so that he doesn\u2019t come off as repugnant to these high-ranking young masters, he might not have been able to get along with these rich second-generations.The skill of communication was not something that could be achieved by only reading the theories, but by time and experience.Although he was very unlucky in his past life, it taught him quite a lot on how to conduct himself while handling affairs. Fortunately, he was able to start his life again. Was there any reason to not let himself live better?\u201cLu Chengyu?\u201dWhen he heard someone calling him, he looked back and saw Yan Mu standing on the steps outside the gazebo with a bag of fresh-looking grapes in his hand.Yan Mu\u2019s appearance wasn\u2019t like his usual image of a somewhat young-looking president. On the contrary, he now looked like an elegant yet down-to-earth men\u2019s wear model from an autumn fashion show.\u201cBoss, did Zhuang-ge also called you here to have fun? Why did you only come now? We\u2019re almost done catching fish,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and ask Yan Mu to come in and sit down, \u201cThese grapes are so fresh. Were they just picked?\u201d\u201cHmm, there was something going on in the morning, so I was late,\u201d Yan Mu replied. Looking away uncomfortably, he put the grapes on the rock table in the gazebo, \u201cEat it if you like.\u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d Lu Chengyu tasted one. It was sweet and juicy, with a little hint of milk flavor. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious. Taste it, boss.\u201dYan Mu silently reached out and peeled off one grape\u2019s skin. Then he put it in his mouth, chewed it at will, and swallowed it.Lu Chengyu spat out the seeds on a piece of paper. He raised his head to see if Yan Mu performed the same action as him. Suddenly, he realized something.\u00a0Is boss the type of person who\u2019ll eat the grape seeds?Zhuang Yu, who was carrying a fish barrel outside the pavilion, looked at the purple and black grapes on the stone table and was stunned for half of the day before he muttered a curse.\u201cFuck, don\u2019t tell Laozi, Laozi\u2019s guess is true?\u201dHe silently wiped his face. Could someone\u2019s mother come and tell him that the man who just ate grapes is not Mu-ge?Didn\u2019t Mu-ge hate fruits with high sugar content?Whoever said that grapes were high sugar content fruits must be a liar.Anyway\u2026 President Mu wouldn\u2019t be like a brother who fell in love for the first time and panic in front of his secret crush, right?Same gender, how can it be love?It must be that his guess was not in the right direction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28Chapter 28: God is fairAt noon, Lu Chengyu looked at the table full of all kinds of farm food, including three dishes made of fish: fish head and tofu soup [1], fish slices boiled in hot sauce [2], and boiled fish with pickled cabbage and chilli [3]. The design and colour were not as exquisite as those made in the hotel, but everyone couldn\u2019t help but swallow their saliva when they saw the dishes. Lu Chengyu could even smell the sour smell from the pickled fish.[1][2][3]\u201cIt\u2019s rare for everyone to get together like this and have a drink. Come, let\u2019s have a toast,\u201d Zhuang Yu said as he raised the wine made by the farmer himself. \u201cSeveral brothers here are already familiar with Xiao Lu, so I don\u2019t need to introduce him again.\u201dThe others chuckled, immediately raising their glasses and making a few jokes. However, from their conversation, they already regarded Lu Chengyu as one of their own.Lu Chengyu was not a person who pretended to be lofty either. When others handed him an olive branch [4] , he was naturally willing to receive it nicely. Standing up, he held his glass with both hands and said, \u201cAs a few here are older than me, I\u2019ll be shameless and call everyone \u2018brother\u2019. I\u2019ll first drink this cup of wine to salute to you brothers.\u201d After he finished, Lu Chengyu tilted his neck and downed his cup.[4] Olive branch = symbol of peace.At this time, everyone here already knew that Lu Chengyu was Yan Mu\u2019s assistant, and that he was a fresh graduate. Therefore, after Lu Chengyu drank the wine, although several people cheered for Lu Chengyu\u2019s refreshing attitude, no one continued to pour wine. Instead, they started to taste the food together and talked about the big and small things that happened recently.\u201cAmong us, the most complacent should be Lao Zhuang and Mu-ge,\u201d Qi Jingfeng was also regarded as one of the top figures in the capital. He had a close relationship with Yan Mu and the other three people. A bit envious of them, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re all successful in business, unlike me. I\u2019m still loafing around with my family\u2019s money to run a small company. Anyhow, the latest famous movie, \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b, has made a lot of money for Lao Zhuang. I heard it almost made over 400 million in the box office. Is it true?\u201dZhuang Yu chuckled a few times, obviously unusually happy, \u201cThis matter was truly unexpected. When I was introduced to this movie, I thought it might make around 100 million in the box office. Who knew it would be so popular?\u201d\u201cCan a movie that cost only a few million to make, make a profit as much as this?\u201d Qi Jingfeng wrinkled his eyebrows, \u201cLast year, the film that I invested in cost several ten of millions for movie production alone. The deficit nearly killed me.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be done about this,\u201d said Zhuang Yu while shaking his head, \u201cTo invest in a movie, you would need both luck and vision . There are two ways to know whether or not the movie will become prominent and sell well at the time of release. One, the movie needs to have meaning in itself, and two, it can\u2019t be like the high-cost ancient costume movies that are in the cinema lately. The audience is already weary of this genre. Who would want to watch shallow and depressing blockbuster movies on the Mid-Autumn Festival?\u300aSoaring Birds\u300bis like fat and greasy meat on a table full of tiny vegetables. How can it not sell well?\u201dAs the investor of the film, Lu Chengyu listened to the conversation with a smile. He had negotiated with Zhuang Yu to delay the premier of \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b. Judging from the current momentum, this movie should make a box office of one billion after it stopped showing in the theaters. The estimate did not include the capital income from selling the movie rights to major TV stations and online broadcasting platforms. He felt comfortable thinking that he would soon become a billionaire.In his previous life, the total box office for \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b was only about 900 million, perhaps because there were no promotions or trailers in the cinema. In this life, he had cooperated with Zhuang Yu, who had made great efforts to publicize this movie. Moreover, because he didn\u2019t try to change the movie\u2019s plot during filming, the movie was more impactful and better in this life. Taking all of this into consideration, it was not surprising that it made more of a profit this time around.\u201cBut this is too evil,\u201d Qi Jingfeng lit a cigarette and place it between his fingertips. He took a breath, but then remembered that Yan Mu and Zhang Zeyun didn\u2019t smoke so he extinguished it. \u201cWho is the investor of this movie? His luck is too good; Laozi is really jealous.\u201d\u201cThat person didn\u2019t wish to disclose their identity, so it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to reveal anything.\u201d Zhuang Yu didn\u2019t look at Lu Chengyu. He pinched a piece of meat from the fish\u2019s belly with his chopsticks and tasted it.\u201cThe fish that Xiao Lu caught is delicious. Have a taste,\u201d he said with a smile.\u201cLaozi just wanted to complain a little. Anyway, whoever earns that money is unlikely to share it with me, so there\u2019s no use in asking.\u201d Qi Jingfeng used his chopsticks to pinch the fish meat and put it in his bowl. He looked at Lu Chengyu and said, \u201cXiao Lu\u2019s level of fishing is higher compared to Lao Zhuang. Lao Zhuang, this time, you have an opponent.\u201d He was a smart man and knew the rules of this circle. Since Zhuang Yu didn\u2019t talk about it, he also would no longer ask.Lu Chengyu smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been fishing since I was a child and have more than ten years of experience. The number of fish that died on my hook can circle this farmhouse.\u201d He tasted the fish. \u201cAnyway, there\u2019s so many fish left. Shall we take them back later?\u201d\u201cFart, you really can brag. Why don\u2019t you say that the number of fish that died on your hook can circle the Earth twice, just like that milk tea slogan.\u201d Zhuang Yu smiled and continued, \u201cNow, we better finish the food on the table first.\u201dZhang Zeyun glanced at Zhuang Yu. He always felt that something was wrong with Zhuang Yu since noon. Throughout the meal, he and Mu-ge\u00a0didn\u2019t interact that much. There was also Mu-ge: he usually preferred the quiet and didn\u2019t like to join the fun, but why did he come today?Lu Chengyu laughed, \u201cThe Earth is too big and my fish is too small. I can\u2019t meet the requirements,\u00a0ah.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0He looked at Yan Mu, who, since the beginning, didn\u2019t touch any other dish besides the fish, and said, \u201cBoss, I think the fried cauliflower with bacon[5] taste good. Try it.\u201d[5]Yan Mu reached out to the dishes with his chopsticks and picked up one cauliflower and a piece of meat. After eating it, he nodded to Lu Chengyu and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me for such a small thing.\u201d said Lu Chengyu with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019ve taken care of me when I got drunk twice. If I am as polite as you are, wouldn\u2019t I have to devote my whole life to you?[6] \u201d His boss was too being polite. As an employee, he was a little flattered.[6] \u4ee5\u8eab\u76f8\u8bb8 [y\u01d0sh\u0113nxi\u0101ngx\u01d4]: to give one\u2019s heart to / to devote one\u2019s life to\u201cCough,\u00a0cough,\u201d Yan Mu suddenly choked on the vegetables, his face quickly turning red. Seeing him so flustered he couldn\u2019t speak*, Lu Chengyu hurriedly scooped a bowl of chicken soup for him to drink. After Yan Mu recovered, Lu Chengyu asked, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d*It\u2019s Yan Mu who couldn\u2019t speak because he\u2019s struggling.Shaking his head calmly, Yan Mu put down the bowl of soup and wiped his mouth with a paper towel, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, thank\u2026\u201d Thinking of what Lu Chengyu just said, he swallowed down the word \u2018you\u2019, and then continued to use his chopsticks to reach for the pickled fish.Seeing how much Yan Mu liked today\u2019s fish, Lu Chengyu raised an eyebrow before turning his head away to pick out what he liked to eat. After all, some people disliked it when others watched them eat. It would be a tragedy if his boss\u2019s good impression of him fell to a negative value over this.Zhang Zeyun saw that Zhuang Yu was looking at Mu-ge\u00a0again. Thus, he couldn\u2019t help but glance at both of them with suspicious eyes.\u00a0Don\u2019t tell me that there\u2019s a conflict between them? But with Mu-ge\u2019s personality, it\u2019s not easy for Lao Zhuang to start a fight with him.After the meal, all the big men in the room were full, their stomachs a bit round. Lu Chengyu looked at the bright autumn sun outside the window and smelled the fragrance of the sweet osmanthus. He turned to Yan Mu and said, \u201cMy colleagues seem to be very satisfied with mooncake for the Mid-Autumn Festival.\u201d\u201cEn,\u201d Yan Mu paused, then asked hesitantly, \u201cWill you still be working in the company in the future?\u201d\u201cWhere would I be working if not in the company?\u201d Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t think much when he first replied. It was only after a few seconds did he understand what Yan Mu was trying to say.\u00a0 The other side thought that since he made a lot of money investing in films, he would be unwilling to work with Huading.\u201cThe other business is just a hobby while working at Huading is my proper job.\u201d said Lu Chengyu in a joking tone. Then he felt the need to show his loyalty to his boss, \u201cI\u2019m also the representative of Q University, Economic Management Branch. If I don\u2019t mix in with the business world in the future, how can I face the alumni, teachers and schoolmates from my alma mater? \u201c\u201cEn, I don\u2019t want you to leave either, \u201c Feeling like his words were a bit inappropriate, Yan Mu added, \u201cYou are a rare good employee, and Huading needs you.\u201d\u201cBoss, you must give me a thick red envelope this year. I will be more motivated if I have money,\u201d\u00a0 said Lu Chengyu with a smile. \u201cCelebrating Chinese New Year without a red envelope is so boring.\u201dYan Mu nodded seriously, \u201cOkay.\u201d He thought for a moment, \u201cAfter this year, I\u2019ll give you a raise.\u201d Lu Chengyu\u2019s working abilities exceeded the level of his salary.Since there were Huading\u2019s products in \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b, the company\u2019s product exposure rate had increased. The data reports following the premier of the movie showed a significant increase of recently sold products, all of which were clearly due to \u300aSoaring Birds\u300b.Under the serious eyes of the other side, Lu Chengyu felt a little embarrassed. He let out a dry cough and pointed to the grape trellis outside, \u201cLet\u2019s go there and have some tea. There\u2019s nothing interesting to do here.\u201dYan Mu stood up and walked two steps towards the door. Seeing that Lu Chengyu was still sitting, he asked, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Lu Chengyu replied while standing up to follow him. On the other side, Zhuang Yu hooked an arm around Lu Chengyu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you. They\u2019ll play mahjong later, and I\u2019m not interested in that. It\u2019s better to follow you both and have a chat for a while.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cOkay.\u201d Lu Chengyu asked the others if they wanted to follow. After hearing that they weren\u2019t joining them, Lu Chengyu also hooked an arm around Zhuang Yu\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dZhuang Yu laughed, pretending to not see Yan Mu eyeing his shoulder, and kept the posture of hooking shoulder to shoulder with Lu Chengyu. He made it all the way to the grape trellis before he released his somewhat stiff arms. He consciously chose a side seat, watching Yan Mu sit between him and Lu Chengyu, and silently accepted the bold guess that he could not believe before.When the tea was half sipped, Zhuang Yu took advantage of Lu Chengyu going to the toilet. He looked at Yan Mu several times, and finally decided to say, \u201cMu-ge, Xiao Lu, he \u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with him?\u201d Yan Mu slowly turned to look at him.Zhuang Yu giggled twice, feeling that he couldn\u2019t continue to ask questions, and said, \u201cHe\u2019s very good.\u201d\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Yan Mu nodded. In a serious tone, he said, \u201cSo, I will train him to become my elite backbone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to cultivate him into an elite.\u201d Zhuang Yu nodded repeatedly, \u201cElites are good.\u201dYan Mu turned the teacup in his hand and continued in a calm voice, \u201cI like him very much, too.\u201dZhuang Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201dAs Yan Mu took a sip of tea, he turned to look at the passageway leading to the toilet. When he saw Lu Chengyu coming from the corner, his lips slightly hooked up, \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201dZhuang Yu opened his mouth, but he didn\u2019t know what to say. Ethically speaking, as a friend, he wanted Yan Mu to find a virtuous and gentle woman to live with for the rest of his life. Emotionally, however, he also hoped that Yan Mu would find a person who was suitable for him. It didn\u2019t matter who that person was, as long as they can be sincere towards each other, do their best to support one another and live a happy life.And he also knew that Lu Chengyu was neither a little white faced [7] person nor a wannabe Phoenix man[8]. From any point of view, Lu Chengyu was popular with the opposite sex. Compared to Lu Chengyu, Mu-ge might be slightly inferior.[7] Little white face: refers to men who only rely on women to provide financial support, or men who rely on their objects, with a derogatory meaning. Ref:\u00a0https://baike.baidu.com/item/\u5c0f\u767d\u8138/79983[8] Phoenix man: refers to a rural boy who marries an urban girl. Ref:\u00a0https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u51e4\u51f0\u7537Fuck, why does it feel like Mu-ge is a toad that wants to eat swan meat [9] ?[9] It\u2019s a metaphor for people who have no self-knowledge and want to get things that are impossible.Zhuang Yu shook his head, then finally just sighed: \u201cXiao Lu is very good, but does he know your thoughts?\u201dYan Mu didn\u2019t say a word after drinking tea, but Zhuang Yu, who was familiar with him, knew that Yan Mu was a serious person. There were advantages to this personality trait, but there were also disadvantages. If these kind of people set their mind on something, don\u2019t talk about eight horses, even sixteen horses couldn\u2019t pull them back and make them change their minds.He sighed again, looking back. There, he saw Lu Chengyu chatting with a young girl not far away from them. The girl seemed very good-looking.Immediately, he looked at Yan Mu with some sympathy.\u201cThat\u2019s his college classmate,\u201d Yan Mu said calmly as he glanced at Zhuang Yu. There was not even half a sign of impatience on his face.\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Zhuang Yu was surprised.\u201cI have seen his graduation photo,\u201d Yan Mu squinted. \u201cThis girl was also in the photo. If they had any feelings, it would have happened long ago.\u201dAlthough he believed in Yan Mu\u2019s memory, Zhuang Yu could not help asking, \u201cWhat if this girl is secretly in love with Xiao Lu, but Xiao Lu doesn\u2019t know?\u201dYan Mu touched the teacup and looked at the girl beside Lu Chengyu. His tone was still calm, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible between them.\u201dWhen Zhuang Yu lamented in his heart, thinking that Yan Mu was still as calm as ever, he sensed a dark shadow flash above him. Looking up, he saw Yan Mu stride towards Lu Chengyu.Che, acting like that, it almost convinced me.He just thought that being secretly jealous was an essential skill for anyone holding a secret love. No matter how powerful Mu-ge\u00a0was, he couldn\u2019t escape the laws of nature.When God created humans, although there were hints of bias, God was fair overall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the few months since he had last seen her, Chen Ya had changed. The air of a green and naive university graduate had been stripped away, leaving the confident and mature figure before him now. Lu Chengyu hadn\u2019t liked any girls in his past life, but Chen Ya was the sort of girl he could appreciate: Someone not arrogant or impatient;\u00a0 who knew what she wanted and how to get it.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for several months. It seems that you\u2019ve been doing well.\u201d Chen Ya took a step back to get a better look, her eyes wandering up and down Lu Chengyu\u2019s body. She smiled and said: \u201cMy mother praised you the other day, saying that you usually call to inquire about her and my father\u2019s health\u2014which is something she can\u2019t say the same about her daughter.\u201dChen Ya had been travelling on a business trip. When she came back, her mother boasted that Lu Chengyu is a warm-hearted and considerate person; which made Chen Ya, as a daughter, feel a little embarrassed.\u201cEvery time I call aunt, she is very energetic. Basically, I feel relieved whenever I hear her voice.\u201d Lu Chengyu knows what sort of character Aunt Du\u2014Chen Ya\u2019s mother\u2014has. While enduring the lowest points of his last life, this aunt often asked Uncle Chen to bring him food. Even weeks before his death, she still fussed over Lu Chengyu\u2019s marriage prospects.Amused by Lu Chengyu\u2019s words, Chen Ya nodded and said, \u201cmy mother is just like that.\u00a0If our fates had entwined, I\u2019m afraid your position in my mother\u2019s heart might surpass mine.\u201c\u201cNow that Sister Ya has become so beautiful and capable, if we lined up all the gentlemen chasing her, it would stretch from the capital all the way to the sea. Don\u2019t waste your time on a toad like me.\u201d Lu Chengyu pointed his finger on top of his head and chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid God would not stand idly by.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Chen Ya crossed her arms under her breasts, thrust one, delicate stiletto-heeled shoe forward, and proudly raised her chin, \u201cyou\u2019d better go bother some other woman.\u201dLu Chengyu half-bowed. \u201cYes, my queen.\u201d When Lu Chengyu raised his head, they laughed at the same time, releasing old feelings and past regrets.Chen Ya looked at this man who wears such a gentle smile. She reminded herself,\u00a0What woman hasn\u2019t fallen into an impossible love at least once in her lifetime? Turn around and let it go. Maybe the next person you meet will be the one that suits you best.\u201cXiao Lu, is this your friend?\u201d When Yan Mu came over, he overheard Lu Chengyu call Chen Ya a queen. He walked up to Lu Chengyu, stood by his side, and nodded in greeting. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Xiao Lu\u2019s colleague.\u201d\u201cHello,\u201d\u00a0Chen Ya noticed an unusual atmosphere between the people in front of her. She guessed that this man might be Lu Chengyu\u2019s boss. Afraid that she would cause trouble for Lu Chengyu, she politely introduced herself, \u201cI\u2019m Lu Chengyu\u2019s classmate. I happened to meet him just now. I hope I\u2019m not bothering you.\u201d\u201cWe also came out to play. Since you are Xiao Lu\u2019s classmate, we might as well go to sit together,\u201d Yan Mu glanced at Lu Chengyu for a moment. \u201cWhy not invite your classmate to sit with us?\u201d\u201cThank you, but there\u2019s no need. We are just chatting.\u201d Aware that the boss seemed to have a good relationship with Lu Chengyu, Chen Ya casually pointed to one side with a smile. \u201cAll of my family is still waiting for me there. I\u2019ll go first.\u201dWhen Lu Chengyu saw that Chen Ya really didn\u2019t want to stay behind, he said, \u201cSend my regards to uncle and aunt.\u201d\u201cI will. Come to my house when you have time.\u201d Chen Ya nodded, said goodbye to Yan Mu and strolled away.Yan Mu looks at Chen Ya\u2019s departing figure and says slowly, \u201cIt seems like your classmate is pretty good.\u201d He could glean the meaning of Chen Ya\u2019s actions, just now. Although he disapproved of her inviting Lu Chengyu to her house; he would not deny that this kind of woman possessed great appeal.After hearing such an ambiguous assessment of his classmate, Lu Chengyu looked Yan Mu up and down, observing him carefully. He hesitated, then said, \u201cUncle and aunt would prefer a son-in-law with a gentle personality who knows well how to express their feelings.\u201d He averted his eyes by looking at the ceiling, \u201cBut if you really are interested, I can\u00a0put in a good word for you.\u201dAfter a long silence, Yan Mu said, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I meant. I don\u2019t have any such intentions.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and nodded, \u201cI understand.\u201dYan Mu saw Lu Chengyu\u2019s smile and suspected that Lu Chengyu hadn\u2019t taken his words seriously. Yan Mu frowned slightly and insisted, \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0really\u00a0not interested.\u201d\u201cI\u00a0really\u00a0understand.\u201d It dawned on Lu Chengyu that Yan Mu really wasn\u2019t interested in Chen Ya, so he said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m just joking boss, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Lu Chengyu pointed in the direction of the restrooms. \u201cAre you going to the toilet?\u201dYan Mu nodded calmly. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t disturb you.\u201d Lu Chengyu waved and watched Yan Mu walk towards the toilet briefly, before turning back to his seat.Zhuang Yu, observing Lu Chengyu\u2019s return, pretended to be indifferent. \u201cYour classmate looks very beautiful. I\u2019m somewhat interested.\u201dLu Chengyu knew that Zhuang Yu liked beauties; moreover, was quite a player. He looked at him warily and said: \u201cMy classmate doesn\u2019t like womanizers.\u201dZhuang Yu\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cI think you\u2019re misunderstanding something\u2026\u201dLu Chengyu smiled at him and said: \u201cI just said it casually; don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d While thinking,\u00a0I will listen to whatever you have to say, but I will absolutely not believe you.\u201cForget it,\u201d Zhuang Yu waved, \u201cI prefer a sister with big boobs.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded: \u201cOh.\u201dZhuangyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, when the sun\u2019s heat had lessened, the three of them went to the garden to pick vegetables.Zhuang Yu looked at the vegetable field surrounded by fences and strange smells. He hesitated to step in and turned around to see that both Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu had already entered. He couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cHey, you really want to do this yourselves?\u201dYan Mu bent over and pulled out a green vegetable. He looked up at Zhuang Yu and said, \u201cI never thought that you would ask such a trivial question.\u201dZhuang Yu became speechless.\u00a0It\u2019s here! Mu-ge\u2019s taunting skill is here!\u201cAsking a question even though you know the answer is disrespectful,\u201d said Yan Mu. He plucked another small green vegetable and shook mud from its roots. \u201cEven a child in primary school would know better.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgRendered speechless, Zhuang Yu entered the vegetable field, mopping sweat from his brow. Perhaps his biggest mistake was not to ask a rhetorical question, but to be overheard by Mu-ge\u00a0talking about boobs.If someone complimented another man in front of a girl that he liked, he\u2026would probably get upset?Thinking like this, Zhuang Yu suddenly felt that Yan Mu was pitiful. How lamentable that Yan Mu can\u2019t confess to his secret crush! He should not argue with such a pitiful person.Because of the content of their conversation, Lu Chengyu couldn\u2019t help but look up from harvesting to watch these two friends bicker. Then, he discovered that Zhuang Yu, unexpectedly, was actually smiling. Lu Chengyu couldn\u2019t help but think that the world of the wealthy was truly weird. After being mercilessly mocked by a friend, Zhuang Yu was still capable of being this happy\u2014what kind of illness was this?The group amused themselves around the farmhouse until the evening. After supper, they made preparations to return home.Lu Chengyu walked up to the car and was about to open the door when he noticed Yan Mu approaching. Hand resting on the door handle, he asked: \u201cBoss, is there anything?\u201dYan Mu touched one of the pockets of his suit absentmindedly. His eyes avoided Lu Chengyu\u2019s confused gaze, \u201cI heard that the movie was selling well. I asked someone to book two tickets for me yesterday. If you haven\u2019t seen it, would you mind accompanying me? \u201cAnd here he thought it was something important when he saw the other side\u2019s serious expression. Lu Chengyu said with a smile, \u201cPerfect timing. I was also planning to go watch the film. You\u2019ve saved me the trouble of having to buy a ticket!\u201dIn fact, as an investor, Lu Chengyu had been given complimentary\u00a0tickets. However, since the boss had already purchased tickets, if he said he didn\u2019t need one wouldn\u2019t he be trampling on good intentions?\u201cHmm, the company\u2019s product sales have increased significantly in recent days. The film had a great influence.\u201d Yan Mu took a movie ticket out of his pocket and gave it to Lu Chengyu. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dTheoretically, Yan Mu did not seem like a person who would be interested in this kind of movie. But if it was a matter of sales volume, then everything made a lot more sense.Noticing that Yan Mu seemed ready to take his own car, Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t pursue the topic. He opened the front passenger door for Yan Mu, then went around and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat. Moments later, they were on their way.Yan Mu sat quietly in the front passenger seat, observing Lu Chengyu\u2019s profile. After a while, he turned to watch the neon lights of the street flash past. He didn\u2019t know why he developed an affection for a young man six or seven years his junior\u2014but he wasn\u2019t shocked or embarrassed.In this life, how many people had he met that he genuinely liked?The car stopped at a red light and, noticing that Yan Mu remained silent, Lu Chengyu began to search for topics that would enliven the atmosphere. \u201cThere used to be a delicious hot pot shop on this road. But the owner had to close it.\u201d His father and mother particularly enjoyed going there to eat hotpot. But even after the shop shuttered and the boss left, Lu Chengyu and his parents would still reminisce about the shop whenever they passed by. \u201cHow long has Boss been abroad? How do foreign hot pot shops taste?\u201d\u201cI stayed abroad for seven or eight years.\u201d Yan Mu turned his attention from the pedestrians on the street only to catch traces of nostalgia in Lu Chengyu\u2019s expression. It seems that this street reminded him of something bittersweet. He struggled to find words that would make the other party feel better, but he lacked experience in this area. He could only mechanically answer the question he was asked. \u201cThe hot pot abroad doesn\u2019t taste good. Later, after I returned, I had gastrointestinal problems because I liked domestic hot pot too much.\u201d\u201cBoss, you too have times when you\u2019re in such a mess?\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu with surprise, then he saw the traffic light change. Pressing the accelerator again, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very normal that people who come back from abroad will feel that domestic food is the most delicious food on earth.\u201d Seeing Lu Chengyu\u2019s recovery, Yan Mu continued to talk about his own troubles abroad, \u201cWhile overseas, a friend brought a bag of hot pot ingredients from home, and we were all reluctant to finish it up.\u201d\u201cOn TV, aren\u2019t rich people often using airplanes to fly food and fruit across the sea? Yet this bag of hot pot ingredients was your only supply?\u201d Lu Chengyu said with a smile, \u201cBoss, you are too down-to-earth.\u201dYan Mu thought for a moment, \u201cI don\u2019t know many people who would do such a thing. Even if they did, they are not in the same circle as us.\u201dListening to Yan Mu, Lu Chengyu sighed. \u201cI was misled by the rich people depicted in novels and TV series, again.\u201d\u201cThe rich people on TV are probably looking for attention in the first place\u2014but there are people like that,\u201d Yan Mu consoled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to care too much.\u201d\u201cPoof,\u201d Lu smiled. \u201cI stopped caring.\u201dYan Mu, with his serious personality, can be really interesting, Lu Chengyu thought, then lamented internally:\u00a0Such a good man has remained single for 8 years\u2014this is truly a great sin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After the tickets were checked, they went in, found their place, and took a seat. Even though advertisements played on the big screen, almost all the seats around them were full of people.Lu Chengyu was somewhat moved. He looked at Yan Mu, who was by his side and said, \u201cIt is already past 10 p.m yet this place is full of people.\u201dSitting next to him was a young girl with a big bucket of popcorn. Hearing Lu Chengyu\u2019s words, she turned her head and looked at him. \u201cYou think this is worth mentioning? Even at midnight, this place will have a full house.\u201d\u201cSo popular?\u201d Lu Chengyu looked surprised, \u201cAre you exaggerating?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t watched it either, but every day my friend keeps mentioning how popular the movie is on Weibo. I couldn\u2019t help but come watch it.\u201d The girl glances between Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu. Seeing that the movie was about to start, she stopped talking and shifted her attention back to the screen.The movie began on a bustling street. The camera eventually focused on one of the storm-sewer grates. A second later, a hand suddenly emerged. It flailed about urgently for a moment, then retracted. Before the audience could conclude that this was a scene out of a thriller, the camera lowered and turned so the situation beyond the grate could be seen.Inside, the sorry figure of a man lying prone on his stomach appeared. His arms were wrapped around his waist protectively, and he swore under his breath using a non-standard Mandarin dialect, \u201cTo hell! This evil God!\u201d As soon as those curses left his mouth, heavy rain suddenly began falling, flooding the narrow space where he lay.Listening to the laughter all around him, Lu Chengyu couldn\u2019t help but turn to examine Yan Mu\u2019s expression. He felt like he was sitting at the juncture of two worlds. In one world, there existed many smiling people being entertained; and in the other, there was Yan Mu, who observed everything studiously.Some people watched movies to pass the time or to spend that time with loved ones, his boss, however, watched movies to understand how they could advertise his company\u2019s products effectively.Is this the difference between successful people and ordinary people?\u00a0Lu Chengyu wondered.From the beginning of the movie to the end, the cinema echoed with the sounds of laughter. Even Lu Chengyu, who had already seen the movie once, still found himself chuckling during certain scenes. However, throughout the film, Yan Mu sat upright and did not smile even once.\u201cIf you are okay, please stand up.\u201d On the big screen, the young man with gold glasses bent slightly, his white hands stretched out, which made quite a contrast with the bustling but uncaring crowd going about their business in the background.When this handsome face and that\u00a0bedraggled\u00a0protagonist appeared in the same frame, they formed an even sharper contrast.Lu Chengyu listened to the hushed voices of the girls behind him giggling and squealing happily and surreptitiously touched his face. The lighting used in the movie was good, which made him look handsome.Back on screen, with a smile, Mr. Perfect got into his car. He took out an exquisite handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his hands thoroughly\u2014even though the\u00a0downtrodden\u00a0male protagonist hadn\u2019t touched him at all.After wiping his hands, he threw the handkerchief aside, an expression of disgust on his face. He started the engine and roared off without looking back.Left behind, the male protagonist holding a single yuan coin happily ran to buy steamed buns.Finally, the camera gives a clear shot of the back of Mr. Perfect\u2019s car. There is a terrible black palm print marring the otherwise spotless fender belonging to a car worth tens of millions of yuan.The audience found the picture unexpectedly comical and laughed again. This time, Yan Mu frowned, then opened his mouth and said: \u201cIf this kind of thing happens, the owner can\u00a0demand an investigation and sue for damages.\u201dLu Chengyu was still enjoying the memory of his own handsome performance. When he heard those words, he could tell that Yan Mu was advocating for his on-screen character. Lu Chengyu laughed and said: \u201cThis is just movie melodrama. Don\u2019t take it seriously. In reality, which ordinary person would dare to lay their hands on such an expensive car? Wouldn\u2019t that be asking for trouble?\u201dYan Mu heard someone at the back praising Lu Chengyu\u2019s role as very handsome. He thought about it for a moment. \u201cThey are right.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Lu Chengyu.\u201cYou look good in glasses,\u201d said Yan Mu with his eyes on the screen, \u201cIt suits you very much.\u201dLu Chengyu touched his chin and hedged, \u201cWell, it\u2019s all the credit of the camera, lighting, and post-production effects.\u201dAiyo! [1] He felt a bit shy being praised so directly by his big boss.[1] \u54ce\u54df [\u0101iy\u014d]: hey | ow | ouch\u2014an interjection of pain or surprise.The movie that began with laughter also ended with laughter. Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu walked out of the cinema surrounded by couples and intimate partners. He sighed. \u201cWe are surrounded by lovers.\u201dYan Mu looks at him, puzzled. \u201cSurrounded by lovers?\u201dThinking that the other side didn\u2019t understand his self-deprecation, he changed the topic. \u201cNevermind. I\u2019ll take you back.\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201d Yan Mu nodded, suppressing his feelings before they could affect his behaviour. After getting into the car, he told him his address.\u201c Ming Chong Community?[2] \u201d This place was a gathering place for dignitaries. If someone in the community with an ordinary family background went out walking, they would definitely find it embarrassing to greet anyone they met.[2] Ming Chong Community: \u660e [m\u00edng]: bright | wise | a sacrifice to the gods, and \u5d07 [ch\u00f3ng]: high | sublime | lofty | to esteem | to worship.Even the community name gives a powerful and domineering feeling! Its management must be very strict.\u00a0Lu Chengyu suddenly lamented, \u201cI think my car may be stopped by the guard.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d said Yan Mu. After pausing, he added, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dLu Chengyu laughed. After he drove the car for quite some distance, he said, \u201cBoss, fortunately, I\u2019m not a girl.\u201dYan Mu looked at him.\u201cIf you talk to a woman like this, she would definitely misunderstand you.\u201d Lu Chengyu turned the car around a corner, so he did not see Yan Mu\u2019s expression change. By the time he straightened the wheel again, Yan Mu\u2019s expression had long recovered.When Lu Chengyu, who drove a small Benteng [3] worth less than 100,000 yuan, entered the Ming Chong community, Yan Mu rolled down the window. The guard saw him and buzzed them through the motorized gate.[3] Y\u012bq\u00ec B\u0113nt\u00e9ng : Later known as\u00a0Besturn. A Chinese car brand similar to the Mazda 6. Manufactured by the\u00a0FAW Group.The community was built near the river, consisting almost entirely of detached villas with more than one floor and a yard. Lu Chengyu drove to the front of Yan Mu\u2019s house.After seeing the villa with a small garden and garage, Lu Chengyu smacked his lips. The local developer where he lived calls it a high-grade neighborhood. This is also a high-grade neighborhood\u2014but they are worlds apart.Yan Mu got out of the car and walked over to Lu Chengyu\u2019s side of the window. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Stay here tonight and go back tomorrow.\u201dLu Chengyu put his head out the window, shook his head, and said, \u201cNo need. It won\u2019t take long for me to get back home from here. And in any case, tomorrow is a holiday. It doesn\u2019t matter if I go to sleep late tonight.\u201d\u201cOkay, be careful on your way.\u201d Yan Mu stepped back. Lu Chengyu stretched his hand out the window and waved goodbye.\u00a0 Yan Mu wanted to say something but hesitated. He ended up watching the Benteng drive off into the distance.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHe stood there for a while, then took out his cell phone and called Zhang Zeyun.\u201cZeyun, the fish you brought back for me today, have you put it in the refrigerator?\u201d He paused, listening intently. \u201cOkay, thank you.\u201dYan Mu went inside the house. He turned on the lights in the living room; judging by the state of the room, the cleaners had been by. He changed his shoes and went to open the refrigerator. In addition to the two fish, there are a handful of green vegetables which they had picked together earlier in the day.After closing the refrigerator door, he stuck a hand in his pocket and discovered that the ticket he bought for the movie was still there. After looking at the movie ticket for quite some time, he stood up and went back to his bedroom.How good would it be\u2026 if only Lu Chengyu was here.\u2665 \u2665As soon as Lu Chengyu got home, he turned on his computer to check in on the Liang family\u2019s affairs.Sure enough, Liang Shi Corporation hired social media influencers to convey their message of contrition and goodwill\u2014that the company had recognized its mistakes and were prepared to reform their behaviour.At the same time, these influencers also spread many different incidences of corruption and irresponsible behaviour involving other companies. Between companies that don\u2019t take responsibility for their misdeeds and one that does, the Liang Shi Corporation had conjured a positive image for themselves out of thin air.Liang Shi Corporation\u2018s public relations response to the Internet crisis was a little bit slow but their methods would likely have been effective.\u00a0However, the effectiveness of this strategy relied on the three Liang family members keeping quiet on social media, which, of course, was impossible. Because of their responses to the netizens\u2019 criticism, they had managed to thwart Liang Shi\u2019s public relations campaign.Now, when someone says something positive about the Liang family, the netizens will instead sarcastically ask questions like, \u201cHow high is the salary working for\u00a0Liang Shi Corporation?\u201d or \u201cWhat sort of acting credentials are required to get hired by Liang\u00a0Shi Corporation?\u201dSeeing these kinds of remarks, Lu Chengyu couldn\u2019t help laughing.The cell phone on his desk began ringing. A glance at the call-display before he picked up revealed it was Yan Mu on the line.\u201cBoss?\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d said Lu Chengyu with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. Please rest assured.\u201dAfter hanging up, Lu Chengyu put his cell phone aside, shook his head, and said to himself, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that the boss looked serious yet had a very conscientious\u00a0 mind.\u201dI didn\u2019t expect that this expressionless boss of mine would be such a worrywart.Sometimes there are many inconsistencies between a person\u2019s appearance and their true self\u2014this remains true for all humankind. But when considering Yan Mu, the inconsistencies are even larger. Even if Lu Chengyu worked at a hotel for several years in his past life, he still could not see their true self when he met someone like Yan Mu.\u00a0But such a person, once they become your friend, would treat you so well that even the Heavens would become jealous.Resolving not to think about Yan Mu any longer tonight, Lu Chengyu posted some more juicy gossip about the Liang family\u2019s misbehaviour, such as how many girlfriends Liang Deyou had made in the past and how domineering he acted.\u201cIf there\u2019s a problem with the upper beam, the lower beam must be crooked [4].\u201d Lu Chengyu felt that the most amazing thing about Liang Deyou is not that he managed to control Liang Shi in the future, but that such a philanderer ended up becoming so infatuated with Chen Jin.[4] \u4e0a\u6881\u4e0d\u6b63\u4e0b\u6881\u6b6a [sh\u00e0ngli\u00e1ngb\u00f9zh\u00e8ngxi\u00e0li\u00e1ngw\u0101i]: lit. If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked (idiom); fig. Subordinates imitate their superiors\u2019 vices.As far as he knew, those unscrupulous, rich second generations will try to find a suitable marriage partner, afterward, would both then find others[5] to have fun. As for the words like infatuation or loyalty, they are mosaicked in their dictionary, which can not be found even with high-power electron microscopes.[5] like a boyfriend or boy toy or girlfriend, \u2018others\u2019 besides their marriage partnerFor Liang Deyou to break his habit of messy relationships, really don\u2019t know if it is Chen Jin that\u2019s impressive or that Liang Deyou is just too infatuated.Lu Chengyu opened his Weibo and watched the number of his fans increase by several hundred thousand. After a little thought, he sent a post.[May you be blessed year after year] : Today is the last day of the National Day holiday. Students who have not finished their homework during the holiday should hurry up to finish their homework. You should take note that scrolling Weibo will not make you a top scholar and the homework will not be completed automatically.\u201dIn fact, occasionally reminding these fans to study hard and make progress every day is quite enjoyable.After turning off the computer, Lu Chengyu made a phone call to the executive producer and director Zhang, asking them to help invite the whole drama group to the Jiahua Hotel for the celebration banquet. After getting a positive reply, he hung up.Later on, he will be investing in the film industry, so he needs to show his attitude. For example, in addition to the originally negotiated salary and remuneration, everyone should be given a bonus or something.Although he\u2019s spending more money, at least he can form a good relationship. In the future, he can expect more good works.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he was now a very popular actor with a lot of producers and directors looking for him, the more popular he was, the more careful he became. And the politer he was to the other crew members from the production, afraid that he would appear complacent to others.Zhang Shuo looked at the time and found that most of the crew had arrived ahead of time. Among the invited members, only the female lead and the third male lead were still not here. He was not upset. Anyway, now that the film has been released, for these actors to still remember their good relationship with the crew, then it can already be said that they cherish old friendships.If they were unwilling to come, he also wouldn\u2019t force them.\u00a0 After all, both money and goods have been settled, no one owes anyone. If worse comes to worst, after this, he just wouldn\u2019t work with people like them again.\u201cDirector Zhang, I heard that Mr. Lu is coming in person later. Shall we toast Mr. Lu together? If it wasn\u2019t for him, this movie would surely have been cancelled.\u201d Gao Boyang and Zhang Shuo had a somewhat personal relationship, adding on the fact that his face was rather common and his temperament was simple, he hadn\u2019t been able to make a name for himself even after being in the entertainment circle all these years. So when Zhang Shuo spoke to him about this role and hoped that he would star in it, Gao Boyang agreed right away.Later, Gao Boyang heard that they didn\u2019t have enough funds and Director Zhang might have to give up making this movie. He felt that it was a pity for a while but didn\u2019t expect that they soon found an investor afterward. Now, Director Zhang and Screenwriter Qu were both famous, and even he himself had become a well-known actor. Therefore, Mr. Lu was completely worthy of being called their production crew\u2019s saviour.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to toast, but you can\u2019t make him drunk.\u201d Zhang Shuo was also elated because of the movie sales recently, and his temper became better than before, \u201cMr. Lu is different from us, he still has to get to work on time tomorrow.\u201dAlthough there were more than a dozen people in this room that wanted to ask about Mr. Lu\u2019s real identity, they remember that Director Zhang once told them not to disclose the fact that Mr. Lu was the investor at will, even implying that if they spoke any nonsense, they may not be able to walk in this circle anymore. They already had a vague guess, that even if Mr. Lu\u2019s identity wasn\u2019t complicated, there must be someone around him whose background was.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Director Zhang. Mr. Lu is still a young man, but drinking and being drunk will hurt his health,\u201d said Gao Boyang smiling. \u201cBecause of Director Zhang and Screenwriter Qu, we are blessed with good fortune. We have more work compared to before, it will be troublesome if we get drunk and miss our work as well.\u201dEveryone began to continuously praise and brainlessly flatter Zhang Shuo and Gao Boyang. No one here was a fool. Gao Boyang will be very popular after this and there is no need to mention Director Zhang, he will definitely shoot a lot of movies in the future. If they wanted to act under Director Zhang, then they needed to act smart.\u2663\u2663When Lu Chengyu opened the door of the private room, he heard the supporting actress boasting that he acted out his role very well. He immediately put a smile on his face and said, \u201cI heard the beauty boasting of my handsome appearance as soon as I entered the door, this is indeed a good omen.\u201d Although the second female lead had fewer camera scenes, after the movie got popular, her face became familiar in the entertainment circle. Moreover, this actress was a brave person who was willing to risk her life; several years later, she will become a mainstay of the big screen.Zhu Yuxue didn\u2019t think that Mr. Lu would happen to hear her words, she immediately used a joking tone and said: \u201cMr. Lu originally already looked handsome. Could it be that it\u2019s still embarrassing for others to mention it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m finished! Being praised by the most beautiful person in our group, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be beaten by our group\u2019s men when I go out.\u201d He chuckled and sat down on the empty seat beside Qu Lingbei. He looked at all the people seated around the table and discovered that the third male lead, Zhou Xuyu and the female lead, Lin Mengmeng, were not here. Pretending that he didn\u2019t notice, Lu Chengyu said, \u201cI just ordered two bottles of good wine. Let\u2019s all have a drink together later.\u201dEveryone hurriedly responded to him. When the dishes were served together, everyone found that the cost of these dishes were somewhat astonishing. Immediately they realized that Mr. Lu really did come here to celebrate with them, rather than just to put on airs like other investors would.\u201cThis glass of wine is my toast to everyone.\u201d Lu Chengyu stood up and looked at everyone there with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m going to say something that might be in poor taste, but if it weren\u2019t for you all, I would not have been able to earn this much money. Everyone here are Lu Chengyu\u2019s lucky stars. If I invest in movies again in the future and need your help, I hope you can still keep old friendships in mind and will help me out again.\u201dIt was almost obvious that he was telling everyone that he will continue investing in movies and if there are any suitable roles for anyone here, he will give them a priority consideration. Compared to giving them a bonus or just thanking them, telling them this was much more useful. Gao Boyang and the other actors and actresses all stood up and raised their glasses to show that there wouldn\u2019t be a problem.Lu Chengyu clinked his glass with everyone, sat down and spoke to Qu Lingbei, who sat beside him, \u201cScreenwriter Qu, Director Zhang, if you have any new movies to shoot, you have to think of me first.\u201d\u201cMr. Lu is willing to believe in us. Of course, we are most willing to cooperate with Mr. Lu as well.\u201d Although Director Zhang had a quick temper, he was actually very clear-minded. Lu Chengyu was generous and didn\u2019t like to meddle in the production team\u2019s work.\u00a0 Moreover, Lu Chengyu was the kind of person who he could exchange views with. With just these three huge advantages, the other investors in the entertainment circle already couldn\u2019t compare with Lu Chengyu. If they could cooperate with Lu Chengyu, why would they find others only to make themselves unhappy?\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Lu Chengyu said with a smile. \u201cThen the three of us must have a toast.\u201dZhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei both raised their glasses with a smile and clinked them with Lu Chengyu, their hearts more at ease than before.At the end of the celebration, Lu Chengyu gave everyone red envelopes. After everyone left with a smile on their faces, he turned to Qu Lingbei and Zhang Shuo, who were still with him and said, \u201cYou two are the biggest contributors to this movie. I have nothing to reciprocate. So when I get the actual box office income after the movie is offline, I will give you an extra 1% of the profits. You are not allowed to give a cold shoulder to my tawdry gifts.\u201dIt was estimated there will be more than 300 million in profit for this movie, so 1 percent of that will be at least more than 3 million. When they signed the contract with Lu Chengyu, they had signed the salary clause instead of the dividend clause. Now, however, Lu Chengyu was willing to give them extra money, which was really unexpected to them.Originally, they thought that it was already kind of Lu Chengyu to give them a big red envelope, but they didn\u2019t expect that he would go to this extent.\u201cMr. Lu, we have already signed the terms in the contract before. How can we accept it if you do this?\u201d Although they were moved by the money, sometimes thinking of nothing but personal gains can destroy a lot of things. Qu Lingbei smiled and tactfully declined, \u201cIf Mr. Lu wants to express gratitude to us, just give us a big investment the next time we cooperate.\u201d\u201cThat, of course, is a given. Afterwards, both of you will become well-known nationwide as a gold medal director and a gold medal screenwriter, I\u2019m afraid that others will compete with me.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and shook his head, \u201cBut you have to take this one percent profit. It\u2019s my sincerity. If you don\u2019t accept it, it is the same as if you are looking down on me.\u201d\u201cMr. Lu is so generous, we feel too embarrassed to refuse you again.\u201d Zhang Shuo didn\u2019t think as much compared to Qu Lingbei. He could feel that Lu Chengyu was sincere in expressing gratitude to both of them, so he said, \u201cOld Qu and I thank you.\u201dUpon seeing this, Qu Lingbei had no other option besides thanking Lu Chengyu after Zhang Shuo. Seeing that Lu Chengyu now feels a bit closer towards them, the worry inside his heart disappeared without trace. Even though Mr. Lu was young, he was really a good man.\u2663\u2663The three of them walked out of the hotel side by side. Because they knew that they would be drinking alcohol, none of them drove here. As it was mid-day, it was not easy to catch a taxi, so they ended up standing on the street and began discussing the next movie.Even when a grey Porsche stopped in front of them, they didn\u2019t give it a second glance.\u201cI heard Mr. Lu began to mix in the entertainment circle,\u201d Liang Deyou\u2019s head stretched out from the window, his face more depressed than before. Glancing at Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei\u2019s unimpressive look and clothes, he felt disdain towards them, \u201cCould it be that you can\u2019t mingle in the company, so you began to rely on acting?\u201d\u201cMy acting skill can\u2019t be compared with Mr. Liang,\u201d Lu Chengyu beamed with a smile and continued, \u201cAt most, I can only act as a minor supporting actor. If Mr. Liang wished to join the entertainment business, with Mr. Liang\u2019s appearance, Mr. Liang can certainly become a movie emperor.\u201dLiang Deyou\u2019s face changed, he knew that Lu Chengyu was laughing at what had happened in his family. Liang Deyou rushed out from his car and pointed towards Lu Chengyu\u2019s nose, \u201cWhat did you say? If you dare, say it again!\u201d\u201cSince you demanded it, if I don\u2019t satisfy you, it will be as if I\u2019m not giving you face.\u201d Lu Chengyu chuckles, \u201cI said, \u2018Mr. Liang has a good appearance, if Mr. Liang enters the entertainment industry, you will surely become a movie emperor.\u2019\u201d\u201cI ****\u00a0your mother,\u201d Liang Deyou suddenly raised his fist and pounced towards Lu Chengyu. Lu Chengyu slightly moved to the side and kicked Liang Deyou to the ground. Seeing that he couldn\u2019t get up due to pain, Lu Chengyu looked down with a smile and said, \u201cAll my life, what I hate the most is when others curse my mother, especially someone like you.\u201dDue to the pain, Liang Deyou had difficulty breathing. He looked up and saw that Lu Chengyu\u2019s eyes were full of ridicule for himself. Now, he felt like he had to tear up and stomped on this person in front of him in order to solve his hatred, \u201cLu Chengyu, you wait and see.\u201d He stood up from the ground, without even caring to pat off the dust from the ground, he took out his mobile phone and called the police to report that he was assaulted on the streets.Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei felt that the situation was not right. Knowing that Lu Chengyu was beating Young Master Liang, they were worried. Zhang Shuo even protected Lu Chengyu by standing in front of him, he stretched his neck and said, \u201cClearly it was you who punched first, your good idea is to call the police?\u201dLiang Deyou didn\u2019t look at Zhang Shuo. For him, Zhang Shuo was just an ordinary passerby. Although the current Liang Family was not as good as before, to deal with Lu Chengyu it was more than enough. He even made plans that when the police arrived, he would put on a show of how bad he had been beaten. This way, Lu Chengyu might not only need to waste a lot of money but also go to the bureau for a few days of education.\u201cDirector Zhang, you don\u2019t have to reason with this kind of person,\u201d Lu Chengyu said with a smile. \u201cEven the dog who\u2019s acting in a movie can understand people\u2019s words better than this kind of person.\u201d He looked at Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei guiltily, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I got both of you involved.\u201dAlthough the situation was quite serious, Qu Lingbei still couldn\u2019t help but laugh. This was because his family\u2019s dog, which was adopted at the Love Pet Center on his daughter\u2019s birthday, didn\u2019t have any problems aside from hearing.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHe shook his head: \u201cSince Mr. Lu treats us as friends, how can he say sorry to his friends for such things?\u201dLu Chengyu looked at both of them and felt warmed. While smiling, he said,\u00a0 \u201cI was wrong. I hope you two don\u2019t mind.\u201dLiang Deyou glared at Qu Lingbei, then turned to Lu Chengyu and said, \u201cYou who have no father, no mother, and no education can only mix with these kinds of people, I pei[1] .\u201d[1] \u5478 [p\u0113i]: pah! / bah! / pooh! / to spit (in contempt)When Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei heard this, they were angry at first, then they immediately froze. What does this Young Master Liang mean? What \u201cno father, no mother?\u201dThe smile on Lu Chengyu\u2019s face disappeared after Liang Deyou said that. He looked at Liang Deyou coldly, with an unprecedented calm expression.Some passersby have also noticed the conflict between the four people. Some people recognized that Lu Chengyu was the Mr. Perfect, who was very popular recently. So after the three people left the hotel, there were female fans secretly filming them in secret. They didn\u2019t expect that while they were only casually filming the handsome guy that Young Master Liang would also get involved.From the very beginning, the girl who took the video secretly thought that Young Master Liang was a bit aggressive. Now that she heard the other side call the police and even scolded Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents, she felt that this Young Master Liang was somewhat loathsome. Acting such a man-like dog, how could he speak so unculturedly?But\u2026 the male god has lost both his parents?Now that he\u2019s taken to the police station with Young Master Liang, who had both authority and power, will he be retaliated against?Her close friend had already scolded out in a low voice: \u201c**** his sister. This Young Master Liang is too shameless. It\u2019s clear that he started it first, and the male god only defended himself and fought back. How could he do such a disgusting thing?\u201dIn a fit of anger, she took out her mobile phone and posted it on Weibo.[Forever 18 Girl]: Currently witnessing a case of a second rich generation bullying a male god. Young master, are you not willing to be the second generation, ready to take over your father\u2019s position as a movie emperor?At the end of the post, there was an address of their current location.As soon as it was published, it was quickly forwarded by Weibo dedicated to picking up entertainment gossip. Nowadays, in the circle, there were a lot of men who could be called the \u2018Male God,\u2019 so we couldn\u2019t guess which \u2018Male God\u2019 it was. But to be a rich second generation while being connected to a \u201cMovie Emperor,\u201d most netizens knew who it was.For a while, various entertainment forums and Weibo became lively again. There were also people who were close to the site of the accident. After seeing the Weibo, they grabbed their phones and ran outside, hoping to be able to witness this happening.\u2663\u2663Thus, when the police arrived, Lu Chengyu and the other three were already surrounded by a lot of onlookers. At first, having received orders not to be polite to Lu Chengyu, they were planning to teach him a lesson. But when they finally arrived, they felt that something was amiss. So, instead of handcuffing anyone, the police were courteous and just politely asked everyone to board the police car.When the car drove away, the police also heard people in the crowd shouting \u201crich second generation is bullying people,\u201d along with other words. They could not help but secretly wipe away some sweat.Several policemen exchanged glances with each other, knowing that if this matter was not handled properly, they would be punished. So they turned to the four people and said, \u201cFor this matter, we need to invite everyone to the police station and to take each person\u2019s statement. If you need to hire a lawyer and so on, you can contact them now.\u201dLiang Deyou sneered, took out his mobile phone and began to make a call.The policeman who spoke gave a dry laugh and did not speak. In his heart, he had the impulse to fling mud in the face of this arrogant second generation.\u201cThank you very much,\u201d Lu Chengyu said with a wry smile. His face was a little pale. After hesitating for a while, he took out his mobile phone and made a phone call.Seeing this, the policeman sighed silently in his heart. Just by looking at the two men\u2019s respective attitudes, he could guess some of the ins and outs. He turned his head, sighed at his companion, and felt some sympathy for the young man behind him who looked innocent and pure.His companion, however, inexplicably thought the young man, who looked so well-behaved, seemed familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere before.Where was it?After hearing that Lu Chengyu was taken away by the police and needed a lawyer, Yan Mu contacted a gold medal lawyer and drove straight to the police station with the man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although they have brought the people back, the internet has become lively. Just take a look at what was written on the internet; such as,\u00a0\u2018The rich second generation failed to commit a crime on the street, but he collaborated with the police to bully the top student of a famous school\u2019\u00a0or\u00a0\u2018Why can the rich second generation just call for an arrest after committing a crime on the street?\u2019\u00a0If this matter doesn\u2019t get handled properly, it would become a\u00a0\u2018The police and the rich second generation joined hands to bully the common people\u2019.The bureau chief, who already did not have much hair on his head, held a teacup as he became so anxious that he almost lost all the hair on his head. On one side, those from higher up hinted at him to clean up those people who were blind enough to cross Young Master Liang; while on the other, they were facing the aggressive public opinions online. Offending either side would be a big deal.\u201cYoung Master Liang said he was injured. You all go and take a picture of his injury, that can be used to shut people\u2019s mouths on the internet,\u201d The bureau chief suddenly remembered the case\u2019s report. Young Master Liang had said he was kicked by the other side. If it was like that, there would be some traces of the injury.When the forensic personnel found Liang Deyou, they took off his clothes and carefully looked for an injury. As a result, not to mention any bruising, there was not even a piece of skin falling off. Only the clothes were stained with some dust but nothing else could be seen. Suddenly, they felt somewhat awkward, so they sent Liang Deyou to the nearby hospital for another examination. The results of the examination came out: the young master\u2019s internal organs were in good condition, without any damage, and there were no signs of having been assaulted.Having been tossed around like this, the forensic personnel was a bit unhappy. Obviously, Young Master Liang was just pretending to be injured to give trouble to the other person. Just by looking at that honest, delicate and elegant young man called Lu Chengyu\u2026 It didn\u2019t seem like he would be able to kick Liang Deyou.If you wanted to make trouble\u2026 you still have to act a bit better. It\u2019s hard for them to do this without any evidence.In fact, comparing their age and strength, Young Master Liang seemed more like a person who would start a fight. As soon as the police car came back to the station, they saw that there were two more cars in the parking lot, a Bentley and a Maybach. They immediately felt even more overwhelmed. No matter what happened, as long as the rich were involved, there wouldn\u2019t be any short of troubles.\u2660\u2660Inside, Lu Chengyu, Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei were giving simple statements. The record-keeping officer listened to Lu Chengyu regarding his academic experiences from childhood to adulthood and his current position in his company. Having listened to him, the officer sympathized with Lu Chengyu. How could such a promising young man offend Young Master Liang?Before he even finished giving the statement, he suddenly heard something coming from the door. When he looked up, he saw a man, who was about 60 years old with famous brands all over his body, come in with a gloomy face. There was also a middle-aged man with glasses in a suit behind him. He looked like some gang\u2019s boss.\u201cXiao Yang, have you finished taking the statement? The father of the injured is here,\u201d A policeman came up, winked at him, then turned and dragged a chair for the man to sit down. He took another disposable paper cup to pour him a cup of water.\u201cIs he the one who wounded my son?\u201d Liang Guoming looked at Lu Chengyu with disdain, \u201cSince he intended to hurt my son, then it is a crime of intentional assault.\u201d He looked back at the lawyer behind him, \u201cHow many years is he going to be sentenced?\u201dThe lawyer smiled awkwardly. He hasn\u2019t even asked the policemen about the situation yet, neither had the witness been found. How could this matter be convicted already\u2026\u00a0 In his heart, he understood that Liang Guoming was trying to pressure the others, so he didn\u2019t look at Lu Chengyu or the others who were sitting next to him and just replied, \u201cIf it\u2019s only a minor injury, he will be sentenced to imprisonment of no more than three years, criminal detention or public surveillance.\u201d\u201cMy son\u2019s internal organs were injured! How could it be a minor injury?\u201d Liang Guoming stood up and looked at a policeman standing beside him, \u201cHas the injury identification report come out yet?\u201dThe policeman restrained his anger, reluctantly smiled, and said, \u201cMr. Liang, please rest assured. We have taken the victim to the nearby hospital for an examination.\u201d\u201cWhat small place did you go to get the injuries examined?\u201d Liang Guoming sneered, \u201cI see. Better for me to personally take him, who knows what kind of hospital you are going to.\u201dThe policeman who took the statement for Lu Chengyu was very young. Hearing Liang Guoming\u2019s words, his face changed into anger but he was pressed down by his seniors. He had to hold back his anger and almost broke through the record book with the pen in his hand. He looked up and saw that Lu Chengyu was looking at him with a smile. He immediately blushed with embarrassment. At that moment, he just felt that the Liang family\u2019s father and his son were too aggressive and overbearing.\u201cBoss Liang doesn\u2019t believe in the police? Then who does he believe in?\u201dLu Chengyu looked back in surprise and saw Yan Mu strode in with a lawyer. The other party seemed to have noticed his glance and nodded at him.Originally, Yan Mu already looked tall, straight and handsome, so standing next to Liang Guoming, who was an obese man wearing a bunch of brand names products, there was the most striking contrast. The former was an elite president, while the latter was a rather ruthless and unreasonable upstart. Immediately, with relativity, superiority and inferiority became even more obvious. The policemen\u2019s\u00a0 good impression of Yan Mu increased linearly, just like the rising speed of the antipathy towards Liang Guoming.Liang Guoming didn\u2019t expect that the president of Huading would appear in the police station. He looked doubtful at the several people in the room and didn\u2019t understand why the other party came. He said with a smile, \u201cWhat wind brought President Yan to this place?\u201dAll the policemen at the scene could guess that the newcomer was more powerful than Liang Guoming; otherwise, Liang Guoming wouldn\u2019t have been so polite. They looked suspiciously at Lu Chengyu and the others who were sitting honestly on one side. What was wrong with them today? How could two such Buddhas both have come to their small police station?\u201cI\u2019m interrupting your work,\u201d Yan Mu nodded to all the policemen present. \u201cI\u2019m Lu Chengyu\u2019s boss and currently, also his proxy. I\u2019m just accompanying Lu Chengyu to give his statement. I hope it doesn\u2019t affect your work.\u201dSeveral policemen in succession said he was not disturbing and asked Yan Mu to sit down while another person was sent to pour him some water.\u2660\u2660In the bureau chief\u2019s office, the bureau chief tremblingly hung up the phone and hurriedly called a clerk to ask, \u201cHow are things with that young man that got caught? Has he been convicted?\u201dThe clerk thought that the bureau chief was in a hurry to convict Lu Chengyu, so he said, \u201cBureau chief, at this moment, that man is still giving his statement. The victim has already gone to the nearby hospital for examination. Wait until they come back, no matter whether the injury is serious or not, it would be easy to find a reason to convict.\u201d\u201cConvict what crime!\u201d The bureau chief was anxious and sweating, \u201cYou tell them, this matter should be handled as light as possible. As for how light, it would be best if that young man can be directly released.\u201dAfter he finished saying that, he was worried that the clerk was not reliable, so he hastily walked to the statement room. When he passed by the balcony, he looked down into the courtyard below. He saw the forensic personnel returning with Liang Deyou and ran down in a hurry, stopping the two people in the corridor, \u201cHas the injury been identified? I could see that the young man is gentle and honest. He doesn\u2019t seem to be able to hurt people.\u201dAfter hearing these words from the bureau chief, the forensic personnel felt that something was wrong. When he looked up and saw that the bureau chief did not look at Liang Deyou, he knew that something had changed, \u201cIt\u2019s been checked. There were no signs of injury to the internal organs or the body\u2019s surface.\u201d He took out the medical report, \u201cThis is the certificate issued by the hospital.\u201d\u201cIn this case, it will be handled according to the hospital certificate.\u201d Instead of taking the certificate, the bureau chief took a long look at Liang Deyou, \u201cTake him to the statement room. Young men nowadays are more and more out of shape. It is also an offence to report a false crime to the police.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWhen Liang Deyou heard those words, he felt that they sounded\u2026wrong? Didn\u2019t they previously say that they would \u2018take care of\u2019 Lu Chengyu? How did it suddenly become him reporting a false crime to the police?\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d The tone of the forensic personnel suddenly became a little stiff, \u201cThe police station has to deal with a lot of things every day. Mr. Liang should not waste taxpayers\u2019 money in the future. It is a waste of manpower and material resources every time a police officer is sent out, though that\u2019s not something a young master like you would understand.\u201dLiang Deyou frowned and snorted. Without being led, he went straight to the statement room. As soon as he entered the door, he saw that in addition to his father, there was another person he didn\u2019t want to see.When Liang Deyou came to the room, Lu Chengyu saw his \u2018not so good\u2019 expression and immediately, he knew that the hospital had not detected any injuries. The most valuable lesson he learned in fighting in his previous life was how to beat someone up badly, but still for it to be impossible for others to find the injury.\u00a0 Liang Deyou wanted to use this matter to plot against him? Ha. Then unless he forged a medical certificate, there was really no way.\u201cDeyou, are you okay?\u201d Liang Guoming saw his baby son cover his stomach and his face suddenly changed. He rushed forward to help him, \u201cWhere are you hurt?\u201d\u201cMr. Liang, rest assured, there\u2019s no sign of injury on your son,\u201d The forensic personnel gave the report to the police who took the statements, took another look at the Liang family\u2019s father and son, then went out the door. No wonder people on the internet said that the Liang family produced a film emperor. Look at that pained expression, it really was quite perfect.After reading the report, several policemen came to the conclusion that there were no internal or external injuries and they knew how to deal with it, so they said, \u201cMr. Liang, you said that you were attacked and injured by Mr. Lu, but according to the report, you have no injuries. In that case, you two may as well make a settlement in private\u2026\u201d\u201cMy, Liang Guoming\u2019s, son is not at the point where after being bullied he can only suffer the unjustness!\u201d Liang Guoming had always granted every request to this only son of his who would inherit his family. Immediately, he slapped the table, \u201cDid you want to do an under-the-table deal, covering for this fellow?!\u201dWho wanted to do an under-the-table deal? Although the chief of the police had been hinted by the bureau chief that he would no longer cover for Liang Deyou, he did not dare to directly offend Liang Guoming, so he had no choice but to say, \u201cMr. Liang, take a look. The medical report here says that everything\u2019s okay. In fact, it\u2019s all just a petty quarrel. If there are any problems, you guys can settle it in private. But it will be illegal if you continue to make trouble like this\u2026\u201d\u201cF*ck your mother\u2019s ass, when Laozi[1] first came out to make a living, you weren\u2019t even born yet, follow my ** law!!\u201d Liang Guoming has been accustomed to money and power these past years and gradually developed the problem of looking down on ordinary people. However, he was polite and reasonable in front of high-ranking officials. It was like a double-faced man with a mask, who could change roles anytime and anywhere. Therefore, in front of the ordinary small policemen, he would naturally show how successful he was.[1] \u8001\u5b50 [l\u01ceozi]: father / daddy / \u201cI, your father\u201d (in anger, or out of contempt) / I (used arrogantly or jocularly)Perhaps because his words were too vulgar, the lawyer behind him looked embarrassed and said, \u201cMr. Liang, since the hospital couldn\u2019t find anything out for the time being, why don\u2019t you let your son stay in the hospital for a while for observation? However, I am afraid Mr. Lu will have to bear the medical expenses.\u201dLiang Guoming looked at Lu Chengyu with disdain, \u201cStay in the hospital? If I choose a better hospital, would he be able to afford it?\u201dYan Mu said faintly, \u201cThe hospital has produced a certificate to show that there were no injuries on Mr. Liang Deyou, yet Boss Liang insists on sending people to the hospital. Is this a scam?\u201d\u201cLegally speaking, if Mr. Liang Deyou insisted on going to the hospital, yet there were no wounds on his body, then he will be suspected of scamming,\u201d said the lawyer behind Yan Mu. \u201cFor suspected scammer, if the amount involved exceeds 40000 yuan,\u00a0 the minimum sentence can be more than three years.\u201dA room full of policemen watched as these two lawyers began to clash with each other using the law, but both of these people were someone they didn\u2019t dare to offend\u2026 So they all just had a \u2018you look at me, I\u2019ll look at you\u2019 expression and waited until the debate between the two sides was over before trying to speak again.At this time, Lu Chengyu said, \u201cMr. Liang can even be mindful of this small amount of money\u2026\u00a0 It seems that Liang Shi Corporation is really getting worse day by day.\u201dHe had on a smiling guise, seemingly like a harmless domesticated animal, but in Liang Guoming\u2019s eyes, this was naked ridicule.Liang Guoming became mad at once. He immediately raised his stool and threw it towards Lu Chengyu. Lu Chengyu stepped back to dodge, but he didn\u2019t know whether it was intentional or not and the leg of the stool just happened to touch his nose. Then suddenly, a trickle of blood came out. Lu Chengyu touched his nose and accidentally wiped some of the blood onto his cheek and forehead. It looked as if he was in a very difficult position.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Yan Mu pushed Liang Guoming away. He was about to help Lu Chengyu when he heard the sound of a shutter outside. When he turned back, he saw several reporters dressed as ordinary people taking photos. Two young girls were staring at Liang Guoming angrily, as if they wanted to rush up and trample Liang Guoming to death with their high heels.However, what all the police on the spot thought was:\u00a0How were the reporters able to get in here?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 32.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32.1Chapter 32 (I): We are good brothers!In fact, as soon as Liang Guoming made his move, he had immediately regretted it. Although he had already previously greeted someone in the higher echelons, to make this much noise at the police station, moreover now that the President of Huading was also here as that youngster\u2019s representative, it would be very troublesome for that person above if they didn\u2019t handle this matter fairly.Liang Guoming, who had to humble himself just now during his lunch with several other arrogant bosses, was already suppressing his anger from earlier. So as soon as he was provoked by Lu Chengyu\u2019s words, he became angry as the wine fumed up to his head. Thus he acted faster than his brain could process, and the stool flew out like it did leading to Lu Chengyu\u2019s face to be covered with blood. But once those reporters came out of nowhere, Liang Guoming had instantly sober up, and he knew in his heart that he was in trouble now.The police reacted quickly and politely asked the several reporters to go back out. However, the two young girls, who were glaring at Liang Guoming, were still in the room.\u00a0 After the policemen inquired about their intention, they found that they were witnesses to the earlier incident and had come to give their statements.Before the two girls were able to open their mouths, Liang Guoming spoke first as he squeezed out a smile with embarrassment. \u201cThis\u2026 Mr. Lu, I have had too much wine today, I was confused. You shouldn\u2019t have to lower yourself to my level. I\u2019ll surely compensate for your injury. In this matter, I was wrong. As a bigger person, you are magnanimous, no need to lower yourself to the same level of an old fogey like me.\u201dLu Chengyu originally only wanted to provoke Liang Guoming to scold him at the police station and didn\u2019t expect that the man would actually make such a large commotion like this. But when Liang Guoming came closer towards him, he could smell the remaining scent of food and wine on the other\u2019s body. It seemed that the other had come straight from a banquet in a hurry.Recalling that Liang Shi Corporation was having difficulty getting back up after their fall due to the recent affair, Liang Guoming must have been running all over the place, flattering those in power. Yet his own good son still spared no effort to give him trouble, really such a good representative of a son pitting a father \u2013 surely even the Heavens would feel touched. Having heard Liang Guoming\u2019s words, Lu Chengyu knew that the other side was finally sober and wanted to suppress this incident. He deliberately put on an appearance of having been frightened and took a step back, then covered his nose, lowered his head, and didn\u2019t speak as if he had been scared silly by the other party.The two girls thought scornfully:\u00a0Wasn\u2019t this just relying on being old to sell old [1] , forcing Xiao Yu to forgive his arrogant behavior?[1] \u501a\u8001\u5356\u8001 [y\u01d0 l\u01ceo m\u00e0i l\u01ceo]: taking advantage of one\u2019s seniority; capitalize on being advanced in age;\u201cRelying on being old to sell old\u2026 Shameless!\u201d A girl murmured, but the room full of policemen seemed to not have heard, and no one came out to stop her behavior.The officers in the room scurried to fetch Lu Chengyu water and to hand him a towel, but the anger on their faces couldn\u2019t be concealed. Although they were merely a very small police station, someone had dared to rampantly assault someone else in front of them! Moreover, reporters have captured the incident! It was doomed for this matter to be unable to end easily. Furthermore, if this wasn\u2019t done well, all of them would suffer.When the bureau chief heard that Liang Guoming had assaulted someone in the police station and that this matter was even witnessed by reporters, his breathing almost stopped. He rushed to the reception room and looked at several reporters invited there by his colleagues, then asked with a smile, \u201cDidn\u2019t everyone here say that they were witnesses? Then why were you guys still carrying filming equipment? This isn\u2019t quite in accordance with the law\u2026\u201d\u201cThe masses have the right to know the truth! If we didn\u2019t come in today, who would believe\u2026 that someone would be able to use a stool to beat others inside a police station!\u201d The reporter who answered then recalled the video that they had copied from the witnesses and somewhat angrily accused, \u201cIt was clearly the one who reported the crime who started things first. Why has he become the victim instead? Now Mr. Lu was even injured inside the police station with his face covered in blood. Could it be that you guys are colluding with the Liang family?!\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?!\u201d The bureau chief\u2019s attitude became extremely solemn and sonorously replied, \u201cWe have thoroughly investigated to understand this incident. That certain Mr. Liang, who made a report to the police, didn\u2019t have any traces of injury on his body. Therefore, that matter would not constitute a crime of assault. As for the father of the person who made the report, who had committed a violent act inside the police station, we will certainly give you an account!\u201d This was a matter of certainty. What\u2019s more, comparing the Liang family with the power of the man behind Lu Chengyu, it was like the difference between an ant and an elephant. Even without having to think about it, he knew where he should stand.Once the reporters saw that the bureau chief didn\u2019t plan to cover this up for Young Master Liang, they immediately lost their interest in continuing to question him. They were all ready to go back to rush the manuscript, so they could send out this piece of news. After all, even if the police department were to handle this matter impartially, this incident of Liang\u2019s father and son beating people up was a big story. What\u2019s more, Male God Lu had been famous online recently, so there was no worry that it won\u2019t become a hot topic.As soon as the reporters left the police station, they sent this news to their editors-in-chief, while some internet media also posted the videos taken by the witnesses during the incident. So everything quickly exploded, almost like water beads falling into a pan of hot oil.The video started with Lu Chengyu talking with two middle-aged men by the roadside. Although the image was fuzzy, it could be seen that the three were chatting happily. Then, a Porsche came and parked in front of the three people. As soon as Young Master Liang showed his face from inside the car, his despondence could be felt through the screen.Thanks to the witness\u2019s phone\u2019s high definition camera, the entire video was very clear.Next, they saw Young Master Liang rush out with his fist raised to fight Lu Chengyu. Lu Chengyu obviously took a step back, but it could be clearly seen that Young Master Liang still insisted on attacking him. Then, Young Master Liang was kicked by the other side. From the video, the kick did not seem to be heavy, instead, it seemed more like self-defense.The video shook a few times as if the witness who was filming saw that the matter was going to blow up so they went closer up. Finally, everyone could clearly hear Young Master Liang cursing at Lu Chengyu.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u29ed\u29ed\u201cIf you have no father, no mother, and no education, then it seems you can only mix with these kinds of people. I\u00a0bah!\u201dHearing this, a lot of people\u2019s anger was ignited. It was disgusting to talk about people whose parents are no longer around.However, the male-god-of-Q-University, man-with-360-degrees-of-handsomeness, no longer have a father or mother?The reason why people were considered humans was that they had their own moral values and have feelings that other animals didn\u2019t have. Therefore, many people would support just behavior, would be angry at injustice, and would sympathize with the unfortunate. Although some people may be indifferent or would say that they were not the holy mother, in fact, such people would still subconsciously stand on the side with reason, because this was the nature of normal people.Therefore, when the video surfaced, the public opinion stood on the side of Lu Chengyu while the Liang family once again stood in the middle of a storm.Thus, once the pictures where Liang Guoming had beaten Lu Chengyu until his whole face was covered with blood was revealed by the media on the internet as well, the whole online community exploded again. Your mother\u2013! Your side punched first and even called the police to arrest him, yet now, unexpectedly, both father and son are joining hands to beat the hardworking young man who doesn\u2019t have a father or mother like this?! Wasn\u2019t this too amazingly shameless?!And once some of those people online, who had already been fond of Lu Chengyu saw this news, one-by-one, almost all of them incarnated into fighting gods. Various people anonymously posted Lu Chengyu\u2019s awards from childhood to adulthood, the various competitions he had participated in, the various elected positions he held during university, his speeches on behalf of Q university graduates, and various other impressive achievements. Some had even attached pictures to prove their authenticity.As soon as these things came out, it immediately stunned the whole group of people to jaw drop.This kind of person was simply an academic tyrant of his generation! From his childhood till now, he was an excellent student who was liked by teachers, yet he also wasn\u2019t a boring nerd. This was the legendary life winner! This was simply against the Heavens!On a certain forum, a self-proclaimed old neighbor of Lu Chengyu appeared. He commented on how polite Lu Chengyu was when he was a child and how his parents were cultured people. He also mentioned how Lu Chengyu had always been \u201cthat other family\u2019s child\u201d since he was a kid. The parents of their entire building loved to use Lu Chengyu as an example in front of their children. Later, Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents bought a house in a new community. As a result, just as they had finished the renovations, before they could even move in, they passed away from an accident.As a result, netizens now knew that Lu Chengyu grew up in a well-educated, happy, and peaceful family environment. He was even \u201cthat other family\u2019s child.\u201d While at other times, people might joke and say that they hate this kind of a person the most, but at this moment, they only felt sympathy. After all, he had so suddenly lost his happy family. What kind of pain did Lu Chengyu, who was still a student at that time, go through? Yet Liang Deyou still cursed the other using this pain, just how bad was his character?Some people took screenshots of the frame-by-frame of the video after Liang Deyou cursed Lu Chengyu for having no father or mother, and they could clearly see that the expression on Lu Chengyu\u2019s face was like a little duckling who just had a basin of ice water poured over it. He seemed to be in such a difficult position that it made others feel distressed for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yan Mu held Lu Chengyu\u2019s head as he looked at Liang Guoming coldly. \u201cCould this be President Liang\u2019s typical way of dealing with things? Today was truly eye-opening.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for Liang Guoming to reply but directly addressed the leading policeman, \u201cPresident Liang committed a vicious attack inside the police station. I hope all of you here will give an account to the victim. Although Lu Chengyu is just an ordinary person who has no one to rely on, without a father or a mother, we, Huading, will still stand behind him. Huading will not allow its employees to be so unjustly bullied for no reason.\u201dThe officer looked at the stool with a broken leg that had fallen to the ground, which could be regarded as a weapon for criminal purposes?The two girls, who were there as witnesses, glanced at Yan Mu several times, their eyes full of approval for Yan Mu.Lu Chengyu had seldom heard Yan Mu say so many words in one breath, especially with a tone this harsh and an expression this ugly. He wanted to reach out and touch his itchy nose, but Yan Mu stopped him. \u201cDon\u2019t move. The blood had just stopped. Do you want it to start bleeding again?\u201dLu Chengyu gave a chuckle or two, then put down his hand and apologized, \u201cI\u2019ve really troubled you today.\u201d\u201cYou are my employee, I\u2019m supposed to care about you.\u201d Yan Mu looked at the few drops of blood on his shirt collar, then turned to the police. \u201cIf you have any more questions, please ask them as soon as possible. We still have to go to the hospital afterward.\u201dThe two girls then recalled why they were there. They gave the police a backup of the video they had taken before and reported the whole process of how they witnessed the incident.But throughout the entire narrative process, the police could hear their obvious dissatisfaction towards the Liang family.\u201cThank you very much for coming here to testify on this case.\u201d The police asked them to sign the testimony, then smiled and thanked them, \u201cYou\u2019ve made our work a lot easier. Thank you.\u201dThey waved their hands to express that it was no trouble, one of them even directly said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want innocent people to be wronged.\u201d\u201cDo you have anything else to add, the two Mr. Liangs?\u201d After hearing Liang Deyou\u2019s curses, the police station was strangely quiet for a moment before the policeman in charge of the case continued, \u201cSince this matter has nothing to do with Mr. Lu, we will cancel the case in accordance with the legal procedures. However, Mr. Liang, you have disrupted the police as they were trying to handle a case, as well as deliberately assaulted another individual. Naturally, you must answer to those charges.\u201d After saying this, he looked at Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu, as if to ask whether or not they were satisfied with this.\u201cNow that it\u2019s over, we\u2019ll be going to the hospital to have the injury checked. As for President Liang and Mr. Liang, please wait for the court summons,\u201d said Yan Mu coldly, \u201cAlthough you have maliciously slandered and deliberately assaulted others, and these behaviors are very unacceptable, we are law-abiding good citizens, so we will leave it to the law to judge how this should be handled.\u201d\u00a0 With that, he helped the \u201cinjured\u201d Lu Chengyu up and walked out.\u201cThis, this\u2026\u201d How could Liang Guoming have expected that Yan Mu would make things so serious just for an ordinary employee, so he hurriedly chased out after him. If this matter blew up, wasn\u2019t this going to make things even worse for Liang Shi Corporation?\u201cPresident Yan, please wait a moment! Why don\u2019t we discuss this matter first? Isn\u2019t this just a small matter, why make\u2026\u201d Liang Guoming had barely stepped out of the station when he was almost blinded by flashes, even though it was still daytime. Outside the police station, many people held mobile phones or cameras as they crowded the entire entrance, hurriedly snapping pictures.As soon as these people saw that Lu Chengyu had to be helped out and that his shirt was even still stained with blood, they immediately snapped pictures of Lu Chengyu\u2019s shirt. Some young girls even asked him aloud whether he was seriously injured, whether he would be going to the hospital, and what the police had said.\u201cEveryone, please step aside.\u201d The lawyer that Yan Mu had brought loudly explained, \u201cI am Mr. Lu\u2019s lawyer. It has been found out that Mr. Lu did not cause any harm to Mr. Liang\u2019s body. Mr. Liang first hurled insults, then committed violence against my client because of his disagreement. With the use of self-defense, my client was not hurt, but Mr. Liang became indignant and called the police. Fortunately, the police comrades were keen and impartial, and they soon found the truth and gave my client justice. As for how President Liang injured my client with a stool, we will use legal means to protect Mr. Lu\u2019s rights and interests. But now we need to take Mr. Lu to the hospital for treatment. So everyone, please step aside or we will not be able to drive our car out, and it will not be good for Mr. Lu\u2019s injury. Thank you.\u201dWithin this speech, the lawyer explained in an easily understood manner the ins and outs of why Liang Deyou had called the police. In addition, he also praised the police department\u2019s law enforcers and indicated that they would sue Liang Guoming for deliberate assault. So with just one step, Lu Chengyu was known as the victim while the law enforcement officers could also keep a good image.Although Lu Chengyu never studied law, he could still hear the wisdom within this lawyer\u2019s words. He looked up and smiled at the crowd, but his nose was still stuffed with tissue, which made him seem a bit comical.\u201cXiao Yu, don\u2019t worry! We\u2019re all on your side!\u201d One girl yelled, causing others to also echo, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Xiao Yu!\u201dLu Chengyu looked at these people that came to the police station for him and said a few \u2018thank you\u2019s to them. After getting into Yan Mu\u2019s car, he also waved his hand back at everyone. As for those people who called him \u201cXiao Yu [1]\u201d or \u201cXiao Yu[2]\u201d, he didn\u2019t mind at all.[1] Xiao Yu [\u5c0f\u4f59]: Xiao \u2013 Little; Yu is from his name, Lu Cheng yu ,\u00a0 means: extra, surplus[2] Xiao Yu [\u5c0f\u9c7c]: Xiao \u2013 Little; Yu \u2013\u00a0 fish.The longer Liang Guoming looked at it, the wronger it felt. When Deyou called just now, didn\u2019t he say that the other party was just an ordinary person? Then why were there so many people encircling around here for him now, and how did all these people know about this matter? Could it be that someone already disclosed this matter on the internet?\u201cPresident Liang?\u201d After seeing this, the lawyer behind him quickly motioned him to get in the car and leave, fearing that these angry onlookers would start hitting people.The driver, who had been waiting in the car, quickly got out of the car and opened the luxurious Bentley\u2019s door for him. Right as he got the door ready, he saw this mass of people, who had circled around the police station, begin to bang violently on the car, scaring him to hurriedly cover his face and run back to the driver\u2019s seat. Liang Deyou also immediately followed after him and got in the car. After that, the driver quickly started the car and directly left the police station.After the people outside the police station saw that both involved parties had left and that the police station had handled the matter fairly, everyone was ready to go home when suddenly a man questioned, \u201cWho was the man that supported Xiao Yu just now?\u201dThe others shook their heads and said they didn\u2019t know. Some speculated that it was Lu Chengyu\u2019s friend or relative, but the man who asked said, \u201cIf Xiao Yu had friends or relatives who could afford a Maybach, it would have been unlikely that Young Master Liang would have tried to slander him, right?\u201d\u201cThat was his boss.\u201d The two girls, who came in as eyewitnesses, came out and heard this conversation. One of them continued, \u201cWhen we heard what he said inside just now, we both thought he was just too handsome.\u201dThe people there asked what happened one after another, so she told them, before she finally also lamented, \u201cA company that could cherish its employees this much must be a very conscientious enterprise. If we buy more from them in the future, we can increase the company\u2019s performance for Xiao Yu!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgSome people posted this on Weibo, so Yan Mu soon got another title called \u201canother family\u2019s boss.\u201d So through this matter, a positive image of Huading also disseminated on the internet.\u29ed\u29edInside the Bentley, after hearing Liang Deyou\u2019s narration, Liang Guoming almost vomited blood. Although he had always loved this only son of his, he was still very angry at the moment. \u201cDo you know what our company is like now? Your father, I, in order to make up for the past, have had to lower himself in front of those people all day long, yet you\u2019re so good at overthrowing everything, unable to distinguish between right and wrong, and still causing so much trouble. Not even towards an ordinary person either, but someone that Yan Mu has a good relationship with! Do you know what identity his maternal grandfather\u2019s family has?!\u201dLiang Deyou had already lost face at the police station, yet now, he was again scolded by Liang Guoming. So immediately his temper rose and he talked back, \u201cHow could I know that he would meddle in someone else\u2019s business? What\u2019s more, Lu Chengyu is the son of that couple who didn\u2019t have eyes when driving! If it weren\u2019t for them, we would not have lost the project, and we wouldn\u2019t have been criticized by the safety supervision department either! Their family has damaged our company\u2019s reputation, what\u2019s wrong with me \u2018taking care of\u2019 him a bit?\u201d\u201cIf you want to \u2018take care of\u2019 someone, you also need to understand whether or not you have the ability!\u201d Liang Guoming angrily scolded, \u201cNow there are other people who want to \u2018take care of\u2019 us!\u201d Then suddenly, his face changed. \u201cWhat did you say? He\u2019s the son of that couple?\u201dWatching as Liang Deyou nodded, Liang Guoming was so angry that he gave him a slap. \u201cAre you stupid, how could Laozi have this kind of a son?\u201dLiang Deyou looked at Liang Guoming in disbelief, then covered his face, yelling angrily, \u201cDad!\u201d He hadn\u2019t been beaten in years, yet now his father decided to beat him for such a small matter?!\u201cShut up!\u201d Liang Guoming thought for a moment. \u201cNow go and find out which hospital Yan Mu sent the man to. When you know the location, you go and apologize to him in person for this Laozi. Lower yourself a bit. You must ask him to forgive you! Do you understand?\u201d\u201cWhy should I apologize to him!? He deliberately provoked me!\u201d Liang Deyou recalled what Lu Chengyu said to provoke him before, then gritted his teeth. \u201cWhat does he even regard himself as!\u201d He really failed to understand what abilities such a small Lu Chengyu had that even his father had to worry about him.Liang Guoming wanted to scold him again, but he sighed instead after remembering how much he had spoiled his son these recent years. \u201cDeyou, you\u2019re already 25 years old this year. It\u2019s time to learn to be sensible. When I was younger than you, I drank porridge, ate pickled vegetables, and dug coal in the mines every day\u2026\u201d He frowned, then continued, \u201cThis matter isn\u2019t so simple. That man named Lu Chengyu also isn\u2019t a simple person. If this doesn\u2019t get handled properly, our Liang family would become even more chaotic.\u201dLiang Deyou was too impatient to listen to Liang Guoming recall his old stories, but he had no choice and could only agree with Liang Guoming.In the hospital, Lu Chengyu chewed on an apple as he read the injury report which was printed: Suspected intracranial or skull injury, nasal cartilage injury, need to be hospitalized for observation and treatment.Then he glanced at the calm-looking Yan Mu, who sat on the end of the bed, and felt that the medical report seemed to portray his situation much more severe than it really was.\u201cYou have a good rest. This hospital is run by Zhang Zeyun\u2019s family. I will ask the doctors and nurses to take care of you. If you need anything, you can ask them for help.\u201d Yan Mu didn\u2019t seem to see Lu Chengyu\u2019s suspicious eyes. Yan Mu got up and opened the window in the ward for him to allow the air to circulate in the room. \u201cI\u2019ll send someone to bring a laptop for you to pass the time with. Leave the rest to me and I\u2019ll take care of it for you.\u201dLu Chengyu didn\u2019t know whether Yan Mu\u2019s so-called \u2018the rest\u2019 referred to the court or other things but what Yan Mu had done for him had already greatly exceeded the level that ordinary friends would do. He was silent for a moment. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say before that we don\u2019t have to be so polite?\u201d Yan Mu went to the bedside and patted him on the shoulder. Then he quickly took back his hand and tried to make his smile more gentle. \u201cI thought you took me as a friend.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded. \u201cNot only do I think of you as a friend, I think of you as a brother.\u201d He paused for a moment, then hesitatingly added, \u201cAnd\u2026 if you\u2019re not used to smiling, then you don\u2019t have to force yourself to smile.\u201dThe smile that Yan Mu squeezed out with much difficulty immediately froze. He coughed, shifted his eyes, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go find the doctor to ask what you need to pay attention to.\u201dLu Chengyu watched him walk out of the ward in a hurry. Then he looked back down at the medical records in his hand and took another bite, biting off a large piece of the apple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What kind of stuff are they?\u201d He glanced at Lu Chengyu\u2019s hospital gown and sighed, \u201cRelying on a money, their eyes and nose are growing up to the top of the head[1]. What kind of people does Chen Jin know.\u201dIf Chen Jin hadn\u2019t brought such people to school, the third would not have encountered this kind of fucking thing. Originally, the reason for the accidental death of the third\u2019s parents was the improper construction operation of the Liang family. As a result, Liang Deyou also scolded the third for having no father or mother. When they saw the video on the Internet, they almost died of anger. So after calling Lu Chengyu, they rushed to the hospital.Handing the peeled oranges to Lu Chengyu, Zhang Hong glanced at the time: \u201cIt\u2019s five o\u2019clock in the afternoon. What do you want for dinner, I\u2019ll buy it for you.\u201d The hospital\u2019s sick meal were simply torturing the patient\u2019s stomach. He and Zhu Guanglin will have to go to work tomorrow, and couldn\u2019t take care of the third from time to time, so should the third eat the hospital\u2019s sick food?\u201cDon\u2019t bother, the company has arranged for three meals to be delivered to me,\u201d Lu Chengyu said with a smile when his two buddies were worried. \u201cBesides, I have nothing to do. The nurses in the hospital also take care of me.\u201d\u201cCan they be as caring as your own people?\u201d Zhang Hong thought for a while, \u201cForget it, I will take two days off from the company and stay with you in the hospital for a few days.\u201d Where can he rest assured when he is lying alone in the hospital?\u201cAren\u2019t you going on a business trip tomorrow?\u201d Zhu Guanglin said, \u201cLet me ask for leave. I just don\u2019t have anything important to do these days.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and looked at the two of them: \u201cI\u2019m serious , someone will take care of me. Yes, don\u2019t worry about it. Just ask for a few days off as long as you have been working properly. If I were the boss, I would definitely fire you.\u201d\u201cWe both show talents, but the boss can\u2019t bear it\u2026\u201d Zhu Guanglin said, he heard the door opening behind him. He turned his head and saw a man in suit walking into the house. It seemed he was not surprised to see them.\u201cHello, I am Lu Chengyu\u2019s boss.\u201d Yan Mu put down the thermos and shook hands with the two in turn. \u201cThank you for visiting Xiao Lu.\u201d Zhu Guanglin and Zhang Hong intuitively felt that the identity of the person in front of them was unusual, but they saw Lu Chengyu this person gets along very naturally, so after introducing themselves, they didn\u2019t say much, just chatted without a word.Yan Mu saw that Lu Chengyu was in a good mood with a smile on his face. He knew that the two young people in front of him were good friends. If he remembered correctly, he had seen Lu Chengyu playing with these two young people until the middle of the night. Only good buddies can rush over less than three hours after Lu Chengyu entered the hospital.Seeing that Lu Chengyu was still eating oranges, he did not take the dinner out of the thermos, turned around and sat down quietly. After the three of them finished a topic, he said: \u201cYour two friends have returned home. They told the people in that circle that you need to rest.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded. Zhang Dao and the verse screenwriter were also considered unwarranted disasters. They followed him on a day trip to the police station, but their behaviour today made him sure. Both of them are very loyal gentlemen, and he will be more at ease in cooperation in the future. However, after he was discharged from the hospital, he still needed to apologize to the two of them. After all, he was injuring them both no matter what.He understood that the reason why it was so quiet this afternoon was because of Yan Mu, and he didn\u2019t know how much he had put in to stop the media reporters from all walks of life. He glanced at him gratefully, \u201cDirector Zhang and Qu Lingbei have been on fire in the past few days, and now will be troubled by me and become famous again.\u201d\u201cBefore I leave, let me take good care of you,\u201d Yan Mu thought. After thinking about it, he came to a conclusion, \u201cThey are good collaborators, don\u2019t worry.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and nodded, turning around to see Zhu Guanglin and Zhang Hongzheng looking at them, and said, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to work tomorrow? Go back early?\u201d Have dinner and have a good rest.\u201d\u201cBah, with a handsome leader to take care of you, us brothers have no value?\u201d Zhang Hong cursed jokingly, \u201cOkay, we know you are worried about the two of us. However, you should pay more attention to yourself. In the future, you will encounter Liang Deyou\u2019s craziness. Stay away. I heard that craziness can be contagious.\u201dJust after he said this, the ward door was knocked twice, Chen Jin stood at the door with an embarrassed expression, and asked in a low voice. \u201cLu Chengyu, there is nothing wrong with your health?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going, you told him the address?\u201d Zhu Guanglin asked Zhang Hong in a low voice.Zhang Hong nodded: \u201cI just want him to know what Liang Deyou is.\u201dLu Chengyu squeezed a polite smile on his face: \u201cWhy are you here, please sit down.\u201dZhang Hong stood up and left the stool underneath him. He came out, turned and sat on the edge of the bed, glanced at Chen Jin and said nothing.\u201cNo need,\u201d Chen Jin saw that there was already a thermos at the bedside and hid the soup he had brought behind him. After walking a few steps into the room, he didn\u2019t feel embarrassed to sit on a stool. \u201cI just came to have a look. How hurt you are, I\u2019m really sorry this time.\u201d\u201cThis matter has nothing to do with you. Why are you apologizing?\u201d Although Lu Chengyu had nothing to say to Chen Jin, he knew in his heart that this matter had nothing to do with Chen Jin.Yan Mu looked calmly at Chen Jin\u2019s insulated thermos behind him, turned around and unscrewed the insulated thermos\u2019 lid on the bedside table, a faint fragrance floated out.The insulator is very large, divided into several layers, it can be called a luxurious configuration, with a layer of rice, a layer of meat dishes, a layer of ingredients, and a layer of soup.When Yan Mu put these things on the bed and placed them in front of Lu Chengyu, even Zhu Guanglin couldn\u2019t help swallowing.\u201cTime is tight in the afternoon, I can\u2019t rush back to cook for you. These are all bought at Bai Weixuan. I remember you like the taste of this restaurant.\u201d What Yan Mu prepared for Lu Chengyu was not the one-time chopsticks provided by the restaurant, but brand new ones. Wooden chopsticks and spoons, \u201cThese tastes are light, I know that you like Sichuan food, we will eat together when you are better.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded and smiled at Yan Mu: \u201cI am so touched by the good boss!\u201d After that, he picked up a chopsticks and stir-fried vegetables with mushrooms[2]\u00a0and put them in his mouth. The vegetables were still piping hot, just like they just came out of the pot.He didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the good quality of the thermos, or because the food was delivered by Yan Mu as soon as it was out of the pot. But no matter what the reason, Lu Chengyu felt that although Yan Mu didn\u2019t talk much, he was a very considerate person.When Yan Mu heard Lu Chengyu\u2019s words, the corners of his lips moved, and he didn\u2019t say anything. He just handed him a tissue, and then sat beside him silently waiting for Lu Chengyu to start his meal.Zhang Hong and Zhu Guanglin were relieved looking at this picture. They could see the thoughtfulness and carefulness of the third\u2019s boss. They looked at each other and Zhang Hong said, \u201cThe third, then we will go back first. If something happens to you, you must call us.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded, thought for a moment and then said: \u201cYou two too, if you have anything, you must tell me.\u201d\u201cOkay, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Zhang Hong wanted to step forward and put his hand around his shoulder, but he didn\u2019t know where he was hurt, so he finally touched his head, \u201cBrothers won\u2019t be polite to you, then we\u2019ll go first and you take care of myself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Lu Chengyu watched them After leaving the house, he said to Yan Mu, \u201cDid you have dinner?\u201d He saw that Yan Mu seemed to have brought an empty bowl, guessing that he rushed over and didn\u2019t eat at all.Yan Mu shook his head: \u201cI\u2019m not hungry yet.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s not hungry, people are not made of iron or steel, so they will be flustered if they don\u2019t eat.\u201d Lu Chengyu took the empty bowl and divided half of the rice into the bowl, then handed him the spoon. \u201cI can\u2019t finish eating so much food, let\u2019s just eat like this.\u201dYan Mu looked at the wooden spoon in his hand, held the bowl and nodded: \u201cYeah.\u201d He sat down on the edge of the bed, although using a wooden spoon is very inconvenient to scoop dishes, but he thought it\u2019s a bit interesting to sit and eat like this.Seeing Yan Mu, who usually sat with his back straight gracefully, bowing his upper body to scoops vegetables awkwardly with a spoon, Lu Chengyu couldn\u2019t help but laugh, and rinsed his chopsticks in the cup, and picked two chopsticks for Yan Mu.Seeing Lu Chengyu smile happily, Yan Mu moved his eyebrows and was not annoyed. He just lowered his head and continued to eat.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLooking at the way they get along, Chen Jin felt mixed in her heart, and said after a long time, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to do this. It\u2019s all my fault. If I didn\u2019t take him to school, there would not be so many things that happened.\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s picking hand paused slightly, then looked at Chen Jin and said, \u201cEven without you, he will bother me sooner or later. I have already said that this matter has nothing to do with you, and you don\u2019t need to tell me sorry.\u201dYan Mu turned his head and glanced at Chen Jin, without speaking.\u201cI see,\u201d Chen Jin smiled bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He glanced at the two of them, his eyes finally fell on the corner of Lu Chengyu\u2019s smiling mouth, turned slowly, and walked out of the ward.Lu Chengyu frowned slightly, what exactly did Chen Jin mean?\u201cHe seems to have made some kind of decision,\u201d Yan Mu said suddenly, \u201cThis person is a little weird.\u201d\u201cWhere is it strange?\u201d Lu Chengyu took a bite of the meal, and asked back, \u201cCan Liang Deyou be strange again?\u201d\u201cWhat I mean? It means that his attitude towards you and Liang Deyou are very strange,\u201d Yan Mu frowned slightly, with a certain affirmation, \u201cThis is a very contradictory person.\u201dLu Chengyu gave Yan Mu a second glance, not knowing. Is it his illusion that he thinks that many successful people are very accurate in seeing people? Is this a special skill?\u201cThe food is getting cold,\u201d Yan Mu noticed that Lu Chengyu was looking at him, and said uncomfortably, \u201cEating something too cold is bad for the stomach.\u201dLu Chengyu had to smile and lower his head to continue eating.When Zhuang Yu and Zhang Zeyun rushed to the hospital, they saw Yan Mu bowing and eating while Lu Chengyu was sitting on the hospital bed. The two were talking.\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Zhuang Yu retreated in fright, closed the door and said to Zhang Zeyun behind him, \u201cDid I just get dazzled?\u201d\u201cYou have no eyes,\u201d Zhang Zeyun looked calmer than Zhuang Yu. He saw from the crack of the door that Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu had finished their meal, and Yan Mu stood up and moved the bed table down.Withdrawing his gaze, he said to Zhuang Yu lightly, \u201cI told you not to enter the room without knocking.\u201dHe stepped forward and knocked on the door. After waiting a few seconds, he opened the door of the ward and said with a smile: \u201cXiao Lu, how is your health?\u201dLu Chengyu saw them both, and immediately smiled: \u201cBrother Zhang, Brother Zhuang, why are you here too?\u201d\u201cTo see you,\u201d Zhuang Yu put a computer bag in Lu Chengyu\u2019s hands. \u201cThis is the notebook that Brother Mu asked me to bring you. Try to get used to it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too much trouble for you.\u201d Lu Chengyu put the computer bag aside, \u201cI don\u2019t have any major problems with my body. The doctor asked me to stay in the hospital for observation for a while.\u201d This hospital belongs to Zhang Zeyun\u2019s family, and he knew in his heart that Lu Chengyu\u2019s injuries were not serious. However, since Mu Ge intervened in the matter, he would not speak much.Zhang Zeyun looked up at Yan Mu, but he saw Yan Mu\u2019s eyes fell on Lu Chengyu, his eyes full of concern.He blinked in surprise, and then adjusted the expression on his face: \u201cThis mind is the most complicated part of people. You can stay in the hospital for two more days to observe, and we can rest assured.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, that\u2019s it. Did you make a special trip for me,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled apologetically, and after greeting the two of them to sit down, he seemed to say unintentionally, \u201cI heard that this matter has become a big deal on the Internet?\u201d\u201cCan this be called a big deal?\u201d Zhuang Yu thought after the words, \u201cI think the Liang family is almost like this.\u201d Yan Mu said at this time: \u201cProud and complacent, always needing to learn a lesson, otherwise they will make mistakes again and again.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded: \u201cThe boss is right.!\u201dLooking at this scene, Zhang Zeyun smiled, but his eyes fell on the luxurious thermos barrel.Well, the pattern on it is good.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34In the quiet night, I do not know how many people have fallen into a dream without knowing it. In their dreams, they may be saviors, rich people who spend money like dirt, or beggars or martial arts masters. When they wake up from the dream, there are still many people who cannot distinguish between dream and reality.When Lu Chengyu opened his eyes from his dream, what he saw was pitch black. He slowly got up from the bed and looked at the dim lights outside the window. He suddenly remembered that this is not his home, but the hospital ward.He got up and poured himself a glass of water. He walked to the window and quietly looked at the energy-saving lamp in the garden below. The green light seemed a little lonely in the dark night. After taking a sip of warm water, he half leaned against the window, stretched his head out of the window to feel the chill of the night breeze, and let out a long breath. Turning around, he was taken aback, because Yan Mu, who was sleeping on the accompanying bed, had already sat up from the bed.\u201cBoss, you look very terrifying just sitting there silently,\u201d he put down the water glass, climbed onto the bed in a few steps, and pulled the quilt over his knees. Although there was no light in the room, he could feel Yan Mu looking at him, \u201cI woke you up just now?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Yan Mu was silent for a few seconds before saying, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you sleep?\u201dLu Chengyu smiled., Remembering that he could not see his expression in the dark, his smile suddenly collapsed: \u201cI had a bad dream, and I woke up.\u201d There was another minute of silence, when he said solemnly, \u201cDreams are fake.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Lu Chengyu\u2019s mouth bent, \u201cI know.\u201dYan Mu couldn\u2019t see Lu Chengyu\u2019s expression, so he couldn\u2019t judge the other party\u2019s mood from his expression. He didn\u2019t even know what he should say. He had the feeling as if he shouldn\u2019t talk now, but he had to say something, \u201cI had a very strange dream before, dreaming that I became a wolf, but I didn\u2019t want to eat raw meat, so I finally woke up hungry. \u201cIn the darkness, he heard Lu Chengyu chuckle, and then he heard the other person say: \u201cWhy not a wolf dog? Go to sleep, maybe we can become kings in our dreams later.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Yan Mu saw that Lu Chengyu was already lying down through the faint light outside the window, and then slowly lay down, pulling the quilt up a little bit and covering himself till his chin.When Lu Chengyu woke up early the next morning, it was already bright, and his breakfast was in the thermos on the bedside. As for Yan Mu, he had already rushed to the company.He drank slightly light vegetable porridge, and after eating steamed buns, he turned on the computer and plugged in the network cable provided in the ward and processed some emails about work.At this time, on the most famous forum in China, a post that shocked netizens were posted.The name of this post was \u201cA Truth That will Shock You and Make You Angry\u201d. Originally, they thought the poster was someone who deliberately used the title as clickbait to attract everyone\u2019s attention. After clicking into the post, they were shocked by the contents of the post.It turns out that Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents died from an accident, and the cause of the accident was that Liang\u2019s safety measures were so inadequate during construction that an object fell from a high altitude, which happened to hit Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents\u2019 car, causing both of them to die on the spot.After the accident, Liang did pay a sum of compensation, but no person in charge came forward and said even half an apology to Lu Chengyu for this matter. Later, as a result of the handling of this matter, an intern under the Liang family was sentenced to two years imprisonment, the Liang family was disqualified from construction, and was criticized by the local officials.For this reason, the prince Liang was extremely dissatisfied with Lu Chengyu, the son of the couple who died accidentally, and could not get along with him anywhere. As for the video posted on the Internet, it is just one of his many provocative incidents.As soon as this post came out, it instantly ignited the anger of many people, but there were also a few sane people questioning the authenticity of this matter. However, the host later posted relevant evidence, such as the news that Liang was criticized, and the small news that an employee of Liang was arrested. This news did not cause any sensation back then, so they were ignored by everyone. Now that they are posted, everyone can realize what is going on.Soon, some smart netizens guessed that the construction company was a Wanhong branch of Liang\u2019s at the time, which means that Lu Chengyu probably didn\u2019t know that Liang was the culprit responsible for the death of his parents.Their brain made up a lot of stories about Lu Chengyu\u2019s helplessness when he was bullied by Liang Deyou, and also made up a lot of stories about Liang Deyou\u2019s ugly face of bullying. Netizens were angry and exploded.Then many Internet hackers appeared on the Internet, spontaneously reporting negative news about the Liang family. Soon, the history of Liang\u2019s family, the history of Liang Guoming\u2019s relationship, and Liang Deyou\u2019s history of bullying people were all dug up by netizens. Even the suspicious signs that Liang Guoming\u2019s wife used money to subsidize her family\u2019s business were released.The power of the masses is infinite, especially when these masses are still in a state of anger.There was no perfect person in the world, and it is even more impossible to have a perfect company. Therefore, there are many shady corners in the Liang family. All this got exposed, and the impact was not only on Liang\u2019s reputation, but the entire Liang family was caught in a mess where they were suspected of multiple illegal operations.But Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t know that such a big thing had happened online, and Liang Deyou, who had rushed to the hospital at this time, didn\u2019t know either.Although he was carrying a large package of supplements in his hand, his face was angry. When he met the medical staff or patients in the corridor, they would look at him more because of his expression.As soon as Lu Chengyu finished replying to an email, he heard the door being knocked twice. Before he could speak, he saw Liang Deyou walk in angrily, and then throw the bag of supplements to the ground.\u201cLu Chengyu, what exactly did you use?\u201d Liang Deyou looked at the person on the hospital bed with a smiling face. For the first time, he felt that he seemed to have underestimated this person. He suppressed the anger that was gushing from his heart, \u201cI just want to ask you, Chen Jin, where did he go?\u201d\u201cChen Jin?\u201d Lu Chengyu moved his gaze from the scattered tonics to Liang Deyou\u2019s anger-filled face. He frowned slightly, \u201cHow should I know where he went?\u201d.\u201cDo you think I won\u2019t know what Chen Jin saw you last night?!\u201d Liang Deyou saw Lu Chengyu deliberately pretending to be confused, his expression increasingly ugly, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t because of what you said to him, why did he just turn down my pursuit last night, and even did not come to the company today?!\u201d\u201cHe rejected you. It\u2019s your problem. What does it have to do with me?\u201d Lu Chengyu had heard that the two had separated and reunited in his previous life. Misunderstandings came and went, and it took several years for them to really get together. Now that Liang Deyou is so angry, is it possible that the two are in conflict again? He closed the laptop and frowned, \u201cIf the person is gone, you will run here to make trouble. What\u2019s the point?\u201d\u201cYou dare to swear that Chen Jin\u2019s departure has nothing to do with you?!\u201d Liang Deyou did not understand, why is Chen Jin so attached to a person like Lu Chengyu? No matter how hard he tries, it\u2019s useless, \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me where Chen Jin is, I won\u2019t let you go.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen a doctor since you were a kid?\u201d Lu Chengyu pushed aside the bed table in front of him, \u201cNone of these doctors found something wrong with your brain?\u201d\u201cWho the hell did you say has a brain problem?!\u201d Liang Deyou said angrily, \u201cBelieve it or not I will kill you!\u201dLu Chengyu leaned on the bed and sneered, \u201cMr. Liang came today to kill me?\u201d With Liang Guoming\u2019s flexible temperament, he would definitely force Liang Deyou to come to the hospital to apologize, so that is the reason why Liang Deyou brought so many supplements in his hands.But unfortunately, his good son did not inherit this traditional virtue from him. He has a dog temper and a pig brain, but he is not as good as either a pig or a dog.Liang Deyou was taken aback, thinking of his father\u2019s instructions and mother\u2019s plea before going out. He gritted his teeth and said after a long while: \u201cOn what condition are you willing to stand up and tell netizens that we just have a common misunderstanding, and I didn\u2019t mean to take action against you. As long as you are willing to withdraw the prosecution against my dad, whatever you want, we will try to satisfy you.\u201d\u201cIs there any special misunderstanding between us?\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting.\u201dLiang Deyou felt that Lu Chengyu\u2019s tone was wrong. When he looked up, the other party still had the fake expression that wanted to laugh. He was a little impatient: \u201cYou can tell me the number.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019m short of money?\u201d Lu Chengyu raised an eyebrow and smiled. After a few sounds, he said, \u201cMr. Liang, please go back, I don\u2019t think there is a so-called misunderstanding between us.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, don\u2019t forfeit a toast.\u201d Before Liang Deyou said this, he heard the door behind him being pushed open. Several doctors and nurses in white coats stood at the door, looking at each other on seeing this messy situation.The attending doctor frowned, and immediately said, \u201cMr. Lu, did you feel any discomfort today?\u201d\u201cThank you, I don\u2019t think there is any other problem except for a little dizziness.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled at them. They did checkup and other basic examinations.\u201cThe human brain is very complicated, dizziness seems to be a minor problem, but no one knows what is causing it,\u201d the attending doctor said. \u201cIn the last few days, you have to rest well, try to reduce emotional fluctuations, and press the call bell on the bedside if you want anything.\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d Lu Chengyu thanked the doctor, his eyes seemed to be swept to the messy ground unintentionally, and he smiled awkwardly at several medical staff.\u201cOkay, think about it yourself!\u201d Liang Deyou glanced at the people in the room, \u201cI will come to see you again this afternoon.\u201dThe door of the ward was heavily closed, and after a moment of silence, a nurse snorted and was glared at by the attending doctor.\u201cMr. Lu take a good rest, let\u2019s not bother him.\u201d The attending doctor glanced at the floor and asked the young nurse who had just sniffed and another nurse to help Lu Chengyu put away the things on the floor. When he reached the door, he stopped and turned to Lu Chengyu and said, \u201cOur hospital has very good security measures, please rest assured, Mr. Lu.\u201dLu Chengyu was taken aback for a moment, then nodded: \u201cI see, thank you.\u201d The two nurses cleared the tonics scattered around very neatly and placed them in the corner of the room. Seeing Lu Chengyu\u2019s head down, the young nurse couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cMr. Lu, don\u2019t worry, we are all on your side\u201d. After she said this, she suddenly remembered her current identity and coughed: \u201cAnyway, there are many people standing behind you, so\u2026\u201d She thought about the appropriate modifier, \u201cSo don\u2019t be afraid of threat from evil forces.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled to the young nurse, \u201cThank you.\u201d When the young nurse came out of the ward, he clutched her hot face and thought, alas, the way the male god laughs is absolutely charming, even in a hospital gown.The male god is indeed a male god.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After putting the bowls away, Yan Mu suddenly asked, \u201cHe threatened you?\u201d\u201cWho knows? He suddenly got inexplicably mad,\u201d Lu Chengyu jumped out of the bed, walked to the corner and searched within the pile of tonics a few times, and picked out a ginseng wrapped in a red high-end gift box from the middle. \u201cThe Liang family is so polite.\u201d After saying this, he threw the ginseng back into the pile of gifts and clapped his hands clean when he got up. He didn\u2019t dare to eat this dyed ginseng.Yan Mu knew that Lu Chengyu had no affection for Liang\u2019s family, so he didn\u2019t care about the pile of gifts. Instead, he took an apple and peeled it, cut it into several pieces and placed it on the plate. He turned to Lu Chengyu and said: \u201cThe previous matter has been accepted by the court. Now, what are your plans?\u201d\u201cJust do what I should do,\u201d Lu Chengyu saw Yan Mu took another apple and was peeling it, but the skin peeled off was a bit thick. He took the knife and apple from the opponent\u2019s hand, and cut the whole fruit very neatly, with only a thin skin being peeled off. This was what he was trained to do as a waiter, when he first started working in a hotel in his previous life.Yan Mu watched his movements, and then said after a long while: \u201cThis kind of case, the court will not judge severely.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d He put an apple slice into his mouth and slowly crushed it, Lu Chengyu smiled. \u201cHowever, the Liang family now is no longer the Liang family from before. If you blow a few more winds, maybe they will collapse on their own.\u201dYan Mu was silent, he could detect the negative emotions Lu Chengyu had hidden in the face of the Liang family father and son. Thinking that the death of Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents was related to the Liang family, he felt that it was not easy for Lu Chengyu to do this.Compared to the peace between the two, Liang Deyou seemed more embarrassed. He searched for Chen Jin all morning, but found nothing except the rented house that was empty. As a result, when he got home, he faced with an angry father and a crying mother.He asked incomprehensibly: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d When he left this morning, it was not like this at home. Why is it like a disaster?\u201cYou are not ashamed to ask what happened?\u201d Liang Guoming was trembling with anger. He wanted to slap his son to death, but he couldn\u2019t bear it. After a long time, he panted and said: \u201cYou go and see on the Internet, what everyone is saying about our family!\u201d With one hand, he dragged his son to the computer. He pointed to the post displayed on the computer desk, \u201cTake a good look!\u201dAfter reading the content of the post, Liang Deyou\u2019s original puzzled expression changed to anger, and he was so angry that he smashed the mouse. Pointing at the computer desktop, he said: \u201cThese people are all saying nonsense!\u201d What does it mean that he often bullied Lu Chengyu, and when did he often humiliate him? !And those things about his parents, these netizens don\u2019t think it\u2019s too big to see the excitement, and the unspecified news have also been exposed.\u201cRegardless of whether they are talking nonsense or not, but now things have reached this point, it has no way to end,\u201d Liang Guoming sat down on the sofa and took a puff of cigarettes in his hand. His expressions of majesty in the past has long since disappeared. \u201cThis time, we offended a person who shouldn\u2019t be offended. To think I, Liang Guoming, who has been mixed up for so many years, was actually defeated by a yellow-haired boy[1].\u201d\u201cHow could it be so serious,\u201d Liang Deyou\u2019s complexion turned pale. He calmly said, \u201cThese people on the Internet are just making trouble. After this period of time, they will have forgotten the matter .\u201d\u201cHow can it be so simple,\u201d Liang Guoming knew that there were some opponents behind this incident. There is such a good opportunity to eradicate him, how can those opponents miss it?He looked at Liang Deyou and said, \u201cYou are not young anymore. No matter how big the Liang family is left in the future, you still have to learn to manage well. No matter how good parents we are, we will not be able to protect you for a lifetime.\u201dLiang Deyou thought his father would as usual be angry for a while. That is why, he was about to get up and go back to the room, but he didn\u2019t expect Liang Guoming to say such a thing. He looked at Liang Guoming suspiciously, as if he wanted to know what the other person was thinking from his face.\u201cLao Liang\u2026\u201d Zhang Fang frowned slightly and thought for a while, \u201cOk, let\u2019s find someone to say that Lu Chengyu dislikes the compensation and often has trouble with Deyou, so Deyou has a conflict with him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Liang Guoming sighed, \u201cWe lost the initiative from the very beginning, he dragged the rhythm of walking, now, no matter what we say, in the eyes of others, we will only be unscrupulous people.\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that it?\u201d Zhang Fang looked at her husband and son blankly, and suddenly panicked. If this incident arouses public outrage too much, it will definitely attract the attention of the people above. If it is investigated\u2026Where is the Liang family clean?Zhang Fang\u2019s worries soon became true. Half an hour later, Liang Guoming, as the legal representative of the Liang family, was arrested by the police for various commercial crimes. The policemen who used to be polite to the Liang family now faced the Liang family without even a slight smile. When Liang Guoming was taken away, he was also handcuffed without leaving him any face.When Liang Guoming, who was in handcuffs, was taken out of the villa door by the police, shutters rang frantically all around. Liang Guoming had been beautiful for half his life, and now he looked up in shame. He bowed his head into the police car. With his head buried, he could still feel the lively gazes of the reporters outside even through the car window.The police car gradually drove out of the range of the villa, followed by some paparazzi cars, chasing so far, just to take a picture of Liang Guoming entering the police station.Liang Guoming was arrested. Some reporters tried every means to find Lu Chengyu\u2019s ward, only to learn that Lu Chengyu had already left the hospital in the afternoon. After they inquired about it, they found out from some patients that Liang Deyou rushed to the hospital early this morning and left shortly afterwards. His face was very bad when he left.As a result, at noon, Lu Chengyu, who had just finished lunch, left in a hurry, as if frightened.Nothing in this world could be more imaginative than a reporter\u2019s pen. They automatically made up a scene where a rich second-generation heir threatened a promising young person and the young person had no choice but to retreat. So, the content of the second edition tomorrow was also available.Soon a reporter posted on Weibo that Lu Chengyu was intimidated by Liang Deyou to be discharged from the hospital, adding a bucket of oil to the already very lively Weibo.At this time the poor and threatened young man Lu Chengyu was leaning on the sofa, drinking fresh juice, and watching news about Liang Guoming\u2019s arrest.On TV, Liang Guoming\u2019s wilted look reminded Lu Chengyu of the legendary entrepreneur\u2019s scenery in his previous life. Not only was he touted by the media, he also published a so-called \u201cLiang\u2019s Business Wisdom\u201d, which attracted countless ignorant young people.\u201cIt is reported that Liang Guoming may be suspected of multiple crimes. As to whether he is convicted of the crimes, the relevant departments are investigating, and our station will continue to follow up the matter for follow-up reports.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgAfter the female reporter said this, she switched to the next news screen, \u201cI just mentioned the super high box office of \u201cFlying Birds\u201d, and discussed the fight against piracy from this matter, to the effect that piracy causes many commercial losses, and how many investors will become less and less interested in the film industry. This is not conducive to the development of the film industry in the long run.Lu Chengyu changed the channel and lay on a lounge sofa, feeling that his life like this was a bit lonely, so he took a book on the arm of the sofa and started reading it.As a result, he fell asleep after a while. For him, the world masterpiece is the best hypnosis. When it was almost dinner time, he was awakened by the ringing of his cell phone. After picking up, he realized that it was Yan Mu.He walked to the balcony and stood still, watching the sunset in the sky, he stretched his waist, \u201cBoss, why did you call?\u201d\u201cI heard that you were discharged from the hospital, so I called to ask,\u201d Yan Mu, the voice was as flat as ever, \u201cDid you have dinner?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ll go out to eat right away,\u201d Lu Chengyu yawned, \u201cRight, boss, did you see the data sheet I sent you?\u201d\u201cI have seen it. Don\u2019t worry about things at work,\u201d Yan Mu\u2019s voice paused, \u201cyou can take a good rest for a day and report to the company the day after tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThank you so much, boss,\u201d Lu Chengyu responded with a smile. It\u2019s not that he is unwilling to go to work, but that he needs to perform a full set of acting. Since he is \u201cforced\u201d to be discharged, why shouldn\u2019t he stay at home for a day or two? Regardless of whether Yan Mu understood his mind or not, in any case, the other party\u2019s move helped him a lot.After eating at the small restaurant downstairs, Lu Chengyu\u2019s cell phone rang again. He saw that it was an unfamiliar number, and he hesitated before picking it up.\u201cI used to think that I could get rid of my poor origins and get ahead in the capital.\u201d Chen Jin stood at the crowded train station. The ticket collector had already begun to check tickets. He dragged his suitcase with his right hand and spoke into the mobile phone in his left hand. \u201cI understand now. I am not suitable for a place like Beijing. This place is too impetuous and lively. People like me cannot adapt to this kind of life.\u201dLu Chengyu stood under the tree, half-yellow leaves fell in front of him, and there was no sound.\u201cMaybe I won\u2019t be able to see you face to face in the future,\u201d Chen Jin handed the ticket to the ticket collector, watching him cut a hole in the ticket, as if cutting off something in his heart, and feeling inexplicably relieved, \u201cThank you for this. You has taken care of me, maybe by the next time we see each other, it will already be a matter of the past.\u201dLu Chengyu stretched out his hand to catch a fallen leaf and said with a smile: \u201cAt that time we will be more and more successful.\u201d\u201cYes, more and more successful,\u201d Chen Jin and other passengers who were going to take the train crossed the passage, and then found the number of the carriage on the platform. After getting on the train, he watched the staff on the platform blew the whistle, and the train started slowly.\u201cGoodbye, Lu Chengyu.\u201d A smile appeared at the corner of his mouth, but the corners of his eyes were already slightly red.Cruelly hanging up the phone, he turned it off, took out the SIM card inside, walked to the smoking area on the train, and threw the card out the window.In fact, he should have left earlier. Fortunately, it\u2019s not too late to leave now.\u201cGoodbye.\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at the phone which indicated that the call was over, and sighed. Putting the phone in his pocket, he walked towards home step by step unhurriedly.People passed by in a hurry. To Chen Jin, he was just a passer-by in his memory. Maybe a few years later, when the other person thinks of him again, he would just sigh, oh, I had a good impression of this person before, but then it was not meant to be.Some feelings are so beautiful but so unrealistic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as he entered the company\u2019s gate, a few security guards approached him with a smile and asked about his injuries. There was even a guy who gave him a bag of home-grown walnuts that were said to be good for the brain.When passing by the front desk, the beautiful front desk girl also smiled like a spring breeze and asked him how he was doing and why he didn\u2019t rest for a few more days. Then Lu Chengyu got two more boxes of walnuts and peanut milk.After entering the elevator, he exchanged greetings with colleagues who were in the same elevator. After he arrived in his office and put down the things in his hands, he smiled helplessly. Today, these colleagues were really enthusiastic.Thinking of the things about his parents exposed on the Internet, the smile on his face suddenly faded, looking down at the walnuts, peanut milk, native walnuts on the table, and the breakfast that a colleague in the elevator gave him, he smiled helplessly.When Cao Jingshen came to see Lu Chengyu, he saw Lu Chengyu drinking with a box of milk in one hand and tapping on the keyboard with the other hand. It seemed that he was completely unaffected by the previous events. He coughed, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you rest for two more days?\u201d \u201cThere is nothing wrong with a person resting at home, if he/she is sick\u201d. Lu Chengyu threw the empty milk carton into the trash and brought a glass of water for Cao Jingshen.\u201cCao Ge how come you are here?\u201d\u201c I\u2019m here to get the report that I asked you to do last time.\u201d Cao Jingshen adjusted his facial expression, \u201cbut you are not in good health these days, you may have not done it, so I will do it for you this time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve done it,\u201d Lu Chengyu knew that Cao Jingshen was actually worried about his body, and just because of wanting face didn\u2019t want to admit it. He got up and turned out the completed report and gave it to Cao Jingshen, \u201cYesterday I was bored at home alone, so I found it out. You can see if there are any problems.\u201d\u201cDuring the vacation, why did you do this? ,\u201d Cao Jingshen frowned. After receiving the report, he looked at Lu Chengyu several times, \u201cAre you really okay? Don\u2019t work forcefully, your body won\u2019t be able to bear it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Brother Cao, it\u2019s all right, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Lu Chengyu knew that Cao Jingshen was actually worried about his body, and said with a smile, \u201cWould you like me to do a set of broadcast exercises for you to prove that I am fine?\u201dCao Jingshen pushed his glasses up his nose, \u201cI\u2019m just worried that you will fall behind in your progress.\u201d He stood up, put his hand on the water drained paper cup and then threw it into the trash.\u201cIf you do not have any problem, go attend to the worksheet that I arranged for the boss before, and I will go down.\u201dHe just walked out the door and saw the boss standing a few steps away, with a pensive expression on his face. Cao Jingshen immediately took a stop and turned towards Yan Mu, \u201cBoss, are you looking for Assistant Lu for something?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Yan Mu gave him a silent look. \u201cI\u2019m looking for you.\u201dCao Jingshen turned his head and glanced behind him silently. He paused at the assistant\u2019s room door: \u201cWhat can the boss ask me for?\u201dWhen does the boss leave the office to call him, is there something wrong with the internal phone in the office?Don\u2019t be kidding, if that\u2019s the case, the people in the logistics department would be facing deductions from their wages.Yan Mu turned around and opened the door of his office. After entering the office, he said to Cao Jingshen who followed in: \u201cLiang Guoming was arrested and the company he founded was in a slump due to this incident. I heard that since yesterday, some people have bought Liang\u2019s scattered stocks, do you know about this?\u201dAs the president, he needed to do a lot of things every day, and he also needed to pay attention to the movements of his opponent\u2019s company. So as soon as something appeared wrong with the Liang company, he started to stare, otherwise he really couldn\u2019t have found out the problem.\u201cI asked someone to check it last night,\u201d Cao Jingshen took out a piece of information from the folder in his hand, \u201cbut it was only found out this morning. This is the information passed by the investigator. When the information was handed out, the expression on his face was a bit embarrassing, because this matter had a lot to do with Yan Mu.\u201cSong Junyan\u2026\u201d Yan Mu glanced at the information and said in a flat tone, \u201cIt seems that my father saved a lot of money for this illegitimate child.\u201dWhat his father said to him at the beginning seemed to be inconsistent with reality. However, he had never believed much of what the other party said, so he was not surprised that this kind of thing happened.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d As a secretary, Cao Jingshen was not very good at dealing with the boss\u2019s family affairs, but Song Junyan was unpredictable, and there was no real respect between him and the boss. If it weren\u2019t for the shock of the Yan family\u2019s background, he was afraid that Song Hongsi would have entered the house after Mrs. Yan died of illness, which shows the thoughts and skills of the mother and child.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him, even if he becomes one of Liang company\u2019s shareholders, what can he do?\u201d Yan Mu put down the investigation data in his hand, \u201cThe Liang company is now in chaos and lacks funds, but the people in power are Liang Deyou and Zhang Fang, Song Junyan can only face powerlessness. At most, he can participate in decision-making, but he won\u2019t have the final decision-making power.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Cao Jingshen knew he didn\u2019t have the vision and ability, so he just said, \u201cIt\u2019s just that this person has taken a risk again. Coming out, it makes people feel a little bit responsive.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t put him in your eyes, you won\u2019t need to respond.\u201d Yan Mu said with a stern face and carelessly, \u201cI don\u2019t have so much time to play with kids like him.\u201d Cao Jingshen felt that if Song Junyan heard this, he would not be so complacent.\u201cBoss, I also heard the news that Shengrong Company in City S seems to be interested in entering the capital.\u201d Cao Jingshen frowned when he thought of the president of Shengrong Company. He was a smiling fox, who smiled better than anyone else. But his methods were more ruthless than anyone else, \u201cThis person has always changed his style and is difficult to deal with.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t move,\u201d Yan Mu said with a serious expression, \u201cSheng Shaoyuan has his methods, and I also have my methods. He wants to come to the capital to grab the market from me, so let him come.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Cao Jingshen put down the folder, \u201cIt contains some information from Shengrong Company. If you have nothing else you need from me, I\u2019ll go back to the office first, thank you.\u201dYan Mu nodded to him, than he lowered his head and thought over some things that were not easy to know about Shengrong Company.In the assistant\u2019s room, Lu Chengyu looked at the latest news from the business community on the computer, and then saw that Liang\u2019s new person in charge formally entered the board of directors today, with a photo of Liang Deyou wearing a suit and tie. Interestingly, the number of comments under this news is more than that of entertainment news, but most of them are negative comments, and some people even bluntly said that the Liang family should go bankrupt.The news was still about the Liang\u2019s topic, saying that a young new shareholder also entered the Liang\u2019s board of directors today, and also introduced the person\u2019s education. The graduate student who had returned from studying abroad was handsome, dignified, with a smile on the corners of his mouth. The commenters really had a taste of elites.Lu Chengyu looked at the photo of the new shareholder known as Song. Although he looked good, he had a narrow forehead and thin lips. He touched his chin and closed the webpage. According to the theory of face, such people don\u2019t have any heart and are uninterested. They are not the first choice for making friends. He does not know if this kind of statement is reliable. Anyway, this person did not suit his eyes.When he went to the cafeteria for lunch at noon, Lu Chengyu received a lot of people\u2019s greetings. Even the auntie shook his hand and scooped a few more spare ribs for him. When she handed him the lunch plate, the aunt also smiled and said: \u201cYoung people should eat more for their body.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cThank you.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled sincerely, and when he walked to sit next to Yan Mu, the smile on his face had not disappeared.\u201cIn a good mood?\u201d Yan Mu glanced at Lu Chengyu\u2019s lunch plate, the food in it was about to overflow, and the amount was even more than his boss.\u201cVery good,\u201d Lu Chengyu nodded, \u201cThere are so many good people in the world.\u201dAlthough these are just trivial things, but people are willing to do it, which is a kind of goodwill. Although he does not like others to sympathize with himself, he does not think that sympathy is an insult. No one is a big idler. It\u2019s the kindness of others to take time to sympathize with you.\u201cDid you thank the canteen aunty?\u201d Cao Jingshen sat across from the two of them, and saying this, he also picked a spare rib from Lu Chengyu\u2019s plate, \u201cSo many dishes, can you finish it?\u201d\u201cI will try my best,\u201d Lu Chengyu hadn\u2019t moved his chopsticks. Before he started eating, he gave another spare rib to Yan Mu, \u201cYou guys help me eat some too.\u201dCao Jingshen noticed his skilful actions when picking vegetables for Yan Mu, and raised his eyebrows, \u201cOkay, I will help you eat the ribs, and you can eat potato chips by yourself.\u201d\u201cOkay, Brother Cao , don\u2019t bully me honestly.\u201d Lu Chengyu picked up a piece of spare ribs and stuffed it into his mouth, and said after a quick bite, \u201cNext time you ask the aunty in the cafeteria to scoop more for you. The premise is that you do a beauty treatment to make yourself look younger and tenderer.\u201d\u201cYour mouth is so cheap, do the other female employees in the company know about it?\u201d Cao Jingshen took off his glasses and gave him a blank look. He wasn\u2019t ashamed to call himself honest, he almost didn\u2019t recognize the two words honest.\u201cI have always been gentle with female compatriots, of course they don\u2019t know it.\u201d Since the last time the three went to M City together, Lu Chengyu and Cao Jingshen have become more and more comfortable getting along with each other. The teasing odds are getting higher and higher, \u201cBesides, where am I being so mean, isn\u2019t it just to give you a suggestion?\u201d\u201cHonesty is a human virtue,\u201d Yan Mu said lightly on the side, \u201cHowever, sometimes it is better not to speak when you are being too honest.\u201d\u201cIf you have a new love, you will forget your old love.\u201d Cao Jingshen silently took a bite of food. \u201cBoss, didn\u2019t you always used to work without food and sleep?\u201d\u201cOccasionally I can talk about interesting topics.\u201d Yan Mu glanced at him and began to eat the ribs that Lu Chengyu gave him.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say that you sacrificed your honour for a few spare ribs?\u201d Cao Jingshen put on his glasses back, and he tried to see the ugly face of the capitalist.Yan Mu looked up at him and didn\u2019t answer his question, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t you who said that you want to eat and sleep?\u201d After saying this, he continued to lower his head to eat.It turned out that this kind of topic is meaningless for the boss, and there is no need to speak? This kind of boss who is usually not irritating but suddenly changed really make you fell helpless.He didn\u2019t know why, Cao Jingshen had a kind of illusion that his boss deliberately said to make Lu Chengyu happy. Although he doubted the accuracy of this intuition, he thought of the things he had seen about Lu Chengyu on the Internet before, and he felt that it was possible for the boss to do this kind of thing.Because even he himself, after seeing those things, couldn\u2019t help but want to rush to the Liang family to drag Liang Deyou out and beat him up. It\u2019s not that he is not calm, but that kind of stuff is too disgusting.The people in the cafeteria who were worried about Lu Chengyu, saw Lu Chengyu eating happily as usual, with a smile on his face, and were relieved and moved, and felt that he could deal with so many things indifferently. Assistant Lu really deserves to be treated. Those people on the Internet called him male god, and even they wanted to call him male god.After getting off work in the afternoon, when Lu Chengyu returned home, he found that a moving company was moving furniture upstairs. He didn\u2019t care too much. It was a new community anyway, and it was normal for new residents to move in.The two workers who moved the refrigerator saw that he was about to enter the elevator were too embarrassed to squeeze with him. They were ready to wait for another elevator to get down. Lu Chengyu said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can come in.\u201d He glanced at the two of them and pressed the necessary button. It turns out that the new tenant is upstairs. One of the workers said: \u201cSir, thank you, we didn\u2019t want squeeze you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, \u201cYou can\u2019t squeeze me in such a large space.\u201d When the elevator arrived, he got out of the elevator. The two workers were thanking him, but he smiled helplessly, watched the elevator doors closed, and turned back to his home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Uncle Liu knocked on the car window and raised what he was holding.Upon seeing this, Lu Chengyu hurriedly rolled down the car window and said to the uncle in his fifties, \u201cUncle Liu, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dSome time ago, Uncle Liu fell on his leg while changing the lights in the corridor of the community. He happened to be passing by and met him, so he drove him to the hospital. Later, the doctor said that the bones were misaligned and there was no major problem. However, since then, Uncle Liu smiled every time he saw him, and sometimes he would give him some local specialties from his hometown, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes. Although they are not valuable things, they were still of great interest. Although Lu Chengyu accepted the things, he wouldn\u2019t take them for anything, so he sometimes found out some of his notebooks before the college entrance examination or some snacks that young people liked for Uncle Liu to bring to his family\u2019s youngest daughter who was preparing for the college entrance examination.After going back and forth, the two became familiar with each other. Usually, when Lu Chengyu went to work, Uncle Liu would always pay attention to the surroundings of Lu Chengyu\u2019s house when he was patrolling. After all, for Uncle Liu, Lu Chengyu lived by himself, even if he had a car and a house, it was not easy. It would be troublesome if someone broke into the house and stole something.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, just a few days ago the child fried some peanuts. You can try it with your colleagues.\u201d Uncle Liu felt that sharing some snacks among colleagues can promote feelings. Lu Chengyu, a young guy, may not understand this, but it is required to remind each other in this way, \u201cIf you like it, next time I will take you to the famous multi-fried point.\u201d\u201cIn this kind of weather you most like to eat peanuts, so I will not be polite,\u201d Lu Chengyu accepted with a smile, and then said a few words to Uncle Liu. Uncle Liu remembered that Lu Chengyu had to go to work, and said hurriedly, \u201cBy the way, I have something to tell you.\u201dHe looked around then he put his head near Lu Chengyu\u2019s ear and whispered: \u201cXiao Lu, I heard a colleague say that someone was inquiring about you some time ago.\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s eyes changed slightly, but his face still smiled: \u201cI am such an ordinary person, who is spying on me?\u201dUncle Liu said solemnly: \u201cYou are young and you don\u2019t know how good you are. I\u2019m afraid it is that rich man surnamed Liang who is asking for trouble, and the new tenant who moved upstairs yesterday also asked about your news. In case, he and the Liang surname are together, that might cause you trouble. Are they giving you trouble?\u201d\u201cI see, thank you, Uncle Liu.\u201d The smile on Lu Chengyu\u2019s face faded. After thanking Uncle Liu several times, he drove away and asked about the new resident upstairs. With some interest, he thought about whoever made a special trip to move to this community for him, the rent in this community is not cheap, if it is to buy a house, it is an even bigger sum of money.\u201cOld Liu, what are you telling Mr. Lu?\u201d In the security booth, a security guard stuck his head out of the window and glanced in the direction where Lu Chengyu\u2019s car was leaving. \u201cI said, you treat Mr. Lu as half a son. That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense?\u201d Uncle Liu knew that his colleague was joking, and said with a smile, \u201cI just brought Mr. Lu some peanuts from my own home, what can I say.\u201dThe security guard also knew what happened to Lu Chengyu recently, after all, it was on TV. He sighed and said, \u201cThis Mr. Lu is indeed a good person. It\u2019s a pity\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a pity that he has no parents. From now on, there will always be some trouble in getting married.Uncle Liu also sighed when he heard the words. It was a pity that he knew what his colleagues meant. But Mr. Lu had a house and a car, and thus he could find a good girl.During the peak hours of work, there were always a lot of cars and people. When Lu Chengyu waited for the traffic lights, he couldn\u2019t help frowning when he remembered what Uncle Liu had said. Who on earth was inquiring about him specifically and even moved to this community for that purpose?An impatient prince like Liang Deyou was not the kind of person who could do this kind of thing. After all, it was too difficult for Liang Deyou to understand the enemy\u2019s situation before taking such a step.When he arrived at the company, Lu Chengyu went to the secretarial department to get Yan Mu\u2019s day schedule before returning to his office. Then he received a call from Zhang Dao. It turned out that someone from a TV station wanted to interview him, but he couldn\u2019t find anyone as a point of contact, so had to ask Zhang Dao.After learning that it was an intellectual talk show, Lu Chengyu hesitated for a moment and said: \u201cYou tell the person in charge of the show that I only have time on weekends. If the other party doesn\u2019t mind, I can accept the invitation to the show.\u201dHe knew that this show was a court variety show. A TV show with good ratings, the style tended to be serious and sentimental, and most of the reports were on the positive image of the interviewee, which is different from many local stations that were mainly funny, so he didn\u2019t need to worry too much.Director Zhang knew that Lu Chengyu had no intention of becoming an artist, but this invitation was really difficult to refuse. He was relieved when Lu Chengyu agreed. After all, the recent incidents had been turbulent, and \u201cFlying Birds\u201d had not yet been released. Lu Chengyu was also the target of many reporters\u2019 attention. These people weren\u2019t able to approach Lu Chengyu and could only find him as he had some relationship with him.Other TV stations or reporters were refused because Lu Chengyu was still recuperating, but they still needed to take care of the court variety show. Fortunately, Lu Chengyu had a clear idea, otherwise, they would have been a little embarrassed.After hanging up the phone, Lu Chengyu put his mobile phone aside, although he was a little bit worried and awed by the idea of appearing in a court variety show, on the surface, he was still very calm.He met with a customer in the morning. After negotiation of the terms between the two parties, he breathed a sigh of relief and began to follow up the research on the product of environmental purification. The product had been developed, but the results were still being tested. Lu Chengyu was not in a hurry but only required that the product must have actual effects, instead of blowing up the product as supernatural as some companies tended to do. It did not affect me at all.After working on these things, he heard that two employees in the lower department had a conflict. The matter was a bit serious. The department manager had to report to him, and he went to meditate again.When the matter was satisfactorily processed, it was already 12:30. He hurried to the staff canteen. As expected, there were no good dishes left. He went to the small stir-fry area and ordered two dishes. Just halfway through the meal, he received a call from Cao Jingshen and was told that someone from above will come to the company to inspect and let him hurry up and make preparations.Recently, the Liang family has had such a big problem, so all the companies that have investment real estate under its umbrella have received cordial visits from the relevant departments in recent days. Large companies like Huading were naturally no exception.After a quick meal, when he rushed to the president\u2019s office, there were already several people in it, all of whom were senior management of Huading. Seeing these people\u2019s serious expressions, Lu Chengyu knew that this inspection was not a formality, so he looked at Yan Mu in silence.Yan Mu was the calmest one. After seeing Lu Chengyu coming in, he said: \u201cThe people above are coming to inspect, we can do our job, and you don\u2019t have to worry about the others.\u201dOne of the managers hesitated and said, \u201cBoss, I heard that a company was fined this morning.\u201d\u201cThat company didn\u2019t follow the rules and regulations. It was self-evident to find out that it was fined.\u201dYan Mu signed his name on a document and handed it to Cao Jingshen, \u201cI never doubt your ability to do things, so what are you worried about?\u201dAs soon as he said this, Lu Chengyu saw that the expressions of these executives had a little bit of joy, and their expressions became calmer. It can be seen that they usually don\u2019t see such encouragement. It was encouraging to hear such a sentence from the boss After these people left, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with this kind of thing, do I need to prepare something in advance?\u201dCao Jingshen specifically called Lu Chengyu to teach him something, so he said, \u201cYou follow me. You will get to know everything.\u201dLu Chengyu had a strong comprehension ability. Even if he had not encountered these things before, as long as he had done it once, Lu Chengyu will do better the next time.As the boss, Yan Mu could not easily intervene in certain matters among employees. Therefore, Cao Jingshen was willing to ask Lu Chengyu to participate in these matters, and he was also willing to teach the other party a lot of things. This was unexpected to Yan Mu.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgColleagues fighting between colleagues is not a strange thing. It is common for old staff to be jealous of the newcomer\u2019s ability to do things. Therefore, Cao Jingshen and Lu Chengyu\u2019s way of getting along with each other saved Yan Mu, who valued the abilities of both of them.Lu Chengyu is not a fool, and naturally understands Cao Jingshen\u2019s good intentions. He smiled and followed Cao Jingshen to process the data. Hearing some secrets in the industry, the smile on his face became more and more obvious.\u201cDon\u2019t smile at me like that,\u201d Cao Jingshen looked at Lu Chengyu\u2019s brilliant smile, pushing his glasses up his nose and saying, \u201cNo matter how handsomely you smile, I won\u2019t look at you more.\u201dLu Chengyu held a bunch of documents and blinked innocently.\u201cBrother Cao is ruthless.\u201d\u201cI could be more ruthless.\u201d Cao Jingshen put another thick pile of materials on top of the pile of materials that Lu Chengyu was holding, and lifted his chin. \u201cBring it to the eighth-floor foreign conference room.\u201dLu Chengyu took the pile of information to the door, suddenly turned, and said:\u201d Cao Ge, you\u2019ll have to seriously faceplate, not like the bad guys, or do the hardest hit, I will not laugh at you.\u201d\u201cRoll, Go away, don\u2019t put gold on your face.\u201d Cao Jingshen raised his foot and kicked Lu Chengyu\u2019s leg, but the uneasiness on his face was fully revealed.Lu Chengyu smiled and rushed into the elevator holding the documents. Cao Jingshen stood in the corridor, looked at the closed elevator door, and sighed. It was obvious that he was eight years older than Lu Chengyu, but he felt like a father. But thinking of hearing Lu Chengyu\u2019s relatives\u2019 discussion in the hotel a few months ago, he felt a lot softer for the kid, even though the kid was cheap and pretentious. But no matter what, he is still an unobtrusive young man.Sure enough, the people who came down for inspection arrived soon afterward. Although these people didn\u2019t put on a serious face, the employees of Huading could still perceive the difference in the atmosphere. When these people came, they first read various qualification certificates, then various tax forms, and asked a lot of questions. In the end, these talents finally praised Huading. One of the civilians was still on Huading\u2019s list. A row of hooks was hit at the back.Before leaving, the official who shook hands with Yan Mu and said goodbye, said with a smile: \u201cAs expected of Huading, the rules and regulations are followed strictly and reasonably. This time, your company must be on the list of praise from the court.\u201dNo wonder it was so strict this time because it would be criticized or praised on TV.\u201cThis is due to your good supervision,\u201d Yan Mu shook hands with the other party a few times, his tone calm but with a bit of seriousness that convinced others, \u201cThis is everyone\u2019s credit.\u201dThe officials smiled happily. After all, this is their jurisdiction. There is no problem inside Huading, and it is also a good reputation for them. It is enough to have a heart-stirring Liang family. If such a big Huading had problems as well, they will be notified and criticized when they go back.His gaze fell on Lu Chengyu behind Yan Mu and he specifically emphasized: \u201cThis President Yan\u2019s assistant, he is a young talent.\u201dLu Chengyu responded modestly at the moment and waited for these people to get in the car and leave. Then only he breathed a sigh of relief. Today these people\u2019s problems were tricky. Fortunately, Cao Jingshen was here, otherwise, he would not be able to deal with it alone.This also reflected his lack of certain abilities. After all, although he has a lot of work experience in previous lives, due to the different nature of the work, it is impossible to be perfect.Cao Jingshen once again looked at Lu Chengyu with admiration. After all, a young man with less than a year of working experience can deal with this situation calmly and without stage fright. It is really rare. This is much better than what he did in the past.Lu Chengyu\u2019s performance this time also fell into the eyes of other executives of the company. No matter whether these people are jealous or are admiring, they all acknowledged Lu Chengyu\u2019s workability and way of dealing with others, so he left a terrifying impression of himself on the executive\u2019s heart.They had some doubts when Lu Chengyu joined the Huading Group, but the boss and General Secretary Cao both had this meaning, and they didn\u2019t want to say much. It\u2019s no big deal to let him talk less.Who knew that after the inspector came, they didn\u2019t know what happened, but he took a fancy to Lu Chengyu, the youngest member of the Huading Group, and asked him a lot of questions from beginning to end. Along the way, everyone was sweating in their hearts. Unexpectedly, Lu Chengyu responded fluently. Not only did he not lose the chain of thought, but he also satisfied the other party. Even the inspecting officials deliberately praised him when he left.No wonder the boss appointed him as an assistant early on. It would be a waste of such a capable person to be delegated to work as an ordinary employee.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t care what others thought of him. After the inspection, he sorted all the materials back into the database. When he returned to the office, he saw Yan Mu standing by the window, apparently waiting for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing Yan Mu turned his head to look at himself, he said, \u201cBoss, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d He even made a special trip to his office to wait for him.Yan Mu didn\u2019t want to admit that he had been worried just now, so he walked to Lu Chengyu\u2019s office unconsciously. He looked away from Lu Chengyu, walked from the window to sit on the guest sofa, \u201cI came here to tell you, what happened to the Liang family.\u201d\u201cWhat happened to the Liang family?\u201d Lu Chengyu had no good impressions of the Liang family. He frowned slightly when Yan Mu mentioned the Liang family. \u201cThis inspection was also caused by the Liang family. Could it be that they made trouble again? What happened?\u201d\u201cLiang has a new major shareholder on the board of directors,\u201d Yan Mu looked up at Lu Chengyu, \u201cThat shareholder is my father\u2019s illegitimate son outside.\u201d\u201cYou mean Song Junyan?\u201d Lu Chengyu remembered what he saw before. Song Junyan and Yan Mu don\u2019t look alike at all in the pictures. Judging from the appearance, he really couldn\u2019t tell that the two were half-brothers. He thought for a moment and said, \u201cYou mean, he is going to use the Liang family to fight against our Huading?\u201dYan Mu saw Lu Chengyu\u2019s expression. With some anger, the expression on his face gradually softened, \u201cHe cannot be on stage with Huading now, I am just worried that he will start with people around me.\u201dAlthough this was brief, Lu Chengyu heard the worry in Yan Mu\u2019s words. He smiled at Yan Mu: \u201cBoss, don\u2019t worry, I am not afraid of a real prince like Liang Deyou, let alone Song Junyan. Besides, I am the assistant to the president of Huading, how can he deal with me?\u201dYan Mu frowned. He moved slightly, hesitated, and said: \u201cSong Junyan is very good at provoking people\u2019s hearts, so\u2026\u201d He almost knotted his eyebrows, obviously not accustomed to speaking like this.\u201cThe boss is worried that he will provoke the relationship between the two of us?\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I am your assistant, how can I believe other people\u2019s words.\u201dYan Mu looked at the smile on his face and his mouth squeezed uncomfortably: \u201cThank you, and you performed well this afternoon. I still have documents to deal with, so I\u2019ll go out first.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at his back for a moment, then laughed.Thank you for these few words?It\u2019s\u2026 it makes people feel funny and close. After all, sometimes silly bosses are more humane.He walked to the desk and saw an extra box of tea on the table. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh again. Is the main purpose of the boss coming to his office to give him a box of tea?After coming home from work, Lu Chengyu just got into the elevator when he saw a young man wearing rimless glasses coming in. He stepped aside and saw that the other party had pressed 7, which was the number of floors upstairs.The young man looked at him carefully, and suddenly said with joy, \u201cAre you, Mr. Lu?\u201d This man had fair skin and a clean smell.\u201cI like your role as rich and handsome. I didn\u2019t expect it. We live in the same building.\u201d The elevator door slowly closed, and the young man still said with joy, \u201d Can you autograph for me?\u201d\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t bring a pen, next time,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled apologetically, and said shyly, \u201cI will sign it for you next time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d the young man Junxiu\u2019s face smiled wider, \u201cNext time I will bring paper and pen.\u201d The elevator door opened. When the floor where Lu Chengyu was located appeared, he walked out of the elevator, not forgetting to turn his head and smiled at the young man: \u201cGoodbye.\u201d\u201cGoodbye!\u201d The young man smiled and waved to Lu Chengyu, and the elevator door slowly closed to isolate the expressions of the two.Lu Chengyu\u2019s smile gradually disappeared, his index finger gently stroked his chin, and he said to himself: \u201cSong Junyan\u2026\u201dYan Mu is in stark contrast with this bastard brother. The former has very few expressions, and the latter has rich expressions. His smile is full of sunshine and vigor, which makes people unconsciously feel close to him.\u201cGood acting skills, it\u2019s a waste of a good seed not to go to the showbiz.\u201d Lu Chengyu opened the door of his house and entered the house with a smile. He likes watching other people acting the most. How interesting.Song Junyan walked out of the elevator, the smile on his face disappeared without a trace. This Lu Chengyu, as he knew it, was gentle, friendly, and personable.However, he is such a person to who he can calculate better and get closer.The next morning, when Lu Chengyu came downstairs, he heard someone calling him behind him. When he looked back, he saw Song Junyan coming out of another elevator room, wearing casual clothes, looking like a brother next door.\u201cMr. Lu, are you going to work?\u201d Song Junyan took two steps quickly, walked to Lu Chengyu, took a pen and paper from his pocket, scratched his head embarrassedly, \u201cPlease sign your name.\u201dLu Chengyu took the pen and paper, quickly After signing his name in his signature book, \u201cDon\u2019t use honorific names to me, we are similar in age, don\u2019t be so polite.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cHey,\u201d Song Jun smiled honestly and didn\u2019t say whether it was good or not. He took a look at the autographed book and saw that it was not Lu Chengyu\u2019s name, but \u201cGao Fushuai\u201d. This is the name of the character played by Lu Chengyu. The homophonic is Gao Fushuai, which is in sharp contrast with the leading actor Cao Gen.\u201cHaha\u2026., Mr. Lu\u2019s handwriting is so beautiful,\u201d Song Junyan smiled and closed the signature book. Seeing Lu Chengyu wearing a suit, he asked, \u201cAre you going to work?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed, \u201call for affording a bowl of food, our boss is very serious, and if you are late, your salary will be deducted.\u201d He pretended to look at Song Junyan unintentionally, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go to work?\u201d Since the other party insisted on using his honorific name, he too didn\u2019t force it.\u201cIt\u2019s not too busy these days,\u201d Song Junyan said with a smile, \u201cThen I won\u2019t delay you, let\u2019s talk together if we have time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, then I\u2019ll take one step ahead,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled sternly at Song Jun, \u201cI don\u2019t dare to offend the boss.\u201d He waved his hand and turned to leave.Song Junyan watched Lu Chengyu\u2019s leaving back. After seeing him driving away, he turned and walked back. When passing the trash can by the elevator, he threw the autograph book in his hand and sneered, \u201cSuch a tender assistant, Yan Mu\u2019s eyes are getting worse and worse.\u201dSuddenly, his brow furrowed and he glanced back in the direction where Lu Chengyu was leaving. No, this is not necessarily the true face of Lu Chengyu, he needed to observe before he can conclude.Fighting against people most requires avoiding carelessness. This is one of the principles his mother taught him to compete with others.Lu Chengyu rushed to the company on time, went to the secretarial department for a walk after punching the card, and then went upstairs to make a cup of tea to start a new day\u2019s work.After finishing the documents that he needed to deal with, he turned around and made a cup of tea, and brought it to the president\u2019s room. Although Song Junyan\u2019s intentions were temporarily unknown, he felt that it was necessary to tell Yan Mu about this matter.Yan Mu held the tea made by Lu Chengyu. After listening to Lu Chengyu\u2019s description, he frowned and said, \u201cHe asked for your signature?\u201dLu Chengyu nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDid you give it to him?\u201d Yan Mu asked after taking a sip of tea, he didn\u2019t know why, he thought Lu Chengyu smiled strangely at this time.\u201cBoss, you know, I\u2019m always good at talking,\u201d Lu Chengyu said with a smile, \u201cMr. Song also praised me for writing these three words well.\u201dYan Mu\u2019s mouth moved upward in a small arc: \u201cYeah. He praised you very well.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled at Yan Mu and saw Yan Mu\u2019s other hand that didn\u2019t hold the teacup unconsciously touching the pen several times. He thought that the other party had something to do, so he stood up and said, \u201d Boss, this is what happened, so I\u2019ll go out first.\u201dYan Mu looked at the pen in his hand and the work notebook in front of him, and nodded slowly: \u201cOkay.\u201dAfter the door closed and other office drawers and took out several files with the signature Lu Chengyu, after a long while frowned and said to himself, \u201cLu Chengyu still looks better than other words.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 38.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 38.1In the next few days, Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t meet Song Junyan very often, they just occasionally met each other, and the other party only greeted him politely. Naturally, Lu Chengyu regarded him as an ordinary neighbor, never asking about the other party\u2019s private affairs, so there was a strange harmony in the communication.After a few days of observation, Lu Chengyu found that Song Junyan was very scheming and should not be taken lightly. He personally thought that it is human nature to have a gap in his chest, but to put all his energy on calculating others is a bit crooked. He doesn\u2019t really appreciate this kind of person. In contrast, he still prefers people like Cao Jingshen and Yan Mu.On Friday afternoon, the company held a summary meeting. As Yan Mu\u2019s assistant, Lu Chengyu sat beside Yan Mu the whole time. Because of the serious quality problems of Liang\u2019s real estate this time, Huading Real Estate, which was named and praised, had seen a significant increase in the real estate transaction volume in recent days. This was a rare phenomenon in the housing market that has gradually weakened in the past year. This made many senior executives happy, and Lu Chengyu himself was happy, because he still had 3% Huading shares.At the meeting, Lu Chengyu was specially praised by Yan Mu. Other executives seemed to agree with Yan Mu\u2019s praise of Lu Chengyu. When the meeting was over, the atmosphere among everyone was very good.However, Lu Chengyu discovered that although Yan Mu looked as usual throughout the meeting, there seemed to be something wrong. After these executives left, he walked up to Yan Mu and asked in a low voice: \u201cBoss, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dYan Mu shook his head: \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dLu Chengyu saw that his cheeks were a little red, and he stretched out his hand to touch his forehead, then frowned: \u201cYour forehead is so hot, is this all right?!\u201d He handed the work notes in his hand. Cao Jingshen on one side said, \u201cBrother Cao, help me get it. I\u2019ll take the boss to the hospital.\u201dCao Jingshen felt that Yan Mu\u2019s behavior today is the same as usual. He really didn\u2019t see that he was sick. Seeing that Lu Chengyu was going to send him to the hospital. He helped the two of them to collect their things and said: \u201cHurry up. Anyway, there is not much to do this afternoon. If there is anything, I will call you.\u201dFeeling his arm being held by Lu Chengyu, Yan Mu looked at his arm and said nervously, \u201cI\u2019m fine, I can go home and take the anti-fever medicine to sleep.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more reassuring to go to the hospital to see it. Someone used to do this like you and ended up burning with pneumonia.\u201d In fact, this person was he himself in his previous life.Lu Chengyu raised his wrist and glanced at his watch, \u201cIt\u2019s already past five o\u2019clock, it\u2019s almost time to get off work, it won\u2019t affect work, let\u2019s go.\u201dYan Mu stopped talking when he saw this and went out with Lu Chengyu. He got out of the conference room and was dragged into the elevator again. Seeing that Lu Chengyu pressed the -1 which went straight to the parking lot without hesitation, he felt a little dizzy in his head, not knowing whether it was because of a cold or something else.After finding his car, Lu Chengyu stuffed him into the co-pilot seat before turning around and sitting in the car. While starting the car, he said, \u201cBoss, you can\u2019t care about your body like this.\u201dHe drove the car out of the parking lot, and after thinking about it, he decided to send Yan Mu to the hospital opened by Zhang Zeyun, \u201cYou don\u2019t think for yourself, but also for the so many employees of Huading. You are everyone\u2019s food and clothing parent.\u201dYan Mu listened quietly to the scolding, Chengyu was preaching, and when he waited for the traffic lights, he hesitated and said, \u201cAre you too?\u201dLu Chengyu was taken aback, seeing that the car in front had already started, and after he stepped on the accelerator to keep up, he said, \u201cWhat am I?\u201dYan Mu\u2019s gaze fell on the swaying safety symbol hung on the car, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dLu Chengyu hit the steering wheel, turned the car, and avoided a passing sports car, suddenly laughed and said: \u201cOf course I am very worried about you. Apart from being your employee, I am still your buddy.\u201dYan Mu looked away and said a low hmm.Lu Chengyu tilted his head and glanced at Yan Mu, seeing that he was looking straight ahead, and he didn\u2019t seem to have a fever at all. If he hadn\u2019t touched his hot forehead just now, he was afraid he wouldn\u2019t even know that this man was sick.Most of such people are firm and broad-minded, and they are destined to be successful people.Even if he died once, he couldn\u2019t be like Yan Mu, because he treated himself better and valued enjoyment privately. He didn\u2019t have such a high level of consciousness to let him work with a high temperature of 40 degrees.The car was moving at a constant speed in the constant flow of traffic. Lu Chengyu turned on the traffic radio and just heard the DJ playing the opening song of \u201cFlying Birds\u201d. It was sung by a few actors from their crew. It was not very good, but it was praised as an alternative promotion by this DJ.He heard the two sentences he sang, saying they were singing, rather than shouting, but after post-processing, they were not as scary as the recording scene, but he still felt a little embarrassed.\u201cLife is a drama. Who cares about sorrows and joys\u201d?\u201cToday you rejoice, and tomorrow you cry.\u201d\u201cMen and women are all acting, and who is in love with who?\u201dLu Chengyu gave a dry cough and wanted to change the channel. But was stopped by Yan Mu. He looked at Lu Chengyu and said, \u201cSinging was good, but the lyrics are not very good.\u201d\u201cHaha,\u201d Lu Chengyu laughed dryly, \u201cThe lyrics are all made up, who would take it seriously\u2026 \u2026\u201d You let your friends listen to the songs they sing in front of them, so that they can\u2019t feel comfortable at all. It\u2019s not about howling together in KTV.\u201cAlthough this song is not professionally sung, but the lyrics have a kind of self-ridicule about the status quo of the society. The flashy society, the restless people, the men and women who face ups and downs in love, finally walking on the road of separation and reunion, can\u2019t guess the ending, no one can guarantee that the end of the road is happiness,\u201d DJ\u2019s voice is gentle and magnetic, like a lover\u2019s whisper, which is especially clear in the quiet car, \u201cThe world is full of joys, sorrows and anger. Sadness and music are all related. No one can help you to replace them. Only you have to be strong. Waiting for time to take away all the bad things and usher in a new future. Thank you for listening to today\u2019s \u201cTiantian Tingting\u201d, I am yours Xiaotian, welcome to listen next time, our frequency is\u2026\u201dYan Mu moved his eyebrows as he watched Lu Chengyu\u2019s somewhat stiff expression.\u201cSuch a deep interpretation, even the writer of the song didn\u2019t think of it,\u201d he turned off the radio, and sighed. \u201cThe writers of other dramas have a harmonious husband and wife, and their sons and daughters are in harmony. Where did he come to this kind of insight, this is all bluffing? A young girl and a young boy listening to this song.\u201dYan Mu asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you believe these lyrics?\u201d\u201cWhy would I believe in this stuff?\u201d Lu Chengyu casually said, \u201cI live by myself. What is ruthless and what is not? If there is love, then where are the golden wedding, silver wedding and diamond wedding in this world? If others have true love, it does not mean that I will meet true love. If others are betrayed, it does not mean that I will be betrayed. If I have time to struggle with a song, it\u2019s better to go do something else.\u201dYan Mu stared at Lu Chengyu in a daze, as if he wanted to see exactly what this person looked like. Although he could not see through and understand, he found that his emotions were still easily influenced by this person.When the car drove to the hospital and stopped, Lu Chengyu reached out again to check the temperature of Yan Mu\u2019s forehead, and found that it seemed to be even hotter. He bent over to unfasten his seat belt for Yan Mu, \u201cGet off, I\u2019ll go and register for you.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgYan Mu, when he got out of the car, watched Lu Chengyu slam the door handsomely, his mouth raised, and he followed Lu Chengyu, watching him line up for himself to register, and then led him to the internal medicine department.When, they arrived in the internal medicine department, the person in front just saw Lu Chengyu, and the attending doctor looked up and recognized Lu Chengyu. After all, there was such a big trouble last week and people were still admitted in their hospital. How could they not know these doctors, \u201cMr. Lu, Why are you here, is your body uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s my friend.\u201d Lu Chengyu put Yan Mu on a stool and sat down. \u201cHe seems to have a fever. Please help him to check it.\u201dThe doctor looked at Yan Mu and recognized that this is the person who took care of Lu Chengyu last week. It seems that he is still a good friend with their elder master. He took out a thermometer to measure Yan Mu\u2019s fever and looked at his tongue and pupils. After listening to the lung sounds, he said, \u201cRecently There are many people who have caught colds for a while. Although young people are strong, you can\u2019t handle it carelessly.\u201dLu Chengyu sat with a smile, and after asking the doctor some more questions, it was time to take his temperature. The doctor took the thermometer and said, \u201cThis temperature is a bit high, it\u2019s already 40 degrees Celsius, I\u2019m afraid we need to start a drip.\u201d\u201cThen trouble the doctor, please make an order, I\u2019ll get the medicine.\u201d Lu Chengyu turned to Yan Mu, \u201cYou are not against it?\u201dYan Mu shook his head. After Lu Chengyu left with the medicine list prescribed by the doctor, the doctor said: \u201cMr. Lu is very concerned about your body.\u201dYan Mu nodded to the doctor: \u201cYes.\u201dThe doctor was about to say something, when Zhang Zeyun came in wearing a white robe, he stretched out his hand and patted Yan Mu\u2019s shoulder: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Brother Mu?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I have a small cold,\u201d Yan Mu said with a calm expression, \u201cThe doctor has prescribed good medicine for me.\u201dZhang Zeyun sighed after asking Dr. Ming what was going on. \u201cYou burned to forty degrees, why do you still look like an okay person?\u201d So, thinking about people like Mu Ge with a low facial expression, most people really can\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with him.The corners of Yan Mu\u2019s mouth moved: \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dZhang Zeyun helplessly took off the badge and put it in the pocket of his white coat, \u201cI will get you what medicine is prescribed.\u201d\u201cXiao Lu has already gone to bring it for me,\u201d The corner of Yan Mu\u2019s mouth bent slightly, \u201cHe\u2019ll be back in a while.\u201dI don\u2019t know if it was an illusion. Zhang Zeyun felt that Yan Mu\u2019s tone seemed to contain a certain emotion called ostentatiousness. He glanced at Yan Mu with suspicion. Mu Ge wouldn\u2019t be so boring; he must have heard it wrong. He gave a dry cough, \u201cI said it was really strange for you to come to the hospital with him last week, and he came to the hospital with you today. This is also very destined.\u201dThen, Zhang Zeyun saw Yan Mu praising him. The corner of his mouth, even though the curvature is small, he still saw it at a glance, and couldn\u2019t help sighing again at the moment. Like Mu Ge, in front of his crush, his IQ also plummeted.When Lu Chengyu came back, Zhang Zeyun had arranged a bed for Yan Mu, a separate ward, and the newly changed bed, it seemed that the treatment was pretty good.After Zhang Zeyun helped Yan Mu hang up the drip, he said to Lu Chengyu, who was sitting on the side asking for it: \u201cThe two bottles of medicine will hang for about two or three hours. Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m here with him, you can go back first.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, \u201cI won\u2019t go to work tomorrow. I won\u2019t have much fun when I go back anyway. I will wait until the boss finishes with the drip.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d Zhang Zeyun nodded, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go to another ward. He took out his name badge and put it on. Looking back, Yan Mu\u2019s eyes fell on Lu Chengyu, so he said, \u201cBrother Mu, then I\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cWell, thank you.\u201d Yan Mu thanked Zhang Zeyun.\u201cMy brother, don\u2019t be so polite to me,\u201d Zhang Zeyun smiled at the two of them before walking out of the ward. When he turned to close the door, his gaze swept across Lu Chengyu\u2019s hair and saw the soles of his feet again. When he retracted his gaze, he saw Yan Mu looking at him, he smiled at Yan Mu and closed the door.Lu Chengyu did have the charm that made Brother Mu like him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he retracted his gaze like nothing else. He got up and poured a glass of boiled water for Yan Mu: \u201cDrink some water. It will be much easier when you finish the drip.\u201d Although he didn\u2019t know. Zhang Zeyun just saw his intentions, but he could detect that the other party was not malicious.Yan Mu took the cup and took a sip of the tasteless plain water, \u201cI\u2019m fine, you go back and rest first, I heard that you seem to be going to the TV station tomorrow. It\u2019s not good to be late.\u201d Although there were so many words, his sight was looking at him very tightly.\u201cI made an appointment with the TV station at eleven o\u2019clock in the morning. What\u2019s there to worry about?\u201d Lu Chengyu pulled the quilt over him. \u201cIt\u2019s boring at home by myself. You are just spending time with me. You don\u2019t you think I\u2019m an eyesore?\u201dYan Mu\u2019s mouth moved, and he said hurriedly, \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid it will affect your rest.\u201d After a while, he asked, \u201cAre there many people who praise you for being considerate?\u201d\u201cThere should be few people, right? \u201cLu Chengyu thought about it carefully, and said seriously, \u201cI am actually very lazy. I can do it with a small amount of work. If someone asks me for help, I may not be willing.\u201dAren\u2019t you specifically here to take care of me?Yan Mu was holding the water cup, and his mood became a little better for some reason. He looked at the smiling person in front of him and suddenly said, \u201cSince you live alone, I live alone. It is better for you to move in with me and cook together. It\u2019s also easy.\u201dHe regretted it as soon as he spoke. Perhaps the other person\u2019s smile was too gentle, and he couldn\u2019t help but express his thoughts. However, such an idea could not be made known to the other party.The ward suddenly became quiet, Lu Chengyu saw Yan Mu frowning, and suddenly smiled: \u201cThat\u2019s not good, I\u2019m so lazy, if we live together, boss, you might really dislike me.\u201dYan Mu talked but he did not mention the matter again. It may be due to fever. He felt a little dizzy in his mind, and he didn\u2019t know when he fell asleep faintly.Lu Chengyu stood by the hospital bed and looked at Yan Mu who was sleeping. Because of the lack of the usual seriousness, this cool face looked softer. He sighed, looked at the drip that was being depleted too fast, so he adjusted the speed of the drip, lowered his head and took out his phone to continue reading the novel that he hadn\u2019t finished reading before.The plot had come to the climax, and the heroine had not appeared, but the hero\u2019s master almost lost his life for the hero. He looked at the words the master said to the hero, and he always felt that something was wrong.What does it mean that even if I die, I don\u2019t want you to have trouble?Is that what a master should say to his apprentice? He touched his chin, but the master\u2019s friendship with his apprentice was also very touching.After reading the novel for a while, Lu Chengyu awakened Yan Mu when he saw that the fluid was almost infused.He touched Yan Mu\u2019s forehead, and the temperature had already dropped, \u201cDoes it feel better now?\u201dYan Mu looked at the caring face in front of him: \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cThen. Okay, I\u2019ll ask the nurse to remove the needles for you.\u201d Lu Chengyu rang the bell and got a towel to wipe Yan Mu\u2019s sweat that had emerged as a result of the fever lowering. When the nurse came to remove the needles, she also said the same.After leaving the hospital, Lu Chengyu sent Yan Mu home. This time Yan Mu invited him to sit at home and he did not refuse.As soon as he entered the door of the villa, Lu Chengyu finally understood the true meaning of the word mansion. Not to mention anything else, the lamp hanging in the living room must cost at least more than 100,000 yuan. And the sofa, the coffee table, you only needed a glance to know that they belonged to expensive brands.Trying to maintain the elegant and calm expression on his face, Lu Chengyu cut an apple for Yan Mu and said, \u201cCan I borrow your kitchen?\u201d Although he didn\u2019t like cooking, he still had good cooking skills. This was all honed in the previous life. Yan Mu had been on drip for the whole night. He hadn\u2019t eaten yet. He couldn\u2019t let the patient go to bed hungry, right?Holding the peeled apple, Yan Mu walked to the kitchen door to watch Lu Chengyu\u2019s skillful washing and chopping of vegetables, then he saw him cooking porridge and a smile gradually appeared at the corner of his mouth.\u201cYou can eat it later,\u201d Lu Chengyu noticed that there was a figure at the door, turned his head and said, noticing the smile on Yan Mu\u2019s face, and the hand that turned the vegetables slightly, then turned his head and turned the pot a few times. \u201cI only fried a few side dishes. You are still recovering from a cold, so you can\u2019t eat too meaty food.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d after Yan Mu helped arrange the table, Lu Chengyu quickly brought out the food.After the two had eaten together, Lu Chengyu got up and left. Yan Mu didn\u2019t keep him because he knew he couldn\u2019t keep him.Watching Lu Chengyu get into the car, he stood at the gate, looking until the car lights were no longer visible.After leaving Mingchong Community, Lu Chengyu\u2019s expression became a little serious. He thought for a while, parked the car aside, took out his mobile phone to log on to YuYu\u2019s Weibo account, and posted a Weibo.\u201cYu Yu: The boss with facial paralysis standing behind me and smiling, he is actually quite handsome. However, why do I think this smile is not quite right?\u201dSister, I am the queen: PO master, that is the boss who is crushing on you. Ah, hurry up and accept him and get together.Guru Lu: Your Lady Queen is right; the boss is interested in you.Lu Chengyu swiped it, and there were a few more comments below, but looking at the comments that were together, he got a bit confused. When he died in the last life, he never heard which gender Yan Mu was fond of. He did not have interaction with women, let alone men. He doesn\u2019t have that great a charm yet.Could it be\u2026 Boss X is cold?Coming to the conclusion that he thought too much, Lu Chengyu threw the phone aside and started the car again. Recently, he still went to internet a little less, otherwise his mind would be crooked along with these girls.What a pure brotherhood between him and his boss, he even said he wanted them to live together.What would they do together, chasing sisters together?Sure enough, no matter what questions were asked on Weibo, he would always turn to the three words \u201ctogether\u201d in the end, and he almost didn\u2019t recognize these three words.He\u2019d better go home and have a good night\u2019s sleep and get to the TV station on time tomorrow.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cA Book of Life\u201d on the Imperial Variety TV Station is a program with very good ratings in the station. It was broadcast live every Saturday at 11 am, and then rebroadcast at 8 pm on Tuesday night. The host He Guo is a strong host with more than ten years of hosting experience. He has a good style and works hard. He has almost never had any scandals, so he is very popular with the audience. After so many years, he has also won the title of Brother He.The subject of this live broadcast had recently been considered well-known in China. He read the profile of this young man named Lu Chengyu a few days in advance and determined the topic of today\u2019s conversation. However, the other party\u2019s determination not to enter the entertainment circle still surprised him a bit.Now he didn\u2019t know how many young people have sharpened their heads and walked toward this circle. This Lu Chengyu actually went the other way. But after he inquired carefully, he felt that he was not so surprised again.After Lu Chengyu rushed to the TV station, he called Yan Mu and made sure that there was nothing wrong with the other party before rushing into the elevator with the reception staff to the dressing room.When the makeup artist saw Lu Chengyu, he showed a polite smile. After the two parties introduced each other, the makeup artist said: \u201cMr. Lu\u2019s clothes are very decent, but I may need to do your makeup and hair for you.\u201d\u201cThank you. I chose a set of clothes specially today. Fortunately, it caught the eyes of the master. At least, I was not ashamed.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, \u201cThen please help the master to put on makeup for me. I can choose this outfit. The makeup is really difficult. I don\u2019t know anything.\u201dThe makeup artist laughed: \u201cI don\u2019t dare to be a master of Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu\u2019s appearance is very good, so it doesn\u2019t take much time to put on makeup.\u201dMany entertainers in the entertainment industry look glamorous on the surface. But due to long-term makeup use, many people had poor skin. So, every time makeup was done, makeup artists were also very embarrassed. If the foundation is thin, they were afraid that it won\u2019t cover up the acne or acne marks, but it looked unnatural under the light when it is thick. A good foundation like Lu Chengyu is what makeup artists liked to encounter.The hair and makeup were quickly fixed. After Lu Chengyu thanked the makeup artist, he followed the assistant director to the studio. After entering, he saw that the host had arrived, but the audience had not been put in yet.He Guo was in position, and he naturally had a good hand in inquiring about the news. He knew that Lu Chengyu had a close relationship with Mu\u2019s grandson, and he had a good relationship with several officials in Beijing. This time Lu Chengyu\u2019s affair with the prince of the Liang family was such a big deal. Lu Chengyu had nothing to do with it. Instead, the Liang family was so messed up that he couldn\u2019t get up. He would not believe it if it was said that there was no other person\u2019s work afterwards.Therefore, when Lu Chengyu appeared, he stood up with a smile, shook hands with Lu Chengyu, they introduced each other, and began to talk about the entire program flow.Because it was a talk show, only a general direction had been determined. After the show started, it still depends on the self-exertion ability of the host and guests.Lu Chengyu could perceive the kindness that He Guo had radiated towards him. He was naturally very polite. The conversation between the two parties was very pleasant. After the recording and broadcasting was about to officially begin, Lu Chengyu got up and went back to the backstage. After the show started, he still needed to be in the audience and come out with the applause.At 10:50, all the on-site audiences entered the venue, the lighting engineer, sound engineer and other staff were all in place. The director started counting down. As soon as the show began, He Guo began to talk about the opening remarks, and then the guest Lu Chengyu was brought out.After a round of applause, Lu Chengyu walked out with grace, greeted the audience first, and then greeted He Guo. After he sat down, the conversation officially started. There was no problem in the whole process.\u201cFirst of all, please allow me to introduce the handsome young man in front of me. All must have known him at the scene and in front of the TV. He is the grass-level scholar of Q University who was very popular on Weibo some time ago. He has a high rate of contribution in the movie \u201cFlying Birds\u201d. Everyone applaud again to welcome him.\u201dLu Chengyu got up and bowed to the applauding audience. After saying thank you a few times, he sat down again. The audience was very grateful.He Guo looked at the boy\u2019s performance on stage, and suddenly thought he was like an old artist who had been in the entertainment industry for many years, but the other party was obviously only a young man in his early twenties.It\u2019s no wonder that people who can be so close to those second generations in Beijing, would know how to get along with others best.In Yan Mu\u2019s villa, Zhang Zeyun and Zhuang Yu sat on the sofa, watching annoying advertisements on the big TV screen. Zhuang Yu couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cBrother Mu, it\u2019s almost eleven o\u2019clock. What\u2019s so good about this ad?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s started,\u201d Yan Mu pointed to the TV with a serious expression, where the head of \u201cA Book of Life\u201d was placed. \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble.\u201dZhuang Yu turned his head and looked at the screen, just in time to see Lu Chengyu coming out from the backstage, wearing a small snow-white suit, really suited to a little girl\u2019s taste of Prince Charming in the eyes of the little girl, and he smiled as well. Very inviting.He looked at Yan Mu and then at the TV screen. It turned out that they were sitting here and waiting for a long time because of this sensational show that would be re-broadcast?!Brother Mu, you are already depraved and hopeless, do you know?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many friends on the Internet like you very much and even call you a male god. About everyone\u2019s high evaluation of you, what do you think about it?\u201d He Guo started with Lu Chengyu\u2019s academic qualifications, but it was easy to arouse the favour of mother-level audiences. After all, who doesn\u2019t like boys with good grades, looks, good behaviour?\u201cI thought that many friends would grit their teeth with hatred,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, \u201cBecause sometimes I will urge them to do homework or go to work well on the Internet. Usually, many people call me a god-student in the comments. It is all heresy.\u201dHe Guo followed with a smile: \u201cBut everyone still likes you very much. It is said that you have achieved excellent results since childhood. I don\u2019t know if there is any learning method that you would like to share. I believe that there are still many friends in front of the TV who are interested.\u201cEveryone is not interested in learning methods, but they have no choice but to learn. As for how to get better academic performance, the most important thing is to be serious in class, usually read more and write more, there are not so many shortcuts to learning,\u201d Lu Chengyu stood on the table. He took a sip of the cup and smiled at the camera, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for being forced to read and write in the future. Brother He asked me to say this.\u201d He Guo laughed in cooperation and confessed his sins to the camera.He put down the cup and replied: \u201cBut I think that academic performance does not represent everything. Even our ancestor\u2019s thousands of years ago knew that a sentence is called three hundred and sixty lines. You cannot use performance to define who is bright and who is mediocre.\u201d\u201cMr. Lu\u2019s words are very reasonable, personal ability is more important than performance,\u201d He Guo chatted with Lu Chengyu for a while about education, and then brought the topic to the point. \u201cFlying Birds\u201d, after all, this movie has become a big hit recently, and it can also increase the topic of the show.\u201cYou are an employee of Huading International, how did you end up in this movie?\u201d He Guo turned his head and looked at the big screen, which began to show the footage of Lu Chengyu getting off the car in the movie. The handsome appearance aroused the youth of the scene. The audience applauded.\u201cI happened to meet Zhang Shuo and the screenwriter at a casserole specialty restaurant. At that time, they couldn\u2019t raise funds, and they happened to be next to me saying they were going to disband. I couldn\u2019t help but persuade them with a few words. Later, when the film funding was in place, they couldn\u2019t find a suitable actor to play this role. On the day they went to visit the class, I was arrested.\u201d He tilted his head and looked at the big screen, just in time to see the scene where he wiped his hand and threw the handkerchief. He touched his nose a little awkwardly, obviously not comfortable with watching his performance.\u201cYou played this role very well,\u201d He Guo said, \u201cMany movie fans say that you made this person alive, and even the male lead Gao Boyang said that he was brought into emotions by your role.\u201d\u201cNothing so exaggerated,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled politely, no pride was visible on his face, he retracted his gaze on the screen, touched his chin, and said in a joking tone, \u201cIt\u2019s probably my face that can play cheap roles easily.\u201d He Guo was amused by these words and nodded: \u201cYes, everyone likes your acting skills and thinks you are handsome, so that\u2019s why you have been given the title of a male god.\u201d The audience was suddenly amused. Lu Chengyu smiled politely holding his cup of water.At this time, someone has posted a post on the Haijiao forum, saying that the guest of this issue of \u201cA Book of Life\u201d is the male god Lu Chengyu, which aroused a lot of interest.The enthusiasm of Prince Liang\u2019s bullying had not gone down. \u201cFlying Birds\u201d was also being screened. Lu Chengyu was currently very popular. It is a pity that he does not participate in any TV shows. Even the \u201cFlying Birds\u201d crew recently participated in various variety shows But there was no Lu Chengyu in those shows either.Now, he finally appeared in a live talk show like \u201cA Book of Life\u201d, and of course everyone became interested in this show.After finding the webcast address, many people went to watch, and soon there were many people leaving comments below the post.15L: My blood tank is almost empty. How can a male god smile so beautifully? How can a male god be more attractive than in a movie!!20L: In a show like \u201cA Book of Life\u201d, he can still be so handsome. I\u2019m sure my male god is handsome.22L: The look of the male god holding a water glass is really beautiful.24L: You idiots, even if Lu Chengyu falls in front of you, you will still feel that he is good-looking.27L: On the 24th floor, people like you don\u2019t appreciate the beauty in male gods.31L: Male gods also have to eat and drink and use the toilet. Where is the beauty inside? Maybe this male god is still a man with a stubborn look inside, let us see if you will call him a male god after seeing him like that.32L: Upstairs you won\u2019t understand. The main reason why a male god is called a male god is that he is handsome. Even if my male god is a man who is stubborn, he is also a handsome man who is stubborn. Do you understand? \u256e ( \u256f _ \u2570 ) \u256dThere was a lot of excitement on the Internet. Yan Mu sat in front of the TV without blinking his eyes, and even forgot the two people sitting next to him. Zhuang Yu picked out a banana from the fruit plate on the coffee table. After peeling the skin, he ate it. Watching Lu Chengyu on TV smiling and behaving elegantly, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh: \u201cXiao Lu is on a show for the first time. But the performance is really good.\u201dZhang Zeyun glanced at him, then at Yan Mu, and said with a faint smile: \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have this ability, why would Brother Mu let him be an assistant?\u201dZhuang Yu wanted to say that it was because of Yan Mu. Brother fell in love with this person, but before he could say anything, he remembered Lu Chengyu\u2019s usual deeds. Not to mention anything else, he said that the movie was very profitable, but Lu Chengyu was able to shoot it without his support. The Liang family that confronted Lu Chengyu did not end well in the end.Lu Chengyu was not a simple ordinary person. After thinking for a while, he said: \u201cYes, if he is not capable enough, Brother Mu\u2026 how can our brother appreciate him.\u201dAlthough they are the so-called second generation from official families. The rich second generations, are not fools, so they have their own rules for what kind of friends they make and what kind of people they are close to. Lu Chengyu became acquainted with their brothers in a short period. This is one of his skills.It could not be because of his looks, even if someone came better-looking than Lu Chengyu came to them, they would not take it seriously.This is probably the so-called personal charm. He threw the banana peel on the coffee table at random, remembering that Mu Ge didn\u2019t like people to throw things around, so he hurriedly collected the peel and threw them into the trash can. As a result, when he watched Yan Mu secretly, the other party didn\u2019t notice his movements at all but instead focused all of his attention on the TV.\u201cDid the things that happened some time ago have an impact on your life? Others knowing about your family\u2019s affairs, or\u2026 because of other people\u2019s malicious things, do you feel troubled?\u201d He Guo had been hesitant to raise this topic. But after thinking about the effects of the show, in the second half of the show, he finally decided to bring it up.As soon as this question came up, not only others were interested, but even Zhuang Yu couldn\u2019t help but straighten his ears. He wanted to hear what Lu Chengyu thought.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLu Chengyu in front of the camera guessed that He Guo might bring up the matter, so he was not surprised when he heard the question raised by He Guo. The smile on his face faded a bit, and then he reached out for the glass of water in order to conceal his emotions and then he said, \u201cThe influence may be there, but people around me will not have any special opinions on me because of this. But there is one more troublesome thing. Just these days, whether it is a colleague or an uncle security guard in the community, they like to stuff me with something. The walnuts in my house can be piled up into a hill. I am worried that I will not be able to eat it and waste everyone\u2019s good intentions.\u201d\u201cIt seems the people around you love you so much, that\u2019s why they care about your body.\u201d He Guo knew Lu Chengyu had no intention of mentioning his parents\u2019 affairs to show how lonely and helpless he was. On the contrary, he increasingly felt that this young man was someone who was destined to do great things. Because people who do big things never like to say how miserable they are, but love to work hard for themselves. Those who like to tell people how miserable they are anytime, anywhere, are just there to kill others\u2019 sympathy.\u201cBecause there are so many good people in this world,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s why so many people care about me.\u201d He Guo agreed: \u201cBe kind to others, and others will treat you kindly. Mr. Lu said there are so many good people around him. Then in the eyes of these people, you are also a good person.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled, without accepting or opposing, but said: \u201cAfter all, there are only very few bad people in the world.\u201dThe court channel has always liked to report on the positive and bright side, so Lu Chengyu\u2019s words made the program director very satisfied, and he also gave Lu Chengyu some nice close-ups.\u201cHave you seen this picture?\u201d He Guo pointed to the big screen. Inside, Lu Chengyu was standing in front of the police station with blood still on his shirt. Yan Mu held him with one hand, but his brows were frowned, making him look better than ever.They were followed by Zhang Shuo, Qu Lingbei, lawyers, and police. The scene looked a little chaotic, but there was an indescribable sense of solemnity.Lu Chengyu slowly shook his head: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this picture.\u201dHe Guo smiled and said, \u201cSome netizens praised your boss as a good boss who moved the country. This is because you don\u2019t want to be an actor but insist on doing it now. Is this one of the reasons for this job?\u201dIn front of the TV screen, Zhuang Yu and Zhang Zeyun looked at Yan Mu together. Yan Mu took a calm look at the two of them, and reached for the teacup on the table, only to touch them twice.\u201cMy boss is a very good person. I don\u2019t wish to become an entertainer because my major in college was economic management rather than acting. Performance is not my biggest hobby. But having such a good boss makes me willing to work hard even more.,\u201d Lu Chengyu thought for a while, \u201cFor me, he is both a boss and a friend. This is the greatest luck in my working life.\u201d\u201cHey !\u201d Zhuang Yu and Zhang Zeyun looked back again and saw the original cinnabar teacup held by Yan Mu Duan fell to the ground, and the tea splashed all over the floor.\u201cHands slipped,\u201d Yan Mu blankly took two tissues and wiped the back of his hands, then continued to stare at the TV.Zhang Zeyun: \u201c\u2026\u201dZhuang Yu: \u201cBrother Mu, your socks are wet.\u201d\u201cWell, it feels cool.\u201d Yan Mu nodded, still not looking away from the screen.Zhuang Yu opened his mouth and suddenly became speechless. It is only ten degrees Celsius today. Do you need to pour herbal tea on the back of your feet to cool it down?\u201cIn this way, you are the Maxima and he the Bole[1],\u201d He Guo smiled, \u201cYou have the ability, he has the foresight, and you complement each other.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t dare to think that I am a Maxima, but I believe I should be considered a hardworking horse,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled at the camera, \u201cEven if you are not a Maxima, as long as you are diligent, you can still be a Maxima.\u201dAfter the interview, Lu Chengyu and He Guo had a friendly farewell, and the two took a photo together as a souvenir.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 39.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39.2When he got out of the TV station building, Lu Chengyu saw several assistants approaching a beautiful woman. He had a meal before taking a few steps to the side.When the beautiful woman passed by him, her pace slowed down, she turned her head to look at him more, smiled at him, and talked to the staff who came to the reception.Lu Chengyu couldn\u2019t help but glance at this woman more. He felt that the actress was a bit familiar. After getting in the car, he remembered who this female artist was.Isn\u2019t this Liu Qiyan, who will be very popular in the world in the future? Now also the reputation is not small. The TV series she filmed last year was the champion of ratings throughout the year. Many TV stations have broadcasted it. But even so, the ratings are still very high at the same time every time it is broadcasted.This woman can be regarded as capable and outstanding. When he was an assistant agent, he knew that the young artists in the circle were envious and jealous of Liu Qiyan, but he had nothing to do with her. Some people even asked cyber gunners to smear her reputation in major forums, saying how she got the upper hand by rolling the sheets, and how she was inconsistent.But despite this slander, even after a long time, not many people believed it. On the contrary, many people called Liu Qiyan the Yan Ye, saying that she looks good and has a queen style. Even if she wasn\u2019t this kind of people, it will be difficult for her.And this Yan Ye was the only person who had a scandal with Yan Mu in his previous life. Although this scandal had no picture and no truth, many people did not believe it, but this woman is the only one who has had a scandal with the president of Huading International.From a man\u2019s point of view, a woman like Liu Qiyan is indeed a stunner, but from a buddy\u2019s point of view, Yan Mu and Liu Qiyan are not in line with each other and are inappropriate.Realizing that his thoughts were running a little far away, Lu Chengyu wiped his face. He didn\u2019t have a partner, so he became worried for Yan Mu first.It\u2019s not that people have no object to worry about, but they don\u2019t know which object to choose.As soon as he walked out of his imaginary world, he found that his cell phone was ringing, and the caller was Yan Mu.He plugged in the earphones, while he drobe the car out of the TV station\u2019s parking lot and answered the phone: \u201cBoss.\u201d\u201cThe show is over?\u201d Yan Mu looked at the steaming soup in the pot, \u201cIf it\u2019s over, come here for lunch. In the morning, Zhuang Yu brought two soft-shelled turtles. I used them to make the soup. It\u2019s almost ready now. Come and taste it.\u201dZhuang Yu, who was gnawing apples in the living room, looked at the time. It\u2019s already twelve, when will Brother Mu have lunch?!Lu Chengyu originally wanted to find a restaurant on the side of the road to just eat something to fill his stomach, but when he heard Yan Mu\u2019s words, he remembered Yan Mu\u2019s cooking skills and immediately agreed. When passing by a well-known cold dish restaurant in Beijing, he still bought some cold dishes.When Lu Chengyu arrived at the door of Yan Mu\u2019s house, it was already half past one and a half. After he rang the doorbell and saw Zhang Zeyun opening the door, he smiled and said, \u201cI let everyone wait a long time, sorry.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t wait long,\u201d \u201cZhang Zeyun turned sideways to let him in, \u201cBesides, you have a job and there is nothing you can do.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we were not hungry,\u201d Zhuang Yu put down the half-eaten apple in his hand and wiped his mouth. Xiao Lu, you were so handsome on TV today.\u201d\u201cBrother Zhuang watched the show?\u201d Lu Chengyu\u2019s eyes changed slightly, then he smiled and bent over to change slippers, brought cold dishes to the kitchen, and saw that Yan Mu was stirring the top layer of turtle soup. You said, \u201cBoss, I bought a few cold dishes. Have you cooked? If you haven\u2019t, you can make fewer dishes.\u201dYan Mu had heard the conversation between Lu Chengyu and Zhuang Yu just now in the living room. Thinking of calling Lu Chengyu after the show and pretending to not know that the show was over, the expression on his face was a little stiff, and the oily soup dripped on the back of his hand, but it didn\u2019t hurt.\u201cBoss, aren\u2019t you afraid of being burnt?\u201d Lu Chengyu saw the soup dripping on the back of Yan Mu\u2019s hand. He reached out and took the spoon and bowl in his hand and put it aside, \u201cRinse with cold water.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Yan Mu was calm. He wiped the back of his hand with his other hand, turned around, and peeled the potatoes. After peeling one potato, he said, \u201cI watched your show in the morning for a while. It was good.\u201dLu Chengyu took a few plates and plated the cold dishes he bought. After loading the plates, hearing Yan Mu\u2019s words, he looked back at Yan Mu, who was looking down and trying hard to ccut vegetables, he said, \u201cDid the boss see the section where I praised you?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Yan Mu was careless, while he tried to cut the potatoes in half at once.Lu Chengyu smiled upon seeing this.Zhang Zeyun, who had already walked to the door of the kitchen and was ready to help, stopped and looked at the atmosphere between the two in the house, shook his head helplessly, turned, and went back to the living room to sit down.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you went to the kitchen to help?\u201d Zhuang Yu gave him a puzzled look.\u201cI want to help, but I don\u2019t want to be a lightbulb. With Xiao Lu there, I\u2019m not going to join in the fun.\u201d Zhang Zeyun raised his eyebrows too much and turned the TV station to the news channel.After hearing this, Zhuang Yu glanced towards the kitchen, shrugged, and stopped asking. Anyway, Brother Mu has taken care of Lu Chengyu now, and Lu Chengyu is also a good person. If they are willing to get together with each other, it is also their fate.Suddenly, his brows frowned: \u201cZeyun, do you think that Elder Mu will agree to it?\u201d While young people accept this kind of thing, they are still a little surprised, let alone people of Elder Mu\u2019s age.\u201cElder Mu has three sons but only one daughter. This daughter died when she was thirty years old. He has three grandchildren: two granddaughters, but only one grandson, Mu Ge, would you be reconciled if you were him?\u201d Zhang Zeyun frowned. Then his brow wrinkled, \u201cBut now it\u2019s not whether the old man can agree, but whether Mu Ge can chase people successfully.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Zhuang Yu sighed. \u201cXiao Lu has a house, a car, and savings. He looks good and has a high degree of education, and he is good at doing things. This type of man shouldn\u2019t be less popular. There are a bunch of people who call him male god on the Internet. Now, Brother Mu doesn\u2019t have the means to pursue people. I think it\u2019s mysterious.\u201d\u201cThings have not reached the last step, and no one knows the result,\u201d Zhang Zeyun played with the remote control in his hand, \u201cSometimes any means or language is no better than the word 'sincere\u201d. The more popular people are, the more they value these two words.\u201dZhuang Yu glanced at Zhang Zeyun and said nothing, but he was still a little worried. If others can\u2019t see, touch, or even not know, isn\u2019t it a waste of sincerity?The food was quickly served. Zhuang Yu took a look at it. Turtle soup, green pepper and potato shreds, oyster mushroom meat slices, small green vegetables, homemade tofu, and a few cold dishes, although they are all very common dishes, they had the taste of living at home. Can\u2019t help but feel that Mu Ge and Xiao Lu have such a natural taste.\u201cMu Ge and Xiao Lu work together to cook together. The speed is really fast.\u201d Zhuang Yu went to the kitchen and washed his hands, sat down at the table, reached out and grabbed a piece of the dish, and was full of praise.The four of them sat around the table. Lu Chengyu ate two bowls of rice, drank two bowls of soup, and ate a lot of vegetables. Zhuang Yu was dumbfounded. How long was he hungry?After Zhuang Yu waited for Lu Chengyu to put down his chopsticks, he said with emotion: \u201cXiao Lu has a good appetite.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cThey said that after eating in the morning, I will not look good when I\u2019m on the camera, so I only eat now.\u201d Lu Chengyu yawned and rubbed his neck, \u201cI won\u2019t participate in any shows anymore.\u201d\u201cMany people in the circle may not be able to be on this show. You still dislike it.\u201d As Zhuang Yu said, he saw Yan Mu get up and go upstairs.\u201cIt\u2019s not disgusting, it\u2019s just making people nervous,\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me acting very relaxed I was afraid of saying the wrong thing from start to finish, and I was so nervous that I drank several sips of water.\u201dZhuang Yu stretched out his hand. He patted him on the shoulder: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cZhuang Yu iss right. You acted very well, and you look much more natural than those stars,\u201d Yan Mu walked downstairs and handed a piece of digestion tablet to Lu Chengyu, \u201cHungry for so long, and eat so much. It\u2019s not good for the stomach.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and threw the digestion tablets into his mouth, and chewed them into his stomach, \u201cBoss, if you say yes, then there must be no problem.\u201dZhuang Yu was touched. Touching his nose, he decided to clean up the dishes on the table, he would rather wash the dishes than see the innocent appearance of Mu Ge in front of his crush.It was a test of his ability to control facial expressions.Seeing this, Zhang Zeyun also stood up silently and followed to clean up. Although he hated washing dishes, doing things like being a light bulb is very unpleasant.\u201cAre the TV stations easy to get along with?\u201d Yan Mu heard that the TV station had bullied newcomers or ordinary people, and somehow he thought of Lu Chengyu.\u201cNo, we were good,\u201d Lu Chengyu lost his smile, \u201cthis circle will mostly not do things that will easily offend people, not to mention they know that its Boss Mu who is behind me.\u201dThese words although it was a joke, Lu Chengyu knew in his heart that there must be a serious reason for the people on the TV station to be so enthusiastic about him. Otherwise, no matter how miserable and pitiful he was, people like He Guo would not be so kind to him. You know, many big names in the circle are in front of He Guo, and they must respect him as Brother He.Yan Mu\u2019s complexion changed slightly, and he immediately said: \u201cIt\u2019s because you have done a good job that they will be polite to you. How could it be my cause.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with having a boss who can cover me,\u201d Lu Chengyu said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m like a fake tiger, what a good thing.\u201dYan Mu saw that he didn\u2019t mind this kind of thing, he was relieved, and coughed dryly, \u201cYou\u2019re not a fake tiger, you are very good.\u201dLu Chengyu laughed again. He didn\u2019t know why he feels that he is less and less scrupulous in front of Yan Mu, is it because the other party has fewer words and expressions, which makes him feel very reliable?!On the Haijiao forum at this time, Lu Chengyu\u2019s pictures in \u201cA Book of Life\u201d have been screenshotted by people who like him and put them in the post. Many people praised that male god is so handsome and has no bad sides. The remnant of the brain powder tried to criticize him.It can be seen that Lu Chengyu\u2019s popularity on the Internet is high.Song Junyan brushed the web page, watching someone in the forum joking about Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu, he raised his mouth. I heard that his good brother is rigorous. If he knows that someone is joking about him with a man, would he be disgusted with this man?Lu Chengyu is Yan Mu\u2019s assistant. If there is a conflict between the two, it will be lively.Didn\u2019t Yan Mu favour the talented Lu Chengyu? Didn\u2019t he tell the police to protect the interests of his employees?He was about to see. Someone joked about them on the Internet. He wouldn\u2019t mind at all. As for Lu Chengyu\u2019s side\u2026Song Junyan\u2019s smile became more and more gentle, so he picked up the phone and notified the previously contacted water army to start spreading some remarks on the Internet.For example, are Huading CEOs and Lu Chengyu true love?When Lu Chengyu went home in the evening, he just ran into Song Junyan who had come back from a run. Just when he thought that the other party was still just saying hello to him, this one finally started to change the way of communication.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 40.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40.1Song Junyan looked closely at Lu Chengyu in front of him. It seemed that he was only in his early twenties, but he pitted Liang Deyou to death. Even Liang Guoming was affected. The whole Liang family was torn apart, by the wind and rain brought down by him. Had it not been for this turmoil, he would not have been able to join Liang\u2019s board of directors and become one of the major shareholders.Counting this way, he is grateful to Lu Chengyu, at least without him, his plan could not be implemented so quickly.\u201cI saw you on TV today,\u201d Song Junyan scratched his head with a smile on his face, \u201cYou said those words in the show well. I would have been nervous.\u201d\u201cI was also very nervous. \u201cLu Chengyu look lingering on his face, \u201cI just looked calm on the surface.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Song Junyan noticed that Lu Chengyu was still wearing the white suit he wore on TV. He guessed that although Lu Chengyu seemed indifferent on the surface, but there was an intention to show off in his heart, and he said, \u201cYou look so good in this outfit. Many people on the Internet are saying you are handsome.\u201d\u201cHaha, I picked this one yesterday,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled happily, \u201cEven the makeup artist \u00a0said that my outfit was good.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Song Junyan realized that the topic seemed to be far from what he had expected, so he made the bright smile on his face a bit unnatural, \u201cThen what, I saw you on the show\u2026 you took a picture with your boss. How about your boss\u2026?\u201dLu Chengyu said with no change on his face when he heard the words: \u201cHe is pretty good, but he is more rigorous at work, and I don\u2019t dare to make comparison.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Song Junyan grinned reluctantly, \u201cHow is he doing now?\u201d\u201cVery good,\u201d Lu Chengyu seemed to not see the worry in his expression and walked upstairs with a smile, \u201cBoss is the one with a villa and a car, how can he have a bad life?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Song Junyan and Lu Chengyu entered the elevator together, and their smiles became dazed, \u201cHe has a good life\u2026just fine.\u201dDo you think that I have my boss\u2019s secret in my heart? Come and ask, and I will come back to tell you obediently?Haha, Lao Tzu is not so blind.\u201cThat is, the boss not only has a car, a house, and a deposit, but he can also cook,\u201d Lu Chengyu said with envious emotion, \u201cThis is a model of a successful man. I only look up to ordinary humans.\u201dSong Junyan felt his expression darken. But he was trying to take advantage of him, so he laughed and said, \u201cYes, people like him are too far away from us.\u201d\u201cDing\u201d, the elevator door opened, Lu Chengyu walked out of the elevator, smiled, and said goodbye to Song Junyan. Under the complicated smile of the other party, he turned and walked towards his house.As the elevator doors were closed, the smile on Song Junyan\u2019s face suddenly became cold, and he kicked the elevator wall with anger: \u201cPig brain!\u201dIn the security room, Uncle Liu and his colleague Xiao Yang looked at the footage of the surveillance video. The two exchanged glances, and Xiao Yang was a little worried: \u201cMr. Song has something wrong with his mind?\u201d He\u00a0usually behaves in a sunny and upright manner, and he is also very normal when talking with Mr. Lu. But when Mr. Lu leaves, and he is alone, why is he so scary?\u201cHe may not know that we installed surveillance in the elevator today, and accidentally showed his true nature,\u201d Uncle Liu snorted calmly. \u201cFor such a young person, there should be no problem in his mind, otherwise it would be a pity. \u201cXiao Yang nodded, and then said again: \u201cLet\u2019s remind Mr. Lu, if this Mr. Song suddenly becomes abnormal someday, what should we do if he attacks him? It\u2019s not worthwhile.\u201d Mr. Lu was like that. He shouldn\u2019t be hurt by this weird Mr. Song.Uncle Liu nodded, and this matter should be mentioned to Mr. Lu again. This matter was already a little weird. Before Mr. Song had moved in, he liked to inquire about Mr. Lu, and now he is even closer to Mr. Lu. It would be strange if there were no conspiracies.So, when Lu Chengyu went out the next day, he was held by Uncle Liu with a mysterious face, and he was told Song Junyan\u2019s behaviour in the elevator.After listening to the words of uncle Liu, Lu Chengyu\u2019s expression changed, then he felt indebted to Uncle Liu said: \u201cUncle, thank you for telling me. I did not know he could be so terrible; I\u2019ll certainly pay more attention.\u201d\u201cI\u00a0know just pay attention. I saw this guy dangling downstairs all day long, and when I saw you, he leaned forward. I knew there was a problem with his mind.\u201d Uncle Liu patted Lu Chengyu on the shoulder and then asked him to drive. After being careful, he smiled and watched Lu Chengyu\u2019s car leave.Lu Chengyu came out this time to make an appointment with Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei. After the three met, they found a box in the teahouse to sit down and began to talk about the shooting of the new script.Lu Chengyu listened to Qu Lingbei\u2019s complete summary of the story and was very interested. Although there was no such movie in the memory of his last life, he feels that if this movie is made, it should have a good reputation.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThe theme of this movie was not new, but the plot is attractive, the scene structure was not big, and the investment was not too much. The only problem was that this movie is a bit fresh, and it\u2019s affirmative to be well-liked, but not necessarily popular.Probably this is also the reason why this movie did not exist in the previous life because investors were afraid that the money will be thrown into the water. After all, a well-received movie is helpful to enhance the reputation of screenwriters and directors, but for investors, it is nothing good if it did not make money.Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei also felt embarrassed to let Lu Chengyu invest in this script. Although they both liked this theme very much, they still prepared a more commercial script for Lu Chengyu. If Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t like the small and fresh script, they would themselves consider investing in this business-oriented script.\u201cThese two scripts are good,\u201d Lu Chengyu listened to the two stories. The former explored human nature from the perspective of a child, while the latter viewed society from the perspective of a humorous adult. Each has its advantages. \u201cIt\u2019s not as good as two. I want to invest in both the scripts, but you two will be very tired, I don\u2019t know you\u2026\u201d\u201cNo problem,\u201d Zhang Shuo said with joy suddenly, \u201cChengyu, don\u2019t worry, I will make these two films!\u201d He looked back at his friend, who also looked happy they didn\u2019t expect Lu Chengyu to talk so easily.Although they have made a popular movie, there was no shortage of dazzling but fleeting meteors in this circle. It was really hard to see a straightforward investor like Lu Chengyu.Lu Chengyu naturally saw the joy of the two. For him, even if the small fresh script does not make money, it was an emotional investment. At least in the hearts of Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei, he valued the two, and he was not the type who crossed the river and demolished the bridge[1].What\u2019s more, the commercial script introduced by Qu Lingbei at the back of the film could produce a very good box office. Even if Xiaoqing\u2019s box office income is zero, he will not lose money.The two parties discussed the budget, and Lu Chengyu immediately signed the contract with the two of them, and the three of them got together for lunch. Although it was not a high-end hotel, the three of them were happy and relished the food.Perhaps, the three were so compatible, and another reason was that the taste was also very compatible.When Lu Chengyu returned home, he bought some fruit on the road for Uncle Liu and other security guards before returning to his home. Looking at the messy house, he felt that he should call the cleaning company to get someone to clean up the house.As soon as he looked at the time, it was less than two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and he was about to lie down on the bed for a while, when he received a call from Zhuang Yu, saying that a few people were going to have a picnic by the river in the afternoon and asked him to join in.As the second-generation official and the second-generation rich kids, these people did not go to play other things, and they like to go to farmhouses or riversides, which was amazing. You must know that some of the rich second generations he had contact with in his previous life for work were most likely to get together to play around with some messy things in various clubs. Self-discipline like Yan Mu and his companions had never been seen by him.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll come over right away.\u201d After Lu Chengyu asked about the location, he hung up the phone and picked up the car key to go out. When he went downstairs, he met Song Junyan who was coming back from the outside. He greeted the other party and waited for the other party to speak.\u201cMr. Lu is going out?\u201d Seeing Lu Chengyu dressed casually, Song Junyan smiled when he guessed that he was going out to play, \u201cAre you going out with colleagues in the company?\u201d\u201cNo, some friends of the boss asked me to go out to play,\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at his watch and smiled apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m are in a hurry, so I\u2019m\u00a0leaving first.\u201d Song Junyan smiled and watched Lu Chengyu leave.Seeing Lu Chengyu\u2019s back, the smile on his face gradually cooled. \u201cHe\u2019s just a snob who climbed up through Yan Mu, and Yan Mu\u2019s vision is nothing\u00a0more than that.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was also a mess of snacks on the table.Seeing him coming, Zhuang Yu was about to greet him, but seeing Yan Mu who was beside him had already gotten up and walked towards Lu Chengyu, he had to touch his nose and continue to peel the figs on the table to eat.\u201cBoss, you\u2019re here too,\u201d Lu Chengyu glanced around with a smile. There were people everywhere in the antique-style buildings. He couldn\u2019t help but said, \u201cPicnic here?\u201d Uncle Security will not beat them with a broom, right?\u201cThey said that the picnic at night was boring, and they were going to wait for the boat to eat fish,\u201d Yan Mu pointed to a large boat not far away. \u201cI heard that the fish on this boat tastes very good. We will try it together later.\u201d\u201cOk\u201d, Lu Chengyu nodded and walked around Yan Mu. Seeing his look, he did not seem to be serious, \u201cThe scenery here is really good.\u201d \u201cAh, \u201cYan Mu pointed at a barbeque stall not far away, \u201cIt was run by a friend of Zhuang Yu\u2019s bodyguard. Zhuang Yu said it tasted good. Would you like to try it?\u201d\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t eat it?\u201d Lu Chengyu smelled the barbecue in the air. He couldn\u2019t help walking towards the barbecue stall that seemed to have a good business. When he approached, he saw that Zhuang Yu\u2019s bodyguard was talking to the stall owner, and he said, \u201cA Dong, this is your friend?\u201dA Dong looked up. He saw that it was a friend of the boss, and he hurriedly smiled and said, \u201cMr. Yan, Mr. Lu, are you here to buy skewers?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll try it.\u201d After Lu Chengyu chose some of his favourite skewers, he found that the stall owner\u2019s hands seemed a little stiff, thinking that there was something wrong with the other\u2019s hands and feet, he looked away and chatted with Yan Mu. God, if you always stare at people\u2019s inconvenient places, it would be too disrespectful to people.When Mingzi saw Lu Chengyu appear, he remembered the scene where he was kicked by the opponent, and he felt pain in her abdomen inexplicably. Seeing that Lu Chengyu hadn\u2019t noticed himself, he couldn\u2019t help asking his buddy A Dong next to him, \u201cA Dong, how do you know this evil god?\u201d A Dong\u00a0looked at Mingzi puzzledly, and then at Yan Mu with an expressionless expression on his face. He lowered his voice and said: \u201cMr. Yan just looks serious, he is very nice.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not him,\u201d Mingzi said carefully while flipping through the skewers, \u201cIt\u2019s the one next to him!\u201d\u201cMr. Lu?!\u201d A Dong was even more puzzled. Mr. Lu always smiles, is gentle, and easy to talk to. Mingzi used the words \u201cdemon\u201d to describe Mr. Lu, which is too inharmonious. \u201cMr. Lu is gentle and literate. He usually treats us well. The bodyguards are also polite to him, do you have any prejudice against him?\u201dMingzi almost couldn\u2019t get up in one breath. What, who is a good gentleman, can kick two big men who are about 1.8 meters high?!\u201cDon\u2019t make it too spicy,\u201d Lu Chengyu said when he saw the stall owner sprinkling chili peppers, \u201cDon\u2019t make it too salty.\u201d\u201cOkay, no problem,\u201d Mingzi responded hurriedly, acting more carefully as if he was afraid that if he sprinkled a little more, he would be kicked.The skewers were quickly set up. Lu Chengyu took the fast-food box with the skewers. After tasting a chicken wing, he remembered that he had forgotten to pay. When he was about to pay, he saw that Yan Mu had already paid for him.Lu Chengyu did not pretend to be sentimental for twenty or thirty yuan, and handed the box to Yan Mu, \u201cThe taste is not bad, you can taste it occasionally.\u201dYan Mu glanced at the skewers sprinkled with various condiments, and picked one. After tasting the chicken wings, the taste was not bad, and the oily fume was a bit heavy, but seeing that Lu Chengyu seemed to like it, he nodded, \u201cNot bad.\u201dMingzi watched the two sit among the rich people, and he was relieved, and said to A Dong, \u201cI knew I would meet him. I might as well set up a stall at the night market.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d A Dong looking at Mingzi suspiciously, \u201cWhat the hell did Mr. Lu do that scared you like this.\u201dMingzi sighed, remembering Lu Chengyu\u2019s thin look, and then looked at his arm with large biceps. He didn\u2019t have the face to say that he was kicked to the corner by the other party, and he couldn\u2019t get up for a long time.Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu didn\u2019t know that the skewers boss had once served as Yan Lao San\u2019s bodyguard, so they couldn\u2019t appreciate the complicated mood of the stall owner. After the two sat down, they ordered tea and started chatting with the other three.In addition to the two of them, Zhuang Yu, Zhang Zeyun and Qi Jingfeng were out to play this time. So when the other three people saw Yan Mu eating the barbecue that Lu Chengyu bought, their expressions were a bit complicated.After being friends with Mu Ge for so many years, while having fun they saw Mu Ge holding a bamboo stick gnawing on the chicken wings, and only Zhuang Yu was the only one who can do this kind of thing. When did Mu Ge become so grounded?\u201cAh, Xiao Lu, these skewers taste good,\u201d said Zhuang Yu, who was the first to react. As he said, he took a skewer of grilled mushrooms from the fast-food box, \u201cHe said just now why Mu Ge asked whether grilled skewers taste good or not. It turned out to be pretty good to eat.\u201d\u201cMy boss is good, this is something you can\u2019t admire.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and passed a bunch of light-flavoured turtledove eggs to Yan Mu. \u201cThis tastes light.\u201dYan Mu silently took the bamboo skewers, ignoring the eyes of hsi few friends, and immersed himself in the barbecue that was not nutritious for him: \u201cI heard that there is a restaurant selling yellow pea soup that tastes very good. Do you want to buy a bowl later and try it?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Lu Chengyu nodded when he heard the food, \u201cOkay, okay.\u201dZhuang Yu looked at Yan Mu helplessly. What age is this? He is very anxious as a bystander while the person is using such a small and fresh trick to chase people.Zhang Zeyun smiled beside him and said: \u201cYes, I also heard that yellow pea soup is very good, and you two can go and taste it together.\u201dQi Jingfeng wanted to say that he wants to go too, but he doesn\u2019t know why, under Zhang Zeyun\u2019s smile, he was stunned that he could not say so, and instead smiled and agreed: \u201cYes, I have eaten it before. It is delicious. Go and taste it.\u201d\u201cWell, that must not be missed.\u201d Lu Chengyu felt Yan Mu as a friend is still very accomplished in eating. How can people like Yan Mu who are not proficient in eating come with them?After the barbecue, the few people chatted together for a while, and Yan Mu said, \u201cNow let\u2019s taste the yellow pea soup? Otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to eat after dinner.\u201d\u201cOk\u201d. Lu Chengyu greeted the others before talking to Yan Mu. They walked slowly along the riverside together, looking for the yellow pea soup shop.The fence next to the road is made of marble with auspicious cloud patterns carved on it. It has a very ancient flavour. There are various antique-style shops next to it. It is a famous leisure and entertainment area in Beijing, so many tourists came to play at any time on the riverside. It also created a lot of consumption.When, they came to a small shop selling yellow pea soup, Lu Chengyu bought two bowls, holding a bowl with Yan Mu, leaning on the fence while eating and enjoying the river view. Although the posture is not beautiful, it feels quite pleasant.In his previous life, after graduating from university, he ran around, knowing where to eat food, but he didn\u2019t necessarily have time to eat. This life now makes him extremely satisfied.\u201cMy father and mother brought me here when I was a child. At that time, it hadn\u2019t been built yet, but many people would come to play.\u201d Lu Chengyu frowned, pointing to a large Huang Ge tree in the distance, and said, \u201cI remember that an old woman was selling handmade cloth shoes under the tree. My mother bought me a pair of shoes embroidered with tiger heads. At that time, I didn\u2019t want to wear cloth shoes because they were old-fashioned. Now I regret it a bit, but no one has given it to me again.\u201d At this point, he reluctantly smiled.\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201d Unwilling to see the smile on Lu Chengyu\u2019s face drop, Yan Mu held his wrist and led the person under the Huang Ge tree without any explanation.Lu Chengyu was taken aback for a moment, and then followed Yan Mu\u2019s footsteps forward. When he walked under the Huang Ge tree, he saw several old ladies selling handicrafts under the tree. There were shoes, fans, sachets, satchels, hats, etc. in front of them. They were very beautiful and delicate in traditional style. There was no such rusticity in his memory at all.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t know whether his memory deceived him, or he didn\u2019t appreciate it at all when he was a child.Just when he was in a daze, Yan Mu stepped forward and bought a pair of shoes, a hat, and a safety sachet that was hung on the car by an old lady. He stuffed things into Lu Chengyu\u2019s hand. \u201cOhh\u2026, it\u2019s pretty.\u201dLooking at these three things in his arms, Lu Chengyu slowly laughed, his eyes burning. He said: \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Yan Mu tilted his head and didn\u2019t look at Lu Chengyu, \u201cAlthough the shoes are not tiger shoes, the patterns on them are quite interesting.\u201d\u201cWell, they look good.\u201d Lu Chengyu blinked, looking at the patterns on the of entwined branches, and felt that it was simple but with a touch of unsurpassed beauty.When Yan Mu looked back at Lu Chengyu, he saw that his face was full of smiles, and his smile was extraordinarily gentle and beautiful.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHis heart trembled slightly, and he couldn\u2019t speak for a while.Just when the atmosphere was right, an unexpected person appeared.\u201cMr. Lu, it\u2019s such a coincidence that I met you here,\u201d Song Junyan walked with two peers with a surprised expression on his face, as if he didn\u2019t expect to meet Lu Chengyu.\u201cMr. Song?\u201d Lu Chengyu glanced at Song Junyan and the two behind him, \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d He suspected that Song Junyan would catch up as soon as he went out, otherwise, how there would be so many coincidences in the world.\u201cYeah, this is\u2026\u201d When Song Junyan looked at Yan Mu, his expression suddenly changed. It seemed that because Lu Chengyu was there, he could barely maintain the smile on his face. He looked at Yan Mu and said, \u201cYou are here.\u201dYan Mu looked at Song Junyan blankly, without saying a word, as if the other party was not talking to him.\u201cJunyan, this is not\u2026\u201d The friend behind him wanted to speak but was stopped by Song Junyan\u2019s eyes. He turned his head and smiled at Lu Chengyu, \u201cI won\u2019t disturb you, let\u2019s go.\u201d He turned around and left, but accidentally bumped into the friend behind him, staggering in embarrassment.Lu Chengyu cared: \u201cMr. Song, are you okay? Are you in a hurry now? Don\u2019t be too anxious. Look at your feet.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you.\u201d Song Junyan stood still and hurriedly dropped a goodbye.When his two friends saw him leaving, they turned their heads and screamed at Yan Mu, before hurriedly chasing after him, as if they didn\u2019t look at Yan Mu.With this action, as long as a person had a normal mind, he would guess what there was a past or contradictions between the two, what Song Junyan wanted strictly was Lu Chengyu\u2019s suspicion.He expected him to think that Yan Mu had a disgusting personality. If Lu Chengyu asked about him, Yan Mu would be disgusted.Who in Yan Mu\u2019s eyes was an illegitimate child who was hated and couldn\u2019t get on the stage?But this illegitimate son just got close to President Yan Mu\u2019s assistant. What would President Yan Mu think?Lu Chengyu looked at Song Junyan\u2019s hurried departure, and said with emotion: \u201cThis is the conscience of the industry.\u201dYan Mu looked at him blankly.\u201cTo make us feel bad, he used his life to act,\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed and shook his head, \u201cAnd has the energy to play with these things, that don\u2019t do well. It\u2019s a pity he is not in the industry with his good acting skills and that beautiful face. \u201cYan Mu hesitated for a moment, and finally asked, \u201cHis face is good-looking?\u201d\u201cNot bad,\u201d Lu Chengyu turned around and walked back with Yan Mu, \u201cBut compared to you boss, it\u2019s a far cry. I like your look better.\u201d Of course, if the expression was a little bit more lively, it will be even better.The corners of Yan Mu\u2019s mouth moved, and he decided not to worry about such superficial things as looks.\u201cYou said he\u2019s an illegitimate child, why is he looking for trouble?\u201d Lu Chengyu frowned. \u201cIf your dad went out to find his mother, you and Aunt Mu are the biggest victims, okay?\u201dYan Mu said indifferently: \u201cPerhaps he thinks that I have the power of Huading, and he is not reconciled.\u201dLu Chengyu frowned and said after a long time: \u201cReally boring.\u201d Hearing that Yan Mu\u2019s mother was beautiful and intellectual, she met a man like Yan Mu\u2019s father and passed away early, it was extremely unlucky.Fortunately, she was not an ignorant woman. Before she died, she used to mean to force the mistress to be unable to enter the door of Yan\u2019s house and arranged the best way for her son.Maybe if it weren\u2019t for her being sick, Yan Mu\u2019s father might end up the one dying because of illness, but it was a wasteful death.It was a pity that there was no fairness in the world. As a result, Aunt Mu died of illness and Yan Mu went abroad to study. Then the Mu family suppressed the Yan family and made Yan Mu the final winner.However, no matter what Yan Mu finally got, he doesn\u2019t have a good memory of his youth, and he was not a winner.Seeing Lu Chengyu frowning, Yan Mu persuaded him: \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dLu Chengyu turned his head to look at him, and said for a while, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dHe patted Yan Mu on the shoulder. No wonder Yan Mu\u2019s expression is so little. It must be the bastard dad!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In front of him, he saw a photo of Lu Chengyu eating yellow pea soup by the river. In the corner of the photo, Yan Mu was also showing half of his arm.Lu Chengyu took a closer look. It turned out that this was a Weibo posted by a netizen who recognized him. Now the amount of reposting of this Weibo has reached nearly a thousand, and he didn\u2019t know how Zhuang Yu found this Weibo.\u201cYou look good with me,\u201d Lu Chengyu had already put the things Yan Mu bought for him into the car. At this time, with his hands empty, he took out his mobile phone and took a landscape photo of the river. With a smiling face, he posted it on Weibo.\u201cDo you have more than seven million fans?\u201d Zhuang Yu glanced at Lu Chengyu\u2019s phone, with a look of suspicion, \u201cAren\u2019t you paying for fans?\u201dLu Chengyu nodded and said with a serious face: \u201cYes, 10.50 yuan, do you want to buy?\u201d\u201cCut it out,\u201d Zhuang Yu gave Lu Chengyu a blank look, knowing that the other party was joking with him, so he didn\u2019t take it seriously.Yan Mu looked at the phone in Lu Chengyu\u2019s hand and asked in a flat tone: \u201cIs Weibo fun?\u201d If it weren\u2019t for his interrogative sentence, people would think that he was saying Weibo was not fun at all.After hearing this, Lu Chengyu put down his phone and said to Yan Mu: \u201cIt\u2019s not fun, but sometimes I get bored or happy. You can find someone to share and pass the time.\u201d Weibo is a place for people with loneliness to vent their emotions.Yan Mu nodded, then silently began to fiddle with his mobile phone.After a while, Lu Chengyu found out that under the Weibo that he had just posted, they were all asking who\u2019s the person with half of his arm in that photo. They all looked like they had been injected with chicken blood, just by seeing that half of the arm. The owner was like his companion.Lu Chengyu was a little surprised. Today, these netizens seem to be extraordinarily enthusiastic, and what\u2019s wrong with showing half of their arms instead of showing half of their bodies.\u201cIs this your Weibo name?\u201d Yan Mu suddenly handed over the phone, and the Weibo search page was displayed on it. The first account was \u201cYear More Than\u201d with a golden V next to it. It was him.\u201cHuh?\u201d Lu Chengyu nodded and then froze for a while, \u201cBoss, are you ready to use Weibo too?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll, check it out.\u201d After Yan Mu followed Lu Chengyu, he followed Zhuang Yu casually and started watching some popular topics on Weibo.Only then did Lu Chengyu react. Among the many newly added fans, he found a Weibo named Yan Mu and clicked the follow button. Finally, when he chose the category, he classified Yan Mu as a close friend.Yan Mu saw that Lu Chengyu was paying attention to him, so he coughed\u00a0dryly, he then put the phone in his pocket, and said seriously, \u201cIsn\u2019t it about time to eat fish?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Qi Jingfeng and the others were taken aback and then nodded: \u201cYes, we are going to the boat to eat fish.\u201d He glanced around, \u201cIf someone recognizes Xiao Lu, it will be troublesome.\u201d It would be disappointing if a bunch of people gathered around to take pictures and want to sign or something.Yan Mu stood up, \u201cOkay.\u201dLu Chengyu followed and stood up. When he got on the boat, he remembered that he seemed to have followed Yan Mu in this way. He didn\u2019t even know if anyone else followed.Turning his head and looking behind him, he saw that Zhang Zeyun and the others were there, so he continued to follow Yan Mu.Zhuang Yu said that, \u201cXiao Lu appeared in only one scene in the movie, how can he be more famous than those actors who acted in a lot of movies?\u201dAfter the group sat down in the box, Qi Jingfeng opened the window and looked at the scenery on the river. He could be recognized in a place with so many people. These people were amazing.\u201cIt depends on luck if it is red or not,\u201d Zhuang Yu, who ran the movie city, knows the entertainment industry better than Qi Jingfeng, \u201cIt looks like Xiao Lu has a high degree of education, and he is a rich, handsome and a good actor as well. In addition to the recent incident, Xiao Lu is the most talked about person recently. It would be strand if he was not popular.\u201d\u201cI really can\u2019t see it,\u201d Qi Jingfeng glanced at Lu Chengyu who was talking to Yan Mu. \u201cThose people in the entertainment industry must be envious of him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all fate,\u201d Zhuang Yu chose from the menu for the same dish he likes, he handed the menu to Qi Jingfeng, \u201cWe care about so many things. Anyway, Xiao Lu doesn\u2019t mix in the entertainment industry. Besides, this kind of redness will not be cared for after a while.\u201d\u201cFrom the current conditions, it\u2019s a shame for him not to be an entertainer.\u201d Qi Jingfeng was not interested in eating fish, so he handed the menu to Lu Chengyu.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t mind Qi Jingfeng\u2019s words. He smiled and took the menu and put it between him and Yan Mu, \u201cBoss, which one do you like?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a particular choice, you can choose.\u201d Yan Mu looked down at Lu Chengyu. Looking at the menu, with a smile on the corners of his eyes, he raised his head and said, \u201cBeing an entertainer involves eating less meals, and now he is very good.\u201dZhang Zeyun looked at the atmosphere between the two, wondering if it was his illusion. It seems that since they ate yellow pea soup just now, something seems to be different between the two.After ordering the food, it was necessary to kill live fish to ensure the taste of the fish, before the meal. So the few people tucked into the dried fruits provided for free before the meal, chatting about some interesting things that happened in Beijing recently to pass the time. Later they started to talk about Song Junyan who suddenly appeared recently.\u201cI always said that the woman surnamed Song is shameless,\u201d Qi Jingfeng said harshly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be cheap, and raise her son to be like her. Isn\u2019t it a disgusting person\u2019s intentions?\u201dZhang Zeyun thinks that Qi Jingfeng abusing Mu-ge\u2019s home things is not very good, but he looked up to see Yan Mu looking calm, only lightly saying: \u201cDo you care about what these people do, Muge looks down on him, why are you jumping around?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this too hard to see?\u201d Qi Jingfeng drank a sip of tea and frowned, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for that mother and son duo making things like that, Brother Mu wouldn\u2019t have spent so many years abroad alone. How old was Brother Mu back then? How much bitterness did he suffer?!\u201dAs Yan Mu\u2019s friend, he felt angry when he thought of those things that happened back then. Had it not been for the high status of Mu Ge\u2019s grandfather, Mu Ge would have endured hardships for nothing. Maybe before Uncle Yan passed away, Song Junyan would have taken over the position.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t understand these things, so he didn\u2019t speak from beginning to end. At the end of hearing this, he couldn\u2019t help turning his head to look at Yan Mu, who knew that Yan Mu just turned his head to look at him.With their eyes facing each other, Lu Chengyu was stunned. For some reason, he could see the firmness in these eyes, as if none of these things could affect him. He opened his mouth, but he couldn\u2019t say any comforting words.At this time, the door was gently pushed, and several waitresses in Hanfu brought dishes to the table. The fishes were packed in exquisite retro-style ceramic fish bowls, which looked delicious and beautiful.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cEveryone, please take your time, do you need to keep someone for serving?\u201d The foreman asked with a smile. After all, some of the guests here liked the waiter to serve, and some people didn\u2019t like someone watching them eating. So, it is a rule to always ask the customer what they want, and then decide whether to keep someone here to serve.\u201cNo need,\u201d Zhang Zeyun smiled politely, \u201cThank you.\u201dAfter the waiters had all stepped back, Zhang Zeyun said: \u201cIt\u2019s useless for you to get angry now. What we have to do now is to stare at the people so that they won\u2019t disturb Brother Mu.\u201d\u201cHe lives upstairs in the same building as mine.\u201d Lu Chengyu opened the chopstick\u2019s packaging and calmly clipped a piece of steamed sea bass, after dipping it in the sauce bowl, \u201cI meet him every day.\u201d\u201d Do you stay upstairs? \u201d Zhang Zeyun frowned: \u201cWhat kind of trick does he want to play?\u201dHe glanced at Lu Chengyu. Did Song Junyan want to start from Lu Chengyu and add blockage to Brother Mu?\u201cWe don\u2019t pay any attention to what he does.\u201d Lu Chengyu felt that the fish tasted good, and couldn\u2019t help but pick even more. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s interesting to watch this kind of person act in front of us.\u201dZhang Zeyun looked at Lu Chengyu with a complicated expression, and it took a long time to say: \u201cXiao Lu is a sensible person.\u201d He then thought, Lu Chengyu knew who Song Junyan was, and Song Junyan was still acting in front of Lu Chengyu. This\u2026 he suddenly felt that Song Junyan is quite stupid.\u201cXiao Lu, you are the real master,\u201d Zhuang Yu stretched out his thumb to Lu Chengyu, and then said to Yan Mu, \u201cBrother Mu, you have to hold on to Xiao Lu, don\u2019t let him be snatched away. \u201cYan Mu nodded: \u201cWell, I won\u2019t be robbed of him.\u201dLu Chengyu glanced at the two silently. Is this kind of dialogue okay? It seems\u2026something is wrong.After eating, several people strolled around the river, and then drove back.Zhang Zeyun didn\u2019t drive by himself, so when he went back, he got into Yan Mu\u2019s car and sat down. After the car started, Zhang Zeyun said, \u201cBrother Mu, Xiao Lu is very smart. Smart people tend to have a lot of thoughts.\u201dYan Mu looked straight ahead without speaking but frowned slightly.Zhang Zeyun noticed the slight change in his expression and suddenly smiled: \u201cI know if I say that, you will be like this.\u201d He sighed, \u201cTo be honest, Xiao Lu is very good. Smart, knowing the current affairs, political manoeuvring, and interesting.\u201d\u201cThese are his advantages,\u201d Yan Mu said solemnly, \u201cI know what you want to say.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean anything else, but I don\u2019t want your feelings to be hurt. \u201cZhang Zeyun looked out the window, \u201cA person like Xiao Lu is not easy to be moved. He is even less like a person who puts love first.\u201dBeing a friend, with someone like Lu Chengyu is very good, but if you are a lover, Zhang Zeyun worried that Yan Mu would be injured on this emotional road.People are selfish. He admires Lu Chengyu very much, but in his heart, it is natural that Yan Mu, a long-time friend, is more important.\u201cI understand.\u201d Yan Mu stopped the car when he met the traffic light. \u201cIf he becomes what you want, maybe I won\u2019t like him.\u201dZhang Zeyun was silent, and it took a long time to show a wry smile. Mu Ge was right. If Lu Chengyu became what he thought was suitable for Mu Ge, maybe Mu Ge would look down on him again.Human feelings are so strange, knowing that it is not necessarily suitable, but they cannot be controlled.\u201cI understand,\u201d Zhang Zeyun rubbed his forehead, \u201cI think too much.\u201d\u201cMy mother told me that if a relationship hasn\u2019t started, but you first think about how to end it, then the relationship isn\u2019t necessary to be started.\u201d Yan Mu squeezed his hands tightly on the steering wheel. \u201cAlthough she chose a wrong relationship to start, it doesn\u2019t mean I will follow her old path.\u201dZhang Zeyun thought about the grievances between the Yan family and the Mu family and couldn\u2019t speak anymore. Lu Chengyu was not Uncle Yan, and Brother Mu was not Aunt Mu. Maybe these two people will finally be able to walk together and live happilyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the other party said a few more words to close the doors and windows, he hung up.Looking at the blackened cell phone screen, Lu Chengyu smiled, turned on the computer, and searched for news about himself on the Internet.There was something wrong with the comments on his Weibo today, and many netizens mentioned Yan Mu. For no reason, so many people wouldn\u2019t mention it suddenly.When he checked this, things became interesting. From yesterday to today, many posts about him and Yan Mu suddenly appeared on the forum. These posts not only posted pictures of him and Yan Mu, but also said in a guessing tone that there was an ambiguity between him and Yan Mu, and even that they may be a pair. This is like an innocent girl, guessing about beautiful feelings, but there is no guarantee that these are true.These photos were nothing more than the photos of him when Yan Mu was holding him at the police station, and some of the photos were of this afternoon of him sitting with Yan Mu and drinking tea.One post also mentioned the secret photo of him on Weibo and found all kinds of evidence to prove that the owner of the half-arm exposed on the photo was Yan Mu, and then used the sentence \u201cI believe in true love again\u201d. end.I love your sister[1]!Lu Chengyu closed these posts speechlessly. Two men who ate together have true love. So many couples who have never left each other behind have been together for decades. Why haven\u2019t I seen anyone praise their true love as touching?Or if one of him and Yan Mu were unsightly, will anyone call it true love?At this time, Weibo became lively again, because someone found Yan Mu\u2019s Weibo in Lu Chengyu\u2019s Weibo follower list, and Lu Chengyu was found in Yan Mu\u2019s Weibo follower list, and the screenshot showed that Lu Chengyu was the first person whom Yan Mu followed after opening his account on Weibo.As soon as this screenshot came out, netizens who joined the fun forwarded this Weibo one after another, and they wrote one word neatly while forwarding, that is, \u201ctogether\u201d.Most netizens just joined in the fun, and they also know that this kind of thing can\u2019t be taken seriously at all, and everyone is joking about this kind of thing. Turning around, they knew what should be done or not done?Lu Chengyu discovered that these things only slowly started to appear from yesterday afternoon, and looking at the frequency of posting, it seemed as if these people had made appointments. Some people posted, some responded, and someone deliberately caused some people to post pictures. It proved that it was simply a well-rehearsed play.But who was so boring as to cause arguments about him and Yan Mu on the Internet?Is this person Yan Mu\u2019s opponent or his opponent?If it is Yan Mu\u2019s opponent, it seems that it is of little use to discredit him by using the Internet. Let alone now that Yan Mu is not gay, even if Yan Mu was gay, it will not have much influence.If it were his opponent, then this method would be even more stupid. The best way was to portray him as a little white face who depends on his appearance and wants to use unspoken with his boss. Now, this method of preaching that he and Yan Mu are true love is too gentle, and he is embarrassed to say that the person behind the scenes is his opponent.Unable to guess the conspiracy behind this incident, Lu Chengyu thought for a while and dialled Yan Mu\u2019s phone.When Yan Mu just got home, he hurriedly answered the phone when he saw Lu Chengyu\u2019s call, \u201cXiao Lu?\u201d He didn\u2019t call the other assistant Lu intentionally, and thought will the other party notice this?\u201cBoss, it might be a bit of a hassle online,\u201d Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with this name. Anyway, many people around him call him that. It\u2019s not surprising that Yan Mu calls him that way.He checked the IP addresses of several posters. Not surprisingly, all these people used proxy IPs. \u201cAre you home now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d Yan Mu strode upstairs and entered the study and turned on the computer and held his breath, \u201cWhat happened online?\u201dAfter listening to Lu Chengyu\u2019s narration, Yan Mu\u2019s heart was relieved. He thought that someone on the Internet was looking for trouble with Lu Chengyu: \u201cOnline remarks, Don\u2019t care too much.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Lu Chengyu found that Yan Mu was calmer than himself, and instantly felt like he was making a fuss,\u201cI\u2019m just worried about affecting you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not an artist, so I won\u2019t be afraid of what they say,\u201d Yan Mu clicked on those posts and looked at the pictures that he didn\u2019t even know about. He couldn\u2019t help but click a few times with his hand on the mouse and save the pictures on the computer. \u201cThose pictures were taken very well.\u201dHe seemed to think that the photos of him standing with Lu Chengyu were the best. He almost couldn\u2019t help saying \u201ctogether\u201d when he looked at a bunch of netizens below and said they were true love.\u201cI can probably guess who is behind the scenes.\u201d Yan Mu\u2019s index finger trembled several times, and finally suppressed his urge to register to leave a message. \u201cI don\u2019t care about such trivial matters, so don\u2019t take it too seriously.\u201dLu Chengyu listened. Yan Mu didn\u2019t care about this online news, so he smiled and said, \u201cDo you think that Song Junyan let people spread the news?\u201dYan Mu said while looking for photos to save in the post, \u201cHis intention is very simple, he knows I hate rumours with irrelevant people, so he deliberately used these to make us two have conflicts.\u201dHearing this, Lu Chengyu touched his chin and said, \u201cThis method is quite naive.\u201d Although he couldn\u2019t see Yan Mu\u2019s expression, he guessed that the other party must be expressionless now.\u201cWell,\u201d the corner of Yan Mu\u2019s mouth raised, \u201cYou are not someone else, why would I be disgusted with you because of these scandals, Song Junyan doesn\u2019t know us too much.\u201dAlthough these words were plain and not sensational, Lu Chengyu felt abnormal. Well, he has to admit that Yan Mu\u2019s words had increased his favourability for Yan Mu: \u201cHaha, boss, you are not someone else, and I also don\u2019t care about this kind of content.\u201dYan Mu shook his hand, and closed the post carefully, but at this time he didn\u2019t have the mind to manage the post. The corners of his lips rising proved his good mood at this time, \u201cYou should rest early, don\u2019t worry about such trivial things online, and come to work tomorrow. \u201cLu Chengyu hung up the phone and looked at the time on the computer desktop. It turned out that it was already after ten o\u2019clock. He stood up and stretched out, looked at the messy room, turned off the computer, and went back to the room to sleep.As for Song Junyan\u2019s method, he should just read it as a joke. If he cares about these remarks on the Internet, wouldn\u2019t it be more unbearable for him to hear the words he heard in real life in his previous life?When he went to work the next day, the attitude of his colleagues remained the same. Although some people saw the posts on the Internet, no one would take them seriously. After all, what kind of people Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu are, they know in their hearts how they can link things online with reality.However, Lu Chengyu was stopped by Cao Jingshen when he went to the secretary department to get information. He knew by looking at Cao Jingshen\u2019s expression that what the other party wanted to say might have something to do with the Internet.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgSure enough, Cao Jingshen started to mention the famous \u201ctogether\u201d incident on the Internet.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on online?\u201d Cao Jingshen closed the office door and said in a low voice, \u201cDid someone trouble you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that someone troubling me, it\u2019s that someone is troubling the boss,\u201d Lu Chengyu saw that Cao Jingshen put a few boxes of breakfast milk on the table, and unceremoniously took a box to drink. \u201cI checked the posters and found that they are all professionals. The things in Song Junyan\u2019s computer are very simple, but I found that in his browsing records, there are many posts about me and Yan Mu. This matter is related to him.\u201d\u201cYou went to his house?\u201d Cao Jingshen said, knowing that Song Junyan was living upstairs from Lu Chengyu, he frowned when he heard Lu Chengyu\u2019s words, \u201cStay away from this person, or you will be the trouble at that time.\u201d\u201cI can get his Wi-Fi signal downstairs.\u201d Lu Chengyu drank more than half of the breakfast milk in a few mouthfuls. \u201cTo check the\u00a0contents of his computer, do I need to go to his house?\u201d Cao Jingshen was silent for a while and suddenly grabbed more than half of the breakfast milk from Lu Chengyu. : \u201cSince there is no problem, you go back to your office.\u201d This kid knows some hacking methods.\u201cBrother Cao, don\u2019t be so stingy,\u201d Lu Chengyu snatched the breakfast milk back with a grin. After gulping a few sips, he put the empty box back on Cao Jingshen\u2019s desk, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cFuck you.\u201d Cao Jingshen said, pushing his glasses up his nose, \u201cThe average person\u2019s skin is much thinner than you.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled even more brilliantly: \u201cDon\u2019t say that, I\u2019ll be embarrassed.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t guess that you could get embarrassed.\u201d Cao Jingshen raised his eyebrows and said suddenly, \u201cDoes the boss know about this?\u201d\u201cI told him about it last night,\u201d Lu Chengyu\u2019s expression became serious. \u201cThe boss doesn\u2019t mind this kind of thing. I don\u2019t understand the use of Song\u00a0Junyan\u2019s trick.\u201dCao Jingshen glanced at him with a complicated look, then moved his gaze away and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not very useful, but someone like Yan Lao San can probably use this to come to the company to make trouble.\u201dHow could he tell Lu Chengyu that Yan Mu is a man? Who would care that people made jokes about the relationship between him and the person he likes?As Yan Mu\u2019s secretary, he knew what he should say and what he should not say, so he just said, \u201cAs long as it can add obstacles to the boss, Song Junyan is not willing to let it go.\u201d\u201cThen he is persistent,\u201d Lu Chengyu shrugged, remembering Song Junyan\u2019s previous performances, \u201cSince he is a beam jumping clown, I don\u2019t care about it.\u201d\u201cYou still have to pay more attention,\u201d Cao Jingshen hesitated and said. \u201cSong Junyan is a bit vicious in addition to scheming.\u201dSong Junyan was so cruel at a young age, let alone now.Realizing that Cao Jingshen\u2019s remarks might have hidden some things in the past, but Lu Chengyu saw that he didn\u2019t seem to want to discuss it, so he didn\u2019t ask more: \u201cThank you, Brother Cao, I noted it down.\u201dHe\u00a0left the secretarial department. , Lu Chengyu returned to his office, saw the door of the president\u2019s room open, and walked towards the president\u2019s room when he turned a corner. Unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived at the door, he saw Yan Mu and Yan Lao Er facing each other.Yan Mu was still expressionless, but Yan Lao Er\u2019s expression was a little strange.Unexpectedly, Yan Lao San, who liked to trouble Yan Mu, did not come, but the calm-minded Yan Lao Er came.\u201cXiao Lu,\u201d Yan Mu saw Lu Chengyu, his face softened a bit, although this was not obvious, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cSorry, did I bother you two?\u201d Lu Chengyu held the schedule in his hand. He didn\u2019t know why, but he thought this scene looks a bit weird.\u201cNo,\u201d Yan Mu glanced at Yan Lao Er, \u201cSecond Uncle has nothing important to do.\u201dYan Lao Er\u2019s eyebrows trembled, and he turned to look at Lu Chengyu who appeared at the door. The originally somewhat complicated look in his eyes suddenly became even more serious. It\u2019s complicated, it\u2019s like looking at a junior who doesn\u2019t suit one\u2019s likingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It makes you look as if you are not a male or female, this looks a bit too inviting,\u201d the second uncle Yan put his hands behind him, a little disgusted:\u201d I heard that a man with these looks is unreliable.\u201dEven though Lu Chengyu, who thought he had done a good job on the surface, couldn\u2019t help but purse his mouth after hearing this, he didn\u2019t even have a girlfriend. Where did the peach blossom come from? He looked at Yan Mu suspiciously and found that the other party\u2019s face that had not changed for thousands of years was a little helpless, and he obviously didn\u2019t believe this kind of argument. He had to smile and say: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, my parents gave me this look.\u201dOld second Yan raised his eyebrows: \u201cYour parents are very good; you don\u2019t look like them.\u201dLu Chengyu felt suspicious. How did Second Uncle Yan know the looks of his parents, but thinking that the incident about him and Liang Deyou was so big some time ago, Lu Chengyu understood that Yan Lao Er may have investigated him after this incident, \u201cProbably I have gathered my parent\u2019s strengths?\u201dYan Lao Er: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSecond Uncle,\u201d Yan Mu motioned to Lu Chengyu to enter the office, closing the office by the way, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to make things obvious.\u201dYan Lao Er said with a smile: \u201cYou\u2019re such a big person, I care about what you do with these things.\u201d He sat down on the sofa, folding his legs and said, \u201cThis is not your assistant, how can you have a cup? Don\u2019t you have brewed coffee?\u201dYan Mu took a glass of water from the drinking fountain and put it in front of him and said with a straight face: \u201cOld people should drink more boiled water, which is good for your health.\u201dObviously, this cheap disposable paper cup couldn\u2019t please Yan Lao Er. He glanced at the paper cup and stretched out his hand. None of the people were going to get the cup. Yan Lao Er glanced at the tidy office of the president with a cold eye, \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t care about Huading, I have 10.6% of the shares in my hand, and I have the right to make decisions.\u201dYan Mu didn\u2019t seem to hear the meaning inside and was silent.\u201cBefore your father died, he held 48% of the shares, but you only have 38% in your hands.\u201d Yan Lao Er lit a cigarette and smoked slowly, \u201cYou know Why?\u201dYan Mu glanced at Yan Lao Er, his expression remained the same as before, as if the other party\u2019s words had no effect on him from beginning to end.\u201cYou don\u2019t look like our Yan family at all,\u201d Yan Lao Er smiled indifferently. \u201cPeople say that most of our Yan family members are smiling tigers. How come you are born like this. So boring?\u201dStanding in the corner, Lu Chengyu touched his nose and thought. Probably Boss Yan left this genetic gene to Song Junyan, and Yan Mu may be more like the Mu family. He thought of the Mu family who came to him last time. They seemed to be of the low-speaking and rigorous type. Together with Yan Mu, they looked like very close relatives.Yan Lao Er did not care about himself, and he flicked the ash and said: \u201cYour dad held the other 10% of the shares, 6% is given to me and the third, and the remaining 4%. I gave it to that woman and her son. If your mother hadn\u2019t worked hard to accumulate 10% of Huading\u2019s shares during her lifetime, then it would not necessarily be you who was sitting here today.\u201d Until now, he felt that if the eldest brother and sister-in-law were close enough, than Huading\u2019s development would definitely have been more than it is now. Sister-in-law, it is indeed a pity for you to marry my elder brother.\u201cSecond Uncle, you also said, my mother, left me 10% of the shares,\u201d Yan Mu mentioned the past, without frowning, \u201cFather is willing to give shares to other people, it is his business. But second uncle should know that 52% of Huading\u2019s shares are in my hands, and I am the most indispensable shareholder.\u201d If it is clearly a domineering side, once it is said, it is like telling a fact. Maybe not so domineering, because the tone was more helpless than domineering.\u201cYes, you didn\u2019t learn our Yan family\u2019s smiley tiger tricks, but when it comes to ruthlessness, the Yan family\u2019s people are not as good as you,\u201d Yan Lao Er took another cigarette. \u201cAt the beginning of the Huading civil strife, I thought it was also your intention. Then, take this opportunity to drive away some people and buy back 4% of the stocks from the stock market. You are taking the Yan industry adventure, you know?\u201dYan Mu raised his eyebrows, \u201cSo what? \u201c\u201cYeah, so what? Without the Yan family, you still have the Mu family backing you up,\u201d Yan Lao Er sneered, \u201cYou are more like the Mu family, but it\u2019s a pity that people are not as good as the sky. Someone is in your hands who is buying Huading\u2019s stocks at an ultra-low price, if not, I am afraid that you will make Huading mess up for a little longer.\u201dLu Chengyu trembled and looked up at Yan Mu. He is the one who bought Huading\u2019s bulk shares at a super low price?No wonder the stock price of a company as big as Huading will drop to the lowest in the stock market, even cheaper than a bank with the notoriously lowest stock price in the stock market. It turns out that there are still these twists and turns.However, they said these internal fighting secrets in front of him like this, it was really not good at all, he didn\u2019t want to listen to them at all, okay?The eyes of Yan Mu and Yan Lao Er met in the air. After a long staring match, Yan Mu suddenly stood up, opened the window behind him, and said expressionlessly: \u201cI refuse to smoke second-hand smoke.\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s mouth smirked several times. Only barely suppressing his urge to laugh, he looked at the cigarette between Yan Lao Er\u2019s index finger sympathetically, and the other party was obviously in an awkward position whether to diffuse the cigarette or not. Finally, he saw this slowly pinch out the cigarette in the ashtray.Feeling that he could no longer listen to these conversations, Lu Chengyu thought for a while and was about to go out to make coffee for a while before coming back. As a result, he was stopped by Yan Lao Er before his hand touched the doorknob.\u201cYour name is Lu Chengyu, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Yan Lao Er squinted at Lu Cheng Yu who was standing by the door, then turned to Yan Mu and said, \u201cYou are so promising to find a fresh graduate student as an assistant. The third was trying to set you up last night. I called several shareholders overnight, saying that it was your style. If I hadn\u2019t helped you suppress it, do you think it would be so quiet today?\u201dLu Chengyu felt that Yan Lao Er was a little strange, saying that he admired Yan Mu, then he said something very mean. Speaking of his calculations, why did he deliberately reveal to Yan Mu what Yan Lao San was doing behind his back? Doesn\u2019t this mean giving his opponent a cheap pick? And he looked at his eyes as if he was looking at a nasty ghost who had ruined his nephew.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWhen he first entered Huading, he didn\u2019t see these strange places. Today\u2019s environment is enough to make him aware of these things.Yan Lao Er was too contradictory.Hearing the other party criticizing him, Lu Chengyu smiled politely, as if Yan Lao Er was not talking about himself.\u201cHe has done his work well, so I will use him,\u201d Yan Mu opened a folder and signed it. \u201cOlder age does not mean good workability. People\u2019s brains will not grow with age, now will they become smart.\u201d Yan Lao Er\u2019s heart was a little bit choked by these words. Seeing his nephew who was telling the truth, he turned his head to look at Lu Chengyu, \u201cSince you are Yan Mu\u2019s assistant, why are you filming again?\u201d \u201cLu Chengyu smiled and said: \u201cMr. Yan, I\u2019m just helping a friend, and I\u2019m not ready to go filming.\u201d\u201cI think Assistant Lu would be pretty good if he went to film,\u201d Yan Lao Er said with a smile. After all, the appearance conditions are good.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and said: \u201cThe appearance was given by my parents, and the road was chosen by myself.\u201d Mr. Yan looked up.Seeing that he was not humble or arrogant, Yan Lao Er\u2019s expression eased a little, remembering Lu Chengyu at the meeting. Then he asked: \u201cHave you studied martial arts?\u201d\u201cDoes it count as a summer martial arts interest class in elementary and junior high school?\u201d Lu Chengyu asked seriously.He didn\u2019t why Yan Lao Er felt that it was very difficult to talk to the two people in front of him. He didn\u2019t whether he was the problem, or the other two people were the problem: \u201cSince you are an assistant, you should do you job as an assistant. I believe in following professional ethics. Assistant Lu should understand these words as well.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, Mr. Yan,\u201d Lu Chengyu raised the corner of his mouth, showing a perfect smile, \u201cI have understood these four words since I stepped into the gate of Huading.\u201dYan Lao Er took a deep look at him and stood up and said, \u201cIn that case, I\u2019m relieved.\u201d He stood up and said to Yan Mu who was sitting at the desk, \u201cI\u2019m going back, so you can do it yourself.\u201d\u201cMr. Yan, old gentlemen should walk slowly,\u201d Lu Chengyu sent him to the elevator, smiled as the elevator door closed, raised his eyebrows and thought, Yan\u2019s house seemed not as simple as he thought.\u201cMr. Yan,\u201d in the parking lot, the bodyguard saw Yan Lao Er appear and hurriedly opened the car door for him. After Yan Lao Er sat down, he followed him in.Looking at the back of the driver\u2019s head, Yan second suddenly said: \u201cLu Hefeng\u2019s son, he really doesn\u2019t look like him.\u201d The\u00a0bodyguard hesitated after hearing this, and said, \u201cMr. Yan, what are you talking about, he is President Yan\u2019s assistant?\u201d\u201cNo. Who is he still,\u201d Yan Lao Er said, squinting, \u201cHis son is much more than he himself was.\u201d The\u00a0bodyguard knew that this matter involved some commercial secrets, so he didn\u2019t dare to interject in the conversation anymore, and just decided to listen in silence.\u201cHe who is hard-hearted is often unpleasant,\u201d Yan Lao Er put a cigarette in his mouth, and the bodyguard lit the cigarette for him. He took a puff slowly, \u201cI helped him in vain, who knows turning his head. He was killed by falling objects from a high altitude. So, this person is his legacy. Hell wants him to die and no one can save\u00a0him.\u201d The bodyguard reached out his hand to catch the ashes for him, so as not to let it splash on the tailored suit of Yan Lao Er: \u201cMr. Yan, if these things are known to Assistant Lu\u2026\u201d\u201cLu Hefeng kept things so tightly hidden back then, just didn\u2019t want his son to know,\u201d Yan Er half squinted his eyes and looked at the scenery passing by the window, \u201cwhat if that young man knows it, it depends on whether my good nephew is willing to bother to take care of it, otherwise it will end in an accidental death.\u201d The\u00a0bodyguard wanted to say that this assistant was not yet twenty-two years old, it would be a pity if he is inexplicably gone. Is fate a pity? But thinking of the dark things in the circle, he finally swallowed the words into his throat, carefully catching the soot falling from a piece of a cigarette butt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he went to eat at noon, Lu Chengyu deliberately arrived at the restaurant early, and then met Tang Xuan and others. Hearing that they deliberately used the rumours on the Internet to joke with him, he said helplessly: \u201cI say, the person who posted the post is not you, sister Xuan?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be wronged,\u201d Tang Xuan took a step back, pulling the colleague behind him, \u201cYou have to help me testify, I have nothing to do with it.\u201d\u201cThen why are you so happy with gossip?\u201d Lu Chengyu played with the chopsticks in his hand. \u201cWait for the boss to come down, if he heard what you said\u2026\u201d\u201cPay deduction!\u201d Other colleagues grinned. Making fun of Tang Xuan, apparently, no one took this matter to heart, but regarded it as a joke.What kind of identity does the president have? It is simply a combination of the three generations of officials and the second generation of rich. If Assistant Lu and the boss are really the so-called true love, would Xiao Lu still need to be bullied by Prince Liang?\u201cIf I have my salary deducted, I will report you.\u201d Tang Xuan walked around her colleagues in high heels. \u201cWhen I gossip, I am not the only one who is active.\u201dEveryone laughed loudly. A sharp eye saw Yan Mu appear at the entrance of the cafeteria, coughed, and stepped forward to pat Lu Chengyu on the shoulder and said, \u201cAssistant Lu, it\u2019s okay. Everyone does not believe the messy rumours on the Internet.\u201dLu Chengyu was helpless and grateful. He glanced at this male colleague, and at the same time noticed that Yan Mu came over here, he raised his voice and said, \u201cBoss, here.\u201dTang Xuan and others could see that the atmosphere between Lu Chengyu and the boss was as unconstrained as the past. Knowing that this matter will not have any effect on Lu Chengyu, they all went away. When Yan Mu walked to Lu Chengyu\u2019s side, all the people who had surrounded Lu Chengyu\u2019s side had already gone.Yan Mu looked around and saw that Lu Chengyu was holding the chopsticks in his hand: \u201cHave you prepared the food?\u201d\u201cJust chatted with them, forgot to,\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at the food from the Xiaochao District with a smile, \u201cI went to the Xiaochao District today to buy, boss, you will help me eat, and I will treat you to a stir-fry.\u201dHuading\u2019s internal cafeteria has free staff meals, but in order to take care of the staff\u2019s appetite, a small stir-fry area has been specially opened. These stir-fries taste good and the price is a bit cheaper than outside restaurants.Lu Chengyu was already familiar with the cooking chef. As soon as he appeared at the window of the small cooking area, the chef smiled and said, \u201cAssistant Lu, what would you like to order?\u201d He flipped the wok neatly and pulled out a dish. Then he quickly washed the pot to fry the next dish. \u201cToday\u2019s ingredients are all newly bought in the morning and they are all fresh.\u201dLu Chengyu heard the words and quickly reported the names of a few dishes, thinking that Cao Jingshen might come to eat the dishes. He added another dish, \u201cThank you, Master He.\u201d\u201cGood\u201d, Master He neatly poured oil, vegetables, and seasonings. It didn\u2019t take long for Lu Chengyu\u2019s few dishes to be cooked.Lu Chengyu brought the dishes to the table in front of Yan Mu on a tray, and sat down opposite Yan Mu, and said, \u201cMy colleagues say that although you usually look serious, you are still very grounded in what you do.\u201dYan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu with incomprehensibility, he obviously didn\u2019t understand why the other party suddenly said such a thing.\u201cDon\u2019t they say that the bosses of listed companies often don\u2019t come to the cafeteria to eat, they don\u2019t even come to the company often,\u201d Lu Chengyu picked up the dishes, \u201cYou are too inconsistent with the identity of the\u00a0president.\u201d\u201cWhat should the president be like?\u201d Yan Mu picked a chopstick and green pepper and potato shreds, and said after eating, \u201cI am not interested in yachts and luxury cars, and celebrities are even more boring. When I come to the company every day, I can still have you and work with me. This is more interesting than other things.\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s hand holding the chopsticks stopped slightly, and then he said: \u201cSo, it seems that the saying is true.\u201d He took a sip of the soup, \u201cLike me now, there seems to be no difference between more money and less money.\u201dYan Mu remembered that Lu Chengyu is now a person with assets of hundreds of millions, but the other party\u2019s life does not seem to have changed at all, as if the difference between one hundred million and ten thousand is not that big.\u201cIt\u2019s always useful,\u201d Yan Mu thought for a while. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have more money than no money.\u201d\u201cThis comfort is not pleasant at all,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, \u201cBut it\u2019s very useful. It\u2019s better to have money than no money. \u201cAfter eating, Lu Chengyu went to other departments to deal with a temporary incident, but Yan Mu went to the secretarial department to get the list of shareholders of the company that Cao Jingshen had compiled before.\u201cAll the lists with more than 5% holdings are here.\u201d Cao Jingshen didn\u2019t understand why the boss suddenly asked for these lists. Except for the slight difference in the share of these people\u2019s holdings, there was not much change.\u201cI mean, those who are less than 5% and more than 1%,\u201d Yan Mu didn\u2019t look at the list of major shareholders. \u201cI want to find out if there is a relationship between these small shareholders. It\u2019s very intimate.\u201dCao Jingshen suddenly understood when he heard the words, and now he called out the list of these people, there are also nearly 20 people, large and small when he saw a certain name, his expression changed slightly, and he passed the list silently to Yan Mu.During this period, because of the ups and downs, they didn\u2019t have time to focus on the shareholders who bought small number of scattered shares. He had known that he would see this unexpected name, and he should have paid more attention to it.It\u2019s no wonder that the manager of the finance department mentioned Lu Chengyu vaguely to him some time ago. It turned out that it was because of this. Maybe the other party thought he knew about it, so he didn\u2019t mention it again, and he also thought that the other party casually mentioned Lu Chengyu because he was curious about Lu Chengyu\u2019s gossip, so he dealt with the other party vaguely, but he missed it.\u201cThe personal information of these people shows that there is no connection, but I will ask someone to verify it again,\u201d Cao Jingshen said with a slightly embarrassed expression, \u201cIt was a mistake in my work, I didn\u2019t expect\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not your problem, the company still has so many branches, there have been a lot of things recently, it is normal for you to miss it.\u201d According to the regulations, after the holding reaches 5%, shareholders must report to the company, and the company must report to the State Council Securities Regulatory Agency and the Securities Exchange and a large company like Huading was very concerned about 1% of the minority shareholders, let alone a shareholder like Lu Chengyu who holds up to 3%.After he entered Huading, he checked the various shareholders of Huading several times. At that time, there was no Lu Chengyu in the shareholder list, indicating that Lu Chengyu held 3% after he decided to take back the power of Huading.Could it be that when Huading\u2019s stock price was lowest before, it was Lu Chengyu who bought the stock?Or was he wrong? Lu Chengyu bought the shares after he made a lot of money? However, the survey data clearly stated that Lu Chengyu bought 3% of Huading\u2019s stock a few months ago.But even if Huading\u2019s stock price dropped to the lowest level, Lu Chengyu may not have enough money to buy these stocks. Where did Lu Chengyu get that amount of money?\u201cBoss, would you like me to find someone to check\u2026\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Yan Mu turned over the list and looked at the back of the list without a word. \u201cNo one is stupid enough to hold a 3% stake and use their real name as a corporate spy.\u201dCao Jingshen frowned and said, \u201cWhat if he really has a problem?\u201d The office was silent for a few seconds, but Cao Jingshen felt that it had been quiet for a long time inexplicably, which made him a little breathless\u2026This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d Yan Mu stood up, crumpled the list into a ball, and threw it into the trash can. \u201cI believe him.\u201dSeeing Yan Mu walk out of his office, Cao Jingshen rubbed the bridge of his nose with a headache. In fact, he also believed in Lu Chengyu. After all, a smart person like Lu Chengyu would not do such a stupid thing. The point is that the source of the other party\u2019s money is so suspicious that he can\u2019t find a reason.\u201cYour sister Lu Chengyu, if you end up causing humiliation for Lao Tzu, Lao Tzu will really step on your face!\u201d Cao Jingshen checked the company\u2019s internal information about Lu Chengyu while worrying about what was wrong with it.Who knew that Lu Chengyu came to look for him as soon as he finished cursing, still carrying a box of lunch in his hand?\u201cBrother Cao, I saw you work overtime for dinner today, so I brought you food,\u201d Lu Chengyu put the lunch box on the table, and squinted at Cao Jingshen with his hand propped on the desk, \u201cI\u2019m kind enough.\u201dCao Jingshen tweeted. Pushing his glasses, he took the box of lunch and opened it. It was his favourite dish. He looked up at Lu Chengyu\u2019s smiling face: \u201cDo you know what I was doing at noon?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a secret that I shouldn\u2019t know, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d Lu Chengyu took a few steps back and sat down on the sofa. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know at all.\u201d One of the\u00a0workplace rules are that you shouldn\u2019t know. Curiosity killed motivated young people.\u201cIt\u2019s not a secret. I just checked the list of all shareholders of the company.\u201d Cao Jingshen looked up at Lu Chengyu. \u201cThese materials are messy. I spent a lot of time sorting it out. I didn\u2019t even have time to eat.\u201dLu Chengyu was again thinking of the 3% of the shares he holds in the company, he coughed dryly: \u201cThen you must have seen my name.\u201d\u201cI almost thought I saw a person with the same name and surname as you,\u201d Cao Jingshen saw this picture by Lu Chengyu. His expression and his heart relaxed a little. It seems that Lu Chengyu was indeed not a spy sent by another company. \u201cWhy do you have 3% of the company\u2019s shares in your hand, and why are you hiding it?\u201d\u201cI forgot\u201d, Lu Chengyu sighed, \u201cAt that time, I won the 20 million lottery, plus the money my parents left me, I basically used it to buy our company\u2019s stock. Then I kept only a few and sold the others. The money went to make a movie, and then I was busy every day, so, I forgot.\u201d\u201cTwenty million?!\u201d Cao Jingshen felt as if he had opened the door of envy and hatred, \u201cMake a movie? You\u2026 didn\u2019t tell me. Is this your friendship?\u201dLu Chengyu smiled shyly: \u201cHey, that\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to see you for the time being,\u201d Cao Jingshen was pulling the lunch box weakly, \u201cGo to your 20 million. Go to your movie that made three or four\u00a0billion.\u201d\u201cBrother Cao, I don\u2019t have a sister.\u201d Lu Chengyu retreated to the door and waved his hand with a smile, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go back to work, see you later.\u201d\u201cSeeing your size, I assume that I have never heard of this before. It\u2019s so exciting.\u201d As the office door was closed, Cao Jingshen\u2019s originally depressed expression slowly turned into a smiling face. If Lu Chengyu won the 20 million lottery, he would be able to find out as the boss, and Lu Chengyu would not be stupid enough to spread this kind of lie that will be exposed.Therefore, the truth of the matter was on the magic and coincidence of getting rich by lottery tickets.Well, although he was relieved, the door of envy, jealousy, and hatred could not be closed.Lu Chengyu walked to the door of the president\u2019s room, hesitant to knock on the door. He really missed the stock issue. Given his friendship with Yan Mu, he should have taken the initiative to tell the other party instead of waiting for the other party to discover it. If Yan Mu was a suspicious person, then even if the matter was cleared, there will be a knot in the other person\u2019s heart.He calculated everything and anticipated everything. The only thing he didn\u2019t consider was that he and Yan Mu, the boss, would become such close friends. There should not be too much suspicion in friendship, just like love, too much suspicion and doubt will only break the relationship and end up embarrassing both parties.However, how should he explain that after winning the lottery, why he would choose to make a desperate bet to buy Huading\u2019s stock? After all, at that time, no one was optimistic about Huading\u2019s stock. He was a fresh graduate student who finally won 20 million. He bought nothing but Huading\u2019s stock. This was too suspicious.If he told Yan Mu that he had a vision and believed that Huading will develop into a leading enterprise in the country, would the other party choose to believe him or suspect him?He wiped his face. Although Yan Mu might choose the second option no matter what he said, he still summoned the courage to raise his hand and prepare to knock on the door. Regardless of the outcome, he must make things clear, otherwise, his friendship with Yan Mu would seem too cheap.As a result, before his hand reached the door, the door opened from the inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After joining Huading, the other party always trusted him at work, and he also looked for opportunities to train his ability to work, but he never mentioned it. He didn\u2019t really forget this incident, but when confronted with Yan Mu and Cao Jingshen, he wanted to hide it for as long as possible. If he joined the company soon, and let Yan Mu and Cao Jingshen know that he had 3% of Huading\u2019s shares in his hands, perhaps this friendship would not be so close.But when things happened, he felt that he was not clever in this trick, and he even dared to do so by relying on others treating him as a friend. He walked up to Yan Mu, the corners of his mouth moved a few times, but he couldn\u2019t open the mouth.\u201cLiang Guoming came to the verdict in the first instance. He was sentenced to 13 years for several crimes.\u201d Yan Mu poured a glass of water for Lu Chengyu. \u201cThe court also sentenced him to pay your medical bills.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at the cup in his hand and saw that it was not a disposable paper cup, but a white ceramic cup printed with blue and white double stalks and inside was his favorite tea. Holding the teacup tightly, he sighed and said, \u201cBoss, the person who bought the Huading stock during the internal turmoil of Huading\u2026It was me.\u201dHe knew in his heart that if there was no Yan Mu to help behind, the first instance would not be judged. It was impossible for it to get down so soon, and the sentence still being so strict. With the financial resources of the Liang family, it was not difficult to get the sentence reduced. So, this time the sentence was so heavy, there must be some help behind it.Yan Mu took out two boxes of biscuits from the cupboard and put them on the table. He sat down on the other side of the sofa, looking at Lu Chengyu with a calm expression, as if he was saying, \u201cLet\u2019s talk, I\u2019m listening.\u201dLu Chengyu felt that what his narrative was suddenly not so strong. At this time, shouldn\u2019t Yan Mu look at him with disappointment and sadness? What was with biscuits and tea. Is this a tea party? The style of painting was seriously wrong, and he could hardly continue.The biscuits were the kind he usually liked to eat. The packaging had been opened by Yan Mu, but the biscuits inside were still full, and none of them had been moved.\u201cAt that time, I won the lottery, and there was a sum of money left by my parents,\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at the steam in the water glass. \u201cAt that time, I thought the stock price of Huading had dropped so low, and it was a bit weird. I studied economics. Knowing that there is a profit in it, I just gambled. After a few days after I bought a large number of scattered stocks, I found that other people were buying a lot of stocks, plus I didn\u2019t have much money left, so\u2026 I stopped.\u201dYan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu\u2019s hand tightly holding the water cup: \u201cHow much did you win?\u201d\u201cTwenty million,\u201d Lu Chengyu took a sip of water, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d This kind of concealing friend\u2019s business is really too heart-wrenching.\u201cIt\u2019s good to win the prize,\u201d Yan Mu got up and sat a little closer to Lu Chengyu. \u201cI didn\u2019t doubt you. You are willing to take the initiative to tell me. I am very happy.\u201dLu Chengyu raised his head and met Yan Mu\u2019s eyes. In his eyes, he did not see the slightest dissatisfaction and disappointment, but all tolerance and trust, as if the other party had never doubted him from beginning to end, nor was he dissatisfied because of his behavior.He felt as if his heart was pricked by something. It didn\u2019t hurt, but it was sour and swollen with a little bit of heat. This feeling even made him feel tight under his throat, and he couldn\u2019t say a word for a long time.\u201cAlthough I am the president of Huading, I will not easily doubt the important people around me.\u201d Yan Mu pulled out the cookie box and placed it where Lu Chengyu could reach it. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know what you were like in the past. But I believe you are not one to calculate me.\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s soreness in his heart became more and more obvious. He took another sip of tea before he said: \u201cWorking at Huading is my own choice. My boss and colleagues are my luck.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Yan Mu didn\u2019t want Lu Chengyu to be embarrassed. He got up and found a pile of information on his desk. \u201cNext week we are going to the following branch for inspection. I don\u2019t have time to read these reports. You go and do it.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and took the information, bending over to pick up the cookies on the table, \u201cBoss, you don\u2019t like to eat these, I\u2019ll help you eat them, so as not to waste it.\u201dYan Mu tensed. Nodding his head, after Lu Chengyu went out, he stretched out his hand to get the teacup that Lu Chengyu had drunk from.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Lu Chengyu opened the door suddenly and stuck his head in, \u201cMu Ge, thank you for your trust, I will not disappoint you.\u201d He glanced over the teacup in Yan Mu\u2019s hand and squinted his head with a smile. He took it back and closed the office door again.Yan Mu\u2019s curved back froze and stared at the office door for half a minute. After confirming that Lu Chengyu would not come back, he secretly took a sip from the teacup, and then put the teacup back in place with a serious face. As if the teacup was originally there, he didn\u2019t touch it at all.But he was a little excited because Lu Chengyu changed his name.The name Mu Ge\u2026 was also good.Cao Jingshen worried all afternoon. After work, he met Yan Mu in the parking lot. After thinking about it, he got close to the other side and glanced at the empty parking space next to the Maybach. Lu Chengyu\u2019s car was not there. It seemed that the person had already gone home. \u201cBoss, Xiao Lu is off work?\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Yan Mu nodded, and when he opened the door, he saw that Cao Jingshen didn\u2019t leave. He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNothing, I just asked if Xiao Lu was off work,\u201d Cao Jingshen said with a dry cough, since Yan Mu\u2019s expression was too difficult to distinguish, he had to say, \u201cThis kid ran too fast. The boss didn\u2019t leave. He ran first. The young man should have suffered more.\u201dYan Mu was silent. After a long while: \u201cI let him go first.\u201d The boss let Xiao Lu go first? Didn\u2019t you still say you believe in Xiao Lu at noon, why has it changed now?Cao Jingshen felt that the boss might have had a grudge against Xiao Lu. After thinking about it, he still didn\u2019t want someone like Lu Chengyu to leave Huading because of this incident: \u201cBoss, I think it\u2019s a coincidence. Didn\u2019t we inform them to come to the interview after careful screening? If Xiao Lu is really a spy for a hostile company, then he has failed too much in the past few months.\u201d\u201cWell, you make a lot of sense,\u201d Yan Mu nodded and said, \u201cSo, I asked him to go back to familiarize himself with the information of the branch earlier.\u201d\u201cYou decided to bring him to the branch inspection next week?\u201d Cao Jingshen pushed his glasses up his nose, \u201cI thought too much.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d Yan Mu got into the car and said, \u201cGo home early.\u201dCao Jingshen silently watched the Maybach drive out of the parking lot. He also thanked the other party for not blaming him.After Lu Chengyu returned home, he didn\u2019t have time to read the information of the branch, because as soon as he reached home and sat on the sofa, Song Junyan knocked on the door of his house.Lu Chengyu looked at Song Junyan, who was standing outside the door and looked to be hesitant to say something, and asked with a polite smile: \u201cIs there anything wrong with Mr. Song?\u201d\u201cAfter thinking about it, I think there are some things that I need to tell you. Do you have time?\u201d He smiled and asked, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have time, we\u2019ll talk about it next time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just about to go out to eat, wait for me,\u201d Lu Chengyu turned and entered the house, quickly took the wallet, mobile phone, and car key, and then changed his shoes, closed the door and asked, \u201cWhat does Mr. Song like to eat?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t be so stupid as to invite Song Junyan into his house. Who knows if the other party will do anything?Song Junyan glanced at the closed door, and thought about it seriously, \u201cWest Street opened a western restaurant with a good environment. Let\u2019s try it.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLu Chengyu did not refuse. He did not take the initiative to mention that he was driving, and finally sat down in Song Junyan\u2019s car. He pretended to look at the car unintentionally, \u201cMr. Song\u2019s car is good.\u201d\u201cIs it?\u201d Song Junyan\u2019s smile didn\u2019t reach the bottom of his eyes. It was a popular model worth less than a million, compared to Yan Mu\u2019s car which was worth more than tens of millions, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cI am driving a small Pentium worth less than 100,000 yuan like a baby,\u201d Lu Chengyu said of the car, feeling a little bit envious at the moment, \u201cThe boss\u2019s car is the coolest, even the lights are better than my car. It\u2019s valuable.\u201d\u201cOf course, he can drive such a good car, huh,\u201d Song Junyan sneered. \u201cThe people of the Yan family don\u2019t know how much blood they have on their hands for the money.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at Song Junyan with a puzzled expression, \u201cBoss, although he is a little serious, he is pretty good.\u201dSong Junyan shook the back of the steering wheel\u2019s hands and said with disdain, \u201cIt\u2019s all superficial work. Mr. Lu, you are a good person, and I don\u2019t want you to fall into the quagmire of the Yan family. That\u2019s why I want to tell you something.\u201dSeeing Lu Chengyu\u2019s expression becoming suspicious, Song Junyan stopped talking. After the car was parked near the western restaurant, he gently said to Lu Chengyu, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, if I am there, they will not dare to calculate you too much.\u201dLu Chengyu followed him into the restaurant. After the two ordered a meal, Lu Chengyu hesitated and said softly: \u201cI don\u2019t understand, even if there is something among them, it shouldn\u2019t involve me. Also, why don\u2019t they dare to calculate me with you?\u201d This person should really inquire about the lesson learned by Yan Lao San some time ago. Not only did he lose his position at Huading, but he was also arrested for a while.He remembered that on the day of Lu Dong\u2019s wedding, the third wife Yan was arrested. Some time ago, due to a medical problem, his wife spent a lot of money to send him out. Although this one still wanted to make trouble with Yan Mu, he was so timid, he didn\u2019t dare to come to Huading to make trouble.Song Junyan was now replacing Yan Lao San to challenge Yan Mu\u2019s bottom line. Where did his confidence come from?Lu Chengyu was not the type of person who liked Western food, but he still knew the etiquette of Western food, so he maintained his own style very well. In front of outsiders, he had always tried his best not to show timidity.Looking at Lu Chengyu\u2019s standard dining posture, Song Junyan smiled at Lu Chengyu and said, \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know, Yan Mu and I are actually biological brothers.\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at him in surprise: \u201cBrothers?\u201d\u201cMy mother fell in love with my dad back then, and after she was with him, she got pregnant with me, she knew that my dad already had a wife and a son,\u201d Song Junyan sighed, \u201cMy mom didn\u2019t want to be a third party to destroy the family, but she didn\u2019t want to give up the life in her stomach and was preparing to go away, my dad found out about the matter and started to quarrel with her, so it spread to Aunt Mu\u2019s ears.\u201d\u201cLater, my mother lost her job, and my grandparents were threatened, even after I was born, someone was going to take me away from my mother,\u201d Song Junyan said in a low voice, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my dad to protect us, maybe we\u2026\u201d\u201cAunt Mu used all means to frame us mother and child. Before she died of illness, she used Mu family\u2019s power and threatened my father not to marry my mother. We mother and son have suffered so much during these years. When my father died, Yan Mu even refused to let us attend the funeral. He even threatened us, saying that if my mother and I dared to peep on Yan Family\u2019s property, he will kill us\u2026\u201dLu Chengyu was slicing steak while listening to Song Junyan\u2019s history of persecution by Yan Mu and his mother against this mother-son duo. It was simply sad and tearful for those who heard it. In Song Junyan\u2019s story, Song Junyan\u2019s mother and son were strong while still being lonely and helpless, and Yan Mu and his mother were the evil villains, who were wicked and only knew how to attract hatred.If Yan Mu and his mother were really like Song Junyan said, Song Junyan and his mother should have been killed long ago, also where did the money to buy Liang company\u2019s stocks, drive a car worth a million, and buy a house at will would have come.\u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with him for something, but why doesn\u2019t he want to let us go,\u201d Song Junyan took a sip of red wine and said proudly, \u201cI am doing well now. I don\u2019t need anything from their Yan family at all!\u201dLu Chengyu cooperated. With a shocked expression, he continued to eat.After eating almost the complete meal, Lu Chengyu finally listened to Song Junyan\u2019s story. He looked at Song Junyan\u2019s slightly angry face and said with emotion, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to have such a story behind you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not telling you this for anything, but I just want you to see exactly what kind of person Yan Mu is.\u201d Song Junyan hesitated, \u201cAfter all, you are his assistant now. You should pay more attention to it when you work.\u201d\u201cI understand,\u201d Lu Chengyu nodded solemnly, and suddenly stood up and said, \u201cI have something to attend to.\u201dSong Junyan stood up and said comfortingly, \u201cNo matter what happens, I am willing to help you.\u201dIf he was not mistaken, the things on the Internet should have been passed on to the people of the Yan family. He did not believe that the Yan family would let these rumors continue.\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu gave Song Junyan a grateful look, and hurried out of the western restaurant door, reached for a taxi around the corner, and reported Yan Mu\u2019s address.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu Chengyu took out his mobile phone and called Yan Mu. After confirming that the other party was at home, so he was relieved.After Yan Mu hung up the phone, he looked at the two friends who were playing games with him, and said, \u201cXiao Lu will come here later.\u201dZhuang Yu would come as soon as he wanted to, but the next moment he suddenly remembered that it was night. Now\u2026Zhang Zeyun put down the gamepad and glanced at the time: \u201cI\u2019m going home to sleep.\u201d He stood up, picked up the coat on the sofa, and said to Yan Mu, \u201cBrother Mu, don\u2019t let this chance go.\u201dYan Mu glanced at him and said nothing.\u201cIf you let this opportunity pass, you can only say that your emotional intelligence is negative,\u201d Zhuang Yu stood up, reached out, and patted Yan Mu on the shoulder, \u201cI won\u2019t stay here to be a light bulb.\u201dYan Mu sent his two friends to the door, stood outside and looked in the direction of the gate of the community for a while. He suddenly remembered the living room was messed up by his friends, and hurriedly went back to clean the living room and wash the fruits, striving for the living room to be neat and tidy when Lu Chengyu came\u2026The taxi stopped outside the complex. Lu Chengyu reported his name to the guard, and he only let him in after the guard confirmed his visit from Yan Mu.The doorway to Yan Mu\u2019s villa was some distance away, Lu Chengyu was not in a hurry, and walked forward unhurriedly. After a short walk, he saw a familiar figure in front of him.Under the orange light, Yan Mu\u2019s figure looked a little fuzzy, and his steps were steady. Lu Chengyu couldn\u2019t help stopping, standing under the streetlamp, watching him step by step come towards him. He blinked and said with a smile, \u201cBrother Mu is here to pick me up, right?\u201dYan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu who was smiling, walked to him, and then walked side by side with him: \u201cThere are a lot of houses here. You drove here the first two times. I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to find the way by yourself.\u201dThis reason was not clever at all. Lu Chengyu gave him a stern glance, \u201cMu Ge, you are too careful, I drive so fast. You can find the way fast, how can you not know the way when you walk?\u201dYan Mu gave a dry cough, and then nodded: \u201cOh.\u201dLu Chengyu felt that he could hear a little bit of grievance from the word and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cHowever, thank you for coming out to pick me up, otherwise it would be boring for me to walk by myself.\u201dFrom time to time, a car drove by them, and a babysitter pushing a stroller passed by. Lu Chengyu looked up and saw a pair holding hands. The elderly couple came over from the opposite side. Although the two of them had gray hair and their feet were squatting, they could see the world hand in hand and depend on each other.Finding that Lu Chengyu was paying attention to the old couple in front of him, Yan Mu leaned in the direction of Lu Chengyu. The distance of half an arm became the distance of a fist. \u201cThere are many people in this community who have contributed to the country. Now they are old. When I get older, I will stay in the elder home here.\u201dLu Chengyu took his gaze back from the two of them: \u201cThe living environment here is good.\u201d In the golden capital city, this community still had so many green belts and land for public facilities. It could be seen that the construction of this community was not a small cost.When the couple approached, they recognized Yan Mu and greeted Yan Mu with a kind smile. Yan Mu respectfully greeted them before moving on with Lu Chengyu.Lu Chengyu looked back at the couple and saw that although they were wearing ordinary clothes, they gave people an intellectual taste. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cAren\u2019t there many experts living in this community?\u201d\u201cWhat is an expert?\u201d Yan Mu glanced at the couple. \u201cThey used to be a part of national scientific research institution. Although they are now retired, they often participate in scientific research projects.\u201d\u201cVery powerful,\u201d Lu Chengyu said with emotion. These people were the backbone of their empire.Yan Mu nodded, and after walking for a while, the two finally reached home. He found a pair of soft slippers for Lu Chengyu to put on and asked, \u201cHave you had dinner?\u201d\u201cI ate a little bit, but I\u2019m not full,\u201d Lu Chengyu remembered what Song Junyan said, sighed, and took out the phone to bring up the audio that was secretly recorded during the meal. \u201cSong Junyan, although it\u2019s difficult to make it to the lobby, if you don\u2019t deal with it, I\u2019m afraid that he will only create trouble.\u201dHe pressed the play button and asked Yan Mu to listen to the story told by the illegitimate son. It was both sad and lively, desolate and inspirational. If it weren\u2019t for the close relationship between Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu, unlike ordinary bosses and employees, then the story told by Song Junyan would be very believable.After the audio was played, Yan Mu was silent for a while under Lu Chengyu\u2019s sight, and finally said: \u201cYou are not full, do you want to eat a bowl of noodles, I didn\u2019t eat much during dinner.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Lu Chengyu thought about Song Junyan and felt that he had nothing to do. Also, he felt that it was too shameless of him to run over and eat a bowl of noodles.Soon after two bowls of tomato egg noodles came out, Lu Chengyu was eating the noodles while saying: \u201cIt seems that Song Junyan\u2019s purpose of approaching me is to provoke the relationship between us. Does he think that as long as the two of us have conflicts, I will stand on his side?\u201dYan Mu shook his head, saying that he didn\u2019t quite understand Song Junyan\u2019s thoughts.\u201cSong Junyan is too far behind you.\u201d Lu Chengyu took a sip of the noodle soup, and the sour and fragrant taste made him drink two more sips. \u201cHis method is more suitable for ancient inner palace[1], provided that he changed and became a woman.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgYan Mu knew that Lu Chengyu was saying that Song Junyan could not be on the stage, but because of Song Junyan\u2019s relationship with him, he turned his words around and said it jokingly.Yan Mu said, \u201cI only met him a few times when I was young. When I first saw him, he himself rolled down the stairs.\u201d\u201cThen said you pushed him?\u201d Lu Chengyu felt that Song Junyan\u2019s personality was still a good thing. It was really possible to use this method that had appeared in the inner palace TV series.Yan Mu nodded: \u201cHe thought his father would criticize me, but he was sent out of the Yan\u2019s family home.\u201dFor him, he would never consider this kind of method of hurting the enemy by one thousand by taking eight hundred damage. He was the grandson of the Mu family. If he didn\u2019t want to see anyone; he just needed to say a word.As for him pushing Song Junyan?Not to mention that the Mu family did not believe it, even the Yan family did not believe it. Who would believe the words of an illegitimate child and doubt a successor who has performed well since childhood?The reason why the Yan family sent Song Junyan away was because of his mind, misconduct, and lack of education. Wouldn\u2019t it be more terrifying to lie and frame children at such a young age?Although Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t quite understand the kindness and grievances in the wealthy family, he knew in his heart that the Yan family didn\u2019t like Song Junyan\u2019s behavior, so he was sent away.But Song Junyan\u2019s mother should be a woman with a lot of thoughts, otherwise, why did she deliberately add the word \u2018Yan\u2019 to his name. He couldn\u2019t bear the Yan family\u2019s surname, but still insisted on having a relationship with the Yan family. To say that she didn\u2019t even think about it, he didn\u2019t believe it anyway.But despite this, Song Junyan\u2019s life seemed to be very moist. This may be Yan\u2019s father\u2019s handwriting. As an outsider, Lu Chengyu naturally found it hard to mention this kind of thing. \u201cProbably because he was not accepted by the Yan family back then, so he is now thinking about dealing with the Yan family.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Yan Mu said, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this.\u201dLu Chengyu felt that Yan Mu\u2019s tone was like buying a cabbage. Such a relaxed tone made him feel a little bit too solemn.After eating the noodles, Yan Mu said, \u201cIt\u2019s so late, don\u2019t go back tonight.\u201dLu Chengyu glanced at the wall clock on the wall. It was three o\u2019clock past nine, is it very late?He withdrew his gaze silently, and then nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201d Perhaps it was because Yan Mu\u2019s eyes were too serious as if he would be sad if he refused. So, he couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cYou can watch TV by yourself, I\u2019ll go upstairs to clean up,\u201d Yan Mu handed the remote control to Lu Chengyu, turned upstairs, and prepared to go to the guest room to get a new set of bedding.Seeing that Yan Mu had already gone upstairs, Lu Chengyu turned on the TV, just in time to see the male protagonist scrambling in front of his crush.He reached out and touched his chin, then looked back upstairs again, his eyes stained with complexity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The weird background music and the host\u2019s mysterious way of explanation made it really a bit of a spooky show.\u201cLike this show?\u201d Yan Mu rarely watched TV. For him, the decoration function of the TV at home was far greater than the practical function. Glancing at the TV screen, the show seemed to be saying that all kinds of weird figures can be seen on the walls of a certain house.\u201cI just think the director of this show is a talent.\u201d Lu Chengyu cut the fruit into small pieces and put it on the coffee table on a fruit plate. After Yan Mu sat down, he moved the fruit plate in Yan Mu\u2019s direction. \u201cEvery little thing can be edited by him, and he can be extremely savage when he reveals the truth.\u201d While moving the fruits to Yan Mu, he clearly noticed that Yan Mu\u2019s eyes fell on the back of his hand. Although it was not so obvious, but for Lu Chengyu, it was clear that the other party was secretly looking at him.\u201cIn fact, this approach can make people more confident that there are not so many so-called supernatural events in the world,\u201d Yan Mu with a toothpick to poke into an apple, ate a few mouthfuls with a straight face, \u201cand the theme is very apt.\u201d\u201cYou make it sound like it makes sense.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, leaning on the soft and comfortable sofa, the actual rebirth of his own was a supernatural event. Such a legendary experience, after speaking out, no one else would believe it, and would only advise him not to stop the medicine and would also blame his attending doctor for letting him out[1].The two leaned on the sofa and watched TV for a while until the truth was revealed. It turned out that there was a hole in the wall of this house, and there was a hole in the nearby house, so a weird figure was formed.Appearing to be shocked by the end of this wonderful work, Yan Mu said after a long silence: \u201cIt\u2019s really not easy to make a TV show now.\u201d Seeing Lu Chengyu who looked vigorous his peach blossom eyes stained with a smile, and he thought in a daze that these eyes were really incredible.Lu Chengyu smiled and turned his head, and found Yan Mu staring at him, with a puzzled expression on his face: \u201cBoss?\u201dYan Mu slowly retracted his gaze and poked a piece of apple with a toothpick to Lu Chengyu: \u201cIt looks good.\u201dYan Mu didn\u2019t say whether the TV was good, or the person was good. Yan Mu didn\u2019t say, and Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t ask. Leaning on the sofa, he said, \u201cBrother Mu, you live in such a big house, and it must usually too difficult to clean up.\u201d\u201cThere are workers to clean up on time every week. It\u2019s not troublesome.\u201d Yan Mu looked out the window, outside was the villa garden, but he was not interested in planting flowers and plants, so he let the decoration company turn it into a lawn. \u201cI live alone, and the house is not easy to be messed up.\u201dHearing this, Lu Chengyu remembered his own house, even though he used it every week. He also had a part-time worker but his house was still messed up, he coughed, \u201cHaha, that\u2019s right.\u201d He glanced at the small garden outside with some envy, \u201cBut it\u2019s nice to have your own garden outside. Wait until the film is fully funded. After sorting it out, I will also buy a house with a garden and maintain it. Even if I can\u2019t live in it, I can enjoy it by putting it there.\u201dAfter saying this, Lu Chengyu instantly felt that he was embarrassed. Saying buying a house was like buying vegetables, this feeling really had a faint sense of boldness. He seemed to understand the cool mood of local tyrants when they keep saying \u201cbuy, buy, buy\u201d when they faced various famous brands.\u201cBrother Mu, if I buy a villa from our own company, will there be an internal price?\u201d After the trench, Lu Chengyu wisely pulled back his extravagant nerves. \u201cI heard that our real estate company under Huading is developing a neighborhood nearby, if I buy a set, it will be cheaper for me.\u201d\u201cIf you like it, I will give you a set,\u201d Yan Mu hooked up his mouth. \u201cIn the newly developed community, there is a set of my house, anyway, it\u2019s useless for it to be empty.\u201d\u201cWould you be so generous?\u201d Lu Chengyu blinked, trying to keep himself from being dazzled by Yan Mu\u2019s smile, and squinted, \u201cActually, I prefer the environment around this house.\u201d He pointed to the top of his head, then pinched his ears and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t give me this house too, right?\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Yan Mu nodded, then frowned, \u201cIt\u2019s just that the transfer procedures in this community are not easy to handle. The transferee must undergo strict verification, and it will take at least half a year to complete the formalities.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu in silence for a few seconds, then looked away and sighed: \u201cBoss, do you think I am someone who loves petty and cheap things?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d Yan Mu\u2019s expression changed slightly, and he explained, \u201cI just thought you liked it, but it didn\u2019t mean to look down on you. Otherwise, I will sell you the house at the internal price of the company.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu\u2019s explanation, chuckled, laughed for half a minute, and stretched out his hand. He patted his shoulder: \u201cI\u2019m kidding you; I know how you are, how can you believe it.\u201d He stood up, looked at the wall clock on the wall, \u201cIt\u2019s already ten o\u2019clock, and I want to sleep. Where is the guest room?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take you up.\u201d Yan Mu saw that Lu Chengyu was not angry, he sighed in relief, took him upstairs, pushed the room door open, which was next to the master bedroom, turned on the light in the room, the room had been cleaned up. It was neat and tidy, and the entire bedding was warm orange. The quilt was fluffy and soft, and it looked extra warm, which could make people feel that it must be very comfortable to lie on.\u201cThere is a bathroom in the room. You should rest early. I won\u2019t disturb you.\u201d Yan Mu exited the door, looking at Lu Chengyu inside the room, and couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything else just now.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Lu Chengyu leaned against the door frame with a smile and looked at the tall man in front of him. He said softly, \u201cI\u2019m not angry. Also, I actually like to pick cheap ones, but I know what to take and what not to take, good night.\u201d\u201cGood night.\u201d Yan Mu stepped back, watching the door closed, touching the right shoulder that Lu Chengyu had just touched downstairs, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, and turned back to his room.After closing the door, Lu Chengyu looked at the room carefully. The furnishings in the room were very attentive, not like a guest room, but specially equipped for the members of the family. There was also a multifunctional charger on the bedside, which was obviously because Yan Mu considered the possibility of him charging his mobile phone when it was out of power.On the bed was a set of bathrobes, a change of coat, and even a pair of clean underwear/pants. Sitting on the soft bed, he remembered Yan Mu\u2019s attitude to him these days. Even if Lu Chengyu thought he was not a passionate person, he felt that Yan Mu\u2019s attitude towards him was not like brothers, but like\u2026Taking the bathrobe and clean underwear, he walked into the bathroom and turned on the shower. Lu Chengyu took off his clothes. He looked at the mirror gradually through the mist and his figure became blurred, and then he gave a soft smile.Warm water flowed all over the body along the tips of his hair, and he suddenly remembered the people and things he had encountered in his previous life, men and women, separated and combined, there was happiness and pain. But even if he was entangled, it would be considered vigorous anyway, but unfortunately, he didn\u2019t meet a person who was right for his heart, and he was a bachelor to death. Thinking about it, there was really such a touch of sadness.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgAfter taking shower, he wiped the water droplets on his body and wiped off the mist on the mirror. Although his skin in the mirror was white, but it was not like a weak white chicken, he had a lot of muscles, otherwise what would he use to beat people.He took the bathrobe and put it on, wiped his hair and walked out of the bathroom. He heard a knock on the door outside. Lu Chengyu opened the door and saw Yan Mu standing at the door with a glass of milk in his hand.Yan Mu glanced over the tips of Lu Chengyu\u2019s hair dripping with water, and then his eyes landed on Lu Chengyu\u2019s beautiful collarbone and Adam\u2019s apple. After a slight shock, he quickly looked away and said: \u201cDrinking a glass of milk at night improves the quality of sleep.\u201d Thank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu took the milk, smiled and took a step back, \u201cCome in and sit?\u201dThe bathrobe with the waistband not tight enough showed his slender and powerful legs, and Yan Mu could even see the faintly exposed thigh roots under Lu Chengyu\u2019s bathrobe. At the base of his thigh, he shook his head: \u201cNo, go to bed earlier.\u201d\u201cOkay, good night.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and waited for Yan Mu to walk away before closing the door, drinking a mouthful of fragrant milk, Lu Chengyu revealed a faint expression and a smile.Early the next morning, Lu Chengyu went to the company with Yan Mu. He wore the jacket that Yan Mu had prepared for him, but the unexpected fit seemed to be tailor-made for him.Probably because the two people got along too naturally after the online rumors came out, and how they used to be and how they are now. No one in the company took those online remarks to heart. Therefore, even if they saw Lu Chengyu coming to work in the boss\u2019s car, no one would think in that direction.Think about it too. Although some people on the Internet like to brainstorm some two-dimensional characters, most people didn\u2019t take it seriously, let alone make random guesses about people in their lives. After all, in reality, the same-sex repulsion is still the mainstream.When Lu Chengyu went to the secretarial department to get the information, Cao Jingshen complained to him: \u201cWell, I\u2019m worrying about you and am at a loss. As a result, you and the boss are doing well, making me like a second person.\u201d\u201cBrother Cao, you are a good person, a good guy.\u201d Lu Chengyu chuckled at Cao Jingshen, \u201cI know you are worried about me, and I remember your kindness.\u201d\u201cTake your good guy card and get out.\u201d Cao Jingshen pushed his glasses and threw a thick pile of documents in his hands. \u201cThe boss has to go out today. You have to deal with these things yourself.\u201d\u201cSo much.\u201d Lu Chengyu finished speaking. He looked up to see Cao Jingshen\u2019s annoyed face, and said with a hurried smile, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it right away. Brother Cao, I\u2019m going back to the office, call me if you have something me.\u201d\u201cGo away,\u201d Cao Jingshen stopped looking at him, lowered his head in the office and began to write swiftly.Lu Chengyu rolled away neatly, and returned to the office to open these documents, and they turned out to be the investigation documents of some general managers and senior executives of various branches. These were not the information on the company\u2019s face, but Cao Jingshen\u2019s own summary and processing. Cao Jingshen shared this information with him, because he really regarded him as his own.\u201cKnife mouth tofu heart[2],\u201d Lu Chengyu muttered and began to look carefully.[1]\u00a0Think that he was mad.[2]\u00a0Bitter mouth but a soft heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But there was soft piano music being played, and in this quiet atmosphere, there was a kind of weirdness that couldn\u2019t be said.Song Junyan looked at the half-brother in front of him with sweat on his face. He obviously didn\u2019t say a word, but he didn\u2019t even have the courage to speak, as if Yan Mu would kill him at any time as and when he spoke.He glanced at the two silent bodyguards behind the man, and it took a long while to summon up the courage to say, \u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201dYan Mu took a sip of coffee slowly, and calmly looked at Song Junyan\u2019s nervous and scared appearance, raised his left index finger, and a bodyguard behind him put a pile of investigation material in front of Song Junyan\u2019s eyes.Song Junyan took a look at the material and found that these were all records of his large and small things over the years, and there was even a timetable of whom he had contacted. These things were so clear as if there was an invisible person by his side at all times, and he was terrified and powerless to resist.\u201cYou\u2026what on earth do you want to do?\u201d Song Junyan almost squeezed the thing in his unstable hand, obviously it was just a stack of paper, but he felt like he was holding a time bomb.\u201cIsn\u2019t it what you want to do?\u201d Yan Mu put down the coffee cup and looked at Song Junyan blankly. \u201cThe bastard should live a good life. I didn\u2019t care about you before because I was too lazy to manage it, not because I couldn\u2019t manage it.\u201d\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not reconciled!\u201d Song Junyan was irritated by Yan Mu\u2019s dismissive eyes. He threw the materials on the table heavily, knocked over the coffee cup in front of him, and the coffee splashed on the materials, like a paste of ugly mud, the table was full of mess.Song Junyan\u2019s actions were like a breeze blowing in Yan Mu\u2019s eyes. He didn\u2019t even blink his eyes, but just picked up the coffee, raised his eyelids, and said in a declarative tone: \u201cIt\u2019s your own business to be willing or unwilling. But if you continue to make trouble, it will be my business.\u201d\u201cDo you want to threaten me?\u201d Song Junyan stood up, looked down at Yan Mu, and sneered, \u201cEven if you dislike me and look down on me, what a pity. You just shed the same blood as me. Even if you kill me, you can\u2019t erase this fact!\u201d\u201cExperts have said that thinking too much has an impact on IQ. My blood type is AB, and your blood type is O,\u201d Yan Mu felt that he had to let the other party recognize the fact, \u201cYou follow your mother, I follow my mother, our blood types are all different.\u201dSong Junyan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are the grandson of the Mu family, the eldest grandson of the Yan family, and the heir of Huading. You always have such an expressionless and lofty appearance,\u201d Song Junyan roared, \u201cbut why should I live worse than you? I am also a descendant of the Yan family, and I am also the son of my father. My father loves my mother and me, not you!\u201dYan Mu moved his eyebrows and his expression remained unchanged. Obviously, Song Junyan\u2019s words did not enter his ears at all.\u201cWhy do you sit on the whole Yan family, if not for you and your mother, my mother would have married my father, I would not have grown up as a wild species[1], I would have been surnamed Yan! Not Song!\u201dYan Mu threw the heap of the messy materials, he found out a bunch of things that Song Junyan did illegally: \u201cI said, I don\u2019t care what you do, but don\u2019t get caught up in my business.\u201d He thought about it, and added, \u201cYou love the last name. Whatever your surname is, if you go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to change it, no one will stop you. You are not my illegitimate child, whether you are scolded or looked down upon, what does it have to do with me? \u201cThere was no threat in Yan Mu\u2019s eyes. There was no anger, or even any emotions, but Song Junyan felt a chill on his back, because he knew that Yan Mu\u2019s words were serious, so serious that they didn\u2019t mean anything threatening.Song Junyan stood there blankly and didn\u2019t hold back what he originally wanted to complain about. Despite his hatred, he couldn\u2019t say it.\u201cI don\u2019t like people who are dishonest.\u201d Yan Mu put the coffee cup on the pile of clean materials, \u201cI have tolerated you for more than ten years ago. There is no second time.\u201dStanding up, Yan Mu took the bow tie: \u201cI am not very tolerant of people, I don\u2019t like, so you can decide it yourself.\u201dSong Junyan watched Yan Mu walk out of the coffee shop with the two bodyguards, and he kicked the chair in anger as he watched the coffee scattered on the table. He kicked the table and listened to the sound of the coffee cup breaking, he hated it and was annoyed, but he was helpless.The other party didn\u2019t say anything threatening to him at all, and he didn\u2019t even utter a dirty word, but he was scared and timid. People didn\u2019t even bother to look at him. It only took a word from him to decide his life or death. What does he use to fight against the other?There was another scene like this in front of him more than ten years ago. He deliberately fell down the stairs. Yan Mu stood on the stairs like that, with his back straight and a cold expression. There was no disdain or any other emotion in his eyes. At that time, he still didn\u2019t understand what it was, but he hated the way Yan Mu looked at him.Now, he understood what that look meant. It turned out that the other party didn\u2019t put him in his eyes at all. Who would look at the pebbles on the side of the road?\u201cMr. Song\u2019s family mother and son, do I need to do anything more?\u201d After Yan Mu got into the car, the driver in a suit lowered his voice, \u201cI\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t be reconciled.\u201d\u201cNo need,\u201d Yan Mu looked back. When he glanced at the coffee shop, Song Junyan was burying his head in picking up those materials. \u201cThey are not stupid people.\u201d The mother and son duo want nothing more than money. Knowing that if they continue to make trouble, they will not only have no money, but even have no freedom. It\u2019s too late.After the car drove a certain distance, Yan Mu suddenly said: \u201cTell them to leave the capital before 6 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. If they don\u2019t want to leave, they don\u2019t have to leave in this life.\u201d People like Song Junyan should not stay with Xiao Lu and be a neighbor.\u201cYes,\u201d the driver in the suit nodded, and the bodyguard in the co-pilot seat took out his mobile phone and arranged the matter.At two or three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Lu Chengyu was processing several documents and preparing to put them in the president\u2019s office. When he went out, he saw Yan Mu coming back from outside. He smiled and said, \u201cBrother Mu, you finally came back. There are two copies here. The documents you need to sign urgently.\u201dYan Mu took the documents in his hand, and after flipping through them, he took out a few strokes and signed them, \u201cYou can ask them to come up and get them.\u201d\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll take it to the secretary department and let them fax it.\u201d Lu Chengyu twisted his neck, \u201cI need to move around anyway.\u201dYan Mu saw that Lu Chengyu seemed a little tired, and said: \u201cWell, you should pay attention to your body.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Lu Chengyu waved his hand, and yawned after entering the elevator. Although Yan Mu went out for a day today, as an assistant he would not be stupid enough to ask these things. However, he saw that Yan Mu\u2019s expression was not unusual when he returned, and there should be nothing serious about it.As soon as he gave the information to the person in the secretarial department, before he turned his head and took a few steps, he met the manager of the personnel department, remembering that his internship contract was still in this person\u2019s hand, he laughed at the moment: \u201cManager Du has something to do. Looking for Secretary-General Cao?\u201d\u201cI need a form,\u201d Du Peng said with a smile after seeing that Lu Chengyu was interrogating, \u201cAssistant Lu, why did you come?\u201d\u201cI had to help the boss get something.\u201d Lu Chengyu know that Du Peng was a bit of a horror, but he was good at his job, and he was somewhat skilled, so he was still polite to him, \u201cManager Du is busy, so I won\u2019t bother.\u201d\u201cNot busy,\u201d Du Peng touched his head without much hair. \u201cAssistant Lu is the real busy person.\u201dLu Chengyu and Du Peng were very polite. After entering the elevator, he could still see Du Peng smiled and looked at himself.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cManager, hasn\u2019t he just been in the company for half a year, why does the boss trust him so much?\u201d The staff behind Du Peng were a little bit afraid to talk. \u201cThe female staff of our company were blushing when they mentioned him. I really don\u2019t know. What\u2019s crazy things are happening?\u201d\u201cYou guy know this shit.\u201d Du Peng looked around and found that no one in the aisle heard the clerk\u2019s words, then lowered his voice, \u201cThis person is not simple, that\u2019s ability!\u201d He gave his thumbs up, \u201cKnow it?\u201dThe staff nodded, but he felt a little emotional. In a short period of time, Assistant Lu was able to let so many people in the company recognize his ability. In that case, he had been in the company for more than a year, and his development was fairly good, but compared to others, he was almost a scumbag.In the afternoon, Lu Chengyu took a taxi home. As soon as he walked to the door, he was stopped by Uncle Liu, \u201cMr. Lu, the Mr. Song upstairs has moved away.\u201d\u201cMoved away?\u201d Lu Chengyu raised his eyebrows unexpectedly. Song Junyan only provoked the relationship between him and Yan Mu last night. The other party hadn\u2019t seen the result, so why leave, \u201cWhen did he leave?\u201d\u201cToday, as soon as he came back in noon, he packed up his things in a hurry and left. In the afternoon, the moving company emptied all the furniture inside,\u201d Uncle Liu frowned. \u201cThat way, it seems like he was in a hurry to escape. Mr. Lu, don\u2019t you think he was a very strange person?\u201d\u201cWhoever he is, we can be rest assured now that he moved away.\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed under Uncle Liu\u2019s expectant eyes, \u201cLast time you told me about his behavior, I\u2019ve been worried all the time, but fortunately, he has moved out now.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Uncle Liu smiled honestly and proudly, \u201cI said he is not a good person, and if he walks in such a hurry now, he must have offended someone. And had to take refuge and leave.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded and said goodbye to Uncle Liu and went home.When he got home, he sat on the sofa for a while, gnawed on a pear, then slowly stood up and fumbled around the doorway, and finally found two bugs smaller than fingernails from under the shoe cabinet.Looking at the two bugs in his palm, Lu Chengyu smiled. This must have been thrown into the shoe cabinet by Song Junyan when he turned around and took the car key and wallet yesterday afternoon. He must know that the shoe cabinet was opened by Song Junyan at that time.After tapping on the two bugs, Lu Chengyu walked to the bathroom, threw the bug into the toilet, flushed them with water, and smiled as he watched the two little things being washed into the sewer.In a certain room, the person in charge of monitoring was stimulated by the loud sound and took off the earphones. After rubbing his ears and putting on the earphones, he found that he couldn\u2019t hear anything. His face changed and he hurriedly took out his mobile phone to contact his employer: \u201cMr. Song, the bug was discovered by the other party.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d He put down the phone, and after some thought, he said to the assistant next to him, \u201cGuys, let\u2019s hurry up and finish the work.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t we monitoring?\u201d The assistant looked at his head in confusion, \u201cDid you found anything useful yet?\u201d\u201cFollow him, since the employer has spoken, we can just take the money and act accordingly.\u201d He glanced at the earphones, which had no sound. \u201cOrder to pack things and change places, so as not to make commotion.\u201dWhen the assistants heard the words, they all got up and followed to collect the things. As a result, the door of the room was kicked open before the few people had time to go out. Then they saw a group of police officers holding guns rushing in. Before they could respond, they were pushed to the ground by these police officers.The head policemen looked at the monitoring equipment in the room and said with a serious expression: \u201cYou have everything; do you want to be a spy?\u201d He glanced at the two people who were handcuffed, \u201cIt seems that you are also veterans. These things are illegal? Take it away!\u201dAfter these people were taken away, their mouths were quite strict, and it took a lot of effort for the police to ask who was behind them. It was a pity that this Mr. Song had already fled abroad with the money, so they had to hand the matter over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hoping that the country that accepted Song Junyan would send him back to the country.As for Song Junyan\u2019s domestic accounts, they were naturally frozen, and his part of Liang\u2019s shares were also dealt with by the authorities. In this life, Song Junyan would not want to return to China unless he had a facelift and changed his status. This was still on the premise that Yan Mu hadn\u2019t noticed his actions.Song Junyan hired these people to monitor not only Lu Chengyu, but also some major shareholders of the Liang family and Liang Deyou, the new president. So, when the incident came out, the Liang family, who had been relieved, went into chaos again. Many major shareholders began to accuse Liang Deyou of finding this kind of partner for Liang, without the vision and ability of a leader, which caused Liang\u2019s to fall into the quagmire of an eternal disaster.After the media heard the news, they exaggerated the matter even more. The atmosphere was such that everyone was happy except for the Liang\u2019s. As for the official mention that a certain employee of Huading was also monitored by Song Junyan, it was only taken over by the media. After all, people want to see rich jokes rather than commercial competition.After the incident was revealed, Lu Chengyu was very surprised. He did not expect that Song Junyan was so big that he wanted to attack the Liang family. It was a pity that this was not very lucky. He didn\u2019t get the things, but he was unlucky.Could it be that Song Junyan was anxious to move out because of this incident? He looked at some jokes on the Internet that laughed at the Liang family, and the official website about Song Junyan\u2019s wanted order, and he was suspicious. It didn\u2019t seem to be that simple. Although Song Junyan\u2019s methods were not clever, he would not be so stupid as to be easily spotted by the police unless someone behind him is rectifying him.Somehow, he suddenly remembered that Yan Mu had said not long ago said that he would deal with Song Junyan\u2019s case. Could this matter be Yan Mu\u2019s handwriting?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 45.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45.1Song Junyan\u2019s affairs were a joke in the circle. Everyone knew that he was the illegitimate son of the Yan family. He had a lot of ambition. He wanted to be the master of the Yan family, and he didn\u2019t want to care about Yan Mu\u2019s identity, then what was his identity?However, not many people thought that this matter was done by Yan Mu. After all, the exposure of this kind of matter was also a scandal of the Yan family. It was okay to know about things like illegitimate children. Although there was no shortage of such things in the circle, it was ugly to publicise it. A wealthy family like the Yan family valued face the most, and how could they be willing to lose it for such a person. As the president of Huading, Yan Mu could clean up an illegitimate child and kill him secretly, so why bother to make things so big.Of course, after the incident broke out, the Liang family was most affected. Although the Yan family was also stained, the crowd onlookers said at most that the aristocracy was really messy and felt that Yan Mu was unlucky to have such a father.The Liang\u2019s stock market had been green all the way these days, even more embarrassing than the original stock price of Huading. Lu Chengyu looked at the photo of Liang Deyou in a suit on the Internet news page with an impatient face and smiled disdainfully. Without Liang Guoming\u2019s teaching, under Liang Deyou\u2019s leadership the Liang\u2019s collapsed, and the Liang\u2019s was scraped and annexed by other companies.\u201cAssistant Lu, your files\u201d, A girl\u2019s voice was heard when the door was knocked.\u201cPlease come in.\u201d Lu Chengyu closed the web page and looked up to see Cao Jingshen\u2019s assistant Li Tong coming in with some folders. He took the things in Li Tong\u2019s hand and smiled and thanked her: \u201cThank you.\u201dLi Tong smiled and exited the assistant room. Seeing that the Boss was walking there, she hurriedly said: \u201cHello, boss.\u201dYan Mu nodded to her, knocked twice on the door of the assistant\u2019s room, and then pushed the door and walked in. This action fell in Li Tong\u2019s eyes. It let her feel more like this unsmiling boss. It\u2019s clear to everyone that the subordinates go to the superior office and knock on the door before entering, but many superiors are not so polite to the subordinates. People like the boss and their assistants pay so much attention to details. It\u2019s no wonder that people like her male God had a good relationship with him.People\u2019s feelings were mutual, and only when mutual respect was present could the feelings cross the hierarchy and really get better.Lu Chengyu was not surprised to see that the person who came in was Yan Mu. Instead, he gave some of the information he found to Yan Mu: \u201cUnder our branch, some people take kickbacks, and the amount is not small.\u201d Some people at the company took kickbacks or received gifts. It was not a special case. However, no boss liked his employees to do this kind of thing, especially when there were such a large number.\u201cThanks for your hard work,\u201d Yan Mu looked at the general content and did not ask Lu Chengyu what he found and by what means. Instead, he mentioned another thing, \u201cTomorrow night Qi Jingfeng will have a banquet at home, and he asked me to invite you to join it.\u201dQi Jingfeng\u2019s parents also had a political marriage, but his parents had a very good relationship. Father Qi and Mother Gu sometimes held some banquets for people in the circle to gather together, and those who were invited would basically participate. After all, the status of the Gu family in the capital was not low. Even some wealthy businessmen who want to break into this circle wanted to get invitations in every way to improve their identity, not to mention some of the more famous artists.Lu Chengyu nodded. Qi Jingfeng is a very good person. He deliberately has a deep friendship, and the other party is also helping him into this circle. Naturally, he will not refuse the other party\u2019s kindness.\u201cNo problem\u201d, Lu Chengyu glanced at the time, it was almost six o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and the wonderful weekend was about to arrive. He simply turned off the computer, cleared his desk, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll drive your car at that time. I\u2019m afraid my little Pentium will cry in front of other luxury cars.\u201d\u201cOkay\u201d, Yan Mu watched Lu Chengyu simply and neatly. After tidying up the desk, \u201cI heard that you didn\u2019t drive to work today. If you come to my place and stayed for one night, we will go there tomorrow night, so it will be convenient.\u201dWill you follow the way of the day and night? Lu Chengyu glanced at Yan Mu. Who would tell a boss that his assistant did not drive to work in the morning? He felt that Yan Mu\u2019s lies were not clever at all, but the other party was still serious. This was simply a test of how deep his ability is to control facial expressions was.Lu Chengyu walked up to Yan Mu and said with a smile: \u201cBoss, you are so kind to your assistant.\u201d Yan Mu looked at his smiling face, his face was full of smiles, and his heart didn\u2019t change and said, \u201cYeah.\u201dLu Chengyu raised his arm to look at his watch, then turned to lift the laptop bag on the table: \u201cIt\u2019s past six o\u2019clock, Brother Mu, let\u2019s get off work.\u201dYan Mu knew that he had agreed to go home with him, and opened the office door, his eyes filled with a little laugh: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dWhen the elevator came, he saw that Yan Mu pressed 1 instead of -1, so he doubted: \u201cWe are not going directly to the parking lot?\u201d\u201cWalking two steps is good for your health\u201d, Yan Mu watched the floor begin to fall, \u201cYou sit in front of the computer all day, if you don\u2019t move, it\u2019s not good for your health.\u201dThe elevator reached the first floor, and after the two went out, they encountered quite a few employees. The staff after work came forward to greet each other, and even the two little girls at the front desk stood up straight and said hello. Although Yan Mu nodded solemnly from beginning to end, Lu Chengyu felt that the other side had a little inexplicable smugness.\u201cBoss, Assistant Lu, are you off work together?\u201d The security guard who was more familiar with Lu Chengyu saw the two walking out side by side and said hello with a smile.\u201cWell,\u201d Yan Mu looked at the security guard who was interrogating and nodded slightly: \u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cNo hard work, no hard work,\u201d the security guard was asked by Yan Mu, rubbing his hands excitedly and watching the two go out, \u201cTwo of you, walk slowly.\u201dLu Chengyu walked out of the lobby door and couldn\u2019t help but look back at everyone. Those colleagues were still secretly watching the backs of the two of them. It seemed that the boss, Yan Mu, was still very attractive to the colleagues.The cool Maybach was on the road, and few would suddenly rush out to overtake. This was completely different from Lu Chengyu\u2019s little Pentium\u2019s treatment, this cruel money-seeking society.After the two returned to Yan Mu\u2019s house, Lu Chengyu helped Yan Mu prepare dinner. The two did not even put the food on the table, but on the coffee table. Holding a rice bowl and watching the news while eating, they looked very homely and down-to-earth. In Lu Chengyu\u2019s memory, when his parents were still alive, their family of three often spent dinner time like this.After eating, Yan Mu looked at the time and suggested taking a walk in the community to help digestion. Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t object, because he often went out to exercise after dinnerThe greenery of the community was particularly good, and the public facilities were also very well-planned. Lu Chengyu saw children running by him from time to time, and there were tables and chairs made into tree stumps on the side of the road, which seemed particularly peaceful.The cool night breeze blew on his face, so that his heart also calmed down. Turning his head to look at the people walking by, he smiled and asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you usually go out for entertainment?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like clubbing or racing\u201d. Yan Mu frowned, \u201cThey all say, my life is very boring.\u201d\u201cEveryone\u2019s lifestyle is different.\u201d Lu Chengyu was not a trendy person. He raised his head and glanced at the moon hanging in the night sky. \u201cYou are pretty good like this.\u201dYan Mu slowed down and look at Lu Chengyu carefully, as if he wanted to confirm whether he was sincere.Seeing him stop, Lu Chengyu turned around questioningly: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cWould you like this kind of life?\u201d Yan Mu walked to Lu Chengyu, \u201cCook together, work together, walk together, live peacefully together.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think, it will be too boring?\u201dLu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu. He didn\u2019t know the mood of the other party, while saying these words. Although Yan Mu\u2019s expression was still calm, he could see the anxiety and expectation in his eyes.The words \u201ctogether\u201d were very simple to say, but there were a few people who were really able to do it. He saw a lot of the privates lives of the rich and the prosperous circle. Now a top-level person in that circle asked him if he would like it. He liked to live a peaceful life. If he didn\u2019t know what kind of person the other party was, he would also find it incredible.He looked away and smiled lightly: \u201cIf you can live this life with the person you like, it will probably be a great accomplishment in life.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d The two continued to walk forward side by side, Yan Mu staring straight ahead, silent. After a while, he asked again, \u201cWhat kind of person do you like?\u201dThe night breeze made the leaves on the side of the road rustle. Lu Chengyu felt that his eyes were a little bit pained from the cool breeze. After blinking several times, he looked at Yan Mu\u2019s serious eyes, and put his hands in his trouser pockets. He said: \u201cLike is a very abstract word for me, people who make me tempted will make me like them.\u201dYan Mu was silent. He knew that Lu Chengyu was not a simple college graduate. He was always a good dancer with words. A good-looking smile makes it difficult to see what kind of person he was. But he knew that Lu Chengyu was not a person who was easily moved. Perhaps the smarter the person, the more thorough the emotional aspect.\u201cIt\u2019s actually very simple to like.\u201d Yan Mu pretended to inadvertently walk to the right of Lu Chengyu, blocking out the cold wind blowing from the left. This place was facing a walkway, and the wind just blew from there, \u201cI like someone, who is good everywhere.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu\u2019s clothes corner blown by the wind, and smiled after a moment of silence: \u201cReally?\u201dYan Mu looked back at him and nodded: \u201cYes, very good.\u201d The two looked at him. And then there was silence.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cUncle,\u201d a chubby little girl ran up to the two of them, first looked at Yan Mu, then at Lu Chengyu, immediately pulling Lu Chengyu\u2019s sleeve without hesitation, and then carefully withdrawing her hand, \u201cUncle, the ball is stuck on the tree, can you help us to take it down?\u201d\u201cWhere is the ball?\u201d Lu Chengyu squatted down with a smile, looking at the little girl, \u201cTake me to there.\u201d\u201cThank you, uncle.\u201dAlthough the little girl was only five or six years old, she was very well-behaved. After taking a careful look at Yan Mu, she took Lu Chengyu to the place where her friends played.Not long after walking, Lu Chengyu saw a few children looking up at a ball on a banyan tree. Only then did he see that it was a very beautiful coloured cloth ball, which seemed to be decorated with bells, colourful tassels and leaves. Entangled together, the bells jingled as soon as the wind blew. A three or four-year-old child was crying. The little girl called Lu Chengyu, who stepped forward to comfort the child. Looking at the cute picture of the two children, Lu Chengyu couldn\u2019t help laughing: \u201cDon\u2019t cry, uncle will take it down for you.\u201dWhen several children saw that someone was willing to help them, they clapped their hands with joy. Lu Chengyu climbed up the tree amidst the cheers of the children. He hung upside down like a golden hook on the branch, and then quickly took off the coloured ball, this handsome action made the hero-worshiping children cheer.Yan Mu stood silently under the tree, caught the coloured ball thrown by Lu Chengyu, and passed it to the children beside him, then watched Lu Chengyu slowly climb down the tree until he stood firmly on the ground.\u201cThank you, brother\u201d, a seven-year-old boy with a toy gun in his hand walked up to Lu Chengyu in a particularly cool way. \u201cTeach me the golden hook move just now. I am willing to be your little brother.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at the 7-year-old. The domineering child, forced him to laugh, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that the hermit master doesn\u2019t accept the younger brother casually?\u201d\u201cThen, how are you willing to accept the younger brother?\u201d The little boy felt that he could fight for it again, \u201cYou can say some conditions, we can discuss.\u201dHe reached out and touched the boy\u2019s head: \u201cWhen I think you can be my little brother, I will come to you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d The little boy frowned and began to think about the truth in what people say.\u201cOf course,\u201d Lu Chengyu nodded solemnly, \u201cThe hermit never lies.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d the little boy nodded reluctantly, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you to come and find me.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Lu Chengyu gave a promise. The person nodded. After breaking away from the children, he finally couldn\u2019t help laughing out, \u201cBrother Mu, the children in your community are so funny.\u201dYan Mu waited for him to laugh enough before saying: \u201cI would just say that the child, who wants to be your little brother is the grandson of Commander Tang\u2019s family.\u201d\u201cIs it the Commander Tang I am thinking of i?\u201d Lu Chengyu felt that his throat was a little dry. He suddenly remembered a movie called \u201cBantou\u201d. The villain in it became a villain because he was caught for stealing a steamed bun which was stolen by the heroine when he was a child. Did he tell a terrible lie just now?Yan Mu nodded cruelly under Lu Chengyu\u2019s expectant eyes.Lu Chengyu holding his chin, and feebly said: \u201cMuge, will I be checked?\u201dYan Mu looked at him like, seriously said: \u201cDo not worry, I\u2019m there, no one will check your water meter[1] .\u201dUnder the serious eyes of the other party, Lu Chengyu put down his hand holding his chin, he coughed dryly, \u201cOr, I\u2019ll go back and tell the kid, I\u2019m not an expert.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Yan Mu hooked his mouth. Suddenly remembering Lu Chengyu\u2019s enthusiasm when facing children, he couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cDo you like children very much?\u201d Maybe the other person liked beautiful and gentle girls, and he wanted a normal family. If so, what should he do?\u201cI like to tease other people\u2019s children\u201d. Lu Chengyu put his hands behind him, \u201cHowever, I never thought about raising children by myself.\u201dYan Mu\u2019s eyes lit up, but his expression became more serious: \u201cChildren are cute, but it\u2019s not good raising them, especially when they are young, they must be accompanied by adults throughout the whole process of eating, drinking, and sleeping, and one can\u2019t be sloppy.\u201d He looked serious and spoke seriously about the troubles that he would encounter when raising a child. Finally, he concluded, \u201cSo, you can\u2019t get married just to have a child.\u201dLooking at Yan Mu\u2019s extraordinarily serious expression, Lu Chengyu listened with a smile. To say that he still couldn\u2019t see Yan Mu\u2019s thoughts, then he would really be a fool. He never thought about finding a man for the rest of his life, but after discovering that Yan Mu had thoughts about him, he didn\u2019t seem to have any dislikes, instead he considered a more serious question. How would the other party confess to him?He also knew that this kind of thinking seemed to be less serious, but he didn\u2019t know why, he just couldn\u2019t get serious, as if\u2026 as if, if the other party confessed, he would promise to try with the other party, and\u2026 he had no problem?Surprised by his own thoughts, Lu Chengyu raised his eyebrows and looked at Yan Mu beside him, frowning slightly. Could it be that the reason why he was bachelor in his last life? Was, it that he didn\u2019t encounter a facial paralysis that suited his taste?In other words, \u2026 his favourite type was facial paralysis? Thinking about it carefully, it seemed that this taste is a bit strange .After walking, the two returned to the house and cooked a bowl of small wontons. They watched TV for a while before returning to the room to sleep.Lu Chengyu lived in the same room as last time, except that the sheets had changed from orange to light blue, and the two little brown bears holding hands on the quilt were facing him. Lying on the soft bed, Lu Chengyu thought he would struggle a bit, who knew he would fall asleep in less than ten minutes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, when he went downstairs and saw the breakfast on the table and Yan Mu sitting on the sofa flipping through the newspaper, he suddenly felt that if the two of them really lived like this, it would be fine.Seeing Lu Chengyu coming downstairs, Yan Mu put down the newspaper and said, \u201cGet up, wash your hands and eat, I\u2019m going to fry eggs.\u201d After Lu Chengyu washed his hands, he sat down at the dining table, looked at the tableware and poured milk. Looking at the delicious sandwich, he felt hungry.The omelette was quickly served by Yan Mu. Lu Chengyu ate the fragrant omelette and said with emotion: \u201cBrother Mu, you are such a good cook, whoever is with you will be blessed.\u201dYan Mu took a sip of milk. He raised his head and said to Lu Chengyu: \u201cIf you like to eat, I will often make it for you in the future.\u201d After saying this, he was taken aback and added, \u201cSo, you have to come often in the future.\u201dLu Chengyu took a bite of the fried egg: \u201d Okay, I will often come to freeload a meal in the future. Don\u2019t think I eat too much.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d a small smile appeared on Yan Mu\u2019s face, \u201cEat well, your health will be good.\u201dPresident Yan had already forgotten his so-called ways to keep one\u2019s body healthy by eating only 70% of the appetite in the past.After eating, Lu Chengyu remembered that he did not have a dress for the banquet, and Yan Mu did not have any clothes for him either. At this time, it was too late to make an order, and Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu had to go out to buy readymade suits.There was never a shortage of customers for high-end consumption in Beijing, but the more so, the more attentive the service of these high-end stores, because only in that way customers were willingly to spend their money.As soon as Lu Chengyu entered the store, the clerk recognized him. The female clerk saw that he was still following the president of Huading. She suddenly remembered the rumours on the Internet and said with a smile: \u201cWelcome.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and nodded to the clerk and took a few glances in the store, and then fancied a dark grey three-piece suit. Although this colour suit was not the most eye-catching, the upper body effect was very good.\u201cSir, do you like this suit?\u201d The female clerk hurriedly took off the suit, and said enthusiastically, \u201cThis size is right for you. Would you like to try it?\u201d\u201cOkay, thank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu followed the female clerk, then entered the fitting room.There was a sofa for guests to rest in the store. Yan Mu sat on the sofa, ignoring the gaze of other shop assistants who thought it was a rare sight, and flipped through a fashion magazine.At this time, another male customer came into the store, dressed very stylishly, with shades on his face, and two men carrying large and small bags behind him.\u201cMr. Zhong,\u201d the clerk recognized that this was a popular male artist Zhong Zhenghan, who was also a frequent visitor recently, so a female clerk hurried forward to greet him eagerly.\u201cIs there a suitable dress in the store?\u201d Zhong Zhenghan took off his shades and smiled very politely. \u201cI\u2019m going to attend the banquet of the Qi family in the capital tonight. I thought about it, your clothes are the most suitable for this occasion.\u201d\u201cThank you, Mr. Zhong can look here.\u201d The clerk said, \u201cThe banquet of Qi\u2019s family is not something that ordinary people can participate in.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgZhong Zhenghan smiled and began to pick clothes. While picking up clothes, he passed Yan Mu\u2019s side, he took a second look and he recognized who this was, and politely stepped forward to greet him: \u201cMr. Yan, hello.\u201d He did not rush forward to introduce who he was. Such a simple greeting was more effective than self-introduction.\u201cHello.\u201d Yan Mu replied politely, without even looking at what the person looked like, and turned a page of a fashion magazine.Seeing that the other party didn\u2019t intend to greet him, Zhong Zhenghan picked his clothes wisely, and also deliberately lowered his voice so as not to disturb the other person\u2019s reading. But before he entered the fitting room, he deliberately looked at Yan Mu a few more times.Lu Chengyu put on his clothes, adjusted the handkerchief on the corner of his chest in front of the mirror, opened the door of the fitting room and walked to Yan Mu. He smiled and asked, \u201cBrother Mu, how do I look?\u201dYan Mu raised his head. Looking at the smiling young man in front of him, his gaze fell on the bow tie. At this moment, he wanted to pull down the bow tie and then unbutton the row of shirt buttons\u2026Putting down the magazine in his hand, he nodded and said, \u201cVery good.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll take this set.\u201d Lu Chengyu pulled the bow tie down, revealing a little collarbone, \u201cI am the most impatient in picking clothes.\u201dThe female salesperson who was picked by Lu Chengyu found her words back, her cheeks were slightly red and said: \u201cMr. Lu, you wear this dress very well. You are in good shape. This dress is like tailor-made for you.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled at the female clerk. The other party blushed, then smiled and went back to the fitting room to change back to the clothes he wore when he came in, and handed the clothes to the female clerk, \u201cHelp me wrap it up, thank you.\u201d The female clerk took the clothes and said in a very gentle tone: \u201cNo need. You\u2019re welcome.\u201dLu Chengyu saw that there were all kinds of men\u2019s brooches in the store. When he was about to choose, he saw the door of another fitting room opened, and a male artist he knew well in his previous life walked out of it.Zhong Zhenghan met Lu Chengyu\u2019s eyes, and he also recognized Lu Chengyu, a popular topic figure recently. As a person in the circle, he felt that Lu Chengyu was very lucky, but this lucky person had no intention of being an entertainer at all. This kind of behaviour in the entertainment industry was simply enviable and hateful.He glanced at Yan Mu who was following Lu Chengyu, his eyes changed slightly, and then he smiled and walked towards Lu Chengyu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he worked at an entertainment company in his previous life, he was his assistant. As an entertainer, Zhong Zhenghan could be regarded as front line, and he was also very polite outside, but Lu Chengyu had been with this person for more than two years and knew about his curiosity.\u201cYou are Mr. Lu,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan smiled gently, \u201cI\u2019m Zhong Zhenghan, I like your high rate of performance.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, \u201cYou starred in \u201cThe Wind\u201d. \u201cXiaoheshan\u201d was also very good-looking, and many people around me liked your performance.\u201d\u201cFengxiaoheshan\u201d was a fantasy martial arts drama. The male protagonist played by Zhong Zhenghan was very popular, and because of this drama, Zhong Zhenghan was very popular. He was the ancient costume male god in the hearts of many movie fans.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s just that I was lucky enough to play such a pleasing role,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan glanced over the two of them several times, probably because Yan Mu\u2019s eyes were too cold, he smiled awkwardly. \u201cAm I disturbing the two of you? You are busy, and I also have to pick out the clothes.\u201d After saying this, he retracted aside and began to choose his clothes.Lu Chengyu sighed silently, and then continued to look at men\u2019s brooches. He just chose two suitable brooches. He turned around and saw Yan Mu following behind him. He put one of them on his chest, and then nodded: \u201cYou wear this one, it will look good on you.\u201dYan Mu usually seldom wore such decorative things, but seeing Lu Chengyu choosing for him, he stood honestly and let Lu Chengyu play around.\u201cWrap this brooch too,\u201d Lu Chengyu picked another delicate bow tie. The bow tie fabric on the suit was not what he liked. \u201cWrap all these.\u201d He took out a card from the wallet and handed it to the cashier. He turned his head and said to Yan Mu, \u201cBrother Mu, you really don\u2019t want to buy anything?\u201dShaking his head, Yan Mu said, \u201cThere are a lot of suitable clothes at home, so I don\u2019t need to buy any more.\u201d He noticed the man behind him. The artist has been watching them secretly, frowning slightly, \u201cIt\u2019s almost noon, let\u2019s go to Baiweixuan to eat.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Lu Chengyu entered the password, received the receipt from the cashier, and took a large bag of clothes, \u201cLet\u2019s go now.\u201dYan Mu nodded, and the two of them were blocked by Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s assistant before they reached the door of the store. Throwing down a bunch of clothes he was going to buy, he rushed to Lu Chengyu\u2019s side, and said with a smile: \u201cIt\u2019s rare to meet Mr. Lu, why don\u2019t we take a photo together?\u201dYan Mu frowned, and calmly looked at the male artist. At a glance, the brow furrowed even tighter.\u201cOkay,\u201d Lu Chengyu uttered these words, and Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s hand was wrapped around his neck. Looking at the mobile phone held high in his left hand, he smiled at the camera.\u201cTwo handsome guys are together, each more handsome than the other,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan retracted his phone, glanced at the photo with satisfaction, edited a Weibo, and then posted a photo of the two on the Weibo platform.\u201cOh fuck, I forgot to use a filter,\u201d after Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s Weibo post was uploaded, he looked at Lu Chengyu annoyedly, \u201cWhat to do?\u201d\u201cThe handsome guy is just as handsome even if he doesn\u2019t use filters. What are you afraid off?\u201d Lu Chengyu took out his phone and found the Weibo post that Zhong Zhenghan wrote about himself, and after forwarding it, he followed the other party easily. Then he was not surprised to see that the relationship between the two people was paid attention by everyone, which showed that Zhong Zhenghan had paid attention to him a long time ago.Working as Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s assistant for more than two years, this man was not only extremely narcissistic about looks, but also had a special hobby, that is, watching gossip. As long as there was any gossip exposed in the circle, this person will secretly watch in the corner, and sometimes even wear a vest to watch and reveal the news on some entertainment forums. Even his biggest reason for entering the entertainment circle was to be able to watch gossip in the circle.So, Zhong Zhenghan paid attention to his Weibo. He was not surprised at all. After all, he was a recent topic person. Most people paid attention to this topic unless they did not have the Internet or TV.\u201cYou make sense,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan was worried that his photos were not perfect, but as soon as Lu Chengyu said this, his favourability for Lu Chengyu immediately increased by dozens of points. \u201cMan, you have such a vision, let\u2019s be friends.\u201dWhen Lu Chengyu saw the helpless expressions of the two assistants behind Zhong Zhenghan, he smiled and said, \u201cOkay, okay.\u201dAssistant 1: How can the employer be broken? How can the employer befriend unreliable people?Assistant 2: Why does he have a bad feeling?Yan Mu silently watched Lu Chengyu get together with a young artist he had just met, and the corners of his mouth sank unconsciously. He rarely saw Lu Chengyu really passionate about something. Although many people said that Lu Chengyu was a polite gentleman, he knew in his heart that Lu Chengyu was only outwardly polite to these people. But today after meeting a strange artist in the clothing store, he was so casual. This was very different from the usual Lu Chengyu, and the difference made him a little worried.After Lu Chengyu spoke a few words with Zhong Zhenghan, he turned back to see that the corners of Yan Mu\u2019s mouth were turned down, he smiled and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go first, and I will contact you when I have time.\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t bother you.\u201d Zhong Zhenghan saw that Yan Mu was watching the two of them, restored his gentle appearance, and smiled lightly, \u201cI will contact you later.\u201dLooking at this smiling face like a spring breeze, Lu Chengyu was sure that what was in his mind was definitely not like his expression.Seeing Lu Chengyu walking towards him, Yan Mu\u2019s down-curved mouth gradually turned into a horizontal line, he nodded to Zhong Zhenghan slightly, and took Lu Chengyu out of the clothing store.\u201cWalk slowly, and you are welcome to come again next time.\u201d The clerk at the door bowed and watched the two people out of the shop, and get into a car that seemed not cheap before he took his gaze back. Thinking of the rumours on the Internet, she was a bit disdainful. The Internet was just scribbling. There were even rumours that God Lu Chengyu was taken care off, but God Lu Chengyu was clearly spending his own money and did not go to please the president of Huading.Therefore, it was better to believe in your own eyes than the rumours on internet. But\u2026 the relationship between Lu Chengyu and his boss really seemed to be very good.Zhong Zhenghan walked into the fitting room holding a vest with a smile on his face. After closing the door, the smile on his face gradually dissipated. He didn\u2019t know, if it was his illusion, that Lu Chengyu, this young man seemed to know him and was his fan!Putting the waistcoat on his body, he buttoned the buttons one by one, and straightened out the collar of his shirt. Whether he was his fan or not, he looked pretty pleasing to the eye.There was quiet music in the car. Although Yan Mu looked ahead, he couldn\u2019t let go of what he had encountered in the store before. After hesitating for a while, he asked, \u201cThat male artist, you like him very much?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like him; I don\u2019t like him.\u201d Lu Chengyu thought for a while, \u201cAlthough his looks are gentle, he has a strange personality.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgAfter offending Huang Chuan in his previous life, he was expelled from the brokerage company. Later, he didn\u2019t find any job smoothly. He heard that even though Zhong Zhenghan was warned by the brokerage company, he insisted on finding a crew job for him. After Huang Chuan knew about it, he actually became one of the investors in the show just to trouble him.Yan Mu thought for a moment: \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to think highly of him.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and said, \u201cI can\u2019t think highly of him.\u201d Although Zhong Zhenghan helped him, this strange behaviour and hobby made Lu Chengyu unable to say a contrary praise.\u201cWell, it seems that he is really not very good.\u201d Yan Mu let go of the worry in his heart. Even if Lu Chengyu was special to this person, he will definitely not be ambiguous towards this person. You know, if you really like someone, even if they are full of shortcomings, they will find these shortcomings very cute.The capital had never lacked wealthy families, so when the banquet of the Qi family was about to begin, all kinds of luxury cars were parked outside the gate. In the banquet, the men in suits and shoes, the women in gorgeous clothes and beautiful dresses, the clothes were fragrant and the shadows were indescribably lively.Qi Jingfeng was holding a glass of red wine and greeted some elders from time to time, but he was a little impatient. After drinking a few sips of red wine, he suppressed his irritability.He was relieved when he saw a few friends showing up, found a reason, squeezed into the friends group, and said with a long sigh: \u201cYou are finally here.\u201d\u201cWhy, someone introduced you to a girlfriend?\u201d Zhuang Yu holding a glass of champagne in his hand, smiled sympathetically when he saw Qi Jingfeng look like this, \u201cBrother, you can just find a woman to get married.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of stepping into the tomb of marriage at a young age.\u201d Qi Jingfeng knew that his family intended to let him find a woman who was right to marry him, but he hadn\u2019t had enough of it now, so he was not willing to pay attention and glanced at his friends. \u201cBrother Mu and Xiao Lu haven\u2019t come here yet?\u201d\u201cThey may come in a while,\u201d Zhang Zeyun took the conversation, \u201cI have just received a call from Xiao Lu saying that they are already on the road.\u201dZhuang Yu looked a little surprised. Qi Jingfeng glanced at it. Among the three of them, Qi Jingfeng should be the one who had the farthest relationship with Lu Chengyu, but he did not expect that Qi Jingfeng was the first person to decide to officially bring Lu Chengyu into this circle.To step into this circle, there must be a springboard, and such a banquet was the best path. There were a lot of people around them who wanted to squeeze into this circle, but they would not bring people into this circle at will, \u201cYou invited Xiao Lu?\u201dNodding, Qi Jingfeng sipped red wine: \u201cThis person Xiao Lu is worth paying attention to.\u201d Among the few people, he was not the closest to Lu Chengyu, but this does not prevent him from seeing Lu Chengyu pleasingly.Zhuang Yu wanted to say something but stopped. It was not that he and Zhang Zeyun didn\u2019t want to bring Lu Chengyu into this circle, but because they were worried that Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu\u2019s affairs would be discovered by the Mu family, they had always taken care not to do so. They didn\u2019t know that Brother Mu would come here with people so generously and wouldn\u2019t care about the eyes of the Yan family and the Mu family at all.\u201cOriginally, our family will hold a banquet next month. I was going to invite him to participate, but you were ahead of me.\u201d Zhang Zeyun smiled, \u201cThis is good.\u201d He knows that Brother Mu is a person, who will not make jokes about feelings. Since, he had thoughts about Lu Chengyu, it meant that he wanted to spend a lifetime with Lu Chengyu.When Zhuang Yu heard the words, he was about to say something when he saw people of Mu family from their generation coming over, so he hurriedly swallowing the unspoken words, and greeted the two with a smile.\u201cAren\u2019t this the brother\u2019s friends?\u201d Mu Qihua greeted several people with a smile. Mu Qirong behind him only greeted a few people briefly, and then stopped talking.Zhuang Yu and others knew that Mu Qirong didn\u2019t like to talk too much. This was very similar to Yan Mu, so no one took it to heart. Not to mention he was also from the Mu family, so he needed to be treated politely.\u201cXiao Yan hasn\u2019t arrived yet?\u201d Mu Qihua glanced at the entire hall, a little disappointed. \u201cIt seems that he won\u2019t be here again today.\u201d Yan Mu didn\u2019t like to attend these receptions. It was something everyone knew. So, there was not much hope.\u201cBrother Mu is on the way, maybe, we should wait a while, don\u2019t worry Brother Hua.\u201d Zhang Zeyun knew that Mu Qihua was the smiling fox of the Mu family. He smiled at everyone, but he had a lot of things hidden in his heart and eyes. What kind of eyes do most people have? There was no way to hide in front of him.\u201cIt\u2019s rare that my cousin is willing to come.\u201d Mu Qihua smiled happily after hearing the words, and smiled with curving eyebrows, like the gentle neighbour next door, \u201cI will have a drink with him later.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Turning his head, he saw Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu walk in the hall. The expressions of the two were serious and relaxed respectively, but they were walking together in an unexpected tune.\u201cBrother Mu is here.\u201d Zhuang Yu didn\u2019t dare to face the smiling Mu Qihua. Seeing Yan Mu appear, he was relieved and turned around to meet the two of them, \u201cYou finally arrived.\u201d\u201cBrother Zhuang,\u201d Lu Chengyu took two glasses of champagne from the waiter\u2019s tray with a smile, and handed one to Yan Mu, who was next to him. He raised the glass and touched Zhuang Yu\u2019s. He raised his hands and made no appearance of the formality of attending this occasion for the first time. \u201cThe car had been blocked on the road for a while and we had to keep you waiting for a long time.\u201dAlthough Zhuang Yu did not like men, he was still dazzled by Lu Chengyu\u2019s appearance. The close-fitting suit, the slender legs wrapped in trousers, this toast and smile, really was a bit enchanting.He coughed and looked away abruptly under Yan Mu\u2019s strict gaze: \u201cWe have just arrived, the banquet hasn\u2019t started yet, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Although Lu Chengyu looked a bit enchanting, Mu Ge\u2019s eyes seemed even more terrifying.\u201cI\u2019ll take you to get to know people.\u201d Yan Mu stood beside Lu Chengyu, glanced across the hall, and finally fell to the group of Qi Jingfeng. \u201cMy two cousins are also there.\u201dLu Chengyu followed the strict gaze of Yan Mu to look at those people, his eyes rolled a few times on Mu Qihua and Mu Qirong, his eyes dropped slightly, and he nodded.Zhuang Yu followed them very consciously, as if he didn\u2019t want to confront the Mu family at all.\u201cBrother Qi.\u201d after Lu Chengyu approached a few people, he first clinked glasses with Qi Jingfeng to express his gratitude for the invitation, and then greeted Zhang Zeyun. As for the two brothers of the Mu family, he just smiled politely and did not say hello.\u201cBig cousin, second cousin, this is my assistant Lu Chengyu.\u201d Yan Mu said to Lu Chengyu, \u201cThey are my cousin Mu Qihua, Mu Qirong.\u201d\u201cI have met Mu Qirong before in the company, sir.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled at Mu Qirong, \u201cHello.\u201d\u201cHello.\u201d Mu Qirong had a good impression of Lu Chengyu. Although, he didn\u2019t know why a small assistant was so familiar with Qi Jingfeng and was at his party, he was still polite and nodded to Lu Chengyu.\u201cHello, Mr. Lu.\u201d Mu Qihua stretched out his hand to Lu Chengyu and said with a smile, \u201cI have heard of the name.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled before saying a word, holding Mu Qihua\u2019s hand and smiled: \u201cMr. Mu with a smile.\u201d To say, Mu Qirong was a very strict self-disciplined person, Mu Qihua was simply the opposite. He seemed to be gentle and easy to get along with, but in fact such people have the most complicated minds.\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201d Mu Qihua retracted his hand, raised his glass, and drank a sip of champagne before saying, \u201cI have watched Mr. Lu\u2019s \u201cA Book of Life\u201d.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and took a sip of champagne, \u201cThank you Mr. Mu for your attention to me.\u201d This Mu Qihua didn\u2019t seem to like him very much. Although the other party\u2019s words were all compliments to him, he just couldn\u2019t see closeness in the other\u2019s eyes.\u201cI have also watched Xiao Lu\u2019s \u201cA Book of Life\u201d,\u201d Yan Mu interjected at this time, \u201che did very well on the show.\u201dMu Qihua looked at Yan Mu, then looked at Lu Chengyu, and laughed and said: \u201cMy cousin is right, I think so too.\u201dZhang Zeyun watched this scene silently and couldn\u2019t help frowning. Mu Qihua seemed to see something, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have such an attitude. Also, Lu Chengyu was so good that it didn\u2019t seem that he participated in this kind of occasion for the first time.\u201cBy the way, since Mr. Lu has participated in \u201cFlying Birds\u201d, do you know who the investor in this movie was?\u201d Mu Qihua sighed, \u201cI feel very impressed by this discerning investor. If I have the opportunity, I hope to work with him.\u201dAs soon as these words came out, even Zhuang Yu\u2019s brow wrinkled. Xiao Lu was the investor, but it had always been hidden in the dark. Although someone usually asked him, but when he saw him, he is reluctant to speak, and most of them didn\u2019t ask any more. Now, that Mu Qihua said this, he obviously knew that Lu Chengyu was the investor behind the scenes, which also meant that Mu Qihua had investigated Xiao Lu before. Thinking of this, he tilted his head to look at Yan Mu, and as expected, he was not happy judging by his expression.Also, who liked to chase someone, who was suspected by his relatives.The atmosphere between these few people suddenly solidified, only Mu Qihua and Lu Chengyu still smiled mildly, as if Mu Qihua had no intention of embarrassing Lu Chengyu, and Lu Chengyu did not hear his implied words.\u201cA person like Mr. Mu can\u2019t find an investor!\u201d Lu Chengyu said with a faint smile, \u201cWhere can we see such an investor?\u201d How could he not hear that this person had opinions about him. Because of the rumours on the Internet, or because of other things. However, no matter what the reason was, this one was not qualified to pick at him. He didn\u2019t have the talent to be a little daughter-in-law[1].\u201cAlthough this investor is not big, he is exceptionally capable.\u201d Mu Qihua hooked his mouth. \u201cI like working with capable people the most. The person digs the ground three feet to find out. There is no way I can do it; I just have such a bad temper.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, not commenting, but turned around and handed the champagne to Yan Mu, \u201cBrother Mu, help me change it to a glass of juice, thank you.\u201dYan Mu took a look at Mu Qihua, took the wine glass and hurriedly walked to the beverage tower, chose a glass of freshly squeezed juice for Lu Chengyu, then passed through the crowd, and handed the juice to Lu Chengyu\u2019s hands: \u201cTry this, if you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll get you a change.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLooking at Yan Mu\u2019s actions, Mu Qihua\u2019s smile could hardly be maintained. After a while, he said: \u201cMy cousin is so kind to his assistant, even I felt a little jealous, seeing my brother like this.\u201d\u201cHe is my assistant, so, he should be treated like this.\u201d Yan Mu said blankly. \u201cIf you\u2019re jealous, you can treat your assistant a little better.\u201dMu Qihua: \u201c\u2026\u201dZhuang Yu: Brother Mu, good job!Lu Chengyu took a sip of the juice and said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cIf you like it, I\u2019ll get another for you later,\u201d Yan Mu\u2019s face softened, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to visit a few elders.\u201dLu Chengyu held the juice. His hand paused, then smiled and nodded. He also wanted to know which step Yan Mu was willing to take for him, and whether the two could really come together.After watching Yan Mu lead people away, the smile on Mu Qihua\u2019s face gradually dropped to freezing point. He faintly looked at Zhang Zeyun: \u201cZeyun, you and Xiao Yan have been friends for many years. I hope, you know something. Don\u2019t hide it from me.\u201dZhang Zeyun held the wine glass tightly, but smiled on his face: \u201cWhat does Brother Hua mean?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Xiao Yan and this Lu Chengyu?\u201d Mu Qihua was cold, when he said, \u201cThe matter of his close relationship with an assistant in private has been spread out in the circle for a long time, and now this assistant and Xiao Yan\u2019s affairs have been made available on the Internet, don\u2019t you guys want to talk about it?\u201d\u201cThey are not bad. What is there to say.\u201d Zhuang Yu didn\u2019t like Mu Qihua\u2019s attitude of treating Yan Mu as a child, so he said, \u201cEveryone gets along happily.\u201dMu Qihua glanced at Zhuang Yu: \u201cThen tell me something. What are the rumours on the Internet?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this the ghost of Song Junyan?\u201d Zhuang Yu shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just the rumours on the Internet, what\u2019s all the fuss about?\u201dMu Qihua listened to Zhuang Yu\u2019s words, and laughed instead: \u201cWhat kind of person Xiao Yan is, I know very well. If he doesn\u2019t want these rumours to spread, he would have thought of a way to delete similar remarks. Why would he let the people on the Internet make a lot of noise?\u201dZhuang Yu was speechless. Zhang Zeyun glanced at him and shook his head at him, and signalled him not to face this -on. After all, Mu Qihua was the boss of this generation, and most people wanted to give him face.\u201cSince this matter was indulged by our cousin, you can just go to our cousin to deal with it,\u201d Mu Qirong, who had been silent beside him, asked, \u201cA child who has no father and no mother can be regarded as being embarrassed by his cousin. \u201cMu Qihua: \u201c\u2026\u201dZhang Zeyun and Zhuang Yu: Brother Rong, you are really sharp and neat with this knife!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu Chengyu silently followed Yan Mu and listened to him introducing his identity to the family, without any perfunctory element.But everyone didn\u2019t think that it was personal. Instead, they thought that Yan Mu valued this young assistant and was implying that they should give Lu Chengyu more convenience in their work in the future.This has something to do with Yan Mu\u2019s way of introduction. First of all, he let the other party realize the importance of Lu Chengyu and his respectful attitude towards Lu Chengyu. It did not make people think that Lu Chengyu was a person who made his way through other means.Gu Qiu, the host of the banquet, was a smart person. After Yan Mu introduced Lu Chengyu with few words, he could see that this young man surnamed Lu was very important to the Yan family boy. At the moment, he smiled gently and said: \u201cI heard Xiao Feng mentioning you, but I didn\u2019t expect it. Such a powerful person is so young.\u201d\u201c Aunt Gu, I also could not believe it ,\u201d Lu Chengyu had some pure surprises for the beautiful women, \u201cWhen you and Brother Qi are walking together, everyone will notice you and think of you as a pair of siblings. If you say you are a mother and son, I am afraid that no one will believe it.\u201d\u201cHow can you child say something so exaggerated\u201d. Gu Qiu was not a particularly beautiful woman, but her skin is well-maintained and her appearance was gentle, this was a look that is very easy to make people feel good about. A woman who could have such a face was generally very beautiful throughout life. \u201cYou young people have fun together, and you must tell me what you are not satisfied with.\u201cThank you auntie, everything is fine, there is nothing to be dissatisfied with.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and answered a few words, and saw two gorgeously dressed ladies approaching here, knowing that they were here to look for Gu Qiu, so he looked for an excuse, and went aside with Yan Mu.Knowing some people back and forth like this, the banquet had already begun for a while. Based on Lu Chengyu\u2019s understanding of Yan Mu, Yan Mu was not a person who liked this kind of occasion, but this person had spent so much energy introducing him to gain contacts for him. From a certain point of view, this man\u2019s love tactics were so stupid that he couldn\u2019t look directly at him. Didn\u2019t he think that he could just be borrowing his connections to pave the way for him in the future, and then can turn his head to ignore him? After all, he was also a person with hundreds of millions of assets. With contacts, where will there be a shortage of car beauties in the future?If he was selfish, shouldn\u2019t he cut off his path of development and let him develop only by relying on the other party?Mu Qihua, as the oldest of Mu Jiaqi\u2019s generation, worried about his brothers in the family the most. When he knew that his younger brother might be unclear about a man, he was shocked and dissatisfied with the Yan family. If it weren\u2019t for the Yan family and the things they did, how could his good cousin become more difficult to communicate with than Qi Rong, and how could he be interested in men.He was not a rash person, so after discovering the signs of the matter, he turned around and asked someone to check Lu Chengyu\u2019s information. This investigation revealed a lot of things that were wrong. For example, this assistant Lu was young, and his methods were not small. He made such a big Liang Clan the way they are now. There were also those who knew Lu Chengyu. Most people said that he is gentle, polite and friendly. Few people said that he is not good. Even the company and the security guards of his residential area were extremely close to him. Such a person was either really natural and kind, or he was good at acting, so that people won\u2019t know his true face. Obviously, Lu Chengyu belonged to the latter.Lu Chengyu, a person with no background and identity, had collected so much negative information about the Liang family, and had made the Liang family so miserable, then this shows that this person was not harmless in nature. In addition, the suggestions and decisions, he made after entering Huading showed that this person was extremely ambitious and visionary and was not a simple person.In fact, if it weren\u2019t for something wrong between his cousin and Lu Chengyu, Mu Qihua himself admired people like Lu Chengyu, who were ambitious, capable of bending, stretching, and being able to adjust. If he wasn\u2019t such a person, even he wouldn\u2019t believe it.However, this did not mean that he likes his younger brother should be mingled with such a person. If he found a simpler man, he would not be so worried, but his younger brother, who had never been in love, was attracted to this fox. It was not easy to be reassured however you think.As a result, throughout the dinner, he saw his younger brother keep introducing people to Lu Chengyu. Why didn\u2019t he see his cousin so positive at the banquet before? Was this the legendary younger brother who couldn\u2019t help but forget his friends?Mu Qihua felt that he was a little bit disappointed. His younger brother who he had been protecting for more than 20 years, liked a man. He was anxious. Moreover, the other party liked a complicated man. He was even more anxious. Thinking of the things that Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents had been involved in, he couldn\u2019t help but rub his forehead.\u201cBrother Hua,\u201d Zhang Zeyun walked to Mu Qihua. He knew that Mu Qihua\u2019s attention was mostly on Lu Chengyu tonight. He worried that Mu Qihua would trouble Lu Chengyu afterwards, so he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not you. As I thought, this matter\u2026 doesn\u2019t really have much to do with Xiao Lu.\u201d His gaze swept across Mu Qihua\u2019s white face, and finally fell on the red wine in the other hand. With that slender and pale hand, it reminded him of a vampire with blood.\u201cOh?\u201d Mu Qihua raised his eyebrows and looked at Zhang Zeyun with a smile, and his index finger slowly rubbed the rim of the cup a few times. \u201cYou are protecting him. It seems that this one is really capable.\u201dZhang Zeyun didn\u2019t know what to say for a while, he tugged at the corner of his mouth, showing a smile, concealing his helplessness.\u201cSome things are not as simple as you think,\u201d Mu Qihua put the wine glass on the side table, put one hand in his trouser pocket, and said with a smile, \u201cYou don\u2019t know, people tend to hate people of the same type as you? \u201cZhang Zeyun silently watched Mu Qihua walk towards a group of official second generations and sighed after a long while. Although he felt that these two people were different in many ways, there was one way in which these two people were the same, that is, their laugh. The better-looking they were, the more permeable it was.Because Yan Mu was called away by several brothers of the Mu family, Lu Chengyu felt a little bored in the hall after being polite with some people, so he turned around and went to the garden of the Qi family mansion. The Qi\u2019s villa was built on the mountainside outside the Fifth Ring of Beijing. It occupied a large area, so a large area was used to build a garden.The people at the banquet were busy with each other or chatting, there was no one in the garden. Walking on a quiet road, Lu Chengyu suddenly remembered a film that satirized aristocratic circles abroad. The two married couples were lovers of each other. At the banquet, the two couples went to the back garden to make love. Who knew it was an accident but the two parties exchanged, and after they got dressed, they found out that the other party was their own husband or wife, which seemed particularly in black humour.Feeling that his mind was running a little far away, Lu Chengyu took a step and realized that it was not a smart move to go to the garden at this time. He turned around and walked towards the banquet hall, although he heard a man\u2019s muffled sound after walking a few steps. He didn\u2019t stop either.\u201cFuck you silly X! I won\u2019t kill you.\u201dThe voice seemed familiar, Lu Chengyu slowed down slightly, and squinted to the corner. He saw a dim figure kicking an object on the ground with a large arc of action. It hurt when he looked at it.\u201cFuck,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan wiped his hands with a tissue and walked out of the corner. When he saw a person standing under the street lamp, he frowned first, but after seeing who it was, his cold expression suddenly turned into a smile: \u201cIt turned out to be Mr. Lu, it\u2019s a coincidence.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence.\u201d Lu Chengyu glanced over the pile of objects in the corner, and smiled and pointed to a camera not far away.Zhong Zhenghan looked back at the camera, frowned and said, \u201cMr. Huang was drunk, and he had to climb the statue over there. The fall may be a bit serious.\u201dLu Chengyu heard Zhong Zheng\u2019s letter mention Mr. Huang. The smile on his face became wider, but his tone was a little disdainful: \u201cIs that Mr. Huang Chuan?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cIt\u2019s not him,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan tossed the tissue into the trash can, \u201cI dare to find someone to do something on this occasion for such a thing, he really doesn\u2019t put Qi\u2019s family in his eyes.\u201d He dared to beat Huang Chuan, first because no one saw Huang Chuan when he moved his hands and feet in the garden, second because Huang Chuan was drunk and didn\u2019t know who he was molesting, and the third was a character like Huang Chuan was not able to match the monitoring system of the family.In this life, Huang Chuan did not have the same financial power as the previous life. He dared to molest a straight man like Zhong Zhenghan. With Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s temper, it was rare to not beat him to death.\u201cWell, Mr. Huang really drank a lot\u201d, Lu Chengyu smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s windy in the garden. Mr. Zhong should go to the lobby to play. We talked about the film cooperation plan for so long outside, and it\u2019s almost the same.\u201dZhong Zhenghan heard that Lu Chengyu was prepared to defend him, and walked to Lu Chengyu, and asked with a smile, \u201cWhy would Mr. Lu help me?\u201d\u201cThere is a line of lyrics that is sung like this, and the road is not peaceful\u201d, Lu Chengyu smiled. As he walked to the hall with Zhong Zhenghan, \u201cHuang\u2019s surname is not a good thing, righteous man, you did a good job.\u201d After he became good buddies with Zhong Zhenghan in his previous life, it was not that he had not done anything secretly.Zhong Zhenghan smiled when he heard the words and patted Lu Chengyu\u2019s shoulder: \u201cDude, I\u2019m making a deal with you as a friend.\u201d Although he had only met Lu Chengyu before, it didn\u2019t prevent him from seeing Lu Chengyu, as more and more pleasing to his eyes. Seeing him beating someone who has some face up and was still ready to cover up for him, this was just in line with his heart. For this reason, he made a difficult decision. In the future, he may read less Lu Chengyu\u2019s gossip.\u201cOkay\u201d Lu Chengyu slapped Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s shoulder back with a smile, jokingly. \u201cMaybe we were good brothers who fought together in our previous life, and pitted people together.\u201dZhong Zhenghan didn\u2019t take Lu Chengyu\u2019s jokes seriously. But was amused by these words: \u201cI don\u2019t believe this.\u201dSoon after the two brothers returned to the lobby, Zhong Zhenghan was dragged away by his agent, and Lu Chengyu watched him walk a few steps away. He also made a gesture to contact again next time and smiled.After getting an affirmative answer, Zhong Zhenghan was dragged away by his agent contentedly. He didn\u2019t think of one thing when he went so far, and that is why Lu Chengyu knew the meaning of these little actions.Mu Qihua, who had been drinking by the window sill, saw Lu Chengyu separate from the stranger, and said lightly: \u201cMr. Lu has so many friends. He has many friends, and he has all kinds of friends.\u201dLu Chengyu turned around and saw Mu Qihua. Standing in the corner of the window sill, he couldn\u2019t be found unless you looked closely. Lu Chengyu walked slowly to the other side of the window sill and lay on his stomach under the smirk of the other person\u2019s eyes, and then realized that he could just see the garden from there. He turned to Mu Qihua and said: \u201cMr. Mu jokes, friends are friends, there is no rank.\u201dMu Qihua glanced at him, silently looked at the scenery outside the window, took a sip of red wine after a while, lazily. Leaning against the window, he looked so leisurely as if he had not come to attend a banquet, but to enjoy the scenery: \u201cThis idea is very good.\u201d\u201cEveryone has their own arrogance and prejudice. Sometimes good ideas and practices can\u2019t be completely synchronized. \u201cLu Chengyu smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s all human nature, but no one else is willing to bear a prejudice for no reason.\u201dMu Qihua raised his eyebrows and tilted his head to look at Lu Chengyu, with soft black hair and overly beautiful eyebrows. A well-fitting dress, slender legs. From the physical point of view, Lu Chengyu was almost impeccable. After watching for a while, he finally retracted his gaze and put the goblet on the window sill, \u201cMr. Lu is now worth hundreds of millions, hasn\u2019t thought of doing anything else?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been doing something else,\u201d Lu Chengyu said openly. \u201cBut my chief position is the assistant to the president of Huading.\u201dLooking at this person under 22 years old, Mu Qihua thought of himself at that time, lowered his eyelids slightly, remained silent, and the relationship between the two suddenly became calm.When the other party didn\u2019t speak, Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t speak any more. He saw someone spot Huang Chuan in the garden, and then lead him out of Qi\u2019s house. Immediately, the servants of the Qi family began to clean the place where Huang Chuan lay. It was probably Huang Chuan\u2019s vomit that polluted the environment.\u201cHuang Chuan is the nephew of the third wife of the Yan family. Although people are not a good thing, but I heard that the third wife is very fond of this nephew.\u201d Mu Qihua stood up straight and walked slowly outwards, \u201cYou and the Qi family boy have a good relationship. If you want to help your friend, let him go and process the monitoring records. When you do something, you must wipe your trail clean and don\u2019t make trouble for yourself.\u201d After finishing, he didn\u2019t even look at Lu Chengyu, took a graceful step and left.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t hesitate to find Qi Jingfeng and talked about it. Qi Jingfeng knew about the relationship between Huang Chuan and Yan Lao San. He immediately asked someone to clean up the surveillance and expressed his appreciation for Lu Chengyu\u2019s behaviour. Obviously, he didn\u2019t have any good feelings for Yan Lao San.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He watched Lu Chengyu and asked, \u201cThat artist is Zhong Zhenghan?\u201d Lu Chengyu is not a nosy person, but he broke it for Zhong Zhenghan tonight. With this example, it really made him unable to help but mind.Lu Chengyu nodded, \u201cHe is a nice person. It\u2019s normal for people like Huang Chuan to be beaten.\u201dYan Mu said after a few seconds of silence, \u201cI understand.\u201dQi Jingfeng looked at this and then again, not knowing why. He seemed to feel something was wrong with the atmosphere in front of him.After the banquet, Yan Mu and his party bid farewell to the Qi family, and Mu Qihua asked to drive away with Yan Mu on the grounds of his house being on the way.After Mu Qihua gave this reason, Mu Qirong behind him said: \u201cBig brother, we live in the opposite direction of the cousin\u2019s villa.\u201d\u201cHave you never heard that the earth is round?\u201d Mu Qihua smiled. Without a smile, \u201cHow could the direction be different?\u201dZhuang Yu and others next to him: \u201c\u2026\u201d The last group of people left together, Mu Qihua and Mu Qirong had a car, Zhuang Yu and Zhang Zeyun each had a car, and Lu Chengyu came with Yan Mu.Four luxury cars driving together, really had a feeling of being a bit of local tyrants.When passing a road with few cars and few people, they found a large old truck in front of them blocking the road. Their car couldn\u2019t drive along. Several people suddenly felt something was wrong. The bodyguards, Zhuang Yu and Zhang Zeyun, brought were all vigilant.Just when the driver was about to reverse the car, suddenly a group of people with iron rods and knives rushed out and started smashing their car. It was obviously a premeditated thing prepared to drag people outside after smashing the window of the car.\u201cFuck!\u201d Lu Chengyu saw a knife slash at Yan Mu, hurriedly pulled Yan Mu, turned around and opened the door without hesitation. A sweeping sweep knocked a small gangster next to him to the ground, and then he flew up and stepped on the opponent\u2019s stomach, quickly grabbed the iron rod in the opponent\u2019s hand, and turned his head to see someone approaching the window next to Yan Mu\u2019s driver\u2019s seat. With his hand supported, he turned over from the front of the car, knocked the rod the man\u2019s arm, and only heard a click, the man cried and fell to the ground, clutching his arm.Lu Chengyu kicked the crying person aside, then picked up the knife on the ground and threw it to Yan Mu. Seeing that Yan Mu was about to get out of the car, he reached out and pushed the person back. He looked back and kicked the little bastard: \u201d Don\u2019t come out to make trouble for Lao Tzu!\u201dYan Mu shook the knife in his hand: \u201c\u2026\u201dAt this time, Mu Qirong, who had been a soldier, as well as Zhang Zeyun and Zhuang Yu\u2019s bodyguards all got out of the car and started fighting with them, Lu Chengyu took advantage of this gap to find that the road behind them was also blocked by a car. It seemed that someone was going to trouble them in this wilderness and even found a route. However, who is so courageous and dare to start something like this?There was no one on their side. Lu Chengyu found that these people seemed to be surrounded by the car where Mu Qihua was sitting, and Mu Qirong obviously couldn\u2019t stop the siege of so many people. He seemed a little stretched, Mu Qihua sat on the seat, whose window had been smashed, and a man who rushed to drag Mu Qihua was slashed to the back of his hand by Yan Mu, and he took a few steps back in pain.After hesitating, he glanced at Yan Mu, and finally sighed, \u201cDon\u2019t come out, I\u2019ll take a look.\u201d After saying that, without waiting for Yan Mu to speak, he ran to the car in which Mu Qihua was riding. The person who attacked Mu Qihua hit him. The neat and fierce momentum made Mu Qihua sitting in the back seat of the car stunned.Mu Qihua was a leader in the mixed politics of the Mu family\u2019s generation, so many people in Beijing were envious of him, and if they didn\u2019t deal with the Mu family, they regarded him as a thorn in the eye. But somebody who dared to do it so stupidly, he really couldn\u2019t think of who was behind this incident.Outside the window, Lu Chengyu smashed an iron rod on the back of the bully who rushed forward, as if he was smashing a piece of dead pork and watched the bully snort and fell down. Mu Qihua couldn\u2019t help but stiffen his back. The back seemed a bit chilly.Seeing that there were more and more people, he glanced at the time. Although he had called his people over and called the police, he didn\u2019t know when the police and their people would arrive. If this continues, after a long time, he was afraid that it will be a problem.Zhuang Yu\u2019s bodyguard, A Dong, finally knew why the buddy who switched to making skewers said that Lu Chengyu was cruel. Looking at those who fell down by Lu Chengyu, he felt that his bodyguard combat effectiveness was not as good as someone\u2019s gentle assistant. The shame of being a bodyguard, he should just follow his buddy to make skewers.Lu Chengyu kicked a rushing bastard, and gasped: \u201cFuck, who did you offend? This is simply a waste of money.\u201d Even if this section is sparsely populated, it is not that there is no car coming, indicating that the main messenger must have used means to prevent those people from coming over for the time being.For example, for things like car accidents, as long as there was a delay, there were enough people to start. But why did these people use knives and rods instead of pistols?With Lu Chengyu\u2019s help, Mu Qirong found it easier to deal with these people. Seeing that there were more and more people, he gasped slightly and said, \u201cTake eldest brother and Xiao Yan away. I\u2019ll be here.\u201d\u201cDamn!\u201d Lu Chengyu watched. Looking around, he thought that let alone leading people to go first, they might be chopped off if they ran even a few steps. He took off his blood-stained suit jacket and threw it on the ground. When someone pounced on him, he slammed the rod and he went down, , seeing this person lying down, he turned around and kicked the other person away, \u201cThere are so many people, we can\u2019t leave at all. When will your people arrive?\u201d\u201cCome on\u201d, Mu Qirong panted heavily and talked to Lu Chengyu, standing back-to-back, there was a drop of blood on his face, and he looked extraordinarily solemn, \u201cYou have good skills.\u201d\u201cWhat I learned is the ability to beat people. It\u2019s different from you.\u201d Lu Chengyu tore off the bow tie from his neck. Seeing someone rushing towards Yan Mu\u2019s car, he hurried to the side with strides, but he hadn\u2019t crossed yet. After two steps, he heard a \u201cbang\u201d and the person who rushed over knelt down.After Lu Chengyu had a meal, he saw Yan Mu stepping out of the car door, holding a black pistol in his hand.The gangsters saw that someone had brought out a gun, and many people were stunned. They just took the money to teach a lesson to this group of rich second generations heirs, but they didn\u2019t expect that some of these rich second generations would be equipped with guns. Looking at Yan Mu, these punks, no one dared to rush forward for a while.\u201cOne step forward, I am not shooting the legs, but the head,\u201d Yan Mu strode blankly to the side of Lu Chengyu and Mu Qirong, \u201cWho gave you the courage to make a move on us?\u201dLu Chengyu blocked it with a calm expression. Yan Mu sneered and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t, anyone telling, who is the person, who asked you to attack?\u201dThe leader tilted his head and glanced at Yan Mu, glanced over the pistol, and lowered his eyelids.\u201cI take care of who you are,\u201d the head gangster spit on the ground, \u201cYou honestly follow Laozi, I will let you go today, or don\u2019t blame the brothers for not being polite.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cYou want to kidnap us, and you have the nerve to talk politely with us\u201d, Mu Qihua followed the car down, sneered, \u201cOne minute and my people are coming, now you can choose to run, or be grabbed by others.\u201dThe leader listened carefully, there was no sound of a police siren, and he mustered up the courage to say: \u201cBrothers, don\u2019t be afraid, they are just bluffing us, now as long as we take people away, we will send it out.\u201dThe charm of money is endless. Yes, for a while, people who were originally worried were eager to try. There was even a person who threw the watermelon knife in his hand at Yan Mu who was holding the gun. Lu Chengyu hurriedly stopped it with an iron rod, but when the steel knife was swung away, the blade bounced on his arm, but he only felt a cold on his arm. When he looked down, the blood had stained the sleeves of his white shirt.His expensive suit was spoiled just like that! He gave the bastards an angry look, wondering if his clothes were expensive?When Yan Mu saw Lu Chengyu\u2019s hand, his eyes darkened suddenly, completely different from his usual. With a sullen face, he shot the knife-throwing gangster without hesitation, and once again frightened the few who wanted to rush forward.Mu Qirong looked at his cousin with a sullen face, with complicated eyes, then looked at Lu Chengyu whose arm was dripping with blood and sighed slightly.At this moment, a row of cars drove towards this side. Someone jumped off the car before the car stopped. The group of people running at the forefront stood in front of a few people, and the others held electric batons and shot them down according to these gangsters. The momentum was menacing and amazing.Seeing that the people had arrived, Yan Mu hurriedly put away his pistol, took off his tie and tied it to Lu Chengyu\u2019s arm, and performed emergency first-aid, \u201cI will take you to the hospital.\u201dLooking at the blood-stained concrete road on the ground. Without hesitation, he took Lu Chengyu to a car that the later group of people drove and did not even say hello to the others.Mu Qihua looked at the car that was driven away by Yan Mu, and looked down at the pool of Lu Chengyu\u2019s blood on the ground, \u201cLeave this to them, and we will go to the hospital.\u201dToday, this thing was not so easy to pass. Mu Qihua liked to eat everything, but he didn\u2019t like to eat grievances. If, he hadn\u2019t insisted on driving with Lu Chengyu and the others this time, he was afraid he would have been abducted long ago.Zhuang Yu and Zhang Zeyun also saw Lu Chengyu\u2019s injury and Mu Ge\u2019s subsequent reaction. They exchanged glances, and after seeing the worry in each other\u2019s eyes, they followed Mu Qihua.Mu Qihua was sitting in the car with a very ugly face, \u201cI decided to go with Xiao Yan and them temporarily.\u201d When he decided to leave with Yan Mu, there were other people around, explaining that the master mind behind this or his helper was at the banquet.\u201cFortunately, Lu Chengyu was here today\u2026\u201d Mu Qihua\u2019s eyes changed several times, and he finally sighed, \u201cI owe him a big favour.\u201d Lu Chengyu was watching Yan Mu\u2019s every move, if it weren\u2019t for him, what would have happened to Xiao Yan. How could Lu Chengyu react in time when the knife was thrown over?After half a minute of silence in the carriage, Mu Qirong frowned and said, \u201cIs it a waste of such a capable person to be an assistant to my cousin?\u201dMu Qihua glared at him: \u201cYou want to dig Xiao Yan\u2019s corner of the wall?\u201d If Xiao Yan heard this\u2026Mu Qirong frowned, but did not argue with Mu Qihua, because his eloquence was never as good as Mu Qihua.\u201cDon\u2019t say this to Xiao Yan from now on\u201d, Mu Qihua coughed dryly. \u201cI think it is good for Lu Chengyu to be Xiao Yan\u2019s assistant.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that Lu Chengyu is not suitable to be Xiao Yan\u2019s assistant?\u201d Mu Qirong asked, \u201cBig brother, what about your principles?\u201dMu Qihua smiled, \u201cI was scared and lost by those gangsters just now.\u201dMu Qirong : \u201c\u2026\u201dNot only the principles are gone, but the integrity is also lost?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 48.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48.1For the first time, Lu Chengyu came to know that Yan Mu could also drive fast. On the endless highway, he used the methods of drifting and accelerating with perfection. When he turned the steering wheel, he looked so powerful like a man, but he was still following the traffic rules. The appearance of strictly observing the traffic rules was completely different, and he was simply shocked by the opponent\u2019s superb driving skills.Intuition told him that Yan Mu seemed to be a bit wrong, so Lu Chengyu honestly sat in the passenger seat with his hand on his arm, watching the car he was sitting in speedily overtake one car after another, but he would always stop when they encountered a traffic light. When they stopped with a crunch at the traffic light, he took a deep breath and said, \u201cBrother Mu, are you showing off your driving skills?\u201d\u201cCover the wound and don\u2019t move it\u201d. Despite the emergency treatment, there was still blood dripping from his arm. Even the seat cushion was stained red. Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu\u2019s increasingly pale face, and the knuckle holding the steering wheel turned white. \u201cThe hospital will be here soon.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine, watch the road, or we will both lie in the hospital.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled. When he was blocked in the alley by a group of people in his last life, he was hurt worse than he is now. Just such a little wound was really nothing.Yan Mu felt that his heart was blocked badly. The more relaxed Lu Chengyu\u2019s expression was, the more uncomfortable he was, as if something caught his heart, and it was tight and painful. As soon as the traffic light passed, he stepped on the gas pedal, and the car flew out like an off-string arrow, leaving a lot of cars behind.Zhang Zeyun had already called his hospital, so the emergency doctors and nurses had been waiting at the entrance of the hospital long ago. They saw a black car rushing in. They looked at the car number and hurriedly carried the stretcher towards it. Yan Mu pulled Lu Chengyu out of the passenger seat, and the speed was if it was a race against time.A middle-aged nurse aunt gave Lu Chengyu a tube of haemostatic medicine neatly, and then the attending doctor took his arm to observe for half a minute and waved his hand: \u201cBring him to the operating room. The patient has injured an artery and needs emergency surgery.\u201dThen Lu Chengyu felt that the sky was spinning, and he was carried into the elevator. He looked at the solemn doctors and nurses around the stretcher. He turned his head and saw Yan Mu running behind the stretcher, with his suit crumpled. He was also full of sweat, and there was no presence of his usual domineering side, let alone the usual glamorous, noble and silent atmosphere he carried.Noting that Lu Chengyu was looking at him, Yan Mu hurriedly squeezed to the side of the stretcher and took his other uninjured arm and said: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, it\u2019s just a minor operation, I will be guarding outside.\u201dLooking at the other party, who was both nervous and worried, Lu Chengyu actually wanted to tell the other party not to be afraid. It was only a matter of getting stabbed by a knife. As long as he didn\u2019t hurt his face and it didn\u2019t make him disabled, he felt that he could still accept it reluctantly.Before being pushed into the operating room, Lu Chengyu stretched out his hand and patted Yan Mu\u2019s hand, \u201cBrother Mu, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be out later.\u201dAfter hearing this, the attending doctor said in a professional tone: \u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to get out for a while. The patient\u2019s family will probably have to wait a little longer. Don\u2019t worry, someone had an amputated arm last time, and our hospital was even able to reconnect it. With our medical skills, such a small injury is not a problem.\u201dAfter that, the attending doctor Sheng felt that Yan Mu\u2019s eyes were very sharp when he saw him, he coughed dryly, turned around and called the anaesthesiologist for administering anaesthesia, then turned around and went into the operating room.Lying on the operating table, Lu Chengyu looked at the operating lamp above his head and listened to the attending doctor talking about the effect of the amputated arm surgery. This was to let him not be nervous. He was silent for a long time and decided to interrupt the other side\u2019s nagging. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not worried.\u201d\u201cHuh? Are you still so awake now?\u201d The attending doctor walked to him and didn\u2019t seem to expect Lu Chengyu to not be affected by anaesthesia. It looked like he didn\u2019t take anaesthesia at all.Several doctors behind him who were discussing the surgical plan heard what he said and followed the attending doctor to Lu Chengyu\u2019s side. Interested, they began to watch Lu Chengyu fixedly. One of them said: \u201cYou are in good spirits, wait for us. During the operation, if you are still awake, remember not to open your eyes.\u201d After all, watching your arm being sewn back and forth, it was still too heavy a taste.Lu Chengyu blinked. Although his mind was awake, he didn\u2019t feel much on his body. He closed his eyes when he heard the doctor\u2019s words and said that he could still fall asleep after fighting. He didn\u2019t want to be awake and sober and see these types of surgical tools shuttled in his flesh.When Mu Qihua and others rushed to the hospital, Lu Chengyu had been pushed into the operating room. Seeing the light on the operating room was on, Mu Qihua looked at his cousin who was standing at the door of the operating room and walked to him and said: \u201cLittle Brother, has Xiao Lu entered the operating room?\u201dYan Mu nodded, without speaking, his eyes still fixed on the door of the operating room.Mu Qihua saw that he didn\u2019t want to speak, so he forced him to sit down on a chair. He couldn\u2019t stand in front of the door of the operating room, all the time. What would it look like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Xiao Lu\u2019s arm will be healed.\u201d Speaking of this, his face sank, \u201cI will find out about this and give you an explanation.\u201dYan Mu looked up at him, a coldness hidden under his calm expression, \u201cI will check too. Since those people dared to do it, they must consider the consequences.\u201dMu Qihua\u2019s heart jumped, looking at his cousin like this, somehow, he remembered the look in his eyes when he saw the bastard being dragged away. At a young age, he ignored all the verbal abuse and anger. Seeing a person looking at an object without emotion, was calm as well as chilling.After so many years, the past had passed for a long time. The young cousin had long since become a calm and rigorous man, and he had never seen his cousin look like this, after that incident when he was young. Today, he felt all those emotions of the other party again, and he remembered those things back then, and suddenly realized that he remembered those things so clearly.After his face changed countless times, he finally just nodded: \u201cI understand.\u201dYan Mu glanced at him, then turned to look at the door of the operating room, there was a certain feeling in his glance that until Lu Chengyu came out, he would not remove his eyes from the gate of the operation theatre.The three people next to Zhang Zeyun frowned upon seeing this scene. Zhuang Yu lowered his voice and said to Zhang Zeyun, \u201cZeyun, there seems to be something wrong with Brother Mu.\u201dLooking at the lights on the operating room, Zhang Zeyun also whispered: \u201cDon\u2019t talk too much, just wait for Xiao Lu to come out.\u201d He hadn\u2019t seen Brother Mu like this for a long time, and as a friend, he didn\u2019t want to see it either.Mu Qirong glanced at the two of them, walked to the side in silence and sat down, watching the doctors and nurses go in and out, and even saw a nurse taking a bag of blood from the blood bank. He frowned and said nothing.A few hours later, the lights in the operating room went out, and several doctors walked out. Before the chief surgeon had time to take off the mask, he saw the young son of the hospital owner and a few other extraordinary young people approaching.Upon seeing this, he hurriedly took off the mask and said: \u201cThe operation was very successful. With careful care, the arm will recover as before. Lifting 100 catties of rice will not be a problem. There will be no sequelae. The patient has not yet woken up. Patient was sent to the intensive care unit. In order to avoid wound infection, try not to have too many people around the patient in next two days.\u201d\u201cThank you\u201d, Zhang Zeyun smiled at the surgeon and others, and then saw Lu Chengyu being pushed out. While coming out, there was another nurse holding an infusion bottle over him.Several people exchanged looks, and finally Mu Qihua said, \u201cXiao Yan, go with Xiao Lu. Let us check today\u2019s affairs first\u2026\u201d Noting that no one was paying attention to him, he looked back and saw that there were people beside him.\u201cBrother Mu has already followed\u201d, Zhuang Yu smiled and pointed to the front, Yan Mu was following behind the surgery cart.Mu Qihua was silent for a moment and continued: \u201cThis time there are some things that came for our Mu family. I am sorry that it hurt you. However, our Mu family will definitely give you an explanation and will not let you be attacked in vain.\u201d\u201cWe are all friends, there is no need to say these kind of words\u201d, Zhang Zeyun said with a smile, \u201cBut the mastermind behind the scenes must still be found out. Otherwise, the knife that hit Xiao Lu would have been in vain, we were really frightened. If we feel like this, how can he not feel aggrieved.\u201d They are all of the same faction. If there was any turmoil in the Mu family, it would also have an impact on their families. Therefore, they couldn\u2019t just be uninvolved as Mu Qihua said. But things couldn\u2019t just go on like this, otherwise how would they gain a foothold in the capital in the future.\u201cAnyway, this time I asked for a big favor.\u201d Mu Qihua thought that there was no problem with the younger brother who had been a special soldier. There should be no problem. How could he know that his opponent was so courageous and almost brainless this time, he sighed. He said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t find out about this matter, I don\u2019t know how Xiao Yan will turn the entire capital city over.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWhen the other people heard this, they fell silent. Although Yan Mu usually didn\u2019t like to get angry, and he was not like other people in the capital, but if he was really provoked, it was a bit scary. You know, people who usually don\u2019t get angry were no different from volcanic eruptions.When Lu Chengyu woke up, it was still dark outside the window. The pain in his arm made his mind unclear. Looking at the arm with the cut, he took a breath, and now the pain was better than at the time of entering the hospital. It still hurt sometimes.\u201cAre you awake?\u201d Yan Mu had been sitting on the side of the bed, because he was wearing a mask, his voice seemed a little dull, as if he was forcibly suppressing something.\u201cBrother Mu\u201d, Lu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu wearing a mask, hat, and gloves. He remembered that he had been stabbed in the back in his previous life, and he had randomly found a clinic doctor to sew him. When he went home that night, what did he do? Well, now the other party\u2019s solemn attitude makes him really uncomfortable, \u201cIs there any water?\u201dYan Mu poured him a glass of glucose water, carefully lifted him up, put a pillow on his back, and passed the water to him after he had settled, \u201cThe doctor said, you have a deep wound in an artery, and you have lost a lot of blood. You need more support.\u201dAfter drinking a few sips of water, Lu Chengyu felt that his throat was not that uncomfortable. He took a look at the ward environment and said, \u201cIs it that serious?\u201d If ordinary people suffered from this kind of injury, they could go home to recover after getting their stitches.\u201cIt\u2019s better to pay more attention,\u201d Yan Mu looked at his gauze-wrapped right arm, thinking that the injury was caused by himself, and his heart became even more uncomfortable. He finally said what he had kept in his heart for a long time. \u201cTake care of yourself.\u201d\u201cIt just a cut on my hand, it\u2019s not that I can\u2019t move my hands and feet. Mu Ge, you are too exaggerated\u201d, Lu Chengyu smiled, who knew that the movement was a little bit bigger, causing the wound on his arm to hurt. He twitched the corner of his mouth and inhaled a cold breath, \u201cYou are talking in such a tone which almost made me think that I can only spend the rest of my life in bed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Yan Mu saw his wound hurt and took the cup from him hurriedly. With the cup in his hand, he said seriously, \u201cI mean\u2026\u201d\u201cMr. Lu is awake?\u201d The attending doctor walked in with two nurses. Seeing that the two people in the ward looked a little wrong, he stopped and asked, \u201cAm I disturbing the two of you?\u201dYan Mu glanced at him blankly, and Lu Chengyu smiled at him. The doctor glanced at the two of them suspiciously. What do these two different attitudes mean?He stepped forward to perform some routine checks on Lu Chengyu and then nodded: \u201cExcept for some excessive blood loss, Mr. Lu\u2019s health is normal. If the wound does not become inflamed in these two days, you can go home and recuperate in three days. Just go to the hospital to change the dressing on time. This Mr. Lu, we have used the best cosmetic thread in the hospital. Not only do you not need to get the stitches removed, but it was also almost impossible for a scar to be left at the site of injury.\u201d\u201cThank you\u201d, Lu Chengyu smiled at the doctor. After the doctors and nurses left, he looked at Yan Mu with a smile, \u201cWhat were you going to tell me?\u201dYan Mu was silent for a moment, and when he had the courage to speak again, the door of the ward was knocked again. Qi Jingfeng walked in hurriedly from outside, and when he saw Lu Chengyu\u2019s pale face, he said, \u201cOh my God, how come you got so badly hurt?\u201dThey were attacked after attending a banquet in the Qi family. If this matter was not investigated clearly, he was afraid that his family would also be implicated. After he inquired about what happened, he exclaimed fortunately. Fortunately, the Mu family boss insisted on going with Mu Ge, and fortunately Xiao Lu had good skills. If people were assassinated or kidnapped soon after they left the gate of the Qi family, they would not be able to cleanse the Qi family even if they jumped into the Yellow River.At this moment, he was extremely thankful that he had invited Xiao Lu to the reception. But now that he saw the pale face of the opponent, he felt a little guilty. If he didn\u2019t ask Xiao Lu to come to the banquet, Xiao Lu would have been spared from this innocent disaster.Qi Jingfeng felt a little embarrassed, kept the fruit in his hand aside, walked to the hospital bed to look Lu Chengyu up and down, and finally put his eyes on Lu Chengyu\u2019s arm, and laughed: \u201cLook at this trouble\u2026 if I knew it, that something like this would happen, I wouldn\u2019t have invited you to the banquet.\u201d\u201cIf Brother Qi knew about this, then this would be troublesome.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and let Qi Jingfeng sit down.\u201cThis is also true, fortunately you were there, otherwise this would have turned out to be a big incident.\u201d Qi Jingfeng sat down on the stool on one side, presumably the mastermind did not expect such a big turn of events, and the source of misfortune for him was that he invited Lu Chengyu to the banquet.If he didn\u2019t invite Lu Chengyu to the banquet, Mu Ge would not come. If Brother Mu did not come to the banquet, Brother Hua and Brother Rong would not come like Brother Mu. If they didn\u2019t go with Mu Ge, they would return in the opposite direction. At that time, the two of them would be attacked on the road\u2026Thinking of the possibility after the event happened, Qi Jingfeng burst into a cold sweat. However, the relationship between Brother Mu and Xiao Lu was really good, and Brother Mu was willing to attend a banquet that he did not like for Xiao Lu.\u201cThere was so much blood from the wound, but now it\u2019s okay,\u201d Yan Mu gave Qi Jingfeng a faint glance, then turned to Lu Chengyu and said, \u201cSince Xiao Qi is here, I\u2019ll go and buy you porridge.\u201dQi Jingfeng looked at him with a horrified expression on his face. Mu Ge never left the ward from beginning to end, that\u2019s impossible right? He glanced at the two of them suspiciously. Was there something he didn\u2019t know that happened?Lu Chengyu nodded, and after tossing for so long, he was also hungry. Looking at this luxurious ward, he sighed with emotion, life was so different this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Was Brother Mu suspecting that this matter was related to the Qi family, should he explain to Brother Mu?\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you must have read it wrong,\u201d Lu Chengyu said with a smile, \u201cIt may be that the incident that happened at night frightened him.\u201dQi Jingfeng: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis kind of reason was not consoling at all. Mu Ge\u2019s personality was not easily frightened. He glanced at the time. It was four o\u2019clock in the morning. He smashed his mouth: \u201cMu Ge treats you really well. He ran out to buy you porridge at four o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s four o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t expect it to be so late. He thought of the noise last night. He was afraid that Yan Mu had not slept in order to guard him, and now he went out to buy porridge himself. In the middle of the night, except for the twenty-four-hour fast-food restaurant, he was afraid that not many would have their door open, which is too worrisome.\u201cNo,\u201d Qi Jingfeng drew the stool closer. \u201cEveryone else went to check the incident at night. Brother Mu shot the gun last night, and the Mu family is smoothening it out.\u201d Although it was used defensively, but the two men had gunshot wounds on their bodies. One of the injuries was quite serious. It would not do if things were spread out.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Brother Mu shooting last night, I\u2019m afraid that things couldn\u2019t be suppressed,\u201d Lu Chengyu frowned, \u201cHow are things now, can it be suppressed?\u201d\u201cSuch a small matter, Mu\u2019s family has no problem suppressing it.\u201d Qi Jingfeng sighed, \u201cFortunately, Brother Hua and Rong did not have an accident, otherwise the capital will be messed up.\u201dLu Chengyu suddenly remembered that at this time in his previous life, there was a famous shooting in Beijing. It was said that two prestigious family sons in Beijing were attacked. After the incident, the two people were seriously injured. They were almost not rescued after being sent to the hospital. In the end, even when they were rescued, one of them became disabled.This incident had caused ups and downs in the capital, and he had heard that many people had been arrested. Because he was still an assistant to a small brokerage company at that time, he didn\u2019t know much about it. He only knew that the atmosphere in the capital was very tense at that time, and even many activities in the entertainment circle were cancelled.When he thought about these two things together, Lu Chengyu could probably understand why those gangsters didn\u2019t have guns, because all the plans of the mastermind behind the scenes were arranged on the way home of the Mu brothers. Who would have known that the Mu brothers suddenly decided to change routes? The mastermind behind the scenes urgently contacted a group of gangsters who didn\u2019t know anything about blocking people, trying to block people halfway through the night and kidnap them.Although this plan was simple and rude, if it succeeded, it would also have been very useful. If the Mu family had no Mu Qihua and Mu Qirong the two brothers, then the Mu family would gradually decline and finally withdraw from the capital stage.\u201cHis heart is sinister.\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed, and then said, \u201cIf this incident has happened, I am afraid that everyone in the capital would be at risk for a while.\u201d\u201cCan you suffer from this kind of loss if you have a temper like Brother Hua?\u201d While mentioning Mu Qihua, Qi Jingfeng was still more fearful. After all, he was the leader of their generation. Although this was the same as Mu Ge, he was a child of another family, but the difference in behaviour between the two was too big, and Mu Ge was still a little cute.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t know what was right or wrong in their circle, but he didn\u2019t ask much. The two of them talked about other things. When Yan Mu came back with the porridge, Qi Jingfeng\u2019s eyelids were fighting sleep.\u201cBrother Mu is back.\u201d Qi Jingfeng stood up, then said to Lu Chengyu, \u201cXiao Lu, take a good rest, I will see you next time.\u201d After saying goodbye to Yan Mu, he left the ward. It was not that he was not calm enough, but Yan Mu\u2019s eyes were too solemn.As soon as he walked to the entrance of the hospital, Qi Jingfeng met the taciturn brother Rong. Seeing that he was still carrying a lunch box in his hand, he couldn\u2019t bear to tell him that Yan Mu had already run out to buy food for Lu Chengyu, so he just stepped forward to talk to him and say hello.\u201cIs Xiao Lu awake?\u201d Mu Qirong saw that only Qi Jingfeng was alone, and added, \u201cAre you alone?\u201d\u201cWith the bodyguards, I told them to wait in the car. Xiao Lu has been awake for a while.\u201d Qi Jingfeng breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Mu Qirong\u2019s attitude toward him was as usual. This at least proved that the Mu family had no doubts about their Qi family.Mu Qirong nodded in satisfaction when he heard the words, and then continued to walk upstairs.Looking at Mu Qirong\u2019s back, Qi Jingfeng suddenly thought, I don\u2019t know if Mu Ge would also give Rong Ge a look like \u201cYou are superfluous\u201d? After drinking the porridge, Lu Chengyu said: \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mu Ge go back and rest.\u201d\u201cI just slept for a while, and I am not sleepy now,\u201d Yan Mu reached out and probed Lu Chengyu\u2019s head. After making sure that he did not have a fever, he sat down on the edge of the bed and said, \u201cNo matter what happens in the future, you must first pay attention to yourself. Your safety is important, I will be very worried if you have an accident.\u201dOutside the ward, Mu Qirong, carrying a large lunch box, was about to knock on the concealed door. After hearing this, he frowned and put his hand down.Lu Chengyu looked down at his gauze-wrapped arm, \u201cBrother Mu, you\u2026\u201d\u201cI always think, if we can live together, how good it would be,\u201d Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu\u2019s clean forehead. \u201cThe first time you turned your head and smiled at me at Baiweixuan, I thought, how could a man smile so beautifully.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLu Chengyu seriously recalled how he felt when he met Yan Mu for the first time, and his only thought was about his heartache at spending more than eight thousand dollars.\u201cLater I found out that you smile so beautifully to everyone, as if there is nothing worth turning your face away,\u201d Yan Mu was silent for a moment. \u201cIf we live together, you can laugh as much as you want, or get angry if you want to be angry. You won\u2019t always pay attention to whether you behave perfectly. I can cook for you and you won\u2019t have to eat out every day. There is a garden you like outside my house. Would you\u2026 Would you like to be with me?\u201dSilence was waiting for him. Deathly silence.Yan Mu\u2019s heart sank a little bit. He knew that he was impulsive, but after seeing Lu Chengyu\u2019s injury and him still smiling mildly, he couldn\u2019t wait to take the person back to his home and raise him like a son.Lu Chengyu\u2019s silence seemed to be the best answer to this question. He felt a little sore in his throat: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, then let me take care of you for a while. Your injury is still not healed\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like cooking. \u201cLu Chengyu said, \u201cI don\u2019t like to clean up the house yet.\u201dLooking at Lu Chengyu in confusion, \u201c?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m lazy and greedy, my eyes are small, and I love to hold grudges,\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu with a smile, \u201cWhy do you want to be with me?\u201dYan Mu shook his head: \u201cYou are born to be particular about food and drink, and love to eat and drink. Naturally, you can eat and I can make it, which means that we are born to be a pair.\u201d His cheeks were slightly red, \u201cI like you, and you are lazy. I like it too.\u201dAfter saying this, he looked at Lu Chengyu anxiously, as if a single word from the other party was enough to determine his life.Lu Chengyu looked at his eyes, wanting to see his heart through them. However, no matter how he looked at it, all he could see was his own reflection in the opponent\u2019s eyes.Outside the door, Mu Qirong put down his lunch box and left the ward silently and went to the hospital garden. Thinking of what his cousin said, and remembering Lu Chengyu\u2019s silence, he couldn\u2019t help lighting up a cigarette and smoking.He couldn\u2019t stand the scene of confession the most. The scene was too nervous and he didn\u2019t dare to watch it, but what if Lu Chengyu was unwilling to accept his cousin?Also, the cousin liked a man, could grandpa accept it?After thinking about it, he felt that he had become more anxious. Then how could he help his cousin to plead with his grandfather? Also, if Lu Chengyu doesn\u2019t agree to his cousin, how could he comfort his broken cousin?Life as a brother was really hard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 49.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49.1Lu Chengyu thought that Yan Mu would confess to him in a particularly sensational and touching way, but reality told him that he was unexpected and unpretentious.He could confirm that he had a good impression of Yan Mu, but this good impression did not seem to have reached the stage of love. Thinking about it carefully, he was still somewhat different with Yan Mu, but this difference was not enough to prove that this mood was love.He was not an honest person, but he never lied about his emotions. He looked at Yan Mu with uneasy sternness. After a long silence, he said: \u201cI know your heart, but I am not sure of my own feelings. This is right. I am not fair.\u201d\u201cThere is no such thing as fairness and unfairness in feelings.\u201d Yan Mu said, looking at him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try? Maybe you will soon find that I am the best person for you.\u201dLu Chengyu touched his nose and said: \u201cWhat if I find that you are not the most suitable person for me?\u201d In fact, from a certain angle, Yan Mu was also a very confident person.Yan Mu said after a long silence: \u201cI won\u2019t let this happen by any chance.\u201d He thought about various possibilities, the only thing he didn\u2019t want to think about was Lu Chengyu getting separated from him after being with him. Sometimes if you don\u2019t get it, you won\u2019t have that big a problem, but once you get it, you never want to lose it again.Lu Chengyu stretched out his hand and patted him on the shoulder: \u201cThen you work hard, I am optimistic about you.\u201dMaybe, he could really get something from Yan Mu that he had never had in his previous life, not because he was too easily moved, but because of the other person\u2019s eyes which were too sincere.Yan Mu\u2019s expression first changed from dazed to contemplative, and then from contemplative to ecstasy. Because Lu Chengyu was injured, he finally grabbed the quilt covering Lu Chengyu twice with excitement: \u201cYou mean\u2026 you want to be with me?\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and hooked his fingers at him. He was obedient and leaned his head over.\u201cMy wise sir, why are you stupid now?\u201d Lu Chengyu scratched Yan Mu\u2019s chin with his index finger, then yawned, and pointed to the companion bed next to him, \u201cIt\u2019s almost bright, you now get in bed and go to sleep, or I will change my decision.\u201d After speaking, he slowly retracted into the quilt, not forgetting to pull the quilt, leaving his injured arm outside the quilt.Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu who was already lying in the quilt with red face, stiffly stepped forward to tidy up the quilt for Lu Chengyu, and then lay down on the companion bed next to him. After lying down for a few minutes, he remembered that he didn\u2019t take off his coat, and got up and took off his coat. After covering himself with the quilt, he wondered why was the scene of his confession and the result of the confession so strange?Was he moved or embarrassed?Sure enough, TV shows were all deceptive.Mu Qirong, who returned from outside the door, silently closed the door of the ward. He did not see his tall brother being teased by Xiao Lu, nor did he see his cousin walking in a daze. He felt very sleepy. He needed to go home and sleep, his eyes were beginning to have hallucinations.After Yan Mu turned on the bed for an entire hour, he heard the sound of cleaners mopping the floor and nurses passing by. He tried hard to calm his mood, but the facts proved that his previous calmness were all locked out of this ward.In the end, he simply adjusted to a position that was comfortable and conducive to observing Lu Chengyu\u2019s sleeping face. He stared at Lu Chengyu for a few hours, and the more he looked at it, the more he felt that Lu Chengyu looked more beautiful. Even the dull hair pressed out by the sleeping posture seemed better than others.When Lu Chengyu woke up the next day, it was already around nine o\u2019clock in the morning. He looked at Yan Mu who had a pair of dark circles under his eyes, but his spirit was very good. However, sometimes it was really interesting to see the other person flustered, and he couldn\u2019t help but want to tease him.Yan Mu went out to answer the phone several times, and Lu Chengyu guessed that it might be related to the attack. These things involved secrets between the families, so he never asked, but judging from Yan Mu\u2019s reaction, this matter may not be simple.\u201cXiao Lu, I need to go out and do some things. Xiao Zhuang and Zeyun will come over in the afternoon. If you have anything, let them do it.\u201d Yan Mu prepared several fruits that Lu Chengyu could reach. He took the cell phone from a sterile bag and gave it to Lu Chengyu, \u201cCall me if you have anything.\u201dLu Chengyu took a look at the cell phone and found that it was a new cell phone. The model was very similar to what Yan Mu was using now. After discovering this, he raised his eyebrows and glanced at Yan Mu.\u201cYour phone was broken last night,\u201d Yan Mu explained when Lu Chengyu was looking at him, \u201cI have transferred your phone number to this new phone.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled at him. Laughing, he put the phone to hand, \u201cGo and do your work, I\u2019m fine here, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cThen you must be careful,\u201d Yan Mu hesitated and walked to the door, then looked back at Lu Chengyu a few times. He made a big stride out of the hospital. As soon as he walked out of the hospital door, the warmth on his face disappeared. Thinking of Lu Chengyu\u2019s bloody arm, the coldness in his eyes could no longer be concealed.Because of the identity of the Mu family brothers and the involvement of several other family heirs, this attack caused a lot of trouble and the thorough investigation was also very vigorous. It\u2019s a pity that the little gangsters caught didn\u2019t even know who was behind the scenes, and the source of the phone number that contacted them and the down payment funds transferred to them were also unknown, and the matter was not easy to investigate.The truck blocking their road was also stolen by the gangsters. It had nothing to do with the master behind the scenes, and this clue could not be used.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgBut to everyone\u2019s surprise, the call recording was actually saved on the phone of the bully leader. Perhaps it was because the employer was too generous and the bully was afraid that after he paid the first payment, the latter would not be given to them. The conversation was recorded as a means to threaten the other party to pay obediently in the future.Unfortunately, after the expert called up this audio, it was found that the voice of the other party was not normal, and there was a suspicion of using a voice changer, so it was not so easy to deal with this matter as soon as possible.Yan Mu sat next to Mu Qihua, listening to what the investigators had explained, and blankly pushed aside the pile of information in front of him: \u201cIn the boundary of the capital, someone who dares to attack innocent people so boldly shows that these people already don\u2019t have the law in their eyes[1]. This kind of thing has already made a lot of noise outside. If you don\u2019t find it out, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not easy to give you an explanation.\u201d\u201cIf such a bad incident occurs in a country\u2019s capital, and the case cannot be solved quickly, who will dare to go out willingly,\u201d Mu Qihua glanced at Yan Mu, then softened his words, \u201cHowever, I believe that your ability to solve crimes will not be any less for this matter.\u201d The case team leader laughed twice, but he scolded the eighteen generations of the ancestors of the master behind the scenes in his mind. What kind of brains and guts dared to attack Mu, Yan, Zhuang, and Zhang family heirs blatantly. If something happened to any of these four family heirs, the capital would be turned upside down. Wasn\u2019t this forcing them to die?The person at the top of this matter had already spoken, and they had to conduct a serious, urgent and vigorous investigation. A thorough investigation represented the attitude of everyone above. This was to get people out regardless of all consequences, otherwise these families may be unhappy. But with them little shrimps, how easy was it to do these things?\u201cYou all, please be rest assured, our team members have been carefully investigating the case, and I believe that the case will come to light soon.\u201d The case team leader said with anger on his face, \u201cNot to mention the capital, it is not allowed to happen in other places. Ignoring the laws and regulations, the plot of this incident is too bad, and the impact is too great. If criminals are not severely punished, how should we face the people!\u201dMu Qihua nodded reservedly. He seemed to be very satisfied with what the case leader said. He lightly touched the table with his right index finger, and said with a smile: \u201cI have some suspicious personnel\u2019s information here. It is better to take a look at it. After all, to maintain national security, everyone has the responsibility, right?\u201d\u201cYes, yes,\u201d the team leader nodded with a smile, and took a pile of information from the bodyguard behind Mu Qihua. After only reading a few pages, his complexion changed several times. Looking at Mu Qihua with difficulty, \u201cMister Mu, you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Mu Qihua looked at each other with a puzzled expression, \u201cThese materials are useless?\u201dThe group leader wiped the sweat from his forehead, and finally gritted his teeth and said, \u201cThank you, Mister Mu, for your help. The information you provided has really helped us a lot.\u201d He put the information in the drawer and solemnly said, \u201cWe will definitely investigate this matter carefully.\u201d\u201cIn that case, we brothers won\u2019t bother you in handling the case,\u201d Mu Qihua stood up slowly, turned and glanced at Yan Mu behind him, \u201cWhat else does cousin have to say?\u201d\u201cI believe the team leader, there is nothing to say, but I must remind the team leader.\u201d Yan Mu leaned over the team leader expressionlessly and said a few words. After seeing the team leader\u2019s face changed, he slowly stood up straight.\u201cThanking Mr. Yan for his trust, please be rest assured, I will give the people an explanation within three days,\u201d his face was a little stiff, but he tried his best to make himself smile better, so as not to make the other party think he had any dissatisfaction.\u201cYeah.\u201d Yan Mu nodded, turned around and walked out of the police bureau. As for the expression of the team leader, it had nothing to do with him.Sending away the two evil gods, the group leader\u2019s feet were soft, and he sat back on the chair. In this case, the above-mentioned forces had intervened, so they need to worry about a lot of things to find out the truth of the matter. Seeing this attitude from the Mu family now, he did not dare to oppose the Mu family at all.And what the grandson of the Mu family said, he knew exactly what he was doing behind his back. The other party had his own handle. If he didn\u2019t want to follow Mu\u2019s family, there was no way out. In this case, it was better to follow Mu\u2019s family and bet on the risk of wealth, and he would bet on a situation that could not be easily changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The appearance did not look much different from a normal vehicle, but the inside was explosion-proof and anti-attack protected. It could be seen that after this incident, how important the safety of the younger generation had become?He glanced at his cousin next to him, \u201cI remember you were not interested in politics.\u201d\u201cNothing like that.\u201d Yan Mu said calmly: \u201cIt\u2019s just a few bank accounts.\u201dMu Qihua was taken aback, and then his gaze became complicated. Xiao Mu smiled and said: \u201cFor this case, you have paid a lot of money.\u201d After being so low-key for so many years, it was not a waste.\u201cYou are my relatives, being low-key or not is not as important as you,\u201d Yan Mu looked at Mu Qihua, of course, \u201cLife is important, everything else can be prioritized.\u201dMu Qihua was taken aback for a moment, and then laughed out, righteously. Reaching out to pat Yan Mu\u2019s head, he remembered that this cousin had grown up a long time ago. He sighed, \u201cI really can\u2019t bear it.\u201dYan Mu glanced at him: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve been in the capital all the time.\u201dThe emotion that had just risen in Mu Qihua\u2019s heart was immediately broken up by this relentless sentence. He looked at Yan Mu helplessly, \u201cDid anyone say you are boring? I had no choice but to dislike it.\u201dYan Mu continued to hold a dumb face, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201dMu Qihua: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis kind of stinky disease that is not ashamed but proud must be the part of Yan\u2019s crooked gene that was passed to him by the YansTaking Yan Mu all the way to the hospital, Mu Qihua looked at the hospital door, and after a moment of silence, he asked: \u201cXiao Yan, does the other party know what you want?\u201dYan Mu glanced over at Mu Qihua\u2019s face. He nodded slowly.Mu Qihua\u2019s brows jumped. Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t know at the banquet. Why did the other party know now, and he coughed, \u201cWhat did he say?\u201dYan Mu looked at him hesitantly.\u201cDo not bullshit, I\u2019m not the Queen Mother to wreck a pair of mandarin ducks[1]!\u201d The sceptical eyes of the cousin stimulated him, \u201cHe must have said no!\u201d\u201cQueen Mother designates the mandarin ducks, so she doesn\u2019t mind,\u201d Yan Mu saw that Mu Qihua\u2019s complexion was not good, and his conversation changed. \u201cXiao Lu agreed to try with me.\u201d\u201cTry it?\u201d Mu Qihua raised his eyebrows, a little unhappy, \u201cYou are so good, he still wants to try?\u201d But then he thought of Lu Chengyu\u2019s life-saving grace to him, and the other party was seriously injured to save his cousin. Suddenly, his voice dropped a few more times, and Mu Qihua said uncomfortably, \u201cSince this is the case, you should be more careful and don\u2019t play around. For a fox like Lu Chengyu, your mind is more important than anything.\u201d Regardless of Yan Mu\u2019s reaction, he turned his head and told the driver to drive away.Yan Mu snorted after getting out of the car. After a few seconds, he took the pork bone soup he bought on the road and walked to the hospital.After drinking the pork bone soup that Yan Mu brought back, Lu Chengyu called Zhang Shuo and talked to the other party about the shooting of the new film. In the end, the topic of who the protagonist should be was changed to the day when the opening would be auspicious.The basic actors of the two scripts had been set, the only difference was the male lead in the small fresh script. The first-line superstar was liked by Zhang Shuo for the role. People should not look at Zhang Shuo\u2019s overnight fame, one didn\u2019t know if he could be a powerful director in the future; Zhang Dao looks down on the self-recommended actors.Lu Chengyu thought about the character settings in the script, and finally said: \u201cI think it\u2019s quite suitable to have him as the actor. The director can let him try. If it is not suitable, we will continue to look for an actor.\u201d He did not say anything, also to prevent the other party from being embarrassed.Zhang Shuo was worrying about the actor. Hearing that Lu Chengyu had a suitable recommendation on the phone, he hurriedly asked, \u201cWho is it?\u201dBut after hearing the person recommended by the other party, Zhang Shuo hesitated, \u201cThe appearance of this Zhong Zhenghan is pretty appropriate, but this person\u2019s acting skills\u2026\u201d It was not that Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s acting skills were bad, but Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s performances are almost all TV dramas, and there were few screen works. Even if there were movies he starred in, they were only supporting roles, and they had never been selected for big awards.Lu Chengyu understood Zhang Shuo\u2019s concerns. Although he trusted Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s acting skills, the other party was not clear about it: \u201cAnyway, if you invite people to try it, you won\u2019t suffer. If it doesn\u2019t work, we will hold another internal audition and we will always find the right person.\u201d The other party had already spoken to this point, Zhang Shuo no longer insisted, and immediately agreed. Mr. Lu was not an unreliable person, maybe that Zhong Zhenghan was really suitable?After hanging up the phone, Lu Chengyu looked up and saw Yan Mu\u2019s mouth closed tightly. Although his expression did not change, he could still feel the other party\u2019s depression. After a little thought, he understood. He patted the edge of the bed and said, \u201cBrother Mu, come here, sit down, let\u2019s talk.\u201d Since he had promised to try with Yan Mu, he will not let the other party get sad for unnecessary things.Yan Mu sat silently on the edge of the bed, peeling the melon seeds in his hand, and put the kernels on a clean plate after peeling one out.\u201cI promise to try with you, so I won\u2019t be ambiguous with others.\u201d Lu Chengyu said seriously, \u201cI can make jokes about everything else, but I always think that things like feelings cannot withstand deception and concealment.\u201cI won\u2019t either.\u201d Yan Mu looked at the melon seeds on the plate, \u201cI confessed to like you with the desire to live with you all my life.\u201d After saying this, he handed the melon seeds to Lu Chengyu.Looking at the whole plate of melon seeds, Lu Chengyu was a little surprised. Even if two people\u2019s names were written on the marriage certificate, they may not spend their entire lives together. Where did Yan Mu have the courage to say such things?After taking the plate, Lu Chengyu ate a few and stuffed some into Yan Mu\u2019s mouth. Seeing Yan Mu eating the melon seeds expressionlessly, he smiled: \u201cIt\u2019s better to let time prove that we can walk a long way.\u201d He didn\u2019t believe in sweet words but believed in time. Because true feelings would not disappear because of time, and only get stronger as the time passed.Yan Mu nodded, and then continued to peel melon seeds. The atmosphere was incomparably harmonious, and the appearance between the two was nothing like discussing major events in life.Two days later, dozens of people of the Yao family in the capital city from top to bottom were arrested on suspicion of embezzlement and bribery of huge assets. Even some people who depended on the Yao family were involved in the corruption case. Because the incident was so huge, many people turned their attention from the attack to the Yao family. Who knew that the Li family in the capital was involved again that night, and many people were arrested overnight for inspection, and the entire capital almost fell apart.Lu Chengyu still didn\u2019t know much about what was going on outside, but there was a lot of news about Yao and Li families on his mobile phone. He guessed that the matter may be related to the Mu\u2019s family. It seemed that after this time, the situation in Beijing will change again.After staying in the hospital for a few days, he felt that staying in the hospital was a waste of medical resources. So he expressed a strong desire to leave the hospital. Yan Mu had to go through the discharge procedures for him. It\u2019s just that after he was discharged from the hospital, he returned not to his home, but to Yan Mu\u2019s villa.Zhuang Yu, Zhang Zeyun, and Qi Jingfeng, who accompanied Lu Chengyu to leave the hospital, looked at Yan Mu\u2019s house in surprise. When they came the other day, the house was not like this. Why did he add a lot of things today?\u201cBrother Mu, are you really going to start living a home life of cooking by yourself?\u201d Qi Jingfeng turned around in the kitchen and said with some emotion, \u201cThis house is really not like a place where a bachelor lives.\u201dZhuang Yu looked at it. After seeing Yan Mu who was pouring water for Lu Chengyu, he glanced sympathetically at Qi Jingfeng and thought, Ignorant mortal, the owner of this house is not a bachelor anymore.\u201cBrother Mu, since you are preparing to cook for yourself now, if you have time, let\u2019s have a meal,\u201d Qi Jingfeng leaned comfortably on the sofa, \u201cI\u2019m tired of the restaurant downstairs in my company.\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d Zhang Zeyun smiled, \u201cI like to go home to eat when I have time.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgZhuang Yu also nodded quickly: \u201cYes, I don\u2019t need it anymore, I quite like the restaurant outside the company.\u201dQi Jingfeng looked suspiciously at the two of them: \u201cDidn\u2019t you always say that the food made by Brother Mu is delicious, aren\u2019t you tired of the food cooked by the restaurant and the nanny?\u201dZhuang Yu and Zhang Zeyun said in unison, \u201cYou must have remembered it wrong.\u201dQi Jingfeng: \u201d \u2026\u201dLu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu\u2019s friends with a smile, took the cup that Yan Mu handed him with a smile, took a sip and said, \u201cIf you like Brother Qi, you can often come to play over.\u201dYan Mu also said with a sip: \u201cJingfeng may not be able to come often, his company is far away from us.\u201d After saying this, he slowly looked towards Qi Jingfeng, \u201cRight?\u201dQi Jingfeng nodded in a daze, and after thinking about it, he also felt that Mu Ge was right. His company was indeed far away from Mu Ge\u2019s house. What\u2019s more, he was often out of the company and liked to go out to play. He wanted to come to Mu Ge\u2019s side for food. It didn\u2019t seem to work. \u201cYes, it\u2019s not going to work that way.\u201d Looking at Qi Jingfeng like this, Zhuang Yu suddenly felt superior in IQ.After Lu Chengyu settled down, Zhuang Yu and others left with excuses. Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t sleep well in the hospital. After lunch, he didn\u2019t do anything else, so he went straight back to the room to sleep.Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu, who was already asleep on the bed. After standing still by the bed for a long time, he finally slowly bent down and touched the corner of his beautiful lips. Seeing that the other party didn\u2019t wake up, he hesitated for a while, and quickly clicked on his lips.The gentle touch made his cheeks flush, and while the other party was still asleep, he clenched his fists and walked out the door in a mess.After the footsteps disappeared, Lu Chengyu slowly opened his eyes, looked at the direction of the door and touched the corner of his lips, with a slight smile in his eyes.There was a place in the capital that specialized in holding high-level criminals. After the leaders of the Yao family and the Li family were arrested, they were detained there.Yan Mu walked into the dim room and looked at the few people sitting on the chairs. A smile suddenly appeared on his face, \u201cAm I disturbing your lunchtime?\u201dMu Qihua and Mu Qirong sitting on the side, saw his smile, and both of their expressions changed.Fuck, Godzilla had evolved!After Lu Chengyu woke up from a nap and went downstairs, he found that Yan Mu was no longer at home. He knew that Yan Mu had been busy investigating the attack in recent days, so he didn\u2019t call the other party, but turned on the TV and sat down on the sofa with his legs crossed.After turning on the TV, a TV series starring Zhong Zhenghan was playing on the screen. The Zhong Zhenghan in white clothes and blue silk was indeed a mess. He remembered that there was the other party\u2019s private number in his cell phone, and after thinking about it, he called the other party.In the brokerage company, Zhong Zhenghan hung up the phone with a complicated complexion, and looked at his cell phone without speaking for a long time. Seeing him like this, Wang Song, his agent, thought he was in trouble again, and asked with a bitter face, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIf you find out that your new friend is a local tyrant, what would you do?\u201d Zhong Zhenghan didn\u2019t expect that Lu Chengyu would invite him to audition, and he was still the male number one in Zhang Shuo\u2019s new works, which had been in the limelight recently. What surprised him even more was that the investor in this movie turned out to be Lu Chengyu himself.\u201cOf course it is to hug the thigh decisively!\u201d Wang Song\u2019s expression of dead parents suddenly turned into ecstasy, \u201cYou know, it is not shameful to hold the thigh of a local tyrant. It is shameful that you can\u2019t hold it even if you want to hug it!\u201d\u201cOh, The other party has already given me the thigh.\u201d Zhong Zhenghan couldn\u2019t bear to look at his manager\u2019s unscrupulous face, \u201cI\u2019m going to participate in the audition for Zhang Shuo\u2019s New Opera Man as the male lead tomorrow. Remember to arrange a time for me.\u201cZhang Shuo?\u201d Wang Song was taken aback, \u201cWhich Zhang Shuo?\u201d Was it the one who was popular recently? The thigh was a little too thick this time.\u201cIt\u2019s the one you are thinking about,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan thought for a while, \u201cThe other party just asked me to audition. Whether it can be finalized or not is decided by the director. Regardless of whether it can be done or not, you have to keep your mouth shut. This is someone\u2019s thigh. If you offend him, you won\u2019t be able to mess with him in the future.\u201dWang Song suddenly looked serious and nodded: \u201cI understand.\u201d Zhong Zhenghan was looking forward to tomorrow with hope, while the leaders of the Yao family and the Li family who were arrested were now desperate. They thought that the Mu family\u2019s descendants were terrible enough, but they didn\u2019t expect the Mu family\u2019s grandson to be so scary.Who the hell told them the heir of the Yan family was rigorous and serious, calm and courteous?!All of them were fucking scammers!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was not because the person being interrogated had a stiff mouth, but because they found that their cousin had emotional problems. It was like returning to a certain period of time when they were young. They were very worried.The heir of the Li family was being dragged by Yan Mu to the bright light at the moment, because his eyes couldn\u2019t bear such a big irritation, his face was covered with tears.The light of this kind of lamp was very strong, even if he closes his eyes he could feel the penetrating power of the light, not to mention that Yan Mu forcibly opened his eyes. Several other people were also tossed aside like this, and they were all being honest. Keeping aside the atmosphere, they dare not be anything but honest. The interrogators were all from the Mu family. Seeing these hard-mouthed people being tossed like this, they still felt a little refreshed. They had learned the hard-talking skills of these people before.But the Mu family brothers were not so happy in their hearts. What kind of person Yan Mu usually was, they knew in their hearts that he would use these methods showed that he was really angry and his emotions were on the verge of losing control.Yan Mu threw the people back on the stool, took a long stride and sat down behind the lamp, and scanned those people coldly. He put the file on the table and patted, \u201cIf you guys don\u2019t want to explain, we can continue to play this game.\u201d\u201cYou are illegally extracting a confession, I won\u2019t say it.\u201d Li Jia was thrown back to the chair, covering his eyes, and said in horror, \u201cDon\u2019t think that your Mu family in this capital city can cover the sky with one hand.\u201d\u201cOur Mu family has never done so. I want to be the one who covers the sky with one hand.\u201d Yan Mu threw the file back on the table with a snap, and saw Li Jia shrinking backwards in fright by his actions. He sneered and turned his head to look at the corner with no sound. Then he looked at Yao Bin and said, \u201cYou two have done this kind of thing in the capital, and that is a big taboo. Who dares to protect you in the capital?\u201d With so many people in the capital, everyone had offspring, and who dared to accept this happening to their offspring? What the Yao and Li family did, it simply touched the nerves of the families in the capital.Yao Bin squeezed the chair under him in horror. Seeing Yan Mu\u2019s face filled with disdain, he braced himself and said: \u201cYou are the king and the loser, your Mu family was saved by your luck. If it wasn\u2019t for your Mu family brothers changing the route temporarily, you think it would still be your turn as the grandson of the Mu family to play here!\u201d\u201cKing and loser?\u201d Yan Mu\u2019s eyes suddenly chilled. He stepped forward and kicked the person off the chair, bending over and grabbing Yao Bin\u2019s clothes, like dragging a dead dog, pushed Yao Bin\u2019s head against the bright light, \u201cDo you think you can carry things through with a hard mouth? I tell you, anyone involved in this matter can\u2019t escape.\u201dThe person in his hand was already trembling at this time, Yan Mu threw the person aside in annoyance, took a few tissues from the table and slowly wiped his hands, \u201cI have already handed over the things you did in the past to the top. The people under you, who have learned the desire for glory so well, don\u2019t think how hard their mouths are, your Yao family and Li family are already gone.\u201dYao Bin was blinded by the bright light. After hearing Yan Mu\u2019s words, he roared: \u201cEven if we are gone, what do you think you are, nothing but the grandson of the Mu family, do you think that since there is a Mu character in your name that you belong to the Mu family?!\u201d As soon as he finished saying this, he felt that his back was heavy, his whole body was crushed on the ground, and his neck was also heavily pressed.Mu Qihua looked at Yao Bin\u2019s throwing posture with a smile, and he pressed his hand and saw that the other person\u2019s expression became painful with satisfaction, \u201cWe don\u2019t need you to talk nonsense about our Mu family. You don\u2019t know the truth. The more you speak, the faster you will die?\u201dGrabbing Yao Bin\u2019s hair and hitting his head hard on the ground a few times, Mu Qihua smiled and let go, clapped his hands and stood up and said, \u201cWhat you committed, the evidence is conclusive. We are here to see how embarrassed you are.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Li Jia next to him wanted to rush to arrest Mu Qihua, and was quickly pressed by other interrogators in the room. Going down, even moving a little finger was difficult.Mu Qihua didn\u2019t look at Li Jia, and turned to look at the silent Yan Mu: \u201cXiao Yan, don\u2019t worry about these bastards.\u201dYan Mu shook his head indifferently, but at this time Yao Bin began to yell at him, \u201cYou think I\u2019m afraid of you, a coward who likes men!\u201d\u201cBang!\u201d The stool cracked on Yao Bin\u2019s back. Yan Mu looked at Yao Bin, who was curled up in pain, with a blank face. After a long while, he uttered two words, \u201cHands slippery.\u201d After saying this, he bent down and picked up another stool.\u201cXiao Yan!\u201d Mu Qihua found that Yan Mu\u2019s emotions were getting worse and worse, and wanted to reach out to stop Yan Mu, but before he had time to meet Yan Mu, he saw Yan Mu once again raise the stool and hit Yao Bin\u2019s arm heavily.Yao Bin\u2019s cries sharply stimulated his eardrums, making Mu Qihua\u2019s brain rumble. Looking at the icy eyes, his palms burst into cold sweat.On one side, Li Jia had already shrunk to one side in fright, and he didn\u2019t dare to move without being held by others. He probably wouldn\u2019t resist what the Mu family asked him to do now. It was not that he is too courageous, but that the grandson of the Mu family was simply a fucking devil.Just when everyone thought Yan Mu would continue to do it, somebody\u2019s cell phone rang, and the Mu brothers were taken aback at the same time. Who would bring the cell phone to an interrogation, and the cell phone was also not muted?Then they saw that the moment Yan Mu took out the phone, the temperature on his face rose by dozens of degrees, and his tone softened.\u201cXiao Lu?\u201d Yan Mu glanced at Yao Bin, who had become honest on the ground, and the corner of his mouth was slightly hooked up, \u201cNo, I will be back soon.\u201d After hanging up the phone, Yan Mu picked up one side of his jacket and patted it. He patted the sawdust on his trouser legs and said: \u201cBig cousin, second cousin, I\u2019m going home.\u201dMu Qirong nodded, seeing that Yan Mu had recovered to his usual appearance, \u201cGo back, be careful on the road.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d After Yan Mu finished speaking, he glanced at Li Jia again, saw him shrinking his head to his chest, and went out with a sneer. The hurried appearance made the two brothers of the Mu family sigh together.\u201cMinister Mu, this\u2026\u201d A policeman looked at the messy interrogation room embarrassedly. Although during the interrogation, private use of various methods was not a special case, such as not giving food or water, and not allowing them to go to the bathroom or sleep to ask questions. But after all, there was much attention to this matter, and it was not good to go out like this.\u201cYao Bin committed suicide by jumping off the building in fear of sin.\u201d Although Mu Qihua smiled gently on his face, what he said was dark and scary, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the arrest of them went so smoothly this time, which means that no one can protect them.\u201dThis sentence determined the life and death of Yao Bin, and Li Jia next to Mu Qihua looked over. He was so scared that his legs turned soft. Before Mu Qihua had time to speak, he collapsed and yelled: \u201cI will say everything.\u201d\u201cIt would be fine for a long time. Don\u2019t learn from Yao Bin. After all, this person is still dead. It\u2019s better to live.\u201d Mu Qihua glanced at Yao Bin, who had passed out in pain, and his smile became brighter and brighter.The relationship between the Yao and Mu family had not been very good. In recent years, none of the Yao family\u2019s juniors had been able to grasp it. Unexpectedly, the Yao family and the Li family hooked up together and came up with such a bad idea. No matter how stupid this idea was, but if the plan was successful, their Mu family would be over. How could their elderly grandfather bear such a blow?Therefore, if the Yao and Li families dared to do such a thing, he must let them understand what it meant to regret.After Yan Mu returned home and opened the door, he smelled a faint smell of rice and hurriedly put down the fruits and vegetables in his hand, and eagerly looked at Lu Chengyu who was sitting on the sofa, \u201cYour injury is still not healed, this is not what you should do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I just made the porridge, and I can\u2019t do anything else.\u201d Lu Chengyu glanced at his injured arm, \u201cNow, I am waiting for you to come home and cook.\u201d\u201cCome home\u201d As far as, it related to Yan Mu, it was just from the company to the place where he lived. Now that he heard Lu Chengyu mention these two words, he was suddenly surprised that these two words sounded so good that it made people feel warm. He took off his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and said, \u201cYou can watch TV for a while, just wait.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and nodded. After a while, the sound of cutting vegetables came from the kitchen. He didn\u2019t have any new programs to watch on TV. He walked to the door of the kitchen, saw Yan Mu wearing an apron, couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cThe appearance of Brother Mu wearing an apron looks really handsome.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgYan Mu saw him appear at the door of the kitchen, so he said. \u201cWe live together, how do we live without cooking?\u201d He turned on the cooker hood before putting the oil in the pot, \u201cLast time I saw you like scrambled eggs with tomatoes, so when I came back just now, I bought some fresh ones.\u201dListening to Yan Mu\u2019s voice and watching him earnestly cook, Lu Chengyu took a deep breath, but the smile on his face became softer and softer, \u201cBy the way, what about the plan to inspect the branch this week?\u201d\u201cI have moved the inspection plan to next month.\u201d After the fried tomatoes and scrambled eggs were in the pot, Yan Mu washed the pot with water and started to make homemade tofu. \u201cThe branch inspection can go anytime. Your wound hasn\u2019t healed now, how can you go?\u201dLu Chengyu wanted to let Yan Mu go by himself, but looking at the other side\u2019s serious profile, in the end he just said, \u201cWell, I will heal from the injury as soon as possible.\u201dYan Mu turned his head. He gave him an admiring look, and then continued cooking. After the dishes were done, the porridge was also cooked.When the two of them finished their dinner and sat on the sofa to watch TV together, they suddenly realized that they were really comfortable with each other. Lu Chengyu leaned on the soft sofa cushions and adjusted himself to a comfortable posture. Although he was watching TV, he could feel Yan Mu peeking at him from time to time.Halfway through the TV show, he finally couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cBrother Mu, if you want to watch, just watch. Anyway, I won\u2019t lose a piece of flesh.\u201dYan Mu\u2019s face became stiff, and then he quickly turned his head and pretended to watch TV seriously. The appearance of the TV was even more suspicious.Lu Chengyu jumped off the sofa and stood in front of Yan Mu. Seeing that the opponent\u2019s posture became stiffer and stiffer, he leaned down abruptly, reached out and lifted Yan Mu\u2019s chin. Before the other party had reacted, he leaned down and kissed him on the chin. Then he touched the corner of his lips and smiled ambiguously, \u201cYou watch TV slowly, I\u2019m going upstairs to rest.\u201dAfter walking a few steps, he stopped and said to Yan Mu who was in a daze: \u201cWhen you left in the afternoon, I was not asleep. Also, your chin is very beautiful.\u201dYan Mu was taken aback for a moment, and then his whole body stiffened up. The tips of his ears were red, thinking that Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t fall asleep in the afternoon, which meant\u2026 he was discovered by the other party when he stole the kiss?By the time he woke up, Lu Chengyu was already upstairs. He raised his ears to hear Lu Chengyu\u2019s footsteps entering the room, and then with a slam, the door was closed, isolating all the noise inside.After flipping through the channels for a while, Yan Mu became more and more restless, and finally turned off the TV and went upstairs. Walking to Lu Chengyu\u2019s room door, he stood outside it for a while. When he was about to go back to his room, Lu Chengyu\u2019s room door opened.\u201cCan you do me a favour and help me wash my hair?\u201d Lu Chengyu stood inside the door with a bright smile on his face. Yan Mu felt that with such a smile, not to mention that Lu Chengyu was just asking him to wash his hair, even if he asked him to charge and fight, he would not hesitate.The water temperature of the shower was just right, and the water flow gently washed Lu Chengyu\u2019s scalp, which was extraordinarily comfortable. Yan Mu\u2019s hands were neither light nor heavy, and he was very careful when washing him. Although the technique was a bit inferior to that of the shampoo boy in the barbershop, the shampoo boy couldn\u2019t compare with this care.After washing his hair, Yan Mu patiently helped Lu Chengyu to dry his hair with a hair dryer. \u201cThe doctor said you have to wait two days to take a bath, so be patient now.\u201dLu Chengyu was not a person who would not care about his physical condition just to take a bath. He watched Yan Mu turn around to help him lay the quilt, and even close the curtains. He couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cBrother Mu, have you thought about it. Did I lie to you?\u201d Did Yan Mu think about it? Maybe it was because of his power and money that he was reluctant to stay with him?\u201cWhat are you lying to me about?\u201d Yan Mu walked over to him and sat down, staring into his eyes, \u201cYou don\u2019t need what I have. What\u2019s more\u2026If you don\u2019t like me, I can use these to keep you. For me, it is also a good thing.\u201d He did not lack money or power, but he lacked the person he likes.Lu Chengyu was stunned for a while, and then smiled after a while: \u201cWhat if I look down on these, and I don\u2019t want to be with you?\u201dYan Mu shook his head: \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201d Maybe, he subconsciously refused to think about this question. If Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t like this\u2026probably he wouldn\u2019t know what to do.His expression was serious, so serious that Lu Chengyu could tell at a glance that he was not lying. Slowly moving his gaze away, Lu Chengyu yawned, \u201cI\u2019m sleepy.\u201dYan Mu hesitated for a moment, and kissed lightly on his forehead: \u201cGood night.\u201d\u201cGood night,\u201d Lu Chengyu watched Yan Mu go out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Somehow, he suddenly remembered the Weibo account he had registered before, and then logged on to the Weibo account in a ghostly manner.His Weibo page was the original page that came with Weibo. Because Cao Jingshen had explained that he helped him personally authenticate, although he only reposted Lu Chengyu\u2019s Weibo, his account was already a certified account with a golden V chapter. What surprised him most was the sudden addition of hundreds of thousands of fans and the comments on Weibo that called him to be with Lu Chengyu.His fingers stayed on the keyboard for a long time. In the end, he still did not post a Weibo. Instead, he took the mouse and clicked on Lu Chengyu\u2019s Weibo account. Then he saw that the latest Weibo was posted by Lu Chengyu this afternoon, and it had a picture of the grass in the garden.More than a year V: \u201cI want to plant flowers recently. Is there anything suitable for planting? (with pictures)\u201dThere were various suggestions in the comment area, but the most suggested was actually chrysanthemum. Yan Mu frowned, and finally forwarded a serious message on Weibo: It is better to plant rose flowers, which bloom in all seasons.Lu Chengyu began to consider what flowers to plant in the garden, indicating that he really wanted to be with him, right? Thinking this way, Yan Mu\u2019s mood suddenly improved by a few percentage points.He didn\u2019t know that soon after he reposted his Weibo, someone posted a screenshot on the forum. The host said that after the Dignified President of Huading opened Weibo, he posted a total of two Weibo, and both of them were forwarded to Lu Chengyu\u2019s Weibo, which shows that the President of Huading had a true love for Lu Chengyu.In the forum, many people had been brainstorming about the love and hatred between Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu. As soon as this post came out, it quickly became lively. Some people even said that this post should be renamed \u201cDominant President Fall in Love with Me\u201d, \u201cWhat can I do to love you, my handsome assistant\u201d or \u201cCold Assistant to the President\u201d, but because these names were too dog-blooded, many people ruthlessly ridiculed and this finally caused a scolding war.After reposting this Weibo, President Yan Mu closed his Weibo account and started to deal with some work matters. In recent days, he had been fully investigating the attack and his free time was used to accompany Lu Chengyu in the hospital, so a lot of work had not been dealt with.After he had processed some urgent documents, it was early in the morning, he closed the computer, got up and went to the bathroom to wash and sleep.In his sleep, Lu Chengyu smiled seductively and charmingly in the mist. When he stepped forward to hug the other person, the other party did not refuse, but hugged him back\u2026Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t know it, but he thought that it was too bad to wake up from such a dream. When Yan Mu woke up in the morning, he changed his pair of underwear with a blank face.In the morning the two had breakfast together, Yan Mu refused to let Lu Chengyu go to work, and also assigned a driver to Lu Chengyu so that he could go out these days.Lu Chengyu looked at the man who looked like a bodyguard, raised his eyebrows and said: \u201cDriver?\u201d This was obviously a sturdy bodyguard in a driver\u2019s coat.Yan Mu said: \u201cJust treat him as a driver.\u201dAt this time, the driver spoke to prove his abilities: \u201cMr. Lu, my driver\u2019s license has not been deducted a point for three consecutive years. Please trust my driving skills.\u201cThen I will trouble you for a while.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled at the driver, \u201cI don\u2019t know what is your surname?\u201d\u201cMy name is He Long, Mr. Lu, you can call me whatever you want,\u201d He Long smiled.Lu Chengyu nodded, and then said again: \u201cDo you know Xiao He who drives Mr. Yan in the company?\u201d Or, Yan Mu prefers to hire a driver with the surname He?\u201cThat\u2019s my brother, He Hu,\u201d He Long smiled embarrassedly. \u201cMy brother said, Mr. Lu, you usually take good care of him. Thank you, you are a good person.\u201d\u201cHaha, you are welcome.\u201d Lu Chengyu, who had picked up a good person card, glanced at He Long\u2019s burly figure. If He Long and the thin Xiao He stood together, few people would believe that they were brothers.Seeing that Lu Chengyu did not refuse him finding him a driver and bodyguard, Yan Mu felt at ease and drove to the company after repeated warnings.Not long after Yan Mu left, Lu Chengyu remembered one thing, that is, the crew of \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d started shooting today. Because the male lead was fixed two days ago, the script went straight to filming.As an investor, Lu Chengyu felt that he should still show his face, so he let He Long drive to the place where the crew was shooting.Because \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d was a small and fresh movie, the opening ceremony was chosen in a beautiful village. When Lu Chengyu arrived, the opening ceremony was over. Zhang Shuo was filming the first scene, and there were a lot of people around. There was some media and some fans of Zhong Zhenghan also present on the scene.As soon as Lu Chengyu appeared, he immediately attracted the attention of the media. Many people even remembered to start interviews with him. Some people asked him whether he came to explore Zhang Shuo\u2019s set or Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s progress, or if he had a role in this movie.He Long had been carefully guarding Lu Chengyu\u2019s injured arm, and he was relieved when he saw that these reporters had surrounded Lu Chengyu, but carefully avoided his wound.\u201cMr. Lu, will you participate in this movie?\u201d\u201cIf there are any passer-by characters in the movie, and if there are not enough people, there may be me,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled at the female reporter who asked the question. \u201cBut the leading role is definitely not me.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThe female reporter was dazzled by Lu Chengyu\u2019s smile, but she was a little disappointed when she heard that Lu Chengyu was not participating in the movie: \u201cIt\u2019s a pity, many audience friends like your performance.\u201d\u201cI thought everyone liked me better.\u201d Lu Chengyu\u2019s smile unchanged, \u201cJust kidding, I am very grateful to everyone for your love. If I have the opportunity in the future and I can try to run around.\u201dThe reporters were amused by Lu Chengyu\u2019s words. At this moment, suddenly a reporter said in a loud voice: \u201cMr. Lu, how did you get the wound on your arm? Some people say that you were at the scene when the attack happened. Is this true?\u201dAs soon as the question came out, the atmosphere suddenly became weird, because many of the entertainment reporters in the room were people who spent a lot of time in the circle. Lu Chengyu\u2019s identity was not simple and they also had this faint guess. So, who would raise the case of an attack without incident. Recently, the capital had been violent because of this incident. An entertainment journalist had nothing to do with it and did not need to pay attention to this. Wasn\u2019t it troublesome for himself?\u201cYou mean this?\u201d Lu Chengyu raised his arm wrapped in gauze, embarrassed, \u201cIs it embarrassing to say that after wrestling with a bowl, I cut my arm?\u201d Lu Chengyu replied.The atmosphere eased in an instant, and a reporter smiled and said, \u201cMr. Lu, you definitely can\u2019t cook.\u201d\u201cFriends from the press, you must edit out this portion and don\u2019t broadcast it.\u201d Lu Chengyu cooperated with a nervous expression on his face, \u201cI heard that now male compatriots who can\u2019t cook will lose fans.\u201dAs soon as the words came out, the reporters suddenly laughed. Then the reporters asked a few more questions, and Lu Chengyu responded very cooperatively. Such that the reporter friends at the scene had a good impression of him.He Long, who was on the side, thought silently, if this is not acting skill, what else can be counted?After Zhong Zhenghan finished filming a scene, he saw that Lu Chengyu was surrounded by a group of reporters, with an atmosphere where everyone was a good friend. He couldn\u2019t help but say to the agent beside him: \u201cSee that person can perform well. He should star as the male lead, those reporters are kinder to him than to me.\u201dWang Song\u2019s eyes beamed, and he looked in the direction of Lu Chengyu with admiration: \u201cWhat a handsome golden leg.\u201dZhong Zhenghan glanced at him disgustingly: \u201cWhat handsome golden leg. If you have the ability, go and hug his leg yourself.\u201dWang Song touched his face, shook his head and sighed: \u201cThe hardware is not enough, so forget it.\u201d If he had a handsome face, he would hug his thigh 800 years ago, and why bother to work hard. He could only be an agent who brought up such an unconscious artist.Zhong Zhenghan: \u201c\u2026\u201dJust when Lu Chengyu finished answering the reporters\u2019 questions and the reporters were about to disperse, the reporter who had raised the attack again said: \u201cMr. Lu said that you were not at the scene of the attack, but why did you appear at the banquet of the Qi family?\u201dThe banquet held by a distinguished family like the Qi family was generally inaccessible to people. For example, reporters like them couldn\u2019t even take two photos at the gate. Lu Chengyu was invited to the banquet?!As soon as this problem came up, the reporters who were planning to leave all stopped.When Zhong Zhenghan next to him heard this question, he frowned. He had been in the entertainment industry for some time, so he didn\u2019t understand the problem of this reporter. However, if Lu Chengyu was involved in the incident, it would not be a good thing. Where did this reporter get the courage?Zhang Shuo and Qu Lingbei found that things were not right, so they stopped filming and hurriedly walked in the direction of Lu Chengyu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This person was wearing a dark coat with a brown waistcoat. Wearing a peaked cap on his head and ordinary black-rimmed glasses on his face, he looked very ordinary. But Lu Chengyu was able to confirm at a glance that the reporter had gone through some disguise and didn\u2019t seem to want to reveal his true appearance.It seemed that someone had prepared in advance and waited for him to arrive. He was probably not sure whether he would come to the press conference, so a disguised reporter was arranged to wait at the scene. No matter whether the person behind this was malicious to him, it was certain that this person knew that he was the investor behind the movie.Seeing that the atmosphere at the scene became weird, Lu Chengyu showed a trace of surprise on his face: \u201cThis reporter friend actually knows that I was at the banquet of the Qi family. I thought no one knew about it.\u201d He scratched his head awkwardly, as if a young man who didn\u2019t know anything about the world quickly explained, \u201cHowever, I really don\u2019t know about other things.\u201d When other reporters saw him in such a state, they were suddenly worried, not to mention the young fellow Lu Chengyu. Those who are involved in entertainment news, dare not report such things casually. Seeing this unfamiliar colleague being aggressive, everyone on the scene gradually realized that someone must have specially arranged for him to block Lu Chengyu.The entertainment reporters were not in a hurry to ask questions. They had long seen that the person next to Lu Chengyu was like a bodyguard. Which ordinary person needed to bring a bodyguard when he went out? After the incident of the Liang family came out, some people in their circle knew that things were not as simple as they were shown to be on the surface. But it was all for their family\u2019s bowl of rice, and they didn\u2019t want to use their lives in exchange of gossip, as they still distinguished the importance between the two.\u201cThis reporter friend probably didn\u2019t know that Xiao Lu was walking with me that night,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan squeezed to Lu Chengyu\u2019s side and said with a smile, \u201cOn the day that the Qi family held the dinner, we two met in the banquet hall. Later, we were able to talk, and we were together when we left.\u201dAlthough Zhong Zhenghan was not a big name, he was considered a popular niche actor in the film and television industry. The entertainment reporters saw that he had a good relationship with Lu Chengyu, and the current shooting made it very lively. The entertainment journalists remember that on the day the Qi family held a banquet, Zhong Zhenghan did post a photo of him and Lu Chengyu on Weibo, which also caused a lot of onlookers to leave a message on the screen. Both of them were young people and popular idols. It was normal to have a lot of fun.Unexpectedly, Zhong Zhenghan would entered into this muddy water. Lu Chengyu raised his eyebrows, smiled at Zhong Zhenghan, turned his head and said to the entertainment journalists: \u201cThank you for your concern for me, but today is \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d conference. If everyone is around me, I\u2019m afraid to go to the brother\u2019s home, sister-in-law would not give me anything to eat.\u201dThe entertainment reporters asked some questions and took some group photos of the two. Then, they followed the crew to collect the red envelopes. Some rich crews would give reporters some red envelopes in order to look good. Although not many, it could be regarded as a kind of show of heart.The reporters felt the goodwill of the crew of \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d, so they mostly took some pictures of the scene and left.As for the reporter who made things difficult for Lu Chengyu before, he had already left secretly, and he obviously knew that this method would not trouble Lu Chengyu. Of course, maybe this person didn\u2019t want to trouble Lu Chengyu on purpose. He just wanted to create doubts about Lu Chengyu on the scene. He didn\u2019t know that Zhong Zhenghan came back to confuse him and broke his plan.\u201cMr. Lu, you are really in a bloody storm right now,\u201d Zhang Shuo said as Lu Chengyu sat down beside him, turned around and shouted at the crew to prepare for the next scene, then turned to talk to Lu Chengyu, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that there would be such a scene. The reporter sneaked in, if I had known I would have kicked him out.\u201d\u201cI will catch the reporter today when I turn on the phone. That would not causing trouble for your crew?\u201d Lu Chengyu took a bottle of water from Qu Lingbei and took a sip from the bottle. \u201cI\u2019ll find someone to check this reporter, so the crew doesn\u2019t need to be affected.\u201dZhang Shuo said nonchalantly: \u201cWe are just filmmakers, how much influence can it have.\u201d He pointed to Zhong Zhenghan who was under the lights, \u201cAlthough the actor you introduced is young, but very dedicated, he was very popular in the first scene just now, which is a good sign.\u201dWhen Lu Chengyu heard this, he turned his head to look at Zhong Zhenghan. Seeing that he was standing silently in the field, he seemed to be brewing emotions, so he nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good if you think he is suitable. I was still worried that it would embarrass you.\u201dZhang Shuo laughed twice, then his face became serious, and turned to the field, made a gesture of preparation for the start. Lu Chengyu knew that Zhang Shuo was very serious when he started shooting, so he stood up quietly and walked aside in order to silently observe Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s shooting.At this moment, a fat man suddenly appeared next to him and smiled so hard to see him, \u201cHello Mr. Lu, this is Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s agent Wang Song, thank you for taking care of our Zhenghan.\u201d\u201cYou are welcome, Zhenghan and I are friends,\u201d Lu Chengyu recognized who this fat man was. After he joined the brokerage company that year, he learned to do things from a senior like Wang Song. Wang Song was mall and cheap, bullying others but fearing hardships, and had a lot of problems. But he was very concerned about Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s affairs. When he was forced by Huang Chuan to have no retreat, Wang Song still dealt with him in the company for a period of time. It\u2019s just that the company couldn\u2019t bear Huang Chuan\u2019s pressure and fired him. Now when he saw Wang Song\u2019s fat face, Lu Chengyu really felt kind towards him.Wang Song smiled and rubbed his hands. Seeing that Lu Chengyu was indeed not making a polite remark, he said: \u201cThe male lead actor who can appear in this movie depends on your recommendation. Otherwise, how can Zhenghan have this opportunity?\u201cI only recommended him to the director because of his good acting skills. If his acting skills are not enough, no matter how good the relationship is, I won\u2019t open this mouth.\u201d Lu Chengyu looked in the direction of Zhong Zhenghan. At this time, Zhong Zhenghan was in pain under the camera. Sitting on the ground, every move was like a character in the play, completely removing his own shadow. When Lu Chengyu saw this, he said with emotion, \u201cNow, he is Chen Qiuhe in the movie. This is Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s acting skills.\u201dWang Song\u2019s pleasing smile on his face gradually became proud, and he only remembered after watching it for a while. he was trying to please Lu Chengyu, but looking back, Lu Chengyu had been called away by the screenwriter of the crew.He squeezed his somewhat fat chin in distress. It was a good thing that Zhenghan had a close relationship with Lu Chengyu, but Zhenghan just went into the muddy water for Mr. Lu just now, which gave him a headache as an agent.\u2026.In the office of the president of Huading International, Yan Mu looked gloomy after reading the newly received e-mail. This time, if the Yao and Li family succeeded, even if the Mu family got revenge, their vitality would be greatly injured. Thinking of his two cousins who cared about him since childhood, he closed the mailbox with a cold face.Cao Jingshen, who was sitting next to him, saw Yan Mu\u2019s face gloomy, and knew that the boss had a good relationship with his two cousins, but as a friend and employee, he had to remind him: \u201cBoss, you are too involved in this matter. I am worried about it. Others might make trouble with you through this matter.\u201dYan Mu calmly said: \u201cJingshen, some things exceed my bottom line, so I can\u2019t just watch from the side.\u201dAfter hearing this, Cao Jingshen was silent for a while and decided not to say anything anymore on the topic: \u201cI heard that Xiao Lu was injured. Is it serious?\u201d He didn\u2019t know if it was his illusion but he found that after he mentioned Lu Chengyu, the boss\u2019s eyes seemed to brighten.\u201cHe still needs to recuperate and cannot come to work for the time being, so I will trouble you during this time.\u201d Yan Mu saw that Cao Jingshen had no objection, but he added, \u201cI will add a red envelope for you this month.\u201d\u201cWhat? I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cao Jingshen\u2019s smile suddenly became a little brighter, \u201cIf you have any work, leave it to me, it\u2019s not a big deal to do a little more every day.\u201dYan Mu had long been accustomed to the speed at which Cao Jingshen changed his face, so it was not surprising to him. When he about to say something, his personal cell phone rang suddenly, and he took it out to see that it was He Long.After answering the call, Yan Mu frowned. How could anyone deliberately find Xiao Lu to make trouble, and who on earth deliberately tried to get Xiao Lu involved in the attack?\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Cao Jingshen saw Yan Mu\u2019s face that had become worried again. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cXiao Lu was troubled by others,\u201d Yan Mu took a deep breath and said in a deep voice. \u201cAnd I found out that Xiao Lu\u2019s parents\u2019 background was a bit wrong.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d Cao Jingshen\u2019s expression changed slightly, and he immediately frowned when he thought of the property Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents left him. Those properties were definitely not something that a company\u2019s general manager and university professor could accumulate. \u201cXiao Lu, does he know?\u201dYan Mu slowly shook his head, \u201cThis is something I did not find out until recently so I could not tell him.\u201dHe thought of the bad Liang family and Lu Chengyu\u2019s indifferent relatives, Cao Jingshen sighed: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like I\u2019m filming a dog blood drama, but I don\u2019t know the ending.\u201dYan Mu was silent, after thinking for a while, stood up and said: \u201cI have to leave beforehand. Please help me deal with the company\u2019s affairs.\u201d Cao Jingshen nodded. After seeing him leave in a hurry, he sighed, resignedly picked up the files on the desk, and went back to his office.Although the old man of the Mu family was nearly eighty years old, he was a very energetic old man. He even insisted on doing Tai Chi several times a day. It was fine for him to plant flowers, play chess, and have a very happy life. After the attack, he had been silent for a long time and started a counterattack, and it made many people remember his iron and blood methods, but no one dared to do anything about this case.When he was watering the flowers, he heard that his grandson was coming, but he was not surprised. Instead, he asked the nanny to bring him into the garden, while he continued to bend over to take care of a pot of orchids.Yan Mu walked into the garden and saw that Mr. Mu was removing insects from flowers, and after a soft call to grandpa, he stood aside and did not speak.\u201cYou kid finally remembered to come back,\u201d Mr. Mu poured some water on the chrysanthemum with a smile, then handed the kettle to Yan Mu, and asked Yan Mu to pour out the water from the kettle to wash his hands. After washing his hands, he shook his hand on the water channel, \u201cI heard about the previous thing. The assistant of your company is very capable. Our Mu family owes him a favour.\u201dYan Mu put the water bottle aside, took out a handkerchief and handed it to Elder Mu: \u201cHe is injured now and is recovering.\u201d\u201cI also heard Qihua mention this. I heard that this young man also made a lot of money by investing in making movies by himself?\u201d Father Mu took Yan Mu to the table under the arbour and sat down, \u201cAlthough it is not a serious industry, but this young man has a good vision.\u201dHe did not argue with his grandfather about the seriousness of the show business. Yan Mu never thought of changing the concept of the older generation. He said calmly: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t me this time, he would also won\u2019t be hurt so badly.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re young and don\u2019t know that the heart is unpredictable,\u201d Mr. Mu had seen many types of people after so many years of ups and downs, and he knows this truth. Someone treated you well, but it might not necessarily be true. Okay, maybe this person had no plans. He saw that his grandson believed in the young man surnamed Lu very much, and sighed, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this young man, and I don\u2019t know what kind of person he is. But our Mu family doesn\u2019t owe favours. When this matter is over, let Qihua thank him. As for whether he is worth the time, you have to rely on your own heart to judge.\u201d The nanny came over and poured water for the two of them. Seeing that the two were talking, she hurriedly walked away again, obviously not wanting to hear one more word.Yan Mu looked at the tea cup from which white smoke was drifting out, and thought for a long time: \u201cGrandpa, I want to ask you one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat is it that is worth your special trip?\u201d Mr. Mu picked up the tea cup and blew on it. The tea stalk floating on the surface of the water moved, then he said in a mild tone, \u201cI rarely see you so embarrassed.\u201d\u201cThis has something to do with the assistant who saved me,\u201d Yan Mu took a sip of the tea, \u201cI have a doubt. His parents had a lot of suspicious things about them before they were alive, so I want Grandpa to check it for me.\u201d\u201cDo you think it is suspicious, or do you want to help Assistant Lu find out the truth?\u201d There was not much emotion in the old man Mu\u2019s tone as usual. He just looked at Yan Mu calmly, \u201cI took this down.\u201dYan Mu heard that his grandfather\u2019s tone was not particularly enthusiastic, knowing that it would be useless to ask for it, so he didn\u2019t insist on it, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s noon, what do you want to eat?\u201d\u201cWhatever,\u201d Mr. Mu was stunned. \u201cThe tofu and duck blood you made last time were good. If you add these two dishes at noon, it would be even better.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good for your body to eat too much duck blood,\u201d Yan Mu said with a stern face, \u201cI\u2019ll make something else for you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a picky eater, you can do whatever you want,\u201d Mr. Mu\u2019s mouth arched downward.Yan Mu: \u201c\u2026\u201d This is really not picky at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although his right hand was inconvenient, he was happily eating with the help of two people around him while using a spoon.Zhong Zhenghan used the public chopsticks to put some fragrant bacon in his bowl, while contemptuously saying: \u201cYou can throw yourself like this into a bowl, you are really good!\u201d His familiar behavior seemed to show them to be good friends. In fact, it was to make the group of people believe the lie that was told before the media. Anyway, he didn\u2019t believe that a fox-like Lu Chengyu would cut himself off for taking a bowl, as it was inconsistent with the IQ of Lu Chengyu\u2019s brain.Wang Song next to him nervously glanced at Zhong Zhenghan. Was it really okay to make fun of Big Golden Leg like this?\u201cWhat\u2019s this, it\u2019s better than someone who can bite his own finger when you gnaw on a cucumber,\u201d Lu Chengyu raised his eyebrows and looked at Zhong Zhenghan, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about stupid with me, I can\u2019t beat you.\u201d\u201cHehe, I see. Your left hand is quite flexible, so you can pick it yourself.\u201d Zhong Zhenghan put the chopsticks on the table and decided not to help Lu Chengyu pick dishes. It was impossible to have a pleasant conversation.Wang Song sighed silently. It turned out that Big Golden Leg had been paying attention to Zhenghan silently, and he even knew the trivial matter of biting his hand. Was this true love in the legend?The table was full watching the male protagonist and the investor happily bickering, the speed of picking up the rice spontaneously slowed down, they were watching others quarrel which looked the most interesting.\u201cTsk tsk,\u201d Lu Chengyu picked up the chopsticks, and flexibly picked up the slippery noodles using the chopsticks into the bowl, \u201cYou don\u2019t please me, be careful, else I will ask the director to reduce your role.\u201dZhong Zhenghan watched Lu Chengyu flexibly use the chopstick with his left hand, he remembered that he was serving him foolishly just now, and suddenly said: \u201cHas anyone ever said that you are shameless?\u201dAfter, Lu Chengyu ate the noodles into his stomach, he said slowly: \u201cNo, but I don\u2019t care about it. \u201cZhong Zhenghan: \u201c\u2026\u201d Ha ha, I really appreciate your magnanimity.Zhang Shuo next to him watched the two arguing. After listening for a long time, he finally said: \u201cMr. Lu, I think there is a role in the movie that suits you.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at Zhang Shuo suspiciously: \u201cNo, not again. Find a suitable role and find me in order to save the pay?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t say that. I would like to invite a heavenly king to play this role with friendship. Unfortunately, this friendship is not in place and others are unwilling to come, so I can only retreat. Secondly, it\u2019s up to you to play this role.\u201d Director Zhang worried that Lu Chengyu would not agree, and said in a hurry. \u201cThere are not many shots of this character, it can be done in a few days.\u201dLu Chengyu pointed to the arm in his hand: \u201cDo you think I can film now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, this character in the play doesn\u2019t have a right arm,\u201d Zhang Shuo didn\u2019t care, \u201cThere are two left-handed close-ups in the play, and you can even save money as a substitute.\u201dLu Chengyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dShould he thank Zhang Shuo for saving him money?In the end, Lu Chengyu agreed to play this role with few shots. It happened that he was free these few days, and Yan Mu was going to work again. It was also very interesting for him to join the crew.Therefore, after eating at noon that day, Zhang Shuo asked the makeup artist to take Lu Chengyu to set makeup. After Lu Chengyu came out wearing an old-style Chinese tunic suit and stepping on leather shoes, Zhang Shuo happily said, \u201cSure enough, it is most suitable for you to play this kind of role, Mr. Lu.\u201dLu Chengyu played a high-achieving and arrogant student in this play. Because of an accident outside, he broke his arm, so he decided to return to a small town in the country to become a teacher. However, he, who considered himself talented, so he despised the vulgar villagers, and after having conflicts with the male protagonist, at the end of the film he was killed in a mudslide in order to save a child.This movie borrowed various characters from remote small towns in the 1930s to describe different human natures, but in general it revealed the hidden good human nature. And the role of Lu Chengyu was one of several supporting roles.There were not many shots of this role, but it was very pleasing, and the main scenes were with the opponent Zhong Zhenghan. After watching it, he became somewhat interested, because Lu Chengyu\u2019s time was limited, he took a shot of Lu Chengyu at the entrance of the village carrying a suitcase that afternoon.There was no one at the entrance of the village where the chastity archway stood. Because it was autumn, there were a lot of dead leaves under the archway. As the footsteps approached, a pair of grey leather shoes appeared in the camera, and a suitcase was put down by his feet. The white gloved hand flicked the dust off the leather shoes.\u201cAfter so many years, this place is still so shabby,\u201d The lens moved to the young man who was taking a shot, only to see the young man wearing elegant glasses, he looked very gentle, but he was full of disdain for this shabby village.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgZhang Shuo looked at Lu Chengyu\u2019s performance from behind the camera, clutching his heart and feeling a little heartache. Why should such a good actor go to be an assistant to a president? It\u2019s a violent thing! A waste of resource!! A sin that cannot be forgiven!!!\u201cThis set of shots has passed,\u201d Zhang Shuo waved his hand, but didn\u2019t think about it, the more you think about it, the more uncomfortable he got.The expression on Lu Chengyu\u2019s face suddenly collapsed as soon as the clapboard was hit. He ran to He Long, unscrewed a bottle of water, tilted his head up and drank it. After eating too much bacon at noon, he felt thirsty no matter how much water he drank.He Long was still caught up in Lu Chengyu\u2019s disdainful expression. Now that Lu Chengyu rushed to him and started drinking, he suddenly couldn\u2019t react. After a while, he said, \u201cSir, Mr. Yan just called and said that he is coming to the crew to pick you up.\u201dLu Chengyu put the empty drink bottle aside and wiped off the water stains on the corners of his mouth: \u201cHow long until he will be here?\u201dHe Long glanced at the time, \u201cHe\u2019s about ten minutes away.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded and turned around to continue shooting. In the next scene, if he didn\u2019t NG several times, he could go home with Yan Mu without waiting long.The following shot showed the character played by Lu Chengyu. After commenting on the village, he found a pile of dead leaves falling. He was full of disgust. He looked up and saw a person sitting on the tree next to him. He did not quarrel with the other person, but coldly spit out one word: \u201cVulgar!\u201dChen Qiuhe naturally sprinkled a handful of leaves on the tree and threw it all over his body. He was so angry that he picked up his suitcase and entered this backward village.After Yan Mu rushed to the crew, he happened to see Lu Chengyu\u2019s expression when he was standing under the tree and talking about vulgarity. The corners of his mouth were slightly bent, and he stood beside Zhang Shuo. It was only after seeing the person who played the opposite role with Lu Chengyu, that his face fell down a little.He Long carefully looked at the boss\u2019s face, and silently moved aside two steps.After taking this set of shots, Lu Chengyu saw that Yan Mu had arrived, so he could not change his clothes and remove his makeup. He took off his non-prescription glasses on the bridge of his nose and walked to Yan Mu. He smiled and said, \u201cBrother Mu, you didn\u2019t go to the company today?\u201d Otherwise, why come here so early?\u201cI went to see Grandpa in the morning, and came out in the afternoon and knew that you were on the set, so I came over.\u201d Yan Mu saw that there were some dead leaves on his hair, stretched out his hand to help him take it off carefully, \u201cGo and change clothes, I\u2019ll wait for you here, we\u2019ll go back together.\u201d\u201cOkay, wait for me for a while, and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Lu Chengyu turned and ran towards the dressing room, unbuttoning the tunic jacket as he ran.He Long hesitated, but still followed Lu Chengyu in the direction of the dressing room.Qu Lingbei next to him looked thoughtfully at Yan Mu. When he saw that the other\u2019s eyes were all falling on Lu Chengyu who was running away, his eyes became more complicated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He turned his head to look and recognized that this person was the screenwriter who worked with Lu Chengyu, so he nodded politely at this person.Qu Lingbei saw that the other party found that he was looking at him, and said: \u201cMr. Yan is here to pick up Mr. Lu?\u201d I don\u2019t know if it was his illusion. He always felt that the atmosphere between Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu was not right, maybe it is. As a screenwriter, he is prone to thinking too much. As a collaborator of Lu Chengyu, Qu Lingbei knew that he should not be nosy. But in his opinion, Lu Chengyu was only six or seven years older than his own child. In today\u2019s society, at the age of twenty-two, many people were still big boys who were not very sensible. Even if Lu Chengyu was sensible, he did not lose to people who had been running outside for many years, but he still had a simpler mind. Business elites like Yan Mu who had seen many things in the world and had tried everything were still different, thus he was worried that Lu Chengyu would suffer.\u201cYeah,\u201d Yan Mu nodded and glanced towards the dressing room. He saw that Lu Chengyu hadn\u2019t come out before concentrating on talking with Qu Lingbei, \u201cHe has a wounded arm, I don\u2019t want him to go home alone.\u201dOn the other side, He Long, who was rushed back by Lu Chengyu to protect Yan Mu, silently shrank to the side when he heard these words. Now in the eyes of President Yan, he was no longer human? Thanks to him being pushed back to be a nameless bodyguard again, he felt like he was hurt a little bit inside.\u201cMr. Lu is young. Mr. Yan is willing to take care of him so much. You\u2019re a good person,\u201d Qu Lingbei said with a smile. \u201cFortunately, you are here. Otherwise, Mr. Lu would be injured at home alone and it is not convenient to do anything.\u201dYan Mu listened. At this point, he looked at the forty-year-old man in front of him for a few more seconds, then slowly nodded his head after a few seconds: \u201cI\u2019m glad to be able to take care of him.\u201dQu Lingbei\u2019s expression changed when he heard Yan Mu\u2019s words. After several changes, he finally nodded and said: \u201cMr. Yan is kind.\u201d As an outsider, he couldn\u2019t speak too much after all, let alone speak too thoroughly, otherwise it would be annoying.Yan Mu had a better impression of Qu Lingbei because of this. After all, the other party was really worried about Lu Chengyu, so he asked so many questions regardless of his identity. If there was no such thought, why should the other party say these things with the possibility of offending him.\u201cBrother Qu, Brother Mu, what are you talking about?\u201d Lu Chengyu ran to the two of them, his cheeks were still blushing abnormally, apparently because he was too anxious when removing makeup, which left traces as if he had injured his skin.\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Qu Lingbei said with a smile, \u201cI originally planned to invite you to my house for a few days, and then go back when the injury is healed. However, I don\u2019t have to worry about you, having Mr. Yan taking care of you.\u201d\u201cBrother Qu don\u2019t think too much,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and walked to Yan Mu and stood beside Yan Mu, \u201cBrother Mu is very careful and will take care of me. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dQu Lingbei smiled and nodded: \u201cYou are taken care off, what else are we worried about? It\u2019s not too early now. Go back and rest early. If you are injured, you can\u2019t be too tired.\u201d\u201cI know Qu Ge and Zhang Dao are good people.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and greeted the studio staff before he joined Yan Mu to leave the set.Qu Lingbei sighed softly as he watched the two leaving. If he hadn\u2019t seen what was going on before, now he could see the look between the two of them. When he was in college, there were two boys in love in school. After being discovered, they were not only expelled from school, but were also looked down upon by the world. Now, that nearly two decades had passed, he hoped these two young people could get together smoothly.\u201cWhat are you sighing about?\u201d Zhang Shuo sighed when he saw his friend, wondering, \u201cCould it be that Mr. Lu made something embarrassing for you?\u201d This shouldn\u2019t be. When did Mr. Lu do such a thing?\u201cNo,\u201d Qu Lingbei shook his head, knowing that his friend was more nervous, so he didn\u2019t plan to let him know about it. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a few more scenes to film? Hurry up, don\u2019t wait for too long. It\u2019s going to be dark.\u201dZhang Shuo suddenly became nervous when he mentioned the filming and turned around again to make others prepare for the next scene.\u2026Zhong Zhenghan, who was sitting next to make-up artist, squinted in the direction Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu were leaving. He was about to frown, but the makeup artist said: \u201cBrother Han, if you move your eyebrows again, you will make your eyebrows crooked.\u201dThe expression on Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s face suddenly disappeared. He didn\u2019t allow any mistakes in his makeup, which was a kind of blasphemy against the character.After he put on his makeup, Wang Song leaned over to him and whispered: \u201cZhenghan, I see that Mr. Lu and Mr. Yan seem to have a very good relationship. When will Mr. Lu help you match up with him? If you can catch up with Mr. Yan, you could walk sideways[1]\u00a0in the circle in the future.\u201d\u201cYou want Lu Chengyu to match me up with Yan Mu?\u201d Zhong Zhenghan looked at Wang Song with a condescending look, \u201cDo you think that people like Yan Mu will take care of me?\u201d\u201cEverything is hard in the beginning,\u201d Wang Song dryly chuckled, \u201cI see that he is not so difficult to get along with, are there any chances to catch him?\u201d\u201cStop dreaming during the day.\u201d Zhong Zhenghan resolutely said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about this in the future. If you find an artist who wants to take the opportunity to get close to Yan Mu, remember to tell me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get to know him. Why don\u2019t you let others get acquainted, what\u2019s wrong! I told you to find ways to be friends with other people. Didn\u2019t I let you follow the unspoken rules? Is it such an issue?\u201d Wang Song said helplessly, \u201cOK, you are the ancestor, just be yourself. What I said just now is nonsense.\u201d He understood Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s temper. Although he was usually arrogant, as long as he decided the matter, even nine cows couldn\u2019t drag him away from it[2]. He also didn\u2019t want to get frozen with Zhong Zhenghan for this kind of thing, after all, it would be good to be able to catch Lu Chengyu. It was true that Yan Mu\u2019s appearance did not seem to be of a person who easily made friends with others.What Zhong Zhenghan thought in his heart was that if his buddy\u2019s man was used by others, it would be too disgusting. And since Yan Mu liked men, of course he must pay attention to distance and measure. No matter whether Lu Chengyu thought too much or not, he couldn\u2019t do things that made the other person become disgusted. It\u2019s not that he was hypocritical, but that he valued Lu Chengyu\u2019s friendship. It was not easy to meet one or two friends who were pleasing to the eye when you are alive. Friendship is a rare species, and not replaceable.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u2026.In the speeding car, Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu were sitting in the back seat of the car. Yan Mu wiped Lu Chengyu\u2019s face with the wet kerchief and said: \u201cWhat were you in a hurry for just now, you didn\u2019t even remove your makeup, and the skin on your face was torn.\u201d\u201cI was worried about you waiting for a long time.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and put his face in front of Yan Mu, allowed him to gently wipe his face, \u201cAnd the makeup remover in the dressing room is very uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cSince you don\u2019t like makeup remover, so don\u2019t promise them to film in future.\u201d Yan Mu changed his handkerchief and continued to wipe his face gently, \u201cYou are an investor, do you still need to listen to them?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not boring, anyway, nothing happened in the past two days.\u201d Lu Chengyu felt a little uncomfortable to stretch his neck like this, so he simply lay on his back on Yan Mu\u2019s knees and let Yan Mu play freely.Yan Mu was slightly stiff at first, but then relaxed his body to make Lu Chengyu lie more comfortably. He held Lu Chengyu\u2019s head with one hand, and continued to wipe his face with the other. \u201cYou like filming?\u201d After he said this, he raised his head to He Long who was driving, \u201cThe speed can be not so fast, try to be a little more stable.\u201dHe Long nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201d He was bleeding in his heart, Mr. Yan, have you seen the contemptuous eyes of the overtaking car owners next to them. A well-known branded car, but even the speed of other people\u2019s Alto can\u2019t compare to them, it is very embarrassing, you know?\u201cIt\u2019s just a little hobby,\u201d Lu Chengyu yawned. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be an authentic entertainer, just like those who love to grow flowers but are not going to be gardeners.\u201dYan Mu cleaned his face with his right hand. After hesitating several times, he finally made a decision to wrap his hand around Lu Chengyu\u2019s waist, \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you like it, I have no other opinion. I heard that somebody is going to make a large-scale patriotic education film, and there will be many stars in it. If you like it, I\u2019ll let the director arrange a role for you.\u201d In Yan Mu\u2019s mind, Lu Chengyu could do anything. It was appropriate for him to star in such a movie that non-big names couldn\u2019t participate in.When Lu Chengyu heard these words, he felt a little bit apprehensive in his heart. The movie Yan Mu mentioned was probably the big production he had imagined. \u201cMu Ge, are you talking about \u201cThe Universe\u201d?\u201d This was indeed a big production, and the background of this movie was the country. The agency that he worked in back then took a lot of effort to get one or two places for their artists to participate in the movie, begging everybody from their grandpa to their grandma, and in the end only got two roles that showed only their faces for a few minutes.\u201cIt seems to be called this name.\u201d Yan Mu frowned and said indifferently, \u201cAs long as you are interested, I will let the crew arrange a good role for you tomorrow. If you are not tempted, then let it be.\u201d Lu Chengyu admitted that he was a layman. Of course, he was full of longing for such a big movie. Who would not think that he had achieved too much?\u201cBrother Mu, if I go to participate, do you count as a related party?\u201d Lu Chengyu rubbed his head on Yan Mu\u2019s abdomen, and found that the belt buckle was a little bit awkward, so he stopped this action and changed to a more serious adjustment in order to lie comfortably, \u201cThis kind of feeling like someone is above me is really different.\u201dLu Chengyu wouldn\u2019t find it embarrassing to think that Yan Mu had helped him to enter the crew. He didn\u2019t have the inexplicable attitude of nobility. Anyway, there was nothing wrong going on inside, he would feel sure that it was a very straightforward thing, \u201cThat, should we try it tomorrow?\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Yan Mu\u2019s mouth hooked up, and he looked at Lu Chengyu very calmly and said, \u201cThe average person can\u2019t get into the crew, but the relationship is normal, don\u2019t think too much. If someone troubles you, you come back and tell me, I will let the director take care of it.\u201d Anyway, he thought that his own Xiao Yu was no worse than anyone else, Xiao Yu being interested in shooting a character is more important than anything else.\u201cThere aren\u2019t so many people in this circle who don\u2019t have long eyes[3].\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, \u201cHey, but being a good youth, how could I do something like bullying people.\u201d However, if someone bullied him, he would close the door and let the situation be strict. Thinking about it, it really felt good.He Long, who accidentally heard the conversation between the two in front of him, said: \u201c\u2026\u201d Mr. Yan\u2019s Three Views seemed to be crooked. In addition, he almost didn\u2019t recognize the words Good Youth coming out of Mr. Lu\u2019s mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the end, Yan Mu finally won a little welfare for himself, that is, to help Lu Chengyu wipe his body, because Lu Chengyu couldn\u2019t take a bath, the only thing he could do was wipe his body. It was more hygienic.Lu Chengyu was lying on the bed, feeling the trembling hands through the towel on his back. He suspected that if he shook like this, Yan Mu might not be able to help but pounce on him. However, when Yan Mu finished rubbing his entire back and he turned over so Yan Mu could start rubbing his chest, Yan Mu didn\u2019t even have a hair out of place, which gave Lu Chengyu a new level of understanding of Yan Mu.After wiping Lu Chengyu\u2019s body again, Yan Mu went to change the basin of water. After wiping Lu Chengyu again carefully, he hurried out of Lu Chengyu\u2019s room with sweat on his forehead.Lu Chengyu watched Yan Mu rushing out the door with his waist bowed and couldn\u2019t help laughing while lying on the bed. After laughing, he was a little moved. Because the other party knew that he hadn\u2019t fully accepted the relationship in his heart, he suppressed himself.He was a man himself, and naturally knew what kind of creature a man is, so Yan Mu being willing to bear this for him, showed that in Yan Mu\u2019s heart, his weight had surpassed that of his own desires and hopes.Slowly standing up from the bed, he walked to the window, looked at the night outside, and smiled slowly. Maybe he really found a feeling worth cherishing with all his heart.In the next room, Yan Mu solved his physical problems in embarrassment. Thinking of Lu Chengyu\u2019s beautiful waistline and the mermaid line on his abdomen, he suddenly felt that the fire in his lower abdomen could not be extinguished. After tossing for a long time, he looked at his right hand and sighed slowly.\u2026..After breakfast the next morning, Yan Mu took Lu Chengyu to see the director of the crew of \u201cThe Universe\u201d. Because \u201cThe Universe\u201d was a very important movie, it had assembled a very prestigious team. Even the lighting artist, makeup artist and prop director had been strictly selected. If an average person entered into the crew, even if he was a cleaner, his background would be checked extensively.For the director, the box office of this movie was not the focus. The focus was to shoot well and produce quality. What they wanted was a good reputation. For other things, it was not that important.Director Qin was the director of the movie, so when he came to know that Mu\u2019s grandson was going to bring an actor to audition, he decided to meet him personally. After all, in the capital, who didn\u2019t know that Mu\u2019s grandson Yan Mu was the number one person, and whoever dared to offend him, wasn\u2019t that simply hanging himself?The audition for the film crew of \u201cThe Universe\u201d was in a courtyard with three entrances in the suburbs of Beijing. When Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu rushed to the audition site, Lu Chengyu saw Director Qin, whom he had looked up to in his previous life, waiting for them in the conference room with a smile on his face. He knew in his heart that the other party was giving Yan Mu face, so he did not rashly speak. When the two parties greeted each other, he respectfully called the other party \u201cDirector Qin.\u201dDirector Qin was able to eat well in the circle, one was because he was talented, and secondly, because he was an intelligent man. Therefore, after Lu Chengyu greeted him, he smiled and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you contribute significantly in \u201cFlying Birds\u201d? Those shots in the movie were performed well.\u201dLu Chengyu was humble when speaking. After a few sentences, he showed the politeness of a newcomer and younger generation, and did not forget the social etiquette because of Yan Mu\u2019s presence. The so-called being a man shouldn\u2019t be too rampant, and those who are too rampant generally didn\u2019t end well.Director Qin was accustomed to seeing the various unspoken rules and relationships in the circle, so when Yan Mu brought Lu Chengyu, he did not have any disgusting thoughts about Lu Chengyu. Now, he saw that Lu Chengyu was very polite, and not acting haughty because he was with the mighty Yan Mu, but he also looked at him respectfully. It was indeed very rare to be able to maintain such a normal heart in this circle at a young age. No wonder people like Yan Mu were willing to take this trip for him.\u201cNow when the crew is in short supply of actors, I am very grateful to Mr. Yan for recommending good actors for us.\u201d Director Qin was a socially conscious person, knowing that he was not the most talented one in the entire director team, but in the end, it happened that he became the chief director. This was his personal charisma. Therefore, at this time, he naturally couldn\u2019t wait for Yan Mu to speak before he could act. He was too sensible. \u201cI have seen Mr. Lu\u2019s performance. It is very good. I personally like it very much. The role of a major in our crew is very important. but we have not found the right actor. I see Mr. Lu, and I think you are perfect for this role. Mr. Lu could you do this for me, and show your face in the movie?\u201dLook at this scene, it was beautiful, Lu Chengyu sighed. No wonder, that he will become a national director in a few years. Even the opening ceremony of the global sports meet will be directed by him. Only those who could flex and bend could move well in political and entertainment circles. He immediately smiled and said: \u201cI dare not say that I\u2019m helping. It is my honour to show my face in Director Qin\u2019s movie. Let me be a passer-by, let alone a major. It is also a matter of a face to speak out.\u201d He was willing to participate in the performance of this movie, one was because of the extraordinary status of this movie, and the other was because there was something that he had puzzled over for a long time, and he needed to find a chance to solve it.\u201cMr. Lu is polite, how can a talent like you play a passer-by? Isn\u2019t that a violent thing? You are willing, but I can\u2019t bear such a good talent to waste.\u201d Director Qin laughed, \u201cSince Mr. Lu is willing to help, so let\u2019s agree to it?\u201dLu Chengyu said with a shy face: \u201cThank you director, for giving me this opportunity. Thank you so much.\u201dThe assistant director next to them looked at the two smiling and flattering each other. He silently wiped his face, and thought that as expected, in this circle, only thick-skinned people could get mixed up. He turned his head and saw that Yan Mu had been silent beside him. He couldn\u2019t help thinking that this President Yan was really good to his assistant, and he was willing to arrange even this kind of opportunity. It took a lot of affection for him to be willing to do such a thing.Thinking of this, he turned his head to look at Director Qin, who was still flattering Lu Chengyu. They were all doing assistant jobs, then how could there be such a big difference in treatment?After the two were finished extolling each other\u2019s virtues, Director Qin said to the long-silent Yan Mu: \u201cMr. Yan, the film will officially start shooting next Monday. Most of the shots are in the capital and several nearby cities, so the shooting environment is not very difficult. But because of this, the quality of the movie is very strict. So, Mr. Lu may need to be prepared to endure hardships before filming.\u201dYan Mu frowned and looked at the injury on Lu Chengyu\u2019s arm.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about this. The first shot of the major played by Mr. Lu was him being injured, so there won\u2019t be any problems in appearance.\u201d Director Qin said with a smile, \u201cI also arranged the role according to Mr. Lu\u2019s personal conditions.\u201d With Yan Mu\u2019s attitude, he was afraid that his relationship with Assistant Lu was unusual.He just said that there was no suitable actor for this role in the play, and now it had become a role specially selected for Mr. Lu. Director, was it really okay for you to score like this? The director\u2019s assistant glanced at Director Qin, but in his heart he admired Director Qin\u2019s patience and thick skin. There were still many things he needed to learn.\u201cThank you,\u201d Yan Mu nodded slightly.\u201cHaha, no need,\u201d Director Qin immediately smiled happily, thinking it was not easy to get this stern thank you.Immediately, Director Qin asked his assistant to take Lu Chengyu to the dressing room to try on makeup. Then, in the next two days, he would improve the size of the costume according to his figure and make reasonable makeup changes according to his appearance conditions.The role of Lu Chengyu was an army major. The major\u2019s character in the play was rigorous, handsome, and elegant, but in the end, he died tragically in a fierce war. During the war, he abandoned his usual elegance, but he was willing. The courageous spirit of dying for the country was more impressive than appearance and elegance.When Lu Chengyu was trying makeup, Yan Mu was outside watching the introduction of the major character in the play. He had to say that Director Qin did arrange a very pleasing role for Lu Chengyu. Even if he didn\u2019t pay attention to the movie, he knew how eye-catching this role would be in the movie and how pleasing it was to the audience, so he was very satisfied with Director Qin\u2019s arrangement.Some people said that men in uniforms are the most handsome and charming. So, when Lu Chengyu came out wearing his costume, Yan Mu was stunned after only one glance. If Lu Chengyu was usually gentle, then he was now rigorous and arrogant, and his upright military uniform showed the spiritual side of his whole person. This kind of strong visual contrast almost made Yan Mu forget that there were many people around him watching. After a while, he returned to his senses: \u201cThis suit\u2026not bad.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and raised his eyebrows while looking at Yan Mu. Just the clothes were good?This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgGod said, that if there was a dishonest man, there would be no meat to eat[1].Director Qin and the others in the director team were also very satisfied with Lu Chengyu\u2019s appearance and took Lu Chengyu outside in the courtyard to take a few makeup photos. When they came back, the two parties signed the contract.After signing the contract, both parties agreed on the start-up time, and nothing else was needed. So, Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu left the inner courtyard where they were in charge of the interview. As they walked, they talked about what to eat for lunch, and followed the assistant director who sent them out.Before they left the second door, they saw several assistants walking in with a female artist. This posture made Lu Chengyu feel that she was a little familiar.After the person approached, Lu Chengyu recognized who the person was at a glance. He couldn\u2019t help but glance at Yan Mu. This Liu Qiyan was the only one who had had a scandal with Yan Mu.At this time, Liu Qiyan also saw Lu Chengyu. She stepped into the second door and walked to Lu Chengyu with a concern on her face: \u201cMr. Lu doesn\u2019t seem to look very good today. The last time we met on the TV station, you looked much better than now. Don\u2019t neglect your body for work.\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern.\u201d Lu Chengyu did not expect that the other party remembered him just from the side of the road when they met at the TV station last time. But no matter how unexpected it was, the gentle smile on his face had not changed, \u201cI will definitely pay attention.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so formal, I\u2019m a few years older than you, just call me sister Liu,\u201d Liu Qiyan took off the brown sunglasses on her face, \u201cI heard that you were injured recently. Remember to drink more blood-tonifying soup.\u201dLu Chengyu hurriedly smiled and nodded. Seeing Yan Mu standing aside with a calm face, he immediately said: \u201cSister Liu is going to audition, the chief director is in, and it\u2019s just right for you to go now.\u201dLiu Qiyan seemed to remember that something was going on. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t tell me, I would have forgotten. I have already set the time with the director team before. Then, I will go ahead and we\u2019ll talk next time.\u201d\u201cGoodbye.\u201d Lu Chengyu watched Liu Qiyan walking on her ten-centimetre-high heel. The slender figure swaying on the stone road could not help but raise a heartfelt respect within him.Yan Mu looked critically at Liu Qiyan\u2019s back. How did Xiao Yu meet this kind of woman who didn\u2019t look peaceful? The woman looked into Xiao Yu\u2019s eyes just now, and it seemed a little strange.As if guessing his thoughts, Lu Chengyu\u2019s voice sounded next to him: \u201cThe last time I participated in \u201cA Book of Life\u201d, I met her once below the TV station. I didn\u2019t expect that she would still remember me. It was really surprising. \u201cYan Mu frowned when he heard the words and said: \u201cPeople in the entertainment industry are not simple, you have to be prepared.\u201d Especially women, no, men are the same.Lu Chengyu smiled and nodded: \u201cWell, I will take care.\u201d No matter whether the other party was jealous or not, how can he as a partner make the other party unhappy because of such a small matter?In the distance, Liu Qiyan, who had already gone far, turned her head and glanced at the direction where the two had left.Her assistant asked inexplicably, \u201cSister Liu, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Liu Qiyan put the sunglasses back on her face again, \u201cLet\u2019s go, don\u2019t let the director wait for a long time.\u201dThe assistants behind her stared at each other, who didn\u2019t dare to ask more, and followed her in a hurry, lest she get angry, after all, Sister Liu\u2019s temper was not good.However, Sister Liu was very kind to Lu Chengyu, and her gentle appearance was completely different from usual, which was really strange.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although it was not easy to operate with one hand, he was also very flexible because of his uninjured left hand. It was not particularly embarrassing to givet up.In the company\u2019s public mailbox, there were some emails from colleagues who cared about his body. He sent them a reply one by one. After finishing these, it was already more than ten o\u2019clock in the evening. He stretched out on the sofa, turned his head to see Yan Mu still looking at the files in the computer seriously. After thinking for a while, he poured two cups of milk and put one in Yan Mu\u2019s hand, \u201cIt\u2019s so late, it\u2019s time to go to bed.\u201dYan Mu took a sip of the milk and moved his attention from the computer screen to Lu Chengyu. \u201cOkay, wait for me to wipe your body.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will go to the \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d crew to take some shots tomorrow. I don\u2019t need to go so early in the morning.\u201d He finished drinking the milk in the glass and put the empty glass on the side, he stretched out his hand and patted Yan Mu on the shoulder, \u201cYou have been with me today, are there a lot of things happening in the company?\u201dHuading had a large number of industries. Although the managers of each branch were capable, many decisions still needed to be made by Yan Mu, the biggest boss. In addition, his assistant had recently been unable to go to work because of his injured arm, which had caused Yan Mu\u2019s workload to be increased ten folds.It stood to reason that Yan Mu should appoint a temporary assistant to help him deal with the urgent matters. Unfortunately, judging from Yan Mu\u2019s appearance, he was obviously unwilling to use others, so Lu Chengyu could only do his best to help him with some documents at home.\u201cThere are not many things. If I have to decide on everything, what would those managers do?\u201d Probably because the palm on his back was too hot, Yan Mu closed the laptop, drank the milk in one breath, and washed the two cups. After the cups came out, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs to wash.\u201dLu Chengyu blinked. After the two went upstairs, Lu Chengyu took off his shirt and pants, leaving only a pair of shorts and laid on the bed, Yan Mu scrubbed his back, although he was not tired, but he was already sweating profusely. The towel gradually went down where the dark underwear wrapped around his beautiful buttocks. His movements became stiff, and he touched Lu Chengyu\u2019s buttocks awkwardly.Just when Lu Chengyu turned his head, Yan Mu was rubbing the towel in the basin, the expression on his face was so serious that Lu Chengyu thought that his touch just now was an illusion. Thinking of this, he simply turned over and lay on the bed, leaning on the bed with one hand, watching Yan Mu rubbing his veil with one hand and turning to face him.\u201cStretch out your hand,\u201d Yan Mu gently wiped Lu Chengyu\u2019s injured arm. Although he looked upright, his eyes did not stare into Lu Chengyu\u2019s eyes from beginning to end.He was lying flat while handing the other uninjured arm to Yan Mu. Lu Chengyu watched him carefully wipe every place, not even missing the fingers, and couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cBrother Mu, have you taken care of others before? \u201cYan Mu looked up to see him looking at him with a faint smile, then he said, \u201cI have been living alone for so many years, except for myself, I have not taken care of others.\u201d He wiped Lu Chengyu\u2019s chest again. However, he didn\u2019t know if it was Lu Chengyu\u2019s illusion but he felt that Yan Mu\u2019s movements were obviously slower, and he was very suspicious.After Yan Mu wiped Lu Chengyu\u2019s whole body clean, half an hour passed. Lu Chengyu sat cross-legged on the bed in his pajamas, watching Yan Mu help him clean up the house, and said with a smile, \u201cBrother Mu, you are simply a good man.\u201d\u201cDo you think you got a good deal?\u201d Yan Mu asked with a relaxed expression, sitting beside Lu Chengyu.This was unscientific, how did Mu Ge learn to joke? ! Lu Chengyu widened his eyes and looked at Yan Mu, and then nodded for a few seconds: \u201cYes, I picked up a huge bargain.\u201dYan Mu looked at him, his eyes sinking slightly, and suddenly he took his shoulders and kissed his lips hard.With soft lips and warm tongue, the breath of each other lingered on the tip of his tongue, Lu Chengyu blinked, and when Yan Mu released him, he still didn\u2019t react.\u201cGood night,\u201d Yan Mu straightened his back and strode out of Lu Chengyu\u2019s room, not forgetting to help Lu Chengyu close the door.\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Lu Chengyu touched his face, feeling that the temperature of his cheeks seemed a little abnormal, he chucked his thoughts and wrapped himself in the quilt, curled into the bed, leaving only half of the black top of his head exposed outside.Yan Mu in the next room searched out a hidden folder from the computer with his fingers trembling slightly, and saw the third article on it: How to kiss as naturally as possible.Yan Mu frowned, feeling that what he did tonight was not natural enough, but thinking of Lu Chengyu\u2019s expression at the time, the corners of his mouth raised slightly, and then he made a tick behind this one.After closing the hidden folder, he continued to bring up the work that had not been completed before. Tomorrow afternoon he needed to get off work early to take Lu Chengyu home from the crew, so the work should be done in as little time as possible.The next morning, after Lu Chengyu went downstairs, he saw breakfast on the table and Yan Mu was sitting at the dining table waiting for him. He smiled: \u201cMorning.\u201d\u201cMorning.\u201d Yan Mu raised his head slightly, \u201cCome over for breakfast. \u201cLu Chengyu remembered the kiss last night, coughed dryly, and sat down opposite Yan Mu to eat breakfast silently. When the two of them said goodbye at the door after breakfast, Lu Chengyu hooked his fingers towards Yan Mu. When Yan Mu stretched his head over, he kissed Yan Mu\u2019s mouth and waved his hand freely, \u201cI\u2019m going to the crew, remember not to look around at the handsome beautiful guys on the road.\u201dYan Mu was startled slightly, and then nodded: \u201cDon\u2019t look around.\u201d Was there anyone on the road who looked better than Xiao Yu?He Long, who was waiting for Lu Chengyu to get in the car, saw this scene and silently blindfolded his eyes. After he saw through his fingers that Lu Chengyu was about to get in the car, he jumped out of the car and opened the door for Lu Chengyu. .After both of them got in the car, He Long finally couldn\u2019t help but said: \u201cMr. Lu, your relationship with Mr. Yan is really good.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, \u201cProbably because we are of the same gender?\u201d It was better to understand what men want, just as women always knew women best.He Long heard that Lu Chengyu was joking, and started the car and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s the look in your eyes, I can\u2019t tell the feeling, but it\u2019s very soft.\u201dWhen Lu Chengyu turned his head and looked towards the doorway, he saw Yan Mu still standing at the door, staring at the car he was sitting in. He didn\u2019t see Yan Mu walking towards the garage until after the car drove out of the yard.Looking back slowly, Lu Chengyu felt that he was in a better mood than before, so he took out his phone and posted a Weibo.More than every year: The scenery behind us is often exceptionally beautiful.Although it was still morning, many fans left messages for him after this Weibo was posted. Some people asked him if he was missing the bed at home. Some people asked him if there was a big beauty behind him, and some fans admired him saying that that their male god was so diligent and went out to work so early.After reading some messages, Lu Chengyu smiled helplessly. Although the fans\u2019 comments were all funny, for him, these people accompanied him to spend many days and nights living alone. He remembered that because he was busy with life in his previous life, he gradually stopped using Weibo. He didn\u2019t know how much he missed out on this kind of fun.\u201cMr. Lu, do we need to go home for lunch at noon?\u201d He Long, as a bodyguard and driver, had a generous salary, so he was also very dedicated at work.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be back,\u201d Lu Chengyu frowned. \u201cI have signed a contract with the crew of \u201cThe Universe\u201d, so I will finish the shots of \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d in these two days and report to \u201cThe Universe\u201d on Monday.\u201dHe Long nodded, indicating that he understood, thinking that Lu Chengyu was also involved in the production of \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d, but he didn\u2019t usually put up airs. He felt a little emotional. If the relationship between Mr. Yan and Mr. Lu was made public, perhaps in the eyes of some people, Mr. Lu would be said to be relying on Mr. Yan\u2019s riches. But in his opinion, Mr. Lu was a very good person, serious, patient, hard-working, and educated. He who had no wealthy background, could achieve such achievements. It was not even comparable to many young masters with good backgrounds.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLu Chengyu didn\u2019t know that He Long had such a high evaluation of him. After he rushed to the crew, while putting on makeup, he told Director Zhang about his going to the filming crew of \u201cThe Universe\u201d: \u201cSo I plan to make up the scenes as soon as possible in the next few days. Will it be troublesome?\u201d\u201cThe crew of \u201cThe Universe\u201d?!\u201d Zhang Shuo said with emotion, \u201cThis is a great opportunity, don\u2019t miss it. We are shooting here in these few places. There is no problem in focusing on your shots these days.\u201d Although it was possible that it would increase some expenses, but since Mr. Lu, as the investor, had planned this way, he, as a director, did not need to consider this aspect.\u201cThen I will trouble you,\u201d Lu Chengyu apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disrupt the plan of the crew. I will apologize to the crew later.\u201dZhang Shuo knew Lu Chengyu\u2019s habits and didn\u2019t insist on saying anything. When everyone gathered for dinner at noon, he saw Lu Chengyu apologize to everyone. The staff at the scene repeatedly said that it was okay. There were many investors in this circle who messed around during shooting. Lu Chengyu was nothing like this. What\u2019s more important is, that it was \u201cThe Universe\u201d that people wanted to participate in. Wasn\u2019t it normal that he didn\u2019t want to miss such a huge opportunity?But everyone also understood one thing in their hearts. Lu Chengyu, a man who had only acted in a few shots, could star in \u201cThe Universe\u201d. They didn\u2019t know how deep his background was! No matter how, but they didn\u2019t dare to offend such a person, it was too late to busy themselves pleasing him.Because he was going to film the scene of saving a child in a mudslide in the afternoon, Lu Chengyu wrapped his injured arm with plastic wrap to prevent sewage from entering the wound. When everything was ready, he looked at the dirty and smelly sewage ditch, gritted his teeth and jumped down.In order to show the impact of the mudslide, the staff used dirty water to splash Lu Chengyu\u2019s side. Originally, Lu Chengyu\u2019s performance was very good. Unfortunately, because the little actor laughed at the scene, the whole shot needed to be retaken.He Long stood watching Lu Chengyu rolling around in the muddy water. As for the footage of the entire mudslide, post-production needed to be completed, so now this scene did look a little funny.When the entire shot was finished, a bunch of staff members were busy helping Lu Chengyu out of the sewage, fetching water, taking towels and clothes, and surrounding him.When Lu Chengyu entered the room, he used one hand to wash his head and face and wipe the sewage. Almost an hour passed before he put on a clean costume and prepared to shoot the bickering shots with Zhong Zhenghan.At this time, the director was taking a shot of Zhong Zhenghan. He sat on the side and let the makeup artist work on his face. When Zhong Zhenghan finished taking the set of shots, his makeup was done.\u201cI say you shoot very well,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan later sat down at his side and said, \u201cYou said you\u2019re an economics major, you previously haven\u2019t shot movies as well, how do you act so well?\u201d\u201cThis, it\u2019s a human talent, which ordinary people can\u2019t learn.\u201d Lu Chengyu raised his eyebrows proudly at him, \u201cFor example, people like you.\u201d\u201cBah,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan rolled his eyes at him, \u201cSeriously, you\u2019ve never been in touch with anything in this area before?\u201d\u201cWhere did I get in touch with these?\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, \u201cProbably I learned the skills in my previous life.\u201d In his previous life, he often helped Zhong Zhenghan find a sense of drama. He played against Zhong Zhenghan, and sometimes ran a few extra roles in the crew. The so-called had never eaten pork, but have seen pigs run, that\u2019s what it was.\u201cIt\u2019s strange but I believe you,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan took a sip of the water handed to him by the assistant, and hesitated, \u201cAre you really going to \u201cThe Universe\u201d crew?\u201dLu Chengyu nodded, \u201cSuch a good opportunity. If I let it go, it would be too stupid.\u201dZhong Zhenghan sighed and said in a low voice: \u201cI think I also treat you like a brother. Are you and Yan Mu the same?\u201dLu Chengyu glanced at him, smiled and asked: \u201cWhat, discriminating?\u201d\u201cI discriminate against you.\u201d Zhong Zhenghan said with a rough voice, \u201cDo you think I look like that kind of person? I\u2019m worried that others will gossip about you behind your back.\u201dAnyone with a bit of knowledge knew what status Yan Mu had in the capital. If Lu Chengyu relied on that relationship to enter \u201cThe Universe\u201d crew, he was worried that after the relationship between the two broke out, someone would say that Lu Chengyu relied on the unspoken rules, or that Lu Chengyu had a sugar daddy. After spending some time in this circle, he knew what people say, and he knew more about how rumors were like running water which could harm even the most popular artist.\u201cI originally entered the crew based on unspoken rules. There is nothing wrong with it.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled. He knew that Zhong Zhenghan was worried about him, so he said, \u201cThe so-called life is alive, it\u2019s not good enough. I chose to talk to Yan Mu. When we were getting together, we considered various consequences. I was upright with him and did not harm anyone\u2019s interests. We were both single before we got together, and we have not deceived anyone\u2019s feelings. What\u2019s wrong? Yan Mu is willing to do a lot of things for me. That is also Yan Mu and me. What is their business? No matter how much they scold, they can\u2019t do anything to me. Who knows how many of those scolding people are envious and jealous?\u201dZhong Zhenghan was surprised for a while, and after a while, he said emotionally, \u201cYou are really open-minded.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m open-minded, but I can see what is more important.\u201d Anyway, for Lu Chengyu, he just didn\u2019t like certain hypocritical behaviours. For example, because the other party\u2019s status was noble, he is reluctant to let others know the relationship between the two, which also emphasizes that the two are unequal, not spending the other\u2019s money. Disdain for the other party to use his power to help himself. For Lu Chengyu, this kind of behaviour was simply another kind of inequality, and it was also unfair to the other half, \u201cHe is happy about this, I am happy, what\u2019s wrong. Besides, I am not with him for the thigh, Yan Mu knows. I don\u2019t do it for his money. In the eyes of others, no matter what I do, I\u2019m just hugging his thighs, and I\u2019m too lazy to care about it.\u201dIn his view, feelings should come naturally, and one party doesn\u2019t deliberately express his own dignity, while the other party does not have to deliberately use money to show their abilities. Get along as you should. Thinking too much affects your relationship and hurts your body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As far as his personality was concerned, he also appreciated Lu Chengyu\u2019s kind of thoughts: \u201cWhat you said is very reasonable. People must first live for themselves. Have fun.\u201d\u201cYou two are preparing for the next scene,\u201d Zhang Shuo saw the two of them chatting happily. He almost treated the set as a teahouse, knowing that he walked to the two of them and said, \u201cYou two, there are still a few more shots this afternoon. Let\u2019s hurry up, otherwise the crew will have to stay up late tonight.\u201dWhen Lu Chengyu heard this, he pulled up Zhong Zhenghan, \u201cDirector Zhong, let\u2019s start now.\u201dZhong Zhenghan watched as he was easily picked up by Lu Chengyu\u2019s left hand, and now he wondered whether he succeeded in losing weight or because Lu Chengyu\u2019s hands were too strong.\u201cLook at your delicate skin and tender flesh. You have to wipe it three or four times when you sit on a stool. What, if you go out, you will forget your ancestors and dislike our Chen Jiazhen for being poor?\u201d He said at the table, \u201cDon\u2019t look at my little master, I don\u2019t know how to read your behaviour, even if it is full of books, that\u2019s the same?\u201d He stretched out his thumb to the opposite person, then flipped his hand and pointed his thumb to the ground.The white knuckles of the young man wearing the glasses gently pushed down his glasses, and his eyes were full of disdain: \u201cIt\u2019s not full of books, but full of economy.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about books or economy.\u201d The young man gave an awkward cough before saying, \u201cAnyway, no matter what you say, you can\u2019t stop letting your family come to the school just because the child made a little mistake. If you don\u2019t correct your fault, be careful or I will beat you.\u201d The young man glanced at him, then bowed his head. Looking at the book in hand, he almost regarded the people around him as non-existent.\u201cHey!\u201d Seeing that the other party ignored him, the young man rushed forward and was about to punch someone. As a result, he raised his fist for a long time and didn\u2019t do anything. In the end, he just slammed the door angrily.\u201cVery good!\u201d Zhang Shuo motioned to pass this set of shots, then turned his head and said to Yan Mu who had just rushed to the crew, \u201cMr. Yan, Mr. Lu\u2019s shots are finished today.\u201dYan Mu turned and looked at the previous section of Lu Chengyu in the sewage. The rolling shot made him frown a bit tightly, and he was a bit fussy, \u201cThis water is so dirty, what should I do, if Xiao Yu\u2019s wound is infected?\u201d\u201cMr. Yan, don\u2019t worry, our crew has taken protective measures to prevent such accidents.\u201d Although Zhang Shuo had a rough demeanour, but he still felt pressure from the stern look in Yan Mu\u2019s eyes.Just then, Lu Chengyu came over, \u201cBrother Mu is here, so early today?\u201dYan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu. Because of the plot needs, Lu Chengyu\u2019s entire left arm was hidden in his coat, and he was dressed in this outfit which carried the taste of a scholar teaching in high school, \u201cThe company does not have too many things, I will take you to the hospital to change the medicine.\u201dWhen was Huading not busy? Lu Chengyu knew that Yan Mu lied to him, but did not reveal it, just turned around and went to the dressing room.Not far away, Zhong Zhenghan saw this scene, walked to a place two steps away from Yan Mu, stood still, and said with a smile: \u201cMr. Yan is very concerned about Xiao Yu.\u201d\u201cHello,\u201d Yan Mu was reserved with Zhong Zhenghan. He nodded and said, \u201cXiao Yu mentioned you to me in the past few days, and he said that you are his new friend. Since, you are Xiao Yu\u2019s friend, you are my friend. When you have time, visit our house.\u201dObviously the other party was very polite in every sentence, but why did he hear something wrong after the combination?\u201cThank you for the invitation, Mr. Yan. I will definitely come if I have the opportunity,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan said with a smile. \u201cAlthough Xiao Yu is young, many people can\u2019t compare with him. So, you have to treat him better than others. \u201c\u201cOf course,\u201d Yan Mu said very seriously, \u201cIn my eyes, he is better than anyone.\u201d In just a few words, he determined that Zhong Zhenghan had no other thoughts on Xiao Yu, and even more, took him as a good friend, otherwise he won\u2019t warn him vaguely.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cAnyone?\u201d Zhong Zheng said with a smile, \u201cExcuse me, can I ask you a question?\u201dYan Mu nodded silently.\u201cIf he and your family fall into the river, who will you save first?\u201d There was a moment of silence.\u201cMaybe my family will be saved by Xiao Yu before they fall.\u201d Yan Mu said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to swim. In order to avoid this situation in the future, I will try to take two bodyguards out of the house as much as possible.\u201dZhong Zhenghan : \u201c\u2026\u201d This scenario seemed to be wrong.At this time, Wang Song on one side rushed out and said, \u201cMr. Lu can swim, so amazing.\u201d\u201cSwimming is amazing?\u201d Zhang Shuo, who only heard this sentence, interrupted, \u201cI can also swim. When we will all be together again, let\u2019s all go to the swimming pool!\u201dWang Song:\u2026This was really a failed case of flattery.As a result, Yan Mu nodded seriously, \u201cWell, Xiao Yu is very good at it and knows a lot.\u201dZhong Zhenghan was speechless again. Maybe he didn\u2019t need to worry that Lu Chengyu would suffer. He should be worried that the employees of Huading International would suffer with their boss in love after all. They had such a boss, was there really no problem?Just when several people were defaming each other, suddenly there was a horrified and stern scream from the dressing room. Yan Mu and the others suddenly changed their complexions, turned and ran in the direction of the dressing room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 54.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54.1Lu Chengyu changed into the costume, sat in front of the mirror and waited for the makeup artist to remove his makeup. The makeup artist knew that he was uncomfortable after using the crew\u2019s makeup remover yesterday, and his skin was even slightly allergic, so he brought a bottle of his own high-end makeup remover. Seeing that Lu Chengyu had already sat down, she turned around and opened her cosmetic bag.After opening the cosmetic bag, she found that the contents inside seemed to have been touched, and there was also a three-finger-wide glass bottle. She curiously picked up the glass bottle and took a look, and suddenly screamed with fright, the bottle in her hand also rolled to the root of the wall.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Lu Chengyu was frightened by the scream and was in a cold sweat. Looking back, he saw that the makeup artist was sitting softly on the ground, his whole body still trembling, obviously falling into a mood of extreme fear. He stepped forward and helped the person to sit down on the chair, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cThere\u2026\u201d The makeup artist covered his face, not daring to look at the things at the root of the wall. Seeing her panic, Lu Chengyu turned to look at the corner of the wall and found that there was a glass bottle lying there, which seemed to contain something. After hesitating, he took a few tissues from the dressing table and held them in his hand, walked to the root of the wall, and picked up the glass bottle through the tissues.At this sight, he almost dropped the glass bottle to the ground, because there was a finger and eyeballs in the sealed glass bottle. He took a deep breath, enduring the strong nausea, and put the glass bottle back in the corner. Turning around, the makeup artist was already crying. As soon as he turned around and poured a cup of hot water, he saw Yan Mu, Zhong Zhenghan, and He Long rushing in. He hurriedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t destroy the scene, He Long, call the police right away.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Yan Mu saw that Lu Chengyu\u2019s face was ugly, and he stood in front of the makeup artist, as if blocking something for the makeup artist, knowing that there must be something extraordinary in the dressing room, and he turned to the clock beside him. He said, \u201cLet Zhang Dao stop the others and don\u2019t let them in.\u201d He glanced around the room and found something like eyebrow pencils and eye shadow boxes scattered on the floor, frowning even more tightly.Zhong Zhenghan also knew the seriousness of the matter, so he turned around and hurried to find Zhang Dao.\u201cSister Zhao, let\u2019s go out first,\u201d Lu Chengyu handed the water to the makeup artist Sister Zhao and helped her out of the chair to the door. Seeing that Zhang Dao and others came over, he handed Sister Zhao to other female crew members. After all, there are differences between men and women, and there are some things that are difficult for him to do as a man.He turned around and closed the door of the dressing room to prevent others from entering the dressing room so as not to spoil the scene.\u201cMr. Lu, the police call has been dialled, and the police there asked what happened?\u201d He Long handed the phone to Lu Chengyu.Others present also looked at Lu Chengyu curiously, because everyone could see that Lu Chengyu\u2019s complexion was very bad, and the makeup artist\u2019s mental state was also very bad. It was obvious that the matter was not small.\u201cHello, this is No. X, Village X, the third suburb of Beijing. Our crew is filming here. Just now we found a bottle with human eyes and fingers in the dressing room.\u201d Lu Chengyu watched when the other party asked him about the scene. He closed the closed door behind him, \u201cYes, the scene has been protected.\u201dDirector Zhang and others heard the words like eyes and fingers, and their complexion changed suddenly. This was just a few days before their crew started, and they made a fuss. This kind of thing, if it was known by the media, wouldn\u2019t it be another bloody storm? Zhang Shuo looked at Lu Chengyu and then at the makeup artist who was emotionally broken, and couldn\u2019t help sighing.Because the dressing room was next to another dressing room, there was no monitoring system installed here, but one was installed on the door of this house. After all, there were some props of the crew inside. Losing it would not only cause economic losses, but also delay shooting progress.After Lu Chengyu hung up the phone, Yan Mu took the drink He Long brought over, unscrewed it, and handed it to Lu Chengyu: \u201cYou drink your saliva first.\u201d After Lu Chengyu drank several sips of the slightly sweet drink, he felt that the nausea in his heart was reduced quite a lot. When he looked up and saw Yan Mu looking at him worriedly, he smiled: \u201cI\u2019m fine, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Although he thought he is tough, he hadn\u2019t practiced to be calm in the face of such things.Yan Mu nodded: \u201cWhen the police arrives; it will be fine.\u201d Someone put this kind of thing on the set, which shows that this person is maliciously targeting the crew and that he has chosen such cruel methods. It also shows that this person has no basic knowledge of life or any respect for life, so this is a very dangerous person.Probably because this report may involve a homicide, several policemen arrived at the scene within 15 minutes.As soon as the lead officer Zhang entered the crew, he knew that the case was a bit troublesome. After all, people from the crew came and went, and there were many villagers and reporters and fans who visited the crew. In addition, the relationships between the entertainment industry were inherently complicated and needed to be investigated. It was not easy to find out suspicious persons.When he saw the informant, he was a little surprised. Even if he was someone who did not read entertainment newspapers, he could recognize that this person was Lu Chengyu, a top student of Q university who made a lot of noise some time ago. He took a minute and then stepped forward and said, \u201cHello, Mr. Lu, where is the scene where the suspicious object was found?\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s mood at this time had been calmed down a lot. He explained to the police the process of discovering these things, and the door of the dressing room opened, allowing the police officers to go in and collect evidence.\u201cWhen I found something, I was the only one with the makeup artist eldest sister in the room, and no one was there anymore.\u201d Lu Chengyu thought of the white fingers and eyeballs in the glass bottle, and his face suddenly became ugly. \u201cOutside the gate, the crew has installed a surveillance head. If you need it, you can call at any time.\u201d\u201cThank you, Mr. Lu, for your support to our work.\u201d As a policeman, he was most afraid of encountering situations where civilians did not cooperate. The attitude of the other party made him feel relieved. If the crew dealt with these things silently for their own benefit, then when they discovered the case, it would be more difficult to investigate the case. They had also investigated some cases in the entertainment industry before, and many times some crews will try their best to confuse them in order not to affect their reputation. A cooperative attitude like Lu Chengyu\u2019s, for Officer Zhang, was simply a matter of thankfulness.In addition, Police Officer Zhang discovered that although Lu Chengyu was frightened, his speech was very clear, and he knew to protect the scene after the incident. He was obviously a very calm person. He motioned to several colleagues behind him to go in for evidence. Instead of rushing in, he asked, \u201cHowever, before entering the dressing room, did you find anything unusual?\u201dLu Chengyu thought about it carefully, then shook his head, \u201cThere are several makeup artists in our crew. Sister Zhang is mainly responsible for the makeup for me and the other two starring actors. Before I entered the dressing room, Sister Zhang was chatting with another makeup artist, and then another makeup artist was going to make up for the other actors on-site. So, when we found something, only the two of us were there.\u201dOfficer Zhang thanked him again after hearing this, and turned to the dressing room. After a while, he walked out with an unpleasant face, and when he saw Lu Chengyu standing with a man in a suit and leather shoes, he stepped forward and said, \u201cMr. Lu, after forensic identification, these things are indeed part of the human body, but what exactly are they? The situation needs to be confirmed by a forensic doctor after returning to the police station. I hope that you can cooperate with our investigation, and my other colleagues will come over soon.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLu Chengyu understood that this matter was not easy, so he talked Zhang Shuo. After speaking, he asked the staff to make list of crew members, and by the way, see if there was anyone on leave or anybody who had taken leave without any reason.Yan Mu was a little worried. He wondered, if this person was targeting the crew, the makeup artist, or the investor Lu Chengyu? He stepped aside to call Mu Qihua and asked him to find a way to suppress any news about the crew today, otherwise the whole matter would become more complicated.After he finished the phone call, the police and Lu Chengyu had finished talking. He walked to Lu Chengyu and said, \u201cCall Zeyun to come to our house to change your dressing at night.\u201d He knew that there would be a delay in this matter today, and he would not be able to go to the hospital. But Lu Chengyu rolled in sewage in the afternoon. He was worried that the gauze was soiled. He had to change the gauze and medicine so that he could be relieved.\u201cOkay.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled at him, stretched out his hand and patted the back of his hand to let him not worry about himself. Although Zhang Zeyun was not a well-known doctor in the country, he was still trustworthy in medical skills. The two went to one side and sat down, and saw a policewoman making notes from the statement of Sister Zhang. Sister Zhang\u2019s mood had gradually stabilized, and she was talking to the policewoman about the whole process.Withdrawing his gaze, Lu Chengyu hesitated and said to Yan Mu: \u201cI think the person behind the scenes seems to be targeting me or warning me.\u201d Thinking of the strange reporter he met on the day he started up, he subconsciously felt that it was one of the two. There was a connection between them. But he couldn\u2019t figure out who would specifically target him. Except for the Liang family, he seemed to have not encountered anyone who would want to specifically target him.Yan Mu frowned. This was exactly what he was worried about, but he was afraid that Lu Chengyu would become even more worried, so he didn\u2019t express these thoughts, \u201cMaybe people who are jealous of you do such crazy things. The entertainment industry is so complicated. Who would know what those people are thinking?\u201dThe second group of police arrived quickly, and then quickly surrounded the scene with a cordon, and only allowed everyone to leave after the police had recorded a statement of everyone on the scene. As the victims of the case, Lu Chengyu and Zhang Jie were also asked many questions. Finally, when Lu Chengyu successfully left the crew, several hours had passed.He was now in a hungry state but had no appetite. After returning to Yan Mu\u2019s villa, he lay down on a comfortable sofa and didn\u2019t want to move at all.As a result, after he lay for less than five minutes, Zhang Zeyun came over with the medicine kit, followed by Zhuang Yu who liked to join in the fun. When the two saw Lu Chengyu lying on the sofa, they thought that Lu Chengyu was frightened by what happened at the crew, Zhuang Yu stepped forward and patted him on the shoulder, \u201cHey, buddy, haven\u2019t you relaxed yet?\u201dLu Chengyu glanced at him quietly. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201cI eat when I am hungry. Brother Mu is short of food here?\u201d Zhuang Yu took an apple from the table and handed it to Lu Chengyu.He shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat it, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201dSeeing that he didn\u2019t want it, Zhuang Yu took a big bite and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a small part of the human body? Is there anything to be afraid of?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of it when it is growing on the body. It will be different when it is removed. You are speaking very calmly, looks like you are very courageous.\u201d Lu Chengyu got up from the sofa, sat cross-legged with a pillow, rolled his eyes at Zhuang Yu, turned on the TV and found a comedy to put on. Zhuang Yu shrugged and said, \u201cI\u2019m not as unlucky as you.\u201d\u201cOkay, Lao Zhuang, stop making trouble,\u201d Zhang Zeyun put the medicine box on the coffee table, and saw Yan Mu looking at him with burning eyes, knowing that the other party was waiting for him to change Lu Chengyu\u2019s dressing, and said, \u201cXiao Lu, take your hand and stretch it out.\u201d After removing the gauze, he saw that the wound was recovering well, there was no infection or inflammation, and he said: \u201cThe wound is recovering well.\u201d He took the medicine and put it on a clean gauze for Lu Chengyu. He looked back at Yan Mu and found that he stood silently behind him, and his hands shook in fright, \u201cMu Ge, if you stand behind me like this, I will be scared and have a psychological shadow.\u201dYan Mu heard that Lu Chengyu\u2019s wounds healed very well, so he was in a good mood, and didn\u2019t care about Zhang Zeyun\u2019s complaint at all. Instead, he said, \u201cYou sit for a while, I\u2019ll cook something, and we will eat it as supper.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With behaviours like this, if his wife was a fierce woman in the future, Zhuang Yu would probably have a very difficult life.\u201cScram, you bastards who cut brothers for women\u2026\u201d\u201cXiao Yu respects women.\u201d Yan Mu leaned out half of his body from the kitchen and said blankly, \u201cI didn\u2019t target you specifically for women.\u201d At some point, he must resolutely defend his unshakable position.Zhuang Yu gaped and watched Yan Mu suddenly stretch out half of his body from the kitchen, and then suddenly retract his head. It took him a long time to say to Lu Chengyu, \u201cBrother, are you under pressure by Mu Ge?\u201d Although he and Yan Mu had been together since childhood but there had been many times that he felt pressured by Yan Mu.\u201cWhat pressure can there be?\u201d Lu Chengyu raised his eyebrows, \u201cI think he is pretty good.\u201dZhuang Yu was silent for a moment, and then sighed, \u201cYou really are a natural pair.\u201d Although he didn\u2019t believe in love, because he was scum, but he still had hope that people around him would meet a reliable love. Instead of marrying a man like his mother did and being ruined for a lifetime.Zhang Zeyun smiled when he heard the words, because he himself felt the same as Zhuang Yu when facing Yan Mu. Now, seeing that Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu got along so comfortably. As Yan Mu\u2019s friend, he was very happy for Yan Mu. The only thing he was worried about was\u2026 the possibility of Mu Ge becoming a husband slave was too great.Soon, Yan Mu brought out the prepared things. Each person had a bowl of very fragrant chicken noodle soup and some fried green side dishes. Yan Mu had avoided the red, white and slimy foods that would easily cause Lu Chengyu to associate with blood.Lu Chengyu looked at the things on the table, his heart moved slightly, how much does one person value another person, so that he would even consider such small things? He immersed himself in the noodles with chopsticks, the taste was so good, he even had the urge to eat another bowl of noodles.\u201cBrother Mu, you are feeding rabbits,\u201d Zhuang Yu just complained, and then quickly reacted, so he smiled and picked a dish into his bowl, \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten such a delicious dish for a long time.\u201d He moved the mushroom stir-fried vegetables in front of Lu Chengyu, \u201cXiao Lu, eat more of the dishes you like.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu picked a dish, smiled at Zhuang Yu, and continued to eat.Yan Mu felt relieved when he saw that he had an appetite. He heard from He Long that Lu Chengyu hadn\u2019t eaten since noon today. The filming was already exhausting, but as a result, he encountered these things again. It hurt his stomach not to eat, how could he not worry.After eating, Zhang Zeyun and Zhuang Yu were too embarrassed to be light bulbs, and soon left. That night, Yan Mu was worried that Lu Chengyu\u2019s sleep might be affected by things during the day, so he got up several times at night to listen to the noise outside Lu Chengyu\u2019s door. He was relieved to see that Lu Chengyu had been sleeping well.\u2026.Because of Mu Qihua\u2019s pressure on the crew, the media did not report much, but some people in the circle knew that a criminal case had occurred in a certain crew, but no one was talking too much. So, all night after this matter, no one discussed it without thinking.Early the next morning, because the crew was temporarily unable to film, Lu Chengyu found boring to stay at home alone, so he simply proposed to go to the company with Yan Mu.After Yan Mu heard about it, he disagreed, \u201cThere are many people in the company, and many people like to work with you. What if it affects the injury on your hand?\u201dBecause Lu Chengyu was very popular in the company, the management in the company sometimes called him to deal with some employee disputes. In the past, Lu Chengyu had good skills and he was not worried. But now he was worried that the conflicting parties would start a fight, which will hurt Lu Chengyu. What if the injury got worse?\u201cThere is no such exaggerated things. The colleagues in the company know that I am injured, and they will definitely not ask me to do these troublesome things,\u201d Lu Chengyu said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for me to stay at home alone. If you don\u2019t worry about me, I can handle the work in your office, right?\u201d He knew that there were many things in the company, but because Yan Mu didn\u2019t want to tire him, he kept working overtime secretly. Now that he was free to go to the company, he could more or less reduce his workload.Yan Mu was helpless. He knew Lu Chengyu\u2019s temperament, so he had to say, \u201cOkay, but before you do anything, you must get my consent.\u201d\u201cYes, I will strictly follow the orders of the superior,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and followed Yan Mu out the door. After the two got into the car, he suddenly remembered that he still had something to move in from his home, so he said, \u201cBoss, after work in the afternoon, let\u2019s go to my house to get some things.\u201dYan Mu nodded, sat down and said to He Long who was sitting in front, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He was anxious for Lu Chengyu to move everything in with him. This would show that Lu Chengyu would not have the idea of moving back to his own home.When the car drove to the company, Yan Mu led Lu Chengyu through the main entrance of the company as usual. Under the attention of the staff, the two entered the elevator.\u201cPresident Yan, Assistant Lu,\u201d a few company employees in the elevator greeted them politely after seeing them. It happened that Tang Xuan was also in the elevator. After greeting Yan Mu, she said to Lu Chengyu, \u201cXiao Lu, your luck is so good, you are about to become an injured professional.\u201d\u201cSister Xuan, don\u2019t make fun of me.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled bitterly, \u201cIt sounds like I am Sister Lin.\u201d\u201cSister Lin doesn\u2019t get hurt very often,\u201d Tang Xuan said. Although, it was not easy for Tang Xuan to continue joking with Lu Chengyu because of the presence of the president. \u201cYou came to the company today. In the past few days, there were still people spreading rumours that you are going to quit your job and concentrate on being an actor.\u201d\u201cWho said this? I just go take small roles in movies occasionally, and I am not a professional actor. Is it not like eating this bowl of rice, but waiting to be starved to death?\u201d He said half-jokingly and half-seriously, \u201cIt is more practical to be an assistant to the president, right?\u201d He tilted his head and smiled at Yan Mu.The corner of Yan Mu\u2019s mouth bent, and he said in a deep voice: \u201cWell, follow me, I won\u2019t starve you to death, but can also help you fatten up to be slaughtered.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgTang Xuan and the other people in the elevator looked sideways. He\u2019s joking, Assistant Lu must have made the president crooked.The people in the elevator went out very quickly, and when they got to the floor of the president\u2019s room, only Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu were left.Lu Chengyu kept his promise and carried the computer into Yan Mu\u2019s office. After adjusting into a comfortable posture on the sofa, he started to operate the computer with one hand.In the morning, there were several managers who came up to report their work. After entering the president\u2019s room and seeing this scene, they thought in their hearts that Secretary-General Cao\u2019s position in the president\u2019s heart might have dropped.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t care what these people thought. While listening to these people\u2019s reports, he quickly called up the report content with his left hand to see if it was true. The speed of the hand was so fast that almost everyone in the room felt like worshipping him. He was so powerful at a young age, and he would go against the sky in a few years.\u201cI know what you said,\u201d Yan Mu glanced at the financial manager. \u201cThe company\u2019s fiscal budget in the first half of the year exceeded the standard a lot. I hope that this problem will not occur again when I get the report at the end of the year.\u201dLu Chengyu checked the computer. The data shown above made him frown slightly. There seemed to be something wrong with this financial data table. He looked up at Yan Mu and saw that Yan Mu\u2019s expression was much more serious than usual, knowing that Yan Mu might know this in his heart, he continued to listen in silence.\u2026.Cao Jingshen felt that he had it very hard lately. Although the overtime pay was very generous, he was almost always exhausted. When he went to eat at noon, there were people who said in front of him about how good Lu Chengyu was, this was such an obvious instigation. If he could still be fooled, it would simply be a pig\u2019s brain. And these people didn\u2019t know that he found Lu Chengyu very pleasing to his eyes?\u201cAssistant Lu is young, and the president will inevitably take care of him more. It is said that the president specially ordered a takeaway for Assistant Lu at noon, and it was from Baiweixuan.\u201d The other took the conversation and said with emotion, \u201cWe are over 40 years old. We are not as motivated as young people anymore. Oh, yes, what Secretary-General Cao would like to eat, I will treat you at noon today.\u201d\u201cI will eat by myself, thank you,\u201d Cao Jingshen sighed. Such a straight fishing hook used to lure him was embarrassing. Was this despising his IQ or despising him?After eating, Cao Jingshen returned to his office and did not sit for a while. He saw Lu Chengyu holding a pile of documents down. His relaxed appearance was nothing like an injured person. Looking at his arm, Cao Jingshen said, \u201cHow is your wound, has it healed? You only had an operation a few days ago. You came to work today. You don\u2019t need your hands?\u201d\u201cMy wound is recovering well, and I stay home every day. It\u2019s not interesting at home,\u201d Lu Chengyu gave Cao Jingshen the information, \u201cThese are some things I found, I think you may need it.\u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d Cao Jingshen took the information, \u201cI heard that you have been staying in President\u2019s office from morning?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Lu Chengyu sat down on the sofa, \u201cwhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cProbably some people are envious and jealous of you,\u201d Cao Jingshen sighed and didn\u2019t know what was going on. He felt that the boss was really kind to Lu Chengyu. \u201cThe fire has burned to me.\u201dLu Chengyu sneered, \u201cSomewhat. People are really enthusiastic.\u201d He looked at Cao Jingshen helplessly, a little speechless, \u201cI am an assistant to the president and staying in Mu Ge\u2019s office to handle work, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cProbably because they are worried that my position as secretary-general will be affected.\u201d Cao Jingshen pushed his glasses, and sneered like Lu Chengyu, \u201cIt makes it look like we are fighting for favour.\u201dLu Chengyu silently glanced at Cao Jingshen, \u201cI don\u2019t need to fight for favour, I\u2019m already together with Brother Mu, now.\u201d He felt that with the working relationship of the three, Cao Jingshen would know this sooner or later. Rather than let the other party suspect that they didn\u2019t treat him as a friend, it was better to take the initiative to tell the other party, anyway, it was not a shameful secret.\u201cThat\u2019s definitely not necessary. We are not women. What are we fighting for\u2026\u201d Cao Jingshen almost flicked the glasses off his face, \u201cWhat! Together?!\u201d Did he hear something wrong?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I thought it was the people on the internet who were talking nonsense. I didn\u2019t expect it to be me who is too naive.\u201d But, how could this be? The two people walked together so silently, so fast that he couldn\u2019t react.\u201cThis happened just a few days ago. I told you when I came to the company. Is it enough buddy?\u201d Lu Chengyu lied on Cao Jingshen\u2019s desk with a smile, \u201cI haven\u2019t come to work these days. Thank you for your hard work.\u201d\u201cWho is your buddy?\u201d Cao Jingshen snorted, then looked at Lu Chengyu with a sceptical look, \u201cYou tell me this, maybe you want me to prevent other women in the company from approaching the boss, right?\u201d It\u2019s not that he is too careful, but Lu Chengyu was really thinking too much.\u201cHow is it possible that I am that kind of person?\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed, \u201cYou really don\u2019t know me, further with a self-disciplined person like Brother Mu, how could that happen.\u201d\u201cYeah, I just know too much. You\u2019re here,\u201d Although Cao Jingshen was not glaring at him, he still knew a little bit about Lu Chengyu. This person seemed to be personable, but in fact he was small-minded and loved to hold grudges. No matter how good his words were, he couldn\u2019t hide his fox-like nature, \u201cThat\u2019s why I doubted you.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and didn\u2019t refute. He raised his wrist and looked at the time, \u201cForget it, I\u2019ll go up and do things. Brother Mu stayed up late and worked overtime every night, and if he stayed up, I would be worried that it would affect his health.\u201d\u201cOkay go,\u201d Cao Jingshen drove Lu Chengyu out like a fly. He waited until the office door was closed and frowned.\u201cHow come the two of them are together?\u201d As a straight man, Cao Jingshen didn\u2019t quite understand how people of the same gender fell in love, not to mention the resistance from the Yan family and the Mu family behind them. This kind of love affair that was not in line with secular values seems to be unopposed by many people on the internet, and even a large part of them were supportive. But in fact, after leaving the online world, many people could not accept homosexuality, and some even found it disgusting and perverted.The reality was often more cruel and helpless than the internet, but no one could leave the herd and live alone[1] .\u201cBoss, this is the revised travel schedule.\u201d Tang Xuan came in with the report. Seeing Cao Jingshen\u2019s face was not so good, she smiled and said, \u201cBoss, your expression seems as if you owe someone five hundred yuan, why is it so stinky?\u201dCao Jingshen went through the schedule. This was a new schedule formulated by their secretarial department regarding the inspection of the branch next month. Because Lu Chengyu was injured, the plan was postponed for one month.\u201cSmall things,\u201d Tang Xuan saw that Cao Jingshen didn\u2019t want to mention anything else, so she said, \u201cThen I will go out.\u201d\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Cao Jingshen hesitated, then said, \u201cAre there any strange rumours in the company recently?\u201dTang Xuan raised her eyebrows and asked instead, \u201cFor example, what kind of rumours?\u201d Did the boss really start to be jealous of Assistant Lu?\u201cFor example\u2026 Mr. Yan and Assistant Lu?\u201d Cao Jingshen gave a dry cough, \u201cAre you there?\u201d\u201cBoss, you don\u2019t believe these messy rumours too?\u201d Tang Xuan frowned, thinking of someone in the company talking. There were various internal battles between other people and Lu Chengyu, so she asked with some suspicion, \u201cBoss, Assistant Lu is not that kind of person, don\u2019t believe other people\u2019s nonsense.\u201dCao Jingshen looked at Tang Xuan speechlessly. He felt that the other party had misunderstood. He then helplessly said: \u201cI am asking about the Boss and Assistant Lu, do you understand?\u201dTang Xuan was stunned for a few seconds before she suddenly realized, \u201cI understand, it\u2019s all on the Internet. Don\u2019t take it seriously boss, you will lose.\u201d After saying this, she remembered what happened in the elevator in the morning. In the scene, although the relationship between Boss and Assistant Lu was really good, she would never believe that the two first-class men had automatically paired, which was not in line with her outlook on life.\u201cI see, you can go out.\u201d Cao Jingshen was relieved, knowing that no one in the company believed that Lu Chengyu and the boss had a relationship. After all, Lu Chengyu would be the one who was most affected after the incident came out.After Tang Xuan got out of Cao Jingshen\u2019s office, she glanced behind her with suspicion. Could it be that she really used a villain\u2019s heart to judge a gentleman\u2019s belly[2] ?\u2026.In the afternoon, Lu Chengyu stayed in Yan Mu\u2019s office as usual. Every executive who came to Yan Mu would look at him a few more times, and then discuss some company decisions with Yan Mu in a very serious manner.\u201cAssistant Lu, there is a gentleman named Zhang Hong at the front desk who wants to see you.\u201d The phone from the front desk called directly to the president\u2019s office, which made Lu Chengyu a little unable to look directly at him. Dis everyone in the company know that he was in the president\u2019s office all day?\u201cI see, he is my friend. Please lead him to the hospitality room and I will be there, right away.\u201d Lu Chengyu knew that Zhang Hong was not a person who came to the company to find him without reason, so he logged out of the webpage and wiped his login traces.\u201cYour college friend?\u201d Yan Mu still had an impression of Zhang Hong, so when the front desk mentioned this name, he knew who it was. \u201cGo down and have a look.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Lu Chengyu nodded and closed his notebook. He put the computer on the sofa, adjusted the collar and left the office. When he took the elevator to the reception room for foreign guests, he saw Zhang Hong sitting on the sofa holding a cup of coffee. He seemed to have a leisurely manner. He felt like he was thinking a little bit more.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Lu Chengyu walked to Zhang Hong and sat down, patted him on the shoulder, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for a while, you seem to be a lot darker.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all because of going out for business,\u201d Zhang Hong, a big man, didn\u2019t care about his skin. He just saw Lu Chengyu\u2019s beautiful appearance, and suddenly felt that his appearance scores had been compared a lot. He sighed, \u201cForget it, I don\u2019t have to be handsome in front of you. I came today because we wanted to find Huading Investment for a project in our company. The manager knew that I was a classmate with you, so he sent me to the back door.\u201d\u201cWhat project \u201cLu Chengyu did not want his buddy to embarrass himself,\u201d I\u2019ll take a look. \u201cZhang Hong put the contracts in Lu Chengyu\u2019s hand, \u201cEven though we are brothers, you don\u2019t have to make things difficult for yourself. Anyway, I am only being trained by the manager. It doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t get this project.\u201d\u201cYou think I can open the back door for you, but I\u2019m a good and honest young man.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and took the planning book. After reading it through, he found this project and the development plan to be very innovative, and he remembered that Zhang Hong mentioned the cooperation with Huading in the previous life, and in the end both parties made a lot of money.\u201cThis planning book is very well done. It is very innovative and close to life. I will show it to the boss for you. As for whether the boss can agree or not, it is not my decision.\u201d Lu Chengyu closed the planning book. \u201cHow\u2019s the company doing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Zhang Hong said with a smile. Obviously, he was more comfortable at work. \u201cIt\u2019s no big trouble. It\u2019s not as good as your development, even the front desk downstairs. After the receptionist heard that I was your friend, she became more enthusiastic about me.\u201d\u201cI am a genius, and most people are destined to get hurt more than I am,\u201d Lu Chengyu joked, \u201cSo, it\u2019s normal to be inferior to me.\u201d\u201cYou, this skin is thicker than riding on a rocket, but how could you grow so fast?\u201d Zhang Hong knew that although Lu Chengyu was doing well now, he did not look down on his good buddies, so he didn\u2019t care about Lu Chengyu\u2019s jokes. In other words, he dispelled the uncomfortable feeling of asking for Lu Chengyu help, \u201cThank you for this matter today.\u201d\u201cA word of thanks is fine. If the matter is settled, please invite me to dinner,\u201d Lu Chengyu shook his head and said, \u201cEverything is empty. It\u2019s safe to eat until you eat it.\u201dWhen the two were talking and laughing, suddenly the door of the reception room was knocked, and Lu Chengyu said, \u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cExcuse me,\u201d the new secretary in the secretarial department knocked on the door. She gave Lu Chengyu a timid smile. \u201cAssistant Lu, Mr. Cao asked me to give this to you.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu took the item and found it was a USB flash drive, so he put it in his pocket and said a thank you to the little one who brought it. The secretary smiled.The little secretary left the hospitality room with a blushing face, and did not forget to close the door for the two of them.\u201cPeople like you are simply men\u2019s enemies,\u201d Zhang Hong knew that Lu Chengyu was busy with work, so he said, \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t delay your time. I will invite you to dinner when things are settled.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Lu Chengyu was not polite to him, and stood up and said, \u201cThen I will go up first, call me if I have anything else to do.\u201dZhang Hong made a good gesture, turned around and left Huading. Friends for so many years, many times need not be so polite.After he walked to the lobby downstairs, he saw the beautiful lady at the front desk smiling and saying goodbye to him. He was happy to walk out of the door of Huading Company. No wonder, Huading was more successful than their company, as even the smiles of their front desk sisters were gentler than their own company\u2019s front desk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I took a look. This profit is for us. For Huading, it is not a big piece of meat, but there is still a lot of profit,\u201d Lu Chengyu handed Yan Mu the planning book, \u201cThis piece of cake is too big for the other party to eat, so he came to us.\u201dYan Mu heard Lu Chengyu. The words were only about business, and he knew that the other party was unwilling to affect the company\u2019s profits for personal reasons, he said, \u201cHe is your friend.\u201d\u201cBrothers must settle accounts clearly, and friends must do the same,\u201d Lu Chengyu continued with a smile. On the sofa, \u201cWhat\u2019s more, I still have 2% of the company\u2019s shares. I don\u2019t want to make fun of my money.\u201d\u201cI will take a good look. I will discuss whether to invest in the meeting tomorrow.\u201d Yan Mu frowned when he saw him starting to play with the computer again. \u201cYour wound is not healed. Don\u2019t get too tired.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m used to it . It\u2019s the left hand.\u201d Lu Chengyu stretched out his left arm, and then quickly controlled the keyboard to issue an offensive command to some software. What he found surprised him, \u201cBoss, how is the relationship between Shengrong and us?\u201d\u201cYou mean Shengrong Company under the name of Sheng Yuyuan?\u201d Yan Mu listened to Lu Chengyu\u2019s mention of Sheng Yuyuan, and asked: \u201cWhat happened to this company?\u201d\u201cA while ago didn\u2019t you say that Shengrong Company intends to enter the capital market after Liang\u2019s vital injury?\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at what he found with interest, \u201cHowever, after I found out that Yao and Li\u2019s family had been liquidated, the company\u2019s advancement momentum stopped.\u201d\u201cSheng Yuyuan can catch up. The path of these two families is not strange,\u201d Yan Mu said with a calm expression. \u201cThis person is very cunning. There is a name in the mall called Thousand-faced Fox. Yao and Li are his paths, but they are not his only ones. He has stopped his momentum now because the situation in the capital is tense. He doesn\u2019t want to start rolling in the muddy water before he gets the profit.\u201d\u201cThe name of a Thousand-faced Fox is really vulgar,\u201d Lu Chengyu told Yan Mu. He still had the impression of Sheng Yuyuan from the bidding in City M. Although the other party was very gentle and close, he could feel the person\u2019s aggressiveness subconsciously, \u201cIf one can come out with this title, that person must have read a lot of novels.\u201d\u201cMaybe, I heard that he himself likes this title.\u201d Yan Mu didn\u2019t hate Sheng Yuyuan\u2019s style in the market, but he didn\u2019t particularly like it either. For this person, he was more inclined to alienate him. \u201cIf you meet this person, you shouldn\u2019t have any friendship with him.\u201cWorried that I will be cheated by him?\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and raised his head from the computer. \u201cIf I was cheated, you must remember to get him back for me.\u201dYan Mu solemnly nodded, \u201cNo matter what or who you encounter, I won\u2019t let you be alone.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled, \u201cI wrote this down, if you can\u2019t do it, I will do it at my own risk.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Yan Mu shook his head, \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you.\u201dAlthough this man was a little bit silent and couldn\u2019t speak sweet words, but such a serious promise still touched people\u2019s hearts. Lu Chengyu touched his chin, \u201cOkay, if you are lost, I will find you too.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Yan Mu hooked his mouth, feeling unusually happy.After the two got off work in the afternoon, He Long drove the car to Lu Chengyu\u2019s apartment, and the three went upstairs to move things together.Because there were no people living in the house for a few days, the house seemed exceptionally quiet. After Lu Chengyu opened the door, he found some things he used frequently from the room, and asked Yan Mu to help him move some things out of the study.Looking at the packed suitcase, Lu Chengyu said, \u201cI\u2019m really not used to it without these things.\u201d At the moment when the study door was closed, he also put the family photo on the desk into the suitcase, although his parents were no longer around, but there were some things that couldn\u2019t be forgotten.He Long dragged the suitcase and said with a smile, \u201cMr. Lu, this suitcase is really heavy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve put a few books in it,\u201d Lu Chengyu glanced at the unoccupied house, \u201cLet\u2019s go, go home. \u201cYan Mu shook his hand, \u201cAhh\u2026, let\u2019s go home.\u201d A place full of companionship could only be called a home, otherwise it was only just a house.He Long silently tried to lessen his sense of existence. Facing the employers\u2019 behaviour of showing affection all the time, he felt a lot of pressure as a single dog.When leaving the gate of the community, Lu Chengyu deliberately greeted a few familiar security guards, although the security guards were reluctant to have him leave. However, they also knew that Lu Chengyu was often troubled by the Liang family and living in their community was not safe enough, so they smiled and said goodbye to Lu Chengyu.\u201cMr. Lu is very familiar with these security guards?\u201d He Long did not expect that Lu Chengyu had a good relationship with those security guards. After all, in his perception, many owners would not even turn their heads when passing by the security guards.\u201cThe security guards in the community are good. They know that I live by myself. When I go home, they will bring me some home-made vegetables and tell me a lot of the principles of the older generation.\u201d Lu Chengyu said with a smile, \u201cEveryone here is good.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Mr. Lu is kind to them, and they are close to you.\u201d He Long was a veteran. When he was a child, his family conditions were not good. He looked at a lot of rich people with a low profile, and Lu Chengyu was like this. His behaviour was such that it was easy for him to get other people\u2019s favour, \u201cI can see that the security guards like you very much.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and did not continue to discuss the topic. For him, whoever treated him well, he would treat them well, which had nothing to do with money or status. In his eyes, those security guards were much lovelier and nobler than Liang Deyou and his ilk. Of course, he was not so lofty that he looked down on all the wealthy people. For example, those few friends of Yan Mu suited his appetite.Yan Mu glanced at Lu Chengyu, saw him smiling, and said softly: \u201cWill you go to the company tomorrow?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at him and said, \u201cWith me, your work will be a lot easier.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d not only did the work load ease a lot, but even the mood improved a lot. Yan Mu took his hand over, then put his hand on it, and buckled their fingers together, \u201cHaving you there is very good.\u201d In the face of employers who were showing affection all the time, He Long had gradually gained the function of selective blindness and deafness. Perhaps in the near future, he would be able to live a good life with a raise.When the car drove to a place not far from home, it was found that the road in front was blocked, and there were several traffic policemen standing in front. It seemed that there was a car accident.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Yan Mu frowned, because there were many high-end communities here, so the traffic situation had always been very good. He had lived here for a year or two and had never heard of a car accident.He Long got out of the car and went to the front to take a look, and then returned soon. His expression was a little strange and a little gratified, \u201cMr. Yan, there was a car accident ahead and a Maybach car was hit. The car that caused the accident was a speeding BMW, the owner of the car is dead. The traffic police are dealing with the scene of the accident. I glanced at the scene, and the crash was quite severe. The entire front of the car was sunken.\u201d\u201cMaybach?\u201d Lu Chengyu\u2019s brows twitched. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as the car we\u2019re in?\u201dHe Long\u2019s expression became even more strange. \u201cYes, the car models are exactly the same, and when the accident happened, it was the time when Mr. Yan got off work in the past.\u201dLu Chengyu frowned. When were there so many coincidences in the world, \u201cThe time has passed so long, why hasn\u2019t the scene been dealt with?\u201dHe Long got out of the car to inquire about it, and said after returning, \u201cI heard that the owner of the Maybach is a certain official. The new car was driven out as soon as they got it. Who knew they would encounter this kind of thing, their identity is not simple, and of course the matter is not so easy to deal with.\u201d Lu Chengyu faintly felt that something was wrong, he didn\u2019t know why.\u201cTurn the car around and drive the car to my other villa.\u201d Yan Mu took out his cell phone and called the relevant personnel to check if there was anything suspicious in the house he was now living in. If someone targeted him or Lu Chengyu, maybe they had put dangerous items in their home, and he couldn\u2019t risk their lives.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu anxiously, knowing that it was not easy, and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cBrother Mu, the community security conditions are so strict, it shouldn\u2019t be\u2026\u201d\u201cAnyone who can plan such a perfect car accident can also enter into the community and do tricks,\u201d Yan Mu said solemnly. \u201cWhat we need to do with this kind of thing is to be careful.\u201dLu Chengyu fell silent when he heard this. Although he had life experience in his previous life, he did not have any contact with certain people. At this level, he was still a novice. Yan Mu was a person who was accustomed to this circle. He knew more about the dark side than him. He thought it was better to listen to Yan Mu\u2019s opinions. Stubbornness was not one of his weaknesses.It only took less than half an hour for the car to drive into Yan Mu\u2019s other property. The new villa was very beautiful, it even had a swimming pool, spacious gardens and garages, and a fountain with statues. The level of luxury greatly surpassed the small villa where Yan Mu usually lived, and the whole property exuded the incomparable taste of a local tyrant. Even a person like Lu Chengyu who was not too new to money could not keep his eyes from sparkling.\u201cPeople come to clean here every week, and the furniture is all available, so there is no problem in staying overnight,\u201d Yan Mu said to He Long, \u201cyou live here tonight as well.\u201dHe Long nodded, if someone really targeted Mr. Yan, it\u2019s always safer to have one more person with Mr. Lu. Within less than ten minutes after their arrival at the villa, they saw a few black Audi cars driving in, and then a group of black bodyguards got out of the car, carrying silver suitcases in their hands, walking with their heads high and chests expanded.\u201cSir, you were frightened.\u201d The front man in the black suit took off his black glasses and greeted Yan Mu, and then made a gesture to the dozen black-clothed bodyguards behind him. There was a loud noise, and these people opened the suitcase on the spot and began to fiddle with the various security equipment in the suitcase.Lu Chengyu silently looked at the group of men in suits, and then at the magnificent building behind him. At this moment, he felt as if he was making a rich TV series, and he was the ugly duckling who had never seen the world.Obviously, when he entered Huading, he just wanted to become a successful person, not short of money or contacts, and then cheat his former opponents. But, why did the whole direction of life become weird after only half a year?Was it because he had a problem with his life trajectory, or was it because he found a tall, rich and handsome man with a very tall life trajectory?After these people set up the equipment, they started to set it up in various places, and scanned them inside and outside the house with various instruments. They didn\u2019t even let off the pumping valve of the swimming pool, and the grass was inspected inch by inch.\u201cSir, there is no problem with the roof,\u201d a man with a safety rope jumped down.\u201cSir, there is no problem in the house.\u201d\u201cSir, there is no problem with the lawn and swimming pool.\u201d\u201cThank you, everyone,\u201d Yan Mu nodded to these people.\u201cSir, you are being polite!\u201d The head bodyguard made another gesture. All these people quickly found where they should stand, and protected the entire villa without any dead ends.The head bodyguard patrolled all the places and made sure that there were no mistakes in the place where everyone was standing. Then he walked to Yan Mu again and said, \u201cMr. Yan, you can come in and rest.\u201d Yan Mu thanked him again and turned to Lu Chengyu: \u201cLiving here is only temporary. Tell me if you are not used to it.\u201dHe was shocked by the behaviour of these bodyguards, then he shook his head for a while and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s good here.\u201dYan Mu found him in a trance, thinking that he was still worried about what happened before, so he comforted, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, these people are special veterans, and they are very good in reconnaissance and skills. With them, we will not have security problems.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Lu Chengyu tried to adjust the expression on his face, and suddenly remembered one thing, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t go to my house to pick up things today, would it be us who had the accident?\u201dActually, this man calculated well. He even knew Yan Mu\u2019s usual living habits, so he arranged an accident that could happen at any time early. The only omission was that the people behind the scenes did not expect Yan Mu to change the routine today, and the Maybach that appeared at this time was not Yan Mu\u2019s car at all.However, it could be inferred from this that at least no one followed them on their way home. This was also a major failure of the other party. Why did the other party believe in Yan Mu\u2019s life so much? Did they deliberately investigate him? But even if the other party followed Yan Mu\u2019s living habits, he still felt that this time the incident was directed at him.Yan Mu frowned, \u201cDon\u2019t think too much. Maybe this is just a coincidence. \u201cAt this moment, his cell phone rang, and the call was made by the person responsible for checking the indoor security of the villa.\u201cMr. Yan, we found something wrong with the natural gas pipe in your kitchen. If it was not found in time, an explosion might have happened at night. There is nothing suspicious except for the natural gas leak in other places. \u201cThis was actually the most suspicious thing. Yan Mu looked at his mobile phone and his face suddenly became extremely serious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It took a few seconds for him to see that it was a bodyguard in a black suit. The bodyguard found that Lu Chengyu was frightened by him, so he grinned at Lu Chengyu, showing his neat white teeth, and then swished into a dark corner.Unable to pull the corners of his mouth up, Lu Chengyu couldn\u2019t sleep anymore. He walked to the window and looked around the entire villa. Compared with this villa, the small villa that Yan Mu lived in before looked much shabbier. He was still thinking in his heart, Yan Mu, compared with the Qi family, was not short of money and power, why did he live in such a small house. When he got here today, he realized that it was not that he liked to live without lavishness, but that the other party was used to living alone.Not long after they entered the villa, so-called chefs, babysitters, gardeners, and housekeepers appeared. These people were dressed in elegant costumes and showed their respect for the host. They called Yan Mu Mr. Yan and called him Mr. Lu, just like rich men in a TV series, it was luxurious and exquisite.It was in such a moment that he suddenly realized that the gap between him and Yan Mu was not only money and power, but also family heritage.The moonlight outside the window was like frost, Lu Chengyu looked out the window silently, and sighed after a long while. It seemed that if he wanted to be with Yan Mu, he needed to work harder, otherwise the gap will increase more and more. Moreover, people might also come to separate their pair of mandarin ducks.People say that finding a daughter-in-law was not easy. Why was it so difficult for him to find a man to live his life with? Life was so difficult.He went back to bed and lay down for a while. He really couldn\u2019t sleep. He remembered the USB flash drive Cao Jingshen asked someone to give him. He simply found his laptop. After plugging in the USB flash drive, he was not able to open the contents of the mobile folder. So, he started to check whether there were plug-ins or Trojan horses in the drive. To his surprise, there was a malicious plug-in in the USB flash drive that was hard to find.How could Cao Jingshen give him this kind of USB flash drive, or did the other party didn\u2019t know that there was such a thing in the USB flash drive?It took a lot of effort to clean up the contents of the drive. After opening the contents, he fell silent. Because there was no company information at all, there were only a few photos, and each of these photos was poking into Lu Chengyu\u2019s heart.The first photo was a group photo of his parents at the beach, the second was a live photo of his parents when they had an accident, the third was a photo of him wearing a bachelor\u2019s uniform when he graduated from university, and the fourth photo was a photo in which there was a glass bottle with eyes and fingers, there were only a few drops of dark red blood on the fifth sheet. On the blank paper, these drops of blood were particularly conspicuous. This thing was not given to him by Cao Jingshen at all, and the secretary who gave him the thing had a problem!\u2026.Because of yesterday\u2019s troubles, Yan Mu got up five minutes later than usual. He picked up the newspaper that the housekeeper had placed on the table and flipped it through, looked upstairs, and continued to read the newspaper. About twenty minutes later, Yan Mu finished flipping through a newspaper and looked up again.The housekeeper on one side stepped forward and said softly, \u201cSir, Mr. Lu hasn\u2019t gotten up yet.\u201d\u201cHe went to bed late last night,\u201d Yan Mu put the newspaper back on the table, \u201cLet them lighten their feet when they clean. It should not be noisy to Mr. Lu.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the housekeeper bowed slightly, walked to the side and took out the intercom. After a few commands, he turned around and saw Lu Chengyu walking downstairs. So, he put away the intercom, stepped forward and bowed to Lu Chengyu, \u201cMr. Lu, good morning.\u201d\u201cMorning,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled politely to the housekeeper, walked over to Yan Mu and sat down, yawned, and took the newspaper. After turning a few times, he found that there was no valuable news, so he yawned with boredom.\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep well last night?\u201d Yan Mu saw him like this, knowing that he hadn\u2019t slept well, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s eat breakfast, and after eating, you can sleep for a while.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want to go to the company today? \u201cLu Chengyu walked to the dining room and sat down. There were exquisite tableware in front of him. The knives and forks looked gleaming silver, the black chopsticks were also carved with lifelike patterns, and there was a very beautiful ornament in the middle of the dining table.The housekeeper brought the servant to put up the breakfast. The food was still what Lu Chengyu liked to eat, but the cook changed from Yan Mu to the cook in the villa.The breakfast tasted worthy of the title of the chef, and it was indeed very delicious, but Lu Chengyu found it awkward when thinking that these breakfasts were inferior to the taste of Yan Mu\u2019s cooking.In fact, Yan Mu would worry of Lu Chengyu was at home, so seeing Lu Chengyu insisting on going to work with him, he didn\u2019t insist on letting Lu Chengyu stay at home, but the car changed from Maybach into a black modified BMW.Bulletproof glass was used for all windows, and the front and rear of the car could withstand high-intensity impact. The black models were even more ordinary, and they were not conspicuous at all when they merged into the traffic.After Lu Chengyu got on the car, he found that they were also following a similar BMW, even the license plate numbers were very similar, only the middle number missing. These two license plate numbers alone were beyond the reach of ordinary people.\u201cIf you are sleepy, I will wake you up when we arrive at the company.\u201d Yan Mu saw that Lu Chengyu had been in a bad spirit, and he said after getting in the car. \u201cThere is still more than half an hour\u2019s drive from here to the company. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dLu Chengyu thought about it, with his head lying on Yan Mu\u2019s thigh, he closed his eyes to make up for his sleep. After being taken aback by the bodyguard last night, he hardly slept afterwards. He hadn\u2019t had insomnia for a long time, and the feeling of lack of sleep was not good at all.Seeing that Lu Chengyu was asleep, He Long slowed down the car a little, and silently looked around the road to avoid people or cars that suddenly rushed out.There was no problem driving the car all the way to the company. Lu Chengyu even found that there were two more imposing people at the company\u2019s gate. Although they were wearing security clothing, he felt that they had the taste of family. He glanced at Yan Mu. He was afraid that these two people were also specially arranged by Yan Mu.After entering the elevator, Yan Mu found out that Lu Chengyu had pressed the floor of Cao Jingshen\u2019s office, thinking that he had something to talk with Cao Jingshen, so he didn\u2019t care, just told him not to work too hard. Lu Chengyu nodded, and when he reached the floor, he smiled at Yan Mu before leaving the elevator. He went straight to the secretarial department, because he came to the company very late, so it was already past working hours, and those who should come to work had already arrived.\u201cAssistant Lu,\u201d it was no surprise that several secretaries saw Lu Chengyu. After all, Lu Chengyu came to their secretarial department several times a day.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cMorning,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled at them, and then seemingly inadvertently said, \u201cYou had a new person join a few days ago, why don\u2019t I see her today.\u201d\u201cShe quarrelled with Sister Xuan somehow yesterday afternoon. She packed her things and left, and didn\u2019t come to work today,\u201d a secretary said not very much. \u201cWho knows what\u2019s wrong with her.\u201dLu Chengyu raised an eyebrow unexpectedly: \u201cHow could this happen? She helped Brother Cao yesterday afternoon to bring me things?\u201d Tang Xuan walked out of Cao Jingshen\u2019s office, and when she heard Lu Chengyu\u2019s words, she frowned and said, \u201cShe is a newcomer, how could Cao Jingshen let her bring things to you? Isn\u2019t she looking for a reason to approach Lu Chengyu?\u201dThe other people present had the same thoughts as Tang Xuan, and they laughed when they heard the words, \u201cNo wonder she was arguing with Sister Xuan. What made her think that Assistant Lu had a good relationship with you? She must have been overturned with jealousy, right?\u201d\u201cFuck you.\u201d Tang Xuan turned a blind eye to her colleagues, \u201cThere are too many people in the company who are interested in Xiao Lu. If she is going to be jealous, can she eat it? The good sister is not Xiao Lu\u2019s type.\u201dLu Chengyu coughed dryly, \u201cCough-cough, don\u2019t use me to get rid of them. I\u2019ll go to your head Cao, and you can talk slowly.\u201dWhen the others heard these words, they immediately made fun of him. After Lu Chengyu entered the head\u2019s office, they separated, but they were still talking about some gossip about Lu Chengyu. For example, who was interested in Lu Chengyu, how Lu Chengyu was easy to get along with, and how he didn\u2019t put on airs after he flew up the tree[1]. How he was before is how he is now.\u201cI think Assistant Lu still has some changes,\u201d one person said hesitantly, and when the other colleagues looked at her together, she said, \u201cA lot more handsome.\u201d\u201cHuh!\u201d The others turned their eyes back together. Wasn\u2019t that nonsense?In the office, Cao Jingshen looked at a few pictures on the computer screen and said after a long while, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask anyone to give you anything yesterday afternoon.\u201d Seeing the last one, his face became more and more ugly, and he called the personnel department and told them to contact the new secretary. As a result, within a few minutes, someone from the personnel department told him that the secretary\u2019s cell phone had been turned off and the second contact number was empty.\u201cIt seems that someone is deliberately targeting you,\u201d Cao Jingshen frowned, \u201cbut why do they want to include your parents\u2019 photos?\u201d Was the person targeting Lu Chengyu related to his parents?Lu Chengyu shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know. The USB disk that the secretary gave me yesterday contained a malicious tracking and monitoring software. If it wasn\u2019t because I tried to clear it before opening it, then all the things in my computer would have been leaked.\u201dCao Jingshen\u2019s face suddenly turned uglier, \u201cThis thing, does the boss know?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell him later,\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed, \u201cI know this has nothing to do with you. If you want to target me, you won\u2019t use such stupid means.\u201dCao Jingshen took off his glasses. He felt that he didn\u2019t want to see Lu Chengyu\u2019s nasty face for the time being.After Lu Chengyu left the office, Cao Jingshen carefully looked at those photos, but couldn\u2019t see any clues, so he had to give up helplessly. The boss was there, Lu Chengyu should be fine.No one told Lu Chengyu about this, he just came to see Cao Jingshen\u2019s reaction. Seeing that the other party found it unexpected as much as him, he knew that his guess was correct. He vaguely felt that the person who gave him the USB flash drive was not the same person as the one who planned the car accident.The USB flash drive was not so much as a warning to him, as it was to remind him. Because he did not consider things from beginning to end. It was related to his parents, but the clues in the USB flash drive clearly pointed him a direction.However, he couldn\u2019t believe whether this direction was right or wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu Chengyu found the photos of playing on the beach. His and his parents\u2019 faces in the photos had bright smiles, and there were many tourists who also came to travel around showing in the photos.After carefully seeing all the photos three or four times, Lu Chengyu found that in their photos, several passer-by had strayed into their lens several times, but these passer-by\u2019s were both male and female, and even children wearing straw hats. Moreover, the faces of these people were not clearly photographed, and he couldn\u2019t be sure who these people were at all.When Yan Mu walked to Lu Chengyu, he found that Lu Chengyu was looking at his photos when he was with his parents, thinking that he was missing his parents, he said \u201cXiao Lu, tomorrow weekend, we will visit uncle and auntie together. You can consider it as meeting your parents!!\u201cOkay,\u201d Lu Chengyu pulled the person to sit down next to him, pointing to his photo when he had just graduated from high school, \u201cLook at me when I was young, was I very funny and handsome?\u201dThe boy in the photo smiled brightly. There was a gentle-looking woman behind him, and Yan Mu nodded, \u201cWell, you look a lot like auntie.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing to look like mother,\u201d Lu Chengyu clicked on several more photos to Yan Mu. In one of the photos, he was wearing a junior high school uniform standing on the stage to receive the award, and there were even photos of him attending a high school poetry recitation. \u201cThese are all taken by my parents.\u201d When he said this, his voice carried a sense of loss, it seemed that it was only yesterday when he was young, but in a blink of an eye he was older, and his parents were no longer there.\u201cI\u2019ll take your pictures for you in the future.\u201d Yan Mu reached out and touched Lu Chengyu\u2019s head, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad.\u201d\u201cWho said I was sad?\u201d Lu Chengyu twitched his mouth and smiled, \u201cActually, I want to show you something else.\u201d He closed the folder, clicked on the five photos copied to the computer last night, and then told Yan Mu what happened.Yan Mu repeatedly looked through these photos with a serious expression, and said in a deep voice, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will let someone check it out for you.\u201d He thought for a while, and made a call to Mu Qihua, \u201cWe will have lunch with my two cousins.\u201dLu Chengyu knew that he might be discussing this matter with the two brothers of the Mu family, and nodded, \u201cFor my business, should we trouble them?\u201d\u201cThe younger brother asks his brothers for help. What\u2019s the trouble in it,\u201d Yan Mu said indifferently, \u201cBrothers should always help each other, right?\u201dLu Chengyu raised his eyebrows and looked at Yan Mu. Seeing that the other party looked serious, he smiled but didn\u2019t refute.My business is your business, and your business is mine. Did Yan Mu mean this?\u2026.At noon, Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu arrived in Baiweixuan\u2019s private room and within five minutes Mu Qihua and Mu Qirong also arrived. Mu Qihua\u2019s attitude towards Lu Chengyu had improved a lot, and after the meeting, he did not mention that his grandfather asked him to bring something to thank Lu Chengyu, but said that Grandpa was very grateful to Lu Chengyu for his help.Lu Chengyu knew that the old man of the Mu family was not an ordinary person, and after a few words with Mu Qihua, he stopped talking about the famous old man, and instead talked about some irrelevant topics.After the meal was almost finished, Mu Qihua drank the soup and said, \u201cXiao Yan is not at work today. How did you two have time to invite us to lunch?\u201d After he finished, he pointed to the fish soup, \u201cThis mullet in the soup is good for wound healing. Xiao Lu can drink more.\u201d\u201cThank you, Brother Hua,\u201d Lu Chengyu took a bowl of mullet soup, and when it reached the corner of his mouth, he heard Yan Mu say, \u201cI do want to ask you for help.\u201d\u201cIs it the car accident yesterday afternoon?\u201d Mu Qihua kept the bowl down and looked at Lu Chengyu, \u201cIt might be something related to Xiao Lu.\u201d After he had said this, he still do not see panic in Lu Chengyu. After drinking the soup, he knew that Lu Chengyu might have a good idea about this, so he said, \u201cDo you want me to help you find out who is behind the accident?\u201dYan Mu nodded, and Lu Chengyu put down the soup bowl and said to Mu Qihua, \u201cThis time, I\u2019m troubling Brother Mu.\u201d\u201cBetween the two of you, there is no need to say that you are not involved,\u201d Mu Qihua waved his hand. \u201cThere is nothing simple behind this matter. Qirong and I have already found someone to investigate. I believe Xiao Yan is in your hands. Those people, have they also started to investigate this matter?\u201dYan Mu did not refute, but said, \u201cI guess this matter is related to Xiao Lu\u2019s parents.\u201d He told them about the USB flash drive in Lu Chengyu\u2019s hand.\u201cWell, this is a bit interesting,\u201d Mu Qihua said to Lu Chengyu with a smile, \u201cSomeone wants to harm you and someone wants to protect you secretly, but people on both sides threw you aside, it\u2019s interesting.\u201d\u201cYesterday, the second generation official drove the Maybach to pass by your side because he was eager to pick up a female artist after he bought this car from someone else,\u201d the taciturn Mu Qirong said at this time, \u201cthis female artist agreed to meet him, after discussing the time, this second-generation official was so dizzy by the female artist, how could he give up such a good date? Who knew that this kind of problem would happen halfway through?\u201d\u201cWho is that female artist?\u201d Lu Chengyu was a little bit surprised, \u201cWhat do you mean is that this female artist knows that someone wants to design against me, so she helped me find a dead ghost?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cThis second-generation official is not a good person. There are many women who have been ruined by him. He also killed a person because of drunk driving,\u201d Mu Qirong said coldly, \u201cWhether it was a coincidence, or someone secretly helped, he died unjustly.\u201dMu Qihua sneered, \u201cNo, he recently was infatuated with a woman surnamed Liu, and vowed to his friend that he would chase the person successfully within a week. As a result, if the person did not get the hand, her life would be lost.\u201dLiu? Lu Chengyu felt a little lost in his heart: \u201cBrother Hua, Brother Mu, the female artist you are talking about, isn\u2019t Liu Qiyan?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s her, you know this person?\u201d Mu Qihua lit a cigarette and held it in his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t think this woman is just an entertainer. There are many men in the capital who are interested in her. People who want to support her can line up around the capital. It\u2019s a pity that this woman is so skilled that no one has succeeded yet.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know this person.\u201d Lu Chengyu couldn\u2019t think of how Liu Qiyan would get along with him, and his parents were just ordinary people. Why did things develop in a strange direction? Also, did he really die accidentally in his previous life?\u201cWhy does she want to help me?\u201d Lu Chengyu\u2019s self-confident mind seemed to be inadequate at this time. \u201cShe and I have never met before. If she deliberately invited the second generation official to come out for me, the other party would get into a car accident, wouldn\u2019t it make her offend the second-generation official\u2019s father?\u201d\u201cSo many people in the capital can\u2019t manage the unspoken rules, do you think there is anyone behind her?\u201d Mu Qihua breathed out a smoke ring, and then blew it away. With a sigh, the smoke ring suddenly turned into blue smoke and dispersed, \u201cDon\u2019t say you don\u2019t understand, even I don\u2019t know which Buddha your parents have offended, and which noble person you met, and let them fight in the air and keep you dry.\u201dHearing this, Lu Chengyu\u2019s back was cold, and he suddenly remembered his previous life. After Liang\u2019s interview failed, other companies dared not hire him because of Liang Deyou\u2019s intervention. In the end, he went to work in an entertainment company somehow, as if it was because when he was eating out, someone was talking about which entertainment company was hiring?In fact, thinking about it now, it seemed that this matter was also quite suspicious. In addition to the fanfare of selecting artists, entertainment companies wouldn\u2019t make ordinary people know about other things. Moreover, celebrity assistants would not be recruit from among ordinary people. What if this person was a crazy fan of a certain celebrity?In this way, was it because someone deliberately led him to enter the entertainment company, and even more maybe this person wanted him to be an entertainer, but he just didn\u2019t know that this person wanted to increase his exposure and deepen the difficulty of another attempt to harm him? Or was this person trying to take advantage of his acting time and let him die by accident?However, what surprised this man was that, with his outstanding appearance, he had no intention of being an entertainer at all. Instead, he became Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s assistant. Later, he targeted by Huang Chuan halfway and was forced to leave the entertainment company.After that, he had been in various troubles in the capital. Even when he opened a restaurant, there were incidents of gangsters looking for trouble, unqualified sanitary conditions, and food poisoning among customers. Later, he lost a large sum of money, and the restaurant could not be opened anymore, so he went to a martial arts dojo as a training partner, but after working for more than a year, the martial arts dojo caught fire. He was supposed to be guarding the martial arts dojo that night, but he was greedy for supper, and he suffered a bad stomach, so he was sent to the hospital. Although his life was saved, the martial artist dojo couldn\u2019t be saved. Later, he simply left the capital and went to work in a hotel outside the city.When he became a lobby manager in the hotel and was about to be promoted, he unexpectedly died in the middle of the road. He used to think of his previous life and feel that it was rough and unlucky. But now when he thought of those things from the past, he felt both unlucky and fortunate, but there was also weirdness everywhere.\u201cIsn\u2019t your relationship with that Zhong Zhenghan very good?\u201d Mu Qihua pinched out the cigarette in his hand, and said with a smile, \u201cLiu Qiyan and him are at same brokerage company, you can ask him to help you inquire about Liu Qiyan, maybe there might be other discoveries.\u201dYan Mu looked up at his cousin who was relying on an artist to ask for the news. It would be better for them to find out more things, but this cousin had already opened the mouth, so he didn\u2019t talk about other things.Who knew that Lu Chengyu would agree to it, because only he knew how gossipy Zhong Zhenghan really is and how much he liked to inquire about these various scandals, but only few people in the company knew that he has such a hobby.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t react to Yan Mu\u2019s intention. He looked down at his chest. The pocket square placed in the pocket that he had been playing with before, had been neatly arranged by Yan Mu, and it looked very beautiful.\u201cWe decided yesterday that we would go to pay homage to uncle and aunt, did you forget?\u201d Yan Mu straightened his bow tie and tried to make himself look more energetic.\u201cHuh?\u201d Lu Chengyu remembered that Yan Mu had mentioned this to him yesterday, and he was stunned before saying, \u201cAre we really going to go today?\u201dYan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu suspiciously, as if he didn\u2019t understand why Lu Chengyu asked like that.\u201cThen let\u2019s go,\u201d Lu Chengyu saw Yan Mu\u2019s expression and smiled suddenly, \u201cSince we are going to pay a homage, let\u2019s go see your mother as well.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Yan Mu hooked his mouth and nodded.It may be because of rain, so although it was Saturday, the traffic volume on the road was less than usual. Lu Chengyu learned that Yan Mu\u2019s mother\u2019s tomb was on the same mountain as his parents\u2019 tomb after getting in the car.The black car shuttled in the rain curtain, passing by one pedestrian after another. Lu Chengyu looked at the pedestrians holding umbrellas outside the window. Because of the influence of the rain, he suddenly felt worse because he remembered his parents going out. It was the same weather on the day of the car accident.The two bought a few bouquets of flowers and a few sticks of incense in the flower shop under the mountain. The shopkeeper opened the shop here, mainly for customers who came to pay homage to their ancestors. After he saw Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu get out of the car, there were two people in black suits following them. He guessed that the identity of these two people was not simple, and he did not dare to introduce his products randomly. He would give them whatever they wanted.\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu took those things and smiled at the shopkeeper. The bodyguard behind him immediately took out the money for him and handed it to the shopkeeper.\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d the shopkeeper saw the money in his hand, and hurriedly found the change from the cabinet and handed it to the bodyguard. Seeing that the bodyguard was not answering, he looked at Lu Chengyu with an anxious facial expression.Upon seeing this, Lu Chengyu smiled and took the change, and then thanked the shopkeeper again before returning to the car with Yan Mu.Seeing Yan Mu looking at him with puzzled eyes, Lu Chengyu had no choice but to laugh: \u201cBehind us was the burly bodyguard. If we don\u2019t accept his change, he may be uneasy all night.\u201dYan Mu frowned: \u201cIsn\u2019t it okay to charge more money?\u201d\u201cYou said it, it\u2019s just a little money,\u201d Lu Chengyu said with a smile, \u201cIf there are five million, I believe many people are willing to take the risk. We only have fifty yuan here, and others would rather not take the risk. They would rather have peace of mind.\u201d After Yan Mu listened, he fell silent immediately. He didn\u2019t know enough about ordinary people\u2019s thinking. He didn\u2019t even understand this. It was obvious that they had already given the money and wanted to leave. Why didn\u2019t the other party dare to charge more?\u201cThis kind of error in understanding, in your capacity, may not be understood for a long time,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, then gently shook his hand, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter, you know a lot that I don\u2019t know, I know a lot that you don\u2019t know, this is called complementarity, right?\u201dYan Mu held Lu Chengyu\u2019s hand, then nodded, \u201cAs long as we are together, it will be fine.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled at him, and the two of them held each other\u2019s hands tightly.The car drove up the mountain along the winding road, and finally stopped in the middle of the mountain. Yan Mu opened the big black umbrella and put it on top of the two and walked towards the cemetery where Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents were buried, step by step.The graves of Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents were very clean. It could be seen that Lu Chengyu often came to visit the graves of his parents. The husband and wife were buried together, with pictures of the two on the tombstone. Yan Mu found that Lu Chengyu\u2019s appearance was more similar to that of his mother, but he was more masculine than his mother.In the photo, Lu Chengyu\u2019s mother\u2019s appearance was very beautiful, with the corners of her mouth slightly bent upwards, she looked extra peaceful and gentle, like a morning flower, which made people feel close to her at first glance.He looked at the name and raised his eyebrows in surprise. Lu Chengyu\u2019s mother\u2019s name was as gentle as her appearance, she was called Xia Yuxiu.\u201cMom and dad, I came to see you.\u201d Lu Chengyu lit the incense, bowed to the cemetery three times seriously, inserted the incense, and wiped the dust on the tombstone. \u201cAlthough it is raining today, your son found someone who can hold the umbrella for me.\u201d When he said that, he looked up at Yan Mu and smiled at him, \u201cThis guy next to me, he is rich and handsome, and he can cook, your son has picked up a great deal.\u201dYan Mu handed the umbrella to the bodyguard behind him, and squatted next to Lu Chengyu, then he took out a white handkerchief and started cleaning the tombstone carefully with Lu Chengyu, his fingers tracing the name of Lu Chengyu\u2019s mother. He said, \u201cUncle, auntie, I will treat Xiao Lu well and will not let him down. You are in heaven, and you must bless him, so that he is safe and sound.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHe also lit a stick of incense and stood up respectfully. He bowed respectfully to the tombstones of the two of them, and when the cold rain fell on his face, he suddenly realized that winter was approaching.Putting the incense in, Yan Mu stretched out his hand and patted Lu Chengyu on the back. Although, Lu Chengyu was smiling at this time, he could see the loss and sadness in the other\u2019s eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, I will always be with you. \u201cThe tombstone was wiped clean by the two of them. Lu Chengyu took a breath, looked at his smiling parents in the photo, and put a fresh bouquet on their graves, \u201cMy parents had a very good relationship. In my memory, they were on time every day. Even when they went to work, they never missed any activities related to me. If I did well, they would praise me. If I did not do well, they would not blame me, rather they would make suggestions and encourage me. I have never been beaten by them. They were always smiling, always kind and tolerant.\u201d After this, Lu Chengyu felt that he couldn\u2019t say anything. He stood up and looked at the faint mist at the foot of the mountain, \u201cWhen I was informed by the police about the car accident, I almost thought someone was playing a prank with me.\u201dYan Mu stepped forward and held his hand, taking the umbrella from the bodyguard\u2019s hand with the other hand, and personally propped it over Lu Chengyu\u2019s head, not even letting a drop of rain fall on him, \u201cWhen my mother died of illness, I was only ten years old. At that time, my grandfather told me that my mother was gone, and no one in Yan\u2019s family would stand up for me. He told me that from now on, the only thing I could rely on is myself.\u201dLu Chengyu felt that Yan Mu was pulling on his own wounds to comfort him, his heart warmed, and he couldn\u2019t help but look at him. \u201cIn the future, I will also be your support.\u201d\u201cSo, you are not alone,\u201d Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu with scorching eyes, \u201cYou still have me, and I still have you.\u201d In his heart, he felt like a handful of cany had been sprinkled and he felt really sweet. It was so sweet, that he couldn\u2019t feel any bitterness anymore. Lu Chengyu smiled at his parents\u2019 tombstone and said, \u201cMom Dad, you heard what he said. If he dares to break his promise, you must not be polite to him.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t go against it,\u201d Yan Mu suddenly solemnly knelt in front of the tombstone, \u201cMom Dad, I will take good care of Xiao Lu and will not let you down.\u201dLu Chengyu froze, Yan Mu was not such a person, who would actually make such a move. He watched the other person kneeling on the dirt without hesitation. Somehow, he also knelt down after him, tightly holding Yan Mu\u2019s hand and said to his parents\u2019 gravestone, \u201cMom Dad, I will definitely be fine, and you have to take care of yourself.\u201dMaybe people really had souls, and his parents were really looking at him. Lu Chengyu looked at the photos of his parents smiling, then turned his head to look at Yan Mu\u2019s profile, and pulled him up, \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. Look for Mother Mu.\u201dAlthough both of them were tall men, they were holding hands with incomparable warmth. Even the bodyguards behind them felt that although they were of the same gender, they seemed to be the best match in the world. By just looking at them, once could feel that they were full of love.Yan Mu\u2019s mother\u2019s tomb was still higher up on the mountain, and the two climbed the stone steps for a while before they found Mother Mu\u2019s tomb. Then Lu Chengyu discovered that Mother Mu was a very beautiful and temperamental woman. Although, she did not smile in the photo on the tombstone, her eyes were full of a unique womanly charm.Perhaps only such an excellent woman could influence Yan Mu a lot in just ten years. He should thank this great woman, because if it were not for her, there would not be such an excellent Yan Mu in his life. In general, he let him understand what love was and what was temptation in his second chance at life.At the moment when Yan Mu was kneeling before his parents\u2019 tombstone, Lu Chengyu finally understood the feelings of his heart. It turned out that love was so sudden and so beautiful that he felt that if he gave it up, it would be the greatest regret in life. He squatted next to Yan Mu and carefully wiped every corner of the tombstone, \u201cMother Mu, excuse me. My name is Lu Chengyu. I want to live with Brother Mu for the rest of my life. I hope you won\u2019t despise my gender.\u201dAfter listening to what Lu Chengyu said, Yan Mu\u2019s body trembled slightly. He looked at Lu Chengyu in surprise. He didn\u2019t expect that Lu Chengyu would say at his mother\u2019s grave that he would live with him for a lifetime. The happiness came so suddenly that he became a little overwhelmed.As if he had not seen Yan Mu\u2019s stupid expression, Lu Chengyu looked at the tombstone with a smile, as if it was not a cold tombstone in front of him, but a vivid person, \u201cThis man, Yan Mu, although his expression is a little bit unchanging, he has more money, he is a little handsome, and he is a very good partner. Mother Mu, please bless me, I will always hold this good man tightly in my hands, so that no one can take him away.\u201d\u201cThere will be no one else,\u201d Yan Mu took Lu Chengyu into his arms, \u201cThere will be no one else in this life.\u201dYan Mu\u2019s sudden movement stopped Lu Chengyu\u2019s words. He patted Yan Mu\u2019s back with his hand, again and again, but his gaze still fell on the tombstone photo, and the corners of his mouth gradually bent.A few steps away, He Long watched this scene quietly, somehow, he suddenly felt a little moved. Obviously, the two people in front of the tomb were just hugging simply, without making life or death vows, and no affectionate confession, but he just felt that his nerves were irritated, and his nose was a little sour and itchy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The car turned a corner and gradually left the cemetery where countless people were buried.On the way back, Lu Chengyu\u2019s mood obviously improved a lot. The two were about to discuss where to eat, but before they had reached a good deal, they received a call from Zhuang Yu, saying that they wanted to invite them to eat some special dishes.Lu Chengyu was very confident about the place where Zhuang Yu was treating them. When Zhuang Yu mentioned it, he agreed, and then said to Yan Mu, \u201cBrother Zhuang is an expert in the food industry. Compared with him, I\u2019m far from good.\u201dYan Mu\u2019s face remained unchanged and he said, \u201cHe usually goes everywhere to find food to taste when he is free. Of course, he knows more than you.\u201dLu Chengyu sighed when he heard the words, \u201cThe movie city under the name of Brother Zhuang will be enough for him to splurge for several lifetimes.\u201d He had heard about Zhuang Yu\u2019s father and stepmother, and he had no good impressions of Zhuang Yu\u2019s family, but because of this, he admired Zhuang Yu even more.To live so well under adversity and to run such a big movie city was what he could do.Yan Mu nodded when he heard this, \u201cIt\u2019s better than staying with the family and fighting with those brothers every day.\u201d However, even so, there would be other brothers calculating him. After those few people were cleaned up by Zhuang Yu several times, they slowly began to unite.\u201cIt\u2019s really bad for the rich.\u201d After Lu Chengyu finished saying this, he instantly felt that the relatives in his family seemed to be bad. Since his cousin got married, the relatives of the Lu family had never contacted him again. As for his mother\u2019s natal family, they had ignored him, as if he did not exist.Because his mother followed his grandmother\u2019s surname Xia back then, the people from her mother\u2019s family had never been very close to his mother, and they had moved around frequently these years. After his parents died unexpectedly, these relatives didn\u2019t know why stared at Lu\u2019s house, but he didn\u2019t let them calculate the property left by his parents. But since then, they went missing, and even when he called them by himself, they were also cold and indifferent, so now he didn\u2019t contact them anymore.Feelings were mutual, and no one loved hot faces and cold buttocks[1]. Although, he still didn\u2019t understand why his mother\u2019s family suddenly came out to help him with the Lu family, and then after the matter was settled, they all alienated him.\u201cThe richer people are, the more disputes there will be,\u201d Yan Mu said with a calm expression after watching more of the rich man\u2019s farce. \u201cMoney is people\u2019s object of greed, and no one can give up such a good thing. So, open and secret fights occur. All of this is all about money.\u201d\u201cYes, but who doesn\u2019t love money? Even ordinary people would quarrel with each other over a house and a car.\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed, \u201cIf I was born in a wealthy family, I might also let it go. If it is more than that, I would use all my means for the money.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Yan Mu shook his head decisively, \u201cIf it were you, you would definitely figure out how to make more money instead of trying hard and plan things to take over from your parents.\u201d\u201cIn your eyes, am I that good?\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled, and then exposed the topic, \u201cI am a wealthy man with a nine-figure asset now. A handsome guy came over and laughed at me. He made me happy to e laugh.\u201d Yan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu silently, and then poked the corner of his mouth with his right index finger.Lu Chengyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a while, there was a burst of laughter in the car.Yan Mu looked helplessly at the man lying on his lap laughing and stretched out his hand to stop his waist, lest he rolled to the ground, but the corners of his mouth slowly bent up.Zhuang Yu sat in the dining room, looking out the window from time to time, and then Qi Jingfeng said, \u201cWhat are they doing? It\u2019s already past twelve o\u2019clock, and I haven\u2019t even seen them from afar.\u201d\u201cThey will be here, don\u2019t be too anxious.\u201d Zhang Zeyun saw a few black BMW cars approaching. Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu were getting off the first car, but the expression on his face soon froze.\u201cFuck, he, they!\u201d Qi Jingfeng jumped up from his chair in shock, he pointed out the window in shock, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dZhuang Yu followed and almost scolded his mother with Qi Jingfeng, he knew the two were walking together, but they are holding hands outside, wasn\u2019t that too high-profile! Didn\u2019t they see how many people were watching them on the street?\u201cAs you can see, the two of them are together,\u201d Zhuang Yu tried to make his voice calm, \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d\u201cI know a shit, damn it, this is more than I earn tomorrow. One billion is incredible! Do you all know about this?\u201d Qi Jingfeng felt that he was not good. The legendary Yan Mu, who did not play with women and did not engage in promiscuity, was with a man?!This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cBe calm,\u201d Zhuang Yu smiled and drank a sip of tea. \u201cAfter they come in, you ask them.\u201d Qi Jingfeng made a cut and saw that Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu had already walked in, and didn\u2019t know what expressions to use while greeting them. Once the two men sat down, he hesitated and said, \u201cMu Ge, Xiao Lu, you two \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTogether,\u201d Yan Mu\u2019s calm expression stared back at him, \u201cYou are not mistaken,\u201d looking at Yan Mu\u2019s calm expression, Qi Jingfeng felt that he was acting a bit stupid. The masters of the family were so calm. He was so surprised by others, was he too unsteady? He drank a big sip of tea, and then smiled dryly, \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Yan Mu hooked his mouth, appearing even gentler.Yan Mu like this once again jumped Qi Jingfeng off, and after the food was on the table, he didn\u2019t slow down. After half of the meal, he hesitated and asked, \u201cXiao Lu, how long have you been with Mu Ge\u2026?\u201dLu Chengyu wiped the corners of his mouth and said with a smile : \u201cIt\u2019s not a long time, just after my arm was injured. \u201cAt this moment, Yan Mu looked at him in a swish manner and said, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t come to the hospital that day, we could be together an hour earlier.\u201d Qi Jingfeng twitched his mouth. He probably understood why Brother Mu was staring at him so coldly when he was at the hospital that day, maybe he was interrupting Mu Ge\u2019s confession at that time.Zhuang Yu and Zhang Zeyun looked at Qi Jingfeng sympathetically. After the meal was over, several people clamoured to ask Qi Jingfeng to pay for the bill, and then they sat together and chatted for a while before leaving the restaurant. Because Lu Chengyu had injuries on his arm, and they were worried that someone had targeted Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu recently, they let them go back early, and no other entertainment was arranged.Who knew that, that night news of Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu spread throughout the Internet, and by the next day, it spread even more vigorously, and even the news of the two was published on the paper media.The pixels of these photos were very poor, and in some photos, one couldn\u2019t even see the human face, but they had attracted a lot of attention from the public.\u201cThe President of Huading and the God of National Studies worship their parents together!\u201d\u201cWhy did the President of Huading kneel in front of the tomb of Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents?\u201d\u201cSurprise! Two well-known figures appeared hand in hand in front of a special restaurant!\u201d\u201cThe mystery of the love partner of the president of Huading has finally been revealed!\u201dThe headlines of these news were full of hot spots, and the secret photos of the two people on Weibo from various angles had been reposted by everyone.The internet went crazy because of such shocking entertainment news!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He took a look at the cell phone and it showed that he had 20 or 30 missed calls. He had good relations with some people in the company and some people in the entertainment industry. However, there were still only a few friends in his life.What happened to these people that made them make so many calls? He didn\u2019t even get to return the call yet, and the phone rang again. This time the caller displayed was Zhong Zhenghan, and Lu Chengyu had just pressed the answer button when Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s high-pitched voice came through.\u201cLu Chengyu! What are you and Yan Mu doing? I have never heard of it. If you don\u2019t want to die, you won\u2019t die!\u201dHolding the phone away from his ears, Lu Chengyu yawned and sat up from the bed, \u201cWhat happened to excite you like this?\u201d\u201cGive Lao Tzu a treat and see what is going on the internet. You are really popular now. Maybe you are popular even in foreign countries.\u201d Zhong Zhenghan heard that the other party was still half awake and half asleep, and almost laughed in anger, \u201cWhere did you go yesterday?\u201d\u201cNowhere, just went to pay homage to our parents, and then had a meal and then came home,\u201d Lu Chengyu heard that Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s voice was wrong, and his expression gradually became serious, \u201cSomeone put our photos on the Internet?\u201d\u201cNot only on the Internet, but even in the newspapers,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan flicked the forum, and it was about the scandals between Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu. He sighed, \u201cYou did feed a lot of entertainment reporters.\u201dLu Chengyu was startled slightly, and slowly calmed down. It was a foregone conclusion. The photos of him and Yan Mu had also been exposed. It was useless for him to be anxious. It was better to think about how to control the situation in a good direction. \u201cIt is a good thing for both of us to help many people support their families. \u201c\u201cYou are really big-hearted,\u201d Zhong Zhenghan heard that Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t seem to be very worried when speaking, so, he was gradually relieved, \u201cThis matter has become like this now. It can\u2019t be suppressed anymore. You two hurry up. Go and hire a reliable public relations team. Just because I have a good relationship with you, many reporters have started to contact Wang Song, wanting to interview me about the two of you, I am almost annoyed.\u201dLu Chengyu was fucked over by him. Zhong Zhenghan\u2019s complaining made him laugh, and then said, \u201cWhen you fall in love in the future, there will be more reporters coming to ask me, I will not be annoyed.\u201d\u201cBah!\u201d Zhong Zhenghan hung up the phone. He didn\u2019t want to talk to Lu Chengyu anymore, because he felt that he was a model of the emperor not worrying while the eunuch was.After Zhong Zhenghan hung up the phone, Lu Chengyu sighed, changed in a set of home clothes and went out. Just when Yan Mu opened the door and came out, he smiled at Yan Mu, \u201cI have some good and bad news to tell you. Our affairs were exposed by the media.\u201dYan Mu did not show any unexpected reaction. Obviously, he knew about it. Seeing that Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t have any disgusting expression on his face, he breathed a sigh of relief from the bottom of his heart, \u201cI have already called and notified the public relations team, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cWhat do I have to worry about,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled. Seeing Yan Mu\u2019s relaxed expression, his expression changed, \u201cOr are you worried?\u201dYan Mu shook his head, \u201cAfter taking the decision, I have not regretted it.\u201d He looked at Lu Chengyu, \u201cNo matter what others say about us, we can live a good life on our own. Those people are not qualified to point fingers.\u201d They are together in an upright manner and have no influence on others, let alone worry, it would be just idle panic.\u201cThere is never a lack of gesticulating people in this world,\u201d Lu Chengyu shrugged. \u201cThey think they are aloof, standing at the highest point of morality, and they forget about it when they turn around. They don\u2019t know that words are sometimes a weapon that hurts others.\u201dLu Chengyu had also heard other people gossip in his previous life, but after that, he had learned not to care what those who defamed him said, only to write down those kind words. Facts have proved that selective memory was very helpful for people\u2019s spiritual happiness.When Yan Mu heard this, he didn\u2019t know why, but he felt a little uncomfortable. Thinking of the indifference of Lu\u2019s relatives towards Lu Chengyu, his brows frowned, and he said, \u201cI won\u2019t let you face it alone.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled, and said, \u201cBrother Mu, has anyone ever told you that you are not good at sweet talk at all.\u201dYan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu\u2019s smile, as if he didn\u2019t understand why Lu Chengyu said these kind of words, because he had never said sweet words at all.\u201cWell, how do I talk about this issue with you,\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu\u2019s innocent little face, waved and said, \u201cWho cares what the people outside say, let\u2019s go downstairs to eat breakfast.\u201dThey were halfway down the stairs, when the housekeeper came up, \u201cSir, your cousins are visiting.\u201d\u201cCousins are here?\u201d Yan Mu frowned. He didn\u2019t know Mu Qihua would be coming in person. He and Lu Chengyu came to the large living room, Mu Qihua and Mu Qirong were sitting on the sofa drinking tea. Mu Qihua was flipping through a stack of newspapers with great interest, and when he saw them coming down, he raised the newspaper in his hand, \u201cYou two are up, come and see the news about you two.\u201dProbably, it was because Mu Qihua\u2019s expression was too calm, that it made Lu Chengyu feel a little uncomfortable. He walked up to Mu Qihua\u2019s side, picked up the newspapers and flipped through them, and he saw some articles.In these newspapers, some media seemed to imply that he was Yan Mu\u2019s little lover, but more newspapers published photos of Yan Mu kneeling in front of his parents\u2019 tombstones. The entire headline to the content were all saying two things. They were saying it was true love, and even faintly said that they both were rare talents. Although, they were the same gender, they were also a rare match together.\u201cBig cousin, second cousin,\u201d Yan Mu walked up to the two of them to say hello, then picked up some other newspapers from the table, and after a few glances, he put them down, and said to Mu Qihua, \u201cBig Cousin, the two forces behind this are fighting a battle of public opinion?\u201dMu Qihua nodded, \u201cBehind these entertainment reports, it is obvious that someone is biased towards Xiao Lu, and even has an advantage in Weibo and major forums. From the current situation, I believe that true love accounts for more than half of the rest. Then there are the ones who want to watch the excitement or feel that Xiao Lu has a golden master.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLu Chengyu put down the newspaper in his hand, asked the butler to help him bring the laptop, and quickly logged on to his Weibo, and he saw that comments and forwarding had reached a record high. This battle was even more exaggerated than when he was taken into the police station by the Liang family.He found a lot of people\u2019s Weibo about their being together. After blocking all of them, he turned to Mu Qihua and said, \u201cIt seems that this matter has become a big issue, and everyone on Weibo has gone crazy. \u201cMu Qihua smiled and stroked his chin, \u201cInteresting things spread really quickly.\u201d He raised his eyebrows, \u201cXiao Lu, do you think that the force behind you, seems to be telling you one thing about Xiao Yan in our family is that if he dares to make you sorry, they will clean up Xiao Yan?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at Mu Qihua in surprise, and then shook his head with a smile, \u201cThis must be your illusion, big cousin. If there is a powerful force behind me defending me, I should have entered your circle long ago and then became familiar with you.\u201d Not to mention that he was so sad in his previous life.\u201cIs it right? I\u2019ll see it soon,\u201d Mu Qihua smiled, and then said, \u201cYes, the public relations team has already arranged it, and I have asked them to start public opinion orientation on the internet. Do you have any comments? \u201cYan Mu knew that his eldest cousin was asking him if he was willing to announce his relationship or conceal it, saying that they were just good buddies. He glanced at Lu Chengyu next to him, \u201cLet\u2019s tell the truth, I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with this.\u201dLu Chengyu tilted his head and glanced at Yan Mu, then smiled and nodded, \u201cThere is nothing wrong with it.\u201dMu Qihua couldn\u2019t help but look at Lu Chengyu more and curled his mouth, \u201cOkay, in this case, I know what to do. I will arrange a small press conference for you in the afternoon. The reporters I invited are all from the industry. Honestly, you guys be ready to speak in the afternoon.\u201dLu Chengyu knew that this matter should not last too long. After all, he and Yan Mu were not artists who relied on romance to increase exposure, so, it was better to resolve this matter sooner. He was not afraid of exposing his feelings, but he did not want others to use his feelings as a means to talk about Yan Mu, \u201cBrother Hua sorry to trouble you.\u201dYan Mu nodded, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cOkay, you guys don\u2019t have to perform the husband sings and the wife follows \u2026\u201d As soon as he said this, Mu Qihua felt that something was wrong. After he stopped, he froze for a while and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, no matter what, as long as the two of you feel suitable.\u201dMu Qirong, who had been reading the newspaper next to him, looked up and glanced at Mu Qihua. Who was the husband and the wife of the two?\u201cOh,\u201d Mu Qihua noticed his younger brother\u2019s eyes and coughed dryly. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with you two men being together, but if you think it is appropriate, I\u2019m in no position to oppose it. I hope you two can do well for a lifetime and have the courage to face the media today.\u201dLu Chengyu gave Mu Qihua a surprised look. In his mind, Mu Qihua was more like a smiling fox, able to face him and Yan Mu. Having said this, it was too unexpected for him, \u201cI understand, Brother Hua.\u201dYan Mu looked at Lu Chengyu, then at Mu Qihua, \u201cCousin, if it wasn\u2019t for worrying that someone would talk about Xiao Lu, I won\u2019t care what the media reports.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re worried about them talking about Xiao Lu,\u201d Mu Qihua smiled, \u201cSo, you have to face the media honestly.\u201dHe stood up from the sofa, smiled and said, \u201cMy descendants of the Mu family should be like you.\u201d He was very fortunate that he had such a cousin, even though he was not named Mu, even though someone was instigating discord in front of him saying that Yan Mu would threaten his position in grandpa\u2019s mind.Those people would never understand that the most important thing in the Mu family was feelings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59Lu Chengyu\u2019s reaction was much calmer than the Mu brothers expected. As onlookers, they felt angry when they saw what some media said, but Lu Chengyu was able to scan the forum while chewing on melon seeds,[1]\u00a0as if the one being scolded was not him, but some unrelated person.\u201cClink!\u201d The melon seed shells were accurately thrown into the trash can next to him. Seeing Lu Chengyu\u2019s fingers flying around on the keyboard neatly, Mu Qihua couldn\u2019t help but be moved, and then he felt that he was thinking too much, so he sorted out his mood. Turning to Lu Chengyu, he said, \u201cXiao Lu, do you have any other opinions on this matter?\u201d\u201cWhat is your opinion?\u201d Lu Chengyu turned his attention to the conversation between the two of them. Although he did not know Mu Qihua particularly well, but he could see something similar to himself in this person, so he could understand the other\u2019s concerns, \u201cMy idea is to live my life and it doesn\u2019t make any sense to care about what others do.\u201d Mu Qihua heard the words, at first he was frozen, then smiled, and didn\u2019t say anything more after that.Regarding the press conference about the scandal between the president of Huading International and the internet celebrity Lu Chengyu, the reporter who received the invitation letter knew the truth of the matter, because the two held the press conference together, not separately, which showed a lot. But they, who knew Yan Mu\u2019s background well, were extra cautious. Before Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu spoke, they did not discredit the relationship between the two.After the reporters who were not qualified to enter the venue heard the news, they squatted outside the venue. Even if they couldn\u2019t get the first-hand information, it would be good if they were lucky enough to take a few photos or ask a few questions to the guards.Just as the reporters were looking forward to it, they saw a few black low-key cars driving over. Unfortunately, the appearance of these cars was exactly the same, and they couldn\u2019t tell which car was the boss sitting in.At the moment, they didn\u2019t care about who was in the car, they just jumped at the vehicle, but the voice of the reporter holding the microphone couldn\u2019t even penetrate the car.Getting out of the car first was not the one who had called the press conference, but a group of black-clad bodyguards. It was unknow what tactics they used, but before the reporters had time to react, they were already separated from each other. When they reacted, they only saw the backs of a group of people in black. As for the main persons, they were surrounded by the bodyguards and entered the venue.A reporter sighed unwillingly, and said to his colleagues, \u201cDid you capture anything just now?\u201d\u201cNothing was captured.\u201d The reporter asked was also a little depressed. He held the camera and looked at it. All the eyes at the gate of the venue could be said to be filled with resentment, \u201cI thought I could run a big news, who knew that Yan Mu would make such a big show.\u201d\u201cYan Mu can be called this in the capital,\u201d the reporter raised a thumbs up, and then he shrugged his shoulders, \u201cI heard the gossip that the Internet celebrity is actually not lowly, and the investor behind the \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d is him.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d The colleague obviously couldn\u2019t believe it. He glanced at the reporter suspiciously, \u201cDo you have any evidence for this?\u201d\u201cHey, what evidence is needed? Didn\u2019t you find that he is the investor of \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d, the reporter mysteriously said, \u201cI heard that Lu Chengyu valued the \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d script and took out all his savings to make the movie. Who knows how much he made from that movie? By this time, his worth is already nine figures.\u201d\u201cSince, it is nine figures, why is he still mingling with Yan Mu, a man.\u201d The colleagues were a little puzzled, \u201cEven if Yan Mu is rich, he is not short of money, he should be thinking, what kind of woman did he want?\u201d\u201cMaybe they are in true love,\u201d the reporter shrugged. \u201cA friend of mine works in Huading. I heard from my friend that Lu Chengyu is very charismatic, and his work ability is also very outstanding. Also, I don\u2019t know how many teenage employees of Huading are heartbroken after seeing the report, and there are many women who threatened to resign if Yan Mu is with Lu Chengyu.\u201d\u201cSuch an exaggeration?\u201d The colleague opened his mouth wide, as if he didn\u2019t expect Lu Chengyu to be so influential. He said after a while, \u201cI thought those female employees would hate Lu Chengyu a bit.\u201d It stood to reason that Yan Mu should be the diamond in the hearts of those female employees. Why was the actual situation so different?\u201cDon\u2019t try to guess what a woman thinks. You won\u2019t understand even if you tried.\u201d The reporter turned his head and found that many colleagues around him were eavesdropping on their conversation. His face changed suddenly, and he said, \u201cI\u2019ll go there and take a look.\u201dThese reporters thought he had news that he didn\u2019t want to disclose to them, so they each tried to find more information from others, so that they had something to write about.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t know how lively it was outside, but he knew that the reporters at the venue were very active. As soon as he sat down on the stage, he heard a shutter sound below, and the flash almost blinded him. Fortunately, he accompanied Zhong Zhenghan in his previous life. Zhong Zhenghan has participated in many such occasions, otherwise, it would be really difficult to adapt to this situation.In addition to Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu, there were also several people in the public relations team who were good at dealing with reporters. They were acquaintances with each other. Therefore, while asking questions, they would give face to each other. Of course, they would also reciprocate and let them have the question-asking opportunity.\u201cMr. Yan, Mr. Lu, are you really together?\u201d A reporter finally couldn\u2019t help asking; the first question itself was so straightforward.Yan Mu adjusted the height of the microphone, then glanced at a large number of microphones with various logos on the table, and nodded calmly, \u201cThank you very much for your concern, we are indeed together.\u201d The words came out of his mouth and suddenly, there was another crazy shutter sound. Lu Chengyu glanced at his side without blinking. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh. As expected, it was Brother Mu. In this situation also, he could be so calm.However, as soon as he finished thinking about it, the reporter over there began to ask him questions, \u201cMr. Lu, it is rumoured that you are behind the scenes investor of \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d. May I ask, if this investment fund was lent to you by Mr. Yan?\u201d\u201cThis reporter friend is very well informed, and he actually knows such a secret thing,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled at the reporter who asked the question. \u201cWhen, I invested in this movie, I and Mr. Yan were not partners. Even, if he dared to lend me this money, I won\u2019t dare to ask for it. Anyway, it\u2019s two or three million, such a large sum of money, who would dare to borrow it easily?\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s simple and ordinary mentality made some reporters laugh. The reporter who asked the question also laughed, \u201cThen this money is yours?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cIt\u2019s not my own,\u201d Lu Chengyu\u2019s smile faded, \u201cI just came out to work, how could I have so much money? This money was left to me by my parents.\u201d The reporters on the scene became silent for a while. Everyone on the scene knew that Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents died accidentally because of the Liang family, so the reporter who asked the question also apologized, \u201cSorry, Mr. Lu, I evoked a bad memory for you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled at the reporter, \u201cIt\u2019s not something that can\u2019t be mentioned.\u201dProbably because of this, several reporters after him did not ask too many questions. After the host interjected, the atmosphere of the whole press conference became very good.\u201cMr. Yan, someone photographed you and Mr. Lu going to pay homage to your parents yesterday. Both of you regard each other as a partner who can accompany you through life?\u201d\u201cIf it is not for this purpose, why should we go together? I also would not have appeared in this place today.\u201d Yan Mu\u2019s tone had always been calm and serious, but his attitude fell on reporters, which made people feel that he was very serious and principled about this matter. \u201cOriginally, I think this kind of thing doesn\u2019t need a press conference at all, but I didn\u2019t expect it would cause such a big sensation. I don\u2019t know how many people will see this interview, but there are some things I have to tell the friends who are concerned about this. That this is the relationship I\u2019ve worked very hard to pursue. Xiao Lu doesn\u2019t care about these slanders, but I do. If there are such remarks, I will ask the lawyers to use legal means to protect my lover. I hope everyone respects us, as, we respect others.\u201dAs soon as this was said, there was an uproar at the scene, because Yan Mu used the term \u201clover\u201d to describe Lu Chengyu. In many people\u2019s perceptions, \u201clover\u201d was equivalent to a husband or wife. Yan Mu used this term in front of so many people, did it mean that he had determined the spot for Lu Chengyu alone?Thinking of this, the reporters immediately asked questions as if they were injected with chicken blood, which caused chaos on the scene. After several adjustments and controls by the host, the whole scene gradually calmed down.\u201cAny love that doesn\u2019t presuppose being with each other for a lifetime is hooliganism,\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at the reporter below with a smile, \u201cFor us, we are no different from other lovers. So, I hope everyone will not pay too much attention, I hope everyone understands.\u201dHe got up and bowed in front of them, then stood up straight and said, \u201cI bow not to apologize to anyone, but to thank all the netizens who have cared about me before. I have seen your support for me. Starting from today, I have found someone to accompany me. You can finally not worry so much that I will be lonely if I live alone. Thank you.\u201d When it came to this, he again bowed.These words were all his heartfelt words, because only he knew that there were indeed many people who sincerely supported him and cared about him on the Internet. Even though they may have never met each other, he had felt their kind intentions.When the reporters saw this scene, they gradually calmed down. They were a little startled when they heard the words of the youth on the stage. After being in the entertainment industry for many years, they had become accustomed to all kinds of hyped love, and they had also been used to all kinds of inciting love scenes. But today these two men didn\u2019t say anything sensational, let alone exchanging rings or taking oaths, but they just made them feel that their relationship was sincere.\u201cClose it,\u201d Elder Mu sighed and slowly closed his eyes.\u201cOld sir,\u201d the caretaker looked at Elder Mu anxiously, then looked at Mr. Yan on the screen, and couldn\u2019t help frowning. How could a man as good as Mr. Yan like a man?She saw that Elder Mu was still holding the TV remote control, but the other party said that he wanted to turn off the TV, so she had to go forward and turn off the power, and then silently exit.Elder Mu opened his eyes and looked at the tree whose leaves had fallen out of the window. He sighed after a long time, \u201cDaughter, dad didn\u2019t help you look after your son!\u201dBecause Yan Mu had been too sensible since he was a child. It led him to forget that his grandson was also someone who needed the love of his elders.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60By the end of the press conference, the reporters who were present at the interview had already understood that Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu were in a serious relationship, and not to make a hype for themselves, which left them very uncomprehending. It was not that they didn\u2019t have people who liked the same sex around them; there were a lot of them going around, but they didn\u2019t find anyone to be with for a lifetime. In the end, they just went home and found a woman to marry and have a child. The moral was that they returned to the right way. In fact, this behaviour was not too popular.But no matter what, the reporters were a little surprised to say that they were together, but no matter how much they were surprised, the truth was that two good men had gotten together.After the press conference, a female reporter held the microphone and looked a little dazed watching Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu\u2019s cars leave the venue. Only after half a day did she return to the cameraman behind him and said, \u201cMy male god just said he likes a man. Am I abandoned?\u201dThe photographer calmly put away the photographic equipment, and then said, \u201cA good man has a boyfriend. And you are still alone, are you sorry?\u201dThe female reporter ignored him but stared blankly at the cars that had disappeared and almost couldn\u2019t be seen. She had been following Lu Chengyu\u2019s Weibo for a long time, and she went to his Weibo to see his latest posts almost every day. Sometimes, it was just a picture, and other times it was just a few sentences or a few feelings. She was different from others. Earlier, when Lu Chengyu was a student of Q University, she paid attention to Lu Chengyu\u2019s Weibo. Originally, it was only because he was her own younger brother, so she took care of it easily. Over time, she discovered that the other person was very serious about life, and she appreciated it.In her imagination, such a clean boy should find a sweet and lovely girlfriend, and then live happily. But why was there such a big gap between fact and imagination?She imagined a one-meter-tall girl, how could that sweet and lovely girl become an expressionless man who was 1.5 meters tall? Holding her chest, she exhaled silently, took out her phone and swiped it under Lu Chengyu\u2019s Weibo, which contained a piece of Weibo content that had just been released.More than every year: Thank you. (With picture)A simple two words plus a period, followed by a photo of two index fingers hooked together, it was a childish action, but it also made people feel happy.Her eyes were red, and then she laughed again, and left a message under this Weibo:Call me the Queen: Male god, I wish you happiness.\u201cIt\u2019s over, eldest sister, can\u2019t you get in the car?\u201d The photographer poked her back, \u201cThe station is still waiting for our news.\u201d\u201cWhat are you poking me for, be careful sister can beat you!\u201d The phone was put in the pocket of her jeans and she got into the car neatly.As, the car gradually moved forward, she looked out the window and smiled relievedly. She just pictured the happiest picture for the other party based on the imagination of an outsider, but life for each person was different. Only the person concerned knows whether he is happy or not. What she can do was just give them her blessing.In the car, Yan Mu saw Lu Chengyu hooking their index fingers to take a photo and then post it on Weibo. He took out his mobile phone and found the Weibo that Lu Chengyu had just sent, and then forwarded the content: Never changing!People who couldn\u2019t speak sweet words were especially attractive when they talked about love. When Lu Chengyu saw what Yan Mu forwarded, he laughed, \u201cThis is considered to be hanging on a hook, will it never change?\u201dYan Mu nodded seriously, \u201cNever change.\u201d After blinking, Lu Chengyu stretched out his fingers to hook Yan Mu\u2019s index finger and the warmth of his fingertips made the smile on the corners of his mouth more and more obvious. At this moment, Yan Mu held his hand tightly in the palm of his hand. Although neither of them spoke at this time, but, silence was better than sound, and no words could compare to this tranquil beauty.Once the content of the press conference was exposed, the internet faced a great uproar. Lu Chengyu\u2019s fans and black spots were on Weibo and various forums. If it were not for the network regulations, it was believed many people would have abused him on the spot.However, many people soon discovered that, except for Lu Chengyu\u2019s post on the day of the press conference with the finger-hooking photo showing affection, and after the president of Huading forwarded it, the two never publicly showed affection on Weibo or other public occasions, as if they didn\u2019t even know how big a sensation this incident caused, they just closed the door and lived by themselves.However, some reporters learned that Lu Chengyu was about to play a role in \u201cThe Universe\u201d, so with black intentions, they deliberately went to the internet to spread the news, so, that due to the effect of the incident, Lu Chengyu would lose this opportunity. However, his words were quickly pinched back by fans, to the effect that their little fish didn\u2019t say that he wanted to enter the show business circle at all. Even, if he lost this opportunity, he would not be as important as his own life.However, no matter how much trouble it was, everyone knew what a rare opportunity it was to enter \u201cThe Universe\u201d. It was a pity that Lu Chengyu had so many staunch fans. Some fans said that if Lu Chengyu was not in \u201cThe Universe\u201d, they would not go to the cinema.Because there was too much noise on the internet, some reporters went to interview related personnel of \u201cThe Universe\u201d. The news was that they had not heard that Lu Chengyu was expelled from the crew. This surprised many reporters. Even, if Yan Mu wanted to keep Lu Chengyu, but the Yan family and Mu family behind Yan Mu couldn\u2019t just watch Yan Mu with a man, right?It was a pity that no matter what these reporters thought, Lu Chengyu went to the crew to report smoothly. The director team and the producer did not show any dissatisfaction with Lu Chengyu. Some other actors who were on the side lines saw Lu Chengyu.The launch ceremony of the crew of \u201cThe Universe\u201d was very solemn. Lu Chengyu even saw some characters who could only be seen in the news network come out to give a speech, and shook hands with everyone.\u201cThis is Lu Chengyu, a highly talented student from the Q University, look at this very energetic young man.\u201d An old man with a crane hair and a childlike face walked up to Lu Chengyu vigorously, looked Lu Chengyu up and down in the military uniform of the major, nodded slightly, and stretched out his own hands.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWhen Lu Chengyu saw the old man followed by several guards, knowing that this person was not a low status, he smiled and slightly bowed his hands and held the opponent\u2019s hand, \u201cGood leadership.\u201d\u201cWe are all retired old men who came to join in the fun. I\u2019m not a leader. This young man wears this military uniform and plays well.\u201d The old man smiled and looked very kind, but Lu Chengyu saw it clearly. The other party couldn\u2019t be just a simple old man.After the other party said this, he turned around to talk to an official next to him. Although the official who was speaking with him seemed to be neither humble nor overbearing, Lu Chengyu found that the official treated the old man very politely and obviously did not want to make the other party dissatisfied.\u201cLao Mu, that young man\u2026\u201d The official didn\u2019t know much about entertainment stars, but seeing that Lao Mu paid particular attention to this person, he took a few more glances.\u201cA friend of my grandson.\u201d The old man said lightly, without mentioning anything else. But, everyone else present showed a clear expression, knowing in their hearts that this one needed special attention.The actors standing next to Lu Chengyu looked at him with envy and hatred. Although, they didn\u2019t know who the old man was and could not hear what the old man said to the officials, they looked at the officials\u2019 treatment of the old man. They could see that the other party\u2019s status was not low. Such a person with status only said a few words to Lu Chengyu. This was a treatment that even the chief director did not have.These people with big identities quickly left the crew. For them, every minute and every second should not be wasted. The fact that they could spend so much time on a movie was enough to prove that they valued the movie.After these people left, the talents of the whole crew were relieved. Director Qin took everyone to light the incense, and after worshipping the gods, he asked everyone to lift off the counter, and looked at the big names behind him. The artist of Yang said, \u201cI can see so many big names appearing in the movie I made today. I don\u2019t have to worry about not having enough content to write memoirs in the future.\u201dThe artists present all laughed in cooperation, although Director Qin\u2019s joke was not necessarily so funny.\u201cEveryone can join the crew, that is fate, nothing else, if the film is filmed seriously, we could be considered worthy of this country\u2019s training,\u201d he rubbed his stomach, \u201cI won\u2019t say anything else, we will join in at noon. After eating, let\u2019s start work.\u201dThe opening banquet was booked a long time ago, in an quaint restaurant next to the studio. Lu Chengyu took He Long to the restaurant with the crowd. From time to time, several actors came to talk to Lu Chengyu. After a few polite words, they walked together as companions, but they did not deliberately try to please him.After all, the people who could come to this crew were very well mixed in the circle. People who could make head way in this circle knew how to behave, so they would not blindly please anyone. That way, they would appear to be uncouth and will suffer despise.\u201cThis movie studio is really terrible in winter. Did Mr. Lu bring an assistant?\u201d An elderly actor saw that Lu Chengyu had only He Long by his side, knowing that he didn\u2019t have much experience, he said. \u201cWe have been shooting scenes of the city in the past two days, and we\u2019re going to film the battlefield scene next. I\u2019m afraid your assistant would not be able to take care of it alone.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Lu Chengyu showed a dazed expression before sighing. \u201cOk, you seniors know a lot, otherwise I would be caught blind, thank you for your reminder.\u201d The man who was talking to him was a well-known domestic artist who had not acted for several years. This time he came out for the filming of \u201cThe Universe\u201d. Lu Chengyu brought out an attitude of respect for these old artists unconsciously.He Long, who was beside him, got nervous. He felt that he should find an opportunity to contact Mr. Yan immediately, and then ask the other party to send a few more professional assistants over. In case something really happened to Mr. Lu, it would be troublesome.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can ask me if you don\u2019t understand,\u201d the old artist said with a smile, \u201cI am still a guest professor of Q University. It is not a big deal for the teacher to take care of the students.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 61Zhang Fang, a young actor next to him, listened to Lu Chengyu talking with the famous artist for a while, then turned to talk to several assistants behind him. Although, he took into account Lu Chengyu\u2019s identity, he didn\u2019t think much about Lu Chengyu\u2019s lack of acting skills, as he still squeezed into the crew by relying on the backstage.He became famous when he was young. Although, he was less than 30 years old, he was already a well-known celebrity. This time to appear in \u201cThe Universe\u201d was also a certainty. It was just that his favourite major role was assigned to Lu Chengyu, and he only got the not so good part of the other\u2019s clerk.In the restaurant, the seats were also exquisite. The main table had the director and producer and several international superstars from China. The second table had the domestic superstar with some identity and background. The other tables were also the same, although there was no bright button. Seniors were ranked, and the emcee of ceremonies quietly led these people to the table where they should sit, but everyone present was also interested in sitting where they shouldn\u2019t be.Lu Chengyu originally planned to find a seat at the third table, but he was arranged to be at the second table. Looking at the superstars who would cause fan congestion when the table was full, he was very witty and picked a lower position.Who knew that as soon as he sat down, there was a person sitting on the left. He tilted his head and glanced, and his eyebrows trembled slightly. This turned out to be Zhou Qingrong, the famous Zhou Da Tian Wang in the circle. As a junior, he politely nodded to Zhou Qingrong. Although, he had no hobby of chasing stars, he still watched several TV series played by Zhou Qingrong.\u201cXiao Lu is my subordinate in the play, right?\u201d Zhou Qingrong smiled at Lu Chengyu with a gentle face, and looked very approachable. He was over forty years old but looked only about thirty. \u201cThere is this such a handsome subordinate, this chief is under pressure.\u201d\u201cBrother Zhou, don\u2019t make fun of other people\u2019s children.\u201d A certain 50-year-old queen next to him heard this and said with a smile, \u201cAll those who like you are thirty. For women over ten years old, those who like Xiao Lu are young girls. When you two appear in one shot, you will win women from all over the country in one fell swoop. So, don\u2019t be pressured.\u201dWhen the shadow queen spoke, she immediately won the approval of others. All the people in this room were familiar with this circle. So, soon someone started Zhou Qingrong\u2019s joke, but it was all kind jokes, and there was a faint meaning of supporting Lu Chengyu.Everyone knew in their hearts that no matter how good they were, if they post a sentence about it, they might not even get to film, and they will disappear naturally, even their fans would not find something wrong.Lu Chengyu also knew the difficulties in the circle, so he always got along with these people with the posture of a younger generation, and occasionally made small jokes with them, but from the beginning to the end, he did not show the meaning of being too close to these people.The main reason for him to participate in \u201cThe Universe\u201d was to check things that he didn\u2019t know in his previous life and to be familiar with the behaviour styles of some actors, so as to determine which actors could and could not be used when he invested in movies in the future.Other artists here also knew that Lu Chengyu\u2019s identity was different from them. They favoured Lu Chengyu because of the Mu family\u2019s influence and because Lu Chengyu himself was a rich and well-connected master, and it was inevitable that there might be some opportunities for cooperation in the future.Zhang Fang was a bit displeased with Lu Chengyu, but seeing that Zhou Qingrong was so polite to Lu Chengyu, his discomfort was mostly gone, and he was even more jealous of Lu Chengyu.There was nothing interesting at the banquet, but Lu Chengyu was familiar with the big names in the circle. The first show in the afternoon was a cocktail party that required many actors to appear. Lu Chengyu was a major from a wealthy family in the play, so in this scene, he needed to wear suits and boots popular in the last century.The shots of such a cocktail party were shot by several sets of cameras at the same time. In the middle were a bunch of people from the noble circle with exquisite clothes, and all around were crew members wearing coats or vests.With so many big names coming together, it was like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea and show their magical powers. Among them, whoever was not good at acting and who was not acting properly could be easily distinguished.Director Qin originally thought that Lu Chengyu would be very uncomfortable with this shooting method, but to his surprise, Lu Chengyu did nothing wrong from start to finish. He performed a rich major with a noble background and excellent grades, although it was not a rare thing to see, but he couldn\u2019t find any faults in it.After filming the important cocktail scene, the stone in Director Qin\u2019s heart fell to the ground. No matter, how many actors in the crew come in through the back door, now that he could produce the results he wanted, the rest was not important.\u201cThe Universe\u201d represented extraordinary significance, so the costumes and props of the actors were very elegant, and the requirements for the actors\u2019 acting skills were also very high. The big names who usually called the wind and rain outside had been scolded countless times in this scene, and Lu Chengyu was also yelled at by Director Qin. Although, the usual Director Qin was very amiable, but when it came to filming, he was simply the living yama, and he had thus been cursed by countless people.As long as directors were capable, no matter how smooth or straightforward they were in their daily lives, they had their own attitudes when shooting, such as Director Qin and Zhang Shuo.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t think that the other party was deliberately embarrassing him. During this period of filming, he learned a lot, so that the deputy director told him that he had only the last scene left in the battle.The requirements for blasting in the drama \u201cThe Universe\u201d were very high, aiming to achieve the most realistic effect, and professional instructors taught the actors how to safely pass the blasting point.The military uniform on the major\u2019s body was full of dust, blood marks and burnt black spots. He was surrounded by his comrades who died in battle. His eyes swept across the young faces. He staggered, watching his comrades not far away. The armoured car that drove over corpses, holding on to the national flag that was stained with blood, he slowly raised his head slowly, looking at the blue sky and the brilliant sun above his head, holding the flag pole tightly. The body, which was originally weak due to excessive blood loss, also stood up straight.\u201cThe country will not die!\u201d\u201cThe country will not die!\u201dHis pupils gradually dilated, and he seemed to hear the sound of children singing the national anthem, and the hand holding the flagpole suddenly loosened, and he fell down heavily, except that the flag dyed red by the blood marks still fluttered in the breeze.Because this scene was a very important part of the shot, he was surrounded by the crew. When Lu Chengyu fell straight down, the staff felt heavy. Although there was no post-production or musical rendering in the live performance, Lu Chengyu accurately grasped the characteristics of the characters.The major was born rich and did not understand the suffering of ordinary people. He was proud but qualified to be proud. However, when the national disaster approached, he did not go abroad for asylum like other people, but fulfilled his duty as a soldier and was obliged to sacrifice his life for the country.\u201cPass!\u201d Director Qin was silent for a moment, raising his hand to signal that the scene was over, and then the two assistants hurriedly stepped forward and helped Lu Chengyu up, and He Long also took a coat and put on Lu Chengyu.In this kind of weather, wearing thin military uniform was simply a crime. He Long and the two other assistants arranged by Yan Mu put on clothes for Lu Chengyu and gave him warm water.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cThank you,\u201d Lu Chengyu was holding a warm cup of water, and after taking a big sip he made his voice sound less trembling, \u201cHave you booked our flight back tonight?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already booked,\u201d He Long knew Lu Chengyu was worrying about the company\u2019s affairs, so he said, \u201cMr. Yan has already said that he will pick you up at the airport tonight.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded, because he had been out of the capital for nearly a month since filming the movie \u201cThe Universe\u201d. Under the premise that Director Qin intended to film his scenes in advance, if not, he still didn\u2019t know when he could go back.Because of the confidentiality agreement, he had hardly posted on Weibo in the past month, and usually called Yan Mu when he was bored. So, when He Long mentioned Yan Mu, he realized that the main reason for his eagerness to return to the capital was that he was missing Yan Mu. Instead of worrying about the two movies that he invested in, or something else.\u201cXiao Lu did a good job in making this movie.\u201d Director Qin walked forward with a smile and patted Lu Chengyu on the shoulder, and personally delivered the red envelope to Lu Chengyu. \u201cI heard that you are going back tonight. I am here. I can\u2019t walk away; I can\u2019t see you off personally. I\u2019ll let my assistant drive you to the airport.\u201dLu Chengyu took the red envelope. This was the rule of the crew. If you played a dead person or perform a dead scene, the crew would give you a red envelope to drive away the bad luck. After listening to Director Qin\u2019s words, he thanked him and declined. Seeing that Director Qin was very persistent, he agreed, \u201cThen I will trouble Director Qin and your assistant. When you return to the capital, we might have a chance to have a drink together. \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d Director Qin immediately smiled happily. He stretched out his hand and patted Lu Chengyu on the shoulder, then sighed again, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that such a good seedling doesn\u2019t get in this circle.\u201d These days, although he had scolded Lu Chengyu, his evaluation of Lu Chengyu in his heart was very good.It was a pity that he was not an actor despite the fact that he could grasp the emotions better than many professional actors.After speaking with Director Qin, Lu Chengyu went to the dressing room to remove the makeup, wash away the stains on his face, and put away the military uniform. Lu Chengyu looked at himself in the mirror and said to the makeup artist after a long while, \u201cSuddenly not wearing military uniforms will have some effect. Fortunately, I have made up my mind not to enter this circle. Otherwise, I would be in trouble if I can\u2019t get out of the characters in the play.\u201dThe makeup artist smiled and said, \u201cIf Mr. Lu enters the showbiz, he would definitely be a popular superstar.\u201d\u201cForget it, I\u2019m not suitable for this bowl of rice,\u201d Lu Chengyu stood up and pulled his hair cut into a flat size. \u201cI have no regrets to be able to play this movie.\u201dLiu Qiyan came in from the outside . Hearing the conversation between the two men, she sat down in front of the other makeup mirror and said with a smile, \u201cMr. Lu will also shine in other circles. It\u2019s a pity to stay in the entertainment industry.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and glanced at Liu Qiyan. \u201cSister Yan\u2019s evaluation for me is too high.\u201d Although he suspected that Liu Qiyan helped him secretly in the last car accident, Liu Qiyan had never been close to him since the filming of \u201cThe Universe\u201d, as if he was just a stranger. He did not expect that Liu Qiyan would take the initiative to speak with him again today when he left.Liu Qiyan smiled, picked up the eyebrow pencil to fill up her eyebrows, and then said, \u201cI heard that Mr. Lu is going back tonight.\u201d She put down the eyebrow pencil, smiled and looked at Lu Chengyu, \u201cI wish you a good journey.\u201dLu Chengyu raised his eyebrows and said with a smile, \u201cThank you.\u201d After he got out of the dressing room, his brows were slightly frowning. How could a smart woman like Liu Qiyan wish others a smooth journey before they took a plane? For people who often fly by plane, there were a small number of people who were afraid of others saying things like going well. It was impossible for Liu Qiyan not to know this.After saying goodbye to other familiar people, he got in the car driven by the director\u2019s assistant and rushed to the airport. He Long booked him a plane at 7:30 in the evening, and it was already 5 in the afternoon. He was worried that there would be a traffic jam on the road and he would not be able to get to the airport in time.\u201cLu Chengyu is gone?\u201d Zhang Fang listened to the conversations of the staff around him, and said to his agent, \u201cIt is different if there is a background, and even the director takes care of him.\u201dThe agent looked around and made sure that no one heard Zhang Fang. After that he said, \u201cDon\u2019t say a few words, even Zhou Tianwang is polite to that guy, he is not going to be in the entertainment industry, he will not be your competitor.\u201dZhang Fang fell silent, sometimes people like that were strange, knowing that the other party would not threaten them, but they just felt that the other party\u2019s existence affected them. He knew in his heart that this was so-called jealousy, but he didn\u2019t even know why he would be jealous of someone who had nothing to do with him.He looked up to see the helplessness on the agent\u2019s face, opened his mouth, and finally said, \u201cI know.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, it was not the peak tourist season, so the group of them hurriedly changed their tickets for the next flight, and finally got on the plane back to Beijing smoothly.Before the plane took off, after everyone turned off their mobile phones and other electronic devices, He Long hesitantly looked towards Lu Chengyu and asked, \u201cMr. Lu, did you call Mr. Yan and tell him that we have delayed another flight?\u201dLu Chengyu \u201c\u2026\u201d Just, now he was thinking about hurriedly boarding the plane back to the capital to meet Yan Mu. He even forgot about it. He glanced at the other two assistants and saw that they both shook their heads, so he coughed, knowing that Yan Mu would be anxious if he hadn\u2019t received any information.He rubbed his forehead. Recently, because the crew was striving for perfection in the filming, he had turned black and white all day long, was suffering from severe sleep deprivation, and tended to forget things. Now, that he had made such a mistake, his mind had become muddy.After the plane took off smoothly, the flight attendant began to give everyone drinks, and one of the flight attendants asked Lu Chengyu for an autograph. When everyone had the meal on the plane, Lu Chengyu found that the faces of the flight attendants in the cabin were not quite right, as if something had happened.Because Lu Chengyu was in business class, several other passengers also found that something was wrong, and immediately asked the flight attendants what happened. The flight attendants couldn\u2019t resist the pressure before they said what happened.It turned out that the wing of the flight to Beijing 40 minutes ago had a problem halfway through. During the emergency landing, there was an explosion, and no one survived.After He Long and the other two assistants listened, their expressions suddenly changed. Wasn\u2019t the 40-minute flight the same one they missed? If it weren\u2019t because the car broke down halfway, then they\u2026Lu Chengyu\u2019s face was not pretty, but given that the faces of the other passengers in the cabin were not pretty, his expression didn\u2019t look abrupt, but only he knew that he was in a good mood. How bad!If this incident was only an accident, he was saddened by the loss of so many lives. If it was man-made, he was extremely disgusted with the master behind the scenes. In the eyes of the other party, were so many lives just worth being the victim of a scheme?!\u2026.At the Beijing Airport, many people waited for their relatives or friends to arrive in the terminal. When the news of the flight accident came out, almost everyone didn\u2019t believe it, and they even suspected that they had heard it wrong.\u201cMr. Yan, this flight is not\u2026\u201d Xiao He was almost stunned. Wasn\u2019t this flight the one that his brother and Mr. Lu took? He stared at the crying crowd in a daze, his mind buzzed, and suddenly he couldn\u2019t think of anything.\u201cPresident Yan, I heard that Mr. Lu is also on this flight. Is this true?\u201d\u201cPresident Yan, are you here to pick up the plane?\u201d\u201cPresident Yan\u2026\u201d When Xiao He recovered, he saw a bunch of reporters carrying microphones and cameras around him and Mr. Yan, Mr. Yan\u2019s face was unprecedentedly ugly. He even felt that if he only needed someone to light a fire, and Mr. Yan would explode.\u201cMr. Yan, I heard that the plane on which Mr. Lu was travelling was crashed, you\u2026\u201d\u201cGo!\u201d Yan Mu kicked the questioning reporter to the ground, grabbed his shirt and said, \u201cShut your mouth, otherwise, I will leave you speechless for life.\u201d\u201cBeating!\u201d\u201cThe rich are bullying others!\u201d When Yan Mu started beating people, some reporters began to fear that the world would not be chaotic, but more reporters watched. When Yan Mu\u2019s eyes turned red, they felt heavy when they thought that Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu were still lovers in love, as well as other crying family members of the passengers.The reporter was beaten by Yan Mu. Although, he did not dare to fight back, after hiding in the crowd, he posted a Weibo that Yan Mu threatened the reporter with his identity. Within a few minutes, it was forwarded and discussed by countless people.But soon other reporters at the scene posted another Weibo. Yan Mu looked in a trance in the photo, his eyes were red, and his emotions were on the verge of collapse.\u201cAlthough I am a reporter, I am ashamed of the behaviour of some of my colleagues. When others are sad, they triumphantly spread salt on the wounds of the other person. In order to report annihilating humanity, and to reverse right and wrong for the sake of gimmicks. Having money is not a crime. It\u2019s not a reason so that people can wantonly be hurt but can\u2019t fight back. Flight XXXXX, pray for you.\u201dThis Weibo immediately caused an uproar/wave again, because soon netizens learned that Lu Chengyu seemed to have taken this flight. The video of Yan Mu\u2019s beating was also posted on the Internet, and public opinion immediately turned against the reporter.Of course, there were also some people who hated the rich who released various verbal attacks on Yan Mu, but in the eyes of these people, as long as they had money, they were evil vampires. The misfortune in their lives were caused by these people, so many netizens had scolded them. After that, no one bothered to talk to these people again, and started to care about the flight.When Zhang Zeyun arrived at the airport, he saw Yan Mu standing straight in the terminal, looking at the passenger exit, as if Lu Chengyu could walk out of it as long as he watched that way.\u201cBrother Mu\u2026\u201d Seeing him like this, Zhang Zeyun didn\u2019t know what to say for a while. He looked around and saw that everyone around was panicked. He even cried and opened his mouth but couldn\u2019t speak.Yan Mu looked back at him, with a strangely calm tone, \u201cAh\u2026\u201d Zhang Zeyun responded hoarsely, remembering that they were playing together in the afternoon and were going to have dinner in the evening together. Who knew Brother Mu? Because Lu Chengyu was coming back, he didn\u2019t even eat dinner, and he came to the airport early to wait.At that time, Zhuang Yu also asked what time the plane was. He remembered clearly that it was the plane involved in the accident, but at this time, he began to hope that he had heard it wrong or remembered it wrong.\u201cWhen he called me today, he said he wanted to eat the sweet and sour fish I made,\u201d Yan Mu frowned. \u201cIf he comes back late, I am worried that the fish will not be fresh.\u201dHearing these words, Zhang Zeyun felt a little flustered, and always felt that there was something wrong with Brother Mu\u2019s current state. In fact, he would rather Mu Ge lose his temper, or feel sad, and didn\u2019t want to see such a scene. He always felt that this was the weird tranquillity before the storm.\u201cI also changed the carpet at home. He said that it is more comfortable to sit on the carpet and play games in winter.\u201d Yan Mu frowned, \u201cActually I don\u2019t like furry carpets.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cImpossible, impossible,\u201d A woman who was crying almost fainted. She was clutching the sleeve of the airport staff next to her, her face was covered with tears, her makeup was messed up, and her hair was messed up, but at this time she couldn\u2019t take care of it anymore.Yan Mu looked at the crying woman, suddenly his heart felt hollowed out, only panic and bitterness was left, making him almost out of breath. If he hadn\u2019t arranged Xiao Lu to join the crew, then Xiao Lu would definitely read a book or surf the Internet with him at home, or else he would be tossing about the flowers and plants in the garden.Why did he get dizzy at the time, so what scene did Xiao Lu do?He covered his chest suddenly, his nose and throat were so sore that he staggered on his feet, and he couldn\u2019t hear anything besides crying in his ears. The woman\u2019s sharp desperate cry was like a knife constantly cutting his heart, twitching and painful.A staff member came to arrange a place to rest for relatives and friends, Yan Mu did not move, and someone came to deliver drinks and food, etc. Yan Mu still did not move.\u201cBrother Mu! Brother Mu!\u201dThe people around him seemed to call him, but Yan Mu couldn\u2019t hear a word. He kept seeing the words in his mind, Xiao Lu was still on the plane, on the plane.He was on the plane, can\u2019t come back?Back\u2026 not coming anymore?He even called himself today, saying that he was homesick, and he wanted to eat the food he made. Why couldn\u2019t he come back in the blink of an eye?Staring at Zhang Zeyun next to him, Yan Mu saw Zhang Zeyun\u2019s face full of anxiety and worry, he slowly let go of the hand covering his chest, letting his heart beat and hurt, \u201cGo back, I\u2019ll wait for him to come back.\u201dZhang Zeyun wants to say that he can\u2019t come back! Can\u2019t come back! But looking at Yan Mu\u2019s appearance, he opened his mouth and said something else, \u201cI\u2019ll wait with you.\u201dNo matter what the result was, he was not relieved that Yan Mu was here alone. Maybe\u2026 Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t get on the plane for something or decided to come back tomorrow? Thinking of this, his heart jumped in his chest and couldn\u2019t help but get up to check the list of flights. Maybe\u2026 Was Lu Chengyu really not on the plane?Because something went wrong on this flight, the airline staff carefully reviewed the crew list several times before releasing the list. When Zhang Zeyun arrived, the list had just come out.After reading the first time, Zhang Zeyun did not find Lu Chengyu\u2019s name, and was ecstatic, but he was afraid that he had read it wrong. After reading it several times, he found that there were indeed no names of Lu Chengyu and others. He was overjoyed and turned to where Yan Mu was and in his direction hurriedly.When Lu Chengyu got off the plane, he hurried to the exit. Although, he acted in a strict manner, he must know to check the passenger list, but because of this flight, he must be very worried about him. Thinking of this, Lu Chengyu almost trotted out. He Long and the others also trotted after seeing this.As soon as Lu Chengyu appeared at the exit, countless shutter sounds and flashing lights were all around him. The cameras flashed before his eyes and blinked several times before his vision returned to normal, and then he saw Yan Mu in the crowd at a glance.\u201cLu Chengyu!\u201d\u201cLu Chengyu was not on that flight!\u201d There were many screams around, which immediately attracted more reporters and the media.Yan Mu stared at Lu Chengyu, who was surrounded by the reporters, his heart seemed to be held tightly by something, and then quickly loosened. Suddenly, he could not hear or see anything, only the person in front of him could be seen.The four eyes were staring into each other, and it was as if they would continue to do so for tens of thousands of years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the plane before, he wanted to borrow the satellite phone on the plane to send Yan Mu news, but because of an accident on the previous flight, many people were waiting in line for the call. Before it was his turn, the plane was about to land. Now, that he saw Yan Mu like this, he should have definitely tried his best to give Yan Mu a call, and he not make Yan Mu anxious.\u201cMu\u2026\u201d He opened his mouth, and before he had time to call out the other party\u2019s name, he saw Yan Mu rushing over and holding him tightly in his arms. The expression on his face became stiff, because his arm was hooped by the opponent, he couldn\u2019t reach out and pat the opponent\u2019s back for comfort, so he had to put his head on Yan Mu\u2019s shoulder and let the surroundings crowded with people take pictures videos. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201dWhen Zhang Zeyun ran over, he happened to see this scene. He stopped, leaning on his knees, panting, laughing and coughing, and simply sat on the ground, regardless of the surrounding area. Because he had only now discovered that his feet were already too soft to stand up.\u201cThe Universe\u201d crew, Liu Qiyan heard that Lu Chengyu\u2019s flight had an accident. He was so shocked that he dropped the powder cake box in his hand on the ground, and asked the assistant beside him in disbelief, \u201cHow could this happen?\u201d Even, if the person behind the scenes wanted to plot against Lu Chengyu, he didn\u2019t have the ability and the courage to do such a big thing. This was not in line with the behaviour of that person.\u201cNow the news on the Internet is going crazy,\u201d the assistant handed the phone screen to Liu Qiyan. On it was a picture of Yan Mu. In the photo, Yan Mu looked in a trance, his eyes were reddish, and his mood was very depressed. \u201cSomeone took the photo at the airport. I heard that Yan Mu came to pick up Mr. Lu.\u201dAfter nearly a month of getting along, many people in the crew had a good impression of Lu Chengyu. Although, this person had a background and wealth, he did nothing over-the-top. He was very humble and had never done anything offensive based on his status. Many people in the crew were sorry for such a thing.\u201cHow is it possible,\u201d Liu Qiyan frowned and took the phone, looking at the pictures of Yan Mu on the phone, the older he looked, the uglier, \u201cHow could it be?\u201dThe assistant noticed that her expression was not right, and he was stunned, thinking that Liu Qiyan meant that to Lu Chengyu, so she didn\u2019t dare to speak more for a while, and had to find an excuse to go out.There was only Liu Qiyan left in the room. She went to the window and looked around, dialled a number, and said a few words, before she was startled and said, \u201cReally it was just an accident?\u201d At this moment, she saw one of his assistants hurriedly run over and hurriedly said, \u201cI know, goodbye.\u201d\u201cSister Yan, Mr. Lu was not on the plane!\u201d The assistant ran in with joy, \u201cThe director\u2019s assistant said because their car broke down halfway. They didn\u2019t catch the flight, so they changed their bookings.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Liu Qiyan had already got the latest news on the phone, so the assistant\u2019s words didn\u2019t make her look bad, \u201cYou send a Weibo for the flight, and don\u2019t say anything else.\u201dIn this world, sometimes the more you said, the more mistakes you made. She was experienced in this circle. She didn\u2019t bother to deal with these things, so under normal circumstances, no one freely expressed opinions on current events.\u201cOkay, Sister Yan\u201d, the assistant saw that there was something wrong with Liu Qiyan\u2019s face, the assistant didn\u2019t dare to say anything else, and started to edit the Weibo with his mobile phone.Liu Qiyan looked at her mobile phone, thinking about the news she had just received, and couldn\u2019t help sighing. Fortunately, there was no accident with Lu Chengyu.In the airport, because of Lu Chengyu\u2019s appearance, many reporters had become onlookers. Photos of Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu hugging at the airport were also circulated on Weibo and other major forums.On the entertainment section of the Haijiao Forum, a post called \u201cA hug makes me understand love\u201d appeared in the eyes of the public. The main building of this post was the photo of Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu hugging. The host wrote in the post: I used to be a passer-by fan of Lu Chengyu because he was bullied by the prince Liang and loved him, but I did not like him anymore because he was with a man, but today I saw the photo of Yan Mu hugging him. I understand what love is.As soon as this post appeared, many people replied to it, and some netizens even posted photos they accidentally took. The two in the photos were rare handsome men, but one always had no facial expression and the other always had a smile on his face.Although the pixels of some photos were not high and the displayed images were a bit distorted, anyone could see that the two people were very natural and harmonious when they were together.398L: Seeing so many photos, I began to believe in love again. However, I don\u2019t know if you have noticed that Xiao Lu and President Yan rarely show affection on Weibo. Except for the Weibo they posted when they wnt public together, there are no other crooked photos behind. What kind of style Xiao Lu used to be, and what style is it still? I feel that the two want to live a low-key life, and don\u2019t like to use emotional things to get attention.405L: Several people upstairs make a lot of sense. I also feel this way. Now, there are not too many high-profile couples who do not show affection. There are really few people who live in a low-key way like Xiao Lu. It\u2019s just because of our fish. If we want to see more love pictures, we can only find secret photos from other netizens.410L: Because of Xiao Lu\u2019s appearance, we only fan him. Also, the photo in the main building is so inexplicably heart-warming. Is this the power of love? Or is this my illusion?411L: Upstairs, this is not your illusion. I feel the same with you. Have you seen Mr. Yan\u2019s posture? This is the state of panic and joy after the loss of hope. He held Xiaoyu in both hands and blocked many media with his back. This is a kind of subconscious protection psychology. I swear by the final grades of the professional class. It is absolutely true love.430L: Building 411 is a psychology student? It seems that you have learned your professional courses seriously, but you have not learned enough. Have you only seen Mr. Yan\u2019s posture, but have not seen the movements of our family\u2019s Xiao Lu? With his chin resting on Mr. Yan\u2019s shoulder and his face still close to Mr. Yan\u2019s ears, he must be comforting and worrying about Mr. Yan. Therefore, all friends in this building can \u00a0be rest assured that these two must be true love, not just for fun.The appearance of two people related to psychology had aroused the interest of many netizens. Some people began to post photos of Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu getting along for analysis. There was a way to prove how true Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu\u2019s love is.The 411L and 430L also cooperated very well. They began to analyse the photos carefully. In the end, they were surprised by themselves, because they found that in these photos, most of Yan Mu\u2019s attention was on Lu Chengyu. Although people\u2019s eyes and movements could be faked, but many small details might still betray their true thoughts. However, in these photos, Yan Mu could be said to have a genuine expression.In the end, this post returned to several thousand floors came to an authoritative conclusion, that is, Mr. Yan loved Lu Chengyu to his bones. If this was not love, then they did not dare to believe in love.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t know how lively it was on the Internet. He and Yan Mu were surrounded by the media, almost struggling. He looked at these reporters with a solemn expression, and finally had no choice but to say, \u201cI would like to ask my friends from the press to give in. This sad thing happened today, and I hope to pay more attention to the development of the flight.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cMr. Lu, it is rumoured that you were on the flight, did you really book this ticket?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed into the camera. \u201cMy scenes got over in the afternoon. A friend of the crew drove me to the airport. Who knew the broke down halfway, and when we arrived at the airport, the plane had already taken off, so we had to change the booking for the next one.\u201dThe reporters were in an uproar. It was unexpected that Lu Chengyu was so lucky to escape the disaster. If the crew sent him to the airport, it would be impossible to drive an unrepaired car, but in this case, the car actually broke down, but God blessed him.\u201cPlease give in,\u201d Yan Mu said at this time. He glanced at the reporters faintly, \u201cXiao Lu is tired today and needs rest.\u201dAlthough the reporters had the intention to ask more questions, but looking at Yan Mu\u2019s scary expression, they decided otherwise. Seriously, the few bodyguards behind them also started to open their way, knowing that they might offend Yan Mu like the reporter before, so they had to seize the opportunity to take a few more photos and let them leave.After Xiao He saw that his brother was fine, he was so happy that he couldn\u2019t stop smiling. Lu Chengyu let the two brothers and two assistants sit in one car. He, Yan Mu, and Zhang Zeyun got in another car.Zhang Zeyun drove the car and looked at Lu Chengyu in the rear view mirror for several times before exhaling, \u201cXiao Lu, this time you had scared Brother Mu out of his life.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at him guiltily and held Yan Mu with his own hands, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brother Mu, I should have given you a call.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d Yan Mu looked slightly moved. For him now, Lu Chengyu\u2019s okay was the luckiest thing in the world. He didn\u2019t even dare to think if the car sending Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t break down halfway\u2026Thinking of this, he hugged Lu Chengyu tightly again. Only by holding the person in his arms could he feel at ease.\u201cI won\u2019t go filming in the future,\u201d Lu Chengyu wrapped his hand around his waist, \u201cI won\u2019t leave you again.\u201d In the rear view mirror, the two embracing people almost forgot the existence of Zhang Zeyun, the driver, but Zhang Zeyun tried his best to drive the car more steadily without disturbing the warmth between the two.In the Mu\u2019s household, Mr. Mu was watching the news about flights on TV, and he was accompanied by a few juniors. When the picture of Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu embracing appeared on the TV screen, the expressions of several juniors were different. Mu Qihua and Mu Qirong, who had a good relationship with Lu Chengyu, looked at their grandpa worriedly and found that his expression was normal. They couldn\u2019t figure out what the old man was thinking.After the piece of news was finished, Mr. Mu looked at his juniors and said, \u201cAll of you go back, Qirong and Qihua stay.\u201d After the juniors exchanged a look through their eyes, they all left obediently. Before leaving, they also looked at the two brothers a few more times. Anyway, the grandfather liked these two grandchildren the most, and they were used to it. But this time because of the stern thing, they were afraid that the old man would be angry at the two.\u201cGrandpa\u2026\u201d Mu Qihua was interrupted by Mr. Mu.\u201cSomeone is targeting Lu Chengyu, do you know?\u201d Father Mu held a teacup, and after throwing out this sentence, he added, \u201cEven if there is no accident on this flight, as long as Lu Chengyu gets on the plane, your cousin would only receive a person who was dead.\u201d The two brothers of the Mu family changed their expressions. Mu Qirong looked ugly and said, \u201cSomeone deliberately manipulated the equipment on the plane?\u201d\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d Mr. Mu glanced at his grandson disgustingly, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s so easy to do something with the equipment on a plane?\u201dMu Qihua glanced at his younger brother, and then looked at Mr. Mu kindly, \u201cGrandpa, did you get any news? Tell us a little bit.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you two have a good relationship with that young man?\u201d Grandfather Mu put down his teacup, his eyes gradually became cold, \u201cNo matter what is between your cousin and him, but he is always your brother. The two benefactors, there are some things that our Mu family can\u2019t care about. Some people are bold and stretch their hands too long. What our Mu family has to do is to chop off this lawless hand. As for other things, wait for it. I\u2019ll talk later.\u201d The two brothers looked at each other, and were even more uncertain about the old man\u2019s thoughts. Was this agreeing with their cousin and Xiao Lu, or disagreeing?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He admired Lu Chengyu\u2019s talents, and also hated how his younger brother got entangled with a man.Among the second generations of wealthy families he knew, there were also a few playful children who were raising men, but nobody took it seriously, but his cousin who always behaved in an appropriate manner, he just didn\u2019t make a move, and shocked the country as soon as he made a move. He came out in front of the people of the whole country. He was still beating people for Lu Chengyu at the airport and said something like that.He hadn\u2019t ever really liked anyone, he didn\u2019t understand Yan Mu\u2019s mood when he was at the airport, but the matter was over, he respected Yan Mu\u2019s choice and treated Lu Chengyu as his own family. Although, the people of the Mu family seemed to be reasonable in everything they do, in fact they all had shortcomings in their bones.He knew that there was a story behind Lu Chengyu, but,he did not expect that the people behind him were getting bolder, and even dared to calculate against their Mu family. Thinking of this, he smiled with a little coldness on his face, and said to Mu Qirong who was next to him: \u201cQirong, do you think the person behind this thinks that the people of our Mu family are also eager for Lu Chengyu to have an accident? \u201cThe matter between Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu would have upset many, if it was placed in ordinary families. The people behind the accident may also feel that the Mu family also didn\u2019t want to see Lu Chengyu. Even, if they dealt with Lu Chengyu, the Mu family would only watch with cold eyes. It was a pity that these people thought in the wrong direction. Although, Mu Qihua was uncertain, he still had Lu Chengyu in his eyes. Now, someone attacked Lu Chengyu on the plane. If he didn\u2019t do anything, he would be acting out of character.\u201cOn that flight, there were more than a dozen people with suspicious identities.\u201d Mu Qirong took out his mobile phone and checked the messages that others had sent him. \u201cWhat I am more puzzled about is that those who conspired with Lu Chengyu, didn\u2019t they find that Lu Chengyu hadn\u2019t boarded the plane? \u201c\u201cThis can be regarded as little Lu\u2019s fate, countless coincidences saved his life,\u201d Mu Qihua sat in the car, looking at the changing scenery outside the car window, \u201cI heard that Lu Chengyu\u2019s car to the airport was originally arranged. But, not long before leaving, because of the kindness of Director Qin, he took the assistant\u2019s car and left. Later, the car had a problem halfway, and they transferred to a taxi. Who knew that the taxi also broke down halfway? You also know how much traffic there is, unless, it is an official search for a car, otherwise it is not credible to track it secretly, and it is not as if it is a movie.\u201dMu Qirong still felt that something was wrong. If the other party wanted to track Lu Chengyu, why did they not think of installing a tracker. Maybe\u2026, Lu Chengyu had been on guard in secret?Mu Qihua seemed to guess what he was thinking, and he chuckled, \u201cI heard that the illegitimate son of the Yan family did not please Xiao Lu. You think that a person with such a high level of vigilance is so easy to be calculated by others.\u201dMu Qirong opened his mouth and recalled the first time he met Lu Chengyu. At that time, he asked Yan Mu to attend a reception held by his mother. Lu Chengyu\u2019s words and deeds easily made people feel good, even when making coffee, he remembered to add ice cubes to the piping hot coffee. At that time, Lu Chengyu had just been an assistant and was able to perform the details so well, which showed that he was a very meticulous person.Lu Chengyu, who was talked about by the two brothers of the Mu family, had now returned home. This time he returned to the small villa where he and Yan Mu lived. They did not go home for nearly a month. The roses in the garden outside were already blooming brilliantly, but he could not see them because it was too dark. He could see how beautiful the flowers bloomed by the light.After Zhang Zeyun sent the two to home, seeing that it was late, and knowing that there must be a lot to say between the two, so, he only sat in the living room for a while and left.As soon as Zhang Zeyun left, the atmosphere between Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu changed. He stretched out his hand to caress the wrinkle between Yan Mu\u2019s eyebrows, but Yan Mu grabbed his hand.After experiencing life and death and a short-term parting, the feelings between the two suddenly broke out under this action. The so-called affection filled with deep desire, that is, it was natural for the love to be in full bloom. [Please brainstorm the above, I can only write up to this point.\u3011After the tossing, the two went to the bathroom to take a shower, which again accidentally lit the fire, so they went at again. When Lu Chengyu lay on the bed, it was past three in the morning. He suddenly did not feel sleepy. He took the tablet from the bedside and logged into his Weibo, and he saw that there were more than 100,000 reposts and comments on it. All the messages were from netizens who cared about him and reposted stuff such as wishing him and Yan Mu happiness.\u201cLooking at these comments, they wish us happiness,\u201d Lu Chengyu moved the tablet in Yan Mu\u2019s direction, and patted his arm to let him come and take a look.Yan Mu stretched his head over, glanced at it twice, and said, \u201cSo, we can\u2019t let everyone down.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and continued to scan Weibo. With this scan, he saw that the second most popular Weibo was \u201cHuading\u201d. \u201cThe president shed tears at the airport for his lover\u201d, the headline was about the flight crash. He glanced at Yan Mu next to him, and then clicked on the Weibo with tears in his eyes.When the post opened, Yan Mu\u2019s eyes were red, and Lu Chengyu\u2019s dazed photo came into Lu Chengyu\u2019s eyes, and he was stunned at the first glance. He never thought that Yan Mu would be so embarrassed, he never even thought that Yan Mu would have a moment of tears. But looking at this photo, he suddenly realized that no matter what Yan Mu\u2019s identity or personality was, he was his weakness.He suddenly raised his head to look at Yan Mu. Seeing that his eyes were dodging, he obviously didn\u2019t expect that Lu Chengyu would see this kind of photo, so he was a little embarrassed for a while.\u201cMwah,\u201d Lu Chengyu embraced his neck and kissed him hard on his lips without saying anything, but it seemed more powerful than any language.After a long while, Yan Mu saw Lu Chengyu still seeing related Weibo posts, and then he said, \u201cWe will take a day off tomorrow, and then we will go to the day after for work.\u201d\u201cOK, I just have some things to do,\u201d he glanced at the tablet, sae the news about the flight crash on the screen, after sighing, he closed the news page, \u201cTomorrow you will stay with me.\u201d\u201cOkay, go to sleep,\u201d Yan Mu touched Lu Chengyu\u2019s neck, not knowing whether it was intentional or unintentional, his index finger touched a place with a hickey.Lu Chengyu glanced at him with a faint smile, put the tablet on the bedside table, \u201cGo to sleep.\u201dYan Mu calmly kicked the quilt on his side to the ground, and then got into the quilt that Lu Chengyu was covering himself with. Then he stretched out his hand and patted the quilt covering the two of them, \u201cGood night.\u201d Taking advantage of the situation, he kissed Lu Chengyu\u2019s face with a serious face.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHe was playing a rogue with an expressionless face, is that also a rogue, okay?It was not that Lu Chengyu hadn\u2019t noticed Yan Mu\u2019s small movements, but thinking of Yan Mu\u2019s shock today, his heart softened, no matter if Yan Mu squeezed into his quilt, he closed his eyes and fell asleep in a short time.Yan Mu slowly opened his eyes, looked at the person sleeping next to him, and closed his eyes again after a long while.Lu Chengyu woke up after ten o\u2019clock in the morning, and Yan Mu, who was already awake, was lying beside him. After the two of them had washed together, they stood in front of the mirror and looked at the hickey on each other\u2019s necks. Lu Chengyu smiled. \u201cFortunately, it\u2019s winter, otherwise, these must be seen by others.\u201dYan Mu remained silent, but Lu Chengyu handed him a black and white scarf after changing clothes for going out.After Lu Chengyu took it and put it around his neck, he saw Yan Mu holding a scarf of the same color around his neck. He smiled and watched Yan Mu\u2019s small movements, reaching out and handing him a pair of gloves.After they got dressed and went out, they rushed to the airport. After learning about the compensation from the flight company, Lu Chengyu decided to compensate each family affected by the crash with another 200,000 cash. He did not go to see the family members, but discussed the decision with the relevant staff. As he expected, more than a dozen people on this flight were bachelors who had never returned home for many years or had no father or mother.These people were almost all unemployed, and there were even a few who have had a criminal record. Lu Chengyu understood in his heart that perhaps these people were the ones who had been arranged to deal with him a long time ago. No matter what purpose these people had, Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t show any expression on his face. After transferring the compensation amount to the relevant staff, he left the airport.He did not go to see the families of the victims because he was worried that those people would become more emotional after seeing him. After all, he was also on this flight, but because of good luck, he escaped the catastrophe. Such great luck fell in the eyes of these family members, and it would simply be a blow. He didn\u2019t want to rub salt on their wounds, he might as well deal with this kind of thing in a low-key manner.The families of the victims had already been notified of the amount of compensation. Who knew that they heard the news that afternoon that a well-wisher had donated 200,000 yuan to each family member? There were a total of hundreds of passengers on the plane. The money was spent, but it was 50 or 60 million. Who was so big-hearted?After the reporters heard the news, they all sharpened their heads to inquire about the latest news. Who knew that even the families of the victims did not know who the donor was. So, these people began to inquire from the relevant departments and even made various inferences, and finally came to the conclusion that the most likely person to donate was Lu Chengyu, who was lucky enough to not board this flight.With the exposure of Lu Chengyu\u2019s investment in \u201cFlying Birds\u201d, everyone knew that Lu Chengyu was a wealthy man with nine-figure assets. But, no matter, how rich people were, they also loved money, but he took out fifty to sityx million at once, which really shocked a bunch of people.Some people said that he spent money to buy peace of mind because he escaped by chance; others said that he was grateful to God, so, he sympathized with the families of the victims. Some people also said that he was hyping up, but as soon as this kind of remarks came out, countless people sneered and asked those who said it was too much to spend 50 or 60 million to make hype, and these kinds of remarks quickly disappeared.From the outside, Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t care at all. For him, he just wanted to offer more financial help for the family members who had lost their loved ones, nothing more.He was not the Virgin Mary, but agreed with the sentence, that if you are poor, you should be good to yourself, and if you are rich, you should benefit the world. What\u2019s more, if something happened to him this time, no amount of money would be spent, and it would make Yan Mu sad. What was better than being alive?He glanced at Yan Mu who was sitting next to him and smiled.What could be better than living with someone you love?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After a day of rest, he went to work in the company.Although he was in the crew this month, Cao Jingshen emailed him any work that he needed to handle. The two cooperated very tacitly. But, when the employees of Huading faced Lu Chengyu, they didn\u2019t know what attitude they should use?Should they call Lu Chengyu special assistant or the second boss? Some time ago, because Lu Chengyu was not in the company, the personnel department finally arranged two temporary assistants for the boss, and Lu Chengyu became the special assistant. Everyone now knew that Lu Chengyu has made hundreds of millions with his own ability, and he had a close relationship with those family princes in the capital. They all felt that it was amazing that Lu Chengyu was still willing to be a special assistant, and that he must really love their boss.Therefore, when Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu appeared together at the company, he received the most enthusiastic looks from his colleagues. Even some of the colleagues who were usually familiar with him had strange eyes.After entering the elevator, Lu Chengyu coughed, \u201cMy colleagues seem to be very enthusiastic today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably been a long time since they have seen you,\u201d Yan Mu said unchanged, \u201cWe will inspect the branch in two days. Would you like to see the newly replaced financial manager in the company?\u201d\u201cI have read his profile.\u201d Lu Chengyu knew that the previous person had some problems, and was \u201cinvited\u201d out of the company by Yan Mu, so, the new financial manager took the position, Lu Chengyu checked the person\u2019s information and said, \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate.\u201dYan Mu nodded. After reaching the floor, the two got out of the elevator and walked to the president\u2019s office. When passing by the office area outside, Lu Chengyu found out that there were people sitting in the cubicle outside. He glanced briefly, then withdrew his gaze, \u201cAre these two new assistants arranged by the Personnel Department?\u201dAfter taking a casual glance, Yan Mu opened the door of the office and said, \u201cWell, they usually work here, which is equivalent to your assistant. If you need to run errands, let them do it.\u201d These two people, though, there was no problem with their identities, but their working ability was far from that of Lu Chengyu, so Yan Mu was unwilling to let these two people do something important.Lu Chengyu understood the meaning of Yan Mu\u2019s words. Seeing the two assistants stand up, he smiled at them, \u201cThanks for your work.\u201dBoth assistants were young men in their twenties. Seeing Lu Chengyu smile at them, they had the impression that he was a very gentle and polite person. After, Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu entered the office, they looked at each other and breathed a sigh of relief. To put it bluntly, their current position was originally the vacancy of Lu Chengyu, as he was on leave. If Lu Chengyu\u2019s mind was small, the two of them would have no place left. However, looking at the appearance of Special Assistant Lu now, it seemed that he had no particular dislike for them, so they were more at ease.After entering the president\u2019s office, Lu Chengyu glanced at the office that had hardly changed, \u201cThe two assistants outside look very tender.\u201d\u201cThey are two years older than you,\u201d Yan Mu checked the desktop, from the safe behind him. He took out two documents and handed them to Lu Chengyu, \u201cShengrong Company has started to take action.\u201dLu Chengyu took a look at the document and found that it was all about Shengrong Company\u2019s recent movements. After a general glance, he frowned and said, \u201cSheng Shaoyuan is very ambitious.\u201d\u201cIf you do business without ambition, you can\u2019t do it.\u201d Yan Mu also gave another document to Lu Chengyu, with a similar awkward emotion on his face. \u201cThis is also true. It\u2019s for you.\u201dLu Chengyu saw that he was not looking right, and he took the documents in a puzzled way. It turned out to be two copies of the real estate certificate. The owner\u2019s column read the names of him and Yan Mu. It was the big villa and small villa where he and Yan Mu lived. After closing the file, Lu Chengyu looked at Yan Mu with a smile and asked, \u201cAre you bringing your own dowry?\u201dYan Mu: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cKnock.\u201dAfter knocking on the door for a few seconds, Cao Jingshen leaned out half of his body from the door, \u201cI didn\u2019t disturb you, did I?\u201d He ignored the expressions of Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu, and put several reports on the desk, \u201cThese are the latest information of Shengrong Company.\u201d Speaking of this, he looked to Lu Chengyu, \u201cI heard that President Shengrong has recently been interested in the entertainment industry and invested in a large-scale production movie, the time it takes for the movie to be released, and the two you invested in, the time is almost the same.\u201dLu Chengyu raised his eyebrows, \u201cIsn\u2019t he a real estate player, he can still be seen as a bit of scum in the entertainment industry?\u201d\u201cWith your successful example, the circle has been very interested in investing in movies recently,\u201d Cao Jingshen pushed up his glasses, \u201cA movie made hundreds of millions of dollars, who wouldn\u2019t be jealous?\u201d He glanced at Lu Chengyu, \u201cYou have good luck.\u201d\u201cHehe, then I\u2019m so sorry to everyone.\u201d Lu Chengyu laughed twice, but kept Sheng Shaoyuan\u2019s affairs in his heart. He don\u2019t know if Sheng Shaoyuan was too affectionate. He always felt that Sheng Shaoyuan was always ready to fight him.He raised his head and glanced at Yan Mu. He didn\u2019t mention the real estate matter anymore. Instead, he smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to the office first, what\u2019s the matter for me.\u201dSeeing his expression as usual, Yan Mu didn\u2019t mean to refuse, and the corners of his mouth were slightly raised, \u201cOkay, don\u2019t be too tired.\u201dCao Jingshen on one side pushed his glasses and thought, this is the difference between family and outsiders. He, an outsider, had been with the boss for years, and he never saw the boss talk to him this gently. In this way, it could be seen that people were incomparable.Seeing Lu Chengyu out of the president\u2019s room, Cao Jingshen followed out, and then patted Lu Chengyu on the shoulder and said, \u201cAlthough there is a blessing if you survive a catastrophe, you should be careful in the future.\u201d Probably because of the cousin\u2019s wedding, he saw how indifferent Lu Chengyu\u2019s relatives were to Lu Chengyu, so, he took more care of Lu Chengyu. After seeing the news of the plane crash the day before yesterday, he thought that Lu Chengyu was really on the plane and he was sad. Later, he saw that Lu Chengyu was fine and was relieved by his appearance at the airport.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cPeople say that the scourge does not leave for a thousand years,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and grabbed Cao Jingshen\u2019s neck, \u201cI must be long-lived for a thousand-years.\u201dCao Jingshen was taken aback by his actions. He hurriedly looked back at the door of the president\u2019s room and said, \u201cDon\u2019t move your hands. If the boss sees me, I will not be able to clean myself, even if I jump into the Yellow River.\u201dLu Chengyu made a cut, and after strangling him hard, he withdrew his hand, \u201cWe have hooked our arms around each other often. When would Brother Mu be put in your shoes, your eyes are getting smaller.\u201d After that, he smiled and entered his office with the folder in one hand, leaving Cao Jingshen with a cool back.Pushing his eyes, Cao Jingshen sighed silently. It was because the boss had such a personality that it was especially scary when he was jealous. Xiao Lu was still too young.Although, he didn\u2019t come to the company for a month, when Lu Chengyu dealt with work matters, he was still as straightforward as usual, and he gave the other two assistants a lively lesson. Although, the two of them had lived two or three years in mainland China, they were indeed far behind with their working ability. In just half a day, they had to be convinced by Lu Chengyu\u2019s ability.At lunch time, after Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu appeared in the company cafeteria, they attracted a lot of onlookers. The employees who didn\u2019t think there was anything between them before felt that they had missed many wonderful things before. They had good friendship with Special Assistant Lu. Why didn\u2019t they see it before?Cao Jingshen, who often joined the two people for meals, also sat separately today instead of being a light bulb. Instead, he sat with a few people from the same department for his meal. He also had to deal with inquiries from a few colleagues from time to time, and even ate lunch with them.Just after Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu had eaten, Lu Chengyu received a call from his second uncle. It turned out that Lu Liang was getting married the day after tomorrow. The second uncle wanted to make the wedding more beautiful, so, he wanted him to drive a luxury car.Although Lu Chengyu had a normal relationship with his second uncle, in his memory, his second uncle was indeed a face-saving person. For his cousin Lu Liang\u2019s affairs, he was actually willing to open this mouth to him. It seemed that the bride\u2019s family conditions must be better than Lu Liang\u2019s family.He didn\u2019t have much friendship with his relatives now, but, Lu Liang had a good relationship with him when he was a child, and it was something he was very happy with. He took his cell phone and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll drive the car to the wedding company ahead of time.\u201dSecond Uncle Lu himself probably felt a little embarrassed. After repeatedly thanking him, he added, \u201cIf your friend with the surname Yan is free, please also invite him to enjoy the bar for a drink.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d Lu Chengyu knew that his affair with Yan Mu was a big deal. It\u2019s impossible for the Lu family to not know, but, he didn\u2019t need to explain this to them. After a few polite words, he hung up the phone.After he hung up the phone, Yan Mu frowned and said, \u201cYour relatives?\u201d He didn\u2019t have a good impression of those relatives in Lu Chengyu\u2019s family. He and Lu Chengyu had known each other for so long, and Lu Chengyu had been in the hospital several times, but he didn\u2019t see those relatives. The ones who have visited were only one or two juniors. But when it came to this kind of matter, they didn\u2019t forget Lu Chengyu.\u201cWell,\u201d Lu Chengyu took a sip of hot drink, \u201cI will drive our luxury car to meet the wedding party the day after tomorrow.\u201dYan Mu\u2019s expression suddenly changed a bit after hearing the words our, trying to make his eyes less rippling, \u201cThere is a car in our garage, just drive it, do we need to join the party?\u201dLu Chengyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat made Mu Ge so funny?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66On the day of Lu Liang\u2019s wedding, Lu Chengyu drove out of the garage a Bentley that Yan Mu didn\u2019t usually use. From his personal point of view, a luxury car like Bentley was not suitable for his style, but since, it was to be used as the main wedding car, he thought this kind of car was more suitable.Originally, Yan Mu planned to arrange for He Long to go to the wedding company to deliver the wedding car, but Lu Chengyu thought it would be better if he himself went. If he didn\u2019t go and arranged a driver instead, maybe the Lu family would start to make up the fact that he was now well-developed and showing off his identity in front of them or something.Today was Lu Liang\u2019s big day after all, and he didn\u2019t bother to get upset because of this kind of thing, anyway, there won\u2019t be much contact in the future.Someone regularly maintained Yan Mu\u2019s cars, so even though this Bentley was rarely used, it looked shiny and there was no trace of dust. He drove the car out of the garage, made a gesture to Yan Mu who was standing at the door, and then drove the car out of the villa door.When he drove the car outside the wedding company, there were already several cars parked outside. Lu Chengyu glanced over. They were almost all BMWs and Audis. Second Uncle Lu and Lu Liang were standing at the door with the wedding company watching the wedding company staff tying the floats.When the wedding staff saw the luxury Bentley car approaching, the foreman couldn\u2019t help but glance at Second Uncle Lu. He smiled and said, \u201cMr. Lu, is this the main wedding car you invited?\u201d Second Uncle Lu and Lu Liang, who was dressed as the groom also saw the Bentley, which was enough to dazzle people. The father and son were taken aback for a moment, and for a moment they were afraid to determine whether the owner was Lu Chengyu.At this moment, Lu Chengyu got out of the car. As soon as he appeared, it caused a small-scale sensation. Several young female employees almost brought out their hearts. If they didn\u2019t remember that they were at work, they would definitely have rushed to take a photo and autograph.\u201cSecond uncle, Brother Liang,\u201d Lu Chengyu adjusted the standing collar of his coat, walked to the father and son and smiled, even the beautiful eyebrows were stained with a smile, \u201cBrother Liang, congratulations.\u201dSeeing Lu Chengyu\u2019s attitude, Lu Liang was relieved at first, and felt a little guilty, so he smiled and said, \u201cThank you, drink two more glasses later.\u201d He glanced at Lu Chengyu and saw that there were no other vehicles. After hesitating for a while, he asked, \u201cDid Mr. Yan not come with you?\u201d\u201cI told him to wait and go directly to the hotel,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and pointed to the Bentley behind him, \u201cHe has important things to deal with, therefore, he didn\u2019t come right now.\u201dLu Liang smiled embarrassedly, when he heard that Lu Chengyu drove over early in the morning because of his marriage. Thinking of the Lu Family\u2019s attitude towards Lu Chengyu over the past two years, the more he thought about it, the more faceless he became.Second Uncle Lu\u2019s expression was also a little embarrassed, but when he saw the car that Lu Chengyu was driving, the embarrassment on his face turned into a smile, \u201cChengyu, thanks to you this time, or our old Lu family will be looked down upon by the wife\u2019s relatives.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and didn\u2019t speak. At this moment, a staff member wanted to take a photo with him, so he agreed. It was not that he didn\u2019t want to pay attention to Second Uncle Lu, but because he had pity for the bride who was about to marry Lu Liang. Second Uncle and Aunt were not good parents-in-laws. In the memory of his previous life, Lu Liang had a good relationship with his wife, but they didn\u2019t live with the second uncle in the second year after they got married. Maybe, it was because of their disagreements?Second Uncle Lu watched many men and women surround Lu Chengyu as a big figure, waiting for a group photo to sign, and couldn\u2019t help but whisper to his son, \u201cXiao Liang, isn\u2019t Chengyu gay? Why are there so many young people around him?\u201d In his mind, homosexuality made people different from ordinary people. He appeared so openly in front of everyone, this fact was more or less incomprehensible and unacceptable to him.\u201cDad!\u201d Lu Liang frowned, his cousin did so many beautiful things, how could the people in their family remember that he was gay?\u201cThey like Chengyu because he is handsome and a high-achieving student of university Q. He started his own business at a young age and became a rich man with more than nine figured assets. It is not because of his sexual orientation. Don\u2019t say that.\u201d Lu Liang lowered his voice, as a son, he couldn\u2019t talk about his father, but he knew in his heart that several elders in the family were doing something bad, \u201cThe elders in the family are not good, don\u2019t say this, it\u2019s not good for people to hear.\u201dWhen Second Uncle Lu heard his son say this, although he didn\u2019t agree with him in his heart, he didn\u2019t say these words again. After all the wedding cars were tied up, they needed to drive to the bride\u2019s house to pick up people. After Lu Chengyu took photos with some staff of the wedding company, he drove the main wedding car and asked Lu Liang to sit in the co-pilot and drove to the bride\u2019s house.Although the two cousins were kind to each other, Lu Chengyu noticed that Lu Liang was emotionally embarrassed, and pretended not to notice: \u201cI saw Brother Yi and others in the back car just now. They are your best man team?\u201d\u201cYes. Ah, I wanted to find you a place, but now you are the main driver of the wedding car, so you can\u2019t do two things.\u201d Somehow, Lu Liang suddenly thought of Dong Dong\u2019s wedding day when his elder aunt said that Lu Chengyu was unfavourable as his best man. He couldn\u2019t help but say again, \u201cIf I knew it, I would hire a driver again. After all, if you are here Chengyu, the bridesmaids will not embarrass me too much.\u201dWhat a clever man, Lu Chengyu, how could he not understand what Lu Liang meant. But he didn\u2019t care what the Lu family thought at all. Now doing these things was just because Lu Liang, a cousin of the same generation, was pretty good, as for how others think, it did not matter to him.\u201cThat\u2019s not okay. What if the bridesmaid sees me? The one in my family will tell me to go back and kneel on the keyboard,\u201d Lu Chengyu laughed out loud, \u201cBrother Liang, you still don\u2019t pit me.\u201dLu Liang was taken aback when he heard the words. He immediately followed up with a laugh, but the uncomfortableness in his heart gradually dissipated. He only felt that Lu Chengyu was really a good person. Their Lu family didn\u2019t treat him so well, but he could still treat everyone so well. He was really incompetent as a cousin.When all the ceremonies were over and the group arrived at the hotel, Lu Chengyu saw Yan Mu standing at the door of the hotel at a glance. Among the guests coming and going, only he was particularly conspicuous.After stopping the car, Lu Chengyu strode to Yan Mu and asked with a smile, \u201cHave you waited for a long time?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Yan Mu knew that people around him were looking at him, but he, who was often watched, didn\u2019t care about such looks at all. He touched Lu Chengyu\u2019s hand, and after making sure it was warm, he walked aside with Lu Chengyu and looked at the bride and groom stepping into the hotel on the red carpet, \u201cYou only drank a glass of breakfast milk this morning, and didn\u2019t even eat breakfast. Are you hungry?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I ate before the wedding company,\u201d Lu Chengyu said. He gave the red envelope to the place where he was hanging the gift, then stretched his head to Yan Mu\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cI can finally hand in a gift and have two meals.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgYan Mu was taken aback for a while to understand what he meant. He nodded very seriously and said, \u201cIt is very necessary to bring family members on this occasion.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m right,\u201d Lu Chengyu glanced around, seeing his uncles walking towards this side with a weird expression on their faces. As soon as he saw them, he returned a smile, \u201cUncle, Auntie.\u201d\u201cOh Chengyu, I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time.\u201d The love affair was also clear, and she smiled politely and alienatedly, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d\u201cAunt Xie is concerned, it\u2019s good,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled lightly, \u201cI heard that Brother Dong has been promoted. I\u2019m busy with work recently, had no time to congratulate brother Dong, was brother Dong angry with me?\u201d\u201cHow come Xiao Dong is just a department manager, where you breath more than comparable commitments?\u201d Great aunt glanced around Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu, \u201cYou are the one who does great things, and Xiao Dong in our family can\u2019t compare to it.\u201dUncle Lu felt that the big aunt wasn\u2019t speaking properly, so, he stretched out his hand and was glared at by her.Lu Chengyu knew that the aunt was upset, so she ignored him.\u201cDepartment managers do still have a lot of room for development,\u201d Yan Mu glanced at Aunt Lu indifferently. \u201cI don\u2019t know what company Lu Liang works for. The top 20 group bosses in this city still have some friendship with me.\u201dThe eldest aunt was speechless. Jingcheng could be regarded as one of the domestic economic centers. Was it possible for ordinary people to enter in these companies? Not to mention being a department manager.\u201cHehe, Mr. Yan is a busy person, so there is no need to trouble you.\u201d The aunt felt a little embarrassed.\u201cOkay,\u201d Yan Mu actually nodded, \u201cIf you need help with something, you can ask Xiao Lu.\u201dThis was a polite remark elsewhere, but in front of Aunt Lu, it was like she was slapped in face by Lu Chengyu, who she looked down upon, because he was the most promising person in the Lu family now, and she could say things like helping out casually. Wasn\u2019t this showing off? But her own son couldn\u2019t compare, so she held her breath secretly and stopped talking.Lu Chengyu smiled and watched Yan Mu\u2019s \u201cpolite\u201d conversation with his eldest aunt. After seeing her ugly face, he said, \u201cBrother Mu, Brother Dong is a rare talent. Where we need help from others, the time is coming, let\u2019s go in. \u201cYan Mu nodded and followed behind Lu Chengyu into the hotel.After the two entered, the eldest aunt said to eldest uncle Lu angrily: \u201cIsn\u2019t it just getting pai money, what can he do?!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d Although Uncle Lu was indifferent to Lu Chengyu, he was his own nephew after all. His wife\u2019s words were too ugly, \u201cPeople make money by their own ability, don\u2019t buckle the shit bowl.\u201d The eldest aunt\u2019s face became heavy, but the hotel entrance was crowded and it was not easy to quarrel. In addition, seeing her son and daughter-in-law walking towards this side, she finally had to hold her words back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the master of ceremonies completed the whole process, the wedding banquet officially began. Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu were sitting together. At the same table were some distant relatives of the Lu family. No matter what these distant relatives thought of Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu\u2019s relationship, but because of their identities, the other people on the table were very polite to them and others were warm and greeted the two to pick up dishes.The dishes at the wedding banquet were basically more meat based and less vegetarian. Lu Chengyu felt that these things were not as good as those made by Yan Mu at home. After eating a few chopsticks, he lost his appetite. He planned to wait for the bride and groom to come to toast and then go home.\u201cNo appetite?\u201d Yan Mu saw that Lu Chengyu barely moved his chopsticks, glanced at the table full of dishes, scooped a bowl of soup for him, and said in a low voice, \u201cFirst, drink some soup to pad your stomach, and Zhuang Yu would treat us to dinner tonight.\u201dZhuang Yu found out where there is delicious food again? Lu Chengyu felt that the motivation for Zhuang Yu to make so much money was to be able to eat all kinds of delicacies, but for him, with such a friend around him, was a blessing, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll find him later.\u201dThe person next to him saw that Lu Chengyu got along well with Yan Mu, who was glamorous and noble from beginning to end, with different thoughts, but no one looked at the two people openly. They occasionally looked at them secretly, and then quickly withdrew their gazes.When the bride and groom came to toast, Lu Chengyu found that when the bride saw him, the smile on her face was two points brighter.After Lu Liang introduced most of the guests on the table, he jokingly said, \u201cYou have already met my cousin Lu Chengyu. This is his partner, Mr. Yan.\u201d\u201cHello, Mr. Lu and Mr. Yan,\u201d the bride Ye Xin smiled and raised her wine glass and said, \u201cThank you both for coming to our wedding in your busy schedule.\u201dAfter the two parties finished drinking, Ye Xin did not leave immediately, but deliberately said a few more words with Lu Chengyu to confirm that the cameraman took a picture of them. They left with a smile on their faces only after the pictures of their conversation were taken. As Lu Chengyu\u2019s old fan, it was a great surprise in life to have Lu Chengyu be her driver on the day of her wedding.Yan Mu silently glanced at the back of the bride and groom, and then at Lu Chengyu. The bride only needed to look at her groom. What did his family\u2019s person do?\u201cBrother Mu, whay are you looking at me like this?\u201d Lu Chengyu put down the dishes and wiped his mouth with a tissue, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dYan Mu helped him pick up the mobile phone that he forgot on the table, stood up and nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dWhen the other people on the table saw that Lu Chengyu was about to leave, they all said goodbye politely. After taking a few photos with Lu Chengyu, Lu Chengyu successfully left the table.\u201cChengyu.\u201dWalking to the door of the hotel, Lu Chengyu heard someone calling him. Looking back, he saw his aunt\u2019s son, Sun Junyi, running towards him with a red envelope in his hand. According to the custom, the car used to carry the bride and groom was generally treated as a happy car. The newcomer\u2019s family would give the driver a red envelope to show auspiciousness. No matter the amount, there was always the intention. If the red envelope was not given, the driver would be out of luck, so this had all become a matter of convention.Sun Junyi handed the red envelope to Lu Chengyu, panting slightly, \u201cI almost didn\u2019t catch up to you, why are you leaving now?\u201d After saying this, he glanced at Yan Mu and smiled politely at him and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to my house for dinner.\u201d\u201cThank you cousin, I have something to do at night, so I won\u2019t go.\u201d Although Lu Chengyu was not superstitious, he still took the red envelope and handed it to Yan Mu beside him, \u201cGive you joy.\u201dYan Mu accepted the thick red envelope blankly, glanced at Sun Junyi, and said nothing.Seeing the intimacy between the two, Sun Junyi, a straight man, was a little uncomfortable, and looked away from them \u201cThat\u2019s ok, you can come again later when you have time.\u201d He said after a moment of awkward silence, \u201cIf there is anything in the future, You\u2026remember to call us brothers.\u201d In order to avoid making Lu Chengyu think that he intended to cling to him, after Sun Junyi said this dry sentence, he left with a few words. Obviously, he didn\u2019t know how to get along with Lu Chengyu.After the two got in the car, Yan Mu started the car and said, \u201cYour cousin is good.\u201dLu Chengyu laughed and buckled his seat belt, \u201cThis cousin stayed in my house for a while, but that\u2019s it.\u201d He never thought about how much these relatives could do for him, or how much others could help him. They didn\u2019t want to help him, they didn\u2019t break the law, and they didn\u2019t owe him anything, \u201cEach one has a family. It\u2019s boring to think too much.\u201dYan Mu heard the indifference in his tone, so he didn\u2019t continue this topic and changed the topic to other things. When they arrived at the hotel they had agreed with Zhuang Yu, the two of them just walked to the door and saw that there was something wrong with the atmosphere inside. Zhuang Yu was holding a purple cup and drinking tea. Qi Jingfeng and Zhang Zeyun didn\u2019t seem to look happy. They saw both of them. When they came, Zhang Zeyun\u2019s face turned a little awkward, and he personally poured tea for the two of them, \u201cYou came here so soon after the wedding banquet?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that there was nothing to do, so, we came here as soon as possible.\u201d Lu Chengyu took a sip from the teacup and watched Zhuang Yu, \u201cWhy is Brother Zhuang\u2019s face so ugly? What happened?\u201dZhuang Yu put the tea cup back on the table, frowning and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s the illegitimate son brought back by the old man.\u201d When he said this, he snorted, and his expression quickly became indifferent. \u201cThere were some fun things on the sixth floor, so let\u2019s go play.\u201dAnyway, it was still one in the afternoon. Lu Chengyu and others also intended to make Zhuang Yu feel better, so after reaching the sixth floor, they found that the fifth to eighth floors of this hotel were all places for having fun. The sixth floor was somewhat similar to a more elegant casino. But it was not as chaotic as a casino. The few people changed some money for chips. Lu Chengyu saw Zhuang Yu bet on the chips as if just playing, and he didn\u2019t feel distressed if he lost. They were usually like ordinary people, but there were always some places that were different from ordinary people.At least no ordinary person had ever played with chips worth more than 100,000 yuan in just half an hour, and the more he played, the happier he was. This kind of aura was hard to buy. It was not something ordinary people could have.Lu Chengyu had no interest in gambling this thing, but he also changed a few thousand yuan in chips to play, who knew how he even won another ten thousand back?\u201cYou kid are patronized by the God of Wealth, right?\u201d After losing the 200,000 chips, Zhuang Yu saw that the chips that Lu Chengyu had just changed had now become nearly 20,000. He was rather speechless, \u201cDo you know what a big winner in life is? You\u2019ll know by looking in the mirror.\u201dLu Chengyu raised his eyebrows and generously allocated more than half of his chips to him, \u201cCome on, I will give you the fortune.\u201dZhuang Yu didn\u2019t think that Lu Chengyu\u2019s chips were too small, and took it with a smile. After coming over, he said, \u201cThe lucky ones in the casino don\u2019t even go to the toilet easily. I\u2019m afraid that the good luck will be washed away. You actually gave me most of it, buddy!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cWhat and whom?\u201d Lu Chengyu shot and patted Zhuang Yu on the shoulder and saw that he was holding the chips to continue playing. He went to the bar and took a drink and started drinking slowly. Turning around, he saw Yan Mu playing cards with Zhang Zeyun expressionlessly. He didn\u2019t like these things either.Sure enough, after a while, he saw Yan Mu and Zhang Zeyun walking towards him after losing the chips in their hands, and they didn\u2019t mean to win back if they lost.Lu Chengyu ordered two drinks and handed them to the two of them. He smiled and said, \u201cWhy did you come back so soon, lost all the chips?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s boring,\u201d Zhang Zeyun took the drink and sipped. He sat on the high stool and looked at Zhuang Yu still losing money like running water. Zhang Zeyun said in a low voice, \u201cLao Zhuang does not have any other problems, that is, he likes to spend money when he is in a bad mood. Today is not a big deal, he will stop if he loses hundreds of thousands.\u201dLu Chengyu: \u201cHaha.\u201d\u201cHowever, I saw you played quite casually, why did you win a lot?\u201d Zhang Zeyun asked with some confusion.Lu Chengyu smiled and said: \u201cWhen I was in college, my math grades were the best in the branch, and the memorization of texts was also the fastest in the class.\u201d\u201cWhat does this have to do with winning?\u201d Qi Jingfeng, who just walked over, heard their conversation. As a poor student, he didn\u2019t understand the world of learning at all.Lu Chengyu was silent, but smiled.\u201cProbably related to calculating probability and memory,\u201d Yan Mu answered with a drink, \u201cbut luck is also very important.\u201dQi Jingfeng and Zhang Zeyun immediately looked at Lu Chengyu with admiring eyes. They turned out to have learning God in their midst, and they might also become the Godly Gamblers with his advice. This kind of person who went against the sky, the meaning of his existence was to blind people\u2019s eyes, right?An inconspicuous smile appeared on Yan Mu\u2019s face. He stretched out his hand on Lu Chengyu\u2019s shoulder and said in a gentle voice: \u201cWell, playing with them is just to pass the time. It\u2019s useless if you ask Xiao Lu about it.\u201dQi Jingfeng with Zhang Zeyun: \u201c\u2026\u201d They were annoyed, when they saw their friends\u2019 PDA.When several friends were arguing with each other, Lu Chengyu looked up and saw an unexpected person appear at the door.Yan Mu found him looking at the door, then raised his head, his eyebrows moved slightly, then he retracted his gaze, and said to Lu Chengyu, \u201cYou didn\u2019t eat much at noon, eat a piece of cake.\u201d After speaking, he turned and asked the waiter to bring a plate of cake.Lu Chengyu stretched out his hand and twisted away the cherries on the cake. As soon as he threw it into his mouth, he saw Sheng Shaoyuan walking towards them, with that signature smile on his face.\u201cWhat good day is today? I could see Mr. Yan, Xiao Zhang, and Xiao Qi on this occasion.\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan took off his gloves and stretched out his hand in front of Yan Mu.Yan Mu stretched out his hand and shook his hand for a while, then slightly curled the corner of his mouth and said, \u201cMr. Sheng is too humble.\u201dSheng Shaoyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201d Was he being humble?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He heard something in Sheng Shaoyuan\u2019s words. He glanced at the secretary behind Sheng Shaoyuan. He jumped off the high stool. His index finger clicked on the counter table and laughed. He said to the bartender, \u201cGive us a glass of Louis XIII for Mr. Sheng.\u201d After saying this, he looked back at Sheng Shaoyuan and said, \u201cPresumably the amount of alcohol is good.\u201d The bartender opened the wine. He took a few clean wine glasses, poured a glass and put it in front of Sheng Shaoyuan, made a slow gesture, and politely stepped aside.Sheng Shaoyuan glanced at Lu Chengyu, held up the short-footed wine glass and slowly shook the red liquid in the wine glass. After taking a sip, he smiled and said, \u201cThank you, Assistant Lu for the warm hospitality.\u201d He seldom told others not to drink too strong foreign wine. Lu Chengyu probably didn\u2019t know about this. Now, he came up and drank the strongest Louis XIII by himself, not knowing if it was accidental or because of something else.Hearing this thank you, Lu Chengyu smiled slightly, \u201cYou are welcome, Mr. Sheng.\u201d The place they were in was originally a high-end club hotel, and most people couldn\u2019t even enter, so, the most indispensable thing here was expensive tobacco and alcohol. He heard that Sheng Shaoyuan\u2019s words meant to tease him, so, he did not give a big or small reaction or added a block to the other party.Qi Jingfeng and Zhang Zeyun were not very familiar with Sheng Shaoyuan. But after all, they were all in the capital city circle, and they knew a little about Sheng Shaoyuan, who was a local snake in S City. However, they saw that this person was not easy to deal with, especially after seeing Lu Chengyu inviting him to drink this kind of wine, they became more vigilant in their hearts.\u201cMr. Yan is very lucky to find such a good helper,\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan glanced at the wine in the glass, then smiled and said to Yan Mu, \u201cIt seems that we should be really envious.\u201d This seemed to be enviable, but in fact he described Lu Chengyu as a little white face dependent on Yan Mu. Perhaps in Sheng Shaoyuan\u2019s eyes, even if Lu Chengyu was worth hundreds of millions, it was still far behind Yan Mu and the two would soon be separated.Hearing Sheng Shaoyuan\u2019s words, Zhang Zeyun somehow, suddenly saw in his mind the cool look of Lu Chengyu when he beat someone. He unconsciously stood a step away from Sheng Shaoyuan and nudged towards Lu Chengyu to show his position.\u201cMr. Sheng, what kind of help are you talking about? He has never liked cooking at home. If he were not for me, he would probably be hungry and faint,\u201d Yan Mu said, \u201cHe is a big man worth more than 100 million yuan but because of me he is holding the position of an assistant, he is already very wronged.\u201dSheng Shaoyuan twitched his lips and smiled. He didn\u2019t expect that Yan Mu would be willing to say these things for Lu Chengyu\u2019s sake. He raised his eyebrows and looked at Lu Chengyu, who kept smiling from beginning to end. This look was indeed very dazzling among men, but no matter how handsome he was, he was only a man. He really didn\u2019t expect Yan Mu\u2019s taste to be like this.\u201cYours is mine. I am helping myself. Why would I feel wronged?\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and looked at Sheng Shaoyuan. \u201cWhat is there to admire Mr. Sheng, you are better than me, and you will definitely find a partner who will make you happy.\u201dThis sounded very polite, but why did it feel as if there was something wrong? Qi Jingfeng, who was next to him, glanced at the two of them suspiciously, but seeing that Sheng Shaoyuan was still smiling, he just sat aside and had a drink.Sheng Shaoyuan knew that Lu Chengyu was giving him back what he had just said. He didn\u2019t get angry and laughed. He brought up the Louis XIII bottle to pour good wine for all the people present, then raised his own glass and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a rare meeting. Let\u2019s have a drink together.\u201d He had never been able to drink a mere glass of wine when an outsider revealed his preferences.Lu Chengyu picked up the wine glass, and slowly touched it with Sheng Shaoyuan, then changed hands and touched with Yan Mu with a smile, before taking a sip with grace, as if it was a high-end reception, not a place for fun.Zhang Zeyun glanced at the few people with a smile, knowing that Sheng Shaoyuan was not simple, he was probably a competitor in Mu Ge\u2019s business, so Lu Chengyu was very cooperative in everything he did, and he was no exception.After drinking the wine, Sheng Shaoyuan put down the wine glass, smiled and pointed to the table. After scanning Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu, he said gracefully: \u201cHere, what\u2019s the meaning of not playing? Assistant Lu will you play with me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t play well, Mr. Sheng, don\u2019t laugh,\u201d Lu Chengyu agreed without hesitation, and then sat down opposite Sheng Shaoyuan at the poker table, then raised his hand and said, \u201cMr. Sheng, please.\u201d\u201cPlease, \u201cSheng Shaoyuan lit a cigar, and the smile on his face became brighter. The secretary behind him glanced suspiciously at the laid-back Lu Chengyu. According to the investigation report, Lu Chengyu never got stuck, and the days between him and Yan Mu were even more easy going. Sitting at the poker table now, there was no sign of timidity in him. The pressure was really invisible on this young man who had just made a fortune.And this Yan Mu also indulged his little lover Lu Chengyu, who threw the man aside, and sat there waiting for the dealer to deal the cards.\u201cRaise!\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan didn\u2019t look at the cards in his hand and threw out a bunch of chips.\u201cFollow.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and pushed out the pile of chips beside his hand, then smiled and glanced at Yan Mu, who turned the money into a pile of chips and put it beside him.\u201cAssistant Lu is very blessed,\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan played a cigar. \u201cPeople like Mr. Yan are all obedient to you.\u201dLu Chengyu knew that he was mocking him for fascinating Yan Mu by various means. Because of Yan Mu and Sheng Shaoyuan and their identities, there were already a lot of people watching the excitement at the poker table. Sheng Shaoyuan\u2019s words were not for him, but for those watching the excitement.\u201cHe is mine. It\u2019s normal to ask him to change some chips for me,\u201d Lu Chengyu played with a chip, as if he couldn\u2019t hear what Sheng Shaoyuan said, and said with a smile, \u201cThe so-called lover, what\u2019s yours is mine. Mine is yours. If you care about these trivial matters, what is a lover. Mr. Sheng, what do you think?\u201dThose who could play here were all people with certain identities. After listening to Lu Chengyu\u2019s words, everyone saw again. Yan Mu behind him did not even object at all, and even showed a bit of joy, and he had to admit that the famous Young Master Yan in the capital had been planted in the hands of this man.\u201cAssistant Lu has great opinions,\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan pushed the chips out in a pile, meaning to continue to raise, \u201cIt looks like this person is very compliant to you.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and didn\u2019t say anything, but just put out his chips and continued to follow him. Obviously he was not intimidated by Sheng Shaoyuan\u2019s wealth, but it made the people around him more interested in watching the game.Not to mention that the two of them threw out hundreds of thousands of chips in one hand, but the gossip between Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu was enough to make them curious. Originally, they thought that Mr. Yan was only fooling around with Lu Chengyu for a while, but looking at how he was now, Master Yan seemed to really love Lu Chengyu. Seeing this, there were still things that depended on Lu Chengyu.Everyone was busy watching the excitement and were not interested in who won or lost the game. So, when Sheng Shaoyuan and Lu Chengyu threw the chips on the table to open the cards, they were surprised to find that there were already more than a million chips on the table.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cQKA straight flush,\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan pinched out the cigar in the ashtray and sat leaning on the back of his chair, obviously satisfied with the cards in his hand.Lu Chengyu was not in a hurry to flip his cards, he smiled and applauded: \u201cGood cards, good cards.\u201dJust when the audience thought that Lu Chengyu was determined to lose, he slowly flipped over his cards, and said with a slightly surprised expression: \u201cOh, it\u2019s such a coincidence. It turned out to be three kings.\u201dEveryone exclaimed. His cards were better than those in Sheng Shaoyuan\u2019s hand. Most of the players at the scene mixed in the capital, and they were naturally more emotionally inclined towards Lu Chengyu, not Sheng Shaoyuan, who was an outsider from S City, so the hand was settled, and everyone around him suddenly clapped.\u201cAccepted,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled slightly towards Sheng Shaoyuan, and instead of looking at the chips that the croupier pushed towards him, he pushed back half of it. \u201cI\u2019m just joking with Mr. Sheng. Let\u2019s forget about these chips.\u201d\u201cAssistant Lu, what is this? Losing is losing, winning is winning, how can it be forgotten,\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan stood up with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s just a game to pass the time, Assistant Lu shouldn\u2019t be too polite.\u201dLu Chengyu followed and stood up and heard the words. He smiled: \u201cMr. Sheng is chic, I\u2019m not interested anymore.\u201dSheng Shaoyuan laughed twice, and then said: \u201cIt\u2019s normal to win or lose.\u201dZhang Zeyun heard that there was something wrong with this, and couldn\u2019t help but look sideways at Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu. Seeing that they both looked the same, they just looked casually as each other, but in his heart, he felt that Mu Ge and Xiao Lu were really a natural pair. At least their expression control ability was much better than him.After Sheng Shaoyuan left the poker table, he checked the time and smiled apologetically to Lu Chengyu and the others, \u201cI have something to do, and we will get together later.\u201d\u201cGo slow,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and watched Sheng Shaoyuan leave, and waited for him to disappear behind the door. He whispered to Yan Mu, \u201cThis President Sheng seems to have bad intentions.\u201dYan Mu hooked up the corner of his mouth: \u201cLeave him alone.\u201d Zhang Zeyun touched the bridge of his nose, looked at Yan Mu, and then at Lu Chengyu and kept silent.\u201cBoss, that Lu Chengyu is too arrogant,\u201d the secretary followed Sheng Shaoyuan, frowning, \u201cShould we find a way to clean him up?\u201d\u201cClean him?\u201d Sheng Shaoyuan stopped and looked up and down the thin secretary, \u201cYou can?\u201dSecretary: \u201c\u2026\u201dSheng Shaoyuan sneered, and then said: \u201cHe dares to be in love with Yan Mu despite the old man of the Mu family, he could be considered a little courageous. I hope that the Yan family and Mu family will be more lively. I\u2019m going to clean up what he did.\u201d The secretary lowered his head and thought, speaking so generously, as if you weren\u2019t irritated by the other party.Sheng Shaoyuan looked back at the clubhouse behind him, and twitched his mouth with his eyelids down. At least he now knew that Lu Chengyu was a fox who could not only bite people but was also difficult to deal with.He would just wait to see when the Mu family would take action.He didn\u2019t want to miss the excitement of Beijing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His principle of ordering was not to ask for the best, but to ask for the most expensive.Lu Chengyu smiled and allowed Zhuang Yu and Qi Jingfeng to eat as much as they wanted. After ordering the food, the originally grinning Zhuang Yu\u2019s expression became a lot more serious: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to mention things that would affect your mood at this time, but Xiao Lu, think about it, who have you offended?\u201d Don\u2019t look at them like this. They lived a luxurious life, but there was nothing wrong among them in private. He now directly asked Lu Chengyu, it was because Lu Chengyu had encountered many things recently.Zhang Zeyun didn\u2019t expect Zhuang Yu to ask so directly. He glanced at Lu Chengyu with some worry. Seeing that the other party didn\u2019t look be unhappy, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, just because Xiao Lu became a billionaire overnight, he attracted the hatred of a lot of people.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, your life path is like a winner in life, except that there are no beautiful women to hug you,\u201d Zhuang Yu shrugged, \u201cI mean, does anyone hate you enough to go to the extent of killing you?\u201dLu Chengyu remembered his previous life experience, and then recalled his journey from school to the present in this life, frowned and shook his head: \u201cI have no impression. I graduated from university and came to Huading to work. I invested before. Although, I made a lot of money in the movie, I have very little contact with people in the circle, and the relationship with the crew is pretty good. Even if someone was looking at me from behind, they don\u2019t have the ability to arrange so many means to kill me.\u201d If they had this kind of ability, those people would not still mix in some crews, they could just be investors who didn\u2019t need to show up.He remembered that when he met Huang Chuan in his previous life, it was at the premiere of \u201cThe Universe\u201d. At that time, because a company artist was going to attend the premiere and the assistant beside him became sick again, he was temporarily transferred to the star for the premiere.This time he deliberately joined the crew of \u201cThe Universe\u201d in order to observe the behaviour of the artist. After a month of observation, he found that the artist had no problems, and that could only show that he was really unlucky when he met Huang Chuan in his previous life.\u201cAccording to this, you won\u2019t have a big problem there,\u201d Zhuang Yu looked at Lu Chengyu several times, and hesitated, \u201cHave you ever thought\u2026maybe the problem lies with your parents?\u201d He and Zhang Zeyun checked. After the passing of Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents, they found that his parents had some unusual behaviour before their accidental death, but they couldn\u2019t find out the truth behind it, so they suspected that Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents might be involved in something.Lu Chengyu was silent. Before he went to the filming of \u201cThe Universe\u201d, he made a special trip home. In fact, he was looking for something related to his parents, but he didn\u2019t find anything suspicious. He frowned, \u201cMy dad was just the middle-level management employee of a company, my mother was just a university professor, who could they both offend?\u201dYan Mu, who had been silent, suddenly said at this time: \u201cThere is a very famous literary family in S City, the Xia family, I heard about this family. They lost a daughter decades ago, but because of an accident at home, there was no time to send too many people to find this daughter. It is said that more than ten years ago, the Xia family had news of finding their daughter, but suddenly the news disappeared. In the following days, everyone in the circle said that the Xia family was deceived, and many people saw their joke for a while.\u201dQi, Zhang, and Zhuang didn\u2019t understand why Yan Mu suddenly mentioned that, the Xia family was now considered top-notch in S City. But when they discovered that Lu Chengyu, who had always been smiling, had changed his face, they knew it was not that simple.Lu Chengyu felt that Yan Mu\u2019s idea was a little bold, but in his memory, he had never seen his grandpa and grandma. Even his mother\u2019s maiden family had little contact with them. His parents explained that his mother had no relationship with her family. So, the two families don\u2019t have much contact.Could it be said that the truth of the matter was that his mother complained about her mother\u2019s family because they hadn\u2019t cared about her after she was lost, and that\u2019s why this happened? He looked at Yan Mu and asked with some doubts, \u201cHow many years ago did the Xia family lose their daughter?\u201d\u201cForty-four years ago,\u201d Yan Mu said affirmatively, \u201cI heard that the missing daughter of the Xia family was only seven years old.\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s brows furrowed even more tightly. According to him, his mother\u2019s age was exactly 51 years old this year, but\u2026 the seven-year-old girl couldn\u2019t go home, how could she survive alone, let alone read so many books and become a university professor, it seemed\u2026something was wrong.\u201cXiao Lu, you won\u2019t be the grandson of the Xia family?\u201d Zhuang Yu looked at Lu Chengyu with a look of surprise, then looked at him up and down, then touched his chin and said, \u201cIf I look carefully at your eyebrows. It\u2019s a bit like the old lady of the Xia family.\u201d Everyone in the Xia family had a gentle appearance, and the temperament of the whole body made it clear that they were literary masters at a glance. However, when he first met Lu Chengyu, he thought that the other person was a very decent man, but after being together for a long time and becoming his good buddy, he discovered that the whole demeanour was fake, and he was clearly a pretentious fox.If he was really the grandson of the Xia family, then he must be genetically mutated or to say\u2026 the Lu family\u2019s genes had the upper hand.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t feel excited or anything else. In his opinion, the Xia family was just like that. Not to mention when he was the most desolate in his previous life, but in this life, no one in the Xia family had come to him. The only thing the Xia family did for him was to help him calm the ambitions of the relatives of the Lu family.Not to mention that during the hardest time in his previous life, no one from the Xia family came out to recognize him. Maybe it was really because his parents got in trouble, so no one in the Xia family wanted to help him.Family affection was not present, that\u2019s it. Lu Chengyu took these things very lightly and drank an appetizer tea poured by the waiter: \u201cIf the Xia family in S city is really my mother\u2019s family, it is my mother\u2019s business. Why bother about it?\u201dHearing the indifference in Lu Chengyu\u2019s words, Yan Mu stretched out his hand and patted his knees, and whispered softly: \u201cI have found someone to investigate. Liu Qiyan has something to do with the Xia family.\u201dLu Chengyu nodded. His parents really caused something serious. It was normal for a family as big as the Xia family to be difficult to get into. After all, one side was the children they raised, and the other was the daughter who had been missing for decades. Feelings were the most unsuitable for comparison. The Xia family just made the most sensible choice, not to mention that the Xia family had likely protected him many times in the dark.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgIt was not bad to be able to reach this step, \u201cI understand.\u201dZhuang Yu felt that the two were saying things that others didn\u2019t understand, but seeing Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu\u2019s expressions were not ugly, he knew that things weren\u2019t very bad. He just said, \u201cIf Mu Ge helped, it would be easy to solve.\u201d After speaking, he remembered that the Mu family hadn\u2019t really accepted Lu Chengyu as Yan Mu\u2019s partner, so he smiled embarrassedly, and then persuaded: \u201cIf you have anything to do in the future, you must tell us all. As the saying goes, three heads are worthy of another Zhuge Liang, we are much taller than the heads.\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s heart warmed when he heard these words, and he glanced at them. These three friends, knowing that they were not being polite, he smiled relievedly and said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will definitely let you help if I have something. Then you will not be able to run away if you want to run.\u201dYan Mu looked at him like he was a child. He looked at Lu Chengyu who was smiling next to him, and the corners of his mouth rose slightly.After the meal, the several people were going to go home. Lu Chengyu found out that all three of them were sitting behind their burly bodyguards. It seemed that the previous attack had taught them a profound lesson.Lu Chengyu did not go home, but asked Yan Mu to drive outside the old house where he had lived before. The community had been built for nearly 20 years, so it looked very old in appearance. The only thing worthy of praise was that the land was not so expensive back then, and the greenery in the community was not bad.In his previous life, he sold the old house in the community. In this life, he had no shortage of money, so the property was still in his name.In the activity area of the community, there were some old ladies sitting on small stools and chatting, and a few children were playing on the slides whose paint had chipped off. Lu Chengyu pointed to the slide with the original color no longer visible, \u201cThis slide was there when I was seven years old. When I was young, I used to play around here with a few children in the community.\u201dYan Mu glanced at the place where Lu Chengyu pointed. At a glance, in his opinion, Lu Chengyu\u2019s point of reference was not wide, but he could clearly distinguish Lu Chengyu\u2019s nostalgia for that time, so he just quietly listened to Lu Chengyu\u2019s childhood stories and asked questions occasionally.\u201cIn my memory, my lifestyle was no different from other people,\u201d Lu Chengyu led Yan Mu into the corridor. Although the community was old, the corridors were very clean, and it didn\u2019t make people feel like a mouse would come out at any time.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t this Chengyu? When did you come back here? Have you had dinner?\u201d An old lady who came out for a walk saw Lu Chengyu and said with enthusiasm, \u201cWhen you were young, you liked the tomato egg noodles made by aunt.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled and refused. After the old lady went downstairs, he said to Yan Mu, \u201cThe residents in this community basically all know each other. Other homes also help take care of the children. The youngest son of Aunt Liu\u2019s family who went down just now often made trouble with me when he was young, but he was the one who was beaten every time.\u201dYan Mu nodded: \u201cPeople in this community are very enthusiastic.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled, \u201cEveryone has been neighbours for many years.\u201d He walked to his door and looked at the grey-blue old-fashioned security door that had been stripped of paint. He took out the key and inserted it in the keyhole and then slowly opened the door.A thick layer of dust had accumulated in the room, and there was still a dull smell. Lu Chengyu stood outside the door and suddenly stopped. At this moment, he didn\u2019t want to step into this deserted room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although the furniture in the house was covered with a layer of dust and was a bit old, from the furnishing style of the house, it could be seen that this was a very warm family home, and even the furniture was preserved as far as possible.\u201cWhen I was young, my dad built a shelf on this wall to arouse my interest in learning. As long as I got good marks in exams, he would buy a cartoon character mould I liked and put it on it,\u201d Lu Chengyu pointed to the old style shelf. On the old multi-treasure rack, the Monkey King, Calabash Baby and other toys were still in good condition. He walked to the shelf, took off a fox enamel doll, poked its head, and saw that the fox\u2019s head began to sway from left to right. He smiled and put the doll back in its original position, and said to Yan Mu behind him, \u201cCome, I will take you to see the room I used to live in.\u201dYan Mu followed, and after entering Lu Chengyu\u2019s room, he saw that the furnishings in this room were neat and tidy, and there was no sign of moving. Looking around the house, he was silent for a moment before he said, \u201cIt\u2019s very good here.\u201d\u201cWhen our family first moved into the house, my parents said that this house was best for me,\u201d Lu Chengyu opened the window to let the house have better air circulation, \u201cI can see the trees, flowers and plants in the community outside the window of my room. My mother said that more green is good for the eyes.\u201d He didn\u2019t know if it was because he saw enough green when he was a child, but Lu Chengyu\u2019s eyesight had always been good. Although his work and rest were no better than other children.Standing next to the bookshelf, Yan Mu said: \u201cUncle and Auntie were very good to you.\u201d He wondered why, since their family of three had such a deep relationship, why they were involved in those complicated matters.Lu Chengyu smiled, tacitly acquiescing to this sentence, and ran his fingers across the rows of books on the bookshelf, and finally stayed on the book \u201cOne Hundred Thousand Whys\u201d, which was the book his father bought him when he was in elementary school. When the book was handed over to him, he also said that the book should be called \u201cOne Hundred Thousand Answers to Children\u201d.After more than ten years, the pages of the book looked a bit old. Lu Chengyu opened the book lightly. There were a few doodles of his own on it. Turning a page, there was a row of simple addition and subtraction, which looked like a child writing at will.Lu Chengyu paused with his finger, then quickly flipped through the pages. After finding it, he found that two adjacent pages were glued together.Yan Mu realized that something was not right, turned around and found Lu Chengyu a knife. Seeing Lu Chengyu\u2019s expression, he put the knife aside and put his hand around his back from behind.\u201cI always thought that my parents simply died in an accident. It seems that I was too stupid.\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled bitterly, he thought he was smart, but he wasted a lifetime before finding out that his parents were involved in other things before they died. The warmth coming from behind made Lu Chengyu feel much calmer. He took the knife next to him and slowly opened the two pages of the book glued together.Among the pages of the book was a thin piece of paper with a series of numbers and a few letters on it. Lu Chengyu looked at these numbers and recalled the number game that his father played with him when he was young. In order to exercise his memory, his father always used sorting to represent which article, which sentence in the article, and which book was represented by letters.At that time, his dad praised him as a genius, and he also liked to play this game, so until he graduated from elementary school, he had kept the Chinese language books for six years.Yan Mu saw that Lu Chengyu suddenly found a pile of Chinese textbooks from under his bed, and then rummaged through them, as if he had discovered something, but he didn\u2019t open his mouth to disturb him at will. Instead, he stood by the window and watched Lu Chengyu. He searched for a book of Chinese language textbook for elementary school students, as if he had read these books not long ago.Just when Lu Chengyu flipped through the last book, Yan Mu\u2019s cell phone rang suddenly. He looked back at Yan Mu by the window, and saw that his face, which had never had much expression, gained a little respect.After Yan Mu hung up the phone and saw Lu Chengyu watching him, he hesitated and said seriously: \u201cGrandpa said, he wants me to take you back for him to meet.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d Lu Chengyu looked out the window, the sky was about to darken, he smiled, and put the books neatly away. \u201cIs the old man going to invite us to have supper?\u201dYan Mu looked at his face. His smile seemed to be the same as in the past, as if the secrets just discovered didn\u2019t affect his mood. However, he always felt that something was wrong with the other party. \u201cThe chef at Grandpa\u2019s home is very good at cooking.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d Lu Chengyu stood up and clapped his hands. \u201cRespect for the elderly is a virtue that needs to be observed.\u201dSeeing that there was no reluctance on his face, Yan Mu returned the call that would pass back the message to Mr. Mu. When he finished the call, Lu Chengyu was already standing at the door as if he was all right.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Lu Chengyu closed the door of the room, walked out of the house with Yan Mu, looked at the silent living room, slowly closed the door, and then turned his head and smiled at Yan Mu, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to your house? I want to eat Yangzhou ramen?\u201dYan Mu: \u201c\u2026\u201dLu Chengyu chuckled, and the two went downstairs. When they were about to leave the community, a familiar old lady came in from outside and saw him. She smiled and said, \u201cIs this not Xiao Lu from the old Lu family. Came back to see the house?\u201dLu Chengyu looked back at the place where he had lived for more than ten years, smiled and nodded: \u201cYes, came back to have a look.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay to take a look,\u201d the old lady sighed. \u201cThe old lady of the Yang family died at the beginning of this year. The two families upstairs moved away. Next time you come back, I don\u2019t know how many more acquaintances you will see.\u201dLu Chengyu paused, then smiled. After getting into Yan Mu\u2019s car, he turned around and saw that the old lady who had spoken to him before was waving at him. Some of her rickety body was stained with signs of old age.The best times were always in people\u2019s memory, because when one missed these memories, they no longer existed.They were beautiful because there were no memories without nostalgia.Lu Chengyu retracted his gaze and looked in the front at the road. Through this old street, it was a prosperous and beautiful avenue, with neon lights flashing, and there would never be a shortage of handsome men and women on the sidewalks on both sides.\u201cIf you like, you can come and see it often in the future. The environment in the old community is pretty good.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLu Chengyu tilted his head to look at Yan Mu and smiled after an instant. He leaned back in his chair lazily and said with a smile: \u201cNo need.\u201dNo matter how good the memory was, time could never be turned back, and the mission of mankind was to step on the footprints of time step by step to the end of life. Although everything in the world would end in death, the scenery on both sides of the road of time had its own characteristics. How could he live up to this gift of time?Life was precious because of the scenery that needed you to move forward. And he might have found the most beautiful scenery in his life.Looking at Lu Chengyu puzzledly, Yan Mu found that the expression on Lu Chengyu\u2019s face was very relaxed, so he looked at the road ahead earnestly and drove the car very carefully.The atmosphere in the Mu family\u2019s old house at this time was not as good as between Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu. In the brightly lit house, Mr. Mu was sitting on the head seat, and a few younger generations were sitting near him. Mu Qihua and Mu Qirong were also among them.Due to the face of the old man, a few younger generations sat upright, but most of them still had some disapproval in their hearts. Wasn\u2019t it just a cousin playing with a man? What was the big deal?\u201cGrandpa, it\u2019s so late, you should rest,\u201d Mu Qihua said with a smile, \u201cI will entertain him when cousin comes back, why do you need to wait in person?\u201d\u201cWhy, this old man wants to see? It\u2019s not okay to look at my grandson?\u201d Mr. Mu picked up the cup and took a sip of tranquilizing tea, and gave Mu Qihua a cold glance.Mu Qihua silently shut up. In front of his grandfather, all his methods and eloquence were useless. Cousin, brother can only help you until here, you ask for your own blessings.As soon as the grandfather and grandson finished saying these words, they saw the helper with Yan Mu coming in from outside the gate. Mu Qihua looked back and almost didn\u2019t cover his eyes directly. Why did his cousin bring Xiao Lu here?\u201cGrandpa.\u201d Yan Mu handed the gift they bought to the helper, and then introduced Lu Chengyu, \u201cThis is Lu Chengyu, this is Grandpa.\u201d This tone seemed to be certain that the old man knew the relationship between him and Lu Chengyu.Grandfather Mu twitched the corners of his mouth and said politely to Lu Chengyu: \u201cYoung man, please sit down.\u201d After he asked the helper to make tea for the two of them, he didn\u2019t ask Lu Chengyu about Huading or his family background or how he got together with Yan Mu. He said politely, \u201cI heard that Mr. Lu is very capable and helped Xiao Yan a lot in his work.\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s smile was much gentler than that of Mr. Mu. He put on a gesture of respecting the elder but not making himself humble: \u201cGrandpa Mu, you are being polite. I should help Brother Mu.\u201d As soon as these words came out, all the juniors of the Mu family looked at Lu Chengyu and carefully looked at the old man. Seeing that the old man was not angry, they decided to watch the excitement while remaining silent.After all, being told by their grandfather to learn from this cousin since they were children, for so many years, to finally be able to watch his excitement, it was simply a good way to get revenge.Two cups were served quickly, and Lu Chengyu politely picked up and took a sip, then put the teacup back in place in a natural posture, showing a good expression.Grandfather Mu then said: \u201cI hear you escaped an accident, do not know if you were frightened.\u201dGrandfather Mu referred to the issue with the flight, and it was a seemingly ordinary question, but Lu Chengyu felt from his tone, that he seemed to know some things.Yan Mu spoke at this time: \u201cGrandpa, everyone is in a good mood today, so don\u2019t mention these unhappy things.\u201dMu Jianzhong: Where do you see that everyone is in a good mood? !Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although it was frightening, I was lucky enough to meet Yan Mu.\u201d Lu Chengyu recognized that Mr. Mu was the mysterious man who had talked with him during the start-up ceremony of the \u201cThe Universe\u201d. He understood in his heart that he was a big man, even if he really disagreed with Yan Mu being with a man, he would not use money to hit people like those romantic dramas. As for whether he would do anything else, Lu Chengyu believed that even if this old man really wanted to do something, even if he had a net worth of hundreds of billions, it was not enough for him to want to harm him. The reason why he could be so comfortable was also precisely because of the status of this old man, who could stand in such a high position, where he always paid attention to etiquette in his work, and thus was not the type to pressure someone to do what he wanted.As long as the other party could be reasonable, he would not act unreasonably with them.Elder Mu nodded, then glanced at the other juniors around him again, and said unhappily, \u201cYou\u2019re fine, you all can go back.\u201dSeveral juniors wanted to stay and watch the excitement, but because the old man had already spoken, they had to leave the old house of the Mu family, even the two brothers Mu Qihua and Mu Qirong had to leave slowly.After the few juniors left, only Lu Chengyu, Yan Mu, and Elder Mu were left in the spacious living room, and even the few helpers left the living room silently. Lu Chengyu put down the teacup very lightly, even though the living room was extremely silent, still there was no sound.\u201cThe matter between you two is known all over the country. Have you ever thought about how you will live in the future?\u201d It was Mr. Mu who spoke first. This time he looked at Yan Mu. Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t know if it was his illusion but always felt that the emotions in Mr. Mu\u2019s words were more worry than anger.\u201cGrandpa, I think it\u2019s very good now,\u201d Yan Mu was silent for a moment. \u201cI live with Xiao Lu very comfortably. Except for him being the same gender, we are no different from everyone else.\u201dFather Mu listened. He sighed and didn\u2019t ask about Yan Mu\u2019s children or what would he do if the two separated in the future, but meditatively said: \u201cYou chose the road yourself, and I hope you won\u2019t regret it.\u201dThis seemed to be a compromise, but he didn\u2019t seem to be optimistic about their relationship. Lu Chengyu saw that the old man really loved Yan Mu, his grandson, so he used this attitude to talk about this relationship that was not recognized by the mainstream society.\u201cGrandpa, we will live a good life, we will not make you worry.\u201d Yan Mu got up and bowed to Mr. Mu. Lu Chengyu got up and walked to Yan Mu and stood there without speaking.\u201cOkay, our Mu family doesn\u2019t need to do this,\u201d Mr. Mu grinned reluctantly at Lu Chengyu, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this kid you found being reliable, I wouldn\u2019t be rest assured to let you go this way.\u201dLu Chengyu laughed when he heard the words, \u201cThank you, Grandpa Mu for the praise.\u201dThe smile on the corners of his mouth was slightly stiff: \u201cThick skin is also one of your strengths.\u201dLu Chengyu: \u201c\u2026\u201dYan Mu coughed dryly, \u201cGrandpa, you! You called us?\u201d As a good partner, he needed to ease the atmosphere at this time.\u201cI asked you to come here because of this young man\u2019s business,\u201d Mr. Mu became serious. \u201cFirst of all, I want to apologize for investigating your matter privately, but as a grandfather, even if this is not e right, I can only do this.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Maybe someone I know will investigate Brother Mu because of me. The two of us haven\u2019t done anything shameful. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you check it or not.\u201dThe old man raised his eyebrows, nodded, and then pressed a small remote control on the coffee table. After a while, a young guard came in with a portfolio and placed it on the table in front of Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu.\u201cWhen I was investigating, I found some interesting things. If you are interested, Xiao Lu, take it back and have a look,\u201d Mr. Mu stood up and said, \u201cThis person is too old to stay up late. You will stay here tonight. I\u2019ll go back to my room and rest.\u201dYan Mu was going to help him back to the room. He waved his hand and said, \u201cGo, I\u2019m not yet old enough to need someone to help me to walk.\u201d After walking for two steps, he suddenly remembered something, so he stopped and turned his head back to Lu Chengyu and said, \u201cI heard that you have the habit of eating late-night snacks. There is a cook at home. Just ask him to cook what you like.\u201dLu Chengyu twitched his mouth and smiled. This old man had investigated his habits very clearly. He even knew that he had a habit of snacking at night.The helper took the two to the guest room. After the helper left, Lu Chengyu looked at the neatly packed double bed and touched his chin and said, \u201cThat\u2019s it from your grandpa?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t grandpa tell you that there is a cook at home?\u201d Yan Mu walked to the window and closed the curtains, \u201cHe treats you as his own family.\u201d\u201cThis is a little bit different from what I imagined. At any rate, there should be some threats or cold treatment. He just accepted it calmly, it doesn\u2019t seem to be real enough.\u201d Lu Chengyu opened the closet, which contained necessary clothing and pyjamas suitable for the two of them. \u201cHe prepared very intimately.\u201dYan Mu walked to him and looked at the closet, then took out two sets of pyjamas. He came out and looked at the size. It was really the size of the two people\u2019s usual pyjamas. He handed Lu Chengyu a set, \u201cYou go to take a bath, and if you want to have a supper, I\u2019ll ask the cook to make it.\u201d Lu Chengyu took over the pyjamas and checked the time. It was already ten o\u2019clock in the night. He yawned, \u201cIf I eat too much, I won\u2019t be able to sleep. I have to go to work tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Yan Mu put on slippers, turned and went downstairs. Lu Chengyu looked at the closed door, and glanced at the portfolio that he had put on the table. He smiled, and instead of opening it immediately, he turned and went to the bathroom.After Yan Mu went downstairs and said to the cook what to make, he turned around and found Grandpa standing in the living room, paused, and then walked in front of Old Man Mu: \u201cGrandpa, haven\u2019t slept yet?\u201d\u201cAsked someone to make a midnight snack?\u201d Old Mu smiled. As he walked upstairs, Yan Mu followed.\u201cI remember you didn\u2019t have the habit of eating midnight snacks before, because eating food at night is bad for your health,\u201d Mr. Mu held on to the handrails of the stairs and turned to look at his always stalwart grandson.\u201cNo, I just eat with him occasionally,\u201d Yan Mu was a little embarrassed. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t eat at night, so he can\u2019t sleep well.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cWell, young people eat more and stay healthy,\u201d Mr. Mu nodded. \u201cHalf of his ability to fight can be attributed to eating.\u201dYan Mu: \u201c\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t help rubbing his nose, \u201cXiao Lu is also pretty good in other aspects.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Grandfather Mu sighed, \u201cIn fact, I really hoped he was a not-so-good young man, so at least I would have a reason to separate the two of you.\u201d He had investigated Lu Chengyu\u2019s files back and forth. He had done well since he was a child in the eyes of both teachers and classmates. A good student, even the neighbours were full of praise for him. There were no bad habits, he had a good character, strong working ability, economic acumen, and ability to deal with others better than ordinary people. He was considerate to himself. Such an excellent boy, let alone his grandson, anybody would want to grab him.What\u2019s more, it was his own grandson who was the first to provoke others. What position did he have as a grandfather to talk about? No matter how rich and powerful the Mu family was, that couldn\u2019t act in an unjust manner.Yan Mu was silent, and said: \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t worry about me, I know what I want since I was a kid.\u201dGrandfather Mu stopped, and his expression became more complicated when he recalled those things that happened more than ten years ago. In the end he just said helplessly: \u201cI know your temperament. From now on, you two will have a good time, and I will be relieved.\u201d After finishing speaking, he continued to walk upstairs, walked two steps and turned back, \u201cThe things affecting the kid are related to the grievances of the previous generation. I will help you settle some things. As for the rest, it is up to you to solve them.\u201d\u201cThank you, Grandpa.\u201d Yan Mu didn\u2019t expect Grandpa to let go so easily. This time the incident did involve a lot of relationships. Grandpa was willing to take action, which greatly increased his confidence in controlling the situation.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Mr. Mu waved his hand indifferently. \u201cIt\u2019s just two families fighting over and grabbing innocent people. Xiao Lu\u2019s parents were also implicated.\u201dYan Mu frowned: \u201cImplicated?\u201d\u201cWell, haven\u2019t you watched TV? When the bad guys do bad things, they are often accidentally discovered by passers-by. What was the end of passers-by in the end?\u201d Mr. Mu said a bit disgustedly, \u201cYou are so uninteresting at a young age. Be careful that Xiao Lu does not dislike you for being boring.\u201d After saying these words, Elder Mu swayed upstairs and with a stern and dazzling back.Yan Mu sighed helplessly. There was nothing he could do about Grandpa\u2019s behaviour like an old child. After returning to the room, he found that Lu Chengyu was already bathing in the bathroom. He glanced at the portfolio that had not moved on the table, and his expression relaxed slightly. He was worried about Lu Chengyu\u2019s recklessness because of his parents, now it seemed that he was thinking too much.After taking a shower, Lu Chengyu walked out of the bathroom and saw Yan Mu sitting while working on his computer. He leaned over to sit next to him and said, \u201cIs this the new plan submitted from below?\u201d Yan Mu sat aside and let Lu Chengyu sit down and see it more clearly, \u201cWell, you see if something is wrong.\u201dLu Chengyu wiped his hair and said, \u201cThis plan only pays attention to the three-dimensional life, but does not consider the Internet? Now, there are endless marketing methods in this area. Let\u2019s not say that it accounts for half of the sales, but at least we can\u2019t give up this one.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Yan Mu nodded, \u201cI have already given the project to another person. This one is better at propaganda.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Lu Chengyu yawned and tossed the towel used for wiping his hair aside. \u201cWhen will the supper be ready?\u201d\u201cIt will be done soon.\u201d Yan Mu closed the computer and wiped off his hair. Putting it aside, he took out the hair dryer to dry Lu Chengyu\u2019s hair. There was a knock on the door. He put down the hair dryer, \u201cOkay, get up.\u201dLu Chengyu sat up and watched Yan Mu open the door and take the tray with some small wontons from the helper.After eating the wontons, Lu Chengyu slowly brushed his teeth and washed his face. When the two lay on the bed, it was almost early in the morning.Since this was not the place where they usually lived, the two of them did not do discordant exercises that night. When they woke up the next morning, they were faced with a large table of hearty breakfast. In addition to the presence of Mr. Mu, there were also Mu\u2019s family\u2019s brothers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He said to the old man: \u201cGrandpa, I asked why you had the chef prepare such a rich breakfast today. It turned out to be because of hospitality.\u201dMr. Mu could tell that he was deliberately trying to figure his attitude our, but he deliberately didn\u2019t respond to him. He just gave a faint hmm, \u201cIsn\u2019t there you two brothers here, Qirong has a big appetite, isn\u2019t it normal to prepare more?\u201dIt seemed that the situation was not as optimistic as he thought? Mu Qihua raised his eyebrows, and saw Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu walking towards the dining table. After taking a closer look, a smile suddenly appeared on his face. He pretended to be so serious. As for himself, it turned out that he thought too much.When they woke up this morning, the clothes worn by the two of them were not the same set they wore yesterday. To say that this was not specially prepared by their grandfather, was impossible. Having done this step, it was tantamount to accepting that the two were together.\u201cGrandpa Mu is up early,\u201d after Lu Chengyu greeted him, he smiled and nodded to the Mu brothers, \u201cBrother Hua, Brother Rong, why are you here?\u201d\u201cWe live close to here. So, we just come over and eat meals when we are free,\u201d Mu Qihua asked with a smile after seeing Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu sitting across from him, \u201cDid you get accustomed to staying here last night?\u201d\u201cVery good,\u201d Lu Chengyu nodded with a smile and turned to see Elder Mu was ready to have breakfast, so he smiled at Mu Qihua and stopped talking. Although he himself didn\u2019t pay much attention to the rule of not talking about food at home, some older generations paid special attention to these rules. He didn\u2019t need to express his personality and add obstacles for the elderly. This was not called randomness; it was called disrespect for people.The helper served breakfast to the table of people. Lu Chengyu could see that these breakfast items were carefully prepared, even taking care of the tastes of young people, so some western flavors were specially prepared.Although Mr. Mu had read the various comments about Lu Chengyu in the investigation report, he had never met the real person. But after this meal, he somewhat agreed with the sentence in the report about him being \u201cGentle and polite\u201d, regardless of the nature of this person, at least he knew what to do in different occasions. There were not many who could really do this step, and even those of the self-proclaimed aristocratic family were not necessarily able to do what Lu Chengyu did so well.He probably understood why his grandson was attracted to such a young man. Such a person who was very good outside and very easy-going with people who were familiar with him was indeed a great attraction for a person with a personality like his grandson. As long as this person had a heart for an object, and this object was indeed a person worthy of attention, then it was too easy to like it.\u201cThank you for the hospitality, Grandpa Mu,\u201d Lu Chengyu reluctantly said when he left, \u201cThe chef you invited is really good. Can Brother Mu and I visit you often in the future?\u201d\u201cI think you kid are looking for me. Have you eaten your food?\u201d Father Mu laughed, glanced at Yan Mu next to Lu Chengyu, and said with a cheerful expression, \u201cOkay, you and Xiao Yan can come whenever you want. We don\u2019t lack a bowl of rice.\u201d\u201cGrandpa Mu. It\u2019s really okay, then we\u2019ll come often.\u201d Lu Chengyu accepted the sentence with a smile, and after saying goodbye to Mr. Mu, he and Yan Mu left the old house. He didn\u2019t really care about the food here, but he saw the old man\u2019s feelings for Yan Mu. As an old man, who wouldn\u2019t want the younger generation to come and see him, it was just that the old man was accustomed to his strong appearance, which made it easy for others to forget that he was an old man and not young anymore.\u201cYou get along well with Grandpa,\u201d Yan Mu cautiously started the car and drove off before saying, \u201cGrandpa likes you very much.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me, but because he likes you, he is working hard to accept my advantages, and then convince himself to accept that we two big men are together.\u201dYan Mu said after a moment of silence: \u201cThe thing grandpa regrets most in this life may be that he married my mother to Yan\u2019s family. He kept feeling guilty, but I never blamed him.\u201d\u201cThere are some things that need to be said. If you don\u2019t say them, others will never understand.\u201d Lu Chengyu understood Yan Mu\u2019s feelings and his character. \u201cWe will often come here for dinner.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d said Yan Mu and the corner of his mouth curled up, \u201cI\u2019ll find time to learn the chef\u2019s skills.\u201dLu Chengyu laughed, \u201cYou are stealing a job.\u201dYan Mu raised the corner of his mouth, watching Lu Chengyu smile, his heart warmed up like a hot water spring.\u201cWhat did you say about this child?\u201d Father Mu holding a watering can, to the side of the garden watering the flowers, he asked the guards behind him, \u201cI looked at him, he looks clear spirited, he is a good boy.\u201dBodyguard said with a smile: \u201cThe person you have seen, can there be a mistake?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong. Can this grandfather forcefully separate the two of them?\u201d Grandfather Mu put down the watering can and watched the sun set. He sighed and said, \u201cThat\u2019s good, at least Xiao Yan is a little bit more popular, if the two of them can live a stable life, it would be good. I am worried that the two of them will not be able to get along for a lifetime. The heart of the people is unpredictable. Xiao Lu is only in his twenties, what if he is attracted by a girl? If he suddenly wants to get married and have children, what should Xiao Yan do?\u201d\u201cSir, Xiao Yan has inherited your good foresight,\u201d The guard put the watering can aside, \u201cI think if Mr. Lu is such a person, Xiao Yan will look down on him.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWhen he heard this, the old man Mu looked at the guard and silently clicked and nodded, \u201cForget it, children and grandchildren have their own fates, and those who get married can get divorced. Why am I putting in so much effort?\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s position in the hearts of the company employees now was equal to that of the boss. People who originally liked to joke with him, had restrained themselves a lot. Although Lu Chengyu\u2019s attitude was the same as in the past, these people still restrained themselves. Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t force it, after all, in this society, some things can\u2019t be forced. But there was also an advantage, that is, when he handled work, he was more comfortable, no matter what these people thought behind his back, at least no one bothered him, so he saved a lot of trouble.Although the two newly hired assistants were not flexible enough to handle affairs, fortunately, they were safe and diligent. Lu Chengyu did not deliberately suppress the two of them. Whenever he could bring two of them, he would bring them along to teach them. After all, he sometimes needed to handle some of his own work, and these two people had to help Yan Mu handle some affairs. If there was no way to do things, it was better not to cheat his own family.The two assistants did not expect Lu Chengyu to be so amiable. After a few days of getting along with each other, he dared to let go off dealing with affairs. In his heart, they respected Lu Chengyu more and more. Even if Lu Chengyu was not in the company, they would not think other thoughts. On the contrary, they stood on Lu Chengyu\u2019s side from time to time, if there was any impure man or woman, both of them would pay more attention to it.Cao Jingshen sometimes joked about the two of them, saying that they were Lu Chengyu\u2019s second general, but in the end, he was run out by Lu Chengyu and couldn\u2019t say a word more. From then on, he understood that Lu Chengyu\u2019s mouth was a knife which could easily stab people.But he didn\u2019t know if it was his illusion. He felt that Lu Chengyu\u2019s mouth was particularly poisonous during the past two days, and he was also very ruthless when he was slaughtering people.It was not easy to ask directly, but seeing the boss and Lu Chengyu were the same as usual, he also let go of his heart, and did not inquire about it. Anyway, those two are parties were fine, why should the people near them be worried?In the office, Lu Chengyu looked at the pile of materials in his hand that had already been read, with a mocking smile on his face. He thought that the drama in the TV series were dog-blooded enough, but he did not expect that what happened to him was even worse than those dramas.His mother was the daughter of the Xia family in S City. She was abducted when she was young. The Xia family didn\u2019t even bother to find her because of a family disorder. When they wanted to find her, his mother was already married and had children, and she didn\u2019t need to recognize her ancestors or return to the clan. He thought it was just a big drama. Who knew that his father and Yan Mu\u2019s second uncle and Sheng Shaoyuan\u2019s uncle were college classmates, and Sheng Shaoyuan\u2019s uncle even pursued his mother. Back then, his father suddenly stopped working as a university teacher, not to make money, but because of the Xia family and Uncle Sheng.In the past two years, the Sheng family\u2019s struggle for family property caused a violent disturbance in City S. In the end, the Sheng family\u2019s uncle died in a car accident and eventually the inheritance rights fell to the Sheng family\u2019s elder son.According to the information, Uncle Sheng was preparing to meet his father on the day of the car accident. Who knew something happened on the way home. Since then, someone had tried to take his father\u2019s life, but because of the intervention of the second uncle of the Yan family, the other side was constrained. Who knew that his parents would die because of the unsafe operation of the Liang family?The Sheng family was second to none in S City, and they were also involved with several powers in the capital. The Xia family, who was originally on par with the Sheng family, had already withdrawn and now ranked below the Sheng family.If these things were related to the Sheng family, then why should the Sheng family act against him? Could it be that the Sheng family suspected that he knew a secret about the Sheng family?Lu Chengyu suddenly remembered that Sheng Shaoyuan had taken the initiative to get close to him during the bidding in City M. At that time, he only thought that the other party was deliberately approaching the Mu family behind Yan Mu. Looking back, the other party might be trying to guess whether he reacted to the Sheng family.But at that time, he had no interest in the Sheng family at all. Why did the Sheng family deal with him later? Could it be because\u2026 the ending of the Liang family made them vigilant?If these things were related to the Sheng family, then the reason for this matter was to \u201ccut the grass and eliminate the roots\u201d? The roots of his Lu family had been eradicated by them in the last life, but they would never be able to do this again in this life. No matter what the truth was, at least one thing was certain. Uncle Sheng\u2019s death had a problem. Maybe there was something important in Uncle Sheng\u2019s hands. Sheng Family had not been able to find it on Uncle Sheng that day, so his father became the object of their suspicion.After looking through all the information, Lu Chengyu drew a circle with a pen on the photo of Uncle Sheng\u2019s car accident, and on the road map he placed the coffee shop circle where the two had agreed to meet. The distance from the coffee shop to the accident site, was less than half an hour.If his father really had what the other party wanted, why couldn\u2019t these people get it back? Regardless of whether it was stealing or something else, it shouldn\u2019t be a big problem to deal with his father.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stuffed the information back into the portfolio and locked it in the drawer. \u201cPlease come in.\u201dIt was not someone else who came in, but Cao Jingshen, who was piled up with folders. He saw that there was not much on Lu Chengyu\u2019s desk, so he put all the folders on the desk, took the top file and said, \u201cDon\u2019t say I don\u2019t take care of you, this is your work.\u201dLu Chengyu silently glanced at the dusty folders, and looked at Cao Jingshen suspiciously: \u201cBrother Cao, are you making a fool out of me?\u201d\u201cAs the second boss, you said this in front of me. Don\u2019t you feel shameful?\u201d Cao Jingshen took out a document from the middle, patted the dust on it, and opened it to let Lu Chengyu see what was inside. \u201cThe boss specially asked me to send it, saying that it might be useful to you.\u201dLu Chengyu only then discovered that the folder was full of information about the Xia family and the Sheng family. He opened another folder, and it turned out to be some information about his parents\u2019 daily relationships. It was not easy to find out. He smiled gratefully to Cao Jingshen. \u201cThank you, Brother Cao.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d Cao Jingshen waved his hand. \u201cThis is all arranged by the boss. I just ran errands.\u201d He didn\u2019t know why Lu Chengyu and the boss wanted to investigate these things. But from a public or private perspective, he shouldn\u2019t ask too much, so seeing Lu Chengyu reading these documents, he quietly exited the office.When he came out to see the boss standing outside the door, Cao Jingshen was about to speak. Seeing the other party make a silence gesture, he closed his mouth and raised his eyebrows. Why were the two people making trouble?Following Yan Mu to the president\u2019s office, Cao Jingshen let out a sigh of relief: \u201cBoss, what are you doing, standing secretly outside the door is a bit scary.\u201d\u201cThis is the first time, I heard you talking so courageously,\u201d Yan Mu took out a document from the safe and hand it to him, \u201cI am planning to acquire Liang\u2019s in the near future. You can help me investigate all aspects of their data.\u201d\u201cDoes Xiao Lu know about this?\u201d Cao Jingshen took the document and hesitated. \u201cAlthough you bought the Liang family half for profit and half to vent Xiao Lu, this kind of method of breaking the Liang\u2019s is too old-fashioned. I\u2019m embarrassed to write this kind of plot in the novel now. Are you sure this would touch Xiao Lu?\u201dYan Mu glanced at him: \u201cYou think too much. You handle it.\u201d He glanced at the computer desktop that was open on the desk, \u201cDon\u2019t read too many such novels, it will affect your judgment.\u201dCao Jingshen shrugged, took the file out, and found that Lu Chengyu was just three steps away from him. Besides, he looked at the closed door behind him, then at Lu Chengyu, pointing behind him and saying: \u201cWant to go in?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Lu Chengyu glanced at the documents in Cao Jingshen\u2019s hand, turned around and said, \u201cI have some Liang\u2019s information in my hand, it might be useful. I will send it to your mailbox later.\u201dCao Jingshen was taken aback. Did Xiao Lu know the boss\u2019s intention?When Lu Chengyu saw Cao Jingshen staying silent, he smiled and raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cNo need?\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re welcome,\u201d Cao Jingshen knew that Lu Chengyu would not give him useless things, so he accepted it right away, and went to wait for him. After returning to his office, he was shocked when he saw the information that Lu Chengyu had passed to him.Where was this some information? This was a complete collection of Liang\u2019s information, and even many high-level private information was clearly stated, not to mention some of the illegal transactions by Liang\u2019s. This thorough investigation of a company as large as the Liang\u2019s was simply going against the sky. From this data, he could see that Xiao Lu was full of malice towards the Liang family.\u201cRepay virtue with virtue, return complaint with grievances,\u201d Cao Jingshen took a long time to read it roughly and sighed. Originally, the Liang\u2019s construction site safety measures were not in place, which caused the accidental death of Lu Chengyu\u2019s parents. Unexpectedly, the Liang\u2019s prince couldn\u2019t figure out that he had to get along with Lu Chengyu. You know that rabbits will bite people in a hurry, let alone Lu Chengyu, a cunning creature with unknown attributes?For someone like Lu Chengyu, he would rather be a friend than an enemy.\u201cChief Secretary, the afternoon meeting is about to begin,\u201d the assistant secretary knocked on the door of the office and said, standing at the door, \u201cSpecial Assistant Lu called just now to say that the meeting is to talk about the Liang family, please prepare.\u201d After the assistant left, Cao Jingshen closed the laptop silently. He now knew, why Lu Chengyu proactively provided him with information. He was waiting for him here.In the president\u2019s office, Lu Chengyu helped Yan Mu finish the data, sat on the sofa and looked at Yan Mu\u2019s serious work profile. When the meeting time was approaching, he suddenly said: \u201cLiang\u2019s reputation has declined too fast in the past year. If we propose a merger, many of Liang\u2019s shareholders and senior executives will probably not object. However, before proceeding with the merger, we must first make some speculation to affect the public opinion, which will be more beneficial to us in the future.\u201dYan Mu raised his head from the computer, startled at first. After a moment, then nodded: \u201cI\u2019ll listen to you.\u201dAlthough the other party was so calm, Lu Chengyu could still see that the other party was a little uncomfortable. He stepped forward and lay his hands on the table and said, \u201cI know what you wanted to do. Thank you.\u201dYan Mu stretched out his hand to pull the bow tie on his shirt collar uncomfortable, then he said with a serious face: \u201cBetween the two of us, there is no need to say this.\u201d\u201cWell, I was wrong,\u201d Lu Chengyu smiled and leaned over. He kissed him on the cheek, and before he could react, he smiled and said: \u201cThe time for the meeting is coming soon, let\u2019s go to the meeting room.\u201dYan Mu touched his cheek and nodded silently.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgIn the conference room, the senior executives looked at the information about the meeting content sent by Cao Jingshen in their hands, and each had a little doubt in their hearts. However, because of Yan Mu\u2019s authority in the company now, no one dared to complain directly. Sometimes some people were suspicious. But they would just whisper to inquire about the news from someone who has a better relationship with them.\u201cSecretary Cao, this acquisition of the Liang family\u2026\u201d\u201cRecently, the Liang family has become distracted and has long been unable to compete with Huading. If we take the opportunity to buy the Liang\u2019s, it will be equivalent to making Huading a well-deserved leading enterprise in Beijing. This is a rare good opportunity,\u201d Cao Jingshen knew of these people. He intended to take their objections away here, so he said, \u201cIf we wait for Liang\u2019s vitality to recover, it may not be easy to acquire it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, Secretary Cao, what you said makes sense,\u201d the inquiring person heard that the president seemed to have a strong desire to acquire Liang\u2019s, he immediately changed his tone. \u201cThis is indeed a rare good opportunity.\u201d Cao Jingshen echoed him with a smile, looked back at the open conference room door, and silently sighed inwardly. After a series of adjustments/teaching, Huading had long since had no ignorant people, but the taste of not having an opponent was really a little bit lonely.Three minutes before the start of the meeting, Yan Mu and Lu Chengyu appeared in front of everyone. Seeing the couple of husbands coming out, everyone who had been sitting stood up. Seeing this, Lu Chengyu hurriedly smiled and said, \u201cPlease sit down, sorry to keep everyone waiting for a long time.\u201dEveryone at the scene has learned how Lu Chengyu could handle company affairs quickly while smiling, so no one really regarded him as a soft persimmon. After hearing this, they all politely expressed that they came too early, and after Yan Mu sat down, they all sat down one after another.Yan Mu always didn\u2019t like to talk nonsense in front of everyone, so after the meeting started, he directly talked about some of his decisions, and then indulged in a friendly conversation with everyone, the whole meeting ended happily and harmoniously, and all the decisions Yan Mu proposed were passed.\u201cSince everyone has no problems, let people start preparing for these things as soon as possible,\u201d Yan Mu closed the document. \u201cDo you have any other questions?\u201dEveryone looked at each other and remained silent.\u201cThen the meeting will be over,\u201d Yan Mu stood up and glanced at the people, and said to Lu Chengyu beside him, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled at everyone and followed Yan Mu out of the conference room door.After Yan Mu left, the people who were still in the meeting room felt that the air was flowing again. Didn\u2019t they say that men in love were all fools? Why were the president and Lu Chengyu still so cool? They were not in line with the principles of love. They wanted to give a bad review!\u201cOh, do you still remember the incident that Prince Liang framed Lu Chengyu some time ago?\u201d A person asked, \u201cAfter the Liang family is acquired, then Prince Liang\u2026\u201d Everyone thought of it and looked at each other with a knowing look, and were so shocked that they swallowed everything and didn\u2019t finish speaking. After a few seconds passed, he said, \u201cHowever, the acquisition of the Liang family does have great benefits for us Huading. Now Sheng Rong is preparing to develop in the capital. If they pre-empted us, it would also have a great negative impact on our Huading.\u201dIn reality, there were so many companies like Liang\u2019s, if it was unprofitable to the company, it would be tantamount to taking the interests of the entire company as a joke. If this was the case, then sooner or later they would end up in bankruptcy.Everyone knew the most important significance of acquiring the Liang family, but talking about gossip on this matter still didn\u2019t affect them. As long as a person lived, regardless of gender, there was a god of gossip in their hearts.After leaving the meeting room, Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu went directly out of the company. As soon as Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu returned to the villa, they saw a few cars parked at the entrance of the villa. They looked very stylish.\u201cIs this not your second uncle\u2019s car?\u201d Lu Chengyu glanced at Yan Mu suspiciously, \u201cWhat is he doing here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74\u201cSir, Young Master Yan is back.\u201d The bodyguard saw Yan Mu\u2019s car approaching, he bent over to open the door, and whispered to the person in the car, \u201cMr. Lu is also in the car.\u201dYan Mu\u2019s second uncle was sitting in the car. He nodded, but didn\u2019t get out of the car. As an elder, he never learned to condescend. Even if Yan Mu had the power in the Yan family now, he would not let himself be a bit shortcharged because of this.Seeing this, He Long, who was driving behind him, hurriedly stopped and opened the door for Yan Mu, then silently retreated to the side. Lu Chengyu, who was watching this scene in silence, felt that this uncle and nephew pair had a lot in common at certain times, such as the personal habit of not losing their momentum.After Yan Mu stretched out a foot, the second \u00a0uncle Yan in the opposite car followed. This uncle and nephew pair walked out of the car almost at the same time, one with a villain smile, the other with a blank face, the scene looked like their relation was not harmonious at all.Lu Chengyu got out of the car and took a few steps forward and gestured to Second Uncle Yan, \u201cMr. Yan came to our humble house today. It is really brilliant. If you don\u2019t dislike it, please come in for a cup of tea.\u201dSecond Uncle Yan took the cigar in his hand, smiled lightly and asked the bodyguard beside him to light it, took a puff, and said, \u201cIt should be so, I will trouble my wise nephew today.\u201dLu Chengyu\u2019s eyebrows moved slightly, as if he did not hear what was wrong with Second Uncle Yan\u2019s tone but smiled and led Second Uncle Yan to walk into the home, \u201cMr. Yan is polite, please.\u201d He knew that Yan Mu was not close to the Yan family, but now people had come to the gate, the face and affection that should be shown must be in place. Yan Mu\u2019s present position was not suitable for this kind of good show, but he was very good for this kind of occasion.Seeing that Lu Chengyu had led Second Uncle Yan in, He Long glanced at Yan Mu beside him. Seeing that the boss did not show any dissatisfaction on his face, he lowered his head slightly and led the boss into the villa.Since Lu Chengyu was polite, Second Uncle Yan would naturally be acquiescent. Except for the bodyguard who always followed him, no one else followed in, and the feeling of bullying others was gone.After the five people entered the house, Second Uncle Yan flicked his cigar, and the smile on his face disappeared instantly: \u201cSince we have entered the door, we don\u2019t have to do a show. I heard that my nephew has been investigating my past for the past two days. Interesting, I don\u2019t know what good things have been found?\u201dSince the other party didn\u2019t want to act, Lu Chengyu would no longer maintain the mask. Hearing Second Uncle Yan mention that Yan Mu was investigating him, Lu Chengyu understood that it was probably the previous investigation into his father\u2019s behaviour which aroused the suspicion of Second Uncle Yan. He smiled and put a few cups of water on the coffee table, and then said, \u201cMr. Yan doesn\u2019t need to be so serious, it\u2019s better to sit down and drink a cup of tea.\u201dSecond Uncle Yan glanced at him and sat down, showing a face as if something was not in line with his own aesthetics, then picking up the teacup, he said: \u201cYou are stronger than your old man.\u201d\u201cMr. Yan, is this saying that I am better than your old friend?\u201d Lu Chengyu did not change his face because Second Uncle Yan mentioned his father. He went to the fruit basket. He chose a beautiful apple, picked up a silver fruit knife and slowly peeled the apple. The red peel was like an obedient thread, and the knife fell round after round, and the thickness of the peel was uniform. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that my father didn\u2019t mention his old friend to me, otherwise, as a junior, I would have visited you earlier.\u201d\u201cYour old man did not have as many means as you, and his means were also not as cruel as you,\u201d Second Uncle Yan watched Lu Chengyu slice the apple into several pieces, then put it on a plate and push it in front of him, he put the cigar out in the ashtray, reached out and took a bite with a silver stick. \u201cDoes this mind follow the old man of the Xia family?\u201dThis is equivalent to telling Lu Chengyu directly about his life experience. If Second Uncle Yan told him a month ago, he might be surprised, but in the current situation, Lu Chengyu was not affected much, and his words were indifferent: \u201cMaybe\u2026 I belong to a genetic mutation?\u201dHe Long standing in the corner twitched his mouth. How many people would admit that they were vicious in front of others? What\u2019s more, the boss is still here, Mr. Lu admitted so generously, and he is not worried about what the boss would think?At this moment, Yan Mu said: \u201cXiao Lu, I\u2019m going into the kitchen, you talk slowly.\u201dHe Long:\u2026Second Uncle Yan was slightly surprised to watch Yan Mu enter the kitchen very naturally, it seemed that he had been used to it a long time ago. So, he couldn\u2019t help but look at Lu Chengyu more. These two people\u2026Who is the stronger one? Did he unintentionally discover the truth?[1]Probably because the Second Uncle Yan\u2019s eyes were too obvious, Lu Chengyu asked with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t like eating apples?\u201d After speaking, he turned to the fragrant pear on the side, and the fruit knife in his hand was still in the palm of his hand.\u201cThe apple is pretty good,\u201d Second Uncle Yan put down the silver stick and wiped his mouth after eating the apple, \u201cI know what you want to investigate, but no matter what happened, the death of your parents has nothing to do with these people.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at Second Uncle Yan with a light smile, did not speak, as if he was going to let him continue.\u201cIt was true that the third son of the Sheng family had some thoughts about your mother back then, but things had passed so many years ago, how there could be so many women in the world who live and die no matter how beautiful they are. In terms of that, that\u2019s the case. Their Sheng family had never been infatuated.\u201d Second Uncle Yan sighed. \u201cWhen I saw your interview information in Huading, I knew that you would be severely affected by your ability. Yan Mu pays attention to you. Judging from the current situation, not only did I not guess wrong, but the relationship between you has exceeded my expectations.\u201dAt the beginning, he exhausted his thoughts to make Yan Mu have some impression of Lu Chengyu\u2019s interview materials, so as to deepen his impression. Lu Chengyu was favoured by Yan Mu, but he did not expect that Yan Mu valued Lu Chengyu more than he expected, and Lu Chengyu was more capable than he expected.Second Uncle Yan didn\u2019t know that after Yan Mu had an impression of Lu Chengyu\u2019s interview information, the two had an unexpected meeting at Baiweixuan, so Yan Mu not only had an impression of Lu Chengyu, but also had a good impression.The trajectory of life may just be a turn at a certain fork, and it will go in a different direction. Perhaps this can also be called destiny.Visit lightnovelreader.com for extra chapters.\u201cYou made Mu Ge have an impression of my interview materials because you want Mu Ge to use me?\u201d Lu Chengyu quickly figured out the mysteries inside, \u201cDis you want to protect me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a protection, I just want to do my friend a favour and save your life. If it weren\u2019t for you to come to Huading to apply for a job, maybe I wouldn\u2019t bother with it.\u201d Second Uncle Yan leaned on the back of the sofa leisurely. \u201cEven if the Sheng family is not afraid of the Yan family, they will be afraid of the Mu family anyway. In my expectation, as long as you become Yan Mu\u2019s right-hand man, he will definitely protect you.\u201d But he didn\u2019t expect that because of his rare casual kindness, his nephew would be confused by this kid.\u201cBut in fact, the Sheng family still acted against me, and even almost implicated Brother Mu,\u201d Lu Chengyu sighed, \u201cHowever, thank you for doing this for me.\u201d This kind of thinking that the other party is a villain, who knows that the other party is actually a villain. He was a hidden friend, and he had done a lot for him. This sour and refreshing feeling was indescribable.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for your calculation of the Liang family that made the Sheng family vigilant, the Sheng family would not have made such a big determination to take your life,\u201d said Second Uncle Yan with some interest, \u201cYou lucky kid. Fortunately, you happened to help the two most important members of the Mu family\u2019s younger generation. With this incident, the Mu family severely wounded the Sheng family\u2019s supporters in the capital, so that the Sheng family broke off their backers in the capital and it provoked the Sheng family\u2019s boss. I was mad and wanted to settle accounts with you. As a result, the Sheng family spent such a large amount of money, and you can still jump around in the capital alive and kicking. This luck is really the envy of ordinary people.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled when he heard the words: \u201cProbably my luck got better after I was with Mu Ge.\u201dSecond Uncle Yan turned around and saw Yan Mu just came out of the kitchen with things, and stood up lazily: \u201cNephew, I heard that he\u2019s good at sweet talk. It is easy for such men to recruit peach blossoms. If you find such a man to live your life, please be more mindful in the future.\u201dYan Mu turned a blind eye to his uncle\u2019s provocation, kept the mixed cold dishes on the table and said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t trust the other party you would treat these words as sweet words, trusting the other party you would treat these words as true words, it depends on just who is the listener.\u201dSecond Uncle Yan took a breath, then waved his hand: \u201cOkay, just ignore me, I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Even his nephew could talk so numbingly, what else could he say, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to have me for dinner, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d\u201cSecond Uncle Yan, go slowly\u201d, Lu Chengyu smiled and got up to see him off. \u201cWhen you have time, you should come more in the future.\u201dSecond Uncle Yan waved his hand immediately and left the door without saying anything. After his car drove out of Yan Mu\u2019s villa, the bodyguard beside him said, \u201cSir, why didn\u2019t you tell Mr. Lu about the rumours.\u201d\u201cThe rumours are things that have not been confirmed. For so many years, Mr. Sheng and Mr. Lu are no longer there. When it comes to this, why should I keep mentioning the old things?\u201d He looked back at the direction of the villa and sighed, \u201cThe Sheng family is attacking the Lu family boy, this rumour\u2026\u201dThe three parties were no longer there. Why should he make such an extra effort as an onlooker. Whether it\u2019s Mr. Sheng or Mr. Lu, since that kid already has a surname, what\u2019s the benefit of investigating the past?After dinner, Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu walked slowly in the community. Because it was already winter, Lu Chengyu felt that the wind was blowing on his face, and it was painful enough to cut into meat.\u201cUncle Yan\u2019s words\u2026how much do you think is true?\u201dYan Mu stretched out his hand to tidy up the scarf on Lu Chengyu\u2019s neck: \u201c90%, he may not lie to you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that something is hidden,\u201d Lu Chengyu exhaled in vain. \u201cEven if I used methods against the Liang family, it is not the biggest reason for the Sheng family to act against me.\u201dYan Mu remained silent. Perhaps this matter was not only concealed by Second Uncle Yan, but also in the information that Grandpa gave them. Something was concealed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75Yan Mu didn\u2019t say but Lu Chengyu could also guess, however the old man of the Mu family would not hide certain facts for no reason, unless these things were related to the Mu family or the truth behind it would be a blow to him. Elder Mu may not feel sorry for him, but he would be more cautious in his attitude towards him because of his strictness.After the two of them returned home after the walk, Lu Chengyu took Yan Mu to the room where they packed all kinds of miscellaneous things, looked through the box to find a few sets of albums that he had brought from the old house, and took them to the room to look through with Yan Mu.Because some photos were a bit old, and the camera technology was not as good as it was now, some photos did not look good. However, Yan Mu could still see from these photos that Lu Chengyu was very much loved by his parents, and he wore clean and beautiful clothes, and even toys in his hands were those that were fashionable at the time.Many of these photos had Lu Chengyu, and there were also photos of their family of three. Whoever looked at the photos of this family of three would feel that this family was very eye-catching. The male was elegant, the female was beautiful, and the child was very clean and cute. This was simply what everyone would think of when they thought of the perfect family in China.Lu Chengyu\u2019s looks were inherited more from his mother. His eyebrows and eyes were just a copy of his mother. His nose was a bit taller than his mother, and his mouth looked more heroic. This was different from his parents, but he had to admit that Lu Chengyu\u2019s looks were exceptional. He had inherited all the advantages of his mother and became a real handsome guy.Guessing why Lu Chengyu flipped through the album, Yan Mu sat beside him with his hand around Lu Chengyu\u2019s waist, watching him flip through, looking through each photo. Every photo was a proof of time he had spent with his parents. Lu Chengyu grew older in the photos, he grew from a doll crawling on the ground to a gentle and elegant teenager.\u201cThese all show my father and mother. In fact, my dad had a very good temper. He loved to spoil me since I was a child. My mom said that if it were some other child, he would have been spoiled rotten by my dad.\u201d Lu Chengyu looked at his father\u2019s photo in the album, \u201cNo matter how busy my parents were since childhood, as long as there were activities in my school, they would not miss it.\u201dAfter hearing Lu Chengyu talk about his childhood, Yan Mu felt that perhaps only a pair of parents who loved and cared about their children could raise a child with Lu Chengyu\u2019s personality. He had a good temperament, knew how to deal with others, was not cynical, and did not think that the world was beautiful everywhere.\u201cUncle and Auntie loved you very much. In their hearts, you must be the most important person,\u201d Yan Mu moved his hand and patted Lu Chengyu on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t be too sad, no matter what happens, I am still there.\u201dClosing the album, Lu Chengyu raised his head and smiled at Yan Mu, then kept the album aside, \u201cWhen I was young, the relatives of Lu family had a normal relationship with my parents, but they weren\u2019t very close to me. Why do you think this is? \u201cYan Mu was silent. He didn\u2019t know what Lu Chengyu had thought of, but the more he thought about the truth of some things, the more embarrassed he became.\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, go to bed,\u201d Lu Chengyu got up and placed the album in a conspicuous place. He turned his head and glanced at the two photo frames placed aside. One was his family portrait and the other was his and Yan Mu\u2019s photo. He looked at himself smiling in the two photos, then hooked his mouth and hugged Yan Mu, \u201cThese are things from the past, don\u2019t worry about me, even if someone says I\u2019m an alien\u2019s child now, as long as you don\u2019t dislike me, I will not be too sad.\u201dBecause blood relationship was only the source of birth, but family affection was cultivated by time. He was not a girl. He could distinguish what was true and important.Hearing Lu Chengyu\u2019s words, Yan Mu shook his head and kissed the corner of his mouth, \u201cWho you are has nothing to do with our feelings.\u201dLu Chengyu looked at him with a smile, and stroked his Adam\u2019s apple with his white fingers\u2026When two lovers are together, they are naturally connected to each other in the depths of their hearts, whispering silently to each other, I am in you, and you in me.When he went to work the next day, Yan Mu saw that Lu Chengyu did not show any negative emotions, so he was relieved, because the acquisition of the Liang family had already begun, and the workload of him and Lu Chengyu did not decrease but increased. Lu Chengyu raised the issue of the air purifier. Now that the patented product was being developed for the third time, it would be put on the market after it had been tried and tested without any problems.In addition, the two films that Lu Chengyu invested and filmed had already entered the mid-to-late stage, striving to be released during the Spring Festival, so as soon as they entered the company, the two entered the stage of intense work.After several accidental blows, the Liang\u2019s senior management had long been distracted. Now that Huading wanted to buy Liang family\u2019s company, there were several major shareholders who were interested, and some people even take the initiative to contact Lu Chengyu, who was the special assistant.However, because the Liang family was now messy and unpopular, Lu Chengyu had made good use of the mentality of these people to control 23% of the Liang family\u2019s shares at a very ideal price.For Huading, a holding of 23% was an ideal amount. They could attack and retreat as well as defend. Even if the Liang family was in trouble, Huading would not suffer too much loss. But 23% of the shares also had sufficient decision-making power.Lu Chengyu also felt that this share was enough for Huading. In fact, he had 19% to 20% of the shares in his budget, and 23% was already a little too much. However, he still secretly purchased 10% of Liang\u2019s shares in his own name. With Liang\u2019s current half-dead state, it was not difficult to buy 10% of the shares from other shareholders, Lu Chengyu was also willing to spend the money to play with the Liang family.He didn\u2019t know if it was because some time ago, when the parties were investigating the plane crash, it was found that there were a few suspicious persons on the plane, so the people who were originally targeting Lu Chengyu had backed off during this time. Also, Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu had been busy for more than a month dealing with the Liang family\u2019s affairs, they were almost done.It took at least half a year to prepare for a general acquisition in the industry, but now because Huading strictly controlled the main decision-making power, and the Liang family was messy, it could be handled so quickly, which was quite eye-catching in the industry.More importantly, many people in the industry were not optimistic about Huading\u2019s acquisition of Liang\u2019s, but since Huading\u2019s share was very sensible, no one said that Yan Mu was annoyed at the Liangs, but a few well-informed people inquired about it. When Huading decided to put Lu Chengyu in charge of the various decision-making work of the Liang family, it was then that Liang Deyou who bullied others six months ago, wanted to give face everywhere.Visit lightnovelreader[.]com for extra chapters.Because Liang Deyou was incompetent at work and wanted to maintain a luxurious life, he sold a lot of shares in his hands. Now he only had 26% of the shares left in his hands. Now the largest shareholder of the Liang family was Liang Deyu followed by Liang Deyou. Liang Deyu, who owned 28%, had a normal relationship with Liang Deyou, and the two cousins were making a fuss for their rights in the company. Today, 23% of Huading\u2019s shares, plus 10% of Lu Chengyu\u2019s shares, made Lu Chengyu almost the highest controlling shareholder of the Liang family.At the end of the year, it was the busiest time for major companies. The employees of the Liang family were even more upset, because the Liang family was currently in a recession and many people had been laid off. Now Huading was involved in the Liang family and they did not know what new policies would emerge. The general meeting of shareholders was about to be held. The representative of Huading had not arrived yet, and it was not known whether the layoffs would continue.Liang Deyu was standing at the gate of the company in a neat suit, looking outside with a serious expression, waiting for the arrival of the Huading representative. He was not stupid, knowing that if he wanted to truly become the head of the Liang family in the future, he needed the support of other shareholders. It had long been heard that Huading\u2019s CEO\u2019s boyfriend had conflicts with Liang Deyou. Of course, he had to seize this opportunity to boost himself and let himself step on Liang Deyou.\u201cIf you can\u2019t get on the countertop, you can\u2019t get on the countertop.\u201d After Liang Deyou got off the car, seeing Liang Deyu with a team of employees waiting for Huading representatives at the door, he sneered, \u201cDo you think that you can step on me by pleasing Huading? Don\u2019t forget, who is the founder of this company, you ungrateful bastard!\u201d\u201cWhat does cousin mean? I just want the new shareholders to support our future work more. What did you think about?\u201d Liang Deyu didn\u2019t seem to have any complicated thoughts. Hearing Liang Deyou\u2019s wicked language, he eagerly persuaded him, \u201cDeyou, I know that you used to have an unpleasant relationship with the boyfriend of the president of Huading, but now the company has become like this. Even if it\u2019s for the sake of the company, you can bear it, don\u2019t make trouble with the representative of Huading.\u201dThe employees around looked sympathetically at Liang Deyu who was humbling himself for the company\u2019s sake and hated Liang Deyou for not being able to support the wall with mud, but they were all working for other people. How could they make irresponsible remarks?Liang Deyou was blocked by Liang Deyu\u2019s words. How could he not hear that Liang Deyu was just pretending to be a good person in front of the staff, but now if he made trouble again, it would only make other people misunderstand him even more. He took a deep breath and suppressed his anger forcibly.Upon seeing this, Liang Deyu glanced at him with satisfaction, but there was a hint of sarcasm at the corner of his mouth.Ten minutes before the start of the meeting, a black Bentley drove towards the door of the company, followed by a few black BMW\u2019s. The people waiting at the door lifted their spirits and knew that this was the representative of Huading.The Bentley stopped at the gate of the company, and then everyone saw the doors of several BMW cars behind opened. In these cars were assistants, bodyguards, and secretaries.The bodyguard in a black suit ignored the people waiting at the door, walked to the front of the Bentley, bent and opened the door, \u201cMr. Lu is here.\u201dThen everyone saw a clean brown leather shoe sticking out of the car. After coming out, there were grey trousers, and the moment the slender legs stepped out of the car door, the girls among the staff opened their eyes. Men with such long legs were usually handsome guys.Among everyone\u2019s attention, a young man in a grey suit with a smiling mouth came out of the car. He stepped onto the steps, smiled at the people waiting at the door, and politely nodded: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, to make everyone wait for a long time. There was traffic jam on the road.\u201dEveryone at the scene recognized who the person was. Some female employees found him so handsome that they couldn\u2019t even take a breath, and some managers looked at Liang Deyou worriedly, worried that he would make the representative unhappy.And Liang Deyou had probably the ugliest face among all of them. He looked at Lu Chengyu, who was surrounded by a group of bodyguard, assistants and secretaries, and the contemptuous and mocking smile that Lu Chengyu directed at him when he was at the police station reappeared in his mind.How could it be him? !Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 76Lu Chengyu\u2019s performance was beyond everyone\u2019s expectations. Just when everyone thought he would take the opportunity to make things difficult for him, he greeted several key personnel with a gentle smile, and shook hands with the leader Liang Deyu: \u201cI should have been early today. When I went out, the company had something to deal with right away, and there was a traffic jam on the road. I\u2019m really sorry to keep you waiting for a long time.\u201d\u201cMr. Lu is too serious. We came too early, please,\u201d Liang Deyu saw that Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t seem to be bothered with Liang Deyou. He was relieved and understood the meaning of overturning the boat with one pole. In addition, Lu Chengyu had a calm attitude, outstanding appearance, and courteous manner. Thinking of the rumours in the market, he was more cautious, and even personally led people into the elevator for high-level management.\u201cMr. Lu\u2019s ability to come to the meeting in person really makes the Liang family honoured.\u201d Lu Chengyu glanced at the few people who came in behind Liang Deyu. They should all be the senior management of the Liang family. It was clear that Liang Deyou was the direct heir of the Liang family. It was a pity that these people mostly looked at Liang Deyu\u2019s face, which was really interesting.\u201cManager Liang is too self-effacing. It is my honour to be a representative of Huading to the Liang family to discuss business affairs with everyone.\u201d Lu Chengyu saw the elevator stop and made a please gesture to Liang Deyu, but Liang Deyu asked him to go out first even more politely. Then, he explained some of Liang\u2019s situation while walking. When the group reached the meeting room, all the shareholders and senior management were all there.Lu Chengyu glanced at the seat specifically vacated for him by Liang\u2019s, and sat down with a smile. The assistant behind him put the notebook in front of him in time, and the other assistant put down the organized files and sat silently. Then they waited for the meeting to start at any time so that they could take the meeting minutes.Everyone in the conference room smiled when they saw Lu Chengyu, but silently lit a candle for Liang Deyou. Everyone here knew that Lu Chengyu owned part of the Liang family\u2019s shares, and he was also the representative of Huading. Putting this dual identity together, he was really a big Buddha.The incident between Liang Deyou and Lu Chengyu was known all over the country. Afterwards, their Liang family fell into a situation where everyone was clamouring and beating, and their reputation plummeted. Now Lu Chengyu, who had been humiliated by the Liang family and their son, had become a representative of Huading. He had the ability to speak, and there was a strict backing behind him. Liang Deyou, who couldn\u2019t support the wall, was nothing in front of him.Liang Deyu wanted to give Lu Chengyu face, so before the meeting started, he gave a solemn introduction to Lu Chengyu, and the meeting officially started after everyone applauded and welcomed Lu Chengyu\u2019s arrival.The content of the meeting sounded a bit boring. What Huading wanted to know, the relevant departments had already handed in the information long ago. Now that these people were rushing for some unimportant handover content, the two brothers of the Liang family couldn\u2019t suppress it. In the end, Lu Chengyu felt that this kind of scene was a bit pitiful and funny. No wonder the Liang clan had become so shameful, and the company\u2019s internal situation was like this. It would be strange if it wasn\u2019t such a shame.After these people had almost quarrelled, Lu Chengyu yelled: \u201cCalm down, everyone, things have not reached this point. The layoffs can be put on hold. I have seen the list of layoffs. These salespeople are rare talents. They have a lot of credit in Liangs. Instead of using layoffs to help the Liang survive the crisis, it is better to think about how to improve the Liang\u2019s internal situation and let Liangs regain a foothold in the market.\u201dThe original noisy scene calmed down, a few seconds later, only one person said: \u201cMr. Lu it is easy to say, but now the Liang family has already been precarious, do we have to raise these people without layoffs?\u201d He actually wanted to say one more thing, if it weren\u2019t for your Huading pitting the Liang family from behind, where would they need to take such drastic measures? At this point, it was only because of Lu Chengyu\u2019s current identity that he did not dare to say this sentence.Lu Chengyu glanced at this person, and had some impression of this person, and it was Liang Deyou\u2019s uncle or someone with average ability, but he was very protective of his nephew Liang Deyou.\u201cYou also make a lot of sense, but these people are indeed capable people. If even these people are fired, who will the Liang family rely on to help develop?\u201d Lu Chengyu looked around at the crowd, \u201cDoes it depend on you people? How many of you can support such a big Liang family?\u201d\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you to use tricks behind our back, how could our Liang family fall to this point?\u201d Liang Deyou, who had been silent at this time, couldn\u2019t help but yell at Lu Chengyu at this time.Lu Chengyu didn\u2019t get angry when he heard Liang Deyou\u2019s yelling. Instead, he slowly took a sip of the coffee at hand, and then glanced at the information on the computer page. After Liang Deyou\u2019s face became uglier, he said, \u201cWhat happened to the Liang family before was that some shortcomings were discovered. What is it to do with me? Besides, what is the status of the Liang family in the capital, who am I, and what ability do I have to calculate Liangs? I don\u2019t dare to wear this hat given by Young Master Liang.\u201d Liang Deyou was so dizzy with Lu Chengyu\u2019s lazy attitude, he swept the coffee cup beside him on the floor, got up and rushed out of the meeting room and slammed the door.Visit lightnovelreader[.]com for extra chapters.Because of his abrupt behaviour, the entire conference room became deathly silent. Not to mention how much the previous things had to do with Lu Chengyu, even if those things had something to do with Lu Chengyu, it would be considered as them being inferior in skill. If you were scammed, you could only admit that you were unlucky. When Liang Deyou took the initiative to provoke others, he should have thought of the possibility of others fighting back. Could it be that the whole world was his father and mother, and let him do anything no matter what?Now the Liang family was no longer his prince\u2019s world. At this time, he didn\u2019t want to protect his father\u2019s property. Instead, he lost his temper. No wonder he was worse than Lu Chengyu.\u201cMr. Lu, my cousin has a weird temper. He likes to lose his temper inexplicably. Please don\u2019t mind.\u201d Liang Deyu saw the atmosphere freeze and stepped forward to ease the atmosphere. \u201cThe meeting continues.\u201dLu Chengyu smiled but it was not really a smile. He glanced at Liang Deyu and nodded.When everyone saw this, they breathed a sigh of relief, deliberately forgetting about Liang Deyou\u2019s madness, and continued to talk about the company.It was Liang Deyu who was in the best mood to see this kind of thing happen. He was eager for Liang Deyou to die. After all, the more the other party does such things, the better it would be for him. From now on, the whole Liang family would know how much Liang Deyou had pitted the entire company. Who would support him at that time?Lu Chengyu knew Liang Deyu\u2019s thoughts, but he didn\u2019t bother to take care of them. He and Liang Deyou\u2019s accounts were almost cleared. Now he was a businessman, and his emphasis was on profit. From the perspective of interests, Liang Deyu\u2019s care was indeed better than Liang Deyou\u2019s. At least this one had a brain and knew current affairs.Without Liang Deyou\u2019s involvement, the entire meeting went smoothly. When Lu Chengyu left, Liang Deyu personally escorted him to the car. Then in the afternoon, the incident about Lu Chengyu\u2019s face being shaken by Liang Deyou for disapproving of layoffs spread throughout the Liang family. Many Liang employees were even more dissatisfied with Liang Deyou.Back to Huading, Lu Chengyu organized the meeting process and meeting results into documents and handed them to Yan Mu. He was very satisfied with the results of the meeting. The cooperation between Huading and Liang Deyu was doable. As for who the original owner of the Liang family was and what relation he had with him, did it matter?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/More Than A Few BlessingsChapter 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77After Liang\u2019s shareholder meeting, although there were no layoffs, the company knew that due to Huading\u2019s intervention, there may be some changes in the middle and senior management positions after the year, and Liang Deyu also took the opportunity to buy people\u2019s hearts at this time, which meant that Liang Deyou was left empty handed.Outsiders also guessed that there would be actions inside the Liang family, and some people were filled with emotion thinking that Lu Chengyu had means of killing people without seeing blood. Unfortunately, no one dared to say such things in public. They didn\u2019t dare to go against Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu. They had been together for several months, and no one in the Yan family and the Mu family had come forward to say anything against it, was this method comparable to ordinary people? Liang Deyou offended such a person, so, he deserved to be unlucky.Shengrong Group\u2019s plan to enter the capital market was not going smooth. In addition, it coincided with the Spring Festival, so the plan had to be moved further, which gave Huading more time for preparation.When everyone was free to prepare for the Chinese New Year during the Spring Festival holiday, Lu Chengyu became busy, mainly because \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d and \u201cThe Universe\u201d would be released during the Spring Festival, and the two film crews had also signed up for the Golden Bird Award, the highest domestic film award. As for whether they could be shortlisted, it depended on the taste of the judges this year.As an investor in \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d and one of the many supporting roles in \u201cThe Universe\u201d, Lu Chengyu was not interested in winning the award. What he cared most about was the box office of \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d, and he even participated in the promotion of these two films. Several press conferences were held for the promotion.The theme of \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d was not favourable to the taste of young people nowadays, although it was mixed with a little black humour, it was more about the discussion of human nature and the interpretation of the people\u2019s life in the background of that era and the contradictions between different classes.From a connotation point of view, \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d was more thoughtful than the previous \u201cFlying Bird\u201d, and his investment was also stronger than the previous one. However, Lu Chengyu did not have much hope for the box office of this movie. Instead, he expected that it had already been shot almost.But anyway, in \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d there was his cameo appearance. Lu Chengyu did not save on publicity funds, so he did what he should do, which gave Zhang Shuo enough face as the director.In order to avoid the limelight of \u201cThe Universe\u201d, \u201cAutumn Wind\u201d was released three days ahead of schedule. Many industry insiders and reporters came to the premiere. Before the film was officially released, the reporters took the opportunity to ask a lot of questions.\u201cMr. Lu, I heard that this movie is not a mainstream movie, director even said you don\u2019t expect the movie box office to be too high, then as an investor, why did you invest in this movie?\u201d\u201cMovie should be colourful flowers. If there is lightness, there will be heavy bias. If all movies are the same, then it is not a good thing for the film industry.\u201d Lu Chengyu sat in a chair, facing the many long shots and short shots. Then he smiled and said, \u201cI am not a person who knows art, but I hope people who know art can make interesting movies.\u201d\u201cIn your eyes, is Zhang Dao your Maxima?\u201dLu Chengyu heard this adjective. Looking at Zhang Dao, Lu Chengyu answered this question after the two laughed in unison: \u201cI hope Zhang Dao and I are Boya and Ziqi[1]. But I am worried that Zhang Dao dislikes me as a bull who doesn\u2019t understand art.\u201dThe reporters at the scene were amused by Lu Chengyu\u2019s relaxed remarks. The host took the opportunity to interject and stir up the atmosphere at the scene. Just as the interview was about to go, a young reporter suddenly said, \u201cMr. Lu, today is the twenty-sixth day of the twelfth lunar month, it would be the Spring Festival in four days. How would you and Mr. Yan celebrate the Spring Festival?\u201dOn the surface, this was to ask how Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu would celebrate the Spring Festival, but in fact he was asking if Lu Chengyu could go to Yan or Mu family home for the New Year\u2019s Eve reunion dinner, this also had the connotation of whether Lu Chengyu being the male partner of Yan Mu had been accepted by the Yan or the Mu family\u2019s elders, especially the well-established Mu family.The atmosphere on the scene became a little stiff with this issue being brought up. After all, this issue might also involve the Mu family. These little reporters dared not offend such a big family. When the time came, their jobs would not be guaranteed, they were afraid that they would get into even bigger trouble.\u201cI knew that some people would gossip about these issues today,\u201d Lu Chengyu raised his eyebrows and said with a smile. \u201cUnfortunately, we probably won\u2019t go out to play during the Spring Festival, and I don\u2019t want our journalist friends to follow us to take pictures during the New Year. We would probably just cook a table at home and watch the Spring Festival Gala.\u201dThis statement revealed at least one meaning. The president of Huading was going to spend the Spring Festival with Lu Chengyu. As for whether the Mu family accepted Lu Chengyu, they couldn\u2019t tell from these words. But at least one thing was certain, that is, Yan Mu was absolutely truly in love with Lu Chengyu. Otherwise, why would such an important festival be spent with Lu Chengyu instead of going to Yan or Mu family home.The reporter saw that Lu Chengyu did not have a black face and knew that he had gone too far with this question, so he was embarrassed to ask any more. Everyone present was relieved because of Lu Chengyu\u2019s attitude. If it was an ordinary artist, they would be fine even if they make things difficult for them, but Lu Chengyu\u2019s identity was different, and they were really worried about offending him.Just when the film officially started screening, because the lights were turned off, and the two rows before it had only crew members, no one noticed that there was an extra person beside Lu Chengyu, and this person was the President Yan of Huading.At the beginning of the film, there were some shabby chastity archways and not-so-wide dirt trails. As soon as the wind blew, countless yellow leaves were raised in the wind. Then there came the name list of crew members. Lu Chengyu\u2019s name appeared twice, one was in production and the other was at the end as a cameo appearance.The lighting angle of the film was very particular, and the mood of the whole film could be inferred from the lighting. Then the viewers found that the film was not as jerky and difficult to understand as they imagined. The acting skills of the actors were also in place, and the editing was not chaotic. It was also relatively sophisticated and could be regarded as a work of conscience.The people in the small town were old-fashioned but simple and kind. They had a pitiful and sad side, but they also had a lovely and respectable side. People with different personalities under the lens formed a real world together.Because of Zhang Shuo\u2019s sudden fame, many people attended the premiere with the mentality of seeing how a shooting star dimmed, but halfway through the movie, they gradually admitted that Zhang Shuo was indeed a very talented director.The character played by Lu Chengyu was just one of several supporting roles. The previous few shots of him were elegant and handsome but unpleasant, however at the end he died in a mudslide with only one arm in order to save a child, while he himself was infected.The role of Lu Chengyu was intended to tell the audience a truth, that is, there are no perfect people in the world, and some annoying people may not necessarily be really bad people.Those fans who rushed to see Lu Chengyu in the movie had already reddened their eyes when they saw this, which showed that they had been integrated into the plot.Visit lightnovelreader[.]com for extra chapters.Yan Mu squeezed Lu Chengyu\u2019s hand, tilted his head to watch Lu Chengyu for a while before continuing to watch the movie. At this time, the scene of Lu Chengyu\u2019s death had passed.Lu Chengyu scratched the palm of his hand when he saw it, and whispered in his ear: \u201cI was shooting in a mud puddle at the time. I didn\u2019t expect that after the computer special effects came out, it would have such a sense of picture.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Yan Mu was holding his hand, the corners of his closed lips relaxed a little.Lu Chengyu smiled silently. Yan Mu was also there when he finished shooting this set of shots, but when he saw the scenes in the movie, Yan Mu was still affected.After the film premiere, most film critics gave the film a good rating. To Lu Chengyu\u2019s surprise, although the box office of this film was not as scary as the previous one, it was also much higher than he expected. He recovered the cost, which was also a pleasant surprise. He originally had a loss-making mentality and never thought of making money.What surprised Lu Chengyu was that his role received a lot of admiration. Many film critics said that he had brought the character alive, and him not being a full-time artist was a big loss for the circle. People liked to listen to compliments. Although Lu Chengyu was not thinking about acting, he was still happy to see these remarks and praise from fans.Two days later, while everyone was still discussing how the major films would fight during the Spring Festival, a TV station\u2019s entertainment program broke another shocking news, that is, at noon on the 28th of the twelfth lunar month, someone photographed Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu going into the Mu family old house entrance together.A well-informed person revealed that on the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month, the Mu family had a reunion dinner in advance, and that the juniors in the family returned to the old house for dinner at noon that day, so what did Lu Chengyu\u2019s entry at Mu family mean?It meant that the old man of the Mu family had accepted Lu Chengyu!Just when many people doubted the authenticity of this report, Yan Mu, who rarely posted on Weibo, posted a simple but shocking Weibo.Yan Mu: Grandpa\u2019s chef\u2019s cooking skills are getting better and better. Someone\u2019s uncontrolled eating behaviour does not encourage others to learn.Who else was someone mentioned in Weibo?!In less than an hour, the number of reposts on this Weibo exceeded 5,000. Almost all netizens only wrote the word \u201cblessings\u201d when reposting. Occasionally, someone ridiculed them, but they were scolded by others to the extent that they didn\u2019t dare to appear again.Many people said that they believed in true love again. Soon fans pushed a hot topic on Weibo called \u201cYou must be happy, male god\u201d. Some people posted a photo of Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu. Various entertainment reports about the two of them were released, but no matter what the content was, they were all released with a blessing mentality, so Lu Chengyu who was blogging on Weibo was moved.More than every year: Thank you for your blessings, and I wish everyone happiness, and a Happy Chinese New Year. [Picture: A photo with ten fingers interlocking]Because Lu Chengyu and Yan Mu usually didn\u2019t show their affection on Weibo, when Lu Chengyu\u2019s Weibo was published, many people said something like \u201cDead by candy\u201d. And during the Spring Festival, no one said jokes like 'show points fast\u201d and the atmosphere was too good.Some people in the media sighed that the atmosphere was so good that it was unscientific. When two big men came out, shouldn\u2019t there be a lot of people who came out to scold them? How come most of them came for blessings?Probably because the news on the twenty-eighth day was too hot, so when Lu Chengyu appeared on the red carpet at the grand premiere of \u201cThe Universe\u201d on the 29th, he murdered a lot of film, if not for the extraordinary status of the crew of \u201cThe Universe\u201d, I am afraid that Lu Chengyu would have been surrounded by crazy reporters at this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
