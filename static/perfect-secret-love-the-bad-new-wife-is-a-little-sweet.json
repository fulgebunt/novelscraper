His ghostly, bloodthirsty expression clouded and his ice-cold lips bit down on her ruthlessly, as if wanting to swallow her whole.Ye Wan Wan was in such pain that she couldn\u2019t think straight. She muttered subconsciously, \u201cWhy\u2026 Why me\u2026 Si Ye Han\u2026 Why must it be me\u2026?\u201d\u201cBecause it has to be you.\u201dHearing his deep and hoarse voice was like a shackle of chains that imprisoned her soul.Upon hearing the same answer he\u2019d given her in her previous life, Ye Wan Wan fell into a coma.\u2026When she opened her eyes again, the darkness of the night sky had turned into daylight.A floral scent filled the air and the warm glow of the sun filtered in, momentarily dissipating her uneasiness.Yet, in the next second, Ye Wan Wan tensed up again.A strong sense of distress spread in her as the man awakened.His arm around her waist tightened. She was akin to a pillow, being held in his arms.\u201cStill leaving?\u201dNext to her ears whispered the voice that gave her the creeps.Out of her survival instincts, Ye Wan Wan shook her head.She was unsure whether he believed her. He glanced at her for a moment and then looked down, giving her little kisses on her lips, chin and neck\u2026The heavy, hot breath buried in her neck gave her warning signs all over her body.She was like a deer who\u2019d been bitten by a predator. She didn\u2019t dare move an inch.After what seemed like forever, he finally let her loose.In the next second, a surprisingly pleasant sight fell into Ye Wan Wan\u2019s view.He left the bed half-naked, the backlight outlining his slender stature and tapered waist.However, this view lasted only for a moment as he swiftly picked up his clothes by the bed and buttoned his shirt all the way to the top meticulously.It was only a while ago that he\u2019d been as ferocious as a beast, but in this moment, his handsome face was cold without a trace of humanity.It wasn\u2019t until she heard the sound of the door shutting that Ye Wan Wan allowed her nerves to relax.She could finally reflect on her current situation.She slowly glanced at the furnishings around her, and also at her own reflection in the vanity mirror opposite.The black lips of the girl in the mirror had been gnawed at till there was only a faint colour left and the makeup on her face had been completely smeared by tears and sweat. On her body filled with bruises and hickeys was a horrific and bloody tattoo.She couldn\u2019t believe this was how she looked at only 20 years old!At that time, in order to distance herself from Si Ye Han, she purposely made herself look ugly and disgusting.Now she\u2019d actually been\u2026 reborn\u2026Suddenly, an overwhelming sense of fear and despair caused her to choke.Why.. .Why have I returned to 7 years in the past?!I\u2019d rather die than return here, back by this devil\u2019s side.She clearly remembered that this was where she and Si Ye Han first had sex, and she\u2019d been tormented thoroughly for countless nights afterwards.She\u2019d lost her lover, her family, even her dignity and freedom. She\u2019d lost everything.Must I go through all of it again?No. Since God\u2019s given me a chance to live again, I have to change it all!\\nNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

He got whatever he wanted.Ye Wanwan took a deep breath, forcing the fear of that man out of her.There must be a way!At least she was no longer the same stupid, mindless and impulsive teenager.\u201cOh my god! Wanwan\u2026\u201d She heard a sudden exclamation.Hearing this familiar voice, Ye Wanwan stiffened and turned to look at the door.Immediately, she saw the face of a person she\u2019d never forget.A pretty face that people would never suspect\u2014It was her best friend from her previous life!\u201cWanwan, how could Mr. Si do this to you?!\u201d Shen Mengqi rushed over and held her hand. She looked at the messy bed and Wanwan\u2019s bruised body in astonishment.Ye Wanwan lowered her eyes, looking at her hand clenched in pain from Shen Mengqi\u2019s tight grip. This time, she didn\u2019t miss Shen Mengqi\u2019s clumsily hidden feelings of jealousy.\u201cWanwan, are you alright? Are you okay? Wanwan, don\u2019t scare me!\u201d Shen Mengqi fretted anxiously. She saw that Wanwan\u2019s gaze was strange and wondered if she was traumatized.Ye Wanwan maintained her composure and drew her hands back. She shook her head and replied, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dIn her past life, the reason why she\u2019d been tormented so relentlessly by Si Yehan was due in part to Shen Mengqi.She had many fights with Si Yehan and didn\u2019t dare tell anyone other than Shen Mengqi, her most trusted friend. Who would\u2019ve known\u2026Shen Mengqi actually had feelings for Si Yehan; she long coveted the title of \u201cMrs Si\u201d. On the surface, she was helping Wanwan, but she was actually using her to get closer to Si Yehan. She even tried to drive a wedge between them countless times and led Wanwan to be tortured by the wrath of Si Yehan each time.Wanwan hadn\u2019t noticed her level of deception before. She even felt deeply grateful to Shen Mengqi for being her wing woman.Staring at her own reflection in the mirror, Ye Wanwan couldn\u2019t help but smile wryly.Actually, this hideous disguise was Shen Mengqi\u2019s idea, and she actually agreed.No matter how others saw her, as long as Si Yehan loathed her, it\u2019d be worth it.But what she hadn\u2019t anticipated was that despite her revolting appearance, Si Yehan could tolerate all of it.\u201cHow are alright when you look like this?! Wanwan, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll help you!\u201d Shen Mengqi said, with a look of kindness.Ye Wanwan sneered in her heart. Oh, sure.The Shen Mengqi from her previous life had also been like this, generously offering to help her escape and asking for Gu Yueze\u2019s help.In the end, Shen Mengqi betrayed her and told Si Yehan that she was \u201celoping\u201d with Gu Yueze.This had intensified her conflict with Si Yehan. From that point onwards, Si Yehan\u2019s temperament became cranky and unpredictable. His possessiveness towards her became intolerable.Facing Si Yehan head-on was like courting death.Why had she been so foolishly stubborn before? She\u2019d even listened to Shen Mengqi and obeyed her, hurting herself again and again.The Ye family hadn\u2019t exacted their revenge yet. Her parents were still waiting for her at home and she still had to guide her older brother onto the right path. She had so much to do.She needed to pacify Si Yehan first; she couldn\u2019t do anything that would provoke him again. She set herself up against a terrifying enemy.\u201cWanwan, wait for me! I\u2019ll come back for you!\u201d Shen Mengqi, only caring for herself, spoke words devoid of meaning. She then left.Once Shen Mengqi left, Ye Wanwan\u2019s helpless and fragile expression turned cold and numb.Shen Mengqi\u2019s countless attempts to encourage her to escape hadn\u2019t succeeded. The last time, she was accused of having an affair. It was like Shen Mengqi was determined to the death to ruin her life.So let\u2019s find out\u2026Who will die this time.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For three whole days, he didn\u2019t appear at all. The servants at the house were all buried in their work and rarely spoke to her. They didn\u2019t even dare to make any eye contact.Such an enormous house but it was like a crypt.Ye Wan Wan changed into her pyjamas and looked at the time. She immediately walked towards the yard.The moonlight was beautiful with a gentle breeze, easing her fear of the terrifying memories of the cage she was trapped in.This garden actually had a nice view. After all, it had been designed by Si Ye Han himself. He hired the world\u2019s top group of architects and it took five full years to finish building it in the top location in Imperial City.It was such a pity that in her previous life, she hadn\u2019t appreciated it. She abhorred this cage that imprisoned her and only wanted to destroy it.In plain sight, she could see a large, burnt patch of grass, an intentionally cut flowerbed and a murky pond\u2026 these were all her \u201cmasterpieces\u201d.\u201cWan Wan\u2014\u2014\u201dThen, a familiar voice abruptly resounded in the evening wind.Ye Wan Wan looked up from a withered rose in the direction of the voice.Under the dim light, she could see a man dressed in an expensive and luxurious suit. He was charming and\u2026 classy.She had to admit, Gu Yue Ze did in fact captivate her.Si Ye Han, that devil, paled in comparison with him.Gu Yue Ze stood a few steps away from her and frowned.Ye Wan Wan noticed his subtle reaction, so she took a look at her clothes.At that moment, she was still in her heavy metal clothes, with a thick mess of makeup on her face.As her wardrobe didn\u2019t have any regular clothes, she thought she might as well maintain her old image. She also didn\u2019t want to arouse suspicion by changing drastically in such a short period of time.Gu Yue Ze stared at her coldly, his expression filled with disappointment, \u201cWan Wan! How could you degrade yourself like this?\u201dDegrade myself?Ye Wan Wan tasted these words, mocking her.In her previous life, she\u2019d given him her entire heart. In order to prove her loyalty to him, she\u2019d made herself dress so strangely and repulsively.But in the end, all she got in return was him saying that she degraded herself.She knew that Shen Meng Qi spoke ill of her in front of Gu Yue Ze, but if this man had the slightest affection for her, he wouldn\u2019t believe anything Shen Meng Qi said.Since Shen Meng Qi was her best friend, she came over often to keep her company. Thus, she could come in and out as she pleased. She even allowed Gu Yue Ze in secretly.Just as Ye Wan Wan was about to speak, a chill went up her spine.Si Ye Han\u2026He\u2019s here!She was instinctively aware of that man\u2019s presence.In her previous life, she didn\u2019t realize Shen Meng Qi betrayed her. Si Ye Han watched her in the dark the whole time she cheated on him, marking the beginning of her nightmare\u2026Ye Wan Wan sighed gently, forcing herself to ignore the presence of Si Ye Han. She looked at Gu Yue Ze indifferently, chuckled and asked, \u201cI wonder which perspective you\u2019re questioning me from? That of my ex-fiance? Or\u2026 my brother-in-law?\u201dGu Yue Ze\u2019s expression turned heavy at Ye Wan Wan\u2019s sarcasm, \u201cWan Wan, I know you blame me, but I was also helpless. Whatever happened, I\u2019m responsible for what you\u2019ve become today. Leave with me now and I\u2019ll take you out of Imperial City!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She didn\u2019t even fight back when he said all those nasty words to her. She was moved when he said she was forgiven and was touched that he wanted to bring her home, thinking she was still in his heart.She had simply been dumb.Who knew he was just acting out of pride?In any case, she was once Gu Yue Ze\u2019s fiancee, but now she\u2019d become Si Ye Han\u2019s lover. If people found out, wouldn\u2019t he lose all his pride?Just as Gu Yue Ze appealed for her to leave with him, Ye Wan Wan felt a drastic drop in the temperature of the surrounding air.In the darkness only a few steps away from Ye Wan Wan:The man\u2019s expression was as dark as the night. His hostility raged uncontrollably, as if he could crush a man and engulf him whole, not leaving a single trace behind.Si Ye Han\u2019s assistant, Xu Yi, was sweating buckets and both legs were trembling.What a life I have to witness the boss\u2019 woman eloping with another man late at night!Ever since this woman Ye Wan Wan had appeared, the servants hadn\u2019t had an easy day. Once the boss went into a rage, they all suffered.And this woman\u2019s forte was provoking Si Ye Han.This time, boss\u2019 anger would certainly be enough to burn the entirety of Imperial City to ashes!Xu Yi closed his eyes in despair. He knew even without looking what was coming.Seeing that Ye Wan Wan wasn\u2019t moving, Gu Yue Ze got impatient. He reached out to grab her arm, wanting to pull her away.But Ye Wan Wan quickly took a step back, avoiding his touch.\u201cWan Wan?\u201d Gu Yue Ze frowned.Ye Wan Wan replied coldly, \u201cGu Yue Ze, did I say I wanted to leave with you?\u201dGu Yue Ze gave her a pitiful gaze, \u201cWan Wan, Si Ye Han is toying with you. Why must you humiliate yourself just to get back at me?\u201dThe Ye Wan Wan he knew was head-over-heels for him and always did his bidding. Thus, Gu Yue Ze thought she was just trying to seek his attention.\u201cHumiliate myself?\u201dYe Wan Wan laughed like she just heard a joke. She sneered, \u201cSi Ye Han is richer than you, more powerful than you, of a higher class than you, and has a better body than you. Sleeping with him once is better than being with you for a lifetime! How do you have the confidence to say such things?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Yue Ze never imagined that Ye Wan Wan would say those words. His mood darkened.At the same time, the man in the darkness with rage like a beast suddenly calmed down.Xu Yi was surprised and looked in Ye Wan Wan\u2019s direction.Why is Miss Ye acting so strangely today?This is out of character\u2013isn\u2019t she deeply in love with Gu Yue Ze?She should be happy to elope with him!Maybe she\u2019s playing hard to get?This time, Gu Yue Ze was really angry. He warned her, \u201cWan Wan, stop throwing a tantrum. Si Ye Han is a vicious, violent and bloodthirsty man. Do you know how many have died in his hands? Staying with a man like him\u2026 don\u2019t you care for your life?\u201dIn response to Gu Yue Ze\u2019s harsh warning, Ye Wan Wan yawned lazily.

But even though he\u2019s really good looking, anyone who knows him well enough, knows how violent he is.Xu Yi discreetly sneaked glances at his boss, but unfortunately couldn\u2019t make out his emotions from those dark eyes.Is boss\u2026 angry or not?At this moment, Gu Yue Ze looked at the girl who stood in front of him. A girl who was filled with hatred and spoke so viciously. He warned her with the last bit of his patience, \u201cFine\u2026 fine!

Ye Wan Wan, I\u2019ve done my best to help you!\u201dYe Wan Wan relaxed a little when Gu Yue Ze finally stormed off.If she had been in her previous life, she\u2019d have to face the wrath of Si Ye Han. However, she managed to change the course of her life this time since Gu Yue Ze had left while Si Ye Han\u2026Hmm, she wasn\u2019t sure when his presence had disappeared.Did I pass the test?Si Ye Han\u2019s temperament was treacherous and unpredictable so Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t dare let her guard down. After easing her mood, she walked back into the house.Once she stepped into the living room, that familiar voice penetrated into every pore of her body.\u201cCome here.\u201dOn the sofa, the man\u2019s open gaze was like a net, spread wide for her.Ye Wan Wan stood rooted to the ground.Even though she\u2019d been reborn, her fear for this man was still buried deep in her bones and would never go away.But, if she wanted to change her fate, she had to overcome this fear.Ye Wan Wan dug her nails into her palms to maintain her composure and slowly walked towards him\u2026As she came closer, she was swept onto the man\u2019s lap in a swift second, followed by a sudden pain on her lips\u2014\u2014The thin cold lips pressed down hard against hers and nibbled, not missing an inch\u2026Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t move. She forced herself not to resist in order to prevent infuriating him.She couldn\u2019t help but think that the lipstick that she\u2019d put on today was wilder than before; she looked as if she\u2019d been poisoned. Didn\u2019t the colour hurt his eyes? How could he kiss her so passionately?She met Si Ye Han when she was 18. For two whole years, she disguised herself with many different personas, thinking that there must be one that would be revolting to him.She wouldn\u2019t have tortured herself to look like this if she\u2019d known better.After that thought, Ye Wan Wan suddenly came around.She was actually daydreaming in the arms of Si Ye Han?Once she came around, she was surprised to feel a weight on her neck. Si Ye Han was hugging her like a pillow and resting his head on her neck. His breath was hot against her neck, coming in long and steady rhythms.He fell asleep\u2026How could that be!?Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t dare make a sound until half an hour later when Si Ye Han was still without movement. She whispered, \u201cSi Ye Han\u2026?\u201dHe didn\u2019t react.He was really asleep!Not far off, the worried Xu Yi stood by the gate. He witnessed what had happened and was surprised too. His eyes were wide open like he\u2019d seen something unbelievable.Ye Wan Wan was astonished as well.She clearly remembered that Si Ye Han had a serious case of insomnia. His body was also more resistant to drugs than ordinary people, so meds weren\u2019t effective on him. Each time he wanted to go to bed, he needed a professional psychologist to perform hypnotism.Worst of all, aside from being abnormal, he had a strong psychological barrier too. So, it was extremely hard for him to be hypnotized. When he was in a bad mood, hypnotism was totally useless.The Si family hired an innumerable number of well-known doctors for him, but there was no cure.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then put his palms together to plead her and mouthed: \u201cThe 9th Master hasn\u2019t slept for 3 days!\u201dHadn\u2019t slept for 3 days?Could this be because of her running away?In the past 2 years, she hadn\u2019t given up on running away. This time had been her closest to freedom\u2013just a little more and she would\u2019ve been able to get on that overseas cruise\u2026But there was a high price to pay.Before, although Si Ye Han forced her to stay by his side, he had never touched her. The first time he did was three days ago.This was why she had believed her disguise to be effective all along.Just when Xu Yi heaved a sigh of relief, a thunderous ring from the phone resounded throughout the living room, disturbing the silence.Xu Yi was scared out of his wits and nearly tossed the phone away. He quickly turned it off.But it was too late.The devil had been awoken. It slowly opened its eyes, not showing a trace of humanity. It looked towards him with eyes that shot daggers and the colour in Xu Yi\u2019s body drained.Ye Wan Wan was also in a state of shock!Si Ye Han had a horrendous temper whenever he woke up. If he was disturbed during his sleep, that was akin to the end of the world.Panicking, Ye Wan Wan stretched out her hands. She covered Si Ye Han\u2019s eyes with one hand and tugged his head against her shoulders with the other, whilst caressing his soft hair with her fingers, \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026 Go to sleep\u2026\u201dOne second went by\u2026Two seconds went by\u2026Three seconds went by\u2026Si Ye Han did not move.A while later, Ye Wan Wan carefully removed the hand covering Si Ye Han\u2019s eyes. The man had shut his eyes quietly and had fallen into a deep sleep again.Xu Yi\u2019s blood finally started flowing; he had nearly collapsed just now. He looked at Ye Wan Wan with eyes of gratitude.Ye Wan Wan stayed in the same position the entire night.Unsure of when she fell asleep, when she awoke, it was already morning. She was lying on the big bed in the master bedroom, with no sign of Si Ye Han in the house.Ye Wan Wan rubbed her eyes and sat up. The hand she rubbed her eyes with was smeared with eyeliner, fake eyelashes, and glitter eyeshadow.Every girl wants to look beautiful and would know that sleeping with makeup on damages the skin. But for these past 2 years, she never dared to remove her makeup even before going to bed.Conversely, now that she knew that her disguise wasn\u2019t working, she felt a little freer.She could finally be herself again\u2026Ever since she was 18, a flower blossoming age for girls, she had never met anyone without her disguise. She had almost forgotten how she looked like without it.Firstly, would be the big, bloody, horrific tattoos on her body.Fortunately, she was afraid of pain so she didn\u2019t listen to Shen Meng Qi\u2019s advice to get permanent tattoos\u2013the ones on her body could be washed off with soap.Ye Wan Wan searched high and low and finally found the soap in a box filled with various other things. She brought the detergent, makeup remover, cotton pads and a pack of facial masks that Si Ye Han had given her previously in the bathroom.She first removed the numerous ear studs and heavy gold earrings, then the dog chain around her neck. Next, she removed her make up. Finally, she poured the soap into the bathtub and soaked her entire body in it..\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Other than the red crescent-shaped birthmark, her entire body was flawless, just like a piece of jade. Moist and delicate. It was also like snow under the moonlight, white and clear.Before being reborn, she even went to get a permanent tattoo on impulse. This tattoo stuck with her for 7 whole years. So for these 7 years, she had no clue how her body looked like underneath.Now that she had seen its original state, even she herself was shocked at how good her skin was.In addition, she was currently only 20 years old, the age where a girl\u2019s complexion is at its best.After peeling the mask off her face, Ye Wan Wan drained the murky water in the bathtub and washed her body again.She then changed into a bathrobe and sat in front of the dresser.The girl in the mirror had ashy brows, a high nose, and delicate lips in a nice natural shade just like beautiful cherry blossoms in March. The most amazing feature was her pair of eyes, just like an autumn lake, shimmering like stars.Due to her long-term heavy use of makeup, her skin was dry and damaged. But the moisturizing facial mask helped her regain skin as youthful as her body.However, Ye Wan Wan knew that this was only temporary. Just like all the other beauty procedures, the facial mask could only maintain the skin\u2019s condition for a short period, especially those emergency-type facial masks that don\u2019t cure the root of the problem but rather offer a temporary solution.For the skin on her face to completely recover, it still needed more care.The outrageous hairdo she did at the hair salon also returned to its original state after washing. Her long hair that reached her waist was as black as ink and was let down loosely.Previously, she snipped off her long hair that was so precious to her, but now that she had it all back\u2026Ye Wan Wan was so glad she gained back what she had lost. Slowly, she took the wooden comb and combed through the hair she adored.After drying her hair, Ye Wan Wan looked at the wardrobe filled with strange clothes and began worrying again.Forget it, I\u2019ll head to the cloakroom at level 3 and get a set. It\u2019s such a rare chance to be reborn, so why should I make myself uncomfortable?The entire 3rd storey was a cloakroom. Inside, there were people that Si Ye Han had hired to help her with her wardrobe, accessories, and bags. Although she had never touched any of these items, for 7 years, the items in that cloakroom were always on trend.Downstairs.In front of the dining table, Si Ye Han was sipping his coffee leisurely.Due to the lack of sleep, the dark eye circles around the man\u2019s eyes were a lot darker. His flawless face looked as if he had sucked the essence of a demon, just lacking the light emitting out of his body.\u201cAh Si, hot hot hot\u2026\u201d Lin Que was stunned at what he saw and got scalded by the hot piping coffee.Si Ye Han\u2019s turned to look sceptically at his good friend sitting opposite, who was obviously astonished.Lin Que still felt that even when this guy made sarcastic remarks at him, he was still very good looking!Lin Que slammed the coffee he was holding onto the table, \u201cCurses! 9th Si!

With an expression of bitter hatred and resentment, he said, \u201c9th brother, with your status, stature, looks and body, have you thought about what kind of woman you want? Why must you degrade yourself like that?\u201dYe Wan Wan heard the words of Lin Que while making her way down.Why did what Lin Que said sound so familiar?\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you\u2019re curious and want to have a taste of something different.

A girl in a pure white dress, with a slim body. She had long hair reaching her waist, her glances were enticing and her lips were like peaches. She was a real beauty with flesh of ice and bones of jade. Her beauty was out of this world.This girl was really\u2026 unbelievably gorgeous\u2026The light could not be shielded even from a beast like Si Ye Han.Lin Que was still dumbfounded by the time Ye Wan Wan walked over to the dining table.Ye Wan Wan scanned the dining table. Normally, she always sat in the seat furthest away from Si Ye Han. This time, she thought carefully and took the seat next to him instead.Seeing that the girl had actually sat next to him, Si Ye Han looked at her with a twinkle in his eyes.Abiding by the principle of \u2018the lesser you talk, the lesser mistakes you will make\u2019, Ye Wan Wan sat down and started eating her breakfast silently.From the moment she woke up, she had received stares.She was also quite uncomfortable with the sudden transformation back to her usual self. She wondered what Si Ye Han thought about it.Anyway, since he didn\u2019t even mind her horrendous appearance, why not doll up and make herself feel good?Ye Wan Wan thought to herself and ate her porridge at ease.All of a sudden, a slender finger reached towards her face.Ye Wan Wan tensed up and her whole body froze.Then, that finger gathered a wisp of hair that nearly fell into the porridge and swept it behind her ear.Now, Si Ye Han leaned on the chair lazily. Once he was done re-arranging the girl\u2019s hair, he slowly retracted his arm with his gaze fixed on her. With a curious and unperceivable passion, his eyes slowly inspected every inch of the girl\u2019s skin and expression.Ye Wan Wan heaved a sigh of relief and quickly used a hand to hold up her hair, preventing it from falling again.At this moment, Lin Que finally came around and gasped excitedly, \u201c9th brother! You have finally thought it through! You should have found someone like that before! Why would you allow that woman to step over you?\u201dYe Wan Wan, \u201c\u2026Step over\u2026\u201dLin Que also said, \u201cOh right, where is that ugly woman? Have you chased her out?\u201dYe Wan Wan, \u201c\u2026Ugly woman\u2026\u201dLin Que said, \u201cAlthough that Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t look so bad 2 years ago when you guys just started, she was fat! She was at least 150 pounds!\u201dYe Wan Wan, \u201c\u2026!!! Nonsense! I was obviously 140! Even though I was greedy and gained tremendous weight during my teens, my weight has never exceeded 150 okay?\u201dLin Que, \u201c9th brother, I didn\u2019t understand what you saw in her, why would you fall in love with a fatty?\u201dYe Wan Wan, \u201c\u2026Fatty\u2026\u201dYe Wan Wan couldn\u2019t take it anymore!No woman can tolerate being called fat!Smack\u2014\u2014Ye Wan Wan suddenly slammed down the chopsticks that were in her hand, her eyes sending daggers across to Lin Que\u2014\u2014\u201cLin!

Also, tell me clearly how am I fat!\u201dA trance-like look appeared on Si Ye Han\u2019s listless face.The girl looked as if there was a fire in her eyes\u2013a long time since they were so intense.The raging Ye Wan Wan suddenly felt a cool palm stroking her head, like someone trying to tame an angry beast.At the same time, a warm voice went through her ears, \u201cYou\u2019re not fat.\u201dYe Wan Wan was taken aback and looked at Si Ye Han.Had she lost her mind? How could she find Si Ye Han\u2026 gentle\u2026?Ye Wan Wan stopped her train of thought and realized that she was overly agitated. \u201cI\u2019m not fat at all now\u2026\u201d she said, embarrassed.Si Ye Han said, \u201cYou weren\u2019t fat before either.\u201dLin Que turned serious, \u201c9th brother, say that again with your conscience!\u201dYe Wan Wan gritted her teeth in rage.Si Ye Han turned to look at Lin Que slowly, \u201cI have given that piece of land in Cheng Dong to Xie Zhe Zhi.\u201dLin Que was suddenly dumbfounded, \u201cWhat? Don\u2019t joke about this, 9th brother! Didn\u2019t you promise to give it to me? Have you already given it to Xie Zhe Zhi or did you just decide to give it to Xie Zhe Zhi in that one second?\u201dSi Ye Han: \u201cI just decided.\u201dLin Que: \u201c\u2026!!!\u201dDamn! Just because I called Ye Wan Wan fat just now?\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 You\u2019re a fool!\u201d Lin Que retorted.Not only did Si Ye Han not refute, he enjoyed this title. With an expressionless face, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re in the way, you should leave now.\u201dNot only was he foolish, he\u2019s even biased towards his lover and finds his own brother a nuisance.Lin Que\u2019s heart broke and he ran off in tears.After Lin Que left, Ye Wan Wan and Si Ye Han were left alone in the dining room.With Lin Que around, Ye Wan Wan breathed easy but once he left, she tensed up again. The presence of the man was instantly magnified.\u201cEat more.\u201dHer plate had another Xiao Long Bao from her favourite breakfast store.Ye Wan Wan had conflicting emotions.Ever since she appeared, Si Ye Han did not have any special reaction to her change in appearance at all.It was more normal to react like Lin Que right?Ye Wan Wan couldn\u2019t hold it in and asked, \u201cSi Ye Han, don\u2019t you find anything different about me today?\u201dSi Ye Han placed a prawn dumpling on her plate, \u201cWhat?\u201dYe Wan Wan: \u201cMy looks!\u201dSi Ye Han furrowed his brows,\u201dWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201dYe Wan Wan was stunned, \u201c\u2026\u201dIs this man blind?He looked at her unbelievable expression and gave a little laugh. He cupped her delicate chin, ran his finger over her lips and said in a deep romantic voice, \u201cStill look as delicious.\u201dYe Wan Wan:\u201d\u2026\u201dLook as delicious?!He actually finds my previous horrendous look delicious?

Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Ye Wan Wan replied, aggrieved.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d the man chuckled.Ye Wan Wan looked at the man, fearful.The unusual spark on his face was neither ghastly, violent nor detached\u2026 Si Ye Han was actually laughing.She realised just now that this man seemed to be in a very good mood today.Was it because he had a good sleep last night?Actually, Si Ye Han\u2019s hot-tempered temperament was closely related to his insomnia; nobody is able to tolerate such a long-term sleeping disorder.As she thought about it, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s mind started to wander.Should I take this chance to bring up that issue, since he\u2019s in a good mood today?When she was downstairs, she received a message from the class monitor asking her to go to school. If she continued to miss school, she might be punished or expelled.Due to her bad results, she had already been held back 2 years and would be 20 years old by senior year.She remembered that during her previous life, she was only concerned about one thing every day, which was Gu Yue Ze.Before meeting Si Ye Han, she was obsessed with Gu Yue Ze. After meeting Si Ye Han, she kept thinking about escaping back to Gu Yue Ze\u2019s side. She was totally disinterested in learning.Soon after, she didn\u2019t bother attending school and didn\u2019t make it for the college entrance exam. Her studies were completely delayed.This time, she wouldn\u2019t allow herself to destroy her life like she did before.This time, although she was grounded due to her escape attempt like her previous life, this time she didn\u2019t leave with Gu Yue Ze. Thus her relationship with Si Ye Han was still redeemable and there was still room for mitigation.Ye Wan Wan took a deep breath and asked hesitantly, \u201cMay I\u2026 go to school\u2026 tomorrow?\u201dAs soon as her voice died down, the pressure in the house lowered and the man regained his indifferent expression.Ye Wan Wan could hear her own heartbeat. I\u2019m still not allowed to go to school?Even though she expected it not to be that easy, Ye Wan Wan couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed. Her face turned grim as she looked at her favourite bun with no appetite and muttered softly, \u201cIf it\u2019s not possible then forget it.\u201dBut Si Ye Han\u2019s face didn\u2019t look any happier, instead, he looked more sullen.Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t want to aggravate him right after their relationship improved so she quickly said, \u201cI was just casually asking. I\u2019m not going anymore.\u201dSi Ye Han kept silent and looked at the girl\u2019s dull eyes with a panicked expression on her face. Looking at the girl\u2019s expression reminded him how it was last time, and an uncontrollable temper rose in him.Ye Wan Wan put on a face of innocence\u2013 this man\u2019s too hard to please.

The relationship between Si Ye Han and herself seemed to return to the way it was before she was reborn.The fear for the person in front of her started creeping back into her body.Fortunately, at this moment, a pair of footsteps broke the deadlock.Xu Yi brought with him a group of gardeners, florists, and builders into the dining hall and spoke, \u201c9th master, the repair works in the garden\u2026 um\u2026\u201dXu Yi broke off mid-sentence and saw a girl sitting on the left of Si Ye Han. He paused momentarily while the workers behind him gave each other puzzled looks.He wasn\u2019t just surprised because of this girl\u2019s beautiful appearance but everyone knew that the master had a serious case of OCD and was disgusted with women. There was only one woman in the world that the master could tolerate and that was none other than Ye Wan Wan.So who exactly was this woman?Ye Wan Wan looked at Xu Yi and the workers. She took a bite of the prawn dumpling and said apologetically, \u201cUh, I forgot to put on my make up today, did I scare all of you?\u201dYe\u2026 Ye Wan Wan!!!Upon hearing this familiar voice, everybody including Xu Yi was flabbergasted.That ugly creature looked appalling but had a great voice, like a clear stream in Jiang Nan, crystalline and bright.Yet this beautiful voice caused all of them to have a reflexive reaction of revulsion. After all, ever since this woman entered Jin garden, all these people had suffered as well.The girl that appeared beside the master now, as pretty as a lotus flower that rose from beneath the water, was actually Ye Wan Wan?Seeing everyone\u2019s reaction, Ye Wan Wan thought seriously, \u201cSurely I look better than before right? I remember all of you were most surprised when I dyed my hair green! Maybe I should change it back tomorrow?\u201dThey weren\u2019t surprised; they were obviously horrified!Xu Yi finally came around and shook his head fervently, \u201cNo no, Miss, you look really good like that!\u201dLittle did he expect that Ye Wan Wan looked like this without makeup.So all along this Miss Ye didn\u2019t have issues with coordinating colours, but actually, had mental issues?Master\u2019s eyes must be really sharp. How is it possible that he was able to see her natural state through her makeup that\u2019s as thick as a wall?If Ye Wan Wan knew what was running through Xu Yi\u2019s mind, she would definitely tell him that his master didn\u2019t need to see through the \u201cwall\u201d, instead, his master had a fondness for the \u201cwall\u201d!\u201cAre all of you here to discuss the repair works of the garden?\u201d Ye Wan Wan asked.Xu Yi nodded instinctively, \u201cYes.\u201dYe Wan Wan then probed, \u201cMay I give you some suggestions?\u201dConsidering that I\u2019m going to live here for some time, why not make myself comfortable according to my liking?I\u2019m not allowed to go to school, but this should be fine right?She remembered that aside from leaving, Si Ye Han would give in to any requests of hers.But hearing Ye Wan Wan\u2019s request, Xu Yi felt like killing himself. He immediately turned to Si Ye Han for help, hoping that he could decide for himself.9th master! Please, I beg you! Do not let her destroy the garden anymore!Si Ye Han replied Ye Wan Wan with three words, \u201cUp to you.\u201dXu Yi: \u201c\u2026\u201dFine, I already knew it would be like that.Xu Yi could only accept his fate miserably and asked, \u201cMiss, what requests do you have?\u201dYe Wan Wan thought carefully, \u201cI don\u2019t like the roses and lavender, could you change that plot to sunflowers instead?\u201dXu Yi was speechless for a moment. He asked instinctively, \u201cMiss, you like sunflowers?\u201dCompared to \u201cBurn those flowers\u201d or \u201cPull all of them out\u201d type of requests, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s current request was too normal.Ye Wan Wan thought for a moment and replied, \u201cThey\u2019re so-so.\u201dXu Yi didn\u2019t understand, \u201cThen why\u2026\u201dYe Wan Wan\u2019s eyes brightened, \u201cSo in the future, the seeds can be fried and eaten!\u201dXu Yi: \u201cEr\u2026\u201dSi Ye Han: \u201c\u2026\u201dYe Wan Wan then pointed to the far side, \u201cAlso, that pond over there, don\u2019t keep those dead expensive Kois anymore.

At Si Ye Han\u2019s place, this was also true. The chefs at Jin garden always came up with different creative foods daily just to get her to eat more because if she ate less than the benchmark Si Ye Han had set for her, those chefs would be fired.But she didn\u2019t know what was wrong with herself either\u2013she had a habit of hoarding food like a hamster. The more food surrounding her, the more secure she felt.In her previous life, due to Si Ye Han\u2019s constant monitoring, she felt dejected and slowly lost her appetite.With such a rare chance to be reborn, aside from dolling herself up, she wanted to have good meals, otherwise it would be a waste of this second chance.After a long time, Si Ye Han looked at Xu Yi, \u201cMake the changes accordingly.\u201dXu Yi replied with an ashen face, \u201cYes\u2026\u201dHe was simply too gullible, thinking that this woman had really changed.She wants to change the prestigious private Jin garden into a vegetable farm, this is insane\u2026Ye Wan Wan jumped for joy when Si Ye Han agreed to it. She squealed excitedly, \u201cGreat! This way, we can have good food when autumn comes!\u201dWhen autumn comes\u2026Hearing these 3 words, Si Ye Han\u2019s expression changed slightly, his eyes as well.The Ye Wan Wan from before only thought of running away from him, since when did she think about the future?For the whole day, Ye Wan Wan discussed in detail the crops to grow in each area with Xu Yi and assigned jobs to the servants.When evening came, the Jin garden that Ye Wan Wan destroyed looked completely brand new again.Cabbage in the east, sunflowers in the west, the walls had newly-built grape shelves, those expensive plantations had been replaced by vegetables and fruit, the water in the pond had been changed and the beautiful carp and live prawns were swimming inside happily\u2026Every flower and plant in the old Jin garden was rare and so priceless that even the workers had to be wary of every step they took. Otherwise, they could accidentally kill a plant worth hundreds and thousands of dollars. Now, although it had become a vegetable plantation, any accident would still be frowned upon.Maybe she had done too much physical work that day, but Ye Wan Wan\u2019s appetite was back and she ate heartily during dinner.After filling herself up and fueling herself with energy, she reflected on what happened that day.There wasn\u2019t only the issue of going back to school but the problematic relationship and situation between her and Si Ye Han too.To create change, she had to have a talk with him.Si Ye Han\u2019s room was on the top floor, the room that she would never go near previously.\u201cDong dong dong\u2013\u201dYe Wan Wan stood nervously in front of the door, took a deep breath and knocked.*Squeak* the door opened and a pair of cold, deep eyes greeted her.\u201cHey, I have something to discuss with you. Is this a convenient time?\u201dThe man seemed to have expected her arrival.

The curtains were drawn completely and the whole room felt shut in.There was a great abundance of alcohol in the room\u2013a row of various hard liquors was neatly lined in a huge alcohol cabinet.Other than Si Ye Han, there was someone else in the room.Si Ye Han\u2019s hypnotist.From the looks of it, Si Yi Han was preparing for bed.Well, so much fuss just to go to bed\u2026Seeing that he slept quite soundly last night, it was probably due to the lack of sleep for the past 3 nights?As Ye Wan Wan entered, the hypnotist left.Under the warm glow of light above her head, Si Ye Han walked over to the bar, sat down and poured himself a glass of red wine, \u201cGo on.\u201dYe Wan Wan had already prepared a script earlier so she didn\u2019t hesitate and went straight to the point, \u201cI wish to talk about our relationship.\u201d\u201cOur relationship?\u201d The man raised his brows, expressing interest in the topic.Ye Wan Wan nodded and said in a serious tone, \u201cYes.

The more you try to control and force me, the more I try to escape. As the saying goes, a melon forced off its vine is not sweet. I am sure you know this principle!\u201dThe man listened silently until she finished speaking. He was resting his head on his hand lazily and had another hand swirling the wine glass.

If she acted on Shen Meng Qi now, it would only worsen her relationship with her brother.Thus, she could only wait for the right opportunity.Inside the master\u2019s bedroom at the top level:After Ye Wan Wan left, the hypnotist came back into the room and prepared for treatment again.\u201c9th master, can we start now?\u201dSi Ye Han seemed to be preoccupied with thoughts and appeared to not hear what the hypnotist said. He just casually raised his arm.So, the hypnotist played music, lighted special incense and started the psychological session\u2026Half an hour later\u2026An hour later\u2026Two hours later\u2026Hypnosis failed.He, Mo Xuan, had cured numerous complicated cases and was also hired by the world\u2019s No. 1 mercenary group \u201cGods of Dusk\u201d as a top counsellor and psychologist. But now, he began to question his abilities for the millionth time.Each time he treated Si Ye Han, he felt like a quack\u2026Ever since Si Ye Han got together with that woman Ye Wan Wan, every time she ran away or went against him, it made his insomnia more severe.But didn\u2019t Xu Yi say that that woman had thought it through and became meeker recently?Just now when he saw her, he was shocked. Not only had her appearance changed, her disposition was different as well\u2013not as sombre as before.Since that woman hadn\u2019t aggravated Si Ye Han, why did the hypnosis fail this time?At this moment, Si Ye Han was lying in bed with dark eye circles slowly building. The green veins on his forehead were bulging and his expression was grim, obviously trying to endure the suffering.It was like a scary beast lived inside him. The loss of control, the manic and destructive behaviour were eroding his spirit now.Si Ye Han\u2019s condition worsened and Mo Xuan\u2019s glum face became more serious. He asked anxiously, \u201c9th master, did you have any problems today? What did Miss Ye say to you just now?\u201dSi Ye Han\u2019s eyes that were tightly shut quickly opened up, his pupils cold.Strong coercion caused Mo Xuan to stop asking.If Si Ye Han was willing to share his emotions with people, his illness wouldn\u2019t have been so serious.His psychological barrier was too strong\u2013he didn\u2019t allow anyone to enter his territory.There was nothing a psychologist could do, no matter how skilled, if the patient didn\u2019t cooperate.Thinking about Ye Wan Wan, Mo Xuan\u2019s emotions became a bit complicated.There was nothing wrong with Si Ye Han\u2019s body and his sleeping disorder could be traced to a psychological issue, but this woman may be related to the knot in Si Ye Han\u2019s heart.Otherwise, it was too difficult to explain why a person who discriminated against women the way Si Ye Han did was so determined to be with this ordinary girl. Furthermore, based on what he\u2019d observed, Ye Wan Wan could easily manipulate Si Ye Han\u2019s moods.However, he could no longer get an answer from Si Ye Han and couldn\u2019t get any useful information from Ye Wan Wan either.The Ye family was in the entertainment business. Ye Wan Wan\u2019s 2nd uncle was currently the head of the Ye family and owned most of the businesses in the entertainment group. But compared to the long history and deep background of the old and well-known Si family, the Ye family was just an average family.Be it Ye Wan Wan or her family, it wasn\u2019t possible to have any relation with Si Ye Han, the family heir of the Si family\u2013the family that ruled all the countries\u2019 old and well-known families. Therefore, Si Ye Han\u2019s special treatment towards Ye Wan Wan was simply puzzling.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Without it, she was afraid that she couldn\u2019t go to school anymore. It was, after all, the first awakening of love for teenage boys and girls in high school. If she showed her true self and a guy confessed his love for her, it would be over for her.Furthermore, the most important thing for her now was to please Si Ye Han. Since Si Ye Han liked how she looked before, she didn\u2019t mind making a sacrifice to keep him happy.With such a rare chance to be reborn, even if she couldn\u2019t wait to be herself again, she knew that until she was strong enough, things like this didn\u2019t matter.Ye Wan Wan then put on her usual makeup and wore a shiny green wig.When Ye Wan Wan went downstairs, she didn\u2019t see Si Ye Han around, but the Lin Que fellow was there again.He was speaking to someone excitedly when he raised his eyes and saw her. He immediately spat out his coffee\u2014\u2014\u201cUwaaagh! My eyes!!!\u201dYe Wan Wan rolled her eyes at him, that was nothing to be surprised about.Her eyes swept around the room downstairs and realized that not only was Lin Que around but Si Ye Han\u2019s good friend, Xie Zhe Zhi, was there as well.Xie Zhe Zhi\u2019s glittering peach blossom eyes looked up at Ye Wan Wan, focusing on her hair. He was stunned, obviously shocked by her, \u201cLin 2nd, this is why you woke me up at 5 in the morning to rush to the Jin garden to see\u2026 a surprise? Well, it\u2019s quite a surprise indeed. Little Ye\u2019s style is getting more and more creative I see!\u201d\u201cNo! No, yesterday she was\u2026 Yesterday she didn\u2019t have any makeup on and was really beautiful. I was speechless\u2026\u201d Lin Que explained.Xie Zhe Zhi laughed so hard, \u201cYes yes yes, I can see that she\u2019s really beautiful. Don\u2019t worry, you can also find yourself someone with this style like 9th brother did.\u201dLin Que had no way of explaining himself and just stared at Ye Wan Wan.Ye Wan Wan raised her brows, \u201cWhy\u2019re you looking at me? Putting on makeup is a girl\u2019s most basic form of respect for others, don\u2019t you know?\u201dThe corners of Lin Que\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cYou are so respectful\u2026\u201dAt this moment, there was the sound of footsteps above them\u2013Si Ye Han was awake.He looked downstairs and when his gaze fell upon Ye Wan Wan, he didn\u2019t show any reaction.He was, if anything, the one with the strongest mentality\u2013 he did not even bat an eyelid when he saw her like that.Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t forget that it was utterly important to please and show her sincerity to Si Ye Han so that he would trust her and be assured. So she skipped towards Si Ye Han to fish for compliments, \u201c9th master 9th master, do I look good today?\u201dSince Si Ye Han had an acquired taste, her current look should please him, right?Si Ye Han looked at the sparkling eyes in front of him begging for compliments and the radiant expression on her face. He was gloomy the entire night because of her leaving but seeing this cheered him up a bit, \u201cYep.\u201dYe Wan Wan was elated, she was right!Lin Que could not bear to look. 9th brother, doesn\u2019t this prick your conscience?Looking at how Ye Wan Wan and Si Ye Han were getting along so well, Xie Zhe Zhi was a little taken aback as he raised his brows and his fingers lightly tapped his chin.

His grandfather was one of the founding fathers, Lin Zheng Rong, General Lin. The Lin Que 7 years later was also all-powerful and ruthless in the political scene.However, due to the fact that the Ye family was in the entertainment business, Ye Wan Wan paid the most attention to the actor Xie Zhe Zhi.He must\u2019ve felt Ye Wan Wan sneaking glances at him.

Of course I want one!Xie Zhe Zhi\u2019s going to be an Oscar award-winning actor in the future! Z country\u2019s very first male actor with an Oscar award! This autograph would be worth quite a lot if I sold it!Even now, Xie Zhe Zhi received numerous big awards and was the most popular guy in the entertainment scene\u2013the male actor that every teenage girl in Z country was crazy for.Aside from his autograph, just any telephone booth that featured his public photo became a popular attraction that many fangirls would swarm to take pictures of.But considering the possessiveness of that pervert Si Ye Han, Ye Wan Wan eventually shook her head to herself.How could I dare to keep another man\u2019s autograph? There\u2019s no way unless I\u2019m tired of living!Seeing that Ye Wan Wan obviously wanted his autograph but painfully rejected it after peeking at Ye Si Han, Xie Zhe Zhi laughed, \u201cLittle Ye is really cute.\u201dYe Wan Wan: \u201c\u2026\u201dStop this, Movie god Xie!

Ye Wan Wan immediately glared at Lin Que and said, \u201cHeard that? Learn something from that, you single dog!\u201dLin Que flared up, \u201cDamn! Who\u2019re you calling a single dog? You\u2019re the single dog!\u201dYe Wan Wan tilted her head towards Si Ye Han next to her, \u201cDarling, Lin junior called me a single dog!

Her teenage heart was with Gu Yue Ze, who was tall and handsome. She spent all day thinking of how to please him, wrote him hundreds of love letters and even folded a thousand paper cranes.After all that, her grades suffered due to this boy.The morning glow from the sun shone brightly on her green wig.

Who is that!

She didn\u2019t need to try to recall where her spot was\u2013she knew exactly where it was.As the seats in every class were arranged according to their class ranking, she had always been the first from the back, meaning that she sat in the last row.In the seat in the last row next to the window was a boy lying down.The boy had messy and unkempt hair with earphones playing and was lying on the desk taking a nap. The sun\u2019s glow filtered in and danced on the teenager\u2019s delicate face, allowing him to look like a model right out of a fashion magazine.Si Xia, Qing He High School\u2019s hunk.Smoking, fighting, skipping class\u2013he was well versed in all of them.

Even though I\u2019ve broken a few school rules, they were all minor offences like putting on makeup, not wearing the school uniform and skipping class. According to school regulations, you\u2019ll be expelled only if you are charged with 3 big offences.She would be expelled completely because Liang Li Hua had denigrated her in front of the school leaders.Typically speaking, as a teacher there was no need to make life difficult for a student. However, Ye Wan Wan counted herself \u201ctoo lucky\u201d to have accidentally bumped into Liang Li Hua having an affair with a certain married school leader previously.Naturally, Liang Li Hua would try every way possible to get rid of this thorn in her side!It had been the same in her previous life.

With a father that embezzles and is deep in debt, what good can come out of his family?\u201dLiang Li Hua exposed Ye Wan Wan\u2019s private family affairs with a face full of loathing and mockery in front of all the students.Immediately, there was a circulation of whispers and all the students looked repulsed.Ye Wan Wan stood in silence rooted at the same spot, expressionless.Only Si Xia who was closest to her could see that after hearing Liang Li Hua\u2019s words about her father, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s numb eyes shattered like ice, revealing an extremely scary chill.The boy\u2019s brows twitched and doubt flashed before his eyes, was that an illusion?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There is no need to blow up the matter now.\u201cEverybody, please turn to page 72 of your textbook!\u201dThe students sighed in disappointment, seeing that the drama had ended.Senior year classes were spent completing numerous major and minor exams. The exam this time was considered more important and the seats would be reallocated based on the results.Ye Wan Wan swept through the contents of the textbook and closed her eyes.Within the next second, the contents of the textbook were imprinted clearly within her mind.It was known to very little people that she had the ability to remember everything she read.Once she read the information in the textbook, she would be able to pen everything down, even without going through her brain.How well she performed was totally dependent on how well she wanted to perform.Unfortunately, results and scores to the Ye Wan Wan of the past didn\u2019t mean anything\u2013her heart was never focused on her studies.If she wanted the school to eradicate the decision to expel her, the examination this time around was crucial.Although it was a little rushed with a week left to study, it was sufficient for her.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His expression turned gloomy.Ye Wan Wan was flipping through the pages faster than she flipped out in class today.How is this reading?But if she\u2019s not reading, what is she doing? Is she so bored that she\u2019s flipping through the pages for fun?\u201cNoisy.\u201d The boy\u2019s handsome face was filled with annoyance.Ye Wan Wan\u2019s expression turned slightly darker, this bastard is still full of energy, huh!Believe it or not, I will use my seniority to crush you!According to seniority, he\u2019s supposed to respectfully call me 9th aunt!In her previous life, she only found out later that the hunk of Qing He was actually the nephew of Si Ye Han.Ye Wan Wan raised her brows, \u201cOh, you find me noisy? If you\u2019re so smart then do well on the exam and move to the front then! The weak will always fall prey to the strong and the strongest will get the most respect. Slackers don\u2019t have the right to complain!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The boy was dumbfounded after being told off.Did he just get mocked by the lousiest student in school?Oh, very well.For this exam, he would let her know exactly what it meant for the weak to fall prey to the strong!The day went by quickly as the final school bell rang.Skipping class was always fun while studying felt like being in a crematorium.For the whole day, Ye Wan Wan looked at people with double vision, with words floating around in her vision.In the coming week, there would be no classes so everyone could focus on studying for the coming exams.Qing He High School used the enclosed teaching method\u2013except for special circumstances, every student had to live on school grounds.After school, the students filed back into their hostels. Ye Wan Wan also brought her luggage and followed them towards the hostel building.Each dormitory was occupied by 4 people. However, her roommates jointly excluded her so she had one room to herself.In addition, nobody knew about her relationship with Si Ye Han so in fact, living alone was ideal for her.Her fair and delicate fingers gently pushed the door open and a familiar scent immediately came over her.The room was not big but it was enough for her. Compared to the enormous Jin garden, this gave her a sense of security.Furthermore, Qing He had always been funded by rich business owners and school associates so the hostel was quite decent. Other than air conditioning, each room had its own ensuite bathroom as well.Ye Wan Wan put her luggage down and tidied up.Once she was done, she was about to take a seat and start studying until a knock on the door interrupted her.When she opened the door, Shen Meng Qi was standing there in a light pink lace dress.Tears started rolling once the girl saw Ye Wan Wan, \u201cWan Wan! You\u2019re finally in school! I was so worried! It\u2019s so great to see that you\u2019re fine!\u201dLooking at Shen Meng Qi\u2019s extremely concerned reaction, Ye Wan Wan could not help but feel touched. With such a display of her acting skills, it would be difficult to alter Shen Meng Qi\u2019s course in the entertainment business.Ye Wan Wan sat down in front of her desk, annoyed that she was disturbed, \u201cIs there a problem? Whatever it is, please come back in a week, I don\u2019t have time now.\u201dShen Meng Qi assumed she had fought with Gu Yue Ze and was in a bad mood and cooed, \u201cI think Mr Gu misunderstood your relationship with Si Ye Han but he loves you deeply and has a strong sense of responsibility. You\u2019re still in his heart\u2013otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have helped you! As long as you go and explain the misunderstanding to him, everything will be fine!\u201dYe Wan Wan didn\u2019t have time to entertain this actress and was already engrossed in her book at this point.Shen Meng Qi saw that Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t stop flipping through pages in annoyance and guessed that she wasn\u2019t calming down and decided to stop trying to convince her.\u201cThen Wan Wan, I\u2019m leaving first since exams are coming and I have to study. My dad will give me a new phone if I stay in the top 3 in class. Come find me if you have a problem!\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t even lift her head.Shen Meng Qi furrowed her brows a little, not being used to Ye Wan Wan\u2019s cold attitude.Just as she was about to leave, she caught a glimpse of a nicely-decorated paper\u2013a love letter.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not only can I walk in and out of Jin garden, I get so many expensive gifts too. If I encounter any problems, I can bring it up to him and he\u2019ll always send people to help .Shen Meng Qi\u2019s cheeks turned scarlet red, her whole face filled with sweetness and confidence. She just needed to work a little harder and this man would be hers sooner or later![Mr. Si, I heard that you and Ye Wan Wan fought, are you okay? Don\u2019t you worry about Wan Wan, I just went to see her, she\u2019s doing quite well.]There was an image attached to this message, the one she secretly took of Ye Wan Wan with the love letter in plain sight.With Si Ye Han\u2019s observant skills, he would definitely spot the love letter written to Gu Yue Ze!He would know that after Ye Wan Wan left him, she was feeling great and even aggressively chasing after Gu Yue Ze.She had to fan the flames now and make Si Ye Han hate Ye Wan Wan without any possibility of changing his mind.At this moment, Ye Wan Wan was in her hostel.After Shen Meng Qi left, Ye Wan Wan continued reading but she had the nagging feeling that something was off.She looked at the corner of her desk subconsciously.Sure enough, there was a draft of a love letter on the corner. It was written for Gu Yue Ze but she hadn\u2019t finished writing it so it hadn\u2019t been mailed out.Tsk, almost forgot about this!In her previous life, Si Ye Han grounded her and she naturally resisted. Only when she threatened to kill herself did she manage to successfully go back to school. Since Shen Meng Qi kept making trouble, she was unable to attend school for long and her reputation was destroyed.And the first time Shen Meng Qi made trouble between her and Si Ye Han was by using this love letter.Even though things were a little different in this life, according to her understanding of Shen Meng Qi, she would never let go of a chance to smear her name even if she broke up with Si Ye Han.Ye Wan Wan picked up that love letter, spun the pencil in her hand and the corners of her mouth turned up slowly.Thank goodness this love letter was just a draft and hadn\u2019t been addressed to anybody yet.So, why can\u2019t it be written for Si Ye Han?Ye Wan Wan grabbed her phone, took a picture of the love letter and quickly sent it to Si Ye Han, with a heart-shaped emoticon.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His fingers were dripping blood from smashing the cup and the coffee table was overturned on the floor. There was a strong oppressive atmosphere raging throughout the big room.All the servants in the house were shaking in fear and hiding in a corner, none of them even dared to breathe.Xu Yi\u2019s back was drenched in sweat. He straightened his back and stood next to the man. He eyed the broken phone on the floor, face full of despair.It was a good quality phone and even with the screen cracked, it clearly showed an image of a love letter.Damn, I knew this would happen!That woman was devoted to the man by the surname Gu; she didn\u2019t care about being dumped or left at the altar and still stuck to him. How was it possible that she\u2019d suddenly change her mind and decide to live happily with the master?Isn\u2019t this lying to the master on one hand and immediately chasing Gu Yue Ze on the other?She even wrote such a mushy love letter!She is simply shameless!There was a poem on the love letter\u2013it roughly meant that she was willing to be the collar on his clothes to feel his fragrance, willing to be the belt on his coat to hug his waist, willing to be the oil on his hair to moisten his black hair\u2026Totally obscene love song!No wonder master\u2019s so mad!She was just a woman and a disobedient one at that. Why must he spoil her? Treating her like a pet would be good enough.Master must be out of his mind; he actually got fooled by that woman\u2019s words.At this moment, the man\u2019s face turned gloomy.

I\u2019ll send my people after her this instance!\u201dIn a flash, a row of black cars left Jin garden silently and entered the darkness.In the living room, all the servants were as silent as cicadas in the winter, their hearts filled with discontent.Ever since that woman entered Jin garden, they didn\u2019t have a single day of peace. She had fouled the whole atmosphere of Jin garden.Xu Yi looked out the window at the thick dark night, his heart glum as well. What was waiting for them next may be another storm\u2026I wonder what that woman will do after she gets dragged back here!When that time came, the ones that would suffer the most would be the servants\u2026\u201cDing\u2014\u2014\u201dJust then, the broken phone on the floor rang and the screen brightened at the same time.Xu Yi picked the phone up to take a look and furrowed his brows together the next second.Why is it this love letter again?Moreover, this time it was only the picture of the love letter.Xu Yi was still confused until he saw the sender and was flabbergasted. This message was not sent by Shen Meng Qi\u2026 it was Ye Wan Wan!!!What\u2026 What does this mean?Could it be that the mushy love letter was not written for Gu Yue Ze, but Ye Wan Wan wrote it\u2026 for master!?Damn!!!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They didn\u2019t understand why their master who was raging mad like a lion and destroying everything a moment before had become so quiet in the next second. He was also staring at his phone with fluctuating emotions as if he was trying to decipher something.Xu Yi, also uncertain about Si Ye Han\u2019s attitude, opened his mouth slowly and carefully, \u201c9th master, you\u2026\u201dSi Ye Han: \u201cBe quiet.\u201dXu Yi shut his mouth instantly.Si Ye Han continued staring at his phone with a serious face while his slender fingers tapped the screen.The man furrowed his brows slightly, since the screen was no longer fully functional due to the cracks.Xu Yi was beyond curious.

The chaos provoked much discussion in school with all sorts of rumours spreading around. Some said that she had a sugar daddy and was caught because she ran away, some said that her family was deep in debt with loan sharks and they caught her to sell her body\u2026Although the rumours were baseless, all these gossips could destroy a person.Thinking back on the past, Ye Wan Wan felt a chill\u2026Then, the phone in her palm suddenly vibrated.Ye Wan Wan paused for a moment and slowly looked at the new text message\u2026Si Ye Han had replied her with a single word \u201cGood\u201d and even added a \u201ckissing\u201d emoticon.Ye Wan Wan stared at that \u201ckiss\u201d, completely stunned, \u201c\u2026\u201dCould you imagine a ferocious and vicious monster sending you a \u201ckissing\u201d emoticon?At the same time, the chill that had pervaded her body dissipated due to that unbelievable emoticon.Si Ye Han\u2026 seemed to be different\u2026 from the guy she had known in her previous life\u2026In addition, she had also found out something incredible!Ye Wan Wan cupped her chin, lightly tapped her cheeks and composed another text message to send over: [Eternal kisses~ Just one more week until exams~ I will be focusing on my revision so for now, I won\u2019t be able to text you anymore. You must remember to miss me every day~]Afer Ye Wan Wan sent the text, the opposite party replied within seconds, [Yeah.]Staring at that incredibly simple \u201cYeah\u201d, Ye Wan Wan blinked in astonishment.That\u2026 that actually worked?I just said that I wouldn\u2019t be contacting him for a week!

If she had known that Si Ye Han was so easy to please, she wouldn\u2019t have suffered so much in her previous life!Fine, discovering the secret weapon to deal with that monster is definitely a good thing.After dealing with Si Ye Han, Ye Wan Wan had no more distractions. She could bury her head in her books and put her heart and soul into her studies.7 days went by in a blink of an eye.In these 7 days, Ye Wan Wan slept only 3 to 4 hours a day. Finally, she managed to cover all the material from Senior years 1 to 3.Now that she realized how painful it was to not have enough sleep, she would sleep from dawn to dusk once exams were over.On the first day of exams was the comprehensive liberal arts and language exam. Ye Wan Wan drifted into the classroom like a wandering ghost.Initially, there was some noisy chatter but the moment Ye Wan Wan appeared, it was like the stereo had been turned down and there was immediate silence.Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t wear her green wig today and her makeup was also very light.

Ye Wan Wan looked through the entire paper before starting to answer the questions.Si Xia had a glimmer of amazement in his eyes when he realized that the Ye Wan Wan seated next to him actually picked up a pen to start writing.Everybody knew that Ye Wan Wan handed in blank booklet every time.While he was in shock, he saw how Ye Wan Wan answered the questions and his mouth started twitching.How is she answering the questions? She\u2019s clearly filling in the blanks blindly.She\u2019s filling up the booklet so fast, randomly selecting ABCD, probably not even reading questions and relying on luck.The boy called her an idiot mockingly in his heart.If you want to rely on luck, why not fill in B for every question? There\u2019s a higher chance of getting them right, rather than filling them up randomly which could potentially get you all the wrong answers.The boy stopped paying attention to the moron next to him and started concentrating on the exam.The duration of the comprehensive liberal arts exam was 150 minutes, taking up the entire morning. The English exam followed in the afternoon.The Language exam was on the morning of the second day and the last exam was math.Ye Wan Wan stared at the math questions, looking at them again and again. The functions, algebra and geometry were like a virus causing her brain to break down.The world around Ye Wan Wan started spinning and she saw stars around her. After being in a frenzy for 3 seconds, she gave up on her answers and started to take a nap.Why must there be such a scary thing like math in this world?!Although she had a photographic memory, she barely had enough time to finish reading three years worth of textbooks. It was absolutely impossible to excel in math in such a short time, so she simply chose to give up.The bell rang and the last exam came to an end.Si Xia glanced at his neighbour and realized that she was fast asleep on a completely blank math booklet.Judging by how she did at the beginning, I thought that maybe she wanted to make a change. Sure enough, as the saying goes, you can change mountains and rivers but not a person\u2019s nature!After submitting the exam booklets, all the students looked as if their bodies were depleted.\u201cFinally, the exams are over!

The names of the students were sealed and the teachers didn\u2019t mark the exams of their own classes. After they finished marking, the teachers would then unseal the names to tabulate the scores and rankings.That night was destined to be a sleepless night, as everyone was comparing their answers nervously and guessing their results.As for Ye Wan Wan, she rushed back to the dormitory immediately to make up her sleep debt after submitting her last exam.The next morning.Liang Li Hua entered the classroom, beaming.In the morning, she had visited the Student Affairs office even before looking at the students\u2019 results.

I seem to remember that there is a clause in the rules that if there is significant contrition shown by the student, it is appropriate to avoid punishment and give the student a chance to be rehabilitated.\u201dLiang Li Hua laughed coldly, \u201cYes, that\u2019s a clause but so what? How is that relevant to you? Look at how horrendous you look, neither ghost nor human.

Is this what a teacher should be doing, mocking a person\u2019s appearance? I think that you should take a look at my results first before talking. What if I end up at the top of the class this time?\u201dLiang Li Hua was stunned at first and then broke out in laughter. The rest of the students also roared with laughter together.\u201cHahahahaha wow! What did this ugly freak Ye Wan Wan just say? Top of the class? Who gave her the courage to say such a thing?!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s an idiot!

She slammed the stack of exam booklets in her hands. After searching for a long time, she finally managed to find Ye Wan Wan\u2019s name and took her result slip out of the pile, \u201cGood!

I see that you\u2019re the type of person who will not weep until you see the coffin!\u201dThe result slip showed every student\u2019s result for each subject, including the total marks and the marks for each major question.

She said expressionlessly, \u201cThere\u2019s still language, liberal arts, and English.\u201dShe remembered that language, English, and especially liberal arts exams were very challenging this time. Much uncommon knowledge was tested which could cause the differences in scores to widen.

Many students also gathered outside the door to watch.One of the teachers said, \u201cEven though the questions on the liberal arts exam were tricky, they were within the scope of the curriculum\u2014they were topics covered beforehand. There are many smart students in Qing He and Ye Wan Wan was not the only one who obtained full marks.

Could you explain how this happened?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen those two questions before and simply memorized the answers. The first question for the reading comprehension came from XX year of province A\u2019s 6 Schools Union senior year examination paper and the second question came from XX year of the National 13 Schools senior year second simulation examination.\u201d Ye Wan Wan answered quickly.Hearing Ye Wan Wan cite the sources of the 2 questions, Feng Rui An\u2019s eyes glistened, \u201cNot bad, the sources of these 2 questions are indeed correct. Since these two were originally thought to be too difficult, teachers didn\u2019t cover them in classes before. However, the topics of these two reading comprehension questions were quite good, so they were chosen for the exam. You, little girl, have you done even these two sets of questions?\u201dFor reading comprehension, teachers only taught the method to answer questions\u2014they never got students to memorize topics since after all, they would never pick those exact questions for the entrance exams.In the end, Ye Wan Wan memorized the answers for reading comprehension?As the teachers discussed amongst themselves, a sleepy man about 30 years old, walked in leisurely in his slippers, \u201cIf the test questions were leaked, why did you score 0 for my math?\u201dThe head of student affairs looked at the sloppy appearance of this guy, furrowed her brows and said, \u201cTeacher Zhao, this is a school, please be mindful of your appearance!\u201dZhao Xing Zhou yawned, \u201cI don\u2019t have classes in the morning anyway\u2026\u201dAlthough the head of student affairs couldn\u2019t stand the sight of him, she didn\u2019t say anything further. This Zhao Xing Zhou may be untidy but since the math results of F class were always top in the school, even the principal turned a blind eye to him.Liang Li Hua said impatiently, \u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t manage to memorize the math exam answers. Anyway, why would any normal person memorize the reading comprehension answers when they weren\u2019t the questions that teachers asked students to complete? Besides, the problem now is that she cheated; there is no running away from this point now!\u201dThe head of student affairs looked at the girl with a serious expression and interrogated her, \u201cYe Wan Wan, where did you get the exam questions?\u201dYe Wan Wan was expressionless, \u201cI got them when the exam papers were given out.\u201dLiang Li Hua raged, \u201cLook, everybody, she\u2019s still lying!\u201dYe Wan Wan looked coldly at Liang Li Hua, \u201cTeacher Liang, if you claim that I cheated, please provide proof.

Chop. That. Arm. Off!!Translator: eunimon_ Editor: Caron_Everyone\u2019s eyes glistened when Liang Li Hua mentioned the theatrical performance\u2013especially the girls in the class.For this performance, the girls in the class had been having a catfight for quite some time.The reason behind why the female lead was still undecided was because some girls fought too hard over it previously.Many students in the class had families with notable backgrounds, resulting in total chaos. They secretly bought votes, threatened students to vote for them and even almost caused a fight directly in school. It caused Liang Li Hua to be in a terrible position, tossed from side to side. Thus, she\u2019d postponed the decision of female lead until after exams.After much thought, she decided that drawing lots would be the most effective and the girls wouldn\u2019t have to fight anymore.So Liang Li Hua continued,\u201dTo be fair and to ensure that every student has an opportunity to participate, I have decided that we will draw lots to decide on the candidate! Nobody is allowed to disagree!\u201d\u201cTeacher, I agree!\u201d\u201cMe too, let\u2019s go by drawing lots then!\u201dAll the students agreed with Liang Li Hua\u2019s decision.The girls who had lower chances initially would now have an equal opportunity. Since everybody was on equal grounds now, naturally most students would agree to this.Only the few girls who had higher chances glared, especially the class beauty, Cheng Xue, who was always teased by the class to pair up with Si Xia.Liang Li Hua heaved a sigh of relief with the outcome. She instructed the class monitor to write down the names of every girl in the class on small pieces of paper and then placed them into a little box.\u201cFor this title, let\u2019s get Si Xia to draw it!\u201d Liang Li Hua said.Otherwise, if it was drawn by someone else, those girls would be unhappy again.All the girls nodded their heads in total agreement.Wow! The hunk himself is drawing the lot!The person who\u2019s chosen\u2026 must have saved the Milky Way in their previous life!The class monitor carried the box over, \u201cSi Xia.\u201dSi Xia was feeling depressed at the moment and was not in the mood. Under the gaze of many eager students, he casually slipped his hand into the box to draw a lot and tossed it to the class monitor without looking at it.The monitor took that slip of paper and was almost burnt by the glare of the girls\u2019 eyes.\u201cOh, the person Si Xia has drawn is\u2026\u201d the monitor opened the small slip of paper carefully while speaking.Just as he was about to read the name\u2026The monitor stared at the paper and stood rooted to the ground with his eyes big and mouth gaping wide as if he had been struck by lightning.Si Xia noticed that the monitor\u2019s expression was odd, so he raised his brows and looked over.The expression on the monitor\u2019s face gave him a bad feeling\u2026At this moment, the monitor didn\u2019t dare look in the eyes of Si Xia and was even more afraid to look at the girls\u2019 expressions. At everyone\u2019s insistence, he then swallowed hard and stammered, \u201cThe\u2026 The one who was drawn is\u2026 Ye.. Ye Wan Wan\u2026 \u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d the boy snatched the paper from the monitor.On the paper was \u201cYe Wan Wan\u201d, three words as clear as day.Ye Wan Wan woke up to the noise next to her, wiped the saliva off the sides of her mouth, opened her eyes in a daze and looked at her partner, \u201cWhat is it\u2026\u201dSi Xia looked at the girl\u2019s frightening face with hair as messy as Sadako\u2019s, the way she drooled and her half-opened eyes: \u201c\u2026\u201dI.

How on earth did you draw that lot?\u201dThe class monitor faced the girls\u2019 criticism with a speechless expression, \u201cIt..

There was no way she could replace her with someone else.Liang Li Hua didn\u2019t have a choice. She looked at Si Xia and asked, \u201cSi Xia, what do you think? She will be your partner after all.\u201dAt this moment, the boy held on to that slip of paper, still in disbelief that he actually drew that lot himself.He probably had never been through such a tough decision in his life.After some time, the boy forced a word out through his teeth, \u201cWhatever.\u201dI picked the lot with my own hand, how can I go back on my words now?All the girls were anxious after hearing Si Xia\u2019s reply; they all wanted Liang Li Hua to arrange for a re-draw.Liang Li Hua glanced at Ye Wan Wan\u2019s unpleasant appearance, pondered for a moment, then said, \u201cClass, please be quiet. I have already mentioned that to be fair, we will go according to the outcome of the draw. Since even Si Xia doesn\u2019t mind, then the female lead is set and no one\u2019s allowed to talk about it any further!\u201dRight now the concern was not if Ye Wan Wan would cause trouble, but instead, it was a matter of when .With that thought, Liang Li Hua turned to Ye Wan Wan and warned, \u201cThe performance this time is very important. If you mess up, even I won\u2019t be able to help you!\u201dOnly then did Ye Wan Wan wake up.How did she manage to be chosen to play Snow White and become a thorn to the other girls just by taking a nap?The Ye Wan Wan from before had been captured by Si Ye Han due to that love letter at this point, so she hadn\u2019t had to deal with this before and was completely caught off-guard.If I had known sooner, I would definitely have stopped it from happening!With Si Ye Han\u2019s possessiveness and jealousy, if he finds out that I will be playing a role as someone else\u2019s lover, and that there is even a kissing scene at the end\u2026Isn\u2019t this considered cheating?!\u201cDamn! How did I get tangled up in this while doing nothing?!\u201d Ye Wan Wan grabbed her hair in distress and almost broke down.Seeing his partner Ye Wan Wan reacting like that, Si Xia\u2019s face turned black.Who exactly was the one who got tangled up in this beyond their control?Is this woman actually acting like she\u2019s the unlucky one?\u201cWait\u2026 Miss! May I give this role up?\u201d Ye Wan Wan quickly raised her hand.Upon hearing that, the girls were immediately enraged again.What! Ye Wan Wan, the ugly freak! Our hunk hasn\u2019t even abandoned her, yet she dares to leave the play!Liang Li Hua\u2019s face filled with fury instantly, \u201cYe Wan Wan, how dare you treat the school as your own home? Doing whatever you please? Without any rules? Don\u2019t forget that you\u2019re still on probation!\u201dYe Wan Wan muttered a curse after Liang Li Hua threatened her, \u201cDamn!\u201dAt that moment, the boy next to her could not hold it in any longer, \u201cYe Wan Wan! Exactly who is the person who was damned?\u201dYe Wan Wan looked sceptically at the school\u2019s hunk who was about to explode in anger because of her. Resting her chin on her hands, she muttered in utter distress, \u201cBut I have a boyfriend. If my boyfriend finds out and gets jealous then what should I do?

As always, he had on a black suit darker than the night sky. The neckline of dark silver stripes glowed with a cold luster and his deep eyes looked as if they had been submerged in a pool of ice for years, with no trace of humanity.Her ordinary female hostel suddenly became an 18-storey hell with hundreds of ghosts whistling and the chair that the man was sitting on was no longer the same cheaply lacquered chair, but a dragon king throne wrapped with a black giant python\u2026Si\u2026 Si Ye Han!!!Bang\u2014\u2014 Ye Wan Wan slammed the bathroom door hard.It must\u2019ve been the way I opened the door!How could it have become hell in a moment!One second went by\u2026Two seconds went by\u2026Three seconds went by\u2026Ye Wan Wan\u2019s heart was beating hard, her blood flowing the opposite direction and her mind was completely blank.After a full minute, she finally eased her mind slightly and carefully opened the bathroom door a little.In the end, she was scared out of her wits with just one look!Not only was Si Ye Han still there, but he became scarier after seeing that she slammed the door in fear. The whole hostel was frozen by that pair of cold and dark eyes. She could even see the bright blue flames from the great devil\u2019s head.Help\u2014\u2014Out of instinct for survival and due to the fear penetrating into her bones, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s first reaction was to run in the direction of the doorway!However, just as her fingers curled around the lock, she regained her senses under her immense fear\u2014\u2014 she couldn\u2019t run!Damn! What should I do now!Beads of sweat were trickling down Ye Wan Wan\u2019s forehead and her mind was racing.Quickly, she turned the lock in the other direction and locked the door instead.After taking a deep breath discreetly, Ye Wan Wan suppressed the fear in her eyes. Then, she turned around and walked towards Si Ye Han\u2026Under that man\u2019s glare that could almost freeze human bones, Ye Wan Wan stopped in front of him.

She found the school\u2019s blanket quite uncomfortable so she bought a new one at the small supermarket opposite the school. It was much softer but the big blossoming peonies imprinted on it were very conspicuous.And right now, Si Ye Han was lying on that little bed that didn\u2019t match him, with a peony-printed blanket over his body.Ye Wan Wan strangely found that with him lying there, the gaudy peony flowers now appeared quite elegant.\u201cHey\u2026 Are you sleeping here?\u201d\u201cCome over,\u201d the man didn\u2019t answer her question but beckoned her over instead.\u201cOh,\u201d Ye Wan Wan swallowed hard and walked over obediently.Then, she was pulled into his embrace and they laid down together.Ye Wan Wan: \u201c\u2026\u201dNot only is he sleeping over but he\u2019s forcing me to sleep with him\u2013 what is he trying to do?!There were sounds of people walking back and forth and girls laughing and talking merrily outside.

His hair looked as if it was dyed black by the night sky, his facial features were chiseled, his skin was flawlessly perfect, his thin lips were thin yet extremely nice, each individual strand of hair showed the extreme favor of the Creator, and especially since he loosened the tie on his collar, exposing a section of his clavicle\u2026Aside from feeling fearful, Ye Wan Wan found that lying next to such a perfect being was really torturous.Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t know how long to recite for. In the end, she was so tired that she fell asleep unknowingly.Finally, she was awoken in shock by a knock on the door.\u201cDong dong dong,\u201d the knocks were very loud in the quiet room.Damn!

She was so beautiful that she couldn\u2019t peel her eyes away.Although she already knew that Ye Wan Wan looked great after she slimmed down, she hadn\u2019t seen her original looks for quite some time, so now she was taken aback.Shen Meng Qi was also recognised in school as a beauty and definitely the beauty of Class A. But standing before Ye Wan Wan now, even if she put in a maximum amount of effort, she would only be one-tenth of the beauty of Ye Wan Wan in her casual pyjamas.Shen Meng Qi\u2019s expression was hard to read and she seemed to be losing her cool. She tried hard to talk with her usual intimate tone and said sweetly, \u201cWan Wan, what took you so long to open the door?\u201d\u201cWas asleep.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s only around 8, you\u2019re asleep so early!\u201d Shen Meng Qi responded in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s so late, do you have something for me?\u201d Ye Wan Wan asked.\u201cI\u2019m obviously here to chit-chat with you! Don\u2019t stand at the door, let\u2019s talk in the room!\u201d Shen Meng Qi didn\u2019t linger any longer and invited herself in.Ye Wan Wan furrowed her brows. Before she was reborn, she couldn\u2019t wait to have Shen Meng Qi to come over for some chit-chat. Each time she\u2019d try to get Shen Meng Qi to chat till midnight. If she stopped her from coming in this time, it would seem like she was trying to hide something and so, she let her in.If she had known it was Shen Meng Qi at the door, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered even if she saw Si Ye Han.But\u2026This time, Shen Meng Qi didn\u2019t know that Si Ye Han was around, which was even better!Ye Wan Wan rolled her eyes while planning secretly.This mischief-maker, Shen Meng Qi, was a traitor by her side. She was too much of a hindrance and it was about time to remove her.After entering the room, as if to deliberately trigger Shen Meng Qi, Ye Wan Wan took out a small mirror and constantly checked herself out smugly.Shen Meng Qi\u2019s face changed after seeing that. She stared at Ye Wan Wan sternly and scolded, \u201cWan Wan! You\u2019re too careless! Why\u2019d you go to the door without makeup? What if the person outside wasn\u2019t me?

She was very popular in entertainment circles and later, the whole Shen family shared the spotlight as well. Moving from being a small company to becoming part of the A-lister crowd meant a leap into the royal family.Now all Ye Wan Wan wanted to do was destroy the trust that Si Ye Han had for Shen Meng Qi.She\u2019s trying to undermine my relationship with Si Ye Han?

All my efforts were wasted in helping you contact Mr Gu and distracting the servants in Jin garden!\u201dYe Wan Wan listened, sighed and pretended to speak with great emotion, \u201cMeng Qi, I know that your heart was broken for me. You helped me come up with the idea to dress atrociously to hide from Si Ye Han. It was you who\u2019s been trying to help me escape and it was also you who helped me pass messages on to Gu Yue Ze\u2026\u201dShen Meng Qi saw that Ye Wan Wan was still so foolish. Shen Meng Qi had a look of mockery in her eyes but her sincere face remained, \u201cWan Wan, you\u2019re my best friend. If I don\u2019t help you, who would? So listen to me, don\u2019t be at odds with Mr Gu anymore. It was so hard for you to leave Jin garden, you should take this chance to find Mr Gu. Otherwise, if this goes on, when are you ever going to get Mr Gu back?!\u201dYe Wan Wan managed to pry out everything she wanted Si Ye Han to hear and was finally satisfied. She maintained her composure, looked in the direction of the bathroom and then slowly replied, \u201cWho said that I wanted to get him back?\u201dShen Meng Qi was shocked at what she heard and furrowed her brows, \u201cMr Gu was obviously your fiance but was stolen away by your cousin. Of course you have to get him back! Are you going to give up just like that? How could you! Wouldn\u2019t that be letting Ye Yi Yi off easy?\u201dYe Wan Wan smiled wryly at how anxious Shen Meng Qi was. She touched her own features tenderly in the mirror and said faintly, \u201cGetting back a tattered and unwanted pair of shoes? Is that necessary? If Ye Yi Yi thinks she has gotten the upper hand then let her be.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ye Yi Yi was to blame for everything; her father snatched the Ye family away and she shamelessly snatched your fiance. Mr. Gu didn\u2019t have a choice! What happened exactly? Why do you think this way all of a sudden?\u201dWith Wan Wan\u2019s undying love for Gu Yue Ze, to the point of even cutting ties with her parents, how could she give up just like that?Ye Wan Wan simply replied, \u201cNothing much, I\u2019ve just thought things through.\u201dShen Meng Qi hurriedly tried to convince her, \u201cWan Wan, don\u2019t be impulsive, you\u2019ve had feelings for him for so many years after all\u2026\u201dYe Wan Wan yawned, obviously not interested in continuing this topic and interrupted, \u201cI\u2019m tired, it\u2019s time to sleep. I\u2019ll chat with you again next time!\u201dShen Meng Qi wanted to say more but Ye Wan Wan was already lying in bed yawning, so she could only leave.Why do I get the sense that after Ye Wan Wan returned to school, something\u2019s changed\u2026In the past, she said everything she thought but now, she\u2019s much more controlled and even her attitude\u2019s become more nonchalant.After she was sure that Shen Meng Qi was gone, Ye Wan Wan got up and walked to the bathroom.The conversation she had with Shen Meng Qi just now probably allowed her to achieve half of her objective.Of course, she wanted to take this chance to express her heartfelt feelings towards Si Ye Han but with Si Ye Han\u2019s cunning, he\u2019d think that she was aware he was around so she said all those things deliberately for him to hear.So she wouldn\u2019t insist that he believes her. As long as he heard everything that Shen Meng Qi said just now, that would suffice.Ye Wan Wan pulled open the bathroom door and quickly invited the great devil out, \u201cSorry, sorry! That person is gone! It was Meng Qi; I thought it\u2019d be the dormitory in-charge making his rounds! It gave me quite a scare!\u201dWhen Ye Wan Wan opened the door, Si Ye Han\u2019s tall body was leaning against the basin. In the basket beside it was the pile of clothes that she\u2019d washed and at the very top was her strawberry printed bra.Ye Wan Wan was instantly embarrassed so she quickly took a towel and covered it. Then, she observed Si Ye Han\u2019s expression.However, an ordinary person like her wouldn\u2019t be able to decipher his thoughts so easily. There was no expression on the man\u2019s face and she couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking about.Si Ye Han looked at her for a few seconds, then he caressed the delicate jaws of the girl with his fingers, his low voice lingering in the narrow washroom, \u201cSix hours and then I\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d\u201cAh?

So that she had to obediently agree to such an unfair contract since she was in the wrong\u2026Also, after hearing the conversation just now, why didn\u2019t Si Ye Han have any reaction at all?It couldn\u2019t be that he didn\u2019t hear anything right?Her head hurt from thinking. When she turned her head, she realised that he was sleeping soundly.Could it be that she was wrong all along?Si Ye Han\u2019s sleeping pattern seemed to be very normal! He didn\u2019t look like a sick person\u2026Ye Wan Wan was still entertaining her foolish thoughts and couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Finally, she was infected by Si Ye Han\u2019s drowsiness and fell asleep unknowingly.Late at night.The man on the bed opened his eyes lazily like a satisfied beast.But even after just waking up, his pupils were still fierce and cold.Until\u2026 He suddenly felt something unusually soft in his embrace and his fierce expression relaxed and he lowered his head to look.Under the warm glow of the moonlight, he saw a girl snuggling in his arms like a little kitten, sleeping soundly.For a moment, his cold empty chest was suddenly filled and his suspended heart returned to his body.The man\u2019s arms tightened but since he was afraid he\u2019d wake the girl in his arms, he quickly relaxed. He stared at the person in his embrace with a complex look on his face.Ever since that night, she became more and more difficult to figure out\u2026Although he liked the change, the intoxicating sweetness was too unreal, causing him to feel uneasy.It was like he was a traveller who had walked in the desert for too long and suddenly saw an oasis\u2013in the next second, he might find out that this was all just an illusion, a transient glimmer of hope.At that moment, the phone by his side started flashing, indicating a new message.Si Ye Han\u2019s eyes turned dark and opened the message.The sender was Shen Meng Qi\u2014\u2014 [Mr Si, I went to visit Ye Wan Wan last night and tried very hard to convince her. However, she still seemed to be mad at you. Mr Gu was her fiance after all, so it\u2019s understandable that she\u2019s unable to get over him so quickly.

Initially, Shen Meng Qi got close to Ye Wan Wan and her brother because Mr Shen incited it, just so he could have a closer relationship with Ye Shao Ting.Shen Meng Qi didn\u2019t let him down\u2013she gained the trust of Ye Wan Wan and even settled things with Ye Mu Fan.Seeing that Si Ye Han wasn\u2019t replying, Xu Yi hesitated for a moment and continued, \u201cThis girl has bad intentions for staying by Ms Ye\u2019s side. She deliberately interfered with the relationship between you and Ms Ye. Do you really want such a person to continue being by Ms Ye\u2019s side? Although she\u2019s just a little girl, nothing to be afraid of, her influence on Ms Ye is too great.\u201dSi Ye Han listened and his gaze slowly turned icy and shot a razor-sharp look forward, \u201cYou think that the relationship between us could be ended by just anybody?\u201dXu Yi\u2019s back stiffened from that cold glare and he wished he could cry to the heavens\u2014\u2014 Exaggeration much?

After some time, he finally closed his eyes and suppressed the almost uncontrollable rage to kill.Seeing this, Xu Yi understood in his heart.Shen Meng Qi was Ye Wan Wan\u2019s only support after all.Ye Wan Wan had such a stubborn temperament but was willing to submit to the master and plead for his help on Shen Meng Qi\u2019s behalf.Previously, she even starved for three days to allow Shen Meng Qi to freely enter and leave Jin garden.If master laid a hand on Shen Meng Qi, that would just cause a world war!Although Shen Meng Qi had some ill intentions, her role was irreplaceable. If not for Shen Meng Qi, that Ye Wan Wan would\u2019ve run away so many times.Actually, he still didn\u2019t quite understand why his master was so attached to Ye Wan Wan\u2013 could it be because she was unattainable?Right now, I can only wish that Ye Wan Wan straightens out her thinking. This way, even with Shen Meng Qi\u2019s troublemaking, it won\u2019t be a problem. Wasn\u2019t that the case for the love letter incident previously?Maybe after master finally gets this girl, he\u2019ll realise that there was nothing special about her after all.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It wouldn\u2019t be so easy for Shen Meng Qi to cause trouble for her again.She would slowly let Si Ye Han know that his informant had lost its effectiveness\u2026After she thought that through, Ye Wan Wan was relieved and got up to get ready for the day.The green wig and body tattoos were back in business. Wearing a t-shirt studded with sequins, distressed pants with more than ten holes complete with Gothic makeup, her look stood out.The amount of head turns she received also proved her shocking appearance.On the way to the canteen, she bumped into Shen Meng Qi.\u201cWan Wan, I was about to find you, let\u2019s have breakfast together!\u201d Shen Meng Qi immediately hooked arms with her intimately.Looking at Ye Wan Wan\u2019s look, Shen Meng Qi\u2019s eyes lit up and appeared to be very satisfied.Seems like Ye Wan Wan did listen to what I said last night!When they arrived at the canteen, all the students around them were watching and whispering.\u201cLook, look!

I heard that you topped the class for this exam?\u201dIn front of Ye Wan Wan was a large bowl of sweet potato purple rice porridge, two big meat buns, and a crepe with three pieces of meat, two eggs, a ham sausage, and fruit. She replied casually while eating, \u201cWell, it was just a test, no biggie.\u201dShen Meng Qi knew that Ye Wan Wan had a strong memory, but after she found out she topped the class, she was still very surprised, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you hate studying? Why are you working so hard all of a sudden?\u201dYe Wan Wan took a bite of her bun, \u201cI do hate it. I hate everything that\u2019s not challenging.\u201dShen Meng Qi\u2019s face turned dark and almost choked on her food by that remark.She studied so hard every single day to stay within the top ten in class. She was only third in class with her best efforts. This time, she didn\u2019t maintain her position and fell to ninth place.

Could it be that during that period, Ye Wan Wan started to develop feelings for Si Xia?Ye Wan Wan squinted her eyes slightly after hearing that.It seems like I have to settle the issue with Si Xia quickly, otherwise, Shen Meng Qi will use it for an essay.\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d Ye Wan Wan replied nonchalantly.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a commotion coming from the class.Then, a sudden strange silence.Ye Wan Wan stood three steps away from the classroom door and just as she was about to continue walking, she suddenly stopped and her eyes glanced at the door frame over her head.As she paused, there was total silence in the classroom, as if they were all anticipating a grand entrance.She was so unlucky the day before to land herself in big trouble with her classmates. If these people didn\u2019t pull a prank on her, she\u2019d be surprised.Ye Wan Wan wasn\u2019t nervous at all; she just continued to stand by the door.After some time, sure enough, some unrestrained heads peeked out to check and then, quickly and carefully went back in.Shortly after, the school bell rang, indicating the start of lessons.The man behind her said in a shock, \u201cAiyo damn!

He was immediately soaked through like a drowned rat.Zhao Xing Zhou was stunned for a second and then blew up, \u201cI\u2026 Damn! I just styled my hair this morning! Which brat did this?! I want a confession, NOW!\u201dA sigh of disappointment came from the classroom first, then many of them started panicking.Damn! Why was the math teacher the one who pushed the door open? We\u2019re screwed!Everyone in F class knew that you could offend the form teacher but you should never offend this teacher who seemed cheery and easygoing, otherwise, you\u2019d be tortured to death!Zhao Xing Zhou wiped the water off his face, \u201cNobody\u2019s confessing? Once I find out myself, then you\u2019ll be in very deep trouble!\u201dAfter a very long time, finally, three girls and a boy stood up cowering.\u201cFollow me to the office, the four of you!\u201dWhen they passed Ye Wan Wan, Zhao Xing Zhou glared at her for a few seconds with a veiled bitterness.Ye Wan Wan blinked her eyes and looked around innocently.After Zhao Xing Zhou dragged those troublemakers away, Ye Wan Wan walked straight to the seat next to Si Xia under all the hateful stares from the girls and sat down.Since they had rehearsal after class, Si Xia was wearing a British uniform with bright white bottoms and edges lined in gold. The restrictive neckline was fastened all the way up to the first button, quite in line with his character as a prince in the play.He also had that superior temperament and lofty arrogance he was born with.But it was no wonder, after all, since he was the only grandchild in the Si family and was severely doted on. Nobody could ignore him.Of course, this didn\u2019t include Ye Wan Wan.The moment he saw Ye Wan Wan, the boy\u2019s dazzling face turned green.Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t have time to bother with him and quickly took the chance to send some texts to Si Ye Han while the teacher wasn\u2019t around. She had to act before Shen Meng Qi did.Si Xia had a hard time recovering from that earth-shattering fright and then he saw Ye Wan Wan texting away. He peered at what she was typing\u2026[Darling, the school will be organizing an art performance and I was picked to be Snow White.

But strictly speaking, it was 9th master who unilaterally forced her right?

Cheng Xue led a group of blushing girls who swooned around Si Xia. They showed great concern about him and even comforted him since he was traumatized with the knowledge that he\u2019d have to partner up with Ye Wan Wan.\u201cThat teacher was too much, how could she simply draw lots to decide?\u201d\u201cExactly! She actually allowed Ye Wan Wan to perform\u2026 what an insult to Si Xia!\u201d\u201cSi Xia, don\u2019t be upset, why don\u2019t we go to the teacher and protest together?\u201d\u2026Ye Wan Wan was sucking on a lollipop at the door, listening to everything these girls were saying and the edges of her mouth curled up.Why did these girls make it look like Si Xia was the one about to be abused?His ears filled with the girls\u2019 chatter, Si Xia looked more and more icy, his forehead full of annoyance. Just as he was about to speak, an immediate silence fell upon the area.Looking at the door, sure enough, he saw that Ye Wan Wan was standing there.Once Ye Wan Wan appeared, she aroused the fury of the girls in an instant and some girls stormed towards her.\u201cYe Wan Wan, do you have no shame?! You really came!\u201d\u201cWe have a score to settle with you for what happened this morning!\u201d\u201cYou stole our Little Xue\u2019s role and still you act so cocky; you really think we can\u2019t touch you?\u201dYe Wan Wan scanned the three girls who came up to her.These three people were the ones who plotted the prank but the boy wasn\u2019t with them, probably because he had to bear full responsibility and was still being dealt with by Zhao Xing Zhou.These three girls were part of Cheng Xue\u2019s gang and that boy was like a big brother to Cheng Xue in school. They were quite powerful in Qing He and nobody dared to offend these school bullies.This time, if it hadn\u2019t been for her, whether through her family or by the network in school, Cheng Xue should\u2019ve had at least an 80% chance of getting this role.So it was no wonder that Cheng Xue hated her so badly.Cheng Xue was dressed in a DR, top-grade, custom-made lace dress and stood behind the girls protecting her. Her fair skin, bright almond eyes, and her mixed-blood facial features appeared delicate and defined. When she stood next to Si Xia, they made quite the couple, like a prince and princess from a fairytale.At that moment, the little face of Cheng Xue was filled with sorrow. Even when the resentment and jealousy in her eyes made her look darker and more ferocious, her beautiful appearance still aroused pity.Cheng Xue wasn\u2019t only the class beauty of F class but also the school beauty of Qing He High School.Ye Wan Wan remembered that this Cheng Xue had a complicated family and had known Si Xia since they were little. In her previous life, she remembered that they got engaged in the end.Ye Wan Wan\u2019s true age was already 27. When she saw this group of girls, it felt like she was fighting with children. She twitched her mouth and replied, \u201cTsk, just for a few seconds of interaction, is all this necessary?\u201dA few seconds of interaction!?There weren\u2019t a lot of appearances by the prince and Snow White together until Snow White ate the poison apple and fainted, after which the prince appeared in front of her.But!Those few seconds of interaction were a kissing scene!Thinking about it, Cheng Xue gritted her teeth. Ye Wan Wan\u2019s remark was deliberately provocative. \u201cYe Wan Wan! Watch yourself! Si Xia, do you really want to work with this person? \u201dHer tone was full of anger.Si Xia\u2019s face turned ugly, after all what could he do? As a man, how could he go back on his words?\u201cAll right, I was the one who drew the lot so all of you shut up and start rehearsing.

Then the final act came and someone went to carefully wake him up.\u201cThat\u2026 Si Xia, it\u2019s your turn\u2026\u201dThe next part of the play was when the seven dwarves placed Snow White into the crystal glass coffin and the prince from the neighbouring country rushed over on a white horse and kissed Snow White affectionately to revive her.Si Xia furrowed his brows, opened his eyes and was greeted by everyone\u2019s sympathetic and pitiful gaze like they were in mourning.What kind of look is that?Ye Wan Wan jumped onto the table prepared for her. With her legs dangling off the side, she pulled out her makeup bag and remarked, \u201cGive me a moment, let me touch up!\u201dShe darkened her eyeshadow, applied more blush and put on purple lipstick. The effect was striking to the max!\u201cOK, I\u2019m ready.\u201d Ye Wan Wan laid down on her back after applying her lipstick.Under the murderous glares from the girls, Si Xia tousled his hair still messy from sleep, unbuttoned the top button on his collar and walked towards the girl.Seeing the girl\u2019s green explosive wig, ghastly heavy metal makeup, non-mainstream skeleton tattoos and purplish-black lips, the boy felt queasy.Bearing in mind the idea that an early death meant early relief, Si Xia took a deep breath and slowly lowered his body\u2026He drew the lot himself, so he had to go on even if he had to kneel!\u201cAh, don\u2019t!\u201d The girl was so frightened that she closed her eyes immediately as if the performance wasn\u2019t a fairytale but a horror movie.\u201cDamn. he\u2019s not really going to kiss her, right? We\u2019re only high school students\u2013we can\u2019t go that far! Just a little fake kiss would be enough!\u201d\u201cNonsense, of course a fake kiss is enough! But the problem is that the fake kiss alone is already quite hard to bear alright?\u201d\u2026Fake kiss? It was already a miracle that he was three steps away from her.Perhaps he lowered his body too much. Si Xia suddenly turned around and started coughing wildly. The girls around him looked distressed and quickly brought water and paper towels to him.Cheng Xue stared at Ye Wan Wan ferociously and was about to cry from seeing Si Xia\u2019s expression, \u201cSi Xia, don\u2019t make it so hard for yourself anymore, alright?\u201dYe Wan Wan got up instantaneously with a look of innocence, \u201cEh? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dSi Xia gulped down a whole bottle of water before he calmed down and said, \u201cYou\u2026 Change your lipstick\u2026\u201dYe Wan Wan blinked, \u201cAfter being poisoned by the poison apple, my lips would obviously turn purple. Be reasonable!\u201dThe boy looked like he was about to collapse, \u201cShut up, just do it!\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll change then~\u201d Ye Wan Wan pouted and gave the expression that he was being a pain. In the end, she still took out her makeup wipes and removed the purple lipstick for a relatively normal red shade.\u201cIs this okay?\u201dSi Xia closed his eyes, \u201cLet\u2019s try again.\u201d\u201cOrh.\u201d Ye Wan Wan could only lay down again.Si Xia walked towards Ye Wan Wan again and slowly leaned forward\u2026Staring at that face slathered with thick makeup and blood-red mouth, this time, Si Xia immediately rushed out of the classroom.After some time, Si Xia finally came back, looking as if his whole body had been emptied.Ye Wan Wan was somewhat speechless after seeing that. This guy was going too far; was it worth dying to protect his ego?It\u2019d be much less trouble to go straight to the teacher to request a change of partner; then I wouldn\u2019t have to put in so much effort as well!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She planned her makeup look for tomorrow and turned on her computer at the same time.She no longer needed to spend so much time on the school\u2019s curriculum. She was prepared to buy films and documentaries online and seize the time to do some self-directed studying.After all, getting into university was just the beginning. Her final goal was to get back everything that had been taken away from her father by her second uncle and Ye Yi Yi.Before, she only thought to blame her father for being useless and causing her to be separated from Gu Yue Ze. But little did she know that she was the one who brought the whole family down.That time, Ye Yi Yi used Gu Yue Ze\u2019s name to lure her to a deserted house and drugged her to make her dizzy. Then, her second uncle blackmailed her to pressure her father to give up his shares and confess to a crime of misappropriation of public funds, or else he\u2019d ruin her life. He was going to shoot her up with drugs, find a few men to fool around with her, and then leak a video of her drug abuse and sexual activity.Her father had doted on her since she was little, and the whole family treated her like a treasure and fulfilled all her wishes.While she was studying abroad, she almost lost her life due to a terrorist attack and was greatly traumatized. Her parents couldn\u2019t stop blaming themselves and immediately brought her back. They became more protective of her henceforth.Her parents\u2019 overprotectiveness probably caused her to become simple-minded and naive.Her father had already warned her not to leave the house by herself, but in order to meet Gu Yue Ze alone, she escaped the bodyguards and sneaked out anyway.It was, after all, Gu Yue Ze\u2019s invitation\u2013even if the skies rained down knives, she would still go. Not to mention that it was only her father\u2019s little warning holding her back.When faced with her second uncle\u2019s threats at the time, her father didn\u2019t hesitate to protect her and even sacrificed the entire Ye family.After that incident, her parents were afraid that she\u2019d blame herself, incapable of handling the trauma, so they kept the truth from her.She was so silly to think that Gu Yue Ze simply didn\u2019t keep their appointment that time and had no idea that her wayward behaviour had led to such serious consequences. She even cut ties with her parents for a scumbag who cancelled their marriage after her father lost everything.She had mistaken a jackal for love and mistaken her closest relatives as enemies\u2026At the thought of all this, Ye Wan Wan wanted to strangle herself to death.Dad\u2026 Mom\u2026 Wait for me\u2026I will get every single thing back from them!At this moment, a personalized ringtone on her phone rang\u2013it was Si Ye Han calling.Ye Wan Wan gathered her thoughts and steadied herself for the call.\u201cHello?\u201d\u201cHave you ended class?\u201d The usual low and cold voice came through the receiver.\u201cYup yup~ Class has finished~ We just finished rehearsal and the prince was so ugly that I nearly vomited on stage. At first, I wanted to tell the teacher to find a replacement but the teacher said that the results of the drawing of lots couldn\u2019t be changed\u2026\u201d Ye Wan Wan grumbled on. She deliberately revealed her whereabouts in school so that Si Ye Han had no reason to say that she was hiding something from him.The man on the other end listened patiently to what was going on in her school, and when she was finished, he asked, \u201cAre you free this Saturday?\u201d\u201cSaturday? I should have\u2026 Nothing going on\u2026\u201dThe school allowed students to go home every Saturday and Sunday. If Si Ye Han wanted her to go back, she didn\u2019t have any reason to decline. With this in mind, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s voice became slightly nervous.Even if it was only two days, what if she went back and never came back out\u2026Freedom was too important to her and she still had so many things she needed to do. She definitely didn\u2019t want to go back to her old life.\u201cGrandma wants to meet you.\u201d He probably anticipated her nervousness and repulsion, as his voice instinctively became more withdrawn.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Grandma\u2026\u201d Ye Wan Wan was stunned for a moment.At the same time, she also recalled some things that had happened before she was reborn.Before she was reborn, Si Ye Han had also brought her to meet his grandma.In the Si family, the person Si Ye Han was closest to was his grandmother. This old lady held a very high position in the family. Due to the premature death of Si Ye Han\u2019s father, she doted on and loved Si Ye Han the most. If Si Ye Han liked something, she would give her unconditional support.But in her previous life, she had offended this old lady thoroughly.In her previous life, when Si Ye Han\u2019s grandmother wanted to meet her, she couldn\u2019t help discussing it with Shen Meng Qi.Shen Meng Qi also put in quite a bit of effort and taught her all the ways to make the old lady loathe her. Naturally, she followed them all accordingly.Not only did she meet the lady in her atrocious makeup, she also put on a cold face from start to finish and didn\u2019t say a word at all.The old lady really loved her grandson so much that even when Ye Wan Wan met her with her horrendous look and presented herself without any proper manners, the old lady still didn\u2019t mind at all.That is, until Ye Wan Wan provoked the old lady\u2019s only trigger point, which was Si Ye Han.While she was at the old house, Shen Meng Qi suddenly called her to tell her that Gu Yue Ze had been in a car accident and was in a critical condition.How could Si Ye Han let her go to Gu Yue Ze?How the two of them ended up in a huge fight was predictable. She screamed and bit him like she was crazy and cursed him to die immediately.Hearing that she actually cursed Si Ye Han to death, the old lady was so mad that she fainted on the spot and hated her from that moment onwards.But she did manage to achieve her goal\u2013the old lady always nagged at Si Ye Han to leave her.But even with the old lady\u2019s words, Si Ye Han still didn\u2019t let her go.In the end, the old lady fell ill and passed away not long after. Even on her deathbed, her grandson\u2019s illness and the cancer that was by her grandson\u2019s side was still on her mind\u2026These thoughts made Ye Wan Wan feel horrible.Although she hated Si Ye Han, she could tell that the old lady was initially truly sincere towards her. She didn\u2019t mind even when she was so rude and didn\u2019t show any interest in her family\u2019s background\u2026There was a long silence over the phone and Si Ye Han\u2019s tone turned completely withdrawn, \u201cForget it.\u201dYe Wan Wan finally regained her conscience and hurriedly replied, \u201cGrandma wants to see me? Then we\u2019ll definitely have to go! I\u2019m just a little nervous\u2013it\u2019s my first time meeting your grandma after all! What does she like? Does she have any hobbies? What should I wear? Should I prepare a gift?\u201dHearing Ye Wan Wan ask so many questions at once, the man on the other end stayed silent for a long time.Ye Wan Wan was anxious, \u201cHello? Hello? Are you still there?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The man\u2019s tone was still a bit flat, \u201cYou\u2026 Want to go?\u201d\u201cWhy not? You haven\u2019t answered my questions!\u201d Ye Wan Wan asked.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to prepare anything, just wait for me to fetch you,\u201d Si Ye Han said.\u201cHow can we do that, this is my first time meeting a parent and first impressions are very important-you\u2019re too shabby!\u201d Ye Wan Wan was unsatisfied. \u201cHow about this, you can pick me up early on Saturday and then we can go shopping together!\u201dWhether it was because she felt guilty from her previous life or because the old lady was the only person who could restrain Si Ye Han, she decided it was imperative to build a good relationship with her.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The whole car was fixed up very comfortably.The man was in a tailored dark black suit, sitting on a snow-white velvet seat. His face was handsome and apathetic as usual. There was a faint shadow under his eyelids due to many sleepless nights, making him look a bit grim and intimidating.At that moment, the man was gazing out of the window, pondering about something.In the driver\u2019s seat, Xu Yi had two heavy dark circles around his eyes and a gloomy face. It was apparent that he had a sleepless night.He would never have imagined that master actually wanted to bring that Ye Wan Wan to meet old madam. Ever since he found out about this, he felt very uneasy.Isn\u2019t the master afraid that the woman\u2019s appearance will scare the living daylights out of Madam?Not to mention that woman\u2019s troublemaking temperament.Who\u2019s old madam you say? She\u2019s master\u2019s greatest help and supporter of him inheriting the family business. If things go poorly in the old house, the consequences would be extremely severe.Initially, he had always held onto a glimmer of hope, wishing that master was just fooling around and pursuing what he couldn\u2019t have. Who knew that master actually wanted to bring her to meet old madam?As the saying goes, marry a woman for her virtue. If master insists on being with this mentally unsound woman, he\u2019ll have to pay some exorbitant price someday.The more Xu Yi thought, the more he feared. He couldn\u2019t help but protest, \u201cMaster, there are some things that you won\u2019t like to hear but I have to remind you even if I risk losing my life. Do think twice before you act\u2013old madam is your closest kin and her words hold the most weight in the Si family. If old madam is hurt or offended, there will be dire consequences.If you were just keeping her privately in Jin garden then that\u2019s one thing, but she is a woman who you want to bring to meet old madam, which means that she\u2019s one of the candidates to become Si family\u2019s household headmistress in the future and with Miss Ye\u2019s personality, it\u2019s completely\u2026\u201dBefore Xu Yi could continue, an icy-cold voice came from the backseat and interrupted him with a strong sense of oppression, \u201cWho told you that\u2019s a possibility?\u201dA chill went down Xu Yi\u2019s spine from the sudden coldness and there was silence.The next second, the man\u2019s tone became colder and two frosty words were spat out of his thin lips, \u201cOnly one.\u201dThe only candidate.The moment the man\u2019s words left his mouth, Xu Yi shuddered.He opened his mouth wanting to speak but in the end, was suppressed by a ferocious glare so he didn\u2019t dare utter another word. He sat stiffly on his seat in disappointment, with the steering wheel in his hands.The atmosphere in the car froze like ice in an instant.Just as Xu Yi was preparing for the worse, the sound of light footsteps came from a distance.Xu Yi lifted up his bloodshot eyes towards the direction of the sound and saw a girl in Qing He\u2019s school uniform walking towards them from the back door.The girl didn\u2019t have any makeup on and was carrying a pale blue backpack. Her long, jet black hair was tied into a neat ponytail and she donned Qing He\u2019s blue and white long sleeve shirt and trousers, which looked a little odd and hadn\u2019t been designed to be aesthetically pleasing. But due to the girl\u2019s jade-like, translucent fair complexion, she exuded a teenage girl\u2019s vibrancy and liveliness.Unlike the exquisitely dressed socialites\u2019 daughters that he was accustomed to, she made people\u2019s eyes light up, like a clear stream.After seeing clearly who it was, Xu Yi was dumbfounded in disbelief.That\u2026 That is\u2026 Ye Wan Wan!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Most of them would appreciate a neat, clean and well-behaved girl.There was no other type of clothing that would give off a more obedient vibe than a school uniform.As for her face, aside from using a mask last night and performing her usual skincare routine, she didn\u2019t put on any makeup. Her hair was tied into a ponytail, showing off her beautiful forehead.Seeing that she wasn\u2019t the frightening female ghost that he\u2019d imagined but a vibrant and likeable girl, Xu Yi was stunned for a long time before reacting. He stumbled clumsily out of the car to open the door of the back seat and then observed her through his rearview mirror with a baffled look.Ye Wan Wan\u2019s former favourite pastime was to go against the master, taking advantage of his affection for her. No matter how absurd her actions were, the master would always give in to her.She had such a good opportunity to cause trouble today but she actually dressed so\u2026 normally?This Ye Wan Wan\u2026 has been acting too weird recently, what exactly is she planning?After Ye Wan Wan got in the car, she took a seat next to Si Ye Han.Once she got in, she couldn\u2019t help but click her tongue in appreciation. You couldn\u2019t tell from the exterior of the car but the interior was fixed up like a presidential suite of a hotel.The members of the Si family had put in a lot of effort just so Si Ye Han could live in comfort.\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019ll be staying over; I didn\u2019t finish my homework so I brought it along.\u201dYe Wan Wan placed her backpack on her lap and explained while burying her head in her bag to dig out a little booklet, and hastily said, \u201cThis is the list of gifts I came up with. I\u2019m planning to head to Wan Chun hall to get some herbal supplements and then go to the mall to get some clothes, bags, scarves or something for Grandma. But I\u2019m not sure about Grandma\u2019s preferences so you\u2019ll have to help me out a bit. Also, I\u2019m broke so I\u2019ll pick out the gifts but you have to fork out the money\u2026\u201dThe girl had basically run over so there was a thin layer of sweat on her forehead. The way she stared at her little booklet and spoke at that moment was unusually focused with a glimmer in her eyes.Wan Wan, if you are lying to me\u2026You better be able to guarantee\u2026To lie to me forever\u2026Ye Wan Wan was about to continue speaking when she felt her chin being lifted up. His crisp breath drifted over her face gradually; the man\u2019s handsome, enchanting face increasingly loomed closer and then there came a sharp pain on her lips.Feeling a hint of imperceptible danger, Ye Wan Wan was in complete confusion \u2013what\u2019s wrong with this guy? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, did I?Could it be because of how I\u2019m dressed?Thinking that Si Ye Han didn\u2019t like her appearance, Ye Wan Wan could only play along, \u201cHey, you don\u2019t like how I\u2019m dressed? Since we\u2019re meeting grandma today and the elderly certainly wouldn\u2019t like a girl with heavy makeup on, I didn\u2019t apply any so you\u2019ll have to put up with that a little\u2026\u201dHearing that the girl actually dressed like that on purpose for grandma, Si Ye Han was taken aback.His gaze skimmed over the girl\u2019s cheeks, neck and waist that was enclosed in her school uniform and a strange heat rose from beneath his cold eyes. All of a sudden, he kissed her again, and unlike before when he skimmed the surface, he was now overbearing and even slightly rough, aggressively violating every part of her mouth\u2026His actions showed quite clearly how he felt about her appearance.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With Si Ye Han\u2019s stringent checks for the other items, everything went smoothly.Actually, what she bought wasn\u2019t important since the old lady had no lack of material things\u2013they were all just a courtesy.After picking the gifts, the car slowly drove off in the direction of the Si family\u2019s old house.Almost an hour later, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s eyes fell upon the familiar estate.The estate was a Chinese-style manor, ancient and magnificent. After the car entered the big curved gate, it continued on for about 10 minutes before reaching the main house.At the door of the main house was an old housekeeper dressed in a creaseless uniform and gold-rimmed spectacles, awaiting their arrival.Upon seeing the arrival of Si Ye Han\u2019s car, the old housekeeper immediately stepped forward, bowed and greeted respectfully, \u201c9th master!\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d Si Ye Han responded without a trace of expression.The old housekeeper spoke while taking a glance at the girl next to Si Ye Han.Young master was unsociable, aloof, eccentric and moody and also abhorred women who got close to him. The old madam had previously plotted numerous solutions but all failed to instigate any emotional connections with any girls.But now, young master actually had a girlfriend and even brought her to the old house! Not only was it shocking to the old madam, all the servants were also in disbelief.When he saw that the girl beside young master was in her school uniform, the old housekeeper was even more surprised.Young master actually fell for such a young girl?He thought that young master would fall in love with a woman like Ms Ruoxi, who was elegant and sophisticated.However, even though this girl looked rather young, she had clear eyes, a graceful disposition and her face was definitely glowing, even without any makeup.Just going by her appearance, she was quite compatible with the young master but the housekeeper wasn\u2019t sure about her character yet.Since she was brought back personally by the young master, the old housekeeper\u2019s attitude was very respectful. He quickly nodded and said, \u201cI guess this would be Ms Ye. Hello, I am the housekeeper of the old house, Zhong Li.\u201d\u201cHello, housekeeper Zhong.\u201d Ye Wan Wan greeted him politely without any further words.As she was entering the house for the first time, it was better to remain reserved.Ye Wan Wan looked at the old housekeeper and was overcome by emotions. This old housekeeper in her previous life wasn\u2019t so polite the first time he met her.Previously, when the old housekeeper saw her explosive green wig and atrocious makeup, his face turned green and he clutched his chest, almost fainting on the spot from shock.Compared to old madam Si who could still chat with her warmly and pleasantly after seeing her appearance\u2013she really was something!The old housekeeper saw Ye Wan Wan standing obediently next to Si Ye Han, reserved and shy, and he liked her even more. \u201c9th young master, Ms Ye, quickly come inside, old madam has been waiting the whole day!\u201dFinally, as she stepped into this place again, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s pupils contracted and she clenched her fist subconsciously as the horrible memories of the past came flooding back uncontrollably\u2026Can I really change everything in this life?Just as Si Ye Han was about to step inside, he paused and his spine stiffened.He lowered his deep and quiet eyes, his gaze falling on his left hand and saw the girl\u2019s little hand clutching his unexpectedly.As Si Ye Han paused all of a sudden, Ye Wan Wan then realised that because she was so nervous, she\u2019d grabbed onto the closest thing to her, which turned out to be Si Ye Han\u2019s hand.Ye Wan Wan was a little embarrassed, wanting to retract her hand.But before she could move, the man had already solidified his grip on her hand and continued walking.Feeling his palm as warm as a silk cocoon wrapped around her little hand, she strangely felt a sense of relief although the person next to her was the one she feared the most\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was initially shocked to find out that she was still in her senior year but thankfully, even though she was a little young, she was grown-up already.However, the girl didn\u2019t come from a good family, in stark contrast to the Si family.But as long as Little 9th liked her, everything else didn\u2019t matter. Most importantly, she wanted to examine this girl\u2019s character and whether she was true to Little 9th.Hearing footsteps from the entrance, old madam looked towards the door hurriedly.The housekeeper was walking in front and behind him were two people, her grandson with his usual face as rigid as an ice sculpture, carrying a light blue school bag on his arm and beside him was a lovely little girl.The girl\u2019s plain little face was as bright as peaches, her black hair tied up in a ponytail and she was in Qing He High School\u2019s uniform. She looked extremely well-behaved, making anyone unbearably fond of her.What surprised her most was that they were actually holding hands.She knew Little 9th\u2019s personality too well\u2013any ordinary woman wouldn\u2019t be able to get closer than 3 steps from him, much less touch him.But right now, he was actually holding the girl\u2019s hand voluntarily. This had never happened before.Thus, the old madam looked at Ye Wan Wan with more contentment.Si Ye Han held Ye Wan Wan and walked towards the old madam, \u201cGrandma.\u201dThe old lady stared at Ye Wan Wan for a moment, her expression full of love. She spoke very amiably like she was afraid to scare the girl off, \u201cThis must be Wan Wan, quick, come over to grandma!\u201dYe Wan Wan glanced at Si Ye Han and then walked to the old madam obediently, \u201cHow are you, grandma?\u201d\u201cGood!\u201d The old lady was beaming with happiness when she replied. Glancing at Xu Yi carrying various bags behind them, she said, \u201cYou must be tired. I already said that you didn\u2019t have to bring any gifts\u2013you just needed to bring yourself!\u201dThat was what she said but her tone was still very happy.Although she didn\u2019t have a lack of anything at home, these gifts were given by her future granddaughter-in-law\u2013they held extreme significance.\u201cOld madam, dinner is ready.\u201d At that moment, the servant from the kitchen came over to inform her.\u201cYou guys came at the right time. Come over, let\u2019s chat while eating. We don\u2019t have a lot of rules at home, just be comfortable.\u201d The old madam was worried that Ye Wan Wan was reserved and took care to purposely mention that. She pulled Ye Wan Wan\u2019s hand affectionately to the dinner table and even left her grandson behind.Si Ye Han passed the school bag to the old housekeeper and his long legs followed them to the dining table.The old madam was already chatting warmly with Ye Wan Wan, \u201cWan Wan, is being in senior year tiring? I hope your studies weren\u2019t interrupted by coming over to visit me?\u201dGrandma Si\u2019s warm and affectionate attitude helped Ye Wan Wan calm down quite a bit. At present, it seemed like the old lady\u2019s first impression of her wasn\u2019t bad.Ye Wan Wan shook her head, \u201cNo, they weren\u2019t. We have no lessons on Saturdays and Sundays.\u201d\u201cThis child, Little 9th, didn\u2019t even tell me he\u2019s seeing someone. It was only when I saw him laughing in the corner by himself while looking at his phone that I asked what was he looking at. Then, he finally told me that he was reading a text from his girlfriend.That\u2019s when I found out. Since I wasn\u2019t aware he started dating, I had a bit of a fright so I rushed him to bring you home for me to meet!\u201d The old madam spoke and shot a look at her grandson.Ye Wan Wan was surprised to hear that Si Ye Han laughed at her text\u2013it was really hard to imagine.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Initially, Ye Wan Wan was planning to be more restrained since it was her first time there. Si Ye Han didn\u2019t speak much but his hands didn\u2019t stop moving and kept putting food on her plate. Before she knew it, she had already finished three bowls of rice.\u201cOh, don\u2019t give me any more food, I can\u2019t eat anymore!\u201d Ye Wan Wan whined as she looked at the mountain of food stacked in her bowl.She didn\u2019t want grandma to think that she had a bottomless stomach on their first meeting.Si Ye Han looked at the girl\u2019s whiny little face, reached his hand over, took her bowl and finished it for her.This guy\u2026 Isn\u2019t he squeamish\u2026Ye Wan Wan was a little taken aback but seeing that he helped lighten her load, she heaved a sigh of relief.The old madam watched the two of them interacting and her heart was filled with comfort.Also, this girl was just as her grandson had described; she wasn\u2019t picky with food at all. She also had a good appetite and was much easier on the eyes than those socialites who could only eat a few mouthfuls.After dinner, the old madam was worried that Wan Wan was bored of keeping her company. She said in a caring way, \u201cLittle 9th, this is Wan Wan\u2019s first time here, give her a little tour of the place.\u201d\u201cHm,\u201d Si Ye Han nodded,\u201cThen off we go, grandma,\u201d Ye Wan Wan said farewell to the old madam and then followed Si Ye Han to the courtyard obediently.The night was chilly, the sky overhead was filled with stars and the air had a crisp, floral scent.Although it was unlike the wonderful workmanship in Jin garden, the ancient house had its own flavour as well. Taking a stroll through the courtyard after dinner was really nice.Ye Wan Wan only found out then that the uneasiness she felt upon entering the old house had vanished.Appreciating the night without any distractions, the Si Ye Han next to her somehow had another problem again.He was completely fine while they were eating but something felt wrong now.She raised her eyes to look at his face and certainly, she noticed that there was a bit of unhappiness evident on the man\u2019s face, and even his footsteps accelerated.Ye Wan Wan\u2019s tiny legs couldn\u2019t keep up and very quickly, she was left behind.When did I agitate this guy again? Did I say something wrong while talking to old madam? I don\u2019t think so\u2026Ye Wan Wan was a little afraid of the dark. It was fine if she had someone next to her but alone, she was terrified.Seeing that he was disappearing into the night, Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t have time to think. She jogged to catch up and clung onto one of Si Ye Han\u2019s hands.It seemed in that moment when she held Si Ye Han\u2019s hand that the coldness she felt from him previously dissipated immediately.After she was reborn, she became very perceptive of Si Ye Han\u2019s emotions so her intuitions were never wrong.Ye Wan Wan blinked her eyes in surprise.Could it be that this fellow was so silent and threw a tantrum just now simply because I didn\u2019t hold his hand while walking?Si Ye Han wouldn\u2019t\u2026 be so childish, right?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Should we sit for a bit?\u201dSi Ye Han glanced at her, seemingly not wanting to stop but in the end, he brought her to sit on a long wooden bench.Ye Wan Wan sighed in comfort, loosened her grip on him, stretched her body and muttered, \u201cGrandma\u2019s really nice. I was afraid she wouldn\u2019t like me at first.\u201dSi Ye Han looked at his empty palm for an instant, then returned his gaze, \u201cNo way.\u201dActually, Ye Wan Wan knew that aside from her good behaviour, the biggest factor in determining Grandma\u2019s impression of her still depended on Si Ye Han. As the saying goes, he that loves the tree loves the branch.As long as she didn\u2019t make the same mistakes or cross a line, the meeting this time would most likely go smoothly. Of course, showing some affection to Si Ye Han wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201cOh yes, Si Ye Han, why does grandma call you Little 9th and others call you 9th young master?\u201d Ye Wan Wan asked out of curiosity.According to what she knew, Si Ye Han only had an elder brother so wasn\u2019t he supposed to be second in line?Si Ye Han leaned against the chair, glancing at the stars above, \u201cI\u2019ve been weak and sickly since I was little, so this was a way to avoid tempting fate.\u201dAfter hearing this, Ye Wan Wan understood, \u201cSo this was the reason. I\u2019ve also heard this saying before. So making your family members call you 9th young master instead of 2nd young master would prevent the Grim Reaper from taking your soul, huh?\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d\u201cWhether it\u2019s true or not, it\u2019s better to err on the side of caution.\u201dSi Ye Han was still alive after all and even lived to become a devil that ghosts and humans feared, a living king of hell.It was said that Si Ye Han and his father had been attacked previously and his father had died on the spot. After getting injured in that incident, his body had never really recovered.Considering how Si Ye Han went through such a tragedy at a young age, barely holding onto his life, not to mention his current insomnia and possibly numbered days left on this earth, it was no wonder that old madam loved him so ferociously.Due to the good atmosphere, Ye Wan Wan asked a taboo question out of curiosity, \u201cSi Ye Han, why can\u2019t a fine guy like you fall asleep all the time?\u201dYe Wan Wan waited for Si Ye Han\u2019s reply but nothing came, and just as she thought she had gone overboard, she felt a load on her shoulders.She turned her head subconsciously and saw that Si Ye Han was leaning on her shoulder with both eyes closed, with long and calm breaths\u2026 He had fallen asleep.\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Ye Wan Wan\u2019s expression darkened and she swallowed her question.Si Ye Han seemed to be sleeping soundly; Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t dare move and let him continue resting on her.However, the night was chilly and if he continued to sleep like that, he\u2019d most likely catch a cold\u2026The worried Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t notice that not too far off, stood two people.The old madam realised that the two of them hadn\u2019t returned for some time, so she went out to the courtyard with the housekeeper to find them.What shocked her the most was that the two children were on the bench and her grandson had his eyes shut, leaning against that girl\u2019s shoulder.

She kept watch for a bit, watching the way her grandson slept, her eyes red.\u201cOld Zhong, go fetch Xu Yi and Dr Mo!\u201d\u201cYes, old madam.\u201d Housekeeper Zhong immediately called for them.Mo Xuan and Xu Yi were at the old house, and after being called, they quickly followed Housekeeper Zhong to the courtyard.\u201cOld madam, did you ask for me?\u201d Mo Xuan felt uncertain as he thought old madam would be meeting her future granddaughter-in-law.

Old madam specially instructed us to prepare a room for Ms Ye, would Ms Ye like to rest now? Let me show you your room!\u201dShe had no choice as she was captivated by his charm and had already promised Si Ye Han that she\u2019d accompany him. Ye Wan Wan looked at Si Ye Han and said, \u201cI\u2019ll drop my things off first and take a bath. I\u2019ll catch you later.\u201dThe still sleep-deprived Si Ye Han wasn\u2019t in a pleasant mood, but he agreed, \u201cMhm.\u201dThus, Ye Wan Wan followed the maid and entered the room on the second floor facing the south.\u201cMs Ye, please enter, this is the room,\u201d the maid pushed the door open.Once the door was open, all she could see was that the whole room had a pink theme; pink bedsheets and quilt, pink curtains and carpet. Even the headboard was in the shape of a little crown and overhead was a dreamy canopy\u2013it was simply dreamlike and girly.Her misunderstanding of the old madam had been quite deep in her previous life; she had felt that she was the devil but actually, the old madam really viewed her as her future granddaughter-in-law. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have prepared a room for her and put in so much effort simply because she and Si Ye Han were dating. You could even say that she treated her like her own granddaughter.But in her previous life, she was a troublemaker and criticized every single thing.\u201cMiss, are you satisfied with this room? If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t like, we can change it immediately,\u201d the maid said, with fear and hesitation.Ye Wan Wan regained her composure after her initial surprise, \u201cNo need for the trouble, I like this room a lot. Please thank grandma for me!\u201dThe maid heaved a sigh of relief, \u201cThen Ms Ye, do have a restful night. If you need anything, you can reach me by pressing the bell at any time.\u201d\u201cAll right, thank you,\u201d Ye Wan Wan nodded.Clothes and all other amenities were available in the room.Ye Wan Wan picked a cute, baby pink nightgown from the closet and then headed to the bathroom to shower.Girls tend to take longer in the shower and when she was done, half an hour had already past.Ye Wan Wan dried her hair while opening the bathroom door and immediately saw Si Ye Han sitting on that extremely dreamlike and girly princess bed. She was unsure how long he\u2019d been waiting.Ye Wan Wan was stupefied for a moment and then quickly said, \u201cLet me blowdry my hair and apply my cream, I\u2019ll be done really soon\u2026\u201dSeeing that Si Ye Han didn\u2019t reply, Ye Wan Wan sat down in front of the dresser and started drying her hair.In the meantime, Si Ye Han was silently sitting on the edge of the bed, waiting for her. Watching her dry her hair, splash water on her face; apply facial essences, eye cream, and cleansing cream\u2026 His gaze didn\u2019t leave her for a second.Ye Wan Wan peeped at the man from the mirror. His face looked slightly annoyed.She strangely felt that Si Ye Han\u2019s face was plastered with these words written on them: Why are you still not coming over to accompany Your Majesty \u2026Ye Wan Wan sped up, wiped her face hastily and put everything away, \u201cI\u2019m done, let\u2019s go!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Theoretically, she would be a disturbance. Hypnotism needs to take place in a completely enclosed space with no outsiders.However, considering their speculations that night and also, since Ye Wan Wan was Si Ye Han\u2019s personal guest, he didn\u2019t dare to chase her away so he said, \u201cLet\u2019s try this out first.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Ye Wan Wan nodded.Si Ye Han laid in bed and saw her standing some distance away. He then furrowed his brows.Ye Wan Wan was a little confused. Si Ye Han asked her to accompany him but she didn\u2019t really understand what he meant by \u201caccompany\u201d. Furthermore, with Mo Xuan still around, she was embarrassed to just lie on the bed next to him.\u201cCome over.\u201d While Ye Wan Wan was still hesitant, the great devil\u2019s patience had run out.Aware of the danger in the atmosphere, Ye Wan Wan scurried over at once and sat down on the edge of the bed.In the next second, he stretched his long arms to scoop her body up, grabbed her waist and laid his head on her tummy.Ye Wan Wan leaned on the side of the bed. With her body used as a pillow, she didn\u2019t dare to move an inch.Mo Xuan was busy getting ready to perform the hypnotism and was slightly surprised at Ye Wan Wan\u2019s change in attitude.In the past, Ye Wan Wan viewed Si Ye Han as scary but she was still very strong-willed and refused to give in.But hopefully, this woman has really figured things out and doesn\u2019t hold any ill intentions, otherwise, the person who\u2019ll suffer will be herself.From a bystander\u2019s point of view, he knew it was wrong of Si Ye Han to disregard the girl\u2019s wishes and force her to be by his side. But talking rationally about right and wrong with this emotionless person who crawled out from hell? That was senseless.After a moment, everything was finally ready.Mo Xuan walked over to the edge of the bed, \u201c9th master, we may begin.\u201dThe Si Ye Han on the bed didn\u2019t respond.\u201c9th master?\u201d Mo Xuan called out again.Si Ye Han still didn\u2019t respond.Finally, Ye Wan Wan saw that Si Ye Han was sleeping soundly with his eyes closed. She began, \u201c9th master seems to be asleep already. Dr Mo, you\u2019re amazing!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMo Xuan was quiet for a long while and his face surveyed the scene once, like a merry-go-round, completely speechless.What\u2019s so amazing? I didn\u2019t even do a single thing!Mo Xuan saw for himself that he wasn\u2019t just asleep but was sleeping very peacefully. He wasn\u2019t even disturbed by the people talking next to him. Mo Xuan had mixed feelings.Could it be that the times when Si Ye Han fell asleep naturally were truly because of this woman?Then why didn\u2019t I realise it before?Also, Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t do anything to cause it, right?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The two of them were concentrated on their own tasks, looking warm and harmonious.Probably due to a good night\u2019s sleep, Si Ye Han was in a good mood the entire day. He didn\u2019t throw a fit even when a servant accidentally spilt water over his papers. He merely frowned and waved the servant away, then instructed Xu Yi to retype the document.That servant stumbled off like he was in a dream.Xu Yi brought the re-typed document carefully over to Si Ye Han, then continued standing by his side in silence.These 2 days, Xu Yi\u2019s thoughts were somewhat complicated. Ye Wan Wan had been so obedient which made him question whether she had been possessed.Even the old madam was very pleased with her and the things he feared didn\u2019t happen.Maybe I\u2019m really overthinking things?At that moment, a phone rang.Xu Yi looked at the table instinctively and saw that the ringing came from Ye Wan Wan\u2019s phone. On the display was\u2026 Shen Meng Qi\u2019s name.Seeing this name, an ominous foreboding rose in Xu Yi\u2019s heart\u2026Ye Wan Wan finished all her homework very quickly and while she was contemplating tackling math, an incoming call interrupted her.Seeing the name on the display, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s eyes glistened.Shen Meng Qi\u2026If she remembered correctly, Shen Meng Qi of the past had called her at this time precisely to inform her that Gu Yue Ze had gotten in a car accident.However this time, Shen Meng Qi didn\u2019t know that she was at the old house yet still, she called\u2026This was understandable since she could change the series of events at the old house but couldn\u2019t prevent Gu Yue Ze from getting in a car accident.With such a good opportunity to cause trouble, Shen Meng Qi naturally didn\u2019t pass it up, so she called her just like she had in her previous life.\u201cLet me go take a call!\u201d Ye Wan Wan informed Si Ye Han, then walked towards some faraway shade in the trees.Si Ye Han glanced at Ye Wan Wan\u2019s back, his gaze gloomy.A few seconds after Ye Wan Wan walked away, Xu Yi\u2019s phone rang as well.Disbelieving what the person was saying over the phone, Xu Yi\u2019s face turned white like it was the end of the world.After a long while, Xu Yi hung up and looked at Si Ye Han in a state of distress, and he seemed to be hesitant about what he wanted to say.Si Ye Han was aware of Xu Yi\u2019s strange behaviour, so he threw him a harsh look, \u201cSpeak.\u201dXu Yi\u2019s body shook as he said, \u201cI\u2026 Just\u2026 Just received the news that Gu Yue Ze was in a car accident. It seems pretty serious and he\u2019s currently getting emergency treatment at the hospital\u2026\u201dAt this point, Xu Yi didn\u2019t dare continue talking.What he had been worried about had finally happened and it was even more serious than what he\u2019d imagined!The call Ye Wan Wan picked up just now was probably Shen Meng Qi telling her the same.Gu Yue Ze had been hurt so badly\u2013how could Ye Wan Wan resist going to see him?

She allowed the phone to ring once more before slowly picking up, \u201cHello?\u201d\u201cWan Wan! What took you so long to answer? Where are you? In school? Wherever you are, hurry come down to Ren Ai hospital! Mr Gu is in trouble!\u201d Shen Meng Qi\u2019s frantic voice came through the receiver.Sure enough, this call from Shen Meng Qi was as she\u2019d expected.Ye Wan Wan gently stroked the rose next to her cheek, pretended to be surprised and raised her brows, \u201cIn trouble?\u201d\u201cYes, I just received the news that Mr Gu was in a car accident and was hurt pretty badly. He\u2019s currently in the emergency room and the doctor said his life might be in danger! If you don\u2019t want to regret this day your whole life, then head over there now!\u201d Shen Meng Qi\u2019s tone was steadfast, as if she was sure that after hearing this news, Wan Wan would definitely disregard everything and rush over.Ye Wan Wan seemed to have suddenly turned cold towards Gu Yue Ze and this made Shen Meng Qi very uneasy. Now, this was simply a heaven-sent opportunity to revive those feelings in Ye Wan Wan.In the past, she\u2019d make a big fuss even if Gu Yue Ze hurt his hand lightly. She didn\u2019t believe that Ye Wan Wan could act cold-hearted this time.Afraid that Ye Wan Wan wasn\u2019t hooked, Shen Meng Qi added some more bait, \u201cWan Wan, Mr Gu\u2019s car accident was a bit weird. The car crashed straight into him in broad daylight, as if on purpose. Could it be that Mr Gu offended someone? Who\u2019d be so daring to hurt the Gu\u2019s family young master?\u201dShe was obviously hinting that Si Ye Han was involved in Gu Yue Ze\u2019s car accident.If she could worsen the relationship between Ye Wan Wan and Si Ye Han at the same time, that\u2019d be like hitting two birds with one stone.Ye Wan Wan sneered in her heart after hearing this. Although some things had changed, Shen Meng Qi\u2019s tactics hadn\u2019t. Her fight with Si Ye Han in her previous life was all because of those words Shen Meng Qi had just said to sow discord between them.In actuality, Gu Yue Ze\u2019s car accident was simply a fluke.Even though it was cleared up in the end, Shen Meng Qi only made subtle hints and didn\u2019t specifically blame Si Ye Han. Also, in the past, she\u2019d never suspect that Shen Meng Qi would say all those things to cause trouble and would instead believe that Si Ye Han was indeed linked to Gu Yue Ze\u2019s accident.Shen Meng Qi rambled on for almost half a day and after it all, Ye Wan Wan leisurely replied with two words, \u201cGot it.\u201dShe hung up.After she hung up, Ye Wan Wan smiled dryly and stared at her phone.Right now, Shen Meng Qi must be hiding behind the hospital door, waiting to catch her in the act of cheating and then plotting to send proof to Si Ye Han, allowing him to catch the traitor. This was her plan.Tsk, since Shen Meng Qi\u2019s trying to mess with me, why not join her at her own game\u2026 and have some fun together\u2026After finishing up with the call, Ye Wan Wan went back to the courtyard.After packing up her textbooks, Ye Wan Wan looked at Si Ye Han gleefully and said, \u201cDarling, it\u2019s getting late, I still have to go to class tomorrow. I\u2019m going to head back to school!\u201dDespite seeing Ye Wan Wan returning from a call and requesting to leave immediately afterwards, Si Ye Han didn\u2019t show any change in his expression. He looked at her glumly, that pitiless pair of eyes like scary black holes with the ability to swallow up the light.\u201cGo back to school?\u201d He asked plainly.The Ye Wan Wan from the past probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to detect the difference in Si Ye Han, but right now, Ye Wan Wan felt something was wrong with Si Ye Han\u2019s attitude.Si Ye Han most likely knew about everything and thought that she wanted to go to the hospital to see Gu Yue Ze.However, she acted like she didn\u2019t notice any difference. She carried her schoolbag and said naturally, \u201cYup yup, you\u2019re busy with your work so don\u2019t bother seeing me off.

I\u2019ll say bye to grandma first!\u201dShe walked joyfully towards the house.Immediately after Ye Wan Wan left, a terrifying chill and rage erupted. The silent and calm little garden quickly transformed into a hell with dark winds blowing and a palpable feeling of murderous intentions.At that moment, Xu Yi\u2019s heart had turned into ashes.He kept praying and praying that Ye Wan Wan wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid. But then, he witnessed her running wildly on the road to death\u2026This foolish woman still wanted to go to Gu Yue Ze.

The terrifying atmosphere was dispelled the moment his eyes shut.There was a dead silence in the area.Without Si Ye Han\u2019s orders, Xu Yi didn\u2019t dare make a move.At the same time, in the living room:The old madam was filled with dread when she found out that Ye Wan Wan was leaving. She really liked this girl and had seen a great transformation in her grandson these two days. Naturally, this made her even more satisfied with Ye Wan Wan.\u201cWan Wan, I know Little 9th likes to be alone and has a bad temper but actually, he doesn\u2019t want to be this way either. You should also know that Little 9th has trouble sleeping. Think about it, because he gets such little sleep, imagine how horrible he feels\u2013it definitely impacts his temperament as well.But after Little 9th started dating you, I\u2019ve noticed that his temperament has become gentler.Wan Wan, grandma is truly thankful for you. Thank you for your patience and accommodating Little 9th. In the future, if that brat is ruthless and bullies you, let grandma know anytime and grandma will definitely be on your side!\u201d\u201cThank you, grandma!\u201dHearing the old lady pouring her heart out to her, Ye Wan Wan felt very emotional.No matter how respectable and honourable this legendary figure was, in this moment she was just an ordinary grandma.It was a pity that the old lady thought that she and Si Ye Han were a loving couple. Little did she know that her relationship with Si Ye Han was akin to a bubble\u2013easily burst with a single touch.Ye Wan Wan insisted that she didn\u2019t want to trouble anyone with her departure. In the end, she called herself a car and left.In the old lady\u2019s eyes, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s actions were considerate but in Xu Yi\u2019s eyes, it looked like she was shaking them off and eagerly rushing to the hospital to meet Gu Yue Ze.In the past, Si Ye Han would never have allowed her to go back to school by herself. But this time, he completely gave in.But the more lenient Si Ye Han was, the more Xu Yi was afraid.The Si Ye Han now was like the calm before the storm.If master ordered him to capture her back and tie her up now, that was better than what would happen if he caught her red-handed\u2026This time\u2026 I\u2019m afraid Ye Wan Wan\u2019s done for!To be frank, he had really enjoyed these few peaceful days, but unfortunately, they were merely an illusion.On the other side, Ye Wan Wan was already quite a distance away in her car.When they reached a fork in the road, Ye Wan Wan suddenly said, \u201cSir, don\u2019t take me to Qing He high school anymore, head to Ren Ai hospital instead!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But seeing that she came obediently as expected, her face filled with disdain and mockery.So what if you\u2019re pretty, you\u2019re so dumb you actually got fooled by me.Shen Meng Qi relaxed only when she saw with her own eyes that Ye Wan Wan had walked into Ren Ai hospital. She took out her phone and texted Si Ye Han: [Mr. Si, I was wondering if Wan Wan is there with you right now? I was feeling sick earlier so I went to the hospital and I happened to see someone that looked like Wan Wan. I\u2019m not sure whether it was her and couldn\u2019t get through to her phone either. I\u2019m a little worried, has she fallen ill?]She obviously wasn\u2019t so dumb as to purposely drive a wedge between them\u2013she just wanted Si Ye Han to find out for himself.Although she didn\u2019t want to admit it, Si Ye Han cared deeply for Ye Wan Wan and if he knew that Ye Wan Wan was ill, he\u2019d definitely come down to the hospital.When that time came, he\u2019d come with a heart full of worries but see Ye Wan Wan making out with Gu Yue Ze tenderly instead. That would be an interesting spectacle for sure\u2026After she sent the text, Shen Meng Qi left the hospital with confidence.He he, Ye Wan Wan, that idiot, still treating me like her best friend. That idiot will never find out it was me even on her deathbed.On the contrary, Shen Meng Qi would never have imagined that from the window of the hospital\u2019s second floor, Ye Wan Wan had witnessed everything, from her hiding behind the corner and secretly sending a text, to leaving with a delighted expression.Ye Wan Wan stood by the window and curled her lips slowly. Of course, she had to make a trip to the hospital and show her face so that Shen Meng Qi would play her tricks and continue stirring up trouble between her and Si Ye Han.Everybody knew about the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf. There was nothing to fear the first and second time, but what about the third and fourth time?If Shen Meng Qi kept failing in her plans to sow discord between them, even if she told the truth the next time, Si Ye Han would no longer believe her.And that\u2019s exactly what she wanted.At this moment, in the little garden at the old house:The moment Ye Wan Wan left, Si Ye Han remained rooted at the same spot without moving.That is, until the phone on the table rang, indicating a text message from Shen Meng Qi.The ringtone of this text message was like the sound of death in Xu Yi\u2019s ears.Si Ye Han scanned through the contents of the message, cold and without a trace of warmth. His expression didn\u2019t change throughout; it was like that pair of black hole-like eyes had swallowed all his emotions.Xu Yi peeked and saw that it was a message from Shen Meng Qi. He then looked at Si Ye Han\u2019s reaction again and could guess what it was about.The frightening silence lasted for a long time before Si Ye Han picked his phone up and made a call, asking, \u201cWhere are you.\u201dXu Yi saw that Si Ye Han had used speed dial and knew that he had called Ye Wan Wan. His expression became grey with defeat instantly.This time, no matter if Ye Wan Wan was lying or telling the truth, there was no way of coming back from this\u2026Then, he heard Ye Wan Wan on the receiver replying, \u201cI had some issues so I went to Ren Ai hospital midway because I\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish, his cold voice interrupted her, \u201cGo to Jin garden, now.\u201dAfter finishing the call, Si Ye Han shot Xu Yi an icy look, \u201cGo check.\u201dXu Yi was stunned and then nodded his head hurriedly.If things have progressed to this stage, Ye Wan Wan knows that she can\u2019t hide it anymore and has confessed but master doesn\u2019t believe her and wants to continue investigating\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But eventually, she\u2019d gotten so used to the darkness and dead silence that she started to fear the light and people instead.The scariest thing was not being imprisoned but that even if freedom was given to her one day, she wouldn\u2019t be able to escape from the cage around her heart.Even though she was reborn and returned to life before the tragedy began, she still couldn\u2019t escape the memories and shadows from her previous life.Outside, the sound of familiar footsteps came closer and closer, step by step.

All of Si Ye Han\u2019s senses and restraints turned into ashes in a flash.In the next second, Ye Wan Wan was thrown onto the bed by an enormous force and the bag that was in her tight grip landed on the floor with a crash.Just as she was about to speak, her throat got choked\u2013it was getting more and more challenging to breathe and life was slowly draining away from her body.When she finally regained her breath, she bit down on her tongue hard and her mouth rapidly filled with the taste of blood\u2026\u201cWan Wan, I\u2019ve said it before\u2026 This was the last time\u2026 Now, you\u2019ve run out of chances\u2026\u201dFollowing this, the man\u2019s footsteps got further and further away gradually and the sound of the lock clanged again.Once she had been relieved of his presence, Ye Wan Wan immediately coughed violently.

At the sight of the monstrous face and scarlet, beast-like eyes, Xu Yi was so scared that he turned pale.However, the issue was so pressing that he had to let the master know!Xu Yi forced himself to stay calm and used all the energy he had to find his voice and said quickly, \u201c9th master, I\u2019ve checked it myself.

My boyfriend has a serious case of insomnia; he\u2019s seen many doctors and tried many methods but none have worked. Doctor, you\u2019re so famous and he definitely came to seek treatment from you before. I\u2019m just here to find out more about insomnia and understand how he feels.\u201dThe old Chinese doctor was a little surprised by what she said and also looked somewhat moved, \u201cYou, silly little girl, are quite thoughtful.

All right, I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d\u201cThank you, doctor!\u201d The girl revealed an extremely joyful smile, pulled out a notebook and pen, and took down notes seriously.Seeing that she was so earnest, the old doctor explained a lot of information in detail.The girl\u2019s expression was sincere the whole time and asked very specific questions from time to time, \u201cMy grandma told me that long-term insomnia would affect a person\u2019s temperament, is that right?\u201dThe old Chinese doctor nodded, \u201cIf it\u2019s serious, it wouldn\u2019t only harm the body but in the long run, it would also greatly impact a person\u2019s character and mental health.

She had her body curled in fetal position and hadn\u2019t moved at all. When she heard the door open, her petite frame started shaking violently.Si Ye Han stood at the same spot, fingers in a tight fist, feet rooted to the ground.His gaze slowly landed on the black plastic bag at the side of the bed and the contents of the bag sprawled all over the floor.He slowly walked towards the bag, bent over and picked everything up.A few parcels of Chinese herbal medicine, an outpatient record sheet, a pink notebook\u2026Sprawled across the page, were the girl\u2019s crammed handwritten notes\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her cautious and repulsed position isolated herself in her own small world.On the side of her curved neck, there were visible bruises, a ghastly sight.Si Ye Han reached out his hand like he wanted to touch the girl\u2019s shoulders.However, as he moved slightly closer, the girl\u2019s body started trembling even more.The man pressed his thin lips together, his outstretched hand in midair.

The pair of eyes that looked at him were full of fear and helplessness. She murmured, \u201cSor\u2026 Sorry\u2026 Sorry\u2026 I was wrong\u2026 I\u2019ve learned my lesson\u2026 I\u2019ve learned from it\u2026\u201dLooking at the girl\u2019s alarmed and panicky expression and hearing the girl admitting her mistake, Si Ye Han\u2019s expression darkened even more.

Ye Wan Wan\u2019s tears couldn\u2019t stop flowing, and even after crying for more than half an hour, there were no signs of stopping.Si Ye Han embraced the girl from start till end without speaking a single word or movement.Xu Yi chased after Si Ye Han after noticing he was gone and stood by the door at this moment.Watching how badly Ye Wan Wan was crying, he felt a bit guilty as well.They\u2019d really misunderstood her this time, after all. It went without explanation that she must\u2019ve been frightened by the master just now. She did everything out of goodwill and yet, was misunderstood. How could she not be sad?The good thing was that the truth was sorted out.But master, she\u2019s crying so badly, shouldn\u2019t you at least comfort her a little? Just standing there like an ice sculpture is scary alright?For his master, he\u2019d probably reached his limit already; he couldn\u2019t really imagine his master comforting the girl.An indefinite amount of time had passed before the man finally loosened his embrace of the girl. His face regained a cold expression and he said in a calm manner, \u201cXu Yi, take her back to school.\u201dAfter speaking, he turned and left without a second glance.After Xu Yi heard that, he was initially stunned and looked at the back of his master leaving and somehow felt that he looked a bit grim.Xu Yi sighed softly, looked at the girl on the bed who was still sobbing and tried his best to speak softly, \u201d Ms Ye, don\u2019t cry anymore, don\u2019t worry.

She stood rooted at the same spot for quite some time before slowly walking towards the school.She didn\u2019t return to the dormitory immediately but sat on a long bench by the school\u2019s little lake.The cool night wind cut across the surface of the lake and blew against her face, reviving her senses.Not long ago, her past had almost been replayed out but now, she regained her freedom once again.At first, she merely wanted to beat him at his own game. However, even if everything went according to plan, the fear of Si Ye Han was real and so was the pain she felt previously.Not only this time but the accumulated pain and resentment from both lives.After this episode, she was all burnt out but after venting, she also felt much better.Fortunately, it was ultimately a near miss and she successfully changed her original course of life, making it through the crisis this time.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As his father was the school\u2019s director, those bullied by him could only swallow their hurt and even the teachers turned a blind eye and didn\u2019t dare to discipline him.It was just his luck to bump into a stubborn teacher like Zhao Xing Zhou this time.

When she heard the end of it, Ye Wan Wan couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer so she coughed lightly and said, \u201cLing Dong, you seem to have set your own trap and gotten trampled by Zhao Xing Zhou. How is it my fault at all?\u201d\u201cAh\u2014\u2014\u201d At hearing this voice beside him without warning, Ling Dong was so frightened that he fell off the bench.

There were only a few months left before the college entrance exam so she wouldn\u2019t be in school for much longer; there was no need to waste her time on these childish games.The next morning.Ye Wan Wan reverted back to her outrageous get-up and went to class as usual.Just as she stepped inside, the chaotic classroom became silent in an instant. The students in class stared at her with gleaming eyes and a hopeful expression.Ye Wan Wan was a little annoyed; these people made it so obvious\u2013were they really going to treat her like a fool who didn\u2019t know any better?All right, with her previous intellect, she really wouldn\u2019t have known any better.Ye Wan Wan acted blissfully unaware and walked straight to her seat.With a glance, she realized that there was something not right about her chair. It was covered with a thick layer of colorless glue. If she hadn\u2019t looked closely, she wouldn\u2019t have seen it and would\u2019ve sat right on it.With this type of strong glue, a person stuck to the chair would have to remove their pants to get up.Although it wouldn\u2019t cause any substantial damage, shed\u2019 be embarrassed in front of all her classmates.Ye Wan Wan looked at the Si Xia who was sprawled on the table napping as usual and silently muttered homme fatale\u2026Just as she pulled out the chair, somebody suddenly rushed up to her side, pushed her aside and then quickly pulled out her chair.The chair was dragged to the front, the sunlight illuminating it clearly so everybody could see the layer of glue on the chair clearly.The Si Xia that was asleep was woken up by the piercing screech. His irritated gaze swept across Ye Wan Wan and Ling Dong, standing in front, and then glanced at the chair. He furrowed his brows.Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t notice Si Xia\u2019s reaction. Her brows were raised and she was looking at Ling Dong who\u2019d suddenly appeared.What\u2019s the meaning of this?Being stared at by those black pupils, Ling Dong\u2019s originally arrogant and defiant expression suddenly froze up. He pulled her chair to his own seat and exchanged it for Ye Wan Wan\u2019s without saying a word.That wasn\u2019t all. Under the stares of all his astonished classmates, Ling Dong reached his arm out again and removed a dead rat from Ye Wan Wan\u2019s desk drawer.After seeing the dead rat, some timid girls shrieked in disgust.Ling Dong threw the dead rat away expressionlessly, and then shone a light from his phone into the drawer to check that there was nothing else inside before telling Ye Wan Wan in a low and muffled voice, \u201cTake a seat.\u201dHe didn\u2019t dare to look into Ye Wan Wan\u2019s eyes after speaking.

Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t give it any further thought.She looked at the phone in her drawer, unfocused.From last night till now, Si Ye Han hadn\u2019t contacted her after he sent Xu Yi to take her back to school.According to his reaction yesterday, he shouldn\u2019t be angry anymore, right?Actually, she did take a risk yesterday after all.If Si Ye Han had completely lost his senses in his fury and locked her up without letting her explain, the consequences would\u2019ve been dire.Fortunately, her efforts so far hadn\u2019t been wasted. Si Ye Han hadn\u2019t completely believed Shen Meng Qi\u2019s words and went to investigate things himself.After class, the students continued to stare in the direction of Ye Wan Wan and whispered, after holding things in for an entire lesson.Watching Cheng Xue and three of her diehard followers walking up to Ye Wan Wan aggressively, everybody was alert again.\u201cUgly freak, come out! We have something for you!\u201d One of the girls with a sharp chin barked harshly.Usually, people called out after class would be brought to the girls\u2019 washroom to be bullied.Even though Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t want to entertain these childish fights, being bothered all the time affected her mood too.She shot them a cold glare and replied leisurely, \u201cSure!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019re you waiting for, hurry up!\u201d The girl couldn\u2019t wait and started to drag her as another girl next to her started pulling her as well.Si Xia who was lying on the table asleep looked up and his brows twitched when he saw the scene before him.

It was just that his temperament was completely different from Si Xia\u2019s. He was like a rebellious wolf, violence buzzing throughout his body and was unusually vicious when he fought. People feared him when they saw him every day. His current expression made everybody quiver to the bone.Seeing that Ling Dong was standing behind them with that face, the three girls were startled by his scary expression, \u201cDong\u2026 brother Dong!\u201dOne of the girls summoned the courage to explain, \u201cDong, this ugly freak was too hateful.

This was the first time Ling Dong had used such a harsh tone with them and their eyes turned red after being yelled at. At first, they wanted to protest more but after seeing Ling Dong\u2019s terrifying expression, they didn\u2019t dare and could only stomp their feet and rush to Cheng Xue.After the three of them left, Ling Dong looked at Ye Wan Wan again and his initial ferocious expression became stiff and raw.After hesitating for a few moments, Ling Dong turned, shoved the big bag of snacks he was holding into Ye Wan Wan\u2019s arms and said in a low voice, \u201cFor you.\u201dYe Wan Wan looked at the snacks, her expression confused as she continued in silence, \u201c\u2026\u201dLing Dong stood in front of her desk without indicating any intentions of leaving. He looked hesitant to speak and each time he opened his mouth to say something, he\u2019d swallow his words.

Who knew that right after, Ling Dong would cause more trouble?Where had it all gone wrong?Could it be that to take revenge on me, Ling Dong plans to dump me after winning me over?Ye Wan Wan quickly disregarded this possibility, since this would involve too much sacrifice on the part of the enemy himself. As long as Ling Dong wasn\u2019t out of his mind, he\u2019d never use this kind of sacrificial method to take revenge.This couldn\u2019t really be because of last night, could it?If this wasn\u2019t a trick, this could be the only reason.He\u2019d only seen her without makeup and besides, it was a quick glance.

She didn\u2019t have a school director as her father like Ling Dong so she couldn\u2019t act impulsively.Thus, Ye Wan Wan could only say, \u201cSorry, whether this is a trick or for real, I have no interest in you!\u201dLing Dong stiffened up, \u201cWhy? Why aren\u2019t you interested in me?\u201dYe Wan Wan saw that Ling Dong was standing there stubbornly, his expression unusually serious and looking like he wouldn\u2019t give up without an answer.

Then, he said sternly, \u201cSi Xia, Ye Wan Wan is the girl I\u2019m after. If we\u2019re brothers then don\u2019t go overboard with the kissing scene.

Her relationship with Jiang Yan Ran wasn\u2019t so bad at the beginning while Fang Qin was a complete pushover; she didn\u2019t dare to offend anybody.So, she didn\u2019t know Jiang Yan Ran and Fang Qin slowly started to exclude her and requested the school for a change of dorms.It was a long time before she found out that there were rumours that she was always being picked up in luxurious cars and had intimate relationships with people outside school because of her sugar daddy.As the rumours about her spread, nobody wanted to live with her and so, she was switched to a room by herself.It was easy to guess where all these rumours came from and why Jiang Yan Ran and Fang Qin believed them.Ye Wan Wan smiled faintly and glanced at Shen Meng Qi.You still want to pretend to be innocent?I want to see how Jiang Yan Ran and Fang Qin react after seeing the true face of this \u201ckind and innocent\u201d girl!Shen Meng Qi was good at manipulating people\u2019s hearts; her two-faced tactics managed to create quite a few connections for her and she stepped on all these people, one-by-one, to climb higher and higher.Of course, she wasn\u2019t the only one.Jiang Yan Ran was one of them as well. Her father was a veteran in the entertainment circle and the Jiang Yan Ran of the future was an internationally known director. The film which led Shen Meng Qi to stardom was directed by her.However, this talented director\u2019s fate was tragic in the end. During the peak of her career, she committed suicide by slitting her wrist and died in the bathtub at home.As for her cause of death, there were many speculations. The reported cause was depression, but the truth was that her husband Song Zi Hang had cheated on her and the mistress was her good friend, the lead actress whom she had groomed herself, Shen Meng Qi.Jiang Yan Ran and Song Zi Hang grew up together. Jiang Yan Ran had always loved Song Zi Hang deeply but Song Zi Hang only loved her like a sibling and married her because of the pressure from his parents.Jiang Yan Ran only found out on her deathbed that the person who\u2019d captured Song Zi Hang\u2019s heart was actually the person she was closest to and trusted the most.At this time seven years ago, Jiang Yan Ran wasn\u2019t dating Song Zi Hang yet but Song Zi Hang and Shen Meng Qi were already fooling around way before that\u2026Like the way she used to tackle her brother, Shen Meng Qi\u2019s way of dealing with men was to not accept but also not to reject.

As she was enjoying Song Zi Hang\u2019s attention, she didn\u2019t have the strength to entertain Wan Wan so she simply sent her off with a few words and hung up.But how did Ye Wan Wan know where I was? Could it be that I accidentally blurted it out?Damn, and this dumb girl had to talk about this in front of Jiang Yan Ran!Sure enough, Jiang Yan Ran\u2019s expression changed immediately, \u201cWhat did you say? Last month, Shen Meng Qi and Song Zi Hang went to the amusement park?\u201dFang Qin was also a little shocked, \u201cIt was Yan Ran\u2019s birthday that day! Yan Ran especially invited Song Zi Hang and was prepared to confess her love to him. In the end, Song Zi Hang didn\u2019t show up and you also said that you couldn\u2019t make it since you were sick. You\u2026 Why were you with Song Zi Hang that day\u2026?\u201dThe girls around them were all stunned as well. Jiang Yan Ran likes Song Zi Hang?Not many people knew about this but Shen Meng Qi was Jiang Yan Ran\u2019s roommate and they were very close; there was no way she didn\u2019t know.Since Shen Meng Qi was clearly aware that Jiang Yan Ran liked Song Zi Hang and that she was prepared to confess her love to him on her birthday, why would Shen Meng Qi lie to Jiang Yan Ran about feeling sick and going out with Song Zi Hang?The expression of the onlookers staring at Shen Meng Qi changed in an instant.Going behind a good friend\u2019s back to seduce the person she likes\u2026 completely shameful.Ye Wan Wan heard Fang Qin\u2019s words and immediately looked anxious like she had said something wrong but her eyes were gleaming, \u201cDid I say something wrong\u2026?\u201dSaying those words increased her credibility.As everybody knew that Shen Meng Qi and Ye Wan Wan were on very good terms, Jiang Yan Ran trusted those rumours about Ye Wan Wan that Shen Meng Qi said previously. On the contrary, she also believed what Ye Wan Wan had just accidentally revealed.Furthermore, Jiang Yan Ran wasn\u2019t a fool; she had her suspicions as well but wasn\u2019t completely sure.Sure enough, Jiang Yan Ran immediately took out her phone with shaky hands and opened the message Song Zi Hang posted on his Moments at the end of last month.Song Zi Hang had set a mood: [Love of my life, I\u2019ll wait for you to graduate]The accompanying picture was a photo taken at the amusement park. There were no real people in the photo but only two elongated shadows of a guy and girl.This obviously meant that Song Zi Hang had confessed his love for the girl but the girl had told him that they could only be together after her graduation.After her birthday, Jiang Yan Ran saw this message and knew that Song Zi Hang didn\u2019t go to her birthday party because he wanted to confess his love to a girl whom he liked for a long time.But she never would\u2019ve expected that the true love Song Zi Hang hid from her, the person she really wanted to find out, was someone she actually viewed as her best friend, Shen Meng Qi!No wonder\u2026 no wonder Song Zi Hang never told me who it was!The person he was protecting so fiercely was actually just by my side!At that moment, Jiang Yan Ran stared at Shen Meng Qi in disbelief, \u201cShen Meng Qi, tell me, what\u2019s going on here? The person that Song Zi Hang liked all this time\u2026 Is you?\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I had a reason for being with Song Zi Hang that day, I did it for you\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, so the person who was with him that day was really you! So, you\u2019re admitting it? The person that Song Zi Hang liked all along, is you!\u201dJiang Yan Ran started laughing hysterically all of a sudden, \u201cHa\u2026 Haha\u2026 Shen Meng Qi\u2026 I even shared all my feelings with you every day like a fool\u2026 shared with you my thoughts on the identity of the girl that Song Zi Hang liked\u2026Was it entertaining for you to watch me be so stupid? To watch me love him to death while the person he liked was you? Do you feel accomplished?You clearly knew that I had prepared so long to confess my love for him on my birthday and that I was so nervous I couldn\u2019t sleep for countless nights. Knowing all that, you still went out with him that day behind my back and now you dare to say that you were doing it for me?\u201dShen Meng Qi hurriedly replied, \u201cI wanted to make it clear to him!\u201dJiang Yan Ran sneered and looked at Song Zi Hang\u2019s post on her phone, then she forcefully shoved her phone onto Shen Meng Qi\u2019s face, \u201cMake it clear? You made it clear like that?\u201dShen Meng Qi\u2019s nose had been jolted so hard by the phone that tears started flowing. She covered her face and said, \u201cYan Ran, let me explain, I told him that I only wanted to focus on my studies and rejected him. But he may have misunderstood what I meant and thought that I wanted to be with him after graduation\u2026\u201dListening to Shen Meng Qi\u2019s excuse, Jiang Yan Ran\u2019s face turned gloomier. She said with a face of full rage, \u201cShut up! Song Zi Hang told me himself, he said that the girl admitted to having feelings towards him, that you kissed him yet you\u2019re still trying to defend yourself! Get lost! I don\u2019t want to hear any more about the both of you! Disgusting!\u201dThat day, she had gone to find Song Zi Hang and saw for herself that his eyes were filled with happiness; he told her that the person he liked had accepted his love.If it weren\u2019t for Shen Meng Qi giving him hope, why would he have that sort of reaction?Shen Meng Qi didn\u2019t expect that Song Zi Hang would tell Jiang Yan Ran about this, so her face went pale and she was speechless.Looking at Shen Meng Qi\u2019s reaction, the onlookers understood everything.After Jiang Yan Ran finished talking, she forcibly pushed through the crowd and staggered away.Fang Qin looked at Jiang Yan Ran hesitantly and then turned to Shen Meng Qi. In the end, she hurriedly chased after Jiang Yan Ran.The crowd had initially gathered to watch a spectacle involving Ye Wan Wan but unexpectedly bumped into this huge news about two girls fighting over a boy. They all glared at Shen Meng Qi and started whispering.\u201cI really couldn\u2019t tell that Shen Meng Qi could do something like that! She looks so simple-minded!\u201d\u201cShe knew that Jiang Yan Ran liked Song Zi Hang all along but still hooked up with Song Zi Hang behind her back. She\u2019s really cruel!\u201d\u201cMaybe it was one-sided and Song Zi Hang was the one chasing her?\u201d\u201cIt takes two hands to clap, okay? Didn\u2019t you hear what Jiang Yan Ran said about the girl voluntarily kissing Song Zi Hang?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d\u2026Ye Wan Wan stood at the same spot and watched silently at the back of Jiang Yan Ran staggering off and she felt a strange sense of kinship as if they suffered from the same disease.This person, Jiang Yan Ran, drew a clear line between her friends and foes and showed intense feelings for both, as shown by the hatred towards her, and the intense love towards Song Zi Hang.The Jiang Yan Ran from her previous life insisted on being with Song Zi Hang even after she found out he didn\u2019t like her. She even begged her parents to pressure him and was finally met with a tragic ending.Would anything change this time after finding about Song Zi Hang and Shen Meng Qi in advance? What would her choice be? Would she continue to forgive him or would she let go\u2026?However, this was no longer something she had the energy to care about. She still needed to figure out how to deal with Ling Dong. Her words just now had tampered down the school rumours and dragged Shen Meng Qi down, but she still had to deal with Si Ye Han.What should I do?

You won\u2019t blame me, will you?\u201dShen Meng Qi was so pissed listening to all the nasty whispers around her but she could only force herself to hold it in and hide the darkness beneath her eyes. She forced a laugh, \u201cWan Wan, why would I\u2026 Why would I blame you\u2026 ? You didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2026\u201dShen Meng Qi spoke through gritted teeth and her eyes swept across the people who remained. Then, she explained to her urgently, \u201cActually, Yan Ran misunderstood me. Why would I steal her sweetheart?!\u201dSong Zi Hang did in fact like me and has always been courting me but I\u2019ve never responded to him and even went to make things clear with him.

I didn\u2019t make the first move; I wasn\u2019t expecting it at all\u2026\u201dI was afraid that Yan Ran would misunderstand so I kept it from her, but who could\u2019ve guessed that you\u2026\u201dSince Yan Ran was gone and Song Zi Hang wasn\u2019t there, nobody knew the truth. Shen Meng Qi tried to smooth everything over and pushed the blame onto Ye Wan Wan instead.Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t give the game away either; she responded as if she just had a sudden revelation, \u201cThat\u2019s what I said, the person you like is obviously my brother!\u201dShen Meng Qi was startled by what she said and then corrected her sternly, \u201cWan Wan, don\u2019t spout nonsense, I\u2019ve always treated Mu Fan as my own older brother. I liked him only as an older brother!\u201dNow that Star Entertainment under the Shen family was thriving, she\u2019d become a big star in future. With a bright future ahead of her, there would be countless boys chasing her. She didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with that good-for-nothing loser, Ye Mu Fan.She was holding onto him only because he had some value she could use.What Shen Meng Qi said about treating Ye Mu Fan like her own brother was enough to make Ye Wan Wan choke in disgust.As if she didn\u2019t know what Shen Meng Qi was truly thinking about. She sneered in her heart and asked suspiciously, \u201cReally? I personally mailed out the love letter you gave my brother! The letter was very mushy; something like \u2018I fell in love with you when I first saw you, you are the perfect god in my heart\u2026\u2019It turns out I was wrong\u2013that\u2019s considered liking someone as a brother? And I thought you looked down on my brother because of what happened to my dad!\u201dThe attentive crowd suddenly let out a sigh, revealing that they understood clearly and they looked at Shen Meng Qi with even more disgust.With regards to Shen Meng Qi\u2019s explanation, they were doubtful of her and most still stood by Jiang Yan Ran\u2019s side.Hearing what Ye Wan Wan said now, they suddenly felt that Shen Meng Qi was indeed guilty of despising the poor and seeking favour with the rich. Ye Wan Wan\u2019s elder brother, Ye Mu Fan, was also a popular figure in Qing He previously and many people knew about Shen Meng Qi chasing after him.Now she\u2019s saying that she views him as a brother? Who would believe her?!Shen Meng Qi was stunned, \u201cWan Wan, that was so long ago, I was still young and ignorant. I didn\u2019t know what love was!Also, how can I possibly distance myself from you and Mu Fan because of what happened to your family? If those were my intentions, why would I be so close to you and even help your brother get into my father\u2019s company?\u201dShen Meng Qi suddenly gained some confidence. She laughed and said, \u201cOther than his hobby of gambling, Mu Fan\u2019s quite hardworking at work\u2013my dad even complimented him a few days ago!

Their status even kept up with the Ye family in the entertainment business seven years in the future.As for Ye Wan Wan\u2019s brother, in order to win Shen Meng Qi\u2019s hand in marriage, he tired himself out and contracted many illnesses at a young age. In the end, his body collapsed. After his value had been squeezed dry, he was kicked out by the Shen family. The Shen family didn\u2019t want to be the subject of ridicule so they got people to frame him of breaking an unspoken entertainment business rule, causing him to lose his reputation, be blacklisted by everybody in the entertainment circle, resulting in great despair to him\u2026She was able to make Jiang Yan Ran see Shen Meng Qi\u2019s true self but couldn\u2019t get her own brother to regain his senses.In the past, her brother was also very charming himself\u2013he could go through a million pretty girls without being tempted. He had innumerable girlfriends but then fell for Shen Meng Qi. He treated Shen Meng Qi specially, spoiled her and treated her better than his own sister.With her ruined relationship with her brother now, if she talked bad about Shen Meng Qi, not only would he not believe her, it would also worsen their relationship.Until she found someone who could expose Shen Meng Qi and allow her brother to thoroughly see the evidence of the Shen family\u2019s true colours, then could he be saved.However, it\u2019s okay to take it slow. Jiang Yan Ran was just the beginning!Looking at Shen Meng Qi, Ye Wan Wan acted surprised and said, \u201cMy brother is a top style consultant and has the title of the \u2018god of style\u2019 in the industry. When Global Entertainment, the rival of Imperial Sky, came to poach him, he didn\u2019t even agree to go over. Who knew that some casual words from you could persuade him to switch to your company?\u201dAlthough the Shen family\u2019s Poly Star Entertainment completely crushed Global Entertainment seven years in the future and became on par with the Ye family\u2019s Imperial Sky, currently the Shen family\u2019s company was still lagging far behind these two dominant forces.Once those words had been spoken, the girls around them naturally began to follow the direction of Ye Wan Wan\u2019s thinking. If Shen Meng Qi and Ye Mu Fan really had nothing going on, why would Ye Mu Fan be so submissive to her words, give up the opportunity with the leading Global Entertainment and run over to Poly Star?Also, what Ye Wan Wan said was obviously hinting that the Shen family took advantage of him while still acting as if they were doing him a favour.Shen Meng Qi\u2019s face changed slightly. She forced a smile and said, \u201cAfter all, Mu Fan and I have known each other for ages so he trusts whatever I say. Even though Poly Star isn\u2019t as big as Global, it has potential for growth. Mu Fan is very talented, but after you know what happened with your father\u2026 It\u2019s no longer so easy for him to work with a big company\u2026 Oh, Wan Wan, I\u2019ll talk to you again soon, I\u2019m worried about Yan Ran. I\u2019m going to go look for her!\u201dShen Meng Qi never expected that Ye Wan Wan would be so difficult today. Even after giving her best effort in her verbal match with Ye Wan Wan in front of the crowd, she was left with almost no room to refute her.To prevent Ye Wan Wan from making an irrefutable counter, Shen Meng Qi hurriedly found an excuse and left.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What was there to lose by being honest?At the same time, just as Ye Wan Wan expected, Shen Meng Qi was boiling inside.Jiang Yan Ran and Fang Qin weren\u2019t in the dorm. She looked at her face which had been smashed by the phone\u2013it was rapidly swelling up. With one furious sweep of her arm, she sent everything on the table crashing to the ground.Damn it, this is all that dumb Ye Wan Wan\u2019s fault!That dummy actually dared to bring up my old flame, Ye Mu Fan. Ye Mu Fan is only a dog in my family\u2019s company now, how can he compare? He\u2019s like a toad wanting to be a swan!Ye Wan Wan, I definitely won\u2019t let you off so easy!Shen Meng Qi pulled out her phone with a gloomy expression. She sneered and quickly drafted a message: [ Mr Si, Wan Wan\u2019s been hanging out with some bad company lately; she\u2019s very close to a troublemaker at school. She clearly knows that he has bad intentions. I\u2019m worried that Wan Wan will be foolish and get tricked by him. I really don\u2019t understand why she keeps doing things to harm her relationship with you when you\u2019re such a good person and treats her so well, Mr Si!]Shen Meng Qi twisted the truth with just a few words.On the surface, she acted like she cared about Ye Wan Wan\u2019s safety but in reality, she actually didn\u2019t care at all.When it came to snitching on people, Shen Meng Qi was top notch.Aside from this message, she didn\u2019t forget to send over some photos of the two of them walking together. This allowed her to finally let off some steam.She didn\u2019t know what went wrong yesterday; Ye Wan Wan was able to go back to school like usual. But this time, with evidence in place, she would get her for sure!Late at night, Jin garden:Xu Yi stared at the door that had been shut for an entire day and night. He paced around anxiously, \u201cWhat should I do? 9th master has locked himself in the room for one day and one night already. Dr. Mo, aren\u2019t you a top psychologist? Think of something!\u201dMo Xuan folded his arms and leaned against the wall opposite. He was astonished, \u201cI\u2019m a doctor, not a god!\u201dDoes he think I\u2019m omnipotent?!Anyway, I\u2019m completely useless with Si Ye Han.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do, right\u2026?!\u201dWhile Xu Yi was freaking out, there was suddenly the sound of an incoming text nearby.Xu Yi followed the direction of the sound and realized it was the phone Si Ye Han threw on the floor.He picked it up to take a look and saw that there were many new message notifications on the screen. They were all from Shen Meng Qi.\u201cThis woman is some lingering ghost! I already have enough to deal with!\u201d Xu Yi cursed silently and clutched the phone tightly to prevent Si Ye Han from hearing.Mo Xuan looked at the phone and pondered slightly before saying, \u201cGo and check what\u2019s going on with Ye Wan Wan, maybe she can lure 9th master out.\u201dXu Yi\u2019s face turned black after he heard that. Did they have to use such a terrifying method to lure the 9th master out?But there was no other way; if master keeps refusing food and drink, how can his body take it?It looked like they could only fight poison with poison.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a boy in school who was courting Ye Wan Wan openly and the whole school knew about it!Xu Yi was on the verge of breaking down. Ye Wan Wan was simply a disaster and the consequences were too terrifying!\u201cThere\u2019s someone in school that\u2019s openly chasing Ms Ye! Dr Mo, should we tell 9th master about it?\u201d Xu Yi asked with a sullen face.Normally, when Ye Wan Wan spoke to other guys, 9th master flared up. But now, there was someone who dared to chase her. How could he continue to let Ye Wan Wan wander about freely? If the two of them fought again\u2026He wanted desperately to hide this from master.Mo Xuan went blank for a while. \u201cAre you sure?\u201dWith the way Ye Wan Wan looks, she\u2019s still able to attract a suitor?Xu Yi nodded his head sternly, \u201cIt\u2019s true!

He might just have a problem with his eyesight.\u201dMo Xuan pinched the space between his brows and was a bit hesitant. After deep consideration, he said, \u201c9th master will find out sooner or later.\u201dXu Yi agreed. It\u2019s just a matter of an early or late death.So, Xu Yi took a deep breath, knocked on the tightly shut door and pushed it open carefully.He saw that the curtains were all drawn, with only a narrow gap revealing a weak ray of light that landed on the man\u2019s face.Si Ye Han\u2019s long body lay on the sofa, one leg bent and one hand covering his eyes to block out the light. The collar of his black shirt that was normally meticulously buttoned to the top now had two buttons unfastened, his devilishly handsome face morbidly pale. His presence produced a gloomy aura around him.But with this kind of aura, not only did it not hurt him, it made him look more malicious instead, like a vampire that had been in deep sleep for a thousand years in an ancient palace\u2026In fact, the master was a hundred times more dangerous when silent than when actively enraged.Xu Yi swallowed hard and walked over trembling, \u201c9th\u2026 9th master\u2026 There are some messages for you\u2026 They\u2026 They were sent by Shen Meng Qi\u2026 She sent many messages over\u2026 It might be an emergency\u2026\u201dIn the past, as long as it was a message from Shen Meng Qi, Si Ye Han gave it his full attention.

He stood there, frozen, with the phone raised. He had a sense of foreboding about this call; he hoped master would ignore it.The atmosphere became more and more unbearable with each ring; the ringing was like a bomb ticking away.Xu Yi\u2019s nerves were frazzled, and probably because he was so flustered, his hand slipped and he accidentally pressed the button to answer.In the next second, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s usual grotesque face appeared on the screen.Damn! It\u2019s over\u2026At the other end, Ye Wan Wan had waited for a very long time and saw that the phone was just about to automatically end the call.

His face was abnormally pale.Even through the screen, she could feel the terrifying and dangerous aura emitting from the man\u2019s body.Judging by the angle on the screen, the phone seemed to be held by another person, possibly Xu Yi.The display on the phone was shaking slightly and she guessed it was Xu Yi\u2019s hand trembling.From this slight tremble, Ye Wan Wan was acutely aware of the dire situation and was 80% sure that Si Ye Han had received the news already. She was a moment too late.Ye Wan Wan pressed her lips together and squinted her eyes, \u201cSorry\u2026 Did I interrupt your sleep\u2026?\u201dXu Yi saw that he had answered the call accidentally and could only try to mediate the situation with his head drenched in cold sweat, \u201d Ms Ye, 9th master hasn\u2019t gone to bed yet.

He knew he shouldn\u2019t have taken this call!!!He didn\u2019t notice that the phone was swaying back and forth but he hoped Ye Wan Wan would stop talking.Nonetheless, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s mumbles continued through the phone, \u201cCould you come with me to meet this boy?\u201dXu Yi felt a bolt of lightning striking his head.She actually asked the 9th master to go with her to meet that boy?At this moment on the sofa, Si Ye Han\u2019s half-opened eyes were now fully opened, like a wild beast waking up from its slumber.While Xu Yi had all his hopes dashed, Ye Wan Wan\u2019s voice continued coming through the receiver, \u201cI\u2019ve told the boy that I have a boyfriend already and he didn\u2019t believe me.

Not only do I have a boyfriend, my boyfriend\u2019s also one thousand times better looking than our school\u2019s hunk\u2026\u201d\u201cErm\u2026\u201d Xu Yi stood rooted to the ground, completely dumbstruck as he listened and wondered whether this was some kind of trick.Ye Wan Wan\u2019s sucking up\u2026 Was pretty darn good!Even the man\u2019s dreary expression was stunned for a moment.As Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t get a response for a long time, she hung her head low, dejected, \u201cSorry\u2026 Did I trouble you? If it\u2019s not convenient for you, then\u2026\u201d\u201cTime?\u201d the man\u2019s low and hoarse voice interrupted her from the other end of the call.Ye Wan Wan was astonished for a moment before her eyes glowed, \u201cHow about tomorrow night? Just outside school!\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ling Dong stood in front of her looking calm.Seeing this, Ye Wan Wan shot a suspicious gaze over.Everybody in class looked at the both of them, hungry for gossip.Ling Dong pressed his lips together, looked at Ye Wan Wan with a serious face and said, \u201cYe Wan Wan, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve heard that rumour but I swear, I\u2019m definitely not pursuing you because of a lost bet or tricking you. I\u2019m serious! Please believe me!\u201d\u201cOh\u2014\u2014\u201d All the students around burst into an uproar.Ye Wan Wan\u2019s face darkened instead. She had painstakingly thought of this idea last night to refute the rumours but in the end, everything was ruined by this guy.Looking at the boy\u2019s hurt face, Ye Wan Wan stroked her forehead in silence, \u201cThe things I told you yesterday were also true, don\u2019t you believe me?\u201dWhat did she tell me yesterday?The part where she said that she has a boyfriend?\u201cYeah right!\u201d Ling Dong replied boldly.\u201cI\u2019ll bring you to meet him tonight.\u201d Ye Wan Wan replied so softly that only Ling Dong and Si Xia beside her could hear.Ling Dong suddenly realised who the \u201chim\u201d was and a flicker of amazement crossed his face but he quickly regained his composure, \u201cSure!\u201dFinally, class ended.After dinner, there was no one in the school garden. Ye Wan Wan called Ling Dong out and both of them went to a restaurant not far away from school.Ling Dong sat on the sofa opposite her with a look of certainty, as if he had already seen through Ye Wan Wan\u2019s scheme.She would either give up and say it was all an act, or she would find someone to act as her boyfriend. The latter was more probable unless the guy was blind and couldn\u2019t see her ridiculous get-up.Either way, he would never give up!Ye Wan Wan naturally knew what was on Ling Dong\u2019s mind and didn\u2019t offer any explanation. She looked at the time on her phone\u2013Si Ye Han should arrive in about twenty minutes.\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d Ling Dong suddenly asked.Ye Wan Wan nodded, \u201cYes?\u201dLing Dong stared at Ye Wan Wan\u2019s heavily powdered face and coughed lightly, \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re so beautiful\u2026 Why do you do this to yourself on purpose\u2026\u201dYe Wan Wan took a sip of her juice and blinked, \u201cBecause my boyfriend likes it!\u201dLing Dong was speechless like he got choked on dog food.\u201cWan Wan, you don\u2019t have to pretend anymore, is it that hard to accept me? Even though I\u2019m not as good looking as Si Xia, I dare say I\u2019m not too shabby too. Anyway, when we\u2019re together, I\u2019ll never let anybody bully you and you can walk freely in school!\u201d Ling Dong\u2019s tone was full of confidence. Of course, he had the ability to make all of that happen.Ling Dong\u2019s popularity in school was only second to that of Si Xia, otherwise, his affection wouldn\u2019t have caused everybody to hate her.Ye Wan Wan rested her chin, \u201cI only have feelings for my boyfriend~\u201dLing Dong gave a helpless expression, then his eyes slightly glistened, \u201cFine, Wan Wan, since you insist that I don\u2019t believe you, I\u2019ll start believing you now. I\u2019ll believe everything you said, believe that you have a boyfriend and believe that your boyfriend treats you as well as you said. But what if your words are proven to be false and you were lying to me this whole time?\u201dYe Wan Wan took a big bite of caramel pudding and without thinking, said, \u201cIf I was lying to you, then I\u2019ll agree to be with you!\u201dAfter Ling Dong heard that, his face immediately brightened, \u201cAre you serious?\u201dYe Wan Wan nodded sincerely, \u201cOf course I am!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He casually replied, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I can wait.\u201dSi Ye Han was usually very busy so it was normal for him to be delayed. Ye Wan Wan didn\u2019t think much of it and continued to wait.Another half hour flew by.Si Ye Han still hadn\u2019t arrived.But Xu Yi called again and informed her with an embarrassed tone, \u201d Ms Ye, 9th master hasn\u2019t settled things here, you might have to wait some more\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, let him finish up his work first!\u201d Ye Wan Wan replied, not fussing at all.Ling Dong, who was sitting opposite, looked at Ye Wan Wan, \u201cWhy? He\u2019s been delayed again?\u201dYe Wan Wan nodded, \u201cSo sorry, he\u2019s extremely busy!\u201dLing Dong played along, \u201cNo problem, I don\u2019t have anything to do anyway, we can take our time!\u201dJust like that, one long hour went by and the restaurant was emptying out.After the hour, Xu Yi called for the third time.This time, Xu Yi sounded even weirder. He was trembling in fear like he was about to cry. Ye Wan Wan wasn\u2019t sure what kind of trouble he\u2019d gotten into.\u201cI\u2019m truly sorry, 9th master is still not done\u2026\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Ye Wan Wan felt that something was off. Could it be that something serious happened? Or did Si Ye Han actually not want to come?But that couldn\u2019t be; if Si Ye Han didn\u2019t want to come, he could\u2019ve rejected her outright. There was no point in him agreeing and then keep getting Xu Yi to give her excuses.\u201cHow about\u2026 We meet another day?\u201d Ye Wan Wan suggested.Xu Yi panicked immediately, \u201cNo! Please! I\u2019m really sorry Ms Ye. 9th master can\u2019t leave at the moment, but he\u2019ll be there tonight no matter what. Please wait a little longer, please!\u201d\u201cErm, alright then!\u201dAfter Xu Yi\u2019s pleading, Ye Wan Wan could only agree but she was very curious. What exactly was happening over at Si Ye Han\u2019s house?After Ye Wan Wan hung up the phone for the third time, Ling Dong looked at the time, stared at her and said, \u201cWan Wan, if this so-called boyfriend you mentioned doesn\u2019t show up by 12 a.m. tonight, can it be considered that you were lying to me?\u201dYe Wan Wan thought about Xu Yi promising that Si Ye Han would show up tonight no matter what and nodded in the end, \u201cYes.\u201dLing Dong\u2019s face lit up after hearing this and relaxed.

She leaned on her chin at first, then she started lying on the table and subsequently, fell asleep.Ling Dong kept an intense watch over the time initially but when he raised his gaze, he realised that Ye Wanwan was sleeping soundly.He stared at the way the girl slept and the fleeting glimpse from that night appeared in his head. His ears started burning bright red.She\u2019d said plainly that if she was lying to him, then she\u2019d be his girlfriend. Did she agree because she actually liked him?Ling Dong glanced at the time again and became quite excited. Passionately, he reached out to the girl\u2019s face, \u201cWanwan\u2026\u201dAt this moment, there was a smash and the restaurant\u2019s glass door was forced open by a slender and fair hand, accompanied by a gust of night wind.\u201cSo sorry, our restaurant is closed\u2026 Erm\u2026\u201d That was the voice of the restaurant owner, dissipating into the night wind.The sound of footsteps came closer and closer.Ling Dong felt an inexplicable chill on his back and looked at the door subconsciously.In the next second, his pupils constricted.In his line of sight was a man walking towards him slowly.The man was in a vintage classic black suit. His glacial eyes looked as if they were capable of freezing his soul.As he walked over step by step, it seemed like he didn\u2019t resemble a person at all. He looked like a demon king who travelled with the night wind and used the light of the moon to reach the earth. The spacious restaurant suddenly appeared narrow and cramped.Looking at the man\u2019s refined disposition and devilishly good looks, Ye Wanwan\u2019s words appeared in Ling Dong\u2019s head\u2026A thousand times better looking than Si Xia\u2026There was actually a person like that in this world, and this was him!Just as Ling Dong regained his senses and realised he was gaping at the man, the man was suddenly standing right in front of him.\u201cUh\u2026 You\u2026 Can I help you with anything?\u201d Ling Dong asked subconsciously.The man didn\u2019t reply and looked coldly at him. Ling Dong felt like he was his prey, being devoured at his throat.As Ling Dong\u2019s body stiffened up, a cold sweat covered his forehead. Ye Wanwan, who was totally unconscious and in deep sleep, started falling off the side.Seeing that Ye Wanwan was about to fall, Ling Dong started to reach out for her\u2026The man standing opposite used a relaxed, subtle and wickedly fast tilt of his body and caught the girl instead, who landed right into his arms.Ling Dong looked at the man holding on to Ye Wanwan, hugging her, and his gaze tightened.Ye Wanwan woke up in a shock, rubbed her eyes in a daze and looked at the person in front of her. She blanked out for a while. Then, slowly, she rubbed the man\u2019s body and grumbled, \u201cWhat took you so long\u2026\u201dThe man looked at the girl in his arms; his cold gaze completely contrasted with his warm expression.Ling Dong looked at Ye Wanwan and then at this man. What\u2019s\u2026 What\u2019s going on?While Ling Dong stared blankly, the man started hoisting Ye Wanwan up.Ling Dong finally regained his senses and blurted out, \u201cWait, put her down! Who are you?\u201dIn the next moment, the chilly atmosphere around them intensified.The man looked at the girl in his arms and while Ling Dong continued staring at him in shock, he slowly lowered his head and kissed the girl on her outrageously coloured lips\u2026Translator\u2019s Thoughtseunimon_ eunimon_Hi!

But being so close to Si Ye Han wasn\u2019t as repulsive as she\u2019d imagined.Between each breath, she could smell a light aroma of fruit trees. It was different from the usual cold vibe from Si Ye Han, but it smelled pretty good.It might\u2019ve been her illusion but this man was clearly still in the same old black outfit tonight, yet it gave her a very grand and formal vibe.He never wore cologne but he did today. His subtle, luxurious, antique black cufflinks, his metallic tie clip and his suit\u2019s design looked similar to his other suits but after looking closely at the design, it appeared to be brand new\u2026The scariest thing was that this guy was too\u2026 handsome tonight\u2026She was blinded by Si Ye Han, even though she was so used to seeing that face of his.Recalling Ling Dong\u2019s face now, she couldn\u2019t help but find it hilarious. This poor child\u2019s three values would probably be shattered into pieces tonight.Xu Yi stood by the restaurant door and saw everything that happened inside, and he saw that the boy was still standing there in a daze.Xu Yi wiped his sweat and couldn\u2019t help but criticise his master silently. Master, must you go that far ?At this moment, Ye Wanwan had the same thought as well. Using Si Ye Han to fight a suitor of Ling Dong\u2019s rank was no different from using an ultimate boss to kill a beginner!\u201cErm\u2026 Please\u2026 Put me down\u2026\u201d said Ye Wanwan, after seeing that Si Ye Han was still carrying her, seemingly without the intention of putting her down.The man paused and the atmosphere became chilly in an instant. A moment later, he let her down.Ye Wanwan jumped onto the ground, lifted her little head to look at the man in front of her, and said eagerly, \u201cCan you carry me on your back\u2026\u201dThe man looked surprised after he heard that and immediately, bent forward in front of her slowly.Ye Wanwan immediately climbed up onto the man\u2019s back, hugged his neck with both hands and yawned lazily, \u201cThis feels much better\u2026\u201dXu Yi watched how the both of them interacted and his heart was like a rollercoaster, going up and down.He suddenly realised that whenever Ye Wanwan initiated intimacy, his violent and terrifying master became unbelievably docile.On the silent and empty road, the man carried the girl as he walked back to school slowly.Feeling her little head nodding on his back, the man asked, \u201cTired?\u201dYe Wanwan nuzzled her head on his shoulders and nodded, \u201cYeah\u2026 Did something urgent happen to you today, was it important?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dYe Wanwan wasn\u2019t fully convinced, \u201cReally? But on the phone just now, housekeeper Xu sounded like he was about to cry!\u201dShe shot a suspicious look over to Xu Yi as she spoke.Xu Yi\u2019s back stiffened and quickly waved his hands, \u201cOh, Ms Ye, it\u2019s really nothing, it has all been settled.\u201dEven if you beat him to death, he would never dare to reveal that his elegant and aloof master went through outfit changes for three hours, tortured over ten stylists and made every servant in the house cry, before leaving the house\u2026Translator\u2019s Thoughtseunimon_ eunimon_Three values refer to the worldview, values of worth and philosophy on life.

Going by Ling Dong\u2019s reaction just now, he\u2019ll definitely give up this time. After all, my boyfriend is so handsome! You\u2019d beat him in a beauty contest in a second even if you wore a sack!\u201dListening to the girl gloating, the iciness beneath Si Ye Han\u2019s eyes immediately melted; it was obvious that Ye Wanwan\u2019s sucking up did the trick.Xu Yi\u2019s face was covered with tears as he listened.Even if he wore a sack? My lady, if you said so earlier, then people like us wouldn\u2019t have to go through such torture tonight!He finally understood that ten thousand compliments from all of them couldn\u2019t compare to a single compliment of \u201chandsome\u201d from this girl.The restaurant wasn\u2019t far from school and they arrived at their destination shortly after.Ye Wanwan jumped off the man\u2019s back, \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201dThe man turned and looked at the girl in front of him, his expression becoming cold again.Ye Wanwan felt that his mood was really like the weather in March\u2013overcast and unpredictable.At the same time, in a little flowerbed not far from where Ye Wanwan and Si Ye Han were, stood two students: a boy and a girl.The girl looked sweet and cute, dressed in a short pink skirt and had a delicately wrapped paper box in her hand. She stood timidly in front of the boy, \u201cSi\u2026 Si Xia\u2026 I\u2026 I like you\u2026 I made these chocolates myself\u2026 I hope you like them\u2026\u201dThe boy standing opposite was dressed in oversized pyjamas like he had come from his dorm just before bed. But this didn\u2019t seem to ruin his charm at all, but instead, it made him look even more casual and informal than usual, making the girl\u2019s heart flutter.At that moment, the boy whose face could charm all the girls looked disinterested and unconcerned, with a flash of impatience and annoyance, \u201cI don\u2019t have a sweet tooth.\u201dThe girl\u2019s face turned pale. She acted like she didn\u2019t mind and spoke pleadingly, \u201cRight\u2026 Then I\u2019ll make something else next time\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd I don\u2019t like you.\u201dAfter the boy was done talking, he turned and left immediately without a care for the girl.Just as he was walking towards the dorm, the boy suddenly heard a familiar voice in the quiet air\u2014\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201dSi Xia paused and turned towards the direction of that voice subconsciously.Ye Wanwan?The boy furrowed his brows and hid in the shadows. He looked through the gaps between the branches and saw that under the nearby streetlights, Ye Wanwan was standing there talking to a man.The man had his back to him and he could only see a faint figure, but with just one look, Si Xia\u2019s face changed.Si Ye Han!How could it be?Si Xia\u2019s face was filled with fear and uncertainty. He continued watching and saw that Ye Wanwan went up on her tiptoes and lightly kissed the man on his cheek, \u201cGoodnight!\u201dShe then left while turning and waving to the man.At that moment, the slender and cold figure turned and the man stretched his arms out to grab the girl who hadn\u2019t managed to go far. He brought her into his embrace with one move, bent his body and gave one last, passionate kiss\u2026As Si Xia looked at the man\u2019s face, he was dumbstruck and stood rooted to the ground\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could only see that the man was turning away while Ye Wanwan walked in the direction of the girls\u2019 dormitory.Si Xia stared at Ye Wanwan\u2019s back and stood in the dark for a long time.Then his phone rang with a text message. He peeked at his phone and walked towards the boys\u2019 dormitory.Just as he reached the first level of the dormitory, he saw Cheng Xue standing there.Although it was already very late, Cheng Xue was still dressed neatly. She wore a beautiful dress without a single wrinkle. If you looked closely enough, you could see that she also had on exquisite, yet natural makeup.\u201cWhy have you been outside?\u201d Cheng Xue looked in the direction that Si Xia appeared from, as darkness flashed beneath her eyes.It seemed like the news was right; some shameless girl was trying to seduce him in the middle of the night!\u201cIs anything the matter?\u201d Si Xia\u2019s tone was much more pleasant when he spoke to Cheng Xue than when he spoke to that other girl earlier.\u201cCan\u2019t I just drop by? Lately, you\u2019ve always been busy with that ugly freak Ye Wanwan, and there are always girls harassing you during the day. I don\u2019t have any chances to talk to you!\u201d Cheng Xue was unhappy and grumbled with a bit of playfulness.\u201cIf nothing\u2019s the matter then we\u2019ll talk tomorrow\u2013I have something to do now.\u201d Si Xia spoke as he entered the dormitory staircase.Cheng Xue was flustered by that, \u201cIt\u2019s so late already, what do you have to do? Was that Han Xiao Ru with you just now?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Si Xia didn\u2019t deny it.Cheng Xue clenched her fist tightly, \u201cWhat did she want?\u201dSi Xia: \u201cTo give me chocolates.\u201dHan Xiao Ru, that girl!Cheng Xue gritted her teeth right after hearing that, but seeing that Si Xia was empty-handed, it was obvious that he didn\u2019t accept them and then she was happy once more, \u201cThe girls in this school are so annoying to harass you every day! She actually gave you chocolates but doesn\u2019t she know that you\u2019re allergic to cocoa powder?\u201dShe then took out a bag and gave it to him, \u201cThis is your favourite almond cake\u2013you can have it for breakfast tomorrow!\u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d Si Xia accepted the gift.Seeing that Si Xia accepted her cake, Cheng Xue\u2019s gloomy mood immediately disappeared. She stared at that dazzling face and said shyly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so polite with me. I can make it for you next time if you like it! Auntie Si said that my baking skills are getting better!\u201dI knew that he sees me differently from all those other girls!Tsk, I can\u2019t believe all these wildflowers and weeds in school are actually trying to snatch my man!\u201cI won\u2019t keep you then, have an early night after you\u2019re done with your work!\u201dKnowing that he no longer had any business with Han Xiao Ru, Cheng Xue was relieved. With her crazily pounding heart, she ran off excitedly.However, the girl didn\u2019t know that once she left, the polite, courteous expression of the boy immediately disappeared, revealing an indifferent expression that completely contrasted with the usual perfect image he had in front of her; it even had a hint of disgust and contempt.The boy walked a few steps ahead leisurely and casually threw the delicately wrapped cake into the garbage can next to him.After he entered, the boy didn\u2019t go to his own dorm.

Furthermore, like the school\u2019s goddess, Cheng Xue, he was clearly not from a simple family; he was from a completely different world from nobodies like them. Besides, Si Xia always kept to himself; he didn\u2019t usually hang out with them, not to mention dropping by in the middle of the night.So seeing him here at this late hour, the boy was inevitably surprised, \u201cDo you need something?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for Ling Dong,\u201d Si Xia replied.\u201cOh, you\u2019re looking for Dong ge [1]. He just came back, it\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d The boy scratched his head, looking rather vexed, \u201cYou\u2019re here at a bad time, Dong ge isn\u2019t really in a good state right now\u2026\u201d\u201cNot in a good state?\u201d\u201cCome in, you\u2019ll understand once you see it for yourself!\u201d The boy sighed and opened the door.Just as Si Xia stepped inside, a pungent smell of alcohol overwhelmed him.After Si Xia entered, the boy quickly closed the door, afraid that the smell of alcohol would escape and expose them to the dorm inspector.He saw that Ling Dong was sitting on the floor like a puddle of mud, seemingly completely drunk beyond his senses and mumbling Ye Wanwan\u2019s name.\u201cWanwan\u2026 Wanwan\u2026 Why do you treat me like that\u2026 Why didn\u2019t I find out sooner\u2026\u201dWith just one look at his condition, anyone with a discerning eye would know immediately that he was heartbroken.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Si Xia glanced at the three boys in the dorm.The three boys looked at one another. The boy who just opened the door stepped closer and said mysteriously, \u201cDong ge went to meet Ye Wanwan\u2019s boyfriend this evening! Ye Wanwan actually has a boyfriend! Can you believe it?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Si Xia\u2019s eyes glistened slightly.\u201cThat\u2019s right! At first, we all thought that Ye Wanwan was lying about having a boyfriend in order to turn Dong ge off. She even said that her boyfriend was extremely good-looking, bragging non-stop! Who would believe her? But, who could\u2019ve guessed that when Dong ge went, he actually got to meet the guy!\u201d\u201cMore than just meet\u2013according to Dong ge, that man was so handsome he could shatter the skies, and compared to you, Si Xia, he was\u2026 \u201d the boy sighed and stopped.\u201cOh, better looking than me, right?\u201d Si Xia spoke softly.The boy rubbed his nose and answered awkwardly, \u201cAnyway, that was what Dong ge said. We all suspected that he\u2019s drunk. Otherwise, how could he have said such nonsense!\u201d\u201cHow could there be any good looking and blind man in this world that would fall in love with Ye Wanwan?\u201d\u201cExactly, so what if Ye Wanwan has a boyfriend? Dong ge still has a chance to win her over right?\u201dWhile the boys were conversing, Ling Dong, who was drunk in the corner, waved his beer bottle and shouted in anger, \u201cDamn it\u2026 Handsome\u2026 So handsome he could turn me gay\u2026 As if I could fight him\u2026\u201dThe three boys on the side: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat the hell do you mean that he was so handsome he could turn you gay?!Dong ge, calm down a little, Dong ge!Si Xia glanced at Ling Dong and after a few moments, he walked over to him and squatted down. Then, he passed his phone to him, \u201cWas it him you saw this evening?\u201dLing Dong looked at Si Xia\u2019s phone in a daze. In the next second, his drunkard expression suddenly sobered up and he sat up quivering suddenly, \u201cYou\u2026 Why would you have a picture of Ye Wanwan\u2019s boyfriend?\u201dHearing that, Si Xia closed both his eyes immediately and beneath his eyes was a significant darkness.Si Ye Han\u2026It was really him\u2026That woman in Jin garden actually was Ye Wanwan, his classmate from the same school and class, right under his nose!Translator\u2019s Thoughtseunimon_ eunimon_[1]: Ge in Chinese means elder brother and also a way of addressing someone of a higher authority.

Zhao Xing Zhou\u2019s face suddenly became stern and said, \u201cAll right all right, calm down everybody. Why aren\u2019t you guys so excited to see me?\u201d\u201cTeacher, you\u2019re not handsome!\u201d some girls retorted immediately.\u201cHey, what did you just say?

Continue with the questions then!\u201d\u2026After messing around for awhile, everybody continued with the questions, but it was very obvious that all the bewitched girls were not fully focused on their studies anymore.After Si Xia sat down, he glanced through the practice questions once and did not bother with them any further. He laid his head down and started sleeping as usual.Ye Wanwan was filled with jealousy\u2013far from handing in blank exam papers like her, this chap knew how to do every question.Compared to how she had to memorise sample answers and scoring well out of sheer luck on her last test, Si Xia always got perfect marks for math, aside from the times when he purposely skipped exams.In her eyes, this kind of person was a total anomaly.Certainly, there must be no normal human in the Si family!Ye Wanwan was bitterly doing her work while cursing under her breath when she suddenly felt a weight on her shoulder and fresh clean scent wafted into her nose.Ye Wanwan turned her head stiffly to look and realised that Si Xia had slumped over in his sleep and was now leaning on her shoulder!!!At that moment, there was an uproar in class\u2013the girls who had fixed their attention on Si Xia this whole time dropped their jaws. Cheng Xue\u2019s glare was murderous.\u201cDamn damn damn! Si Xia actually\u2026 actually leaned against her shoulder!\u201d\u201cYe Wanwan, this slut!\u201d\u201cNobody stop me, I\u2019m going to break that ugly freak\u2019s claws!\u201d\u2026As Ye Wanwan faced the murderous stares from all the girls in the class, she hurriedly tried to reposition the sleeping beauty on her shoulder carefully.Oh my god, save me!How is this my fault? I\u2019m a victim too, right?But if she really said those words out loud, she might be beaten to death so she could only swallow her words down.Thankfully, when she was halfway through moving him, Si Xia awoke.That sleepy face and lazy eyes are simply\u2026 too dreamy!After looking at Si Ye Han\u2019s face for so many years, she thought she was already immune to his beauty yet she was still electrified by just a glance.Although Si Xia really couldn\u2019t compare to Si Ye Han; they were entirely different species.Si Ye Han was dangerous and mysterious, egotistical and arrogant while at the moment, Si Xia was the kind of king who could charm thousands of girls.After Si Xia woke up, he rubbed his forehead lazily and glanced at Ye Wanwan\u2019s question booklet, \u201cThis question\u2026\u201dYe Wanwan looked over, surprised, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou got this question wrong, and this, this is wrong too\u2026\u201dWatching Si Xia picking out numerous questions, Ye Wanwan\u2019s brows twitched and she took a deep breath, \u201cJust tell me which questions I got right!\u201dSi Xia\u2019s fair and slender fingers pointed at two of the questions, \u201cYou got two multiple choice questions right.\u201d\u201cThese two questions\u2026. were wild guesses!\u201dYe Wanwan was so sad that she wanted to bang her head on the desk.I thought my math wasn\u2019t that bad!\u201cI can teach you,\u201d Si Xia smiled.Translator\u2019s Thoughtseunimon_ eunimon_Oh my gosh, what are you up to Si Xia!!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Usually, he would be lying on the desk asleep and wouldn\u2019t even look at her the whole day.But today, he actually took the initiative to talk with her, and even offered to teach her math?*cough* \u201cNo thanks, I don\u2019t want to die a humiliating death! By the way\u2026 Where did you go today? Why\u2019d you only come to last period? All the girls were going crazy from missing you!\u201dMost importantly, everyone blamed me for his absence!Ye Wanwan thought out loud, \u201cIf Si Xia really didn\u2019t come because of me, then I should just ask the teacher to change seats. I can\u2019t change my role in the play, but at the very least I want to try to change seats\u2026\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Si Xia asked softly.\u201cYes!\u201d Ye Wanwan nodded, then took the opportunity to ask, \u201cYou didn\u2019t come today, was it because\u2026\u201dThen, before Ye Wanwan could finish, Si Xia interrupted her and asked, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cHuh? What about me?\u201d Ye Wanwan didn\u2019t understand what Si Xia was trying to get at.Si Xia looked at her shyly and said, \u201cDid you miss me?\u201dYe Wanwan was completely dumbfounded: \u201c\u2026\u201dDamn!!!What game is he trying to play?!Ye Wanwan\u2019s body was covered in goosebumps and as she stared back in shock, her whole face in terror, she asked, \u201cYou\u2026 Do you have a fever?\u201d\u201cAll right, everybody please stop! I\u2019m going to take up the questions now. If you had any trouble with the questions, listen up and pay attention!\u201dZhao Xing Zhou\u2019s words cut through the strange atmosphere.Ye Wanwan clutched her chest, her whole face frightened and uncertain while still thinking about those words that scared her half to death!Is this guy just teasing me?By the end of the class, the girls were glaring at her so hard she thought they would burn a hole in her body.Although they couldn\u2019t hear what Si Xia and she were talking about, they were fully aware that today Si Xia not only leaned on her shoulder but he even spoke to her for the first time. No matter the topic, it was enough to make people want to beat up and drown Ye Wanwan.All the girls in school had a consensus that Si Xia belonged to all of them and nobody was allowed to fight for him. If this unspoken rule was broken, the offender would become a public enemy.Even if a girl wanted to break the rule, she would only dare to confess her love to Si Xia secretly, lest she faces the wrath of the others.If she was found out, she wouldn\u2019t be able to come to school anymore.On the surface, it looked like Ye Wanwan had actually dared to seduce Si Xia in front of everyone and thus attracted quite a lot of hatred.Of course, the reality was that Si Xia had leaned against her accidentally and it was also Si Xia who initiated the conversation, but nobody cared about these facts\u2013the person who was in the wrong was obviously Ye Wanwan!Ye Wanwan initially thought that this would all be over after school. Who knew that Si Xia, who had missed rehearsals consecutively for so many days, would actually show up today?At rehearsal, Ye Wanwan rehearsed distractedly with her brows furrowed. She began to have a strange ominous premonition\u2026Si Xia sat against the window and as usual, he was surrounded by a group of girls making a big fuss over him.\u201cSi Xia, that ugly freak is getting more and more out of hand\u2013she even harrassed you in class!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry Si Xia, we\u2019ve already submitted a petition demanding to switch Ye Wanwan out.

You must be nauseous after that math class!\u201d\u2026While the girls bombarded Si Xia, the other students preceding him had finished rehearsing and it was now his turn.The class monitor walked up to Si Xia and asked weakly, \u201cUm\u2026 Si Xia, it\u2019s your turn, do you\u2026 want to rehearse today?\u201dWith everyone\u2019s attention, Si Xia slowly stood up from his seat and glanced at the stage, \u201cOf course.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Nice?Could someone save me from this guy?!Ye Wanwan was so shaken up that she started to touch up her makeup to calm her nerves, but her eyeliner came out crooked as her hands shook and she even smudged her lipstick.Si Xia glanced at Ye Wanwan\u2019s face and a fleeting smile appeared on his gentle face, but in the next moment he took a deep breath and said, \u201cLet\u2019s start rehearsing!\u201dSince Si Xia himself wanted to rehearse, the flock of girls surrounding him were powerless to do anything and could only sit and watch unwillingly.The rehearsal of the final act \u201cMeet the Prince\u201d began.After Snow White was poisoned, a prince rode his white horse through the forest, lost his way and found a little wooden house by some strange coincidence. There, he saw seven little dwarves mourning for Princess Snow White.Si Xia slowly walked towards the table where Ye Wanwan lay and gazed at the girl\u2019s face with his glass-like eyes filled with deep emotion and sadness.All the people watching were full of admiration.Wow! The hunk\u2019s acting skills today are off the charts!Ye Wanwan\u2019s role in this scene of the play tested everybody to the MAX\u2013 the girls had to imagine this \u201cugly freak\u201d as the world\u2019s most beautiful Princess Snow White\u2026After this, the most disturbing scene was about to begin\u2013the prince giving a kiss of true love to wake up the sleeping Snow White.Si Xia stroked the girl\u2019s hair lightly. With one arm propped beside her, he then slowly bent his body down\u2026His motions made all the girls blush; with hearts pounding, they each wanted to rush up on stage to lay down in Ye Wanwan\u2019s place.\u201cOh I\u2019m so mad! I really want to be kissed by the hunk as well!\u201d\u201cThe hunk\u2019s too nice and gentle, yet he still forced himself to rehearse this scene!\u201d\u201cBut someone is taking advantage of his gentleness! Shame on her!\u201dEverybody gritted their teeth. With aching hearts, they collectively prepared a bottle of mineral water and garbage bin for Si Xia.Meanwhile, as Si Xia stroked the girl\u2019s hair lightly, he accidentally brushed her neck and his fingers suddenly stiffened up.Ye Wanwan\u2019s skin was as fair as goat\u2019s milk; one word immediately surfaced in his mind when he touched it: delicate.Si Xia was a little taken aback and retracted his fingers quickly like he had just gotten burnt while the ends of his ears started reddening. He immediately calmed himself down, bent down again and edged closer to the girl bit by bit\u2026Cheng Xue, who was watching, suddenly stood up and shouted, \u201cWhat is going on?!\u201dAll the other girls were stunned as well.Why didn\u2019t Si Xia run away as usual when he got this close? This time, he\u2019s actually leaning closer and closer!Everybody watched as the distance between the two of them shrank. Even if they were just getting in position, they didn\u2019t have to be that close.Damn! What is going on? Could it be that Si Xia really wants to do it for real?Even the distracted Ling Dong, who was watching from the corner of the room, suddenly changed his expression when he realised what was happening.Although Ye Wanwan had closed her eyes, she could feel Si Xia\u2019s breath. When she felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right, she quickly opened her eyes.

It looked like they realised something was wrong so they were ordered by Cheng Xue to bring reinforcement.Everybody sighed in relief instantly at the sight of Ms. Liang and Ye Wanwan also quickly took the chance to sit up.Unsure if it was her imagination, Ye Wanwan thought she saw a shred of disappointment on Si Xia\u2019s face as if he was unhappy at the interruption.Liang Li Hua held the petition in her hand and turned to stare at Ye Wanwan in annoyance, \u201cYe Wanwan, why is it you all the time? How much trouble are you going to make before you\u2019re satisfied?\u201dShe then turned to the crowd and said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen everybody\u2019s concerns, and initially, we assigned the roles randomly so that it would be fair.

Finally, the moment she had been waiting for.But at this moment, an unexpected voice came from her side, \u201cI object.\u201dThe person who spoke was Si Xia.Cheng Xue quickly ran to Si Xia and pulled at his shirt while whining softly, \u201cSi Xia, what are you talking about? The teacher has already agreed, why are you still so stubborn?\u201dYe Wanwan looked at Si Xia warily. W hat is this guy trying to do this time\u2026?The boy\u2019s icy gaze swept across the room, \u201cIf the roles are going to be changed over and over, are we then going to change the next candidate halfway as well? Anyway, there isn\u2019t much time left until the performance\u2013if we choose someone else, we\u2019ll have to start from scratch. We\u2019ve been rehearsing well aside from the final act and the problem with that act lies with me. I now have things under control and I promise that rehearsals will proceed smoothly from here on.\u201dNot only were the students stunned but Liang Li Hua had never considered the possibility that Si Xia would object. She furrowed her brows and said, \u201cBut even if you can act successfully, Ye Wanwan\u2019s image is still a big problem.\u201dSi Xia replied without a change in his expression, \u201cThere is a certain artistic flair and exaggeration in the theatre\u2013Ye Wanwan\u2019s image is not a problem at all. Besides, in the later stages, we could use some styling and masks to conceal and solve the problem. I will discuss all these concerns with the class monitor and bring a viable and detailed proposal to you.\u201dAfter Si Xia had presented his views, Liang Li Hua was unhappy but couldn\u2019t protest any further, \u201cIf you insist, I won\u2019t object, but if there\u2019s a problem\u2026\u201dActually, she considered Ye Wanwan to be a secondary problem\u2013her biggest issue lay with Si Xia.
