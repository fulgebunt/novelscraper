In fact, many of them were older than him. However, the Dao Academy held the accomplished disciples with high regard. He had entered the Dao Academy\u2019s Mountain River Pavilion two years ago. The twenty-two disciples from the Mountain River Pavilion were also the strongest twenty-two disciples of Mirror Lake Dao Academy. They were admired by many junior brothers and sisters. As for Senior Brother Meng, he was highly respected because he often gave them pointers. The other seniors from the Mountain River Pavilion couldn\u2019t be bothered wasting time on them.\u201cYoung Master, Young Master!\u201d A familiar voice sounded out from the side.A green-dressed girl ran out from the side. Meng Chuan chuckled when he saw this. \u201cGreen Bamboo, why are you here?\u201d\u201cMy lady wishes for you to tour the East Mountain with her. It snowed heavily last night, making for a beautiful snowy landscape,\u201d said the green-robed maiden with a giggle.\u201cVisit East Mountain?\u201d Meng Chuan frowned and said, \u201cEast Mountain is too far away. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll be spending the night at East Mountain if we make the trip. We\u2019ll only be back tomorrow.\u201dThe green-robed maiden laughed. \u201cOur Yun family happens to own a villa in East Mountain that would serve as your accommodation.\u201dMeng Chuan shook his head and said, \u201cGo back and tell Qingping that the Jadesun Palace\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet will be in a month. I need to focus on my cultivation and prepare myself. I cannot accompany her.\u201d\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d The green-robed maiden hesitated.\u201cJust tell her that when you get back,\u201d instructed Meng Chuan. \u201cAlso, make her spend more time cultivating. She shouldn\u2019t be thinking about having fun all the time.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d The green-robed maiden had no choice but to obediently answer him and return to report to her lady.Meng Chuan shook his head slightly.Yun Qingping\u2014who he had been engaged to since he was young\u2014left him exasperated.\u2026Mirror Lake Dao Academy was built on the eastern shore of Mirror Lake. There were many residences on the west bank of Mirror Lake. One of them was Meng Manor.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d There were two guards at the entrance of the manor, and they were rather respectful when they saw Meng Chuan.\u201cIs my father in?\u201d\u201cMaster went to the ancestral mansion after they sent someone over. It happened just a moment ago,\u201d said the guard.Meng Chuan nodded thoughtfully and entered the manor.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!!!Very quickly, he heard the whistling sound of arrows. He followed the sounds and arrived at the training grounds.There was a red-dressed girl shooting arrows. An arrow traversed hundreds of feet and landed on a target dummy. Each subsequent arrow struck its predecessor\u2019s shaft, one after another.Meng Chuan watched from the side as she practiced her archery.Her name was Liu Qiyue\u2014the only daughter of his father\u2019s friend, Liu Yebai. It was a friendship forged through life and death situations.When Meng Chuan was eight, Liu Yebai brought his daughter to Meng Manor and took up residence ever since.Qiyue was very similar to him\u2014they had lost their mothers when they were young. They had cultivated together from a young age to this very day; thus, they enjoyed a deep relationship.\u201cAh Chuan, you\u2019re back.\u201d The red-dressed girl\u2019s eyes lit up when she saw Meng Chuan. \u201cIt\u2019s so boring shooting these target dummies. Come, be my target dummy. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that I was waiting for you, I would have gone to the Dao Academy to practice my archery. The Dao Academy\u2019s archery field is much larger.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be your target dummy.\u201d Meng Chuan smiled and walked to the center of the training grounds.The red-dressed girl switched quivers\u2014none of the arrows had arrowheads. Her eyes lit up as she looked at Meng Chuan. \u201cAh Chuan, you have to be careful. Don\u2019t get thrashed by me again.\u201d\u201cYou be careful, too. This time, I will definitely crack your Seven Star Strafe.\u201d Meng Chuan focused, awaiting the barrage of attacks.Liu Qiyue giggled. Following that, her fingers moved like a phantom. She instantly drew her bow and fired, as though aiming was unnecessary.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!Arrow after arrow shot out as she repeated the entire process over and over\u2014removing an arrow from the quiver on her back, drawing her bow and shooting\u2026 It was akin to a normal person breathing. Every arrow was stunningly fast and powerful.The saber at Meng Chuan\u2019s waist was already unsheathed.Any arrow flying towards him was blocked by the domain formed by his blade trajectories.\u201cAh Chuan, your saber arts are becoming more and more powerful. From the looks of it, I will need to use Seven Star Strafe,\u201d Liu Qiyue said with a cheeky smile as she shot. Clearly, it was very easy for her to shoot such arrows.Swoosh!Before the sound faded, the arrow shot out by the red-dressed girl was accompanied by an ear-piercing screech.Here it comes! Meng Chuan turned even more solemn.Pfft. Pfft.Meng Chuan\u2019s sword produced an arc, blocking the arrows like a dome. However, the Seven Star Strafe was a killer move that consumed a great deal of Quintessential Energy. The projectile speed would only increase with each arrow.At the sixth arrow, Meng Chuan\u2019s saber missed. He then felt a pain in his chest before involuntarily stumbling. His chest was probably bruised.\u201cI still can\u2019t block it.\u201d Meng Chuan shook his head helplessly.\u201cYou\u2019ve already blocked four of the five killer moves I\u2019ve developed. All that\u2019s left is the Seven Star Strafe,\u201d said Liu Qiyue with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s already very impressive. Back in the Dao Academy, no one at the Marrow Cleansing realm is able to block my Triple Phantom Arrow, but you can.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been defending against your bow and arrows since I was young. Of course, I\u2019m better than those at your Dao Academy.\u201d Meng Chuan shook his head. \u201cBesides, your arrows are headless. Adding them would only make the arrows faster. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to fend off more than half of your five killer moves.\u201d\u201cAh Chuan, haven\u2019t you heard? When everyone\u2019s in the same realm, nobody can withstand the barrage of attacks from a sharpshooter,\u201d Liu Qiyue said smugly.\u201cQiyue\u2026 If it was a situation of life and death, I would\u2019ve rushed to your side.\u201d\u201cSharpshooters have guards.\u201d Liu Qiyue pursed her lips. \u201cMy guards will hold you back, then you will become my target dummy. Perhaps in the future, you will become my guard!\u201dMeng Chuan laughed.He knew very well how terrifying a sharpshooter was. In any faction, top sharpshooters enjoyed extremely high status and were protected very well.Qiyue was very talented in archery.\u201cAh Chuan, did your dean summon you today and inform you about the Jadesun Palace\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet?\u201d asked Liu Qiyue.\u201cYes, you\u2019ve gotten wind of it from your Blazing Sun Dao Academy too, I guess?\u201d asked Meng Chuan.\u201cYup! I\u2019m the only one at the Marrow Cleansing realm among the top ten disciples of Blazing Sun Dao Academy. The dean decided to give me a spot,\u201d said Liu Qiyue. \u201cIn the Jadesun Palace\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet, demon-slaying is the forte of us sharpshooters.\u201dMeng Chuan smiled and said, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m one of the top ten disciples at the Marrow Cleansing realm, I will still have to fight for one of the three spots that my Mirror Lake Dao Academy has for the Marrow Cleansing realm. If I don\u2019t get a spot, I won\u2019t have the right to go.\u201d\u201cThen have fun trying.\u201d Liu Qiyue chuckled.\u201cDon\u2019t be careless. You must not come into close proximity with the demons during the Jadesun Palace\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet,\u201d said Meng Chuan. \u201cLet\u2019s practice.\u201dWith that said, he suddenly lunged forward.\u201cCatch me if you can!\u201dLiu Qiyue immediately ducked and even turned around to shoot an arrow.\u2026Elsewhere, in one of the five major Godfiend clans of the Eastcalm Prefecture\u2014the Yun family.Yun Qingping was brewing tea for her father, Yun Fu\u2019an.\u201cDad, try some.\u201d Yun Qingping placed a cup of tea in front of her father in an obsequious manner. She suddenly caught sight of her maid, Green Bamboo, who had just returned from afar. Her eyes lit up as she immediately shouted, \u201cGreen Bamboo!\u201dGreen Bamboo could only obediently walk over.\u201cHow is it? What did Meng Chuan say?\u201d Yun Qingping asked immediately.\u201cYoung Master Meng said that Jadesun Palace\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet is in a month\u2019s time. He wants to focus on cultivation and prepare himself. He can\u2019t accompany you to East Mountain,\u201d whispered Green Bamboo.\u201cHe\u2019s not going again?\u201d Yun Qingping was somewhat infuriated. \u201cAll he knows is cultivation.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Meng wants me to tell you to spend more time cultivating. Don\u2019t always think about having fun all the time,\u201d added Green Bamboo.\u201cHe still wants to control me?\u201d Yun Qingping got even angrier.\u201cI think Meng Chuan is right.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an\u2014who was sitting there\u2014drank his tea happily and said, \u201cYou should cultivate well. Don\u2019t always be frolicking around.\u201d\u201cDad, this Meng Chuan is like a block of wood,\u201d Yun Qingping glanced at Yun Fu\u2019an and couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cWhen I was just a month old, you guys decided to engage me to Meng Chuan! But my personality is completely different from his. I like to play, and I like to invite many friends over to have fun. But he likes cultivation, drawing, and silence. We don\u2019t have any common topics when chatting. Just the thought of marrying him in the future drives me crazy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you are too good at stirring up trouble that I need someone like him to subdue you. It\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an said with a smile.Yun Qingping rushed to her father\u2019s side and hugged his arm. She wheedled. \u201cDad, I beg you. Go to the Meng family and tell Uncle Meng that we are canceling the engagement.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it!\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an drank his tea and denied her request immediately.\u201cDad!\u201dYun Qingping angrily said, \u201cWhy do you insist on forcing me to marry him? Back then, I didn\u2019t know a thing as a one-month-old baby, but you decided on my marriage. How did you know what Meng Chuan would be like when he grew up? You had no idea, but you insisted that I marry him. You have never cared about my thoughts. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too much?\u201d\u201cMeng Chuan is quite a good option,\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an said. \u201cHe\u2019s already excellent among the younger generation of the five Godfiend clans of the Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201d\u201cSo what if he\u2019s good? I don\u2019t like him!\u201d Yun Qingping said angrily. \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry a so-called genius who doesn\u2019t even share my interests.\u201dYun Fu\u2019an gently put down the teacup. He lifted his eyes and coldly stared at his daughter.Yun Qingping\u2019s heart trembled.But the pride in her heart made her raise her head and stare back at her father!\u201cIn the past six months, you\u2019ve already requested me to cancel your engagement six times,\u201d said Yun Fu\u2019an coldly. \u201cIt seems like I\u2019ve been spoiling you too much. I\u2019ll make it clear for you today.\u201dYun Qingping glared at her father.Yun Fu\u2019an continued, \u201cThe marriage between you and Meng Chuan is not only between the two of you. It is also a matter between the Yuns and the Mengs! Although our Yun family is one of the five major Godfiend clans, it has only been established for a few decades. We only have a few dozen clansmen, and we are still lacking in heritage. As for the Meng family, they are a Godfiend family that has been established for thousands of years, and they have over 10000 clansmen! Meng Chuan\u2019s father, Meng Dajiang, will become the next clan leader of the Meng family. You are the only daughter in the Yun family\u2019s third generation. If you marry Meng Chuan, it will naturally improve the ties between our two families. This will greatly benefit our Yun family.\u201d\u201cGrandfather has already cultivated to become a Godfiend,\u201d Yun Qingping retorted. \u201cWith Grandfather around, no one can shake the Yun family! In that case, why can\u2019t you let me live a freer life?\u201d\u201cFree? Freedom means marrying anyone you wish to marry?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an said coldly.\u201cWhy? Can\u2019t I?\u201d Yun Qingping raised her head and asked, \u201cAre you willing to sacrifice me for the family? Dad, don\u2019t you feel ashamed?\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dYun Fu\u2019an stood up in anger and furiously pointed at his daughter, yelling, \u201cYun Qingping, when you want to go out and have fun, there will be a group of servants following you. If you want to eat the Flaming Dragon Fish in the middle of winter, someone will risk their lives to find it for you. Even when you don\u2019t put effort into your cultivation, plenty of treasures are spent on you, allowing you to reach the Marrow Cleansing realm this year. I hired experts to give you one-on-one guidance, and because you are weak, I got three Mortal Shedding realm guards to protect you in secret. It costs 500 taels of silver to hire the three of them every month, not inclusive of all the other treasures needed to be bestowed\u2026\u201d\u201cFor your so-called carefree life, do you know how much the clan has sacrificed?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an stared at his daughter.Yun Qingping was stunned.She was not stupid.With a simple calculation, she knew what a staggering amount the family had to spend on her to keep up such a life.\u201cYou have enjoyed the benefits of the family, so you have to bear the consequences!\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an shouted furiously. \u201cYou want to just enjoy the benefits and not contribute anything? Dream on!\u201d\u201cAlso, I know that there\u2019s a little fellow in your Dao Academy named Zhang Chong. He\u2019s been quite attentive towards you recently, right?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an sneered. \u201cHe\u2019s just a boy who isn\u2019t from the main family line of the Zhang family. Does he think he\u2019s fit to marry my daughter? He should look at himself in the mirror and see who he is!\u201d\u201cDad, Senior Brother Zhang and I aren\u2019t\u2026\u201d Yun Qingping immediately tried to explain.\u201cAs long as I find out that anything is going on between the two of you that might taint the reputation of the Yun family and Meng family, not only will he die, even you won\u2019t be spared! I will not hold back!\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an coldly stared at his frightened daughter. \u201cWhen the time comes, don\u2019t blame me for being heartless.\u201dYun Qingping felt a chill run down her spine.She had never seen a side of her father this cold. She was only fifteen years old this year.\u201cDaughter.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an\u2019s expression softened. \u201cThat\u2019s what a marriage alliance between family clans is like. No matter how ugly or useless he is, you will have to marry him. My marriage with your mother was also decided by your grandfather. I didn\u2019t get a choice! Speaking of which, his character is quite good. You should be glad.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter saying that, Yun Fu\u2019an shot a look at the trembling female servant\u2014Green Bamboo\u2014and ordered, \u201cGreen Bamboo, watch over her. Don\u2019t let her make any further mistakes.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Green Bamboo hurriedly replied.Yun Fu\u2019an then left with his hands clasped behind his back.Yun Qingping stood there and stared blankly at her father\u2019s departing figure. She thought of the words \u201c\u2026 even you won\u2019t be spared! I will not hold back! When the time comes, don\u2019t blame me for being heartless.\u201d This sentence struck her, Yun Qingping, deeply.She felt that this world was different from what she had imagined all these years.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Swoosh!His saber arts were ethereal, bizarre, and unpredictable.Furthermore, he was extremely fast. This was one of the best swift saber arts that mortals could learn\u2014Falling Leaf Saber.When he was six, he had undergone the family\u2019s tests and was confirmed that he was the most talented in the swift saber arts. He loved to cultivate the swift saber because\u2026 it was fast!After practicing the basic saber arts for two years at home, his father\u2014Meng Dajiang\u2014sent him to one of the eight major Dao Academies in the Eastcalm Prefecture when he was eight years old. Although the dean of the Mirror Lake Dao Academy\u2014Ge Yu\u2014was of average moral character, he was the fastest at using the saber in the entire Eastcalm Prefecture!Meng Chuan had honed his basic saber arts to perfection when he was nine. His foundation was solid, and he was taught a good saber art\u2014Wind Chasing Saber.At the age of eleven, he had cultivated the Wind Chasing Saber to perfection. The dean then personally taught him his best saber art, the Falling Leaf Saber.At thirteen years old, he achieved the Greater Mastery stage for Falling Leaf Saber, and became one of the members of the Dao Academy\u2019s Mountain River Pavilion. Mountain River Pavilion only accepted the most outstanding disciples out of thousands of promising disciples in the entire Mirror Lake Dao Academy. Even now, Mountain River Pavilion only had 22 disciples.Now, he was fifteen years old.Unfortunately, my Falling Leaf Saber is still only at the Greater Mastery stage. I haven\u2019t perfected it yet. Meng Chuan stopped, scrutinized the saber in his hand, then frowned. How can I figure out the secret technique of the Falling Leaf Saber and reach the first major realm of saber arts\u2014the Unity realm?All skills, regardless of what they involved\u2014saber, sword, spears, etc\u2014had major realms.The first major realm was Unity. It referred to the fusion of one\u2019s body, heart, and skills into one that allowed one to unleash unimaginable might.The second major realm was known as \u201cForce,\u201d and the world was filled with such forces! The mountains had mountainous forces and water had aqueous forces. The usage of saber arts that required one to have similar worldly, terraneous, and elemental forces, gave rise to the Saber Force. For those who used swords, there was Sword Force. All of this implied a higher realm.Yet, Meng Chuan remained at the foundational stage after so many years. Of course, he had honed his foundation to the limit. His saber arts were only one step away from reaching the Unity realm.But the final step\u2026 was the most difficult!Even in all of Eastcalm Prefecture, there are very few people who can reach the Unity realm. Meng Chuan knew this very well. Only by reaching the Unity realm would one be considered a true expert. Otherwise, they will only be mediocre.The mediocre\u2014even if they had plenty of Quintessential Energy\u2014were nothing more than target dummies with greater strength and speed.They would be killed the moment they clashed with a true expert.According to the Falling Leaf Saber\u2019s description, it\u2019s divided into eighty-one stances. As long as one hones the 81 stances to a state of perfection, they will naturally be able to grasp the secret technique: Third Autumn Leaf. It will also be equivalent to reaching the first major realm of the saber art\u2014Unity. Meng Chuan was rather lost because the entire manual only described the Unity realm with a short paragraph.There was no other description. Even the moves were unrecorded.\u201cNaturally be able to grasp the secret technique\u201d was too ambiguous. His Falling Leaf Saber had achieved Greater Mastery for two years; But, despite cultivating diligently every day, why hadn\u2019t he been able to \u201cnaturally\u201d figure out the secret technique?Mortal cultivation is divided into five stages: Foundation Establishment, Internal Tempering, Marrow Cleansing, Mortal Shedding, and Seamless. To reach the Seamless realm from the Mortal Shedding realm\u2026 one has to hone their saber or sword skills to the Unity realm. Only when body, mind, and technique are truly united can one integrate all the powers in the Mortal Shedding realm, allowing for a breakthrough to the Seamless realm in one fell swoop. In a large family clan, sufficient pills are provided, so reaching the Mortal Shedding realm isn\u2019t difficult. But very few can reach the Seamless realm!He started establishing his foundation when he was six.He stepped into the Internal Tempering realm at the age of nine, and Marrow Cleansing at twelve. According to his estimates, he should be able to reach the perfected Marrow Cleansing realm around June. This sort of speed was considered average among the core disciples of a Godfiend family clan. A lazy person like Yun Qingping had also reached the Marrow Cleansing stage at the age of fifteen thanks to her plentiful consumption of valuable pills. Her progress was considered rather slow.Mortal cultivation had five main realms: Foundation Establishment, Internal Tempering, Marrow Cleansing, Mortal Shedding, and Seamless.Further up was the Godfiend realm.The gap between the Godfiend realm and the Seamless realm was like a chasm!Becoming a Godfiend was extremely difficult. In the past century, only a few people in Eastcalm Prefecture became Godfiends.I swore before my mother\u2019s grave that I must become a Godfiend in this life. I shall slay demons and avenge my mother. He stopped practicing and looked at the saber in his hand. He had been ignorant as a child, but he now knew the difficulty of becoming a Godfiend. However, he refused to give up no matter how difficult it was. I have to master the Saber Unity realm as quickly as possible. In the future, I will need to master the second realm, Force. Only then will I have some hope of becoming a Godfiend.Suddenly\u2014\u201cChuan\u2019er.\u201d A rotund figure walked into the training grounds.Meng Chuan turned around. \u201cDad.\u201dThe middle-aged man in front of him had a smile on his face. This was his father, Meng Dajiang. He ran a restaurant\u2014the biggest restaurant in Eastcalm Prefecture. He was also destined to be the next clan leader of the Meng family.Meng Dajiang was extremely powerful. He was one of the small handful of people who were considered the strongest under the Godfiend realm, and he also cultivated saber arts. Furthermore, he was a Seamless realm expert that attained Saber Force. But as a forty-seven-year-old, his chances of becoming a Godfiend grew increasingly slim!\u201cUncle Meng.\u201d Liu Qiyue also walked over.\u201cThe 3rd of March is Jadesun Palace\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet, right? Qiyue is a sharpshooter, so Blazing Sun Dao Academy will definitely reserve a spot for you.\u201d As Meng Dajiang spoke, Liu Qiyue nodded happily. Meng Dajiang looked at his son and asked, \u201cChuan\u2019er, what about you? There are only three spots for Mirror Lake Dao Academy\u2019s Marrow Cleansing disciples. Are you confident about obtaining one?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not confident.\u201d Meng Chuan knew himself. He said, \u201cThere isn\u2019t much difference between the top ten disciples of the Dao Academy at the Marrow Cleansing stage. I have some hope to vie for it, but the chances of failing aren\u2019t zero. If I can figure out the secret technique of Falling Leaf Saber, I\u2019ll definitely have the confidence. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t been able to figure it out. Dad, do you have any special tricks to cultivate the secret technique?\u201d\u201cHaha, your dean is the best swift saber expert in Eastcalm Prefecture. He will teach you what\u2019s necessary,\u201d said Meng Dajiang with a laugh. \u201cAs for the secret technique, I think it\u2019s just about having more practice. More practice might lead to you figuring it out.\u201dMeng Chuan felt helpless.There was no trick.\u201cDon\u2019t harp on it. Among your generation in Eastcalm Prefecture, nobody in the Marrow Cleansing realm has figured out the secret technique.\u201d Meng Dajiang laughed. \u201cIn the Meng family, I\u2019m the most outstanding member of my generation; yet, it took me until I was nineteen before I figured out the secret technique.\u201d\u201cHowever, according to legend, Patriarch Zhang grasped the secret technique at the age of thirteen, allowing his sword art to reach the Unity realm.\u201d Meng Chuan sighed.\u201cPatriarch Zhang is the only person in the last hundred years of Eastcalm Prefecture that managed to become a disciple of the Archean Mountain. It was also because of this that the Zhang family became the leader of the five major Godfiend clans in Eastcalm Prefecture,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cDon\u2019t be too anxious. Our Meng family\u2019s Patriarch Yushan from five hundred years ago only figured out the secret technique at eighteen. However, didn\u2019t he become a Godfiend at eighty years old? Even if he was a late bloomer, he still became a Godfiend.\u201dMeng Chuan obviously knew his family\u2019s history.When he was young, his mother would tell him stories about the development of Godfiends. He would also pester his parents for more!Other than drawing, he loved listening to stories the most as a child.His parents had bought many storybooks about the famous Godfiends in history and took the time to read them to him.\u201cMom, one day, I will become a Godfiend as well,\u201d murmured Meng Chuan.\u2026That afternoon, Meng Chuan arrived at Mirror Lake Dao Academy. This was because the dean was personally teaching saber arts to one of the classes. As the dean, he only needed to teach once every five days.A two-hour lesson of saber arts came to an end.There\u2019s still no way to make a breakthrough.I really don\u2019t know when my saber arts will reach the Unity realm. Meng Chuan walked through the Dao Academy. He spent almost every day thinking about the Falling Leaf Saber\u2019s secret technique to the point of almost going mad.When he passed by an empty area, he heard angry shouting.He looked over.Lecturer Ma had broken out into a tirade at a group of youths.\u201cAim for the skies; not doing so will only result in mediocrity. Do you understand?\u201d Lecturer Ma shouted angrily. \u201cI\u2019m telling you to learn from the good, not the bad. Doing so will only exacerbate matters! If you don\u2019t reach the Marrow Cleansing realm, you will be unsuccessful for the rest of your life. If you reach the Marrow Cleansing realm, you will have to serve the military at 20 years of age to fight demons. If you don\u2019t sweat now, you will bleed in the future and lose your life. Barely half survive military service! Are you hoping to die on the battlefield or return in glory?\u201d\u201cLook, that\u2019s the Meng family\u2019s Meng Chuan. He managed to reach the Greater Mastery stage of the Falling Leaf Saber at thirteen and entered our Mirror Lake Dao Academy\u2019s Mountain River Pavilion. The dean even teaches him personally! There are no shortcuts to mastering saber arts, only hard work. I heard that Meng Chuan spends several hours cultivating at home every day. What about you guys? Have you reflected on yourselves?\u201d\u201cAim for the skies; not doing so will only result in mediocrity. I want you to learn from Meng Chuan, understand?\u201dUnder the shouts of Lecturer Ma, the group of youths did not dare breathe.As he roared, Lecturer Ma smiled at the passing Meng Chuan. Meng Chuan nodded with a smile in return, but his eyes suddenly lit up before he hurried home.\u2026Upon returning to his manor, Meng Chuan immediately went to the study.\u201cAim for the skies; not doing so will only result in mediocrity. If I want to learn, I have to learn from the best!\u201d Meng Chuan mumbled to himself. His eyes brightened, and he became increasingly excited. If I want to learn from someone, I should learn from the strongest Godfiends! Learning from the strongest existence in history is what aiming for the skies is!The invincible experts who managed to leave their names in history had mostly passed away, but their biographies remained in circulation even after thousands of years!Their biographies contain their thoughts.Meng Chuan raised his head and looked at the books on a bookshelf. Dad and Mom read many Godfiend stories to me when I was young. They bought me many books.He casually picked up a book and flipped it open.The book described Godfiend Deng Feng who had dominated an entire era. According to the records, Deng Feng grew up in the mountains and had never received any education from a famous master. His only relative died just after teaching him the Saber Drawing Stance. He practiced eight hours a day drawing his saber. He drew his saber ten thousand times without learning any other techniques.Living alone in the depths of the mountains, this continued for twenty years.By the time he left the mountains, he came to the outside world without knowing much. With strength at the Marrow Cleansing realm, just drawing his saber was enough to kill a Seamless realm expert. His saber art had already reached an inconceivable level. Once news of this spread, the legendary Archean Mountain immediately took the initiative to recruit him and made him a disciple. This caused him to embark on the path of a Godfiend.\u2026The book was very long, and it recorded many stories after Deng Feng became a Godfiend. These had won the respect of future generations.In terms of cultivation matters, little was mentioned. The only mention was \u201ceight hours a day, drawing his saber ten thousand times for twenty years.\u201dThis was the most important line in this book for Meng Chuan.Even if an expert uses a saber art slowly, two hours is enough to draw a saber ten thousand times. Meng Chuan frowned. Yet, he spent eight hours every day, which means that every saber move channels his strength; he puts his heart and mind into it before he draws the saber! One after another\u2026 every saber move will accumulate power before erupting. Only by doing so ten thousand times will it take eight hours.Putting his heart and mind into it? Practicing the same move? Through sheer numbers?Meng Chuan held a brush in front of his desk and recorded it down before reading another Godfiend\u2019s biography.He needed to learn from the numerous Godfiend biographies to find the similarities to achieve the potency of a Godfiend.Aim for the skies; not doing so will only result in mediocrity.If he wanted to learn\u2026 he had to learn from the best!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe had to study from all the invincible Godfiends throughout history!\u201cUncle Qian,\u201d Meng Chuan suddenly called out.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d A voice sounded from outside.\u201cBring two people with you and buy all the Godfiend biographies on the market for me! There\u2019s also the educational material from some powerful Godfiend families. Buy one of each for me. Make haste!\u201d said Meng Chuan.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go now,\u201d replied Uncle Qian immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3: Novice and GrandmasterCKtalonCKtalonMeng Chuan carefully read the biographies. Many of these were written by large clans about a particular ancestor of theirs for publicity! Some of them were independently written by commoners because the Godfiend in question was truly famous. Some of the most famous Godfiends\u2019 biographies had dozens of versions. Some sects had voluntarily written down biographies for Godfiends. The most exaggerated ones were the autobiographies. The Godfiends who wrote those hoped that their descendants would remember their deeds.These biographies are mainly telling stories. Sometimes, only a few sentences in one book are useful to my cultivation. It\u2019s even possible that I can\u2019t find anything useful in a single biography. Also, some of these stories are highly credible and some are less trustworthy. They need to be classified accordingly.Meng Chuan came from a Godfiend family clan after all. With the guidance of Mirror Lake Dao Academy\u2019s system, his foundation was very solid. His top-notch saber art had reached the Greater Mastery stage, and he was only a step away from reaching Unity.With such a foundation, he was better equipped to distinguish the utility of each biography.In one of the biographies, Meng Chuan saw a maxim from the North Sword Emperor that was directed towards his descendants. Not putting your heart and mind into sword practice makes one merely a slave of the sword. Only by putting your heart and mind into training will you become the master of the sword.As he stared at these words, he pondered. The descendant that North Sword Emperor gave pointers to was a Seamless realm expert. The latter\u2019s sword technique should have reached Unity at the very least. He should have put his heart and mind into it during his usual training, but the North Sword Emperor still said that\u2026 Clearly, he didn\u2019t consider the Seamless realm expert to have put his heart and mind into his cultivation.\u2026Meng Chuan continued reading the Godfiends\u2019 biographies.Occasionally, the maxims left behind by a particular Godfiend or certain deeds led to Meng Chuan speculating.To normal people, it was only a story.But in the eyes of someone looking for inspiration, one could see the reasons behind the strength of Godfiends.One skill to eat your fill; one skill to kill. All you need is one skill without the frills. This was a quote from one of the biographies. It came from a conversation between a powerful Godfiend\u2014Fiend Saber Wei Feng\u2014and his disciple three thousand years ago. There were a total of fifteen versions of Fiend Saber Wei Feng\u2019s story sold in the Eastcalm Prefecture.Amongst them, there were similar sayings to \u201cone skill to eat your fill; one skill to kill. All you need is one skill without the frills.\u201d Meng Chuan also recorded this down.Apart from the biographies, he also valued the family teachings from the famous Godfiend family clans.Family teachings were left behind by Godfiends. Generally speaking, they were matters Godfiends believed were extremely important.The more he recorded, the more shocked he became.Aim for the skies; not doing so will only result in mediocrity. It\u2019s indeed right to learn from the most powerful Godfiends in history! However, the biographies are just the tip of an iceberg. Without a strong foundation, it\u2019s very easy for one to go astray. Meng Chuan realized this because he noticed that many family\u2019s teachings emphasized one\u2019s cultivation foundation.All members of the family were to enter the Dao Academies and receive a complete education in cultivation.This was because the Dao Academies were established by the oldest sect in the world\u2014Archean Mountain. They were in every large city in the Great Zhou Dynasty, and all Dao Academies\u2019 education system was established by Archean Mountain. Only by cultivating in the Dao Academies could one have a solid foundation.Of course, it only taught him the basics. His saber arts were only one step away from reaching the Unity realm. The Dao Academy had taught him all he needed in his seven years of cultivation. What he needed was to figure things out himself now.My foundation is sufficient. What I need now is the final step to make a breakthrough. Much of what I\u2019ve recorded today has inspired me. However, there\u2019s no rush. I\u2019ll read through these books briefly before consolidating them. I need at least three Godfiends to have shared similar cultivation principles before I consider them trustworthy.\u2026Day after day, Meng Chuan gathered and consolidated knowledge in ever-increasing amounts. He also included the \u201cImmutable Laws\u201d of Mirror Lake Dao Academy\u2014they were cultivation rules that Archean Mountain had set in stone.The combination of the two allowed Meng Chuan to understand even more.It\u2019s done.In the evening, Meng Chuan looked at his notebook and smiled. These five days have been more important than the past five years of my cultivation. Meng Chuan looked at the notebook in excitement. He now had a clearer understanding of cultivation.The first commandment of cultivation emphasized the extreme importance of one\u2019s foundation. It was akin to the foundation of a house. Entering the Dao Academy and undergoing a complete cultivation system was the best choice.The second commandment emphasized frequency. No matter how much one imagined inwardly, it couldn\u2019t be compared to cultivating ten thousand times! Sayings like drawing one\u2019s saber ten thousand times and repeating Sanguine Shadow Thrust daily were mentioned by twelve Godfiends.The third commandment was one skill to eat your fill! It was similar to the second commandment; he only needed one skill to kill enemies. If he cultivated one skill to the extreme, it would be more useful than cultivating ten other relatively powerful killer moves.The fourth commandment involved the difficulty of cultivation. Even if one endured hardships and grit their teeth to cultivate, they would only be novices! Only those who truly enjoyed and immersed themselves in cultivation and carefully studied the profundity of each move, could become a grandmaster.He also understood the true meaning behind the North Sword Emperor\u2019s words \u201cnot putting your heart and mind into sword practice makes one merely a slave of the sword. Only by putting your heart and mind into training will you become the master of the sword.\u201d The typical cultivator trained hard, but this wasn\u2019t them putting their heart into it. To truly enjoy the swordplay, be obsessed with it, to abandon everything external, and completely indulge in training like a crazed demon would one become a grandmaster. Otherwise, one would only be a novice.The fifth commandment: \u201cProgress in the day, change over the months, success will ultimately come\u2026\u201dThe sixth commandment\u2026\u2026There were a total of nine commandments.All of the commandments had at least three Godfiends mentioning them. Furthermore, with what Meng Chuan knew, he found them extremely reasonable.I\u2019ve been practicing my saber every day for several hours to exhaustion. But no matter how tired I was, I\u2019d just grit my teeth and endure it. In the past, I thought I was putting in the effort, but clearly, that doesn\u2019t mean putting my mind and heart into it. I need to be enjoying and immersing myself in the saber arts while I seriously ponder over every move. Meng Chuan felt that this was the biggest problem he had. To begin with, cultivation was very tiring.Normally, he would draw for two hours in the afternoon. This was his only guilty pleasure. It was a hobby he had since childhood. Through drawing, his accumulated fatigue from cultivation would be forgotten, and his heart would also be extremely calm. This allowed him to persevere one year after another.Now, it seemed like his take on things was wrong.In the past, I seemed to be diligent and hardworking, but in the end, I was just a novice. Unable to hold back any longer, Meng Chuan put down the notebook and walked out of the study to the courtyard.In the courtyard, he began to train his top-tier saber art, Falling Leaf Saber.Unlike before\u2014he only used the first stance of the Falling Leaf Saber, the Saber Drawing Stance. He threw everything else to the back of his mind as he completely focused on his saber art, as though the only thing in the world was the saber in his hand! Then he struck out with his saber! He could sense the silence of the saber as it was unsheathed. He could sense that the saber art was still the same old saber art, but his mentality had changed. What he 'saw\u201d changed as well.Since he was young, he had chosen the swift saber because he liked it sincerely from the bottom of his heart. It was solely because of the exhausting, repetitive training that ground his passion away. But when he changed his state of mind today, he once again focused on his saber arts using both body and mind.That love was awakening.The saber was silently unsheathed.The saber\u2019s trajectories were beautiful strokes in a painting. He tried his best to make the trajectory more graceful with each slash, causing the wind generated from each slash to become faster. Truly powerful saber techniques had a beauty to it, and Meng Chuan\u2019s saber technique was approaching such a level.He repeated the same move again and again, trying to strike faster and more silently when drawing his saber, working hard to slice through the wind at an ever-increasing speed.He repeated it fifty times before he was satisfied.This should be the way to cultivate! Meng Chuan was excited, and then he began to use the second stance\u2014Whirling Moon Stance.\u2026Two days after Meng Chuan compiled the cultivation notes, in an underground hall of the Yun family.Whoosh~In the center of the hall, purple flames rose.A black-haired elder was seated in the lotus position within the flames, completely unharmed.\u201cDad, you summoned me?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an respectfully walked to the main hall but didn\u2019t dare approach. Even from afar, he could feel heat\u2014which caused the air to distort\u2014rushing towards him.\u201cFu\u2019an.\u201d The black-haired elder opened his eyes, his gaze calm. \u201cI just received a piece of news. That old woman from the Meng family was heavily injured while defending against the demons at the Calm Sea Pass. She probably won\u2019t live for long. She should be returning to Eastcalm in the next few days.\u201dYun Fu\u2019an was astonished. \u201cDad, are you referring to Fairy Meng?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe black-haired elder nodded slightly.\u201cCould it be a mistake?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an was in disbelief. \u201cIsn\u2019t it said that Fairy Meng is the best at reconnaissance. Nothing within five kilometers can be hidden from her. She doesn\u2019t even need to rush to the forefront, so how was she suddenly seriously injured?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no mistake about it,\u201d the black-haired elder said coldly. \u201cKing Calm Sea hired several highly skilled doctors for her, but that old woman\u2019s injuries are too severe. Nothing can save her. This is no longer a secret at Calm Sea Pass! If she doesn\u2019t continue fighting and lives an ignoble life, she will live for another eight years at most. If she fights with all her might, her lifespan will be even shorter.\u201d\u201cAt most eight years?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cWithout Fairy Meng, isn\u2019t the Meng family finished?\u201d\u201cThe five Godfiend clans of the Eastcalm Prefecture will soon become four.\u201d The black-haired elder nodded.A family clan flourished because of a Godfiend.Likewise, without Godfiends, a family clan would become ordinary.\u201cThe Meng family will also lose the right to occupy so many important positions and interests in Eastcalm,\u201d the black-haired elder said coldly. \u201cRight, you should make a trip to the Meng family to get them to hand over the marriage agreement between Qingping and that fellow named Meng Chuan, and tear it apart on the spot! The current Meng family\u2026 doesn\u2019t deserve to enter a marriage alliance with us.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an replied respectfully.\u201cHowever, before that old woman dies, there\u2019s no need to lose decorum with them.\u201d After speaking, the black-haired elder closed his eyes.Yun Fu\u2019an quietly departed.\u2026\u201cWhat? Annulling the marriage agreement?\u201d Yun Qingping stared at her father in shock. Wasn\u2019t he opposed to it? Why is he suddenly changing his mind?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m just informing you.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an smiled. \u201cToday, I will pay the Meng family a trip to annul your engagement.\u201dYun Qingping couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWill the Meng family hand over the marriage contract obediently?\u201d\u201cThey will,\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an said confidently. His father had received the news from a good friend that the Meng family already knew about their ancestor\u2019s impending demise. These large family clans knew themselves well. Stubbornly resisting would only invite insult upon themselves.Yun Qingping immediately said, \u201cDad, I just want to annul the engagement. I don\u2019t want to fall out with them and ruin the harmony between our families. Why don\u2019t we invite Uncle Meng over for a discussion\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to go through so much trouble.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an smiled. \u201cAlright, leave this matter to me. Just stay at home and wait for the good news.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4: This Is a Good ThingCKtalonCKtalonA study within Mirror Lake Meng Manor.After practicing for an entire day, even though Meng Chuan remained energetic and excited, he still had to rest due to the exhaustion of his Quintessential Energy. He came to the study room to begin what he did every day\u2014drawing.There was a piece of paper lying on the tabletop, and beside it, a beautiful color palette. All the paint was of high quality.Meng Chuan put his heart into drawing. He had fallen in love with drawing since he was young.Perhaps it was because his mother was good at drawing and had taught him how to draw. This was what he loved the most when he was young. Imagine a three-year-old child drawing for nearly eight hours straight, to the point he forewent his meals without complaining about fatigue. He would still laugh happily despite his paint-covered body. His mother had said, \u201cMy son is extremely talented. He will definitely become the number one artist in the world. Every painting will be worth its weight in gold.\u201dHe was born in the Meng family; his parents doted on him, so he was carefree.However, when he was six, over a hundred thousand people had died in a great catastrophe. His mother was no exception.After his parents protected him with all their might and retreated to Eastcalm Prefecture, he focused on cultivating. However, he would still draw for two hours every day. Whenever he drew, he would forget about his fatigue from cultivation. He felt as though he had returned to a time when he was young. His mother would give him pointers, and his mind would be incomparably peaceful.Now, he was fifteen years old.After painting for over a decade, and being taught by several accomplished artists, he had long surpassed his teachers. His mother had been right. His talent was indeed outstanding\u2014at least higher than his talent towards saber arts.But what use was that? Could the best artist slay demons?Knock. Knock. Knock.There was an urgent knock on the door outside the study.Huh? Meng Chuan looked outside curiously. No one disturbs me when I\u2019m usually drawing. What\u2019s going on?He put down the brush, then opened the door. His father, Meng Dajiang, was standing outside. His normal jovial smile was gone; his current expression was rather solemn.\u201cChuan\u2019er, quickly follow me to the ancestral mansion,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.\u201cOkay.\u201d He immediately followed his father without hesitating. \u201cDad, why have you been frequently visiting the ancestral mansion recently?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Meng Dajiang didn\u2019t elaborate.\u201cThen why are we heading to the ancestral mansion now?\u201d Meng Chuan asked again. As a junior, he paid a small handful of visits to the ancestral mansion annually.Meng Dajiang glanced at his son and said, \u201cIt\u2019s about your engagement with Yun Qingping. We decided to annul the engagement after a discussion between our families.\u201d\u201cAnnul the engagement?\u201d Meng Chuan was shocked. \u201cDad, why is it suddenly being annulled?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t bear to have it annulled?\u201d Meng Dajiang looked at his son.\u201cNot at all.\u201d Meng Chuan immediately shook his head. \u201cI only meet Yun Qingping once every few months. Our personalities don\u2019t match, so annulling the engagement is a good thing for me.\u201dHe was only fifteen this year; he didn\u2019t know anything about love. He saw Yun Qingping as a familiar and willful younger sister. Nothing more.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you think that way. Our families have already agreed to annul the engagement,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cWhen we reach the ancestral mansion, you just have to listen. Don\u2019t speak too much.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\u2026The Meng family\u2019s ancestral mansion was situated in Eastcalm\u2019s western district. It occupied a very large area\u2014more than two thousand clansmen resided there. From the center of their occupied land, over half a kilometer could be traversed from south to north.The Meng family\u2019s foundation was in the countryside. Due to the threat of demons, people in the countryside combined forts to protect themselves. Each fort had thousands of people inside; it was very common for the same clan to gather in one fort. After a millennium of reproduction, the Meng family had three large forts and numbered over ten thousand people. There were few clans this large in Eastcalm Prefecture.The special thing about the Meng family was that they had a Godfiend. They immediately became one of the five major Godfiend family clans with the highest status in Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201cElder.\u201d\u201cElder.\u201dThe ancestral mansion was very orderly. Some of the patrolling clan members bowed and greeted Meng Dajiang respectfully when they saw the duo.Meng Dajiang was one of the three strongest members of the Meng family. He was still considered young and had a sliver of hope of becoming a Godfiend. He was to be the family\u2019s next clan leader.\u201cMmm?\u201dMeng Chuan followed his father into the guest hall.Several people were already seated on both sides of the hall. On one side were those from the Meng family and the other\u2014the Yun family. However, the atmosphere was clearly not quite right. At a glance, Meng Chuan could tell that the elders from his family didn\u2019t look too good.\u201cBrother Dajiang is here.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an stood up and smiled. \u201cHave you brought the marriage agreement?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Dajiang nodded slightly.Yun Fu\u2019an smiled and said, \u201cThe other Elders have no objections to the annulment of the engagement. I believe it\u2019s the same for you, am I right, Brother Dajiang?\u201dMeng Dajiang stood there and laughed. \u201cIf both families have the intention of building close ties through marriage, that will be nice. However, since there\u2019s no intent, it\u2019s better to annul the engagement early. This is the marriage agreement.\u201dHe took out a scroll and handed it to Yun Fu\u2019an with both hands.After Yun Fu\u2019an received the scroll, he unfurled it and took a closer look. He nodded slightly after seeing the names signed on it. It was indeed the marriage agreement from before. The two ancestors\u2019 handwriting couldn\u2019t be forged.\u201cYun Fu\u2019an, please tear the marriage agreement apart right here,\u201d said a bald, thin elder from the Meng family.\u201cHaha! Are you worried that I\u2019ll bring it back, and await a critical moment before using it to force Meng Chuan to marry my daughter?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t do anything that shameless!\u201dAs he said that, Yun Fu\u2019an tore the marriage agreement.\u201cI\u2019ve already torn the marriage agreement\u2014everyone can bear witness. All of you can be at ease now.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an smiled as his gaze swept across the Meng family Elders. \u201cI won\u2019t intrude any longer.\u201dHe walked out as he spoke. The other Yun family members followed behind him.When he passed where Meng Chuan was, Yun Fu\u2019an stopped and smiled. \u201cMy dear nephew, take heed. You are no longer related to my daughter, Qingping, anymore.\u201d\u201cYes, zero ties,\u201d replied Meng Chuan.Only then did Yun Fu\u2019an nod his head and lead everyone away.Meng Dajiang watched as Yun Fu\u2019an left and frowned slightly. He calmly said, \u201cChuan\u2019er, the engagement has been annulled. You can return. I still have matters that need attending to.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan glanced at the Elders and left obediently.Thud!The door to the hall closed. The hall remained bright through candle illumination.\u201cWhat bullies! They\u2019re too much!\u201d The bald, thin elder\u2019s walking stick slammed onto the ground\u2014producing a mildly deafening thud.\u201cIt appeared like we were negotiating, but in reality, we had no choice at all. Could we thicken our skin and go through with the marriage alliance?\u201d A swarthy elder sneered. \u201cIf we dared to cook up a storm at the Yun family, we will probably be slapped to death by the Yun family\u2019s patriarch!\u201d\u201cHaving the engagement annulled is also good. Would it be of any use to use the engagement to force the Yun family\u2019s hand when it\u2019s just the marriage between two juniors? The Yun family would just bear a grudge against us. A marriage alliance is to aid one another. It\u2019s better not to ally if we were enemies. This marriage is honestly trivial to our Meng family. Third Sis\u2019 injuries are what has shaken our Meng family\u2019s foundation!\u201d An elegant elder looked at the fat elder above them. \u201cClan Leader, can\u2019t we treat Third Sis\u2019 injuries?\u201dThe fat elder frowned. \u201cThird Sister will return to Eastcalm in two days. We\u2019ll talk about it when that happens.\u201dMeng Dajiang listened and frowned.The Meng family\u2019s pillar was on the verge of collapsing; the Meng family Elders were also worried.The Meng family kept the news secret, and only the Elders knew about it. If such news spread, over ten thousand clan members would be thrown into a state of panic. It would only add to their troubles.Now\u2026The upper echelons of the other four Godfiend family clans also knew, but they didn\u2019t spread it either. They were afraid that ignorant juniors would anger the Meng family. After all, Fairy Meng wasn\u2019t dead yet! Even if she was dead, she had many Godfiend friends. However, her Godfiend friends wouldn\u2019t interfere as long as one didn\u2019t go overboard.Without a Godfiend, the Meng family would not be able to bear many of the heavy responsibilities. They naturally wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy so much power if they couldn\u2019t bear their responsibilities.Responsibility and power were equal.From lowly mortals to esteemed Godfiends, presently, nobody could escape responsibility.As long as a mortal reached the Marrow Cleansing realm, they would have to serve in the military for five years at the age of twenty\u2014regardless of gender! Only half would return alive. However, people still wanted to reach the Marrow Cleansing realm because the rules of the Imperial Court forbade them from many occupations if they were so weak that they held little value to the military. They could only be bottom-feeders, living the most pitiful lives.As for Godfiends, they were the backbone of humanity. Every single Godfiend had spent their entire lives fighting and protecting. Even if they returned to their hometown to rest, they had to guard their hometown\u2019s city.As a result, Godfiends were illustrious and exalted. Their family clans bathed in their glory. When Godfiends passed away or were unable to take on such a heavy responsibility, their family clan would retire from the important positions they occupied.\u2026It was almost dark when Meng Chuan arrived home.\u201cAh Chuan, quickly have dinner. I heard that you and Uncle Meng went to the ancestral mansion. I thought you weren\u2019t coming back for dinner today.\u201d Liu Qiyue was sitting while eating porridge and pastries. Meng Chuan sat across from her, and a maidservant brought over a bowl of porridge. He drank some porridge as his mind wandered.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you talking? What happened?\u201d Liu Qiyue asked.\u201cOh.\u201dAfter snapping back to his senses, Meng Chuan casually said, \u201cOur families have decided to annul my engagement with Yun Qingping after discussions.\u201d\u201cAnnul the engagement?\u201d Liu Qiyue\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cYes, it just happened. The marriage agreement was torn apart on the spot.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.Liu Qiyue carefully observed him and asked, \u201cWhy? Are you very sad about annulling the engagement? Why are you drinking porridge in a daze?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Meng Chuan shook his head immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you aren\u2019t aware that Yun Qingping and I don\u2019t click. She\u2019s happy to annul the engagement and I\u2019m relieved too. This is a good thing for both of us. How can I be sad?\u201d\u201cThen why are you in a daze?\u201d Liu Qiyue asked.\u201cI just feel like something isn\u2019t right,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a frown. \u201cThe engagement was made personally by the two ancestors back then. Even if they came to annul the engagement, the Yun family would have at least sent their Three Heroes. This is the most basic form of respect for my Meng family. However, they sent only Yun Fu\u2019an, the fifth and most useless child. Isn\u2019t he looking down on my Meng family? This is my first doubt.\u201d\u201cSecondly, the Clan Leader and the Elders had ugly looks on their faces inside the hall. But from beginning to end, they held back. Since when did the Clan Leader have such a good temper?\u201d\u201cThirdly, Yun Fu\u2019an usually has a fawning, lowly attitude when in front of my father and the rest. But today, he was much more insolent. What instigated such behavior?\u201d\u201cMost importantly, there must be a reason behind the annulment. What caused the engagement, agreed between the two ancestors, to be annulled?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMeng Chuan looked at Liu Qiyue. \u201cI\u2019m guessing that either the Yun family has obtained a huge backer or it\u2019s because of my Meng family.\u201dLiu Qiyue was shocked. \u201cAh Chuan, I really can\u2019t figure out how you thought about all this at once.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just wild speculation. Since Dad didn\u2019t tell me, he naturally has his reasons.\u201d Meng Chuan smiled.\u201cTo think that the person whose engagement was just annulled can still smile. Hurry up and eat your pastry,\u201d Liu Qiyue urged with a smile.\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Meng Chuan immediately picked up the pastries and started eating.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The sky was gloomy.Screech! A bird\u2019s melodious cry rang out. A giant bird bathed in thunder swooped down from the clouds. On its back sat two figures.Boom!As the flying bird approached the ground, the entire wilderness trembled as lightning blasted out from its massive wings. Lightning bolts snaked into the distance before dissipating.Two figures descended from the bird\u2019s back.One was a middle-aged woman, the other an elderly woman holding a walking stick.\u201cJunior Sister Huang, you don\u2019t have to accompany me any further now that I\u2019m back in my hometown. Go back,\u201d said the old lady with a smile as she supported herself with the walking stick.\u201cSister Meng.\u201d The middle-aged woman\u2019s eyes welled with tears. Her \u201cSister Meng\u201d wasn\u2019t this old in the past. Her severe injuries showed her age. However, one could still tell that she had been a beauty when she was younger.\u201cI\u2019m afraid it will be difficult for us to meet again after this farewell,\u201d said the old woman with a happy sigh. \u201cHowever, I think I have it okay. At least I can return to my hometown before I die and spend the last few years here. Those who died in battle are nothing but piles of dust.\u201d\u201cSister Meng, just send a letter if you need my help. I, Huang Xiangning, will do my best,\u201d said the middle-aged woman solemnly.\u201cI\u2019ll do so if it\u2019s needed.\u201d The old woman smiled. \u201cAlright, hurry back.\u201dThe middle-aged woman carefully glanced at the old woman before finally jumping onto the avian creature\u2019s back. Soon, the bird flapped its wings and lightning filled the void.Whoosh.With lightning and thunder following, the avian creature soared into the sky and disappeared into the horizon.The old lady watched her companion leave before turning to look at Eastcalm City. She smiled. It\u2019s time to go home. The heavens have treated me well, having allowed me to return to my roots!Dong!Ripples surrounded the old lady when she tapped the ground lightly with her walking stick. Numerous ripples spread out in all directions\u2014enveloping a 1000 feet radius.She held her walking stick as she walked towards Eastcalm City\u2014completely covered by the ripples. Every step she took covered hundreds of feet. Nobody seemed to notice her, even when she walked past some travelling merchants along the way. They continued to laugh and chat.She arrived at the city gates moments later.Eastcalm City.The old woman held her walking stick and stared at the majestic city before her.This was her hometown\u2014the place she lived when she was young!The old woman smiled as she continued to advance. Despite the huge number of people at the gates, nobody saw the old woman\u2014including the guards. It was as if she didn\u2019t exist. She walked through the streets and arrived at the Meng family\u2019s ancestral mansion.She entered the ancestral mansion.Many clansmen were patrolling the ancestral mansion, but likewise, none of them could see the old woman.Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Inside one of the courtyards of the ancestral mansion, a fat elder was drinking in low spirits.\u201cPingping, is that some secret drinking I spy?\u201d A voice rang out in the courtyard.The fat elder shuddered in fear. He looked around and couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cThird Sis, is that you? Third Sis?\u201dA smiling old woman with a walking stick appeared out of thin air in the courtyard.\u201cThird Sis.\u201dThe fat elder\u2019s eyes turned red. He was Fairy Meng\u2019s only younger brother. The other family Elders addressed her as \u201cThird Sis\u201d out of practicality. The family clan was too large with its millennium-long history. Many members of the family were separated by a few generations. The fat elder\u2019s name was Meng Yanping, the current clan leader of the Meng family. He was about twenty years younger than Fairy Meng. Therefore, he was brought up by Fairy Meng when he was young. He treated her as both his sister and mother.In his heart, his sister had always been young, beautiful, and omnipotent. Now, she had aged so much.\u201cWhy are you crying? Am I not living well?\u201d said the old woman with a smile.\u201cThird Sis, are you really unable to treat your injuries?\u201d asked the fat elder.\u201cAs long as I don\u2019t fight with full strength, I should stay alive for another eight years,\u201d the old woman said calmly. \u201cHumans are affected by sickness and death, and Godfiends similarly have a limited lifespan. What\u2019s there to be sad about? The next few years give me plenty of time to put the Meng family back on track. Did anything happen when news about my severe injuries reached Eastcalm Prefecture?\u201d\u201cOur family annulled the engagement with the Yun family. It\u2019s the engagement of that little fellow, Meng Chuan,\u201d said the fat elder. \u201cAs for the rest, the four Godfiend family clans only engaged in some cheap tricks. They didn\u2019t dare to truly provoke our Meng family.\u201d\u201cYes. Back then, Yun Wanhai wanted to use our families\u2019 engagement as a way to better his family. Now that I\u2019m seriously injured, it\u2019s not surprising that he canceled his engagement.\u201dThe old lady instructed, \u201cRight, Pingping\u2026\u201d\u201cThird Sis, I\u2019m already ninety years old. I\u2019m the Meng family\u2019s clan leader. Can you call me by my actual name?\u201d The fat elder couldn\u2019t help but lament.\u201cOh, alright, alright. I won\u2019t embarrass you,\u201d said the old woman with a smile. \u201cMeng Pingping, gather all the Clan Elders to the Blazing Fire Hall. I want to meet them.\u201d\u201cWhat Meng Pingping? My name is Meng Yanping,\u201d the fat elder mumbled as he quickly went to gather the Elders.His sister was like his mother who had brought him up. She protected him and allowed him to come this far.Hearing his elder sister call him \u201cPingping\u201d made Clan Leader Yanping walk with a bounce in his step.\u2026The Meng family\u2019s ancestral mansion, the Blazing Fire Hall.Only the most important matters regarding the family clan would reach here. The area around the Blazing Fire Hall was heavily-guarded today.In the main hall.Fairy Meng stood there with her walking stick. She looked at the plaque in the hall: \u201cBlazing Fire.\u201dThe clan leader and the elders all stood respectfully, not daring to make a sound.In terms of age\u2026Fairy Meng was 112 years old this year. She was the oldest in the family. In terms of strength, Fairy Meng had become a Godfiend at 35. She had protected the Meng family for nearly eighty years and the Meng family had flourished for eighty years. There was no doubt about the prestige she held in the Meng family. With a single order, many clansmen would not hesitate dying.After staring at the words \u201cBlazing Fire\u201d on the plaque for a long time, Fairy Meng turned around. Her gaze swept across all the Elders present. All the Elders bowed nervously.\u201cAre there any talents in our Meng family\u2019s younger generation, ones who have a chance of becoming a Godfiend?\u201d inquired Fairy Meng. Although the Meng family had been rooted in Eastcalm Prefecture for more than a thousand years, it had only produced two Godfiends. One was Patriarch Yushan from five hundred years ago, while the other was Fairy Meng. Their eras allowed the Meng family to reach its peak. What Fairy Meng wanted the most was\u2026To be able to nurture a third Godfiend in the history of the family clan.Initially, she could have patiently searched for a suitable junior worth nurturing. However, time was of the essence, and she could only choose from whoever was available.\u201cDajiang is quite talented. He figured out the saber\u2019s secret technique at 19 and gained insights into Saber Force at the age of 30. Now, he\u2019s only 47-years-old. There\u2019s a sliver of hope for him to become a Godfiend,\u201d said a bald elder.\u201cDajiang?\u201dFairy Meng looked at the Meng Dajiang.\u201cAunt.\u201d The plump Meng Dajiang immediately bowed.\u201cHave you condensed your core?\u201d asked Fairy Meng.Meng Dajiang shook his head.Fairy Meng frowned. To not condense a core at age 47 made his chances of becoming a Godfiend very slim.\u201cWhat about the young ones?\u201d pressed Fairy Meng.\u201cAmong the young ones, three of them are not bad,\u201d said Clan Leader Meng Yanping immediately. \u201cMeng Zhu is 23 this year and at the Seamless realm. He is in the midst of military service at Qinyang Pass. He figured out the secret technique at 19. And there\u2019s Meng Wenying. She\u2019s 16 and she achieved Greater Mastery of a top-notch sword art at 12. There\u2019s also Dajiang\u2019s son, Meng Chuan. He is 15 this year, achieving Greater Mastery of a top-notch saber art at 13. Meng Wenying and Meng Chuan are both young, but they haven\u2019t figured out the secret technique yet.\u201dFairy Meng fell silent.Meng Zhu had only figured out the secret technique when he was 19. This was very late for those becoming Godfiends! This was because it was unknown when he would gain insight into \u201cForce.\u201d By the time that happened, the chances of him becoming a Godfiend became even more distant.Meng Wenying and Meng Chuan; one was 16, while the other was 15. Time was tight, and they had yet to grasp the key secret technique.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven if she wanted to choose from second best, they couldn\u2019t be considered as good.\u201cAll of you can go back,\u201d said Fairy Meng coldly. \u201cFor the next few years, the juniors of the entire family clan will receive better nurturing. This is an important matter for the family clan. Nothing else supersedes this in importance. Before I die, I want to see a seedling who has a chance of becoming a Godfiend.\u201dClearly, she didn\u2019t see any outstanding seedlings. All she could do was spread the net, hoping for the nine to twelve-year-olds to become geniuses.\u201cYes,\u201d the clan leader and the elders replied in unison.\u201cThis matter involves the rise and fall of the family, so there\u2019s no room for delay. If anyone were to siphon off the benefits while this happens, they will be punished as per the family\u2019s rules.\u201d After Fairy Meng said that, she walked out with her walking stick.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A woman held her seven-year-old daughter\u2019s hand and received her daughter\u2019s monthly cultivation resources. She was also shocked. \u201cPreviously, my daughter only received three taels of silver a month and a Lifeblood Pill. Now, she\u2019s getting 30 taels of silver and 10 Lifeblood Pills? She can consume a Lifeblood Pill once every three days?\u201dHer daughter was only seven. She didn\u2019t focus on cultivation and was given only the most basic resources the family clan gave the younger generation. Yet, her quota had increased tremendously.\u201cEveryone, the clan leader has personally announced that from this month onwards, all clan members below the age of 20 will receive ten times the amount of pills and silver every month.\u201d The clan members who were responsible for distributing the resources also began to explain. This soon spread, turning the clansmen in the Meng family ancestral mansion ebullient.The family clan juniors were divided into five levels according to their cultivation progress.For example, Meng Wenying and Meng Chuan were at the top of the list. They were specially nurtured.There were also the second and third levels\u2026And now, the most ordinary juniors received 30 taels of silver and 10 Lifeblood Pills a month.\u201cClan Leader, the clan has at least 2,000 people who are between the ages of 6 and 20. Can the family support such levels of distribution?\u201d asked one of the old servants worriedly. Clan Leader Meng Yanping stood in the distance and watched clansmen collecting their quotas. He said calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The clan\u2019s savings are enough to handle another ten years of such distribution.\u201dThe old servant was a little worried.The income of a Godfiend clan was astonishing, but its expenses were similarly huge. Now, the clan was desperately trying to groom a new generation of cultivators. They were nurturing them with everything for the next ten years! They were throwing resources at the younger generation in hopes of producing a sapling who had a chance of becoming a Godfiend.\u2026At the Mirror Lake Meng Manor.Meng Dajiang led a dozen people back to the manor.\u201cMaster.\u201d The servants were very respectful.\u201cWhere\u2019s Chuan\u2019er?\u201d Meng Dajiang asked.\u201cYoung Master is at the training grounds,\u201d the servants replied respectfully.Meng Dajiang frowned and looked up at the sky. The sun was setting in the west and it was almost five in the evening. \u201cWhy is he still practicing at this time?\u201dHe led an entourage to the training grounds. He vaguely heard the sound of a saber whistling through the air. He waved his hand and ordered in a low voice, \u201cWait here.\u201d With that said, he quietly walked closer. He looked through the windows surrounding the training ground. He saw a young man\u2019s blurry figure hidden within the saber flashes, practicing the Falling Leaf Saber.\u201cQian Fang.\u201d Meng Dajiang beckoned for a middle-aged man not far away. Qian Fang\u2014who was an old servant who served Meng Chuan\u2014quickly walked over.\u201cTell me,\u201d Meng Dajiang said with a suppressed voice, \u201chow long has Chuan\u2019er been practicing his saber art today?\u201d\u201cMaster, Young Master started practicing his saber art early in the morning. Besides eating and resting, he hasn\u2019t stopped!\u201d Qian Fang said immediately.\u201cHe practiced for so long?\u201d Meng Dajiang frowned.\u201cEven after soaking in a herbal bath at night, the Young Master will continue practicing his saber art in his courtyard for two further hours.\u201d Qian Fang couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cFor the past few days, other than eating, sleeping, painting, taking a medicinal bath, and undergoing Marrow Cleansing cultivation\u2026 he practices his saber art for roughly twelve to fourteen hours every day.\u201d\u201cFor the past few days?\u201d Meng Dajiang murmured. In the past few days? What could have agitated his son so much into such crazy training? The engagement annulment?\u201cYes, for the past few days!\u201d Qian Fang said. \u201cJust before that, Young Master was still in a good mood. He even got me to buy some Godfiend biographies and didn\u2019t cultivate so crazily. But I\u2019ve no idea what happened over the past few days. My attempts in persuasion fell on deaf ears.\u201d\u2026A while later, at the training ground.Meng Chuan was immersed with the Falling Leaf Saber technique.\u201cChuan\u2019er.\u201d Meng Dajiang\u2019s voice rang out.\u201cDad.\u201d Meng Chuan stopped and saw Meng Dajiang leading more than ten people over.Meng Dajiang smiled and said, \u201cChuan\u2019er, the clan has decided to spend more effort in nurturing you. From today onwards, these eight Marrow Cleansing and three Mortal Shedding warriors will be your sparring partners.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t I have bodyguards to spar with?\u201d Meng Chuan was surprised.He already had eight Marrow Cleansing guards and two Mortal Shedding guards. They would occasionally accompany him during his saber training.\u201cThey are guards. These are warriors who specialize in sparring. For example, among these eight Marrow Cleansing warriors, there\u2019s one who\u2019s skilled in archery, and another who\u2019s skilled in projectiles. It will be of great help to your cultivation,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cBesides, as your guards, we can\u2019t let them spar with you often, right?\u201dMeng Chuan nodded.The guards were paid employees with well-defined job scopes. It was fine if they occasionally sparred with Meng Chuan, but doing so too often would result in exploitation complaints.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to explain how much help these three Mortal Shedding realm experts can provide you. This\u201d\u2014Meng Dajiang pointed at a thin, mustached man\u2014\u201dis Brother Wang Chang, a senior at the Seamless realm.\u201d\u201cSenior Wang.\u201d Meng Chuan immediately bowed respectfully. A Seamless realm expert enjoyed high status in Eastcalm City. Wang Chang was second in command at an escort company in the city.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be this polite, Young Master Meng.\u201d Wang Chang smiled.\u201cFrom now onwards, six Seamless realm experts will spar with you every month. Each of them will accompany you during cultivation for five days, two hours a day,\u201d said Meng Dajiang solemnly. \u201cThe family paid a great price to hire six Seamless realm experts to spar with you. You need to make good use of this opportunity.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan was also shocked.Seamless realm experts were all important figures in the Eastcalm Prefecture. Time was precious; they couldn\u2019t spend a month training beside him daily. They had plenty of things to do after all. They were already generous if they were willing to spend two hours a day for five consecutive days sparring him. Yet, the family hired six Seamless realm experts\u2026 Meng Chuan was guaranteed a Seamless expert to spar with every day.\u201cChuan\u2019er, one must have great ambitions. There\u2019s no need to worry about not having a wife. You have to cultivate hard. Don\u2019t underachieve the family\u2019s expectations.\u201d After speaking, Meng Dajiang walked out.There\u2019s no need to worry about not having a wife? What did father mean by that?\u201cDad, what do you mean by not needing to worry about not having a wife?\u201d Meng Chuan asked immediately.\u201cI don\u2019t want your imagination running wild,\u201d Meng Dajiang said and left the training ground.\u201cWhat imagination?\u201d mumbled Meng Chuan before looking at the nearby sparring experts. His eyes lit up.Saber techniques were meant for killing.With a sparring partner, the training results would be much better. Even though he had sparring partners in the past, how could it compare to what he had now? He had sparring partners ranging from the Marrow Cleansing realm to the Seamless realm!\u2026From this day onwards, Meng Chuan began practicing his saber art before dawn and enjoyed the benefit of having sparring partners in the morning.When it was in the afternoon or night-time, he cultivated alone. He also needed to focus and reflect on the actual combat training he had in the mornings.\u2026As Meng Chuan\u2019s state of mind changed, he could sense the unique individual charm in each of the Falling Leaf Saber\u2019s 81 stances since he fully immersed himself into the technique. He soon discovered the method to the secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf.He gradually realized that the beauty of the 81 stances could be combined after practicing them one after another.For example, the first stance was the Saber Drawing Stance. It was incomparably sharp and mighty. The second stance\u2014Whirling Moon Stance\u2014was bizarre and ethereal. When he switched to the third stance\u2014Cloud Opening Stance\u2014it transformed from ethereality and bizarreness to a sudden killer move. He would then switch to the fourth stance.One move after another.It was like a boulder rolling down a mountain; its speed would increase faster and faster.The moves surged with unstoppable momentum as they followed one after another like torrential waves.If the 81 stances can really be combined into one, allowing its might to reach the peak, I would be able to \u201cnaturally\u201d produce the secret technique as described in the manual! It was because he understood this point that Meng Chuan was so obsessed with practicing his saber art.If the \u201cbeauty\u201d of the 81 stances combined into one, the blade would slice through the wind\u2019s trajectory, and its trajectory would perfectly connect.The speed and transformation of the saber art formed a rhythm. It was like a song of nature.A painting formed when the beauty of each move was combined..Because he vaguely came into contact with this realm, Meng Chuan\u2019s yearning for success grew.Day after day\u2026The beauty of Meng Chuan\u2019s saber art became increasingly perfect as he removed the flaws.The rhythm of the saber art became more melodious as the staccato rhythm declined. The trajectory of the saber strokes were refined even further.Meng Chuan could acutely feel his improvement. He felt that he was getting closer to that realm.The vegetation by the side of the training grounds gradually turned green, a sign that March was fast approaching. As usual, Meng Chuan was cultivating. He gradually approached that realm, getting closer and closer.Whoosh.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs Meng Chuan cultivated, his long pursuit for aesthetics was finally over. Flesh, bones, tendons, and heart\u2014his technique had merged with his body. His saber art reached the state of being one with body and mind. He could sense the blade in his hand slicing through the resisting wind clearly! His body, mind, and saber united as the blade tore through the air with terrifying speed.When Meng Chuan used his saber art, a clone would appear more than a hundred feet away. The two existed simultaneously.A faint saber arc could be seen midair.Only then did the first Meng Chuan dissipate.I-I\u2019ve comprehended it? Meng Chuan stood in his spot, stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In an instant, his body, mind, and technique were one. As he tore through the air with the saber flying around him, he saw afterimages left behind in the training grounds as stunning saber flashes appeared one after another.It was fast and ethereal! This was the characteristic of the secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf. His movement technique was fast and ethereal! His saber arts were also fast and ethereal!After trying it out over ten times in a row, he finally came to a halt, unable to suppress his excitement. Third Autumn Leaf, the fall of a leaf portends the third season of the year\u2014autumn! I finally figured it out! I finally figured it out! I\u2019ve finally reached the first major realm in saber arts\u2014Unity! I, Meng Chuan, have a chance of becoming a Godfiend!He was really excited. He began learning the Falling Leaf Saber at the age of eleven. Four years had passed since then.He had never slacked off in the past four years, cultivating as hard as he could because he knew very well that there were many excellent cultivators during the foundational stages of saber arts. There were several such talents in every Dao Academy. There were even more when the eight Dao Academies were combined. However, among these outstanding cultivators\u2026 99% of them would be held back by the Unity realm. They would gradually become mediocre. It would be a miracle if they could reach the Seamless realm in their lifetime.However, this was never his goal. He wanted to become a Godfiend! He had worked hard and studied hard, all for one goal\u2014Godfiend!He couldn\u2019t forget being tied to his father\u2019s back when he was six years old as his father fled while resisting the demons. At the critical moment, his mother had taken the initiative to charge at the demons to buy time for them.It was all for the sake of her son!On his father\u2019s back, he saw his mother being overwhelmed by demons. At the time, Meng Chuan cried his heart out. Tears kept streaming down his father\u2019s cheeks but he didn\u2019t turn around; he focused on escaping with all his might. In the end, Meng Chuan survived.The earlier one starts cultivation, the better. A mortal\u2019s body reaches its prime at the age of twenty. Progress just slows down after that. Meng Chuan mused to himself, Right now, the number one genius in Eastcalm Prefecture\u2014Mei Yuanzhi\u2014figured out the secret technique at fifteen years of age. Just a month ago, he gained insights into Ice Force at twenty. He is even able to live within the Jadesun Palace and cultivate there.Mei Yuanzhi came from an ordinary family in Eastcalm Prefecture. His mother was a maid, and his father was only at the Mortal Shedding realm.However, Mei Yuanzhi had figured out the secret technique at the age of fifteen, shocking the Dao Academy. The Dao Academy immediately nurtured him to the best of their abilities. Even Godfiend family clans also wanted to betroth girls from their direct lineage to him, but Mei Yuanzhi was focused on cultivation. He was not tempted by the Godfiend family clans at all\u2026Finally, on 12th January, Mei Yuanzhi figured out \u201cIce Force.\u201d He barely made it in time by figuring out \u201cForce\u201d at the age of twenty. This year, he had a chance to try his luck at entering the most ancient cultivation ground\u2014Archean Mountain.According to the rules of Archean Mountain, one couldn\u2019t exceed the age of twenty when participating in the entrance test.I have reached the Unity realm. This is just the first step. There are still many thresholds like \u201cSaber Force\u201d and \u201cCore Condensation.\u201d Meng Chuan mumbled quietly, \u201cI can\u2019t slack off.\u201d He scanned his surroundings and noticed that he was the only person in the training ground. The vegetation was a luxuriant green.What a coincidence. Meng Chuan snapped out of his daze. Today is the 27th February. I actually made a breakthrough a day before the Dao Academy\u2019s internal selection.Sometimes, things in the world were just this coincidental.\u2026The next morning.Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue were having breakfast.The entire Meng family were currently trying their best to groom the younger generation. They had hired Seamless experts to be Meng Chuan\u2019s sparring partners. Meng Dajiang\u2014who had comprehended Saber Force and was a Seamless realm expert\u2014naturally had to be put to use. He had recently been living in the ancestral mansion and teaching a large number of juniors in the clan. As for Meng Chuan, he had plenty of opportunities to receive his father\u2019s guidance. He was already very familiar with his father\u2019s teachings.However, Qiyue\u2019s father\u2014Liu Yebai\u2014was very mysterious. He spent most of the year outside.\u201cAh Chuan, your Dao Academy will be making the selections today, right?\u201d Liu Qiyue smugly said, \u201cI\u2019ve already gotten a spot.\u201d\u201cI will get it today too,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile.\u201cYou\u2019re that confident?\u201d Liu Qiyue asked with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re confident that you can obtain the top three in the Dao Academy even before you reach the perfected Marrow Cleansing realm?\u201d\u201cWhat if I get the spot?\u201dLiu Qiyue sized up Meng Chuan and chuckled. \u201cIf you get it, I\u2019ll make you dinner for a month. But if you can\u2019t get that spot\u2014hehe\u2014you have to give me your Gallant Steeds! Do you dare to take on my bet?\u201dMeng Chuan laughed.His artistic skills had long surpassed the best artist in Eastcalm Prefecture. Of course, there being few artists was partially a reason.Gallant Steeds was Meng Chuan\u2019s magnum opus. It was a piece of art on a long scroll. It consisted of a hundred horses with different expressions. It took him over a year to draw it. Liu Qiyue had been eyeing it ever since she lay her eyes on it. Even Yun Qingping had offered three thousand silver taels and two pieces of precious jade for it after seeing it once.\u201cIf I lose, I\u2019ll have to let go of Gallant Steeds. If I win, you\u2019ll only be making me dinner for a month. Isn\u2019t that a little unfair?\u201d Meng Chuan asked with hesitation.\u201cIt\u2019s for one month! Do you dare?\u201d Liu Qiyue stared at him.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for you to make me a meal usually. Alright, I\u2019ll take this bet.\u201d Meng Chuan clenched his teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t regret it when you lose.\u201d\u201cI should be the one saying that!\u201d Liu Qiyue put down her utensils and stood up to leave. \u201cI\u2019m going to the Dao Academy. Don\u2019t cower outside just because you lose at noon.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Meng Chuan leisurely drank his porridge. Why would he reject his dear Qiyue\u2019s offer to make him dinner for a full month?After he was done with his meal, he wiped the corner of his mouth and leisurely strode towards his Dao Academy.\u2026Mirror Lake Dao Academy.After arriving at the Dao Academy, he realized that many disciples had come to the arena.\u201cSenior Brother Meng will definitely win.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Meng, you will definitely enter the top three.\u201dMany of the junior brothers and sisters were extremely excited. All of them knew that today was the final selection. The Dao Academy also wanted them to watch the competition of their seniors from Mountain River Pavilion. As Meng Chuan was occasionally willing to give his juniors pointers, many of them supported him.\u201cAlthough I do wish for Senior Brother Meng Chuan to win, he honestly doesn\u2019t have the advantage. It\u2019s a battle between the top ten disciples at the Marrow Cleansing realm, so the chances of him clinching top three is really low.\u201d\u201cThe first among equals was chosen between Senior Brother Wan Mang and Senior Brother Bai Guan in the most recent competition between the top ten disciples. Therefore it\u2019s unquestionable the two will take up a spot.\u201d Many of the juniors engaged in heated discussions. Some of them blindly supported their favorites, while others provided clear analyses. However, all of them had a point in common: they were all waiting for the battle to begin.The arena had a hundred-foot buffer, preventing the disciples from approaching.Meng Chuan and company arrived one after another as they waited. Lecturers checked their weapons, confirming that they were all blunt.A skinny man who reeked of alcohol walked over while carrying a wine jar.\u201cDean.\u201d\u201cDean.\u201dAll the disciples were very respectful. Even the twenty-two disciples of Mountain River Pavilion bowed respectfully. This was the dean of Mirror Lake Dao Academy, Ge Yu. He had quite the terrible reputation\u2014known for his greed and penchant for alcohol. He did things recklessly.\u201cAlright, everyone is here.\u201d Although Ge Yu\u2019s face was completely red and he reeked of alcohol, all of the disciples were very obedient. The lecturers and teaching assistants didn\u2019t dare mumble a word. He had earned his title of being the best at the swift saber.\u201cThere are only six of you who are in the Mortal Shedding realm. The selection will be easy,\u201d Ge Yu said. \u201cThe six of you can compete first and we\u2019ll pick the top three.\u201d\u201cDean.\u201dA young man bowed and said, \u201cBrother Zhang and I have just reached the Mortal Shedding realm recently and are still at the early stages of the Mortal Shedding realm. We admit that we are lacking in strength and choose to give up on the competition.\u201d\u201cDean, we have already battled last night. I lost all three battles,\u201d a muscular, dark-skinned youth said.\u201cOh?\u201dGe Yu nodded when he heard that. He knew the strength of his disciples as well. \u201cAlright, since that\u2019s the case, the ones heading to the Jadesun Palace\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet will be Wu Qi and the Wei brothers.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Wu Qi and the other two replied respectfully.Wu Qi was at the perfected Mortal Shedding realm.The Wei brothers were at the late-stage Mortal Shedding realm, so they held a strength advantage.\u201cThere are a total of 16 Mountain River Pavilion disciples at the Marrow Cleansing realm.\u201d Ge Yu looked at Meng Chuan and company. \u201cEvery one of you can vie for it. I\u2019ll state the rules. Those who have confidence can enter the arena directly! You will face challenges from your fellow disciples. As long as you win five matches in a row, you will secure a spot. Also\u2026 two defeats will automatically disqualify you.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s begin now.\u201d As Ge Yu spoke, he hugged the wine jar and took a big gulp.The sixteen Marrow Cleansing realm disciples fell silent.To enter the arena and win five consecutive matches? Then, the first to enter the arena would be at a disadvantage!Vying for the third spot after two spots was taken would be much easier since the two strongest opponents were gone.\u201cWho\u2019s going first?\u201d Most of the Mountain River Pavilion disciples cast their gazes on two disciples\u2014the muscular and smiling Wan Mang and the extremely cold and stern Bai Guan. In competitions involving the ten strongest disciples, first place was typically decided between the two of them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2019re not going up?\u201d Wan Mang smiled at Bai Guan.\u201cIf you wish to, after you,\u201d Bai Guan said coldly.At this moment\u2026A figure took a step forward and entered the arena. It was none other than Meng Chuan.He swept his gaze across the shocked fellow disciples and said, \u201cI guess the first spot will be mine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8: Third Autumn LeafCKtalonCKtalonMeng Chuan\u2019s actions truly shocked the other disciples of Mountain River Pavilion. He wasn\u2019t particularly outstanding at the pavilion, and he was a relatively young disciple. Although his father was the next clan leader of the Meng family, he didn\u2019t have the arrogance one would expect. His fellow disciples had good impressions of him, but this time, he had taken the initiative to enter the arena. He even said: \u201cI guess the first spot will be mine.\u201dIt was truly an act that disregarded his seniors.\u201cSenior Brother Meng went up?\u201d\u201cWhy did he go first?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be too late to go up after the first two spots are taken.\u201d The juniors watching from afar were even more shocked.Even the drinking dean, Ge Yu, was rather surprised. His greed and penchant for alcohol had him frequently taking advantage of Meng Dajiang, the owner of Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s best restaurant. He was also quite fond of Meng Dajiang\u2019s son, not only because Meng Chuan didn\u2019t stir up trouble using his family background, but also because of the benefits he received from Meng Dajiang.\u201cHurry up, whoever wants to challenge Meng Chuan can go up,\u201d urged Ge Yu.\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dThe cold-faced Bai Guan took a step forward and flew up the arena. His gaze towards Meng Chuan was cold as he sneered. \u201cMeng Chuan, you\u2019ll have to get by me first if you wish to take the first spot.\u201dHe had come in first several times during competitions between the top ten disciples at the Marrow Cleansing realm and had only been defeated by Wan Mang once.Among the Mountain River Pavilion disciples in the Marrow Cleansing realm, only Wan Mang\u2014 who was born with tremendous strength\u2014left him keeping up his guard. He thought nothing of his other fellow disciples. He could have watched by the sidelines if Meng Chuan had been the first to enter the arena, but the words \u201cI guess the first spot will be mine\u201d propelled him to teach Meng Chuan a lesson.\u201cPlease.\u201d\u201cStraightforward, not bad.\u201dBai Guan unsheathed two longswords from his back. They were blunt because only unsharpened weapons were used in duels between fellow disciples.Bai Guan held a longsword in each hand. He stared at Meng Chuan and said, \u201cYou fought me seven times, but not once have you withstood ten strikes.\u201d\u201cThe art of dual-wielding swords is indeed powerful,\u201d praised Meng Chuan with a nod.The reason why Bai Guan was so strong that even Wan Mang\u2014who was born with tremendous strength\u2014had been lucky enough to defeat him only once, was because of his dual-wielding! A true dual-sword expert needed to multi-task efficiently. Each sword was seemingly used by two individual experts who worked in concert. In a battle against such a swordsman, an opponent would feel like they were facing a brutal assault from two swordsmen. All the other Marrow Cleansing disciples from the Mountain River Pavilion had been defeated by him.\u201cI admire your courage for being the first to enter the arena. Thus, I will use my killer move \u2018Heart Sunder\u2019 to make you truly admit defeat.\u201d The proud and confident Bai Guan directly announced the move he was going to use. To teach Meng Chuan a lesson, he planned on using his best technique to crush him.\u201cDo as you wish.\u201d Meng Chuan wasn\u2019t in a hurry. Since he had already reached a brand new level by comprehending the secret technique, there was naturally no need for him to make the first move. It was better to let his opponent have a chance to execute a complete move.Swoosh.Bai Guan moved.He quickly moved with both swords in hand. Even though he was confident, he still used all his strength as he charged straight at Meng Chuan. His movement technique was very strange. One moment he appeared on the left, the next moment the right. This unpredictability made it difficult to determine his true location.In the blink of an eye, he was already in front of Meng Chuan, having traversed the arena.\u201cKill.\u201d Bai Guan grinned at Meng Chuan as both swords struck to deliver Heart Sunder. In his opinion, even unsharpened swords could injure Meng Chuan if he was hit.Two swords streaked across Meng Chuan\u2019s body from two different directions.\u201cHuh?\u201d Bai Guan widened his eyes in disbelief because he clearly sensed that he had missed.He then felt a chill run down his spine.He turned around.Standing behind him, Meng Chuan held a saber to his neck.How can it be? How is he this fast? Bai Guan was in disbelief. I didn\u2019t even see it clearly.He didn\u2019t know why, but the enemy who had been right in front of him had appeared behind him. Even the saber was placed on his neck.Clearly, killing him was simple.Ge Yu\u2014who had been leisurely hugging his wine jar and drinking leisurely\u2014was stunned. He widened his eyes in disbelief at this scene. Even the wine jar in his hands slipped and crashed to the ground, shattering. Alcohol flowed everywhere, but Dean Ge Yu didn\u2019t even glance at his beloved alcohol. His gaze was completely fixed on Meng Chuan.\u201cThe secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf! The secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf! Did I, Ge Yu, manage to produce a disciple capable of it?\u201d Ge Yu muttered to himself. He had been the dean for fifteen years, but he had never managed to groom a genius who had a chance of becoming a Godfiend.The lecturers and teaching assistants were also dumbfounded. Their sharp eyes could tell at a glance what move Meng Chuan just used. They also understood what it meant.\u201cIt\u2019s the secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf.\u201d\u201cThe Falling Leaf Saber\u2019s secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf! To think our Mirror Lake Dao Academy has produced a disciple who has figured out the secret technique. He\u2019s only fifteen years old this year. He managed to master it at fifteen. This can\u2019t be anything but the truth!\u201d\u201cOur Mirror Lake Dao Academy has produced a disciple who grasped the secret technique at fifteen!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s our Mirror Lake Dao Academy! Haha\u2026\u201dThese lecturers who had dedicated their lives to the Dao Academy were extremely excited. This was their most glorious moment. The goal of teaching so many disciples in a Dao Academy was to groom true geniuses who could one day become Godfiends.Now that the Mirror Lake Dao Academy had produced such a genius, how could the lecturers not be excited? How could they not go crazy?If the dean and the others were excited, the thousands of disciples watching this scene went completely mad.\u201cHeavens!\u201d\u201cAm I seeing things?\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cI saw two Senior Brother Mengs; one in front of Senior Brother Bai, and one behind him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf! This is the secret technique of the Falling Leaf Saber, Third Autumn Leaf! The dean uses it during his lectures.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf!\u201dAll sorts of discussions erupted. Even the disciples from the Mountain River Pavilion were stunned.At that moment, from the dean to the ordinary disciples, everyone was discussing excitedly. Everyone knew what it meant to figure out the secret technique at fifteen!Swoosh. A disciple suddenly sprinted out of the bustling crowd.\u201cRight, return to the ancestral mansion and report it to the clan.\u201d\u201cQuick! Hurry back, and report the good news!\u201dThere were several Meng family members in the Mirror Lake Dao Academy. When the first Meng family member ran out, one Meng family member after another rushed back home. They wanted to report this great piece of news! On one hand, they shared in his glory, and on the other hand, their family clan would also reward them because they reported the good news.It was natural for money to be given when reporting good news\u2014especially when it was such great news.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The members of the Meng family were running at top speed using their movement techniques.\u201cSecret technique, Third Autumn Leaf?\u201d On the stage, Bai Guan didn\u2019t manage to see it clearly. He heard the discussions around him and recalled the move that Meng Chuan had just executed. Only then did he understand that it was the secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf.\u201cYou figured out the secret technique?\u201dBai Guan stared at Meng Chuan with a complicated expression.Meng Chuan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck at this bottleneck for two years and have finally figured it out.\u201dBai Guan was both jealous and envious. Wasn\u2019t he also stuck at a bottleneck? He was able to focus on dual-wielding, giving him combat strength that far exceeded his peers, but he was still stuck at the bottleneck of a top-notch sword art\u2019s Greater Mastery. He also yearned to figure out the secret technique.\u201cNo wonder you were the first to come up. Yes, you are now completely different from us.\u201d Bai Guan laughed self-deprecatingly and walked off the stage.No one paid Bai Guan any mind.Everyone\u2019s eyes were fixated on the fifteen-year-old youth who still looked like an adolescent. The disciples from Mountain River Pavilion were shocked and envious, including the six disciples at the Mortal Shedding realm. None of them had figured out the secret technique! Most people who were at the Mortal Shedding realm wouldn\u2019t be able to figure out the secret technique and be stuck at this realm their entire lives.Only by figuring out the secret technique could one reach the Seamless realm.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHahaha.\u201d Dean Ge Yu\u2014whose clothes were soaked in alcohol\u2014laughed loudly and proclaimed loudly, \u201cI was right to teach you the Falling Leaf Saber. Wu Qi!\u201dWu Qi was stunned, but he still replied respectfully, \u201cYes, Master!\u201dHe was the strongest among the six Mortal Shedding realm disciples in the Mirror Lake Dao Academy. He was nineteen this year and had reached the perfected Mortal Shedding realm.\u201cGo and fight with Meng Chuan!\u201d Ge Yu\u2019s eyes lit up as he gave the order.\u201cI\u2019ll fight Wu Qi?\u201d Meng Chuan turned his head as well. Wu Qi was at the perfected stage of the Mortal Shedding realm. He was the strongest disciple from Mirror Lake Dao Academy, the current Eldest Senior Brother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9: Godfiend BodyCKtalonCKtalon\u201cCome on!\u201d Meng Chuan looked down from the arena, his eyes burning.Wu Qi was startled by the dean\u2019s order, but his eyes gradually lit up. He looked at Meng Chuan and grinned. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s fight.\u201dSwoosh.He took a step and arrived at the arena, much faster than before.Clang. He moved the shield hanging from his back to his hand and pulled out a thick saber from the shield. This saber was completely black, a red glow surrounding it.With a shield in one hand and a thick saber in the other, Wu Qi stood there like an unshakable mountain. He released an invisible aura, causing the surrounding juniors to shudder.\u201cSenior Brother Wu Qi, you cultivate a Godfiend Body known as the Dark Cloud Fiendbody, am I right?\u201d asked Meng Chuan. The aura causing him some alarm was clearly the aura of a Godfiend body.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s the Dark Cloud Fiendbody!\u201d After Wu Qi said that, he charged towards Meng Chuan. Despite charging forward alone, it felt as if a huge legion of soldiers was crashing down on him! There was no variation in the moves. It was purely a charge consisting of speed and strength.Boom!Wu Qi charged with his shield akin to a speedy phantom. He slammed his shield into Meng Chuan with might that could collapse even a house.With a single step, Meng Chuan dodged the shield and moved to Wu Qi\u2019s side. The saber flashed as it cleaved at him.\u201cKill!\u201d The moment Wu Qi\u2019s shield missed, he very skillfully swung his thick saber resulting in a collision with Meng Chuan\u2019s saber.Clang!Sparks flew when the two sabers collided.Wu Qi took a step back and steadied himself. In contrast, Meng Chuan flew back tens of feet.He\u2019s actually able to unleash such powerful might using the secret technique? Wu Qi\u2019s pupils constricted.Mortal cultivation: Foundation Establishment, Internal Tempering, Marrow Cleansing, Mortal Shedding, Seamless.Among them, the first three cultivation levels were considered ordinary. They allowed one to cultivate Quintessential Energy, causing the mortal body to gradually grow stronger. The gap between them wasn\u2019t that great.However, the fourth level\u2014Mortal Shedding\u2014meant shedding one\u2019s mortal burdens! This was because mortals would possess a portion of Godfiend power when they begin cultivating Godfiend bodies. This increase in strength was astonishing. Wu Qi cultivated the Dark Cloud Fiendbody and had reached the perfected Mortal Shedding stage. His strength and speed was extremely terrifying, far exceeding those of the perfected Marrow Cleansing realm.If he were to deal with the average person at the Marrow Cleansing realm, he could chop his opponent to death in a single exchange.Even if someone at the Marrow Cleansing realm wielded a shield, they would still end up spitting out blood from the saber impact.The difference in strength was simply too great!The power he just released is almost seventy percent of mine. This is equivalent to my strength when I was at the late stage of the Mortal Shedding realm. Wu Qi was shocked. \u201cIs this the power of the secret technique?\u201dHe had long known how terrifying the secret technique was. Even his chances of winning this battle were very low.I still have a chance of winning. Wu Qi gritted his teeth and charged forward again. He was like insolent cavalry as he charged forward.I\u2019m still slightly weaker than him by relying on the power of the secret technique. Third Autumn Leaf is ultimately a secret technique that is more speed-based. Meng Chuan moved, producing another Meng Chuan a hundred feet away.There he is! Wu Qi cultivated the Dark Cloud Fiendbody and was adept at sensing his surroundings. He could sense a figure was charging towards him.Compared to Bai Guan who was unable to fight back, Wu Qi could detect him despite the secret technique\u2014Third Autumn Leaf\u2014being known for its speed. He was even able to respond.Boom! His thick saber chopped down with a swipe.Clang!His saber missed, but the shield in his hand blocked Meng Chuan\u2019s sudden saber strike.He\u2019s really fast. I still missed him. Wu Qi\u2019s heart tightened. Thankfully, he had carefully protected his unguarded areas with his shield. With shield and saber in each hand, he used a powerful skill from Mirror Lake Dao Academy, the Duality Shield Saber Technique. There was a high chance of surviving a battle when one used this top-notch skill. Therefore, Wu Qi had chosen the Dark Cloud Fiendbody that suited this powerful skill.With the Duality Shield Saber Technique combined with his Dark Cloud Fiendbody, his defense was flawless and his attacks were ferocious. He was the number one among the Mirror Lake Dao Academy disciples at the Mortal Shedding realm thanks to this.\u201cDuality Shield Saber Technique\u2014one yin, one yang\u2014is indeed powerful. However, I wonder how many of my moves you can parry.\u201d As Meng Chuan\u2019s voice continued to echo, he lunged forward.\u201cIt\u2019s useless. You won\u2019t be able to hurt me.\u201d Wu Qi stood his ground, using his saber and shield to block Meng Chuan\u2019s ethereal blade.Pfft.Pfft.Swoosh.Meng Chuan\u2019s movements were extremely fast as one saber flash after another appeared. It was none other than the Falling Leaf Saber.In the beginning, Wu Qi was rather confident of his defense, but he found parrying the attacks increasingly difficult as Meng Chuan\u2019s repetitive strikes formed a continuous combo. His stance changed after every successful block. Through the continuous saber combo, Meng Chuan was able to tear apart his defense.In just six strikes, Wu Qi staggered backward as he barely put up a defense.Chi!An extremely quick stab.Wu Qi didn\u2019t even have time to brandish his shield to block before the tip of the blade was already at his throat.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wu Qi looked at the saber that was pressing against his throat before looking at Meng Chuan.This was the first time he had fought someone at the Marrow Cleansing realm who had grasped the secret technique. He had lost terribly.\u201cI\u2019ve lost,\u201d Wu Qi said in a low voice. \u201cThe secret technique is even more terrifying than I thought. Not only can it produce a terrifying speed and strength, but it also improves the finesse of your saber arts.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded.Yes.A secret technique was the combination of body, mind, and technique, so it could naturally release terrifying strength.An ancient Godfiend had once said that a human\u2019s body had tremendous potential. A mortal who had never trained before would find it difficult to carry fifty kilograms of weight. However, if he could perfectly use his potential by utilizing every bone and muscle, he would be able to unleash more than five thousand kilograms of strength! Of course, that was an ideal case where every ounce of potential was used.In reality, the higher one\u2019s mastery of saber arts, the more astonishing the potential one could use.The Unity realm was the first major realm for saber arts.The secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf, multiplied strength and speed! It allowed Meng Chuan\u2019s strength to reach roughly 70% of Wu Qi\u2019s strength\u2014who was at the perfected Mortal Shedding realm\u2014and his speed crushed Wu Qi\u2019s. Furthermore, his control of the saber was more refined. The saber moves perfectly coordinated with each other. Just seven strikes were enough to break through Wu Qi\u2019s Duality Shield Saber Technique which was renowned for its defense.\u201cFrom this day forth, you will be considered the strongest out of thousands of disciples from Mirror Lake Dao Academy.\u201d Wu Qi looked at Meng Chuan and said, \u201cYou will be the Eldest Senior Brother of Mirror Lake Dao Academy\u2019s current generation.\u201dIn Mirror Lake Dao Academy, the accomplished came first.The eldest senior brother of the Dao Academy was the strongest amongst all the disciples. After defeating Wu Qi, Meng Chuan naturally became the eldest senior brother of the Dao Academy.With that said, Wu Qi walked off the stage.Suddenly, many of the juniors began to shout. \u201cEldest Senior Brother Meng Chuan!\u201d\u201cEldest Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cEldest Senior Brother!\u201dBeing the eldest senior brother was just a title; whether he deserved respect was another matter.The few Mirror Lake Dao Academy eldest senior brothers in the past didn\u2019t enjoy much prestige since their strength didn\u2019t stand out much. They did not manage to comprehend the secret technique! There was not much difference in their skills compared to their peers, so it was very possible they might be defeated by other juniors during matches in the future!But Meng Chuan was different!He had figured out the secret technique and defeated Wu Qi\u2014who had reached the perfected Mortal Shedding realm. Furthermore, Meng Chuan would soon reach the Mortal Shedding realm as well. When that happened, the gap between him and his fellow disciples would become even more exaggerated. Even someone at the Mortal Shedding realm wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand a single strike from him!Only an absolutely invincible eldest senior brother would be able to completely impress all his juniors.\u201cHahaha\u201d\u2014Dean Ge Yu chuckled\u2014\u201dAlright, come down.\u201d It was rare for him to be so amiable. \u201cLet the other juniors at the Marrow Cleansing realm fight to determine the other two slots.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan immediately walked down.\u201cGreetings, Senior Brother Meng.\u201d Wan Mang cupped his hands and bowed with a smile.\u201cGreetings, Senior Brother Meng.\u201d The disciples of Mountain River Pavilion around him saluted him with a smile. Some of his fellow disciples had a slight fawning attitude. They knew very well that Meng Chuan was completely different from them. He was a peerless genius in the entire Eastcalm Prefecture, one who had a chance of becoming a Godfiend in the future.\u2026Swoosh! Swoosh!

They instantly attracted a large number of clansmen in the ancestral mansion. All of them were stunned by what they heard. What? Did they hear wrongly? Meng Chuan had figured out the secret technique?\u201cStop right there.\u201d One of the clansmen grabbed a sprinting youth and said hurriedly, \u201cTell me clearly what happened.\u201d\u201cUncle, it\u2019s Brother Meng Chuan.\u201d The youth was only thirteen years old. At that moment, he said happily, \u201cToday is the day our Mirror Lake Dao Academy held the selection. Brother Meng Chuan went up to the stage and used the secret technique of the Falling Leaf Saber, Third Autumn Leaf. Even the dean and lecturers are thrilled.\u201d\u201cThe secret technique of the Falling Leaf Saber, Third Autumn Leaf?\u201d The muscular clansman\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cIsn\u2019t he just fifteen this year? He managed to figure out the secret technique at fifteen?\u201dThe entire ancestral mansion\u2019s clansmen surrounded the youth as they inquired. It turned into a cacophony of excitement.A bald and thin elder narrowed his eyes as he listened to all the chatter. His eyes lit up when he heard the youths all talking at once. He couldn\u2019t help but mutter, \u201cThe heavens have blessed our Meng family.\u201d\u201cThird Elder, it\u2019s a joyous occasion. Meng Chuan figured out the secret technique.\u201d A clansman ran over.\u201cI\u2019m aware!\u201d The thin elder wore his usual stoic look as he turned around and left.He was the strictest elder in the Meng family; however, when he turned around and walked away, there was a faint curl on the corners of his lips.\u2026The Meng family\u2019s ancestral mansion occupied a large amount of land. After all, over two thousand clansmen lived there.In one of the training grounds in the ancestral mansion.A group of youths was practicing with a variety of weapons while the chubby Meng Dajiang sat by the side, watching.Eh, why is it so noisy outside? Meng Dajiang frowned slightly. Following that, the din approached. With his strength as a Seamless realm expert, he could make out the keywords \u201cMeng Chuan\u201d and \u201cfigured out the secret technique.\u201dMeng Dajiang perked up.It was like a bucket of cold water had been poured over him in the middle of winter. He was even a little confused.Did I hear wrongly? Meng Dajiang was a little nervous, but he couldn\u2019t help standing up and walking towards the entrance of the training grounds.\u201cDajiang! Dajiang!\u201d An elegant elder came over with a group of clansmen. The elder\u2019s face was flushed red with extreme joy and excitement.\u201cFifth Uncle\u201d\u2014Meng Dajiang immediately went forward\u2014\u201dwhat happened?\u201d\u201cGreat news! great news!\u201d The elegant elder was very excited.\u201cOh?\u201d Meng Dajiang was both excited and nervous. Although he had some guesses, he still wanted to hear it spelled out completely.The elegant elder immediately said, \u201cSome of the young ones studying at Mirror Lake Dao Academy returned to inform us that your son\u2014Meng Chuan\u2014used the secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf, during the Dao Academy\u2019s selection match. It was witnessed by the dean, lecturers, and thousands of disciples. It can\u2019t be any more real. Hahaha\u2026 The heavens have blessed our Meng family. Our Meng family is blessed.\u201d\u201cChuan\u2019er used the secret technique, Third Autumn Leaf?\u201d Meng Dajiang felt his head heat up as his heart burned.That was his son!\u201cDajiang, your son is amazing.\u201d\u201cOur Meng family is going to rise. We might even have two Godfiends,\u201d the clansmen said excitedly. Apart from the clan leader and Elders, ordinary clansmen didn\u2019t know Fairy Meng had been seriously injured.\u201cElders, Fairy Meng has summoned you.\u201d A clansman came to pass the order.\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in a second.\u201dMeng Dajiang and the elegant elder rushed over. However, Meng Dajian had a bounce in his steps, finding everything surreal.\u2026Fairy Meng and Clan Leader Meng Yanping had been playing chess, but their match had now come to a halt. There were eight Elders gathered in the yard. All of them were extremely excited. Some Elders who weren\u2019t at the ancestral mansion and had yet to catch wind of the news.\u201cThose rascals ran very quickly.\u201d The thin, bald elder was rather excited. \u201cThey were talking about how Meng Chuan used the Third Autumn Leaf secret technique.\u201d\u201cThis is great. He managed to figure out the secret technique at fifteen\u2014his talent is no less than Mei Yuanzhi\u2019s.\u201d\u201cDajiang, you have a good son.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also thanks to Dajiang\u2019s teachings.\u201dThe Elders of the family clan spoke excitedly. Meng Dajiang laughed foolishly. He felt like today was his happiest day in recent years.\u201cI\u2019ll rest in peace having learned this news.\u201d\u201cThe heavens have blessed our Meng family.\u201dThe Elders had always been afraid their family clan would decline. Although they were approaching the end of their lifespans, they still hoped the family clan would prosper.The flourishing of a family clan meant that their brothers and clansmen\u2014as well as children and grandchildren\u2014could live well. Over countless years, there was no divide in the family clan.\u201cLook at all of you.\u201d The seated Fairy Meng smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s indeed a joyous occasion for the child to be able to comprehend the secret technique, but you are all counting your chickens.\u201dThis stunned all the Elders.Fairy Meng said, \u201cMeng Chuan has only taken the first step. He\u2019s still far from becoming a Godfiend. He still needs to figure out Saber Force, condense his core, and survive the final Life-and-Death juncture! These are the three major thresholds. Don\u2019t put him on a pedestal too early, or it might get to his head. He needs to cultivate more seriously. It\u2019s best if he can figure out Saber Force before he turns twenty. That way, there\u2019s still a thirty percent chance of entering Archean Mountain. If he can enter Archean Mountain, he will definitely become a Godfiend.\u201d\u201cArchean Mountain!\u201d The eyes of Clan Leader Meng Yanping and the other Elders lit up.It was the most ancient cultivation ground in the world. Mysterious and powerful.In the past century, only the patriarch of the Zhang family had successfully entered Archean Mountain. The Zhang family had also become the leader of the five major Godfiend clans in Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201cIf Meng Chuan can\u2019t enter Archean Mountain, his cultivation path will be fraught with difficulty,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cBack then, I figured out the secret technique at 16. I only figured out Force at 22, barring my entry into Archean Mountain. I could only be considered an outer sect disciple of Archean Mountain. I was lucky to become a Godfiend after a close encounter with death. There were people with talent on par with mine back then, but only I became a Godfiend. The rest died.\u201d\u201cNot only does Meng Chuan have the three thresholds\u2014Saber Force, Core Condensation, and Life-and-Death\u2014he also needs to figure out Saber Force before he turns 20,\u201d said Fairy Meng solemnly.The Elders present also calmed down.Becoming a Godfiend was truly very difficult.The current Meng Chuan was just a seedling with a chance of becoming a Godfiend. He simply allowed the family clan to see hope.\u201cDajiang,\u201d instructed Fairy Meng. \u201cGo to Mirror Lake Dao Academy and bring Meng Chuan back. Have him prepare for the Jadesun Palace\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet. After it\u2019s over, Meng Chuan should have calmed down. Bring him to me when that happens.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said Meng Dajiang respectfully.\u201cAll of you can take your leave,\u201d instructed Fairy Meng. \u201cRemember, don\u2019t put Meng Chuan on a pedestal too much. Making him arrogant will just ruin him.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the Elders replied solemnly.Whoever dared to ruin Meng Chuan would be the sworn enemy of the entire Meng family!Soon, the Elders left. Only Fairy Meng and her brother were left in the yard.\u201cThird Sis, you almost scared them.\u201d Meng Yanping laughed. \u201cI know you are very happy.\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m happy.\u201d Only then did Fairy Meng sigh poignantly. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Godfiend for nearly eighty years. I\u2019ve made plenty of contributions to Archean Mountain, and I have many good friends! If my family doesn\u2019t have any exceptional talents, all I\u2019ve done would be for nought. Since Meng Chuan has shown some talent, I\u2019ll do my best to help him. He will definitely tread a road much smoother than mine.\u201d\u201cYes. He will definitely become a Godfiend,\u201d said Meng Yanping.\u201cHe will!\u201d Fairy Meng\u2019s eyes were filled with anticipation.\u2026At the Mirror Lake Dao Academy, the disciples around him kept shouting \u201cSenior Brother Meng.\u201d They were extremely enthusiastic.Meng Chuan nodded slightly and continued walking out.\u201cMmm?\u201dJust as he reached the main entrance, he saw a group of people standing outside the main gates of the Dao Academy. Leading them was the plump Meng Dajiang. Beside him was the bald, thin elder, the elegant elder, and several other family clan Elders.\u201cDad. Elders.\u201d Meng Chuan walked over.\u201cYou rascal.\u201d Meng Dajiang ruffled Meng Chuan\u2019s hair and smiled. \u201cYou really gave me a fright.\u201dMeng Chuan could only bear the ruffling of his hair. He looked a little pitiful, but in reality, he was in an exceptionally good mood.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHaha, even we were shocked.\u201d\u201cMeng Chuan, well done.\u201d The Elders of the family clan smiled and congratulated. Clearly, they were elated.\u201cCome, let\u2019s go home,\u201d said Meng Dajiang happily. What more could he ask for with a son like this?\u201cOkay.\u201dMeng Chuan answered and went home with his father and elders.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yun Fu\u2019an swayed his head to the tune, fully immersed in the music.The song came to an end.\u201cXiangyin, your rendition of this song is becoming more outstanding. My heart almost melted from your singing,\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an smiled.\u201cBrother Yun, you flatter me. I\u2019m still far from that. I still need to learn from Teacher,\u201d said the blue-clothed woman.\u201cIt\u2019s different. Your teacher\u2019s skills are brilliant, but she\u2019s old. How can her voice be comparable to yours? Singing still depends on talent. Your voice is superb. Whatever you sing is nice,\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an praised.\u201cThen allow me to sing another song for you, Brother Yun.\u201d The blue-dressed woman covered her mouth and giggled before she began plucking the zither strings.She had to keep Yun Fu\u2019an happy.The patriarch of the Yun family had a total of five sons and one daughter. Among them were the three eldest brothers who had gone through all sorts of hardships during their childhood, experiencing calamities with their father. They were all experts at the Seamless realm now. Two of them had figured out \u201cForce\u201d and were extremely skilled. They were known as the \u201cThree Heroes of the Yun Family.\u201d On the other hand, the three youngest children hadn\u2019t suffered much hardship.For example, Yun Fu\u2019an\u2019s father had already become a Godfiend when Yun Fu\u2019an was young. This allowed him to lead a carefree life. At the time, the Yun family patriarch had just broken through and was still focused on cultivation; he had no time to discipline his children. Thus, his three youngest children were somewhat useless.Yun Fu\u2019an was a little special. As the youngest son, he had grown up with a group of scions, so he was quite the sly one.He was good at reading someone\u2019s body language; he was skilled at trampling and praising different kinds of people. He was also well-versed in many dirty tricks. The Three Heroes of the Yun Family liked this younger brother of theirs quite a bit due to his astuteness. They allowed their younger brother to handle many things without any worries, and he also completed the tasks beautifully.Thus, Yun Fu\u2019an wielded a lot of power and authority. He was responsible for many matters in the family clan.A single word from him could cause a famous character to disappear from the world. Likewise, he could turn a particular lady into a star.\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an listened to the tune and softly hummed to it.Suddenly, a commotion broke out in the restaurant. The loud noise made Yun Fu\u2019an frown slightly.The private room was soundproof, and there was only one room on the top floor of the three-storied building. It was very quiet, but the noise was quite loud.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an frowned, and said, \u201cAh Fu, go down and see what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d The servant outside immediately went down.The servant soon returned and immediately said, \u201cMaster, something serious has happened.\u201dYun Fu\u2019an stretched out his hand, and the blue-clothed woman immediately stopped playing the zither. Once there was serious business, there was no way she could affect this man. She knew her limits.\u201cCome in and tell me,\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an instructed.The servant pushed the door open and said in a low voice, \u201cIt isn\u2019t only this restaurant; the entire Eastcalm Prefecture is abuzz. It\u2019s all because of Young Master Meng Chuan.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up with him?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an frowned, a trace of disdain appearing on the corner of his lips. He didn\u2019t think much of the Meng family anymore. His Yun family was on the rise, while the Meng family was on the decline.\u201cMeng Chuan showcased the Falling Leaf Saber secret technique\u2014Third Autumn Leaf\u2014 at the Mirror Lake Dao Academy. He\u2019s even defeated the original Eldest Senior Brother\u2014Wu Qi\u2014who was in the perfected Mortal Shedding realm. He\u2019s become the Eldest Senior Brother of his Dao Academy.\u201d The servant said, \u201cHe defeated somebody at the perfected Mortal Shedding realm by using the secret technique, despite only being at the Marrow Cleansing realm\u2026 He figured out the saber secret technique, Master\u2014\u201dYun Fu\u2019an\u2014whose face had completely darkened\u2014shouted, \u201cGet out!\u201dThe servant didn\u2019t dare make a sound; he obediently left and closed the door behind him.Yun Fu\u2019an brooded in silence before standing up and walking to the window. When he opened the window, the sound of the streets outside grew louder.Keywords like \u201cMeng Chuan\u201d and 'secret technique\u201d could still be heard.This matter had become the talk of the town in all of Eastcalm Prefecture.This kid made a breakthrough? Yun Fu\u2019an\u2019s face was gloomy. Humph. So what if he figured out the secret technique? He\u2019s still far from becoming a Godfiend.Bang!He slammed the windows shut.\u2026The other three Godfiend family clans in the Eastcalm Prefecture found it interesting as well! This was because not long ago, the Yun family had just terminated the engagement between the two families. That engagement happened to be between Yun Qingping and Meng Chuan!If the Yun family knew Meng Chuan would grasp the secret technique at fifteen years of age, their decision would have been different.However, how miniscule was the possibility of a peerless genius being born?The Yun family didn\u2019t dare delay matters!Under normal circumstances, the engagement would be acted upon once one was 18 because they would have to serve the military at 20. Therefore, the Yun family didn\u2019t wish to delay the matter. Annulling the engagement early was for the best.He has only grasped the secret technique. He\u2019s still far from becoming a Godfiend. The Yun family could only console themselves.\u2026At the Mirror Lake Meng Manor.\u201cAh Chuan, tell me the truth. Had you already broken through when you made the bet with me?\u201d Liu Qiyue stared at Meng Chuan.\u201cYou\u2019re smart.\u201d Meng Chuan smiled and nodded. \u201cHowever, I had just broken through back then.\u201d\u201cY-you\u2026\u201d Liu Qiyue was at a loss for words.\u201cI already told you that I would get the spot, but you refused to believe me and insisted on betting with me. Who is to be blamed?\u201d Meng Chuan laughed. \u201cWhat? Are you going back on your word?\u201dLiu Qiyue raised her head high. \u201cI, Liu Qiyue, never go back on my word!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m impressed. I admire you, Sister Qiyue,\u201d he immediately complimented her. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be waiting for a consecutive month\u2019s worth of dinner made by my dearest Sister Qiyue.\u201d\u201cJust treat it as a gift for figuring out the secret technique.\u201d Liu Qiyue was a little indignant. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so cunning.\u201d\u201cChuan\u2019er.\u201d A voice came from afar.\u201cFather is calling for me. I\u2019ll be off first.\u201d Meng Chuan immediately ran off.Liu Qiyue scoffed. \u201cBig liar, what a good liar. However, you are quite impressive. You actually managed to achieve Unity with your saber art.\u201d\u2026On the training grounds.\u201cDad.\u201d Meng Chuan stood in front of his father.\u201cI\u2019m very happy you achieved a breakthrough in your saber art.\u201d Meng Dajiang looked at his son and said, \u201cBut don\u2019t let it get to your head. There are still the three thresholds: \u2018Force,\u2019 \u2018Core Condensation,\u2019 and \u2018Life-and-Death\u2019 awaiting you. Every step you take will be extremely difficult. There are very few people who can help you. It will all mostly depend on yourself.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been cultivating diligently since you were young, so I won\u2019t say anything else. Cultivate hard and become a Godfiend!\u201d Meng Dajiang said encouragingly.\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we sparred. Come, let\u2019s spar,\u201d said Meng Dajiang with a laugh.\u201cCome on!\u201d Meng Chuan was filled with fighting spirit.But, his father was a Seamless expert who had figured out Saber Force. He was considered one of the strongest in Eastcalm Prefecture beneath the Godfiend realm; he could devastate his son however he wished.\u2026In the evening.Meng Chuan was drawing a long piece of scroll art in the study room. He was only partially done since he started yesterday after figuring out the Third Autumn Leaf.There were scenes of him training hard, a scene of him defeating Wu Qi in the Dao Academy arena, and scenes of his father and Elders congratulating him when he exited the Dao Academy. It included his father ruffling his hair with a flabbergasted Liu Qiyue drawn to the side.He smiled as he drew. He was completely immersed in his thoughts, and the feelings within him integrated into the tip of his brush.The more intense the feelings infused into the drawing, the more infatuated he became.Sometime later.After he finished drawing, Meng Chuan glanced out and saw that it was getting dark outside. He wrote the three words \u201cThird Autumn Leaf,\u201d to the left of the painting.This painting was called Third Autumn Leaf. Meng Chuan felt extremely serene when looking at the painting.\u2026In the bustling Eastcalm Prefecture.A white-robed youth led an old servant through the streets.\u201cEastcalm Prefecture is quite lively,\u201d said the white-robed youth expressionlessly.\u201cThis is a city with a population of over a million. It would naturally be lively.\u201d The old servant smiled. \u201cYoung Master, are we going to stay in Eastcalm Prefecture for the next few years? How about we go to the State Capital?\u201d\u201cThis is my mother\u2019s hometown. I\u2019ll be staying here,\u201d the white-robed youth said coldly.The old servant was helpless.Nobody could control the young master with his temper.Suddenly, they heard people discussing on the streets. \u201cYoung Master Meng Chuan is impressive to have figured out the secret technique. He\u2019s only fifteen this year, right?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes, he\u2019s fifteen. In my opinion, Young Master Meng Chuan will probably become a Godfiend in the future.\u201dHearing the discussions, the old servant chuckled softly as well. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that there would be such a genius in Eastcalm Prefecture. He happens to be the same age as you.\u201dMeng Chuan\u2026 murmured the white-robed youth inwardly.\u201cYoung Master, let\u2019s go this way. The Jadesun Palace is up ahead,\u201d said the old servant. \u201cWe have to pay a visit to Palace Lord Jadesun first.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The white-robed youth nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The dean of Mirror Lake Dao Academy\u2014Ge Yun\u2014disembarked from the first carriage while six people alighted from the carriage behind. They were none other than the six Mirror Lake Dao Academy\u2019s disciples that included Meng Chuan, Wu Qi, and Wan Mang. The spacious carriage gave plenty of space to the six without making it appear cramped.\u201cJadesun Palace.\u201d The six of them raised their heads and stared at the palace.Jadesun Palace was considered sacred ground in Eastcalm Prefecture. Palace Lord Jadesun was also the most powerful existence in the Eastcalm Prefecture.The legendary Archean Mountain built a Jadesun Palace in every city within the Great Zhou Dynasty. It also sent a disciple to preside over each Jadesun Palace. Palace Lord Jadesun was the most powerful force when it came to protecting a prefecture! In the past century or so, the most powerful Godfiend in Eastcalm Prefecture\u2014the Zhang family\u2019s patriarch\u2014had also been recruited into Archean Mountain. Now, he too was stationed somewhere else.\u201cFollow me in.\u201d Ge Yu led the way and his six disciples entered the Jadesun Palace.At that moment, several luxurious carriages arrived behind them and people alighted from the carriage.Meng Chuan and company looked back.\u201cOh?\u201d Meng Chuan saw Yun Qingping and Yun Fu\u2019an. Yun Fu\u2019an had even brought his wife along.\u201cThe Jadesun Palace\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet is a rare event for Eastcalm Prefecture. The Imperial Court and the five major Godfiend families will send people here too,\u201d said Ge Yu casually. \u201cHowever, each family clan is limited to ten people at most.\u201d\u2026It\u2019s Meng Chuan. Yun Qingping, together with her clansmen, saw Meng Chuan as well. At that moment, she felt rather conflicted.After all, she had previously been informed that he was the man to marry her\u2014that she was to spend the rest of her life with him when she became of age!Although the engagement had been successfully annulled, her impression of him was different from others. Besides, the engagement had just been called off right before Meng Chuan suddenly made a name of himself by figuring out the secret technique. He was now an illustrious genius in the entire Eastcalm Prefecture. Even her clansmen and friends had plenty to say about this matter. It caused her to feel unsettled.However, Yun Qingping knew very well that she didn\u2019t regret it. No matter how powerful Meng Chuan was, he was not what she wanted!\u201cAll of you are to watch carefully,\u201d said the rather stocky Yun family clan leader\u2014Yun Fucheng. He looked at the six young juniors and said, \u201cWhen you turn twenty and serve in the military, you will be battling the demons in life-and-death battles. You now have the chance to personally witness the demons\u2019 ferocity. If anyone closes their eyes from fright, you will be punished with isolation for ten days!\u201d\u201cYes, Dad (Uncle),\u201d Yun Qingping, and the other five youths replied obediently.Yun Fucheng\u2014the eldest son of the Yun family\u2019s patriarch\u2014was the most outstanding among the Three Heroes.He had contributed greatly during his military service at Qinyang Pass. He not only figured out Force, but he had also succeeded in condensing his core. However, he had damaged his foundation after casting a forbidden spell for too long during an intense battle with demons. This wiped out his chances of becoming a Godfiend.\u201cBrother, let\u2019s hurry in. Let\u2019s not block the entrance to the palace.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an immediately laughed. He always wore a smiling face in front of his eldest brother. Even if he was scolded by his eldest brother, he would obediently endure it! He had no choice. The military at Qinyang Pass and the Imperial Court held his brother\u2014Yun Fucheng\u2014in high esteem.Yun Fucheng nodded. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go in.\u201dThe two brothers led their wives and their six juniors into Jadesun Palace.\u2026In an empty square in Jadesun Palace, there was a large arena. There were many chairs placed around the arena.Seats were designated for the eight major Dao Academies, five large family clans, Imperial Court, and Jadesun Palace.Meng Chuan naturally sat where Mirror Lake Dao Academy\u2019s seats were located.Chuan\u2019er. The clan leader\u2014Meng Yanping\u2014and Meng Dajiang had brought eight juniors from the Meng family over to broaden their horizons. Meng Dajiang even winked at Meng Chuan.\u201cThis dad of mine,\u201d Meng Chuan muttered.The various large family clans brought plenty of juniors. Meng Chuan soon discovered that the five large family clans typically had two or three high-ranking members leading a group of juniors. It was to allow the juniors to broaden their horizons. Only the Yun family is different. Yun Fucheng and Yun Fu\u2019an both brought their wives. Ah, that\u2019s right\u2026 There are only six juniors between the ages of six to twenty in the Yun family.The Yun family had too few members.The Yun family\u2019s patriarch was the first generation. The second generation consisted of five sons and a daughter. The third generation was Yun Qingping\u2019s generation\u2026There were only a few dozen people in the Yun family.When they participated in the Cloud Yang Palace\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet, all juniors of suitable age would be brought here. They could even bring their wives over.As for the juniors from the other four large families, they had intense internal competitions just to spectate the battle.\u201cPalace Lord Jadesun is here.\u201dEverybody present stood up in unison. Even the magistrate that came from the Imperial Court stood up and took the initiative to welcome him.Palace Lord Jadesun? Meng Chuan looked from afar.He was a tall, muscular young man. His entire body seemed to be carved out of jade. He seemed to be the most dazzling existence in the world as he walked forward. His eyes glistened. Whoever he looked at would irresistibly bow their heads\u2014not daring to meet his eyes. This was the most powerful figure in Eastcalm Prefecture\u2014its guardian.He was also a Godfiend that came from Archean Mountain!Palace Lord Jadesun walked to the seat of honor and sat down. Although he was seated, people could sense an invisible aura envelop the area. Even the uninhibited and unrestrained dean\u2014Ge Yu\u2014carefully obeyed the rules in front of Palace Lord Jadesun.Oh? Only then did Meng Chuan and company notice that behind Palace Lord Jadesun stood a thin, frail-looking teenager and a white-robed youth.That skinny, frail-looking teenager is Mei Yuanzhi. Who is the white-robed youth? Meng Chuan was somewhat puzzled.\u201cSenior Brother Meng, do you know who that white-robed youth is?\u201d Wan Mang asked softly.\u201cNo.\u201d Meng Chuan shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for Mei Yuanzhi to stand behind Palace Lord Jadesun, but who is that white-robed youth?\u201d Soft murmurs were occurring in other places as well. Everyone had noticed the white-robed youth.At that moment, the prefectural magistrate took a few steps forward and surveyed his surroundings. In a clear voice, he said, \u201cEveryone, the Jadesun Palace\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet is held once every three years. It\u2019s an event decided by Archean Mountain. It is meant to train the youths from various prefectures and allow young heroes to have a chance to fight demons before entering the battlefield. They can truly experience the strength of the demons. This way, they will have a higher chance of survival once they enter the battlefield. Everyone, you have to understand the good intentions of Archean Mountain.\u201d\u201cListen carefully to the rules of this Demon-Slaying Meet,\u201d the magistrate said in a loud, clear voice. \u201cIf you realize that you can\u2019t withstand the demons when engaging them in a life-and-death battle, all you need to do is jump off the arena to live. You don\u2019t have to worry about any accidents, because with the Palace Lord around, nothing will happen.\u201dAs he spoke, the magistrate smiled at Palace Lord Jadesun.\u201cOutsiders are not allowed to interfere with anything that happens in the arena. There should be no complaints or resentment even if they die in battle. These are the rules of the Demon-Slaying Meet. Nobody is allowed to violate them,\u201d the magistrate said coldly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this first. There have been people who died in the arena. Some have been crippled as well. If you are afraid, you can give up this opportunity.\u201dNo one would give up.The battlefield would be much more dangerous than this while serving in the military. If they gave up the chance now, they would be looked down upon by the entire Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s begin the Demon-Slaying Meet.\u201d After saying this, the magistrate returned to his seat.A jail wagon slowly drove over.An upright, fat pig demon was locked inside the jail wagon. It was about twelve feet tall and was covered in black fur. Its eyes were filled with hatred as it stared at the people sitting outside the cage.\u201cBe good,\u201d said a one-armed man who pulled the jail wagon.Upon hearing the man\u2019s voice, the pig demon trembled\u2014a hint of fear in its eyes.\u201cAs long as you secure victory in the arena, you will be able to eat your fill. As long as you can kill a human youth, you will enjoy ten days of good food and wine,\u201d the one-armed man said. \u201cBut you are not allowed to leave the arena. If you dare to leave the arena, you will be sliced to death!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d The pig demon\u2019s voice was low as it spoke human words.The jail wagon arrived beside the arena.The cage\u2019s door was opened.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGo up,\u201d the one-armed man said coldly.With a single step, the pig demon leaped onto the arena. Its wrists were shackled by heavy chains\u2014the chains struck the arena\u2019s ground when the pig demon landed.Meng Chuan could vaguely sense the tremendous power within the pig demon when he stared at it. The black pig hair was tough, no weaker than heavy armor. The pig demon was currently staring at its surroundings with killing intent. To it, every human around it was an archenemy! The madness in its eyes, the intense hatred, and killing intent caused the hearts of some human youths to tremble. The youngest eight-year-old child from the Yun family was so frightened that the color in his face drained as he tightly hugged his mother.\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to hug your mother.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an berated his son before coldly glaring at his wife. \u201cAn excessively doting mother will only spoil a child!\u201dAt this moment, an official from the Imperial Court flipped through the name list and said loudly, \u201cThe disciples at the Marrow Cleansing stage shall head into the arena first. The first one is Zhang Rushang from the Blazing Sun Academy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Almost all of them had to serve the military in the future. This was something unavoidable.\u201cPig demon.\u201d A muscular youth with a shield in his left hand and a huge axe in his right hand jumped onto the arena and stared at the pig demon on the opposite side of the arena.The pig demon stared at the human, revealing a mouth full of sharp teeth as it let out a low grunt before charging.Boom!The pig demon barged around with extremely fast speed.\u201cWhat speed!\u201d\u201cThis speed matches those of the Mortal Shedding realm. The books are right. Even the most ordinary lesser demons have bodies that match a Mortal Shedding realm fighter.\u201d Many Dao Academy disciples\u2019 hearts tightened as they watched. This was already the most ordinary lesser demon.The youth\u2014Zhang Rushang\u2014retreated to the side just as his opponent was about to collide with him. With shield and axe in hand, he swung his axe to cleave at the pig demon\u2019s bottom.The pig demon had charged too quickly and was unable to change directions in time, but it raised its right arm and \u201cbrushed\u201d past the shield with its right elbow. The youth, Zhang Rushang, was overwhelmed by the surge of strength and staggered three steps back. His cleave missed.The books say that demons have powerful bodies, but their combat skills are inferior to ours. It\u2019s true. Zhang Rushang thought, But they are even more savage. I can\u2019t make any mistakes. I have to find an opportunity to kill it in one fell swoop.\u201cHumph!\u201d The pig demon\u2019s eyes turned even crazier as it continued its fierce assault.The pig demon was incomparably savage in the arena. It was extremely strong, and it was incredibly fast as well. Even when it casually brushed against the human youth, he would be knocked backward by the strength behind the blow. But the human youth was tenacious and his footwork exquisite. He never fought the pig demon head-on, and his shield\u2019s defensive strength was high as well. He was able to completely block the pig demon\u2019s repeated charges in a very slippery manner.\u201cThis junior of your Zhang family is really good at using his shield.\u201d\u201cHe completely defended himself and didn\u2019t give the pig demon any chances.\u201d\u201cI wonder if this pig demon has a trick up its sleeve.\u201d The upper echelons of the five major family clans were also chatting.Suddenly, the pig demon\u2019s brandishing claws increased in speed.This surprised Zhang Rushang as his expression changed drastically. He immediately ducked to hide behind the shield.Bam! The claw slammed into the shield. Although the angle of the shield caused the pig demon to feel some discomfort, this blow still caused the shield to fly up. Zhang Rushang made use of the attack\u2019s momentum to fly backward and land outside the arena.As soon as he landed on the ground outside the arena, Zhang Rushang spat out a mouthful of blood\u2014his face pale.How sinister. It actually hid its strength. Zhang Rushang stared at the pig demon on the stage.\u201cCount yourself lucky for escaping fast,\u201d said the pig demon in a deep voice.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis pig demon actually hid a trick up its sleeves?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying how it schemed to use it at a critical moment.\u201d The disciples of the Dao Academy were somewhat nervous. Thankfully, the first person to fight\u2014Zhang Rushang\u2014was a cautious person and good at defending. If it were another Dao Academy disciple, they might have suffered terribly.\u201cIt really hid something up its sleeves.\u201d The five family clans\u2019 upper echelons chatted casually. They had experience fighting demons on the battlefield, so they were acutely aware of how savage demons were! The scene in front of them was very \u201cmild\u201d to them.The Imperial Court official who was looking at the name list laughed loudly. \u201cDemons are sentient as well. They also scheme, so they are not to be underestimated. Alright, next up will be the Spring Rain Dao Academy\u2019s Xiahou Song.\u201dThe pig demon continued standing in the arena as he talked to the one-armed man in a deep voice. \u201cI won the first round.\u201d\u201cYou can return to prison after winning three rounds,\u201d said the one-armed man.\u201cAlright.\u201d The pig demon nodded, its eyes filled with fierceness. It would kill a human youth if it had the chance to. It wasn\u2019t simply because of the food and drink it could enjoy from killing a human youth, but to enact revenge on the humans because it was captured by them. As long as it could take revenge for being left with such an abject fate, it would naturally want to take revenge.The second youth on stage, Xiahou Song, used a saber. His saber arts were exquisite. His footwork was profound, preventing the pig demon from touching him at all.He eventually found an opportunity.Pfft. He slashed straight at the pig demon\u2019s body. After tearing through the thick layer of hair, his saber was firmly stuck in the pig demon\u2019s muscles. This caused Xiahou Song\u2019s expression to change drastically.Not good.He immediately abandoned his saber and retreated without any hesitation. However, the pig demon took the opportunity to fiercely slap him. Xiahou Song was struck, and the loud slap left the Dao Academy disciples worried.The upper echelons of the five great family clans, the prefectural magistrate, and the others were all very calm. This was really trivial.Xiahou Song immediately flew out of the arena as blood splattered across the ground.Thankfully, Xiahou Song wore a family heirloom\u2014a protective armor. He was only heavily injured and didn\u2019t lose his life. He just needed a few months of recuperation to fully recover. It was truly fortunate.\u201cNext, Wind Center Dao Academy, Ruan Mi.\u201d\u201cSharpshooter Ruan Mi.\u201d He instantly garnered the attention of many. Every sharpshooter was extremely important. Even Meng Chuan carefully watched because Qiyue was also a sharpshooter! Much could be referenced from Ruan Mi\u2019s battle with the demon.Ruan Mi was quite famous amongst the younger generation in Eastcalm Prefecture. He was from an ordinary family clan, but becoming a sharpshooter made things different. He became one of the most influential disciples in Wind Center Dao Academy. He held a large bow with his long arms, and he immediately drew his bow and shot an arrow after leaping onto the arena.Swoosh.The arrow pierced through the air.It was fast! An archer going all out was extremely terrifying.The pig demon immediately howled as it charged forward. At the same time, it brandished its claws and sent the first arrow flying; its other claw protected its head. This was its vital point.But right after, a second arrow pierced through its thigh and remained stuck in its thigh! The normal blades of a Marrow Cleansing expert would have their might greatly reduced after tearing through its hide, but this arrow completely pierced through its thigh, affecting the pig demon\u2019s movements. Ruan Mi wore a cold expression as he moved, quickly shooting the third and fourth arrow in succession.Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!The third and fourth arrows were all aimed at the legs. The pig demon\u2019s muscles and bones gripped the arrows, and there wasn\u2019t much blood. However, its speed halved. This made Ruan Mi a lot more relaxed. He quickly moved agilely around the edge of the arena while shooting out one arrow after another.\u201cDie.\u201d\u201cDie!\u201d The pig demon could vaguely sense that death was approaching. It began to grow even more frenzied as it drew closer to the human sharpshooter.However, its legs just couldn\u2019t be any faster. The short distance between them was like a massive chasm that could not be closed.The pig demon\u2019s body was hit by a total of twelve arrows as it howled and ran. It was until the twelfth arrow that the pig demon\u2019s head\u2014its weakness\u2014was pierced through. This arrow finally caused the pig demon to collapse to the ground and convulse. It could no longer stand up.\u201cA demon\u2019s vitality is really strong,\u201d Ruan Mi muttered.\u201cWell done.\u201d\u201cBeautiful.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere were cheers, the loudest coming from the Wind Center Dao Academy disciples.\u201cTake it away.\u201d The one-armed man by the side of the arena ordered his soldiers. Immediately, two soldiers walked up to the arena and dragged the pig demon\u2019s corpse away. Only its blood remained on the arena.No one cared about the death of a pig demon!The demons were invaders and massacred humans. Humans only wanted to protect their homes, but even so, large numbers of humans died for this endeavor. Half of those who served in the military died, and numerous people were crippled. From this, one could see the price humans had to pay for peace.Countless human commoners had been slaughtered. Archean Mountain established Jadesun Palaces in every prefectural city and sent Godfiends to preside over them to protect the commoners! Godfiends watched over an area, eliminating all demons who dared to infiltrate human territory. This was the only way to stabilize the human race\u2019s numbers. The hatred humans had for demons was irreconcilable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Inside it was an even larger wolf demon. The wolf demon was hunched slightly, its head touching the top of the jail wagon. It grabbed the metal railings with its claws and stared at the humans outside.Clank. The one-armed man opened the cage and calmly said to the wolf demon, \u201cYou have already been informed of the rules. You can head back alive after winning three consecutive rounds. You can also enjoy delicious food and wine. If you violate the rules, you will be hacked to death!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d The wolf demon growled hoarsely and entered the arena. It immediately saw the blood that was thick with a demonic aura. It\u2019s from that stupid pig!Although low-level demons had their internal rivalry, it felt sad over the death of its kind at this moment because it was very likely that it would die in this arena as well.But the truth was\u2014the wolf demon won three consecutive matches. Not only did it heavily injure a human youth, it even tore apart another human youth\u2019s arm. It was impossible to treat a severed arm.After the wolf demon was taken away, another demon took its place.Battles kept happening.The human youths and demons both wanted to kill each other.The disciples of the eight major Dao Academies were extremely solemn. Some were even extremely nervous because all of them had to head on stage. This was not a normal sparring match between fellow disciples, but a battle of life and death. Demons did not hold back.Liu Qiyue also had her turn. She killed a cat demon, but she was forced to jump off the stage when facing a more ferocious leopard demon.\u2026\u201c23 disciples from the Dao Academies have had their turn,\u201d said Clan Leader Meng Yanping in a low voice. \u201cDajiang, Meng Chuan\u2019s turn is coming.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Dajiang also glanced at Meng Chuan\u2014who was far away from the disciples of Mirror Lake Dao Academy.Yes.It was almost Meng Chuan\u2019s turn.As the only Marrow Cleansing realm disciple of the eight Dao Academies to comprehend the secret technique, he was naturally placed last.\u201cSenior Brother Meng, you have to be careful.\u201d Wan Mang\u2019s bloody chest was bandaged up. \u201cThe demons are very cunning.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.Most of the twenty-three Dao Academy disciples who fought were very cautious. Only six of them were truly seriously injured, and their injuries were all treatable. Except one\u2026 His arm had been ripped off by the wolf demon\u2014his name was Bai Fengqi. He came from one of the five Godfiend family clans, the Bai family. He kept crying the moment he jumped off the stage.His grandfather was present today as well. He immediately berated him angrily, \u201cWhy are you crying? You clearly knew how powerful the wolf demon is, yet you were rash. Who can you blame? You lost an arm in a one-on-one battle while the demon was chained up. If you were on the battlefield, you would have lost your life. Cultivate well when you\u2019re back. Our family has single-armed sword techniques.\u201dDespite berating him angrily, his grandfather\u2019s eyes were slightly red. After all, this was his grandson\u2014one that he had always been proud of.The Dao Academy disciples sympathized with Bai Fengqi. He had lost his arm at the age of sixteen.However, the deans, government officials, and the upper echelons of the five large family clans present were mostly calm. They had seen incidents far crueler than this. Archean Mountain came up with the Demon-Slaying Meet because it didn\u2019t wish for human elites to die the moment they entered the battlefield. Therefore, they had to suffer in their youth and broaden their horizons. In the future, they would train harder and be more careful on the battlefield.Six humans were heavily injured. One of them was crippled. Twelve demons went on stage, but only five of them died in battle! Meng Chuan was very calm. He did not feel nervous or afraid.He had already seen how terrifying the demons were when he was six! More than a hundred thousand people were slaughtered back then! If not for a Godfiend arriving, few humans would have survived. The body count would have doubled. The Godfiend alone had caused the demons to collapse and flee in panic. It also gave the humans who had scattered in all directions a chance to survive. Besides his parents risking their lives, Meng Chuan had survived because the Godfiend had joined the fray later.After experiencing all of that, the restricted one-on-one battles with the demons on the arena\u2026 were very mild in comparison. The human youths could survive by simply jumping off the arena.\u201cNext. Mirror Lake Dao Academy, Meng Chuan,\u201d the official\u2019s voice spoke a few decibels louder.All of a sudden, everyone\u2019s gazes fell on Meng Chuan.Meng Chuan had been the topic of discussion in Eastcalm Prefecture for the past few days. Everyone knew that Eastcalm Prefecture had produced another genius who had a chance of becoming a Godfiend.\u201cBe careful.\u201d Dean Ge Yu instructed.\u201cYes, Dean.\u201d Meng Chuan stood up and walked towards the arena.\u201cAh Chuan, show them what you got.\u201d Liu Qiyue pumped her fists into the air from Blazing Sun Dao Academy\u2019s area.\u201cWatch me.\u201d Meng Chuan smiled.In the Yun family camp, Yun Fucheng watched from afar. He smiled and said, \u201cFu\u2019an, this Meng Chuan seems to have a good temperament. Unfortunately, he isn\u2019t fated with Qingping.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an smiled obsequiously. However, his gaze towards Meng Chuan turned colder.The more outstanding Meng Chuan was, the more unhappy he felt.On the other hand, Yun Qingping was watching anxiously. She had been quite shocked by what she saw today. It was her first time seeing the demons of legend. They were ugly and savage.At the seat of honor.Palace Lord Jadesun sat there as his gaze landed on Meng Chuan. He smiled and said to his side, \u201cYuanzhi, this Meng Chuan figured out the secret technique at fifteen. You can be considered as the number one person in the younger generation of Eastcalm Prefecture, while he\u2019s second. Furthermore, being from the Meng family, Fairy Meng will definitely try her best to nurture him. His path will probably be easier than yours.\u201d\u201cThe path of cultivation depends on oneself! I will enter Archean Mountain this year,\u201d said the thin youth, Mei Yuanzhi. \u201cBesides, you have also given me several pointers over the past few days.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a few pointers. I have to remind you that you are considered the number one genius in Eastcalm Prefecture, but you only have a 20\u201330% chance of entering Archean Mountain.\u201d Palace Lord Jadesun smiled. \u201cIf there are more geniuses this year, your chances of entering Archean Mountain will be even lower. Yuanzhi, you have to make plans. What will you do if you fail?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to think about that now. I\u2019ll decide when I fail,\u201d Mei Yuanzhi said.Palace Lord Jadesun didn\u2019t say anything else. Instead, he stared at the arena with interest. He was willing to give Mei Yuanzhi pointers because he hoped that humanity would produce an additional Godfiend. That meant additional combat strength for the humans. Clearly, he found Meng Chuan someone with potential as well.Meng Chuan had already walked onto the stage.\u201cDemon.\u201d Meng Chuan looked at the goat demon standing on the stage. The goat demon was tall and burly; its arms thick and strong. Its pair of curved horns were long and sharp, and its eyes glinted with green as it stared at Meng Chuan.\u201cHuman, if you are afraid, hurry down,\u201d said the goat demon in a deep voice. \u201cThe two opponents before you\u2014including the sharpshooter\u2014were so frightened that they jumped off the arena.\u201dA goat demon was considered one of the strongest demons amongst the twelve.It was deliberately placed at the end for Meng Chuan to deal with.\u201cAfraid? Do you have what it takes?\u201d Meng Chuan stared at it, his gaze filling with intense killing intent.\u201cChuan\u2019er\u2019s gaze.\u201d Meng Dajiang watched from afar, but his heart skipped a beat. His son was usually friendly and amiable and had never exuded such murderous intent before.\u201cHahaha, you aren\u2019t escaping? I like human punks with guts.\u201d As the goat demon spoke, it immediately rushed over at extreme speeds, producing many afterimages.Meng Chuan glanced at it, but his heart and mind were fully focused on the battle.He was filled with endless killing intent towards these demons.\u201cDie.\u201dComing close, the goat demon roared ferociously as it brandished its claws. Instantly, gray claw shadows streaked across the sky.Now! Meng Chuan\u2019s heart stirred. In an instant, his body, mind, and technique became one!The intense killing intent contained his accumulated hatred for the demons. It made his fusion of body and mind even more perfect, allowing him to utilize strength far greater than usual.Ancient Godfiends had once said that humans had great potential. They could unleash incredible power at critical moments.When Meng Chuan fought demons, he delivered speed and strength far greater than it usually was during normal cultivation or in sparring matches at the Mirror Lake Dao Academy.Pfft.The saber flashed at incredibly fast speeds.It was a soul-stirring strike, one filled with killing intent!The goat demon\u2019s eyes widened. It instinctively felt death approaching and tried its best to block it, but it failed to touch the saber. The saber didn\u2019t travel a straight trajectory, but an ethereal curve. The saber easily passed its arms that were trying its best to fend off the attack and swept past its neck.Whoosh.Meng Chuan\u2019s saber had returned to its scabbard as though it had never moved. The only thing that changed was that he had moved fifty feet.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe goat demon took a few steps forward before falling to the ground. At the same time, its head rolled to the side noisily as blood dyed the ground red.In just one slash!The goat demon was dead!Everyone had witnessed the strength of the goat demon before. It was extremely skilled in combat, and it was difficult for even Mortal Shedding experts to defeat it. Thus, it had easily won two consecutive battles. Yet, it had actually been killed by Meng Chuan with just one strike?Looking at the goat demon\u2019s corpse, Meng Chuan whispered, \u201cYou are the first demon I killed.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A few soldiers simply cleaned the arena.According to the rules of the Demon-Slaying Meet, a Dao Academy disciple could continue fighting against new demons in the arena as long as they won. The Jadesun palace would arrange for stronger demons to fight them as long as they were capable enough.At this moment, another jail wagon was pulled up.Oh?Meng Chuan\u2019s pupils constricted. There was a very thin demon in the cell, but it had a huge build due to its big bones. Though it was sitting cross-legged in the cage, its body appeared massive. Its dark yellow eyes swept across the outside world; its body was covered with dried fur that alternated between black and yellow.Tiger demon? Meng Chuan was alarmed.\u201cIt\u2019s a tiger demon!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually a tiger demon!\u201d the Dao Academy disciples exclaimed. Among the demons, there were many like pig demons and wolf demons. Most of them were ordinary and occasionally produced powerful demons. However, there were very few tiger demons; even the weaker ones were at the level of a greater demon.The official from the Imperial Court laughed loudly and said, \u201cEveryone, this is one of our greater demons at the Demon-Slaying Meet. Furthermore, it\u2019s a tiger demon! Of course, it has been starving for a long time, and its body has become much weaker. Its muscles have also atrophied, leaving it at thirty percent of its peak strength. It will be Meng Chuan\u2019s opponent, and will also be the opponent for Mortal Shedding realm disciples. Everyone, you have to be careful. Even if its strength has been greatly reduced, it is still stronger than you. You must be careful.\u201dBang!The cage door was pulled open. The one-armed man looked at the tiger demon and said coldly, \u201cYou can return to your cell after winning ten consecutive rounds. Furthermore, you will enjoy a month\u2019s worth of food and drink.\u201d\u201cTen rounds?\u201dThe tiger demon slowly walked out of the cage with its body bent. It scanned its surroundings.It could sense a terrifying threat from over ten people in the spectators around the arena. The deans of the eight great Dao Academies, the experts of the five great family clans, the experts from the Imperial Court, Mei Yuanzhi from the Jadesun Palace, the one-armed man, etc. They added up to 18 people. Even at its peak, these terrifying humans were able to kill it the moment they clashed. However, it didn\u2019t know that more than half of Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s powerful experts were present.But of course, the scariest one was the person sitting in the seat of honor.Palace Lord Jadesun sat there, and what it sensed from him felt like a sun! Just releasing a tiny bit of his might was enough to kill it.\u201cMy first opponent is this little fellow?\u201d The tiger demon glanced at Meng Chuan who was on the opposite end of the arena. \u201cHow weak.\u201dTiger demon! Meng Chuan focused intently as the glow in his eyes converged. His killing intent intensified.However, he remained motionless on the spot. This spot was at the edge of the arena. Even if the tiger demon rushed over, it had to be careful that it didn\u2019t leave the arena. Demons were executed the moment they stepped out of the arena!Meng Chuan planned on probing the tiger demon before deciding on a battle plan.Whoosh.The moment the tiger demon pounced on him, it brought the smell of blood with. It arrived in front of him in the blink of an eye.Swoosh.Meng Chuan immediately ducked, slashing out as he retreated. However, the tiger\u2019s claw blocked the attack, causing Meng Chuan to retreat several steps when he landed on the ground.Speed is my forte, but its speed is not inferior to mine. Meng Chuan was secretly stunned. Its strength is twice mine. This is thirty percent of its peak strength? Fortunately, it hasn\u2019t reached the Unity realm, although it\u2019s skilled in combat. I\u2019ll target my enemy\u2019s weaknesses with my strengths.I have a chance of killing it!He instantly made a decision.Ordinary Dao Academy disciples would be nervous when fighting demons for the first time. It would be impressive if they were able to unleash 70% of their full strength. However, Meng Chuan was different. The flames of passion he had suppressed in his heart since he was young erupted when he faced demons. He became more thrilled! He became even more excited and focused. His body and mind worked in perfect concert, allowing the strength he delivered to be even stronger. This was his combat state.He was in a good state, and he was capable of performing exceptionally well.\u201cHe actually managed to dodge? Interesting,\u201d said the tiger demon in a deep voice before it charged forward once more.Meng Chuan took the initiative to meet it by lunging forward. His speed was no less than the tiger demon. Unlike the tiger demon that just charged forward, his movements were more ethereal\u2014like a gust of wind.Their paths crossed.The instant they met, Meng Chuan\u2019s saber silently slashed forward. This strike was the Bizarro Saber Stance of the Falling Leaf Saber, and its crux was to take opponents by surprise.The saber beam slashed across the tiger demon\u2019s abdomen, tearing through its furry hide.\u201cYou injured me?\u201d The tiger demon stopped and touched its abdomen, looking even more ferocious.Meng Chuan only stared at it and shouted, \u201cKill!\u201d before he continued charging forward.Whoosh. Whoosh.They crossed each other again.Meng Chuan didn\u2019t embroil himself with the tiger demon. He relied on his bizarre movement techniques and employed a hit-and-run strategy. He knew very well that if he were to engage in a head-to-head battle, the powerful resilient tiger demon would be able to exchange blows with him. It only suffered minor injuries from each saber strike, but being hit by the tiger demon\u2019s claw would result in severe injuries. It might even lead to death.In the arena, the tiger demon chased after Meng Chuan with a murderous aura as the latter attacked and retreated repeatedly.With every exchange, the tiger demon would be left with a wound on its body.Clearly, Meng Chuan\u2019s saber arts were more brilliant.As its wounds increased in number, the tiger demon\u2019s injuries gradually worsened.Pfft. Another slash swiped across an existing wound on the tiger demon\u2019s lower abdomen, widening the wound three times the size. Blood splattered everywhere, causing the tiger demon to stagger. It stared at the human youth with reddened eyes while Meng Chuan continued staring at it coldly.\u201cHe actually injured the tiger demon seriously.\u201d\u201cWhy do I have the feeling Meng Chuan isn\u2019t someone who recently gained insight into the Unity realm? The might he\u2019s showcasing is even more ferocious.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s very calm. He doesn\u2019t give the tiger demon any chance.\u201dThe upper echelons of the five great family clans, the Dao Academies\u2019 deans, and the experts of the imperial government were all chatting with one another. Clearly, they were quite impressed.\u201cAh Chuan.\u201d Liu Qiyue was extremely nervous. Every clash with the tiger demon made her reel with anxiety. That was a greater demon!Is this Meng Chuan\u2019s pursuit? Yun Qingping\u2019s thoughts drifted as she watched. In her eyes, the silly and wooden Meng Chuan only had cultivation on his mind and was too mild-tempered. She didn\u2019t like that. However, his killing intent was terrifying in the arena today. He had killed the goat demon with a single slash. And he was currently engaged in battle with the tiger demon. Although his killing intent was restrained, it only served to make Meng Chuan appear even more terrifying and ferocious\u2026This was still Meng Chuan!Is this his real side? Yun Qingping felt that she had been wrong in the past. Meng Chuan\u2014who normally looked ordinary\u2014appeared ferocious during intense bouts of blood and steel.Perhaps getting married to him wasn\u2019t bad either.However, what the family clan had done couldn\u2019t be reversed.\u2026The wound on the tiger demon\u2019s abdomen was deep. However, its muscles rapidly contracted to stop the blood from flowing. Even so, the tiger demon\u2019s speed suffered. It glared fiercely at Meng Chuan as it emanated a baleful aura.However, Meng Chuan completely ignored its baleful aura. He was like the calmest hunter that was ready to take its life at any moment.Whoosh.Meng Chuan lunged forward again.\u201cRoar!\u201d As the two sides closed the gap, the tiger demon roared as it charged forward.With a roar, distorted black ripples surged in all directions.The tiger demon\u2019s black and red fur immediately lit up as a golden glow saturated its eyes. Its claws\u2019 might increased tremendously.\u201cOh? It actually has the bloodline of a demon monarch? It has been imprisoned for more than a year, but we didn\u2019t realize it. It really hid itself well.\u201d Seated in the seat of honor, Palace Lord Jadesun was alarmed. Invisible forces enveloped every corner of the arena as he was prepared to interfere at any moment. It was Jadesun Palace\u2019s fault for arranging demons that exceeded their expectations.When the roar hit him, Meng Chuan felt his ears and head ring. Yet, the more critical the moment, the more focused his mind. This allowed him to maintain his lucidity. Facing the mighty claws, he immediately switched to defending. Over the past few years, he had been defending against Qiyue\u2019s archery every single day, so he was extremely skilled in defense.Boom! Meng Chuan felt an incomparably heavy and terrifying force pass through his saber and into his body as he was thrown backward.As he was sent flying backward, Meng Chuan immediately tapped the arena beneath his feet to hasten his speedy retreat.The tiger demon immediately pounced forward. It was a narrow escape for Meng Chuan as it failed to pounce onto him.He immediately retreated from the arena and landed on the ground. He staggered as he used his saber to prop himself up.Pfft. He couldn\u2019t hold back the mouthful of blood that erupted out of his mouth. His face was pale, and blood seeped out from his ears. It was due to the earlier roar.He actually escaped?The tiger demon stared at Meng Chuan below, feeling extremely shocked.In the face of death, it had been forced to reveal its hidden demon monarch bloodline. The Tiger Roar would usually be able to stun an enemy at a critical moment! It would take the opportunity to kill the enemy. However, the human youth was still able to block its attacks despite the bleeding in his ears. He didn\u2019t hesitate to tap the arena to speed up his retreat as he was sent flying backwards. This caused its second pounce to fail.\u201cChuan\u2019er.\u201d Meng Dajian rushed over, and Liu Qiyue was worried as well.\u201cThis Meng Chuan\u2026\u201d Palace Lord Jade Sun\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw this. Many experts might seem to be at a high realm, and their combat techniques were powerful during training. However, when it came to life-and-death battles, it was rather impressive for them to unleash 60 to 70 percent of their full potential. As for how many could exceed their usual standards, that depended on multiple aspects such as their battle intelligence, will, and state of mind. Those who were good at combat were capable of killing three or four opponents in a row even if they were in similar realms with their opponents.\u201cThis is his first time dealing with demons, right?\u201d Palace Lord Jadesun was very satisfied. \u201cI hope he really can become a Godfiend.\u201dMeng Chuan could also feel his hearing gradually recovering. Meng Dajiang used his Quintessential Energy to check on him as he said, \u201cChuan\u2019er, it\u2019s fine. Your ears were damaged from the vibrations. You will recover in a few days.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cYou were very wise to retreat from the arena just now. This tiger demon actually has the bloodline of a demon monarch.\u201d Meng Dajiang said solemnly, \u201cIt will be sent to the State Capital even if it survives since it has been exposed.\u201d\u201cNext\u2026\u201d Suddenly, a voice rang out.Meng Chuan looked over and saw that the speaker was the official from the Imperial Court. The official smiled and said in a loud, clear voice, \u201cJadesun Palace, Yan Jin!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Everyone present was shocked.He wasn\u2019t a disciple from the eight Dao Academies?After Meng Chuan, shouldn\u2019t it be a Mortal Shedding realm disciple from the Dao Academies? Why was it someone from Jadesun Palace?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOur Jadesun Palace has a junior as well. He wishes to give it a try.\u201d Palace Lord Jade Sun smiled as he nodded at the white-robed youth behind him.The white-robed youth rose to his feet and walked towards the arena.\u201cWhat? He\u2019s also in the Marrow Cleansing realm?\u201d There were many experts present. They could naturally determine from the white-robed youth\u2019s aura that he had yet to cultivate a Godfiend body and was still at the Marrow Cleansing realm.\u201cTo deal with the tiger demon at the Marrow Cleansing realm?\u201d Everyone was somewhat astonished.Even Meng Chuan was astonished. He knew how powerful the tiger demon was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16: Yan Jin and Mei YuanzhiCKtalonCKtalonUnder the attention of the five great clans and the eight great Dao Academies, the white-robed youth calmly walked up the arena with his sword on his back. His hands reached behind his back. Inside the scabbard were two swords.He held a sword in each hand and left them pointing askew to the ground as he coldly stared at the tiger demon.\u201cAnother young fellow.\u201d The tiger demon\u2019s face twitched. There was a wound on its face, and more than ten wounds littered its body\u2014the wound on its abdomen was especially large.\u201cKill!\u201d It didn\u2019t wish to delay any further as it charged forward.The white-robed youth charged forward head-on with a sword in each hand.Bang! Bang! Bang!The tiger demon and the white-robed youth, Yan Jin, clashed head-on. Although the tiger demon looked more powerful with greater strength and speed, its advantage seemed limited! The white-robed youth\u2019s two longswords corresponded to Yin and Yang. When one sword was suppressed, power would be accumulated in the other sword before erupting. The stronger the suppression, the stronger the rebound force.They were fighting head-on.The white-robed youth\u2019s sword technique had clearly reached the Unity realm. His technique was brilliant. His sword would occasionally add another wound to the tiger demon.\u201cThe white-robed youth\u2019s sword technique has reached the Unity realm as well. He\u2019s in no way inferior to Meng Chuan.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, he is likely born with tremendous strength. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to match the tiger demon\u2019s strength.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s born with tremendous strength despite looking so young and tender?\u201dEveryone was astonished. Meng Chuan was too.With high population numbers, there were occurrences of special people who were born with tremendous strength or exceptional speed. For example, his fellow disciple\u2014Wan Mang\u2014was born with tremendous strength. His strength at the Marrow Cleansing realm was comparable to someone at the Mortal Shedding realm! However, the majority of those who were born with tremendous strength were very muscular. It was rare to see someone like the mysterious youth\u2014Yan Jin\u2014to be born with tremendous strength while having such a figure.Being at the Unity realm, the white-dressed youth\u2019s body, mind, and technique fused as one. The strength he unleashed was 80 percent of the tiger demon\u2019s! His speed was also 70 to 80 percent of the tiger demon\u2019s. With the addition of his dual sword technique, he was in no way inferior to it at all. The direct clash worsened the tiger demon\u2019s injuries.Roar! The tiger demon roared again as its black and red fur lit up. The might of its claws increased as it once again unleashed the demon monarch bloodline!Boom!There was a loud bang.The white-dressed youth used both his swords to block as he was knocked back several steps from the impact. Blood trickled down the corner of his lips. He forcefully stabilized himself and stared coldly at the tiger demon.He dared to block it head-on? Meng Chuan was somewhat surprised. That\u2019s right. The tiger demon\u2019s demon monarch bloodline can completely crush me, but it\u2019s not that useful when dealing with Yan Jin. Besides, his sword technique is clearly good at deflecting forces.Oh? The tiger demon couldn\u2019t believe it and immediately pounced forward to continue its barrage of attacks.But with a squishing sound\u2026The huge wound at its abdomen could no longer withstand it using its full strength. The wound split open again, and blood splattered everywhere. Even the other wounds on its body began to bleed.Seeing this, the white-robed youth charged forward without any hesitation, continuing his attack with both swords.Damn it. Damn it. If it weren\u2019t for the punk from before dealing this much damage to me\u2026 The tiger demon was infuriated. The other wounds were all superficial, but the wound at its lower abdomen was too deep. Under the explosive power of its bloodline, it couldn\u2019t suppress the wound from being aggravated.If it were in perfect shape, it would be more willing to fight this white-robed kid.Although the white-robed kid was stronger and more ferocious in close combat, it wasn\u2019t afraid of ferociousness.Instead, it was the one who used the saber! He employed hit-and-run tactics! He was extremely slippery, his saber swift and unpredictable. It was how it suffered such serious injuries.Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! The severe injuries prevented it from unleashing the strength of the demon monarch\u2019s bloodline. The tiger demon could only resist with great difficulty, but its strength and speed had clearly weakened. It was completely suppressed by the white-dressed youth as more and more wounds appeared on its body.My fate was determined the day I was captured by that human Godfiend. The tiger demon sensed that its life was coming to an end. When the white-robed kid stabbed out with his final strike, it didn\u2019t resist.Pfft.The sword stabbed into the tiger demon\u2019s glabella and penetrated its head.The tiger demon was dead!It had not been able to fight ten matches in a row, dying in just two rounds. It had even died under the hands of two Marrow Cleansing realm youths.\u201cHe actually killed him\u2026\u201d For a moment, there was utter silence.The white-robed youth retracted his sword and walked down the stage.\u201cJadesun Palace\u2019s Yan Jin, are you not going to continue?\u201d the official from the Imperial Court asked. Logically speaking, as long as they won and stayed in the arena, Jadesun Palace would arrange for even more powerful demons.The white-robed youth didn\u2019t say a word as he walked towards his seat.The Imperial Court official could do nothing.Since he had already left the arena, that meant that he had naturally given up. He immediately waited for the Jadesun Palace soldiers to remove the tiger demon\u2019s corpse and send a new demon over.\u201cOh?\u201dThe seated Meng Chuan noticed that the white-robed youth came to the Mirror Lake Dao Academy seats and stopped. He turned to look at Meng Chuan and coldly said, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t injured it, its speed would have been thirty percent faster. It would have been able to unleash its demon monarch bloodline for a longer period. I would have no choice but to flee.\u201d With that said, he continued walking towards his seat.His voice was a little cold. As he spoke, the dean and six disciples from Mirror Lake Dao Academy remained silent.Yan Jin returned to Palace Lord Jadesun\u2019s side and sat down.\u201cThis person named Yan Jin only spoke once the entire time and it was directed at Senior Brother Meng,\u201d Wan Mang said in surprise.\u201cIndeed. From the arena to his seat, he only said one sentence. He\u2019s really cold.\u201d Bai Guan nodded.Meng Chuan stared curiously at the white-robed youth.He could sense the pride in the white-robed youth\u2019s bones. He appeared to be so cold that he couldn\u2019t be bothered with others. He didn\u2019t even respond to the official\u2019s question, but he had ended up saying such words to Meng Chuan. Clearly, he didn\u2019t want to take advantage of the situation.\u201cThis Yan Jin looks very young, seemingly younger than Meng Chuan?\u201d the Meng family\u2019s clan leader, Meng Yanping, said in a low voice.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look very old,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cHis talent is high, yet he\u2019s still in the Marrow Cleansing realm. He\u2019s probably fifteen-years-old at most.\u201dWith high talent, even if he didn\u2019t have a large family clan behind him, he would still be groomed by the Dao Academy. His cultivation speed wouldn\u2019t be slower in any way.\u201cIt\u2019s beginning,\u201d Clan Leader Meng Yanping said. Another demon had entered the arena.\u201cThis is also a greater demon. However, it\u2019s only an ox demon. It looks like Palace Lord Jadesun specially prepared the tiger demon for Chuan\u2019er,\u201d Meng Dajiang said with a smile. Tiger demons were rarer and all-rounded, with almost no weaknesses. If not for the long-term starvation that led to a decrease in strength, both Meng Chuan and Yan Jin wouldn\u2019t be qualified to fight a tiger demon that was a greater demon.\u2026The disciples of the eight great Dao Academies went up the arena one after another.Disciples at the Mortal Shedding realm were generally older. The youngest disciples were 16 years old and the oldest ones were 20 years old. They wouldn\u2019t be at the Dao Academies if they were any older. They would be serving in the military!According to any Dao Academy\u2019s rules, those at the Marrow Cleansing realm could only cultivate there to the age of 18. 20 for those at the Mortal Shedding realm. As for the Seamless realm? As long as one attained the Seamless realm, they would leave the Dao Academy as it no longer had anything to teach them.The battles continued. In the blink of an eye, it was noon.The Mortal Shedding realm disciples had also finished their battles.The 24 disciples at the Mortal Shedding realm were generally much more powerful. Three of them had figured out the secret technique, and these three had Mortal Shedding realm foundations. They were even more powerful than Meng Chuan and Yan Jin! Thus, the battles were even more exciting. However, the three disciples who had figured out the secret techniques were inferior to the duo in terms of potential. Two had figured out the secret technique at eighteen-years-old, while the other had figured out the secret technique at the age of nineteen. Their chances of becoming Godfiends were much lower than the duo.Meng Chuan\u2019s father\u2014Meng Dajiang\u2014and another member of the Meng family\u2014Meng Zhu\u2014had comprehended the secret technique when they were nineteen. Similarly, their chances of becoming Godfiends were slim.Presently, the person with the highest talent amongst the Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s younger generation was Mei Yuanzhi\u2014who had figured out \u201cForce.\u201dThe second was Meng Chuan!Ranked behind them were the three Mortal Shedding realm fighters who had comprehended the secret technique.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOf course, the white-robed youth\u2014Yan Jin\u2014was also on par with Meng Chuan. In fact, he was even more outstanding. But, he was likely to be a foreigner. Otherwise, it was impossible for the five Godfiend family clans to never hear of him.\u201cAll the disciples of the eight Dao Academies have had their battles,\u201d the official from the Imperial Court said loudly, his voice echoing throughout the area. \u201cNext up is the final demon-slaying battle.\u201d\u201cFinal battle?\u201d Everyone was astonished. Even Meng Chuan listened carefully. He thought that it was over.The official from the Imperial Court continued with a smile. \u201cThe last battle will pit Mei Yuanzhi against a centipede greater demon that has condensed a demon core.\u201dMei Yuanzhi? I never expected him to be fighting today. Meng Chuan\u2019s eyes lit up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They esspecially found him a greater demon that has condensed a demon core to battle.\u201d Yun Fucheng chuckled softly. \u201cIt\u2019s probably because they hope Mei Yuanzhi will be able to make use of this battle to improve further, improving his chances of entering Archean Mountain.\u201d\u201cBrother, do you think Mei Yuanzhi can enter Archean Mountain?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an asked. \u201cIf he enters Archean Mountain and becomes a Godfiend, he might outshine our Yun family.\u201dIn the entire Eastcalm Prefecture, only the Zhang family\u2019s Patriarch was a Godfiend from Archean Mountain.If there was an additional one?\u201cEnter Archean Mountain? Do you think it\u2019s that easy to enter?\u201d Yun Fucheng asked softly. \u201cIn the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s 23 states, there are only twenty spots. Additionally, the descendants of powerful Godfiends from the imperial capital and the state capitals all want to enter too. It\u2019s much harder for a commoner genius to enter Archean Mountain compared to those powerful Godfiend descendants.\u201d\u201cWhat about Meng Chuan?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an couldn\u2019t help but ask. \u201cFairy Meng will definitely help Meng Chuan with all she has.\u201d\u201cFairy Meng is nothing.\u201d Yun Fucheng shook his head gently. He enveloped the area with his energy to isolate their conversation. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even enter Archean Mountain. Even father\u2019s greatest goal was to enter Archean Mountain.\u201dYun Fu\u2019an nodded.Whether one entered Archean Mountain was a demarcating line that differentiated the strength of Godfiends.As long as they were strong enough, they would be invited by Archean Mountain.\u201cAs for Mei Yuanzhi, he figured out Ice Force too late. There\u2019s only a 20\u201330% chance of entering Archean Mountain,\u201d Yun Fucheng said. \u201cI understand his temper. He\u2019s quite arrogant. Even if he becomes a Godfiend of Archean Mountain, he wouldn\u2019t be willing to remain in Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201dIn this world\u2014other than those who were shackled by their large family clans\u2014the truly talented commoners who had no attachments would rather settle down in the state capitals, imperial capital, or even move their families to the Archean Mountain region.\u2026Everyone was discussing Mei Yuanzhi.Many people felt that Mei Yuanzhi\u2019s chances of entering Archean Mountain were slim, but everyone knew he had a chance at least. That was already very impressive.\u201cBe careful,\u201d instructed Palace Lord Jadesun.\u201cOkay.\u201d The skinny Mei Yuanzhi stood up and walked towards the arena.When he arrived in the arena, he faced a demon with a black carapace covering its body. It had a woman\u2019s face and six armored arms. It also had a sharp black tail that was particularly eye-catching. It looked at Mei Yuanzhi with a faint smile, its voice very gentle. \u201cVery young fellow. I can sense your vigorous vitality.\u201dMei Yuanzhi drew his sword and a terrifying chill condensed. At that moment, Mei Yuanzhi was like an ice mountain as his might constantly increased. Even the cold air that he gradually released caused the entire arena to produce frost.\u201cIce Force?\u201d The centipede demoness smiled. \u201cBut it looks like you only figured it out recently.\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d A cold glint flashed across Mei Yuanzhi\u2019s eyes.His body instantly split into seven. Seven figures appeared in different spots, surrounding the centipede demon as each slashed out a sword beam.Seven sword beams cleaved at the centipede demon in the middle.The centipede demon stood there motionless. \u201cYou are dispensing that tiny bit of power?\u201d Her six arms struck out in every direction, producing a series of thunderous booms. The centipede demon\u2019s hands were white, but they were incomparably tough. She shattered each sword beam to pieces.Pfft.Mei Yuanzhi\u2019s true body suddenly appeared in front of the centipede demon. He thrust his sword towards the centipede demon\u2019s head. It was bizarre, but it was faster and more terrifying than the seven sword beams earlier.\u201cOh?\u201d The centipede demon was shocked. Two of its hands forcefully clasped the sword.It stared at Mei Yuanzhi and grinned. \u201cSo the seven sword beams were purposely used as a distraction. This is the actual killer move?\u201dShatter! Mei Yuanzhi\u2019s eyes flashed fiercely.The sword in the centipede demon\u2019s hands suddenly exploded and the sharp sword shards shot out as they were boosted by Quintessential Energy. The shards hit the centipede demon\u2019s face, causing it to let out an anguished howl.A layer of ice formed on the surface of Mei Yuanzhi\u2019s palms as he struck the centipede demon\u2019s chest.Boom! The centipede demon was sent flying.This is the real killer move! Mei Yuanzhi\u2019s eyes were cold. He knew very well that he was a little weaker compared to the centipede demon that had condensed a demon core. Thus, the first thing he did was give it his all. People knew he was skilled in sword arts. But after he had figured out Ice Force, it made no difference using Ice Force with a sword art or a fist art. The sword wasn\u2019t important to him; it was just used as a distraction.The centipede demon\u2019s face was covered in blood as its chest caved in. It let out an angry howl as it flew backward. \u201cHumans are truly sinister! Die!!!\u201d The raging centipede demon\u2019s aura expanded rapidly as its demon core shattered. Its demonic energy was instantly boosted to a new extreme.\u201cDie!!!\u201dThe centipede demon struck out simultaneously with its six palms but strangely ended up striking the two Dao Academies closest to it\u2014the Blazing Sun Academy and the Wind Center Dao Academy.Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!In an instant, hundreds of black beams shot out from the six palms, shooting towards the two Dao Academies\u2019 seats. The centipede demon\u2019s tail expanded and its extremely sharp stinger flailed about\u2014instantly stabbing at Mei Yuanzhi who was still shocked.\u201cNot good.\u201d\u201cBe careful.\u201dEveryone was in a panic.The two deans of Blazing Sun Dao Academy and Wind Center Dao Academy were both shocked and furious. The twelve disciples were even more terrified.We won\u2019t be able to hold it off. The two deans faced hundreds of black beams. It would already be a blessing if they could save a disciple or two while protecting themselves. There was no way they could save everyone.\u201cQiyue!\u201d Meng Chuan was alarmed as well. Despite being spectators, danger had befallen them suddenly. The centipede demon had attacked the spectating Dao Academy disciples?\u201cImmobilize!\u201d The seated Palace Lord Jadesun frowned slightly as he softly commanded.The surrounding void trembled.The hundreds of black beams that were faster than arrows were completely obliterated.The centipede demon lost control of itself as it was hoisted into the air. Unable to move a single inch of its body, it disbelievingly stared at Palace Lord Jadesun\u2014who was sitting on the seat of honor. \u201cImpossible. There\u2019s no way you can stop a strike after I shattered my demon core from such a distance\u2026\u201d\u201cNothing is impossible.\u201dPalace Lord Jadesun stood up and took two steps before reaching the arena. He looked at the centipede demon that was completely frozen and unable to fight back. \u201cI never expected that you would actually have the guts to shatter your demon core and even attempt to kill us humans.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201d The centipede demon let out a shrill laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t you humans want to use me to hone your young geniuses? How can I grant your wishes? Not only that, but I\u2019ll also kill your juniors. The more I kill, the better. Unfortunately, I failed in the end. None of them were killed. Cough, cough\u2014\u201dThe corner of its mouth was stained with green blood. It couldn\u2019t live for long after shattering its demon core.\u201cJust wait. The entire world will ultimately belong to demons. When that happens, all of you humans will die. All of you will\u2014\u201d The centipede demoness shouted hysterically.Pfft.The centipede demon was instantly diced by invisible threads, turning into a pool of black-green blood.\u201cWhat a joke.\u201d Palace Lord Jadesun scoffed before turning to look at Mei Yuanzhi who was still in a daze. He hadn\u2019t expected the centipede demon to deliberately take his blow and use the impact to approach the Dao Academy disciples and attempt to kill them. The centipede had never intended to fight him from the beginning.\u201cDeploying such a greater demon with a condensed core\u2026 It\u2019s not like greater demons are obedient. Alright, you may leave,\u201d instructed Palace Lord Jadesun.\u201cYes.\u201d Mei Yuanzhi nodded.Palace Lord Jadesun stood alone in the arena as he looked at the various factions.The spectators felt lingering fear in their hearts. The centipede demon\u2019s suicide attack by shattering its demon core was too terrifying.\u201cSince I dared to arrange for a greater demon to enter the arena, there won\u2019t be any slip-ups,\u201d said Palace Lord Jadesun indifferently. \u201cThis Demon-Slaying Meet is over!\u201dWith that said, Palace Lord Jadesun turned and left. In just a few steps, he vanished from everyone\u2019s sight.\u201cEveryone.\u201dAt that moment, the magistrate stood up and said with a smile, \u201cEveryone must have been shocked just now. However, with the Palace Lord around, the greater demon that condensed a demon core is nothing but a clown! The disciples of the eight Dao Academies have also seen how powerful the demons are at today\u2019s Demon-Slaying Meet. These demons are chained and have suffered in prison. They are unable to utilize their peak strength. Therefore, when you enter the battlefield, your opponents will be even more terrifying even if you have companions. Therefore, Dao Academy disciples, you must cultivate more diligently. In the future, you will be able to protect yourself on the battlefield and kill more demons.\u201d\u2026The Demon-Slaying Meet was over.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEverything the centipede demon did had left the Dao Academy disciples astounded. Of course, Palace Lord Jadesun\u2019s incredible strength made them yearn for it. The centipede demon was as weak as an ant in front of the Palace Lord.\u201cAmazing. Ah Chuan, did you see it? Hundreds of black beams of light were shattered, and the centipede demon was lifted up, unable to move in midair at all.\u201d Liu Qiyue was still very excited on the way home. \u201cFrom beginning to end, I didn\u2019t even see Palace Lord Jadesun attack. Just a tiny amount of his energy was already so terrifying.\u201d\u201cQiyue, you were almost killed by the centipede demon, yet you are still so excited,\u201d said Meng Chuan helplessly.\u201cDon\u2019t you think the Palace Lord is very strong?\u201d asked Liu Qiyue immediately.\u201cThat\u2019s a Godfiend that came from Archean Mountain. How can he not be strong?\u201d An eagerness arose in Meng Chuan\u2019s eyes. He had always dreamt of becoming a Godfiend.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His entire body was like a gust of wind amidst flashing saber beams. He completed an entire set in the blink of an eye. He walked to the stone bench and sat down, lost in thought.He recalled his conversation with Dean Ge Yu yesterday.\u201cDean, after I figured out the secret technique, my Falling Leaf Saber reached a perfected state. There\u2019s no more room for improvement. How should I continue my cultivation to figure out Saber Force?\u201d\u201cMeng Chuan, the more you cultivate saber arts, the more you will have to rely on yourself. What I can teach you is limited,\u201d Ge Yu said with a smile as he drank his alcohol. \u201cI can only tell you how I figured out Force. Back when I was on the battlefield in Qinyang Pass, I faced demons in life-and-death battles. I began to find my saber arts rather burdensome, so I gradually modified my saber arts.\u201d\u201cI used whatever killed demons the easiest. After my military service, I requested to remain at Qinyang Pass and spent twelve years there. One day, my self-created saber arts reached perfection, and I figured out Saber Force,\u201d said Ge Yu.\u201cA self-created saber art?\u201d Meng Chuan was astonished.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Ge Yu smiled as he drank his alcohol. \u201cOnce you cultivate a top-notch saber art to perfection, you will be able to comprehend the secret technique and reach the Unity realm. You will be able to figure out Saber Force if you create a top-notch technique you can call your own.\u201d\u201cDean, what kind of saber art did you create? Can I have a look?\u201d Meng Chuan asked curiously.\u201cHaha, feast your eyes.\u201d At the time, the half-drunk Ge Yu grew excited as he began to showcase his saber art.His saber arts were more sinister, more bizarre, and even more ferocious.Ge Yu was thin, but he had a long saber. He was like a mandrel brandishing its saber. Saber flashes surrounded him as if every part of his body could produce saber flashes. The courtyard became much colder; countless leaves tore apart and fluttered under the saber beam. Meng Chuan felt his heart chill when seeing the sinister and bizarre saber art.This was just a demonstration\u2014one that didn\u2019t involve killing enemies with all his might. It was probably ten times more powerful when it came to killing enemies.This was Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s swiftest saber.\u201cThis saber art isn\u2019t suitable for you.\u201d Ge Yu swung his saber and stabbed it into the scabbard hanging by his side. He smiled and said, \u201cThis is the most suitable saber art for me. I\u2019m small-sized and skinny, but my arms are quite long. This saber art is suitable for my build. For ordinary people like you, it\u2019s best to cultivate the Falling Leaf Saber. The Falling Leaf Saber was created by a Godfiend from Archean Mountain, so it\u2019s the most suitable to build a foundation with.\u201d\u201cThe Mirror Lake Dao Academy doesn\u2019t have much left to teach you since you\u2019ve perfected the Falling Leaf Saber. You\u2019ll need to rely on yourself,\u201d said Ge Yu with a smile. \u201cAs a dean, I don\u2019t have any other extravagant wishes. I just want to produce a Archean Mountain Godfiend in my life. Haha, then I\u2014Ge Yu\u2014will be able to brag for the rest of my life.\u201d\u2026Meng Chuan contemplated as he recalled the conversation.\u201cChuan\u2019er.\u201d Meng Dajiang came to the training grounds.\u201cDad.\u201d Meng Chuan stood up.\u201cCome, follow me to the ancestral mansion to meet your grandaunt,\u201d Meng Dajiang said.Meng Chuan jolted. \u201cGrandaunt\u2026 Dad, are you referring to\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, the Fairy,\u201d said Meng Dajiang softly.Meng Chuan\u2019s eyes lit up. This was the Meng family\u2019s pride and joy\u2014a pillar of support for the Meng family! The second Godfiend in the Meng family\u2019s history!\u201cDad, let\u2019s go!\u201d Meng Chuan was extremely excited and couldn\u2019t wait to see his grandaunt.\u2026In the ancestral mansion, Fairy Meng\u2019s residence looked ordinary. All it did was take up an area that was slightly larger than other ordinary yards in the ancestral mansion.\u201cFollow me in.\u201d Meng Dajiang led Meng Chuan into the courtyard carefully, not daring to make any loud noises.In the courtyard, an old woman with her walking stick was watching a peach tree blossom. She carefully looked at the flowers that had just bloomed.Meng Chuan carefully observed.The old woman was very quiet when she observed the peach blossoms, as though she had become one with the world. If one closed their eyes, one wouldn\u2019t be able to sense the old lady\u2019s existence. Meng Chuan understood that this old lady was likely Fairy Meng\u2014his grandaunt.\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d Fairy Meng turned her head and smiled at the father and son duo.\u201cQuick, greet your grandaunt.\u201d Meng Dajiang urged softly.Only then did Meng Chuan rush forward. He knelt and kowtowed. \u201cGreetings, Grandaunt.\u201d\u201cQuickly get up.\u201d Fairy Meng sat down. \u201cBoth of you can sit down.\u201dOnly then did Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan sit to the side.Meng Chuan was very curious about his grandaunt. He carefully observed her appearance. She had to be very beautiful when she was young. Unbeknownst to him, Fairy Meng looked like a mortal in her thirties or forties before her injury.\u201cMeng Chuan, come here. Come closer to me,\u201d said Fairy Meng gently.Meng Chuan immediately sat on a nearby chair.Fairy Meng held Meng Chuan\u2019s hand and looked at him. The more she looked at him, the more fond she became of him. This was the Meng family\u2019s hope!\u201cMeng Chuan, you should be at the perfected Marrow Cleansing realm in another two or three months, right?\u201d asked Fairy Meng.\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cFoundation Establishment, Body Tempering, Marrow Cleansing. All of them only forge your foundation. It allows one to cultivate their bodies to perfection,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cWhen one is at the Mortal Shedding realm, they will begin to shed their mortal coils, cultivate Godfiend bodies, and gradually possess the power of Godfiends. This is a change in life\u2019s natural order. It\u2019s akin to ants transforming into tigers or leopards. We will slowly transform from mortals to Godfiends.\u201d\u201cThe first step in the transformation is the Mortal Shedding realm.\u201d\u201cThis step is especially important. At this stage, one can create an extremely robust Godfiend foundation as long as sufficient valuable treasures are provided..\u201d\u201cA Godfiend foundation?\u201d Meng Chuan was stunned.\u201cThe growth of a fetus in their mother\u2019s womb is very important,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cSome ancient Godfiend family clans would have pregnant women consume all kinds of valuable treasures. Once born, their children will far exceed their peers.\u201d\u201cThe Mortal Shedding realm is akin to a Godfiend fetus\u2019 growth,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cIt can change one\u2019s talent at the most critical moment. I\u2019ve already used up all the treasures our family saved up over the years to exchange for a drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid. When you begin cultivating a Godfiend body, you can immediately consume it. That will allow you to set up a strong foundation. The strength of your body and the purity of your Quintessential Energy will far exceed your peers.\u201d\u201cGodfiend Jade Marrow Liquid?\u201d Meng Dajiang was shocked. \u201cThis\u2026 Aunt, by doing this\u2026\u201d Perhaps more than half the Meng family\u2019s savings had been spent.This matter hadn\u2019t been discussed with the clan leader and Elders. After all, Meng Dajiang hadn\u2019t known.\u201cThis is my decision, and I\u2019ve already done it,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cA Godfiend\u2019s foundation is very important. If you miss the earliest period during the Mortal Shedding realm, no amount of treasures in the future can change the foundation. It\u2019s worth expending all our family\u2019s resources for this drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid!\u201dMeng Chuan suddenly felt immense pressure.Why is Grandaunt putting all her effort into this? To exchange all the family clan\u2019s treasures for a single drop of a Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid, and it\u2019s for me? The family clan has always maintained fair rules. I have only figured out the secret technique. Whether I become a Godfiend is still unknown. Why is the family grooming me to such an extent?\u201cMeng Chuan.\u201d Fairy Meng smiled as she looked at this child that shared her blood. She could tell that he was feeling uneasy. \u201cI\u2019m severely injured and can only live another seven to eight years. Therefore, I can\u2019t afford to wait any longer. I have to do my best to groom you.\u201dMeng Chuan was stunned.The pillar of the family clan can only live for another seven to eight years?Fairy Meng continued, \u201cNot only did I exchange a drop of the Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid for you, all the credit I accumulated with Archean Mountain by battling with demons for 80 years will be transferred to you as long as you achieve Saber Force before twenty years of age.\u201d\u201cAunt, this credit was accumulated by you over so many years,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s worth it as long as the family clan can produce another Godfiend.\u201d Fairy Meng looked at Meng Chuan. \u201cMeng Chuan, you are our family\u2019s only hope. I have a feeling that you can shoulder all of this.\u201dWhen Meng Chuan was six, he experienced a calamity. His temperament was extraordinary, so he quickly accepted it. He nodded and said, \u201cGrandaunt, I don\u2019t know if I can become a Godfiend, but I will do everything I can!\u201d\u201cTo still be calm at this moment.\u201d Fairy Meng smiled and nodded. \u201cVery good. You didn\u2019t disappoint me.\u201dMeng Dajiang felt a little nervous.\u201cDajiang.\u201d Fairy Meng said, \u201cPerhaps you might not agree with how I\u2019m telling Meng Chuan everything and betting everything on him. But to become a Godfiend, how can one not have a strong fortitude? You have to believe in your son. Meng Chuan is stronger than you think.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He understood. Although his son was still young, it was indeed time for him to be independent.\u201cBefore Meng Chuan cultivates a Godfiend body, bring him to me to get the Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid.\u201d Fairy Meng exhorted.\u201cYes,\u201d replied Meng Dajiang.That drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid was incomparably precious.Even for geniuses from some ancient Godfiend family clans in the imperial capital, they were unable to obtain a drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid to forge their Godfiend foundation. Generally speaking, only one-in-a-century geniuses would receive intense grooming by an ancient Godfiend family clan. For Godfiend family clans with limited heritage, how could they possibly bet everything on one child like the Meng family?\u201cMeng Chuan, you can ask me if you have any questions regarding your cultivation,\u201d said Fairy Meng with a smile. \u201cYou can also talk to me if you encounter any trouble.\u201d\u201cGrandaunt.\u201d Meng Chuan immediately said, \u201cI do have something I am rather perplexed about.\u201d\u201cLet me guess. How do you reach the next stage for saber arts?\u201d said Fairy Meng with a smile.\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve asked the dean at the Dao Academy. He only said that he figured out Saber Force by creating a top-notch saber art.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s indeed a method.\u201d Fairy Meng nodded as she looked at Meng Dajiang. \u201cDajiang, how did you break through?\u201dMeng Dajiang was taken aback as he reminisced. He said, \u201cBack when I served in the military, each member of a team was delegated with particular tasks. I was responsible for holding back demons. Therefore, I mainly cultivated three saber moves. I stayed at Qinyang Pass for ten years. I later returned to our hometown and traveled the surrounding prefectures along the way. I happened to encounter a battle between a woman and a demon.\u201dMeng Dajiang looked at Meng Chuan and smiled. \u201cThat was your mother.\u201dMeng Chuan\u2019s heart trembled. Mom?\u201cYour mother was very pretty. I will never forget your mother\u2019s figure fighting demons under the sun. Pumped with energy back then, I rushed forward without any thought and used my saber art to easily hold back demons. My saber art felt especially ethereal and extremely easy. I actually figured out Saber Force just like that,\u201d said Meng Dajiang with a smile. \u201cThe first time I met your mother was the day I figured out Saber Force. How coincidental.\u201d\u201cDajiang accumulated ten years of experience on the battlefield before breaking through that very day,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cDajiang simply cultivated three moves, while the Mirror Lake Dao Academy dean created a top-notch saber art. Your dean focused on breadth, and Dajiang focused on depth. Neither one is better. In fact, when it comes to holding back enemies, your father is better.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded as well. \u201cI\u2019ve read Godfiend biographies. Regarding Godfiend Deng Feng, he trained his saber alone in the deep mountains. He drew his saber ten thousand times every day, for twenty years. The moment he left the mountain, he killed a Seamless realm cultivator in one strike while being at the Marrow Cleansing realm.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. To be able to achieve that feat, that one strike would have exceeded the realm of Saber Force. He is a perfect example of depth, just that his talent is much higher than your father\u2019s. That saber strike was so stunning he was directly recruited by Archean Mountain. There\u2019s no need for him to go through a test,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cHowever, having no guidance meant a fatal flaw in his saber arts\u2014he only knew a single move! If others understood him completely and targeted his weaknesses, he would have been in trouble. Of course, he was recruited by Archean Mountain the moment he showed the tip of the iceberg, so he quickly fixed that weakness. He became even more powerful, becoming truly invincible in that era.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded slightly.\u201cI spent a long time at Calm Sea Pass and received guidance from King Calm Sea,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to estimate how strong King Calm Sea is; he has an extremely high status in Archean Mountain. In terms of strength, he is definitely not inferior to the Godfiend Deng Feng that you mentioned.\u201dMeng Chuan obviously knew that King Calm Sea was very powerful.In Eastcalm Prefecture, ordinary mortals would go to Qinyang Pass for military service! As for the Godfiends of Eastcalm Prefecture, most of them went to Calm Sea Pass. The commander at Calm Sea Pass was King Calm Sea. Even the imperial family of the Great Zhou Dynasty respected him greatly, directly conferring him the title of king.\u201cKing Calm Sea once told me\u201d\u2014Fairy Meng looked at Meng Chuan and continued\u2014\u201dthat cultivation requires one to follow one\u2019s intuition and follow what one likes the most before forging forward. You will go further and further. When you look back after a few decades, you would\u2019ve far surpassed your former self. I\u2019ll share this saying with you as well. Follow your heart and proceed down what you like the most.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u2026Meng Chuan returned to the Mirror Lake Meng Manor training grounds. He ate some fruit alone as he sat there, contemplating.King Calm Sea\u2019s words of advice to my grandaunt and the fourth commandment out of the nine commandments I figured out\u2014\u201dNovice and Grandmaster\u201d\u2014share some similarities, Meng Chuan mused to himself. Since I\u2019ve to follow my intuition and do what my heart desires, I\u2019ll be able to put more heart into cultivation and enjoy it. This will deepen my love for it. I\u2019ll even have a chance of becoming a grandmaster.After listening to the dean, Dad, and Grandaunt, I know how I should be cultivating next by following the nine cultivation commandments. Meng Chuan already had an idea. However, he still had to listen to his seniors who had achieved Force for validation.Sixth of the nine cultivation commandments: Turn what you learn into a system. This way, there will not be any fatal flaws. What decides the life and death of an expert typically depends on his most fatal weakness! As long as he has a clear weakness, it would be targeted in the future. If he is restrained, he will lose his life! One failure will be equivalent to losing your life despite the hundred victories gained from using one skill to eat your fill.Godfiend Deng Feng was only good with one move! Grandaunt also said that Godfiend Deng Feng had a fatal flaw. Fortunately, he was immediately recruited into Archean Mountain which made up for his shortcomings.As a saber user, there are only three aspects\u2014killing enemies, defense, and escaping. These three moves form a system. Next, I\u2019ll focus on these three paths.Fifth commandment: Progress in the day, change over the months, success would ultimately come.The ancients once said, \u201cPiling up small quantities of earth daily, you can create a mountain with time. The mountain makes wind possible, which in turn brings in the rain. Channeling small streams and connecting them, you can create a lake\u2014which in turn will bring about aquatic life. Continuously doing good deeds for people and being kind to them\u2014no matter how small each deed may be\u2014you\u2019ll have cultivated the heart of a saint. Take a few steps every day and you\u2019ll finish a journey of a thousand miles. The ocean is but an amalgamation of rivers. The mythical unicorn can\u2019t reach heaven in one leap. An old horse that does not cease running will bring you home. If you give up, you won\u2019t even break a piece of rotten wood. Persevering will allow one to carve gold into shape. Earthworms have no bones and claws but they can go up and down the earth. Hermit crabs\u2014with their six legs and two pincers\u2014can\u2019t even make their own homes without taking over holes already made by snakes and eels.\u201dBut there is a fatal flaw.Even if progress is made daily, if one walks a huge circle, they will still end up in the same spot! Walking the wrong direction will not bring me to the destination a thousand miles away.It\u2019s the same for cultivation as well\u2026 If there\u2019s no clear direction, and all one does is cultivate, it\u2019s very likely to be led astray. It\u2019s also possible that I\u2019ll just be going in circles. Even if it takes ten or twenty years, nothing will come out of it. This is also one of the reasons why Godfiend Deng Feng\u2019s cultivation in most saber arts failed.Many juniors diligently cultivated saber arts like Godfiend Deng Feng! However, many of them met with failure\u2014most giving up midway! That was because they had the guidance of their Dao Academies and the guidance of their elders. Who could ignore the interference from the outside world and waste eight hours every day to practice a single move?Even if one really ignored all disturbances and cultivated only one move, it would be normal to end up going astray.Of course, there were also successful cases. That led to the saying, \u201cone skill to eat your fill.\u201dI need a clear direction to ensure I\u2019m progressing. By heading forward without any turns or detours, I\u2019ll go further every day. In the end, I\u2019ll be able to truly reach my destination a thousand miles away.Why do I like the swift saber? It\u2019s because it\u2019s fast! So the direction I can confirm is speed!\u2026Training grounds.\u201cYoung Master, shall I begin?\u201d A guard stood on a tree branch with a crossbow aimed at the ground.\u201cBegin.\u201d Meng Chuan stood still.Swoosh.The guard pulled the trigger and an arrow immediately shot downwards.Meng Chuan instantly drew his saber and slashed out.Pfft!The flying arrow was sliced into two and a saber beam cut across the thick tree, leaving a mark on it.As long as the mark left on the tree by the saber beam continues moving upwards, it will mean that my saber is getting faster. I will be able to slice the flying arrow in half earlier!Killing enemies, defense, and escaping.He only practiced a single move for killing. Following his intuition and what he liked the most, he chose the Saber Drawing Stance! He enjoyed the silence when he drew his sword and the hum when it sliced through the wind! Such a saber move was so beautiful that he was enamored by it every single time. He found the sound of wind being sliced through more pleasant the faster he drew his saber.He only practiced one move in pursuit of speed!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSpeed. He liked it since he was young.The faster the better.Swish. The guard on the tree shot another arrow again. The advantage of crossbows was that their shots were stable. Each arrow\u2019s speed could be guaranteed to be uniform! Only by doing so would Meng Chuan be able to confirm that the speed of his saber was increasing. Not only was he pursuing speed, but also accuracy. In that split second, he needed to split the flying arrows with one strike.Every day, Meng Chuan cultivated the first stance\u2014Saber Drawing Stance! He would draw his saber and strike the flying arrows for six hours, nearly eight thousand times.The Saber Drawing Stance originated from the Falling Leaf Saber\u2019s Saber Drawing Stance. It was part of the syllabus decided by Archean Mountain for all of the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s Dao Academies because its moves were perfect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These crossbows were rather intricate, allowing for ten arrows to be loaded at a time.Fortunately, the flying arrows were easy to make. Every flying arrow was the length of a palm, and the wooden shaft came equipped with arrowheads. Every day, Meng Chuan needed to snap eight thousand flying arrows, so the craftsmen needed to create enough wooden shafts and install arrowheads on them quickly.\u201cHurry up.\u201dEvery day, the servants would send a bunch of arrows to a workshop.The workshop arranged for ten apprentices to be in charge of making the wooden shafts and installing the arrowheads. According to Meng Chuan\u2019s orders, these wooden shafts needed a red dot imprinted on them! When the time came, he would draw his saber and slice the red dot on the wooden shaft. It wasn\u2019t difficult making wooden shafts other than it being time-consuming. Over time, those crossbows would have to be maintained and even changed.Whoosh.Standing there, Meng Chuan instantly drew his saber. With a saber flash, he split a phantom-like flying arrow. It hit the wooden shaft\u2019s red dot! The remnants of the saber flash landed on the tree trunk that was wrapped in metal, leaving a mark.I need to be faster. He sought speed with every slash.His physical body, Quintessential Energy, and saber art fused. Under his mind\u2019s intense desire, he constantly excavated his potential as he constantly pursued higher speed.A person\u2019s body had immense potential. The more potential one excavated, the greater the power one could unleash. Cultivating through repeated practice was more effective than just visualization. During the process of striking out repetitively, his body, Quintessential Energy, and saber art began to meld into one, becoming more tightly bound together.Although the improvement was very subtle, Meng Chuan could tell that he had improved from the marks left on the tree\u2019s metal skin.The traces left by the saber beam would slowly move up every day. Even the slightest improvement delighted him. He knew he was improving! His saber arts were getting faster!I have to be more accurate and faster. Meng Chuan\u2019s form of cultivation was extravagant, but the few Seamless realm cultivators who were supposed to be his sparring partners were no longer needed. The amount of money spent every month ended up reducing a little. The cost of hiring a few Seamless realm cultivators was too high.The present Meng Chuan had already figured out the secret technique. The few Seamless realm experts who had figured out the secret technique were of little help to him.\u2026The second focus of his daily cultivation were movement techniques and defensive saber arts!\u201cFire!\u201d A servant ordered.Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!Ten Marrow Cleansing guards and two Mortal Shedding guards simultaneously fired their arrows! The arrow shafts were made from Scarletblood Blackiron, but there were no arrowheads. The arrowheads were covered with cloth.When the twelve arrows shot out from a hundred feet away, the force delivered by a Marrow Cleansing guard reached 500 kilograms of force. Needless to say, the Mortal Shedding guards delivered even greater strength. It was obvious how fast the arrows were. As a dense cluster of arrows shot over, Meng Chuan was to use a movement technique to dodge as best as he could while using his saber arts to block them.\u201cFire.\u201d The first unit of guards all retreated. The second unit of guards also included ten at the Marrow Cleansing realm and two at the Mortal Shedding realm. They released their arrows as well.\u201cFire.\u201d Soon, a third unit\u2014consisting of the same makeup as the first two\u2014fired simultaneously.The three units took turns! After the third unit finished, the first unit would be ready.One unit after another, each volley was released in unison! And each time, two arrows came from Mortal Shedding realm guards. The two arrows were faster and more powerful! They posed a huge threat due to the short distance. Under the hail of arrows, Meng Chuan would occasionally be hit.He, too, would fatigue and tire.But he had to persevere. The more exhausted he was, the more determination he needed.By tempering one\u2019s body and mind as one, the fusion of body and mind would be deeper\u2014this allowed his movement techniques to be even faster! It would be even more agile! This also sped up his saber defenses!This form of training required a total of thirty Marrow Cleansing realm guards and six Mortal Shedding realm guards to aid him. This lasted an hour each day.Shooting arrows continuously for an hour exhausted the guards despite having rotations. Meng Chuan also reached his limit.\u2026When it was late at night, Meng Chuan\u2014who would have fully recovered his Quintessential Energy\u2014would undergo his final training for the day\u2014Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance!Meng Chuan stood there alone without moving.Suddenly\u2014His body transformed into a phantom, and he instantly traveled a hundred feet and sent out a saber beam. This time, his movement technique was even fast, and his slashes were even faster! He was much faster than he was during the day.Why were his movement technique and saber art faster?This was because the Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance released with the maximum amount of Quintessential Energy! He would feel swelling and pain from reaching the limits of his meridians. If he circulated additional Quintessential Energy into his meridians, he was sure they would suffer damage. By pushing himself to the limits, his movement and saber arts were naturally faster.However, his Quintessential Energy would be expended at an alarming rate whenever he used the Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance. But despite the flaw, it was very powerful!Once, twice\u2026 Meng Chuan pushed himself to his limit over and over again.His figure turned into phantom images as he left behind ethereal saber flashes.Thirty-one times! Meng Chuan stopped. The meridians his Quintessential Energy passed through were aching, but there was no stinging pain.I can only execute the Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance 31 times after pushing my Quintessential Energy to the limit. According to the Dao Academy\u2019s teachings, the body is very magical. Muscles and bones will become stronger under training. If my meridians are trained to their limits, they will slowly become broader and tougher. The circulation of Quintessential Energy will also stimulate my meridians to adapt.I want my meridians to withstand even stronger bursts. In that case, when a true life-and-death battle does break out, my movement technique and saber arts will be faster at full force.To force the body to adapt to more Quintessential Energy was another method to fusing one\u2019s body, mind, and technique. He could become stronger by combining both methods.\u2026These three types of cultivation\u2014together with standard medicinal baths and medicinal pills to speed up his Marrow Cleansing\u2014were Meng Chuan\u2019s daily cultivation routine.He persevered.Days passed.His father had left Eastcalm Prefecture. His father\u2019s restaurant could be said to be number one in the Eastcalm Prefecture because it had a single condiment: lotus fish powder! It was a very special type of powder ground from dried fish. Used as a seasoning, it made ordinary dishes absolutely delicious. The restaurant became the best in all of Eastcalm Prefecture by relying on the lotus fish power.However, just what sort of fish was this \u201clotus fish?\u201d The other Godfiend clans in Eastcalm Prefecture wanted to know as well.However, it was clear that the Meng family kept it a secret. This was a mysterious little fish that Meng Dajiang had discovered. He went out of town twice a year, with each trip taking one to two months so he could bring back the mysterious lotus fish powder.It wasn\u2019t that terrible either. Meng Dajiang spent three to four months away from home, but Qiyue\u2019s father\u2014Liu Yebai\u2014would spend most of his time outside.\u2026Night.Two figures passed through the wilderness like ghosts.\u201cWe have arrived at the Yufang Prefecture that\u2019s inside the Wu State. Let\u2019s rest in Yufang Prefecture. You must give your injuries adequate rest. You can\u2019t travel any further.\u201d Two figures came to a halt. One of them was a somewhat dissolute and elegant Liu Yebai, while the other was Meng Dajiang\u2014who had lost weight.Meng Dajiang was dressed in black. After he lost weight, his figure was similar to when he was young. He also became much more handsome.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHis face was pale, and he couldn\u2019t help coughing softly. \u201cCough, cough.\u201d Meng Dajiang covered his mouth as he coughed. However, there was blood in his hand.Liu Yebai couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cYou really are going all out.\u201d\u201cChuan\u2019er is about to enter the Mortal Shedding realm. I have to accumulate enough credit,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.Liu Yebai shook his head and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been risking your life for so many years. All your efforts have been exchanged for an Iceheart Fruit. Was it worth it for your son\u2019s Godfiend foundation?\u201dMeng Dajiang smiled exhaustedly and said, \u201cMy greatest pride in this life is my son. As long as it\u2019s for Chuan\u2019er, it\u2019s worth it no matter how much I pay for it!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was rendered speechless by his good friend.However, wasn\u2019t it because they appreciated each other that allowed them to be such good friends?\u201cLet\u2019s enter the city,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.The two of them silently arrived at the Yufang Prefecture. It was late at night, and the city gates had already been shut. Guards patrolling the city walls. However, Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai phased into two blurs, and gently leaped over a hundred feet high\u2014over a hundred feet higher than the city walls! Furthermore, a faint black fog surrounded them, making detecting them in the dark harder.Just like that, the duo silently glided a hundred feet over the city wall.\u201cMy lord.\u201d\u201cMy lord.\u201d On the city walls, Wang Qianfan led several subordinates to inspect the city walls. The guards were very respectful.Wang Qianfan suddenly frowned and raised his head. \u201cOh?\u201d\u201cMy lord, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d a deputy asked curiously.\u201cMake sure everyone is careful. Don\u2019t let the demons sneak in,\u201d said Wang Qianfan with a frown. He felt something was amiss, but he couldn\u2019t explain why. He was a Seamless expert who had comprehended \u201cForce,\u201d and was part of Yufu Prefecture\u2019s garrison. Nobody below the Godfiend realm could escape his senses. If it really was a Godfiend or a Demon Monarch\u2026It was meaningless for mortals like them to stop those existences.\u201cYes,\u201d answered the deputy immediately.Swoosh.Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai snuck into Yufang Prefecture City.\u201cThe leader of the city gates\u2019 garrison was actually an expert who achieved \u201cForce.\u201d If we had been careless, we would\u2019ve been discovered by him,\u201d Liu Yebai said with a smile. \u201cIf we did get discovered, we can\u2019t stay here for long.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve implicated you,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.\u201cWhy say such things between us?\u201d Liu Yebai asked.\u2026The servants of a mansion in Yufang Prefecture City were all aware that two good friends of their master had visited, and their master was hosting them warmly.\u201cAlright, you are dismissed,\u201d Liu Yebai ordered.\u201cYes.\u201d The wealthy businessman was very obedient.Only Liu Yebai and Meng Dajiang were left in the hall. Meng Dajiang was staring at a roasted goat as he ate. Beside him was a large amount of beef.Kacha! Kacha! Meng Dajiang opened his mouth wide and\u2014no matter how hard the bones were\u2014easily crushed them to pieces. He ate the meat and occasionally picked up a gourd to drink the alcohol within.\u201cDajiang, seeing you eat like this has me craving.\u201d Liu Yebai sat there and poured himself a glass. He drank slowly and smiled. \u201cSpeaking of which, your appetite is definitely the best in Eastcalm Prefecture. You can completely finish a whole lamb and over fifty kilograms of beef and pork.\u201d\u201cAre you envious of me?\u201d Meng Dajiang obviously gained some weight. He picked up the jar and filled his gourd. When it was full, he took out a porcelain bottle and placed three pills into the gourd.\u201cNo matter what, I have never heard of your cultivation formulation before\u2014becoming stronger by eating,\u201d Liu Yebai said with a sigh.Meng Dajiang drank while eating.After finishing the meat, he gained about five kilograms.\u201cThis makes my recovery speed fast. I\u2019ve recovered from most of my injuries today,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cI\u2019ll be completely healed by tomorrow. However, I burned too much weight in the previous battle. To recover to my peak state, I still have to eat for five to six days.\u201d\u201cEat slowly; there\u2019s no rush.\u201d Liu Yebai smiled. \u201cThe earliest Meng Chuan enters the Mortal Shedding realm is May. There\u2019s still ample time.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Meng Dajiang nodded.\u2026While staying in the manor for six days, Liu Yebai secretly managed matters. Meng Dajiang ate, drank, and cultivated daily. After six days, his weight had increased by about forty kilograms. He turned back into a fatty from his previous handsome appearance.When his strength returned to its peak, Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai quietly left the Yufang Prefecture City.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The wealthy merchant and the six servants in the luxurious manor snapped awake. They felt as if they had been dreaming for the past six days. As to what they dreamed of, they couldn\u2019t remember anything at all.\u2026On 2nd May, Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai returned to Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201cWe\u2019re back.\u201d The two felt extremely happy looking at the Mirror Lake Meng Manor in front of them.Meng Dajiang touched the jade box that he kept near his chest. Inside it was an Iceheart Fruit. He had exchanged for it using his years of life-and-death adventures\u2019 credit.\u201cMaster, Master Liu.\u201d The guards at the door revealed looks of delight.A servant immediately rushed over to report. \u201cYoung Master, Miss. The two masters are back.\u201dMeng Dajiang and Liu Yebai entered the residence together. It was currently noon. Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue were having lunch. They were pleasantly surprised to see their fathers returning.\u201cDad, you\u2019re finally back. It\u2019s been almost half a year since you left.\u201d Liu Qiyue ran over and hugged her father, Liu Yebai, with tears in her eyes.\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d Liu Yebai smiled as he stroked his daughter\u2019s hair. \u201cQiyue, you\u2019ve grown taller again. It won\u2019t be long before you catch up to me.\u201d\u201cDad.\u201d Meng Chuan walked towards his father.\u201cI\u2019ve been out of town for some work. I\u2019ve brought back the lotus fish powder as well.\u201d Meng Dajiang\u2019s chubby face was full of smiles as he patted the bag on his back and chuckled. \u201cCatching the fish, drying it, and then grinding it isn\u2019t difficult. It\u2019s just time-consuming.\u201d\u201cDad, Uncle Liu, I reckon you haven\u2019t eaten yet. Come join us.\u201d Meng Chuan was in a good mood after his father\u2019s return.\u201cYes, let\u2019s eat,\u201d said Meng Dajiang jovially.\u201cWhen it comes to eating, your dad will be happy,\u201d quipped Liu Yebai with a smile.\u201cYou are just a small-eater. Look at how skinny you are.\u201d Meng Dajiang raised his eyebrows and strode into the hall.\u2026On the night of 11th May, Meng Chuan finished fusing his body, mind, and technique, reaching the Perfected Marrow Cleansing realm.On 12th May, Meng Dajiang brought Meng Chuan to the ancestral mansion.Fairy Meng was leisurely eating some snacks as she read a book in her hand.\u201cGrandaunt.\u201d Meng Chuan greeted Fairy Meng.\u201cYou have perfected your Marrow Cleansing?\u201d Fairy Meng nodded in satisfaction. She took out a porcelain bottle and handed it to Meng Chuan. \u201cInside is a drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid! Once you begin cultivating a Godfiend Body, you can consume it. You have to consume it within three months of cultivating the Godfiend Body. Past that, you\u2019ll miss the crucial period for forging a Godfiend foundation.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan accepted it solemnly. This was something the Meng family had spent nearly all its wealth to exchange for.\u201cWhich Godfiend body are you planning to cultivate?\u201d asked Fairy Meng. \u201cThe choice of a Godfiend Body is of utmost importance! Once you select one, there\u2019s no way to change. Even when you become a Godfiend in the future, you\u2019ll have to follow the original path.\u201d\u201cFor example, if you choose the Flaming Divine Body, you will only be able to choose Godfiend bodies similar to the Flaming Divine Body when you become a Godfiend in the future. There\u2019s no way to change your path,\u201d said Fairy Meng.Meng Chuan obviously knew.The Godfiend body cultivated at the Mortal Shedding realm was the foundation, giving one a portion of Godfiend power.Only by becoming a Godfiend in the future would one possess a complete Godfiend Body!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere are a lot of Godfiend bodies,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cThere are ones with extremely strong defensive powers. They can even be called Indestructible Bodies. There are also Godfiend bodies with extremely strong vitality. One can even regrow a severed arm! There are also those with immense strength! There are also extremely fast ones! There are ones that are good at sensing and reconnaissance. Some are good at influencing an area. Every Godfiend body has its traits.\u201d\u201cAnd once you\u2019ve chosen one, you will have to follow this path for life.\u201d\u201cOur Meng family has all sixteen foundational Godfiend Body formulae.\u201d Fairy Meng asked, \u201cYou must have read them before, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve read through all of them.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. The foundation Godfiend Body formulae could only be cultivated before becoming a Godfiend. It wasn\u2019t hard for every Godfiend family clan to collect all of them.\u201cWhich Godfiend body do you plan on cultivating?\u201d asked Fairy Meng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, I don\u2019t have the confidence to say whether choosing the Lightning Divine Body would be the best idea for when I become a Godfiend. I\u2019d like your guidance, Grandaunt.\u201dHe was far-sighted. He couldn\u2019t just think about immediate benefits\u2014he still needed to think of the future.\u201cOh?\u201d Fairy Meng smiled. \u201cTell me, why did you choose the Lightning Divine Body?\u201d Meng Dajiang was listening as well.\u201cI\u2019m best at speed,\u201d Meng Chuan said. \u201cRight now, my movement technique and saber arts are the best when it comes to speed! As for the Lightning Divine Body, it\u2019s the fastest amongst the 16 Godfiend body foundations! I think cultivation should make up for weaknesses and amplify what\u2019s already good! Thus, I chose the Lightning Divine Body. It\u2019s to make my movement technique and saber arts even faster.\u201d\u201cThe fusion of strengths?\u201d Fairy Meng\u2019s eyes lit up as she nodded in approval. \u201cAlthough you aren\u2019t very old, you are absolutely correct. Mediocrity is taboo when it comes to cultivation. Being mediocre means you can\u2019t kill the enemy. You will only be killed by the enemy.\u201d\u201cIs the Lightning Divine Body suitable after becoming a Godfiend?\u201d pressed Meng Chuan.Fairy Meng sighed. \u201cAfter becoming a Godfiend, the Lightning Divine Body will become even more terrifying. Its advantage is even more astonishing than when you were a mortal. The body transforms into lightning, and the speed of lightning is excellent. The killer moves are also terrifying! Even if one can\u2019t kill the enemy, one can easily escape. However, the Life-and-Death juncture to transition from mortal to Godfiend has greater difficulty compared to ordinary Godfiend bodies.\u201d\u201cThe Life-and-Death juncture is even harder?\u201d Meng Chuan was puzzled.\u201cLightning bolts will strike you when breaking through the Life-and-Death juncture. You will die if you can\u2019t withstand them,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cTherefore, you need a robust foundation to withstand them. The threshold for becoming a Godfiend will also be higher. Of course, Archean Mountain will tell you what realm you need to reach to have complete confidence in becoming a Godfiend.\u201d\u201cI heard that in Archean Mountain, one has to have full confidence breaking through before they take the plunge. Of course, those who can enter Archean Mountain are extremely talented,\u201d said Fairy Meng with a smile. \u201cAs for us who are lacking in talent, we typically take the gamble with a 60\u201370% chance. After all, if we drag on, we might only have a 40\u201350% chance as we age. It\u2019s even possible for our success rate to drop to 20\u201330%. The success rate will just keep dropping.\u201dPhysical body, Quintessential Energy, realm, mental fortitude, and mental state\u2026Becoming a Godfiend involved many aspects.\u201cSince I\u2019ll still be very powerful after becoming a Godfiend, then I\u2019ll choose the Lightning Divine Body,\u201d said Meng Chuan.\u201cAlright.\u201d Fairy Meng nodded and said with a smile, \u201cEven if you become a Godfiend in the future, you will have a few types of Lightning Godfiend bodies to choose from. These Godfiend bodies also have their pros and cons. If you\u2019ve sufficiently accumulated power, you can choose the stronger ones. If you haven\u2019t accumulated enough strength, you can choose the weaker ones. That way, it will be easier to pass the Life-and-Death juncture.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded but did not say anything more. With his personality, he would naturally follow the strongest route.Aim for the skies.No matter what, he had to aim high. If he didn\u2019t have the goal to become a powerful expert, how was he to become one?\u2026Back at the Mirror Lake Meng Manor.Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan walked side by side.\u201cChuan\u2019er, when do you plan on breaking through?\u201d Meng Dajiang asked.\u201cTonight,\u201d said Meng Chuan. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to delay.\u201d\u201cCome with me then.\u201d Meng Dajiang led the way.Although Meng Chuan was somewhat puzzled, he still followed his father to the residential building.Boom! When they entered the building, Meng Dajiang pulled a mechanism under the bed. A tunnel immediately appeared.\u201cA tunnel?\u201d Meng Chuan was surprised. He didn\u2019t know that his father was hiding a secret chamber here all these years.Constructing tunnels was actually very normal. For instance, the countryside forts had tunnels and chambers built on a large scale! Even if demons were to storm a fort, the clansmen would hide in the hundreds of tunnels deep beneath. They would pull down thick gates and secure themselves inside. The demons had to find a secret tunnel and pass through all kinds of traps to find the humans inside.However, in the city, there were relatively fewer tunnels built.Boom! Boom!Within this tunnel, two other stone doors opened via a mechanism.Then, he arrived at a secret chamber.\u201cChuan\u2019er, take a seat first,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.Meng Chuan sat down on a mat, puzzled. Meng Dajiang rummaged a densely-packed bookshelf for a particular book before flipping it open. Hidden inside the book was a wooden box.Meng Dajiang held the wooden box and sat down cross-legged opposite Meng Chuan. He took out another jade box that he kept close to his chest.\u201cGive me the Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid first,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.Meng Chuan took it out and passed it to his father, feeling a little confused.Dong! Dong! Dong!Meng Dajiang placed the long wooden box, jade box, and the porcelain bottle on the ground.\u201cThere are a total of three natural treasures here.\u201d Meng Dajiang first picked up the jade box and opened it. Inside was an ice-white fruit that emitted cold air. \u201cThis is an Iceheart Fruit. You can immediately consume it on the first day you cultivate a Godfiend Body.\u201dAfter closing the jade box, Meng Dajiang pointed at the porcelain bottle. \u201cYou can consume the Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid the family gave you on the third day of cultivating a Godfiend Body.\u201d\u201cThis final one\u2026\u201d Meng Dajiang looked at the long wooden box and gently opened it.Inside the wooden box was a green plant that suffused with colorful light. The leaves and roots were all complete. \u201cThis is the legendary Astral Spirit Herb. Its value is several times greater than that drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid. From the first day of cultivating the Godfiend Body, eat a little of it every day. The leaves and roots shouldn\u2019t be wasted as well. Finish it all within a month!\u201d\u201cFrom today onwards, you will come to this chamber every night to cultivate,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.Meng Chuan was stunned. \u201cDad, these three treasures?\u201d Meng Chuan couldn\u2019t believe it.His grandaunt had been heavily injured, which was why she had spent so much of the family\u2019s savings on a single drop of the Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid to groom Meng Chuan. That was already an act of madness.And now, his father took out two other precious treasures? One of them was the Astral Spirit Herb which was worth even more?\u201cIn terms of value, the Astral Spirit Herb is the most precious. Next is the Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid. Then, the Iceheart Fruit,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cHowever, every item here wasn\u2019t easily obtained. You must treasure them.\u201d\u201cDad, how did all of these come about? This Astral Spirit Herb is even more valuable than something the family spent almost all of its savings on?\u201d Meng Chuan asked in disbelief.\u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d Meng Dajiang frowned.\u201cWhen it\u2019s time for you to know, you will learn of it.\u201d Meng Dajiang sighed. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s not good to learn about some things too early. What you need to do is to become stronger.\u201dMeng Chuan also found his father a little mysterious.Iceheart Fruit, Astral Spirit Herb\u2026 Where did they come from?What kind of secret did his father\u2014who usually laughed and ran a restaurant\u2014have? However, since his father felt that he wasn\u2019t strong enough, he should cultivate properly.\u201cYou have to treasure them,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.\u201cI will, Dad,\u201d replied Meng Chuan.\u2026That night.Meng Dajiang sat in the room and stared at the hanging painting his wife had drawn.\u201cChuan\u2019er has grown up.\u201dMeng Dajiang looked at the woman in the painting, the woman whom he loved the most in his life. \u201cNianyun, I have already given him the Astral Spirit Herb. Don\u2019t worry, our child is very outstanding and even has a chance of becoming a Godfiend. I raised him very well. He\u2019s very outstanding, very filial and obedient\u2026\u201d\u2026In the underground chamber.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSitting cross-legged on the prayer mat, Meng Chuan began his breakthrough.He directed the Quintessential Energy in his dantian to enter one acupuncture point after another\u2014all 182 of them\u2014according to the necessary pathways. When he was at the final acupuncture point, the 182 points formed a beautiful three-dimensional chart with each acupuncture point a node. This chart was also the core of the Lightning Divine Body.Boom!As soon as the three-dimensional Quintessential Energy chart took form, lightning began to emanate from it. Bolts of lightning began to flow through the three-dimensional chart, fusing into every single part of his body.\u201cAh!\u201d Meng Chuan could sense his body transforming as each bolt of lightning flowed through the three-dimensional Quintessential Energy chart and fused into his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His body began transforming into a Lightning Divine Body.Meng Chuan opened his eyes, picked up the jade box beside him and opened it, then took two bites from the Iceheart Fruit inside. The ice-cold energy flowed down his throat into his stomach, which then slowly spread to his whole body. His transformation became more obvious after his muscles and bones absorbed the cold energy from the fruit as he fused with the lightning.Next, the Astral Spirit Herb. He opened the wooden box and plucked a leaf and some roots from the intact Astral Spirit Herb. It was about one of thirty portions that he could finish in about a month.His mouth was filled with a refreshing fragrance as he chewed the leaf and roots gently. Then, his mind jolted. A magical sensation surged into his head before slowly transmitting to his whole body, allowing his body to continue strengthening as he transformed.Although he didn\u2019t know the origins of the Iceheart Fruit and Astral Spirit Herb, the fact that his father\u2014a good-tempered man who always laughed and never complained\u2014had said they weren\u2019t \u201ceasily obtained\u201d and that he had to \u201ctreasure them,\u201d meant that they were extremely difficult to obtain. The prices behind them were probably huge as well. All he could do was not disappoint the hopes they placed on him.\u2026For the next month, Meng Chuan trained according to plan and had consumed the drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid. He also finished consuming the Astral Spirit Herb. He also spent 8000 hours practicing the Saber Drawing Stance, movement technique, and saber arts. He never stopped cultivating.According to the manual, one was still transforming in the early stages of the Godfiend Body as one cultivated. If one were to train a particular aspect diligently, one\u2019s body would also be inclined towards transforming in that aspect. It was like a growing sapling. If one exerted pressure on it in a certain direction, it might also begin growing in that direction.The transformation of his Godfiend Body was clearly slowing down. One day near the end of June, Meng Chuan ate a watermelon as he sat on the training ground.The first month of my cultivation was meant to be an explosive growth. I also consumed three rare treasures. My improvement was astonishingly fast, so fast that it was somewhat inconceivable. The drop in my growth speed is expected. Meng Chuan sighed. My Godfiend foundation is indeed very robust and deep. My body and Quintessential Energy at the Mortal Shedding realm\u2019s early-stage already match those at the perfected Mortal Shedding realm.One had to know that the early-stage Mortal Shedding realm provided the greatest improvement in the five Mortal realms. After all, it was the first time cultivating a Godfiend Body, allowing them to possess the power of a Godfiend gradually.To be able to match a perfected Mortal Shedding realm while in the early stage meant that his foundation was terrifyingly robust.Meng Chuan\u2019s body and Quintessential Energy would probably rival those at the Seamless realm when he was at the late-stage of the Mortal Shedding realm\u2014even though the breakthrough from the Mortal Shedding realm to the Seamless realm was significant.This situation was something rarely heard of in the entire Eastcalm Prefecture. Typically, only geniuses from the imperial capital and Archean Mountain who had been groomed by ancient Godfiend families would have such a Godfiend foundation.\u201cChuan\u2019er, Chuan\u2019er.\u201d Meng Dajiang\u2019s voice came from afar.\u201cDad.\u201d Meng Chuan put down the watermelon and wiped his mouth with a towel before running over.Soon, he saw his father\u2014Meng Dajiang\u2014and a bald, thin elder with a walking stick walking over.\u201cThird Elder.\u201d Meng Chuan jolted to attention. He was most afraid of the Third Elder amongst the elders of the Meng family. The Third Elder was a cold, old-fashioned man who treated the younger generation the fiercest. Without a second word, he would swing his walking stick and viciously beat up the younger generation. It wasn\u2019t surprising every junior was afraid of him.\u201cChuan\u2019er, why aren\u2019t you paying your respects to the Third Elder?\u201d Meng Dajiang said.Meng Chuan immediately stepped forward and bowed. \u201cGreetings, Third Elder.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe bald, thin elder looked at Meng Chuan and saw his sweat-soaked clothes. Only then did he nod in satisfaction. \u201cYou have to put your heart into cultivation. How can you become stronger without enough sweat?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d responded Meng Chuan obediently. He had to be obedient when he was facing the Third Elder. Under no circumstances should he argue with him. If he dared talk back, he would receive a blow from the walking stick!\u201cThis is a torn page of a saber art that I fortuitously acquired when I was young. You can take a look.\u201d The bald, skinny elder took out a piece of black paper that was carefully wrapped and handed it to Meng Dajiang with the wrapping included. However, just the terrifying aura emanating from that piece of black paper when unwrapped shocked both Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang.\u201cA Godfiend legacy?\u201d Meng Chuan and his father were incomparably shocked.Godfiend legacies required an extremely powerful Godfiend to pay a massive price to create them.For instance, Fairy Meng, Patriarch Yun, and most Godfiends did not have the qualifications to create a Godfiend legacy.\u201cThat\u2019s too valuable,\u201d said Meng Dajiang immediately. \u201cThird Uncle, we can\u2019t accept it.\u201dThird Elder frowned and said, \u201cI gave it to him, so he has to accept it! I wouldn\u2019t have given it to Meng Chuan if his perception was insufficient. Since he is our Meng family\u2019s only hope now, he has to accept it. Besides, this isn\u2019t a complete Godfiend legacy. It\u2019s just one of its remnant pages.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be returning.\u201d Third Elder supported himself with his walking stick and turned to leave. At the same time, he coldly said, \u201cLittle brat, you must make something of yourself. Don\u2019t disappoint everyone.\u201d\u201cYes, Third Elder.\u201d Meng Chuan held the black torn page wrapped in cloth and was quite touched.Typically, a hundred thousand taels of silver would be the starting bid at an auction for a remnant page of a Godfiend legacy. Not to mention the fact that it happened to be a saber art! This made it even more valuable.This was something that could only be obtained by chance! To ancient Godfiends, silver was of little significance. No one would exchange a complete Godfiend legacy for mortal items.\u201cThis remnant Godfiend legacy page should be the Third Elder\u2019s most precious item. He\u2019s giving it to you right now,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded and pulled away the cloth, looking at the saber art page.The black piece of paper recorded the key secrets of the move and the things to take note of when executing it.But as he read it, Meng Chuan gradually immersed himself in it.Huh?Meng Chuan felt as though he had entered a trance. After entering this special mental state, he saw a tall, thin man showcasing this saber art\u2014Swaying Moonfall!The saber was extremely gentle as it streaked across the sky, leaving behind a beautiful arc. It was as though the moon in the sky had been chopped off, setting its descent into motion.It was beautiful and gentle.Eh? Meng Chuan jolted awake and escaped the illusion.\u201cChuan\u2019er, how is it?\u201d Meng Dajiang immediately asked.Meng Chuan stared seriously at the black paper and softly said, \u201cIt looks like a gentle and beautiful saber art, but in reality, it\u2019s extremely ruthless and vicious.\u201d The terrifying aura emanating from the black piece of paper was enough to alarm Meng Chuan.\u201cSinister and vicious? Are you going to cultivate it?\u201d asked Meng Dajiang.\u201cOf course,\u201d Meng Chuan said rather solemnly. \u201cSaber techniques are divided into Yin and Yang. This technique falls under the extreme softness of Yin. This is an extremely beautiful move. It\u2019s called Swaying Moonfall. It really does seem capable of slashing the moon down with a single move. I can sense that the conceptual legacy contained within this torn page can withstand transmitting the legacy ten or more times before it completely tears apart.\u201d\u201cI will make good use of these ten chances and have this move become one of my killer moves,\u201d said Meng Chuan.Initially, he had planned on honing the Saber Drawing Stance into his only killing move. But Swaying Moonfall was simply too perfect. Furthermore, he had more than ten chances to experience the move.\u201cDon\u2019t waste the legacy\u2019s opportunities,\u201d Meng Dajiang reminded him. \u201cIt\u2019s gone once all chances are used up.\u201d\u201cBefore becoming a Godfiend, I\u2019ll only permit myself to use it nine times,\u201d said Meng Chuan.From that day forth, Meng Chuan added an hour-long afternoon routine to his cultivation. In this hour, he cultivated only one move\u2014Swaying Moonfall.\u2026Eastcalm Prefecture. Within a hidden hall in Jadesun Palace.In the center of the hall was a pool of cold water. The white-robed youth, Yan Jin, was currently seated in the lotus position within the pool. Only his chest was exposed above the water.The terrifyingly low temperature caused the white-robed youth\u2019s entire body to frost. His hair and brows were covered in frost, and his face was pale.\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019ve been cultivating for four hours today. It\u2019s time for you to exit the Frost Cloud Pool,\u201d shouted an old servant. Palace Lord Jadesun was watching calmly.\u201cI\u2019ve already reached the mid-stages of the Mortal Shedding realm. From today onwards, I\u2019ll cultivate in the Frost Cloud Pool for six hours every day,\u201d Yan Jin said coldly.\u201cJunior Brother, overreaching yourself isn\u2019t wise. Four hours is enough for you to cultivate your Godfiend Body,\u201d said Palace Lord Jadesun.\u201cIt\u2019s still early.\u201dYan Jin said coldly, \u201cAll of you can leave.\u201dPalace Lord Jadesun shook his head gently.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Palace Lord Jadesun led the old servant out, leaving the frosted white-robed youth to continue his arduous cultivation.\u2026Many youths were training hard within Eastcalm Prefecture, with Meng Chuan and Yan Jin working especially hard.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDays passed.During the final month of the year, Mei Yuanzhi first went to Wu Prefecture City, then arrived at the distant Archean Mountain region to participate in the entrance examination. In the end\u2026 Mei Yuan failed to join Archean Mountain. After failing, he went to Qinyang Pass to serve in the military.When news of this spread to Eastcalm Prefecture, it caused Yun Fu\u2019an and the others to gloat secretly. Others sighed.Meng Chuan also felt the pressure. The threshold to enter Archean Mountain was extremely high. He had to work harder and become stronger than Mei Yuanzhi to have hope.(End of the First Volume\u2014Secret Technique, Third Autumn Leaf)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the blink of an eye, Meng Chuan had been in the Mortal Shedding realm for a year.During one summer evening, the evening wind carried a cool breeze, but it was rather lively in Mirror lake Dao Academy\u2019s courtyard.\u201cI\u2019m Zhou Qian. Please give me some pointers, Senior Brother Meng.\u201d A youth bowed respectfully.\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.Today, he was here to spar with Dean Ge Yu\u2014who had long achieved Saber Force and also cultivated the swift saber. Meng Chuan would gain inspiration every time he sparred him. Hence, he would come seek guidance every half-month. Although Dean Ge Yu was greedy and petty, he was still very attentive towards his most talented disciple.After sparring with the dean, he would take an hour to give his juniors pointers. To him, sparring with them was too easy. It could even be considered a form of relaxation.\u201cBe careful.\u201d The youth, Zhou Qian, suddenly charged forward and launched a series of attacks. As Meng Chuan stood there, his body was strangely blurry. No matter how hard the youth tried to attack, he could not touch the corners of Meng Chuan\u2019s clothes.After unleashing all he could muster with the sword, he delivered his final killer move. He stabbed forward thirteen times\u2014only to miss every time.Zhou Qian was quite talented in the Mirror Lake Dao Academy. According to the lecturers, he was likely to be admitted to Mountain River Pavilion next year. However, the gap between him and Meng Chuan was still too great.\u201cSenior Brother Meng is impressive.\u201d\u201cNow, not a single disciple in the Dao Academy can touch Senior Brother Meng\u2019s clothes. They can\u2019t even withstand one blow from him.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Meng is destined to be a Godfiend,\u201d the disciples watching by the side said.The prestige enjoyed by every generation\u2019s Eldest Senior Brother fluctuated.Meng Chuan was definitely the Eldest Senior Brother with the highest prestige in the Dao Academy over the past few decades! His strength was unimaginable, far exceeding the second top disciple in the Dao Academy. He was also willing to sacrifice his precious cultivation time to guide his juniors occasionally . His family clan\u2019s influence was also the highest in the entire prefecture city, but he hadn\u2019t bullied others.Many factors caused the juniors to idolize their Eldest Senior Brother.\u201cYour last move is the killer move of the sword art known as the Thirteen Consecutive Peaks,\u201d said Meng Chuan. \u201cIt\u2019s also very clear in the manual that once this sword technique is unleashed, it should be like mountain peaks that are constantly undulating and as one. You have accomplished the \u2018Undulating,\u2019 but you have yet to achieve \u2018As One.\u2019 Your sword slashes were a scattered mess, which decreases its might significantly.\u201d\u201cAs One?\u201d Zhou Qian murmured. He seemed to have an idea but was still short of something. He trusted Senior Brother Meng\u2019s advice.In terms of techniques and moves, even the lecturers had said that only Dean Ge Yu could top Senior Brother Meng in all of Mirror Lake Dao Academy. Senior Brother Meng\u2019s guidance was more direct than the lecturers\u2019. As a disciple who hadn\u2019t been admitted into the Mountain River Pavilion, Zhou Qian had no right to have the dean teach him one-on-one.\u201cYour other sword moves aren\u2019t bad. Only the flaws of your killer move are more obvious. Go and practice this move more. Once you master it, you will attain Greater Mastery of this sword art.\u201d Meng Chuan\u2019s gaze swept across his juniors, which were filled with anticipation. He smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. Go have dinner, everyone.\u201d With that said, he left.The juniors also understood that Senior Brother Meng\u2019s guidance session had ended. Many of his fellow disciples walked towards the Dao Academy entrance.Huh? When Meng Chuan reached the entrance, he saw a figure dressed in red robes\u2014Liu Qiyue. She had grown taller and was no shorter than Meng Chuan.\u201cAh Chuan, Ah Chuan,\u201d Liu Qiyue shouted immediately.\u201cQiyue, you\u2019re one year younger than me, but you\u2019re almost my height.\u201dLiu Qiyue laughed and said, \u201cMy dad said that girls enter puberty earlier. Besides, I\u2019ve also stepped into the Mortal Shedding realm. That accelerates my body\u2019s growth.\u201dLiu Qiyue\u2014who was 15 this year\u2014had also broken through to the Mortal Shedding realm this month. However, her archery was still stuck at a bottleneck. Attaining the Unity realm was just too difficult.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s hurry to Cloud River Restaurant for dinner,\u201d said Liu Qiyue immediately. \u201cYou lost to me.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, let\u2019s go.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded helplessly. He had lost a bet.After Liu Qiyue broke through to the Mortal Shedding realm, Meng Chuan had claimed that Qiyue couldn\u2019t touch him even if she fired a hundred arrows while he stood within a circle ten feet in diameter. Liu Qiyue refused to believe him. Meng Chuan was filled with confidence, having honed his movement technique with arrow volleys\u2014especially when such a movement technique was coupled with his powerful Lightning Divine Body foundation. However, a Mortal Shedding realm sharpshooter was difficult to deal with when they unleashed their full power. Arrows containing a Godfiend\u2019s power, together with archery techniques, were simply nightmares. It was far more terrifying than the guards who just fired arrows normally.Using his movement technique, Meng Chuan dodged seventy-nine arrows in a row, but the eightieth arrow hit his clothes.He lost!Meng Chuan remained rather happy despite losing and decided to try again a few days later.Cloud River Restaurant was the number one restaurant in Eastcalm Prefecture. It was a bit extravagant to bring her here, but this was a restaurant his father ran! He didn\u2019t need to pay when eating there!The youth, Zhou Qian, watched Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue leave. Senior Brother Meng entered the Mountain River Pavilion at the age of thirteen. I have to enter it by fifteen! He secretly made up his mind and walked in another direction, returning home.\u2026Zhou Manor.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d\u201cYoung Master.\u201dZhou Qian returned home and the servants were all very respectful.The Zhou family was originally a very ordinary family in Eastcalm Prefecture. Later on, Zhou Qian\u2019s father, Zhou He, made a name for himself! He was quite skilled and managed to build a social network with comrades from the battlefield. After twenty years, he managed to establish a family business. He could be considered a rather famous tycoon in Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201cYoung Master Zhou, Young Master Zhou.\u201d Suddenly, a child appeared from a corner.\u201cIronborn?\u201d Zhou Qian looked over and smiled. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dIronborn was the younger brother of his maidservant, and he often came to the manor. The servants in the manor liked this obedient child.\u201cYoung Master Zhou.\u201d Ironborn immediately knelt. \u201cSave my sister! Save my sister!\u201d\u201cYour sister? What happened to Red Rain?\u201d Zhou Qian immediately asked.\u201cJust a moment ago, Boss Wei brought men to my house. He said my father owed him 300 taels of silver. My father said that he had only borrowed 10 taels of silver. He was half drunk back then, and it was Boss Wei who deliberately tricked him. He made him print his palm on a promissory note stating 100 taels of silver,\u201d Ironborn said immediately. \u201cNow, the interest has caused his debt to rise to 300 taels of silver. How can our family afford it? Boss Wei forcefully abducted my sister to repay the debt. My father refused, so they beat him up.\u201d\u201cDid your father sign an indenture contract regarding Red Rain?\u201d Zhou Qian pressed.\u201cNo! My father said that he wouldn\u2019t harm my sister even at the cost of his life,\u201d Ironborn said.\u201cAlright, if you don\u2019t sign an indenture contract, they\u2019re kidnapping a lady.\u201d Zhou Qian suppressed his anger. They still had to learn the laws of the Imperial Court in the Mirror Lake Dao Academy. \u201cWho is this Boss Wei?\u201d\u201cMy father said that he\u2019s a lackey of the Black Wolf Gang. Anybody who comes under the banner of the Black Wolf Gang strikes fear in others,\u201d said Ironborn immediately.\u201cI want to see how bold a mere hooligan is.\u201d Zhou Qian could no longer hold himself back. \u201cLead the way! Bring me to this Boss Wei.\u201d\u201cStop right there!\u201d a cold voice shouted.Zhou Qian was stunned. He turned around and saw his father, Zhou He, standing there.\u201cDad.\u201d Zhou Qian softened the moment he saw his father.\u201cSend Ironborn out.\u201d Zhou He ordered his servants, and the servants immediately led the child outside. Ironborn cried and shouted, \u201cYoung Master Zhou, you must save my sister. She will be finished if you don\u2019t save her.\u201dBut the servants easily grabbed the child and quickly brought him out.\u201cDad! That ruffian is engaging in abduction. Are we not going to do something about it?\u201d Zhou Qian said anxiously.\u201cFool,\u201d Zhou He said coldly. \u201cDo you think a lackey will dare to commit abduction? He\u2019s working for someone more powerful. He helps the Black Wolf Gang abduct women and trains them before finally sending them to the brothels. This is the Black Wolf Gang\u2019s business. The Black Wolf Gang is one of the three biggest gangs in Eastcalm Prefecture. Behind it is the Godfiend family, the Bai family! The Black Wolf Gang is the one who helps the Bai family do its dirty work.\u201d\u201cYour father is just a small businessman. How can I offend the Black Wolf Gang?\u201d Zhou He looked at his son. \u201cThe Black Wolf Gang can crush our Zhou family like an ant. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI, I\u2026\u201d Zhou Qian felt terrible. \u201cBut Red Rain, Red Rain\u2026\u201d Red Rain had been serving him since he was eight. They had a deep relationship.\u201cDo you want to save Red Rain or protect the Zhou family?\u201d Zhou He said, \u201cMe, your mother, your brother, and over a hundred people survive thanks to the Zhou family! We can\u2019t afford this fight.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t we discuss with the Black Wolf Gang and buy her back?\u201d Zhou Qian asked.\u201cBuy?\u201dZhou He sneered. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? A debt of 300 taels of silver, and you want the Black Wolf Gang to break the rules? You need at least 1000 taels of silver to have any hope for negotiation. Is a maid worth a thousand taels?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d Zhou Qian said.\u201c1000 taels? Do you know that I nearly died just to earn my first thousand taels of silver?\u201d Zhou He shot a cold glance at his son before turning to leave. \u201cYou decide for yourself! Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201dAfter Zhou He left, he ordered the guard leader. \u201cGo, keep an eye on the Young Master. Break his legs if he dares to leave!\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the leader of the guards replied obediently.\u2026Moments later.Ironborn was in despair outside the Zhou family\u2019s residence. The world was huge, and he had no idea how he could save his sister.\u201cSister.\u201d Ironborn cried.Swoosh.A figure leaped across the wall and quickly ran over to Ironborn.\u201cYoung Master Zhou.\u201d Ironborn was delighted to see Zhou Qian.\u201cGo to Cloud River Restaurant and find Young Master Meng Chuan. He is Young Master Meng, and the Black Wolf Gang is nothing in front of him. He will definitely save Red Rain,\u201d Zhou Qian said immediately.\u201cCloud River Restaurant, Young Master Meng Chuan?\u201d Ironborn\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cGo, be quick,\u201d Zhou Qian urged.Ironborn quickly ran off into the distance.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt this moment, the leader of the guards leaped over the wall and saw Zhou Qian. He gently shook his head. \u201cYoung Master, you\u2019ve really disappointed Master.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t he let me make my own decision? Why? Are you here to catch me?\u201d Zhou Qian said through gritted teeth.\u201cMaster said that I\u2019m to break your legs, but\u2026 you should go to him personally. Perhaps his heart will soften and spare you,\u201d the guard captain said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for me to do it.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I won\u2019t be able to escape in front of you.\u201d Zhou Qian didn\u2019t say anything and returned to the manor. However, his mind was on Cloud River Restaurant. \u201cSenior Brother Meng, you must save Red Rain. You must save her.\u201dIn Zhou Qian\u2019s opinion, it was very difficult for him to save Red Rain. But for Senior Brother Meng, it was nothing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The waiters of the restaurant had already served them warmly. They naturally knew their boss\u2019s son.\u201cAh Chuan, look over there,\u201d Liu Qiyue whispered.Meng Chuan turned to look.On the second floor of the bustling restaurant sat an expressionless white-robed youth. Beside him was an old servant.\u201cIt\u2019s him?\u201d Meng Chuan recognized him. It was the young man named Yan Jin from the Jadesun Palace. Yan Jin was a very mysterious man, and commoners in Eastcalm Prefecture had virtually never heard of him. However, all five Godfiend clans, the imperial government, and the other upper echelons of Eastcalm Prefecture paid close attention to this peerless genius whose talent was in no way inferior to Meng Chuan\u2019s. Additionally, his status was far superior since Palace Lord Jadesun backed him.Yan Jin noticed that someone was looking at him and glanced at Meng Chuan.Meng Chuan smiled as he raised his wine glass and gestured from afar. But Yan Jin turned his head\u2014he couldn\u2019t be bothered.\u201cHow rude.\u201d Liu Qiyue saw this and whispered, \u201cAh Chuan, ignore him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just his nature,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile. Last year at the Demon-Slaying Meet, Yan Jin had only said one sentence to him\u2014that he wasn\u2019t taking advantage of him! He understood the other party\u2019s personality since then.\u201cYou just have a good temper.\u201d Liu Qiyue picked up a large piece of soy sauce pork ribs. \u201cHmm, your restaurant\u2019s soy sauce pork ribs are better than the ones outside. I drool every time I smell it. This dish is all mine.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Nobody will snatch it from you!\u201d Meng Chuan teased. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you fat when you can eat so much?\u201dLiu Qiyue raised her brows smugly and continued eating happily.Just as they were eating, a voice suddenly rang out.\u201cYoung Master Meng Chuan! Young Master Meng Chuan\u2026 Please save my sister.\u201d A child\u2019s voice suddenly came from downstairs, filled with anxiety and determination.A child from an ordinary family truly required a great amount of courage to shout in Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s best restaurant.Meng Chuan immediately ordered a waiter on the second floor upon hearing the child\u2019s voice and words. \u201cBring that child up here.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d The waiter quickly left.Soon\u2014Wearing ordinary clothes, a dirty-looking child came to the second floor. The child felt somewhat nervous when he arrived at Meng Chuan\u2019s table and saw the luxurious interior.\u201cLittle guy, you\u2019re looking for me?\u201d Meng Chuan smiled at the child.When Ironborn saw the scion in front of him smiling at him, he calmed down. He immediately knelt and kowtowed. \u201cGreetings ,Young Master Meng. I\u2019m Ironborn. Please save my sister.\u201d\u201cWhat happened? Get up and tell me.\u201dOnly then did the child stand up.\u201cMy sister\u2019s name is Red Rain. She\u2019s a maid of a large family clan,\u201d Ironborn said. \u201cShe\u2019s very good. Every time she comes back, she will bring delicious food back for me. But today, when she returned, she was abducted by Boss Wei.\u201dThe white-robed youth, Yan Jin\u2014who was at another table\u2014naturally could clearly hear what the child had said with his Mortal Shedding realm prowess. He quietly drank and listened, but his gaze turned colder.\u201cWhy did they kidnap your sister?\u201d Meng Chuan inquired\u201cThey said they wanted to take my sister as payment for a debt,\u201d said Ironborn. \u201cThey said that my father owed them 300 taels of silver. However, Father said that he only borrowed 10 taels. At the time, he was half drunk and in the middle of the night. He was tricked into printing his palm on a promissory note stating 100 taels of silver. The debt grew, and it has now become 300 taels.\u201dUpon hearing this, Meng Chuan nodded. It was common for this to happen to commoners. These were indeed the deceitful things the local ruffians did, but they couldn\u2019t be stopped! This was because those who hadn\u2019t reached the Marrow Cleansing realm were not qualified to serve in the army. Without serving in the military, they were destined never to stand out. The hooligans were gluttonous and lazy, happy when they were imprisoned due to free prison food.\u201cDid your father sign an indenture contract for his daughter?\u201d pressed Meng Chuan.\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. My father refused to sign,\u201d the child said hurriedly.\u201cOh? A local hooligan dares to abduct?\u201d Meng Chuan was shocked. Hooligans usually did minor crimes; they didn\u2019t have the guts to commit serious crimes! This was because the Imperial Court\u2019s punishment for serious crimes was very severe. The punishment for abduction was the dismemberment of limbs and hard labor. The death penalty was normal if they went too far.There had to be a reason they dared to commit such crimes.\u201cWhat\u2019s Boss Wei\u2019s name? Where does he live?\u201d Meng Chuan asked again. \u201cWhat background does he have?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve only heard that his name is Wei Sandao. He lives at East Willow River. My father said that Boss Wei is a member of the Black Wolf Gang,\u201d the child said hurriedly.Meng Chuan nodded. \u201cBlack Wolf Gang? No wonder.\u201dWith that said, Meng Chuan waved his hand into the distance.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d A young man ran over.\u201cThere\u2019s a lackey of Black Wolf Gang called Wei Sandao. It should be an alias. He lives in the area around East Willow River! Bring him here,\u201d ordered Meng Chuan. \u201cGet a supervisor from the Black Wolf Gang to come over.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the young man said respectfully.The white-robed youth, Yan Jin, suddenly appeared in front of the child.\u201cLittle guy, lead the way. I\u2019ll save your sister now,\u201d Yan Jin said calmly.Ironborn was taken aback.\u201cTime is of the essence. If we are too late, your sister might be dead,\u201d Yan Jin said coldly. \u201cLead the way.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Ironborn became even more worried about his sister when he heard that.\u201cAh Chuan, let\u2019s go take a look as well.\u201d Liu Qiyue was eager to see the development.Meng Chuan was somewhat surprised that this mysterious youth\u2014Yan Jin\u2014abhorred evil. He nodded and said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s make the trip.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll lead the way.\u201d Seeing the mysterious white-robed scion and Young Master Meng follow him, the child grew even more excited.The old servant came to Yan Jin\u2019s side and whispered, \u201cYoung Master, there\u2019s no need for us to bother about this\u2026\u201d\u201cHeed my commands.\u201d Yan Jin\u2019s voice was a little cold.The old servant was taken aback and immediately followed without any fuss.\u2026Yan Jin was the most passionate. He got the old servant to carry the child and let the child point out the way.They ran at an extremely fast speed.\u201cIt looks like we don\u2019t need to interfere in this matter anymore.\u201d Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue followed behind.\u201cAh Chuan, I always feel that Yan Jin\u2019s temper is a little strange,\u201d Liu Qiyue said in a low voice. \u201cHe\u2019s cold, but he\u2019s willing to save someone he doesn\u2019t know. You might say that he hates evil, but he\u2019s been in Eastcalm Prefecture for at least a year, and yet, I\u2019ve never heard of him being chivalrous.\u201d\u201cHe has a strange temper, but he can be considered a good person,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile.Soon\u2014They had come to the East Willow River.\u201cBoss Wei is there.\u201d Ironborn pointed excitedly. \u201cThat one.\u201dClang!The gate to the courtyard was pushed open. Yan Jin and his servant went in first, while Meng Chuan and Lu Qiyue followed.At that moment, three men reeking in alcohol walked out from the main house of the courtyard. The leader of the group was a burly man with his top bare. He held a chicken drumstick in one hand as he walked out, cursing. \u201cWho dares to come to my house and act so insolently? Where did you get the guts\u2014Young Master Meng?\u201dThe moment Boss Wei came out, he saw three youths, an old man, and a child.Boss Wei immediately recognized Meng Chuan!The famous figure in Eastcalm Prefecture, one who had the potential to become a Godfiend, the Meng family\u2019s scion\u2026 Meng Chuan was simply too famous! As for the local ruffians, they knew quite a bit about the important people in Eastcalm Prefecture. They also knew not to offend them.Meng Chuan was someone this lackey of the gang clearly had to look up to! Even their gang leader had to lower his head and not show any disrespect. As long as the Meng family was willing, the Black Wolf Gang could be wiped out in one night.\u201cYou abducted his sister?\u201d asked Yan Jin.Boss Wei glanced at the child and immediately recognized Ironborn.\u201cI was just following orders.\u201d Boss Wei immediately said obsequiously, \u201cBut his sister is no longer with me.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe old servant took out a token and held it up. \u201cThis is Jadesun Palace\u2019s token.

After being pointed out by Ironborn, they immediately explained in panic.Yan Jin frowned and shouted, \u201cWhere is his sister?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Boss Wei and his two subordinates exchanged looks and began to hesitate. The rules of the gang were stringent.\u201cIf we don\u2019t find her, all three of you will die,\u201d Yan Jin said coldly.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk.\u201d\u201cShe has been sent to Idle Stone Garden,\u201d Big Boss Wei and the others hurriedly said.\u2026Idle Stone Garden was one of the six major strongholds the Black Wolf Gang specially used to train women. It was located in the northern sector of Eastcalm Prefecture.Woof! Woof!The sky was already dark, and dog barks could be heard occasionally from Idle Stone Garden. Clearly, the compound had guards patrolling it.The Boss Wei trio led the way. Yan Jin, Meng Chuan, and the others also arrived.\u201cThis compound is Idle Stone Garden. There are usually more than a hundred women here. They will be trained. If they have the ability, they will be sent to various upscale brothels. If they can\u2019t handle it, they will send them to some whorehouses,\u201d Boss Wei said with a fawning smile.\u201cAh Chuan, that\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve seen a few upscale brothels in Eastcalm Prefecture from afar. I\u2019ve never seen the place where they train the women\u2026\u201d Liu Qiyue was especially excited. \u201cI\u2019ve long heard that some pitiful women have been abducted here. Now, we\u2019re going to save them. We can\u2019t let any of those evil Black Wolf Gang members off.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to let off anyone who does evil,\u201d answered Meng Chuan.\u201cQuick, open the door! It\u2019s me, Wei!\u201d Boss Wei slammed on the door and shouted.The doors of Idle Stone Garden opened.The old servant took the initiative to step forward. With a flick of his hand, the two indolent gatekeepers were sent flying. When they struck a wooden pillar or the ground, they vomited blood.\u201cAn attack.\u201d\u201cMen!\u201d\u201cWho is so bold?\u201d\u201cHow dare they come to our Black Wolf Gang\u2019s territory and behave atrociously?\u201dThere was a commotion, and people from all over the compound rushed over.Yan Jin, Meng Chuan, and the others waited at the front yard. Boss Wei and company stood to the side cautiously with their heads bowed. On one side was Jadesun Palace and the Meng family, and on the other was their gang. They were afraid of both!Very quickly, a group of men appeared. Some of them had quite strong auras and possessed strength at the Marrow Cleansing realm.The leader of the group was an elderly man in a colorful robe who had reached the Mortal Shedding realm.\u201cYoung Master Meng?\u201d The colorful-robed elder\u2019s face had a cold expression, but upon seeing Meng Chuan, his face immediately bloomed like a flower. \u201cTo think that Young Master Meng would come to my humble abode. I\u2019m truly blessed. Young Master Meng, how may I help you? Young Master Meng, please speak your mind.\u201d\u201cI heard that you abducted women?\u201d Meng Chuan asked.\u201cNo, absolutely not.\u201d The colorful-robbed elder said hurriedly, \u201cOur Black Wolf Gang has always followed the law to a tee. Why would we do something like that?\u201dMeng Chuan pointed at Boss Wei and the others who had their heads lowered. \u201cThey said so.\u201dThe elder glanced at Boss Wei and the others coldly.\u201cGuardian, this is Young Master Meng. That person is from Jadesun Palace. We didn\u2019t have a choice either,\u201d said Boss Wei with a bitter expression.\u201cJadesun Palace?\u201d Only now did the old man take notice of Yan Jin and the old servant.The old servant took out the Jadesun Palace token and revealed it.The elder\u2019s heart skipped a beat. The Jadesun Palace has servants and soldiers\u2026 But those who can hold the Jadesun Palace\u2019s token are all from the upper echelons. There aren\u2019t more than ten of them! Who are these two? Why haven\u2019t I heard of them?\u201cThis child\u2019s elder sister was sent here about two hours ago by Wei Sandao,\u201d said Meng Chuan.\u201cWei Sandao just sent someone here?\u201d The elder turned his head and shouted while blinking slightly at his subordinate.The subordinate immediately said, \u201cIt seems so. I\u2019ll go find her and bring her here.\u201d\u201cHurry up!\u201d the elder barked.The subordinate immediately ran off.The elder turned his head and smiled at Meng Chuan and company. He immediately said, \u201cLord of Jadesun Palace and Young Master Meng, don\u2019t worry. Our Black Wolf Gang is very well-behaved. We definitely don\u2019t abduct women.\u201d\u201cYou still refuse to admit it?\u201d Yan Jin\u2019s voice was cold as he swept his gaze across the compound. \u201cHis sister was abducted, and there are more than a hundred women in this compound. I\u2019m sure many were abducted here against their will.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d the elderly man said.\u201cSeven women are living in that building. Take them all out,\u201d instructed the old servant.\u201cYes, right away.\u201d The elder nodded and gestured to his subordinates. However, he was secretly shocked. How impressive. He knows that seven women are living inside from hundreds of feet away?Soon\u2014Seven women came out. Some looked like young maidens, while others were in their twenties or thirties.\u201cDid you willingly come here, or were you abducted?\u201d Yan Jin said solemnly, \u201cJust tell me, don\u2019t be afraid. We are from the Jadesun Palace, and this is a scion of the Meng family. The Black Wolf Gang cannot threaten you. You can take revenge if you have a grudge against them. As long as these people violated the law, none of them will escape.\u201d\u201cThose who violate the laws will not be able to escape,\u201d said Meng Chuan. \u201cThis is my promise to you.\u201dThe elder\u2019s eyes narrowed when he heard that. The subordinates behind him looked at each other.Of the seven women, one of the older ones laughed self-deprecatingly. \u201cYoung Masters, all of you have been busy for nothing. All of us sisters came to this place of debauchery because we have nowhere to go. For example, I was abandoned by my husband. I had no place to live, no place to eat, and I was bullied. Only by coming here will I be able to eat to my heart\u2019s content and shelter myself from the elements. Speaking of which, the Black Wolf Gang gave me a way out.\u201dYan Jin, Meng Chuan, and Liu Qiyue were stunned.It was different from what they had imagined.Another woman also said, \u201cYoung Masters, I escaped from disaster and came here. There was nowhere to go, and I was on the brink of starvation. Can you understand what it feels like? It\u2019s useless begging anyone. I was so thin from starvation that I had to sell my body and be despised by everyone. It was the Black Wolf Gang who picked me out from a group of beggars and gave me a way out.\u201d\u201cMy father sold me to repay his debt, and it can be considered as me repaying his kindness for raising me,\u201d a girl said coldly. \u201cAs long as I earn money in the brothels and pay off my debt\u2026 I can regain my freedom and have some money to live the rest of my life.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s great here. We have pretty clothes to wear. We have sisters to have fun with. There\u2019s good food, and we don\u2019t need to work hard.\u201d A girl with a baby face smiled brightly. \u201cWhy do we need saving?\u201d\u2026There was a hidden tunnel in this compound. At the end of the tunnel was a hidden hall.In the underground hall.A hunchbacked man was seated in a lotus position. A faint green fog covered his entire body, and his eyes were filled with a terrifying green light.There was another female corpse to his side. There was a hole in the female corpse\u2019s chest, and it was clear that her heart had been dug out.Chi! Chi! Chi! The hunchbacked man\u2019s long right fingernails held a heart. However, the heart was now very dry.Phew~Whoosh~Green mist entered the hunchbacked man\u2019s body from his nose before he spat it out after some time.Knock! Knock! Knock! A series of knocking sounded from outside.\u201cOh?\u201d The hunchbacked man\u2019s expression changed slightly as he said coldly, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d How dare his subordinates disturb him when he was cultivating?\u201cMy lord, there are a few young men and a woman outside, as well as an old man. They are from Jadesun Palace, and among them is Meng Chuan from the Meng family. They say they are here to rescue a child\u2019s sister,\u201d the person outside the hall said softly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThen return the child\u2019s sister to them,\u201d said the hunchbacked man with a frown. \u201cI\u2019m at a critical point in my cultivation. There\u2019s no need to provoke the five Godfiend clans or Jadesun Palace.\u201d\u201cWhat if they want to search the entire Idle Stone Garden? I\u2019m afraid some secrets will be uncovered,\u201d said the person outside the hall.\u201cForbid them from searching!\u201d The hunchbacked man said calmly. \u201cIf you really can\u2019t stop them, we\u2019re destined to be exposed. Kill them and give up on this place. That will be a warning to the five Godfiend family clans and Jadesun Palace.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the person outside the hall replied respectfully.The hunchbacked man looked at the female corpse on the ground and said in a low voice, \u201cI really can\u2019t bear to give up such a good place for cultivation that provides me virgins often.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He refused to believe it.When he was young, the maidservant that had treated him exceptionally well was tortured to death in such a place.\u201cBring them all out.\u201d The colorful-robed elder smiled as he instructed. More than thirty women were brought and gathered together.\u201cYoung Master Meng?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Meng family\u2019s Meng Chuan!\u201d Many women\u2019s eyes lit up when they saw Meng Chuan!Countless people were envious and jealous of Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s geniuses. Meng Chuan often traveled between Meng Manor and Mirror Lake Dao Academy. Many people had seen him over the years.\u201cIf you were abducted, you can say it out loud. You don\u2019t have to worry about the Black Wolf Gang\u2019s revenge,\u201d said Meng Chuan. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the guts.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Meng, although some of us were crying and wailing when we came, it has nothing to do with the Black Wolf Gang. I came here on my own accord because of my brother\u2019s marriage. The sisters beside me all have their sad stories, but we were all willing,\u201d said a woman with a smile.\u201cYoung Master Meng\u2026\u201d These women were all very willing to tell Meng Chuan.As Meng Chuan, Liu Qiyue, and Yan Jin listened, the three became more confused. They could tell that these women didn\u2019t have any resentment towards the Black Wolf Gang. They were even shocked when they heard the women talk about their hardships.They had known that life was difficult for ordinary people due to the rules set by the imperial government\u2014those who didn\u2019t reach the Marrow Cleansing realm had to serve in the military otherwise the jobs available to them would be limited. But, those who opened small businesses and worked some odd jobs could still fill their stomachs. But today, they found out that there were people who lived more miserable lives amongst ordinary people. Those who were seriously ill or had families with gambling addicts. Those who went through famine or had their hometowns destroyed by demons\u2026These women were pretty, so they had this path to take. If they didn\u2019t have the prerequisite beauty, this path wouldn\u2019t have worked out.\u201cSis!\u201d Ironborn\u2014who was standing by the side\u2014called out in excitement, his eyes widening suddenly. He didn\u2019t feel anything when he heard the women complaining because his father was a gambling addict. If it weren\u2019t for his sister working as a servant in a large family clan, his family would have been finished.\u201cIronborn.\u201d The woman who had been brought out by the Black Wolf Gang immediately ran over.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d The elderly man laughed. \u201cWe found her. What happened? How did this woman get brought to our Idle Stone Garden? How was I not aware of this?\u201d\u201cGuardian,\u201d said the gang members respectfully. \u201cThe father of this woman named Red Rain owes us Black Wolf Gang 300 taels of silver. That\u2019s why our subordinates brought the man\u2019s daughter to hide here temporarily. It\u2019s to force her father to raise the money.\u201dWhen the elder heard, he immediately glared at the Boss Wei trio and shouted, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were hiding her here for your debt recollection?\u201dBoss Wei immediately came to a realization and said with a fawning smile, \u201cGuardian, how would we dare to alarm you with such a trivial matter? We only planned to hide her here for a few days to scare that gambler.\u201dMeng Chuan and company frowned when they heard this.When a debt reached a significant amount, debtors who temporarily impounded other family members to force the family to return the debt would only be punished with fines at the court. Unless the abducted woman was forced to become a prostitute, be severely injured, or killed, would a heavy punishment be meted out.As for Ironborn\u2019s sister, Red Rain, she clearly wasn\u2019t injured.\u201cSis, did they bully you?\u201d Ironborn hugged his sister and asked immediately.\u201cNo, they just locked me up in a room.\u201d Red Rain shook her head.\u201cCould we have made a mistake?\u201d Liu Qiyue whispered when she saw this.Yan Jin frowned.Meng Chuan looked at the group of women. Every single one of them had their stories, but none of them were forced. What he experienced today had indeed allowed him to see the other side of this world.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d The old servant stood beside Yan Jin and chuckled. \u201cIf it\u2019s illegal, the Black Wolf Gang will not let us see it easily.\u201dYan Jin\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cThis Red Rain was taken away by force without a doubt. Furthermore, the Black Wolf Gang didn\u2019t have an indenture contract for her. Since there\u2019s a precedent, it can\u2019t be only this once,\u201d said the old servant with a smile. \u201cFurthermore, the place where Red Rain was imprisoned is in the back of the compound. I\u2019m quite sure there are other pitiful women in those places.\u201dThese words caused the Black Wolf Gang members\u2019 faces to change. The elderly man in colorful robes had an ugly look on his face.\u201cYes, shady matters need to be hidden more carefully,\u201d said Yan Jin coldly. \u201cUncle Wang, check this compound carefully. I want to see how bold a small gang like this can be.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t you gone overboard?\u201dThe elder\u2019s face darkened as he took a few steps forward. His subordinates behind him also took a few steps forward, blocking the path in front of them. The colorful-robed elder said in a low voice, \u201cThe person you wish to save is now with you. Are you not giving us an out by continuing to force us?\u201d\u201cMove aside,\u201d said Yan Jin coldly.\u201cThis is the Black Wolf Gang\u2019s territory, and also the Bai family\u2019s territory.\u201d The elder laughed coldly. \u201cDo you all intend to fall out with us?\u201d\u201cHaha, you are quite bold as a Guardian,\u201d said the old servant with a laugh. \u201cIs there anyone who dares to threaten Jadesun Palace in Eastcalm Prefecture?\u201dIn Eastcalm Prefecture, the Jadesun Palace held the highest status, and it represented Archean Mountain.\u201cIf you dare to obstruct Jadesun Palace\u2019s operations, I can kill you directly. Your Black Wolf Gang should know the rules.\u201d The old servant took out the Jadesun Palace\u2019s token, and the color in the faces of the gang members immediately drained. They couldn\u2019t help but retreat. The Jadesun Palace\u2019s reputation was too great! It was said that the Imperial Court was in charge of mortal affairs while Jadesun Palace was in charge of all other matters.If one offended the Jadesun Palace, they would die for nothing.\u201cGuardian, don\u2019t fight with the Jadesun Palace.\u201d\u201cBear with it.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s report this to the gang. We won\u2019t be able to block them,\u201d the gang members said hurriedly. Even if it were a serious crime to abduct women, with so many people from the Black Wolf Gang, the Imperial Court\u2019s punishments would probably not reach them even if they did mete out punishments.Under the night sky.Inside Idle Stone Garden, the women watched nervously. The members of the Black Wolf Gang also retreated. The Boss Wei trio didn\u2019t dare say a word.Only the elder\u2019s expression darkened. He stood in the way. \u201cAre we really going to fall out with each other?\u201d\u201cDo you think you are worthy of that?\u201d The old servant chuckled softly. In terms of background, his family clan was far beyond what any of the five Godfiend clans in Eastcalm Prefecture were capable of.\u201cMake way!\u201d Yan Jin\u2019s eyes were cold. The thought of women being tortured to the point of death triggered his killing intent.\u201cHaha, alright. I\u2019ll make way. Make way. Let them investigate!\u201d The elder laughed, causing the old servant\u2019s expression to change.At this moment\u2026A person walked out from a distant corridor.His back hunched, but he remained tall. His hair was disheveled, and he walked over with a smile as he looked at Meng Chuan, Yan Jin, Liu Qiyue, and the old servant.Upon seeing this person\u2019s aura limited to an ordinary person\u2019s, Meng Chuan could vaguely sense an extremely terrifying threat approaching! It was as though a terrifying monster was approaching him.\u201cI heard that you are going to investigate this place?\u201d The hunchbacked man smiled. \u201cSo many paths lead to life, but you had to choose the one that leads to death.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, a rich green aura suddenly erupted from his body as his eyes glowed green. His entire body became larger and muscular; his fingernails grew longer as well. Reaching out his hand, he sent pebbles on the ground flying into the air and into his hands.\u201cI\u2019ll send you on your way.\u201d The hunchbacked man waved his sharp claws.Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!Dozens of stones flew out. A green aura enveloped every stone, and their speed was terrifying.Bang! Bang! Bang!Easily causing large holes, some stones passed through the wooden pillars while others passed through the rockery.\u201cAhhh!\u201d Following the stone trajectories, three gang members and two innocent women were pierced through by stones. Blood splattered everywhere as they died on the spot.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBe careful.\u201d Meng Chuan jolted to attention as he stepped in front of Qiyue and instantly unsheathed his saber at his waist. Liu Qiyue immediately pulled the siblings behind her.\u201cSkydemon Sect? Release of demonic aura?\u201d The old servant\u2019s expression drastically changed as he brandished a soft sword. \u201cYoung Master, be careful.\u201dYan Jin pulled out both his swords from his back. He immediately tried his best to block the attacks with both blades.Bang! Bang! Bang!Dozens of terrifying rocks enveloped with green aura instantly struck them. Meng Chuan, the old servant, and Yan Jin used their full strength to block the lethal stones. Every stone felt extremely heavy. They were stronger than arrows shot by an expert at the Mortal Shedding realm. The stones were even more terrifying than 100 Mortal Shedding realm warriors shooting arrows simultaneously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The white-robed Yan Jin wielded a sword in each hand. He stood in front as his two swords transformed into the symbol for Yin and Yang\u2014forming a vortex to block the stones.Yan Jin blocked almost half of the stones covered in the green aura.Flanking Yan Jin, the old servant\u2014who was at the Seamless realm\u2014and Meng Chuan blocked the remaining stones.We blocked them! Meng Chuan cultivated a Lightning Divine Body, and his speed was extraordinarily fast. His saber instantly transformed into a blur as he blocked multiple rocks, but he still found it extremely demanding on his body. The old servant who used a soft sword had power at the Seamless realm, but even he was struggling as well. In contrast, Yan Jin\u2019s every single strike was incomparably powerful, and he hadn\u2019t seemed to use any effort to block half the stones alone.Liu Qiyue\u2014who was protected in the rear\u2014did not hesitate to take out a distress flare and quickly activated it.Boom!With a loud bang, the flare flew into the sky with great speed.\u201cQuick, retreat!\u201d Meng Chuan hurriedly roared because the hunchbacked man\u2014who had casually tossed the stones\u2014had already charged over.Liu Qiyue held Ironborn with one hand and carried the other girl with the other as she charged out.\u201cHahaha, to have such strength at the Mortal Shedding realm? It looks like I\u2019ve caught a big one!\u201d The hunchbacked man\u2019s laughter echoed in Idle Stone Garden. He had already charged straight for Yan Jin! He was clearly the strongest, considering how he had blocked dozens of stones.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d The old servant slashed his sword forward, the soft sword curved and stabbed at the hunched man\u2019s eyes.The hunched man\u2019s body blurred slightly. The strike only hit the hunchbacked man\u2019s back. It barely pierced his skin before his muscles blocked it.Whoosh. The hunchbacked man struck out with his claw that was covered with a thick green demonic aura. Unable to dodge in time, Yan Jin had no choice but to hold up both swords to block.The claw struck the two swords.Boom!A terrifying power Yan Jin had no way of withstanding, surged into him from his swords.Even though he was good at redirecting power and had the Icefire Divine Body\u2014which was good at using the Yin-Yang Deflection\u2014the strength difference was too great! He was sent flying backward by the strike, slamming into the wall behind him. The Idle Stone Garden walls were instantly smashed apart, causing Yan Jin to fall onto the streets. He was covered in rubble. One of his swords was flung into the air.The hunchbacked man didn\u2019t care about the others as he only stared at Yan Jin in a bid to kill him.Yan Jin felt pain all over his body. His bones were fractured in several areas, and he had lost feeling in his arms. He wanted to get up, but he couldn\u2019t control his body.Too powerful! The difference was too great!\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d The hunchbacked man gave an ear-piercing laugh and charged over.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d The old servant wanted to catch up, but his speed was ultimately slower. His eyes couldn\u2019t help but show anger.\u201cCough, cough.\u201d Yan Jin coughed out blood.Am I going to die here? I really can\u2019t accept this. Yan Jin\u2019s vision was a little blurry. As he watched the hunchbacked man charge over, an even faster blur shot out from the side. A saber formed a beautiful arc, and the hunchbacked man was unable to dodge.Saber technique\u2014Swaying Moonfall!In terms of Godfiend foundations, Yan Jin\u2019s foundation was just on par with Meng Chuan\u2019s even though he was born with tremendous strength, and had consumed rare, treasured herbs while cultivating his Godfiend body. They were simply skilled in different aspects.Meng Chuan, who cultivated a Lightning Divine Body, focused on his movement techniques and swift saber. His advantage was in speed! He was faster than most Seamless realm experts, and he was even faster than the hunchbacked man.Human traitor from the Skydemon Sect! A murderous look flashed in Meng Chuan\u2019s eyes. His blood boiled as lightning flowed through his body, increasing his astonishing speed even further. Meng Chuan knew very well that he was unable to deal with this terrifying Skydemon Sect expert! Therefore, he had slashed at his opponent\u2019s leg. He wanted to injure his opponent\u2019s leg to slow him down. Only then would they have a chance of escaping.\u201cSwift saber arts and ingenious moves. As expected of a genius from the Meng family.\u201d The hunchbacked man finally slowed down as his left hand swiped out.Clang!His strike was bizarre and fast, easily blocking the saber beam.Seeing the situation turning south, Meng Chuan immediately retreated\u2014an arc beam streaking out from his saber as he did so. There was a cold look in the hunchbacked man\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou are even more dangerous than that white-robed youth. Have a taste of my Finger of Extermination.\u201d He suddenly flicked his right hand. One of his fingernails blasted out and shot towards the fleeing Meng Chuan.\u201cCommendable movement techniques, but you will still die.\u201d The hunchbacked man was very confident. His fingernails were his most powerful weapon. It would take a month for him to regenerate one of them. However, once he unleashed his full power, it would be extremely terrifying. This move was enough to kill ordinary Seamless realm experts.No good.The black fingernail\u2014covered with green mist\u2014was simply too fast.Meng Chuan could only use his sword to block it by instinct\u2014honed from blocking arrows every day. When facing death, the unity of his body, mind, and technique allowed him to use more of his potential.His saber blocked the black fingernail. The moment they collided, a terrifying demonic aura contained within the black fingernail exploded out! This exquisite saber move had shifted the black fingernail\u2019s trajectory, diverting most of the demonic aura away.However, some of the demonic aura traveled down the saber and into Meng Chuan\u2019s body.Boom!He felt his body spasm as he was flung away. He instantly lost feeling in his right hand that had held his saber. Blood sprayed from his mouth as he fell to the ground.The impact was one thing. What was even more frightening was the thick demon aura that had invaded Meng Chuan\u2019s body. It was excruciating painful.\u201cAh Chuan.\u201d The distant Liu Qiyue had already pulled out her bow and arrow from the quiver on her back. Gritting her teeth, she immediately drew her bow and shot at the hunchbacked man.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!Arrows shot out one after another.\u201cNone of you can escape. All of you have to die.\u201d The hunchbacked man completely ignored the arrows. No matter how the arrows landed on him, they were unable to pierce his skin! Liu Qiyue\u2019s arrows were too weak. After all, she had just stepped into the Mortal Shedding realm and had yet to reach the Unity realm. Her Godfiend foundation wasn\u2019t strong enough either. If it were an ordinary Seamless realm expert, they might have to be careful when dealing with her. However, the Skydemon Sect expert completely ignored her.Oh? The hunchbacked man\u2019s expression suddenly changed, and his body blurred.Swoosh.A sword beam passed through the spot where he was. It was the old servant.At that moment, a stream of water swirled around the old servant\u2019s body like tiny snakes. The old servant\u2019s aura was much stronger, but his skin and eyes were red.\u201cGodblood Pills?\u201d The hunchbacked man was rather surprised. He looked at the elder. \u201cThe Eastcalm Prefecture actually has Godblood Pills? It seems like you and your young master have powerful backgrounds.\u201d\u201cMiss Liu, take my young master and Young Master Meng Chuan with you,\u201d shouted the old servant angrily. \u201cI will hold him back.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Liu Qiyue immediately ran over. She first slung Meng Chuan over her back and dashed to Yan Jin.Yan Jin had a very high recovery rate, and he had already stood up. \u201cI can walk by myself.\u201d\u201cSeek help first.\u201d Meng Chuan used all his strength to expel the demonic aura in his body. At the same time, he spoke in a hoarse voice as he took out a distress flare.Boom!Yan Jin received the flare and activated it, sending the flare into the sky. He then sent his own distress flare into the sky.\u201cBoth of you hurry up and leave!\u201d Liu Qiyue bellowed angrily at the nearby Red Rain and Ironborn. The two siblings were worried about their saviors, but they nodded and immediately ran off into the distance. As for the other women and Black Wolf Gang, they had long fled in terror. The further they were from this terrifying battle, the better. Even so, over ten of them had been implicated\u2014they were either dead or crippled.Meanwhile.After consuming the Godblood Pill, the old servant\u2019s strength multiplied by several times and had already begun clashing with the hunchbacked man. The hunchbacked man had immense strength, and his body was seemingly invulnerable. Every move he made was abnormally terrifying. The old servant was at a complete disadvantage, but he was extremely resilient and continued to hold the hunchbacked man back.Booms ensued from the exchange of blows, and the surrounding walls were reduced to rubble.Swish! Swish! Swish!\u201cUncle Wang can\u2019t hold him for long. Let\u2019s go, quick,\u201d said Yan Jin. Liu Qiyue also ran off with Meng Chuan on her back.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Meng Chuan that they would only be burdens if they stayed behind. Only after they had escaped, could the loyal servant flee.\u2026When Liu Qiyue sent out the distress flare, it had attracted the attention of many people in Eastcalm Prefecture. It stood out at night.Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai were eating in a private room at a restaurant. Through the window, they saw the flare\u2019s trail in the sky and the explosion.\u201cIt\u2019s Qiyue.\u201d The two immediately recognized the flare. These distress flares were specially created for juniors. Just by looking at the shape of the fireworks, one could discern who had sent out the distress signal.\u201cQiyue is requesting help?\u201d Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai were both shocked.Swoosh!Liu Yebai immediately morphed into black mist and jumped out of the window.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMeng Dajiang\u2019s blood boiled as he transformed into a black beam of light, and shot out the restaurant.However, just seconds after they rushed out\u2014Bang! Bang!Another two flares.\u201cIt\u2019s Chuan\u2019er!\u201d Meng Dajiang shouted anxiously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29: Thorough InvestigationCKtalonCKtalonOutside Idle Stone Garden.A terrifying battle ensued between the Skydemon Sect expert\u2014who had released demonic aura\u2014and the old Seamless realm servant who had consumed the Godblood Pill.They have released distress signals. It won\u2019t take long for experts from the five Godfiend family clans and the Jadesun Palace to arrive. The hunchbacked man had the upper hand. He completely suppressed the old Seamless realm servant and was busy considering other matters. He looked at the crazy old servant in front of him with some disgust. Godblood Pills are indeed extraordinary. Most of my strength has been obstructed by the flowing water. The Godblood Pill is providing him endless energy. As long as the Godblood Pills\u2019 effects haven\u2019t finished, I can\u2019t escape him.I have no hope of escaping within thirty seconds. Forget it. I\u2019ll leave. I will be in danger if this drags on for over 30 seconds. The hunchbacked man made up his mind and turned to leave.Thirty seconds was his safety period.The longer he dragged on, the more likely it was for the experts from the five Godfiend family clans and Jadesun Palace to arrive. Although the Eastcalm Prefecture City was very large and Idle Stone Garden was quite remote, it would perhaps take experts thirty seconds to arrive. He didn\u2019t dare take the gamble! From his point of view, it was a good thing to kill Meng Chuan and company in passing. Otherwise, his life was naturally of utmost importance.Skydemon Sect experts lurked in every corner of the human world. They were careful and kept a low profile. This was an instinct!Whoosh.The hunchbacked man quickly turned around and left. His figure blurred, and in the blink of an eye, he disappeared into the night after traversing all of Idle Stone Garden.Oh? The old servant didn\u2019t continue pestering the man after he no longer pursued his young master and the rest, and instead left in the opposite direction. If he could live, he would take the chance.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d The old servant immediately rushed towards Yan Jin and the others.\u201cHe\u2019s gone?\u201d Yan Jin, Meng Chuan, and Liu Qiyue heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cWith me obstructing him, he didn\u2019t have the confidence to catch up to you.\u201d The old servant forcefully restrained his strength as he hurriedly said, \u201cAlthough he\u2019s powerful, he\u2019s afraid of the five Godfiend family clans and Jadesun Palace arriving.\u201d\u201cQiyue, put me down,\u201d Meng Chuan said hoarsely.\u201cAh Chuan, are you feeling better?\u201d Liu Qiyue put him down and asked immediately.\u201cThe injuries to my muscles and bones are nothing. However, it\u2019s a bit troublesome to expel the demonic aura. I can barely suppress it now. It will probably take me a few days to completely expel it.\u201d The demonic aura was faintly swirling around his body.Yan Jin\u2019s was covered in blood, and his face was pale. However, he still said, \u201cYoung Master Meng, Miss Liu, this matter was all because of me. If we had done as Young Master Meng said\u2014to get our men to do it\u2014the Black Wolf Gang would have likely obediently handed Red Rain over. It wouldn\u2019t have created all these problems! It was also because I wanted to search Idle Stone Garden the Skydemon Sect expert appeared. This was all because of me.\u201d\u201cI also wanted to save the pitiful women. Brother Yan Jin, don\u2019t think too much about it.\u201dBy the side, the old servant immediately said, \u201cIt was all thanks to you, Young Master Meng. The Skydemon Sect expert was just too swift at attacking Young Master that I couldn\u2019t save him in time. It\u2019s all thanks to that saber strike of yours my young master was saved.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d said Yan Jin. He remembered the strike that Meng Chuan delivered in his moment of despair\u2014one that saved him.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to thank me for when we were joining forces against an enemy?\u201d Meng Chuan laughed, but he couldn\u2019t help but cough twice as he laughed. This affected his injuries, and he couldn\u2019t help but grimace.Whoosh! Whoosh!Two figures instantly descended, their speed terrifying. This caused the old servant to feel nervous.Meng Chuan, Liu Qiyue, and Yan Jin turned their heads.\u201cDad!\u201d Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue shouted immediately.\u201cQiyue.\u201d Liu Yebai hurriedly looked at his daughter.\u201cChuan\u2019er.\u201d Seeing the demonic aura and blood-stained clothes on his son, Meng Dajiang couldn\u2019t help but panic. He hurriedly grabbed his son\u2019s arm and sent a surge of Quintessential Energy into his son\u2019s body.\u201cDad, I\u2019m fine. Nothing happened. It was Ah Chuan and Young Master Yan Jin who fought the Skydemon Sect expert,\u201d said Liu Qiyue.Only then did Liu Yebai relax. His daughter was indeed unharmed.\u201cHow is Meng Chuan?\u201d inquired Liu Yebai.\u201cAfter that Skydemon Sect expert injured Chuan\u2019er, he was unable to deal a killing blow. Therefore, he\u2019s still alright. He should be able to completely expel the demonic aura from his body within three days. As for his tendons and bones, he will recover within ten days.\u201d Meng Dajiang relaxed. He had been quite afraid when he sensed the demonic aura inside his son.An expert who could release demonic aura could probably kill his son in two or three moves. From how they looked now, the outcome was still acceptable.\u201cWhat about the man from the Skydemon Sect?\u201d inquired Meng Dajiang.\u201cHe was held back by me. He knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to kill Young Master and the rest, so he immediately left,\u201d said the old servant. \u201cIf he were to continue fighting, the two of you would be able to restrain him.\u201dAlthough the old servant tried his best to contain his strength, his aura was still surging.Godblood Pill? Liu Yebai and Meng Dajiang came to a conclusion and couldn\u2019t help but glance at Yan Jin.For a servant to have a Godblood Pill? What sort of background does this Yan Jin have? The two of them were somewhat surprised, but they didn\u2019t think too much about it. Since the other party had never publicly announced it, there was no need for them to investigate. In truth, if Palace Lord Jadesun was willing to protect them, it already indirectly proved that this youth named Yan Jin had an extraordinary background.\u201cHow did you encounter someone from the Skydemon Sect?\u201d Liu Yebai asked.\u201cWe came here to rescue a woman abducted by the Black Wolf Gang. We believed that there were more pitiful women in Idle Stone Garden. We were just about to search when that Skydemon Sect expert appeared,\u201d said Liu Qiyue.Liu Yebai said coldly, \u201cThis Black Wolf Gang\u2019s stronghold is actually a Skydemon Sect expert\u2019s lair? It looks like we have to investigate the Black Wolf Gang properly.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Meng Dajiang\u2019s eyes were cold. \u201cAll of the Black Wolf Gang\u2019s strongholds will be investigated thoroughly. None of them can escape investigation!\u201d\u2026The Black Wolf Gang\u2019s headquarters was heavily guarded.Gang Leader Liu Chang was drinking as he listened to music.\u201cMaster.\u201d A figure rushed into the building.\u201cOh?\u201d Liu Chang frowned as he looked at the young man rushing in. \u201cAh Quan, why are you in such a frenzy?\u201dThe young man glanced at the singer beside them.\u201cLeave first,\u201d instructed Liu Chang. The singer obediently retreated, leaving only the master and disciple inside.Only then did the youth speak respectfully, \u201cMaster, something big has happened at Idle Stone Garden. Didn\u2019t I report to you that there\u2019s something wrong with Guardian Chou? Women will occasionally disappear from Idle Stone Garden, but they don\u2019t appear in the brothels and whorehouses controlled by our Black Wolf Gang. The women that disappeared were virgins, ones that can be sold at a high price.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve instructed you to turn a blind eye to it. Why? What happened?\u201d asked Liu Chang.\u201cToday, Young Master Meng Chuan and a scion from Jadesun Palace came with a group of people. They wanted to search the entire Idle Stone Garden! A terrifying expert actually appeared,\u201d the youth said. \u201cHis entire body was covered in green mist, and his fingernails grew very long while his eyes turned green. It was very terrifying. He directly attacked Young Master Meng Chuan and the others.\u201d\u201cGreen mist? His fingernails grew long, and his eyes turned green?\u201d Liu Chang\u2019s expression changed. \u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cThe battle was terrifying. Many of our brothers and Idle Stone Garden women were casualties. We fled in every direction,\u201d the youth said hurriedly. \u201cMaster, I came to report to you at the fastest speed possible. If Young Master Meng Chuan and the others were to die, we\u2019d be in grave trouble.\u201d\u201cIs Young Master Meng Chuan still alive?\u201d pressed Liu Chang.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I immediately fled when I sensed something amiss. I didn\u2019t dare stay any longer,\u201d said the youth immediately.\u201cOh.\u201dLiu Chang asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell anyone that you had suspected Guardian Chou, right?\u201d\u201cNo, I did what you instructed me to do. Master, what should we do now?\u201d the young man asked.\u201cYou are, after all, stationed in Idle Stone Garden often. If the five Godfiend family clans and Jadesun Palace investigate this matter, they might investigate you,\u201d said Liu Chang. \u201cIt\u2019s now 7:45 p.m. and the city gates close at 8:15. There\u2019s still time for you to leave the city! Go to East Mountain\u2019s Flying Horse Bandits and hide. If they don\u2019t investigate you, I\u2019ll ask for your return. Remember\u2026 go to Flying Horse Bandit\u2019s and keep it a secret.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d The youth nodded.\u201cLeave quickly. The sooner, the better,\u201d said Liu Chang. \u201cOnce the city gate is closed, it won\u2019t be long before Jadesun Palace, and the five Godfiend family clans begin their investigations. You won\u2019t be able to leave tomorrow.\u201cYes.\u201dThe youth also felt that it would be safer for him to leave the city for now. He immediately left the gang headquarters and headed for the city gates.After he ran half a kilometer from the gang headquarters\u2014Swish! A hidden projectile flashed and pierced the youth\u2019s body.The young man\u2019s eyes widened, and he quickly collapsed to the ground.At this moment, a masked Liu Chang appeared beside him.\u201cAh Quan, Master doesn\u2019t dare to associate himself with the Skydemon Sect. I\u2019ll be doomed if the Godfiend family clans were to find out that I had discovered something amiss in Idle Stone Garden but chose to turn a blind eye to it. Only those who die will shut up forever. Don\u2019t blame me.\u201d Liu Chang quickly left with the youth\u2019s corpse.\u2026Moments later, Liu Chang returned to the Black Wolf Gang headquarters without anyone knowing.He leisurely drew in his study.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLiu Chang!\u201d A furious bellow sounded.Liu Chang immediately walked out of the study. When he saw a white-robed middle-aged man outside, he immediately said with a smile, \u201cAh, Lord Third. May I know what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cYou are asking what the matter is? You useless piece of trash!\u201d the white-robed middle-aged man said through gritted teeth. \u201cYou actually brought big trouble to me running a Black Wolf Gang! A Skydemon Sect expert appeared in Idle Stone Garden.\u201d\u201cWhat? Skydemon Sect? It has nothing to do with me. It has nothing to do with me.\u201d Liu Chang nearly cried from fright. He immediately said, \u201cLord Third, you know I don\u2019t have the guts.\u201d\u201cThe two young masters, Meng Chuan and that Yan Jin from Jadesun Palace, were seriously injured. Fairy Meng is on the verge of madness. She has already begun to mobilize the Meng family. Palace Lord Jadesun has also given orders to conduct a joint investigation with the Meng family. Tonight, the entire city will not be at peace.\u201d The white-robed middle-aged man gritted his teeth. \u201cYou trash, quickly follow me, and meet my elder brother.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Groups of men were sent out to carry out investigations.The Red Rain siblings had managed to flee to their master\u2019s house.Zhou Manor.Zhou He sat in the seat of honor with a livid expression. Young Master Zhou Qian\u2019s face was pale.\u201cMiss Liu told us to flee quickly, so we fled with all our might.\u201d Red Rain pulled her brother, Ironborn, and said hurriedly, \u201cBack then, several people died. Some of the Black Wolf Gang members died. The two of us fled in terror, and we came to tell you, Master.\u201d\u201cYou did the right thing! If it weren\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t have known that this little brat had caused such a huge mess.\u201d Zhou He looked at his son coldly. \u201cHow bold of you to get Young Master Meng Chuan\u2019s help. How dare you not tell me about such a huge matter?\u201dZhou Qian trembled slightly. \u201cI never expected this. I really never expected it. Red Rain, are Senior Brother Meng and the rest still alive?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Red Rain immediately shook her head. \u201cBack then, he and that scion from Jadesun Palace were already heavily injured. We don\u2019t know what happened to them after we fled.\u201d\u201cI hope they\u2019re safe and sound,\u201d Zhou He said coldly. \u201cOtherwise, our Zhou family will be finished. There won\u2019t be any hope at all.\u201d\u201cDad\u2026\u201d Zhou Qian said immediately.\u201cIt\u2019s up to luck now. Otherwise, whether it\u2019s the Black Wolf Gang, the Bai family, or the Meng family, we\u2019ll all be finished if any of them wants to deal with us.\u201d Zhou He stood up and said, \u201cZhou Qian, follow me to Meng Manor immediately!\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Zhou Qian said immediately. He was somewhat dazed.\u201cAnd the two of you,\u201d Zhou He instructed. \u201cIf anyone from the Imperial Court asks you about what happened today, just do as I say\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The siblings obediently listened.\u2026Zhou He brought his son to the Mirror Lake Meng Manor.On the way there, they saw troops of soldiers.\u201cBrother Zhang, Brother Zhang, what happened?\u201d Zhou He immediately asked the leader of a troop that he was familiar with.\u201cSomeone from the Skydemon Sect appeared, and Young Master Meng Chuan from the Meng family is still heavily injured. Now, we are searching the entire city,\u201d said the leader simply. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk further. I\u2019m in a rush.\u201d\u201cBrother Zhang, do what you need to do.\u201d Zhou He smiled.\u201cDad?\u201d Zhou Qian whispered.\u201cYoung Master Meng Chuan is alive. This is good news. So that person is from the Skydemon Sect?\u201d Zhou He pondered. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s hurry to Meng Manor.\u201d\u2026Mirror Lake Meng Manor.Meng Chuan leaned against the bed. Although his face was pale, he was in good spirits.\u201cMeng Chuan, if you meet a strong opponent that you can\u2019t fend off in the future, protect your life first.\u201d Fairy Meng sat to his side, leaning on her walking stick as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice that you saved Yan Jin, but if you were to sacrifice yourself, it\u2019s not worth it. You should know that you are the hope of the entire Meng family. You can\u2019t afford the loss, and our Meng family can\u2019t afford it either.\u201d\u201cGrandaunt, the Skydemon Sect\u2019s expert had a powerful body, but he wasn\u2019t that fast. I originally had the confidence to escape after saving Yan Jin. Who knew his broken fingernail would be so powerful? It severely injured me with one strike.\u201d Meng Chuan felt ashamed as well.\u201cHow many opponents have you really fought? In addition, your opponent\u2019s strength far exceeded yours. It\u2019s fine even if his attacks fail ten times because none of you can hurt him. But if you get hit once, you\u2019ll be finished. When faced with such a powerful opponent, you shouldn\u2019t be hoping to get lucky.\u201dFairy Meng shook her head. \u201cFurthermore, the people from the Skydemon Sect are all human traitors. They cultivate with formulae created by the demon race. Their combat tactics are also similar to demons. Their bodies can be cultivated into weapons! In the future, you must be careful. Immediately avoid the Skydemon sect if you encounter them. Put as much distance between you and them unless you have the confidence to kill them.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded. \u201cYes.\u201dAt that moment, Meng Dajiang walked in from outside.\u201cDad, how\u2019s the situation?\u201d asked Meng Chuan.\u201cThe Skydemon Sect disciple fled too quickly. They are now interrogating the Black Wolf Gang,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.\u201cWhat about the innocent women in Idle Stone Garden?\u201d pressed Meng Chuan.\u201cIn the battle, five Black Wolf Gang members died, and three were injured. Six of the women in Idle Stone Garden were killed, and two were injured. By the way\u2026 we discovered thirty-eight women locked up in the backyard. Chuan\u2019er, you saved quite a number of people,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cThe Idle Stone Garden has an underground hall. There were many female remains left there. The man from the Skydemon Sect must have spent a long time cultivating his demonic arts there.\u201dHearing this, Meng Chuan fell silent. He pitied the women who had been killed. His killing intent towards the Skydemon Sect grew.\u201cMaster.\u201d A servant\u2019s voice came from outside. \u201cZhou He brought his son, Zhou Qian, here. He claims he\u2019s here to seek forgiveness.\u201d\u201cSeek forgiveness?\u201d Meng Dajiang was puzzled. \u201cI\u2019ll go take a look.\u201d\u2026His grandaunt left after staying a while.Meng Chuan rested in bed. His grandaunt had easily removed the demonic aura within him. To Godfiends, expelling this bit of demonic aura was a piece of cake. Instead, he required a few days to recover from his physical injuries. This was also thanks to his Godfiend body being strong enough. If it were a normal person, it would take several months to recover.\u201cChuan\u2019er.\u201d Meng Dajiang pushed open the door and walked in. \u201cThat child who came to you for help had been instructed by a young lad named Zhou Qian.\u201d\u201cZhou Qian?\u201d Meng Chuan was puzzled. \u201cI know him. He\u2019s a disciple of our Mirror Lake Dao Academy. I even gave him some sword art pointers today.\u201dMeng Dajiang said, \u201cRed Rain is his personal maid, and he has a very good relationship with her. He originally wanted to save her but was stopped by his father, Zhou He. That\u2019s why he secretly sent that child, Ironborn, to the restaurant to seek your help. That is how everything started. I didn\u2019t expect that it was all because of your junior brother from the Dao Academy. I will definitely not let him go off so easily for making my son experience such a disaster.\u201d\u201cDad,\u201d said Meng Chuan immediately. \u201cI\u2019m quite familiar with Zhou Qian. He\u2019s quite talented. He didn\u2019t intend to harm me. From his point of view, this was trivial to me. The resolution to the Black Wolf Gang incident was indeed straightforward. We encountered the Skydemon Sect disciple because our luck was terrible. You can\u2019t blame Junior Brother Zhou Qian.\u201cYou\u201d\u2014Meng Dajiang shook his head\u2014\u201dwhat can I do about you?\u201dHe had been terrified today!If the old servant hadn\u2019t consumed the Godblood Pill to hold back the Skydemon Sect expert, his son would have died with Qiyue. How could Meng Dajiang not be angry with the Zhou family?\u201cFor every grievance, there is someone responsible for it,\u201d urged Meng Chuan immediately. \u201cThis is a principle you taught me.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. I can let them off, but I can\u2019t let them off easily. After all, he made use of you and didn\u2019t even tell you.\u201d Meng Dajiang nodded. \u201cZhou He sent a treasure, a thousand-year-old ginseng. It\u2019s a treasure worth ten thousand taels, and I accepted it. It can be considered that I\u2019ve already let the matter rest. That little fellow, Zhou Qian, needs some punishment too.\u201dPreviously, when Zhou He knelt and apologized, Meng Dajiang couldn\u2019t even be bothered to accept it. The Zhou family\u2019s business combined was only tens of thousands of taels of silver, and the amount of liquid cash they had was even less.Due to a lucky chance, Zhou He had bought the thousand-year-old ginseng for his son\u2019s Mortal Shedding realm cultivation.Now that he was using it as an apology gift, Zhou He was afraid that it was not enough.\u2026What should I do? What should I do? Zhou He knelt on the ground, with the gift box in front of him. He was covered in a cold sweat. Zhou Qian looked at his father guiltily. \u201cDad, it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late to say anything now. He doesn\u2019t even accept the apology gift. Young Master Meng\u2019s father is clearly still angry at our Zhou family,\u201d Zhou He said.At that moment, Meng Dajiang walked into the hall.\u201cElder Meng,\u201d Zhou He knelt on the ground and begged. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for not teaching my son well. You can punish him however you want. My Zhou family will have zero complaints. Please spare my Zhou family.\u201d\u201cSince my son has pleaded on your behalf,\u201d said Meng Dajiang indifferently, \u201cleave that gift. Take your son back and whip him a hundred times. Whip him until he bleeds. Let him lie in bed and reflect on himself.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Zhou He was overjoyed. \u201cI would have done so even without you saying that. Zhou Qian, thank Elder Meng for sparing your life.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThank you, Elder Meng.\u201d Zhou Qian knelt and kowtowed.\u201cLeave quickly.\u201d Meng Dajiang frowned and waved his hand.Zhou He smiled obsequiously and left with Zhou Qian. Zhou He heaved a sigh of relief when he left Meng Manor.\u201cDad, is our Zhou family alright?\u201d Zhou Qian asked.\u201cIt should be fine. He said he wanted you whipped, but to do it ourselves. Clearly, he doesn\u2019t want your life.\u201d Zhou He said coldly, \u201cYou have to thank Senior Brother Meng a lot. If he hadn\u2019t pleaded on your behalf, his father wouldn\u2019t have let the matter rest so easily.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just leave the dossier here.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cAlright.\u201d Qian Fang placed the thick dossiers there and left.Meng Chuan picked up the dossier on top and started to read it. It was a brief description of the entire development.The eight-year-old Ironborn wanted to save his sister, so he begged Zhou Qian. Zhou Qian was stopped by his father, Zhou He, and was unable to rescue her in person. Thus, he sent Ironborn to beg his eldest senior brother, Meng Chuan. Meng Chuan, who had a good relationship with Zhou Qian, interfered in this matter. Yan Jin, on the other hand, had intervened out of anger\u2026\u2026After Zhou He learned of the matter, he brought his son to Meng Manor to seek forgiveness. Meng Dajiang was furious, but Meng Chuan pleaded on behalf of his junior brother, thus sparing him\u2026\u2026In these few sentences, it describes how close my relationship with Zhou Qian is. It\u2019s as if it was because of him that I went to save Red Rain. I even pleaded for mercy on his behalf so that Father would spare them. Meng Chuan chuckled softly. Zhou He is really smart. He tried his best to hook up with my Meng family, probably because he\u2019s afraid that the Bai family would seek revenge.He could completely understand.An ordinary family clan would be terrified when pitted against a Godfiend family like the Bai family. Therefore, they thought up ways to guide the narrative, such as using the siblings\u2019 statement, such as Zhou He\u2019s answers when interrogated by the Jadesun Palace\u2026 There was no need to lie. As long as the main points changed slightly, outsiders would believe Meng Chuan\u2019s relationship with Zhou Qian to be extraordinary.The Bai family would also be fearful, because the person most furious about the situation was Fairy Meng! The Bai family was unwilling to anger the Meng family.No one wished to really fight a Godfiend who only had six or seven years of life left.When they found out that Meng Chuan and Zhou Qian had a close relationship, the Bai family no longer bothered dealing with the Zhou family anymore. Dealing with the Zhou family was not beneficial. It was just to vent their anger. Instead, they might anger Meng Chuan and the Meng family.Hence, the Zhou family managed to escape disaster.The Zhou family\u2019s Zhou He does have some tricks up his sleeve. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s a little sad. Meng Chuan could tell that the Zhou family was facing a dangerous situation. Taking a step forward led to a precipitous cliff, and a step backward a bottomless abyss! The Zhou family couldn\u2019t afford to offend any of the parties involved\u2014the Bai family, the Meng family, and the Black Wolf Gang\u2026 If they were not careful, they would fall to their deaths.According to the dossier, investigations on the Black Wolf Gang in Idle Stone Garden revealed five people related to the Skydemon Sect. Three were captured alive, one went missing, and the last committed suicide. According to the three\u2019s separate interrogations, the Black Wolf Gang is innocent.Meng Chuan didn\u2019t find it odd.There was no need for the Black Wolf Gang to collude with the Skydemon Sect. They would definitely die if they were found out.After all the Black Wolf Gang higher-ups were captured, their cultivation was probed. None of them cultivated any demonic arts. After investigations, the Black Wolf Gang was determined to be innocent.As the Black Wolf Gang had violated the Imperial Court\u2019s laws, Gang Leader Liu Chang was sentenced to serve at Qinyang Pass in a suicide squad for three years. The deputy gang leader, Cong You, was sentenced to ten years of hard labor\u2026As Meng Chuan read, he shook his head gently. The Black Wolf Gang has nothing to do with the Skydemon Sect, but this thorough investigation discovered several things. The leaders naturally can\u2019t escape.The Black Wolf Gang was quite unlucky.There were many hooligans among the lackeys in the gang. Even if the gang strictly abided by the rules, the hooligans under them could still commit all kinds of violations.This time, they had angered the Meng family and Jadesun Palace. Meng Chuan and Yan Jin were seriously injured and were nearly killed by the Skydemon Sect expert. Therefore, the Black Wolf Gang naturally had to take the blame, but the punishment wasn\u2019t too severe.\u2026These Godfiend family clans can turn their backs at a moment\u2019s notice. Even after serving as a loyal dog for so many years, they still threw me under the carriage. Thankfully, I have strength at the Seamless realm. I was only sentenced to join a suicide squad in Qinyang Pass. Liu Chang had been escorted to Qinyang Pass. Qinyang Pass was only ninety kilometers from Eastcalm Prefecture City, and nearly all mortal soldiers from the city came here.Liu Chang even felt a little relieved. Thankfully, I killed Ah Quan. No one knows that I had long suspected something was wrong with Idle Stone Garden. I managed to escape death.On the way to Qinyang Pass, he was still feeling rather lucky.I\u2019ll return in three years. Liu Chang turned to glance at Eastcalm Prefecture City. The soldiers escorting him were rather polite. The Black Wolf Gang\u2019s leader was an expert at the Seamless realm after all.\u2026Sitting in the training grounds, Meng Chuan flipped through the dossiers about the Bai family.If the Black Wolf Gang was innocent, then the Bai family was even more innocent. However, the Bai Family couldn\u2019t be completely forgiven since some of their territory had been a lair of the Skydemon Sect. They were punished severely by Jadesun Palace. The upper echelons of the Black Wolf Gang, as well as the Bai family members in the Black Wolf Gang, were all given sentences. They were also fined 500,000 taels of silver, making the Bai family feel the pinch.And them. Meng Chuan then flipped through other dossiers. Many people were recorded in the dossiers. It recorded the information of the women in Idle Stone Garden.So it\u2019s all true. These women already signed indenture contracts. They still have to return to the Black Wolf Gang and receive their training. In the future, they will still have to go to the brothels and whorehouses. Meng Chuan shook his head. The Black Wolf Gang wasn\u2019t dismantled. The Bai family arranged for people to take control of the Black Wolf Gang and continue to manage matters. The law protected the indenture contacts the women had signed.Meng Chuan\u2019s expression changed as he read. Most of those who were forcefully abducted ended up selling themselves to the gang?Most of those who were abducted by the gang had reasons just like Red Rain\u2014her father owed a huge amount of debt! She was taken to cover the debt. Now, she was released\u2026But if the debt was not repaid, what could they do?If they couldn\u2019t repay their debts, they would only owe more money due to the interest. They would ultimately be forced to \u201cvoluntarily sell themselves.\u201d For Red Rain\u2019s case, the Black Wolf Gang felt fear towards it. They took the initiative to tear the promissory note and write it off. Only then did their family temporarily escape this calamity. However, Red Rain\u2019s father was a gambling addict. If a gambler continued gambling, he would eventually end up harming his children.Sometimes, there\u2019s no way to save them. As Meng Chuan read the dossier, he seemed to see one woman after another walking towards Idle Stone Garden.How could this be? He felt extremely aggrieved watching this. There was no way to save them, as though they were trapped in a quagmire.Bam!Meng Chuan threw the dossier away and walked out.\u201cAh Chuan, have you eaten lunch?\u201d Liu Qiyue shouted when she saw his back.\u201cI\u2019m going out for a walk.\u201dHeading out even at noon. Liu Qiyue mumbled before returning to the hall. She ate with Liu Yebai and Meng Dajiang. Meng Dajiang smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s good to let him go out to relax.\u201d\u2026Meng Chuan was indeed aggrieved. Zhou He\u2019s cleverness and cunning earned a smile.He did not sympathize with the Black Wolf Gang\u2019s gang leader, Liu Chang. However, the women, especially those who had been abducted and rescued, had no choice but to head towards the quagmire again.How did this world turn out like this? Meng Chuan murmured. Suddenly, he saw a restaurant in front of him. At noon, quite a few guests were sitting inside.\u201cHere, try it. Doesn\u2019t it smell good?\u201d A couple was carrying a child. His father passed the torn white steamed bun to his child, who took a big bite and nodded. \u201cIt smells good.\u201dThe couple looked at their son and smiled happily. Both of them were dirty, and their fingers coarse. They clearly did hard labor, but their smiles were very radiant.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt this moment, Meng Chuan was stunned by the couple\u2019s smiles as they looked at their child.\u201cCome have a drink.\u201d There were four bare-chested men beside the couple. Their skin was glistening with sweat. They held large bowls of alcohol as they chatted loudly; they had completely forgotten about the hardships of their labor.\u201cLet\u2019s finish eating quickly. We\u2019ll go look for your father after we\u2019re done eating.\u201d An old man was with a girl as he drank some noodle soup. The girl nodded her head, her eyes sparkling with anticipation. \u201cYes, let\u2019s find Dad.\u201dLaughter, chatting voices, and hope in their eyes\u2026Meng Chuan felt his heart lighten significantly after seeing this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were also disciples from the Dao Academies talking as they walked side by side.\u201cLook, it\u2019s Senior Brother Meng.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Meng.\u201d The disciples from Mirror Lake Dao Academy immediately greeted him respectfully.Along the way, what he saw made him smile. He suddenly saw a crippled old man sitting by the side of the road, leisurely watching the pedestrians on the riverside. Beside him was a fishing pole. He smiled and occasionally inhaled on his smoke pipe.As a brilliant painter, Meng Chuan observed everything with great precision. He could sense the happiness and carefreeness of the crippled old man. \u201cSatisfaction\u201d overflowed from his body despite being severely handicapped\u2014he was missing one arm and a leg.His disability is so serious, but he can still enjoy life so comfortably? He looks the worst on this street, but he looks the happiest? Meng Chuan walked over curiously.\u201cSir,\u201d Meng Chuan walked over and greeted politely.\u201cMmm?\u201dThis crippled old man held the smoke pipe in his single hand and looked over. He couldn\u2019t help but be overjoyed. \u201cIsn\u2019t this Young Master Meng Chuan? For you to speak to an old man like me, I have to tell my wife when I get back.\u201d The elder\u2019s smile was very infectious.\u201cElder, may I know why you\u2019re so happy? Is there a joyous occasion?\u201d\u201cLook, the youths are cultivating their martial arts. The adults are living their lives.\u201d The crippled old man pointed at the streets. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see all of this.\u201dMeng Chuan was slightly stunned.\u201cOnce upon a time at Qinyang Pass, the demons amassed an army and stormed us under the lead of demon monarchs,\u201d said the crippled elder. \u201cOnce they charged in, the entire Eastcalm Prefecture and the surrounding areas were reduced to a scorched land. No one survived. At that time, I was serving at Qinyang Pass. From the Godfiends to every soldier\u2026 every one of them fought to the death.\u201d\u201cThe Godfiends fought the demon monarchs.\u201d\u201cWe also fended off every demon. Corpses were strewn everywhere, and my companions died one after another. Companions who were chatting and laughing just last night had fallen the next day. As long as they had one last breath, they would drag the demons into an internecine outcome.\u201d The old man\u2019s eyes were slightly moist as he said with a smile, \u201cOur eyes turned red from the killing. When you discover no more demons around you, there are also not many of your companions left around you.\u201d\u201cWe managed to survive until the other Godfiends\u2019 reinforcements arrived, and we finally managed to hold Qinyang Pass.\u201d The crippled elder laughed. \u201cWe managed to protect the lives of more than ten million people in Eastcalm Prefecture. That time, out of the soldiers which were originally 20,000-strong, only 1633 soldiers survived. Only two of the five Godfiends who were guarding Qinyang Pass survived.\u201d\u201cWhy did we risk our lives and not escape despite the desperate situation? It\u2019s because we don\u2019t want to be slaughtered; we don\u2019t want our family and children to be slaughtered\u2026 We hoped for them to peacefully cultivate, have plenty of alcohol to drink, and brag. We hoped that they would be able to marry and have children in the future\u2026\u201d The crippled old man laughed. \u201cI come out every day to take a look at the people on the streets, and it reminds me of my fallen companions. Their deaths were worth it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very lucky. 20,000 brothers and sisters, but only 1,633 survived. With me surviving, I can eat meat buns, drink alcohol, fish, and even smoke\u2026 Haha\u2026 How delightful.\u201d The crippled elder laughed.Meng Chuan listened quietly. The confusion in his heart was gone. Some so-called miserable families were laughable when compared to the elderly man.Take the Red Rain siblings, for example. Red Rain was a maidservant in a large family and could earn money to support her family. Her father was addicted to gambling, and who could be blamed for the debt he owed? To say that he had been deceived? Ignoring the possibility of him lying to his son, who was to be blamed for not reading the promissory note carefully?There are all kinds of humans. Some people choose to abandon themselves to vice. Some people remain smiling radiantly even though they are in an abyss. And the vast majority of people\u2026 Meng Chuan glanced at the peddlers on the street\u2014they are full of anticipation, as they busied themselves.\u2026After returning home, Meng Chuan ate lunch and went to the study.He spread open a canvas and began drawing.He had too many things he wanted to draw.He first drew one of the places in Eastcalm Prefecture\u2026\u2026From this day onwards, other than cultivating, he spent the rest of his time drawing.He drew every day.From summer to autumn, the painting continued for more than four months. As the autumn leaves turned yellow, the painting finally reached completion.This was a long canvas scroll\u201425 feet long.On the left side of the long scroll was an ancient city\u2014Eastcalm Prefecture City.The most eye-catching thing was the luxurious Meng family ancestral mansion. Inside, an old woman holding a walking stick stood still. Her entire body radiated a dazzling light, and her aura was terrifying. Next to her were the clan leader, Third Elder, Meng Dajiang, and a large number of clansmen. Meng Chuan drew dozens of people seriously, while the rest of the clansmen were drawn as shadows.Outside the Meng family ancestral mansion, there was the Black Wolf Gang leader, Liu Chang, who stood there bowing respectfully. Meng Chuan had never seen Liu Chang before. However, Meng Chuan did some caricature, making Liu Chang appear more robust and fiercer. However, in front of the Meng family ancestral mansion, he was extremely respectful and obsequious.Behind Liu Chang was Zhou He, who was bowing even higher at a deeper angle. Zhou He even gave Liu Chang a fawning smile. His smile was very detailed. Behind Zhou He was the timid Red Rain and Ironborn siblings. The rest of the Eastcalm Prefecture City was filled with many crowds.Several pitiful women were forced to sell their bodies for their families and were crying as they walked towards Idle Stone Garden. There were also dozens of workers working hard. Among them, there were even those who were crippled and were working with only one hand.There were also restaurants, teahouses, noodle shops, and other places. There were street vendors and pedestrians along the road. There were gambling addicts and local ruffians\u2026 There was also the crippled one-armed man by the side of the river. Beside him was a fishing rod as he smoked a smoke pipe. He chuckled happily as he looked at the streets beside him. He was situated at the rightmost corner of the scroll, taking in the entire painting.Meng Chuan drew hundreds of Eastcalm City\u2019s commoners in this picture.The highlight was the Dao Academy.In the Dao Academy drawn by Meng Chuan, there were children, youths, and teenagers who were cultivating hard. Dean Ge Yu was drinking and giving pointers. The Dao Academy was located on the leftmost side of Eastcalm City, and there was a sun rising beside it. This group of disciples from the Dao Academy represented the rising sun of Eastcalm City\u2014its hope.However, on the rightmost side of Eastern City.. Outside the city, a group of young men dressed in Dao Academy clothes\u2026 left Eastcalm City under the watch of their parents and family for another area.On the rightmost side of the entire portrait, was a border stained with blood.There was a Godfiend and demon monarch fighting. The Godfiend was Fairy Meng, and the demon monarch was a snake demon monarch that flew high in the sky.Along the border, countless soldiers were fighting the demons. Most of the soldiers were drawn simply, but some faces were drawn carefully.For example, among the soldiers, there was his father\u2014Meng Dajiang\u2014Dean Ge Yu, Clan Leader, Third Elder, Yun Fu\u2019an, Liu Chang, Zhou He\u2026 Although these people had different identities in Eastcalm Prefecture City, they had a common identity here\u2014human soldiers fighting demons!It\u2019s done. After drawing the last character\u2014a one-armed warrior stabbing a sword into a demon\u2019s head\u2014the warrior was the crippled old man. His gaze was fixed on the demon, but it was as if he was looking at the leftmost part of the painting\u2014the peaceful Eastcalm City.The entire painting conveyed the things Meng Chuan wanted to express.For instance, the Black Wolf Gang\u2019s leader, Liu Chang, was afraid of the Godfiend families, but he made some wealthy merchants fear him.Zhou He could amass many servants under him with one domineering command, but he had many fears.Meng Dajiang and the others had a high status, but they had also engaged in a bloody battle at the border for years.Godfiends were high and mighty. They were the backbone of humanity. They needed to protect the entire human race.As for the entire painting, there were many ordinary people who were from all walks of life. The women from Idle Stone Garden were just a small selection of countless commoners. Although these ordinary people were weak, they took up the greatest numbers in the painting. They were protected by Godfiends, but they were also the foundation of the human race. Only countless ordinary people over generations could give rise to Godfiends. As a result, the human race never ceased to exist.The entire painting showed all the different people. Even though he had only drawn the tip of the iceberg of the human race, he still revealed the reason for humanity\u2019s survival.On the upper right corner of the painting, Meng Chuan wrote two words: \u201cPeople Resonance\u201d.People.There were many people here: Fairy Meng, Meng Dajiang, Third Elder, Liu Chang, Zhou He, the crippled elder, Ge Yu, and so on\u2026 The characters were them, and also not them.I\u2019m done drawing. Meng Chuan sat on the chair, feeling extremely satisfied.He had always liked drawing since he was young.This was because he liked to observe this world. He liked to use his brush to record down what he could see. In the early days, he drew what was on the surface, and they were very vivid. Later on, when he drew Gallant Steed, he could draw the charm of horses. It was as if the horses were alive. Therefore, even those who didn\u2019t appreciate art would still feel shocked when they saw the painting. They were willing to pay a high price to buy it. At that time, he was the best artist in Eastcalm Prefecture.And today\u2026 he had reached another level.He drew his \u201cheart!\u201dHe drew out the strong emotions in his heart and fused them into the painting. The moment he finished, a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction filled his heart.People. Meng Chuan closed his eyes and smiled.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe immense spiritual satisfaction made his head spin.But he didn\u2019t know something was happening in the area between his eyebrows, within his consciousness.A blurry human-shaped soul slowly began to coalesce. In the past four months of drawing People Resonance, the human-shaped soul had slowly started emitting a spiritual light, causing the human-shaped soul to constantly condense. When the painting was finished, it caused great perfection in his heart. This human-shaped soul was finally able to reach its limits\u2014and with a boom\u2014it completely turned corporeal, revealing its true appearance.At this moment, Meng Chuan felt his head spinning.Following that, he 'saw\u201d as though he was cultivating Quintessential Energy inner sight. His consciousness 'saw\u201d a vast void between his eyebrows. There was a figure standing in this space. It was himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33: TransformationCKtalonCKtalonMeng Chuan was shocked.What is this? All I know is that three inches below the navel is the dantian. The dantian is where one can nurture Quintessential Energy. Why is there an empty space between my eyebrows? And this little person inside looks exactly the same as me? Meng Chuan was puzzled, but he also had some guesses. Since this little person looks the same as me, could it be the soul of man spoken of in legends? Or is it formed by my mind and will? Or is it something unknown?The manuals in Mirror Lake Dao Academy are distributed from Archean Mountain. My Meng family\u2019s manuals have been gathered over a thousand years. My knowledge of cultivation is pretty complete.I\u2019ve read all the manuals consisting of general knowledge a long time ago. I\u2019ve never seen any records about a space between the eyebrows. Meng Chuan was puzzled. He liked to read. And as a child from a Godfiend family clan, he was quite knowledgeable. But even then, he had never heard of a space between the eyebrows. There was even a tiny person hiding inside.Although he was surprised, Meng Chuan had an inkling that this was a good thing.He could already feel entirely new changes occurring in his body.This is such a wonderful feeling. When he closed his eyes, he could still easily avoid the items in the study as he walked. He opened the door with great ease and walked out. He kept his eyes closed and walked to the stone table in the courtyard before sitting on a stone chair.Even when I close my eyes, I can still see everything within a hundred feet. Meng Chuan opened his eyes. It was already night, and objects around him looked very blurry under the naked eye. However, at this moment, he could sense everything within a hundred feet clearly. He could even 'see\u201d the tiny bristles on an ant\u2019s legs while it crawled on a courtyard wall.In every direction\u2014left, right, up, and down\u2014he could see things clearly. However, things became blurry once he exceeded three feet below the ground.The naked eye could see ahead, but not behind! If it was pitch black, it would be impossible to see anything.I can see a hundred feet clearly. Additionally, I can sense up to half a kilometer around me.Sitting in the yard, he could clearly sense all aurae within half a kilometer. The aurae of humans and animals\u2014all living beings\u2014could be sensed.For example, his father and Uncle Liu\u2019s aurae were the strongest in the entire Meng Manor. His father, Meng Dajiang, had an extremely strong aura. Uncle Liu Yebai\u2019s aura was more ethereal.The weaker ones were a group of people at the Mortal Shedding realm. Qiyue\u2019s aura was the purest.In all of Mirror Lake Meng Manor as well as places outside Meng Manor\u2026 The further he went, the more blurry it became.Just like in broad daylight, without any obstruction, one could see into the distance with the naked eye. However, one could only see a blurry outline if they were far away!Meng Chuan\u2019s sense was the same! He could sense things nearby very clearly. If it was further away, he could only tell how many people and animals there were, which aurae were stronger, and which were weaker. That was all.If he exceeded half a kilometer\u2026 it would be darkness! He couldn\u2019t sense anything.Now, everything in the world looks different. Meng Chuan opened his eyes and looked at the various plants in the yard. The minute details within a hundred feet were simply breathtaking. He felt like the things he usually looked at were veiled by fog\u2014blurry. Now, everything was a hundred times clearer! The colors he saw were much more vivid. He could now see many tiny, weathered pits on the stone tables that appeared flat and smooth.Previously, if he were to look at hair, he would have found it very smooth and thin. But now, he could 'see\u201d the coarseness of the hair like it was a tree branch, with many rough spots and damaged parts.Everything felt more real.Swoosh.He drew his saber and slashed into the sky. Meng Chuan looked at the strike he delivered and felt excited.In the past, I couldn\u2019t see any flaws in a strike, finding it perfect\u2026 Now, I can actually see so many imperfections? Meng Chuan muttered. In the past, he had used his naked eye to look at the saber flash. Due to the strike\u2019s high speeds, he vaguely caught glimpses of it no matter how strong he was. He thought the saber move was good enough! Now that he could sense it, the saber flash revealed flaws and imperfections. Its trajectory was also a hundred times clearer.Every single flaw of the saber art was extremely clear. This allowed Meng Chuan to discover the imperfections of his saber art immediately.As someone obsessed with drawing, his pursuit of beauty was instinctual. He was unable to control himself due to the imperfection and disharmony.I\u2019ll continue training the Saber Drawing Stance. Meng Chuan began to practice the Saber Drawing Stance. His body transformed into a stream of light as he slashed out with his saber.Only by discovering that it wasn\u2019t perfect could he continue to improve.One slash after another\u2026He worked hard to perfect every strike.Two hours, four hours\u2026Meng Chuan didn\u2019t feel tired at all. Instead, he was excited. He felt the flaws in his saber art disappearing. Even under his 'sense,\u201d the saber art was slowly being perfected.Swoosh.Another Saber Drawing Stance. The saber beam was like a crescent moon. It stirred the Heaven and Earth powers slightly, causing the saber beam to flash in a fleeting, dreamlike-manner.Meng Chuan\u2019s movements were fifty percent faster than usual. He felt like he was flying, almost as if the wind was lifting him. In a blink of an eye, he could travel more than thirty feet. He stopped in his tracks, but his heart was burning. I sense the existence of \u201cForce.\u201d I\u2019m just a tiny step away from it.Ever since I reached the Unity realm, I\u2019ve been slicing apart arrows eight thousand times a day. I\u2019ve cultivated diligently for more than a year and a half, and today, I finally felt \u201cForce.\u201dI will definitely make a breakthrough in a few days. Meng Chuan felt that tonight was truly wonderful.Every day, he cleaved apart eight thousand flying arrows with the Saber Drawing Stance, seeking to cleave apart the flying arrows earlier and moving the marks on the tree higher. With his feelings being infused into his favorite saber art, and an incomparably robust foundation\u2026 The effects of Meng Chuan\u2019s cultivation for the 18 months was actually excellent because he had a direction to work towards. It was probably more efficient than the training the ancient Godfiend, Deng Feng, had done back in his day.In the past year and a half, he wasn\u2019t too far away from comprehending \u201cForce.\u201d Although the closer one was to a bottleneck, the slower one\u2019s growth was, Meng Chuan\u2019s comprehension of \u201cForce\u201d would be a given if he continued diligently cultivating for another year or so.But tonight\u2019s transformation made his saber arts take another step forward and instantly touch \u201cForce.\u201dA breakthrough was naturally much closer.\u2026It was still pitch-black. It was fifteen minutes past four in the morning.The Eastcalm Prefecture City morning bell sounded. Many people who came to the city for business were already waiting outside the city gates.Rumble! The gates to Eastcalm Prefecture City opened. The hawkers who carried their goods entered the city one after another, followed by laborers. At this moment, two figures were amongst the crowd, easily entering the city.The two entered the city, and a fatty wearing a hat chuckled. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been to the prefecture city for half a year. Brother, we must have fun. Living in the mountains was such torture.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, let\u2019s get down to business first. Convert those treasures into banknotes! After we\u2019re done with business, we\u2019ll have time to have fun. We\u2019ll return to the fort after ten days of fun,\u201d said another bearded man.\u2026After practicing his saber arts the entire night, Meng Chuan finally stopped.He had cultivated from night to dawn without feeling mentally tired, but he was physically exhausted. He had cultivated for more than eight hours, and his stomach was rumbling.He first brushed his teeth and washed his face before having breakfast.Gulp! Gulp! Meng Chuan held a huge bowl of porridge and took a few large mouthfuls before leisurely taking a bite of some pastry.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen he was done eating three large pieces of pastry, his father, Meng Dajiang, walked into the hall and laughed. \u201cChuan\u2019er, you are having breakfast rather early today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the same.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded and enjoyed the meal. \u201cOh yeah, Dad, I have something to tell you later.\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t telling me at the meal table? You have to wait till after?\u201d Meng Dajiang laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re being mysterious.\u201dMeng Chuan smiled and said to a maidservant, \u201cAnother bowl of porridge.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d The maidservant immediately left to fill a bowl with porridge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why are you being so secretive?\u201d Meng Dajiang came to the training grounds and sat down. The training grounds were spacious and empty. With nobody near them, there was no fear of eavesdroppers.\u201cDad.\u201d Standing there, Meng Chuan pointed at his glabella and asked in a low voice, \u201cHave you heard of an empty space in between the eyebrows?\u201d Meng Chuan really wanted to figure out what the space between his eyebrows was. If he didn\u2019t know a thing, he might one day engage in some sort of forbidden cultivation and suffer.In terms of trust, there was no doubt that Meng Chuan trusted his father the most!\u201cThere\u2019s space between our eyebrows?\u201d Meng Dajiang was puzzled. \u201cChuan\u2019er, I don\u2019t quite understand what you mean.\u201d\u201cJust like our dantian,\u201d said Meng Chuan. \u201cOur dantian is filled with an empty void that can nourish our Quintessential Energy. It\u2019s the same for the space behind the glabella. There\u2019s also a space there, and there\u2019s even a tiny person hiding inside.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never heard of it.\u201d Meng Dajiang shook his head. \u201cChuan\u2019er, why did you suddenly ask this? Where did you hear it from?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not hearsay.\u201d Meng Chuan said solemnly, \u201cIt\u2019s because I can inwardly see a space between my eyebrows. The void is vast, and there\u2019s a tiny translucent person inside. That person looks identical to me.\u201dMeng Dajiang\u2019s pupils constricted. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Meng Dajiang pressed.\u201cVery good, very good,\u201d said Meng Chuan. \u201cI feel like I have been reborn. When I close my eyes, I can sense everything within a hundred feet. I can even clearly sense the presence of ants and the bristles on their legs. Within half a kilometer radius, I can sense the aurae of all life. I can even sense the aurae of those cats and dogs.\u201d\u201cYou can \u2018see\u2019 everything within a hundred feet around you even with your eyes closed? You can sense an area of half a kilometer?\u201d Meng Dajiang found it inexplicable. \u201cChuan\u2019er, did you obtain some special cultivation formula that you are secretly cultivating?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shaking his head, Meng Chuan said, \u201cI\u2019ve never touched any other formulae. After I was done drawing yesterday, I felt a little dizzy. Then, I saw the space between my eyebrows through my inner sight.\u201d\u201cIt sounds good, but it might be dangerous. Don\u2019t be careless,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cLet\u2019s go and meet your grandaunt.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u2026Fairy Meng was heavily injured, and she did not have many days left to live. She cared the most about Meng Chuan since he was the Meng family\u2019s hope.To use all the family clan\u2019s treasures to exchange for a drop of the Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid, and to transfer all the credit she had accumulated to Meng Chuan\u2019s name willingly showed how important he was to her. It could be said that for Meng Chuan\u2019s sake, she could even sacrifice her life.Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan trusted her deeply.Inside the ancestral mansion.\u201cGrandaunt,\u201d greeted Meng Chuan respectfully.\u201cMeng Chuan, why are you here?\u201d Sitting in the yard, Fairy Meng put down her book and said with a smile, \u201cYou practice eight thousand repetitions of the Saber Drawing Stance every day. It\u2019s rare for you to come to me so early in the morning.\u201dMeng Dajiang immediately said, \u201cSomething special happened to Chuan\u2019er.\u201d\u201cSpecial?\u201d Fairy Meng\u2019s heart tightened as she asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cGrandaunt, I looked at myself inwardly last night and discovered a space between my eyebrows. It\u2019s similar to the space in the dantian. There\u2019s a space between my eyebrows, and there\u2019s a tiny person inside. It looks exactly like me.\u201dFairy Meng\u2019s expression changed slightly. \u201cA space between your brows? I\u2019ve never heard of it before either.\u201d\u201cAunt, you haven\u2019t heard of it before either?\u201d Meng Dajiang was shocked.Fairy Meng had been a Godfiend for about eighty years. She had quite a number of Godfiend friends, so her knowledge was naturally much comprehensive. Yet, Fairy Meng had never heard of the matter regarding the glabella space. It was unbelievable.This meant that it was very rare! Extremely rare!\u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. Meng Chuan, what changes did you experience after you discovered the space between your eyebrows?\u201d inquired Fairy Meng.\u201cChuan\u2019er said that when he closes his eyes, he can clearly see the surrounding hundred feet. Even an ant\u2019s legs and the bristles on them can be seen clearly. Furthermore, he can sense all living creatures\u2019 aurae within half a kilometer.\u201d Meng Dajiang explained as Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cClose your eyes and see a hundred feet? You can sense half a kilometer?\u201d Fairy Meng was puzzled. \u201cHave you released your Quintessential Energy?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t figured out \u2018Force\u2019 yet, so I can\u2019t release my Quintessential Energy,\u201d said Meng Chuan.\u201cI know you are unable to release your Quintessential Energy.\u201d Fairy Meng shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m also good at reconnaissance. I can probe five kilometers with a thought, but that\u2019s because of my Godfiend body. Furthermore, I can only probe five kilometers through a special formula that depends on releasing Quintessential Energy. As for you, you didn\u2019t use any methods to sense aura within half a kilometer of you. I\u2019ve never seen or heard of it before.\u201dMeng Chuan was confused.\u201cYou can detect my aura?\u201d inquired Fairy Meng.\u201cGrandaunt\u2026\u201d Meng Chuan could see Fairy Meng\u2019s clothes on the surface with his naked eyes, but when he closed his eyes, he felt like Fairy Meng had become a humanoid sun. The terrifying aura made it difficult for him to see her clearly.\u201cGrandaunt, your aura is too strong. I can\u2019t see it clearly,\u201d said Meng Chuan. \u201cHowever, your aura is stronger than all other living beings\u2019 aura within half a kilometer combined. I can sense it, and it\u2019s as dazzling as the sun. It\u2019s hard to look directly at it, but it\u2019s extremely eye-catching.\u201dFairy Meng thought for a moment and softly said, \u201cI have never heard of the glabella space, but I\u2019ve heard of something.\u201dMeng Dajiang and Meng Chuan listened carefully.\u201cHumans have souls. You should have heard of them,\u201d said Fairy Meng.\u201cYes,\u201d Meng Chuan and his father tersely answered. The soul\u2019s existence was common knowledge.\u201cBut do you know where the soul is?\u201d asked Fairy Meng.The two shook their heads.\u201cI heard from a good friend that a soul is located in the sea of consciousness,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cA soul takes human form and is identical to one\u2019s physical body. Back then, I asked about the whereabouts of the sea of consciousness. Back then, he only pointed at his head and said that he didn\u2019t know much about it either. He only knew that this is related to more powerful Godfiend cultivation.\u201d\u201cThe soul is related to even more powerful Godfiend cultivation?\u201d Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan were deep in thought.\u201cThe space between the eyebrows sounds very similar to the sea of consciousness,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cIt just so happens that this tiny person is also in human form, and identical to your physical body. It might be your soul.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded slightly.\u201cOf course, this is just my guess,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cIt might be true, or it might be wrong. You can\u2019t fully trust me on that.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded, but he already felt like he had gained a lot. It turned out that people had seas of consciousness and souls within the sea of consciousness. This was related to more powerful Godfiend cultivation.\u201cBoth of you have to keep this matter a secret. If it\u2019s truly a joyous matter, that will be great. If it\u2019s exposed\u2026 there might be trouble,\u201d said Fairy Meng.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cIf there are truly supreme geniuses, the Skydemon Sect would think of ways to assassinate them.\u201dThe Skydemon Sect was selfish and was only concerned about their own interests.However, if a peerless, earthshaking genius appeared, the demons would reward them if a successful assassination was carried out. This was enough to prompt the Skydemon Sect into risking their lives to assassinate him.There were ultimately too few geniuses who could be considered earthshaking, ones that could influence the overall situation between the humans and demons. For people like Mei Yuanzhi, the Skydemon Sect didn\u2019t even care\u2026 He hadn\u2019t even succeeded in passing the initial entrance assessment at Archean Mountain, spelling out clearly what Mei Yuanzhi\u2019s threat was. If his luck was a little bad, he might die on the battlefield and not even become a Godfiend. A so-called genius like Meng Chuan, who hadn\u2019t figured out \u201cForce,\u201d could only be considered dazzling in Eastcalm Prefecture. The demons didn\u2019t pay him any attention.\u201cAll you need to do is keep it a secret and continue your cultivation as per normal. Then, you can enter Archean Mountain,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cArchean Mountain is the most ancient land of cultivation. Once you enter Archean Mountain and read the books it has, I believe you will know the secrets about the glabella space.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOkay.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Keep it a secret. Cultivate well,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.\u201cYou should figure out \u2018Force\u2019 as soon as possible,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cThe sooner you figure it out, the better. It\u2019s best if you can succeed in Core Condensation. The deeper one\u2019s accumulation, the greater the chances of entering Archean Mountain. That Mei Yuanzhi gained insight into \u2018Force\u2019 at 20. Although he took a gamble\u2026 the chances of success were slim. In the end, he failed. You will need to figure out \u2018Force\u2019 by the age of nineteen. Your chances of entering Archean Mountain will increase with an additional year of preparation and robust Godfiend foundation.Meng Chuan really wanted to say that he was confident that he could achieve \u201cForce\u201d within the next few days. But having not achieved it yet, he felt that it would appear as though he was bragging.I\u2019ll tell Dad and Grandaunt after I figure out \u201cForce.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Leave everything to nature.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded.\u201cLet nature take its course. In your cultivation, you will naturally be able to grasp a portion of its uses,\u201d said Fairy Meng with a smile. \u201cThis is the safest method. Once you enter Archean Mountain and find manuals regarding it, you will understand how to use it completely.\u201d\u201cYes, Grandaunt,\u201d Meng Chuan replied respectfully. This was also the reason why he asked his father and grandaunt about this. It was an unknown power. Without the experiences of his predecessors, experimenting on his own would be too dangerous!Now that he had the confidence to grasp Force in a short period, there was no need to take the risk.\u201cAlso, you have to keep the glabella space a secret.\u201d Fairy Meng swept her gaze across the father and son. \u201cWe definitely can\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the father and son replied.\u2026After visiting his grandaunt, Meng Chuan returned to Mirror Lake Meng Manor and continued with his eight thousand repetitions of the Saber Drawing Stance.In the training grounds.A guard with a crossbow stood on the tree branch and aimed at the ground.As he stood dozens of feet away, Meng Chuan\u2019s saber remained inside the scabbard.This feeling is completely different from the past. Meng Chuan could clearly sense the movements of the guard on the tree. The guard first looked at his young master, and the muscles in his hands began to tense up. Then, he pulled the trigger with his finger. During the process of pulling the trigger, Meng Chuan clearly sensed the moment the arrow inside the crossbow was fired.Whoosh.The moment the guard\u2019s fingers moved, Meng Chuan\u2019s figure flashed.When the flying arrow flew out, a blade beam streaked across the air, hitting the red dot on the arrow shaft.\u201cAh!\u201d The guard jumped in fright as the saber beam flew at him. It came very close to the repeating crossbow in his hand.\u201cThis, this\u2026\u201d The guard was frightened. Even the other guards and servants who were watching were shocked.Had the arrow been sliced the moment it was fired? The distance was too close.Warriors also had reaction times. Average reaction times allowed a flying arrow to fly some distance.\u201cThis is a prediction.\u201d Seeing how shocked the guards were, Meng Chuan casually made up a reason. \u201cMa San shot this crossbow countless times. When I predicted that he would fire the arrow, I immediately attacked\u2026 Indeed, the moment the flying arrow flew out, I immediately hit it.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, your prediction is really accurate.\u201d Everyone praised him.Meng Chuan smiled.Predictions required rich experience and also some luck. This was because a powerful warrior\u2019s actions were blurry under the naked eye. For example, how long would a Marrow Cleansing guard take to pull the trigger? Besides, with the robe and tree branches concealing him, even if one could vaguely see the guard\u2019s actions with the naked eye, it would be too late to act.Meng Chuan was different.He was able to 'sense\u201d everything in an extremely detailed manner. The changes in the guard\u2019s gaze and how he prepared to pull the trigger\u2026 everything was extremely clear.There was no need to predict; he could attack the moment he 'saw\u201d it.If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll be able to hit an arrow every time it flies out. It\u2019ll be hard for me to train my saber arts. Hmm, I have to set rules for myself. I have to wait until the arrow is released before attacking. He made up his mind. He had always pursued speed and accuracy when it came to the Saber Drawing Stance!\u201cAgain,\u201d Meng Chuan instructed.\u201cYes.\u201d Ma San immediately composed himself. It had been terrifying to see the saber beam fly past him.Swoosh.He fired another flying arrow. Meng Chuan still saw the entire process clearly. However, he only drew his saber and attacked when the arrow was shot out.With his movement technique, the ethereal saber beam had already sliced through the red spot on the arrow shaft. The saber beam landed on the tree trunk wrapped in metal and left a mark.Young Master didn\u2019t make any predictions. Only then did the guards and servants calm down. This was normal! This was how their young master had attacked in the past when he did eight thousand daily repetitions of the Saber Drawing Stance.He had started his daily repetitions of the Saber Drawing Stance a little later today because he had gone to the ancestral mansion. It would probably be afternoon by the time he finished.\u2026Eastcalm Prefecture. At an ordinary residence.A fat man wearing a hat and a bearded man came to the door and knocked on it.The door opened, and a simian-looking man glanced outside. He immediately smiled and said, \u201cSecond Lord Zhao, please come in.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d The bearded man responded tersely. With a smile, the fat man followed behind his second brother.The simian-looking man led the two into the residence and arrived at a hall.\u201cBrother Zhao.\u201d A silver-haired elder in the hall smiled as he cupped his hands together. A subordinate stood behind him.\u201cHave the stewards received all my goods?\u201d The bearded man sat down casually, while the fat man sat to his side.\u201cWe received them. I received the goods in three batches. According to the 50% discount, it will be 16,800 taels of silver. Rounding up, it\u2019ll be 17,000 taels of silver,\u201d said the silver-haired elder with a smile. \u201cBrother Zhao, are you satisfied?\u201dThe bearded man nodded slightly. \u201cThose are ordinary goods. I still have a few valuable goods.\u201d\u201cPlease, do tell.\u201d The silver-haired elder\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cThe first one is a jade horse.\u201d The bearded man took out a wooden box. When the wooden box was opened, a jade horse placed on its side could be seen. The jade horse was slightly bigger than his palm and was milky-white and warm. However, the white jade horse\u2019s surface strangely emitted a red luster.\u201cThis is an ornament that\u2019s carved from top-grade jade. It should be something that a Godfiend treasured. It might have been placed on a Godfiend\u2019s desk. After spending a long time together, the aura of a Godfiend has already been infused into it.\u201d The silver-haired elder nodded slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s not very helpful for cultivation, but it\u2019s indeed a rare item. I can give you 5,000 taels of silver for it.\u201d\u201c5,500 taels,\u201d said the bearded man.\u201cAlright, as you wish, Brother Zhao. 5,500 taels.\u201d The silver-haired elder laughed.Following that were the second, third, and fourth treasures. Together, they cost a total of 20,000 taels of silver. Each item was rare.\u201cThis is the last item. This is a real treasure,\u201d said the bearded man seriously. As he spoke, he took off his coat and robe. He then took out the mysterious item wrapped in cotton cloth.The silver-haired elder observed carefully.The bearded man unwrapped the cotton cloth, and immediately, a rich, domineering aura emanated.\u201cA Godfiend aura? Could it be a Godfiend legacy?\u201d The silver-haired elder had some guesses, but when he saw the item within, he frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s so small? Why aren\u2019t there any words?\u201dThis was a broken piece of black metal. It was only the size of a palm. Even an ordinary page of a Godfiend legacy would be the size of normal paper.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d asked the silver-haired elder.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dThe big-bearded man said, \u201cThis black metal piece doesn\u2019t have any words on its surface. It doesn\u2019t have any moves. At the same time, it\u2019s damaged as well. However\u2026 the Godfiend aura it emanates is extremely domineering. It\u2019s much stronger than the remnant pages of ordinary Godfiend legacies.\u201d\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a tiny fragment of a Godfiend weapon,\u201d said the silver-haired elder with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m willing to offer 3,000 taels.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be a weapon.\u201d The bearded man shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s very flat, like a piece of paper. I can\u2019t imagine any weapon to have such a fragment.\u201d\u201cHave you tried accepting the legacy?\u201d asked the silver-haired elder.Godfiend legacies allowed one to immerse themselves within to see the moves of Godfiends. It passed on the legacy through intent.For example, the remnant page of the Godfiend saber art Third Elder had given Meng Chuan was a legacy passed down through intent.\u201cNo.\u201d The bearded man shook his head. \u201cThe few Seamless realm experts in our fort have tried all methods, but none have worked.\u201d\u201cThen this isn\u2019t a Godfiend legacy,\u201d said the silver-haired elder with a smile. \u201cAlthough the Godfiend aura is extremely dense, I won\u2019t offer more than 5,000 taels for an item that doesn\u2019t have any use\u2014even if it\u2019s related to Godfiends.\u201d\u201c100,000 taels of silver,\u201d said the bearded man. \u201cNot one penny less.\u201d\u201c100,000 taels?\u201d The silver-haired elder widened his eyes. \u201cA true Godfiend legacy\u2019s fragmentary page does cost more than 100,000 taels. However, you are unable to accept the legacy at all. You don\u2019t even know what it is. Why would you ask for such a high price?\u201d\u201cFirstly, the Blood Cloud Bandits paid quite a sizable price for this black metal piece. Secondly, given its extremely powerful Godfiend aura, it must be extraordinary,\u201d the bearded man said. \u201c100,000 taels was a price set by my elder brother. If you want it, you have to pay 100,000 taels.\u201d\u201cWait here. Let me ask my master,\u201d said the silver-haired elder as he nodded at his subordinate.\u201cAlright.\u201d The bearded man and the fat man waited patiently.Soon\u2014An elegant man walked over.\u201cBrother Zhao.\u201d The elegant man smiled as he nodded. At the same time, he glanced at the black metal piece and hesitated. \u201cCan I take a look?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d The bearded man nodded.The elegant man gently stroked the black metal piece after he held it in hand. After looking at it for a long time, he said, \u201cIndeed, the aura of a Godfiend is extremely strong, but it\u2019s very likely a fragment of a powerful Godfiend\u2019s personal belongings. It might not be of any use at all. I can offer 20,000 taels of silver at most for the gamble.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already said that it\u2019s 100,000 taels, nothing less,\u201d said the bearded man.\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing we can do about that.\u201d The elegant man shook his head gently.\u201cSure.\u201dThe big-bearded man nodded with a smile. \u201cWe will stay in Eastcalm Prefecture for a few days. If you change your mind, you can find us again. You know very well how to find us.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The elegant man nodded.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis is the 38,000 taels of silver in banknotes that we previously agreed on.\u201d The silver-haired elder placed a stack of silver notes there. The bearded man flipped through them after taking them. Each note had a face value of 1000 taels of silver, so there were a total of 38 notes.\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to leave. There\u2019s no need to send us off.\u201d The bearded man led the fat man away.The elegant man watched them leave before he frowned, and said, \u201cButler Fang, quickly draw the black metal piece and make it look identical. After you\u2019re done, we\u2019ll visit the Branch Master.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the silver-haired elder replied respectfully.The elegant man pondered. The Branch Master might be able to identify what that treasure is.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36: Power of the SoulCKtalonCKtalonAt the Mirror Lake Meng Manor.Meng Chuan only finished his 8000 Saber Drawing Stance repetitions in the afternoon due to his visit to his grandaunt in the morning.After lunch, he rested for two hours. Only then did he start his second training in his daily routine: defensive saber arts and movement techniques!\u201cFire,\u201d a servant commanded.Immediately, ten Mortal Shedding realm experts fired simultaneously! Following that was a second unit, then a third unit.Three units of experts continuously shot arrows.As Meng Chuan\u2019s Godfiend foundation grew more robust, his strength was rising. The arrows shot out by Marrow Cleansing realm guards were like cotton to him. Therefore, the Meng family spared no expense to gather thirty experts at the Mortal Shedding realm to help in his training. Fortunately, the Meng family had many members, so the thirty experts included Meng family members other than the original guards. Every afternoon, they would come and help him for an hour.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! One arrow after another shot out.Meng Chuan stood there, finding it very magical. He could clearly see the dark red patterns on each of the Scarletblood Blackiron arrow shafts. Every single arrow\u2019s trajectory and the collisions between them didn\u2019t escape Meng Chuan\u2019s notice.Nothing could hide from him within a hundred feet.Meng Chuan took a step to the left and stood still. Nine arrows flew past him, and some arrows flew past the edges of his hair while others flew past his waist. Only one arrow flew towards his chest; he swung his saber and deflected the arrow with ease.Meng Chuan just needed one step to the left and one deflection to deal with ten arrows.It\u2019s so easy. Meng Chuan stood in a circle that was about ten feet in diameter and did not move very quickly. However, the arrows flew past him without touching him. He would only wave his saber occasionally.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhy is Young Master looking so relaxed?\u201d The thirty experts were also shocked.I know the trajectory of the arrows the moment they are fired. I can immediately figure out which spots are safe. Meng Chuan found this very strange. It was as if everything in a hundred-foot radius was his domain. He could easily predict all the trajectories, making it extremely easy to dodge the arrows.\u201cStop,\u201d Meng Chuan suddenly shouted.The thirty Mortal Shedding realm experts also stopped to look at Meng Chuan.\u201cMove forward twenty feet.\u201d\u201cTwenty feet?\u201d One of the Meng family members said hurriedly. \u201cThis distance is too close. We are only fifty feet away from you. You won\u2019t have time to react if we shoot at such a close range. In my opinion, we should start by shrinking the distance by ten feet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s try it out first,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile. \u201cListen to me, shrink the distance by twenty feet.\u201dNobody refuted Young Master Meng\u2019s words. After all, there were no arrowheads, and they were wrapped in cloth. Nothing could happen.Whoosh! The thirty Mortal Shedding realm experts immediately walked forward twenty feet.\u201cFire.\u201dThe crossbow triggers were pulled, and arrows pierced through the air.Their strength was simply too great. The weaker guards could muster up to 2,500 kilograms of strength, and the stronger guards could muster almost 5,000 kilograms of strength. One could imagine how fast their arrows were.At such a short distance, even though Meng Chuan could sense everything within a hundred feet and his Lightning Divine Body was extremely fast, he instantly felt the pressure!Previously, he had been so relaxed because he had been able to determine the safer areas. This sort of \u201cdetermining\u201d happened extremely quickly, but it still required some time. At such a close range, Meng Chuan didn\u2019t have time to determine the safe areas calmly. He had to rely on his instincts and his movement technique to dodge or fend off the arrows with his saber art. Everything relied on instinct.They were too close! There was no time to think!Dodge!Block!Under this pressure, he relied on his 100-foot domain to dodge with all his might. However, there were still arrows that he couldn\u2019t block or dodge.An arrow shot towards his lower abdomen.Block! Meng Chuan wanted to block it, but he was too slow. He watched the arrow about to hit his abdomen.Whoosh.Under his intense desire to dodge, an invisible force surged into his saber. His saber instantly moved a little faster. With a \u201cpfft,\u201d he blocked the arrow.Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!Arrows rained down, fast and furious.Faster, faster. Meng Chuan tried his best to dodge.Boom!The invisible force merged into every part of his body.Dong! Dong! Dong! His heart beat loudly, and his organs turned extremely clear. Blood flowed like a river, and every muscle in his body was clearly visible.In an instant, his perception and control over his body had become much greater.His body, mind, and technique became one! He unleashed the potential of his body.At that moment, his fusion of body, mind, and technique reached a profound state. His heart pumped blood, and all his organs were operating at their limits. His muscles also erupted with strength as his Quintessential Energy perfectly circulated. In an instant, every operation and circulation in his body was perfect, and his ability to utilize potential was much greater than before.Swoosh.He instantly felt his body become much lighter and more agile. He easily dodged the arrows. If he was willing, he could raise his pure speed by a great deal.This feeling is simply too wonderful. I almost feel omnipotent. The refined control over his body had Meng Chuan slightly entranced. However, the invisible force that was fusing into his entire body was also draining him intensely.In just a few seconds, he felt dizzy.\u201cStop!\u201d Meng Chuan shouted immediately.Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!There were still three arrows that hit him. He grimaced in pain.\u201cImpressive.\u201d The Mortal Shedding experts who had been shooting arrows were dumbfounded. They had fired seven consecutive times at such a close distance. Yet, Meng Chuan had actually blocked all the arrows only to be hit by three arrows at the end.\u201cTruly impressive.\u201d\u201cThis movement technique is extremely strange. Despite all these arrows, none of them managed to hit you.\u201d\u201cIt did eventually, though.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already very impressive that he could dodge them. Meng Chuan must have figured out some powerful movement technique, but it seems like he hasn\u2019t fully figured it out yet. In the end, he was hit in succession.\u201d The Mortal Shedding experts were both impressed and delighted. Most of them were members of the Meng family, while the rest of them had served the Meng family for a long time. The more powerful Meng Chuan was, the prouder they were.\u201cThat\u2019s all for today. I want to reflect on my cultivation,\u201d Meng Chuan said.\u201cYes.\u201d Everyone smiled in response.\u201cYoung Master\u2019s movement technique has improved tremendously. He should have gained some insight.\u201d\u201cCultivation is very important. It is also very important for one to comprehend it in silence.\u201d They chatted excitedly as they left. The servants were also dismissed. Meng Chuan was the only person left in the training grounds.What kind of strength was that just now? Meng Chuan was a little excited.Just now, I was using all my strength to block that arrow since I was in a dire situation. There was actually an invisible force that infused into my saber art, raising its might by 50 percent. Not only that, the invisible force fused with my entire body when I was dodging the rest of the arrows. The feeling of having such control over my body was simply too wonderful. My strength instantly increased to a whole new level.The fusion of body, mind, and technique provided a surge in strength, speed, and the perfect circulation of Quintessential Energy. Most importantly, he hadn\u2019t suffered any injuries at all. All he did was unleash more of his body\u2019s potential.This invisible force is invisible to the naked eye, but it appeared due to my intense will. Is it related to the glabella space? Meng Chuan had some guesses. When the invisible force is fused with the saber, the energy expenditure isn\u2019t that great. However, when it merges with my body, the consumption is ten times greater. I could barely last a few seconds.But this is already very strong. Meng Chuan couldn\u2019t forget the wonderful feeling of having such control over his body. This power is mysterious and unknown. I\u2019ll temporarily call it the \u201cPower of the Soul.\u201d\u2026In a deep underground tunnel at night.The elegant man led the silver-haired elder. Soon, they saw a huge door. Pushing it open revealed an empty hall. There were two maidservants standing inside.\u201cI want to meet the branch master,\u201d the elegant man said.\u201cLord Li, please wait a moment. I\u2019ll send the message right away,\u201d a female attendant said with a smile. She then turned to enter a side door to report.The elegant man and the silver-haired elder waited silently.Moments later.A hunchbacked man walked out from the side door. The maidservant followed behind him respectfully. The hunchbacked man was the Skydemon Sect expert from Idle Stone Garden, who had nearly killed Meng Chuan and Yan Jin.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGreetings, Vice Branch Master Gao,\u201d the elegant man and the silver-haired elder greeted respectfully.The person with the highest standing in the Skydemon Sect Eastcalm branch was the branch master, followed by the two vice branch masters.The vice branch master was a Seamless realm expert who had long comprehended the concept of Force. Furthermore, due to his cultivation of various demonic arts, his techniques were also sinister and challenging to deal with.\u201cBranch Master and Second Brother Tu are both cultivating in seclusion. I\u2019ve been in charge of the branch matters for the past half-year.\u201d The hunchbacked man walked into the hall and sat down casually. He glanced down at the two people and said, \u201cSpeak, what can\u2019t you settle by yourselves?\u201d\u201cThe Bloody Cloud Bandits want to sell us a treasure.\u201d The elegant man took out a scroll and passed it to the maidservant beside him. The maidservant then gave it to the hunched-back man. \u201cIt\u2019s the black metal piece as depicted in the painting.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He frowned as he looked at the black metal piece drawing.The elegant man continued, \u201cThis black metal piece doesn\u2019t have any illustrations or text, but it possesses a mighty Godfiend aura. It\u2019s much stronger than the remnant auras of a typical Godfiend legacy. We are ultimately mortals and limited in our knowledge. I\u2019m afraid we might miss out on a treasure.\u201d\u201cThen buy it.\u201d The hunchbacked man frowned as he looked at the picture.\u201cThe Blood Cloud Bandits want 100,000 taels of silver, not one tael less,\u201d said the elegant man respectfully.\u201cWhat the heck? One hundred thousand taels for something we have no idea about? The Blood Cloud Bandits have really gone crazy.\u201d The hunched man shook his head. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m aware of this matter. You may leave.\u201d\u201cThen, do we buy it?\u201d the elegant man asked.\u201cAre you paying for it?\u201d The hunchbacked man glared.\u201cI understand,\u201d said the elegant man respectfully. \u201cI won\u2019t make decisions on my own.\u201d He immediately led the silver-haired elder away.The two vice branch masters of the Eastcalm Branch had strange tempers, and their subordinates were quite afraid of them. On the contrary, the branch master was a lot more worthy of respect.What the hell? So what if it\u2019s a Godfiend legacy? We can\u2019t accept a Godfiend legacy if we cultivate the Skydemon Dao. The hunchbacked man looked at the scroll in his hand and scoffed. He then threw it to the maidservant beside him. \u201cWhen Second Brother Tu and Branch Master exit seclusion, let them take a look.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said the maid respectfully.\u2026Night.After completing his cultivation and taking a medicinal bath, Meng Chuan\u2019s spirit and body were restored to their peak states.He came to his small courtyard and began the fourth part of his daily cultivation\u2014Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance! Over the past year, he had pushed his Quintessential Energy to its limits every day, allowing his meridians to adapt slowly. His Godfiend body was very adaptable, and his meridians were very resilient as well. He could instantly unleash twelve times the amount of Quintessential Energy now that his meridians were wider and stronger.The might of his attacks came from the combination of his technique, physical body, and his Quintessential Energy, and body potential to ultimately release tremendous might.The strength of his saber art only doubled despite using twelve times the Quintessential Energy. In the past, this could be considered a killer move under the premise of not damaging one\u2019s body! Meng Chuan was unwilling to use certain forbidden Godfiend arts. For example, the eldest son of the Yun family\u2014Yun Fucheng\u2014had used a forbidden technique without any preparation. Thus, damaging his foundation and leaving him with no hope of becoming a Godfiend.Now that I have the Power of the Soul, I can try to push the limits of the Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance even further. His eyes lit up.Following that, he focused his mind. With a powerful will, the invisible Power of the Soul immediately fused with his entire body. Quintessential Energy began to slowly flow through his meridians, organs, bones, and blood. All his senses heightened, and his control over his body immediately rose to an inconceivable level.He was shocked by this feeling every time.When would he be able to control his body to such extents without the aid of his Power of the Soul?Boom!In an instant, fifteen times his Quintessential Energy erupted. Under the guidance of his Power of the Soul, the Quintessential Energy remained tolerable to his meridians. His body began to form large amounts of lightning, several times more than the usual density. When the lightning formed within his body, Meng Chuan\u2019s speed reached an unimaginable level. Speed was the strength of his Lightning Divine Body. As he dug deeper into his body\u2019s potential, his speed increased to a ludicrous degree.Even his strength\u2014which was one of his weaker traits\u2014had increased several times.Whoosh.A resplendent saber beam streaked across the sky as it tore through the air. The saber beam flew dozens of feet and struck the stone wall, leaving behind a mark.He stopped.The Power of the Soul disappeared, immediately stopping its insane expenditure. By only using the Power of the Soul when delivering an attack, he would use less of it up.This attack expended about twenty percent of my Power of the Soul. Meng Chuan nodded slightly. It looks like five killer moves are my limit. Let\u2019s try again.He wanted to familiarize himself with his strongest killer move. He stared ahead, as though there was a demon in front of him. He wanted to slay this demon and to do so needed strong killing intent. Only by uniting his body and mind would the fusion be deeper.\u201cKill!\u201dHe unleashed another terrifying saber beam.\u201cKill!\u201dHe pursued the limits and perfection. When the Power of the Soul fused with his entire body, he tried to find a way to dig out more of his body\u2019s potential. He felt like his body was like a massive iceberg, and what he dug out so far was just the tip of the iceberg. According to the Godfiend biographies, even the most powerful Godfiends wouldn\u2019t dare say that they had already excavated their body\u2019s potential to the limits.As cultivation continued, one\u2019s physical body would grow stronger.\u201cKill!\u201dHe found the joy of not holding back absolutely delightful. With the addition of his Power of the Soul, he was even more absorbed with his training.His strength converged as he prepared to strike. When he delivered a strike, all his strength would be unleashed under the Power of the Soul\u2019s guidance. His will was like a blade, and the moment he struck out, he could kill all demons!Boom! A terrifying aura coalesced around Meng Chuan\u2019s body. His entire body seemed to become a saber. His body and Quintessential Energy united perfectly under the guidance of the \u201cForce,\u201d resulting in an even more terrifying eruption.The saber flashed, leaving behind a crescent moon in the air. It was soul-stirring.The saber beam was too fast, and the high-pressure slash formed a very sharp saber beam. It tore through the yard wall that was dozens of feet away, causing the wall to collapse.Following that, he sheathed his saber and stood upright.This is Force? Meng Chuan was rather surprised. He had predicted that he would be able to gain insights into Force within days, but he hadn\u2019t expected to achieve Force as he was fusing the Power of the Soul with the Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance today. He had achieved Force with his fourth strike.There were many descriptions regarding Force in the books. However, no matter how descriptive, he would only be able to understand Force the moment he grasped it.Everything in the world had Force\u2014mountains, water, earth, wind, fire, and sky. Even the entire world\u2026 had a Force! A truly powerful saber art required a Saber Force. With Saber Force, one would be like a saber. Under the control of the Saber Force, one\u2019s body\u2019s potential would be excavated deeper. One would even be able to use the Heaven and Earth powers to augment themselves.Under the command of Force, one\u2019s mastery of Quintessential Energy would become more exquisite. This allowed one to release Quintessential Energy outside their bodies when fighting.What\u2019s going on? This is Force?Inside the Mirror Lake Meng Manor, Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai rushed out of their rooms in shock. They all felt a Force appear within their manor. This made them panic because they knew that they were the only ones in the manor that had achieved Force. For a third person to suddenly use Force in the middle of the night? There was a high chance that the person was an intruder.An enemy sneaked in? Or did he figure out Force? It\u2019s from Chuan\u2019er\u2019s residence. Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai were both anxious as they rushed over.In the blink of an eye, the two of them rushed into Meng Chuan\u2019s courtyard and saw him standing still dazedly with his saber sheathed. One of the walls of the courtyard had collapsed, and rubble was everywhere.\u201cMight I know which friend has come to my Meng Manor? Please show yourself!\u201d Meng Dajiang immediately shouted when he saw this.\u201cI didn\u2019t notice him; he\u2019s quite good at hiding.\u201d Liu Yebai secretly sent a voice transmission. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t hurt Meng Chuan, so he probably isn\u2019t hostile.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBoth of them were very cautious.\u201cDad, Uncle Liu, there\u2019s no one else.\u201d After regaining his senses from embracing his achievement of Saber Force, Meng Chuan hurriedly informed Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai.\u201cThere\u2019s no one else?\u201d Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai were both stunned.\u201cThat unfamiliar Force just now was\u2026?\u201d Meng Dajiang looked at his son and had a bold guess in his heart! No, no, no. I must be overthinking things.Meng Chuan nodded in acknowledgment. \u201cI figured out the Saber Force.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai stared at Meng Chuan blankly, speechless.A 16-year-old had comprehended the Force? A legendary genius was right in front of them?Five patrolling guards also rushed to the small courtyard. They had also heard the wall collapsing, but their speed was clearly much slower than Meng Dajiang\u2019s and Liu Yebai\u2019s.\u201cMaster,\u201d said all five guards respectfully. The guard captain looked at the collapsed wall and couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cThis wall\u2026\u201d\u201cI was sparring with Chuan\u2019er and accidentally damaged it.\u201d Meng Dajiang returned to his senses and immediately instructed, \u201cArrange for someone to mend the walls tomorrow morning. Hurry up and leave.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe five guards bowed respectfully and left. At the same time, they were rather perplexed. To destroy a wall in a sparring match? Master and Young Master sure are good at causing trouble.Silence returned to the courtyard again. Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai continued to stare at Meng Chuan.\u201cDad, Uncle Liu.\u201d Meng Chuan couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cThe two of you\u2026\u201d\u201cDajiang, your son is extraordinary,\u201d Liu Yebai whispered. \u201cHe figured out Force at the age of sixteen. Heavens, entering Archean Mountain is almost a certainty. If I had such a powerful son, I would wake up from my dreams in laughter!\u201dAt this moment, Meng Dajiang suddenly thought of many things. His wife had instructed him to teach Meng Chuan personally while he practiced the saber. He had taught him every day since he was young, and the young Meng Chuan had trained seriously as well. His foundation was very solid, and he had taken one step at a time. When he was fifteen, he finally began to shine.He had become the most outstanding member of the five Godfiend family clans.At the age of sixteen, he had comprehended Force. This put him at the top of Eastcalm Prefecture.Meng Dajiang\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but redden. He knew very well how hardworking his son was. He smiled, and his eyes turned moist. \u201cVery good, very good.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all you can say?\u201d Liu Yebai asked.\u201cDad.\u201d Meng Chuan looked at his father as well. He had been diligent in his cultivation. Apart from his oath to become a Godfiend to slay demons, he also wanted his father to feel proud. As a son, making his father proud was one of his desires.Meng Dajiang smiled and immediately took out a flare. He triggered it, and the flare shot into the sky. It was very eye-catching in the dark.\u2026The Meng family ancestral mansion.\u201cOh?\u201d Fairy Meng walked out of her building with her walking stick. She stared at the flare in the distant sky. She had personally given the distress flare to Meng Dajiang. It had her Quintessential Essence branding in it, allowing her to sense it once it was activated within fifty kilometers.\u201cWhy would Dajiang suddenly request for help?\u201d Although Fairy Meng was puzzled, she vanished from the yard.\u2026In about half a minute, Fairy Meng arrived at Mirror Lake Meng Manor. She came to the small courtyard and saw the collapsed wall. She saw the father and son duo, as well as Liu Yebai.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Fairy Meng looked at the collapsed wall and felt a little puzzled. \u201cDajiang, you don\u2019t seem to be suffering any injuries. Why did you suddenly request for help?\u201dShe had only given only five people the distress flares; two people were Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang.\u201cAunt.\u201d Meng Dajiang\u2019s face was filled with uncontrollable joy. He whispered, \u201cChuan\u2019er has figured out Saber Force.\u201dFairy Meng was stunned for a moment before her eyes lit up. She looked at Meng Chuan and asked, \u201cYou have figured out Saber Force?\u201d\u201cYes, Grandaunt,\u201d said Meng Chuan respectfully.\u201cCan you show it to me?\u201d asked Fairy Meng.Meng Chuan nodded his head and struck out with his palm. With the fusion of Saber Force, his Quintessential Energy cleaved out from his palm. A blurry saber beam that spanned ten feet in length sliced through the ground.\u201cQuintessential Energy Release.\u201d Fairy Meng\u2019s body trembled as she watched. Her eyes filled with excitement as she mumbled, \u201cGreat, great! Wonderful, just wonderful.\u201dQuintessential Energy was formless in the first place, so it couldn\u2019t leave the body without a medium. But once Force guided it, it would be like a gentle stream of water forming a sharp 'saber,\u201d causing a qualitative change.More potential could be excavated if the body was fused with Saber Force.Fairy Meng put down her walking stick and closed her eyes, muttering softly. \u201cThe ancestors have blessed us.\u201dMeng Chuan, Meng Dajiang, and Liu Yebai fell silent. They didn\u2019t disturb Fairy Meng.\u201cMeng Chuan.\u201d Fairy Meng opened her eyes and sat down on a stone bench. She smiled and said, \u201cCome, have a seat.\u201dMeng Chuan sat down on the stone bench obediently.Fairy Meng looked at Meng Chuan, her eyes filled with love. She said with a smile, \u201cI wasn\u2019t wrong about you. You figured out the Force at the age of sixteen. Even in the capital of the Great Zhou Dynasty, you will be considered a genius. As long as you don\u2019t slack off for the next few years, you will definitely be able to enter Archean Mountain.\u201d\u201cI definitely won\u2019t slack off,\u201d said Meng Chuan immediately.\u201cHowever, don\u2019t be too proud. You must understand that there\u2019s always someone better than you!\u201d Fairy Meng said with a smile. \u201cFor example, the Fifth Young Master of King Calm Sea\u2019s family. He is famous throughout the world. He reached the Unity realm at the age of ten. He comprehended Force at the age of thirteen and became a Godfiend when he was fifteen. Even the demons were afraid of his talent and offered a bounty for his assassination. Archean Mountain also placed great importance on him. When Fifth Young Master comprehended Force at the age of thirteen, he was immediately recruited into Archean Mountain.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve read many Godfiend biographies.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. \u201cBut compared to those invincible Godfiends who left their names in history, my talent is ordinary. I won\u2019t be proud.\u201d\u201cHaha, good ambition. You actually compare yourself to those powerful Godfiends who left their names in history,\u201d said Fairy Meng with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have ambition, but it\u2019s best to keep the news about you comprehending Force a secret for now. Let\u2019s wait until next year to announce it. It will be much less shocking for a seventeen-year-old to comprehend Force.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.To comprehend Force at the age of sixteen made him a genius even in the capital. To comprehend Force at seventeen-years-old would make him more inferior. He could still be considered a genius in a prefecture\u2014comparable to Patriarch Zhang.If he only comprehended Force when he was eighteen or nineteen? It was already a question whether he could enter Archean Mountain or not. If he had comprehended Force when he was twenty years old? He would be at the level of Mei Yuanzhi\u2014barely qualified to participate in the entrance examination\u2014the chances of entering Archean Mountain were really slim.\u201cFrom today onwards, I will be staying here,\u201d said Fairy Meng with a smile. \u201cI will often come to train Chuan\u2019er.\u201d\u201cAunt, your body\u2026\u201d Meng Dajiang was a little worried.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Sparring with you wouldn\u2019t aggravate my injuries.\u201d Fairy Meng smiled.\u201cThank you, Grandaunt,\u201d said Meng Chuan respectfully.Fairy Meng glanced at Liu Yebai beside her and said, \u201cLiu Yebai, you must keep Meng Chuan\u2019s matter a secret.\u201d\u201cI can vouch for Yebai with my life,\u201d Meng Dajiang said.\u201cFairy, don\u2019t worry. I watched Chuan\u2019er grow up. He\u2019s like my own child. It will naturally be kept a secret,\u201d said Liu Yebai.Only then did Fairy Meng nod.\u2026Days passed.Meng Chuan continued to cultivate hard. True experts never stopped climbing higher. Decades were like days.Seven days after Meng Chuan comprehended Force.\u201cHmm, I sure had a good time eating.\u201d Liu Qiyue was very pleased as she strolled around with Meng Chuan at night.\u201cIt was my treat. How could you not be happy?\u201d Meng Chuan pouted.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, great Young Master Meng? Are two meals too much for you?\u201d Liu Qiyue harrumphed.\u201cMy family\u2019s Cloud River Restaurant is the number one restaurant in Eastcalm Prefecture. Yet, you refused to eat there and chose other restaurants. I had to spend a lot of money at those restaurants.\u201d\u201cNo matter how delicious the Cloud River Restaurant is, you can\u2019t always eat at that one restaurant, right?\u201d Liu Qiyue said, \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll treat you tomorrow. Will that do?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d Meng Chuan said in satisfaction. Suddenly, his eyebrows rose, and he stared into the distance.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Liu Qiyue was puzzled.\u201cQiyue, you head back first. I saw a friend,\u201d said Meng Chuan. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later.\u201d\u201cOh, sure. Don\u2019t stay out too late.\u201d Liu Qiyue nodded and left.Meng Chuan looked into the distance. He could sense all life aura within half a kilometer. About a quarter kilometer away, he could sense two vicious and bloody aurae. These aurae were stained with many lives! Meng Chuan had once scrutinized the hands of an executioner. Even the bloody aura on those hands wasn\u2019t as thick as these two aurae.This sort of bloody aura seemed to be filled with the screams of countless living beings. It was extremely unique in his senses, making him feel even more disgusted.How many people have they killed to have such bloody aurae? But these two auras aren\u2019t too strong.Meng Chuan strode forward.He soon arrived outside a brothel.Azure Cloud Brothel? Meng Chuan stared at the brothel in front of him. The lights inside were splendid, and there were many people inside. There was also pleasant laughter from women. Many wealthy businessmen were being led inside.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis is my first time entering a brothel. Meng Chuan walked in.\u201cYoung Master, please,\u201d the gigolo at the door said obsequiously.Suddenly, the old procuress\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYoung Master Meng?\u201d\u201cYoung Master Meng?\u201d Immediately, some of the brothel girls who were soliciting the guests turned their heads and saw Meng Chuan walking in.\u201cIt\u2019s Young Master Meng Chuan?\u201d The atmosphere in the brothel instantly boiled. The women in the brothels were all infatuated with him as they passionately approached him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had never been this nervous even when facing demons.\u201cDon\u2019t disturb me.\u201d Meng Chuan remained expressionless as he spoke.\u201cYou grasping girls, move aside. Don\u2019t disturb Young Master Meng,\u201d said the old procuress immediately. \u201cYoung Master Meng, please come upstairs. Please come upstairs.\u201dThe old procuress had sharp eyes. She could tell that Young Master Meng didn\u2019t think much of these ordinary courtesans. After all, the ones in charge of solicitation were the ordinary ones. The ones that were genuinely ranked within the Azure Cloud Brothel didn\u2019t easily show their faces.A scion of a Godfiend family\u2014who had extreme talent and chances of becoming a Godfiend\u2014would usually be surrounded by servants and maids. Without sufficient looks, they probably couldn\u2019t attract Young Master Meng at all.This genius from the Meng family has never been to a brothel before. This should be his first time. If he becomes infatuated with a lady from our Azure Cloud Brothel\u2026 If news of this spreads, my Azure Cloud Brothel\u2019s reputation will definitely increase greatly, right? The old procuress led Meng Chuan to the best room on the second floor.\u201cYoung Master Meng, this room is the best. You can see the performing girls the closest here,\u201d said the old procuress with a smile.\u201cOkay.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded slightly and sat down. He was only twenty feet away from the stage below the window, and there was a direct view of the stage.At this moment, two young ladies came in from outside the door, holding trays of drinks, fruit, and snacks.\u201cServe Young Master Meng well,\u201d instructed the old procuress.\u201cYes.\u201d They were twins who had yet to develop fully. They were very delicate, and their eyes were bright. Their faces were slightly red as they looked nervously at Young Master Meng Chuan.The old procuress smiled and said, \u201cYoung Master Meng, these two young girls are only 16. They have always been learning the trade from their teacher, and have never served guests. Today is the first time they are serving guests.\u201dMeng Chuan\u2019s status was just too high. A pair of twins that had yet to finish their studies could only serve him as maids. If Meng Chuan were to take a liking to the twins and wanted to take them away, Azure Cloud Brothel would be very happy. No matter what kind of status Young Master Meng Chuan had, he would never dine and dash.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d The two girls sat down next to Meng Chuan and helped him pour wine.\u201cYoung Master Meng, if there\u2019s anything you need, just instruct them.\u201d With that said, the procuress left the private room with a smile and closed the door silently.\u2026At this moment, in another private room on the second floor of Azure Cloud Brothel.Only the fat man and the bearded man were drinking in this room. Neither of them wanted anyone to serve them.\u201cWith that Young Master Meng Chuan coming, all the women below went crazy.\u201d Inside the private room, the fat man scoffed. \u201cWe wanted to use the most central private room, but Azure Cloud Brothel wouldn\u2019t allow us to enter! Once this Young Master Meng came, they immediately gave him the best room. Also, look at that pair of twins. Tsk, tsk\u2026 they are truly excellent. I\u2019ve been having fun the past two days, but I\u2019ve never seen these twins before. It looks like Azure Cloud Brothel has hidden some good stuff. It\u2019s just not for us.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard of Meng Chuan before.\u201d The bearded man leisurely sat there. \u201cHe is a genius of one of the five great Godfiend clans, the Meng family. He reached the Unity realm at fifteen. He is a famous figure in the entire Eastcalm Prefecture. You have to behave yourself and not provoke him.\u201d\u201cI understand. You said that we should keep a low profile in Eastcalm Prefecture and not cause trouble.\u201d The fat man chuckled. \u201cActually, a soft-skinned person like Meng Chuan will be quite a pleasure.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d The bearded man frowned.The fat man shut his mouth and only smiled.\u201cIt seems we won\u2019t be able to sell the item,\u201d the bearded man said calmly. \u201cLet\u2019s have two more days of fun before leaving Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201d\u201cBack to the mountains again? It\u2019s so boring there,\u201d the fat man muttered. \u201cI\u2019m going to have fun tonight.\u201d\u2026Meng Chuan drank as he watched the performance below.On the stage below, a blue-dressed woman was wearing a thin face veil. She carried a lute in her arms. The sound of the lute could be heard flowing through the brothel. The surrounding wealthy merchants and distinguished guests\u2019 voices were soft.Although Meng Chuan seemed to be listening to the lute, he was actually using his hundred-foot perception to observe the other private room on the second floor.Within this domain, everything was extremely clear.He could even \u201chear\u201d the sound of mosquitoes, not to mention the conversation between the bearded man and the fat man. Although they had lowered their voices and the private room had soundproofing, Meng Chuan could still \u201chear\u201d them.Leave Eastcalm Prefecture and enter the mountains? Meng Chuan fell deep in thought. Are they bandits?\u201cSister Guan\u2019s lute performance is one of the best in our Azure Cloud Brothel.\u201d One of the girls who was serving Meng Chuan spoke in a clear voice. \u201cHer teacher is Old Mister Wang of our Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded slightly.Just like artists, there weren\u2019t many people who were focused on music in this era. A few years ago, Meng Chuan had become the number one expert in painting. Not to mention how People Resonance had elevated his skill to a whole new level.There were slightly more people who learned the lute and other musical instruments, but they were only used for entertainment. In this era, cultivation was ultimately ranked first, while entertainment enjoyed a very limited status.\u201cThe two of us study the zither. We also learned it from a master,\u201d said the other girl with a softer voice.\u201cThe zither is not bad.\u201d Meng Chuan casually commented as he continued observing the two men.Bearded man, fat man\u2026He could see the bristles on an ant\u2019s leg within a hundred feet, so he could naturally observe the two very carefully. Every single strand of facial hair was extremely clear.Oh? Meng Chuan noticed that the fat man didn\u2019t disguise himself, but the bearded man had disguised himself.Fake beard? A wig? Artificial skin is plastered across his face? Without the hair and beard, he would look like\u2026 Meng Chuan\u2019s heart stirred. As a member of a Godfiend family clan, he was familiar with the wanted fugitives in Eastcalm Prefecture.He immediately thought of someone. Blood Hand Zhao Can.The bald, skinny savage man had a black mole on his left cheek. However, the fake skin covered the black mole.This was considered an impressive disguise technique. Even from a close distance, one couldn\u2019t tell that it was fake skin. Only with Meng Chuan\u2019s 'senses\u201d could he clearly identify the wig and fake skin. Under his perception, he could see the damage and flaws of what appeared to be a smooth strand of hair to the naked eye. This made him a natural enemy of disguise techniques.It\u2019s him? The killing intent in his heart soared.Blood Hand Zhao Can.He was from Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s Qin County. To cultivate the Blood Fiend Hand, he had killed over three hundred people in a few years, causing everyone in Qin County to panic. Later on, he successfully escaped when this was made known. After being placed on the wanted list by the imperial government, he joined the infamous Blood Cloud Bandits. The weakest of the Blood Cloud Bandits was said to be at the Mortal Shedding realm.Their numbers weren\u2019t high, but they were all considered powerful bandits. They were crafty and intelligent. They hid in the mountains at the border of three prefectures, making it difficult for them to capture them.Blood Hand Zhao Can. Meng Chuan narrowed his eyes and stood up.\u201cYoung Master Meng?\u201d The two girls stood up in puzzlement.\u201cSomething cropped up.\u201d As he spoke, he took out a banknote worth a hundred taels of silver and placed it on the table. Although he had never been to this place before, he had heard of it before. Such a famous brothel would cost at least twenty taels of silver for a private room. This was the best private room, and they had arranged for two girls to serve him\u2026 Of course, with him only sitting there for a while, leaving behind a hundred taels of silver was definitely to Azure Cloud Brothel\u2019s benefit.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The two girls looked at each other in dismay. To be able to accompany this scion of the Meng family, whose name was known throughout Eastcalm Prefecture made them extremely happy. In fact, they even had a bit of hope\u2014they hoped that Young Master Meng would be able to redeem them.They didn\u2019t expect him to leave so quickly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMeng Chuan exited the private room.He headed straight for the private room where the two great bandits were in. Ignoring the sins of the Blood Cloud Bandits, just the 300 lives claimed in the Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s Qin County alone made Meng Chuan unable to suppress his killing intent. He had witnessed the slaughter committed by demons and how people in despair were killed. After experiencing that, his killing intent for wanted criminals whose hands were stained with blood was no less than that for demons.Or rather, these serious offenses made them demons in human form.Both of them deserve to die. He had already reached the entrance of the private room when he pushed open the door.The two bandits\u2014who were drinking and enjoying the performance in the private room\u2014turned their heads in anger. When they saw the scion walk in, they were somewhat shocked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were somewhat wary, but they still welcomed him with a smile on their faces. They didn\u2019t wish to cause any trouble in Eastcalm Prefecture. The bearded man cupped his hands and said with a smile, \u201cGreetings, Young Master Meng. For you to come to our room, I wonder if you have any instructions for these brothers?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to kill!\u201d When the calm voice rang out, a saber beam lit up.This strike was too fast!Now that he was already at the late-stage of the Mortal Shedding realm and had a robust Godfiend foundation, his Godfiend Body was no weaker than an ordinary Seamless realm cultivator. Furthermore, having already figured out Saber Force, even if he didn\u2019t use it, the fusion of body, mind, and technique was enough for him to unleash even greater amounts of his body\u2019s potential. Being most adept at speed, that single slash caused the two bandits in the room to instantly feel their hearts chill.Not good. Both of them knew that something was amiss, but the slightly weaker fat man failed to react in time as the saber beam sliced through his throat.Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! The fat man clasped his throat, but the blood kept spewing out. His face became awash with terror and despair as he felt his life slipping away rapidly.\u201cWhat?\u201d The bearded man was a Seamless realm expert. His reaction was much faster, having leaped out of the window the moment Meng Chuan struck out with his saber. He knew very well that exchanging blows with Meng Chuan was meaningless. He needed to flee as fast as he could once his identity was exposed in Eastcalm Prefecture.The more time passed, the more powerful experts would arrive. His chances of survival would become slim.Meng Chuan killed the fat man with a single slash. His figure phased away as he dashed out of the window in pursuit of Blood Hand Zhao Can. These two bandits could forget about escaping today!\u201cWhat happened?\u201dMany guests and women in Azure Cloud Brothel\u2019s main hall watched as a figure flew out from a private room on the second floor. A faster figure soon followed the first. A saber beam streaked across the air, heading towards the first figure..Before he landed, Blood Hand Zhao Can had worn a black glove. His hands suddenly grew in size as though they were fans. With palms that were twice the size of a normal person\u2019s, he struck out with a mystical move and blocked the strike.Clang!Zhao Can felt a powerful force pass through his arm into his body. His body involuntarily slammed onto the floor of Azure Cloud Brothel, causing a huge crater to form on the wooden floor. He sent splinters flying into the air.The other guests had already quickly retreated. Cultivation was a very common thing. It was very common for people to engage in brawls in places like brothels. Battles normally happened because of jealousy, meaning physical injuries the worst outcome. However, it seemed like this battle was different.\u201cIt\u2019s Young Master Meng.\u201d The guests and courtesans watched from afar as they saw the scion land on the ground.The usually modest young scion was now filled with killing intent. The killing intent in his eyes caused everybody to tremble in fear.\u201cYoung Master Meng, don\u2019t go too far. If you push me into a corner, I\u2019ll make sure you die with me,\u201d said Zhao Can with a ferocious expression as he stood up.\u201cYou want me to die with you?\u201d Meng Chuan walked over. \u201cDo you think you have what it takes?\u201d\u201cHumph.\u201d Zhao Can charged towards the crowd to capture hostages.Whoosh.Meng Chuan turned into a phantom the moment his Lightning Divine Body erupted. He became much faster than Zhao Can. Before the latter could hold someone hostage, another slash came cleaving right at him.Pfft. Zhao Can blocked with both fan-like hands. A perfect defense that continued for Meng Chuan\u2019s next two strikes.But following that was the third strike.He seems to be a bit stronger than me? I can\u2019t be held back by him. I have to think of a way to escape. It\u2019s night time now\u2026 as long as I can escape from him in the darkness, I\u2019ll have a chance to escape from Eastcalm Prefecture.Whoosh.The third strike remained as fast as before.Just as Zhao Can was about to block the attack, he realized that the saber beam had turned faint. His combat instincts honed over the years made him instinctively retreat, but the faint saber beam slashed him horizontally! It almost sliced across his neck.Pfft!One of his arms flew up.My arm. Zhao Can\u2019s eyes turned red. Although he had managed to dodge the terrifying saber strike, Meng Chuan had still managed to slice off his arm.Escape! Escape! Escape! Zhao Can suppressed his hatred. At this moment, he didn\u2019t hesitate to unleash a forbidden Godfiend technique. Instantly, his skin reddened, and he began to release his Quintessential Energy to his limits. Instantly, his speed and strength increased by a great deal, but the longer this state persisted, the more danger he would be in. The damage ranged from injuries to his meridians that would take a year or so to recover to heavily damaging his organs and dantian. Such injuries might cripple him.However, if he didn\u2019t use a forbidden Godfiend technique, certain death awaited him.Boom! He completely unleashed the forbidden technique. Zhao Can frantically slammed into the nearest wall. Tables and chairs along the path shattered, and a huge hole opened up in the thick wooden wall. He immediately charged outside.In order to survive, he didn\u2019t even have time to go through the door or the windows. Instead, he charged into the wall.\u201cHumph!\u201d Unstained by any blood, the saber-wielding Meng Chuan moved, transforming into a blur as he pursued Zhao Can through the gaping hole.Many of the customers in Azure Cloud Brothel heaved sighs of relief and looked outside through the windows. Many of them stared at the gloved arm on the ground in amazement.\u201cThe person who was being pursued earlier on seems to have the strength at the Seamless realm.\u201d\u201cYet, his strength is still inferior to Young Master Meng Chuan.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Meng is from a Godfiend family clan. His Godfiend foundation is naturally much stronger. Furthermore, from the looks of it, Young Master Meng\u2019s saber arts are exquisite.\u201d\u201cIndeed\u2026 Young Master Meng\u2019s saber arts have probably reached the peak of the Unity realm. In another year or two, there\u2019s a chance he will comprehend Force. How can an ordinary Seamless realm compare with him?\u201d As the guests discussed, some people boldly came to the severed arm and carefully took off the black glove. They saw the blood-red palm that was twice as large as an ordinary person\u2019s.\u201cBlood Fiend Hand?\u201d\u201cThere are still people who cultivate such evil martial arts? Could it be Blood Hand Zhao Can?\u201d\u201cBlood Hand Zhao Can, he\u2019s the second-in-command of the Blood Cloud Bandits. He\u2019s an expert at the Seamless realm. Yet, he\u2019s being pursued by Young Master Meng Chuan. Young Master Meng\u2019s saber arts are truly formidable. He might really be able to comprehend Saber Force in another year or two.\u201d\u201cHow can such an ordinary Seamless realm expert compare with geniuses like Young Master Meng?\u201dThere was a flurry of discussion in the brothel. There were quite a few daring people who went out to chase after the duo, but clearly, they were not as fast as Meng Chuan or Zhao Can\u2014who had cast a forbidden technique.How did I expose myself? Eleventh Sister\u2019s disguising techniques are already superb. No one can see through me. Could it be a slip of the tongue by that idiot or those courtesans? Zhao Can was filled with hatred and anxiety as he ran as fast as he could.Meng Chuan chased after him.After chasing for half a kilometer, the surroundings became quiet.Swoosh! Meng Chuan\u2019s speed suddenly increased dramatically.What a joke.Having cultivated the Lightning Divine Body and comprehending Force, the speed he could unleash far exceeded Zhao Can\u2019s. Zhao Can remained inferior despite using the forbidden Godfiend technique. Many people had been watching in Azure Cloud Brothel, so Meng Chuan had only used 30% of his strength, making him appear slightly stronger than Zhao Can. He had used 50% of his strength when cleaving off Zhao Can\u2019s arm. His grandaunt had instructed him to wait until next year to reveal that he had comprehended Force.In front of others, he naturally had to keep a low profile.What? Realizing that Meng Chuan\u2019s speed had suddenly increased, Zhao Can was driven to the brink of insanity. How can this be?The rapidly approaching Meng Chuan was a blur. Even the Seamless realm Zhao Can couldn\u2019t make his figure out. He suddenly realized that a saber beam was coming towards him, so he raised his left hand to block it.The saber beam changed direction. It was extremely ghostly.The beam passed through one of his legs, and a leg flew up.Without using Saber Force, Meng Chuan could only use 50% of his strength. This strike contained 50% of his strength, but he had also imbued Power of the Soul into it, causing the saber beam to speed up by 30% as it approached Zhao Can. This caused Zhao Can to lose a leg despite casting the forbidden Godfiend technique.Zhao Can fell to the ground. He had already lost an arm and leg. He revealed a look of despair. His control over his body as a Seamless realm expert allowed him to reduce the bleeding from his leg and arm stumps.\u201cYoung Master Meng, I don\u2019t have any enmity with you. There\u2019s no need for you to kill me,\u201d said Zhao Can immediately. There was no way for him to dodge with one leg missing. He had also lost an arm. Killing him was too easy. However, Zhao Can still wanted to live!He was an expert at the Seamless realm. Even if he lost an arm and leg, he could still live comfortably.\u201cOh? Didn\u2019t you also take the lives of over three hundred people when you had no enmity with them?\u201d Meng Chuan walked towards Zhao Can.\u201cI have silver and treasures.\u201d Zhao Can immediately took out a thick stack of silver notes with his left hand. \u201cThere\u2019s nearly 40,000 silvers worth of banknotes here. Also, this is a Godfiend treasure.\u201dZhao Can took out the black metal piece wrapped in cloth. \u201cThis Godfiend treasure is worth 100,000 taels.\u201dHe didn\u2019t say that the Blood Cloud Bandits had wanted to sell it for 100,000 taels but had failed to obtain a buyer.\u201cThese are yours. All yours, Young Master Meng,\u201d said Zhao Can immediately. \u201cAs long as you spare my wretched life.\u201d\u201cUsing something on you to beg for mercy?\u201d Meng Chuan continued walking over.\u201cI\u2019m the second-in-command of the Blood Cloud Bandits. I know the location of one of its treasure troves,\u201d said Zhao Can immediately. \u201cAs long as you spare me and let me go, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201dPfft.A saber beam flashed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen Meng Chuan came close, he imbued his saber with the Power of the Soul and easily cut Zhao Can\u2019s neck.\u201cYou, you\u2026\u201d Zhao Can\u2019s eyes widened. Why didn\u2019t he give him a chance to live?\u201cI don\u2019t care about the treasures of you bandits,\u201d said Meng Chuan calmly as he watched Zhao Can die.The Blood Cloud Bandits were powerful, with eight Seamless realm bandits, and a leader who grasped Force among them. However, that leader\u2019s strength was barely on par with Meng Chuan\u2019s. How could a bandit\u2019s wealth be worth anything compared to the Meng family\u2019s? Meng Chuan thought nothing of it. The valuable treasures he had used to build his Godfiend foundation was worth countless times more than the Blood Cloud Bandits\u2019 entire wealth.Meng Chuan reached out to pick up the stack of banknotes and looked at the black metal piece that had been exposed. A Godfiend item? It seems to be very damaged. He did not think much of it and temporarily put it away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It spread out in all directions and could be heard for several miles. This whistle was used to gather the surrounding members of the Meng family. Only a hundred people with relatively higher status in the family clan possessed this whistle. Ordinary clansmen only had the standard-issue distress flares. They could activate the distress flare at critical moments, a signal that caused clansmen nearby to rush over and provide assistance.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! One figure after another arrived.\u201cYoung Master Meng Chuan?\u201d Most of the figures who arrived were experts working for the Meng family. A small number of them were members of the Meng family. The Meng family was large and powerful, so it employed many experts.\u201cThis is the corpse of the Blood Cloud Bandits\u2019 second-in-command, Blood Hand Zhao Can.\u201d Meng Chuan pointed at the corpse in front of him. \u201cThere\u2019s also a Blood Cloud Bandit\u2019s corpse in Azure Cloud Brothel. Take care of it.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d everyone replied in unison.Meng Chuan nodded and left.At this moment, the group of gathered people started discussing.\u201cBrother Wang, take some men to the Azure Cloud Brothel and deal with the Blood Cloud Bandit corpse. Also, find out what Young Master Meng Chuan did in the Azure Cloud Brothel,\u201d an elder instructed. This elder was one of the nine exterior stewards of the Meng family. He enjoyed a rather high status in the Meng family, and his family had served the Meng family for three generations. Those who were placed in important positions despite not sharing the Meng surname were naturally talented.On the contrary, if the members of the Meng clan were mediocre, they would at best not starve to death. Their status was far inferior to that of the exterior chief steward.\u201cYes.\u201d Immediately, over ten people headed to the Azure Cloud Brothel.\u201cBlood Hand Zhao Can, a Seamless realm expert.\u201d The elder looked at the corpse on the ground and exclaimed in surprise, \u201cYoung Master Meng Chuan is really becoming more powerful.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Meng Chuan is still at the Mortal Shedding realm. To be able to kill someone of a higher cultivation realm, he must have reached the peak of Unity. He isn\u2019t too far from comprehending Saber Force.\u201d The others around him exclaimed in amazement as well.\u2026News of Meng Chuan killing two Blood Cloud bandits\u2014with one of the deceased being Blood Hand Zhao Can\u2014spread quickly. Azure Cloud Brothel was a place where people came and went, so many people paid attention to it. There were even some people who tried to follow the pursuit to watch \u201cMeng Chuan vs. Blood Hand Zhao Can,\u201d but they were just unable to keep up.When Meng Chuan later blew the whistle, he had attracted many curious bystanders apart from the Meng family personnel. Many people personally saw Zhao Can\u2019s corpse.\u2026Inside a private room in another brothel.Yun Fu\u2019an was chatting with a friend, and there was also a beautiful courtesan waiting by his side. At this moment, the door opened, and another middle-aged man walked in with a smile.\u201cBrother Zhang, we\u2019ve been waiting for you for almost an hour,\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an said with a smile. \u201cYou need to drink as a forfeit!\u201d\u201cYou all know about my tigress wife at home. There\u2019s nothing I could do about it. I only managed to sneak out until now.\u201d The middle-aged man smiled as he sat down. He raised his head and downed a cup of alcohol. Next to him, a beautiful courtesan immediately filled his cup. The middle-aged man excitedly continued, \u201cThere\u2019s a big piece of news I want to share with the two of you.\u201d\u201cWhat big news?\u201d asked another rich-looking man casually as he embraced a courtesan.\u201cAbout two hours ago, something big happened at Azure Cloud Brothel,\u201d the middle-aged man said. \u201cThat Meng family\u2019s Meng Chuan went to the Azure Cloud Brothel\u2026\u201d As he spoke, he even glanced at Yun Fu\u2019an.Yun Fu\u2019an\u2019s eyelids twitched.\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal with him going to Azure Cloud Brothel?\u201d the wealthy-looking man said with a smile. \u201cOnly half of those serving in the military manage to return alive. And most of them return with disabilities. It\u2019s common to go to a brothel before they serve the military.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t go to Azure Cloud Brothel for the women, but for two men,\u201d the middle-aged man said smugly. This stunned Yun Fu\u2019an and the wealthy-looking man.The middle-aged man continued, \u201cThey were two senior Blood Cloud Bandits. Meng Chuan went to the Azure Cloud Brothel and killed one bandit first. Then, he pursued another infamous bandit\u2014Blood Hand Zhao Can.\u201d\u201cBlood Hand Zhao Can?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an and the wealthy-looking man were alarmed.Zhao Can had one arm sliced off at the scene. He then immediately fled in panic. Meng Chuan chased after him for about half a kilometer and killed him,\u201d the middle-aged man said in amazement. \u201cHe\u2019s impressive. Really impressive.\u201dYun Fu\u2019an couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cHe can kill Blood Hand Zhao Can? That\u2019s an expert at the Seamless realm. I estimate Meng Chuan to at most be at the late-stage of the Mortal Shedding realm.\u201d\u201cCould he have comprehended Force?\u201d the middle-aged man guessed.\u201cImpossible.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an immediately said, \u201cIf he had comprehended Force, all those people at Azure Cloud Brothel would have identified it. The news would have already spread throughout the city by now if that were the case.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s impossible for him to have comprehended Force.\u201d The wealthy-looking man added, \u201cHe only reached the Unity realm last year. How can he be that fast? If he really did\u2026 he should be able to kill Blood Hand Zhao Can in the Azure Cloud Brothel. And in fact, since he\u2019s adept at speed, for him to kill Zhao Can only after half a kilometer means that the difference between them isn\u2019t too great.\u201d\u201cWhat Brother Bai says makes sense.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an nodded.\u201cBoth your families know that Fairy Meng\u2019s severe injuries means that she can only live for a few more years,\u201d said the wealthy-looking man with a smile. \u201cWith him achieving the secret technique at fifteen, she will definitely try her best to groom him. With Fairy Meng\u2019s eighty years of experience as a Godfiend and all her grooming, Meng Chuan\u2019s Godfiend foundation must be very robust. Although he is at the late-stages of the Mortal Shedding realm, the gap between his physical body and Blood Hand Zhao Can\u2019s is probably not that great. Him being capable of suppressing Zhao Can is clearly because he\u2019s at a higher realm in saber arts. He should have reached the peak of the Unity realm. Perhaps he will be able to comprehend Saber Force in two to three years.\u201d\u201cComprehend Force within two or three years?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an snickered. \u201cBrother Bai, I admit that he\u2019s a genius, but it won\u2019t be that easy for his saber art to breakthrough. Perhaps he will only achieve Force after he\u2019s twenty.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate him.\u201d The wealthy-looking man shook his head. \u201cOur Bai family has been keeping tabs. Meng Chuan draws his saber and strikes crossbow arrows daily, doing it eight thousand times a day. It\u2019s said that he also cultivates in other ways\u2026 He\u2019s indeed extraordinarily diligent.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes. He\u2019s diligent. But if diligence is useful, there won\u2019t be so few Godfiends,\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an continued. If the engagement hadn\u2019t been annulled, he would naturally be happy to see Meng Chuan grow stronger. However, after annulling the engagement, he hoped that Meng Chuan would become as unpromising as possible. Most people were like that. If Yun Fu\u2019an could still compose himself under such circumstances, the Three Heroes of the Yun Family would have become the Four Heroes of the Yun family.\u2026The news caused an uproar in the outside world, and the Meng family clan was in an even more agitated, ebullient mood. There were heated discussions everywhere.At the Mirror Lake Meng Manor.\u201cChuan\u2019er, you went out to have dinner with Qiyue. When you were on the way back, you scurried off to kill two Blood Cloud Bandits?\u201d Meng Dajiang looked at his son, not knowing what to say.\u201cDad, you know that I can sense auras within half a kilometer,\u201d said Meng Chuan. \u201cI sensed the two bloody auras from a distance. The aurae were thicker than executioners\u2019 who specialize in beheading others at the government court. That\u2019s why I proceeded to carry out investigations. I heard their conversations from a hundred feet away and identified the disguised Zhao Can. Two Blood Cloud Bandits already deserve death, much less Blood Hand Zhao Can.\u201dMeng Dajiang nodded slightly.\u201cDad, don\u2019t worry. I didn\u2019t use Saber Force. All I used was strength slightly greater than Blood Hand Zhao Can\u2019s. I only killed him when there was no one around,\u201d said Meng Chuan. He could sense the surroundings of half a kilometer, so he knew very well if there was anyone else around.\u201cAlright.\u201dMeng Dajiang nodded with a smile. \u201cNow, people are saying that your saber arts have reached the peak of the Unity realm and that you aren\u2019t far from comprehending Saber Force. Sometime in the middle of next year, we can announce that you have achieved Saber Force. It will be considered quite natural. By the way, the government court has verified that it\u2019s indeed Blood Hand Zhao Can. The other deceased was checked for tattoos and has been identified as a Blood Cloud Bandit.\u201d\u201cThe cash and treasures they have on them\u2014as well as weapons when converted to silver\u2014 together with the Imperial Court\u2019s bounty amounts to a total of 160,000 taels.\u201d Meng Dajiang took out a stack of banknotes. \u201cThis is a gift from the family clan. Your spoils of war.\u201d\u201cZhao Can took out plenty of money to beg for mercy before he died,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile. \u201cDad, you don\u2019t have to give it to me.\u201d\u201cYour spoils of war will naturally be yours. You\u2019ve grown up, so you should deal with them yourself.\u201d Meng Dajiang the cash over.Meng Chuan had no choice but to accept it.Tens of thousands of silver taels\u2026 That was equivalent to the total wealth of wealthy families like the Zhou family. Even for the Blood Cloud Bandits, that was a huge sum of money.But to a Godfiend family like the Meng family, they thought nothing of it.\u2026He returned to his room and leaned against the bed. Under the night light, Meng Chuan flipped through the thick stack of notes. Including the money he had received from Zhao Can, there was a total of 50,000 taels of silver.Even at my age, the most I\u2019ve ever had on me was five thousand taels of silver. Meng Chuan sighed. Although he was famous and highly valued by the family, he didn\u2019t earn any money. The family gave him a small monthly allowance, and his father gave him some pocket money. He didn\u2019t spend much money, and over time, he had only accumulated five thousand taels of silver after all this while. He was far inferior to many wealthy businessmen.Yet, he had received so much in one day.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter taking a look, he casually put the money aside, and his gaze fell on the black metal piece wrapped in cotton cloth.Compared to the banknotes, he was even more curious about the Godfiend item. However, he didn\u2019t have many expectations. After all, it was too damaged.This damaged piece of black metal. Meng Chuan picked up the piece of black metal, and an incomparably domineering Godfiend aura spread out from the black metal piece. This prompted Meng Chuan to take a more careful look. Although his room was only lit by the moonlight, Meng Chuan didn\u2019t need to rely on his eyes to \u201clook\u201d at things. His senses penetrated every inch of the black metal piece.As he examined it, the piece of black metal had an invisible attraction that affected him.In an instant, he felt his consciousness being pulled into the black metal piece.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42: Lightning Devastator SaberAs his consciousness was drawn in, he saw a stalwart man with disheveled hair standing at the top of a mountain. The surrounding mountains stretched out afar as a river ran through the valley. The sun hung high in the sky.However, even those mountains, rivers, and sun seemed lacking in front of that man.From afar, the stalwart man looked in Meng Chuan\u2019s direction and finally picked up a rough black saber beside him. It was also very long.Boom!He looked coldly at Meng Chuan and swung his saber.A terrifying saber beam rapidly expanded in front of his \u201ceyes.\u201d In the face of this terrifying saber strike that could tear the world asunder, there was no way Meng Chuan could stop himself from feeling fear. It was the same fear that mortals had of being struck by lightning! This was a strike that was even more terrifying than heavenly lightning\u2026 but there was no way for Meng Chuan\u2019s consciousness to dodge. He could only endure it.Rumble\u2026 The saber beam struck his consciousness.\u201cAh.\u201d Meng Chuan suddenly extricated himself from the black metal piece. He clutched his head in pain, and blood flowed out from his nose. He let out an instinctive, painful grunt before losing consciousness.The night was very quiet.People in Mirror Lake Meng Manor didn\u2019t know that the Young Master Meng Chuan, who they were so proud of, had lost consciousness.Time slowly passed.Several hours later, Meng Chuan\u2014who had squirmed into a bunch\u2014slowly opened his eyes after his eyelids twitched.It hurts. Meng Chuan felt a splitting headache, and his memories were a mess. He didn\u2019t know who he was or where he was.Meng Chuan only snapped awake completely quite some time after he woke up. Last night, I investigated that black metal piece. My consciousness was pulled into it, and it hurt my head. Meng Chuan\u2019s headache was excruciating. He lay on the bed for a while before slowly getting up. However, when he sat up, he felt dizzy. He looked out the window. The sky had just become a little bright, and the moon could still be seen in the sky.It hurts so badly. Meng Chuan tried his best to stand up, but his body swayed before falling back into bed. He was unable to maintain his balance, and there was a throbbing pain in his head. He tried his best to focus, and thanks to the hard efforts of his will, he finally managed to stand up and walk.This black metal piece has really made me suffer. Right now, Meng Chuan didn\u2019t even want to obtain the legacy from the black metal piece. Just thinking was enough to make his head feel stabbing pain. It was clearly not the time to study the legacy.Gulp! Gulp! Gulp!After drinking two large bowls of cold water that he had kept through the night, he washed his face with cold water to snap himself awake.He pushed open the door and stood in the corridor, shouting, \u201cServants.\u201dA maidservant rushed to the yard\u2019s entrance. After entering, she respectfully said, \u201cYoung Master.\u201d\u201cPrepare some hot water. I want to take a bath.\u201dBathing in the morning? The maidservant was a little puzzled, but she didn\u2019t dare ask further. She respectfully said, \u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dSoon\u2014Several buckets of hot water filled a bathtub. After Meng Chuan dismissed his servants, he took off his clothes and soaked himself in the bathtub. He felt much better.Lying down was comfortable as his head hurt. In a daze, he fell asleep for a short moment. He felt much better once he woke up again.I\u2019m feeling much better. Only then did he look at his glabella space. He saw that the tiny translucent person standing there was much dimmer than before. It seems the damage was quite significant.He trembled slightly. The water in the bathtub had turned cold, so he immediately stood up and wiped his body before putting on clothes.When he came out, he instructed his servants, \u201cFor the next three days, I\u2019ll be stopping my cultivating. I need to meditate.\u201d\u2026\u201cYoung Master isn\u2019t cultivating?\u201d\u201cYoung Master splits eight thousand repeater crossbow arrows every day. He\u2019s actually stopping for three days?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been cultivating all this while. Meditating at times might bring about better effects. Moreover, he had killed two Blood Cloud Bandits last night.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. One of them was Blood Hand Zhao Can. I believe that the battle must have given the Young Master some insight. That\u2019s probably why he wants to meditate.\u201d The servants and guards were chatting.\u2026Killing two Blood Cloud Bandit members was easy; on the contrary, he was heavily injured by the black metal piece. However, Meng Chuan wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He realized his headache slowly subsiding as time went by. His control over his body gradually recovered.For the next three days, he spent his days in a relaxed manner. He read Godfiend biographies as he lay on a reclining chair and leisurely drew in the study.Completely relaxing sped up his recovery! He could tell with his inner sight that the translucent figure between his glabella was gradually regaining its former luster.On the third day, Meng Chuan began to study the information he received from the damaged black metal piece.The legacy I received was the seventeenth stance of the Lightning Devastator Saber, the Five Lightning Descent. It\u2019s not even a complete move? I didn\u2019t even manage to withstand a complete strike before I passed out? Meng Chuan laughed self-deprecatingly. He recalled that when his consciousness was brought into the black metal piece, a large amount of information had entered his consciousness when he was struck by that saber.However, his consciousness was only able to withstand a portion of it before falling into a coma. This was an instinctive form of protection.However, Meng Chuan still carefully studied the legacy\u2019s information. The information contained partial secrets to the seventeenth stance of the Lightning Devastator Saber.Every single word, every single diagram, and description contained boundless information, causing Meng Chuan to feel a sense of oppression.The strike of the Five Lightning Descent is actually a series of five strikes. The first strike is extremely terrifying, while the second one is even more powerful. Five consecutive strikes would result in a qualitative change in potency. The power is simply unimaginable.The legacy I received was only the first two strikes of the Five Lightning Descent; yet, that\u2019s already the most complicated saber art I have ever seen. Meng Chuan shook his head. The requirements for the physical body and Quintessential Energy were too high.\u2026His injuries were not completely healed, but he was no longer affected in his normal cultivation of the Saber Drawing Stance and movement techniques.Meng Chuan fully recovered two months after receiving the black metal piece\u2019s legacy. Only then could he activate the Power of the Soul again.He also made up his mind.Unless I have a qualitative change in my glabella\u2019s soul, I will not investigate the black metal piece again. Only after he had completely recovered did he begin to cultivate the first two strikes of the Five Lightning Descent.However, when he did so, he realized that he couldn\u2019t use it under normal circumstances. Having comprehended Saber Force, his control over his physical body and Quintessential Energy was considered high among mortals. Still, it was clear that he hadn\u2019t reached the threshold required by the two strikes. Only by using his Power of the Soul to infuse his body and raise his control over his physical body and Quintessential Energy could he barely execute the two saber moves.With a single slash, the lightning in his body would flash. This technique was a perfect match with the Lightning Divine Body.When he struck out with the two moves, lightning in his body surged together with his Quintessential Energy.Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have the secrets to the third saber move. All he could do was release the accumulated lightning and surging Quintessential Energy in his body as a third move.\u2026Time passed. Winter went, and spring came. Another year had passed.In the Skydemon Sect branch hall.Boom! A door slowly pushed open. A white-browed man walked out with his hands behind his back.\u201cBrother.\u201d The hunchbacked man and a muscular man revealed smiles.\u201cIn the past half-year that I\u2019ve been in seclusion, did anything major happen in Eastcalm Prefecture?\u201d the white-browed man asked.\u201cBrother, Eastcalm Prefecture is still the same as before. If something really major were to happen, we would have woken you up a long time ago.\u201d The muscular man laughed.\u201cOkay.\u201d The white-browed man nodded.The burly man seemed to recall something. He immediately took out a scroll and handed it to the white-browed man. \u201cBy the way, Brother, the Blood Cloud Bandits wanted to sell us a damaged black metal piece a few months ago. It didn\u2019t catch Brother Gao\u2019s fancy, but I do sense a powerful Godfiend aura from it. Could it be a fragment of the legendary Black Metal Sutra?\u201d\u201cThe Black Metal Sutra refers to Meteorite Metal. Did you check if it\u2019s Meteorite Metal?\u201d pressed the white-browed man.\u201cWhen I came out of seclusion, those two Blood Cloud Bandits were long dead. I didn\u2019t even have the chance to come into contact with that black metal piece,\u201d the muscular man said.The white-browed man nodded. He took the painting and unfurled it to take a look. The painting illustrated the damaged black metal piece, and its damaged appearance was very clear.\u201cI\u2019ll investigate.\u201d Although the white-browed man said so, he immediately headed towards his residence.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026In an underground study.There were many books placed here. The white-browed man took out a stack of paintings and flipped through several of them before finally pulling one out.In the painting, there were twenty-six pieces of black metal fragments. The white-browed man carefully compared the twenty-six black metal fragments that matched the black metal fragment in the painting.The traces at the edges are identical. This is indeed a fragment of the Black Metal Sutra\u2019s Lightning Devastator Saber. The white-browed man nodded slightly. If it were a complete Black Metal Sutra, demon monarchs would have long come to fight for it. A small fragment held limited interest to the demon monarchs. Demons also had their own legacies that were even more powerful than the humans\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43: Black Metal Sutra FragmentInside the hall, the hunchbacked man and Tu looked at the branch master.\u201cBrother.\u201d Tu couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cIs this really a fragment of the Black Metal Sutra?\u201dThe white-browed man nodded. \u201cIn the history of the human race, portions of the Black Metal Sutra had gone missing. It was confirmed to have shattered into eight fragments. The demons have also recorded the appearances of the eight fragments. Back when I flipped through their records, I deliberately recorded it when I saw it.\u201d\u201cWhen I cultivate on the mountain, I can enter the library once a month,\u201d said Tu with a smile. \u201cBut I usually read cultivation manuals. I don\u2019t even bother to spend time on those useless books. Brother, you\u2019re the best. You actually keep it in mind to memorize such stuff. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize the fragment of the Black Metal Sutra.\u201d\u201cThese intelligence reports are confidential to humans, but the demons do not pay much attention to them. Even if they obtain the Black Metal Sutra\u2026 the demons are unable to cultivate it. They are only used for reference,\u201d the white-browed man said. \u201cI\u2019ve identified the fragment that the Blood Cloud Bandits wanted to sell to us is the Lightning Devastator Saber legacy. The complete Black Metal Sutra\u2019s Lightning Devastator Saber legacy is split into twenty-six pieces.\u201d\u201cAccording to the reward set by the demons, a complete Black Metal Sutra can be exchanged for a million credits,\u201d said the white-browed man.\u201cA million credits.\u201d The hunchbacked man and Tu\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to gather all the fragments since some of them have long been collected by Archean Mountain, Black Sand Grotto-Heaven, and Two World Island. Some have fallen into the hands of the demons, while some have been scattered all over the world. How can they be gathered? As we are unable to gather all of them, a fragment will give us ten thousand credits,\u201d said the white-browed man. \u201cTen thousand credits\u2026 For just ten thousand credits, the demon monarchs will not be willing to risk their lives to enter human cities. But for us, it\u2019s worth the risk.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s risk it.\u201d Tu\u2019s eyes turned red.\u201cI\u2019ve been in the Skydemon Sect for thirty years. I\u2019ve only accumulated 1200 credits.\u201d The hunchbacked man gritted his teeth. \u201cLet\u2019s take the risk.\u201d\u201cSame old rules. After we succeed, I\u2019ll get sixty percent. The two of you will each get twenty percent,\u201d said the white-browed man. \u201cAny objections?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your call,\u201d replied Tu, and the hunchbacked man immediately.In Skydemon Sect, the strong were supreme. Even if they joined forces, they were no match for the branch master. They were satisfied getting twenty percent each while the branch master took sixty percent.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t tell us, we wouldn\u2019t be certain that it\u2019s the Black Metal Sutra fragment,\u201d said the hunchbacked man immediately.\u201cIn all my years at the Skydemon Sect, I have only accumulated 5000 credits. If I were to receive 6000 credits this time\u2026 I would have a chance of entering the Demon Transformation Pool and becoming a Skydemon,\u201d said the white-browed man.\u201cBrother, you have already condensed a demon core for over a decade. You will definitely become a Skydemon once you enter the Demon Transformation Pool,\u201d said Tu.Skydemon was the cultivation path the demons created for human traitors. It was equivalent to demon monarchs and human Godfiends.\u201cSince we have decided to take the risk,\u201d the white-browed man swept the area with his gaze, then said calmly, \u201cyou have to understand that this operation is extremely dangerous.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The hunchbacked man and Tu were extremely solemn.\u201cEastcalm Prefecture is a human city. There\u2019s a Godfiend from Jadesun Palace presiding over it! The five Godfiend clans should have two or three Godfiends present. If any Godfiend discovers us, we\u2019ll definitely die,\u201d the white-browed man said. \u201cIn fact, if we are held back by human experts, we\u2019ll still die once the human experts swarm us.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d The two vice branch masters nodded.The Skydemon Sect\u2026 could only hide in the shadows.After all, it was only a sect formed by human traitors. Although the demons had created a unique Skydemon cultivation system for these traitors, the Skydemon Sect\u2019s overall strength was far inferior to humans. Their only advantage was that they were humans. Furthermore, the Skydemon system was adept at concealing their auras, allowing them to hide in human cities. However, once they were exposed, humans could easily kill them.The hunchbacked man said, \u201cBranch Master, your strength is nearly invincible under Godfiends. As long as we act fast enough, we can quickly escape. It would be too late by the time those Godfiends arrive.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be careless,\u201d said the white-browed man. \u201cAmong the mortals in Eastcalm Prefecture, there are three who can restrain me. The Yun family\u2019s Yun Fucheng, the Zhang family\u2019s Zhang Yong, as well as the Bai family\u2019s Bai Shuwan. The three of them are all experts at the Core Condensation realm. Although they aren\u2019t my match, they can still hold me back for a while. Therefore, I have to avoid the three of them as much as possible.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The duo nodded.The branch master was practically invincible under the Godfiend realm in Eastcalm Prefecture.As for the two vice branch masters, they were weaker. Although they had already comprehended Force and knew many demonic spells, they had yet to reach the Core Condensation realm. In Eastcalm Prefecture, there were more than ten people who could match them.\u201cAccording to what the two of you\u2019ve said,\u201d the white-browed man said, \u201cthose two Blood Cloud Bandits died at the hands of the Meng family\u2019s Meng Chuan. Then, the fragment of the Black Metal Sutra might be in his hands.\u201d\u201cThis is such an important treasure. Blood Hand Zhao Can would definitely carry it with him out of worry,\u201d said Tu. \u201cI\u2019ve also secretly investigated this matter. When the two Blood Cloud Bandit corpses were handled, many people were present. They didn\u2019t find the Black Metal Sutra fragment. There\u2019s a high chance that it\u2019s in the hands of Meng Chuan.\u201dThe white-browed man nodded. \u201cThe Black Metal Sutra is mysterious and unfathomable. Ordinary Godfiends would find it difficult to pry into its secrets. Only some powerful Godfiends and demon monarchs are able to pry into the profundity of the legacy. Meng Chuan is only seventeen-years-old, so he won\u2019t be able to discover any secrets from it. At most, he will treat it as a Godfiend fragment. He likely wouldn\u2019t carry it with him daily.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The hunchbacked man and Tu\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cBrother, you mean\u2026\u201d said the hunchbacked man immediately.\u201cThe Black Metal Sutra might very well be somewhere in the Mirror Lake Meng Manor,\u201d the white-browed man said. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely to be hidden in Meng Chuan\u2019s residence.\u201d\u201cActivate our Skydemon Sect assets in Eastcalm Prefecture. Think of a way to infiltrate the Mirror Lake Meng Manor,\u201d said the white-browed man. \u201cSearch through Meng Chuan\u2019s residence. If the black metal piece can be stolen, even better.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The duo nodded.If it wasn\u2019t necessary, they wouldn\u2019t want to fight the Meng family.There were a group of Seamless realm experts in the Meng family. Three of them had comprehended Force! Furthermore, Liu Yebai was an expert who had achieved Force as well. Most importantly, there was also the terrifying Godfiend, Fairy Meng. If Fairy Meng discovered them, none of them could escape.Therefore, they had no choice but to use their wits.\u2026The Skydemon Sect members that were lurking in human cities were best at gathering intelligence.They used demonic spells to control an old servant and a maidservant who frequently cleaned Meng Chuan\u2019s yard. When Meng Chuan practiced his Saber Drawing Stance in the training grounds, the old servant and maidservant would search the residence while they did their daily cleaning chores. They even found the banknotes hidden by Meng Chuan, but since demonic spells controlled them, they obediently left the banknotes in their original spots to prevent the enemy from being alerted.However, they couldn\u2019t find the black metal piece.It was because Meng Chuan had long discovered the black metal piece\u2019s wonders. It was even more precious than the remnant Godfiend legacy page given to him by the Third Elder.Therefore, he hid both the black metal piece and the Godfiend legacy remnant in his father\u2019s secret underground chamber. It was the safest place, and there were many traps. If anyone dared to infiltrate the secret chamber, the entire Mirror Lake Meng Manor would be notified.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSince it was hidden so well, only Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang knew how to activate the chamber\u2019s mechanism.The Skydemon Sect tried all means to find the black metal piece, but it was to no avail.\u2026\u201cWhat do we do? We haven\u2019t been able to find it.\u201d The three leaders of the Skydemon Sect of the Eastcalm branch sat down in a rather oppressive atmosphere.\u201cWe have to obtain that ten thousand credits.\u201d The white-browed man\u2019s eyes were cold as he said, \u201cSince we can\u2019t find it covertly, there\u2019s only one method\u2014capture Meng Chuan alive! We shall interrogate him first and learn where it\u2019s hidden. That way, we might be able to obtain the black metal piece easily. If he has given it to the family clan and is hidden by the Meng family, we can use Meng Chuan to force the Meng family into exchanging. The Meng family has definitely placed great importance on Meng Chuan since he grasped the secret technique at fifteen-years-old. They will be willing to exchange the black metal piece for his life.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44: Assassination at Night6th February, night.Meng Chuan, Liu Qiyue, and Yan Jin walked out of Cloud River Restaurant.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely beat you next time,\u201d said Yan Jin.\u201cBut in the past half-year, you\u2019ve already lost three times,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a laugh. Ever since Meng Chuan had saved Yan Jin\u2019s life when they fought side-by-side at Idle Stone Garden, their relationship had blossomed. Yan Jin would occasionally visit Mirror Lake Meng Manor to spar with Meng Chuan. He had a robust Godfiend foundation, and his Yin-Yang dual-sword technique was extremely powerful as well. Unbeknownst to him, Meng Chuan had already comprehended Force a long time ago.Thus, in the three sparring matches against Meng Chuan, Yan Jin always suffered a narrow defeat.There was nothing he could do. For now, Meng Chuan had to hide his \u201cForce,\u201d and could only unleash a portion of his power. But even so, defeating Yan Jin\u2014who had yet to gain insights into Force\u2014was quite easy. Withholding his true strength ended up more difficult.\u201cI\u2019ve already vaguely grasped the threshold to Force while sparring with you today.\u201d Yan Jin looked at Meng Chuan. \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll be much stronger than I am now.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile.\u201cGrasped Force? Stop bragging,\u201d Liu Qiyue said from the side.\u201cHumph.\u201d Yan Jin was too lazy to argue and turned to leave alone.However, Meng Chuan could sense a powerful aura hundreds of feet away from Yan Jin. It was silently following him. In fact, whenever Yan Jin visited Mirror Lake Meng Manor to spar with him, the aura had also been waiting outside his residence.That old servant doesn\u2019t follow him anymore. Instead, there\u2019s a mysterious expert following him in secret. It seems that his family sent stronger guards after he was injured last time.\u201cAh Chuan, Yan Jin said he\u2019s about to achieve Force. What about you?\u201d Liu Qiyue asked. \u201cDon\u2019t lose to him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll secretly tell you a secret,\u201d whispered Meng Chuan. \u201cI think I have hope of comprehending Force within a few months.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve also sensed the threshold to Saber Force?\u201d Liu Qiyue was surprised, but her ears began to turn red.\u201cYes, you have to keep it a secret.\u201d\u201cDefinitely, I\u2019ll definitely keep it a secret.\u201d Liu Qiyue nodded immediately.Seeing Qiyue like this, Meng Chuan couldn\u2019t help but chuckle inwardly.They walked alongside each other as they headed home. It was still early spring, and the nights were still cold. The duo walked shoulder-to-shoulder.Qiyue has grown up too. Meng Chuan looked at Liu Qiyue and sighed. He clearly remembered this snot-nosed little girl being hand-held into the Meng residence by Uncle Liu. In the blink of an eye, she was already sixteen-years-old.Although he had been diligent in his cultivation all these years, he spent his time with Qiyue every day. He would even be dragged out by Qiyue every few days to have a \u201cfeast.\u201d Although his heart ached for the money, he had a great time eating and drinking together.The cold wind from the early-spring evening was bone-piercing, but Meng Chuan found it pleasant.Oh? His heart palpitated as he sensed three powerful demonic aurae appear within half a kilometer of him. They were rapidly approaching him.It\u2019s that Skydemon Sect expert from Idle Stone Garden? Meng Chuan immediately recognized one of them. Back then, the hunchbacked man\u2019s demonic aura had invaded his body, causing him to suffer quite a bit. His grandaunt had personally helped him expel the demonic aura. Therefore, when he sensed the three demonic aurae, he found one of them very familiar. He was certain that it was the hunchbacked man.Three aurae. The two weaker aurae are similar to Father\u2019s and the others\u2019. However, there is an aura that is stronger than Father\u2019s and Uncle Liu\u2019s. This aura is very powerful and very strange. Meng Chuan felt an immense threat.They are rapidly approaching. Are they targeting me? Or are they targeting someone else? Meng Chuan couldn\u2019t help but guess.He immediately made up his mind and said to Liu Qiyue, \u201cQiyue, I just recalled something. I need to go to the ancestral mansion immediately. Head back without me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re heading to the ancestral mansion? Alright.\u201d Liu Qiyue nodded. \u201cBut don\u2019t let history repeat itself. Throwing me behind and running to Azure Cloud Brothel to kill two Blood Cloud Bandits.\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s that easy meeting Blood Cloud Bandits?\u201d Meng Chuan laughed. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be off to the ancestral mansion.\u201d With that said, he turned around and walked towards the ancestral mansion.Liu Qiyue didn\u2019t think too much about it and returned to Meng Manor.\u2026They didn\u2019t follow Qiyue but continued to follow after me. Meng Chuan walked to a deserted street. Most Eastcalm Prefecture citizens slept early at night. Candles were very costly, and ordinary people needed to be thrifty.Apart from the restaurants and tea shops, many places were pitch-black.The cold wind blew.Meng Chuan walked alone.Swish! Swish! Swish!The three Skydemon Sect experts silently landed on a roof as they looked at the lonely figure walking in the distance. The white-browed man\u2019s eyes were faintly glowing golden. He could see a distance of almost one kilometer at night, much less during the day.\u201cBrother, he\u2019s heading towards the Meng family\u2019s ancestral mansion,\u201d the hunchbacked man said softly.Vice Branch Master Tu immediately said, \u201cWe have to act immediately. If we let him continue his journey, we will be too close to the Meng family\u2019s ancestral mansion. If we attack him and he sends a distress signal\u2026 Fairy Meng would probably arrive shortly.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The white-browed man nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll ambush him from behind and capture him alive. The two of you are to ambush him from the front. If we fail our ambush, we\u2019ll surround him from three sides. He will have nowhere to run.\u201dThe hunchbacked man and Vice Branch Master Tu nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d Both of them trusted their elder brother\u2019s capabilities.\u201cMove out.\u201d The white-browed man gave the order.The trio quickly separated. The white-browed man silently closed in from behind, while the hunchbacked man and the other two rushed forward to block Meng Chuan\u2019s path.\u2026Here they come. Meng Chuan could sense them very clearly, and he was exceptionally calm right now.The powerful aura rapidly approached him without making a sound.Oh? Meng Chuan seemed to sense something as he turned his head to look in the direction where the white-browed man was about 800 feet away. The white-browed man was tall; his eyes were long and narrow, and his pupils were golden. His white eyebrows were so long they drooped. A gray demonic aura enveloped his entire body. Each of his two hands held a scimitar.Their gazes met.When Meng Chuan saw the white-eyebrowed, golden-eyed expert emit the demonic aura, his expression changed drastically. With a whoosh, he transformed into a blur as he charged forward.He discovered me even before I made a move? Murong You was like a giant bird in the darkness, but he was 80 feet away. Yet, he had been discovered. This made him rather astonished.Unbeknownst to him, as soon as he was 100 feet from Meng Chuan, Meng Chuan was able to 'see\u201d him carefully. He had intentionally turned his head to pretend like he had discovered his enemy.Murong You was adept at sneak attacks and assassination. He often hid behind his enemy without them ever detecting him. Now, he had been discovered in this chilly windy night when he had been 80 feet away. Murong You felt rather aggrieved.He was lucky. It just so happened that he turned his head.Murong You didn\u2019t have the luxury of time to think.Swoosh!The fleeing Meng Chuan took out a distress flare and activated it immediately. The flare shot into the sky, becoming very eye-catching in the darkness.Murong You coldly shouted, \u201cBlock him!\u201dRun! Meng Chuan fled in a panic, but his speed was extremely fast.\u201cYoung Master Meng, your speed is much faster than before.\u201d A figure flew out from the darkness. It was none other than the hunchbacked man who exuded a green demonic aura. The hunchbacked man\u2019s green eyes stared at him as he lunged forward.\u201cThe improvement of a genius is naturally fast.\u201d Another figure rushed out from the other side. Vice Branch Master Tu\u2014a muscular man who emanated a black demonic aura\u2014chuckled as he wielded a huge axe. He looked like a giant bear.\u201cWhat!?\u201d Meng Chuan wore a furious, alarmed look.Behind him was the terrifying golden-eyed, white-browed expert. He was desperately trying to escape, but there were experts in front of him\u2014each attacking him from the flanks.\u201cSkydemon Sect! How dare you ambush me! My Meng family will definitely not let you off!\u201d As he roared, he chose to flee towards the hunchbacked man.\u201cHaha, the Meng family won\u2019t be able to save you in time.\u201d Seeing Meng Chuan coming towards him, the hunchbacked man went to intercept him immediately.More than half a year ago, the hunchbacked man had exchanged blows with Meng Chuan. At the time, he had sent his fingernails flying, and Meng Chuan had almost lost his life from the severe injuries.The hunchbacked man was naturally very confident.\u201cStop.\u201d The hunched man flicked his finger, sending a fingernail flying out with terrifying might.At this close distance, Meng Chuan barely dodged the attack, but this greatly reduced his speed.\u201cHaha.\u201d The hunchbacked man laughed loudly as he stretched out his sharp claws. They turned into vague shadows as he grabbed at Meng Chuan.Meng Chuan\u2014who was escaping desperately\u2014slashed out instantly without any warning.He infused the Power of the Soul into his whole body. His Quintessential Energy\u2014fifteen times greater than normal\u2014and physical body perfectly fused. After the fusion, he released his Saber Force! Meng Chuan had cultivated the Saber Drawing Stance the most, and it was the fastest attack he could deliver! The 17th stance of the Lightning Devastator Saber had allowed him to discover a brilliant method of fusing his body with his Quintessential Energy. When used, the lightning from his Lightning Divine Body would become denser, making him faster.Ever since he integrated some of Lightning Devastator Saber\u2019s secrets into the Saber Drawing Stance, its strength by nearly 50%.Lightning Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance! A cold light flashed in his eyes.Following the Saber Force, a surge of energy erupted from his body as a terrifying strike containing his Quintessential Energy formed. Having stirred up the Heaven and Earth powers, it became a terrifying saber beam that was over 100 feet long.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe saber beam was so dazzling it was hard to see the true body of the saber.Pfft.The hunchbacked man was initially confident, but when he suddenly saw a blinding saber beam appear in front of him, he instinctively used both his claws to protect his vitals. Before he could see the saber, his waist was injured.The hunchbacked man\u2019s lower body was still moving, but his upper body had already fallen to the ground. It tumbled about, covering the ground in blood.He had been sliced in two with a single strike!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45: What Monster is He!Skydemon Sect\u2019s Eastcalm Branch Master, Murong You, and Vice Branch Master, Tu Shang, were originally filled with confidence. They initially wanted to corner Meng Chuan from three sides and capture him alive.But who would have thought the fleeing Meng Chuan would suddenly turn around and attack!That strike was too amazing! The beautiful saber strike even formed a dazzling saber beam that was over 100 feet long! It killed their companion with a single slash.Brother Gao died just like that? One strike? Tu couldn\u2019t help but feel fear rising in his heart.That saber strike. The white-browed man\u2014Murong You\u2014was equally alarmed. That strike was too fast and too sudden. Only I will be capable of blocking it. Brother Gao and Brother Tu aren\u2019t able to defend against it. This Meng Chuan is only 17 years old this year! He used one strike to kill Brother Gao, who can release his demonic aura. What kind of monster is he?This Meng Chuan is too strong. He\u2019s no weaker than the legendary geniuses. Tu was flustered. Meng Chuan was simply too powerful, so powerful that it was inconceivable. Indeed, such terrifying geniuses were only found in legends.\u201cMeng Chuan, Meng Chuan\u2026\u201d The hunchbacked man, who only had his upper torso left, grabbed the ground with his claws. He was tenacious, and he continued to stare at Meng Chuan. For an expert like him, he could still stay alive for a while despite his body being cut in two.Instead of fleeing, Meng Chuan stopped and looked at the hunchbacked man.Pfft.With a blade flash, a red dot appeared between the hunchbacked man\u2019s eyebrows. Only then did his eyes widen, and pupils dilate. His arms collapsed limply and did not make another sound.Following which, Meng Chuan\u2019s gaze landed on Tu, and he spoke softly, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d After speaking, his figure blurred as he dashed towards Tu. Meng Chuan had been acting all along.It was due to lacking choices.He determined that the white-browed man was extremely powerful from his aura, much more powerful than his father or Uncle Liu. Even if he used all of his strength and fused the Power of the Soul, he didn\u2019t have the confidence to deal with him at all. Therefore, he decided to kill the weaker enemies one by one! He deliberately fled towards the hunchbacked man and baited him into chasing.The Saber Drawing Stance\u2019s speed was actually secondary. His plan was a psychological strategy. It was to trick his enemies into believing they could capture him easily. The moment the opponent was about to catch up, he drew his saber!It was completely unexpected. The enemy would be caught off-guard. And at that defenseless moment\u2014a split-second\u2014the saber beam would slice through the opponent\u2019s neck.Therefore, psychological strategies were essential to the Saber Drawing Stance. Psychology played a big factor in whether he could unleash this attack well. The other factor was his diligent 8000 repetitions a day.If they were to engage in direct combat, both sides would be extremely focused and go all out. Even if Meng Chuan used Lightning Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance, the hunchbacked man would instinctively defend against it. The threat of this strike would have been halved, lowering Meng Chuan\u2019s chances of killing him. After all, his opponent was a Seamless realm expert who had comprehended Force and could cast demonic spells.This was how life-and-death battles were. Psychology, environment, condition while in battle. All sorts of factors determined a battle\u2019s outcome.\u2026Upon seeing Meng Chuan kill Gao and rush over to him, Tu\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He was afraid! \u201cBrother, save me.\u201d Tu turned around and fled towards Murong You.Murong You also charged at his companion with all his might. Before Meng Chuan could catch up to Tu, he reached Tu.\u201cPrepare to die.\u201d Murong You didn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest. He brandished his scimitars and chopped at the charging Meng Chuan.Oh? Meng Chuan frowned.The two scimitars struck out with a gray demonic aura, slicing the air apart like tofu. No saber beam was formed. Saber beams were high-pressure airwaves formed by the compressed air due to cleaving the air. At Murong You\u2019s realm, he was able to stir the Heaven and Earth powers, causing air to no longer be an obstruction.These two strikes were very clear in his 'senses\u201d and terrifying. They were in no way inferior to his Lightning Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance.I won\u2019t be able to defend against such a move if I don\u2019t fuse my Power of the Soul with my body. Cognizant of this point, Meng Chuan turned around and swiftly circled the area about sixty feet away.Whoosh.Using his movement technique, he was like a hunting wolf as he circled around Murong You and Tu. Occasionally, he would rush forward to deliver a blow.Tu lacked the confidence to fight him head-on. All he did was dodge time and time again.\u201cHe\u2019s too fast.\u201d Tu immediately asked, \u201cBrother, what do we do?\u201d\u201cHis speed is greater than mine. Even if he has the Lightning Divine Body that\u2019s best at speed, he shouldn\u2019t be this fast. How robust is his Godfiend foundation?\u201d Murong You couldn\u2019t believe it. He had already condensed a demon core. Although he cultivated a formula that didn\u2019t focus on extreme speed, his speed was still quite high.However, he was actually suppressed by Meng Chuan when it came to speed.Unbeknownst to him, Meng Chuan\u2019s Godfiend foundation was just one component to his speed. His physical body was comparable to Vice Branch Masters Tu and Gao while he was in the late-stage Mortal Shedding realm. Naturally, the Godfiend Body he cultivated had far surpassed Tu\u2019s.He had also obtained the Lightning Devastator Saber where he learned some physical body and Quintessential Energy special techniques that increased the density of the lightning in his body. This made him faster.Thus, even in his normal state, he could move faster than Murong You.\u201cWe can\u2019t continue fighting him,\u201d said Murong You via voice transmission. \u201cIf we drag this on for too long, Fairy Meng will probably arrive. Then, both of us will be dead.\u201d\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Tu asked.\u201cYoung Master Meng\u2019s reputation is one of benevolence. We will kill the surrounding residents, forcing him to fight us. As long as we are close enough\u2014with your life-preservation means being stronger than Brother Gao\u2019s\u2014you don\u2019t have to worry. At most, you\u2019ll need to cast a forbidden spell. Besides, I\u2019m by your side,\u201d Murong You said with a voice transmission.\u201cAlright.\u201d Tu narrowed his eyes. His eyes were glowing red, and the black demonic aura around him became denser. \u201cIf I use a forbidden spell, I can hold him back for a short time.\u201dBoom! Boom! The two charged towards the residences beside them. With a bang, they crashed through walls and rushed in.\u201cYou have a death wish!\u201d Meng Chuan\u2019s eyes instantly turned red. He was indeed not in a hurry just now.The two Skydemon Sect experts would be finished if he could hold them long enough for his grandaunt to arrive. He had released his flare, and he wasn\u2019t far from the ancestral mansion where Fairy Meng resided. However, despair gives courage even to a coward. The two Skydemon Sect experts began targeting the commoners.Boom!Meng Chuan couldn\u2019t care about anything else. The Power of the Soul fused with his body instantly, and his heartbeats could be heard. It was as though a gust of wind was howling in his lungs. The sound of his internal organs operating was extremely clear. Blood gushed like a river, and wisps of Quintessential Energy flowed through every meridian in his body. His control over his body and Quintessential Energy immediately rose to new limits.His speed rose! He had only been slightly faster than Murong You before this, but now, he was much faster.Murong You and Tu had just barged into a residence when they discovered a figure behind them.\u201cWhat monster is he!\u201d Both of them were so frightened that their hearts palpated with fear.Meng Chuan had never moved at such speeds.Previously, he had only fused the Power of the Soul with his saber to unleash Lightning Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance, but now that he had pushed himself to his maximum speed\u2014his strongest trait\u2014he truly frightened the two of them.\u201cLet\u2019s go all out.\u201d In the midst of the crisis, Tu\u2019s black demonic aura turned slightly red, and a bloody aura emanated from him.Murong You also brandished his scimitars and charged towards Meng Chuan.Swoosh.Meng Chuan\u2019s speed was simply too fast. He went straight for Tu. He was trying to take another one down.\u201cDie.\u201d Tu knew that there was no way out. Meng Chuan\u2019s monster-like speed was simply too terrifying. He had no hope of escaping at all. All he could do was swing the axe in his hand with all his might.\u201cDie.\u201d Murong You\u2019s pair of scimitars moved exquisitely. His scimitars drew out arcs that slashed at Meng Chuan.Pfft.Meng Chuan\u2019s blurry figure arrived in front of Tu in an instant. Meng Chuan had dodged one of Murong You\u2019s scimitars with his speed. The other scimitar was redirected by a slight nudge from Meng Chuan\u2019s saber. After fending off arrow volleys for so many years, his swift saber\u2019s defensive and divertive abilities had become exceptional.The scimitar ended up heading towards Tu thanks to Meng Chuan.\u201cWhat?\u201d Murong You and Tu were shocked.How did it turn into friendly fire? Murong You immediately retracted his saber while Tu dodged.Swoosh.It was a gentle slice. This extremely gentle and faint slice silently emerged from the darkness.As Tu avoided Murong You\u2019s scimitar, he heaved a sigh of relief. He then discovered the faint saber beam had already reached his neck. Before he could react, the saber beam sliced through him.Tu\u2019s grip on his axe loosened, and the axe fell to the ground with a loud thud. He frantically grabbed at the wound on his throat. He wanted to live, but this strike was too vicious!Meng Chuan landed to the side and coldly glanced at Tu\u2014who was clasping his throat\u2014before looking at the shocked Murong You.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHow is this possible? I ended up helping him? Murong You couldn\u2019t believe it.Meng Chuan wasn\u2019t surprised at all.Murong You\u2019s and Tu\u2019s positions, movement speed, and movements were all acutely grasped by Meng Chuan due to his 100 feet domain and inconceivable speed. He only needed to position himself well and redirect the opponent\u2019s full-strength attack to cause friendly fire.Just that bit of time was enough for him to take out Tu\u2019s life.\u201cYou\u2019re the only one left.\u201d Meng Chuan looked at Murong You.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Following that, he transformed into a blur and fled east.\u201cTrying to flee?\u201d Meng Chuan immediately pursued him without using the Power of the Soul. He could keep up with Murong You with his normal speed alone.They rushed across roofs like ghosts in the night. Only the sound of the howling wind prevailed.\u201cHubby, there\u2019s some movement outside.\u201d\u201cIt has quietened down.\u201d Inside the residence\u2014which had its yard wall smashed through by Murong You and Vice Branch Master Tu Shang\u2014a thin man stuck his head out from underneath a fallen roof beam. He looked outside carefully. In the darkness, he vaguely saw a muscular man about ten feet tall on the ground not far away. He was covered in black fur. At first glance, he looked like a large black bear. The thin man\u2019s face turned pale, and he shrank back.\u201cLet\u2019s not go out. No matter what happens, don\u2019t bother.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see clearly, but it looks like a bear demon is lying in our courtyard. It\u2019s about ten feet tall, much taller than our house\u2019s roof beam.\u201d\u201cWhat? A demon?\u201dThe couple hid inside, not daring to go out again.\u2026Within seconds, Murong You and Meng Chuan arrived close to a large river.\u201cOh?\u201d When Meng Chuan saw the river, he immediately understood. He\u2019s unable to escape from me on land, so he wants to escape using the river? I\u2019m not good at fighting underwater.To experts, normal swimming and diving weren\u2019t considered good enough.Some water-aligned Godfiend bodies allowed one to be more agile than fishes when in water. They were extremely fast, and they could maintain high combat strength. Some demonic arts from the Skydemon Sect allowed their disciples to maintain relatively high combat strength in the water. The cultivation formula Meng Chuan had cultivated didn\u2019t give him proficiency to fight in the water. He couldn\u2019t even exert 10% of his strength underwater.Humph! He\u2019s so fast. He should have a Lightning Divine Body. I refuse to believe he still dares to chase me underwater. Murong You rushed towards the river.At this point, Murong You had given up capturing Meng Chuan alive. All he wanted was to survive. This was because the Meng Chuan was unimaginably fast. Meng Chuan had even used him to kill Tu\u2026 It was a blow to his confidence.As long as I can escape and report this to the higher-ups, I\u2019ll gain plenty of credit. Meng Chuan has really hidden his strength well. He has clearly comprehended Saber Force for quite some time.Meng Chuan\u2019s saber arts were too exquisite. He didn\u2019t look like a novice that had just comprehended Saber Force.In truth, it had been more than half a year since Meng Chuan had comprehended Saber Force. Furthermore, he had fused some of the Lightning Devastator Saber\u2019s secrets into his saber arts, making them more exquisite. With his hundred-foot domain, Meng Chuan was very capable in combat, thus giving Murong You the impression that Meng Chuan had comprehended Force for quite some time.He might\u2019ve comprehended Saber Force when he was sixteen. No. He might have comprehended when he was fifteen. The reported time for when he achieved the secret technique should be fake. He had probably figured out the secret technique when he was eleven or twelve. I was suppressed by him even though my demon core has been condensed for years. His talent is simply terrifying. If I report this to the demons, the demons will probably place a bounty on his head. When that happens, he\u2019ll definitely die.Oh? Murong You suddenly realized that Meng Chuan had suddenly increased his speed. In the blink of an eye, he was right behind him. He\u2019s going all out. Murong You was alarmed. Back when Meng Chuan killed Tu, Murong You had witnessed the speeds Meng Chuan was capable of. Even so, he was still shocked seeing it a second time.He was too fast!Swoosh.After confirming Murong You wanted to escape via the river, Meng Chuan did not delay any further. He had originally been stalling for time because he was waiting for his grandaunt to arrive. However, if he waited any longer, the other party would jump into the river and escape.\u201cKill!\u201d He decided to take one last gamble. He fused the Power of the Soul into his whole body. The absolute control over his physical body and Quintessential Energy made Meng Chuan feel omnipotent. He unleashed his power and chased after Murong You. As he did so, he struck out with his saber.As his saber struck out, the lightning within his body exploded.The 17th stance of the Lightning Devastator Saber\u2014the first strike of the Five Lightning Descent!If the Saber Drawing Stance was Meng Chuan\u2019s go-to for dealing sneak attacks, then the partial Five Lightning Descent move was his strongest killing blow in a frontal assault. Its power was monstrous.This strike was as fast as lightning, and an oppressive aura of magnificence accompanied it.It\u2019s so fast. Murong You felt like Meng Chuan\u2019s attack was too fast. The saber strike was even faster and more domineering than Meng Chuan\u2019s previous strikes.It doesn\u2019t pose a threat to me. Murong You instantly used a forbidden technique. His strength increased by a great deal, and his pair of scimitars perfectly sealed the area in front of him. With the sound of weapons clashing, Murong You perfectly parried the attack.Boom!Meng Chuan quickly followed up with a second strike.His second strike carried the first strike\u2019s might with it. The lightning in his body surged, and his Quintessential Energy gushed like tidal waves. This saber move was even more domineering. Although the saber beam was only ten feet long, it was much stronger than the Lightning Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance he had unleashed earlier.Under the dark sky, Murong You\u2019s vision blurred. He found the saber beam blinding.Bam! Murong You was indeed skilled with wielding his two scimitars. He was able to block the attack with great difficulty. However, the beam transmitted a heavy force that reached his organs. Murong You\u2019s body jolted, and his nasal cavities were filled with the smell of blood.Now, the third saber strike! Meng Chuan\u2019s eyes were filled with killing intent. After repeated usage of the Power of the Soul, Meng Chuan could only unleash one final strike. It was a desperate move.He had obtained a portion of the Black Metal Sutra\u2019s Lightning Devastator Saber 17th stance. He knew only the first two moves; the third move was unknown to him.However, he used his knowledge of the first two moves to achieve his own version of the third attack. The lightning within his body rampaged. His Quintessential Energy flowed through his meridians, wave after wave. He wasn\u2019t able to suppress the energies. He couldn\u2019t redirect the energy and channel it into a fourth attack. All he could do was completely unleash all his power without any thought.Whoosh.The lightning and Quintessential Energy in his body entered his saber as he executed his final strike.Whoosh.It was unlike his previous two strikes. The first two strikes were powerful and dominating. Each strike faster and more domineering than the previous. The third strike was extremely soft. It was the Swaying Moonfall he had been cultivating for a very long time! He had used this technique to kill Tu Shang. However, the speed at which he delivered this Swaying Moonfall was far faster. After all, he had fused all energy accumulated from his first two moves, thus allowing him to deliver his most terrifying Swaying Moonfall.The saber art was gentle and sinister, making its trajectory unpredictable.This was a combination of moves Meng Chuan had devised by himself. By combining Five Lightning Descent\u2019s first two moves, he could create a three-strike combo with Swaying Moonfall!A combination of domineering and softness.Not good. Murong You was used to blocking fast and furious strikes. He was prepared to block the third attack, but who would have thought the third attack would suddenly turn sinister and gentle? Murong You frantically tried to block it.Murong You\u2019s scimitars collided with the saber beam, but the beam was like moonlight pouring down, detectable but difficult to capture.When Murong You\u2019s scimitars touched the saber beam, a strange revolving force broke through his defense. The saber beam appeared before him.This is bad. Murong You\u2019s heart sank when he failed to block the attack. He instinctively used his arms to block.Pfft!An ethereal saber beam flashed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAn arm flew up, and a bloody gash appeared on Murong You\u2019s chest.Am I going to die by Meng Chuan\u2019s hands? Murong You\u2019s heart chilled. Although he survived the terrifying strike, he had lost an arm. The gaping wound on his chest caused his strength to drop drastically. He had half of his strength left.He had been suppressed at his peak.With half his peak strength left, Murong You felt disenchanted with the situation.I didn\u2019t manage to kill him? A chill ran down Meng Chuan\u2019s spine. Using the Power of the Soul had exhausted him. He wasn\u2019t able to unleash his full strength again. Without the Power of the Soul, his strength was the same as the two vice branch masters. Even if Murong You was severely injured, he didn\u2019t have the confidence to keep him here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although Murong You was disheartened, his desire to live strengthened.He used a forbidden spell and sped towards the raging river. Although losing an arm caused the situation to become dire, the forbidden spell made him much faster than normal.Faster! Faster! Faster! Murong You frantically ran for his life while watching his back.Meng Chuan continued to follow him.He didn\u2019t try to kill me? It seems that unleashing such incredible power is also a type of forbidden technique. He is talented and promising, so he doesn\u2019t dare to use a forbidden technique too frequently. Murong You couldn\u2019t help but feel lucky. For the sake of his life, he used a forbidden spell without hesitating. For peerless geniuses like Meng Chuan, they cherished their bodies and carefully rationed the usage of forbidden techniques\u2014since they were afraid their foundations would be damaged.Caoyun River. Murong You looked at the raging river in front of him, and couldn\u2019t help but feel delighted. He immediately dived, transforming into a blur as he entered the river.This pursuit had lasted roughly half a minute.They had gone past a few streams. For instance, the street where Vice Branch Masters Tu and Gao had died was just beside a 20-foot wide stream.However, that stream was too narrow. Even if he entered the stream, enemies on the bank could sense the fluctuations in the water. If the tracking continued, he would be doomed once Fairy Meng arrived.Only a wide and deep river allowed him to escape pursuit.This is Caoyun River. It\u2019s 800 feet wide. He can\u2019t track me. Murong You dove deeper into the river. The deeper he went, the harder it would be for someone on the bank to find him.After diving, he quickly swam towards the middle of Caoyun River\u2014which was also the deepest spot.Oh?Standing by the riverbank, Meng Chuan could sense Murong You. At first, he could sense Murong You clearly, but as Murong You dove six feet deep, he was unable to 'see\u201d clearly. He could only sense the aura heading for deeper depth. Even his aura was rapidly weakening.Murong You dived deeper and swam further away.Meng Chuan didn\u2019t dare stand near the water surface. With his current strength, he was able to walk on water. However, if Murong You attacked him, he would be in a dire situation. If he was dragged into the river, he would lose his life.Soil and rocks are the greatest obstacles to my sensory domain. River water comes second. I can\u2019t sense him once he\u2019s ten feet deep. Meng Chuan frowned.Murong You had already disappeared from his senses.At Caoyun River\u2019s middle, the water depth was nearly 60 feet. The depth of the river was 20 feet, even when one was close to the banks. After all, huge ships passed through the river.He escaped from my senses. In the darkness, Meng Chuan stood by the shore and looked at the sparkling Caoyun River. Many thoughts flashed through his mind.\u2026Meanwhile\u2026Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai had left Eastcalm Prefecture again. They headed out of town for quite some time every year.However, because of the new year, Fairy Meng had been in the ancestral mansion for the past few days. When Meng Chuan released the distress flare\u2014one that Fairy Meng had personally given him\u2014the Quintessential Energy mark in it allowed her to sense it immediately.Oh? Fairy Meng held her walking stick and came out of the house. When she looked up, she saw the rising flare.Meng Chuan is requesting help?Fairy Meng felt her heart tighten. She gently slammed her walking stick on the ground, and an invisible wave immediately spread out. The wave fluctuations were extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, the wave had spread five kilometers in every direction\u2014including the area where the flare had been lit.She sensed Meng Chuan fleeing in panic as the white-browed Murong You, the bear-like Vice Branch master Tu, and the smug and confident Vice Branch Gao cornered him.Murong You? The Skydemon Sect\u2019s Eastcalm branch master and vice branch masters have all appeared. Even the weakest of the trio has comprehended Force and can release demonic aura. That Murong You is nearly invincible underneath the Godfiend Realm. Fairy Meng\u2019s expression changed. Meng Chuan is in danger!Her figure immediately vanished as she rushed over as fast as she could. She desperately rushed towards him.She didn\u2019t have time to probe any further. Probing would only waste time. She needed to arrive as soon as possible! In the past, she could join forces with other Godfiends at Calm Sea Pass. All she needed to do was carry out reconnaissance on their surroundings, control a domain, and leave the head-on fighting to her companions.Whoosh.About a minute later, Fairy Meng arrived at the area she had seen Meng Chuan fleeing in.With a single glance, she saw Vice Branch Master Gao\u2019s body split in two. Clearly, a sharp saber had halved his body.Could it be that an expert saved Meng Chuan? Fairy Meng was taken aback as she slammed her walking stick lightly on the ground, producing invisible ripples.She immediately discovered a huge bear-like corpse lying in a damaged residence not far away. It was Vice Branch Master Tu\u2019s corpse. The fatal injury he suffered was a strike to the neck.Invisible waves spread out for five kilometers.She immediately discovered Murong You being pursued by Meng Chuan. Clearly, the former was fleeing in a panic while Meng Chuan was in hot pursuit.Meng Chuan is chasing after Murong You? Fairy Meng was somewhat dazed.When she saw the two vice branch masters\u2019 corpses, she thought an expert had saved Meng Chuan. From the looks of it now, it was very likely that Meng Chuan had killed them. Furthermore, he was pursuing Murong You\u2014who was invincible underneath the Godfiend realm.Although she was shocked, Fairy Meng still rushed over.Every step she took covered hundreds of feet. Every step she took, her walking stick would hit the ground, and invisible waves emanated out.With every step she took, she probed the situation, and it affected her speed. However, Fairy Meng was no longer anxious. As she was very close, she was confident that Murong You would be incapable of escaping.Meng Chuan has taken action? Fairy Meng could clearly sense that when they approached the Caoyun River, Meng Chuan\u2019s speed suddenly increased dramatically as he slashed at Murong You. The speed of that strike shocked her. The saber art was as fast as lightning and was oppressive and tyrannical. Murong You attempted to block it with a forbidden spell. Three strikes were delivered\u2014with the third strike being soft and bizarre\u2014and Murong You was heavily injured. He even lost an arm.When did Meng Chuan become this strong? Fairy Meng found it unbelievable.Meng Chuan usually sparred with his father and Fairy Meng. But those spars were to temper his own abilities. There had been no need for him to use the Power of the Soul!\u2026Under the night sky, Murong You jumped into Caoyun River. Soon, there was no movement.Standing by the shore, Meng Chuan frowned and was clearly in a bad mood. By letting him escape, Murong You will definitely report what happened here to the demons. The demons will most likely send their subordinates to assassinate me.He knew himself very well. He could only be considered a state\u2019s genius without using the Power of the Soul. Once he used the Power of the Soul, he was considered a top-tier genius in the entire world. Just the fact that he could pursue Murong You\u2014who had condensed a demon core\u2014meant that the demons would definitely place great importance on this little fellow from the Eastcalm Prefecture.Oh? He sensed a powerful aura rapidly approaching him, much faster than when he was using the Power of the Soul.Soon, a blurry figure arrived at Caoyun River. It was an old woman holding a walking stick.Grandaunt. His eyes lit up.Fairy Meng stood on the river surface as her walking stick gently touched the river surface.The entire river began to tremble, and ripples spread out in every direction\u2014going deep into the river. At the bottom of the river, Murong You\u2014who was fleeing at high speed\u2014felt threads quickly wrap around him. His expression changed, and he struggled with all his might. However, the seemingly ordinary threads were extremely tough. He was unable to escape them.A Godfiend. Murong You revealed a look of despair. This despair of powerlessness could only happen when facing a Godfiend.His demonic energy was sealed away as the threads entered his body. The threads then began dragging Murong You out of the river, sending him flying upwards.He was thrown out of the water and appeared on the river surface.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMurong You saw an old woman holding a walking stick on the water surface.Fairy Meng. Murong You felt despair. She managed to catch up after all.Murong You. Meng Chuan instantly relaxed when he saw Murong You being dragged from the river. He didn\u2019t need to worry about news leaking out. Murong You only took a few seconds to swim 500 feet. His speed is comparable to ordinary Seamless realm experts on land. Many fish aren\u2019t as fast as him.Fairy Meng held onto her walking stick and walked to the riverbank. Murong You followed in tow. The threads had wrapped around him like a dumpling.\u201cGrandaunt.\u201d Meng Chuan bowed respectfully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Otherwise, I\u2019d really be in big trouble this time,\u201d said Meng Chuan gratefully.By the side, Murong You\u2014who was tied up like a dumpling\u2014stared at Meng Chuan and said in a deep voice, \u201cYoung Master Meng, I\u2019m truly impressed. You actually acted like a Mortal Shedding realm expert who had only grasped the secret technique despite having this much strength. You sure hid the secret well. We lost fair and square. We did the calculations, including Fairy Meng\u2019s reconnaissance skills and Palace Lord Jadesun\u2019s domain. As long as we had a minute, these Godfiends wouldn\u2019t be able to find us. However, I never expected my brothers to die at your hands. Even I was held back by you for so long!\u201dHe had been obstructed for too long. This allowed Fairy Meng to capture him. As long as he had a little more time, he would\u2019ve hidden in an underground tunnel, making it difficult for him to be found.Dirt and rock were huge obstacles to any sensory means. The river was also very good at obstructing sensory techniques. As soon as Murong You jumped into the canal, Meng Chuan was quickly unable to sense him. If he had five more seconds, even Fairy Meng wouldn\u2019t be able to find him.\u201cYou better shut up.\u201d Fairy Meng glanced at him as invisible threads stabbed into Murong You\u2019s body. Murong You could no longer make any sound. His sense of hearing and vision was gone.\u201cHe can\u2019t hear or see anything now,\u201d whispered Fairy Meng. \u201cWhen you spar with your father and I\u2026 your strength is only close to your father and company. However, I realized you were several times stronger when you had unleashed your full strength earlier. You were even able to suppress Murong You. Even the two Skydemon Sect vice branch masters died by your hands. Is it because of your glabella space?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m only capable of unleashing a few strikes. I killed the two vice branch masters with the first two moves, and the last three strikes could only heavily injure Murong You. I was unable to kill him.\u201d\u201cTo be able to raise your strength this much\u201d\u2014Fairy Meng frowned slightly\u2014\u201dis something unheard of. Remember, this matter has to be kept a secret. Even when you take part in Archean Mountain\u2019s assessment, there\u2019s no need to expose the glabella space as long as you have the confidence to pass. After you enter Archean Mountain, read through Archean Mountain\u2019s manuals and figure out what it represents. By then, you can decide if you want to announce its existence.\u201d\u201cAfter all, such a mysterious space might be a good thing. It might also involve some secrets,\u201d said Fairy Meng.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cWhen do you think you can reach the Seamless realm?\u201d inquired Fairy Meng.\u201cMy Godfiend foundation is extremely deep and robust. I will stay in the Mortal Shedding realm for slightly longer. I estimate that I will reach the Seamless realm by the end of the year or early next year,\u201d said Meng Chuan.\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a longer growth period.\u201d Fairy Meng nodded. \u201cEven if you reach the Seamless realm by the end of the year, you have to consolidate your foundation. It\u2019s best if you can condense your core! You can then participate in Archean Mountain\u2019s assessment at the end of next year. It\u2019ll be appropriate for you to participate in the assessment at the age of 18. Even if you fail, you can participate again when you are 19 or 20.\u201dAccording to Fairy Meng\u2019s plan, he had a total of three chances.\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cNo one discovered this exchange, right?\u201d inquired Fairy Meng.\u201cIt\u2019s late at night, and the Skydemon Sect\u2019s chosen assassination location was rather remote. There were no experts watching.\u201d\u201cAlright, you can go back first. Don\u2019t tell anyone about today\u2019s matter,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cJust blame their deaths on me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan felt quite relaxed because of this. Fairy Meng wasn\u2019t greedy. As an existence who had been a Godfiend for nearly 80 years, she didn\u2019t care about the credit. She was doing her best to protect Meng Chuan.\u2026The battle on the 6th of February took place silently.Meng Chuan returned to Mirror Lake Meng Manor.\u201cAh Chuan, didn\u2019t you go to the ancestral mansion? You came back rather quickly.\u201d Liu Qiyue had just returned when she realized that Meng Chuan was right behind her.\u201cI ran at full speed, so of course I was fast,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile.Liu Qiyue didn\u2019t realize that during the time they had been apart, a secret battle\u2014that had a substantial, long-lasting effect on Eastcalm Prefecture\u2014had occurred.\u2026At the Meng family ancestral mansion, inside a torture chamber.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything if you swear that I can leave this place alive!\u201d Murong You\u2014who was chained up\u2014shouted. His body trembled.Fairy Meng stood there and said indifferently, \u201cDon\u2019t dream about living. Since I caught you, you will die without a doubt. However, if you tell me where the Skydemon Sect Eastcalm Branch Hall is, I\u2019ll let you die quickly. Otherwise, we would be talking about not twenty days, but years! You won\u2019t even be able to die despite wishing so. You have to endure torture day and night, forever stuck in hell, never to receive liberation.\u201dFairy Meng had experience torturing these dregs from the Skydemon Sect.\u201cEastcalm Branch Hall. No, no\u2026\u201d Murong You wasn\u2019t willing to bow his head so easily. \u201cLet me leave Eastcalm Prefecture alive. Otherwise, don\u2019t even think about knowing anything.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take our time.\u201d Fairy Meng held onto her walking stick as invisible threads entered Murong You\u2019s body. Murong You immediately let out a tragic cry.In the midst of the pain, time seemed to pass a thousand times slower. Murong You experienced endless torment with no end in sight.\u201cLet me leave this place alive.\u201d The desire to live allowed Murong You to persist, but Fairy Meng stood there expressionlessly. Threads drilled into Murong You\u2019s body and tortured him.Two hours, four hours, six hours\u2026It felt like a very long time had passed for Murong You. He had been tortured to the brink of madness. He wanted liberation. He wanted to escape from this abyss of suffering.\u201cI\u2019ll speak.\u201d Murong You finally gave up.Before the sun had even risen, Murong You had given her everything she wanted. And then, he got what he wanted\u2014total release!Fairy Meng walked out of the torture chamber.Soon, Fairy Meng led nine Elders, as well as 120 Mortal Shedding realm members from the Meng family that were split into seven teams. They carried out several operations simultaneously.They removed the headquarters and six important outposts of the Eastcalm branch. The six outposts were pawn shops, a large merchant\u2019s residence, an escort company, et cetera. They were wiped out in two hours by the Meng family.\u2026The next afternoon.Fairy Meng once again temporarily moved to Mirror Lake Meng Manor.\u201cGrandaunt, these books?\u201d Meng Chuan looked at the box of books in the courtyard. There were also paintings and other items.\u201cI interrogated Murong You overnight and learned of the Eastcalm branch lairs,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cThe other subordinates from the Eastcalm branch weren\u2019t even aware their three leaders were dead. They were caught off-guard, and our Meng family managed to raid them all within two hours. The Eastcalm branch was wiped out. Only one Mortal Shedding realm expert escaped.\u201d\u201cFrom this day forth, the Skydemon Sect will become blind in Eastcalm Prefecture. They will not be able to infiltrate Eastcalm Prefecture and establish a complete intelligence network for the next few years.\u201d Fairy Meng smiled. \u201cMeng Chuan, you have done a great deed for Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s citizens.\u201dMeng Chuan also smiled, feeling very happy.Without the Skydemon Sect to stir up trouble behind their backs, Eastcalm Prefecture would be much safer. However, he also knew that with time, the Skydemon Sect would gradually infiltrate Eastcalm Prefecture again.\u201cThese books were found in the Eastcalm Branch\u2019s lairs. They are suitable for you to read,\u201d said Fairy Meng. \u201cRead them and see if you can broaden your horizons.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. Meng Chuan began flipping through the books.These books mainly described the world\u2019s secrets. The Skydemon Sect was responsible for investigating all kinds of information concerning humans. Many of the books contained knowledge he had never seen before.The world is split into three. The humans have three great dynasties\u2014the Great Zhou Dynasty, the Black Sand Dynasty, and the Great Yue Dynasty. The Great Zhou Dynasty was established by the oldest sect in the world, Archean Mountain. The Black Sand Dynasty was established by Black Sand Grotto-Heaven. The Great Yue Dynasty was established by Two World Island. Meng Chuan nodded slightly. As for Archean Mountain, Black Sand Grotto-Heaven, Two World Island\u2026 They are the three supreme sects of the human race.The three great sects have powerful Godfiends in them. Together, they fend off the demons\u2019 invasion. The demons are really strong.Meng Chuan read the intelligence records. The demons were more powerful than humans.The three human sects had been trying their best to defend against them. They were completely on the defensive! Godfiends presided over the various large cities. For instance, famous Godfiends like King Calm Sea presided over important city gates and protected the entire human race.However, the three sects had not completely lost any territory over the years. Even if they were temporarily occupied by the demons, they would quickly be reoccupied.These dregs from the Skydemon Sect. The more he read, the angrier he became.Some people thought there was no hope for humans. Some who wanted the benefits the demons could bring them. In short, they formed a sect\u2014the Skydemon Sect\u2014that had infiltrated the human race. The Skydemon Sect lurked everywhere, providing information on the humans to the demons. They earned immense hatred from humans. This time, the Skydemon Sect branch Meng Chuan had wiped out was but a grain of sand in the grand scheme.I\u2019m still a mortal. What I can do is still minuscule. I need to become stronger.\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe destruction of the Skydemon Sect\u2019s Eastcalm branch happened in silence. It was only known by Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s higher echelons. As for the three Eastcalm Branch leaders\u2019 deaths, the Imperial Court recorded Fairy Meng to be the one responsible.The days of Eastcalm Prefecture grew increasingly peaceful and serene.On the 25th of March, the Jadesun Palace announced that Yan Jin had comprehended Sword Force. Once the news spread, it immediately shook all five Godfiend family clans in the Eastcalm Prefecture. After all, he had comprehended Force at the age of seventeen. He was indeed extremely dazzling, a genius that was comparable to Patriarch Zhang.Three days later, the Meng family announced that Meng Chuan had comprehended Saber Force. When Yun Fu\u2019an of the Yun family learned of the news, he smashed all his favorite porcelain in his study. The Meng family\u2019s status also rose among the five Godfiend family clans. None of the other four Godfiend family clans dared to underestimate them any further.

It turned the area blurry, and he stared solemnly at the distant Meng Chuan.By now, the eighteen-year-old Yan Jin had also reached the Seamless realm! He had challenged a group of experts who were well-versed with Force in Eastcalm Prefecture. In fact, he had even challenged the three Core Condensation realm experts in Eastcalm Prefecture\u2014Yun Fucheng, Zhang Yong, and Bai Shuwan. He had defeated all of them! In terms of sword arts alone, he was one of the top mortals in Eastcalm Prefecture. In addition, he had a powerful Godfiend foundation, and his strength and speed far surpassed ordinary Core Condensation experts. Thus, he was able to defeat the three of them.However, there was one person he couldn\u2019t defeat, and that was Meng Chuan!\u201cYan Jin, this will be the last move in our sparring match today.\u201d Dressed in a navy-blue robe, Meng Chuan held a saber in one hand while standing in the distance. He attacked the moment he finished speaking.Swoosh!Meng Chuan phased away and entered the icy aura. Although the freezing aura affected his speed and vision, the lightning in his body sparked and propelled him forward at incredulous speeds. He still exceeded Yan Jin in every way despite the negative effects on him.Swish! A saber beam lit up\u2014without the sound of the wind\u2014as he cleaved down. With his saber technique reaching this stage, even the air was no longer an obstacle.Yan Jin tried his best to block the attack with both swords.In the blink of an eye, eight Meng Chuans appeared, each slashing out different saber beams. All of them aimed at a weakness in Yan Jin\u2019s dual-wielding sword technique. Meng Chuan didn\u2019t have any clone techniques. The clones resulted from his movement techniques. These eight saber beams flew towards Yan Jin one after another.Yan Jin could clearly sense Meng Chuan\u2019s eight slashes using his domain of ice and frost. His swords blocked the attacks one after another, but he felt Meng Chuan\u2019s strikes tearing apart his swords in a bid to find his weaknesses. However, Yan Jin used all his strength to block the eight strikes, forcing Meng Chuan\u2019s attacks to fail.Swoosh.In the blink of an eye, Meng Chuan retreated dozens of feet away. The speed made Yan Jin\u2019s eyelids twitch.His speed was simply too terrifying. It was said that cultivating a Lightning Divine Body meant speed, but Meng Chuan\u2019s speed was that of a peerless genius\u2019!\u201cYan Jin, your Turtle Sword Art is becoming more and more powerful. Even my saber technique is unable to crack it.\u201d Meng Chuan laughed. \u201cForget it. There\u2019s no need to compete anymore.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Yan Jin retracted his swords and looked at Meng Chuan. He said seriously, \u201cI know you are helping me hone my sword technique.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m also training my saber techniques.\u201d Meng Chuan walked to a nearby table and drank a cup of tea he poured himself.Liu Qiyue\u2014who was sitting by the stone table and reading a book\u2014had also matured. However, she was now half a head shorter than Meng Chuan. Mainly because he was 18, making him much taller than before.\u201cYan Jin, Ah Chuan\u2019s movement technique and saber arts are fast. He can attack and retreat as he wishes. You can\u2019t hurt him at all. Just give up,\u201d said Liu Qiyue with a pout.\u201cI know, but as long as my sword techniques can hold him back, there\u2019s a chance of defeating him,\u201d said Yan Jin seriously.\u201cQiyue, Yan Jin\u2019s Yin-Yang Icefire Sword Technique is very dangerous. I don\u2019t even dare to fight him,\u201d said Meng Chuan.His Godfiend foundation was extremely robust, and Yan Jin\u2019s Godfiend foundation wasn\u2019t inferior to his.In accordance with the nine cultivation commandments he collated, he pursued the extremes and pushed his speed to the limit. As for Yan Jin, he focused on using dual-sword techniques and was more skilled in frontal combat.He was only a step faster in his cultivation.He had comprehended Saber Force over half a year faster than Yan Jin. This gained him the upper hand during their matches, but he still had no way of defeating him.It was different if he used the Power of the Soul, but he needed to keep it a secret. He wouldn\u2019t use it unless it were a dire situation. In a normal sparring match, he would only use the Power of the Soul when sparring with his grandaunt.\u201cMeng Chuan, you\u2019re going to Archean Mountain this year, right?\u201d asked Yan Jin.\u201cOf course.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.Yan Jin nodded slightly and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll compete again in a month.\u201d With that said, he turned around and left.\u201cThis Yan Jin is very arrogant. He doesn\u2019t understand the ways of the world and often comes to our place, but he has never brought us any gifts. His words are also cold. Speaking of which, Ah Chuan, you even saved his life.\u201d Liu Qiyue complained after Yan Jin left.\u201cWith that temper of his, he\u2019s already being very polite to us. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have bothered talking to you. Furthermore, the reason why I\u2019m competing with him is because his sword techniques are indeed able to temper my saber arts.\u201dIf he were to encounter Murong You again\u2014even if he didn\u2019t employ the Power of the Soul\u2014he could easily crush and kill him. However, Meng Chuan didn\u2019t let it get to his head at all.After reading through the intelligence from the Eastcalm branch, he knew how intense the situation between the humans and demons was. He needed to be stronger. In this era, if he didn\u2019t use the Power of the Soul, he wouldn\u2019t even be ranked in the top twenty amongst all the young geniuses in the world. For instance, his grandaunt had mentioned King Calm Sea\u2019s fifth son\u2014who had comprehended Force at thirteen and became a Godfiend at fifteen. There were many who were more outstanding than him. Of course, most of these famous geniuses had already entered Archean Mountain.\u201cWhat? The demons invaded human territory 129 times two years ago?\u201d Liu Qiyue looked at the book and exclaimed, \u201cAh Chuan, are the books in your study speaking the truth?\u201dMeng Chuan glanced at her. It was one of the many books his grandaunt had sent over.\u201cThey are.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. \u201cWe have been at a disadvantage in our war with demons! The demons are more powerful, but this is ultimately the human world. The demons live in the Demon Realm. They have to enter through a World Entrance. Humans have constructed large city passes at the permanent and stable World Entrances, and have powerful Godfiends guarding them.\u201cThe demons invaded 129 times two years ago because of the World Entrances that spontaneously appeared. This allowed the demons to storm in. As for World Entrances\u2026 the vast majority of them are unstable. Some exist for half a day, while some exist for about two weeks. They will ultimately disappear. The ones that can exist perpetually are few.\u201cFor example, our Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s Qinyang Pass has been the only permanent World Entrance in the past 800 years.\u201dLiu Qiyue closed the book. The information in the book made her shudder.\u201cToo many people have died. Many people die in every invasion.\u201d Liu Qiyue\u2019s voice was a little weak.\u201cI saw it with my own eyes when I was six,\u201d Meng Chuan said calmly. \u201cThat time, one county city after another fell, and more than a hundred thousand humans were slaughtered. Fortunately, Godfiends arrived. Otherwise, I would have died in that monster invasion.\u201dThe reason why every city had a Jadesun Palace built was to protect the large, heavily-populated cities. In dire situations, they could mobilize nearby Godfiends to reinforce a county city\u2019s defenses.\u201cOh, right. Ah Chuan, will you be attending this year\u2019s Jadesun Palace Demon-Slaying Meet?\u201d Liu Qiyue asked. \u201cIt\u2019s still half a month away.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already promised the dean that I\u2019ll be there when the time comes,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve also realized the secret technique, and you should be the only sharpshooter in the eight Dao Academies who has done so.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLiu Qiyue perked up. \u201cOf course. But compared to Ah Chuan and that Yan Jin, I\u2019m still too far from the two of you.\u201dMeng Chuan smiled.Time had passed quickly. In a few more days, it would be three months since he reached the Seamless realm. His Quintessential Energy was almost perfected, and he could attempt to condense a core.I wonder if I can succeed in my first attempt.In all of Eastcalm Prefecture, there were only three people who had succeeded in condensing a core below the Godfiend level.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50: Core CondensationA few days later\u2026In the dead of night, Meng Chuan sat cross-legged on his bed. Moonlight shone onto his body through the window.My Lightning Divine Body is completely perfected. I can now attempt to condense my core. Meng Chuan was filled with anticipation.Mortal cultivation had five major realms.The realm with the slowest progress and expended the most cultivation resources was the Mortal Shedding realm. This was when a person began shedding one\u2019s mortal coils and gradually possessed Godfiend powers. During this process, one would need to consume a large number of supplements like lucidum or ginseng pills to support the expenditure. For instance, even with the Meng family providing him a limitless supply of supplements, it took him nearly three years before he completed the shedding process.For those who were not wealthy enough\u2014without sufficient supplements to allow their bodies to undergo a mortal shedding\u2014their body\u2019s transformation would be slow. It was normal for them to spend ten to twenty years. Furthermore, they would be \u201cmalnourished.\u201d Their physical bodies and Quintessential Energy would also be weaker than experts of the same level.The Zhou family\u2014the instigator of the Idle Stone Garden battle\u2014had given a thousand-year-old ginseng that was worth ten thousand taels to Meng Chuan as an apology gift. It was meant for their young master when he underwent his Mortal Shedding cultivation. This was a testament to how expensive cultivation was in the Mortal Shedding realm. Many Mortal Shedding experts took up jobs as guards and subordinates to earn resources for their cultivation.If they were talented, the family clan would view them in a different light.For example, Meng Chuan and Yan Jin not only had sufficient resources, but they also had all kinds of natural treasures to establish their Godfiend foundation.For Mei Yuanzhi, he was groomed by the Dao Academy and the Godfiend families, allowing him to complete his Mortal Shedding in three years. However, they couldn\u2019t provide him rare treasures that could establish a strong Godfiend foundation. Mei Yuanzhi\u2019s talent was still a little lacking in the end, and he failed to enter Archean Mountain. If he had the talent of King Calm Sea\u2019s fifth son, he would have been recruited by Archean Mountain and groomed tremendously even if he were a commoner.On the contrary, the Seamless realm expended the least.As long as one broke through to the Seamless realm, they just needed a few months of preparation to reach the mortal body\u2019s pinnacle. There was no point in cultivating any further once this happened. If one wished to improve their body further, they had to become a Godfiend!Using Quintessential Energy to condense a core. That\u2019s the final threshold before the Life-and-Death juncture. Meng Chuan\u2019s eyes were filled with anticipation.Eastcalm Prefecture only had three Core Condensation experts.But in the past few decades, almost all of the geniuses who had appeared in Eastcalm Prefecture had fought in wars to accumulate contribution credits. A few of them had succeeded in condensing a core.For example, Fairy Meng had become an outer sect disciple of Archean Mountain. She had been fighting outside all this while. Her teammates were all equally talented as her, and almost all of them had succeeded in condensing a core. They worked hard together to accumulate credits in exchange for a chance to attempt the Life-and-Death juncture. Fairy Meng had managed to obtain a chance to enter the Godfiend Blood Pool and attempt a breakthrough after she had enough credits. Failure meant death. She succeeded and absorbed the powers within the Godfiend Blood Pool to become a true Godfiend. But most of her companions\u2014those who had already successfully condensed a core\u2014died in battle while accumulating credit. They didn\u2019t even have the chance to enter the Godfiend Blood Pool.There were only two people who made an attempt. Only Fairy Meng succeeded.Mei Yuanzhi would take a similar path. The path to becoming a Godfiend was that difficult. If he couldn\u2019t enter Archean Mountain, he could only work hard and accumulate credit for a chance to enter the Godfiend Blood Pool.The three Core Condensation experts in Eastcalm Prefecture, such as Yun Fucheng stayed in the prefecture to live peaceful lives because they no longer had any hope of becoming Godfiends. Those who still had hope remained on the battlefield.With the body seamless, Quintessential Energy will condense into a core. That\u2019s just one prerequisite for becoming a Godfiend. The sooner I succeed, the better. Meng Chuan closed his eyes. It\u2019s time.Inside his dantian, concentrated Quintessential Energy gathered. After a mortal body reached the peak, the Quintessential Energy in one\u2019s dantian would reach maximum concentration.Arise!The thick, mist-like Quintessential Energy began to fuse with Meng Chuan\u2019s Force. The wisps of Quintessential Energy fused with Saber Force. It allowed Quintessential Energy to undergo a qualitative change. The prerequisite for condensing a core required the comprehension of Force.Wisps of Quintessential Energy condensed into saber lights that were much denser than before. They began to revolve and gather in the center like countless small fish.Condense! Condense!Meng Chuan put his all into controlling the Quintessential Energy, compressing it with full force. The more compressed it was, the better. Once the density reached a certain level, it would completely change.As the revolutions and pressure continued, some of the saber light in the innermost region began to wear away and was squeezed into a ball.Revolution, compression, condensation!One\u2019s Saber Force had to be strong enough before one had a chance of successfully condensing the core. Otherwise, it would disperse. Many experts who had comprehended Force were unable to condense a core for the rest of their lives.Meng Chuan had comprehended Saber Force at the age of 16. In the past two years, he had been cultivating arduously every day. He had also cultivated the remnant moves of the Lightning Devastator Saber and had improved tremendously. This was how he could suppress Yan Jin without using his Power of the Soul.His Saber Force was quite strong.Boom!After his Quintessential Energy revolved for over an hour, Meng Chuan heard a rumbling sound from his dantian. Saber lights and Quintessential Energy swirled around for a long time before finally turning into a tiny sphere. This was also known as the Essence Core. The Essence Core was white in color, and his Quintessential Energy had been completely converted into Quintessential Essence. The power of Quintessential Essence was much greater.The same move, but with Quintessential Essence complementing the body, could unleash greater strength and speed, making it far more powerful.I succeeded! Meng Chuan opened his eyes and smiled. He extended his finger.Chi! Chi! Chi!Lightning danced across his finger tips.\u201cAfter condensing a core, I can finally release lightning,\u201d Meng Chuan muttered softly. Previously, the lightning within his body could only increase the speed of circulation. Now, he could release it to affect the enemy.If he were to become a Godfiend, he could blast out lightning with a wave of his hand! It would be normal for him to transform into lightning to travel.There\u2019s one final step left to becoming a Godfiend\u2014the Life-and-Death Juncture.Disciples of Archean Mountain didn\u2019t need to risk their lives to accumulate credit, but they had to be absolutely confident before they entered the Godfiend Blood Pool.As for Fairy Meng, Mei Yuanzhi, and others who were lacking in talent, they needed to accumulate credit to exchange for opportunities. However, even if they were not fully confident, they could still attempt to make a breakthrough. This was because it was an opportunity they had risked their lives for.From the standpoint of the human race, it was better not to waste precious resources like the Godfiend Blood Pool on those with low hopes of success.But sometimes, people needed to be given hope!When breaking through in the Godfiend Blood Pool, I will be struck by lightning because I have a Lightning Divine Body. My Life-and-Death juncture will be extremely difficult. I need to make even more preparations.Standing in front of the window and staring out at the bright moon, Meng Chuan was still in a good mood.He had sworn an oath when he was six. Now, he was getting closer and closer to becoming a Godfiend.\u2026The days in Eastcalm Prefecture were very peaceful. Many people within the city began to discuss the upcoming Demon-Slaying Meet that was held once every three years! The last time, Meng Chuan and Yan Jin had shone the brightest. Now that both elites had already gained insights into Force, what would happen this time?\u201cI heard that the Wind Center Dao Academy has a disciple named Zhang Fan. He figured out the secret technique at seventeen. The Zhang family has produced another powerful figure.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. The Blazing Sun Dao Academy has a female archer named Liu Qiyue. She\u2019s not from a Godfiend family clan either. She realized the secret technique at sixteen. Her talent is even greater. She should be the most impressive at this Demon-Slaying Meet.\u201d\u201cHave you forgotten? I heard that this year, both Young Masters Meng Chuan and Yan Jin will be last to go on stage.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Yan Jin is truly formidable. He has defeated three Core Condensation experts. Young Master Meng Chuan also comprehended Force at the same time. He is also quite impressive.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI did hear that Young Master Yan Jin has visited Mirror Lake Meng Manor many times, but he has never won.\u201dIn the tea house at night, the people were chatting very excitedly. Some people in Eastcalm Prefecture were drinking in restaurants or having fun at brothels, while ordinary people had gone to bed early.And at this moment\u2014Fifty feet beneath Eastcalm Prefecture, land began to twist and distort. Some of the dirt and rocks were reduced to dust. On the other side of the distorted region, there was a mountain, and a giant bird hundreds of feet wide flying in the sky. Soon, a black beam rose up from a distant mountain, landing near this distorted area. It was a black ape carrying a staff.The black ape looked towards the distorted space, a savage look in its eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He turned to look at a residence. With a gentle nudge, he silently obliterated the locked door.\u201cOh?\u201d The elder who was sweeping in the yard looked up in puzzlement. He saw that his door had already disappeared. Dust floated around as the gray-robed man walked in.\u201cAnswer me.\u201d The gray-robed man\u2019s voice was hoarse as he looked at the old man with his green eyes. \u201cWhich country, state, and city is this?\u201dA thick demonic aura enveloped the old man.The old man\u2019s eyes lost their luster as he said in a daze, \u201cThis is the Great Zhou Dynasty, Wu State, Eastcalm Prefecture City.\u201dThe gray-robed man continued to walk into the residence, while the old man collapsed to the ground, dead.Creak. Another door opened, and a middle-aged man stretched his back and walked out. At the same time, he shouted, \u201cDad, Dad\u2026\u201dSuddenly, he saw the gray-robed man walking over, as well as his elderly father\u2014who had collapsed in the courtyard. The middle-aged man\u2019s eyes turned dull and lifeless.\u201cTell me, which country, state, and city is this?\u201d the gray-robed man asked again.\u201cThis is the Great Zhou Dynasty, Wu State, Eastcalm Prefecture City,\u201d the middle-aged man replied in a daze.And then, the gray-robed man turned and left.As for the seven people inside the residence, they died silently.\u2026Jadesun Palace.Palace Lord Jadesun sat in a lotus position, cultivating as his body was covered in a white glow. Suddenly, he felt the jade pendant around his waist burn, causing his heart to palpitate. The white glow around his body immediately converged, and he retrieved the black jade pendant hidden at his waist.The black jade pendant was currently glowing red.\u201cEast.\u201d Palace Lord Jadesun held the black jade pendant and had an ugly expression. \u201cA demon monarch?\u201dThis Demon Seeking Token was given to him by Archean Mountain, and he carried it with him. It would immediately sense the release of a demon monarch\u2019s demonic aura within a twenty-five-kilometer radius.Jadesun Palace was situated in the middle of the city; a radius of twenty-five kilometers covered the entire city. Many prefecture cities in the Great Zhou Dynasty ranged from ten kilometers in diameter to forty kilometers in diameter.Of course, if a demon monarch didn\u2019t use any demonic spells, the token wouldn\u2019t be able to sense a restrained demonic aura. However, as long as a demon monarch wanted to do something, they would eventually have to use some demonic spells.A demon monarch appeared in Eastcalm Prefecture? Palace Lord Jadesun was alarmed. His figure flashed as he exited the room and stood atop the palace.\u201cIn that direction.\u201d Palace Lord Jadesun followed the direction indicated by the jade pendant and hurried over.\u2026The gray-robed man selected three families in a row and asked the same question.\u201cTime to leave.\u201d The gray-robed man came to a nearby river that was only twenty feet wide. With a single step, he entered the river, then disappeared into it.\u2026Swoosh.Palace Lord Jadesun landed on the roof of a five-storied restaurant. He looked towards the east with a solemn expression, \u201cThe demonic aura has completely vanished.\u201dSwish! Swish! Swish!However, Palace Lord Jadesun kept following the jade pendant\u2019s directions. In less than a minute, he arrived at the spot where the demonic aura first appeared.Three families killed. Palace Lord Jadesun stood on the roof and easily determined everything. \u201cThe corpses aren\u2019t damaged at all. This demon monarch was very careful and didn\u2019t make a sound.\u201d Palace Lord Jadesun frowned. A demon monarch suddenly appeared in our Eastcalm Prefecture? Could it be that a World Entrance has appeared in Eastcalm Prefecture?Demon monarchs were extremely cautious.It was extremely rare for them to enter a human city alone. In a lesser-known city like Eastcalm Prefecture, to have a demon monarch appear without any warning meant a high chance that a new World Entrance had appeared in Eastcalm Prefecture.If this really is a new World Entrance, the demon invasion of Eastcalm Prefecture can happen at any moment. Palace Lord Jadesun\u2019s heart tightened.\u2026Moments later.Fairy Meng\u2014who was holding onto a walking stick\u2014and Yun Wanhai arrived at Jadesun Palace.Fairy Meng and Yun Wanhai bowed slightly. \u201cPalace Lord.\u201d\u201cPlease take a seat.\u201d Palace Lord Jadesun sat with a solemn expression. \u201cI have bad news.\u201dFairy Meng\u2019s and Yun Wanhai\u2019s expressions changed slightly.\u201cJust a moment ago, the Demon Seeking Token discovered a demon monarch in Eastcalm,\u201d said Palace Lord Jadesun. \u201cThat demon monarch silently used his demonic spells to kill three families before disappearing. I summoned the two of you at the fastest speed possible.\u201d\u201cDemon monarch?\u201d\u201cWhy would a demon monarch appear in Eastcalm Prefecture? Could it be that there\u2019s a World Entrance?\u201d Fairy Meng\u2019s and Wanhai\u2019s expressions changed.Palace Lord Jadesun nodded. \u201cI share the same thoughts. It\u2019s highly possible. Currently, there are only three of us in Eastcalm Prefecture. If the demons really do invade, we need to join forces to slay the demon monarchs who are the demon leaders as quickly as possible.\u201d\u201cSince a demon monarch sneaked in,\u201d said Fairy Meng, leaning on her walking stick, \u201cthere\u2019s a high chance that he\u2019s a scout. He wants to confirm which city this is. Once he learns that it\u2019s Eastcalm Prefecture, the demons will know Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s approximate strength since they have information on every human city. They will only charge in based on their confidence level. It will be very difficult for us to deal with them.\u201d\u201cI wonder how many demon monarchs will come.\u201d Yun Wanhai felt tremendous pressure.They had to fight. Only when there was zero hope or if Palace Lord Jadesun gave the order could they choose to flee.Desertion was a grave sin for Godfiends. The punishments meted out by Archean Mountain were very severe. An execution was normal.\u201cI haven\u2019t had a real chance to fight in three years,\u201d said Palace Lord Jadesun coldly. \u201cApart from myself, no one knows how much my strength has increased in the past three years. This time, the two of you only need to assist me. We will kill their strongest demon monarch in one fell swoop. These demons have immense fighting spirit when they gain the upper hand, but once their leader is killed, the demons below them will flee in fright.\u201d\u201cAt the mortal realm, we humans are at a disadvantage.\u201d Fairy Meng nodded. \u201cThe only way to survive is to slay the demon monarchs.\u201d\u201cFairy Meng, I need your reconnaissance spells,\u201d said Palace Lord Jadesun seriously. \u201cBrother Yun, I need you to help me restrain the other demon monarchs.\u201d\u201cI will definitely do my best,\u201d said Fairy Meng and Yun Wanhai.Soon, Fairy Meng and Yun Wanhai came to the entrance of Jadesun Palace and instructed their family members.\u201cReturn to the ancestral mansion and tell the clan leader that there might be demons invading the Eastcalm Prefecture City. Tell them to prepare according to the plans set up by the clan.\u201d Fairy Meng instructed a clan member before instructing another. \u201cQuickly head to Mirror Lake Meng Manor and find Meng Chuan. Tell him that there might be demons invading Eastcalm Prefecture. Let him\u2026\u201dAfter giving detailed instructions, the two clan members headed towards the ancestral mansion and Mirror Lake.Having also instructed his clansmen, Yun Wanhai walked over and said with a smile, \u201cFairy Meng, I never expected that we would be fighting alongside each other.\u201d\u201cWe can call it fate,\u201d said Fairy Meng with a smile.Regardless of the conflict between the two families, in the face of a demon invasion, their conflict was considered trivial.Yun Wanhai and Fairy Meng returned to Jadesun Palace. From this moment onwards, Palace Lord Jadesun, Fairy Meng, and Yun Wanhai had to be together at all times. They were Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s only hope. They were not to be separated! They would be easily defeated if they were separated.\u2026Dawn.Meng Chuan, Liu Qiyue, Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai sat together to have breakfast.\u201cUncle Liu and I have some matters to tend to. We won\u2019t be coming back for lunch today.\u201d Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai stood up.\u201cOkay.\u201d Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue tersely responded.Liu Qiyue also finished her meal very quickly. Then, she stood up and carried the quiver on her back. She smiled and said, \u201cAh Chuan, I\u2019m done eating too. I\u2019ll be heading to the Dao Academy to practice my archery.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAre you coming back for lunch?\u201d Meng Chuan asked.\u201cI can\u2019t be sure.\u201d Liu Qiyue smiled, waved, and ran out.She was currently at the late-stages of the Mortal Shedding realm and had figured out the secret technique. Her archery skills were extremely impressive. The training grounds in Mirror Lake Meng Manor were too small for a sharpshooter like herself. Liu Qiyue went to the Dao Academy every day to practice archery. The largest archery range in the Dao Academy let her shoot at dummy targets across the lake. The archery range spanned 3000 feet.Although Liu Qiyue was the best sharpshooter from the eight Dao Academies, she only trained at distances of 1000 feet. This was the most effective range for her to deliver her prowess.The Demon-Slaying Meet is in a few days later. Qiyue really is trying her best, hoping to showcase her strength well. Meng Chuan also smiled and finished his meal before heading to the training grounds for his cultivation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In front of the demon army was a group of demon monarchs. Their auras were different as they looked respectfully at a stocky demon monarch who was about 50 feet tall. This stocky demon king was Mountain Lord Nine Convocation\u2014who commanded a region spanning 250 kilometers. He had over ten demon monarchs and over a hundred thousand demons under his command. His fame was widespread.The gray-robed man walked out from the distorted region and respectfully came before Mountain Lord Nine Convocation. \u201cMountain Lord, on the other side of the World Entrance is the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s Wu State\u2019s Eastcalm Prefecture City.\u201d\u201cEastcalm Prefecture City?\u201d The towering, muscular Mountain Lord Nine Convocation had a gaping mouth and an ugly look on his face. He spoke with a booming voice. \u201cA mere prefecture city wouldn\u2019t be a problem for an invasion.\u201dImmediately, the eyes of the demon monarchs around him filled with ardor. A prefecture city didn\u2019t pose a tremendous threat.\u201cThis World Entrance is too small.\u201d Mountain Lord Nine Convocation looked down. \u201cIt only allows entry to second Firmament demon monarchs.\u201d\u201cDemon Monarch Ape, Demon Monarch Domineering Roar, Demon Monarch Poison Pool,\u201d said Mountain Lord Nine Convocation.\u201cPresent.\u201d Immediately, the pole-wielding, black-furred Ape, the black mist-enveloped Poison Pool, and Domineering Roar\u2014who was a hundred-feet tall\u2014bowed respectfully.\u201cThe three of you are rather powerful second Firmament demon monarchs.\u201d Mountain Lord Nine Convocation\u2019s gaze landed on a white-haired leopard demon monarch. \u201cWhitesink, you should be able to break through to the third Firmament, right?\u201d\u201cI still need a few days of preparation,\u201d said the white-furred leopard demon monarch respectfully.Mountain Lord Nine Convocation flipped his hand. A black bottle appeared, and he threw it at Whitesink.Demon Monarch Whitesink received it reverently; his eyes lit up when he saw the contents.\u201cThis is a snake blood crystal I obtained when killing that poisonous snake in the north. With your preparations, you will immediately enter the third Firmament upon consuming it,\u201d said Mountain Lord Nine Convocation. \u201cConsume it after you enter the human world. After killing the Godfiends in Eastcalm Prefecture, head to the nearest Qinyang Pass. We will also attack from the outside in concert with you. Even if we can\u2019t storm Qinyang Pass, you will be able to retreat to the Demon Realm.\u201dThe unstable World Entrance only allowed a second Firmament demon monarch to enter and exit.Once he broke through, Demon Monarch Whitesink wouldn\u2019t be able to return through the unstable World Entrance. The closest return point was through Qinyang Pass.\u201cYes,\u201d replied Whitesink reverently.\u201cDemon Monarch Whitesink, lead Ape, Domineering Roar, and Poison Pool to flatten Eastcalm Prefecture,\u201d said Mountain Lord Nine Convocation.\u201cYes.\u201d The four demon monarchs replied respectfully.Although Mountain Lord Nine Convocation had more than ten demon monarchs under his command, most of them were first Firmament demon monarchs! First Firmament demon monarchs were newly promoted demon monarchs with weak foundations. As long as they cultivated for some time, they had a chance of reaching the second Firmament.Therefore, the demons wouldn\u2019t let first Firmament demon monarchs take the lead in battle. First Firmament demon monarchs still had great potential. On the contrary, second Firmament demon monarchs were the main force! This was because the vast majority of demon monarchs stopped at the second Firmament. Reaching the third Firmament? It was very difficult. As for cultivating to Mountain Lord Nine Convocation\u2019s level, the difficulty didn\u2019t need elaboration.\u201cThe four of you will lead a total of 18,000-strong troops. Set off now,\u201d instructed Mountain Lord Nine Convocation.The four demon monarchs immediately turned to look at the demon army behind them.Mountain Lord Nine Convocation had taken a few hours to summon these 18,000 demons, the maximum he could muster at such short notice. Although he commanded more than a hundred thousand demons, they were scattered across the 250-kilometer region.In addition, Mountain Lord Nine Convocation had to be careful. The Eastcalm Prefecture was an ordinary human city, but if a powerful human Godfiend happened to pass by, no matter how many subordinates he sent, he would be sending them to their deaths! An army consisting of four demon monarchs and nearly one-score thousand demons was very suitable. Under normal circumstances, such a force was enough to flatten Eastcalm Prefecture. Even if they were wiped out due to unexpected situations, it didn\u2019t significantly weaken their strength.\u201cSet off.\u201d Demon Monarch Whitesink gave the order.The four demon monarchs were the first to charge into the distorted region. The largest demon monarch\u2014Domineering Roar\u2014shrank to 30-feet high and passed through the World Entrance. Following them were 18 commanders of the demon army, over 100 lieutenant commanders, over 1000 ordinary greater demons, and more than 10000 lesser demons.The World Entrance was of limited size. To have such a huge army pass through required ten minutes.\u2026Swish! Swish! Swish!Demon Monarch Whitesink led Demon Monarchs Ape, Domineering Roar, and Poison Pool to the surface. Without any hesitation, Demon Monarch Whitesink swallowed the blood crystal in the black bottle. His entire body reddened instantly as his aura expanded rapidly. As for Domineering Roar, he reverted to his original size\u2014a height over 100 feet. He was even taller than the most luxurious restaurant in Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201cHuman Godfiends are in that direction.\u201d Whitesink pointed into the distance. \u201cCharge.\u201dDomineering Roar grinned. \u201cKill the Godfiends, then flatten Eastcalm Prefecture. Kill all the humans. Leave no one alive.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d The four demon monarchs immediately flew towards Jadesun Palace.Ape transformed into a black beam of light, being the fastest and most agile. Poison Pool\u2019s entire body turned into a black fog that floated over the roofs. As for Domineering Roar, he took large strides, causing the land to quake. Every step he took crushed the houses beneath as his towering hundred-foot-tall figure rushed forward. And in the blink of an eye, Whitesink\u2014who had broken through to the third Firmament\u2014released his demonic aura. He was the most domineering. Even the towering Domineering Roar paled in comparison.\u201cSplit up according to your respective squads and kill all the humans.\u201d A large number of demons followed behind closely before scattering and moved out with their respective squads.Every squad had a lieutenant commander, ten greater demons, and ninety lesser demons.To be a demon lieutenant commander, they had to be able to release their demonic aura! There were even some lieutenant commanders who had already condensed their demon cores.\u201cHumans.\u201d\u201cPuny humans.\u201dThese demons quickly dispersed and began attacking the humans they encountered on the way.\u201cSeek out the eight Dao Academies in Eastcalm Prefecture and kill the disciples. They are of priority.\u201d A large group of demons began to head to the eight Dao Academies\u2019 positions. They had long obtained a map of Eastcalm Prefecture and knew their locations.Dao Academies were the hope of a city! The youths and geniuses that came out of the Dao Academies were possible future Godfiends.When it came to killing humans, demons would attack the Dao Academies first! Slaying all the disciples in the Dao Academies wiped out an entire generation for ten years.\u2026\u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201dPalace Lord Jadesun sensed the unconcealed demonic aurae. Yun Wanhai wore a solemn expression as Fairy Meng slammed her walking stick on the ground. Invisible waves rippled out as she probed a radius of five kilometers with a thought. What Fairy Meng saw made her face distort uglily. She said, \u201cThere are four demon monarchs in total. One of them is a third Firmament demon monarch. The rest are second Firmament demon monarchs.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Yun Wanhai\u2019s expression changed. \u201cThe unstable World Entrance actually allowed a third Firmament demon monarch to pass through?\u201dClang! Clang! Clang! Clang!Suddenly, a bell rang out within the Jadesun Palace. Several Seamless realm experts were striking the bells with hammers repeatedly. The bell-ringing spread throughout the entire city.In Eastcalm Prefecture City, where many hawkers had set up stalls, everyone\u2014pedestrians, people at home who were cooking breakfast, and disciples who had begun cultivating in the Dao Academies\u2014was stunned when they heard the bells. Their expressions changed. All of the hawkers ran as fast as they could, ignoring their stalls. The pedestrians also ran.\u201cQuick, hide!\u201d\u201cQuick!\u201dEvery region had deep tunnels. Over 100 people of all ages and gender ran towards the tunnels.\u201cStay here. Don\u2019t come out,\u201d a man and his wife said.\u201cDad, Dad\u2026\u201d their daughter shouted.\u201cDaddy has to fight the demons.\u201d The man smiled as he held his spear and rushed out.Decree when encountering demons:Everyone below the Marrow Cleansing realm shall hide in the tunnels.Those at the Marrow Cleansing realm and above\u2014regardless of gender or age\u2014have to fight the demons.Reaching the Marrow Cleansing realm means one will serve the military when they are twenty. Most of the men and women who fight have experience battling demons.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026At Mirror Lake Meng Manor, Meng Chuan had been cultivating his Saber Drawing Stance when he suddenly heard the bells ringing. The guards who had been helping him stopped, while Meng Chuan\u2019s expression changed.These bells\u2026 At this level of urgency\u2026 He had heard them once when he was six years old.\u201cAssemble, head to the nearest Dao Academy,\u201d the guards in the manor immediately shouted. They were veterans. Their peaceful lives in the city hadn\u2019t worn away their fighting spirit. They had long gotten used to this due to their five years of military service. When they encountered demons, it was a fight to the death! Everyone had to fight to the death!At this moment, the entire Eastcalm Prefecture would become a battlefield. Anyone at or above the Marrow Cleansing realm had to take up arms!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53: One Man, One Blade\u201cUncle Qian.\u201d Meng Chuan gave orders. \u201cOpen the armory and let everyone choose from it. After everyone at and above the Marrow Cleansing realm chooses their armor and weapons, immediately head to Mirror Lake Dao Academy.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Everyone responded in unison, their eyes filled with fervor and fighting spirit.The Dao Academies needed to be well-protected. Eastcalm Prefecture City was currently being attacked by the demons. The whole city was in danger. The other Dao Academies were too far to head to. Even the ancestral mansion was over five kilometers away. It was simply too difficult for these guards to cover such a distance. They might perish along the way. As for Mirror Lake Dao Academy, it was very close.Swoosh. A figure charged into the Meng Manor and arrived at the training grounds.The figure hurriedly called out, \u201cMeng Chuan!\u201d It was a black-haired elder.\u201cFifth Elder.\u201d Meng Chuan immediately recognized the person.\u201cFairy\u2019s orders,\u201d said the black-haired elder in a low voice. \u201cEastcalm Prefecture is in grave danger, so you are allowed to do anything. However, please protect the 3000 clansmen in the ancestral mansion! The five Godfiend family clans will also be the focus of the demons\u2019 attack. Also, if Fairy and the others were to die in battle and the demon monarchs win, countless people in Eastcalm Prefecture will flee. You must also flee, but do so alone. You are the entire Meng family\u2019s hope. Don\u2019t fall into a dire situation.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. He knew what his grandaunt\u2019s intentions were.The demon monarchs were now being held down by the Godfiends. With Meng Chuan\u2019s speed, no one could stop him if he wanted to leave! Thus, he was permitted to take any action. She even hoped that he could protect the 3000 clansmen at the ancestral mansion.If the Godfiends were defeated, the demon monarchs would be free to massacre the entire prefecture. By then, Meng Chuan would have to flee!\u201cI\u2019ll be returning to the ancestral mansion immediately. Are you coming with me?\u201d asked the black-haired elder.\u201cI\u2019ll head over to save Qiyue first. Qiyue is still on the way to Blazing Sun Dao Academy,\u201d said Meng Chuan. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the ancestral mansion after saving Qiyue.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The black-haired elder turned and left. Time was precious.Swoosh.Meng Chuan took a step forward and leaped past the yard wall. He was like a wisp of smoke that flew across houses as he headed straight for Blazing Sun Dao Academy. His sensory domain spanned half a kilometer, so he was confident that he could find Liu Qiyue immediately once he was near.Qiyue is in the Mortal Shedding realm; she\u2019s an archer who\u2019s not good at close combat. It will be troublesome if she encounters a horde of demons. Meng Chuan\u2019s heart burned with anxiety.They grew up together.Qiyue was very important to him. He had to protect her. Although his father and Uncle Liu were outside, they had long achieved Force and had years of experience fighting demons on the battlefield. Working together, there were high chances they could deal with dangerous situations. Most importantly, he had no idea where his father had gone. Searching for him would be futile. However, he knew Qiyue had gone to Blazing Sun Dao Academy.Swish! Swish! Swish!Meng Chuan moved very quickly. Suddenly, he saw something a distance away.From afar, ugly figures were running on the streets. Some were running on the roofs while others were flying in the sky. Demons were generally taller than humans, and it was common for them to be over ten feet tall. Sometimes, one could even see massive demons about 20 to 30 feet tall! All sorts of demons were maniacally advancing, charging towards Meng Chuan.There are so many demons. Meng Chuan\u2019s heart tightened. From the looks of it, the World Entrance is somewhere in that direction, Meng Chuan guessed. The demons head in different directions once they exit the World Entrance.There\u2019s no way to avoid demons on the way to Blazing Sun Dao Academy. I can only storm my way through. Meng Chuan didn\u2019t slow down as he rushed into the demon army.Under normal circumstances, a mortal realm individual\u2019s strength was rather useless against an army. However, Meng Chuan\u2019s abilities bolstered his courage. He could sense everything within half a kilometer. With his extraordinary speed, he feared nothing.Oh? As he ran, he got closer to the demon army. At a glance, he saw many demons engaged in battle.Human experts were holding them back.Roar! A wolf demon was entangled by a net. It let out an angry roar but couldn\u2019t tear the net apart. Following that, three short spears shot out from a house and pierced through the wolf demon\u2019s body. It fell to the ground, devoid of any life.\u201cLet\u2019s charge in.\u201d Immediately, five demons charged into the house. The room was filled with traps, and three human experts were lying in ambush.The moment the demons rushed in, two demons were entangled in ropes before short spears killed them!Ropes were the easiest to obtain and could be quickly set up. Therefore, it was basic knowledge for humans\u2014who had served in the military\u2014to set up rope traps. Clearly, there were many ropes traps set up in the house. However, the demons were no fools. Only two demons succumbed to the traps before the two-storied building was partially destroyed.If one were to say that the combat skills of the human experts were very brilliant\u2014with them setting up traps and working together\u2014demons only had one skill. All they did was charge forward and kill!\u201cFrom the looks of it, the three of us are about to die here,\u201d said an elderly, one-armed man holding a saber as he chuckled.A single-eyed woman was carrying a short spear sack on her back. She wielded a short spear in each hand and once again threw them at the demons. The threat she posed at short distances\u2014like in the room\u2014was extremely high, but the mantis demon at the very front easily blocked it. The single-eyed woman smiled as well. \u201cThe three of us are in the Marrow Cleansing realm. Killing three lesser demons makes our sacrifice worth it.\u201d\u201cMadam, Uncle Zhang, let\u2019s do it again. Every demon taken down helps,\u201d said a tall man holding a shield and a large axe.The overall strength of the demons was far greater than that of humans.For example, in this 18,000-strong demon army that had been deployed, there were more than two hundred demons that could release their demonic aura! As for Eastcalm Prefecture, only about twenty humans had comprehended Force. Although humans could generally single-handedly deal with two or even three demons, the most powerful members of the demon army were the eighteen commanders! These commanders all had top-notch demon monarch bloodlines. They were several times stronger than ordinary Core Condensation humans. These commanders were all capable of crushing the human Core Condensation experts.The weakest lesser demons among the demons\u2026 No matter how brutish they were in battle, they had bodies on par with humans in the Mortal Shedding realm. With the decree in effect, Marrow Cleansing realm experts had to use traps, allowing them to use their cooperative techniques to put up a fight against the demons.Therefore, even the Godfiends admitted that in the mortal realm, demons could indeed crush humans.However, Godfiends were no weaker than demon monarchs. As long as the Godfiends won, slaying the ordinary demons would be much easier.\u201cKill!\u201d The tall, muscular man, the single-eyed woman, and the one-armed elder went into a frenzy. They braced themselves for a final battle as the three demons lunged forward to tear the three humans apart.Swoosh.A saber beam flashed past. The saber beam sliced through the three demons. The three demons were cut in half, and their bodies convulsed on the ground.Meng Chuan\u2019s figure appeared near the house momentarily before he left quickly.Looking at the three demons that were instantly killed, the stocky man, the single-eyed woman, and the one-armed elder were stunned to see the distant Meng Chuan.\u201cIt\u2019s Young Master Meng.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Meng saved us.\u201d The three of them felt joy from surviving a calamity. They obviously wanted to live, if possible.\u201cWhy would Young Master Meng take the initiative to attack the demon army?\u201d The one-eyed woman was puzzled.\u201cDon\u2019t waste time thinking about it. Hurry up, we need to defend Uncle Zhang\u2019s place,\u201d urged the tall man. The three of them immediately abandoned the house and went to the next ambush spot.During a demon invasion, humans used the terrain to their advantage. They set up traps in the entire city. This was the most efficient method. There was really no way for them to defeat the demons if they fought head-on.\u2026\u201cThere are humans resisting over there. Head there.\u201d The demon army was advancing. At the same time, some greater demons led the lesser demons to bring hell upon an area.The demons could afford to lose a lesser demon for the life of a Marrow Cleansing expert. After all, the Marrow Cleansing experts in Eastcalm City only numbered five to six thousand.Meng Chuan slaughtered demons along the way. When his saber beams killed more than ten demons, he immediately attracted the attention of two demon lieutenant commanders.\u201cThat human is very powerful. He should be a human who has comprehended Force.\u201d\u201cSurround him and kill him.\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe two demon lieutenant commanders led over a hundred demons to surround him.This scene was also noticed by the black bear demon commander, who was half a kilometer away. It was fifty-foot tall, far taller than an ordinary restaurant.\u201cDeal with that human quickly. Head to Mirror Lake Dao Academy and destroy it.\u201d The black bear demon commander gave the order. It had a Black Mountain demon monarch bloodline. Normal Core Condensation bear demons were about twenty to thirty feet tall. However, this one was fifty feet tall\u2026 Its strength was several times greater than the typical Core Condensation bear demon. Its body was much stronger, so it naturally took up the position of a commander.It had immense strength. It could crush an ordinary house with a single step. Its voice rumbled, echoing about a kilometer away.\u201cHead to Mirror Lake Dao Academy.\u201d\u201cHead to Mirror Lake Dao Academy.\u201dMany demon lieutenant commanders under its command began repeating the order.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cQuickly, kill this human.\u201d The two demon lieutenant commanders who were surrounding him heard the bear commander\u2019s instructions. They were also rather anxious as large groups of demons swarmed Meng Chuan.Head to Mirror Lake Dao Academy? Meng Chuan\u2019s eyelids twitched as a cold glint flashed in his eyes.As the eldest senior brother of Mirror Lake Dao Academy, his choice of first rescuing Qiyue before heading to the ancestral mansion made him feel like he had let down Mirror Lake Dao Academy.At this moment, he saw the thousand-odd demon army heading towards Mirror Lake Dao Academy. His killing intent was cold.Once I kill the demon commander, the threat of this demon army will be halved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Five avian demons swooped down from the sky.Meng Chuan also felt pressure.These two demon lieutenant commanders. One of them can release their demonic aura while the other has condensed a demon core. Meng Chuan immediately determined his opponents\u2019 strength through his perception. There are also 19 greater demons and 176 lesser demons. As long as a demon restrains me, a horde of demons will immediately rush over. The two lieutenant commanders will then kill me.Although I\u2019m stronger than the two demon lieutenant commanders, my strength is limited. Once I\u2019m restrained, I will be torn apart.This was the battlefield. A large group of demons lunged at him. If not for his sensory domain, he would have long dodged the demon army.\u201cKill!\u201d Although he felt a little wistful, his speed did not slow down. Compared to experts in the same realm, he was very good at dealing with group attacks. He could even make his enemies hit themselves!Meng Chuan unleashed terrifying speed, transforming into a blur and charged towards one of the demons in the group.\u201cHe isn\u2019t dodging and instead charged over?\u201d\u201cStop him.\u201d\u201cQuick!\u201dThese two hundred demons were somewhat scattered and had yet to completely surround him before Meng Chuan took the initiative to attack.You\u2019re too slow. As Meng Chuan rushed forward, he unsheathed his saber, and the blade lit up.With one saber beam, three demons were sliced apart. The saber beams flashed again and again.He charged straight towards the black bear demon Commander. Several saber beams flashed, and the 30 demons that barely managed to gather around him were easily culled. A single saber beam was about twenty to thirty feet long. It sliced the demons into two. This left the other demons\u2014who were prepared to pounce over\u2014shuddering in fear. Even their charging speed slowed down.He sensed the demons charging towards him as he swung his saber repeatedly; his speed could not help but slow down.\u201cMake way.\u201d Two demon lieutenant commanders charged over. One was a spider demoness, while the other was a goat demon.The spider demoness was faster. She had six arms that each held a scimitar. She was the first to reach fifty feet within Meng Chuan. Without warning, she opened her mouth, and a white spider web flew out, enveloping Meng Chuan. The distance was too close, and its speed was too fast.However, having been forged in the crucible of arrow volleys, Meng Chuan\u2019s reaction speed had been honed to new heights. Besides, everything within a hundred feet was within his sensory domain! The moment the spider demoness opened her mouth, Meng Chuan was immediately prepared.His figure vanished.The white spider web only covered two unlucky lesser demons. The two lesser demons wailed in pain as they rapidly turned into meat paste as they were pinned to the ground by the spider web. When the spider demoness saw her killer move dodged, she was somewhat indignant.\u201cKill!\u201d Meng Chuan used his movement technique and attacked the two demon lieutenant commanders.The spider demoness brandished her scimitars. and instantly, a slew of saber slashes rained upon Meng Chuan. As for the goat demon, he engaged in close combat.Pfft. Pfft.Meng Chuan moved to a spot between the two demon lieutenant commanders. His control of the situation was very fine. He could see the traces of the two demon lieutenant commanders\u2019 attacks clearly. With a saber beam, one of the spider demoness\u2019 scimitars was redirected towards the goat demon.What\u2019s going on? The spider demoness and the goat demon were alarmed. Why were they attacking each other?They didn\u2019t know that two of the Skydemon Sect\u2019s Eastcalm branch\u2019s leaders had once encountered a similar situation before. However, Meng Chuan had only managed to do so by using the Power of the Soul previously. Now, he could accomplish it easily.Clang! The goat demon immediately blocked the spider demoness\u2019s attack.Pfft.Following the spider demoness\u2019s attack was a silent and gentle slash from Meng Chuan.What? The goat demon\u2019s heart jolted. The saber beam had already reached its neck, and soon, its head flew up.The goat lieutenant commander was dead.The spider demoness immediately thought something was amiss, but Meng Chuan turned his head and furiously chopped down. This was the first strike of the Five Lightning Descent! It was extremely fast, and lightning was released. The power of the lightning was still very weak, so it would\u2019ve been easily resisted by the spider demoness\u2019s powerful body\u2014not causing any negative effects. However, the terrifying power of that strike made it extremely difficult to block it. Fortunately, the demoness had a total of six arms. The six scimitars were barely able to block it. Even so, an opening was revealed.The second strike came with even more speed.When the spider demoness sensed the danger of death, she immediately opened her mouth and attempted to spit out another web. Just as her mouth opened, Meng Chuan sensed it extremely clearly. At this distance, he didn\u2019t want to have a taste of the spider web. He imbued his second strike with the Power of the Soul, causing the saber beam to move faster by 30 percent. Following the opening the spider demoness revealed, the beam sliced across her neck.Before the spider demoness could spit out the spider web, her head flew up.The lieutenant commanders\u2014the goat demon and the spider demoness\u2014died in battle one after another.The surrounding demons were alarmed. These two lieutenant commanders were powerful. One was capable of releasing their demonic aura while the other had condensed a demon core. Yet, they were killed in just one or two moves?I can\u2019t be caught by them. Meng Chuan knew very well that he had already used a few tricks.In terms of strength, he was indeed superior to the two demon lieutenant commanders. However, the strength difference wasn\u2019t ridiculously large. In a one-on-one fight, his opponent would use forbidden techniques. He would\u2019ve then needed two to three moves to kill the goat demon. He would\u2019ve needed ten moves to kill the spider demoness.However, if he were to engage in a drawn-out battle, he would have long been surrounded by more demons. He needed to seize every opportunity to save Qiyue. Therefore, he had to pass through the demons\u2019 obstructions quickly!He first used his speed and made them hit each other, then taking the opportunity to kill the goat demon with one strike. Afterward, he used his full strength and fused a wisp of his Power of the Soul into his saber art, thus quickly killing the spider demoness.Swoosh.Meng Chuan rushed towards the black bear demon commander. He felt the pressure and had schemed to finish the two demon lieutenant commanders in quick succession.However, in the eyes of the surrounding demons, this human was simply too terrifying! First, he wantonly decimated the ordinary demons that surrounded him before killing two demon lieutenant commanders in the blink of an eye. He was so powerful that it was inconceivable for anyone who wasn\u2019t a Godfiend or demon monarch.\u201cOh?\u201d The demon lieutenant commanders in the distance noticed the deaths of the goat demon and spider demoness\u2014who had similar strengths as them. They felt threatened.Furthermore, not only did Meng Chuan not choose to escape, but he also rushed towards the black bear demon commander.\u201cYou killed two of my lieutenant commanders?\u201d The black bear demon commander watched from afar. His fifty-foot tall body was a lot taller than the surrounding buildings. His arms were even thicker than ordinary trees, and he stared coldly at the puny human.\u201cSince he has a death wish, surround him. Don\u2019t let him escape,\u201d said the black bear demon commander. \u201cI want to crush this ant to death.\u201d\u201cSurround him.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let him escape.\u201d\u201cSurround him.\u201dThe army that had been charging towards Mirror Lake Dao Academy with all their might stopped under the lieutenant commanders\u2019 orders and began surrounding Meng Chuan.Almost a thousand demons\u2014spread across a region that spanned over half a kilometer\u2014began to surround him. The pressure on Meng Chuan was immense.Meng Chuan\u2019s gaze turned cold.If they were to reach Mirror Lake Dao Academy, the Dao Academy would really be in big trouble. With the aid of armaments, the Dao Academy can still fend off ordinary demons. However, it would be rather difficult for them to face demon lieutenant commanders. If they encountered a demon commander\u2026 they would probably need a large number of people to help with the defense. They would need to rely on numbers to make up for the difference in strength.\u201cCatch him.\u201d The black bear demon commander pointed at the charging Meng Chuan.A hundred demons near the commander pounced over.\u201cKill!\u201dAt this moment, Meng Chuan drew his saber. He lashed out wildly.Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Saber beams that were several dozens of feet long flew out. In the blink of an eye, Meng Chuan had swung his saber over a hundred times.The saber beams surged towards the demons that pounced at him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter comprehending Force, he could release Quintessential Energy. After condensing his core, Quintessential Energy would undergo a qualitative change and become Quintessential Essence. His foundation was even more robust than an expert in the same realm. His body and Quintessential Essence were several times stronger! The saber beams formed by Quintessential Essence even drew in the Heaven and Earth powers to form beams that were dozens of feet long! Over 100 dense saber beams flew out, scaring the demons.Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft\u2014The saber beams were too fast. Although the large group of demons fled in panic, they were mostly sliced apart. Some demons were cut in half. Some saber beams sliced through three demons at once.In the blink of an eye, over half of the hundred demons died. Only a dozen demons were lucky enough to survive. They were too frightened to charge forward.My Quintessential Essence has been depleted by half in an instant. I really can\u2019t do this too often. Meng Chuan felt his dantian become much more empty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55: Black Bear Demon CommanderThe massacre by saber beams left many demons astounded.\u201cAll of you, get lost.\u201d The black bear demon commander stared coldly at the puny human. Then, he let out a guttural roar. The demons around him were so frightened they hurriedly ran far away. They knew how terrifying their commander was. If a battle occurred, those around him might be implicated. Such implications only had one outcome\u2014death.When he saw demons running away from the black bear demon commander, Meng Chuan immediately became more cautious. Despite his cautiousness, he still charged at the black bear demon commander at maximum speed.Anybody who wasn\u2019t a Godfiend or demon monarch\u2026 None could frighten him!The black bear demon commander stood still and coldly glared at Meng Chuan. When Meng Chuan was 100-feet away from him, the black bear demon commander suddenly roared.Growl\u2014Like thunder, the sound waves produced by the roar blasted forward in a fan-shaped manner. The surrounding houses trembled from the sound wave vibrations and collapsed.Meng Chuan was shocked by the roar, but he hurriedly sealed his ears with Quintessential Essence. But, even though he had sealed his ears, his entire body turned numb from vibrations. He felt a little dizzy, and his nose started to bleed uncontrollably.Boom! After roaring, the black bear demon commander took a step forward. It was as though a mountain was charging towards Meng Chuan. His giant foot stomped down on Meng Chuan.Despite bearing the brunt of the vibrations, Meng Chuan was still able to maintain clarity of his mind. Within his hundred-foot sensory domain, he could sense the black bear commander clearly.With a whoosh, he dodged the giant foot and slashed at the bear demon\u2019s head. However, Meng Chuan felt his vision turn dark. A giant bear paw brought whistling black wind as it flew towards Meng Chuan.Not good. Meng Chuan rapidly circulated his Quintessential Essence. Lightning faintly erupted from his body, and he switched directions in midair, dodging to the side. The giant bear\u2019s paw and the whistling black wind swept past him in a harrowing manner.\u201cDie!\u201d The black bear demon commander roared as he struck out with his paws. The terrifying attack stirred the Heaven and Earth powers.Black winds howled around Meng Chuan. Using his movement technique amidst the black wind was exhausting.A pair of giant bear paws struck out at high speed. The strength of the paw strike was simply inconceivable. Meng Chuan\u2019s Godfiend foundation was more robust than peers in his realm, but his strength was still inferior to the black bear demon commander\u2019s.Yan Jin is good at frontal assaults. His strength is much greater than mine. Perhaps he can withstand the black bear demon commander\u2019s strike. If I\u2019m not using the Power of the Soul, I\u2019ll lose the ability to resist if I get struck, even if I don\u2019t die.However, he wasn\u2019t flustered. After all, his speed was insane!Whoosh\u2014Lightning curled around Meng Chuan\u2019s body. With two blinding flashes, he arrived behind the black bear demon commander.\u201cKill!\u201d Meng Chuan attacked the black bear demon commander from behind.The black bear demon commander immediately turned around and waved his giant bear paws.Meng Chuan\u2019s lightning-bright figure flashed repeatedly within the black wind generated by the bear demon.This human is really fast. The black bear demon commander was astonished. In terms of movement techniques, he was far inferior to Meng Chuan. However, his paws had long been trained to be agile and swift. He could produce black wind to suppress his surrounding enemies. He was originally very confident, but he was slightly flustered now. His paws couldn\u2019t touch the human.Pfft.The black bear demon commander\u2019s paw missed once again. Meng Chuan seized the opportunity and slashed at the black bear demon commander.Chi! Chi! Chi! Meng Chuan\u2019s expression changed.The black bear demon commander\u2019s extremely tough fur was five feet long. By the time Meng Chuan\u2019s saber beams sliced through the fur and bear hide, the attacks lacked power. The thick skin membrane beneath the bear hide blocked the attacks easily.This strike failed to see blood.Too thick. Its fur is five feet long, and the bear hide is three feet thick\u2026 I can\u2019t damage it at all. Meng Chuan immediately understood his limitations.This black bear demon commander had immense strength, a strong defense, and a pair of paws containing terrifying might. It even generated strong gusts of wind.Growl\u2014After the Meng Chuan\u2019s failed attack, the demon commander\u2019s eyes flashed with a cold glint. With the close distance between the two, the bear demon immediately roared.Meng Chuan immediately sensed his opponent\u2019s actions using his hundred-foot domain.Roar\u2014 At the close distance, the roar was like a thunderclap, and the sonic waves inundated him.Boom!With a thought, Meng Chuan infused the Power of the Soul into his whole body.Meng Chuan could only hear his beating heart, his breathing, and rushing blood. Every fiber, every bone, and every tendon in his body had Quintessential Essence flowing through them via the meridians. His control over his body soared.Meng Chuan wasn\u2019t very willing to imbue his body with the Power of the Soul because it would exhaust the Power of the Soul reserves greatly. He could only do this five times! After using it five times, he would take half a day to recover. The entire Eastcalm Prefecture City was currently a battlefield. He had to conserve his Power of the Soul as much as he could to prevent any accidents from occurring.If he were in a hopeless situation, he could lose his life without the Power of the Soul.However, the saber strike he delivered earlier showed how ridiculously tough the bear demon\u2019s hide was. He was unable to injure it. He had to use the Power of the Soul to elevate his strength to kill his opponent. As long as he could kill the black bear demon commander, the fight Mirror Lake Dao Academy would face would be much easier.Swoosh.His Quintessential Essence fused with his body perfectly. The huge leap in strength and speed multiplied his combat power several-fold. His speed had reached a whole new level. The lightning curling around his body increased in density by ten times. It was as though he had become a lightning god.Swoosh.He stepped on the bear demon\u2019s body, leaving behind an afterimage. Following that, he delivered a slash!Boom!The saber beam condensed like water. It was a hundred feet long, and it swept past the black bear demon\u2019s neck.It sliced through the thick fur, bear hide, membrane, muscles\u2026It completely sliced through the bear.When speed reached a certain level, a saber beam would become extremely sharp. The sharpness exceeded what the black bear demon commander\u2019s body could handle. The body that the bear demon was proud of could not withstand such a strike.The black bear demon head\u2014which was much larger than a house\u2014flew up into the air. The black bear demon commander\u2019s eyes were still filled with disbelief. He couldn\u2019t understand why the other party could suddenly kill him with a single strike despite having the upper hand previously. The strike was so fast that he was unable to withstand or block it. Its sharpness was not something his body could defend against.The black bear demon commander was dead.Time to leave. Meng Chuan didn\u2019t stop as lightning curled around his body unceasingly. He transformed into a bolt of lightning and rushed towards Blazing Sun Dao Academy.\u2026Nearby demons were watching from afar. They had been filled with confidence in their commander.When they saw Meng Chuan fail to injure the commander with his first strike, many demons laughed.\u201cThis human is truly laughable.\u201d\u201cCommander has the Black Mountain demon monarch bloodline. His body is like a mountain. In the entire Nine Convocation fief, Commander\u2019s body is the strongest beneath demon monarchs.\u201d\u201cHis blade is scratching an itch for Commander.\u201d\u201cHe has been hit by Commander\u2019s roar at such close distance. He\u2019s dead.\u201dThe demons watched with smiles.But following that, the figure enveloped by lightning produced a terrifying strike! The aqueous saber beam beheaded the bear demon, causing all the demons to fall silent.The black bear demon commander was dead? Killed by a single slash?As they watched the figure rapidly depart, no demons attempted to stop him! They were completely terrified.Ordinary demons would be sliced apart by saber beams. If a lieutenant commander went over? Even the commander had been killed with one strike, so wouldn\u2019t it be tempting fate if a lieutenant commander went over?\u201cThe commander is dead. What should we do?\u201d The remaining eight lieutenant commanders hesitated.Immediately, a snake demon commander said, \u201cThere are always casualties when attacking a human city. Since the commander is dead, we have to continue heading for our destination. Attack Mirror Lake Dao Academy.\u201d\u201cA human Dao Academy is the most heavily guarded. All sides will provide reinforcements. With the Commander around, we could invade it, but it\u2019s not ideal to go there now. We should go somewhere else. We can still kill humans this way.\u201d\u201cTo the Dao Academy, that is our most important goal.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point if we can\u2019t kill them? Let\u2019s kill the other humans in the city!\u201d The eight commanders began to squabble.The demons followed the law of the jungle. None of the eight commanders could completely restrain their peers.Hence, this demon army began to disperse. Some continued advancing and prepared to head to Mirror Lake Dao Academy to see if any other demon armies were attacking it. If there were, they could then join in. Some had completely given up on attacking Mirror Lake Dao Academy and began to hunt down the humans in Eastcalm Prefecture.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026I\u2019ve done all I can. Without a commander\u2019s threat, Mirror Lake Dao Academy should be able to hold on. Meng Chuan turned into a blur as he rushed forward. I have to find Qiyue right now.He had already wasted time due to his skirmish. He couldn\u2019t afford to waste any more time.Swish! Swish! Swish!He hurried at full speed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56: Blazing Sun Dao AcademyIn the early morning, Liu Qiyue left Mirror Lake Meng Manor and used her movement technique to flit across the street along the river. Occasionally, she would fly hundreds of feet across the river surface. Occasionally, she would step on a tree branch, moving in an elegant and lithe manner. To Liu Qiyue, the path from home to the Dao Academy was suitable for practicing movement techniques. A sharpshooter had to have brilliant movement techniques.This way, they could quickly pull away from approaching enemies! Liu Qiyue felt pressured with a genius like Meng Chuan beside her.In her eyes, Ah Chuan was simply too hardworking! Every day, he trained by carrying out 8000 Saber Drawing Stance repetitions, and he would cultivate for an hour under arrow fire. He also had the Swaying Moonfall and other moves to train. Even after he had comprehended Force, he remained diligent.This made Liu Qiyue feel like it was a sin to relax. Thus, she put her heart and mind into cultivating. Although she was still inferior to Meng Chuan\u2019s and Yan Jin\u2019s mad cultivating speed, it was much better than before. This was also why she had comprehended the secret technique last year.As she cultivated her movement technique during her commute, her traveling speed was faster than Meng Chuan had expected.When the Jadesun Palace alarm bells sounded throughout the entire city, Liu Qiyue was only a kilometer away from Blazing Sun Academy.A demon invasion? When Liu Qiyue heard the bells, her expression changed drastically. Her speed increased rapidly. She raised her speed to her limits and charged towards Blazing Sun Dao Academy. Hawkers and pedestrians on the streets all rushed to different places.Whoosh.Liu Qiyue was at the late-stage of the Mortal Shedding realm, and she had also comprehended the secret technique. Her movement speed was still extremely fast.When she was 1000 feet away from Blazing Sun Dao Academy, she saw a demon army appear behind her. Demons had appeared everywhere. On the streets, rooftops, and in the sky, all of them headed towards Blazing Sun Dao Academy. This scene made Liu Qiyue\u2019s heart palpitate. It was her first time seeing so many demons.\u201cQuick, quick.\u201d\u201cQuickly enter the Dao Academy.\u201d At the entrance of the Dao Academy, there were a group of people, such as the dean, lecturers, and many soldiers. There were eight Dao Academies, and each Dao Academy was next to a military encampment. Therefore, soldiers could immediately come and reinforce their defenses.Swish! Swish! Swish!Many Dao Academy disciples\u2019 faces flushed red as they rushed to the Dao Academy with their movement techniques.Most of the disciples from Blazing Sun Dao Academy lived in the Dao Academy. As the forts in the countryside sent many people over, they stayed in the Dao Academy since they didn\u2019t have any other places to live in. There were quite a few locals who lived in the Dao Academy as well. After all, ordinary residences didn\u2019t have cultivation grounds. Only a few disciples commuted to the Dao Academy daily.However, this small number numbered nearly 1000 disciples.The dean and the others were extremely anxious. Based on the time, 1000 disciples would be en route. Some had arrived while others were still on their way.\u201cLiu Qiyue, quickly go in.\u201d When the dean saw Liu Qiyue arrive, he immediately waved his hand.\u201cYes.\u201d Liu Qiyue rushed into the Dao Academy. She turned around and saw many adults dressed in armor and wielding weapons. They quickly rushed over. Most of them were in the Marrow Cleansing realm, some were in the Mortal Shedding realm, and a few experts were in the Seamless realm. The few Seamless realm experts were each carrying a young man with an arm. There was an especially strong man who carried an additional two youths on his back. His hands were empty as he rushed in with large strides.\u201cFind me an axe. To run faster while carrying these two punks, I threw away my axe.\u201d The burly man ran at surprisingly fast speeds, and quickly threw the four young men and women he carried with him.\u201cBrother Wang, don\u2019t worry. There are plenty of weapons in the Dao Academy,\u201d said the dean immediately.\u201cI\u2019ll head out to save a few more.\u201d The burly man turned around and ran out.The dean of Blazing Sun Dao Academy and a number of the soldiers were holding bows and arrows. When the demons approached 2000-feet, the dean\u2014who had comprehended Force\u2014would be the first to shoot an arrow.Swoosh.The arrow shot through the air, leaving behind an afterimage as it pierced through an enormous elephant demon\u2019s head, causing it to collapse.\u201cThe demon army is here.\u201d Liu Qiyue also retrieved her bow and arrows from her back. She also wanted to help, but with the demon\u2019s speed, she was only confident of killing them within a distance of 1000-feet.\u201cQuick, quick! Everyone is to enter the Dao Academy!\u201d The dean\u2019s expression changed. \u201cThe demon commander is here. Quick!\u201d\u201cQuick!\u201d All the soldiers, as well as a few Seamless realm experts\u2014who had tried their best to save more people\u2014had a change in expression. All of them rushed towards the Dao Academy.Having served in the military at Qinyang Pass, they knew how terrifying a demon commander was! Fighting a demon commander head on meant certain death.\u2026Meng Chuan traveled at full speed.Swish! Swish! Swish!They deserve death. With a single glance, Meng Chuan could see the many human corpses in the distance. When the demon army came through the World Entrance and entered Eastcalm Prefecture, they quickly spread out in all directions. When Jadesun Palace sounded the alarm, quite a few humans had already perished. This was especially true for those who were too close to the demon army. Those weak humans didn\u2019t even have the time to hide in the tunnels.Many ordinary people\u2014who didn\u2019t have any talent in cultivation\u2014were slaughtered by the demons.Corpses were everywhere.After passing by that area, Meng Chuan\u2019s face darkened.Demons deserve to be killed. They deserve death! Meng Chuan quickly rushed forward, but he couldn\u2019t help but take in the scene around him. Suddenly, he saw something at the corner of the street.It was a young couple who used their bodies to shield a baby. However, the couple\u2019s and the baby\u2019s bodies had been impaled.Damn it! Meng Chuan\u2019s eyes turned red. He couldn\u2019t help but think of his parents.His mother charged towards the demons to fend them off. His father frantically escaped with him on his back. With tears streaming down his face, he fled without turning his head. Back then, he had survived.But the couple in front of them hadn\u2019t managed to protect their child even with their lives.I swear that I will kill all demons. I\u2019ll kill them all! Meng Chuan continued to run with red eyes.\u201cThere are humans there.\u201d From afar, ten demons were scattered as they continued pursuing humans. A father and son duo had escaped from a residential compound while three demons chased after them.Swoosh.In a flash, Meng Chuan traversed hundreds of feet. With a swing of his saber, the three demons were split into two.The fleeing father and son turned to look in disbelief.\u201cSenior Brother Meng.\u201d The youth was overjoyed.Meng Chuan turned his head to take a look and recognized that it was a junior brother from Mirror Lake Dao Academy. He nodded slightly, and with a flash, he traversed hundreds of feet again. He also passed by seven other demons. His saber glinted in the sunlight as it sliced them apart. Two saber beams pursued the fleeing demons. The seven demons were killed instantly.Meng Chuan didn\u2019t even turn his head to look and continued to move.\u201cDad, it\u2019s Senior Brother Meng. Senior Brother Meng saved us,\u201d the youth said immediately.\u201cYes, I know it\u2019s Young Master Meng.\u201d The middle-aged man was filled with excitement from surviving a calamity. He immediately said, \u201cLet\u2019s quickly hide and set up a trap again.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The youth nodded.The father and son quickly disappeared from the densely packed housing district.\u2026Meng Chuan continued advancing.Along the way, he saw young men and women dressed in Blazing Sun Dao Academy\u2019s robes. They had all died. Clearly, they were on the way to the Dao Academy and had encountered demons!Meng Chuan fell silent. At the same time, he was also searching for Liu Qiyue with great concern. Could it be that Qiyue encountered danger and fled elsewhere? Have I missed her?He felt uneasy.It\u2019s also possible Qiyue has already arrived at Blazing Sun Dao Academy. Meng Chuan prayed, but the killing intent in his heart grew stronger. He was only a kilometer away from Blazing Sun Dao Academy.Suddenly, he saw billowing smoke from a fire beacon rise up ahead of him. It was in the direction of Blazing Sun Dao Academy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt\u2019s smoke from a fire beacon. Blazing Sun Dao Academy has lit up the fire beacon? Meng Chuan\u2019s heart tightened. They can\u2019t hold out any longer?The entire Eastcalm Prefecture City had been invaded. Unless they were in a desperate situation, the Dao Academy wouldn\u2019t light the fire beacon.Meng Chuan\u2019s figure flashed twice before reaching the top of a towering tree. Looking in the direction of Blazing Sun Dao Academy, he saw a dense horde of demons surrounding it.With just a glance, his expression changed. There are about 2000 demons. There should be two demon commanders!Quick. Meng Chuan reeled in anxiety. With a flash, he dashed towards Blazing Sun Dao Academy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone in Blazing Sun Dao Academy rushed towards Blazing Sun Castle.Blazing Sun Castle was a huge fortress in Blazing Sun Dao Academy\u2014it was where the disciples usually lived.\u201cEveryone below the Marrow Cleansing realm, enter the tunnels.\u201d\u201cQuick, quick, quick.\u201dInside Blazing Sun Castle, a large number of disciples from the Dao Academy were split into dozens of teams and quickly ran into the tunnels.The construction of Blazing Sun Castle employed the best ideas gleaned from the construction of forts in the countryside, and it was much more extravagant. The Imperial Court spent a lot of money to hire high-level craftsmen to design and build it.Thousands of Dao Academy disciples entered the tunnels.Dong! Dong! Dong!Every tunnel began locking down with their various traps and mechanisms.Deactivating the traps and mechanisms could only be done from the inside. It was impossible to do so from the outside. Even if demons were to charge in, it would still take some time for them to breach the defenses.\u201cPrepare the ballistae!\u201d Large ballistae were situated at Blazing Sun Castle\u2019s windows.One by one, the Dao Academy disciples began to turn the capstan and pinned the bolts down. These Marrow Cleansing realm disciples could exert strength greater than 500 kilograms; yet, they had to use all their strength to turn the capstan. Every single bolt was like a long spear. Walls would crumble under their impact.\u201cFire!\u201d a soldier ordered.The soldiers in charge of launching the ballistae were all experienced soldiers or veteran soldiers who had experience in using ballistae during their military service. As for the disciples in the Marrow Cleansing realm, they were mainly doing manual labor, such as rotating the capstan and delivering ammunition.With the issued command, large bolts shot out one after another. Any ordinary lesser or greater demon that was hit would have a hole through their bodies.However, the demons were also dodging frantically. They crossed Blazing Sun Dao Academy\u2019s walls and charged towards the distant Blazing Sun Castle.\u201cBreach the Blazing Sun Castle.\u201d A two-stories tall ox demon held a trident. It wasn\u2019t eye-catching in the demon army, but it was the strongest. It was the commander of this demon army, Commander Ox.With Commander Ox\u2019s command, all the lieutenant commanders immediately led the charge as a large number of demons poured towards Blazing Sun Castle.Swoosh.An arrow beam streaked across the sky, faster than the ballistae bolts. A demon lieutenant commander tried his best to dodge but still had an arm shot off.\u201cEh?\u201d There were only ten lieutenant commanders in this army. Although the power of those ballistae was tremendous, the bolts themselves were extremely large. They were like spears, and their speed wasn\u2019t too exaggerated. At the very least, lieutenant commanders could easily dodge them.However, the power of this arrow was no less than the ballistae. Its speed was ten times faster, and in an instant, it appeared right in front of them. The lieutenant commanders found it hard to dodge.\u201cHuman sharpshooter.\u201d\u201cBe careful.\u201d The demon lieutenant commanders noticed the threat.The person who shot the arrow was none other than Blazing Sun Dao Academy\u2019s dean, Zhong Qianhe. He was the only Seamless realm sharpshooter in Eastcalm Prefecture that had grasped Force.\u201cHumph.\u201d Commander Ox snorted coldly and charged forward.\u201cFire!\u201d Dean Zhong immediately bombarded Commander Ox with arrows and directed thirty percent of the ballistae bolts to be shot at him.Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Commander Ox held his trident with both hands as he brandished it to block the arrows, but it was exhausting. At the same level, the relentless attacks of a sharpshooter were terrifying! Dean Zhong\u2019s barrage of arrows was enough to match Meng Chuan\u2019s close-range saber art. As a result, Commander Ox could only try his best to protect himself.\u2026With the sharpshooter\u2014Dean Zhong\u2014restraining the commander, Blazing Sun Castle was able to withstand the demon army\u2019s crazy attack.However, very quickly, everyone\u2019s expression changed.\u201cMore demons!\u201d\u201cAnother demon army!\u201dAtop Blazing Sun Castle, they could see a dense horde of demons charging towards them from afar. Clearly, it was another demon army.With the arrival of a new demon army, the demons\u2019 morale was greatly boosted! After all, they had fallen into a stalemate. They had lost many demons.\u201cPoison Wyrm, quickly help me. Help me kill that sharpshooter,\u201d Commander Ox roared.\u201cIt looks like an ox demon like you still needs my help?\u201d Commander Wyrm moved extremely quickly. He took on a humanoid form. His body was covered with green dragon scales. He had sharp claws and strong legs! He also had a dragon tail.He was extremely fast as he headed straight for Commander Ox.\u201cWe\u2019re doomed.\u201d When Dean Zhong saw this, his expression changed. It was already impressive that he could barely pin down a commander. But if two demon commanders worked together? And a group of demon lieutenant commanders? Once these demons were to ascend Blazing Sun Castle, the human casualties would be horrific.\u201cHold them back.\u201d\u201cStall for time.\u201d\u201cAs long as the Godfiends win, we can win.\u201d The soldiers were roaring angrily. They continued to shoot the ballistae with livid expressions. At the same time, they urged the frantic Dao Academy disciples, \u201cQuickly turn the capstan. Don\u2019t just stare blankly.\u201dAs a sharpshooter, Liu Qiyue was together with 12 other sharpshooters.These 12 archers were either soldiers or veterans who had returned from military service. Most of them were at the Seamless realm. Liu Qiyue was the only Dao Academy disciple. She was at the late-stage Mortal Shedding realm and had comprehended the secret technique. Thus, she was put in their squad.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Liu Qiyue and the 12 sharpshooters were the trump cards. Their arrows were extremely fast and posed a huge threat to the greater demons.Usually, three sharpshooters needed to work together to kill a greater demon. In the blink of an eye, more than fifty greater demons had died at their hands.However, their arrows posed little threat to the demon lieutenant commanders, much less the two commanders.Not good. Liu Qiyue was anxious.The demon numbers had doubled.Previously, they were in a stalemate, but now, they were completely overwhelmed. Under the two commanders\u2019 leadership, a large group of demon lieutenant commanders roared angrily as a dense horde of demons charged.I can\u2019t hold them off any longer. I can\u2019t hold them off any longer. Liu Qiyue shot out arrows crazily. She even attempted to shoot at the demon lieutenant commanders. The weakest among them could release demonic aura. Some had even condensed their demon cores. They easily blocked her arrows.Liu Qiyue was in despair as the demons got closer and closer to Blazing Sun Castle.Why are there two armies here? Dean Zhong felt despair as well. His arrows were blocked by Commanders Ox and Wyrm. They continued advancing.In fact, there were only 18 demon commanders in this invasion. Some had gone to slaughter humans; others attacked the Godfiend family clans. The rest attacked the imperial government\u2019s office. Although the eight Dao Academies were important, most of them were attacked by one demon army. Only three Dao Academies were each attacked by two demon armies. Blazing Sun Dao Academy was one of them.No. Liu Qiyue\u2019s eyes turned red as she watched the demons approach.Whoosh.Flames began to rise in her eyes, literally. Flame-like wisps of Quintessential Energy erupted from her hands. The flaming Quintessential Energy fused with her arrow.Swish. An arrow shot out. A flaming streak moved at unbelievable speeds.Boom!The flames tore through a greater demon and penetrated two greater demons and three lesser demons behind it. After the demons were struck, the flames continued burning until they were reduced to ashes.That one arrow led to a fiery death. All six demons were reduced to ashes. Many demons noticed this scene, and the two demon commanders noticed it as well.\u201cA human with a phoenix bloodline?\u201d Commander Wyrm was alarmed.\u201cPhoenix Divine Body?\u201d Commander Ox glanced at the distant sharpshooter. It was a young girl whose eyes seemed to be burning with flames.Qiyue has a Phoenix Divine Body bloodline? Dean Zhong was shocked as well.There were many types of Godfiend bodies for humans. Some Godfiend bodies could be slowly cultivated, while others were very special. They couldn\u2019t be obtained through cultivation. For example, the Phoenix Divine Body was a very special type of Godfiend body. It was passed down by blood.The demon commanders all had bloodlines of pinnacle demon monarchs. However, Liu Qiyue\u2019s Phoenix Divine Body bloodline was even stronger than theirs.\u201cQiyue, quick. Work with me to deal with the two demon commanders. Stop them,\u201d Dean Zhong immediately ordered.\u201cYes.\u201d Liu Qiyue felt her body heat up as well. A powerful might arose in her body, causing her Quintessential Energy to undergo a qualitative change. With flaming eyes, she shot at the two demon commanders without hesitation.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSwoosh.Her arrow was like a flaming stream of light. It was in no way inferior to Dean Zhong\u2019s arrow. Dean Zhong also fired arrows at full strength.Under the barrage of arrows, Commanders Ox and Wyrm could only block.\u201cPoison Wyrm, our chance is here.\u201d Commander Ox turned rather excited as he sent a voice transmission. \u201cA human with a Phoenix Divine Body bloodline has actually appeared. As long as we capture her alive, we will gain more credit than destroying a handful of Dao Academies.\u201d\u201cHehehe, this human girl is still young. Her Phoenix Divine Body bloodline is also very weak. As long as we breach this castle, we can easily capture her alive.\u201d Commander Wyrm was filled with anticipation as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They joined forces to pin down the two terrifying demon commanders.\u201cDean,\u201d Liu Qiyue said in a low voice. \u201cThe special flame is very draining on my Quintessential Energy. I can only fire another 80 arrows at most.\u201dDean Zhong wasn\u2019t surprised. Liu Qiyue was only at the late-stage of the Mortal Shedding realm. It was difficult for her to maintain the Phoenix Divine Body\u2019s abilities.\u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. We\u2019ll try our best to stall for time,\u201d said Dean Zhong with a voice transmission. \u201cWe will stall them for as long as we can! As long as the Godfiends win, we\u2019ll be saved.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Liu Qiyue nodded and shot arrows with all her might.\u201cYou can shoot slower,\u201d said Dean Zhong with a voice transmission. \u201cI\u2019ll use my full strength. Just support me. As long as we can hold back the two commanders, that\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Liu Qiyue was extremely solemn.\u2026\u201cWe can\u2019t delay. Any delay might lead to unforeseen circumstances. Perhaps, a Godfiend might come to save this human woman who has awakened her phoenix bloodline,\u201d said Commander Wyrm with a voice transmission to his companion. \u201cWe have to be fast. As long as we capture this human woman alive, we will immediately send her back to Nine Convocation fief and offer her to the Mountain Lord.\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. As long as we capture this woman, sacrificing all the demons under us will be worth it.\u201d Commander Ox agreed as well. The demons followed the law of the jungle and thought nothing of the ordinary demons beneath them. In fact, these brutal and bloody battles were something the demons were pleased to see. A brutal battle would cause many weak demons to die and also temper the powerful demons.Wasn\u2019t it good to save on food while grooming the strong if more died?Therefore, the human Godfiends that presided over important city passes would often encounter demon attacks.\u201cCharge! The two of us will hold back the two sharpshooters. Destroy this Blazing Sun Castle!\u201d Commander Ox roared.\u201cCharge, destroy Blazing Sun Castle!\u201d Commander Wyrm gave the same order.\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dImmediately, a group of demon lieutenant commanders charged forward with a large number of demons. When the two armies gathered, their numbers increased greatly. Liu Qiyue and Dean Zhong were busy holding back the two commanders. This made it easy for the lieutenant commanders. In just a few seconds, they rushed to the bottom of Blazing Sun Castle.The dense horde of demons immediately leaped up towards the windows.\u201cFire!\u201d Large bolts shot out from the windows and penetrated the demons\u2019 bodies. However, there were too many demons. Some managed to jump up to the windows.\u201cBrothers, charge!\u201d A large group of human experts was inside the castle. They blocked the demons that were flooding in through the windows.The battle at Blazing Sun Dao Academy had entered a brutal melee fight!One demon after another charged in. There were even lieutenant commanders leading the charge. The moment the lieutenant commanders struck out with their axes, the ballistae exploded. The soldiers and disciples who were operating the ballistae were sent flying backward as blood splattered everywhere. They were instantly killed.\u201cKill!\u201d The human experts held the terrain advantage. Thanks to the windows, they could fight numbers that exceeded theirs. They killed demon after demon. The demons fell to the ground.When Dean Zhong saw this cruel scene, his eyelids twitched, and he immediately ordered, \u201cLight up the fire beacon and release the smoke.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Immediately, one of the lecturers responded and went to light the fire beacon.Lighting the fire beacon meant that a Dao Academy had reached a dire situation. It wouldn\u2019t be long before it was completely destroyed.Soon, one of the large smoke pipes in Blazing Sun Castle billowed with smoke\u2014which rose into the sky. The entire Eastcalm Prefecture could see it. Whoever had survived in Eastcalm Prefecture knew what this scene meant\u2014Blazing Sun Dao Academy was in a desperate situation and was requesting help!The bloody battle in Blazing Sun Castle continued.\u201cDie.\u201d A muscular man wielding a shield and a great-axe chopped down upon a demon lieutenant commander. His body was covered in blood, and his eyes were red. But then, two lieutenant commanders joined forces and charged towards him. \u201cA human expert who has comprehended Force. Join forces and kill him.\u201dThe advantage the demons had with their overall strength was too great.The lieutenant commanders were all formidable. The greater demons were comparable to those with Seamless realm bodies. Many of them had reached the Unity realm. Even if humans had the advantage of terrain, they were still suppressed and forced to retreat constantly.As the number of demons that ascended Blazing Sun Castle increased, the humans began to lose their terrain advantage.\u201cI really can\u2019t hold on any longer.\u201d Dean Zhong looked at the pale-faced Liu Qiyue\u2014who had used up all her Quintessential Energy. Yet, she had begun desperately casting forbidden spells. He then looked at the human warriors\u2014who were forced to retreat\u2014frantically fending off the demons. Be it the experienced soldiers, the retired soldiers, or the young disciples of the Dao Academy, all of them were using forbidden spells to fight for their lives.There was no way out. They could only give it their all.\u201cEach one we take down counts. If I can take down two, it will be worth it!\u201d A crippled veteran charged forwards and put himself between the Dao Academy disciples and the demons.\u201cSenior Sister Yi, if we survive, will you marry me?\u201d\u201cYes, I promise you.\u201d\u201cDad, I\u2019ve killed demons as well.\u201d The young disciples also went into a frenzy. They had reached the Marrow Cleansing realm and were considered to have great potential among their generation. However, they had already been forced into a corner.Tears streamed down their faces as they watched their fellow disciples die in battle. They were also going all out.\u201cAre we still going to lose?\u201d Liu Qiyue\u2014who had used forbidden Godfiend spells\u2014was trembling slightly. \u201cDad and Ah Chuan\u2026 I really want to see them again.\u201dAt that moment, Liu Qiyue missed her father terribly as well as Ah Chuan.As a sharpshooter, Liu Qiyue often used Quintessential Energy to nourish her eyes. This allowed her to see things that were very far away clearly. As she stared at the two demon commanders\u2014who were located far away from Blazing Sun Castle\u2014while shooting at them, she suddenly noticed a figure clad in lightning charge over.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Liu Qiyue couldn\u2019t help but tear up. They grew up together. Although the figure was very fast, she was certain. \u201cAh Chuan! Ah Chuan is here!\u201d\u201cAh Chuan!\u201d Liu Qiyue suddenly let out a hiss, her voice sounding a little shrill. \u201cLeave! Don\u2019t come here! Leave, do you hear me!?\u201dThe entire Blazing Sun Dao Academy was in a dire situation. Before the Godfiend realm, it was impossible for mortals to rescue them with their individual strength. In the eyes of almost all mortals\u2014including Liu Qiyue and Dean Zhong\u2014the dire situation that Blazing Sun Dao Academy was facing now was only salvageable if a Godfiend came to save them.\u201cThere\u2019s a human.\u201d The demons\u2014who were still charging forward\u2014discovered a lightning-clad figure charging towards them.\u201cHow dare you attack our demon army. You must be tempting fate.\u201d\u201cTear him apart.\u201dThese demons wouldn\u2019t dare to defend against such a fast-moving human in a one-on-one fight. But now that they were two armies combined, they were surrounded by a dense cluster of allies! Their numbers bolstered their confidence. They felt that as long as it wasn\u2019t a Godfiend, they would be able to tear anyone apart if they dared to charge in.\u201cKill him.\u201d\u201cSquash him!\u201dA group of demons threw their flying axes or spat out venom. Others spewed threads, attempting to pin Meng Chuan down.Swoosh!The lightning-clad figure blurred as it streaked across the sky. Meng Chuan easily avoided many obstacles and charged into the demon horde.\u201cThis human really has a death wish.\u201d The demons rushed over crazily. Since demons were attacking Blazing Sun Castle, a dense horde of demons surrounded the castle. Instantly, nearly a hundred demons charged towards Meng Chuan with confidence.Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSix dazzling arc-ing saber beams swept across the area. Each beam was dozens of feet long, and their speed terrifying. The demons were packed too close to each other and couldn\u2019t dodge in time.With just six saber beams, he sliced through nearly a hundred demons that had come charging at him. Instantly, the entire area was filled with dismembered demon bodies. This caused the castle siege to falter slightly as many demons couldn\u2019t help but look over. After all, the two armies combined numbered about two thousand demons. And nearly a hundred had died in the blink of an eye?The soldiers, retired veterans, and Dao Academy disciples naturally noticed as well.They saw a bolt of lightning rapidly charge through the demons. Six blinding saber beams whistled through the air. Many demons were culled like wheat being harvested.\u201cYou two deal with the other demons. Leave the two commanders to me.\u201d A voice resounded throughout Blazing Sun Dao Academy as the lightning-clad figure headed straight for the two demon commanders.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everything he had seen on the way had caused strong killing intent to burn within him.He did not hold back as he charged through the demons. Wherever he passed, the demons would be slain like swine!\u201cQuickly, hide away.\u201d\u201cIs this human a Godfiend?\u201dThe demons avoided him in horror. If there were a chance of killing him, the demons wouldn\u2019t hesitate to charge forward one after another. However, the strength Meng Chuan revealed was too terrifying. Even if a group of demons charged forward, they would be killed. They weren\u2019t capable of stopping his advance or injuring him. It was a matter of tempting fate. These demons were unwilling to do so.\u201cWhat big claims. Leave this human to me,\u201d said Commander Wyrm with a voice transmission. \u201cContinue attacking Blazing Sun Castle and capture that human woman with a phoenix bloodline.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Commander Ox was also confident in his companion.Clang!Commander Wyrm stepped on Blazing Sun Dao Academy\u2019s stone pavement. Afterimages were left in his wake as he attacked.Meng Chuan charged at an even faster speed.The two clashed.Phew. Commander Wyrm\u2019s body silently emanated a colorless poisonous gas. He was called Poison Wyrm because he was good at using poison.This poison of mine can kill demon commanders with extremely powerful bodies after 30 seconds. Commander Wyrm was extremely confident. The human body is much weaker, so he can only last for a short while. Even if I don\u2019t attack, he will be poisoned to death once he breathes it in.Furthermore, he was quite skilled in close-quarters combat.Swoosh.Meng Chuan was clad in lightning. When he was close to Commander Wyrm, he immediately sensed small, distorted worms hiding in the air. These twisted worms were too small to be seen with the naked eye. However, Meng Chuan\u2019s sensory domain allowed him to sense every single worm.The tiny, translucent worms wriggled in the air.\u201cOh?\u201d Meng Chuan turned into a streak of light, moved to the edge of the poisonous gas, and gently touched it.Ever since he had condensed his core, his Quintessential Energy had transformed into Quintessential Essence\u2014which was much more powerful. Quintessential Essence could protect him and also be released as an attack. As for Meng Chuan\u2019s Godfiend foundation, it was several times stronger than that of ordinary experts. His Quintessential Essence was purer and more condensed.Once the poisonous gas came into contact with the Quintessential Essence protecting his body, his Quintessential Essence began corroding.This poisonous gas is powerful. If the poisonous gas surrounded me, my protective Quintessential Essence would be depleted in seconds. If the poison gas enters my body, the consequences would be even direr. Meng Chuan immediately concluded that he clearly couldn\u2019t fight Commander Wyrm for a prolonged period! If it dragged on, his Quintessential Essence would be completely drained. When that happened, how would he fight against his enemies?I have to use the Power of the Soul again. Meng Chuan sighed. Demon commanders are indeed formidable. The two I\u2019ve encountered\u2026 required the Power of the Soul to kill them.Boom!The Power of the Soul fused with his entire body.His control over his body and Quintessential Essence had risen to stunning levels. This feeling of control over his body still mesmerized him. The Quintessential Essence protecting his body became denser, and its resistance to the poison increased by ten-fold. He excavated more of his body\u2019s potential. Every muscle and bone came closer to perfection as they worked in concert. This raised his strength several-fold. The speed he was most proud of had reached an unimaginable level.Swish! Commander Wyrm felt like the human expert\u2014who had already been faster than him\u2014had instantly increased his speed. He couldn\u2019t even see Meng Chuan clearly.A Godfiend? Commander Wyrm shuddered and instinctively cast a forbidden spell. However, just as he unleashed a forbidden spell, a nigh-indiscernible saber beam appeared in front of it. Following that, he felt himself flying.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d He saw a headless wyrm. That\u2019s my body? I-I\u2019ve been killed? Commander Wyrm immediately understood that only his head was flying\u2014his body was still standing at its original location. This understanding didn\u2019t last long as Commander Wyrm\u2019s consciousness disappeared.\u2026The entire battlefield suddenly fell silent.Even the demons that had rushed into Blazing Sun Castle retreated a few steps and slowed down their attack. They looked at the beheaded Commander Wyrm dazedly. A commander was the spiritual center of a demon army. Every commander represented an almost invincible expert beneath the demon monarch realm. And now, Commander Wyrm was killed?\u201cPoison Wyrm?\u201d Commander Ox\u2014who was blocking Dean Zhong\u2019s arrows\u2014was also stunned. Poison Wyrm\u2014who has fought me for more than a century\u2014is dead just like that? He was killed with a single slash?\u201cHe killed a demon commander in one strike?\u201d The humans had completely different reactions from the demons. This was a pleasant surprise! Although ordinary demons could be easily killed, they didn\u2019t have confidence in Meng Chuan\u2019s fight with the demon commander.All this while, Dean Zhong and the other experts who had served the military knew a hard truth: A demon commander was virtually invincible under the realm of Godfiends and demon monarchs.It was already impressive if a peerless human genius could fight them to a standstill. But now, he had killed one with a single slash?\u201cLet\u2019s block these demons and leave the remaining commander to Meng Chuan.\u201d Dean Zhong was the first to shout loudly. His voice was several decibels louder, and the surrounding human experts heaved sighs of relief.\u201cLiu Qiyue, stop casting forbidden Godfiend spells. Just rest by the side,\u201d shouted Dean Zhong immediately.\u201cOkay.\u201d Liu Qiyue stopped casting forbidden Godfiend spells. She leaned against a wall with a pale face and stared at the familiar figure through the window.Ah Chuan is here! He killed Commander Wyrm with a single slash. Everyone is saved! She knew that Meng Chuan came for her.\u201dAh Chuan,\u201d Liu Qiyue whispered.When her childhood sweetheart rushed here to save her despite the demon invasion, Liu Qiyue could only feel a sweet warmth in her heart. Many thoughts ran through her mind, but the pain in her body made her aura weaker.The forbidden Godfiend spells dealt too much damage to her body. Fortunately, she hadn\u2019t used them for too long. If it had been any longer, she wouldn\u2019t just be aching.\u201cKill this group of demons.\u201d Dean Zhong attacked the lieutenant commanders inside Blazing Sun Castle, forcing them to dodge immediately. The archers from before couldn\u2019t threaten them, but they didn\u2019t dare to belittle Dean Zhong\u2019s arrows. If they were hit, they would either be severely injured or dead.\u201cFire!\u201d\u201cKill them!\u201dThe ballistae that were used to pin down the commanders turned and aimed at the demons that were inside Blazing Sun Castle.The long spear-like bolts fired. At close range, even the lieutenant commanders had to dodge. Many greater and lesser demons were simply penetrated.Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!Dean Zhong joined forces with the ballistae and killed a goat demon lieutenant commander.Directing the forces that had been pinning down the commanders to the lieutenant commanders had better results. Commander Wyrm\u2019s death had greatly affected the demons\u2019 morale. Many demons wondered if they should retreat. If Commander Ox died as well, that terrifying human would probably turn his sights on them.In Blazing Sun Castle, the humans\u2019 resistance grew stronger, and the morale of the demons fell precipitously. Instantly, the humans held the upper hand.\u2026Meng Chuan had been keeping tabs on the situation in Blazing Sun Castle. He heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the humans gaining the upper hand. However, the pale and weak Qiyue worried him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHuman?\u201d Commander Ox looked at him solemnly.\u201cAre you ready to die?\u201d asked Meng Chuan as he held his saber. He didn\u2019t dare underestimate the commander. When he killed Commander Wyrm, the green dragon scales had been extremely tough. If he hadn\u2019t used the Power of the Soul, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to cleave through them. This made him poignant\u2014demons had great physical advantages over humans.Ordinary demons were much stronger than humans. The bodies of these demon commanders were even more terrifying.However, he could still kill them.\u201cHuman, I can sense that your aura is still that of a mortal\u2019s,\u201d Commander Ox said in a deep voice. \u201cBut that strike of yours was terrifying. Are you a human Godfiend who has deliberately concealed your aura?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

While this was happening, another scene was playing out in Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s Jadesun Palace.Jadesun Palace had already been reduced to ruins. The battle between the Godfiends and demon monarchs was simply horrifying. All the buildings in Jadesun Palace had collapsed. Even the prisons that housed demons had been destroyed. The imprisoned demons were reduced to meat paste, before being turned into pools of blood.There was not a single bone left, only blood.Boom!Yun Wanhai was sent flying backward by a blow, and deep ravines appeared on the ground. His body was surrounded by purple flames, making him look like a flame god. However, he couldn\u2019t help but cough out blood as he lay within the ravine. His blood\u2014filled with dying violet flames\u2014sprayed onto the soil.\u201cDie!\u201d A black beam flashed as a black-furred ape swung its pole at Yun Wanhai.Fairy Meng\u2014who was standing a distance away\u2014hurriedly waved her hand with a solemn expression. An illusory hand appeared out of nowhere and grabbed the heavily injured Yun Wanhai, pulling him away. It caused the Demon Monarch Ape\u2019s pole to slam into the ground. The ensuing boom was like a thunderclap in spring. It left behind a huge crater over 100-feet wide. As for Yun Wanhai, he was rapidly sent flying thanks to the yank. He had only been a foot away from being hit by the terrifying pole.When he flew to Fairy Meng\u2019s side, Yun Wanhai whispered, \u201cFairy, you saved my life.\u201d With that said, he couldn\u2019t help but cough out blood.Fairy Meng didn\u2019t think too much of it. She looked up into the sky with a solemn expression. Invisible waves constantly emanated from her as she influenced the three demon monarchs in a bid to help Palace Lord Jadesun.At that moment, Palace Lord Jadesun\u2019s body began glowing. His palms were like jade sculptures. All his fighting prowess were in that pair of hands\u2014fist arts, palm arts, claw arts, finger arts\u2026 They were undeniably mystical! He withstood three demon monarchs head-on single-handedly. There was Demon Monarch Domineering Roar\u2014who was over a 100-feet tall and had immense strength. He also fought against a demon monarch that used poison and the third Firmament demon monarch, Whitesink.It was also because he had been going all out. Otherwise, he would\u2019ve long been doomed if he relied on the heavily injured Fairy Meng and Yun Wanhai!Following the mid-air clash, Palace Lord Jadesun fell to the ground and staggered a few steps back. When he reached Fairy Meng and company, his pale face instantly returned to normal.\u201cCan you still hold on?\u201d Palace Lord Jadesun looked at Yun Wanhai.\u201cNow that I\u2019ve used a forbidden Godfiend spell, I can only continue for another ten seconds,\u201d Yun Wanhai said in a low voice. \u201cAfter that, I will be smashed to death by that Demon Monarch Ape.\u201d\u201cPalace Lord.\u201d Fairy Meng said immediately, \u201cYun Wanhai\u2019s injuries are too serious.\u201dPalace Lord Jadesun knew that too. The enemy\u2019s strength was beyond his expectations. Amongst the four demon monarchs, the second Firmament demon monarchs were all extraordinary, much less the third Firmament Whitesink.As for their side?Fairy Meng had hidden injuries, so she could only cast her domain by the side. This was the best way for Fairy Meng to be of use in this battle. Yun Wanhai was able to take some of the heat off him. But when Demon Monarch Ape and Demon Monarch Domineering Roar joined forces, they completely crushed Yun Wanhai. In just a short clash, Yun Wanhai was nearly beaten to death despite using a forbidden Godfiend spell.Even though he was lucky not to have died, he was still severely injured. He wouldn\u2019t be of much use in the battle.Palace Lord Jadesun had to face the combined assault of four demon monarchs. This snuffed out any hope.\u201cThe entire Eastcalm Prefecture is under attack, but we have no solution at all,\u201d Yun Wanhai said via voice transmission. \u201cAre we just going to stall for time?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already requested for reinforcements from the Wu State\u2019s State City and Archean Mountain,\u201d Palace Lord Jadesun said via voice transmission. \u201cRight now, we can only hope for some powerful Godfiends that are fairly close to Eastcalm Prefecture to rescue us in time. Otherwise, the entire Eastcalm Prefecture will be reduced to rubble.\u201d\u201cStrange.\u201d Fairy Meng sent a voice transmission. \u201cWhy have the four demon monarchs stopped?\u201dYun Wanhai and Palace Lord Jadesun were equally astonished.The Godfiends had been at a disadvantage the entire battle, and the demon monarchs had the upper hand. Logically speaking, the demon monarchs should be seizing every moment to kill the three Godfiends. Why did they stop?\u2026The four demon monarchs had stopped temporarily because something very important had happened.\u201cDemon Monarch Whitesink.\u201d Demon Monarch Ape, Demon Monarch Domineering Roar, and Demon Monarch Poison Pool looked at the army\u2019s leader, Demon Monarch Whitesink.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked Domineering Roar with a voice transmission.Whitesink took out a token from his chest, and his gaze swept around. With a voice transmission, he said, \u201cThis token was bestowed to me by the Mountain Lord. It can be used to commandeer the entire army. At the same time, this token can sense the 18 commanders\u2019 tokens. I am certain that 9 of the 18 Commanders have already died.\u201d\u201cHalf of them died?\u201d Amidst the black fog, Poison Pool was extremely shocked.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Ape couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cThese commanders are virtually invincible in the mortal realm. Their opponents are all human mortals. It\u2019s very difficult for them to die in battle. How can half of them die in battle so quickly?\u201d\u201cThe moment the invasion began, I quickly sensed the death of two commanders,\u201d said Whitesink through a voice transmission. \u201cBut back then, we had to deal with the three Godfiends from Jadesun Palace. I didn\u2019t want you to be distracted, so I didn\u2019t mention it. But following that, I sensed commanders dying one after another. Just a moment ago, I sensed that in the southeastern and northern regions, three commanders died in quick succession within seconds. Now, we have already lost nine commanders. I have to mention that if this continues, I\u2019m afraid all eighteen commanders will die.\u201d\u201cHow could this be? How did the commanders die to mortals so easily? How did nine commanders get killed so easily?\u201d The other three demon monarchs turned anxious as well.Ape frowned. \u201cWe weren\u2019t in a hurry to finish the battle with the Godfiends in Jadesun Palace because we were confident that the demon army could flatten Eastcalm Prefecture. If it turns out that our demon army is destroyed, what\u2019s the point of us fighting here?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only one possibility for nine commanders to be killed.\u201d Whitesink\u2019s eyes were cold as he sent a voice transmission. \u201cThere are other Godfiends in Eastcalm Prefecture City. There might even be more than one of them. These Godfiends in hiding are recklessly slaughtering the demons.\u201dThe three demon monarchs agreed. If one demon commander had died, it could be blamed on humans relying on traps and killing a commander through body count.To have nine die in a short period of time, all they could think of was one possibility\u2014a Godfiend had taken action.\u201cThey don\u2019t dare to help Palace Lord Jadesun fight us. It shows that they aren\u2019t strong enough. They are likely newly advanced Godfiends who have just broken through. They are very young, weak Godfiends,\u201d said Whitesink with a voice transmission. \u201cDemon Monarch Poison Pool, take my token and set off quickly. Head to the demon commanders who are still alive! Once you discover a Godfiend, kill them immediately.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go over.\u201d The black fog-shrouded Poison Pool stretched out his iridescent green arm and took the token. \u201cIf it\u2019s a new Godfiend, I\u2019ll definitely be able to kill them easily.\u201dThose that were chosen by Mountain Lord Nine Convocation were rather powerful second Firmament demons.Swoosh.He rapidly flew southeast with his black fog.\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYun Wanhai, Fairy Meng, and Palace Lord Jadesun took the opportunity to consume pills to heal as quickly as possible. However, their expressions changed slightly when they saw a demon monarch shrouded in black fog leaving.\u201cWhy did the demon monarch leave?\u201d Fairy Meng\u2019s heart tightened. She was most worried about the hope of her family\u2014Meng Chuan. But now, she couldn\u2019t afford to think too much. The remaining three demon monarchs were charging over again.\u201cKill them.\u201d Demon Monarch Whitesink and the other two were clearly more desperate than before. They were now worried about the demon army. If the demon army was slaughtered and they lost the war, Mountain Lord Nine Convocation would severely punish them.Boom!Palace Lord Jadesun once again clashed with them. Only he could resist them!

One is dead, and Commander Ox is still alive. That newly-advanced, weak Godfiend should still be at Blazing Sun Dao Academy trying to kill Commander Ox.

Therefore, only by searching for a live demon commander would he have a chance of finding the incognito Godfiend.Phew~Poison Pool transformed into a blur as he moved. Within 100-feet, black fog surrounded him; wherever the black fog touched, corpses would turn into pools of blood. The human experts\u2014who were hidden in areas\u2014were all killed by the fog, their bodies being reduced to nothing but blood.Although Poison Pool didn\u2019t care too much about mortals, he didn\u2019t mind crushing these ants as he passed by.Laughable humans. Poison Pool glanced at the human mortals he had discovered along the way. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that I had to find that weak Godfiend as soon as possible, I alone would\u2019ve massacred all the humans in this prefecture.When one\u2019s strength reached a certain level, there was a fundamental difference. Even if a million mortals were to fight Demon Monarch Poison Pool, Demon Monarch Poison Pool wouldn\u2019t suffer any injuries, while all the humans would be killed. In reality, however, mortals would flee in all directions once the situation went south. Regardless of how powerful demon monarchs were, they couldn\u2019t do much. This was where having a colossal demon army shined.At city passes, humans served in the military to defend against the locust-like demon army. As for the demon monarchs? They were left to Godfiends.Whoosh.Poison Pool\u2019s speed was terrifying as he rushed towards Blazing Sun Dao Academy.\u2026Blazing Sun Dao Academy.\u201cRetreat.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s retreat.\u201dThe demons suffered a collapse in morale; they were at a disadvantage. This caused many of the demon lieutenant commanders to order a retreat.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! One demon after another jumped down from the windows. The lieutenant commanders fled at top speed.\u201cKill them.\u201d\u201cKill those demons!\u201d The fighting spirit of the humans inside Blazing Sun Castle surged. Short spears pierced through demon bodies. Ballistae fired bolts, which pierced through several demons like skewers. The humans inside Blazing Sun Castle held onto their advantage and beat the demons back! They chased after the demons.Demons were intelligent. They could tell that with Commander Wyrm dead, and Commander Ox nearing death, they stood no chance. Even if Commander Ox escaped and survived, the human expert would turn around and kill them. Death wasn\u2019t far.The situation was destined to be irreversible.Therefore, it was wiser to escape as quickly as possible while the human expert fought Commander Ox. No matter how powerful the human expert was, he was only one person. How many could the mysterious human expert kill if they all fled in scattered directions?They can escape, but I can\u2019t. Commander Ox had already cast forbidden spells as he stirred the Heaven and Earth powers, causing waves to form around him.Commander Ox brandished his trident and tried to block Meng Chuan\u2019s saber beams.Swoosh.Meng Chuan was extremely fast, but whenever he approached Commander Ox, the churning waves caused his speed to decrease by 30%. The speed of his attacks slowed down drastically. Commander Ox brandished his trident and completely blocked Meng Chuan\u2019s attacks.My strength is equal to this demon commander\u2019s if I don\u2019t use the Power of the Soul. Meng Chuan secretly shook his head. I can\u2019t afford any further delays. I need to head to the ancestral mansion as soon as possible.His grandaunt had asked him to protect as many clansmen as possible.Although the eight Dao Academies were the demons\u2019 primary targets\u2014the government office, the military armory, and the five Godfiend family clans being secondary targets\u2014this still involved the safety of 3,000 Meng family members. As long as there were no Godfiends and demon monarchs, he could still act as a deterrent. He was confident in protecting the family clan. Of course, if the Godfiends lost to the demon monarchs at Jadesun Palace, he would flee immediately as per his grandaunt\u2019s instructions.Jadesun Palace Lord, Grandaunt, and the others will definitely win. All Meng Chuan could do was hope. Many thoughts surfaced in his mind, but his battle with Commander Ox did not stop. After two failed attacks, Meng Chuan infused the Power of the Soul into his whole body again.His bones and muscles worked in perfect harmony, and his Quintessential Essence circulation became smoother. When all these different factors were combined, his explosive strength increased drastically. His strength increased to a whole new level.His speed. Commander Ox\u2019s eyes widened. This human expert had the same terrifying speed back when he killed Commander Wyrm.Whoosh.Even though waves obstructed the lightning-clad figure, Meng Chuan was still unbelievably fast. Commander Ox barely had time to react. The trident in his hand had barely moved before a saber beam pierced through his forehead. It penetrated the ox\u2019s head, and his mind instantly sunk into darkness.Demon Commander Ox was dead. Commander Ox\u2019s massive body fell to the ground, causing dust to rise.\u201cCommander Ox is also dead!\u201d\u201cRun!\u201d\u201cQuickly flee!\u201d The demons\u2014who had already been fleeing\u2014wished they could grow more legs as they ran in different directions.Meng Chuan\u2019s gaze swept over them. With all of them scattering, he would only kill three to five demons. Chasing after them was not worth his time.Swoosh.He rushed into Blazing Sun Castle to check on Qiyue.\u201cBeautiful.\u201d\u201cAmazing.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Meng, you are the Eldest Senior Brother of all eight Dao Academies!\u201d one of the Blazing Sun Dao Academy disciples shouted excitedly.\u201cYoung Master Meng is too powerful. He killed two demon commanders alone.\u201d The soldiers and retired veterans were similarly impressed. They all talked as they watched Meng Chuan rush towards Blazing Sun Castle. They naturally recognized Young Master Meng\u2014who was famous in Eastcalm Prefecture.Suddenly, their faces changed. All of them looked into the distance.Liu Qiyue\u2014who had been leaning weakly against the wall\u2014smiled as she watched Meng Chuan coming over. However, she revealed a look of horror when she saw something behind Meng Chuan.\u201cSenior Brother Meng, be careful!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Meng, be careful!\u201d\u201cAh Chuan, be careful!\u201d Everybody exclaimed.Meng Chuan hadn\u2019t noticed it in the beginning, but he could sense auras within half a kilometer of his position. When the enemy closed in on him, he immediately sensed a terrifying aura. The aura was strong, far stronger than his grandaunt\u2019s. It was also because his grandaunt was heavily injured and weak.\u201cSuch a terrifying aura.\u201d Meng Chuan immediately turned his head.Whoosh.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHalf of the sky behind him was covered by a black fog. When the terrifying existence was about half a kilometer away, the black fog covered a thousand feet, and it was less than a thousand feet away from him.Whoosh.The terrifying existence moved at astonishing speeds, far faster than Meng Chuan.The black fog that blotted out half the sky appeared in front of Meng Chuan in a blink of an eye. Meng Chuan\u2019s 100-feet perception also perceived countless tiny black snakes\u2014that were the size of dust particles\u2014in the black fog. The large number of corpses that lay along the route to Blazing Yang Dao Academy rapidly turned into pools of blood wherever the fog passed. At that moment, the black fog formed by countless black snakes inundated Meng Chuan.\u201cThe person who killed two commanders is actually a mortal! What a surprise.\u201d A hoarse and cold voice came from deep within the black fog.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62: How Could He Be Satisfied?It\u2019s a demon monarch. Meng Chuan\u2019s heart tightened. A demon monarch is comparable to a Godfiend.A black fog enveloped the entire area.At this moment, he only had two options. The first was to flee. After all, Demon Monarch Poison Pool was still a thousand feet away. By making use of this distance, he would be able to increase his chances of survival. The second was to be devoured by the black fog.I want to see how powerful a demon monarch is. Meng Chuan did not choose to flee. Blazing Sun Castle was ahead of him. If the black fog were to pass by Blazing Sun Castle, countless people would die. Those hiding deep in the tunnels might be able to escape such a fate, but Qiyue and the rest\u2014who hadn\u2019t hidden\u2014would be reduced to pools of blood.He didn\u2019t hesitate to fuse the Power of the Soul with his body. This was his first time fighting a demon monarch. Under the threat of death, he tried to control every ounce of strength in his body. The Power of the Soul worked with him as he excavated his potential. He instantly transformed into lightning.Swoosh.Meng Chuan charged into the black fog as a lightning bolt. He moved at unprecedented speeds. He was even faster than when he killed the three demon commanders! The pressure brought by the demon monarch was too immense.\u201cEh?\u201d Poison Pool was charging at his fastest speed but Meng Chuan wasn\u2019t fleeing. Meng Chuan took the initiative to rush at him, causing the thousand-feet gap between them to vanish instantly.What incredible speed! Poison Pool was alarmed.What a terrifying poisonous fog. After rushing into the black fog, Meng Chuan sensed his protective Quintessential Essence rapidly corroding. Fortunately, his Quintessential Essence was ten times more dense\u2014due to the Power of the Soul merging with his body\u2014raising his resistance duration significantly. My protective Quintessential Essence will only last a few seconds before it is completely corroded. I have to be fast.Meng Chuan instantly arrived in front of Poison Pool.The black fog around Poison Pool\u2019s body grew thicker, but Meng Chuan\u2019s hundred-foot sensory domain allowed Meng Chuan to 'see\u201d his opponent. Poison Pool was a humanoid snake demon with iridescent green skin. He wielded a spear, and his gray eyes stared coldly at him.\u201cKill!\u201d Meng Chuan\u2019s killing intent soared. The moment he closed in, a saber beam flashed.Lightning Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance!The saber beam slashed at the demon monarch.So what if he\u2019s a demon monarch? He\u2019s just a special life form, one that can still be killed! He believed he had the strength of a quasi-Godfiend since he was at the Core Condensation Realm and had a more robust foundation than his peers With the explosive strength granted by fusing the Power of the Soul, it wasn\u2019t impossible for him to be a threat to a demon monarch.Chi! Chi! Chi! He struck out with his saber, slicing through the black fog around Poison Pool. The protective black fog was incomparably tough, and his strikes were greatly weakened. He had merely cleaved through a single inch of black fog before stopping.A maximum-power strike only cut through an inch of black fog? The demon monarch\u2019s protective black fog is about ten feet thick.The results made Meng Chuan disheartened. The difference in strength was too great. Just too great!Poison Pool wore a faint smile as he watched this scene. He didn\u2019t even bother blocking the strike. He allowed Meng Chuan to slash at the black fog freely, happy to watch the mortal genius despair.Flee! After failing his attack, Meng Chuan instantly used a forbidden Godfiend spell. Powerful Quintessential Essence erupted from his acupuncture points, and his muscles and bones began releasing powers that exceeded his limits. Fused with the Power of the Soul, he transformed into a bolt of lightning and shot off into the distance with high speed.Poison Pool was somewhat astonished. He quickly recovered from his astonishment, and speedily chased after him.\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s a very terrifying demon monarch.\u201d Inside Blazing Sun Castle, Dean Zhong and many other experienced veteran soldiers guessed that the source of the terrifying black fog was a demon monarch.\u201cWe\u2019re finished.\u201d\u201cHurry up and flee! Split up and flee!\u201d one of the veteran soldiers shouted anxiously.The subsequent developments stunned them.Meng Chuan had transformed into lightning and charged into the black fog. It wasn\u2019t soon before Meng Chuan exited the black fog and quickly fled into the distance.The black fog quickly shrank and covered a hundred-foot distance. Within the black fog, one could vaguely see a thirty-foot tall demon monarch chasing after Meng Chuan.The two began a game of cat-and-mouse and quickly disappeared into the distance.\u201cYoung Master Meng fled in another direction to save us. He lured that demon monarch away.\u201d Dean Zhong\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look good.\u201cHe did it to save us.\u201d Many veteran soldiers and Dao Academy disciples fell silent.\u201cPerhaps to the entire Eastcalm Prefecture, to the entire human race, Young Master Meng is more important than our thousands of lives,\u201d said a one-armed elder.Everyone else was silent. Some were willing to sacrifice their lives for Meng Chuan\u2019s life! However, most people wanted to live.\u201cAh Chuan.\u201d Liu Qiyue watched from afar. She could no longer see him, but she still looked in the direction he had fled in with tears in her eyes.\u2026After Meng Chuan charged out of the black fog, he immediately stopped using the Power of the Soul. He had a tiny portion remaining.Flee. As he used his forbidden Godfiend spell, his skin turned slightly red. He fled as a streak of lightning.\u201cWhat move did you use just now? How did your strength increase so much?\u201d Poison Pool retracted his black fog and maintained it to cover a hundred-foot radius. Previously, the black fog covered a thousand-feet radius so he could capture Meng Chuan. But to his surprise, Meng Chuan\u2019s speed was truly astonishing. His speed was greater than a second Firmament demon monarch like him. \u201cYour speed gave me a fright. Unfortunately, your saber art is too weak. Furthermore, you\u2019ve slowed down.\u201dMeng Chuan also understood the difference between them. A demon monarch was strong in all aspects. He was ultimately a mortal. He lacked in many aspects. He could be considered impressive among mortals, but he was too inferior to Godfiends and demon monarchs.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to escape.\u201d Poison Pool waved his hand, and a stream of light shot out from his finger. It was incomparably sharp, and its might was far greater than Meng Chuan\u2019s Power of the Soul-infused Lightning Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance.Boom!Meng Chuan sensed the strong spherical aura shooting over and avoided it.The stream of light tore through a huge tree beside him, and a huge hole appeared on the tree trunk. The beam flew hundreds of feet further before striking a rockery\u2014which ultimately led to an explosion.Just a casual finger point is terrifying. Is this what a demon monarch is capable of? Meng Chuan gained a deeper understanding of their differences in strength. To think that he had dared to attack his opponent. The ignorant were truly fearless!He actually managed to dodge it? Poison Pool chased after him and casually pointed at Meng Chuan. Several light beams shot out.Every light beam left a pitch-black hole in the ground or pierced through many residential walls. The power of these strikes left Meng Chuan\u2019s heart trembling.Fortunately, they were nearly 1000 feet apart. Although Meng Chuan was fleeing with all his might, he could still sense the light beams coming at him without looking back. This meant he could preemptively dodge.\u201cHumph.\u201d Poison Pool\u2019s five fingers simultaneously shot light beams. He no longer cared about conserving his demonic energy. However, Meng Chuan was extremely slippery. It was as though he had eyes on the back of his head that allowed him to dodge ahead of time.He\u2019s a mortal and easily killed a demon commander. He was even faster than me, a second Firmament demon monarch. Although he is very weak in other aspects, he is ultimately a mortal\u2026. To be this powerful, he must be a peerless genius. Such a peerless genius has a high bounty. Poison Pool grew very interested in Meng Chuan.Although Godfiends were powerful, the threat that newly-advanced Godfiends posed to demon monarchs was negligible.On the contrary, peerless mortal geniuses had terrifying potential. After becoming Godfiends, they also had chances of becoming a terrifying Godfiend expert. Thus, if one could be considered a peerless genius, the demons would place a massive bounty on their heads.In the eyes of Poison Pool, the young man before him was worth a huge bounty.I\u2019m not fast enough. Oh, forget it. For the sake of a genius, using a forbidden spell occasionally is fine. A forbidden spell\u2019s influence was limited if used for a short period. With a thought, Poison Pool\u2019s demonic powers raged.Meng Chuan sensed the demon monarch\u2019s aura go berserk suddenly. Poison Pool\u2019s speed increased, and he rapidly shortened the distance between them.Not good. Meng Chuan became even more anxious. The distance between them was rapidly decreasing. 800 feet, 600 feet, 400 feet\u2026 The distance between them shortened extremely quickly.Swish. Although Meng Chuan was very fast when he used a forbidden Godfiend spell\u2014allowing him to pass by many residences, ruins, and rivers\u2014the demon monarch behind him was clearly faster than him after using a forbidden spell.Power of the Soul!He used the remnants of his Power of the Soul, boosting his speed.Meng Chuan\u2019s speed increased as he tried to widen the gap between them., but he quickly exhausted his Power of the Soul. The distance between them was 600 feet. The gap continued to shrink.What do I do? What do I do? Meng Chuan frantically fled. He didn\u2019t want to die. He was the Meng family\u2019s hope, and he had not completed the oath he had made at his mother\u2019s grave. He wanted to become a Godfiend! He hadn\u2019t even killed a demon monarch! After so many years of cultivation, he had many ambitions. How could he be satisfied just dying like that?Flee! The desperate thought flashed through his mind, causing his body to fuse with his Quintessential Essence even further. After this, his speed increased by 20%.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLegends mentioned that the physical body possessed tremendous potential. The strength one usually unleashed in battle was just the tip of the iceberg of the physical body\u2019s potential. If an incomparably powerful Godfiend were to control a body, the power they could unleash would be several-fold greater than a mortal.However, Meng Chuan reached his limit after raising his speed by 20%.300 feet, 200 feet\u2026As the gap closed, Meng Chuan could sense the aura behind him getting closer and closer.Am I going to die here? To the hands of a demon monarch? Meng Chuan was filled with grief and indignation, but there was nothing he could do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He did his best to advance, moving towards a narrow and remote area. Demon Monarch Poison Pool had a massive 30-foot tall body, so Meng Chuan hoped that these narrow spaces would be able to affect him a little.Whoosh.However, Poison Pool was like a gust of wind. He stepped on the roof tiles and tree branches and rapidly pursued him. He was getting closer and closer until the gap between them was only 100 feet.Meng Chuan could 'see\u201d the other party\u2019s iridescent green skin and his excited gray eyes.How do I escape? Where do I go? Meng Chuan despaired.Boom!Suddenly\u2014within a half a kilometer of Meng Chuan\u2014a terrifying aura pierced through the sky from the north. It was so fast that even Meng Chuan could only vaguely make it out. It was a short lance with a blood-colored aura. The spear tore through the air, causing the air to explode around it. In a blink of an eye, it traversed half a kilometer and headed straight for Demon Monarch Poison Pool.\u201cOh?\u201d Poison Pool was alarmed. The terrifying short lance made him feel threatened. Not confident of his protective black fog being able to block it, he waved his long spear.Clang!He blocked the short lance.\u201cYou are tempting fate, Demon Monarch!\u201d An angry bellow rang out through the heavens like a thunder god roaring! A figure\u2014whose entire body was surrounded by a sanguine aura\u2014rushed over as a second short lance was thrown.Boom! Boom!One short lance after another shot out as the figure\u2019s killing intent raged. Poison Pool blocked the attacks, giving Meng Chuan an opportunity to escape.That is? Meng Chuan dazedly stared at the figure charging towards the demon monarch. The figure\u2019s aura was very powerful, but fundamentally, it was identical to his father\u2019s aura. However, it was dozens-fold more violent; the killing intent reached a terrifying level.The same aura signature as his father\u2026 Meng Chuan vaguely saw the person within the sanguine aura. It was his father\u2014who was 15 kilograms lighter. He was no longer fat, but rather muscular.Ever since he was six years old, his father had slowly gained weight. He recognized his father at a glance.Is that Father? Meng Chuan was a little confused.Was he the same chubby father who laughed jovially every day? Was he the same father who had taught him saber arts since he was young, but had lost to him in every duel ever since he reached the Seamless realm?He had always believed that his father was only a Seamless realm expert\u2014who had comprehended Force\u2014that hadn\u2019t succeeded in condensing a core.No\u2026His grandaunt had used the entire family\u2019s savings to exchange for a drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid. As for his father, he had produced two treasures\u2014the Iceheart Fruit and Astral Spirit Herb. Back then, he had realized that his father had a great secret, but he had never imagined that his father would be a Godfiend.\u201cHaha, there really was a Godfiend in hiding.\u201d Poison Pool laughed hoarsely. \u201cYou are actually a Body Tempering Godfiend. The Body Tempering Godfiend lineage of you humans is extremely crude and incomplete. The Great Solar realm is the pinnacle, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more than enough to kill you.\u201d Meng Dajiang\u2019s killing intent surged as he drew his saber and instantly slashed at Poison Pool.\u201cDo you think you\u2014a newly advanced Godfiend\u2014has what it takes?\u201d Poison Pool snickered. Two black serpents formed from the black fog instantly swirled towards Meng Dajiang.Whenever the black fog serpents wrapped around Meng Dajiang, they were weakened by 90% due to the sanguine aura. The other effects it had on Meng Dajiang\u2019s body were miniscule. Body Tempering Godfiends didn\u2019t cultivate their Quintessential Essence and focused on their bodies. It was easy for them to resist the tiny portion of poisonous gas.A Body Tempering Godfiend is quite special. Venomous Pool frowned slightly as he charged forward with his spear. With a wave of his spear, he caused some of the nearby buildings to collapse. The terrifying spear stabbed straight at Meng Dajiang.\u201cDemon monarch, die.\u201d Meng Dajiang\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. He had long used a forbidden Godfiend spell, and he was in a state of madness. His saber beam flew towards Poison Pool.Almost\u2026 He had almost lost his son to this demon monarch!When the demons invaded, he and Liu Yebai had gone to the city\u2019s northern region to check out available missions. When they suddenly heard the Jadesun Palace\u2019s alarm, they were shocked and immediately split up.Liu Yebai proceeded in one direction\u2014the Blazing Sun Dao Academy, and he would pass by other Dao Academies and family clans.Meng Dajiang went another direction. He passed by the Meng family ancestral mansion and Mirror Lake Meng Manor.Wherever the two went, they would kill the demon commanders they met! However, both of them were newly-advanced Godfiends. Without using forbidden spells, their speed was only on par with Meng Chuan\u2019s. As for Meng Chuan, he had rushed to Blazing Sun Dao Academy immediately, so he was faster than Liu Yebai.Later on, Meng Chuan was pursued by Poison Pool. This pursuit brought them several kilometers away in a blink of an eye. The commotion they had produced was quite loud, and it caught Meng Dajiang\u2019s attention.He cast a forbidden spell and threw his short lance from far away to save his son.Finally, he saved his son!However, the fact that his son was almost killed filled Meng Dajiang with rage. He madly swung his saber down with all his might, forming a wave of saber beams.\u201cYou dare fight me? You truly have a death wish.\u201d Poison Pool had the confidence to face a newly-promoted Godfiend and struck out with his spear.A newly-advanced Body Tempering Godfiend and a second Firmament demon monarch clashed head-on.Boom!It was as if the world was collapsing.Meng Chuan stopped his forbidden Godfiend spell and stood far away. Although his body ached and his meridians were in pain, he still watched the fight nervously. His father and the demon monarch were engaged in battle. Every time the two clashed, the collision\u2019s aftershock was terrifying. Any of his father\u2019s strikes were far more powerful than his Lightning Ultimate Saber Drawing Stance. In the blink of an eye, his father had formed 100 saber beams as he furiously swung his saber.His father also cultivated the swift saber. Meng Chuan\u2019s talent in the swift saber might have been inherited from his father. It was just that people said that the fastest saber user in Eastcalm Prefecture was the dean of Mirror Lake Dao Academy, Ge Yu. But now, even Meng Chuan had surpassed him.However, after seeing his father\u2019s swift saber today, he realized how scary his father was. This was a true Godfiend. Godfiends were powerful in all aspects. His speed and strength were incredibly high, and his endurance in battle was terrifying. And his father was only a newly-advanced Godfiend.\u2026A blurry figure came to Blazing Sun Dao Academy. It was Liu Yebai.Qiyue. The color in Liu Yebai\u2019s face drained when he saw the blood and corpses strewn all over the Dao Academy. Am I too late?He rushed towards Blazing Sun Castle.Swoosh.He quickly entered Blazing Sun Castle through a window.\u201cYou are?\u201d A soldier\u2014who was resting by the window\u2014was bandaging his companion\u2019s wound. He was shocked to see a man in black appear.\u201cQiyue.\u201d Liu Yebai immediately saw the pale Liu Qiyue leaning against a wall. He rushed over excitedly. Many people in the castle were resting or recuperating. All of them saw Liu Yebai rushing over.\u201cDad?\u201d Liu Qiyue shouted in surprise.\u201cBrother Liu.\u201d Dean Zhong nodded. Many of them knew Liu Yebai. After all, he was an expert who had comprehended Force. He had high standing amongst Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s mortals.Liu Yebai held his daughter\u2019s hand and carefully inspected her. He frowned and said, \u201cYou used a forbidden Godfiend spell? You have to rest for the next month. Don\u2019t use your Quintessential Energy or practice archery at all.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Liu Qiyue nodded.\u201cBrother Liu,\u201d said Dean Zhong immediately. \u201cJust now, your daughter\u2014Liu Qiyue\u2014awakened the Phoenix Divine Body bloodline during the demons\u2019 invasion.\u201d\u201cPhoenix Divine Body bloodline?\u201d Liu Yebai was taken aback. He was both surprised and conflicted.\u201cDad, Dad,\u201d Liu Qiyue said anxiously. \u201cAh Chuan saved Blazing Sun Dao Academy just now. However, a demon monarch that emitted black fog came for us. Ah Chuan lured the demon monarch away. We have to think of a way to save Ah Chuan.\u201d\u201cA demon monarch is chasing after Meng Chuan?\u201d Liu Yebai\u2019s expression changed. \u201cWhich direction did they go?\u201d\u201cIn that direction.\u201d Liu Qiyue pointed outside.\u201cRemember, release the distress flare immediately if you encounter danger,\u201d said Liu Yebai seriously before rushing out the window.\u201cDad, that\u2019s a demon monarch. Don\u2019t be rash.\u201d Liu Qiyue panicked as well.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Father doesn\u2019t plan on dying.\u201d Liu Yebai\u2019s voice rang in his daughter\u2019s ears. He was already rapidly flying away.\u2026Boom!Meng Dajiang flew backward and crashed into a destroyed restaurant. Blood trickled down the corner of his lips.\u201cAs expected of a Body Tempering Godfiend. Your body is strong. You can even withstand my blows after all this time.\u201d Poison Pool laughed coldly, but in his heart, he felt rather bitter.He wanted to kill this new Godfiend in one go, which was why he had been maintaining his forbidden spell. He had used it for fifteen seconds, which was considered quite long. If he continued, the damage would worsen.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, this newly-advanced, Godfiend was a Body Tempering Godfiend. They were known for their exceptionally strong vitality. Killing a Body Tempering Godfiend was even more difficult than killing three ordinary Godfiends. However, the path of one was destined to be bleak. The Body Tempering system stopped out at the Great Solar realm.\u201cOh?\u201d Poison Pool\u2019s expression suddenly changed as he looked into the distance.A terrifying aura came bursting over. It was the phantom-like Liu Yebai.\u201cYou\u2019re finally here.\u201d Meng Dajiang laughed loudly. \u201cQuick, join forces with me to kill this demon monarch.\u201d\u201cHahaha, to think you need my help.\u201d Liu Yebai laughed loudly as he instantly unsheathed his sword and leaped at Poison Pool. \u201cLet\u2019s kill this demon monarch together!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was a second Firmament demon monarch after all! Yet, these two newly-advanced Godfiends wanted to join forces to kill him? What a joke.The furious Poison Pool\u2019s black poisonous fog expanded rapidly, quickly covering a thousand-foot area.Poison? A different black fog also began to surround Liu Yebai\u2019s body. It quickly spread out, forcing the Poison Pool\u2019s poisonous fog to recede.A domain? Poison Pool was alarmed. Some Godfiends specialized in domains, and Fairy Meng from the Meng family happened to be one of the best. His poisonous fog was completely suppressed. He had encountered another expert who was adept at domains.Liu Yebai\u2019s domain seemed to sink Poison Pool into a swamp.\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dMeng Dajiang charged head-on while Liu Yebai attacked from the flanks with his sword.I can kill both of you in a head-on battle. Poison Pool brandished his spear and attacked with immense strength. However, Meng Dajiang used his saber art to take the hits head-on. Liu Yebai\u2019s unpredictable movement allowed him to carry out sneak attacks. Within the black fog domain, seven Liu Yebais appeared. Each Liu Yebai attacked silently before retreating into the black fog and disappearing.\u201cScram!\u201dPoison Pool swung his spear in a sweeping motion and struck one of the Liu Yebais. The Liu Yebai collapsed into the black fog and dissipated. Clearly, it wasn\u2019t his real body.Boom! Meng Dajiang swung his saber, and Poison Pool hurriedly blocked it.Swish! Another Liu Yebai shot out from the black fog and stabbed Poison Pool\u2019s back with lightning speed.However, the ten-foot-thick, black fog around Poison Pool was extremely tough. Liu Yebai barely managed to penetrate the black fog\u2014leaving only a small wound on Poison Pool\u2014before his attack lost all momentum. Liu Yebai\u2019s pupils constricted as he immediately retreated.\u2026In one of the residential ruins in Eastcalm City, two Godfiends engaged in a battle against Demon Monarch Poison Pool. Their strength left Meng Chuan gasping in amazement, and he quickly realized the difference in strength between himself and the two Godfiends.Mortal to Godfiend\u2026It was a leap in strength, and the gap was astonishing.According to what the demon monarch said, Father is a Body Tempering Godfiend? He is able to face the demon monarch head-on, while Uncle Liu is more slippery and crafty. He keeps ambushing him, never attacking head-on. They have great teamwork, probably a result after countless battles together. Meng Chuan watched the duo\u2019s seamless cooperation. One charged and attacked head-on, while the other dealt sinister ambushes.Poison Pool was blocked by Meng Dajian every time he tried to go after Liu Yebai. Poison Pool quickly suffered dozens of blows as the battle progressed. The two Godfiends were extremely powerful, causing him to be injured badly.Twelve out of eighteen commanders have died. Ever since the two Godfiends started fighting me, no other commanders have been killed. It seems that the incognito Godfiends were these two. It\u2019s obvious they reached the Core Cloud realm recently, making them comparable to first Firmament demon monarchs. However, they have rich combat experience and excellent teamwork. I can\u2019t gain the upper hand if they are working together. Although the Body Tempering Godfiend is quite injured, my injuries aren\u2019t much better either. I\u2019ve been maintaining the forbidden spell for quite some time. If I give up now, I\u2019ll have to recuperate for months when I\u2019m back at the fief. If I continue using the forbidden spell, I might damage my foundation.Poison Pool didn\u2019t want to risk his life. He had been maintaining his forbidden spell for far too long! He had been using a forbidden spell since he had started chasing Meng Chuan\u2026He couldn\u2019t kill or wear down the Body Tempering Godfiend expert, and there was still the sinister Godfiend\u2014who could continuously ambush him thanks to his skill in domains. Poison Pool felt extremely miserable.I think the only plan is to kill the three powerful Godfiends at Jadesun Palace first. After that, I\u2019ll lead the demons with Whitesink, Ape, and Domineering Roar, and annihilate Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s humans. Poison Pool did not hesitate as he turned around and fled.Swoosh.With the use of a forbidden spell, Poison Pool was extremely fast\u2014even faster than when Meng Chuan went all out. He was faster than both Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai.He didn\u2019t flee in Meng Chuan\u2019s direction, so Liu Yebai and Meng Dajiang didn\u2019t stop him or pursue him.\u201cThat second Firmament demon monarch is truly powerful.\u201d Only then did Liu Yebai stop his forbidden Godfiend spell. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh in amazement. \u201cThe two of us were going all out, but we barely came to a draw. He probably doesn\u2019t know that you\u2019ll be out of the fight once all that meat on you is expended.\u201dMeng Dajiang had already lost more than five kilograms since he had appeared to rescue Meng Chuan. He said, \u201cHumph, this demon monarch had cast a forbidden spell for too long. If we had continued fighting, I would\u2019ve only lost mass, while he would\u2019ve damaged his foundation.\u201dWhoosh.From afar, Meng Chuan rushed over.Liu Yebai\u2019s body was shrouded in black fog, and his face was obscured from view. \u201cYou have to keep our identities a secret.\u201d After sending a voice transmission, he immediately phased away and left the father-and-son duo alone.\u201cMmm?\u201d Meng Chuan saw Liu Yebai quickly leaving after he arrived and was stunned.Whoosh. Meng Dajiang came to his son\u2019s side. Meng Dajiang\u2019s body was covered in the sanguine aura; his face was faintly discernible underneath the aura.\u201cDad.\u201d\u201cI knew it,\u201d said Meng Dajiang as he nodded. \u201cYou can sense aura within half a kilometer. Uncle Liu and I cannot escape your detection.\u201dThe power that Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai had used was different from usual. Normally, they would only use physical strength and Quintessential Energy.But just now, Meng Dajiang had used a special sanguine aura. Liu Yebai had used a domain technique. Even people who knew him wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize the sanguine aura and domain technique due to their concealment.However, Meng Chuan\u2019s 'sense\u201d could detect not only Quintessential Essence and demonic energy, but also aura signatures. No matter how much one tried to disguise themselves, their aura signature would never change.\u201cUncle Liu and I hide our strength due to special reasons,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cYou have to keep it a secret for us.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.They were Godfiends, but they had hidden their true identities and lived in Eastcalm Prefecture. They definitely had their secrets. Since his father and Uncle Liu weren\u2019t willing to explain, probing further would be meaningless.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Follow me to Mirror Lake Dao Academy,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cFrom now on, you have to stay by my side constantly.\u201d\u201cYes, Dad,\u201d replied Meng Chuan.\u201cDon\u2019t call me dad in public, or you\u2019ll expose my identity,\u201d said Meng Dajiang with a smile.Meng Chuan nodded immediately. \u201cI understand.\u201dWith his father\u2014a Godfiend\u2014around, he felt more at ease.Whoosh! Whoosh!Enveloped by the sanguine aura, Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan rushed towards the Dao Academy\u2014their speeds equal.\u201cUncle Liu and I have our own matters. When we discovered the demons invading, we separated. He headed for Blazing Sun Dao Academy, and I headed to the ancestral mansion and Mirror Lake Meng Manor. We would kill demon commanders along the way,\u201d said Meng Dajiang via voice transmission. \u201cThankfully, you created a huge commotion while escaping the demon monarch. I finally found you and managed to save you from that perilous situation.\u201d\u201cIf you had been any slower, I might have really died.\u201d Meng Chuan was also feeling a little scared.\u201cWho would have thought that the demons would invade?\u201d Meng Dajiang shook his head.\u201cDad, how\u2019s the ancestral mansion?\u201d asked Meng Chuan.Meng Dajiang said, \u201cOur Meng family is one of the five Godfiend family clans. Our luck wasn\u2019t that good. A demon army attacked the ancestral mansion. By the time I arrived, there were already casualties\u2026 Four Elders died. By the way, Third Elder is also dead.\u201d\u201cThird Elder?\u201d Meng Chuan was taken aback.The bald, thin Third Elder had left a deep impression on him. He was fierce to the juniors and was cold and old-fashioned. If anyone dared to disobey him, he would lash out with his walking stick. It left quite the trauma on Meng Chuan when he was young.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, after he figured out the secret technique, Third Elder had given him a remnant page of a Godfiend legacy. He insisted that he kept it.\u201cThird Elder is very strong,\u201d Meng Chuan murmured.\u201cThat\u2019s right. He\u2019s one of the strongest in the entire family clan. If he were careful, he would\u2019ve survived. However, he was being himself. He led the charge and defended the young ones. In the end, a demon\u2019s tentacle pierced through his chest and killed him,\u201d said Meng Dajiang via voice transmission. He was in a bad mood. After all, they were his elders.Meng Dajiang glanced at his son and said with a voice transmission, \u201cDon\u2019t think about it too much. Third Elder did so willingly. I know his temper, and he will definitely be very pleased that he managed to protect so many young people. If you can enter Archean Mountain and become a Godfiend, Third Elder will probably laugh out loud in his grave.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded slightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65: Yan Jin\u201cDad, are you hiding the fact you are a Godfiend from Grandaunt?\u201d asked Meng Chuan.His grandaunt yearned for a Godfiend to appear in the clan.\u201cChuan\u2019er, I became a Godfiend for special reasons.\u201d Meng Dajiang ultimately revealed some secrets to his son. \u201cFirst of all, this matter has to be kept a secret. I can\u2019t openly help the clan. Secondly, I\u2019m too weak as a Godfiend. In fact, all Body Tempering Godfiends are very weak.\u201d\u201cVery weak?\u201d Meng Chuan was puzzled.\u201cEight hundred years ago, when the demons first invaded,\u201d Meng Dajiang said via voice transmission, \u201cthe human Godfiends, and demon monarchs fought numerous major battles. The Godfiends discovered that amongst the demons, some of them were extremely talented and had terrifyingly mighty bodies. Thus, the top-tier Godfiends began to ponder on how to strengthen their bodies. Thus, they established the body-tempering lineage.\u201d\u201cAs it was unprecedented and due to their lack of experience, the third firmament\u2019s Great Solar realm is the theoretical limit for the Body Tempering Godfiend lineage,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cTo reach this limit, you need a large number of natural treasures to nourish the body. It\u2019s too extravagant and wasteful.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too wasteful, and it doesn\u2019t have a promising future. Due to the incomplete cultivation formulas, it also makes cultivation a lot more difficult,\u201d said Meng Dajiang through voice transmission. \u201cThis is a failed path. Perhaps this path might be perfected thousands of years from now, but currently, it\u2019s far from complete.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded slightly. It\u2019s no wonder he had never heard of it before.\u201cThose that can enter Archean Mountain are all geniuses. Their first goal is to reach the Great Solar realm,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cTheir first goal is already the Body Tempering Godfiend lineage\u2019s theoretical limit, so you can tell how weak we are. For example, King Calm Sea is a famous Godfiend. He could probably kill a Great Solar Godfiend with a single glance. Becoming an expert like King Calm Sea is the goal of every Godfiend from Archean Mountain. It\u2019s also something you should pursue.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.King Calm Sea\u2026 He had been guarding Calm Sea Pass all this time! Previously, his grandaunt was also under his command. Even his grandaunt had said that King Calm Sea\u2019s strength was in no way inferior to the famous Godfiend of old, Deng Feng. Now, his father was claiming that he could kill a Great Solar realm Godfiend with just a glance?\u201cDad, can the Godfiends at Jadesun Palace obtain victory?\u201d Meng Chuan asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Meng Dajiang shook his head. \u201cIf Jadesun Palace wins, then it spells victory for Eastcalm Prefecture. If they lose, Eastcalm Prefecture will be reduced to a scorched land. Your Uncle Liu and I\u2026 can\u2019t stop the scourge at all.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hope they win.\u201d Meng Chuan wouldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d be defeated.Meng Dajiang looked at his son. There was something he hadn\u2019t said. Since the demons had sent Demon Monarch Poison Pool to sweep the area, it meant that the demons definitely had the upper hand.\u2026That was indeed the case.Jadesun Palace.The black-furred ape raised his pole and transformed into a black beam, attacking Fairy Meng.Behind Fairy Meng was the extremely weak Yun Wanhai\u2014whose bones were broken and fractured. He no longer had any combat strength left.\u201cScram!\u201d Fairy Meng shouted. Immediately, illusory palms struck at the black-furred ape, but they were all shattered by its pole.Clang!Fairy Meng\u2019s walking stick collided with the pole. The force of the strike that split apart her many illusory palms had greatly reduced. When it faced Fairy Meng\u2019s walking stick again, the black-furred ape was sent tumbling backward.Cough. Fairy Meng\u2019s face flushed as blood trickled down the corner of her mouth.Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! The raging Jadesun Palace Lord punched out dozens of times in a frenzy. Every punch was dazzling to the eye. Finally, he managed to push the towering Demon Monarch Domineering Roar and thorny Demon Monarch Whitesink back. He immediately retreated to Fairy Meng.\u201cFairy, how is it?\u201d Jadesun Palace Lord was somewhat worried. \u201cThat ape is too fast. I wasn\u2019t able to stop him.\u201dAmong the demon monarchs, Domineering Roar had the greatest strength while Ape had the highest agility and speed; Ape was as fast as Meng Chuan. A true battle depended on a multitude of factors. Third Firmament Demon Monarch Whitesink was clearly the strongest. He was the only one who could hold back Jadesun Palace Lord head-on.\u201cI can still withstand about three more strikes,\u201d said Fairy Meng via voice transmission. \u201cHowever, after those three strikes. I\u2019ll be done.\u201d\u201cIf you collapse, I won\u2019t be able to stop them either,\u201d Jadesun Palace Lord said bitterly.With Fairy Meng\u2019s domain helping him, he was like a tiger with wings, and his strength was boosted slightly. The domain also suppressed their opponents, weakening them slightly. This was the only reason why he had been able to endure his opponents\u2019 attacks.If not for Fairy Meng, he could only run for his life. Escape might not even be possible!\u201cDemon Monarch Ape, follow this method! We will win once Fairy Meng is killed,\u201d ordered Whitesink through voice transmission. \u201cGo.\u201d\u201cHaha, kill.\u201d Domineering Roar was extremely valiant.The three demon monarchs joined forces to attack again.Jadesun Palace Lord had no choice but to defend. In truth, although Demon Monarch Poison was gone, he was the weakest out of the four demon monarchs. The poisonous fog was completely suppressed by the domain. As for close combat? Poison Pool\u2019s close combat ability was considered average. Compared to the fast Demon Monarch Ape and the extremely powerful Demon Monarch Domineering Roar, he was too inferior.Both sides clashed again. Whitesink and Domineering Roar held back Jadesun Palace Lord while Ape moved to attack Fairy Meng once again.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about leaving.\u201d Jadesun Palace Lord punched out and light\u2014in the shape of a fist\u2014flew towards Ape.He had to think of a way to hold back three people. He couldn\u2019t let any of them attack Fairy Meng. But it was clearly too difficult.It was especially difficult to pin the agile black-furred ape down.Ape flashed a few times in the form of a black beam, escaping Jadesun\u2019s interference in mere seconds and arrived in front of Fairy Meng. Fairy Meng had no choice but to resist. Her injuries worsened every time she engaged in close combat.\u201cFairy, I never expected that the two of us would die together,\u201d said Yun Wanhai with a weak chuckle.\u201cShut your foul mouth. We aren\u2019t dead yet!\u201d Fairy Meng was also trying her best to hold on.However, Fairy Meng also knew that they were in a perilous situation.\u2026Poison Pool rushed towards Jadesun Palace.Along the way, he encountered battles between humans and demons. These battles occurred throughout the city.There was a battle ahead of Poison Pool. The three humans had great teamwork. Two of them were defending against the demons while the third\u2014an archer\u2014kept shooting arrows. Although he wasn\u2019t at the level of a sharpshooter, he was strong and accurate enough. His arrows had powerful might. As his companions engaged in close combat with the demons, he shot out an arrow that penetrated a demon\u2019s head.\u201cWell done.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s kill the next one.\u201d The three experts at the Mortal Shedding realm were veterans and had excellent teamwork. They had killed more than ten demons consecutively.Whoosh~A black fog quickly flew over from afar. When he passed through the area, he sent out his black fog, which swept past the three veterans. The three veterans stared at the fog with wide eyes, filled with indignation. They immediately became pools of blood due to the black fog.Poison Pool thought nothing of it. He was just killing a few humans while returning to Jadesun Palace.Moments later, when Poison Pool flew past a river, he saw a battle in the distance.A white-robed youth held two swords as he engaged in battle with a group of demons. There were many demon corpses around him.Whoosh. Frost permeated the surroundings, causing the demons to slow down.As he brandished his two swords, he constantly killed demons. No matter how the demons defended against the attacks, they were killed.Pfft.Even a tiger demon lieutenant commander was slain as well.What a powerful human. Although he can\u2019t match up to that young man with a saber, he has the strength of a demon commander. Poison Pool was secretly alarmed. Unfortunately, with his strength, he isn\u2019t worth any bounty.There were plenty of geniuses among the humans who could match a demon commander. Although he was impressive, he wouldn\u2019t garner too much attention from the demons.In ancient Godfiend family clans of places like the Zhou Dynasty Capital, if one were talented enough, they would be nurtured extensively. Their Godfiend foundations would be very robust and deep. In the mortal realm, they could match demon commanders. However, such geniuses wouldn\u2019t join the military when they were mortals. Instead, they would enter Archean Mountain and become powerful Godfiends before fighting the demons.To have these geniuses serve the military and fight on the meat grinder-like battlefield would be irresponsible of the human race.Killing a genius isn\u2019t too bad either. Poison Pool flew towards the white-robed youth.\u201cMmm?\u201d The white-robed young man was none other than Yan Jin.Jadesun Palace had sent away everyone before the battle between the Godfiends and demon monarchs started. After all, mortals would be affected if they remained.Yan Jin had also left. He had killed many demons along the way.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDemon monarch? Yan Jin shuddered when he saw the blurry figure in the black fog rapidly approaching him.After the battle at Idle Stone Garden, although his family clan had sent more powerful guards over, they were only Core Condensation realm experts.Ever since Yan Jin reached the Seamless realm, his strength was no less than his guards\u2019, so the guard had left silently. After all, an expert at the Core Condensation realm had many things to do.Why would I encounter a demon monarch? Shouldn\u2019t the demon monarchs be battling against the Godfiends at Jadesun Palace? Yan Jin\u2019s expression changed drastically. He did not hesitate to turn and flee. He did not have the confidence to resist at all.\u201cLittle guy, do you think you can escape?\u201d Poison Pool was very fast as he chased Yan Jin. The black fog quickly covered the area.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jue Yan had many thoughts in an instant.His dead mother\u2026His cold father\u2026The grievances and indignation in his heart that had tormented him all these years.Whoosh. The thick black fog spread out, drowning Yan Jin.So be it! Yan Jin closed his eyes, calmly accepting death.\u2026Human genius? Hahaha, I can easily crush you to death. Poison Pool happily flew forward, just like how he had after killing those human experts along the way. He believed that human genius would also be wiped out in the same way.But suddenly\u2014Boom!A mysterious power appeared where the black fog had enveloped Yan Jin. It spread out in every direction as the black fog rapidly disintegrated, causing the surrounding area to regain its natural clarity.That\u2019s\u2026 Poison Pool looked at Yan Jin in horror.He saw an illusory gray sword appear above Yan Jin\u2019s head\u2014who had his eyes closed. The gray sword hovered there, an invisible ripple sweeping through the entire area. When it struck Poison Pool, he couldn\u2019t help but kneel. He felt his head spin, and he immediately fell to his knees with a thud. He propped himself up with his arms and looked up with great difficulty. His eyes were filled with terror. A sword mark? This mortal has a sword mark sealed in his body?There were only a handful of Godfiends who could accomplish this. Only terrifying existences who were adept with swords could do so.A blurry figure appeared beside the illusory gray sword. It was a cold-looking, brawny man. His gaze swept across the surroundings coldly.\u201cEastcalm Prefecture?\u201d The cold-looking man turned to look at Yan Jin before looking at the kneeling Poisonous Pool.\u201cHumph.\u201d He snorted coldly.The air fluctuations suddenly increased.Boom!\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d Before Poison Pool could finish his sentence, terrifying waves overwhelmed him. Poison Pool\u2019s entire body was reduced to dust before it disappeared with the wind.\u201cThe demons are invading Eastcalm Prefecture?\u201d The cold-looking man gazed at Jadesun Palace. He shouted softly, \u201cGo!\u201dThe gray sword instantly streaked across the sky, crossing four kilometers before arriving at Jadesun Palace.\u2026The destroyed Jadesun Palace.Yun Wanhai was heavily injured. Fairy Meng\u2019s face was as pale as paper. Her fingers tightened around her walking stick as she tried her best to use her domain to help Jadesun Palace Lord. However, her domain was beginning to tremble unstably.Block them, block them. Jadesun Palace Lord desperately held back the three demon monarchs.He wanted to stall for more time.He was unwilling to admit defeat.\u201cFairy Meng is beginning to lose control over her domain. She can\u2019t take it anymore. Kill her, then kill Jadesun Palace Lord, then we will finally flatten Eastcalm Prefecture,\u201d said Whitesink in delight.\u201cHaha, Fairy Meng is finally unable to hold on.\u201d The black-furred ape loudly laughed as he transformed into a black beam of light. He tried his best to avoid Jadesun Palace Lord, hoping to deal Fairy Meng a fatal blow.Right at this moment\u2014Whitesink, Domineering Roar, and Ape looked up at the same time.An illusory gray sword shadow flew over from the horizon, arriving at Jadesun Palace in the blink of an eye.\u201cNo!!!\u201d Whitesink revealed a look of horror and despair as he frantically fled into the distance.He had only taken a few steps when the gray sword shadow stabbed downwards. Whitesink angrily roared as he used both his claws to block with all his might. At the instant the sword struck his claws, the Heaven and Earth powers condensed into sword beams. Instantly, thousands of sword beams cleaved down frenziedly. Whitesink raised his head and looked at the thousands of sword beams that blinded him. His eyes were filled with despair as he roared angrily, \u201cIt\u2019s King Calm Sea\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation Sword! Why is King Calm Sea here?\u201dFollowing that, countless sword flashes struck him, tearing apart his extremely tough body.Third Firmament Demon Monarch Whitesink was dead!\u201cIt\u2019s King Calm Sea\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation Sword!\u201d Domineering Roar was also stunned.\u201cIsn\u2019t King Calm Sea constantly presiding over Calm Sea Pass?\u201d Ape found it unbelievable. However, the remote strike had frightened them completely. Ape and Domineering Roar immediately fled in a panic.King Calm Sea\u2019s Heavenly Tribulation Sword? Lord Jadesun revealed an expression of disbelief.His Highness is here? Fairy Meng\u2014who was an old subordinate of King Calm Sea\u2014was somewhat excited.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about escaping!\u201d Although Jadesun Palace Lord was pleasantly surprised, he still rapidly pursued Domineering Roar and Ape.\u2026Yan Jin had thought he would die, but he faintly sensed a special power instead of his impending death.Dazedly, he opened his eyes, only to see Poison Pool reduced to powder by the terrifying energy fluctuations. He then saw the cold-looking man making the gray sword projection pierce through the sky and head straight for Jadesun Palace.\u201cWhen you were born, I sealed a sword mark on you,\u201d said the phantom calmly. \u201cAll of your siblings have one too. That is the only sword mark. I will not give you a second chance. In the future, you will have to take responsibility for your future path. If you die in battle, you have nothing to blame but your own incompetence.\u201dWith that said, the phantom dissipated.Yan Jin stared blankly. Lowering his head slightly, he whispered, \u201cYou know, this is the first time I\u2019ve heard your voice in ten years. I almost forgot that I had a father.\u201d\u201cDo you think I would be grateful to you? Hahaha\u2026\u201dYan Jin\u2014who usually spoke little\u2014laughed maniacally.\u2026Domineering Roar had immense strength, but he was too massive. He was unable to shake off Jadesun Palace Lord.In a one-against-two battle, Jadesun Palace Lord took just eight strikes to blast through Domineering Roar\u2019s protective barrier, forming a huge hole in his chest and shattering his heart. Following that, he kicked Domineering Roar\u2019s head, causing his massive body to collapse. He did not get up again.That Demon Monarch Ape sure is fast. Jadesun Palace Lord chased after Demon Monarch Ape. However, the black-furred ape had transformed into a black beam of lift and had even used a forbidden spell to escape. He fled so quickly that Jadesun Palace Lord couldn\u2019t catch up to him.Ape was extremely fast. He had fled in such a panic, not because he was afraid of Jadesun Palace Lord; he was confident that he could shake off Jadesun Palace Lord. No, he was afraid of King Calm Sea.What kind of existence was King Calm Sea?As long as he was inside Eastcalm Prefecture, he could kill a second Firmament demon monarch remotely.King Calm Sea is stationed at Calm Sea Pass. Why would he be in Eastcalm Prefecture?

It\u2019s best if we use bows or throw short lances. Engage in melee combat as little as possible.\u201dWith orders from all over the place, the soldiers and veterans of Eastcalm Prefecture skillfully drove out the demons. Demons that were slow to escape would be circled and killed. This compelled the demons to escape with all their might.\u201cRun!\u201d\u201cA Godfiend is here. Where are our demon monarchs?\u201d\u201cThe demon monarchs must have been defeated. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t be ordered to retreat.\u201d The demons\u2019 morale had completely plummeted as they frantically fled.Jadesun Palace Lord occasionally attacked, mostly targeting the stronger demons.There are too many ordinary demons. If we really don\u2019t force them into a corner, they will scatter and wreak havoc everywhere. It would result in bigger trouble. However, the demon commanders can forget about escaping. The lieutenant commanders will be killed if possible. Whenever Jadesun Palace Lord discovered a demon commander, he would immediately rush over. As long as he was within a thousand feet of the enemy, he would be able to slay them using thread wisps easily.\u201cThe commander is dead.\u201d\u201cThe lieutenant commander is dead as well.\u201d The remaining demons fled in panic.\u2026One party was frantically retreating while a Godfiend cornered another. In just an hour, all the demons retreated to the Demon Realm.\u201cThe invasion has ended.\u201d Meng Chuan walked along the streets with his father, Meng Dajiang, as they took in the city.The region closest to the World Entrance was the most miserable. There were many casualties; other places were relatively better. People below the Marrow Cleansing realm had hidden in the deep underground tunnels. There had been no time for the demons to enter the tunnels during the short invasion. Those who had participated in the defense were at or above the Marrow Cleansing Realm; they numbered a few thousand.Roughly 1000 people had died in battle. The casualties in the region near the World Entrance numbered 10,000. It was the most tragic region.Furthermore, many places in the city had been destroyed during battles between demons and humans. Houses had collapsed, restaurants were damaged, and the streets were scarred. The traces of battle were everywhere.\u201cDad, Mom, our shop collapsed.\u201d A child looked at the collapsed street and cried.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d The woman hugged the child and looked at her husband\u2014who was covered in blood. She smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s better that we\u2019re alive and together. Nothing else matters.\u201dThe child was still confused.The husband gently hugged his wife and child and said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s indeed good to be alive.\u201d In the past two hours, he had killed three demons with his companions. He had survived and had not lost any limbs. He felt very lucky.\u201cHahaha! Eastcalm Prefecture has survived this tribulation. Another few decades of peace is in order. Hahaha\u2026\u201d A bandaged, old man covered in blood held a gourd of alcohol and laughed as he drank. As he did so, he watched people appear on the streets. The weak, ordinary civilians had been hiding in the underground tunnels, but they had all come out now. This added more life to Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201cUncle Zhang, you\u2019re a hero!\u201d shouted a neighbor as he looked at the elder.\u201cUncle Zhang, come. Take this pair of pig trotters and make some soup with it.\u201d A butcher realized that their shop hadn\u2019t been damaged. The pork that was prepared early in the morning was still there. He immediately wrapped up a pair of pig trotters and gave it to the elderly man.Upon seeing this, Meng Chuan and his father felt much better.\u201cGodfiends are very important, but mortal soldiers are equally important,\u201d said Meng Dajiang with a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s because of them that we were able to hold back the countless demons, preventing the people hiding in the tunnels from being slaughtered. No matter how powerful a Godfiend is, how many of them are there? Of course, battles between the Godfiends and demon monarchs determines the outcome of a war. If the Godfiends lose, it would be pointless for the mortal soldiers to fend off the demons.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded slightly.For the sake of this vibrant Eastcalm Prefecture and for the sake of countless human cities, he had to become a Godfiend! Only after becoming a Godfiend would he have enough power to protect everything.\u2026The ancestral mansion.Meng Chuan and his father arrived at the ancestral mansion.White lanterns now adorned the main entrance of the Meng ancestral mansion. Many clansmen were dressed in mourning attire.\u201cElder.\u201d Soon, a clansman delivered mourning attire to them.Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang wore them.\u201cLet\u2019s go to Third Elder,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. Quite a number of people from the Meng family had died. Four elders had died, and many more at the Marrow Cleansing and Mortal Shedding realm.The Third Elder was the strongest person who had died in battle, so it was only right to pay their respects to him first.The mourning hall was already set up.\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Clan Leader Meng Yanping sat inside, looking like he had aged considerably. \u201cGive Third Brother a kowtow.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dMeng Dajiang kowtowed first, followed by Meng Chuan.After kowtowing, Meng Chuan stood up and saw Third Elder\u2019s corpse. He had already been cleaned up by a mortician. He lay there like he was sound asleep, and even his expression was much more serene than usual.Clan Leader Meng Yanping looked at Meng Chuan and said in a low voice, \u201cWhat Third Brother wanted the most when he was alive, was for you to enter Archean Mountain and become a Godfiend. Meng Chuan, you must not let him down.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\u2026After staying with Third Elder for a while, they went to the other mourning halls.The atmosphere in the Meng Estate was stifling and solemn. After all, many clansmen had died. Many children were still oblivious, having not realized what had happened. After the demon invasion erupted\u2014although 3000 clansmen lived in the ancestral mansion\u2014roughly 2000 people, that had yet to reach the Marrow Cleansing realm, hid in the tunnels. They hid in the tunnels for an hour before coming out again. They had not encountered any danger.They felt like everything was the same as usual.However, many mourning halls were set up in the ancestral mansion, and almost the entire clan was mourning. The children didn\u2019t dare tantrum.\u201cKowtow.\u201d The parents\u2019 eyes were red. They got their children to kowtow one by one. Every family that had lost somebody needed to receive a kowtow. This was because the parents knew that it was due to clansmen risking their lives so they could survive.Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang went to each residence before finally visiting Grandaunt.\u201cGrandaunt.\u201d The father-son duo entered the courtyard.Fairy Meng sat alone in the yard. She didn\u2019t like people tending to her. Cough. Cough. Fairy Meng\u2019s face was pale. Her aura was waning slightly, making it difficult for her to maintain her normal appearance.\u201cGrandaunt, your injuries\u2026\u201d said Meng Chuan worriedly.Upon seeing Meng Chuan, Fairy Meng smiled. \u201cAh, you\u2019re here. My injuries are nothing. I can\u2019t live for long anyway. I\u2019m already very happy that we could fight the demon monarchs and not have Eastcalm Prefecture razed to the ground.\u201dMeng Dajiang also said, \u201cAunt, you don\u2019t have to worry about anything else. Rest well.\u201d\u201cYes, rest well,\u201d said Meng Chuan immediately.Fairy Meng had been a Godfiend for nearly eighty years. She was the family clan\u2019s pillar of support. The Meng family was used to her protection. When she was around, the Meng family would feel settled. If she wasn\u2019t around, it felt as though the Meng family would collapse.\u201cI know my body well,\u201d said Fairy Meng with a chuckle. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can\u2019t bear to die so quickly. I\u2019ll hold on\u2026 Regardless, I\u2019ll survive until winter this year. I need to hear about your successful entry to Archean Mountain before I can rest in peace.\u201dAt this time, there was a knock on the door outside the small courtyard.The door opened.Clan Leader Meng Yanping said from outside, \u201cThird Sis, someone from Jadesun Palace is here. He\u2019s here for Meng Chuan.\u201d\u201cSomeone from Jadesun Palace is looking for Meng Chuan?\u201d Fairy Meng frowned slightly.\u201cFairy,\u201d said another person respectfully from outside the door. \u201cMarquis Southcloud from Wu State\u2019s capital has come to Eastcalm Prefecture. Marquis Southcloud has informed us that he would like to meet Young Master Meng.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMarquis Southcloud?\u201d Fairy Meng was alarmed.King Calm Sea\u2019s position was extremely lofty, and all surrounding states were affected by it. However, Marquis Southcloud was also an extremely powerful Godfiend\u2014one of the strongest in the entire Wu State. He was the one who answered Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s call for help.\u201cMeng Chuan, hurry over,\u201d said Fairy Meng immediately. \u201cDajiang, you should go with him too.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang answered.The father and son immediately followed the messenger to Jadesun Palace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His amiable smile resembled an ordinary scholar. \u201cSpeaking of which, nobody from the Gongsun family has awakened a Phoenix Divine Body bloodline for the past five centuries. Including Liu Qiyue, the two people with phoenix bloodlines aren\u2019t from the Gongsun family. This world is truly unpredictable.\u201dLiu Yebai sat by the side and smiled as he looked at his daughter. He then said, \u201cOur Liu family had a marriage alliance with the Gongsun Family during my grandmother\u2019s generation.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Marquis Southcloud nodded. \u201cFor the sake of their phoenix bloodline, the Gongsun family had forbidden marriage with outsiders. Only after centuries of no descendants awakening the bloodline\u2014along with the threat of demons\u2014did the Gongsun family finally begin allowing marriages with outsiders. Haha, once these marriages happened, it brought us Godfiends with Phoenix Divine Bodies.\u201d\u201cCan I become a Godfiend?\u201d Liu Qiyue couldn\u2019t help but ask. \u201cI reached the Unity realm last year.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not bad for you to reach the Unity realm at the age of sixteen.\u201d Marquis Southcloud nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You will definitely succeed if Archean Mountain wants to nurture you.\u201d\u201cQiyue, since you have awakened your phoenix bloodline, you should become a Godfiend,\u201d Liu Yebai said.Marquis Southcloud continued, \u201cThe news of your Phoenix Divine Body bloodline has long reached Archean Mountain. They have already sent someone over. They should arrive in Eastcalm Prefecture today! When the time comes, you will have to leave and head to Archean Mountain.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving today?\u201d Liu Qiyue felt like everything was happening too suddenly.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Marquis Southcloud nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for me to stay in Eastcalm Prefecture forever. There\u2019s no way Archean Mountain can send a powerful Godfiend as protection. Therefore, it\u2019s safest for you to enter Archean Mountain immediately.\u201dLiu Yebai also said, \u201cQiyue, now that you have awakened a phoenix bloodline, you have to cultivate hard and make yourself stronger.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Liu Qiyue nodded solemnly.When she personally witnessed the demon invasion, she yearned to become stronger and vanquish those demons.\u2026Meng Chuan and his father arrived at Jadesun Palace.\u201cYoung Master Meng, please stay here for a moment. The Marquis is currently talking to Young Master Yan.\u201d An elder led the way, and Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang could only wait by the side. They also saw Liu Yebai and Liu Qiyue sitting in a pavilion.\u201cAh Chuan.\u201d Liu Qiyue was even more surprised. After the demon invasion, she had not seen Meng Chuan. After Meng Chuan killed two demon commanders at Blazing Sun Dao Academy, he had led Demon Monarch Poison Pool away and escaped\u2026 As for Liu Qiyue, she was quickly brought to Jadesun Palace. They hadn\u2019t managed to speak with each other.\u201cQiyue.\u201d Meng Chuan ran over happily. \u201cAre you alright? You seemed to be quite injured back at Blazing Sun Dao Academy.\u201d\u201cIt was after casting a forbidden spell for too long.\u201d Liu Qiyue smiled and shook her head. \u201cI just need to rest for a month.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded slightly.\u201cAh Chuan, I-I\u2026\u201d Liu Qiyue whispered, somewhat reluctant to part with him. \u201cI might be leaving Eastcalm Prefecture today.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re leaving Eastcalm Prefecture today?\u201d Meng Chuan was surprised. He suddenly recalled the flaming arrow that Liu Qiyue had shot.\u201cWhy are you leaving all of a sudden?\u201d Meng Dajiang couldn\u2019t help but ask. Qiyue had come to live at Mirror Lake Meng Manor when she was very young. After all these years, it was as if she was his own child. Meng Dajiang couldn\u2019t bear to part with her.Liu Yebai said, \u201cQiyue awakened a Phoenix Divine Body bloodline. Archean Mountain wants to take her away immediately. In the future, she will cultivate at Archean Mountain.\u201d\u201cShe awoke a phoenix bloodline and will be entering Archean Mountain?\u201d Meng Dajiang was somewhat astonished.He obviously knew about the phoenix bloodline.There were many types of divine bodies. Generally speaking, divine bodies like thunder and lightning were very powerful and difficult to cultivate. The top Lightning Divine Body could be said to be extremely difficult to begin cultivating, but the Phoenix Divine Body was even more strict on its conditions. Outsiders were unable to cultivate it at all. Only those who had awakened the phoenix bloodline could cultivate it. Godfiends who cultivated Phoenix Divine Bodies were extremely rare. The Gongsun family which was known as the Phoenix clan hadn\u2019t had any descendants awaken the bloodline for five centuries.Currently, there was only one person who was a Phoenix Divine Body Godfiend. Liu Qiyue would be the second.\u201cIt\u2019s our dream to enter Archean Mountain.\u201d Meng Dajiang immediately reacted and smiled at Liu Qiyue. \u201cWe must be happy for Qiyue.\u201d\u201cAh Chuan.\u201d Liu Qiyue was very reluctant to part with him.\u201cI will also enter Archean Mountain this December,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile. \u201cWhen the time comes, we will meet again.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Liu Qiyue nodded, but there was still much reluctance in her heart.\u2026While Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue were chatting, Marquis Southcloud was talking to Yan Jin in the hall.\u201cKing Calm Sea\u2019s sword mark saved Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201d Marquis Southcloud sighed. \u201cThis is fate. If you weren\u2019t in Eastcalm Prefecture, Eastcalm Prefecture might have already been annihilated by the demons.\u201dYan Jin stood there, listening obediently.\u201cHowever, the demons will definitely investigate the reason for their failed invasion carefully,\u201d said Marquis Southcloud. \u201cKing Calm Sea is constantly watching over Calm Sea Pass. With the power of the Heavenly Tribulation Sword being only ten or twenty percent of King Calm Sea\u2019s might, the demons will easily deduce that it was only a sword mark. The sealing of a sword mark is very difficult. It requires a huge price. King Calm Sea has only sealed them in a few of his children.\u201d\u201cKing Calm Sea has seven children. Five of them have become Godfiends. Only the youngest two are mortals. The sixth child is cultivating at Calm Sea. Only you came to Eastcalm Prefecture,\u201d said Marquis Southcloud. \u201cAlthough your identity was kept a secret, the demons will still be able to figure this out from their investigations. Once they find out that you are King Calm Sea\u2019s son, they will send the Skydemon Sect to assassinate you. Therefore, you have to leave Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201d\u201cLeave?\u201d Yan Jin was stunned.\u201cYou might die here.\u201d Marquis Southcloud said, \u201cYou can follow me to the state capital. There, I can ensure your safety. You can also return to Calm Sea Pass! There\u2019s nothing to worry about there.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yan Jin shook his head. \u201cI want neither Calm Sea Pass, nor the state capital.\u201dMarquis Southcloud frowned. \u201cWhy are you so insensible?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lord Marquis. I will leave Eastcalm Prefecture. The demons won\u2019t be able to find me so easily,\u201d said Yan Jin.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Marquis Southcloud shook his head. Thinking back to the letter, he recalled that this Seventh Young Master of King Calm Sea\u2019s family was a loner and rather extreme in his ideals. It was indeed the case.\u201cHow about this? You will be participating in Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination this year, right?\u201d Marquis Southcloud asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Yan Jin nodded.The rules of Archean Mountain were strict. Unless one was truly a peerless genius, everyone else was required to participate in the entrance examination. Regardless of whether they were the children of King Calm Sea or the princes of the Great Zhou Dynasty, it was the same for all. Those who were lacking were eliminated.Liu Qiyue was the second person in the world who possessed a phoenix bloodline. There was no need for her to take the test. Archean Mountain immediately accepted her.Yan Jin still had to take the test.\u201cIn that case, you can head straight to Archean City. You can directly participate in Archean Mountain\u2019s test in December,\u201d said Marquis Southcloud.Yan Jin thought for a moment and nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201dHe didn\u2019t like Calm Sea Pass, much less the state capital. These two places had the most number of clansmen from King Calm Sea\u2019s family.\u201cThere will be people from Archean Mountain coming to fetch Liu Qiyue today. When the time comes, you can head to Archean City with them,\u201d said Marquis Southcloud with a smile.\u201cYes.\u201d Yan Jin nodded.\u2026Moments later, Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan entered the hall and paid their respects to Marquis Southcloud.\u201cMarquis Southcloud.\u201d When Meng Chuan saw Marquis Southcloud, his heart was filled with shock.His senses had always been effective, but he couldn\u2019t sense Marquis Southcloud\u2019s existence at all! In fact, even while being in the same hall and being within a hundred feet of each other, his hundred-foot domain couldn\u2019t sense him at all.He could only see him with the naked eye.Such a strange situation alarmed Meng Chuan. He also came to a realization. There is always someone stronger than you. Although my senses are special and mysterious, it is clearly useless in front of Marquis Southcloud. The other party was one of the most terrifying Godfiends in Wu State, after all. It was understandable that his 'sense\u201d failed completely.\u201cGreetings, Lord Marquis.\u201d Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan bowed.\u201cHave a seat, both of you.\u201d Marquis Southcloud instructed as he curiously looked at Meng Chuan. After he sat down, he asked, \u201cMeng Chuan, I heard that you killed two demon commanders one after another at Blazing Sun Dao Academy?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Meng Chuan immediately replied.\u201cHave you reached the realm of Saber Intent?\u201d inquired Marquis Southcloud.The fusion of body, mind, and technique was the first realm\u2014Unity.When one formed a unique Force, their strength would increase tremendously. They could even guide the Heaven and Earth powers. Force was the second realm.If one took a step further, Saber Force could become an embodiment. That was Saber Intent\u2014something one could call their own. Saber Intent was mysterious and unfathomable. Many Godfiends would pursue the Intent realm their entire lives. Saber Intent was the third realm of saber arts.\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t comprehended Saber Intent yet,\u201d said Meng Chuan immediately.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh.\u201d Marquis Southcloud was a bit disappointed.It was said that a young man named Meng Chuan in Eastcalm Prefecture had killed a demon commander with a single slash. He had also killed two in quick succession.Marquis Southcloud\u2019s first thought was that Meng Chuan had comprehended Saber Intent and reached the third realm of saber arts. Comprehending Saber Intent at 18 would make one a peerless genius who would shock Archean Mountain. He would be recruited immediately and didn\u2019t need to participate in the entrance examination.Unfortunately, he had over-thought things.\u201cThen how did you kill the demon commanders?\u201d asked Marquis Southcloud in puzzlement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69: Yun Wanhai\u2019s ArrangementHow did he kill the demon commanders?Meng Chuan\u2019s heart tightened. His grandaunt had long ordered him to keep the glabella space a secret until he had figured out what it was after entering Archean Mountain.\u201cMarquis,\u201d said Meng Chuan respectfully. \u201cWhen I rushed to Blazing Sun Dao Academy, the demons had already attacked Blazing Sun Castle. Qiyue was also heavily injured. I was eager to save her, so I didn\u2019t think too much as I tried to stop the two demon commanders. I never expected my body to erupt with such extraordinary strength at that critical moment. The power of my saber arts also soared, and I managed to kill a demon commander with one slash. Following that, I killed the second demon commander.\u201d\u201cAn eagerness to save Liu Qiyue?\u201d Marquis Southcloud came to a realization. He nodded and smiled. \u201cIt looks like Liu Qiyue is very important to you. She managed to catalyze the eruption of your potential.\u201dIn a life-and-death situation, his strength had skyrocketed.For the sake of the most important person in his life, he was able to unleash greater power. This had precedents in history, but they were few in number. In fact, according to legend, there had been a Godfiend who had erupted with ten times his strength in a desperate situation, thus killing his opponent. But very quickly, he died from his body breaking down!Godfiends at extremely high realms were able to perfectly excavate their bodies\u2019s potential without harming themselves at all. As for those who were able to unleash strength many-fold their usual at critical moments, they ended up dealing tremendous damage to their bodies. The greater the released strength, the greater the damage. Dying from their bodies failing was possible.Of course\u2026It would be very difficult for one to unleash strength multiple times higher. One needed plenty of inducement. Many cultivators found it hard to increase their strength when facing death, no matter how crazily they attacked. For example, when Meng Chuan was being pursued by Demon Monarch Poison Pool\u2014no matter how strong his desire for survival was\u2014his speed only increased by 20%.For example, experts who unleashed strength several times their normal might only be capable of doing so once a lifetime. If they were to face a dire situation again, they wouldn\u2019t be able to replicate that explosion in strength.It could only be obtained by chance!\u201cQiyue and Meng Dajiang grew up together.\u201d Meng Dajiang also explained with a laugh, \u201cThe first thing on this kid\u2019s mind was to save Qiyue when he learned of the demon invasion.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Marquis Southcloud nodded. \u201cAlthough you haven\u2019t figured out Saber Intent, many demons saw you killing two demon commanders. That\u2019s not something that can be hidden! If the demons know about it, they might arrange for the Skydemons to assassinate you.\u201d\u201cSkydemons will carry out assassinations?\u201d Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang felt pressured.In the cultivation system that demons had specially created for human traitors, Skydemons were equivalent to demon monarchs and Godfiends.\u201cYou will definitely be participating in the entrance examination at Archean Mountain, right?\u201d Marquis Southcloud said.\u201cI will participate this year.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cArchean Mountain will be sending someone to fetch Liu Qiyue.\u201d Marquis Southcloud said, \u201cWhen the time comes, you can also go with them. You can stay in Archean City temporarily. There\u2019s no need to worry about danger when you\u2019re there.\u201d\u201cArchean City?\u201d Meng Chuan and his father exchanged glances.The most prosperous and safest city in the Great Zhou Dynasty was not the capital but Archean City.Archean City was located at the foot of Archean Mountain. Many of the Archean Mountain Godfiends had moved their loved ones to the city. There were even powerful Godfiends who lived within the city. They could scale Archean Mountain if there were any pressing matters.That was why Archean City was the safest city in the Great Zhou Dynasty. In eight hundred years, it had also become the most prosperous city.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go to Archean City.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cCan I go with him?\u201d Meng Dajiang asked.\u201cSure.\u201d Marquis Southcloud nodded. \u201cBut you can\u2019t bring anyone else.\u201dIt was common for family members to follow. Every year, geniuses participating in Archean Mountain entrance examination would bring along a family member.Of course, if they were accepted by Archean Mountain, their family members would usually return to their hometown.After the Meng duo left, Marquis Southcloud shook his head slightly. To think that it was just a temporary explosion in strength. I thought that our Wu State had produced a peerless genius who had comprehended Saber Intent at the age of eighteen. I thought too much. He was somewhat disappointed.A genius with the phoenix bloodline was very important. A peerless genius who had comprehended Saber Intent at the age of eighteen was even more important, because such a peerless genius would definitely become an extremely powerful Godfiend. Unfortunately, it was too rare.\u2026Yun family, underground hall.Yun Wanhai sat in the lotus position. His entire body was surrounded by swirling violet flames, and his complexion had turned ruddier. A Godfiend had tenacious vitality. He had been heavily injured and on the brink of death, but four hours of rest significantly ameliorated his condition.\u201cDad.\u201d Leading his siblings, Yun Fucheng stood in front of Yun Wanhai respectfully.\u201cI summoned you because I have something to tell you,\u201d said Yun Wanhai. \u201cI was seriously injured during the demon invasion. If not for Fairy Meng\u2019s protection, I would already be dead.\u201dHis children\u2019s hearts tightened.\u201cI survived,\u201d said Yun Wanhai. \u201cMarquis Southcloud helped me remove the demonic energy in my body, but the demonic energy has damaged my foundation. If I\u2019m careful, I would still be able to live an abject life for two decades. However, I never had any intention of doing. So, I, Yun Wanhai\u2026 will continue to recuperate in Eastcalm Prefecture for ten years. In these ten years, I will groom the children of our clan well. I will also trade my credits for many treasures. Ten years later, I will head to the battlefield.\u201dHis children began to panic.\u201cDad, your injuries are so serious. Even if you don\u2019t go to the battlefield, Archean Mountain will not blame you.\u201d\u201cDad, you have already done a great deed protecting Eastcalm Prefecture, right?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an and Yun Fuyu hurriedly said.Yun Wanhai frowned and glared at his children. He said coldly, \u201cI, Yun Wanhai, insist on dying on the battlefield! Even if I were to die, I will drag a demon monarch down with me!\u201dHis children did not dare make a sound.\u201cI did earn some credit protecting Eastcalm Prefecture. As I\u2019ve said, all the credit that I have accumulated over the past few decades will be exchanged for treasures for the family clan. I\u2019ll leave them to you. I hope that in these ten years, our Yun family will be able to produce a talent.\u201d Yun Wanhai sighed. \u201cAt this moment, I\u2019m somewhat envious of Fairy Meng. Alright, you are dismissed.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d His children could only obediently leave.\u2026Yun Fu\u2019an sat in the hall with a dark expression. The news he just learned was like a bolt from the blue. It left his mind in turmoil.\u201cFu\u2019an.\u201d Yun Fucheng walked in.\u201cBrother.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an immediately rose to welcome him.\u201cI just received news,\u201d said Yun Fucheng. \u201cArchean Mountain have sent people to Eastcalm Prefecture and will take Liu Qiyue, Meng Chuan, and Yan Jin away today. Liu Qiyue will enter Archean Mountain directly. Meng Chuan and Yan Jin will likely stay in Archean City and wait for this year\u2019s Archean Mountain entrance examination.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re leaving today?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an was astonished.\u201cYes, that\u2019s why Jadesun Palace didn\u2019t keep this a secret. I believe the other Godfiend family clans have learned of this.\u201dYun Fucheng nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if it\u2019s Liu Qiyue and Yan Jin. They are foreigners. Even if they become powerful Godfiends in the future, they wouldn\u2019t come back to Eastcalm Prefecture. Meng Chuan is different. It\u2019s impossible for the ten thousand Meng family members to migrate. With his talent\u2014one that\u2019s enough to kill demon commanders\u2014he\u2019ll probably be able to pass the assessment and enter Archean Mountain. The Meng family\u2019s influence in Eastcalm Prefecture will be much greater than it is now.\u201dYun Fu\u2019an\u2019s eyelids kept twitching.\u201cBack then, the engagement annulment had strained the relationship between our families. However, relationships can be improved,\u201d said Yun Fucheng. \u201cThis time, Father and Fairy Meng fought alongside each other. It\u2019s also a form of friendship forged from being comrades-in-arms. Fairy Meng even protected our father. We can visit them and thank them\u2026 We should thank Fairy Meng for saving our father.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a life-and-death battle. I\u2019m sure Father helped Fairy Meng, right?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an whispered.\u201cIt\u2019s just a pretext! A pretext for paying a visit,\u201d Yun Fucheng frowned and berated. \u201cBesides, Father has said that Fairy Meng had saved his life. As his sons, we have to pay them a visit and thank them. Also, we have to prepare a gift for them. First, as a gift of apology. Second, it\u2019s well-wishes for Meng Chuan\u2019s entry into Archean Mountain. The relationship between the two families can\u2019t be reconciled completely, but we mustn\u2019t become enemies. The gifts have been prepared. Prepare to come with me to the Meng family ancestral mansion.\u201d\u201cI need to go as well?\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an asked.\u201cYou were the one to annul the engagement. Of course you have to go,\u201d Yun Fucheng said calmly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOkay.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an could only nod obediently. Although he was unhappy, he knew when to bow.\u2026The Meng family ancestral mansion.As they were leaving Eastcalm Prefecture today, Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang had come to bid farewell to their clansmen.And at this time, the other four Godfiend clans of Eastcalm Prefecture sent people to pay their respects. After paying their respects to Meng family elders who had died in battle, they went to meet Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We will be waiting for your good news here in Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201d Yun Fucheng smiled as he looked at Meng Chuan. \u201cOnce you become a Godfiend, kill a few more demon monarchs.\u201d\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cBack then, I injured my dantian at Qinyang Pass, destroying my hopes of becoming a Godfiend. However, I\u2019m still happy to see new Godfiends from Eastcalm Prefecture appear.\u201d Yun Fucheng smiled. He was genuinely happy.Meng Chuan nodded slightly. He knew quite a bit about the accomplishments of the Yun family clan leader, Yun Fucheng, and was rather impressed.\u201cIt\u2019s still early for Chuan\u2019er to become a Godfiend. He still has to pass the Archean Mountain entrance examination,\u201d Meng Dajiang said humbly.Yun Fucheng shook his head and said, \u201cHe killed a demon commander with a single strike. He\u2019s only 18 years old now. How can he not enter Archean Mountain with such abilities? Brother Dajiang, I really envy you for having such a powerful son.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also very impressed by your teachings, Brother Meng.\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an finally said something. His posture was even a little sycophantic.\u201cI know you guys are busy, so we won\u2019t disturb you any further. You don\u2019t have to send us out.\u201d Yun Fucheng smiled as he led Yun Fu\u2019an away.Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan watched the two of them leave.\u201cThe Three Heroes of the Yun Family are indeed extraordinary. Yun Fu\u2019an is just an expendable person,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cYour grandaunt also said that the Yun family\u2019s patriarch has indeed done great in protecting Eastcalm Prefecture! He had desperately fought against the demon monarchs in the beginning, preventing them from harming your grandaunt. Only when the Yun family\u2019s patriarch collapsed did those demon monarchs have a chance of harming her. It made the situation take a turn for the worse. With this alone, there\u2019s no need to be petty with the Yun family. This is also what your grandaunt wants.\u201d\u201cDad,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile. \u201cYou look down on me. From the beginning, I\u2019ve never paid much attention to them. What I care about is being able to enter Archean Mountain and cultivating to the Godfiend realm.\u201dMeng Dajiang looked at his son and felt very gratified. Nianyun, our child is outstanding, really outstanding.\u2026Night fell.Jadesun Palace was very lively. Quite a number of people were gathered there, all of them were here to send off Meng Chuan, Liu Qiyue, and Yan Jin.\u201cMeng Chuan.\u201d Dean Ge Yu from Mirror Lake Dao Academy was thrilled. \u201cBe well prepared after heading to Archean City. Pass the test in December and enter Archean Mountain!\u201d\u201cI will definitely work hard, Dean,\u201d said Meng Chuan.\u201cTo think that I, Ge Yu, was able to teach an Archean Mountain Godfiend. Haha, that\u2019s enough for me to toot about for the rest of my life.\u201d Ge Yu laughed.Zhong Qianhe from Blazing Sun Dao Academy laughed and said, \u201cOld Ge, how much of Meng Chuan\u2019s capabilities were imparted by you? Are you shameless enough to boast about it?\u201d\u201cWhy not? I taught him the Falling Leaf Saber in many one-on-one sessions!\u201d Ge Yu glared at him. \u201cBrother Dajiang got me to teach him the swift saber because I\u2019m good at the swift saber. I\u2019m inferior to Meng Chuan now, but my greatest pride is having my disciple be stronger than me! I\u2019m happy that my disciple can surpass me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good mindset.\u201d Zhong Qianhe nodded in praise. \u201cYour disciple is stronger than us.\u201d\u201cDean, we\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d Liu Qiyue also bade Zhong Qianhe farewell.\u201cGo ahead,\u201d said Dean Zhong and smiled at his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He was extremely pleased to be able to teach a Godfiend with a Phoenix Divine Body.After bidding farewell to Dean Ge Yu, Meng Chuan walked towards the Godfiends.A few Godfiends stood together. One of them was Marquis Southcloud, while the other was a long-browed elder from Archean Mountain. There were also Jadesun Palace Lord and Fairy Meng standing to the side.\u201cIt\u2019s about time to leave.\u201d The long-browed elder nodded slightly.Fairy Meng turned her head to look at the approaching Meng Chuan and instructed, \u201cMeng Chuan, settle down in peace when you reach Archean City. Ignore everything else. Just focus on your cultivation and prepare for this year\u2019s Archean Mountain entrance examination in December.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Grandaunt,\u201d Meng Chuan said respectfully.\u201cI will be in Eastcalm Prefecture. I\u2019ll wait for your good news at the ancestral mansion.\u201d Fairy Meng looked at him hopefully.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d The long-browed elder urged from afar.There was a massive, black bird. Even when it landed on the ground and retracted its wings, it occupied about a hundred feet. The white-robed Yan Jin was already sitting on the bird and carried a backpack.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Liu Yebai and Liu Qiyue got on the back of the bird.\u201cWe\u2019ll be going as well.\u201d Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan jumped up as well. The bird\u2019s back was several hundred feet long, and there was plenty of space even when the few of them sat cross-legged on top of it.The long-browed elder finally mounted the bird and sat down cross-legged as well.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He ruffled the bird\u2019s feathers gently.With a resounding cry, the enormous black bird soared into the sky.\u201cEastcalm Prefecture.\u201d Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue looked down. Having lived here for so long, they couldn\u2019t bear to part with it.Under the night sky, Eastcalm Prefecture was blanketed with lanterns\u2014white lanterns. Everybody was mourning and accompanying it was the faint sound of crying. All brothels in the city were closed down.\u201cFortunately, we won,\u201d Meng Dajiang said softly. \u201cEastcalm Prefecture will be restored to its former liveliness soon. If we had lost, Eastcalm Prefecture would\u2019ve been massacred. That would be miserable.\u201dYan Jin looked down as well. His mother\u2019s death and everything that had happened over the years made him hate his father. However, the people at Calm Sea Pass were filled with respect for King Calm Sea. His single strike had saved all of Eastcalm Prefecture. It made him view his father differently.At least he protected a lot of people, muttered Yan Jin under his breath. Then, he looked straight. It was where Archean Mountain was.Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue gazed longingly at Eastcalm Prefecture as it grew smaller and smaller. After the bird soared above the clouds, they could no longer see Eastcalm Prefecture.Above the clouds, the stars were bright and clear. The enormous bird spread its wings and now spanned two hundred feet. It shrieked as it advanced. Everyone was seated in the lotus position, most of them looking curiously at the view. Even Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai had never gone above the clouds.\u201cWe can reach Archean Mountain before dawn,\u201d said the long-browed elder. He did not say anything else.\u2026About six hours later, Meng Chuan and company saw Archean Mountain in the middle of the night.\u201cThat is Archean Mountain.\u201d The long-browed elder pointed ahead.\u201cArchean Mountain?\u201dMeng Chuan, Yan Jin, Liu Qiyue, and the others all looked over excitedly. From afar, they saw towering mountain ranges with heights that pierced through the clouds. Meng Chuan and company found the mountain incomparably tall even above the clouds.\u201cArchean Mountain is the highest mountain range in the world,\u201d said the long-browed elder. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason why the sect was established here. It\u2019s also the oldest sect in the world. Its long history can be traced back to the time when humans still lived in tribes.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s head to Archean City first,\u201d the long-browed elder said as he gently tapped the bird\u2019s feathers.The black bird immediately swooped downwards.After passing through the thick clouds, they saw a massive city built at the foot of Archean Mountain. Looking down from above, one could see that Archean City was split into an inner and outer city.\u201cArchean City has an equally long history,\u201d said the long-browed elder. \u201cHuman dynasties can be replaced, and the capitals change, but Archean City remains unchanging. In the past, Archean City spanned twenty-five kilometers\u2014roughly the size of an ordinary city. But ever since the demons invaded, many family clans moved here due to its safety. They expanded into an outer city. The city walls of Archean City reach an astonishing range of a hundred kilometers. In terms of population, it has surpassed the capital and is the largest city in the Great Zhou Dynasty.\u201dMeng Chuan, Liu Qiyue, and Yan Jin looked at the huge city in amazement. It was much bigger than Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201cYan Jin, Meng Chuan, I will send the both of you to Wu State Guild Hall,\u201d said the long-browed elder. \u201cThe two of you will be staying there until the entrance examination at the end of the year.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes,\u201d answered Meng Chuan and Yan Jin.The long-browed elder nodded slightly. The enormous black bird had already swooped into the city, arriving at a luxurious complex that occupied plenty of land. There was a plaque at the front of the complex: Wu State Guild Hall.There was already a group of people waiting in front of the compound. They had waited for almost the entire night.Whoosh.When the bird landed, these people bowed respectfully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Meng Chuan, Meng Dajiang, Liu Yebai, and Yan Jin jumped off the bird.\u201cArrange accommodation for them,\u201d calmly instructed the long-browed elder as he remained sitting on the bird.\u201cYes,\u201d the members of the Wu State Guild Hall replied respectfully.\u201cLiu Yebai.\u201d The long-browed elder looked at Liu Yebai and said indifferently, \u201cAfter your daughter goes up the mountain, she cannot leave the mountain except for special reasons before she becomes a Godfiend. You can communicate through letters. If there\u2019s anything urgent, you can come to the mountain to look for your daughter.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Liu Yebai smiled as he looked at his daughter, Liu Qiyue\u2014who was on the bird\u2019s back. He instructed, \u201cQiyue, cultivate well in Archean Mountain. If anything happens, write to me. I will be staying in Wu State Guild Hall for the next few months.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll write to you.\u201d Liu Qiyue was also very reluctant to part with her father. She turned to look at Meng Chuan. \u201cAh Chuan, I\u2019ll write to you too.\u201dMeng Chuan smiled and nodded.\u201cThis girl.\u201d Liu Yebai smiled and shook his head.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d The long-browed elder gently patted the enormous black bird. It flew into the air, bringing the long-browed elder and Liu Qiyue towards the legendary Archean Mountain.\u201cArchean Mountain.\u201d Meng Chuan and the others looked into the distance. Inside Archean City, they could see the massive mountain range that towered into the clouds. It was where the Godfiends of Archean City cultivated.\u201cSirs,\u201d one of the stewards of Wu State Guild Hall said with a smile. \u201cNow that the guild hall is relatively empty, do you plan on getting a room each or stay together?\u201dMeng Dajiang said, \u201cMy son\u2014Meng Chuan\u2014and I will live together, while Young Master Yan Jin and Brother Liu will have individual rooms.\u201d\u201cThree rooms? Sure, the guild hall is huge. Feel free to choose,\u201d said the steward with a smile. \u201cTowards the end of the year, many geniuses from Wu State will come to participate in the entrance examination. There will be plenty of people then.\u201dNot just anyone could stay at Wu State Guild Hall.Only geniuses participating in the Archean Mountain entrance examination and high officials sent by Wu State were qualified to stay here. Unauthorized people were not allowed to enter.Meng Chuan and company simply chose three small courtyards near the guild hall.\u2026In a small courtyard, Meng Dajiang placed everything he brought along with him into their room. \u201cFrom today onwards, we\u2019ll stay here.\u201d He smiled as he looked at the room. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good here, clean too.\u201d\u201cDad, I\u2019ll choose the room next door,\u201d Meng Chuan said.\u201cHurry up and get some sleep. There\u2019s still quite some time before daybreak.\u201d Meng Dajiang laughed as well. Although he maintained his fat appearance, his face was pale. After all, he had expended a lot of his sanguine aura. He was currently relying on a secret technique to maintain his body size, so he needed to eat and rest more.Meng Chuan nodded and went to his room. The room was decorated simply. There was a bed and a study table by the window. Beside it was a bookshelf with some books.As Meng Chuan lay on the bed and stared at the moon through the window, he felt a potpourri of emotions. He had experienced too much today, and the impact on his psyche was deep.\u2026At dawn, Meng Dajiang warmly called for Yan Jin and Liu Yebai\u2014who were both situated next to them. \u201cCome come, let\u2019s eat breakfast together.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite a sumptuous spread,\u201d Liu Yebai praised as he looked at the breakfast table in the courtyard.\u201cI got the people from the guild hall to send breakfast here. Let\u2019s eat together,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cThis quantity is enough to fill our stomachs.\u201dYan Jin nodded as well. He sat beside Meng Chuan and started eating. Meng Chuan ate some porridge and buns.\u201cThere are meat buns, white steamed buns, and huge pancakes,\u201d cried out Meng Dajiang enthusiastically. He drank the porridge and ate the pancakes rather slowly as though he wasn\u2019t in a rush.\u201cWhat do the two of you plan on doing today?\u201d Liu Yebai was in a good mood. He smiled and asked, \u201cDo you want to head out and take in the sights of Archean City?\u201dMeng Chuan said, \u201cI looked at the Archean City map on my bookshelf after I woke up. It\u2019s too big. There are many places that offer shopping and entertainment. I doubt one can explore the entire city in months. I\u2019d rather cultivate at the guild hall.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll also cultivate at the guild hall,\u201d Yan Jin said.\u201cAlright, alright, you guys cultivate. The two of us will go out for a walk,\u201d Liu Yebai said with a smile.Soon, both Meng Chuan and Yan Jin were full. At that moment, Meng Dajiang began to eat faster. He gobbled down the buns and slurped down the pot of porridge that had been warmed up.Yan Jin\u2019s eyelids twitched when he saw this. He couldn\u2019t help but glance at Meng Chuan. Meng Chuan didn\u2019t eat much, but his father could really eat!\u201cI don\u2019t like to waste food.\u201d Meng Dajiang chuckled as he stood up. \u201cBoth of you cultivate well. We\u2019ll be heading out.\u201dLiu Yebai left the courtyard together with him. The two of them leisurely strolled around Wu State Guild Hall. The guild hall was huge, and the views were beautiful.\u201cYou didn\u2019t have your fill, am I right?\u201d Liu Yebai teased Meng Dajiang.\u201cThe battle with the demons yesterday consumed too much of my sanguine aura. I need to replenish it by eating,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cLet\u2019s find a place to eat. We\u2019ll get an entire pig and goat.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Liu Yebai nodded.\u201cRight, regarding the awakening of the phoenix bloodline in Qiyue, I\u2019m afraid the Liu family has learned about it,\u201d said Meng Dajiang.\u201cHumph, I have been avoiding them all these years, but things are different now. My daughter has awakened a phoenix bloodline and even entered Archean Mountain. What am I to fear now?\u201d Liu Yebai scoffed. \u201cEven if the Liu family knows about it, they have to come and beg me obediently.\u201d\u201cAre you planning on going back?\u201d Meng Dajiang asked.\u201cUnless they return Elephant Goat Mountain to my lineage, I will not go back unless I die.\u201d Liu Yebai\u2019s face had a hint of disdain. \u201cThey will say all kinds of nice things and beg me, but when it comes to returning Elephant Goat Mountain? Impossible. Only when my daughter is conferred the title of marquis will the Liu family truly bow their heads. They will even obediently offer Elephant Goat Mountain on a platter.\u201d\u201cMarquis-conferment?\u201d Meng Dajiang nodded slightly. \u201cThat will be very difficult.\u201dIt was very difficult.A marquis was one of the most powerful figures in the Wu State. An expert with a Phoenix Divine Body would bring greater levels of intimidation! The Liu family would most likely be willing to invite Liu Qiyue to be the leader of the family clan then.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about these irritating matters. Let\u2019s head out and get some food for you.\u201d Liu Yebai said.\u2026In the Wu State Guild Hall, Meng Chuan cultivated like usual. However, without the guards and servants to assist him, he was only able to train his Saber Drawing Stance alone.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!The aqueous saber slashed across the sky, but it did not cause any shockwaves. At his level, air resistance was no longer a problem due to the influence of the Heaven and Earth powers.He executed his saber techniques over and over again.In the past, Meng Chuan needed guards to fire arrows at him. Firstly, it was to hone his accuracy, and secondly, it was to ensure that he was getting faster with every strike.But, Meng Chuan now discovered that his training wasn\u2019t greatly affected even without his guards\u2019 help.His hundred-foot perception domain was able to casually lock onto a speck of dust that floated in the air! He could then cleave it. He would be able to train his accuracy using this method. Unfortunately\u2014although the dust particles were small\u2014they moved too slowly, making it not too difficult.As for the variation of his saber art speed? That was no longer a concern. With his perception domain, the speed of each strike was very precise, allowing him to judge his striking speed clearly.As a result, without any guards, he only suffered a slight drop in efficiency. He could still hone his accuracy and speed.He ate lunch with Yan Jin. As for Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai, they didn\u2019t return from their gallivanting.After his cultivation ended, Meng Chuan used the well water from the courtyard to wash himself. After changing clothes, he sat at the desk in the room and started to draw.Meng Chuan had gotten the guild hall\u2019s staff to buy the materials needed for painting early in the morning. Naturally, he paid for it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEastcalm Prefecture.As he looked at the snow-white canvas, his heart was filled with thoughts of his hometown\u2014Eastcalm Prefecture. He held the brush in his hand, but he hesitated.He felt a lot more stifled. From the demon invasion yesterday morning until now, everything he had experienced touched something deep within him.He had experienced it once when he was a six-year-old child. He only had the role of a fugitive then. Now at the age of eighteen, he had participated in the battle at Eastcalm Prefecture. His feelings were completely different.As he was deep in thought, the intense emotions in him burst out. Ignoring everything else, he started painting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A dense horde of demons poured out from the World Entrance and spread in all directions.He slowly painted, starting with a rough outline.He focused on one of the demons on the periphery of the spreading horde. It was a mantis demon. He drew it extremely carefully because it was the demon that had left the deepest impression on him when he was six.\u2026While painting, the translucent tiny person in his glabella space began to emit a spiritual light. After all these years\u2014ever since painting \u201cPeople Resonance\u201d\u2014this was the second time it underwent transformations.\u2026He immersed himself in his painting, mainly focusing on the mantis demon and its pursuit of his family of three.The father ran while carrying the child. The mother charged at the mantis demon with a sword.Just this scene alone took him more than two hours to finish, and this was only one corner of the giant canvas.When he stopped painting, Meng Chuan realized the changes in his glabella space.The tiny person in my glabella space is glowing? He was surprised, but the spiritual glow gradually weakened.The appearance of this glabella space really has something to do with my painting. Meng Chuan was very surprised. When he was 16 years old, he had painted \u201cPeople Resonance.\u201d It was also his best painting after all these years. That night, he had discovered the glabella space followed by the Power of the Soul. But at that time, he wasn\u2019t completely certain that it was related to painting.It could have been a coincidence.The intense emotions he had while painting this time were no less than when he was painting \u201cPeople Resonance.\u201d The glowing of the tiny person in his glabella space convinced him\u2014it had something to do with painting!I\u2019ve never heard of anyone producing the mysterious Power of the Soul via painting? After pondering for a long time, Meng Chuan still couldn\u2019t figure it out. Forget it. Once I enter Archean Mountain, I\u2019ll definitely find out why.At the very least, the Power of the Soul was of great help to him.\u2026From this day onwards, Meng Chuan\u2019s intense emotions fully fused into the painting. This painting also took up a lot of time. He would paint for as little as two hours up to six hours a day.After spending more than six months on the canvas, he finally finished.It was a set of paintings\u2014a total of three separate pieces.The first one was 16 feet long. In the middle of the painting was a dense horde of demons appearing at the World Entrance. They spread out in every direction. Demons committed carnage everywhere. There were parents who wanted to protect their children, but they were stabbed by a demon\u2019s sharp tail.There was a scene depicting corpses everywhere. A child stood there crying while an elder faced the demons in battle. There was also a father running with his child on his back while the mother fought off the demons using a sword\u2026Meng Chuan drew a total of thirty-eight scenes. Every scene clearly depicted the appearances of demons and humans. They were all scenes he had personally experienced or seen with his own eyes. Every time he drew, the flames in his heart burned even brighter.\u2026In the periphery\u2014some distance away from the demons\u2014Dao Academy disciples, merchants, and ordinary pedestrians were all panicking.\u2026At the outer perimeter, stood three Godfiends at Jadesun Palace, ready for battle.There were other places.In a Dao Academy, the weaker disciples entered the tunnels, while the stronger disciples watched the approaching demons with either determined or nervous looks. Under the guidance of their dean and lecturers, the veterans prepared them for battle.Without exception, the weak\u2014regardless of their status\u2014lined up to enter the tunnels.The powerful\u2014regardless of gender or age\u2014stood alongside each other as they braced for battle.\u2026The sun in the painting had just risen, indicating that the demon invasion was at dawn.This was only the first painting.The second painting was about 18 feet long. It was much more cruel and bloody.The center of the painting depicted corpses, a result of the demons\u2019 targeting. They consisted of men, women, and children. Some were youths dressed in Dao Academy robes.Battles erupted everywhere.A human warrior held a shield to resist the demons while another human warrior shot arrows from afar. A human\u2019s abdomen had been stabbed but he continued hugging the demon tightly as another companion slashed open the demon\u2019s head with a saber.Some humans successfully killed demons thanks to the traps they set up. However, more demons charged over from the sides. There was a father and son duo who worked together to deal with demons. There were veteran soldiers dealing with the demons.\u2026Meng Chuan had personally witnessed all these tragic scenes. They were very common scenes during the demon invasion in Eastcalm Prefecture. He drew them based on his memory. He drew the determination in the eyes of those who chose to perish with the demons, while their companions continued the battle in pain\u2026Why are they working so hard? Meng Chuan had once been puzzled. But during his painting process, he realized why when he drew out each living person.They did it for hope.They did it for the sake of their loved ones and hope\u2014the hope to still see the sun rise again.They needed to work hard to ensure that their family survived.\u2026He drew the scene of the Blazing Sun Dao Academy trying its best as the demons charged into Blazing Sun Castle. The veterans, soldiers, and youths desperately defended, using their lives as a wall between the demons and the weaker juniors who were hiding in the tunnels.\u2026A Godfiend family clan was also fighting desperately. Elders charged ahead to fend off the demons. The young ones and youths also fought. A bald elder led the charge only to have his chest impaled by a tentacle. Yet, he managed to kill the demon with one saber strike.\u2026The Godfiends at Jadesun Palace were also fighting desperately. A Godfiend had already collapsed and a female Godfiend struggled to hold on. Only the last male Godfiend fought the four demon monarchs.They only had one Godfiend\u2014who could still fight\u2014left, but it was a desperate battle.It was also for hope.\u2026The sun of another painting rose a little higher.The entire painting depicted fighting everywhere. This took Meng Chuan three months.\u2026The third painting was 16 feet long. The situation on the battlefield reversed. People from all directions began attacking the demons as the demons fled in panic.All the demons were fleeing. They were terrified. They looked to be in sorry states as they were slain one by one. They frantically charged towards the World Entrance in the middle. It was where they came from, and now, it was their salvation.Meanwhile, in the periphery, a sword beam descended from the sky to slay a demon monarch in Jadesun Palace while the other demon monarchs fled pathetically.In the Dao Academy, everyone was treating their heavily injured companions. There were adults and youths who were seriously injured.People had also died in combat, people of both genders and all ages. Some were very beautiful, or very old and haggard. People wept sadly for the dead heroes.Everywhere\u2014ordinary residences, restaurants, tea houses, Godfiend family clans, and so on\u2014began to treat the injured and move the human corpses.As for the numerous demon corpses scattered everywhere, people couldn\u2019t be bothered to look at them. They were mostly taking care of the injured and grieving for the dead.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAlthough the battle was won, there was no joy in the entire painting. Instead, one could feel battle intent coming from it. It was a strong battle intent! Heroes had died, but the living would continue to advance and fight, never stopping.The sun rose even higher in the east.The colors of this painting were the brightest among the three.\u2026After Meng Chuan finished painting, he fell silent for a long time. Finally, he wrote four words on the last painting: \u201cFacing the Morning Sun.\u201d He didn\u2019t have a name for the first and second painting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - Arrival (Final Chapter of Volume)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73: Arrival (Final Chapter of Volume)CKtalonAfter writing the words \u201cFacing the Morning Sun,\u201d Meng Chuan scrutinized the three paintings that had been set on the table.He had found painting these three paintings for the past six months cathartic. From the moment he laid down his brush, he had felt aggrieved, angry, and confused. After all, many people had died in Eastcalm Prefecture that fateful day. He had seen many massacres.But after the painting was done, his heart had become calm. However, deep within the calm, sea-like heart, there was an unshakable desire to do battle! Countless humans had fought the demons over the generations, because of hope. For the sake of hope, for their loved ones and children, all of them were willing to risk their lives. Mortals were willing to risk their lives and it was likewise for Godfiends.I won\u2019t be rash. I will try my best to become stronger. I\u2019ll become a Godfiend, a powerful Godfiend. One day, we humans will defeat the demons completely.No one could stop the morning sun\u2019s eventual rise.Creak.Meng Chuan pushed open the door and entered the courtyard. The setting sun dyed the western sky red.Sitting in the courtyard, Meng Chuan inspected his glabella space. The tiny figure in his glabella space wasn\u2019t as translucent as before, and was much more corporeal.I have the Power of the Soul. It resulted from painting. Ordinary paintings are useless, only People Resonance and Facing the Morning Sun started the metamorphosis. During the two years after I drew People Resonance, I\u2019ve been painting every day with my emotions completely submerged into them, but no changes to my soul occurred. Clearly, it\u2019s not easy to sublimate my soul.My soul has turned corporeal,but the domain remains a hundred feet wide. My perception range is still half a kilometer.Meng Chuan was somewhat puzzled.I\u2019ll try my saber arts.With a thought, Meng Chuan immediately activated the Power of the Soul. It seamlessly fused with the Quintessential Essence in his body, immediately increasing his control over his body to insane levels. With a single move, he charged forward thirty feet, then slashed out with his saber! The aqueous saber beam traveled through the air, but it didn\u2019t stir the wind. The mere sight of his actions\u2014with the naked eye\u2014was enough to make the heart palpitate.There\u2019s no difference in the Power of the Soul. My strength is the same as before.Meng Chuan continued to use his saber arts.Saber beams lit up in the courtyard. Every strike was unleashed with all his might!Fifth move, sixth move, seventh move\u2026Meng Chuan kept attacking as his heart filled with joy. He realized that he had a lot more Power of the Soul than before.The sixteenth move!After the sixteenth strike, he realised that his Power of the Soul was nearly depleted. He couldn\u2019t deliver another full power strike again.He revealed a smile as he stood in the courtyard.The changes to the soul doesn\u2019t have anything to do concerning strength amplifications. Instead, the Power of the Soul increased in quantity. In the past, I could only deliver five maximum strength strikes, but now I can go up to sixteen strikes.\u2026In the yard next door, Yan Jin held both swords as he stared ahead. He seemed to see that cold, muscular man, as well as the Heavenly Tribulation Sword that had swept across the sky.Yan Jin\u2019s goal was to defeat that man. However, after having seen the Heavenly Tribulation Sword\u2014one that was merely a sword mark, meaning that its power was only 10% of the actual Heavenly Tribulation Sword\u2019s\u2014Yan Jin became acutely aware how powerful that man was.\u201cI\u2019ll defeat you.\u201d Yan Jin once again swung his sword, his eyes bore into the cold, stocky man in front of him.\u2026Days passed as Meng Chuan and Yan Jin cultivated every day. During this period, Liu Qiyue would occasionally send letters, one to her father and one to Meng Chuan.In the blink of an eye, it was winter and it was December.It first snowed on 18th December, three days before the Archean Mountain entrance examination.Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.Meng Chuan repeated the Saber Drawing Stance over and over again.With a slash, the Heaven and Earth powers he stirred would envelop a range of 1000 feet. He could sense everything within a thousand feet.My Saber Force has been cultivated to its peak.Force could stir the Heaven and Earth powers. Upon reaching the limit, one could use the Heaven and Earth powers to sense everything that was enveloped by the Heaven and Earth powers one had stirred! This was a domain formed by Saber Force.However, there was a flaw in this domain. If one used the Heaven and Earth powers to sense objects, their senses would be blurred when facing an opponent who could also influence the Heaven and Earth powers. However, at such a level, one would be even more powerful when using their body\u2019s potential and Quintessential Essence.With his current strength, Meng Chuan was roughly 50% stronger than at the beginning of the year.Once Saber Force reaches its peak, the next step is to form Saber Intent, but how do I form Saber Intent?Meng Chuan pondered.Saber Intent was the third realm of saber arts. The difficulty of attaining Saber Intent was even greater than becoming a Godfiend. This was because the conditions to become Godfiends were to comprehend Force, condense a core, and transcend the Life-and-Death juncture! Thus, most newly-advanced Godfiends were only in the Force realm.Grandaunt told me that she reached the Intent realm at the age of fifty despite becoming a Godfiend at the age of thirty-five. This is also the highest realm she reached.Fairy Meng was considered fast. There were records that mentioned many newly-advanced Godfiends had only managed to form Intent when they were above eighty years of age. Some reached the Intent realm when they were centenarians.Those that were able to become Godfiends were all extraordinary. However, it was extremely difficult for them to comprehend Intent. Many ended up stuck in the Force realm for many years.I\u2019ll take it slow. Three days from now, it will be the Archean Mountain entrance examination. After being accepted, I will receive their guidance. There should be a better cultivation method for Saber Intent in the books available at Archean Mountain.Aim for the skies; not doing so will only result in mediocrity. If he wanted to comprehend intent, he needed to do it in Archean Mountain. To comprehend intent through trial and error would be too slow.Suddenly, he heard someone call him.\u201cChuan\u2019er, Young Master Yan, the people from Wu State have arrived,\u201d Meng Dajiang shouted loudly.The people from Wu State are here?Meng Chuan put away his saber and walked out of his room, and Yan Jin did the same.Meng Chuan and Yan Jin both looked into the distance and saw a giant fiery-red bird swoop down from above. On top of it was a large group of people\u2014seated in the lotus position. They landed at the guild hal\u2019s main entrance.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look.\u201d Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai called out to them.Meng Chuan and Yan Jin followed them.When they arrived at the main hall of Wu State Guild Hall, a large group of people also arrived. Leading them was none other than the modest and refined Marquis Southcloud.Meng Chuan and company attracted the attention of many the moment they entered.\u201cThat\u2019s Meng Chuan.\u201d\u201cHe killed two demon commanders in a row.\u201dPeople secretly sent voice transmissions to each other.Meng Chuan, Yan Jin, Liu Yebai, and Meng Dajiang bowed respectfully. \u201cGreetings, Lord Marquis.\u201dMeng Chuan also noticed that there were ten youths in the hall. Almost all of them were accompanied by older people. These were all the Wu State geniuses that were participating in Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination.\u201cGood.\u201d Marquis Southcloud smiled and nodded.\u201cTwelve people from our Wu State will be taking part in the Archean Mountain entrance examination,\u201d said Marquis Southcloud with a smile. \u201cThese two are from Eastcalm Prefecture. One is called Meng Chuan, and the other is Yan Jin. They came to Archean City a few months ago. All of you can familiarize yourselves with each other. Also, in three days, on 21st December, the Archean Mountain entrance examination will be held. I\u2019ll bring you there early that morning, so make sure that you are present.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Everyone acknowledged respectfully.Marquis Southcloud\u2019s status was far higher than theirs. If it weren\u2019t for the fact he had to escort these geniuses, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for these geniuses to meet him.\u201cYoung Master Meng, I am Wang Buyu of the Wang family in Wu City.\u201d An elegant scion immediately ran over and smiled. \u201cI heard that you killed two demon commanders one after another? I\u2019ve always wanted to meet you after I learned of this news, Young Master Meng. I\u2019ve finally gotten to meet you today.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Wang,\u201d Meng Chuan greeted politely.The elders left to choose their accommodations. The youths began to talk with each other.\u201cThis is bad. Our Wu State sent twelve people. The entire Great Zhou Dynasty has 23 states! There are also many geniuses in the capital and Archean City. Yet, Archean Mountain only recruits 20 people. If we split them evenly, some states don\u2019t even get a spot!\u201dA young man and his companions talked poignantly through voice transmissions.\u201cThere\u2019s also a group of geniuses with extraordinary strength like Meng Chuan. It\u2019s impossible to pass the entrance examination in three days.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cArchean Mountain\u2019s assessment is multifaceted. We might stand a chance,\u201dsaid his smiling companion via voice transmission.\u2026After getting to know one another, the group of youths went back to their own rooms and began to prepare for the Archean Mountain entrance examination. This entrance examination would affect their future.Final Chapter of Volume\u2014Battle of Eastcalm PrefecturePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The day for the Archean Mountain entrance examination was finally here. He had been waiting a long time for this day to come.Meng Chuan thought of many people at that very moment. His father, mother, grandaunt, clan leader, Third Elder, and many other clan elders hoped that he could enter Archean Mountain.\u2026In a nearby room, Meng Dajiang stared at a painting hanging on the wall. It was a painting of his wife.The day has finally come.Meng Dajiang looked at the portrait.I\u2019ve done all I can. I sparked Chuan\u2019er\u2019s interest in the saber. I sparred with him. I found a suitable Dao Academy teacher for him. The credits I\u2019ve accumulated over the past few years have been exchanged for Chuan\u2019er\u2019s Iceheart Fruit. I\u2019ve done whatever I can!I, Meng Dajiang, am a mediocre person, but the son I\u2019ve raised is my greatest pride! Nianyun, our son will definitely enter Archean Mountain.Meng Dajiang was equally nervous.Suddenly, they heard a voice from outside. \u201cYoung Master Meng, Young Master Yan, Lord Marquis has summoned everyone. They are preparing to set off.\u201dWe\u2019re setting off?Meng Dajiang wiped the corners of his eyes and walked out of his house. He immediately shouted, \u201cChuan\u2019er, Chuan\u2019er, we\u2019re leaving.\u201dCreak.Meng Chuan walked out from his own room, his saber by the waist. He smiled at his father. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dMeng Chuan, Meng Dajiang, and Yan Jin gathered at Wu State Guild Hall\u2019s lobby.Although it had snowed yesterday, the snow inside the guild hall yards had long been cleared. Only the trees and rooftops were left covered in snow.\u201cYoung Master Meng.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Yan.\u201d Everyone in the lobby greeted them.Out of the twelve young adults, only Yan Jin was alone. The others had elders accompanying them.\u201cEveryone is here. Let\u2019s set off now.\u201d Marquis Southcloud entered the lobby and did a sweeping glance. Everyone followed when he walked out.Within a spacious garden at the guild hall, a fiery red bird stood waiting. One by one, they leaped onto the bird\u2019s back.Meng Chuan, Yan Jin, and Meng Dajiang sat in a corner on the bird\u2019s back.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d said Marquis Southcloud.The fiery-red bird immediately flew up. From above, one could see every street and gorgeous building in Archean City. It was quite the unique experience.\u2026Meanwhile, at Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s Meng family.In the ancestral hall, Fairy Meng was kneeling on a prayer mat. She pressed her palms together in anticipation.\u201cAncestors, please bless us. Please bless our Meng family\u2019s descendant, Meng Chuan. Please let him pass the Archean Mountain entrance examination and be admitted into Archean Mountain.\u201d Fairy Meng\u2019s pale face wore a hint of death. The demon invasion had hurt her too much. Her body was on the verge of collapse. If it weren\u2019t for her strong obsession, she wouldn\u2019t have survived until today.Meng Chuan was the Meng family\u2019s hope. If she died, Meng Chuan would be the future pillar of support.Thus, she waited for news of Meng Chuan\u2019s admission into Archean Mountain. Only then could she rest in peace.\u2026Ah Chuan.On a mountain peak on Archean Mountain, Liu Qiyue was distracted while reading a book. She looked at the vast sea of clouds through the window, feeling a little nervous.Ah Chuan is going to take the entrance examination today, right? He will definitely pass!\u2026The Archean Mountain entrance examination is today, 21st December. Will he be admitted into Archean Mountain?Yun Qingping couldn\u2019t help but have such thoughts arise in her as she practiced her swordplay in the morning. She then shook her head.Why think about this?She continued practicing her swordplay.\u2026Meng Chuan and company sat on the fiery-red bird\u2019s back. The bird flew at a height of 1000 feet. It wasn\u2019t fast, and it allowed its riders to enjoy the view of Archean City. The bird flew dozens of kilometers before slowly descending. It landed near a vast palace. On the palace\u2019s front door, there were three large words: Blazing Sun Palace.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d After Marquis Southcloud transported Meng Chuan and company to their destination, he softly instructed his mount. The fiery bird soared into the sky and flew towards Archean Mountain.\u201cEveryone, follow me,\u201d said a steward\u2014who had accompanied them\u2014of the Wu State Guild Hall. \u201cLord Marquis has matters to attend to. All you need to do is follow me.\u201dThe steward smiled and said, \u201cBlazing Sun Palace is a side area of Archean Mountain. Every year, the Archean Mountain entrance examination\u2019s registration is held here. Of course, our guild hall has already registered the twelve geniuses of Wu State. Everyone, please follow me inside. I estimate that in an hour, the Archean Mountain Godfiends will come. The test will officially begin when that happens.\u201d\u201cThank you, Steward Wang.\u201d Immediately, some of the clan elders went over to strike up conversations.Meng Chuan and company entered the Blazing Sun Palace together.A square could be seen after passing through the palace doors. There were already many youths in the palace square, with many elders and servants by their side.\u201cOh?\u201d Many people looked over when they entered.\u201cIt\u2019s people from the Wu State. The person wearing a deep blue robe with a saber by his waist is called Meng Chuan. It\u2019s said that he killed a demon commander with a single slash and did it twice in a row. He is extremely strong,\u201d said a purple-dressed woman after taking a look. \u201cThere are twenty admission spots for Archean Mountain, so he probably has one spot. Also, the white-robed young man beside him is much more powerful than ordinary Core Condensation experts. Furthermore, he\u2019s also King Calm Sea\u2019s seventh son.\u201d\u201cKing Calm Sea\u2019s seventh son? Are you sure?\u201d asked a tall man beside her in surprise.\u201cHow could the princess\u2019s intelligence be wrong?\u201d Another golden-robed youth laughed.\u201cThis was originally a secret, but after King Calm Sea\u2019s sword mark saved the entire Eastcalm Prefecture, the imperial family found out that King Calm Sea\u2019s mysterious seventh son had gone to Eastcalm Prefecture under the alias Yan Jin,\u201d said the purple-robed woman \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry too much about it. Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination doesn\u2019t care about background, only strength and potential. This time, there are many geniuses that pose quite a threat\u2014Wu State\u2019s Meng Chuan, Jiang State\u2019s Ning Yibo\u2026 The very famous ones already roughly account for ten people, and there might be people who hid their strength. Perhaps there are some who have broken through. Even I\u2019m not confident of securing a spot.\u201d\u201cPrincess, your archery is the best in the imperial capital amongst the younger generation. You will definitely be admitted into Archean Mountain,\u201d praised the golden-robed youth.\u2026Meng Chuan\u2019s group naturally waited together.Suddenly, there was a commotion outside the palace.A red-robed youth walked in barefoot. A group of people followed behind him. Five of them had terrifying auras. Clearly, they were Godfiends.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to follow me. What\u2019s the point of following me?\u201d said the red-robed youth impatiently.\u201cHaha, Tong\u2019er, you are participating in Archean Mountain\u2019s test today. We are all very concerned, so we would like to watch.\u201d\u201cAs your granduncle, I want to see you get admitted into Archean Mountain.\u201d The elders behind him all chuckled.The red-robed youth was helpless as well. Behind him were his parents, grandparents, and a few other clansmen with extremely high status in the family clan.\u201cThat\u2019s Yan Chitong, the number one genius of Archean City. He\u2019s the only son of Marquis West Sea. He\u2019s extremely talented. He comprehended Force despite only being thirteen this year! Since he\u2019s very young, even if he\u2019s ranked outside of the top twenty, Archean Mountain might admit him.\u201d\u201cI hope he ranks past twenty! He\u2019s only thirteen years old. Why is he competing with us?\u201d\u201cThe Yan family has one king, one marquis, and nearly twenty Godfiends. Now that another genius has been produced, it\u2019s truly a joyous occasion\u2026\u201d The descendants of ancient Godfiend family clans all sighed in amazement. Even large family clans in the imperial capital and Archean City would look up to the Yan family!Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang pricked up their ears to listen.They weren\u2019t privy to a lot of intelligence. They hadn\u2019t heard of many geniuses. After all, the Meng family was only an ordinary Godfiend family clan in Eastcalm Prefecture. The matriarch of the family clan, Fairy Meng, hadn\u2019t been admitted into Archean Mountain. It was normal for them to be ignorant.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs time passed, more and more people gathered in the square. It was especially so for the locals of Archean City. Many of them were accompanied by three to five elders.Boom!Finally, the doors of Blazing Sun Palace closed.

They could barely make out the three figures flying towards them. The leader was a linen-clothed man. Behind him were a cyan-clothed woman and a sloppy man.Huh?Meng Chuan and Yan Jin felt stabbing pain in their eyes. Their heartbeats quickened, and their lifeblood turned unstable. They hurriedly looked down, afraid of looking straight at them.None of the mortals dared to take another look. Meng Dajiang also lowered his head slightly.\u201cFlight with just the body?\u201d\u201cThese three can actually fly with their bodies.

The one leading the group is King East River!\u201dAs the bustling crowd lowered their heads, they conversed via voice transmissions. One could release their Quintessential Energy to transmit voice transmissions once they were in the Force realm. Most of the people present were capable of sending voice transmissions.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!The three Archean Mountain Godfiends landed at another spot in Blazing Sun Palace.\u201cEveryone, King East River and the two Godfiends have arrived.\u201d There were some stewards inside the Blazing Sun Palace as well. One of them, a goateed man, loudly said, \u201cAll who are participating in Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination, line up according to the names I call out. The first one is Dragoncloud State\u2019s Wu Chang. Second, Jiang State\u2019s Zhang Ping. Third\u2026\u201dNames were called out one by one.

He walked ahead, and the three hundred-plus geniuses followed him obediently. Be it princes or princesses, children of Regis Godfiends, or extremely talented geniuses, all of them followed the rules. When they saw the auras of the Regis Godfiend and the two Marquis Godfiends, they had felt the astonishing difference in strength.Just a glance from a distance caused their lifeblood to become chaotic. This made them even more eager to become Godfiends.After they left the square, they passed through a palace door.They arrived at a small palace yard, where a group of Godfiends were seated in the distance. The Godfiends who had escorted the geniuses from the twenty-three states of the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2014such as Marquis Southcloud and the others\u2014were all chatting and laughing. King East River\u2014who was in charge of presiding over the entrance examination\u2014was seated at the seat of honor while the other two Marquis Godfiends were seated to his sides.King East River was dressed in linen clothes. He restrained his aura, making him appear like an ordinary person. However, his bearing was dissimilar to a mortal\u2019s.\u201cMarquis West Sea, your son comprehended Force at the age of thirteen. His talent can be said to be extremely high! He can be given an additional spot and directly enter Archean Mountain. Why did he participate in the test?\u201d King East River laughed.Marquis West Sea\u2014who was seated beside him\u2014immediately laughed and said, \u201cSenior Brother, that kid of mine has always had a mind of his own. Two months ago, he comprehended Force and insisted on participating in Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination. He said that he was going to compete with all the elites in the world. This kid didn\u2019t think through it. He has just comprehended Force, and his competitors are far older than him. Most of them are at higher cultivation realms and have richer battle experience than him. Isn\u2019t he just seeking trouble for himself? But he still insisted on coming.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to broaden his horizons.\u201d King East River smiled as he swept his gaze across the three hundred-plus geniuses walking over. His face changed slightly.\u201cHumph.\u201d King East River suddenly let out a cold snort\u2014it was as if thunder was echoing out in all directions of the palace yard.The three hundred-plus people were shocked. Even the Godfiends were astonished.\u201cOur Archean Mountain limits participants\u2019 age to twenty years old or younger,\u201d said King East River. \u201cAmong the 312 of you, one of you has already exceeded twenty years of age. If you step out obediently, you will be punished lightly. If I catch you, I believe you will regret it for the rest of your life.\u201d\u201cExceed twenty?\u201d Meng Chuan and company broke out in a commotion.Suddenly, two youths walked out of the group. The two exchanged glances, both stunned.One of them bowed respectfully in the direction of the Godfiends. \u201cI am Yu Wanfeng from the Chang State. I was an orphan that was later adopted by the Yu family. I don\u2019t know my true age either.\u201dThe other youth said respectfully, \u201cI am Tian Gu from the An State. When I was a child, my hometown was invaded by demons and I wandered the land. I was young back then, and I don\u2019t know my exact age either. When the Tian family adopted me, they decided that I was five years old.\u201d\u201cAn State\u2019s Tian Gu, you are twenty-one years old,\u201d said King East River. \u201cYou have exceeded the limit and it\u2019s against the rules of Archean Mountain. Since you\u2019ve admitted it, go serve in the military for ten years.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The youth bowed respectfully.Normally, military service lasted five years.However, some took the initiative to extend their military service. For example, Meng Dajiang had been in military service for ten years. The dean of Mirror Lake Dao Academy, Ge Yu, had spent twelve years in Qinyang Pass before he had created his saber art. Therefore, serving in the military for ten years was considered a slap on the wrist. This was also due to the fact that the other party had taken the initiative to step forward, and had been a vagrant during his childhood.Regis Godfiends can tell the age of all three hundred of us at a glance?Meng Chuan was secretly surprised. He knew that Archean Mountain had the means to assess the participants\u2019 ages, but he had never expected that it took only a glance from a Godfiend.Tian Gu from the An State obediently left. He had no right to participate in the entrance examination.As for Yu Wanfeng, he was somewhat glad. Clearly, his actual age had not exceeded the limits.\u2026311 youths stood there, while a large group of relatives entered the palace. However, there were railings blocking them from approaching.\u201cEveryone.\u201d The sloppy-looking man seated next to King East River rose to his feet. He took a few steps forward, then looked at the geniuses before saying with a laugh, \u201cArchean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination is held over two days. Today is the preliminary selection, and tomorrow will be the final selection.\u201d\u201cThe preliminaries are divided into three segments. Every segment requires one to reach the minimum threshold. Those who can\u2019t reach the threshold will be eliminated immediately. After the three segments, an overall score will be tabulated. The top 100 will pass the preliminaries, and the rest will all be eliminated.\u201d\u201cThe first segment of the preliminaries\u2026\u201d The sloppy-looking man flicked his sleeve, and layers of light appeared in front of him. These light barriers were a hundred feet long, three hundred feet wide, and an inch thick. There were approximately two hundred of these dense light barriers.\u201cAccording to your order, each of you will use your full strength to attack me. Remember, you are not allowed to use forbidden Godfiend spells. The more barriers you break through, the better the result. The lowest requirement is twenty barriers. If you aren\u2019t able to break through twenty barriers, you will be eliminated. Let\u2019s begin.\u201d The sloppy-looking man stood there, easily controlling the light barriers.\u201cFirst up, Dragoncloud State\u2019s Wu Chang,\u201d announced the goateed man immediately.A dark-skinned youth came forward solemnly. He drew his thick saber, took a step forward, and chopped down furiously. Instantly, a black saber beam cleaved the light barriers with a furious roar, causing the light barriers to be penetrated.\u201c37 layers. Next, Jiang State\u2019s Zhang Ping,\u201d shouted the goateed man.\u2026Each person only had one chance and could only use one move. Grievances about not performing up to mark was useless. In a life-and-death battle with demons, there were no retries.\u201c29 layers. Next, Imperial Capital\u2019s Chu Yong.\u201d This person\u2019s name attracted the attention of many people.\u201cImperial Capital\u2019s Chu Yong?\u201d Meng Chuan also paid more attention. Although he didn\u2019t know much about all the geniuses in the world, he had heard of Chu Yong. He was recognized as the number one genius of the imperial capital\u2019s younger generation. Seven years ago, his name had already spread throughout the world. He had also joined the Archean Mountain\u2019s test this year.The tall Chu Yong wore black robes and carried a large saber on his back. He immediately drew his saber, and his body was covered by black lightning. The terrifying might alarmed all the geniuses present as they felt a sense of oppression.Meng Chuan was also alarmed. The pressure this person exuded was even stronger than those demon commanders.\u201cOpen!\u201d He shouted like thunder.The saber struck the light barriers with black lightning.Boom\u2014The light barriers were instantly destroyed, leaving only a small number intact.\u201c191!\u201d shouted the goateed man loudly. The crowd was in an uproar. There were already fifty-three geniuses who had their turn. None of them tore through the hundredth layer, but Chu Yong had managed 191 layers! The difference was indeed astonishing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEveryone present stared at him.This was too shocking.Many spectating relatives were shocked as well. Only a one-eyed elder was laughing. \u201cHaha, that\u2019s my grandson. How\u2019s my grandson? Say something!\u201dWhat a powerful strike.Meng Dajiang was amazed as well. He had prided himself over his son, but the power of this strike still shocked him. This was a strike that could match a newly-advanced Godfiend. He was terrifying even without using a forbidden Godfiend spell!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - Meng Chuan's TurnPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 76: Meng Chuan\u2019s TurnCKtalonMeng Chuan was also impressed by Chu Yong. It was no wonder he was so famous. He was indeed very strong!After Chu Yong executed his slash, he calmly retracted his saber and turned around to leave. A new genius stepped forward and pierced through the 32nd layer with his sword.One by one, geniuses executed one move. Each one of them was extremely attentive whenever it was their turn to attack the light barriers.\u201cNext Yan Feng from Yuan State,\u201d shouted the goateed man.No one present really cared about him.Yan Feng was tall and handsome; he had a unique pair of blood-red eyebrows. He was a man, but had the feminine name \u201cFeng,\u201d meaning phoenix.As he held his black spear, the red tassels on its grip fluttered.\u201cBreak!\u201d Yan Feng suddenly charged forward. After three steps, he thrust his spear forward.The spear shot out like a dragon! It transformed into a wyrm that pierced through the light barriers, creating a huge hole. His result was very close to Chu Yong, causing everyone present to be shocked.\u201c182 layers!\u201d The goateed man\u2019s voice was high-pitched as he carefully observed the red-browed man.\u201cYan Feng?\u201d\u201cYuan State\u2019s Yan Feng? Where did he come from? Why is he so strong?\u201d\u201cOver 70 geniuses have attacked the light barriers, but only two\u2014Chu Yong and Yan Feng\u2014can break a hundred light barriers. The former cleaved through 191 layers, and the latter pierced through 182 layers. They are much stronger than the others.\u201d Many people were speechless.Even the Godfiends found it unbelievable.\u201cBrother Gongsun, your Yuan State was too secretive. There are very few records of this Yan Feng on Archean Mountain. He was treated as an ordinary genius,\u201d said a Godfiend with a laugh as he looked at the dossier. When they came to watch the competition, they received a dossier. It recorded every geniuses\u2019\u2014that were present\u2014information.\u201cI really didn\u2019t know.\u201d Gongsun Qi laughed as well. \u201cYou might not believe me, but according to what I know, Yan Feng is from an ordinary mortal family and not from a Godfiend family clan. When he was twelve years old, his hometown was invaded by demons, and his parents died. From then on, he wandered the world\u2026 He\u2019s nineteen this year. When he returned to his hometown, he displayed his strength and came to participate in Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination.\u201d\u201cHow can a mortal from an ordinary family produce such strength? His Godfiend body is comparable to Chu Yong\u2019s. The Chu family used eight precious treasures to nurture Chu Yong.\u201dEveryone discussed.Marquis Southcloud laughed. \u201cI remember that 3000 years ago, Godfiend Kou Cheng had consumed Undying Grass when he was a youth, and his eyebrows turned blood-red. Yan Feng\u2019s eyebrows are also blood-red. Could it be that he has also consumed Undying Grass?\u201d\u201cUndying Grass? A single portion of Undying Grass is indeed capable of forging an incomparably robust Godfiend foundation.\u201d King East River nodded.\u201cTo have Undying Grass directly consumed by a mortal is quite a waste. It only allows for 30% of its medicinal effects to be utilized.\u201d\u201cYan Feng\u2019s strike is quite extraordinary. He\u2019s already reached the peak of Spear Force and is only a step away from gaining insights into Spear Intent. It wouldn\u2019t be a waste for him to consume the Undying Grass.\u201d These powerful Godfiends casually commented. Most of them were Marquis Godfiends. They were here to watch the competition only because they had to escort the geniuses from their respective states.They didn\u2019t care about ordinary geniuses. They hoped that a truly peerless genius would appear and fight alongside them in the future.\u2026After Yan Feng, seven more people went up before it was finally Meng Chuan\u2019s turn.\u201c33rd layer. Next one, Wu State\u2019s Meng Chuan,\u201d the goateed man shouted. Many gazes landed on Meng Chuan.In the eyes of some people, Meng Chuan was one of the top ten youths at this year\u2019s entrance examination. There was only one well-known achievement to his name: Killing two demon commanders in a row with one strike each!Marquis Southcloud sat and watched from afar.Chuan\u2019er. Meng Dajiang watched nervously.Meng Chuan calmly walked forward.This was the Archean Mountain entrance examination, so he naturally had to go all out. Other than not using the Power of the Soul, he didn\u2019t hold back at all.I\u2019ve waited twelve years for this day.In an instant, he merged his body and mind completely.He had been pushing his limits all these years, and his meridians were extremely resilient and wide. His Quintessential Essence instantly increased fifteen-fold to the normal volume. After his Saber Force merged with his Quintessential Essence, he used some of the secrets to Five Lightning Descent. Lightning began to snake around his body and became denser as time passed.Whoosh.An aqueous saber beam lit up and cleaved through the light barriers. Following that, the saber beam disappeared, and he sheathed his saber. The drawing and sheathing of his saber happened so quickly it was as if he hadn\u2019t even moved.Strength really isn\u2019t my forte.Meng Chuan sighed inwardly and turned to leave.\u201c79 layers. Next is Archean City\u2019s Qi Chou,\u201d the goateed man shouted. A new genius came forward to attack.The Godfiends were all puzzled as they flipped through their dossiers.\u201cOnly 79 layers? Brother Southcloud, isn\u2019t it said that he killed demon commanders with a single strike? He even killed two of them in a row. He did that with such strength?\u201d asked a Godfiend.\u201cDemon commanders have tenacious bodies, and although Meng Chuan\u2019s saber art is considered not bad among human geniuses, he will take a few dozen strikes to kill a demon commander. One strike? I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not powerful enough to do that.\u201dThey had sharp eyes.\u201cHe only managed to kill two demon commanders in a row in order to save Liu Qiyue.\u201d Marquis Southcloud smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s normally not that strong.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cHe unleashed greater strength while saving others?\u201d All of the Godfiends were somewhat disappointed. They wanted to find a peerless genius among the three hundred-plus geniuses. Meng Chuan\u2014who was a promising candidate\u2014was weaker than they had expected.\u2026Soon, it was Yan Jin\u2019s turn.\u201c26 layers. Next, Wu State\u2019s Yan Jin.\u201d\u201c137 layers!\u201d A slightly high-pitched voice rang out. He was the third person who had passed 100 layers.Yan Jin also walked over.\u201cYan Jin, not bad. You\u2019re stronger than me,\u201dsaid Meng Chuan via voice transmission.\u201cBut I\u2019ve lost to you every time we spar.\u201dYan Jin\u2019s lips curled, and he stood at the end of the line.Meng Chuan still did his best for the Archean Mountain entrance examination. After all, many people had placed their hopes on him! However, he knew that his strongest point was speed due to having cultivated a lightning body. Without using the Power of the Soul, his strength was ordinary. For him to cleave through 79 barriers was a testament of his robust Godfiend foundation and his Saber Force.There were many types of Godfiend bodies. Some excelled at enhancing strength, some enhanced speed, while others enhanced one\u2019s vitality\u2026For example, Yan Jin\u2019s Godfiend foundation was on par with Meng Chuan\u2019s. His sword arts were slightly weaker than Meng Chuan\u2019s, but his strength was much greater. He had broken through 137 layers.After all, one had to accept the disadvantages that came from choosing the Lightning Divine Body.There are three segments to the preliminaries. The second segment is a test of speed. I excel when it comes to speed.Meng Chuan had to suppress his desire to unleash his full potential.One genius after another appeared.Every genius had their own expertise. This was also the reason why Archean Mountain had set a demarcating line. As long as one could break through twenty light barriers, they could continue the test.As more and more geniuses appeared, they displayed their techniques one after another, causing everyone to be even more astonished.Geniuses who could break through a hundred layers also appeared one after another.However, only three people had managed to tear through the 150th layer. They were Chu Yong, Yan Feng, and Dong Fang. Dong Fang\u2019s result of the 185th layer with his axe shocked everyone. The thirteen-year-old Yan Chitong\u2014who was known as the number one genius in Archean City\u2014had also attacked the light barriers. He pierced through the 73rd layer with his spear. It was quite amazing.\u201cLast person, Ji Yuantong of Archean City!\u201d the goateed man shouted. It was the last genius for the first segment of the assessment.Ji Yuantong was thin and small, but he held a huge hammer in each hand. His eyes were cold.\u201cJi Yuantong was previously acknowledged as the number one genius of Archean City! However, Yan Chitong had comprehended Force at the age of thirteen, and snatched the title of number one genius from him.\u201d\u201cHe amazed everyone three years ago and almost never stepped out again. It\u2019s unknown how far his cultivation has brought him.\u201d Many people were discussing him. After all, Archean City was the number one city in the Great Zhou Dynasty. To formerly hold the title of the top genius of Archean City naturally attracted people\u2019s attention. He was also one of the top ten hot favorites in this batch.Wearing a cold expression, Ji Yuantong held a hammer in each hand. When he stepped forward, he suddenly struck. As he attacked, his body glowed black. His hammer transformed into a blur as it smashed into the light barriers.The sloppy man\u2014who was in charge of controlling the light barriers\u2014had a change in expression. With a thought, new light barriers appeared behind the original two hundred barriers, totaling 300 light barrier layers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBoom!The terrifying hammer smashed through the light barriers, leaving only one barrier behind.The goateed man opened his mouth and took a deep breath before shouting, \u201c299 layers!\u201dEveryone fell silent.The other geniuses were astounded. 299 layers? There were such monsters among mortals? As for the Godfiends, their eyes lit up as they stared at Ji Yuantong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After Ji Yuantong struck out, he immediately made a deduction and increased the number of light barriers by 100! Everything was as he had expected. Ji Yuantong had only failed to strike the last layer. This precise control was something that a powerful Godfiend needed.The sloppy man flicked his sleeve, and the last light barrier disappeared as well. He turned his head and walked back to his seat. At the same time, he smiled and said, \u201cThis Ji Yuantong is not bad, right?A black-robed Godfiend beside him smiled and said, \u201cJi Yuantong\u2019s Godfiend Body is comparable to Chu Yong, Yan Feng, and Dong Fang. His Arts realm is also on par with theirs, with them being at the Force realm. However, the power he unleashed is much stronger. Despite having the same kind of body, he can produce two times their strength. He is very suitable for being a strength-type.\u201d\u201cYes, demons generally have powerful bodies. However, Ji Yuantong should be able to crush demons of the same level with his strength.\u201d\u201cOne can be very powerful once they take the strength path to the end.\u201dThe Godfiends were full of praises.Although there were hundreds of people participating in the entrance examination every year, only twenty of them were admitted. Only a few were able to light up the eyes of the Marquis and Regis Godfiends.They discovered Ji Yuantong at the preliminaries\u2019 first segment.\u2026Ji Yuantong calmly walked to the end of the line. Many geniuses looked at Ji Yuantong, each having their own thoughts.Impressive.Although Chu Yong and Yan Feng\u2019s attacks are very powerful\u2014twice as powerful as mine\u2014my saber artis much faster.This gave him the confidence to fight them head-on!However, Ji Yuantong is different. His attack power is four-fold mine. The difference is too great. Only by using the Power of the Soul can I defeat him.By using the Power of the Soul, his strength would increase tremendously, making his attacks comparable to Ji Yuantong\u2019s. His speed was also far superior to Ji Yuantong\u2019s. When he had used the Power of the Soul against the second Firmament demon monarch\u2014Poison Pool\u2014he had easily widened the gap between them. The only flaw was that the Power of the Soul drained him too quickly.Out of 311 geniuses, 12 of them managed to break through a hundred light barriers. I broke through 79, and am ranked 23rd. Yan Jin is 7th.The other geniuses had their own plans. They knew their ranking.Among geniuses, the strong became stronger. Those who were stunning in their youth could be nearly twice as strong as the other geniuses. A family clan would be willing to pay any price to forge them a strong Godfiend foundation! This could make them four times stronger than other geniuses.Ordinary geniuses who failed the entrance examination couldn\u2019t enter Archean Mountain. The stunning geniuses would become even stronger after they entered Archean Mountain thanks to their careful grooming.The gap between them would grow bigger and bigger.This was how powerful experts were. They would seize every chance to become stronger! In the end, they would have a chance of becoming a Marquis Godfiend or even a Regis Godfiend. If they were weak from a young age and were weak in every aspect\u2026 the difference in strength over time would be night and day.The path Meng Chuan chose for himself was speed. He seized every single opportunity to make himself faster! He was so fast that even the equally stunning genius, Yan Jin, had headaches when fighting him.\u2026The first segment of Archean Mountain\u2019s preliminaries ended. Friends and relatives watching from afar had different moods, but they were all watching nervously. There were still other tests.The cyan-clothed woman seated beside King East River rose to her feet.She took a few steps forward and looked at the geniuses. She calmly said, \u201cThe first segment of the entrance examination was to test one\u2019s attacking strength. There are 17 people who have failed to reach the minimum requirement. You don\u2019t need to continue with the assessment. Just go to the side and watch the competition.\u201dAs soon as she finished speaking, stewards led the eliminated geniuses to their friends and family.\u201cI\u2019m a sharpshooter. My arrows are far inferior when it comes to close combat, but my arrows are even faster. I\u2026\u201d one of the youths shouted out unhappily.Oh?The cyan-clothed woman frowned and took a look. The young man who wanted to continue speaking stopped. He immediately flew up and was thrown to where his family and friends were. The other geniuses who were eliminated didn\u2019t dare utter a sound. However, there were quite a few who felt somewhat aggrieved. They were directly eliminated without even finishing the preliminaries.\u201cArchean Mountain naturally has its reasons for setting these rules,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman calmly. \u201cOne does need to consider various factors when killing enemies. However, if an attack is too weak and you are unable to kill a demon despite them standing still in front of you, what\u2019s the point of admitting you? Breaking 20 light barriers is the lowest Archean Mountain can accept.\u201cAlthough sharpshooters\u2014who are best at killing demons\u2014shoot extremely fast arrows, arrows are much lighter than spears and hammers. They are generally less powerful. In the first assessment, only two archers were eliminated. The other sharpshooters have reached the minimum requirement. Among them, the strongest sharpshooter is called Zong Sha from the Desolate State. His arrow pierced through a total of 65 light barriers. The threat he poses towards demons is no less than Ji Yuantong.\u201cNow, the second assessment will begin\u2014speed!\u201d The cyan-clothed woman stared at the geniuses coldly. \u201cAfter becoming a Godfiend, you will encounter life-and-death battles. When you are weak, you can rely on speed to flee. When you are powerful, you can rely on speed to slay demons. Speed is an extremely important aspect of Godfiends! If you are too slow\u2014even if you are powerful\u2014you will die once you fail to escape. Once you die, everything is for naught.\u201cSpeed is almost equivalent to your lives.\u201dWhoosh!The cyan-clothed woman waved her hand.The air in the palace began to distort as the Heaven and Earth powers gathered. It formed a deep blue tunnel, shaped like an anaconda.\u201cThis winding path is 1,500 feet long.\u201d The cyan-clothed woman pointed to a large copper bucket not far away. \u201cThat\u2019s the Leaking Copper Kettle Clepsydra. It measures time through the dripping of liquid. You need to cross through the entire path within 20 droplets. The shorter the time you take, the better. Anyone who exceeds 20 droplets will be eliminated! Remember, keep your weapons on you and no forbidden Godfiend spells. Begin!\u201d\u201cFirst up, Dragoncloud State\u2019s Wu Chang,\u201d the goateed man immediately shouted.Wu Chang carried his thick saber on his back. It weighed 29 kilograms. When moving, the weapon weight affected his speed. However, Archean Mountain\u2019s rules forbade one from discarding their weapons.Boom!Wu Chang pushed his movement technique to the limits and transformed into a black shadow as he traveled down the tunnel. One moment, he was charging forward in a straight line, and the next moment, he was curving in an arc. Droplets fell from the Leaking Copper Kettle Clepsydra at very fast speeds.Whoosh.Wu Chang finally traversed the 1,500-foot curvy tunnel.\u201c19 droplets! Next Jiang State\u2019s Zhang Ping!\u201d the goateed man said.Only then did the swarthy youth, Wu Chang, heave a sigh of relief. Speed was not his forte, so he had been afraid that he wouldn\u2019t meet the minimum requirement.One genius after another entered the winding tunnel.Everyone was nervous.The faster one was, the harder it was to increase one\u2019s speed. Even if one\u2019s body was several times more powerful than an average person\u2019s, one\u2019s speed could only increase by a few dozen percent. Some people had extreme explosive strength, but they were somewhat clumsy and slow.The geniuses began to nervously calculate as they looked at the ancient Leaking Copper Kettle Clepsydra.It was almost noon, but the sky was beginning to turn gloomy. As geniuses crossed the tunnel, snow began to fall.\u201cIt\u2019s Chu Yong turn.\u201d Many people stared at Chu Yong.Chu Yong was the most famous among the top 60 geniuses.Chu Yong\u2014who was dressed in a black robe\u2014carried a large saber on his back. His entire body was covered by black water and lightning. When he transformed into a black stream of light and flew into the tunnel, his speed was clearly much faster than the others, causing many to be astonished.Whoosh.The moment Chu Yong exited the tunnel, the goateed man immediately shouted, \u201c12 droplets!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAmongst the geniuses before Chu Yong, aside from a few that exceeded 20 droplets, most of their times were between 18 to 20 droplets. This was because if one didn\u2019t have Godfiend bodies that excelled in speed, it would be very difficult for them to increase their speed. One genius\u2014who cultivated the Lightning Divine Body\u2014had attained the previous best time of 15 droplets. Chu Yong\u2019s time, however, was 12 droplets.He was 50% faster than those who passed with a time of 18 to 19 droplets. In a life-and-death battle, being slightly faster could determine one\u2019s fate, let alone being 50% faster. Being 50% faster than his peers was in no way less difficult than achieving strength that was several-fold theirs.Numerous geniuses appeared one after another. Yuan State\u2019s Yan Feng took 13 droplets of time. This was an astonishing result.\u201c20 droplets. Next, Wu State\u2019s Meng Chuan,\u201d shouted the goateed man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A cold wind blew, and snow fell on his face. It was cold to the touch. It made him feel even more excited.This was the Archean Mountain entrance examination!After years of cultivation, he was about to enter Archean Mountain and become a Godfiend! His father was watching from the side, and his clansmen were waiting for news. As for this test, it was his specialty, so he naturally had to seize this opportunity.He lifted his head and looked over to where his family was. His father, Meng Dajiang, was watching from afar. Their eyes met. Following that, Meng Chuan turned to stare at the tunnel ahead.Charge! At my fastest speed!Meng Chuan erupted with fifteen times his Quintessential Essence. After years of cultivation, his meridians were able to withstand such explosive power. He circulated his Quintessential Essence according to the secrets of Five Lightning Descent. The dense lightning in his body erupted. These all combined with his Lightning Divine Body, and he immediately charged forward like crazy, transforming into a bolt of lightning that flew into the tunnel.Every day, he would execute the Saber Drawing Stance 8000 times. He would charge forward and draw his saber the moment the arrows shot out! If he wanted to slice the arrows at a faster speed, he needed to draw his saber faster and charge faster.He charged forward at blazing speeds 8000 times a day! He continuously honed his movement techniques under a hail of arrows for an hour every day.Furthermore, Meng Chuan began this training regime before he had reached the Mortal Shedding realm\u2014which was the critical stage for the forging of a Godfiend foundation! When a normal person was growing up, the effects of training would be the best. Similarly, if one trained daily, they could run much faster. It was very normal for one to go from a skinny person to a muscular person after training hard every day.Cultivation at the Mortal Shedding realm was more important than training as a mortal during puberty.The fact that he had the Lightning Divine Body meant that he excelled in speed. The excavation of his innate potential relied on his cultivation.Meng Chuan cultivated to his limits every day, allowing his Godfiend body to grow during \u201cpuberty.\u201d His bones and muscles had developed to enhance his explosive speeds. Even if one had the same Lightning Divine Body and a robust foundation, they would be inferior to Meng Chuan\u2019s speed if they didn\u2019t cultivate that arduously on a daily basis.If one didn\u2019t push their meridians to the limits every day and persevered for years, they wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the eruption of fifteen-fold Quintessential Essence. Everything was a result of long-term cultivation. Furthermore, one had to choose the correct path.Meng Chuan had only one goal\u2014extreme speed.Boom!When he charged into the winding tunnel, the terrifying speed he displayed was obvious to the naked eye. It far exceeded all the geniuses who had their turn.When Meng Dajiang saw this, his eyes immediately turned moist with excitement. That was his son! His son\u2019s speed far exceeded the other geniuses\u2019!\u201cThis speed!\u201d\u201cToo fast!\u201dThe others were stunned.Whether it was the geniuses or those watching from the sidelines, they were all shocked. Even the proud Chu Yong, Yan Feng, Yan Chitong, Ji Yuantong, Zong Sha, and the others were stunned by what they saw.It was too fast! There wasn\u2019t even a need to count the droplets. This was something that could be seen with the naked eye. His speed far exceeded his peer\u2019s by a large margin!Fast! Faster! More speed!Meng Chuan rushed through the winding tunnel. There were straight sections and some curved areas, making the entire tunnel a winding snake.Half-way through the tunnel, Meng Chuan used his Saber Force to control his body and Quintessential Essence. He was like a saber beam that tore through the air. The goateed man couldn\u2019t help but widen his eyes as he carefully stared at the Leaking Copper Kettle Clepsydra. Droplets fell very quickly, but compared to Meng Chuan\u2019s terrifying speed, the water droplets seemed to be much slower.\u201cOh?\u201d The cyan-clothed woman\u2014who was in charge of this segment\u2014raised her eyebrows and looked at the young man who had transformed into a bolt of lightning. \u201cHe\u2019s that fast?\u201dBoom!Meng Chuan instantly rushed out of the tunnel.The goateed man was constantly paying attention to the Leaking Copper Kettle Clepsydra. When he saw him exit, he immediately shouted, \u201c7 droplets!\u201dThe geniuses were all dumbfounded. Although they were all proud and confident people, they still felt pressured when they saw his terrifying speed.He\u2019s that fast?Chu Yong\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. He had a powerful Godfiend foundation, but it took him 12 droplets to pass through the entire tunnel. Meng Chuan only spent 7 droplets of time.He\u2019s 70% faster than me?It was still okay if he was just 10% faster. But 70%? If they really fought, his opponent would have the upper hand.This is Meng Chuan\u2019s speed. I cultivate the Yin-Yang Icefire Sword Technique, and dual wield, but I\u2019m still completely suppressed by Meng Chuan.Yan Jin was very calm. He was the most familiar with Meng Chuan amongst the geniuses present. During their half-year stay at Wu State Guild Hall, they had often sparred with each other. He knew how terrifying Meng Chuan\u2019s speed was.If Meng Chuan could completely suppress him, he could obviously suppress the other geniuses.As long as I hit him with a hammer, he will definitely be defeated. However, this speed is a little too fast.Ji Yuantong frowned slightly as well. Meng Chuan had pressured him.\u2026\u201cBrother Meng, congratulations. Your son is truly impressive. His speed is invincible among mortals, right?\u201d\u201cBrother Meng, with such speed, I believe he will definitely enter Archean Mountain.\u201d Many people around Meng Dajiang congratulated him. When Meng Dajiang was with the large group of people, he had been proud to show off his son with shouts like \u201ctake a look, that\u2019s my son.\u201d However, no one paid much attention to him in the past. But Meng Chuan\u2019s performance in the second segment of the entrance examination had completely shocked everyone.Speed was very important. As long as one was fast enough, an attack wouldn\u2019t be too weak. But to ensure that his saber moved at peak speed, his saber couldn\u2019t be too heavy. His saber was in the shape of a cross blade, and the blade was extremely narrow. His saber weighed only 2.6 kilograms. For someone who cultivated the swift saber or fast sword, their weapons had to be fairly light. It was impossible to attain the advantages of the swift saber style with a thick, broad saber.The saber he carried was light, and he could push himself to faster speeds.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s still the preliminaries. It\u2019s hard to say if he will be admitted into Archean Mountain or what ranking he will get.\u201d Meng Dajiang laughed.\u201cI heard that the top three in the final ranking will be heavily rewarded by Archean Mountain. Meng Chuan might be able to enter the top three in the assessment.\u201d Everybody began speaking to him, attempting to build connections with him. The vast majority of the crowd knew that the chances of their child being admitted were very low, but it already seemed like it was certain for Meng Chuan to be admitted. Naturally, many of them were willing to befriend Meng Chuan\u2019s father, Meng Dajiang.This was how relationships between Godfiend families were forged. The more powerful a family was, the more connections they had.\u201cWhat amazing speed.\u201d\u201cHis speed is comparable to an ordinary Indestructible realm Godfiend\u2019s speed.\u201d\u201cFor a mortal to actually have the speed of an Indestructible Godfiend. How astonishing.\u201dMany of the Godfiends were astounded as well. Their eyes lit up. They had discovered a good sapling, Ji Yuantong, during the first segment. Now, they had discovered Meng Chuan during the second segment.A Core Cloud Godfiend was a newly-advanced Godfiend. Indestructible Godfiends were second Firmament Godfiends, on par with second Firmament demon monarchs.\u201cIf I remember correctly, the fastest person at last year\u2019s Archean Mountain entrance examination managed to traverse the tunnel within nine droplets,\u201d said a black-robed Godfiend with a laugh. \u201cHe was also a genius who cultivated the Lightning Divine Body. From the looks of it, Meng Chuan\u2019s speed is thirty percent faster than his. Despite being the same Lightning Divine Body, he\u2019s 30% faster!\u201d\u201cI was here last year,\u201d said Marquis Southcloud with a smile. \u201cThe kid last year had a Godfiend body foundation in no way inferior to Meng Chuan\u2019s. However, his Lightning Divine Body is somewhat different from Meng Chuan\u2019s. Meng Chuan is more suited for bursts of speed. Meng Chuan clearly goes through more arduous cultivation that is more effective.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Many of the other Godfiends agreed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFurthermore, the eruption of his Quintessential Essence is extremely ferocious, much more ferocious than most geniuses, but his meridians are able to withstand it,\u201d Marquis Southcloud continued. As a Marquis Godfiend, he could see the power unleashed by Meng Chuan. \u201cHe managed to excavate a fair amount of his potential. In addition, his realm is also higher; He has already reached the peak of Saber Force, only one step away from Saber Intent. All these factors contribute to him being 30% faster than last year\u2019s fastest.\u201d\u201cSouthcloud, are you flattering him because he\u2019s from Wu State?\u201d Marquis West Sea quipped.\u201cAm I exaggerating in the slightest?\u201d Marquis Southcloud glanced at the nearby Godfiends. \u201cI am speaking the truth.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d The other Godfiends laughed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His speed was comparable to Chu Yong\u2019s\u2014an excellent result. In truth, Yan Jin cultivated the Icefire Divine Body, and his Godfiend foundation was robust. His speed far exceeded ordinary Core Condensation experts. It was only because he had sparred with Meng Chuan many times that he had been suppressed so badly.\u201cI\u2019m still a lot slower,\u201dsaid Yan Jin via voice transmission to Meng Chuan when he returned to the group.\u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, I won\u2019t be able to enter the top ten.\u201dAlthough Yan Jin was a solitary person, he often talked to Meng Chuan.\u201cYou should enter the top ten,\u201dsaid Meng Chuan.\u201cMany people who cultivate the Lightning Divine Body and Wind Divine Body excel when it comes to speed. Many haven\u2019t had their turns yet,\u201dsaid Yan Jin.\u201cMost of them have lacking Godfiend foundations. They can\u2019t compare to you,\u201dconsoled Meng Chuan.For example, a genius who cultivated a Lightning Divine Body but had an average Godfiend foundation might take 15 droplets to cross the entire tunnel. This showed how important a Godfiend\u2019s foundation was! Meng Chuan, Yan Jin, Chu Yong, Yan Feng, Ji Yuantong, and Zong Sha had Godfiend foundations that were three times more robust than the average. This was roughly the limit. Even if they used ten times the amount of natural treasures, their Godfiend foundation would only increase from three times the average to four times the average. It was not worth it.It was already rare for Meng Chuan\u2014who came from an ordinary Godfiend family clan\u2014to have a Godfiend foundation that was comparable to a top Godfiend family clan genius.\u2026Time passed.The geniuses took their turns. It was finally time for the two sharpshooters who caught everyone\u2019s attention.The number one archer in the imperial capital\u2019s younger generation\u2014the imperial princess, Li Ying, and the most outstanding archer during the first assessment, Zong Sha.\u201c19 droplets. Next, Imperial Capital\u2019s Li Ying,\u201d said the goateed man loudly.The princess of the Great Zhou Dynasty, Li Ying, took her place. She was dressed in purple and carried a natural air of nobility. In terms of family background, she stood a little higher than the typical scions of Regis Godfiends.At least within the Great Zhou Dynasty, the imperial Li family was still the number one Godfiend family clan.Swoosh!Princess Li Ying carried her bow and arrows as she transformed into a gust of wind. She passed through the tunnel with tremendous speed. Although she couldn\u2019t catch up to the monstrous Meng Chuan, she surpassed the geniuses that had gone earlier.Soon, she traversed the entire tunnel.\u201c10 droplets!\u201d The goateed man\u2019s announcement of the final result made many geniuses sigh in amazement. It was likewise for their relatives and friends. \u201cSharpshooters are going to shine. Sharpshooters tend to be faster.\u201dAfter the imperial princess, it was Zong Sha\u2019s turn after a few people in between.\u201c17 droplets. Next, Desolate State\u2019s Zong Sha.\u201dZong Sha was an ordinary-looking youth. With a bow and arrow quiver on his back, he also transformed into a gust of wind. However, his speed seemed to be faster than Princess Li Ying.\u201cHe\u2019s like me. He cultivates a Wind Divine Body and has a very deep Godfiend foundation.\u201d Princess Li Ying watched and frowned. \u201cHowever, his realm is higher than mine. He has already reached the peak of Force! He was slightly better than me in the first assessment, and his speed is greater than mine.\u201d\u201cNine droplets!\u201d The goateed man\u2019s voice rose a few decibels. Over 120 geniuses had had their turns. He was the only one who managed to go below ten droplets other than Meng Chuan.Zong Sha returned to the group calmly.\u2026It was very difficult to pass through the entire tunnel within ten droplets. After Zong Sha\u2019s 9 droplets, Jiang State\u2019s genius\u2014Ning Yibo\u2014transformed into a stream of light and passed through the entire tunnel. He took 9 droplets and matched Zong Sha.After more than two hundred people had their turns, another stunning genius appeared.\u201cSo fast.\u201d\u201cThis speed!\u201dThis was a black-robed youth carrying a short spear. He had completely transformed into a bolt of lightning. He, too, cultivated the Lightning Divine Body and had also reached the pinnacle of the Force realm. His speed left everyone speechless.Swoosh.When he finally exited, the goateed man finally shouted the result. \u201c8 droplets!\u201dOh?The black-robed youth frowned when he heard that.I cultivate the Lightning Divine Body, and I arduously cultivate my movement technique and flying saber techniques daily. I\u2019ve also reached the peak of Force. My family also spent five precious treasures on me. My greatest speed\u2026 is actually slower than Meng Chuan\u2019s?Cloud State\u2019s Jin Huan?Meng Chuan memorized the black-robed youth\u2019s name.Amongst the younger generation, his speed is actually close to mine.He was faster than him by only ten percent.\u2026\u201cCloud State\u2019s Jin Huan has pretty good speed. If this were last year\u2019s entrance examination, he would\u2019ve been the fastest.\u201d A Godfiend sighed.\u201cHis eruption of Quintessential Essence is inferior to Meng Chuan\u2019s!\u201d The sloppy man smiled. \u201cFor a split second, Meng Chuan erupts with twice Jin Huan\u2019s erupted Quintessential Essence. Meng Chuan must have trained his meridians for a long time to release so much Quintessential Essence. In addition, Meng Chuan\u2019s control over his body and Quintessential Essence is more refined. Only by combining these factors can his speed be much higher than Jin Huan\u2019s!\u201d\u201cMeng Chuan\u2019s Quintessential Essence circulation method is indeed exquisite. It\u2019s not inferior to some of the Godfiend legacies in our Archean Mountain.\u201d\u201cHe might have obtained some incomplete legacy.\u201dThe vast majority of those present were Marquis Godfiends; there was also a Regis Godfiend! They could discern the profundity behind Meng Chuan\u2019s Quintessential Essence circulation method.It was a part of the Lightning Devastator Saber\u2019s Five Lightning Descent. It only had this effect when fifteen times the normal amount of Quintessential Essence was unleashed. He was only ten percent faster than Jin Huan. Of course, the speed advantage was already huge!\u2026After Cloud State\u2019s Jin Huan, no one managed to traverse the tunnel within ten droplets.\u201cLastly, Ji Yuantong of Archean City,\u201d said the goateed man loudly.Everyone turned to look.Meng Dajiang also carefully stared at the thin youth. Ji Yuantong had been too dazzling during the first segment. He had far exceeded his peers.Boom!Ji Yuantong carried the two heavy hammers on his back and transformed into a black beam of light as he moved. The ground trembled slightly when he moved. Every step he took was very domineering. He quickly rushed out from the exit.\u201c10 droplets!\u201d shouted the goateed man loudly. This time, he was much calmer. Although passing through the tunnel within ten droplets was outstanding, even the imperial princess had taken ten droplets to pass. However, considering Ji Yuantong\u2019s halo, it was an expected result.Meng Chuan nodded slightly as well.Those two hammers are probably a few hundred kilograms. If he discards the hammers, his speed will be greater. He will probably finish within nine droplets! However, an expert can\u2019t discard their weapons easily. Ji Yuantong\u2019s strength would halve without his two heavy hammers.Therefore, Archean Mountain decided on a rule\u2014one had to carry their weapons as they traversed the tunnel.As Ji Yuantong returned to the group, the second segment was over. There were only four people who managed a result of fewer than 10 droplets.Jiang State\u2019s Ning Yibo and Desolate State\u2019s Zong Sha managed 9 droplets. Cloud State\u2019s Jin Huan managed 8 droplets, and Wu State\u2019s Meng Chuan managed 7 droplets. Meng Chuan\u2019s speed placed him in the top three fastest in Archean Mountain\u2019s last 20 entrance examinations. The might of Ji Yuantong\u2019s hammer placed him in the top three in the past twenty years as well. This year was definitely a standout year for Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examinations.The higher the standards, the more difficult it would be to obtain the admission spots.Whoosh.The cyan-clothed woman stood there. With a wave of her hand, the massive tunnel dissipated. She coldly swept her gaze across the group of geniuses and said, \u201cThe 19 people who took over twenty droplets of time are eliminated. You can go to the side to spectate.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe cold wind continued to blow as snow fell on every person.The 19 eliminated geniuses found the wind bone-piercing. The snow was cold, but their hearts were even colder. If they couldn\u2019t enter Archean Mountain, they would have to head to the battlefield to serve in the military. They had to work hard to accumulate credit so they could enter the Godfiend Blood Pool. Most of them would perish while accumulating credit. They wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to enter the Godfiend Blood Pool.Fairy Meng was the only person among her peers who had managed to enter the Godfiend Blood Pool. She was the only one who had become a Godfiend in her group of geniuses.The geniuses silently walked towards their friends and family\u2014who sighed as they watched.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - Third AssessmentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80: Third AssessmentCKtalonMeng Chuan and the others calmly watched this scene. After all, there were still a total of 275 people in the examination! Ultimately, there were only 20 spots up for grabs. The truly brutal fight had yet to begin.According to the books, to become a Godfiend, one needs to enter the Godfiend Blood Pool and undergo the Life-and-Death juncture. Every Godfiend requires a lot of the Godfiend Blood Pool\u2019s powers. Archean Mountain disciples have to be 100% certain before they are allowed to undergo the Life-and-Death juncture. Those who fail to enter Archean Mountain have to accumulate credits and exchange them for a chance to enter the Godfiend Blood Pool.Meng Chuan sighed.The Godfiend Blood Pool was too precious. Only Archean Mountain, Black Sand Grotto-Heaven, and Two World Island had control of it. The three supreme sects recruited very few disciples every year.\u2026The cyan-clothed woman turned her head and walked towards the Godfiends. She sat down and whispered to King East River, \u201cElder, I\u2019ll leave the rest to you.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d King East River nodded slightly before standing up. The moment he stood up, the entire world rumbled, and the sky darkened.\u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201dMeng Chuan, the geniuses, and the spectators didn\u2019t dare look at King East River. It was just like how mortals found it difficult to look straight at the sun! Even the newly-advanced Godfiends among the spectators couldn\u2019t look straight at King East River. King East River no longer restrained his aura, instead, it began to emanate from him in waves. His aura caused one\u2019s lifeblood to turn chaotic. It was normal to meet a violent death if they were exposed to the aura for too long.This was a Regis Godfiend that stood at the pinnacle of the human world! The mere mention of them could change the expressions of demon monarchs.King East River and King Calm Sea were both at the same level.Meng Chuan and the others didn\u2019t dare to look at him directly, but they could hear his voice.\u201cWe\u2019ll now begin the third segment. I\u2019ll preside over it.\u201d King East River\u2019s voice was calm but had an invisible and oppressive weight to it. \u201cIn a life-and-death battle, every move can spell the difference between life and death. If you act a little slower, you might die a violent death. Therefore, your reaction speed must be fast.\u201cThe third assessment tests your reaction speed. The faster, the better,\u201d said King East River.Meng Chuan agreed when he heard that. He had heard from his grandaunt that Jadesun Palace Lord didn\u2019t give the three demon monarchs a chance to attack when he faced them. This was what experts were like. They didn\u2019t give their opponents chances to attack them.Just like how he cultivated the Saber Drawing Stance. Speed was one aspect to the Saber Drawing Stance. Another aspect was to use psychological tactics. The opponent would be caught off guard when facing this strike! If the opponent was caught off guard, one\u2019s reaction speed would mean the difference between life and death. It wasn\u2019t easy for Archean Mountain to nurture Godfiends; therefore, they had extremely strict requirements concerning Godfiend reaction speeds.\u201cHuh?\u201dMeng Chuan suddenly felt an irresistible force envelop him before lifting him up. He saw all the geniuses fly up as well. All of them were somewhat astonished.275 people flew up into the air and were scattered forcefully. They landed in the palace compound, about twenty feet away from each other. They stood on top of a stone slab\u2014a circle ten feet wide was carved on the stone slab.\u201cAll of you are in your respective circles. None of you can exit the circle in any way,\u201d continued King East River. \u201cThere will be hail falling from the sky. You need to avoid every piece! As long as you get hit by the hail\u2014be it your body or your weapons\u2014it will be considered as failing. Leaving the circle also counts as a failure. If you don\u2019t survive the first two rounds of hail, you will also fail. The longer you can dodge everything, the better.\u201dMeng Chuan and company looked up.In the dim sky, countless fluttering snowflakes began to gather suddenly. They gathered in midair, forming a dense cluster of icy hail particles that were as large as fingers. The hailstone shards were only 150 feet above them. This was the height of the tallest building in Archean City.All the geniuses nervously watched the hailstones cover the sky.They didn\u2019t dare look at King East River, but they could stare at the hail.\u201cBegin.\u201d As soon as King East River finished speaking, the hailstones shot down.Swish! Swish! Swish!Each hailstone was comparable to an arrow shot by experts at the Seamless realm. They were extremely fast. However, Meng Chuan was used to such things.For years, he had trained with volleys of arrows flying at him for an hour every day. As his strength and speed increased, he had his guards draw closer and closer to him to put himself under more pressure! Therefore, Meng Chuan forced himself to push his movement technique, reaction speed, and saber techniques to their limits, refining and improving them step-by-step.But in this assessment, movement techniques were not important! In a circle that was only ten feet wide, as long as one could react quickly, they would be able to avoid the hailstones. The key was to react in time! If they didn\u2019t react in time, they would be hit.Saber techniques were not important either! Having the weapon hit spelled failure as well. The test was for reaction speed! He had to react in time.Swish! Swish! Swish!Hailstones flew towards him. Instantly, three hailstones fell towards Meng Chuan\u2019s circle. Then, there were two more, followed by three more\u2026Meng Chuan was relaxed.The hail isn\u2019t launched all at once but split into batches. There are only two to three hailstones in each batch.Meng Chuan didn\u2019t know how much his reaction speed had improved since he had started his training regime. He pushed his limits every day! He pushed himself to the limits of what he could endure.To him, it was currently a stroll in the park. With a simple movement, two hailstones shot past him, smashed into the ground, and were reduced to powder.Not only was his reaction speed swift, but he also had his 100 foot wide perception domain\u2014that resulted from his soul\u2014aiding him. In the hundred-foot domain, the hail was extremely clear, allowing him to avoid them easily.\u2026The spectators watched from a distance nervously.They didn\u2019t dare to look at King East River. They could only stare at the geniuses and the countless hailstones in the sky. Snowflakes began fluttering in the air with increasing intensity, affecting their vision.\u201cIt\u2019s the third assessment.\u201d\u201cThere are only three segments to the preliminaries. The rankings will be decided after the preliminaries.\u201d\u201cYou must hold on.\u201d Many people watched nervously. They stared at their family clan\u2019s pride and hope.Meng Chuan was the Meng family\u2019s hope; likewise, many geniuses here were their family\u2019s hope.\u2026King East River controlled everything expressionlessly. The hail continued for quite some time before it came to an abrupt stop.\u201cNext up is the second round,\u201d King East River said calmly.The hail only stopped for a few seconds before it rained down again.It\u2019s a lot faster now.Outside his 100 foot wide perception domain, Meng Chuan could use his Force domain to determine the hailstones\u2019 vague trajectories. When they entered his 100 foot wide domain, he could clearly sense the hailstones! He easily determined that the hailstones\u2019 speed had increased by 20%. Although it was only a 20% increase, the difficulty of dodging the hailstones increased tremendously.Pfft. Pfft. Pfft.Meng Chuan could sense people around him being hit one after another! They couldn\u2019t react in time, thus, their bodies, weapons, or clothes were hit!\u201cNo\u2026\u201d A genius held a huge hammer in his hand in despair. The hammer had just been hit by a hailstone when an invisible force wrapped around him and lifted him up. It wasn\u2019t only him, the other geniuses who had failed the second round were also lifted up and sent off into the distance.\u201cYou can\u2019t even withstand the second round of hail. This reaction speed is really too slow.\u201d King East River\u2019s icy voice rang out in every geniuses\u2019 ears. \u201cIf you were to engage in a life-and-death battle, you would die easily.\u201dWhen the second round of hail ended, a total of thirty-six geniuses had been \u201clifted\u201d up and thrown far away.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euArchean Mountain had set the second round as the demarcating line because this condition could stop many geniuses in their tracks.This made the remaining geniuses heave sighs of relief.At the very least, I managed to hold out for the second round, reaching the minimum requirement.Many geniuses who had narrow escapes felt fortunate that they still had hope.Whoosh~After a slight pause, the countless hailstones floating in the sky began to rain down a third time. Archean Mountain wanted to select the truly outstanding geniuses\u2014they weren\u2019t just looking for people who could meet the minimum requirements.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The number of geniuses that were struck by hail increased.An invisible force hoisted them up and threw them towards the spectators.\u201cAlthough they have reached Archean Mountain\u2019s minimum requirements, not being able to withstand the third round means that they only have ordinary reaction speeds.\u201d\u201cUnless one is especially outstanding in other aspects, there\u2019s no value in nurturing them.\u201d The Godfiends chatted casually. Only the most outstanding geniuses were qualified to enter Archean Mountain. Ordinary geniuses would waste the Godfiend Blood Pool\u2019s powers.\u2026The third round quickly ended, and 58 geniuses were thrown out.There were still 181 geniuses standing in their circles. Meng Chuan and company waited attentively. The hail stopped for a moment before it rained down for the fourth time. Its speed had obviously increased again.Too fast.This\u2026Many geniuses had only seen the hailstones flying over. By the time their brains reacted, the hailstones had already hit them.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Many geniuses were lifted into the air. This scene caused the spectators to exclaim in shock. This was because there were simply too many people who had been eliminated in the fourth round of hail. The number of geniuses floating in the air was greater than the number of geniuses left in the circles.I\u2019ve actually managed to survive.The geniuses who remained in the circles heaved sighs of relief. Only then did they realize how few people remained standing in the circles. A total of 102 people had failed the fourth round. There were only 79 people remaining.These 79 geniuses were very outstanding. They had either consumed rare treasures and forged a robust Godfiend foundation, or they had extremely high talent and excellent reaction speed.Of course, there were very few people who had Godfiend foundations like Meng Chuan and Yan Jin. There were only about ten of them. Most of them had only consumed one or two ordinary treasures, with a few consuming a drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid. They were 50\u201380% stronger than typical geniuses. The more robust one\u2019s foundation, the stronger their Godfiend bodies were. They naturally had an advantage in terms of reaction speed.Whoosh.King East River stood there, staring coldly at everything. With a thought, the hail began falling for the fifth time.Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!Countless hailstones rained down, and the 79 geniuses immediately tried their best to dodge. The spectators watching from afar were all extremely nervous. They knew very well that Archean Mountain only chose twenty people! How would they choose? It was based on the results of the comprehensive assessment. The results from the preliminaries\u2019 three segments and the final assessment were combined and used to select twenty people.Therefore, the more outstanding one was, the higher the chances of obtaining a spot. If one wasn\u2019t exceptionally outstanding, they had to excel in all aspects, making them well-rounded. Only then could they obtain a spot.\u201cSecond Young Master, you have to clear it. You have to.\u201d An elder watched nervously.My dear disciple, my dear disciple\u2026 Just a bit more. If you pass the fifth round, your chances of getting a spot will be much higher.A fat elder watched nervously.I\u2019m a useless master. I couldn\u2019t afford to buy any natural treasures for you. You have to fight for it yourself.Natural treasures that helped forge a Godfiend foundation were too precious. Without consuming any rare treasures, the disadvantage was huge. To be able to hold on until now was testimony to an individual\u2019s extreme talent.Chuan\u2019er.Meng Dajiang watched.Chuan\u2019er has fought with a second Firmament demon monarch before. He could even withstand a prolonged pursuit. His reaction speed must be very fast.Everyone watched nervously.The hail was too fast. Many geniuses were hit before they could react. They were thrown out one after another. This continued until the fifth round of hail stopped.Sigh.He didn\u2019t manage to survive this round.Many spectators sighed when their hopes failed the fifth round.He survived this round. My dear disciple survived this round.The fat elder was excited as he watched. His disciple\u2014who had never consumed any natural treasures\u2014had actually passed the fifth round.\u2026Meng Chuan looked around and saw how sparse his surroundings were. Only 23 people remained after the fifth round.For example, those with robust Godfiend foundations like Chu Yong, Yan Feng, Yan Jin, Zong Sha, and Princess Li Ying were naturally able to survive the fifth round. As for the thirteen-year-old genius, Yan Chitong, although his Godfiend foundation was robust, he was still far from the peak of the Force realm because he had only comprehended Force recently. If he failed to form a Heaven and Earth Force domain, dodging would prove to be difficult. This was reflected by his failure to pass the fifth round.\u201cThree people who passed the fifth round have never consumed any natural treasures. Their Godfiend bodies are much weaker,\u201dsaid the sloppy man with a voice transmission.\u201cTheir Godfiend bodies are so weak, but they can still react so quickly. Their talent is truly high.\u201d\u201cYes, Zuo Xiao, Shangguan Feng, and Yu Chang.\u201dThe cyan-clothed woman nodded.\u201cThese three are indeed suitable for grooming. However, they failed to establish a robust Godfiend foundation at the Mortal Shedding realm. It will be difficult for them to close the gap in the future. Let\u2019s see\u2026 if they are selected for the final assessment, and they have outstanding performance in certain areas, we can give them a spot.\u201dThe sloppy-looking man nodded.King East River and the two of them were in charge of presiding over the entrance examination. They were the ones who decided on the rankings.Godfiends with robust foundations were naturally given priority. As for these three people\u2014who had never consumed any natural treasures\u2014their passing of the fifth round had won them a chance at entering Archean Mountain. As long as they had excellent performances, it would be enough for Archean Mountain to recruit them.\u2026There were only 23 geniuses left.King East River calmly looked at the 23 youths. Although there were those who hadn\u2019t consumed rare treasures and reached this point\u2014implying their high talent\u2014what Archean Mountain wanted most were geniuses with extremely high talent and robust Godfiend foundations.Whoosh. The sixth round began and the hail rained down. The speed of the hailstones had once again increased.\u201cToo fast.\u201dImmediately, geniuses were struck one after another. The fifth round had been the limit for many of them. They could not withstand the hailstones\u2019 increased speed.Hold on.The purple-robed princess, Li Ying, struggled to hold on. She could vaguely sense geniuses being hit by hail. She tried her best to survive the sixth round. Although she was an imperial princess with extremely high status, the competition within the imperial family was equally intense\u2026 As the number one Godfiend family clan in the Great Zhou Dynasty, her status as princess didn\u2019t mean much. Her strength was more important.A princess that had yet to reach the Godfiend realm wasn\u2019t of value to the imperial family.Swish!The hail became faster and increasingly difficult to dodge. Finally, a hailstone brushed past her quiver. Her expression changed immediately. As a true expert, she had great control over her body. Having a hailstone touch her quiver meant failure.An invisible force enveloped her, and she began to levitate. She knew that she had failed to survive this round. She looked around and saw that there were still 7 geniuses holding on. She heaved a sigh of relief.I still have a high chance of being in the chosen twenty.Not good.Jin Huan\u2019s body flashed with lightning as he tried his best to dodge again and again. The speedy hailstones finally exceeded his reaction speed.Jin Huan was also enveloped by an invisible force and floated up. He looked around him.There were six geniuses remaining.Duck!Yan Jin was dodging with all his might. He cultivated the Icefire Divine Body, and he was good at close combat. In melee combat, there was a fine line between life and death! Normally, he could use both swords to fight the enemy, but now, he could only dodge. He tried his best to rely on his instincts and dodge the falling hailstones. As the hail was too fast, he could only rely on his instincts.Pfft.An icy hailstone brushed past Yan Jin\u2019s back. His face turned pale\u2014he had also failed.He, too, was enveloped by an invisible force as he floated up.When Yan Jin flew up, he saw Chu Yong and Yan Feng floating as well. They had also failed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026When the hail stopped, there were only three people left standing\u2014Meng Chuan, Zong Sha, and Ji Yuantong.The other geniuses looked at them with mixed emotions as everyone stared at the remaining three.\u201cGood.\u201d A smile finally appeared on King East River\u2019s face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only when Meng Chuan, Zong Sha, and Ji Yuantong managed to survive six rounds of hail could they satisfy him.\u201cIf they can survive six rounds, the three of them will definitely rank in the top ten,\u201dthe sloppy-looking man said via voice transmission.\u201cWho do you think will be ranked first among the three?\u201d\u201cJi Yuantong gives me special vibes,\u201dsaid the cyan-clothed woman.\u201cMy bets are on him.\u201d\u201cI think most highly of him as well. His performance in the first two segments was pretty good. It also looked like it was easy for him to dodge the hail,\u201dpraised the sloppy man.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s at his limit yet. However, Zong Sha and Meng Chuan aren\u2019t to be dismissed as well. Zong Sha is a sharpshooter, so he has a limitless future. Meng Chuan is extremely fast. I believe he can live for a long time. There\u2019s hope for everything if he has a long life.\u201dThey were in a good mood seeing outstanding geniuses. Archean Mountain\u2019s goal was to choose the most outstanding geniuses for grooming.\u2026There are only three left.Ardor and zeal coursed through Meng Dajiang\u2019s blood.Regardless of what happens, Meng Chuan will definitely be in the top three for the third segment.Meng Dajiang was already very satisfied.After all, all the geniuses of the Great Zhou Dynasty were gathered here! What more could a father ask for, after seeing what his son had accomplished?In his mind, the thought of his son coming first in the entrance examination at Archean Mountain\u2014allowing him to be well-nurtured by Archean Mountain\u2014surfaced. However, it was a fleeting thought. Firstly, he didn\u2019t wish to put too much pressure on his son. Secondly, the natural treasures the geniuses from the ancient Godfiend family clans had consumed were in no way inferior to what they had given Meng Chuan. They also received the guidance of powerful Godfiends. Their training environments were much better than Meng Chuan\u2019s.It\u2019s already very good.Meng Dajiang looked on happily, and his eyes moistened.I\u2019ll be very satisfied if he can enter Archean Mountain.\u2026Everyone stared at Meng Chuan, Zong Sha, and Ji Yuantong.King East River smiled. Many hailstones floated in the air, and a number of them began to fall at even greater speeds.Meng Chuan, Zong Sha, and Ji Yuantong were fully focused. Within their ten-foot-wide circles, they dodged the high-speed hail. The hailstones were virtually phantoms as they fell from 150 feet high. The distance was too short! The speed was too high!Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Zong Sha was ordinary and unremarkable, but he was the strongest sharpshooter at the Archean Mountain entrance examination. He cultivated the Wind Divine Body. He could sense the \u201cwind\u2019s breathing.\u201d With every incoming hailstone, he could discern their trajectories. He dodged them accordingly to what he had perceived! It was too difficult to detect the fast hailstones with the naked eye due to the short distance between them and the falling hail. He had to rely on his perception to dodge them.Only then did he reach the seventh round. However, the hail had reached an even faster speed. He could sense the hailstones with the wind\u2019s breathing, but the hailstones were too close to him by the time he could react.He dodged five hailstones in a harrowing manner, but the sixth hailstone hit his abdomen before he could dodge it.I still failed.Zong Sha sighed softly.He was enveloped by an invisible force as he flew up. When he flew up, he looked in two directions. Meng Chuan and Ji Yuantong were still dodging.Their movement styles were different. Meng Chuan moved agilely and naturally, while Ji Yuantong was dodging with his eyes closed.In the blink of an eye, the seventh round ended. Zong Sha was eliminated, while Meng Chuan and Ji Yuantong survived.What monsters. We only survived the fifth round.Meng Chuan and Ji Yuantong actually managed to survive the seventh round.Princess Li Ying was somewhat shocked. The hailstones were so fast that it made her heart tremble. However, the duo could still dodge them. Such reaction speeds were inconceivable.That amazing?Chu Yong was silent. As the number one genius in the imperial capital, his name had been heard throughout the world seven years ago. He originally thought that he would dominate the test, but he never expected that he would be crushed in all aspects. He was clearly one level inferior to Meng Chuan and Ji Yuantong. When all aspects were considered, even Zong Sha was more outstanding than him. Zong Sha\u2019s results in the second and third segments were even better than Chu Yong\u2019s.As for the first segment, although Chu Yong\u2019s attacks were mighty, Zong Sha was a sharpshooter. His arrows were extremely fast, bringing his threat level to Ji Yuantong\u2019s level.Chu Yong knew that he should be ranked second. Yan Feng and Yan Jin were comparable to him.There\u2019s always someone stronger than you.Chu Yong\u2019s heart was filled with complicated emotions.I\u2019m still so far from him.Yan Jin was very calm when he saw this scene. He had treated his father as his goal and had always felt the huge gap between them. His good friend, Meng Chuan, had suppressed him, and he had been chasing after him all this while! He chased after Meng Chuan and his father, King Calm Sea.He had patience, and he would continue chasing after them.\u2026\u201cThese two actually managed to come this far. They have very high spiritual perception.\u201d The group of powerful Godfiends felt rather surprised.\u201cThey aren\u2019t even Godfiends yet, but their spiritual perception is so strong! It seems like they were born with extraordinary spiritual perception.\u201d\u201cThey are worth nurturing.\u201dThese Marquis Godfiends\u2014who usually guarded the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s various states\u2014watched Meng Chuan and Ji Yuantong with appreciation.On the surface, the third segment of the preliminaries was a reaction speed test. However, what it truly tested was the geniuses\u2019 spiritual perception! It was one of the most important qualities they tested for during the preliminaries, and it required King East River to preside over the third segment personally.Meng Chuan and Ji Yuantong glanced at each other. The competition was between them now.\u201cIn the eighth round, the two of you have to survive. The longer you survive, the better,\u201d advised King East River. Following that, the icy hail in the sky rained down again.Swish! Swish! Swish!Every hailstone was faster than the last.Ji Yuantong\u2014who was extremely confident\u2014began to struggle. He closed his eyes, and his perception of his surroundings became clearer. He could vaguely sense the hailstones coming towards him.He dodged through pure instinct. However, with the ever-increasing speed of the hailstones, he soon reached his limit.Pu!A hailstone finally smashed into his shoulder. He failed to dodge it. When he opened his eyes, he was enveloped by an invisible force and began floating up. He saw Meng Chuan still dodging the hail crazily in the distance.He\u2019s better than me?Ji Yuantong frowned. He had had a supercilious attitude towards his peers since he was young. However, he wasn\u2019t willing to flaunt his prowess. He had already crushed the so-called geniuses from Archean City long ago. When he had revealed a portion of his skill, he was deemed as Archean City\u2019s number one genius. He didn\u2019t take it to heart when the thirteen-year-old Yan Chitong comprehended Force. He believed that Yan Chitong wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up to him.After all, no one had ever managed to catch up to him. He kept becoming stronger because he wanted to shock everyone at the Archean Mountain entrance examination!It was fine if he usually kept a low profile, but he had to display all his prowess at Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination. Only then would Archean Mountain give him the best nurturing. However, he had never expected someone to surpass him in the second and third segments of the preliminaries.Wu State\u2019s Meng Chuan? It\u2019s said that he\u2019s part of a Godfiend family clan in a remote area of Wu State. As he thought about this, the hail stopped.Meng Chuan\u2014who was dressed in a navy blue robe and had a saber by his waist\u2014continued standing in his circle silently.He passed?Ji Yuantong landed on the ground and watched from afar.\u201cMeng Chuan passed the eighth round. He\u2019s the only one!\u201d Everyone watched.\u201cChuan\u2019er!\u201d Meng Dajiang looked at Meng Chuan standing by his lonesome. Some distance away in front of Meng Chuan stood King East River.This scene made Meng Dajiang extremely proud. That was his son!\u2026\u201cHe managed to dodge all of that? His spiritual perception is extraordinary.\u201d\u201cHis natural spiritual perception is extremely high.\u201dThe Godfiends also observed carefully. They were also very curious. Meng Chuan was the last man standing. How much longer could he last?\u201cVery good.\u201d King East River smiled at Meng Chuan. \u201cHold on. The longer you can last, the better. I\u2019ll begin the ninth round.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.He understood this logic. He had to use all his strength at the Archean Mountain entrance examination to showcase himself fully. The only exception was the glabella space\u2014it was too unique. Even Fairy Meng\u2014who had been a Godfiend for nearly eighty years and had a bunch of Godfiend friends while serving under King Calm Sea\u2014had never heard of the glabella space. This both delighted and worried her.It was either a fortuitous opportunity or a calamity. Therefore, he had to investigate the glabella space discretely before deciding if he wanted to announce its existence. Meng Chuan naturally listened to Fairy Meng. His grandaunt wouldn\u2019t harm him.Persevere. Persevere to the end.Meng Chuan\u2019s Saber Force domain allowed him to sense the hailstones, likewise for his hundred-foot perception domain. His Saber Force domain gave blurry images, and his hundred-foot domain gave him an extremely clear view.Dodge, duck!Meng Chuan dodged very gracefully. He had been following his training regime for a long time and was used to dodging.As time passed, the spectating Godfiends\u2019 expressions turned solemn.\u201cWhat?\u201dSwoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!The sloppy-looking man and the cyan-clothed woman arrived beside King East River.\u201cThe ninth round hasn\u2019t forced him to his limits yet,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman in surprise.\u201cNot at all.\u201d King East River stared at Meng Chuan, his eyes shining.\u201cIs his spiritual perception that powerful?\u201d The sloppy-looking man couldn\u2019t believe it.Phew, the hail stopped.Meng Chuan continued standing in his circle after surviving the ninth round of hail.\u201cJi Yuantong only survived the seventh round, but Meng Chuan has already passed the ninth round!\u201d The sloppy man couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cJi Yuantong is already very impressive. But he\u2019s so much better than Ji Yuantong?\u201d\u201cHis spiritual perception is so sharp that it\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman softly. \u201cWith such a strong spiritual perception, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult for him to condense an Essence Soul in the future, right?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euKing East River\u2019s smile became even more radiant. He stared at Meng Chuan and said loudly, \u201cMeng Chuan, continue to persevere. The longer you hold on, the better. I\u2019ll begin the tenth round now.\u201dWith that said, the hail began falling at high speeds\u2014its speed rising to new heights once again.The tenth round began!Marquis Southcloud, Marquis West Sea, and the other Marquis Godfiends carefully watched Meng Chuan as though they were looking at a peerless treasure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The three Godfiends in charge of presiding over the examination were staring at Meng Chuan. This showed how much attention they paid to him.A lone figure!His son had now surpassed all the geniuses. Even the extremely talented Ji Yuantong had only passed the seventh round, while his son was already dodging the tenth round of hail. Meng Dajiang could sense the geniuses\u2019 envy and jealousy as they stared at Meng Chuan.Chuan\u2019er.Meng Dajiang felt even prouder.Nianyun, our son is really outstanding. He will definitely enter the Archean Mountain and obtain the best nurturing.Meng Dajiang\u2019s blood boiled as he watched from the side. He was even more excited than his son\u2014who was undergoing the assessment.\u2026As the Godfiends watched, the geniuses also stared at Meng Chuan with mixed emotions.The segment\u2019s tenth round continued. The hailstones were terrifyingly fast. Meng Chuan had transformed into a blurry phantom completely. Every time he moved, the hailstones would appear to pass through his \u201cbody,\u201d but in reality, none of them hit him.When the hailstones stopped, Meng Chuan remained in the circle.He passed the tenth round as well?Ji Yuantong, Zong Sha, Chu Yong, Yan Feng, Jin Xin, Yan Chitong, Li Ying, and the other geniuses were all dazed. The gap between them was ridiculously huge, and they only had disbelief in their hearts!So Meng Chuan is that powerful.Yan Jin stared at the solitary figure carefully.\u201cContinue!\u201d King East River\u2019s voice was filled with anticipation. His eyes were filled with fervor as the hail rained down at elevated speeds. Although the hail seemed to hit Meng Chuan, in actuality, they only pierced through his afterimages.This scene left the other geniuses somewhat numb. The difference was ridiculous.Pfft!Suddenly, a hailstone turned to powder when it hit an afterimage. Meng Chuan stopped, and the hail came to a halt.Everyone knew that he had failed.After dodging several hailstones in the eleventh round, Meng Chuan ultimately failed. However, his results still left the geniuses speechless.\u201cHis spiritual perception is indeed incredible,\u201d said King East River with a smile. He said to the sloppy man and the cyan-clothed woman, \u201cJi Yuantong\u2019s spiritual perception is very strong, but such quality can be found once every few years. However, Meng Chuan\u2019s spiritual perception can only be found once every few centuries. His spiritual perception will definitely make it very easy for him to condense an Essence Soul. His potential is extremely great, but what\u2019s crucial is to nurture him well.\u201d\u201cHe still needs to achieve Saber Intent and Saber Soul\u2026 He needs to cultivate step by step.\u201d The sloppy man nodded as well. \u201cNothing can be accomplished with a single step. No matter how talented he is, it\u2019s useless if he doesn\u2019t focus on cultivation.\u201d\u201cA peerless piece of unpolished jade has arrived at our Archean Mountain. It is our duty to nurture him well,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman with a smile.\u201cYes.\u201d King East River nodded.The trio\u2019s aura fluctuations were something the mortals didn\u2019t dare to look at. Their voices were cut off from any outsiders.\u2026Meng Chuan stood still dazedly.I still couldn\u2019t dodge that hailstone. My body is still too slow.Unbeknownst to Meng Chuan, when a genius avoided the hail, they would first see with their eyes, or use their Force domain to sense the hailstones. The information would then be transmitted to the brain. This transmission required very little time. The feedback from the brain also needed time to be transmitted to the body.There were three stages for reacting to a stimulus: acquisition, thought, and instruction.As for Meng Chuan, his hundred-foot domain was actually the result of the 'soul\u201d in his glabella space directly sensing something. His soul would 'see\u201d everything. After sighting, the soul would think and react.Therefore, Meng Chuan skipped the process of transmitting information to the brain. He 'saw\u201d with the soul directly, and his soul did the thinking. This was much faster than using his brain to think!The only thing that remained the same was the fact the brain commanded the body. This was the same as the other geniuses. If Meng Chuan fused the Power of the Soul with his entire body, then the commanding of the body would be done through the Power of the Soul. That made it much faster! He would\u2019ve probably reached the fifteenth round if he did so!However, he didn\u2019t use the Power of the Soul. Just relying on the uniqueness of the 'soul\u201d in his glabella space, Meng Chuan managed to pass the tenth round, though he failed the eleventh round.\u201cMeng Chuan.\u201d King East River\u2019s voice rang out. \u201cWell done.\u201dUpon hearing the praise, Meng Chuan couldn\u2019t help but feel delighted.King East River turned and left.The sloppy-looking man smiled and said loudly, \u201cThe preliminaries have ended. All of you can take a break. According to the results of the preliminaries, Archean Mountain will decide on the hundred participants that will participate in the final selection tomorrow. Those who are not in the top 100 are eliminated.\u201dWith that said, he and the cyan-clothed woman turned and left. However, when they left, they took another look at Meng Chuan.\u201cHaha.\u201d The group of Marquis Godfiends\u2014who had been watching the preliminaries\u2014also stood up and left.\u201cMeng Chuan, well done.\u201dA familiar voice sounded in his ears. Meng Chuan looked up and saw Marquis Southcloud smiling at him from afar before he left with the other Godfiends.Meng Chuan stood alone in his circle.\u201cYoung Master Meng, please follow me.\u201d Immediately, a steward from Blazing Sun Palace came to guide him.Meng Chuan nodded.Soon, he arrived in a hall. There were dozens of geniuses, and their family and friends present. The moment Meng Chuan arrived, he immediately attracted the attention of many.\u201cChuan\u2019er.\u201d Meng Dajiang welcomed him.\u201cDad.\u201d Meng Chuan smiled.\u201cWell done.\u201d Meng Dajiang patted Meng Chuan on the shoulder. \u201cIf your grandaunt knows about this, she will definitely be very happy.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded gently. His grandaunt was still waiting for news back in their hometown.\u201cLet\u2019s wait. Archean Mountain will need time to decide the top 100,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cThis ranking is very important. It should take quite some time.\u201d\u201cYes, I wonder how high I\u2019ll rank,\u201d said Meng Chuan.\u201cBeing in the top two shouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cThe only one who can compete with you is Ji Yuantong.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded as well. \u201cI was too weak in the first assessment.\u201dMeng Chuan was ranked twenty-third in the first assessment. However, he ranked first in the second and third assessments.On the other hand, there was Ji Yuantong\u2014who had ranked number one in the first assessment, fifth for the second assessment, and second for the third assessment. It had to be said that Ji Yuantong traversed the second assessment\u2019s tunnel while carrying hammers\u2014which weighed a few hundred kilograms. His physical talent was indeed monstrous.\u201cMeng Chuan.\u201d Yan Jin walked over. The others had friends and family, but he was alone. He said, \u201cCongratulations. You will definitely be able to obtain a spot for Archean Mountain\u2019s final selection. Furthermore, you will definitely be in the top three.\u201d\u201cI hope so.\u201d Meng Chuan smiled.\u201cMeng Chuan.\u201d A clear female voice rang out.Meng Chuan turned to look.A purple-clothed woman walked over. She was the focus wherever she went. She was born with an air of nobility, and her smile could melt the hearts of others.\u201cPrincess,\u201d greeted Meng Chuan politely.\u201cI heard of your name a long time ago,\u201d said Princess Li Ying with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re far more powerful than I thought. Once we enter Archean Mountain, we must spar and see if you can avoid my arrows.\u201dAfter the first three assessments, Li Ying became confident about her chances of entering Archean Mountain. She was the second best sharpshooter among the geniuses this time. Only Zong Sha was stronger than her. Archean Mountain placed great importance on sharpshooters, so she was confident that with her strength, Archean Mountain would admit her.\u201cLet\u2019s do it when the time comes,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile.\u201cIt\u2019s a deal then.\u201d Princess Li Ying looked to the side. \u201cYoung Master Yan, your dual swords are extremely powerful. We should spar once we enter Archean Mountain.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Yan Jin responded tersely. He was willing to accept any combat opportunities. Every battle was a chance to train himself.Princess Li Ying smiled and left after exchanging a few pleasantries. She had been born in the imperial family, so she was used to socializing and befriending people who could help her. In her eyes, Meng Chuan and Yan Jin were clearly worth befriending.\u2026Time passed.Occasionally, people would come to talk to Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang! After all, everyone could tell that Meng Chuan would definitely be able to secure a spot, even if they weren\u2019t certain of the final rankings.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe sky gradually darkened as the snowstorm intensified. Everybody waited in the hall and the corridors anxiously.\u201cThe ranking has been decided!\u201d A voice sounded from afar.The goateed man held a golden scroll. Behind him were other stewards\u2014who had walked through the snowstorm.The preliminaries\u2019 rankings are out.Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan looked into the distance. They were only curious if he was ranked first or second. It was unlikely he would rank third! As for the other geniuses and their family and friends, they were much more nervous. Many geniuses were not destined to enter the top 100, destroying their chances of participating in the final selection.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ll hang this golden scroll on the wall and let everyone see it clearly.\u201d As the goateed man spoke, he walked to a wall in the corridor. He opened the golden scroll and hung it on the wall. At the same time, he laughed loudly and said, \u201cEvery person on the list will stay in Blazing Sun Palace overnight with one family member. Tomorrow morning, they will head to Archean Mountain for the final selection. As for those who aren\u2019t on the list, they may leave.\u201dSwish! Swish! Swish!Many family members and friends used their movement techniques and rushed to the wall. They carefully scanned through the names on the scroll.Some geniuses didn\u2019t care about their pride. They also used their movement techniques to rush in and take a closer look.Where\u2019s my name? Where\u2019s my name?A genius looked anxiously. He couldn\u2019t find his name on the golden scroll.Ranked 39th? That\u2019s good. At least I passed the preliminaries; I\u2019ll definitely be able to shock everyone and get a spot in the final selection.\u201cWhere\u2019s my son\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not in the top 100. Forget it.\u201d\u2026Meng Chuan and his father weren\u2019t in a hurry. They walked towards the golden scroll with Yan Jin.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We can come next year even if you didn\u2019t pass the preliminaries this year.\u201d A man\u2014that exuded old age\u2014consoled his son. \u201cYou\u2019ll be twenty next year. You still have one more chance. Don\u2019t worry. You managed to reach the minimum requirement of all three assessments this year. If you cultivate for another year and experience another breakthrough, you\u2019ll definitely be able to obtain a spot next year.\u201d\u201cDad, I\u2019ve finally realized how many geniuses there are. Compared to them, I\u2019m still very mediocre. I will definitely work harder when I return,\u201d said his son in a low voice.The aged man smiled.His son had been very proud previously. After all, he had far surpassed his peers in his prefecture. He did things independently and acted like an arrogant genius. However, his son\u2019s arrogance had been shattered completely. At Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination, he was indeed a mediocre genius. Fortunately, he still had one chance left. He could try again next year.\u201cClan Leader, I\u2019ll serve in the military immediately,\u201d said a white-robed woman calmly to a silver-haired elder beside her. \u201cThe gap between the others and I is quite huge. I have nothing to say about not being admitted into Archean Mountain.\u201dThe silver-haired elder nodded. \u201cJoin the military and accumulate credit. You\u2019ll still have a chance of undergoing the Life-and-Death juncture and become a Godfiend in the future.\u201dThe white-robed woman said calmly, \u201cEither I die on the battlefield or become a Godfiend.\u201d Becoming a Godfiend was her life goal. She had never thought of living an ignoble life.Many geniuses and family members left one by one. Since they weren\u2019t on the list, they naturally had to leave.\u201cImpossible. I\u2019m not on the list?\u201d A colorful-robed youth looked at the golden scroll dazedly.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d The elder beside him pulled him away.\u201cThere must be something wrong. I should enter Archean Mountain. I have to,\u201d muttered the colorful-robed youth.\u201cAdmit your failure,\u201d said the elder.\u201cI haven\u2019t participated in the final selection. The Godfiends at Archean Mountain haven\u2019t discovered my true potential. They must have made a mistake,\u201d the colorful-robed youth muttered to himself.The elder shook his head and sighed, forcefully pulling him away.Most of the geniuses had to leave because there were only a hundred names on the list.Meng Chuan glanced at the geniuses who had failed. They were either silent, crazed, or indifferent\u2026 They had all sorts of reactions, and he felt mixed emotions. Entering Archean Mountain was like night and day for mortals. Many people had placed their hopes on Meng Chuan, but he was in much better shape. Furthermore, he was only eighteen.He wasn\u2019t like the geniuses who were already twenty years old\u2014where this was their last attempt at Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination.\u201cAwesome, Young Master Meng.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Meng, you are ranked first.\u201dBefore Meng Chuan reached the golden scroll, someone in front congratulated him.\u201cFirst place?\u201dMeng Chuan and his father walked through the crowd and finally saw the golden scroll. The words on the golden scroll seemed to contain a sense of pressure.His gaze swept across the scroll and saw the names of Jin Huan, Yan Jin, Chu Yong, and many others. At the top was the name \u201cMeng Chuan.\u201dMeng Chuan: A\u2013, A+, SJi Yuantong: A+, A, A+Zong Sha: A+, A, A\u2026Meng Chuan came to a realization after seeing this. Ji Yuantong and Zong Sha were evaluated to be A+ for the preliminaries\u2019 first assessment! The Archean Mountain Godfiends gave special treatment to sharpshooters.Zong Sha had broken through fewer light barriers than Meng Chuan in the first assessment, but his evaluation was the same as Ji Yuantong\u2019s. Clearly, the criterion for a sharpshooter was somewhat different. They were the only two who obtained an A+ for the first assessment.There were only two A-pluses for the second assessment. One was Jin Huan, while the other was Meng Chuan. In fact, Meng Chuan was ten percent faster than Jin Huan, making him better, but Meng Chuan had only received an A+. He didn\u2019t reach S\u2014which clearly had a very high threshold.Amongst all the geniuses, only Meng Chuan attained an S grade.S? An S actually appeared this year?Ji Yuantong looked at the only S grade on the list and fell silent.Ji Yuantong scored 2 A-pluses and an A in the preliminaries. That was definitely an extremely monstrous score. However, Meng Chuan scored an S grade.Ji Yuantong looked at Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan\u2014who were not far away. He turned and left, but his eyes were filled with battle intent.After the final selection, I will definitely become number one.Ninth.Yan Jin looked at his ranking calmly. Roughly ten people had Godfiend foundations that were on par with his. Being ranked ninth was quite low.I cultivate dual sword techniques. The preliminaries only showcase a single sword\u2019s strength.Yan Jin looked at the ranking.Only the final selection will showcase my true strength.He admitted that he was weaker than Meng Chuan. But, he was still stronger than Jin Huan and the others! Yet, Jin Huan was ranked sixth, while he was ranked ninth.There\u2019s actually an S grade?Chu Yong, Yan Feng, Jin Huan, Princess Li Ying, Dong Fang, Ning Yibo, Yan Chitong, and many other geniuses were shocked when they saw the S grade. Especially those from the powerful Godfiend family clans, they knew how rare an S grade was in the preliminaries.\u2026Blazing Sun Palace occupied a large area and had long prepared accommodation for exam participants and their family members. There were a lot of rooms, totaling three hundred rooms. Now, all the geniuses and family friends were settled in.Meng Chuan and Meng Dajiang took two neighboring rooms.Whoosh! Whoosh!It was late at night, and the snow didn\u2019t let up.Meng Chuan stared at the snow through the window as his thoughts drifted. The final selection was tomorrow. Although he was confident he could obtain a spot, he wasn\u2019t sure about his final ranking.Once a spot is obtained, one will be admitted into Archean Mountain officially. According to Archean Mountain\u2019s rules, one has to reach an extremely high realm before one can leave the mountain. I wonder when I will next return to my hometown. In five years? Ten years?The time he returned home would definitely be far into the future. He definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to see his grandaunt again. The clan leader was in his nineties, and few mortals could live past a hundred years. It was unlikely that they could meet again.I know what you\u2019re looking forward to. I won\u2019t disappoint you.Meng Chuan vowed silently.\u2026Elsewhere in Blazing Sun Palace.Candle flames flickered.When King East River heard the snowfall, he smiled and wrote a letter in his room. After writing it, he smiled in satisfaction.\u201cAh Tong,\u201d said King East River. His voice traveled a quarter kilometer away.Soon, a figure arrived at King East River\u2019s residence.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGo, send this letter to Mountain Lord.\u201d King East River waved his hand, and the letter flew out. It flew out the window and arrived at the figure in the yard.\u201cYes.\u201d A pair of wings sprouted out from the figure\u2019s back. With a whoosh, he soared into the sky and flew towards Archean Mountain rapidly.Heavy snow indicates a bountiful harvest.King East River looked at the snow outside and smiled.We\u2019ve discovered another peerless piece of unpolished jade. I hope he can grow and become a powerful Godfiend for us humans.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thick snow covered the ground.After eating breakfast, the geniuses and their family members gathered in an open space outside a hall.I\u2019m finally at the final selection. It\u2019s my last chance.A genius stood alone in the corner, his eyes filled with determination.I have to make a final gamble. I\u2019m already twenty years old. I must get a spot this time.Many geniuses fell silent. The pressure was immense.Even the princess, Li Ying, and the others who barely made it to the top ten in the preliminaries were nervous. They were confident of getting a spot, but they were afraid! If Archean Mountain were to suddenly choose other seedlings, pushing them beyond the top 20, wouldn\u2019t it be dumbfounding?After the initial selection, the only ones who would definitely get a spot were probably Meng Chuan, Ji Yuantong, and Zong Sha.\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d\u201cKing East River and the others are here.\u201dEveryone fell silent. Meng Dajiang and Meng Chuan looked up. King East River, the sloppy man, and the cyan-clothed woman walked in from the entrance. The three of them stopped in front of the crowd.King East River swept his gaze across everyone and said, \u201cToday is Archean Mountain\u2019s final selection. The final selection will be your last chance. As long as you show enough strength or have sufficient potential, our Archean Mountain will give you a spot. However, there are only twenty spots. Most of you are destined to be eliminated.\u201dEveryone listened calmly.\u201cDo a good job. Eighty-three of you are already twenty this year,\u201d said the sloppy man as well. \u201cIf you miss this chance, you won\u2019t have a second chance.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d After King East River spoke, the space around him distorted, enveloping everyone present. People could not look at King East River directly once again.Meng Chuan felt an invisible force envelop him gently. There was something invisible beneath his feet, supporting him. Following that, he flew up.The three Godfiends flew up with nearly two hundred people. They flew straight towards the massive Archean Mountain\u2014which towered into the clouds.How can they fly so fast with nearly two hundred people being carried by them?Meng Chuan was somewhat shocked as well. The geniuses saw themselves flying higher and higher, slowly exiting Archean City as they headed towards Archean Mountain.He could clearly see Archean Mountain, but even at King East River\u2019s terrifying speed, it still took ten minutes for them to arrive.Meng Chuan and company were shocked when they faced Archean Mountain up close.Towering, massive, vast\u2026It was so big that they appeared tiny in front of it.Whoosh.After flying through the mountain, they went past mountainsides, mountain peaks, and mountain valleys.King East River led the geniuses to the entrance of a massive canyon. Many Godfiends had already gathered at the entrance. Aside from Marquis Southcloud, Marquis West Sea, and the other Godfiends\u2014who had been watching yesterday\u2014there were also unfamiliar Godfiends. They numbered about fifty.\u201cThat\u2019s Meng Chuan?\u201d\u201cS-grade spiritual perception?\u201dMany of the Godfiends\u2014who had just arrived\u2014noticed Meng Chuan.After King East River landed, he walked to a linen-clothed elder.\u201cElder Yi,\u201d said King East River with a smile. \u201cAre you here to watch the final selection as well?\u201d\u201cMountain Lord personally instructed me to take a good look at this Meng Chuan,\u201d said the elder. The two of them stood in front of the other Godfiends. The other Godfiends clearly respected the two since they were Regis Godfiends. There were very few Regis Godfiends, and they held extremely high statuses. Furthermore, most Regis Godfiends had to guard large-scale passes, preventing them from leaving. It was very rare for two Regis Godfiends to spectate the test.\u201cYou can begin,\u201d said the elder. \u201cI\u2019ll just watch from the sidelines.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d King East River took a few steps forward and looked at the geniuses. He said, \u201cThe final selection has two trials. The first trial is demon-slaying!\u201dMany geniuses\u2019 eyes lit up immediately. Archean Mountain\u2019s final assessment often changed, but demon-slaying was an immutable trial!\u201cMany of you believe that you couldn\u2019t showcase your true strength at the preliminaries. Now your chance is here. Slaying demons is the best way to showcase your strength.\u201d King East River pointed at the canyon in front of them. \u201cLook, there are countless demons imprisoned in the canyon. In a while, you will be engaging them in battle. You can kill as many as you want. Killing ten demon lieutenant commanders is enough. Any more would be useless. As for demon commanders? The more you kill, the better.\u201dOnly then did Meng Chuan and company take a closer look at the canyon.The huge canyon was blocked by fog. Through the fog, one could vaguely see caves on the cliffs. If one listened carefully, they could hear low growls.The caves on the cliff sides were quite far away from Meng Chuan, exceeding the range of his senses\u2014which was half a kilometer.Countless demons are imprisoned in the canyon? Why would Archean Mountain imprison so many demons? Is it to test us?Meng Chuan wondered about Archean Mountain\u2019s motives.\u201cThe trial lasts for five minutes,\u201d continued King East River. \u201cIf you are about to lose your lives, I will rescue you. Alright, all of you can enter.\u201dMeng Chuan, Yan Jin, Ji Yuantong, Zong Sha, Chu Yong, Yan Feng, Yan Chitong, Jin Huan, and the other geniuses walked towards the huge canyon.As for the family members, they could only watch the trial nervously.\u201cKing East River,\u201d said a red-robed Godfiend.\u201cLet\u2019s begin.\u201d King East River nodded.Only then did the red-robed woman take a step forward. Her figure blurred as she arrived in the huge valley.Meng Chuan and company stared at the red-robed Godfiend in surprise.The red-robed Godfiend continued walking. She walked one step at a time, passing many geniuses before reaching the caves near the huge canyon.Every cave had chained demons. These demons had limited motion. They lived in the dim caves for extended periods and hated humans even more.Suddenly, their chains unlocked and fell to the ground with a thud.\u201cOh?\u201d The demons in the cave were somewhat alarmed. Why had the chains\u2014that imprisoned them\u2014unlock? However, they were immediately overjoyed.\u201cWe can leave now.\u201d\u201cA demon monarch must have saved us.\u201d The demons rushed out of the caves.The red-robed Godfiend walked through the canyon. Many demons were jumping down from the caves. Some demons were scaling the cliffs like they were walking. Some demons spread their wings and flew above the canyon.The ground, cliffs, and sky were filled with demons. There were over a thousand of them.\u201cThere\u2019s a human here.\u201d\u201cKill her.\u201dThe demons lunged at the female Godfiend.\u201cSilence,\u201d shouted the female Godfiend suddenly. As she spoke, invisible waves of power spread across the valley.The demons\u2014that were originally excited and ferocious\u2014quietened down as they looked at the red-robed woman respectfully.Meng Chuan and company felt their hearts tremble.One sentence was enough to silence and stop over 1000 demons\u2014that were enemies of their race?The red-robed Godfiend turned to look at Meng Chuan and company. \u201cThere are 1,227 demons here. Among them, there are over a thousand demon lieutenant commanders. The demon commanders number 135. You have to protect yourself first before thinking of ways to kill these demons.\u201dThe geniuses\u2019 expressions changed. Even Meng Chuan and Yan Jin had solemn expressions. They knew how powerful demon commanders were. Yet, there were over a hundred demon commanders here?If they fought head-on, the geniuses wouldn\u2019t be able to touch the other party. Instead of demon-slaying, they could easily end up being the ones slain!\u201cKill. Kill all the humans in front of you.\u201d The red-robed Godfiend pointed at Meng Chuan and company.The thousand obedient demons\u2019 eyes turned red as they went mad. Their roars, shrill screams, and whines resounded throughout the canyon. They charged at Meng Chuan and company frenziedly. Some flew in the sky, while others rapidly climbed the cliffs. Most of them charged at them on the ground.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe red-robed Godfiend watched this scene calmly. Following that, she flew back to the canyon entrance.\u201cIt\u2019s starting.\u201dKing East River and the other Godfiends watched calmly. By the side, an incense stick had already been lit.The demon-slaying trial lasted for five minutes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had a total of a hundred people, only ten people could match a demon commander! On the other hand, there were 135 demon commanders and over 1000 demon lieutenant commanders. If they didn\u2019t join forces, they would probably be defeated very quickly.Eleven sharpshooters stood in the middle of the formation while the other geniuses protected them.Meng Chuan and Ji Yuantong were the only ones that dared to charge into the demon army, but that was only brute courage. Only by cooperating with their companions would their efficiency be higher.He had cultivated in a Dao Academy since he was young; thus he knew the need for cooperation.\u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d All the geniuses solemnly stared at the charging demons.\u201cScram!\u201d Dong Fang\u2014who was one of the strongest\u2014wielded a large shield and a large axe. With a swing of his barbed shield, he sent a wolf demon flying. Its bones were fractured by the impact. Following that, Dong Fang swung his axe and cleaved a tiger demon lieutenant commander to death.\u201cBlock!\u201d Many geniuses used their shields to block.One blade after another stabbed out from the gaps in the wall of shields, killing the demon lieutenant commanders sinisterly.At the same time, the eleven sharpshooters rapidly shot arrows. The geniuses who could enter the top hundred were the strongest mortal youths. Their arrows bombarded the demons at extreme speeds. The bombardment hit the demons while they were distracted by the other geniuses, reaping their lives. In the blink of an eye, dozens of demon lieutenant commanders died.In terms of killing efficiency, sharpshooters were the most terrifying.The human\u2019s circular phalanx formation was like a meat grinder.Growl\u2014Under the red-robed Godfiend\u2019s command, the demons attacked madly. None of them were afraid of death. They constantly charged towards the shields! Flying demons also swooped down and attacked.As demon lieutenant commanders were slaughtered, demon commanders arrived at the formation.\u201cThe demon commanders are here.\u201d\u201cEveryone, be careful.\u201dThe geniuses were becoming more cautious. They also wished to kill the demons. This was Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination\u2014they naturally wanted to perform well.Demon commanders\u2019 auras were even stronger, and they were all much larger!A rhinoceros demon commander\u2014wielding two hammers\u2014took wide strides. When it came close, it let out a furious grunt as the hammers slammed down.Bam.Chu Yong blocked one hammer head-on with his saber. Following that, his saber changed direction, and he slashed at the rhinoceros demon\u2019s knee. As for the other hammer, it slammed into the ground.Swoosh.An arrow flashed past and pierced the rhinoceros demon\u2019s face. It penetrated a foot deep, but the rhinoceros demon didn\u2019t care about such injuries.Pfft.An arrow pierced the rhinoceros demon\u2019s eyes and penetrated deep into its head. Only then did the rhinoceros demon tremble and collapse.Chu Yong held the demons back while Li Ying and Zong Sha killed a demon commander in quick succession with an arrow each.However, more demon commanders were here!The first wave of demon commanders caused the circular phalanx formation to waver. The geniuses were unable to stop the demon commanders.\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cNot good.\u201dSuddenly, part of the circular phalanx formation began to collapse. A cat demon commander\u2014 who had transformed into a black stream of light\u2014was fearless as it attacked. Geniuses fell to the ground. However, when the cat demon was about to tear the humans apart with its claws, an invisible force enveloped the youths and pulled them to the canyon entrance. Archean Mountain Godfiends had rescued the injured geniuses.When death was imminent, the Godfiends would save them.We were defeated the moment the demon commanders attacked?The geniuses, who had been rescued, felt mixed emotions. They watched the demons charge at the circular phalanx formation as they flew towards the canyon entrance.Meng Chuan ignored a demon commander and quickly went to block the cat demon commander.The two had a contest of speed. He used the incomplete Five Lightning Descent\u2014his three-hit combo!The fastest strike of his combo was Swaying Moonfall. His saber struck the cat commander\u2019s abdomen, leaving a gaping wound. Shortly after, an arrow pierced the cat demon\u2019s head. The cat demon was fast, but its body was much weaker than a bear demon, or an ox demon.Meng Chuan turned his head and saw Zong Sha smile before he continued shooting.Meng Chuan also realized how easily he suppressed the demon commanders compared to when the demons had invaded Eastcalm Prefecture. In the past half-year, pushing his Saber Force to its limits had increased his strength. However, he would take at least ten strikes to kill a demon commander. Even then, some demon commanders would be unkillable for him. Fortunately, he had sharpshooters helping. A sharpshooter\u2019s arrows were much faster than his saber.\u2026Time passed.Many human geniuses struggled to hold on and had to be rescued after the demon commanders had charged into their circular phalanx formation.The trial ended.\u201cStop.\u201d The red-robed woman\u2019s voice resounded in the canyon. All the demons stopped fighting and became docile.\u201cReturn to your respective caves,\u201d instructed the woman. The demons either ran, crawled, or flew. They obediently returned to their respective caves on the cliff walls. Affected by an invisible force, the demons were chained.There were only seven bloodied people left standing in the canyon\u2014Meng Chuan, Yan Jin, Ji Yuantong, Chu Yong, Yan Feng, Sharpshooter Zong Sha, and Sharpshooter Li Ying.They stood there, breathing haggardly.\u201cIt\u2019s over?\u201d asked Yan Feng hoarsely.\u201cFive minutes are up.\u201d Chu Yong sat down in exhaustion.\u201cThose demons were crazy.\u201d Ji Yuantong was also exhausted.Yan Jin stood silently. His fingers\u2014that were holding the two swords\u2014had turned white.Meng Chuan heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cThank you, everyone,\u201d Zong Sha said. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you protecting us, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to hold on.\u201d\u201cIf you wish to thank someone, thank Meng Chuan. He did his best to protect the two of you,\u201d said Yan Feng as he held his spear.\u201cYoung Master Meng is indeed impressive.\u201d Princess Li Ying laughed.Meng Chuan only nodded and couldn\u2019t be bothered speaking. He was exhausted. He had been extremely focused for five whole minutes as he frantically tried to put out fires everywhere.He could easily assess the situation around him with his 100 foot domain. He could deal with any problems that arose. He also relied on his speed to protect the two sharpshooters. Of course, the others were also trying their best to protect the sharpshooters.Sharpshooters were much more efficient at killing demons. On a battlefield, the sharpshooters needed to be protected.\u201cThe two of you are really powerful. When the three demon commanders used the poisonous fog, the two of you charged into the demon horde and killed the three demon commanders.\u201d Princess Li Ying felt even more poignant. It was a harrowing memory. If they hadn\u2019t killed the three demon commanders, they wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on for long.\u201cThe first trial of the final selection is over. The seven of you, hurry over,\u201d ordered the blue-clothed woman.Meng Chuan and the others immediately headed towards the canyon.\u2026King East River, the sloppy-looking man, and the blue-clothed woman accurately evaluated the geniuses\u2019 performances during the trial.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere are some geniuses who have high realms and strong Godfiend foundations. However, when it comes to intense battles, they are shocked. They can only unleash 70% of their full strength. They can even go into killing frenzies on the battlefield, destroying any combat formations set up. They then become counter-productive to what we want.\u201d The cyan-clothed woman shook her head. \u201cThese are people with poor combat talent.\u201d\u201cTalent in cultivation doesn\u2019t mean that one\u2019s combat talent is high,\u201d said the sloppy man with a smile.Combat talent was very important. A Godfiend with high combat talent could kill about five enemies that were of similar strength.\u201cOf these hundred geniuses, seven are lacking in combat talent. What\u2019s the point of nurturing such fools?\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman. \u201cMost geniuses performed as expected. They know how to cooperate and not burden their companions.

These geniuses haven\u2019t served in the military. They will perform much better after five years on the battlefield.\u201d\u201cWhat we need are geniuses. Cultivation time for geniuses is very precious. How can we let them slowly hone themselves on the battlefield?\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman.\u201cWe can discuss and determine the ranking after the second trial is over,\u201d said King East River. \u201cLet\u2019s begin the second trial. This is the most important test.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The cyan-robed woman and the sloppy-looking man nodded.There was only one final test left.If the demon-slaying was to determine geniuses\u2019 true combat strength and combat talent, the second trial was to determine a genius\u2019s potential.\u2026The geniuses were floating again. They flew with the Godfiends and finally landed on a vast mountain.\u201cI\u2019ll give you an hour to rest.\u201d King East River looked at the exhausted geniuses. Many geniuses had bandaged their bloody wounds. \u201cIn an hour, we\u2019ll carry out the second trial! This is Archean Mountain\u2019s final assessment. Once it\u2019s over, we\u2019ll decide the twenty who will be admitted to Archean Mountain.\u201dMeng Chuan and company sat down in lotus positions immediately. Quintessential Essence circulated through their bodies as they recovered their energy.\u201cIt\u2019s the final assessment.\u201d\u201cArchean Mountain Godfiends must reach the Great Solar realm at the very least. If one doesn\u2019t have the potential to become a Great Solar Godfiend, there\u2019s no need to nurture them.\u201d Marquis Southcloud and the other Godfiends chatted by the side. Although there were many Godfiends in the Great Zhou Dynasty, most of them weren\u2019t Great Solar Godfiends.The Great Solar realm was the Body Tempering Godfiend lineage\u2019s theoretical limit.For instance, Fairy Meng, Yun Wanhai, and others were only outer sect disciples of Archean Mountain. They were lucky enough to become Godfiends. Most of them were Indestructible Godfiends. Even Jadesun Palace Lord was only at the second Firmament\u2014the Indestructible realm. Jadesun Palace Lord came from Archean Mountain. He cultivated a powerful Godfiend body and had a robust foundation. This allowed him to withstand simultaneous attacks from a third Firmament demon monarch and multiple second Firmament demon monarchs.This was the standard of Archean Mountain disciples. With a strong foundation and strength, one could typically stay alive even if they were fighting someone one realm higher! Furthermore, reaching the Great Solar realm was just the first goal.Jadesun Palace Lord was very young. Ultimately, he was far from reaching his limits. He was temporarily in charge of defending an ordinary city.\u2026Meng Chuan recovered as he restored his Quintessential Essence fully.\u201cAn hour has passed.\u201d King East River\u2019s voice rang out.The geniuses sitting cross-legged opened their eyes. They immediately stood up and looked at King East River. Their families and friends, as well as the many Godfiends, were filled with anticipation.\u201cThe final trial is to test your heart.\u201d King East River pointed at a huge altar in the distance. The altar was a four-cornered pyramid. Each side was lined with over a hundred steps, and they continued to the top. The altar was made of limestone, and there were mottled marks on them. Clearly, it had a long history.\u201cThis is the Darkness Altar. Once you step onto the altar, you\u2019ll find yourself trapped in darkness. You need to maintain your lucidity in the darkness. The higher you go, the more outstanding you will be. If you sink into the darkness, you will fail.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s begin,\u201d said King East River.Meng Chuan and the others hesitated for a moment before they split up and walked up to the Darkness Altar. There were twenty people on each side. Soon, someone took the first step up. A faint black fog immediately rose up from the limestone steps and seeped into the person\u2019s body. The person trembled, and he hesitated for a moment before continuing to advance. The others also climbed the altar step by step. Black fog rising from beneath their feet seeped into their bodies.Boom!Meng Chuan took a step forward. A faint black fog rose from the limestone steps and seeped into his body, quickly spreading towards his head.Meng Chuan felt his head spin. He felt like he was in a nightmare. Many demon monarchs and bloodthirsty Skydemons charged over. The demon monarchs and Skydemons had terrifying auras that far exceeded Demon Monarch Poison Pool\u2019s. Meng Chuan felt his body stiffen as though it was very difficult for him to move.Walk. Continue walking. It\u2019s all an illusion. An illusion.Meng Chuan persuaded himself constantly. He forced his body to move, but his body was stiffer than an 80-year-old man. He struggled to advance.As he took a step forward, the black fog\u2014that seeped out from the limestone steps\u2014increased. It constantly entered his body, affecting his body, soul\u2014everything.The illusions also grew stronger. The impact on his body was even stronger. Meng Chuan tried his best to control his body and advance.\u2026Every genius walked very slowly. The higher they went, the slower they became.On the eighth step, one genius stopped moving. He was motionless for fifteen seconds before the black fog completely engulfed his head. His eyes turned pitch-black, and the whites in his eyes were gone.The cyan-clothed woman frowned when she saw this. \u201cHis willpower is too weak. How can someone with such willpower reach the Realm of Soul? How can he become a Great Solar Godfiend?\u201dIn all kinds of skills such as saber arts and sword techniques, there was the Unity realm, the Realm of Force, and the Realm of Intent. Meng Chuan was presently pursuing Saber Intent. The fourth realm was the Realm of Soul.Whoosh.King East River waved his hand, and an invisible force enveloped the genius, removing him from the altar.The genius left the Darkness Altar, and the black fog quickly receded into the altar.Without the black fog affecting him, the genius regained his consciousness. Only then did he realize that he was the only one not on the altar. Dazedly, he stood still.I\u2019m the worst in the final trial?Soon, there were two youths that stopped at the tenth step. The black fog enveloped their heads, and their eyes turned black without any white visible. They were moved away from the altar.\u201cAll Archean Mountain Godfiends become Great Solar Godfiends unless we die in battle,\u201d said Marquis West Sea as he watched. \u201cWhen they participate in the assessment, they are almost twenty years of age. They should have at least 30% of the willpower needed to reach the Great Solar realm, right? To not have 30% of the required willpower means their chances of becoming a Great Solar Godfiend are slim.\u201d\u201cTheir potential is too low,\u201d the other Godfiends agreed.Regardless of how strong a Godfiend\u2019s foundation was or how talented they were in combat, they would usually be eliminated if their results in the final trial were terrible.Willpower was very special. Sometimes, a mortal could have strong willpower. Sometimes, even a Godfiend wouldn\u2019t have shocking willpower.One genius after another stopped in their tracks.\u201cThey need to reach the 30th step at the very least. If they can\u2019t reach it, their willpower would be too weak.\u201d The Godfiends watched.\u201cHuh?\u201dAll the Godfiends\u2019 expressions changed. The spectating families and friends also revealed looks of astonishment.The thin Ji Yuantong\u2014with a pair of huge hammers on his back\u2014stopped on the 17th step. He stood still as the black fog gradually gathered around his head.\u201cNo way!?\u201d\u201cJi Yuantong, he, he can\u2019t be\u2026\u201dThe Godfiends were astonished.He was one of the two most dazzling geniuses in this year\u2019s entrance examination. His physical talent was definitely the best. His spiritual perception talent was also rather good, second only to Meng Chuan! He was one of the rare geniuses that would only appear once every ten years in Archean Mountain.But he had actually stopped at the 17th step?\u201cGo on up.\u201d The sloppy man frowned, his eyes filled with anxiety.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJi Yuantong trembled slightly as if he was struggling. However, the black fog gradually gathered around his head, and his eyes gradually turned black. In the end, there was not a single hint of white\u2026He was like a statue\u2014motionless.\u201cJi Yuantong stopped at the 17th step?\u201d The Godfiends were heartbroken. They were overjoyed every time they saw a peerless genius. It meant that they might have a powerful companion in the future. Ji Yuantong had only reached the 17th step in the final trial, and it truly disappointed them. They were left anxious.\u201cSigh.\u201d King East River shook his head gently. With a thought, Ji Yuantong flew off the altar and was brought to the ground. Ji Yuantong came in ninth from the bottom in this trial.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ji Yuantong\u2019s gaze swept around him.Only nine people have been eliminated?His heart sank. I\u2019mranked 92nd out of a hundred people?How proud was he?He had been supercilious towards his peers since he was young. He couldn\u2019t care less about his siblings. His family clan also nurtured him with all their might, hoping that the Ji family would produce another powerful Godfiend.He had regarded Meng Chuan as his only competitor in Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination. However, he was ranked near the bottom for the final assessment.Their wills are all stronger than mine?Ji Yuantong looked at the geniuses above him. Many of them had never consumed natural treasures before. He had thought nothing of them in the past, but these geniuses were slowly advancing step by step. As for him, he had already been eliminated.\u2026Ji Yuantong\u2019s potential needs to be greatly reconsidered. I hope there won\u2019t be any accidents with the others that have strong Godfiend foundations. This was a common thought shared by many Godfiends.Archean Mountain valued Godfiends with strong foundations, high cultivation realms, and good combat talent. They hoped that the geniuses wouldn\u2019t be lacking when it came to willpower.One after another, geniuses collapsed as they ascended the altar.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dThe Godfiends suddenly laughed. This was because among these geniuses, the youngest genius\u2014Yan Chitong\u2014had stopped at the 22nd step. His eyes had also turned pitch-black. King East River smiled as he moved Yan Chitong down.\u201cMarquis West Sea, your son is not bad.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. To be able to reach the 22nd step of the Darkness Altar at the age of thirteen is already very impressive.\u201d\u201cHis mind is still maturing. He\u2019s very outstanding for reaching the 22nd step,\u201d commented the Godfiends while smiling.Yan Chitong was still a teenager. However, Ji Yuantong was already an adult. An adult\u2019s mind was typically mature, but he only reached the seventeenth step. This truly broke the hearts of many Godfiends.I actually lost.Yan Chitong returned to his senses as well. He couldn\u2019t help but clench his fists indignantly as he stared at the geniuses still on the Darkness Altar. However, when his gaze landed on Ji Yuantong, he grinned.\u2026The 30th step was Archean Mountain\u2019s minimum requirement for their future Godfiends. Fortunately, the other geniuses\u2014who they thought highly of\u2014with strong Godfiend foundations had all achieved the minimum requirement. Among 100 geniuses, 26 had failed to reach the 30th step.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cChu Yong also stopped?\u201dThe Godfiends frowned slightly.The former number one genius of the capital, Chu Yong, stopped at the 38th step. His eyes turned pitch-black, and he stood still like a statue. Although he had passed the demarcating line, his result of 38 steps was very mediocre. It was below average amongst the 100 geniuses.But following that, Princess Li Ying and Jin Huan\u2014whose speed was second only to Meng Chuan\u2014stopped at the 39th step.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe three of them stopped in succession.\u201dKing East River and the others frowned slightly. Other than Yan Chitong, those with robust Godfiend foundations numbered ten. They were none other than Chu Yong, Yan Feng, Meng Chuan, Yan Jin, Zong Sha, Li Ying, Jin Huan, Ning Yibo, Dong Fang, and Ji Yuantong. Apart from Yan Feng having a fortuitous encounter, the rest were specially nurtured by their family clans.Their cultivation realms and Godfiend foundations were extremely profound. Ji Yuantong had broken many people\u2019s hearts after halting on the 17th step. Chu Yon had stopped at the 37th, while Li Ying and Jin Huan had stopped at the 39th step. Their results were below average. Soon, the brawny Dong Fang stopped at the 43rd step. He was considered average, ranking fiftieth.\u201cOut of the ten geniuses with robust Godfiend foundations, half of them are below the 50th step.\u201d The Godfiends watched calmly. This was something they had expected. One\u2019s Godfiend foundation and talent had nothing to do with willpower. Of the 100 geniuses, 61 didn\u2019t reach the 50th step. It was normal if half of those\u2014with strong Godfiend foundations\u2014to fail to reach the 50th step. The ratio was expected.\u2026Time passed.The geniuses advanced up the altar step by step.Ning Yibo stopped on the 59th step and was moved away from the Darkness Altar.Oh?When Ning Bo regained consciousness, he raised his head and saw that the slowest remaining genius on the Darkness Altar was at the 60th step.There are still 18 geniuses left on the Darkness Altar.Among the geniuses he paid much attention to, only Meng Chuan, Yan Jin, Zong Sha, and Yan Feng were still climbing the Darkness Altar with great difficulty.Meng Chuan felt like he was in a nightmare that he couldn\u2019t wake up from. He could sense his body, but it was like he was in a trance.These are all illusions. They are all fake. Continue walking.Meng Chuan tried to maintain clarity of his mind and forced his body to continue moving.Illusions constantly barraged his mind, making him feel like he had fallen into an abyss. He was starting to confuse his real memories with the illusions. It was as though the illusions were real.Wake up. Stay awake.Meng Chuan roared angrily.You can\u2019t hold on because of these puny illusions? You want to kill all demons with such willpower?He was furious. He was angry about being affected by the illusions. However, no matter how angry he was, his memories became blurrier as his consciousness sank deeper into the illusions. The illusions became closer and closer to reality.In one illusion, he was a soldier. He and his companions faced the overwhelming horde of demons on the battlefield. His companions died one after another.I can\u2019t stop them. I can\u2019t. How can I withstand so many demons alone? I\u2019ll be killed.He and his remaining companions were gripped with fear. Countless demons surged towards them. He only had a few allies left by his side. His comrades were torn apart, and their blood splattered on his body.Fear and despair filled his heart.Eventually, he was the only human alive on the battlefield! All his comrades lay dead as countless demons charged at him ferociously.There was no hope! It was over!How can this be me? So weak and so fearful! How can this be me?An angry roar sounded in his heart.He felt pure anger.He was angry at his weakness, angry that this was all fake!Even if I\u2014Meng Chuan\u2014were to die today, I\u2019ll continue killing until I drop. If I can kill one demon, I\u2019ll kill one. If I can kill ten, I\u2019ll kill ten.Meng Chuan roared inwardly.I, Meng Chuan, will never fear demons! Even in death!Meng Chuan\u2019s will condensed, and he escaped the illusions. His perception of his body grew clearer. Meng Chuan regained some control over his mind, and his memories became much clearer.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe remembered that he was still walking on the Darkness Altar.Continue walking. Remember Eastcalm Prefecture. Remember those weak civilians that used their bodies to block the demons for their children. Remember how Third Elder sacrificed himself for the young clansmen.For generations, people have charged forward. I\u2019m also one of them. How can I be afraid of demons? I once swore an oath to kill all demons! I\u2019ll first sever my weakness and fear!Meng Chuan\u2019s will continued to condense as he continued climbing the altar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - SpotsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 89: SpotsCKtalonBlack fog would seep into Meng Chuan\u2019s body every step he took up the altar. The illusions continued to increase in potency.Countless illusions attacked his mind, yanking Meng Chuan\u2019s consciousness so that he would fall into an abyss.No one can stop me. If I can\u2019t even destroy illusions, how can I kill all demons?Meng Chuan\u2019s condensed will was like a saber. This saber was for demon-slaying, so he wanted to slice through the obstructions on his cultivation path.He continued to advance with great difficulty, but as he advanced, the black fog grew thicker. The illusions\u2019 influence on his body and consciousness grew stronger. Even though his will was like a blade, his consciousness was shrouded by the illusions.When his memories were muddled up, the illusions became more realistic. He gradually lost his perception of his body.Boom!An invisible force appeared in his mind.Oh? Power of the Soul?Meng Chuan suddenly sobered up. He had completely recovered his memories, blocking the illusions\u2019 influence over him. Although he didn\u2019t use the Power of the Soul actively, it had expelled the black fog from his body just before he succumbed to the illusions.The Power of the Soul is impressive. It can easily block these illusions. But if that\u2019s the case, how would I temper my willpower?He immediately restrained the Power of the Soul, preventing it from helping him. The illusions attacked his mind once again, causing his consciousness to sink into the abyss. However, the Power of the Soul ultimately allowed him to keep a sliver of consciousness.This sliver of clarity allowed him to identify the illusions, however, he was unable to break free of them. Furthermore, he couldn\u2019t sense his body. His consciousness seemed to be trapped in a cage of darkness.Although he could destroy the cage of darkness with his Power of the Soul, Meng Chuan didn\u2019t do so.I can\u2019t sense my body at all. I can\u2019t move any further. I should have failed.\u2026Outside.King East River and company watched from afar. After Ji Yuantong stopped, they paid even more attention to Meng Chuan.If Ji Yuantong was a rare genius that appeared once a decade, then Meng Chuan\u2019s spiritual perception talent was simply inconceivable. Such talent had only appeared once in recent centuries. Therefore, all the Godfiends present placed great importance on Meng Chuan. If Meng Chuan lacked willpower, it would be ten times worse than Ji Yuantong failing at the 17th step.30 steps, 40 steps, 50 steps, 60 steps.Seeing Meng Chuan slowly advance, the Godfiends gradually relaxed. To pass the sixtieth step meant that he had outstanding willpower.On the 66th step, Yan Feng stopped. Meng Chuan stopped at the 68th step.\u201cOh? Meng Chuan is about to stop?\u201d\u201cThe 68th step is not bad. He\u2019s ranked 10th for this assessment.\u201d\u201cTo become a Great Solar Godfiend, one needs to reach the 103rd step of the Darkness Altar! He has reached the 68th step at the age of 18. He will naturally grow. In ten years, he will easily reach the top of the altar.The Godfiends were quite satisfied with Meng Chuan\u2019s results.Meng Chuan stopped on the 68th step for a few seconds, his eyes gradually turning pitch black. However, his eyes soon returned to normal. Meng Chuan continued to move upwards. Meng Chuan was angry at his powerlessness, so his willpower and resilience improved. His willpower was a blade that cut through illusions, which is why he continued to move upwards.\u201cOh? He was about to fail, yet he managed to escape the illusion? Having breakthroughs at critical moments is very rare,\u201d said Elder Yi with a smile.King East River nodded. \u201cHis inner will is very powerful. After encountering trouble, his heart will become more resolute. His will can be even more resilient.\u201dUnder the Godfiends\u2019 watch, geniuses gradually stopped.Zong Sha stopped at the 71st step. He ranked 8th among the hundred geniuses! He was extremely outstanding.At the 75th step, Meng Chuan stopped again. The black fog enveloped his head again, and his eyes gradually turned pitch-black. Although he struggled midway, his eyes eventually turned black. His entire body remained motionless like a statue.\u201c75th step. Very good.\u201d King East River smiled and nodded. An invisible force enveloped Meng Chuan and dumped him in an empty area. The black fog quickly separated from his body and receded into the Darkness Altar.Without the black fog in his body, Meng Chuan quickly regained consciousness and his control over his body.I was moved down?Meng Chuan looked up. There were four people left\u2014still struggling to climb higher.The only genius with an extremely strong Godfiend foundation left was Yan Jin. The other three didn\u2019t enjoy much fame.\u201cMeng Chuan, you reached the 75th step.\u201d Princess Li Ying smiled as she walked over. Her eyes glimmered, and she became much more endearing. \u201cYou\u2019re fifth amongst the hundred of us. However, the ranking isn\u2019t important. A strong will is needed to become a Great Solar Godfiend. All you need to do is reach the top of the Darkness Altar. Since you\u2019ve already reached the 75th step, you\u2019ll probably reach the top in three years or so.\u201dMeng Chuan sighed. As expected of the princess of the imperial family. She knew a lot. He didn\u2019t know much about Great Solar Godfiends. His father was a Body Tempering Godfiend, and the Body Tempering Godfiend lineage stopped at the Great Solar realm.\u201cBut, I\u2019m in much worse shape. I only reached the 39th step. I\u2019ll have to spend more effort on my will in the future,\u201d said Princess Li Ying with a smile. \u201cThankfully, reaching the Great Solar realm usually takes 20-30 years. I have plenty of time to increase my willpower slowly. By the way, do you know that Ji Yuantong stopped at the 17th step?\u201d\u201c17th step?\u201d Meng Chuan was shocked.\u201cYes, I believe the Archean Mountain Godfiends have headaches,\u201d said Li Ying.Meng Chuan and Li Ying chatted until they saw Yan Jin finally stop on the 81st step. After he left the Darkness Altar, only two geniuses remained.Zuo Xiao stopped on the 85th step.Zhang Lie stopped on the 93rd step.Zhang Lie\u2019s results in the previous assessments were very mediocre. He was ranked 99th during the preliminaries. However, he ranked first in the final trial. He reached an unbelievable height of 93 steps. He wasn\u2019t far from reaching the summit.Zhang Lie and Zuo Xiao had never consumed any rare treasures. They were all from ordinary family clans, and they had suffered much hardship.They only lack opportunities. They didn\u2019t have any family help.Meng Chuan looked at Zuo Xiao and Zhang Lie and sighed inwardly.This was human fate.If he had grown up in a large family clan, living in luxury since a young age\u2014thus being an elite with excellent cultivation conditions\u2014he wouldn\u2019t have experienced much hardship. That would\u2019ve probably prevented him from reaching the 93rd step today.\u201cAll the assessments have come to an end,\u201d said King East River in a clear voice. \u201cYou can rest for an hour. After a discussion, the final twenty will be announced.\u201dThe final name list is going to be decided.Will I be included?I wasn\u2019t ranked at the top for the preliminaries, but I wasn\u2019t too bad either. My performance was very average. I should be able to enter the top 20.Many geniuses were extremely nervous as they thought about how Archean Mountain would decide the final twenty.To many of them, obtaining a spot was a leap in status! If they couldn\u2019t obtain a spot, they would have to accumulate credit on the battlefield slowly. Furthermore, they wouldn\u2019t have any good teachers to guide them. In Archean Mountain, powerful Godfiends would guide disciples, and they were allowed to learn the strongest Godfiend legacies. They would also enjoy rare resources as nourishment. Most of the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2019s Great Solar Godfiends came from Archean Mountain.Meng Chuan walked to Meng Dajiang. Yan Jin came as well.\u201cBoth of you did well,\u201d said Meng Dajiang happily. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, both of you will definitely get a spot.\u201d\u201cYan Jin, you ranked ninth in the preliminaries, and can be considered to be in the top five for the final selection.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll definitely get a spot.\u201d\u201cYou should be number one,\u201d said Yan Jin with a smile. After years of hard work, his first goal was to enter Archean Mountain. From the looks of it, nothing unexpected would happen.\u2026The Godfiends discussed the geniuses\u2019 performances.As for King East River, the sloppy man, the cyan-clothed woman, and Elder Yi, they were busy discussing the top twenty.\u201cJi Yuantong\u2019s inner will is flawed, but his spiritual perception talent is extremely high. As long as he can make up for his lacking willpower in the future, he will become a powerful human Godfiend. We definitely have to give him a spot,\u201d said the sloppy-looking man. \u201cThe other disciples will need to spend some effort to temper their wills at the Darkness Altar. For Ji Yuantong, let him spend more effort on this aspect.\u201d\u201cWe need to come up with a special plan to temper his will,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman. \u201cWe can make plans for him according to his childhood experiences. For example, a turning point in life, a desperate escape from despair, silver linings, marrying a wife and having children\u2026 I\u2019d rather delay him for ten years to make up for his lacking willpower.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d King East River nodded. \u201cI agree with giving him a spot, but in regards to his inner will\u2026 that requires a detailed plan.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to waste your efforts on these matters,\u201d said Elder Yi with a smile. \u201cThere are many old fellows on the mountain who can make proper plans for him. In the history of our Archean Mountain, we have had peerless geniuses with weak willpower.\u201dPeople with certain outstanding aspects could be recruited directly.For example, Liu Qiyue had a Phoenix Divine Body bloodline. She didn\u2019t take any tests and was directly admitted. Even if her cultivation were lacking or flawed, Archean Mountain would think of ways to make up for it.For ordinary geniuses, wasting too much time would delay their cultivation in other aspects. It wasn\u2019t worth Archean Mountain putting in too much effort to nurture them.However, they made exceptions for certain geniuses.\u201cJi Yuantong\u2019s spot has been decided. What about Zhang Lie? Zhang Lie came in first at the Darkness Altar, but he\u2019s very mediocre in other aspects,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman. \u201cHe only has a strong will. Without sufficient strength, how will he fight demons in the future?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHe is really mediocre.\u201d The sloppy man nodded. \u201cWe can let him try the Mirage Fiend lineage.\u201d\u201cHe might not be suitable for the Mirage Fiend lineage. I\u2019m afraid only the Sanguine God lineage is suitable for him,\u201d said King East River.\u201cLet\u2019s give him a spot. We can give Illusion Fiend and Sanguine God a try. If he doesn\u2019t become a high-grade Godfiend in ten years, then expel him from the inner sect,\u201d said Elder Yi. Archean Mountain had rules too. If a disciple wanted to become a Godfiend, they would at least be a high-grade Godfiend! This was one of the reasons why the Archean Mountain Godfiends were powerful. If they didn\u2019t become a high-grade Godfiend in ten years, they would be expelled from the inner sect and become an outer sect disciple.King East River and the others discussed one genius after another. Every spot was extremely precious, so they had to take it seriously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In fact, most of the spots were already set in stone. Only a small number of them needed discussion.\u201cIt\u2019s decided.\u201d King East River smiled.Every year, the recruitment of disciples at Archean Mountain was an extremely important matter. In order to be fair, the Regis Godfiends and Marquis Godfiends who presided over it would change. They also felt the heavy responsibility. After all, they had to rely on the yearly fresh blood to integrate into the sect and form the current Archean Mountain.\u2026Meng Chuan and company chatted as they waited. Some of the geniuses were even more nervous. Finally, an hour passed as King East River and company walked over from afar.\u201cThey\u2019re coming. They\u2019re coming!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to announce the final name list.\u201dAll the geniuses stared at the distant King East River. Their family and friends were equally nervous.The moment of truth was about to happen!Ji Yuantong stood by the side and watched silently. He was also afraid that he would be eliminated because of his poor performance during the final assessment.\u201cThis year\u2019s Archean Mountain entrance examination is over,\u201d said King East River with a smile. \u201cThe list of twenty people has been decided. From first to twenty, it will be as follows: Meng Chuan, Zong Sha, Yan Feng, Yan Jin, Ning Yibo, Zuo Xiao, Chu Yong, Jin Huan, Dong Fang, Li Ying\u2026 Shangguang Feng, Ji Yuantong\u2026 Zhang Lie, Yu Chang. The aforementioned will be recruited by Archean Mountain.\u201dThe geniuses and their family listened carefully for their names; some were overjoyed, others silent.\u201cMy dear disciple, you entered. You entered. You\u2019ve become a disciple of Archean Mountain.\u201d The fat elder hugged his disciple, Zuo Xiao. Zuo Xiao was thrilled as well. \u201cI got in! I got in!\u201dZuo Xiao\u2019s ranking was very high. He was ranked sixth, better than Chu Yong and company.I got in.I\u2019ve become a disciple of Archean Mountain.Many geniuses were extremely excited. Apart from the ten Godfiends who had robust Godfiend foundations, ten of them had mediocre foundations. There were seven geniuses who had never consumed any natural treasures.The preliminaries\u2019 third assessment\u2014spiritual perception\u2014and the final selection\u2019s second trial\u2014the Darkness Altar\u2014tested one\u2019s potential. The first assessment in the final selection mainly tested one\u2019s strength and combat talent.Therefore, many geniuses had the chance to be selected.Ji Yuantong heard his name. He was ranked fifteenth in this selection.As long as I enter the Archean Mountain, I will surpass Meng Chuan and the rest.Ji Yuantong vowed silently.I will also reach the top of this Darkness Altar!Ever since he was young, he had never submitted to anyone. He believed that he was the strongest.\u201cApart from the top twenty, Yan Chitong is only thirteen years old this year; he will be specially recruited as an Archean Mountain disciple,\u201d said King East River. His voice resounded throughout the mountain. \u201cBid farewell to your family and friends as soon as possible. I will send all of them down the mountain in a while.\u201dArchean Mountain recruited a total of 21 disciples. Yan Chitong was specially recruited and did not take up any admission slots.Archean Mountain clearly knew that the geniuses this year were more outstanding than in previous years. However, rules were rules. Other than special recruitment, only twenty people were accepted each year. Archean Mountain\u2019s resources were limited. If too many disciples were recruited, the resources that every disciple enjoyed would decrease.\u201cGood, good, good.\u201d Meng Dajiang looked at Meng Chuan happily. \u201cMy son has finally entered Archean Mountain. If your grandaunt learns of this, she would definitely be very happy.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan\u2019s heart churned. After cultivating for so many years, he had finally succeeded in entering the Archean Mountain.\u201cIt\u2019s time for me to leave,\u201d said Meng Dajiang. \u201cMany of Wu State\u2019s geniuses and family will also return today. Uncle Liu and I will also return together. When you enter Archean Mountain and see Qiyue, tell her to send letters to Eastcalm Prefecture in the future.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.The distance between Archean City and Wu State was simply too far away. Marquis Southcloud escorted them here and would also escort them back! This was the fastest method. If they missed this opportunity, Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai would have to return to Eastcalm Prefecture slowly. That would take too long.\u201cCultivate well in Archean Mountain.\u201d Meng Dajiang stretched out his hand and stroked his son\u2019s head. He smiled and said, \u201cDad won\u2019t be able to accompany you any longer. The rest of your journey will depend on yourself.\u201dMeng Chuan\u2019s heart tightened as he nodded.His father had been by his side for so many years. He had enlightened him in the way of the saber and had been his sparring partner. He had prepared rare treasures for him. His father had saved him during the demon invasion. His father was like a huge tree that shielded him from the elements.Now that he had grown up, he would cultivate in Archean Mountain. As for his father, he was in his hometown, thousands of kilometers away.\u201cDad, I\u2019ll make accomplishments in my cultivation as quickly as possible. I\u2019ll head down the mountain to meet you when the time comes,\u201d said Meng Chuan.Meng Dajiang smiled and nodded.Soon\u2014other than the twenty-one newly recruited disciples\u2014the other geniuses and their family and friends were personally sent down the mountain by King East River and brought to Archean City.\u201cAll of you, follow me,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman. She levitated the twenty-one disciples before flying off with them.Whoosh.After they flew past a mountain range, they finally arrived at a towering mountain peak.\u201cThis is Archean Mountain\u2019s main peak\u2014Yellow Reverence Peak. It\u2019s the highest mountain peak in the mountain range.\u201d The cyan-clothed woman led Meng Chuan and company to land in a courtyard.An elder was already waiting in the courtyard. He bowed and greeted, \u201cAunt-Master.\u201dThe twenty-one rookies were somewhat confused. However, Meng Chuan could sense how powerful the elder\u2019s aura was. He was much stronger than Jadesun Palace Lord\u2014who he had seen before. However, he also felt a strange sense of weakness, as though his aura was just a facade.\u201cThis is your Senior Brother Wang,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman. \u201cArchean Mountain Godfiends support each other. Those below the Darkstar realm are of the same generation. You can just address each other as senior and junior. Darkstar Godfiends are Marquis Godfiends.\u201d\u201cGreetings, Senior Brother Wang.\u201d Meng Chuan and the rest bowed.The elder laughed. \u201cGreetings, Junior Brothers and Sisters. It\u2019s a happy occasion to see newcomers every year. Our Archean Mountain will produce more Godfiends.\u201dThe cyan-clothed woman nodded and said, \u201cYou will stay here today. A grand ceremony will be held tomorrow. After that, you will be considered true disciples of Archean Mountain.\u201dWith that said, she walked away.The twenty-one disciples took up temporary residence. They would be official disciples of Archean Mountain tomorrow.\u2026When night fell\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s go. Back to Wu State.\u201dIn the courtyard of the Wu State Guild Hall in Archean City, Marquis Southcloud sat cross-legged on the back of a giant fiery-red bird. Behind him were nine geniuses and their families, as well as Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai. Everyone had just eaten dinner and had enough to fill their stomachs.Whoosh.The giant fiery-red bird soared into the sky, quickly passed through the clouds and flew above the city. Its speed soared as it flew towards Wu State.The geniuses and their families on the bird\u2019s back thought of all sorts of things. Three geniuses from the Wu State had been selected\u2014a very high number. They were Meng Chuan, Yan Jin, and Shangguan Feng. The remaining geniuses who weren\u2019t 20 yet could try again next year. Some of them were already 20 years old. They had to serve in the military immediately since it was already the end of the year.Everyone had their own fate.They flew through the night. It took them nearly six hours to arrive at Wu State.The giant fiery-red bird was roughly 100 feet above the ground when Marquis Southcloud said, \u201cWe\u2019re at Yufang Prefecture. Those who need to get off can get off now.\u201d\u201cThank you, Lord Marquis.\u201d An old woman jumped down with a genius.As a Marquis Godfiend, time was precious. It was only during Archean Mountain\u2019s disciple recruitment that Marquis South Cloud escorted them back and forth, taking up a few days of his time.He continued flying all over Wu State, sending the geniuses and their families and friends back to their prefecture, one after another.\u201cEastcalm Prefecture is up ahead,\u201d Marquis Southcloud said with a smile. The giant fiery-red bird descended to a lower height.\u201cThank you, Lord Marquis.\u201d Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai were grateful for the escort.\u201cBoth Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue are not bad.\u201d Marquis Southcloud gave rare praise.Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai couldn\u2019t hide their smiles. After bowing respectfully, they jumped down to the ground.Whoosh.The giant fiery-red bird quickly rose into the air and flew towards another direction.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go back quickly.\u201d Meng Dajiang couldn\u2019t help but use his movement technique to rush towards Eastcalm City.\u201cLook at how anxious you are.\u201d Liu Yebai followed along.Although the sky was dark, Eastcalm City\u2019s gates had already opened. The hawkers who were selling goods and the travelers had already entered the city. Meng Dajiang and Liu Yebai entered the city together.Oh? Isn\u2019t that Elder Meng?He accompanied Young Master Meng to Archean Mountain for the examination. He\u2019s back?The guards at the door immediately recognized the famous Meng Dajiang from Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201cI won\u2019t be going to the Meng family\u2019s ancestral mansion with you.\u201d Liu Yebai parted with Meng Dajiang midway. \u201cI\u2019ll return to Mirror Lake first.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Meng Dajiang smiled and nodded. Then, he quickly used his movement technique and headed straight for the ancestral mansion.Eh? Meng Dajiang is back?One of the shopkeepers in a street store recognized Meng Dajiang.He\u2019s in a hurry, and he seems rather excited. Furthermore, he came back alone. Could it be that Meng Chuan has joined Archean Mountain? I have to report this to the clan immediately.The Godfiend families had many businesses in Eastcalm Prefecture, and they had many spies. When they saw Meng Dajiang, they immediately rushed back to report.Along the way, people discovered Meng Dajiang. Everyone guessed what happened.If Meng Chuan failed in the assessment, both father and son would have returned together. Furthermore, he wouldn\u2019t rush to the ancestral mansion so excitedly. Of course, these were just guesses. In the end, they had to wait for official news from the government.Meng Dajiang was extremely fast as he rushed to the ancestral mansion.The clansmen at the ancestral mansion were astonished.\u201cElder?\u201d\u201cElder has returned from Archean Mountain. Is there an outcome to Meng Chuan\u2019s entrance examination?\u201d\u201cMeng Chuan didn\u2019t return; did he succeed?\u201dThe clansmen were excited and had many guesses.\u2026At the ancestral mansion\u2019s ancestral hall, Fairy Meng knelt on a prayer mat as she prayed for Meng Chuan. She had been in the ancestral hall since 20th December.She prayed for blessings, hoping that the ancestors would bless Meng Chuan so that he would enter Archean Mountain successfully.\u201cOh?\u201d Fairy Meng suddenly opened her eyes. \u201cDajiang is back?\u201dShe immediately stood up. With a walking stick in hand, her figure blurred as she arrived several dozen feet away. In just a few steps, she arrived at the front yard of the ancestral mansion.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMany clansmen surrounded the front yard. Meng Dajiang\u2014who had been rushing towards this direction\u2014stopped when he saw Fairy Meng.\u201cDajiang, how was it?\u201d Fairy Meng\u2019s pale face was filled with anticipation as her voice trembled slightly.The other clansmen looked at Meng Dajiang expectantly.\u201cChuan\u2019er ranked first in the Archean Mountain entrance examination!\u201d Meng Dajiang said excitedly. \u201cHe\u2019s now an inner sect disciple of Archean Mountain!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It naturally made the clansmen feel extremely proud.\u201cHe ranked first? He entered Archean Mountain?\u201d Fairy Meng felt immense joy when she heard this. \u201cGood, good.\u201dAfter saying just two words, she smiled and slowly walked towards her residence.Too many thoughts arose in her mind. Times when her family seniors taught her when she was a child. Scenes of her Godfiend comrades dying at Calm Sea Pass after she became a Godfiend.I didn\u2019t let down the Meng family\u2019s ancestors. Now, the Meng family has a successor who is ten times, a hundred times more outstanding than me. My old pals, my Meng family descendant has entered Archean Mountain. He will be much more powerful than us in the future. I believe that he will kill more demon monarchs than us.Fairy Meng smiled as she walked towards her small courtyard.\u2026Archean Mountain.Meng Chuan, Yan Jin, Zong Sha, Li Ying, Ji Yuantong, Yan Chitong, and the other disciples were waited upon by servants. After breakfast, they waited for the ceremony to begin patiently.\u201cJunior Brothers and Sisters,\u201d said the elderly Wang with a smile. \u201cThe ceremony is about to begin. Junior Brothers and Sisters, please follow me.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cThe ceremony is about to begin.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to join Archean Mountain officially.\u201dThe twenty-one disciples were filled with excitement and anticipation. Yan Chitong was the happiest. He ran all around barefoot. Since he was the youngest, everyone treated him as their junior brother.The group of people walked up the mountain path to the main peak extremely quickly.\u201cA long time ago, the matriculation ceremony was held in the main hall\u2014Yellow Reverence Hall. However, it has been held at Blood Red Cliff for the past few centuries,\u201d said Wang as he walked ahead.\u201cWhy was it changed?\u201d Yan Chitong asked.Wang pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cYou will know soon.\u201dBlood Red Cliff had lots of empty space. Beside it was a steep cliff. There were already many Godfiends gathered in the empty area.Meng Chuan, Yan Chitong, and the others could only stand aside and wait.\u201cAh Chuan.\u201d A familiar voice rang out.Meng Chuan turned around in surprise and saw Qiyue. After not seeing her for half a year, Qiyue\u2019s aura had changed. She was more energetic, and her aura was stronger.\u201cQiyue,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile.\u201cWe agreed to cultivate together in Archean Mountain,\u201d said Liu Qiyue with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re finally here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. \u201cBy the way, my father and Uncle Liu have returned to Eastcalm Prefecture. If you want to send a letter in the future, send it directly to Eastcalm Prefecture.\u201dLiu Qiyue nodded and immediately instructed, \u201cAfter the matriculation ceremony, they\u2019ll let you choose your own cave abodes. My cave abode is at Bright Scenic Peak. There are two other empty cave abodes there. If you want to choose quickly, choose Bright Scenic Peak.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll remember.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. He was naturally willing to live on the same mountain as Liu Qiyue.As the two chatted, a series of clanging bells sounded. The sound of the bells echoed in all directions.\u201cThe matriculation ceremony is about to begin.\u201d After Liu Qiyue informed Meng Chuan, she immediately walked to the side and stood with the other disciples.The 21 newly-recruited disciples stood elsewhere.Hu! Hu! Hu!Three figures descended. Standing in the middle was a purple-robed, white-haired elder. Beside him were King East River and Elder Yi.\u201cGreetings, Mountain Lord.\u201d Nearly three hundred Godfiends stood and bowed respectfully. There were also some who had yet to become Godfiends like Liu Qiyue.The 21 new disciples bowed as well before standing up.\u201cToday is a good day,\u201d said the purple-robed, white-haired elder with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s the day our Archean Mountain takes in new disciples. I\u2019m always happy to see new disciples join us every year.\u201dThe Godfiends listened.\u201cTwenty-one new disciples.\u201d The purple-robed elder looked at Meng Chuan and company. \u201cThis is Blood Red Cliff. It\u2019s the place where every Archean Mountain Godfiend leaves and takes a commemoration photo after they are done with their cultivation.\u201dAs he spoke, the purple-robed elder waved his hand.Whoosh.Blood Red Cliff\u2019s wall immediately emitted a brilliant glow as numerous Godfiend figures appeared. They all gave off heroic vibes! Some wore armor and carried a blade on their backs, while others wore robes and carried swords on their waists. Some carried bows and quivers on their backs. Every single one of them had smiles on their faces, and their eyes were filled with fighting spirit.\u201cFor Archean Mountain disciples, they can leave the mountain and join the battlefield once they clear the Nine Mystical Caves,\u201d said the purple-robed elder. \u201cThe wall contains a total of 15,271 Godfiends. All of them have protected humans and engaged the demons in battle. Among them, 11,968 have died on the battlefield. More than half of their remains were never found. There are only about 3000 Godfiends left. Although they can retire in peace, all of them choose to spend their lives fighting.\u201cThese are all the Archean Mountain Godfiends who fought with demons all their lives. Apart from that, we humans also have numerous Godfiends from Black Sand Grotto-Heaven and Two World Island. There are also many ordinary Godfiends among the outer sect disciples. They, too, have answered the call of duty.\u201dThe purple-robed elder pointed at these figures. \u201cIn the future, I will also be one of them. You will also be amongst them.\u201dMeng Chuan and the others watched.The ten thousand plus Godfiends were like an army, all filled with fighting spirit.But they were all dead.They dedicated their entire lives for humanity.\u201cThere are nine rules of Archean Mountain. The first rule is not to betray humans. You have to remember that if you dare betray the human race, all Godfiends will hunt you down!\u201d said the purple-robed white-haired elder solemnly. Following that, he said, \u201cNow, new disciples will light up the Soul Lamp.\u201dThe 21 disciples stepped forward.Twenty-one Godfiends each held a Soul Lamp as they walked over.\u201cLet a drop of blood fall on it,\u201d a Godfiend said to Meng Chuan.Meng Chuan extended his finger, and his Quintessential Essence easily tore through his skin. A drop of blood fell onto the Soul Lamp\u2019s core.Pfft.A blood-colored flame lit the lamp\u2019s wick.The 21 disciples lit their Soul Lamps.\u201cSend them to the Soul Lamp Hall,\u201d instructed the purple-robed elder. The Godfiends carried the Soul Lamps to the Soul Lamp Hall immediately. Godfiends engaged in battle outside, and at times, they might die without anyone realizing it. The extinguishing of the Soul Lamp informed people if a Godfiend had perished.Following that, Godfiends came with robes, tokens, and other items before giving them to the new disciples.Meng Chuan and company received them respectfully.The words \u201cMeng Chuan\u201d were written on the cyan token. This was his identity token.I, Meng Chuan, am now a disciple of Archean Mountain.Meng Chuan looked at the countless figures of his predecessors and felt proud being a disciple of Archean Mountain.\u2026After the matriculation ceremony, the new disciples like Meng Chuan began choosing their cave abodes.\u201cEvery disciple can choose a cave abode. The cave abodes are scattered across more than 1000 mountains. You are free to choose. Every cave abode has ten servants. All you need to do is focus on cultivation. Just let the servants deal with miscellaneous matters.\u201d A Godfiend stood in front of a model of the mountain range and said with a smile, \u201cQuickly start picking. There are still thousands of cave abodes left unoccupied.\u201dThe twenty-one disciples changed into their disciple robes and carefully looked at the mountain range model.\u201cI\u2019ll choose the one at East Sandalwood Peak.\u201d Yan Chitong was the first to point at a cave abode on one of the mountains.Meng Chuan took a look and found Bright Scenic Peak. Bright Scenic Peak was one of the more popular mountain peaks\u2014only two cave abodes were empty. \u201cI\u2019ll choose this cave abode at Bright Scenic Peak\u201d Qiyue and Meng Chuan had already made plans.\u201cFluttering Snow Peak, the mountaintop,\u201d said Yan Jin. The cave abodes on Fluttering Snow Peak were all empty because it was too remote.\u201cI\u2019ll also choose Bright Scenic Peak,\u201d said Princess Li Ying.\u201cThunder Roar Peak.\u201d Ji Yuantong pointed at a cave abode.The twenty-one disciples quickly chose their cave abodes.\u201cAll of you are done choosing your cave abodes,\u201d said the cyan-robed woman indifferently as she walked in. \u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s time to choose your Godfiend formulas.\u201dThe disciples followed the cyan-clothed woman.\u201cWhen you were mortal, you only established a Godfiend foundation. That doesn\u2019t make you a true Godfiend,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman. \u201cOnly after passing the Life-and-Death juncture and having condensed a Godfiend body will you be a true Godfiend. Godfiends have different grades as well. Low and middle-grade Godfiends are the most common. When outer sect disciples accumulate enough credit to try their hand at breaking through the Life-and-Death juncture, they are typically low or middle-grade Godfiends because most of them aren\u2019t talented enough, and they are too old. It\u2019s impossible for them to become high-grade Godfiends.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAs for our Archean Mountain disciples, they have to be high-grade or transcendent-grade Godfiends.\u201cIn ten years, if you can\u2019t become a high-grade Godfiend, you will be expelled from the inner sect.\u201d The cyan-clothed woman smiled and said, \u201cOf course, all of you have great potential. Typically, only a handful out of hundreds of disciples are expelled.\u201dThis group of new disciples secretly heaved sighs of relief. Their natural talent was typically enough to reach a high-grade Godfiend.\u201cIn the history of our human race, we have gathered a total of 12 transcendent-grade Godfiend formulas and 27 high-grade Godfiend formulas,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman. \u201cYou need to consider which formula you choose. A Godfiend formula determines your future cultivation path.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Two servants guarded the entrance. When they saw the new arrivals, they immediately bowed respectfully. \u201cGreetings, Lords, and Ladies.\u201dThe servants were all mortals. They managed the daily chores in Archean Mountain, and they greeted all inner sect disciples respectfully.\u201cFollow me in,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman as she walked in.Meng Chuan and the others entered the cave. They arrived inside the belly of the massive mountain. The cave\u2019s walls were decorated with enormous iridescent pearls. Their misty glow illuminated the cave walls\u2014that were carved into enormous bookshelves by the Godfiends. On the bookshelves were rows of books. There were over 10,000 books in the cavern.After the cyan-clothed woman entered, she sat cross-legged on a boulder casually. She looked at Meng Chuan and company and smiled. \u201cYou can just address me as Aunt-Master Qingyu.\u201d\u201cAunt-Master Qingyu,\u201d greeted Meng Chuan and company respectfully.\u201cArchean Mountain disciples need to become transcendent-grade Godfiends or high-grade Godfiends,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman with a smile. \u201cYou have just joined the sect. I believe all of you have great ambition, wishing to become a transcendent-grade Godfiend.\u201dMeng Chuan, Yan Jin, Li Ying, Jin Huan, and Yan Chitong\u2019s eyes lit up.They naturally wanted to become the strongest.\u201cThere are 12 transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies. For example, Thirteen Swordbane Fiend Body, Eon Sea Fiend Body, Azure Lotus Divine Body, etc.\u201d The cyan-clothed woman smiled and shook her head. With a wave of her hand, books flew towards Meng Chuan and company from one of the bookshelves. \u201cAll of you can take a book. Read them carefully. All new disciples have read this book first.\u201dMeng Chuan caught the book.The black book was made of very special material. On the cover were three words: \u201cGodfiend Formula Compilation.\u201d\u201cThis Godfiend Formula Compilation gives a very detailed introduction to the 12 transcendent-grade Godfiend formulas and 27 high-grade Godfiend formulas. Read it first,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman. \u201cThere are many books regarding transcendent-grade and high-grade Godfiend formulas. They have been categorized. You can read them carefully. Think about which Godfiend formulas you want to choose carefully.\u201cAfter all, some Godfiends have extremely powerful vitality. Some are suitable for archers. Some are suitable for close combat, while others are suitable for silent assassinations. If one doesn\u2019t succeed in one strike, one will be able to flee half a thousand kilometers away.\u201cThe Godfiend formula you cultivate will become the path you take for your entire life. You have to consider your choice carefully. Once you have chosen a formula, you\u2019ll have to cultivate using that formula for at least three years. Only if you fail to cultivate the formula will you be able to switch to a new Godfiend formula,\u201d said the cyan-clothed woman. \u201cThink carefully. Even if you spend half a month to consider your choice, it will still be worth it.\u201dMeng Chuan and company naturally understood the importance of choosing a Godfiend formula. All of them sat cross-legged and carefully read the book in their hands.Meng Chuan immediately read the introductions regarding transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies.They were: Thirteen Swordbane Fiend Body, Great Strength Fiend Body, Samsara Divine Body, Azure Lotus Divine Body, Archean Divine Body, Phoenix Divine Body, Dragon Divine Body, Eon Sea Fiend Body, Lightning Devastator Fiend Body, Two World Divine Body, Black Sand Fiend Body, and Indestructible Divine Body. They were all extremely powerful and difficult to cultivate.Thirteen Swordbane Fiend Body was known as the strongest Godfiend body for one-on-one combat. Only mortals who cultivated the Wind Divine Body or Golden Body could cultivate it. They needed to achieve Sword Intent before finding thirteen different baneful auras. Thirteen Swordbanes would form from the thirteen different baneful auras once they have successfully fused with one\u2019s Sword Intent. With the thirteen Swordbanes, one could begin cultivating the Thirteen Swordbane Fiend Body.However, the process of fusing Sword Intent with baneful aura was something many geniuses couldn\u2019t withstand. The baneful aura would enter their brains, making it difficult for them to control themselves. All they could do was nullify the Swordbanes and switch to other Godfiend formulas.Once someone mastered it, they would be skilled with domains. They could use the thirteen Swordbanes to kill enemies several kilometers away! They could also engage in melee combat as well. The thirteen Swordbanes could condense into one, and the sword\u2019s power was inconceivable.In a one-on-one fight, their opponent wouldn\u2019t be able to touch them. They could attack from afar with the Swordbanes. The Thirteen Swordbane Fiend Body was also terrifying in melee combat. Thus it was indeed the strongest Godfiend body for one-on-one battles.\u2026Great Strength Fiend Body had the greatest strength amongst the transcendent-grade Fiend Bodies! When standing on the ground, one\u2019s strength was unimaginable. One\u2019s strength would be halved if they were in the air. Even at half strength, it was still the strongest among all the Godfiend bodies. From this, one could see how strong one would be on land.Only those who cultivated the Golden Divine Body or the Earth Divine Body could cultivate it\u2026\u2026Phoenix Divine Body was the most terrifying among transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies when it came to an all-out battle. By burning one\u2019s lifeforce to use Phoenix\u2019s Nirvana, its power stood atop all Godfiends. However, the price was immense. An expert with a Phoenix Divine Body wouldn\u2019t use this technique unless they were in a dire situation.This Godfiend body formula could only be cultivated by someone who had awakened a phoenix bloodline.\u2026The Dragon Divine Body was similar to the Phoenix Divine Body. It could only be cultivated by someone who had awakened a dragon god bloodline.Godfiend Bodies which required bloodlines were limited to the Phoenix Divine Body and the Dragon Divine Body. Since bloodlines could be inherited, humans hoped for the Phoenix Divine Body Godfiends and Dragon Divine Body Godfiends to have more children.\u2026Every formula had stringent requirements that had to be met before one could begin cultivating them.There are only two transcendent-grade formulas that are suitable for me\u2014Lightning Devastator Fiend Body and Eon Sea Fiend Body.Meng Chuan flipped through the book in his hand.Eh, Lightning Devastator Fiend Body seems to have the same name as the Lightning Devastator Saber art. Could they be related?Meng Chuan smiled and carefully read the descriptions regarding the two transcendent-grade Godfiend Bodies.\u2026The Lightning Devastator Fiend Body was the fastest amongst transcendent-grade Fiend bodies. They could release lightning and baneful auras from afar. They could also kill enemies in melee combat. Their strikes were as fast as lightning, making them a force to be reckoned.By relying on speed, they could commit terrifying massacres.The Lightning Devastator Fiend Body required mortals to cultivate the Lightning Divine Body. One also needed to reach the Realm of Intent. Once one was prepared enough, they would draw seven bolts of heavenly lightning into their body. They would then enter the Godfiend Blood Pool, use the heavenly lightning to refine their bodies\u2014that were filled with baneful aura\u2014and attain the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body. One required a robust foundation, Intent, and baneful aura\u2014which was difficult to find\u2014to cultivate the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body.But that wasn\u2019t all. The most dangerous thing was the baneful aura. If one couldn\u2019t withstand the baneful aura, it would cause chaos in one\u2019s mind. Furthermore, they had to challenge the Life-and-Death juncture whilst doing all this. If one\u2019s body wasn\u2019t strong enough, they would be blasted into smithereens by the seven bolts of lightning.\u2026Eon Sea Fiend Body.Meng Chuan looked at the other Godfiend body he could cultivate.The Eon Sea Fiend Body was skilled with domains. With a wave of a hand, one could envelop a half-kilometer area. They would have plenty of Quintessential Essence and tremendous strength. They enjoyed high recovery speed and strong vitality. Even if one was injured, they could recover rapidly. Even severed arms and legs could be regenerated.Only those who cultivated in the Water Divine Body or Lightning Divine Body during the mortal realms could cultivate it\u2026Oh?Meng Chuan frowned.The speed of the Eon Sea Fiend Body can only be considered ordinary?The Eon Sea Fiend Body was very powerful.It had control over a domain, immense strength and vitality, and endless Quintessential Essence. However, speed was not its forte.\u2026Eon Sea Fiend Body.Chu Yong\u2019s eyes lit up as he read the book.He had become famous across the world when he was young. He was the number one genius in the imperial capital.Why was he so famous? It was partly because of his family clan. The Chu family was one of the top family clans in the Great Zhou Dynasty. The family clan had a Regis Godfiend.Therefore, he had long learned some basic information about the twelve transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies.I cultivated the Water Divine Body and began drawing upon some lightning to temper my body in preparation for the Eon Sea Fiend Body.Chu Yong\u2019s eyes were filled with anticipation.Once I master the Eon Sea Fiend Body, my strength will be extremely great. My Quintessential Essence will be boundless, and I\u2019ll be almost indestructible. I won\u2019t be afraid of anyone in a direct battle. Even if there\u2019s an internecine outcome, I\u2019ll be up for the battle anytime.He would quickly recover from any injuries. Even if his arms and legs were severed, it would only take some time for him to recover. As for the internecine outcome? Experts with Eon Sea Fiend Bodies enjoyed such battles the most because it was very difficult to kill them.\u2026The 21 disciples carefully read through the book. Apart from the geniuses from the top family clans who already knew a little about them, the disciples were learning about transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies for the first time, including Meng Chuan.There are 27 high-grade Godfiend bodies. There are six that are suitable for me.Meng Chuan flipped through the pages.Among them, the Mirage Fiend Body, Sanguine Divine Body, and Myriad Poisons Fiend Body can be cultivated by everyone. There\u2019s also the Wind Lightning Divine Body, Phantom Fiend Body, and Lightning Water Fiend Body that are suitable for me.Time passed by quickly.Meng Chuan and company went to the bookshelf to search for more detailed books. After sitting on the boulder for a while, the cyan-clothed woman silently left the cave.\u2026Eastcalm Prefecture.The Meng family clan members were extremely excited as they flaunted Meng Chuan\u2019s status as an Archean Mountain inner sect disciple. They even talked about how he came in first at the entrance examination. However, the other Godfiend family clans in Eastcalm Prefecture continued waiting. Only when the government officials announced the news did they believe it.\u201cAn inner sect disciple of Archean Mountain? He even got first in the entrance examination?\u201d\u201cHe ranked first amongst all the geniuses of the Great Zhou Dynasty? This Meng Chuan is too amazing.\u201d\u201cWill Meng Chuan become a Marquis Godfiend in the future? Our Eastcalm Prefecture hasn\u2019t produced a Marquis Godfiend in thousands of years, right?\u201dThe city was filled with discussions.Meng Chuan had become Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s pride. Meng Chuan was native to the Eastcalm Prefecture, and the people from his hometown were naturally proud of his achievements.Inside the Yun family estate.Bam! Bam! Bam!Yun Qingping\u2014who was practicing her swordplay\u2014heard porcelain shattering in her father\u2019s study. She could not help but shake her head gently. After experiencing the demon invasion, Yun Qingping had matured a lot. She felt like her father was incomparably inferior to her First and Second Uncle.Since the engagement has been annulled, what was there to regret? What use is there regretting their actions now?\u201cScram!\u201d Yun Fu\u2019an stormed out of the study angrily. He shouted at the servants outside the study and strode out.In fact, Yun Fu\u2019an didn\u2019t feel regret. He felt embarrassed!In Eastcalm Prefecture, all the other Godfiend family clans think of me as a joke.Yun Fu\u2019an fumed.Man cannot always be fortunate. Who knows what will happen in the future? Perhaps when Meng Chuan becomes a Godfiend, he will perish together with a demon monarch?Although he still tried his best to please the Meng family on the surface and worked hard to reestablish ties, Yun Fu\u2019an still hoped that both the Meng family and Meng Chuan would fall one day.Of course, he didn\u2019t act on these thoughts.\u2026Discussions filled the entire city.However, Fairy Meng\u2019s yard in the Meng family ancestral mansion was very quiet.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFairy Meng sat at a desk and wrote a letter.Cough! Cough! Cough!Death colored Fairy Meng\u2019s face. She coughed into her left hand\u2014that was now covered in black and red bloodstains. Her face turned red from all the coughing, but she continued writing.She finished writing the letter. It was addressed to Meng Chuan. After all, she would never be able to see him again.I\u2019m afraid my body won\u2019t last past tonight.Fairy Meng looked outside. She could vaguely hear laughter in the ancestral mansion\u2014the clansmen were extremely happy.I, Meng Yan, became a Godfiend and killed demon monarchs. I managed to see my descendant, Meng Chuan, become an inner sect disciple of Archean Mountain before I died. I have no regrets left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - CreditPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93: CreditCKtalonThe new disciples read through the books in the library cave ravenously. For example, those who cultivated the Water Divine Body could choose from six transcendent-grade Godfiend formulas. Yan Jin\u2014who cultivated the Icefire Divine Body\u2014had four transcendent-grade Godfiend formulas to choose from: the Two World Divine Body, the Azure Lotus Divine Body, the Samsara Divine Body, and the Archean Divine Body.The Archean Divine Body was created by Archean Mountain\u2019s founder. Black Sand Grotto-Heaven and Two World Island also had transcendent-grade Godfiend formulas created by their founders.Other powerful Godfiends from history created the nine other transcendent-grade formulas.In terms of cultivation difficulty, there was no need to elaborate on the Dragon Divine Body and Phoenix Divine Body. It was easy once a bloodline was awakened, but without a bloodline, one wouldn\u2019t be able to cultivate those Godfiend bodies.There were ten remaining Godfiend bodies.Great Strength Fiend Body, Thirteen Swordbane Fiend Body, Lightning Devastator Fiend Body, Archean Divine Body, and Samsara Divine Body. These five Godfiend bodies were similar in difficulty in regards to cultivating them.The Azure Lotus Divine Body, Indestructible Divine Body, Eon Sea Fiend Body, Black Sand Fiend Body, and Two World Divine Body were one level lower in difficulty, but their strength wasn\u2019t much weaker. Therefore, more people chose the latter five Godfiend bodies.\u2026However, Meng Chuan was not stumped.There\u2019s no need to choose high-grade Godfiend bodies. Mirage Fiend Body controls the enemy\u2019s consciousness. Sanguine Divine Body\u2019s cultivation is the most painful. The Myriad Poisons Fiend Body requires one to study various poisons. These aren\u2019t suitable for me as a saber user.Lightning Water Fiend Body, Wind Lightning Divine Body, and Phantom Fiend Body are too inferior to the two transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies.I can only choose from the two transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies. The Eon Sea Fiend Body is good at frontal assaults but is average when it comes to speed. I\u2019ve been learning the swift saber from a young age, so how can I give it up?That\u2019s why I only have one option\u2014the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body.This suited him the best.After making his decision, Meng Chuan continued reading the books. Reading could broaden one\u2019s horizons.For example, the Body Tempering Godfiend lineage was introduced in the books. The demons had started invading 800 years ago.Humans realized that demons were generally stronger than humans in terms of physical bodies. Although human Godfiends were not inferior to demon monarchs in strength, their bodies were generally weaker.Therefore, some powerful human Godfiends began attempting to create a Body Tempering Godfiend lineage. They wanted their bodies to match divine armaments and treasures, but these attempts had only gone on for a few centuries. The formulas were extremely incomplete. The theoretical limit was the Great Solar realm. Most people who were Body Tempering Godfiends failed to reach the Great Solar realm. Furthermore, one expended large amounts of treasures and resources. Therefore, the three large sects strictly prohibited inner sect disciples from becoming Body Tempering Godfiends. It was, at best, left to a few outer sect disciples as test subjects.Godfiends had five realms. Meng Chuan saw a detailed description about Godfiends.Core Cloud, Indestructible, Great Solar, Darkstar, and Incessant. Darkstar Godfiends are Marquis Godfiends. Incessant Godfiends are Regis Godfiends.Core Cloud, Indestructible, Great Solar\u2026 There\u2019s still a chance for someone to fight an opponent at a higher level at these three realms. However, it\u2019s impossible for a Great Solar Godfiend to fight against a Darkstar Godfiend. It would be amazing if they came out alive. The difference between the two realms is too great. It\u2019s very difficult to break through the Great Solar realm to the Darkstar realm. It\u2019s even harder than becoming a Godfiend.Meng Chuan was very shocked when he read this.The Great Solar realm was just too inferior to the Darkstar realm.The difficulty of breaking through was ridiculously high.There were very few Godfiends in the Great Solar realm. For instance, Fairy Meng, Yun Wanhai, and many other outer sect disciples would not be able to reach the Great Solar realm their entire lives. As for Archean Mountain\u2019s inner sect disciples\u2014as long as they didn\u2019t die\u2014most would become Great Solar Godfiends. However, only one in fifteen Great Solar Godfiends could become Darkstar Godfiends. The ratio of successful breakthroughs was simply too low.Mortal Core Condensation experts had a low chance of breaking through because they didn\u2019t have the chance to enter the Godfiend Blood Pool. If everyone had the chance to enter the Godfiend Blood Pool to challenge the Life-and-Death juncture, there would have been far more Godfiends.In contrast, breaking through from the Great Solar realm to the Darkstar realm was just too difficult.Essence Soul?Meng Chuan\u2019s heart suddenly stirred.Many thresholds obstructed one from reaching the Darkstar realm. One of them was the Essence Soul. Only by condensing an Essence Soul would one have a chance of becoming a Darkstar Godfiend. Otherwise, there was no hope for their entire lives. Many Great Solar Godfiends were stuck at this step.What\u2019s an Essence Soul?The book\u2019s description is too vague.After reading the passage, Meng Chuan was filled with puzzlement. He continued to search for other books and read them.However, there were very few books that talked about the Essence Soul. Meng Chuan read more than a hundred books. He read through all the books related to the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body, but he failed to find a detailed description regarding the Essence Soul.It\u2019s been an entire day.Meng Chuan looked outside the cave. The sky had lit up again. He walked up to Yan Jin and gently nudged him.Yan Jin raised his head and glanced at Meng Chuan before lowering his head to continue reading. \u201cGo back first. I haven\u2019t decided on a transcendent-grade Godfiend body.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded.Yan Jin had four transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies that he could choose, unlike himself\u2014who had made a decision early on.After Meng Chuan left the library, there were still eighteen people in the cave who continued reading. They didn\u2019t know which Godfiend body to choose. These new disciples didn\u2019t want to sleep at all. It was easy for them to last a few days and nights without sleep. After all, servants delivered them food and water.Swoosh.Meng Chuan strolled around Yellow Reverence Peak quickly. Soon, he arrived in front of a towering building. There were eight floors to the building and many servants.\u201cI\u2019m here to obtain my pill and treasure quota for this month.\u201d Meng Chuan walked over. A cyan-robed man stood in front of the counter. He smiled and said, \u201cLord Meng, may I have your identity token.\u201dMeng Chuan took out his identity token.After the cyan-robed man received it, a servant quickly delivered a black wooden box. The identity token made contact with the black wooden box. Quintessential Essence flowed into the box, causing it to open automatically.\u201cLord Meng Chuan, you came first at the entrance examination this year. The Mountain Lord has specially approved of you receiving the highest grades of pills and treasures among all the disciples. You will receive ten Thousand Star Pills and 3000 credits every month. You will receive one Lightning Tribulation Fruit every half-year.\u201d The cyan-robed man smiled as he took out a black book and handed it to Meng Chuan. \u201cCredits can be exchanged for any treasure. The exact prices for such exchanges are in this book.\u201dMeng Chuan flipped it open.The pills that he needed to consume for extended periods were considered cheap. They could be exchanged for a few credits. For example, one Thousand Star Pill would require fifty credits.As for rare treasures, they were much more precious. An Iceheart Fruit could be exchanged for 38,000 credits. One drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid could be exchanged for 102,000 credits. An Astral Spirit Herb could be exchanged for 50,000 credits. Archean Mountain only had two Astral Spirit Herbs currently. Of course, other natural treasures could be used to forge a robust Godfiend foundation.Pills, rare treasures, and even all the baneful auras in the world can be exchanged. Oh?When Meng Chuan flipped to the back, his eyes lit up.Archean Mountain actually has so many special cultivation grounds.One had to use credits if they wanted to cultivate in the special cultivation grounds. For example, the Darkness Altar had the effect of tempering one\u2019s will. Ascending the Darkness Altar once required 100 credits. The Earth Magnetic baneful Aura Pool required 100 credits for one day of cultivation. The Myriad Poison Pit required 300 credits for one day of cultivation.\u2026This was because cultivating in these places drained the lands. For example, baneful aura, rare poisons, and even the mysterious black fog from the Darkness Altar would be consumed when cultivating. The higher one ascended the altar, the more black fog drained. Reaching the peak of the Darkness Altar drained a ridiculous amount of black fog. Once a disciple reached the summit, Archean Mountain would forbid disciples from climbing it again.Therefore, Archean Mountain disciples used their credits to exchange for various cultivation resources. These were handed out by Archean Mountain every month.\u201cEvery month, treasures and credits are distributed. Archean Mountain will hand them out for twenty years without any compensation needed,\u201d said the cyan-robed man with a smile. \u201cIf you can pass the Nine Mystical Caves in a decade, you will be able to leave the mountain. The remaining ten years\u2019 worth of treasures and credits will be given to you in one go.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded slightly. They didn\u2019t need to serve in the military. They didn\u2019t need to risk their lives; instead they cultivated in a safe environment. However, this was the only peaceful period they had after becoming Godfiends. Once they passed the Nine Mystical Caves, they would begin protecting humanity.\u201cLord Meng Chuan, you still have 185,200 credits under your name,\u201d the cyan-robed man said.\u201cI have that much?\u201d Meng Chuan was stunned. He received the greatest quota of treasures and credits every month. But, that only amounted to 3,000 credits every month, and 36,000 per annum.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGodfiend Meng Yan transferred all 182,200 credits under her name to you,\u201d said the cyan-robed man.\u201cGrandaunt?\u201d Meng Chuan fell silent. He remembered his grandaunt mentioning that she would transfer her credits to him.This was his grandaunt\u2019s accumulated credits after eighty years as a Godfiend. It probably included the credits received from Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s demon invasion. Only after all those bloody battles had she accumulated this many credits.\u201cBy the way, there\u2019s a letter from your family, Lord Meng Chuan.\u201d The cyan-robed man handed a letter to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - Everyone Has Their Fate (Final Chapter of Volume)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94: Everyone Has Their Fate (Final Chapter of Volume)CKtalonLetter from my family?Meng Chuan took the letter and looked at it.It\u2019s from Dad? Dad left two days ago. Why did he send a letter so soon?He had a vague suspicion about what the letter was about. He didn\u2019t read it immediately. Instead, he first took the pills, treasures, and the black book and returned to his cave abode.Ever since he became an Archean Mountain disciple, he had been reading the books in the library the entire time. He hadn\u2019t gone to his cave abode at all.\u2026On Bright Scenic Peak, in a remote area, Meng Chuan sat alone on a large rock as he watched the vast sea of clouds floating past the mountain peaks. The peaks were perennially covered in snow.Grandaunt has passed away.Meng Chuan put away his father\u2019s letter\u2014it simply informed him about what happened.On the morning of 23rd December, his father rushed back to Eastcalm Prefecture. He told his clansmen and Fairy Meng the news.His grandaunt was already heavily injured. When the demons invaded, she had used all her strength. Her body had already been in a terrible state for half a year. However, because of her obsession, she persevered until she received news of Meng Chuan being admitted into Archean Mountain. Once she learned of this news, she felt relaxed and happy. Her obsession disappeared, and her body quickly collapsed.That night\u2014after his grandaunt gave the clansmen some final instructions\u2014she passed away with a smile.There were two letters. One was from his father, and the other was from his grandaunt.Meng Chuan gently unfolded his grandaunt\u2019s letter.\u201cMeng Chuan, I\u2019m very happy to know that you took first place in Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination. I won\u2019t be able to see you anymore. My passing will happen tonight. Whatever I want to say will be written in this letter. Your future far exceeds mine. I can only give you some advice as a Godfiend with eighty years of experience.\u201cFirst, rely on your comrades when you are on the battlefield. During life-and-death battles, one move from your comrades might save your life. Don\u2019t be rash just because you are strong. \u201cSecond, always hide your killer moves. Even when killing enemies, try to keep them a secret. The demons are collecting intelligence on the Godfiends. When all your secrets are exposed, you will be in danger. Do not tell a person anything about your best skills. Telling a second person will result in there being a third, tenth person, and more knowing about it.\u201cAlthough most human Godfiends fight for humanity, there are still traitors. They will collude with the demons if there are certain benefits. Make sure not to expose too much of your skill. Keep your true strength secret.\u201cThirdly, the stronger you are, the more confident you will be on the battlefield. However, never be too relaxed. Seize the opportunity to make yourself as strong as possible while you are on Archean Mountain. The stronger you are, the better! I have seen too many Godfiends die. Remember, the stronger you are, the better.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to mourn me. I started life as someone insignificant. By the time I comprehended Force when I was 22, I didn\u2019t even have the right to participate in Archean Mountain\u2019s entrance examination. I was just an outer sect disciple. After experiencing a close shave with death and with enough luck, I became a Godfiend. My companions have often blocked the enemy for me, allowing me to live this day after eighty years as a Godfiend.\u201cI led the declining Meng family to rise once again, making it one of the five Godfiend family clans in Eastcalm Prefecture. I managed to see you enter Archean Mountain before I die. I really have no regrets.\u201cA Godfiend\u2019s path is very difficult. You have to tread carefully. If possible, kill more demon monarchs! Give me something to boast about to my old friends when I\u2019m in the underworld.\u201dMeng Chuan felt pain as he read the letter. He knew his grandaunt had passed away in gratification, but he felt terrible.She had used the family\u2019s savings and exchanged it for a drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid. She had also transferred all the credits she had amassed over her eighty-year Godfiend career so that he could cultivate faster in Archean Mountain.She handed everything to him.Grandaunt, I\u2019ll lead our family well.Meng Chuan\u2019s eyes were slightly red. He looked at the vast sea of clouds and softly said, \u201cI\u2019ll remember your three pieces of advice. Also, I\u2019ll kill more demon monarchs. Grandaunt, rest in peace.\u201dMeng Chuan looked east. He seemed to see his hometown where his grandaunt had passed away.His grandaunt was gone! Godfiend Meng Yan\u2014who had spent her entire life protecting the human race\u2014was dead! Compared to her companions, she was very lucky. She was able to return to her hometown and see a talented junior. She had her clansmen by her side when she died.\u2026Meng Chuan continued to read books in the library for the next few days. Although he had already decided to cultivate the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body, he still read through the books about the Eon Sea Fiend Body, Wind Lightning Divine Body, Sanguine Divine Body, and other Godfiend bodies.After reading them, he headed for the Impartation Pavilion.\u201cHave you already made up your mind?\u201d Elder Yi looked at Meng Chuan. \u201cOnce you make your choice, you can\u2019t choose another Godfiend body formula for three years.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. \u201cLightning Devastator Fiend Body.\u201d Even if he failed to cultivate the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body, he would choose the high-grade formula, Wind Lightning Divine Body. As for the Eon Sea Fiend Body, it was just not compatible with his style.\u201cAlright.\u201d Elder Yi nodded slightly. With a wave of his hand, a black book flew down from the bookshelf beside him. Lightning swirled on the book\u2019s surface, and black fumes churned. \u201cThis is the cultivation formula for the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body. Memorize it here. Hand it to me after you are done.\u201dMeng Chuan took the thick book and sat down cross-legged by the side. He flipped the book open. There were text and diagrams in the book. Lightning and baneful aura surrounded each page. As Meng Chuan immersed himself in reading, his consciousness sank into the book.His surroundings blurred.Soon, he saw a tall man with disheveled hair sitting in the lotus position. He was identical to the imposing man in the Lightning Devastator Saber fragment he had.Thick baneful aura emanated from his body. The black fog billowed in all directions as lightning curled around his body.He suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes met Meng Chuan\u2019s, and large amounts of information surged into his mind.It was a detailed instructional guide about cultivating the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body. It was identical to what the text and diagrams in the book described. However, many cultivation scenes were demonstrated by the man personally. Furthermore, they were deeply imprinted in Meng Chuan\u2019s memory.After a long while, Meng Chuan came back to reality.\u201cYou must be done.\u201d Elder Yi waved his hand and put away the thick book.Meng Chuan couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cThis is only the basics of the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body. It only contains information about the Core Cloud, Indestructible, and Great Solar realms. There\u2019s nothing beyond that.\u201d\u201cThis is the first volume of the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body formula. The information regarding the Darkstar realm and higher realms are in the second volume,\u201d said Elder Yi with a smile.\u201cWhere\u2019s the second volume?\u201d Meng Chuan asked.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to learn it even if it\u2019s placed in front of you,\u201d said Elder Yi with a smile. \u201cYou have to wait until you condense an Essence Soul before you can receive the second volume\u2019s legacy.\u201d\u201cElder, what\u2019s an Essence Soul?\u201d asked Meng Chuan immediately. He had read many books in the library, and the only thing he knew regarding an Essence Soul was that it was a key requirement to become a Darkstar Godfiend.Elder Yi smiled and said, \u201cHumans have souls. They live in the sea of consciousness between the eyebrows. However, it can\u2019t be observed or sensed. If one attains certain success in soul cultivation, it will condense into an Essence Soul. One can then view their soul with their inner vision. Only by becoming a Great Solar Godfiend can an Archean Mountain disciple learn Essence Soul cultivation methods. Even if it\u2019s given to you now, you won\u2019t be able to cultivate the soul.\u201dMeng Chuan\u2019s heart palpitated.Humans had souls that resided in the sea of consciousness between their eyebrows? Can\u2019t be seen or sensed? By condensing an Essence Soul, one could see their souls through their inner vision?The tiny person in between my eyebrows is an Essence Soul?Meng Chuan couldn\u2019t help but guess.From what Elder Yi said, Archean Mountain\u2019s Essence Cultivation methods can only be cultivated after becoming a Great Solar Godfiend.\u201cThe demons are also exploring the Essence Soul\u2019s secrets. Therefore, you must keep it a secret if you learn secrets about the Essence Soul,\u201d said Elder Yi. \u201cOnce you leak such knowledge, you will be viewed as a traitor.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. \u201cOnly a Great Solar Godfiend can cultivate an Essence Soul?\u201d\u201cSouls are within us when we are born,\u201d said Elder Yi. \u201cSome people are born with weak souls, and others are born with strong souls. In fact, there are people in history who were born with Essence Souls. Of course, if such geniuses appear, the demons will definitely risk their lives to assassinate them. In the past three thousand years, we humans have never heard of anyone born with an Essence Soul. All of them cultivated their souls after becoming a Great Solar Godfiend. After years of hard work, they would condense an Essence Soul.\u201cMany Great Solar Godfiends are stuck at the Essence Soul Condensation stage. It prevents them from breaking through to the Darkstar realm. It\u2019s pointless asking so much now. It\u2019s still too early for you.\u201d Elder Yi waved his hand again; ten stacked books flew over.\u201cThese ten books contain insights from Archean Mountain disciples\u2014who cultivated the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body\u2014over the years. They are extremely detailed. They will almost answer all the questions you will have during cultivation.\u201d Elder Yi handed the ten books to Meng Chuan. \u201cTake these ten books back, but don\u2019t bring them down the mountain.\u201d With that said, he closed his eyes to meditate.\u201cYes.\u201d Meng Chuan accepted it respectfully. \u201cI\u2019ll take my leave.\u201dFollowing that, he left the Impartation Pavilion.After Meng Chuan left, Elder Yi opened his eyes and looked into the distance. He whispered, \u201cHis spiritual perception is very high, one that appears once every few centuries. Could he have an inborn Essence Soul? Perhaps I\u2019m overthinking things. Whatever, I told him everything I needed to.\u201d Elder Yi closed his eyes.\u2026In the past 3,000 years, we haven\u2019t heard of anybody with inborn Essence Souls. All Godfiends cultivated their souls after entering the Great Solar realm.Meng Chuan\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but palpitate with fear after leaving the Impartation Pavilion.If the demons learn of this, they will spare no expense to assassinate them?Thankfully, I listened to Grandaunt. I didn\u2019t use the Power of the Soul during the entrance examination or in front of others.However, did Elder Yi tell me this deliberately? Or was it unintentional? No, Elder Yi is a Regis Godfiend, a backbone of the human race. He has been fighting for humanity his whole life. He\u2019s reaching the end of his life, so there\u2019s no need to doubt his loyalty. Regardless of whether he did it intentionally or not, it\u2019s out of good intentions.\u2026Meng Chuan chose his Godfiend body much earlier than the other disciples. The other geniuses began making their choices one after another.\u201cI choose the Great Strength Fiend Body,\u201d said Ji Yuantong respectfully.\u201cJi Yuantong, you come from the Ji family. You should know what it means to stop at the 17th step of the Darkness Altar,\u201d Elder Yi said.Ji Yuantong bowed his head. \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cYour will is weak, but you are extremely outstanding in other aspects. That\u2019s why Archean Mountain gave you a chance,\u201d Elder Yi said. \u201cHowever, if you can\u2019t make up for your lacking willpower, you will never hope of reaching the Great Solar realm.\u201dJi Yuantong fell silent. It would be disgraceful if he didn\u2019t become a Great Solar Godfiend.\u201cTherefore, Archean Mountain has decided that you shall head down the mountain and go to Cloud Solar Pass after you memorize the Godfiend body formula. You will be part of the suicide squad, and you shall serve the military for a year,\u201d said Elder Yi. \u201cI hope that you can temper your will on the battlefield through life-and-death situations. One year later, you can return to Archean Mountain.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ji Yuantong didn\u2019t hesitate at all. He really wanted to make up for this flaw.After Ji Yuantong received the Great Strength Fiend Body legacy, he left the mountain and headed for Cloud Solar Pass immediately.The suicide squad encountered the most danger at the city gates; their death ratios were the highest. Ji Yuantong had to stay there for a year. This was just the first phase of Archean Mountain\u2019s plan for Ji Yuantong. Unless his willpower was sufficient, there were still multiple things awaiting him\u2026As a genius that Archean Mountain valued, they focused on nurturing and letting him grow.\u2026\u201cI choose the Azure Lotus Divine Body,\u201d said Yan Jin when he arrived at the Impartation Pavilion.\u201cI choose the Two World Divine Body.\u201d The thirteen-year-old Yan Chitong made his choice.\u201cBlack Sand Fiend Body,\u201d told Zuo Xiao to Elder Yi.\u201cI choose the Archean Divine Body.\u201d Princess Li Ying eventually made her choice.\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe geniuses had chosen their future paths. However\u2014according to history\u2014most of them would fail to cultivate a transcendent-grade Godfiend body. In three years, most of them would switch to high-grade Godfiend bodies. This was because there was a common threshold for transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies\u2014the Realm of Intent. Achieving Intent within three years was what stopped most new disciples.Each had their own fates.No one could tell how far these new disciples would grow.Final Chapter of Volume\u2014Archean MountainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had yet to choose a saber art from Archean Mountain! This was because he had officially accepted a master today. It wasn\u2019t too late for him to choose a saber art after listening to his master\u2019s guidance.\u201cAh Chuan, Ah Chuan.\u201d A familiar voice came from outside.\u201cQiyue.\u201d Meng Chuan sheathed his saber and walked out of the training grounds. He saw Liu Qiyue running into his residence. Since the servants had received Meng Chuan\u2019s instructions, they naturally didn\u2019t stop her.\u201cAh Chuan, let\u2019s go. You\u2019re officially accepting a master today,\u201d said Liu Qiyue.\u201cI\u2019ve been practicing for two hours. I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d Meng Chuan smiled as he walked out with Liu Qiyue.The duo walked alongside Bright Scenic Peak\u2019s mountain path. Before they walked far, they saw the white-robed Princess Li Ying walk out of her cave abode.Li Ying smiled as she walked over. \u201cSenior Brother Meng, Senior Sister Liu, what a coincidence.\u201dSeeing how close Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue were, Li Ying maintained a smile. She knew that Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue were childhood sweethearts. They didn\u2019t have any blood relations, but Li Ying still felt like she had a chance! Li Ying was destined to be a powerful Godfiend. Regardless of whether it was from the bottom of her heart or from the imperial family\u2019s internal competition, she wanted to find a Godfiend husband that was stronger than her.Meng Chuan matched Li Ying\u2019s ideal.Initially, Li Ying wanted to interact with Meng Chuan more and see if their personalities matched. To her surprise, Meng Chuan cultivated daily. Whenever she visited Meng Chuan, she would often encounter Liu Qiyue.Her plans were thwarted from the beginning!\u201cJunior Sister Li,\u201d greeted Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue with a smile.\u201cToday, we will officially be acknowledging our master.\u201d Li Ying followed them. \u201cDo you know how impressive our master is?\u201dLiu Qiyue smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been here for over half a year now. I do know a little. Master has been the master of all recruited disciples of Archean Mountain for the past three centuries.\u201dMeng Chuan was shocked when he heard that. \u201cTwenty disciples are accepted every year. Six thousand disciples share the same master?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Liu Qiyue nodded.When it came to Godfiend lifespans, the lifespan of Core Cloud, Indestructible, and Great Solar Godfiends was 200 years, twice a mortal\u2019s lifespan. There were very few mortals who could live past a hundred years. Many died when they were seventy or eighty years old. Fairy Meng had been 110 years old\u2026 Godfiends often engaged in battles, and their bodies were damaged after many years. It was rare for them to live to 200.Darkstar Godfiends had a lifespan of 300 years. From their lifespan, one could tell that it was a qualitative breakthrough from the Great Solar realm to the Darkstar realm.Regis Godfiends had a maximum lifespan of 500 years.\u201cMaster\u2019s status is extremely high. When Mountain Lord Lian and Elder Yi see him, they have to address him as Supremacy respectfully,\u201d said Liu Qiyue.\u201cYes.\u201d Princess Li Ying smiled and said, \u201cMaster is an existence that transcends Regis Godfiends.\u201dMeng Chuan was shocked.Transcends Regis Godfiends?He had read many books in the library, but none of them mentioned such things. He only had vague suspicions that there were existences that surpassed Regis Godfiends.\u201cMaster\u2019s lifespan is long. With him around, Archean Mountain is impregnable,\u201d said Princess Li Ying with a smile. \u201cDid you know that the most important city pass out of seven major city passes in the Great Zhou Dynasty\u2014Luotang Pass\u2014is guarded by a Supremacy?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue learned something new.They knew that there were many passes in the Great Zhou Dynasty. Qinyang Pass\u2014which was very close to Eastcalm Prefecture\u2014was a relatively ordinary city pass! There were nine similar city passes in the Wu State. There were even more across the entire world.However, there were few passes that were truly famous throughout the world. There were seven major city passes in the Great Zhou Dynasty. Calm Sea Pass and Luotang Pass were ranked among them. He had known Luotang Pass was the most important of the seven major city passes and occupied the largest area\u2014almost comparable to Archean City\u2014but he hadn\u2019t known that it was presided over by an existence that surpassed Regis Godfiends.\u2026They chatted along the way. The trio soon arrived at Yellow Reverence Peak\u2019s Grotto-Heaven Pavilion.Grotto-Heaven Pavilion was very spartan. There were many prayer mats on the ground. Many disciples had already sat down.\u201cLord Meng Chuan, please sit here.\u201d There was a steward in the Grotto-Heaven Pavilion who ushered the new disciples to their seats. There was also a reason for the seating plan. Those who were given a higher evaluation according to Archean Mountain\u2019s internal tests, sat closer to the front.Meng Chuan also sat down on the mat.\u201cAh Chuan.\u201d Liu Qiyue also sat in her seat. She was seated to Meng Chuan\u2019s left. Clearly, she had been arranged to sit in front. On the contrary, Princess Li Ying could only sit behind them.Whoosh.Suddenly, a youth\u2014dressed in a white robe with a sword by his waist\u2014walked in. The entire building fell silent.\u201cAh Chuan, look. That\u2019s the fifth son of King Calm Sea, Xue Feng,\u201d said Liu Qiyue immediately via voice transmission.It\u2019s him?Meng Chuan carefully observed. He could perceive a powerful aura emanating from the youth in the white robe. He was stronger than Jadesun Palace Lord. Jadesun Palace Lord had already passed the Nine Mystical Caves and left Archean Mountain. However, this man was stronger than him, yet he hadn\u2019t left the mountain. Meng Chuan also knew that the requirements for disciples to leave Archean Mountain differed based on their talents.For example, those who cultivated a transcendent-grade Godfiend Body had different requirements from those who cultivated a high-grade Godfiend Body.\u201cHe comprehended Force at the age of 13,\u201d said Liu Qiyue with a voice transmission. \u201cHe entered Archean Mountain in the same year and became a Godfiend when he was 15. He cultivates a transcendent-grade Godfiend Body\u2014the Black Sand Fiend Body. He successfully cultivated a transcendent-grade Godfiend body in two years. He\u2019s simply a monster. It\u2019s said that he has also mastered moves from the Black Metal Sutra. Every time the Master lectures, he will ask the Fifth Young Master questions.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded. He had already obtained the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body formula, so he knew how difficult it was.Without condensing an Essence Soul, there was no way to inherit a Black Metal Sutra via intent. They could only read the text and diagrams in manuals. Without an intent legacy, it would be very difficult to learn a Black Metal Sutra\u2019s moves.\u201cCounting the 21 new disciples, there are 273 disciples who remain on the mountain,\u201d said Liu Qiyue via voice transmission. \u201cThere are 19 who have already cultivated a transcendent-grade Godfiend Body.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s indeed very difficult to cultivate a transcendent-grade Godfiend Body. By the way, the most monstrous talent in the past few decades is King Calm Sea\u2019s fifth son. Is there no one else?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s someone close.\u201d Liu Qiyue glanced at the woman in a light-green robe in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s the person in light-green robes right in front of you. She\u2019s Xiao Yunyue from Jiang State\u2019s Xiao family. Xiao Yunyue also cultivated a transcendent-grade Godfiend body, and she has also mastered moves from the Black Metal Sutra. However, she comprehended Force at 15 and became a Godfiend at 23. In comparison, her cultivation speed is slower than Xue Feng\u2019s. She cultivates the Indestructible Divine Body, but I don\u2019t know which Black Metal Sutra move she mastered.\u201dIndestructible Divine Body?Meng Chuan nodded slightly.Among the transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies, there were many that were skilled with domains. The Indestructible Divine Body was the strongest when it came to domains. It also provided the strongest vitality out of all Godfiend bodies.For instance, the Eon Sea Fiend Body allowed one to regrow their severed limbs in a day. An Indestructible Divine Body allowed one to regenerate their limbs in ten minutes. Its domain was the strongest, and it has the greatest lifeforce! However, it was weaker in close combat.Black Metal Sutra.Meng Chuan knew that the Lightning Devastator Saber he had learned was a Black Metal Sutra. However, he had only learned portions of one of its moves\u2014the Five Lightning Descent.Meng Chuan had seen a complete demonstration of a move in the intent legacy. It was terrifying towards the end. Clearly, the difficulty of mastering the move rose exponentially at the end. He was unable to withstand the transmission of one complete move.Oh?Meng Chuan turned around and saw Yan Jin walking in. Under the guidance of the Grotto-Heaven Pavilion\u2019s steward, he sat behind Meng Chuan, slightly to the left.\u201cYan Jin,\u201d greeted Meng Chuan and Liu Qiyue.Yan Jin also smiled and nodded slightly. Just as he was about to say something, his expression changed.Fifth Young Master Xue Feng stood up and walked towards Yan Jin with a smile that resembled a spring breeze. He smiled and said, \u201cBrother, it\u2019s not easy to meet you. You refuse to meet me when I visit your cave abode.\u201d An invisible domain influenced the surroundings, preventing people from eavesdropping.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for us to meet,\u201d said Yan Jin calmly.\u201cI heard that you changed your name with the imperial government? You are now called Yan Jin?\u201d asked Xue Feng.\u201cYes.\u201d Yan Jin nodded.Xue Feng shook his head gently. \u201cWhy do you have to do that? You know that Father is focused on cultivation and guarding the Calm Sea Pass. How can he have time to pay attention to such trivial matters? What happened back then cannot be blamed entirely on Fath\u2014\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to say anything.\u201d Yan Jin cut him off coldly.Xue Feng helplessly said, \u201cAlright, even if you don\u2019t want to acknowledge the family, you should acknowledge me as your elder brother.\u201dYan Jin looked at him and finally responded.His elder brother was only five years older than him. He had treated him quite well when he was young. However, he left for Archean Mountain at the age of 13, so they hadn\u2019t met in ten years.\u201cAfter today\u2019s lecture, let\u2019s have a good chat. We haven\u2019t seen each other in ten years. The snotty child has already grown up.\u201d Xue Feng smiled as he returned to his prayer mat.Yan Jin\u2019s eyes filled with mixed emotions.The only person who was close to him was his fifth brother. No one could hear their conversation. However, everyone could tell that their relationship wasn\u2019t ordinary.\u201cThat Yan Jin is the seventh son of King Calm Sea. I heard he ranked fourth in the entrance examination this year.\u201d\u201cOnly fourth? He\u2019s far inferior to Fifth Young Master.\u201d\u201cWho can compare with him? All of King Calm Sea\u2019s children are impressive, but the fifth son is the most powerful among them. In the past few decades, he\u2019s the most monstrous talent.\u201d The other disciples chatted casually. Xue Feng\u2019s monstrous talent had long been recognized.Many disciples were chatting.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuddenly, Meng Chuan sensed a unique wave fluctuating as it enveloped every disciple.This fluctuation was very weak. It was like moonlight scattered across every person\u2019s body. There was no pressure, only comfort. All the disciples fell silent. Nearly 200 Godfiends and nearly a hundred mortal disciples stood up one after another. The new disciples\u2014Meng Chuan and company\u2014stood up immediately.When a long-haired man walked in, all the disciples bowed respectfully. \u201cGreetings, Master.\u201dThe long-haired man\u2019s skin was as fair as jade. After walking in, his gaze swept across the two hundred-plus disciples. When he saw Meng Chuan, he paused for a moment. The corners of his lips curled up as he smiled. \u201cSit down.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The long-haired man sat cross-legged, smiled, and said, \u201cThere are 20 new disciples today. It\u2019s truly a joyous occasion for our Archean Mountain.\u201d20? Shouldn\u2019t there be 21?Meng Chuan, Princess Li Ying, Zong Sha, Chu Yong, Yan Feng, and the other new disciples were slightly taken aback. They couldn\u2019t help but look around. The youngest Yan Chitong was also here today.Ji Yuantong is missing!Meng Chuan paid careful attention and sensed that Ji Yuantong wasn\u2019t in the pavilion.Out of the new batch of disciples, only Ji Yuantong was missing.The long-haired man smiled indifferently. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything you want to ask, you can speak.\u201d\u201cMaster.\u201dImmediately, a youth with sword-like eyebrows and glistening eyes\u2014who sat towards the back\u2014stood up and bowed respectfully. \u201cI\u2019ve been cultivating the Azure Lotus Divine Body for three years. I have only cultivated the Azure Lotus Divine Body to the Fire Water Symbiosis realm. Do I continue cultivating?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too slow. The Azure Lotus Divine Body has a total of seven steps. You have only reached the second step\u2014Fire Water Symbiosis. You won\u2019t master it in twenty years. You can abandon it and switch to a high-grade Godfiend body,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cAlso, you should focus on your sword art more. You haven\u2019t reached the Realm of Intent after three years. That\u2019s also too slow.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d replied the young man respectfully as he made his decision.He had put in too much effort into the Azure Lotus Divine Body for three years. He had even overlooked his sword techniques. He knew that there was little hope to cultivate the Azure Lotus Divine Body, but he was unwilling to accept it. He still had hope. However, his master\u2019s words made him give up completely.After all, if one did not become a high-grade Godfiend within ten years, they would be expelled from the inner sect!I\u2019ll just become a high-grade Godfiend! I\u2019ll focus on my sword techniques. If my sword art is profound enough, it can make up for the huge gap between high-grade and transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies.\u201cMaster.\u201d Another thin, hunchbacked youth stood up and said respectfully, \u201cI\u2019ve been cultivating the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body for six years. I finally reached the Seventh Refinement realm five days ago. Do I absorb heavenly lightning for the Life-and-Death juncture or attempt the Eighth Refinement?\u201dSeventh Refinement?Immediately, many disciples looked at the hunchbacked youth in surprise.As long as one reached the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body\u2019s Seventh Refinement and had reached the Realm of Intent, one could challenge the Life-and-Death juncture and become a Godfiend.That would mean an additional transcendent-grade Godfiend expert for Archean Mountain.Seventh Refinement?Meng Chuan\u2019s eyes lit up when he heard that.He had chosen the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body. He knew that this formula required the world\u2019s baneful aura to cultivate the Godfiend body. Every time he successfully improved his body with the baneful aura, it would be considered a refinement. The more one refined their bodies, the more precious and powerful baneful auras would be needed. According to records, one could refine their bodies a maximum of nine times.Nine refinements meant perfection. When one\u2019s body was sufficiently robust, one could forge the perfect Lightning Devastator Fiend Body during the Life-and-Death juncture by drawing heavenly lightning unto themselves.In reality, the baneful aura was extremely harmful to the physical body. It also dealt damage to one\u2019s consciousness. Even though many genius disciples had strong wills, once they reached the third or fourth Refinement, their bodies would not be able to withstand it. If they absorbed even more baneful aura to cultivate, their bodies would fail. Every refinement was a transformation, and the danger level would rise correspondingly.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be worth it to give up after cultivating for six years. Continue to the Eighth Refinement before becoming a Godfiend,\u201d said the long-haired man with a smile. \u201cOf course, if you haven\u2019t reached the Eighth Refinement by the ten-year limit, give up immediately and attempt the Life-and-Death juncture to become a Godfiend. Becoming a Godfiend in ten years is a cast-iron rule of Archean Mountain.\u201cA mortal\u2019s body and lifeforce peaks at the age of twenty. It remains stagnant between the ages of twenty to thirty with very slight drops in lifeforce. Once thirty and older, one\u2019s lifeforce will decrease rapidly. Such Godfiends won\u2019t have a promising future. Cultivation skyrockets in difficulty with an aging body. Therefore, you must become a Godfiend before the age of thirty.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d all the disciples responded in unison. The hunchbacked man also responded respectfully before sitting down cross-legged.The surrounding disciples looked at him differently. No matter what happened, he had already reached the Seventh Refinement! He was destined to become a transcendent-grade Godfiend.With 200 plus disciples learning of it, the top family clans in the Great Zhou Dynasty would soon know of his achievement.\u2026The long-haired man answered each disciple\u2019s questions about their cultivation. Be it about Godfiend body cultivation, weapon techniques, mental willpower, and even the troubles one encountered when challenging the Nine Mystical Caves; he could answer them all.Halfway through, King Calm Sea\u2019s fifth son\u2014Xue Feng\u2014stood up and asked, \u201cMaster, I still can\u2019t pass the Nine Mystical Caves, and I feel like I\u2019m still far from success. Master, please give me a clear answer. When will I be able to pass the Nine Mystical Caves?\u201d He had been on the mountain for ten years, but he was unable to leave the mountain. He was somewhat anxious. He also wanted to fight demon monarchs with his fellow disciples.He was very powerful, much stronger than many of the Godfiends that had descended the mountain. However, he could not pass the Nine Mystical Caves!\u201cIf your strength increases like it was in the past, you can leave the mountain in three years,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cIf you have a major breakthrough, it\u2019s possible to leave the mountain within half a year.\u201d\u201cI understand,\u201d replied Xue Feng as he sat down cross-legged.In recent decades, he was Archean Mountain\u2019s most dazzling disciple. As King Calm Sea\u2019s most outstanding son, his strength was extraordinary. The family had groomed him with all their might. The number of natural treasures he had consumed far exceeded his siblings. His Godfiend foundation was five times more robust than an ordinary genius\u2019s. He had become a transcendent-grade Godfiend at age 15, and he had also mastered an ultimate move from the Black Metal Sutra. He had achieved the Sword Soul at 22 years of age.It made the other disciples look up to him. Jiang State\u2019s Xiao Yunyue could barely compete with him.Archean Mountain\u2019s requirements to allow him to descend the mountain were extremely stringent. The Nine Mystical Caves test was also extremely difficult. They didn\u2019t allow him to leave the mountain easily. If he did not have the ability to protect himself, he would probably be assassinated by the demons once he left the mountain.\u2026The question-and-answer session lasted for nearly six hours.The Supremacy\u2019s lecturing happened three times a month at the Grotto-Heaven Pavilion. It happened on the 5th, 15th, and 25th of every month.Therefore, disciples didn\u2019t have many troubles over a span of ten days. It just took a long time because nearly 70% of 200 plus disciples asked questions.\u201cSince nobody has any more questions,\u201d the long-haired man smiled as his gaze swept across the new disciples and said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk about what the new disciples are most concerned about since they are here today. Many of you chose transcendent-grade Godfiend formulas. Give them a try first! If you see any hope in three years, you can persevere! If there\u2019s a slim chance after three years, give up cultivating the Godfiend Body early.\u201cFor the first three years, one cannot cultivate a Godfiend body for more than four hours a day. One should spend more time on weapon techniques and saber techniques. If one is sufficiently skilled with their weapon, they can still fight an enemy one realm higher. One must not stop cultivating their weapon techniques for a single day.\u201cAs for the weapon techniques, how should one choose?\u201cThe best ultimate techniques of our human race come from the Black Metal Sutras. There are sixty-two Black Metal Sutras on Archean Mountain,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cHowever, one needs to become a Great Solar Godfiend and condense an Essence Soul before they can accept the Black Metal Sutra legacies.\u201cBefore this, there\u2019s no way to receive an intent legacy. All one can do is read the text, diagrams, and other descriptions. The Black Metal Sutra legacies are ten times more difficult to cultivate without intent guidance.\u201cThe ultimate techniques within the Black Metal Sutras are divided into three types\u2014Heaven, Earth, and Man. The latter can be read for reference, but the former two are very profound. You\u2019ll study them your entire lives. As there is an intent legacy, cultivating Heaven-level Godfiend arts will be much easier than the Black Metal Sutras. If one cultivates a Heaven-level Godfiend art to perfection, its strength will match a Black Metal Sutra ultimate technique.\u201cAmongst Heaven-level Godfiend ultimate techniques\u2026\u201d\u2026The Supremacy explained everything one needed to know with great detail. It was much clearer than what Meng Chuan and the others had learned after reading the books in the library cave.Many people gained a clearer understanding of Godfiend cultivation.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLet\u2019s end the lecture today. You are dismissed.\u201d The long-haired man stood up and left.\u201cSafe travels, Master.\u201d said the disciples respectfully.Many disciples began to head out in groups.\u201cMeng Chuan, come to the Grotto-Heaven Pavilion in two hours.\u201dA voice sounded in Meng Chuan\u2019s ears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Liu Qiyue needed to head to her other master\u2019s place for cultivation.Supremacy was the master of all Archean Mountain disciples that were admitted in the past three hundred years. He only gave simple guidance to his disciples during the lectures. The disciples had to search for the true direction in their cultivation by themselves! And if they were lucky, other Godfiends would accept them as disciples. For example, there were quite a number of disciples on Archean Mountain who took in Marquis Godfiends or Regis Godfiends as masters.Liu Qiyue\u2019s other master was Marquis Godfiend, Marquis Heavenstar. His archery skills were enough to threaten a Regis Godfiend. He was a master specially arranged for Liu Qiyue by Archean Mountain.\u2026After reading in the library for more than an hour, Meng Chuan returned to Grotto-Heaven Pavilion.Night had already fallen, and the cold wind blew. The Grotto-Heaven Pavilion was completely empty, and no one could be seen.Oh?Meng Chuan walked to Grotto-Heaven Pavilion\u2019s entrance and discovered a person walking over from afar. It was a gray-robed elder. He bowed slightly and said, \u201cLord Meng Chuan, please follow me.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded and entered Grotto-Heaven Pavilion.After going through curves and bends, he saw a small pavilion in the garden. The long-haired man was leisurely sitting there. A pot of alcohol was being warmed. He flipped through a dossier as he drank.The gray-robed elder bowed and retreated.Meng Chuan walked closer and said respectfully, \u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cMeng Chuan, you\u2019ve practiced the Dao of painting since you were young. All of Eastcalm Prefecture\u2019s artists were hired to teach you. You managed to paint Gallant Steeds at 13. Your artistic skills are excellent, and you\u2019re already a top-notch artist in the present world. Apart from cultivation, you spend at least two hours painting every day.\u201d The long-haired man smiled at Meng Chuan. \u201cAm I right?\u201dMeng Chuan was shocked.Many people had seen Gallant Steeds\u2014his father, the clan Elders, Liu Qiyue, Yun Qingping, and many others.\u201cHaving an inborn Essence Soul is extremely rare. According to what I know, there have only been three instances in human history for someone to have inborn Essence Souls. Their father or mother must have reached the Creation realm, and they have to pass a portion of their condensed strength to their child. Only then, can a baby have an inborn Essence Soul,\u201d said the long-haired man with a smile. \u201cYour parents are very weak. They are too far from the Creation realm. Clearly, it\u2019s impossible for them to pass their power to you.\u201cThere\u2019s only one possibility. You\u2019re at such a high realm at the Dao of painting and reached the state of the Dao and can seek answers from your inner self. That\u2019s how you condensed an Essence Soul as a mortal.\u201dThe long-haired man smiled at Meng Chuan. \u201cAm I right?\u201dMeng Chuan was shocked. Before he could say anything, the other party had guessed that he had condensed an Essence Soul through painting.\u201cMaster, you are truly wise,\u201d said Meng Chuan respectfully.\u201cNot at all. I can sense your Essence Soul at a glance, so I guessed it,\u201d said the long-haired man with a smile. \u201cIn human history, other than the three infants who relied on their parents\u2019 power, the rest formed Essence Souls through external help.\u201cThey were either good at playing the zither, painting, calligraphy, and even blacksmithing. Once their skills reach a certain point, they can reach the Dao Seeking state. Every time they seek answers from their inner self, their heart and mind will undergo a transformation. Their souls will also undergo a transformation,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s too difficult for people to attain the Dao through extracurricular skills. It\u2019s too rare.\u201cWe\u2019ve tried grooming such people, but it was useless! It\u2019s impossible to groom a truly-skilled artist. Even if one becomes a top artist at the age of seventy or eighty, it\u2019ll be too late,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cFurthermore, wasting too much time on these extracurricular skills will affect their cultivation in weapon techniques.\u201cAfter reaching the Realm of Dao with weapon techniques, they too can seek answers from their inner self,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cSince one can also achieve the same with weapon techniques, there\u2019s no need for geniuses to waste their time on such extracurricular skills.\u201dMeng Chuan understood.All skills were the same. Painting was a skill, but so were weapon techniques. When one was sufficiently skilled in weapon techniques, they could also seek answers from their inner self.However, painting was a skill that allowed one to unleash one\u2019s inner emotions. Weapons were meant to kill enemies. To reach the state of seeking answers from their inner self, one would have reached the Realm of Dao.Weapon techniques had several realms: Unity, Force, Intent, Soul, and Dao. One could only seek answers from their inner self after attaining Saber Dao, testimony to its difficulty.\u201cYou can be considered a genius in saber arts,\u201d said the long-haired man, \u201cbut you are a peerless genius at painting. Just your art alone deserves your name to be put in history for a thousand years.\u201d\u201cMaster, you flatter me.\u201d Meng Chuan felt somewhat embarrassed by the compliments.He had never publicly revealed his proudest works, People Resonance and Facing the Morning Sun. He knew that compared to the famous artists and sages in history, he was in no way inferior. The claim that the Supremacy made was indeed true.To be able to seek answers from his inner self, it meant that his skill had reached a peak. Just a painting of his was capable of affecting the minds of others.\u201cSeeking answers from one\u2019s inner self is very rare. Therefore, it\u2019s extremely difficult to improve one\u2019s Essence Soul,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cEssence Souls are related to the Darkstar, Incessant, and the Creation realm. Essence Souls represent your potential. Therefore, the secret of condensing an Essence Soul needs to be kept a secret. If the demons learn that you\u2019ve condensed an Essence Soul as a mortal, demon monarchs will definitely attempt to assassinate you.\u201d\u201cI understand,\u201d said Meng Chuan respectfully.There were demon monarchs lurking in the world. For example, when the city passes were breached, there were demon monarchs who charged in. Many of them even remained hiding in the human world. Even if humans retook back the city pass, it would be difficult to find those hidden demon monarchs.There were also unstable World Entrances that allowed demon monarchs to infiltrate the human race.How did the Skydemon Sect form? It was established by infiltrating demon monarchs that tempted humans into betrayal.These lurking demon monarchs would seek out critical moments to make trouble. The threat they posed was extremely great.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d said the long-haired man with a smile. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t use the power of your Essence Soul, no one will be able to tell that you have condensed an Essence Soul unless they\u2019re at the Creation realm.\u201cMarquis and Regis Godfiends might discover your Essence Soul if you use its power. However, as long as you are more than a thousand feet away from them, they won\u2019t be able to discover it,\u201d said the long-haired man.Meng Chuan calmed down.He understood. He didn\u2019t need to worry about using the power of his Essence Soul when he was more than a thousand feet from a Regis Godfiend.\u201cActually, once you become a Great Solar Godfiend, there\u2019s no need to hide your Essence Soul,\u201d said the long-haired man with a smile. \u201cWith your talent, I believe you will definitely be able to become a Great Solar Godfiend in fifteen years.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded as he listened. Among the Great Solar Godfiends, there were already precedents of people successfully condensing an Essence Soul.\u201cOf course, the most important aspects of Godfiend cultivation is the physical body, Essence Soul, and your saber arts realm. Your Essence Soul is an advantage, but if your other aspects don\u2019t reach the required threshold, you will not be able to reach the Darkstar realm,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cIn these three aspects, the most important is the saber art realm. You haven\u2019t even achieved Saber Intent yet, so you are still a distance away.\u201d\u201cI understand,\u201d said Meng Chuan respectfully. He also admitted that his love for saber arts was indeed inferior to painting.\u201cThe saber arts realm is more important than the physical body or Essence Soul. Therefore, you need to choose a suitable saber art to cultivate,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cOur Archean Mountain has many saber art legacies. How about this? Use the saber technique you are most skilled at. Let me see which saber arts are suitable for you.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dMeng Chuan immediately walked to an empty space. His Quintessential Essence condensed into one. With a flash, he traversed a hundred feet. An aqueous saber beam silently cut through the sky without stirring the wind.This was the move he had cultivated the longest over all these years\u2014the Saber Drawing Stance!\u201cGood.\u201d The long-haired man nodded slightly when he saw this. Meng Chuan\u2019s Saber Drawing Stance left him quite satisfied.He executed the Saber Drawing Stance three times in a row. He then switched to Swaying Moonfall before using his defensive saber art! Finally, he used his incomplete Five Lightning Descent. The first two strikes were of the Five Lightning Descent, but the third strike was Swaying Moonfall.\u201cI\u2019m only good at these few moves,\u201d said Meng Chuan respectfully as he sheathed his saber.\u201cHaha.\u201d The long-haired man laughed. \u201cI was shocked when I saw you use the Five Lightning Descent. How could you perform a complete Five Lightning Descent at your level? It turned out that you combined an incomplete move with another strike.\u201dMeng Chuan immediately said, \u201cI received a Lightning Devastator Saber fragment. I accepted the legacy with my consciousness, but I can barely inherit a portion of it.\u201d\u201cYou are a mortal, after all. Your Essence Soul is too weak,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cYour body is like a vessel, and your Essence Soul is the water in the vessel. Your mortal body is like a cup of water, so there\u2019s naturally very little water inside. If you reach the Great Solar realm, your body will be like a huge water vat. It can contain a lot more water.\u201d\u201cYour body has restricted your Essence Soul,\u201d said the long-haired man.\u201cI understand.\u201d Meng Chuan suddenly understood.It was said that after condensing an Essence Soul at the Great Solar realm, one could accept a Black Metal Sutra legacy completely. However, his Essence Soul wasn\u2019t even able to accept a fragment of the Black Metal Sutra legacy. The culprit was his Essence Soul. The difference was too great.\u201cYour Essence Soul\u2019s quality is rather high, but it\u2019s just too small,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cWhen you become a Godfiend, your Essence Soul will be much larger. When you can withstand inheriting a Black Metal Sutra legacy, I\u2019ll let you accept it.\u201d\u201cThank you, Master,\u201d said Meng Chuan immediately.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFrom the way you used your saber arts, you are clearly skilled in the swift saber,\u201d said the long-haired man. \u201cOur Archean Mountain has a total of nine Black Metal Sutra saber arts. Among them, three are for the swift saber. These three are the Lightning Devastator Saber you just used, the Heart Intent Saber, and the World Roving Dragon Saber.\u201cHowever, the Lightning Devastator Saber only has 30% compatibility with you! This saber art was created by Supremacy Thundergod over thirty thousand years ago. This saber art is more about being dominating. It\u2019s extremely fast, but it\u2019s also extremely dominating. Your saber arts aren\u2019t that dominating, so you only have a 30% compatibility with it. However, this saber art works very well with the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body.\u201cThe World Roving Dragon Saber is extremely fast and bizarre to the extreme. You have a 50% compatibility with it.\u201cThe Heart Intent Saber is an even purer form of the swift saber. It has a 90% compatibility with you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - Body Tempering With Baneful AuraPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98: Body Tempering With Baneful AuraCKtalon\u201cThen should I choose the Heart Intent Saber?\u201d inquired Meng Chuan.The Supremacy nodded. \u201cChoose the Heart Intent Saber. You will cultivate this saber art several times faster than the World Roving Dragon Saber, and Lightning Devastator Saber. What you should focus on now is to achieve Saber Intent. The true intent of a saber art needs to be sublime.\u201cTherefore, one has to specialize in a saber art if they are trying to achieve Saber Intent. Only by cultivating the Heart Intent Saber and achieving the Saber Soul, can you choose a few techniques from the World Roving Dragon Saber and Lightning Devastator Saber to complete your saber art repertoire.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201dBefore reaching the Saber Soul realm, he was only to cultivate the Heart Intent Saber.\u201cHeart Intent Saber has eighteen stances. The first stance is called the Heart Saber Stance. It\u2019s the foundation of all other moves in the saber art. It\u2019s the saber art\u2019s core! This Heart Saber Stance is also known as the Heart Intent Saber Drawing Stance,\u201d said the Supremacy with a smile. \u201cThe Saber Drawing Stance you\u2019ve trained is very similar to the Heart Saber Stance. This is also why I said that you are 90% compatible with this saber art. However, you are still unable to accept a Black Metal Sutra legacy. All you can do is go to the Impartation Pavilion and choose ordinary manuals for perusal.\u201cIf you cultivate the Heart Intent Saber, you can head to Archean Mountain\u2019s Thousand Sabers Cavern. This saber art was created when Godfiend Guo Ke was being punished in the Thousand Sabers Cavern.\u201dMeng Chuan was secretly puzzled.Being punished?\u201cGodfiend Guo Ke was struck at the Incessant realm due to his weak physical body. He was unable to reach the Creation realm,\u201d said the Supremacy. \u201cHowever, the Heart Intent Saber is indeed a saber art for Creation realm experts. It\u2019s one of humanity\u2019s most powerful weapon art legacies.\u201dMeng Chuan nodded slightly. For Godfiend cultivation, one\u2019s physical body, Essence Soul, and weapon realm were indispensable.The Heart Intent Saber\u2019s creator was stuck as a Regis Godfiend because his physical body was too weak.\u2026After Meng Chuan left Grotto-Heaven Pavilion, he was in no hurry to choose his saber art. Instead, he went to the library and searched for books regarding the three saber arts. Although he trusted his master, he still had to make his own decisions.The Heart Intent Saber Black Metal Sutra has two identical copies. One is in Archean Mountain, while the other is in Black Sand Grotto-Heaven.Meng Chuan gained an understanding while reading. In history, powerful Godfiends would usually pay the price to create two or even three copies of their legacies. Firstly, it was to prevent unforeseen events from causing the legacy to be lost or damaged. Their legacies were ultimately products of blood, sweat, and tears, so they were willing to create one or two more copies. Secondly, the copies were traded for other Black Metal Sutras with other factions.Archean Mountain had a huge collection of Black Metal Sutras and Godfiend body formulas. Many of them were created by Black Sand Grotto-Heaven, Two World Island, and experts from other factions.For example, Archean Mountain only had remnant copies of the Lightning Devastator Saber. However, Black Sand Grotto-Heaven had a complete copy of the Lightning Devastator Saber legacy.Ever since the demons invaded their world, humanity\u2019s three supreme sects had deepened their relationships with one another. In the future, they would pay a certain price to obtain the complete Lightning Devastator Saber legacy from Black Sand Grotto-Heaven.Okay.Meng Chuan read one book after another, increasing his understanding of the three saber arts. Furthermore\u2014with his master\u2019s advice\u2014he was confident.Master is right. The Lightning Devastator Saber is too domineering. It doesn\u2019t suit me. However, I can choose one or two moves as secret techniques in the future. Many of these saber techniques are to be unleashed frenziedly. For example, the Five Lightning Descent was a swift, devastating move.The World Roving Dragon Saber focuses on strange, abrupt changes. I can learn from its unpredictable movement technique.These three saber arts contained movement techniques. Meng Chuan had taken a fancy to the World Roving Dragon Saber\u2019s movement technique. Having unpredictable movement made it very easy to kill enemies.\u2026In the Impartation Pavilion, Meng Chuan chose the complete secret manual of the Heart Intent Saber and three thick books filled with supplementary notes to bring back to his cave abode. The three books were written by three Regis Godfiends\u2014who had cultivated the Heart Intent Saber. They were left behind for their successors.\u201cPrepare hot water. I\u2019m taking a bath.\u201d Meng Chuan instructed after returning to his cave abode late at night. Following that, he began reading the Heart Intent Saber manual carefully.Without intent guidance, he could only read and ponder over the content slowly. With the supplementary notes, he began understanding the Heart Intent Saber slowly.After reading late into the night, Meng Chuan continued his Saber Drawing Stance repetitions when he woke up the next day. He wasn\u2019t in a hurry to cultivate the Heart Intent Saber. Instead, he decided to spend ten days studying the manual and supplementary notes carefully. After gaining a deep understanding of the saber art, would he begin cultivating it.\u2026Archean Mountain, Myriad Wither Peak, the next afternoon.\u201cLord Meng Chuan.\u201d There was a servant guarding the entrance to a Myriad Wither Peak cave. There were four words engraved on top of the cave\u2014Three Yin Banefire Cave.Meng Chuan walked over and smiled. \u201cI would like a C-rank chamber.\u201d\u201cPlease follow me.\u201d A servant immediately led the way.Meng Chuan was astonished by Myriad Wither Peak. There were many baneful aura caves in Myriad Wither Peak. These baneful auras were transported from areas around the world by powerful Godfiends. It was hard for vegetation to survive on Myriad Wither Peak. A few special plants could survive, but Myriad Wither Peak didn\u2019t have any trace of greenery at all.Three Yin Banefire was the first out of nine baneful auras needed to refine his body in preparation for the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body.Meng Chuan was a mortal; thus, the baneful aura concentration in a C-rank chamber was sufficient for him. The baneful aura would probably turn Meng Chuan into dust the moment he breathed inside an A-rank chamber.\u201cAt the Three Yin Banefire Cave. A C-rank room requires ten credits per day,\u201d said the servant with a smile. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t spend more than 24 hours cultivating inside, it will be considered a day.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded. Ten credits a day? It was already one of the lowest prices.Rumble!The door to the chamber opened, and Meng Chuan entered. He casually closed the stone door and shut it tight.The chamber was 50 feet long and wide. An oil lamp\u2014that was permanently lit\u2014and a mat furnished the room. There was nothing else.This baneful aura is really thin.Meng Chuan could see a faint dark red gas floating in the chamber with his naked eye. He also began to feel a slight stabbing pain on his skin.Time to begin.Meng Chuan drew his saber and used a saber art.This saber art was recorded in the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body legacy. It wasn\u2019t meant for killing. Instead, it was for refining baneful auras. When executing the saber art, one would control their muscles with more finesse to exert strength. It allowed one\u2019s strained muscles to absorb baneful auras, speeding up the body\u2019s absorption speed.Breathe out; breathe in.He used Saber Force to exert all his strength as he used the baneful Aura Refinement Saber Art. The more his muscles exerted strength, the more they absorbed the baneful aura greedily.Strands of dark red baneful aura entered Meng Chuan\u2019s body and slowly transformed his body.Slowly, Meng Chuan\u2019s heart was filled with agitation and an impulse to go crazy.Baneful auras indeed affect one\u2019s mind. I\u2019ve only just started cultivating, and I\u2019m absorbing the most ordinary baneful aura; yet, I\u2019m already agitated slightly.Meng Chuan sighed inwardly. He easily maintained his lucidity and continued executing the saber art.One had to put in a lot of effort when executing the body-tempering saber art. It was useless if one carelessly executed the saber art.His movements had to be precise. The more he channeled his strength, the more the baneful aura would fuse with his body! It increased his absorption efficiency and speed.\u2026He continued cultivating for nearly two hours before he began to feel a stabbing pain throughout his body.I\u2019ve reached my body\u2019s current limits.He immediately stopped executing the Baneful Aura Refining Saber Art. His body needed time to adapt.Rumble!Meng Chuan opened the stone door and walked out.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he needed the baneful aura to refine his body, staying in the chamber only brought harm.\u2026Archean Mountain was very convenient. All kinds of resources for cultivating a transcendent-grade Godfiend body were prepared. They could be exchanged using credits.Every day, Meng Chuan would train in the Three Yin Banefire Cave\u2019s C-rank chamber for two hours. He did this for five days, and it was now afternoon on New Year\u2019s Eve.Oh?After using the body-tempering saber art for more than an hour, Meng Chuan suddenly felt like he had \u201ceaten his fill.\u201d He immediately stopped and inspected his body with his inner vision.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUnder his inner vision, his bones and flesh emanated dark red baneful aura faintly. Even his blood had the same traits.It\u2019s already fused with the bone marrow? I\u2019m done with the First Refinement?Meng Chuan extended his finger, and with a thought, dark red baneful aura rose from his fingertip. When he saw this, he smiled.The Three Yin Banefire has fused with my body completely.My body can produce a small amount of Three Yin Banefire now.The First Refinement is the easiest because the baneful aura is the weakest. The negative effects it has on my will is weak. Five days? The speed is still alright.Meng Chuan nodded slightly.I\u2019ll begin the Second Refinement tomorrow.Every person\u2014who had cultivated a Lightning Divine Body\u2014completed the First Refinement very smoothly. The further one went, the slower the body refining would become. It was even possible that they would go crazy, and their bodies would collapse. Therefore, many geniuses would immediately stop when they sensed danger. They would have no choice but to give up on this Godfiend body if that happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - Saber Practicing in Thousand Sabers CavernPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: Saber Practicing in Thousand Sabers CavernCKtalonOn New Year\u2019s Eve, all Archean Mountain disciples gathered at Dao Exchange Peak.\u201cCheers!\u201d\u201cCheers!\u201dA group of disciples enjoyed themselves with drinks. There were also musicians playing music by the side. Delicacies were constantly served by servants.Liu Qiyue and Meng Chuan sat together and watched the fireworks explode in the distance. The servants\u2014who were launching the fireworks from afar\u2014were also very happy.\u201cIn a blink of an eye, it\u2019s already New Year\u2019s Eve. This is the first New Year\u2019s Eve I\u2019m spending at Archean Mountain.\u201d Liu Qiyue leaned against Meng Chuan and felt like she wasn\u2019t lonely on Archean Mountain anymore.\u201cWe will be here for about ten years,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile. \u201cThis will be our last peaceful period. We will be placed on the battlefield once we leave the mountain.\u201dAfter entering Archean Mountain, most disciples went down the mountain after ten to fifteen years. Some people went down the mountain earlier\u2014about six years after entering Archean Mountain.Some of the more talented disciples took twenty years before leaving the mountain.The higher one\u2019s talent was, the harder the Nine Mystical Caves test. For example, the Fifth Young Master\u2014Xue Feng\u2014had been on the mountain for ten years. He had achieved Sword Soul last year. He was now far more powerful than Jadesun Palace Lord, but he still wasn\u2019t able to pass the Nine Mystical Caves.My future Nine Mystical Caves test will probably be very difficult as well.He had formed his Essence Soul when he was mortal, so his master\u2019s requirements for him would definitely be strict. If he successfully cultivated a transcendent-grade Godfiend Body and a Black Metal Sutra move, the test would be extremely difficult. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for him to cultivate a transcendent-grade Godfiend Body and a Black Metal Sutra either. Only two disciples\u2014who hadn\u2019t left the mountain\u2014were capable of doing so. One of them was King Calm Sea\u2019s fifth son, Xue Feng, and the other was Xiao Yunyue from Jiang State\u2019s Xiao family.\u201cWe have to enter the battlefield once we leave the mountain. Therefore, we need to cultivate well on the mountain. Only with sufficient strength can we kill powerful demon monarchs,\u201d said Liu Qiyue.\u201cHey Couple, what are the two of you talking about? Why aren\u2019t you coming over to drink?\u201d Dong Fang\u2019s voice was rough as he shouted loudly.\u201cYes, yes, yes. Come on over,\u201d Ning Yibo shouted in a tipsy state.\u201cCouple?\u201d Liu Qiyue blushed red when she heard that.\u201cQiyue, let\u2019s go over.\u201d Meng Chuan smiled as he pulled Liu Qiyue along. Liu Qiyue had come up the mountain alone, so she joined this new batch of disciples for the gathering.There were three gatherings at Dao Exchange Peak every month. They happened on the 10th, 20th, and last day of each month.Firstly, the gathering was meant for them to relax and make friends. After all, they would be comrade-in-arms on the battlefield. Secondly, they could discuss any cultivation problems that stumped them. Many Archean Mountain disciples still on the mountains had become Godfiends; thus, they could give some pointers to their juniors.Thirdly, they could engage in sparring matches. All who entered Archean Mountain were geniuses, so they naturally refused to admit defeat.The gathering today was very special. It was New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201cCome, come. We can let Sister Qiyue off, but Meng Chuan, you\u2019re a man. You need to drink three shots as a forfeit!\u201d Dong Fang laughed.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll drink three cups.\u201d Meng Chuan didn\u2019t hesitate and quickly downed three cups of alcohol.Yan Jin sat with a cup of alcohol in his hand as a smile crept up on the corners of his mouth.The group of people drank and talked.\u201cI think I\u2019m quite talented in cultivating the Two World Divine Body. I\u2019ve already gained basic mastery of it. Perhaps I\u2019ll be able to achieve a transcendent-grade Godfiend body in a year,\u201d said the youngest Yan Chitong. He sat cross-legged\u2014his feet bare\u2014as he gnawed on a drumstick smugly.\u201cJunior Brother, don\u2019t be too smug. It\u2019s easy to gain basic mastery of the Two World Divine Body. The hardest parts are the three life-and-death tribulations,\u201d said Yan Feng with a smile.\u201cNone of the transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies are simple,\u201d said Chu Yong.Everyone was in a good mood.Everyone\u2019s cultivation was very smooth in the beginning. Meng Chuan\u2019s cultivation of the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body had also gone very smoothly.\u201cLook at how happy you all are.\u201d A carefree young man walked over with an alcohol flask in hand. He looked drunk. \u201cMy name is Yue Qing. I came to Archean Mountain two years earlier than you. Every new batch of disciples would smile happily in the beginning, but they all wore bitter looks as they continued cultivating. It\u2019s really difficult to achieve a transcendent-grade Godfiend body. I haven\u2019t succeeded in cultivating the Black Sand Fiend Body to this day. Forget it. Let\u2019s not talk about this. It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve. Why talk about this? Let me toast all of you, my juniors.\u201d\u201cBottoms up, Senior Brother.\u201dMeng Chuan and company raised their cups. He wasn\u2019t familiar with all of his seniors. However, they would gradually become more familiar with each other through gatherings at Dao Exchange Peak.They were destined to be influential figures of the Great Zhou Dynasty. They were still young.\u2026After New Year\u2019s Eve\u2014the first day of the new year\u2014he began cultivating normally again.All the geniuses were very diligent. They knew that many twenty-year-olds were serving in the military and fighting on the battlefield while they were able to live comfortably. Why? It was because they were the hope of humanity! On the mountain, they had all the resources and formulas they needed. Many seniors left behind secret manuals and notes while fighting outside.They were free to choose, and the Supremacy guided them personally. Therefore, they didn\u2019t want to waste time.Thousand Sabers Cavern.On 6th January, Meng Chuan arrived at Thousand Sabers Cavern.Looking up, one could see countless caves. Strong winds passed through these caves, producing ear-piercing sounds. There were even visible \u201cwind blades\u201d passing through the caves.Thousand Sabers Cavern was a natural formation. One didn\u2019t require any credit to cultivate here.From today onwards, I\u2019ll practice my saber here every day.Meng Chuan leaped 100 feet high and entered a cave.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!The raging winds in the cave roared as wind blades sliced through them. The tunnels were in all kinds of weird shapes\u2014due to the howling winds buffeting the cave for many years.As Meng Chuan walked through the cave, he dodged the wind blades nimbly. As for the wind? It was nothing to experts at his level.After venturing a thousand feet into the cave, the wind in the cave grew stronger. There were even more wind blades here.According to Archean Mountain\u2019s records, Godfiend Guo Ke was isolated deep inside Thousand Sabers Cavern. He had his Quintessential Essence sealed, preventing him from casting a domain. The wind blades constantly sliced at his body, causing him to suffer endless torment. Therefore, he constantly sliced the wind blades apart.There are countless wind blades deep inside Thousand Sabers Cavern; they can slice a newly-advanced Godfiend to pieces. In the three years he spent inside Thousand Sabers Cavern, Guo Ke created the Heart Intent Saber Art\u2014which helped him dominate the entire world\u2014after repeatedly slashing the wind blades. With this, he became a Marquis Godfiend. Then, he went deeper into Thousand Sabers Cavern to cultivate his saber arts! By the time he reached the end, he had mastered the Heart Saber Stance and became a Regis Godfiend.The Heart Intent Saber Art was perfected after centuries, becoming one of humanity\u2019s strongest weapon arts.Meng Chuan nodded slightly.The foundation of Heart Intent Saber\u2019s eighteen stances was the first stance\u2014Heart Saber Stance.The Heart Saber Stance was the most basic move of Heart Intent Saber, but it was also the saber art\u2019s ultimate move. However, to most Heart Intent Saber cultivators, the next three stances were stronger. After all, there was only a handful in history who could transform the Heart Saber Stance into the most powerful move.Time to begin.Meng Chuan quickly drew his saber.Wind blades whistled through the air, their trajectories unpredictable. A saber beam flashed and cleaved the wind blades! The wind blades were weak, so Meng Chuan sliced through them easily.Nine saber beams struck the wind blades one after another, but there were still two wind blades that flew past Meng Chuan.Oh?Meng Chuan frowned.According to the manual, I have to block all the wind blades. However, the wind blades don\u2019t fly over simultaneously. I need to slice them apart quickly. My saber needs to be fast, and I have to strike out consecutively and accurately.It was different from when he trained with arrows flying at him. Previously, Meng Chuan struck out once before sheathing his saber, in preparation for the next strike.Here, a large number of wind blades attacked him irregularly. He needed to draw his saber quickly and strike out multiple times. In the blink of an eye, he needed to attack seven to ten times.I\u2019ll follow the Quintessential Essence circulation method described by the Heart Intent Saber manual.Meng Chuan was also adapting to it. Previously, he used the Quintessential Essence circulation method that he had gleaned from a portion of the Five Lightning Descent move to create his own Saber Drawing Stance.However, the technique he created was crude.The Heart Saber Stance circulation method is the most suitable for a saber drawing stance. It can be said to be the best saber drawing stance in the world.As Meng Chuan got used to it, his execution of the saber move improved. Ninety percent of his strength went into the saber strike, while the last ten percent was used to direct the blade. His explosive speed would reach an extreme, and he would immediately deliver another strike. He kept this up continuously, his saber never stopping.This was the only way to slice more and more wind blades apart.Yes, that\u2019s how it should be.Meng Chuan quickly adapted. After all, he had spent a lot of effort on the Saber Drawing Stance. He had a great deal of experience, so he learned the Heart Saber Stance quickly. He quickly blocked the wind blades in Thousand Sabers Cavern and advanced forward. As he advanced, the wind blades grew in strength and number. When Godfiend Guo Ke reached Thousand Sabers Cavern\u2019s end, he had relied on his Heart Saber Stance to become a Regis Godfiend. As a mortal, Meng Chuan was still far from reaching that stage.\u2026Meng Chuan spent seven hours cultivating in Thousand Sabers Cavern every day. He spent six hours on the Heart Saber Stance. He spent an hour practicing the movement technique, Swallow Stance, and the defensive technique, Red Lotus Stance. Swallow Stance and Red Lotus Stance were Heart Intent Saber\u2019s ninth and fifth moves respectively.After leaving Thousand Sabers Cavern, he returned to his cave abode to eat and rest. In the afternoon, he would spend two hours tempering his body with baneful aura. When evening came, he painted. Having learned that painting was beneficial to his Essence Soul, he naturally didn\u2019t stop. He also liked painting from the bottom of his heart.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026Days passed.Meng Chuan\u2019s cultivation of Lightning Devastator Fiend Body went very smoothly. He reached First Refinement in five days, Second Refinement in twelve days, and the Third Refinement in eighteen days. His progress was extremely smooth, making Meng Chuan extremely happy. From the looks of it, he was truly suited for the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body.However\u2014a month later\u2014he encountered a bottleneck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Cultivation BottleneckPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: Cultivation BottleneckCKtalonMyriad Wither Peak\u2019s Molten Iron Baneful Aura Pool spanned two hundred feet. It was comparable to some lakes. Churning black baneful aura emanated from the pool.There were many chambers in the stone walls next to the pool.In the fifty-foot-wide Chamber 11, there was a pipe in the corner that connected to the Molten Iron Baneful Aura Pool. Black baneful aura\u2014with a lower concentration than the pool\u2014diffused into the chamber.Chi! Chi! Chi!As the Molten Iron baneful aura entered his body, Meng Chuan felt his entire body heat up. His mind was assaulted by the baneful aura as well. Under the influence of baneful aura, the body-tempering saber art\u2019s effects would be reduced, even if ordinary geniuses managed to stay awake. However, Meng Chuan had the Power of Essence Soul that helped him resist the baneful aura. This gave him absolute clarity of mind. He executed the body-tempering saber art with perfection, allowing his muscles to release strength.This was why Meng Chuan had achieved the Fourth Refinement in a short month. He was half-way through completing the Fifth Refinement. He resisted the baneful aura\u2019s effect on his mind completely.My saber art realm isn\u2019t high enough. If I don\u2019t achieve Saber Intent, I won\u2019t be able to use most of my physical strength. My body is absorbing the baneful already much slower now.Meng Chuan was a little anxious.From the first day of attempting the Fifth Refinement, the effects baneful aura has on my body-tempering has constantly been decreasing. With my current absorption speed, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll take a year to complete the Fifth Refinement. And that\u2019s not even mentioning that my body-tempering speed might decrease tomorrow.What about the Sixth Refinement? Will it take five years, ten years? What about the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Refinement?Meng Chuan shook his head gently.Archean Mountain had plenty of books that introduced the various cultivation milestones of the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body.If one wanted to cultivate the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body to a high level, their progress would be determined by several aspects.The first was the physical body. The stronger one\u2019s body foundation, the faster one absorbed and fused baneful aura. Meng Chuan\u2019s Godfiend foundation was three times more robust than an ordinary mortal\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t bad, although it was inferior to Xue Feng\u2019s Godfiend foundation, it was impressive enough. It was a Godfiend foundation forged from consuming a drop of Godfiend Jade Marrow Liquid, an Iceheart Fruit, and Astral Spirit Grass strand. It was a top-notch Godfiend foundation among geniuses. Meng Chuan was very grateful for his father\u2019s and family\u2019s efforts.Second, will. The stronger one\u2019s will was, the better. It reduced the negative effects of baneful auras. His strong will allowed him to execute the body-tempering saber art better. With the Power of Essence Soul, Meng Chuan could maintain absolute clarity of mind! He could execute the body-tempering saber art without any mental interference! He scored full marks on this aspect.The third was realm. The Lightning Devastator Fiend Body required one to be at the Realm of Intent. This was because Intent allowed a person\u2019s body to produce strength several times greater than when using Force! Intent allowed one to use more of their body\u2019s potential. This caused a quantitative change in the absorption of baneful aura. Furthermore, Saber Intent would help him execute the body-tempering saber art more intricately. This also bettered the body-tempering effects\u2014a qualitative change.One had to achieve Intent before they had a chance of reaching the Seventh Refinement. And it was just a chance to reach it.Many geniuses had reached the Realm of Intent, but the further they advanced in regards to body-tempering, the stronger the baneful auras became. They could barely maintain lucidity when the baneful aura attacked their minds; thus, only achieving a portion of the body-tempering saber art\u2019s effects. If one had a sufficiently robust Godfiend foundation, they would stand a chance of reaching the Seventh Refinement. If their foundation were weak, they wouldn\u2019t have any hope of reaching the Seven Refinement.I\u2019ll try the Power of Essence Soul. He now knew that the Power of Soul was the Power of Essence Soul. The Essence Soul was closely related to the body, and it was best at utilizing the body\u2019s potential.Boom!The Power of Essence Soul fused with his body. His perception of his body became several times clearer. The blood in his heart seemed to be churning like rivers. His lungs and breathing mimicked the whistling air in Thousand Sabers Cavern. With improved perception, he could muster several-fold his normal strength and speed when he used the body-tempering saber art. The body-tempering effects he gained was no less than using Intent.His body became greedier as it absorbed the baneful aura. His body-tempering efficiency immediately soared. However, this drained his Power of Essence Soul too quickly. Before he could complete one set of the body-tempering saber art, his Power of Essence Soul was already depleted.Meng Chuan shook his head.The effects of absorbing the baneful aura have increased by several dozen-fold. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t last long. I can train once in the morning. When the Power of Essence Soul has recovered fully at night, I can train again. I can use the baneful aura to temper my body twice a day at maximum efficiency, but these sessions are too short.Previously, he cultivated for two hours. But now, he couldn\u2019t continue after a few seconds. It was too short.Even if it\u2019s two times a day, it would probably take a year. There\u2019s still the Sixth and Seventh Refinement\u2026Meng Chuan shook his head.This isn\u2019t a solution.A beard well lathered is half shaved. I\u2019ll try to comprehend Saber Intent first before continuing to temper my body. As long as I achieve Saber Intent, I\u2019ll probably complete the Fifth Refinement in five days. There\u2019s no need to drain my Power of Essence Soul daily. It\u2019s not good for cultivation either.Tempering the body with baneful aura is too slow. According to the descriptions in the manual, I should stop. The longer I\u2019m exposed to the baneful aura, the greater the damage to my body. Many geniuses eventually collapse physically and are forced to stop.My body-tempering speed is slow; therefore, there\u2019s no need to persist blindly.Some geniuses had reached the Realm of Intent. However\u2014with the baneful aura invading their minds\u2014they barely managed to stay conscious. This caused the body-tempering saber art to be ineffective for them. Their bodies suffered severe damage after absorbing the baneful aura for too long.The wisest method was to train one\u2019s will, such as reaching the Darkness Altar\u2019s summit! With sufficient willpower, one could maintain 60\u201370% of the body-tempering saber art\u2019s effects whilst being assaulted by baneful aura. This way, there was hope.However, it was very difficult to temper one\u2019s will! It normally took geniuses three to five years to temper their well. Geniuses could not afford to waste so much time.The Godfiend foundation was forged in the Mortal Shedding realm. It was impossible to change it now.Raising realms was even more difficult.Archean Mountain gave ten years for their disciples to become high-grade Godfiends at the very least, or they would be expelled from the inner sect. With such time constraints, cultivating a transcendent-grade Godfiend body was very difficult.Apart from the Phoenix Divine Body and the Dragon God Body, it made sense why five of the other ten transcendent-grade Godfiend bodies\u2014the Archean Divine Body, the Samsara Divine Body, the Lightning Devastator Fiend Body, the Thirteen Swordbane Fiend Body, and the Great Strength Fiend Body\u2014were the hardest to cultivate.If I want to reach the Ninth Refinement, I need to achieve Saber Intent.Without any hesitation, Meng Chuan left the chamber.From this day onwards, he stopped cultivating his Godfiend body and focused on his saber art. Time originally spent for Godfiend body cultivation, was instead used for his saber arts.He spent seven hours cultivating every morning! After lunch, he painted during his resting hours and recovered from his exhaustion. After all, it was exhausting to cultivate in the Thousand Sabers Cavern for long periods of time, even though he loved cultivating the swift saber. He had no restraint when painting. He could draw as he wished, allowing his mind to relax completely.After eating food in the late afternoon, he would head to the Thousand Sabers Cavern and spend four hours perfecting the Heart Saber Stance. In total, he spent eleven hours on the Heart Saber Stance every day! After his painting sessions mid-day, he would be at his optimal state.\u2026In the blink of an eye, it was June.Bright Scenic Peak at night.\u201cSteward Liu, when did Meng Chuan leave?\u201d Liu Qiyue placed dishes on the table and asked.\u201cLord Meng Chuan left at 16:45,\u201d said Steward Liu respectfully.\u201cI understand. You can leave first,\u201d instructed Liu Qiyue.\u201cYes.\u201d Steward Liu respectfully retreated.Liu Qiyue sat at the table and looked at the food she had prepared.Ah Chuan cultivates until so late in the day. For the past six months at Archean Mountain, his cultivation has become even crazier than when we were back at home.Her heart ached a little.After hours of training, her mental fatigue greatly reduced her efficiency. According to her master, she should stop to rest if she was truly exhausted and had poor cultivation efficiency. Forcefully cultivating without rest was not beneficial.However, Meng Chuan had been cultivating for a very long time.She read a book as she waited at the table silently.\u2026Late at night, an exhausted Meng Chuan finally returned to his cave abode.\u201cAh Chuan.\u201d Liu Qiyue immediately stood up.\u201cQiyue.\u201d Meng Chuan\u2019s exhausted face brightened when he saw Liu Qiyue.\u201cI personally cooked some food for you. Try it,\u201d said Liu Qiyue immediately. She covered each plate with her hands and heated the cold dishes up rapidly. Using the power of a Phoenix bloodline to heat food was quite a rare sight.Meng Chuan saw the dishes being heated up. Steam rose from the soup.He was quite touched. Qiyue probably waited quite long for him.\u201cOh, there\u2019s my favorite pork belly.\u201d Meng Chuan\u2019s eyes lit up. He immediately sat down and picked up his chopsticks.\u201cJoin me,\u201d said Meng Chuan immediately.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019m already full,\u201d said Liu Qiyue.\u201cI\u2019m rather hungry,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile. He had been cultivating the Heart Saber Stance for four hours in the Thousand Sabers Cavern. He was naturally very hungry, and he enjoyed the meal.Liu Qiyue watched from the side with a smile, but she still said, \u201cAh Chuan, don\u2019t tire yourself out from cultivating. My master said that persisting in cultivation when you\u2019re exhausted is harmful.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know.\u201d Meng Chuan nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s useless no matter how many times I tell you this,\u201d Liu Qiyue said exasperatedly.Meng Chuan smiled without defending himself.If he didn\u2019t paint for more than two hours in the afternoon, he wouldn\u2019t have had the energy to continue practicing his saber in the evening.His painting time wasn\u2019t fixed. It depended on his mood. Sometimes, it was a little short. Other times, it was longer. He didn\u2019t limit the time as long as he enjoyed himself. Therefore, Meng Chuan never had a fixed time for when he returned in the evening. Liu Qiyue often waited for quite some time.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cQiyue, I have a feeling.\u201d Meng Chuan looked at Liu Qiyue and softly said, \u201cI\u2019m not far from achieving Saber Intent. I\u2019ll definitely be able to break through within half a month.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Liu Qiyue\u2019s eyes lit up when she heard that.\u201cIn a few days, I\u2019ll use my saber art in front of you,\u201d said Meng Chuan with a smile.Liu Qiyue nodded. Her eyes were bright. She was extremely happy seeing Meng Chuan becoming stronger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
