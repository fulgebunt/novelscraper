Your family had an accident, you haven\u2019t come back yet.\u201dZhao Lan straightened her sore waist, but still hold the wheat seeds in her hands: \u201cThere\u2019s still a little work left. I\u2019ll go back as soon as I finish. What happened in our family?\u201d\u201cYou still want to work? Your daughter has been killed. Let\u2019s go and you take a look ah.\u201d Hu Changlin said with a worried face.Zhao Lan\u00a0was stunned. But then, she quickly threw away the wheat seeds in her hands and come up to the terrain of the field: \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dHu Changlin\u00a0sighed: \u201cWhile you are working in the field, your mother-in-law and sister-in-law forcefully tied your daughter and sell her to the sick son of Wu Family in the town. Your daughter refused, so she was beaten to death. When I heard she\u2019s not breathing, I came here to\u2026 \u2026\u201dHu Changlin\u00a0hasn\u2019t finished his words, but\u00a0Zhao Lan\u00a0already runs in a hurry.*There were many people outside the Bai Family\u2019s house, and these people continue whispering near their courtyard.When\u00a0Zhao Lan\u00a0rushed inside, she saw her daughter lying on the straw mat with no breath.Zhao Lan\u2018s legs soften, and she stumbled next to her daughter\u2019s body. She took her cold hand and looked at her daughter\u2019s wounded face.\u00a0Zhao Lan\u00a0was heartbroken, she wanted to cry out loud, but she could only open her mouth, as her tears keep falling down.The Bai Family\u2019s first daughter-in-law, Mrs. Liu, came out of the house and saw the third daughter-in-law of the family came back. She raised an eyebrow, as her grim face showed a dissatisfied look: \u201cHow come you are here? Have you finished the work in the field? If not, then don\u2019t think about eating at night.\u201dZhao Lan\u2018s eyes were red. Her face was full of anger. She turned her head and shouted to Mrs. Liu: \u201cWho made my daughter like this? Who is it?!\u201dMrs. Liu was shocked,\u00a0Zhao Lan\u00a0has always been silent and allowed herself to be bullied. No matter how much she scolded and forced her to work, she never heard her complain, nor yell at her like this.\u201cWhat are you yelling for? It\u2019s me and\u00a0niang, so what? Huh? Who told her to be disobedient? The Bai Family had spent a lot of food to raise her to grow up this big. But she dared not listen to her grandmother and aunt?!\u201dMrs. Liu\u2019s said with killing intent. In anger,\u00a0Zhao Lan\u00a0crawled up to ground and rushed toward Mrs. Liu. She then slapped her face with both hands again and again: \u201cI work like a horse all day long. But you still dare calculate my daughter\u2019s food? Didn\u2019t we earn every meal you give us? There were several people in the family, but only I do the work. I work alone, but have you ever heard a single complain to my mouth?\u201d\u201cShe was only twelve! She was only twelve!\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu was beaten by\u00a0Zhao Lan\u2018s every slap. She had been married into this family for a long time, but she was never been beaten like this. Especially, not in front of so many people in the village. Mrs. Liu sat down on the ground with her butt and shouted: \u201cBeat me, come on, beat me to death, come!\u201dSeeing the lively show, the villagers outside the courtyard couldn\u2019t help but shook their head: \u201cTo have such a sister-in-law and mother-in-law,\u00a0Zhao Lan\u00a0was really unlucky.\u201d\u201cOriginally, the work in the field was done by the Bai family\u2019s three sons. But, when Old Bai and the third son died, the work fell to the youngest daughter-in-law. Say, regarding this matter, the second son also has a daughter, right? Which is a bit much older. So, why they didn\u2019t\u00a0 sell that child first?\u201d\u201cThe sick bully picked this child.\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

And what is the difference between this little girl and the second son\u2019s daughter? That man shouldn\u2019t be too short-sighted.\u201d\u00a0Hu Changlin, who had just returned after calling\u00a0Zhao Lan\u00a0from the field said.Mrs.\u00a0Liu kept shouting. So, Old Lady Bai, who picked up the dried clothes from the backyard, immediately dropped the clothes. And rushed with a stick, after hearing the noise.\u201cWho hit you ah?\u201d Old Lady Bai asked, as soon as she saw Mrs. Liu sitting on the ground and crying.Mrs. Liu pointed her finger at\u00a0Zhao Lan: \u201cZhao Lan, she hit me, niang, you have to seek justice for me.\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai saw\u00a0Zhao Lan, she remembered that this woman\u2019s child has died. This woman\u2019s daughter has died, so she had to return the 12 silvers that were already been given to her. Which made her felt in pain and heartbroken.Without hesitation, Old Lady Bai rushed forward and hit hard\u00a0Zhao Lan\u00a0a few times.Zhao Lan\u00a0was heartbroken. She was completely immersed with the thought of her dead daughter. She didn\u2019t notice that the old lady was holding a stick and rushing towards her. So, as soon as the stick slammed to her body, she fell to the ground and fainted.The villagers were still standing in front of the courtyard.\u00a0Hu Changlin\u00a0saw this, so he shouted: \u201cThis old lady just killed her granddaughter, but still couldn\u2019t let go of her daughter-in-law.\u201dHu Changlin\u00a0pushed the people around him with his hand and rushed inside the courtyard. Then, he shouted at Old Lady Bai: \u201cYou old woman, how can your heart be so poisonous? Do you want to kill her?\u201dOld Lady Bai also didn\u2019t expect\u00a0Zhao Lan\u00a0to fell on the ground after just a few hits of the stick. This was not the first time she hit her. This daughter-in-law\u2019s skin and flesh were thick. How could she fell down after a few hits?On the side, Mrs. Liu stopped crying. She then rushed to the old lady and said: \u201cNiang, if you kill Zhao Lan, who will do the work to the field in the future?\u201dAt this time, the little girl who was lying on the straw mat suddenly opened her eyes. She actually regained consciousness a bit earlier, but she was confused and haven\u2019t accepted the fact that she, a famous doctor from 23rd century become an ancient little peasant girl.After sitting up, she couldn\u2019t help but knitted her eyebrows in pain. The two women were so cruel and killed this 12 yr old child.\u201cThe corpse move, the corpse move!\u201d The villagers in front suddenly shouted.Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu also saw the dead little girl sat up. Both of them was scared to death and fell to the ground.Old Lady Bai pushed Mrs. Liu forward and shouted: \u201cIt\u2019s her, she, she wants to sell you and use the 12 silvers for her son, Dabao. It\u2019s none of my business.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu shrunk and shouted back in a hurry: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not me. Your grandmother said she wanted to have a few new clothes. She said that as long as she sells\u00a0you, there will be money to buy a few fabric. It\u2019s none of my business. It has nothing to do with me.\u201dBai Zhi looked up and stared at them. Her eyes look extremely cold. Which made the people\u2019s facial expression not even as good as a pig\u2019s face.Originally, because of a headache and painful injuries. she intended to pretend unconscious for a while more. But, when she heard what they said, she couldn\u2019t stand it. So, she gritted her teeth and endured.Feeling lazy to talk nonsense, Bai Zhi went straight to\u00a0Zhao Lan\u00a0and look at her injuries. Her right arm was fractured. Her head has a swelling lump. Her skin has bruises and some of it has blood. But, all in all, her injuries were not heavy. Her unconscious state was only temporary. She will wake up soon.At this time, the villagers keep squeezing themselves to the front. After looking, they saw Bai Zhi was still alive, but she has a lot of purple bruises. Not to mention, she really looked miserable.Zhao Lan\u00a0collapsed to the ground, after being hit by a laundry stick.\u201cWhat happened? Who did this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Save my motherVillage Chief Li glared at the old lady and Mrs. Liu.But, because the two of them saw Bai Zhi actually didn\u2019t die. They were naturally not scared. They both climbed up from the ground.Old Lady Bai replied: \u201cThis is our family\u2019s problem. There\u2019s nothing important issue into it, so I would rather like it if you won\u2019t bother us.\u201dVillage Chief Li angrily said: \u201cNothing important? You almost killed a person. Do you know what will happen if you killed her? Fortunately, the little girl didn\u2019t die. Otherwise, you two will go straight to prison.\u201dOld Lady Bai got a bit scared, but she still smiled and said: \u201cYou can still tell a joke despite your old age ah. Who hasn\u2019t encountered a one or two of these issues? But, does anyone who killed a child went to prison?\u201dOn the side, Bai Zhi stood up and coldly said: \u201cThat is because no one has reported the crime. That\u2019s why the officials didn\u2019t pay attention. If I died and my mother went to the government office and reported it. Do you think both of you can run?\u201dVillage Chief Li lifted an eyebrow and stared at Bai Zhi. He thought this child doesn\u2019t know much.\u201cWhat Bai Zhi had said is right. That is the real case.\u201d Village Chief Li said and nodded.Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu look at each other. Their eyes were full of horror. Inside their heart, they were very thankful that this dead girl had survived. Otherwise, they will live miserably.Bai Zhi saw Zhao Lan, who was lying on the ground seemed to move, but haven\u2019t woke up yet.Her eyes suddenly lit up and had an idea. She busily showed a pitiful expression and head towards the old lady: \u201cGrandmother, my niang was injured. I beg you, please find a doctor to cure her.\u201dOld Lady Bai frowned her eyebrows. Her face become cold: \u201cFind a doctor? If we have money to spare, do you think you will die? This dead girl, your mind must be clouded. With just a few stick hits, you want me to spend money to a doctor? You must be dreaming!\u201dThe old lady\u2019s answer was already beyond the villager\u2019s expectation. When Old Bai, her husband, and her third son fell on the roof and had big injuries. The old lady was also very reluctant to spend money to ask the doctor for treatment. And so they lost their lives.How can a person who was so cruel to her husband and son, be good to her daughter-in-law?Bai Zhi turned her head and cried out loud: \u201cVillage Chief, my niang is dying. Please, I beg you to save my niang.\u201dIn the old village chief\u2019s eyes, it can be seen that he cares about this child. Earlier, when he just came back from the mountain, he saw the old lady. He disagreed with her plan. He tried to convince her, to just let the mother and child lived happily together.But, who would have thought that this old lady will be more and more unreasonable? If he won\u2019t use this opportunity to teach the old lady a lesson, she will surely come up with a more hideous plan.Village Chief Li made up his mind and said to Old Lady Bai: \u201cHurry, call for a doctor. If something bad happened to her, this can only be blamed to the two of you.\u201dOld Lady Bai didn\u2019t make any movement, so Village Chief Li\u2019s face darkens: \u201cThere were many people have witnessed that you have beaten her to death. If this will be reported, let\u2019s see if you two can get away from it. When the officials come, we will serve as the witnesses.\u201dOld Lady Bai was full of hate and anger. This Village Chief and villagers were too noisy.\u00a0 She hated this mother and child but has no intention to kill any of them. 12 was the prime of age, where the body was strong and can work all year round, so she planned to sell her with a good price to get some benefits.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Left with one breathBut now, the child was asking her to spend money to get a doctor? This thing was even more painful than cutting her own flesh.However, when she thought her third daughter-in-law will die due to untimely treatment. Her heart began to feel nervous again. What should she do if this dead girl reported her crime and the officials came to arrest her?Although money is important, it can only be spent when a person was still alive.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll find a doctor for her.\u201d Old Lady Bai gritted her teeth and said. She will find a doctor once the villagers have scattered. And at that time, she will tell the doctor to only use the most affordable medicine to just ensure the person will not die.But, who would have thought, an actual doctor joined in the crowd. Or maybe, he was already expecting this to happen, so he had a medicine box with him.Doctor\u00a0Lu squeezed out himself from the crowd and immediately approached the semi-unconscious Zhao Lan: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go. I happened to pass by in here. I will check her condition.\u201dWhen Doctor Lu checked Zhao Lan\u2019s injuries, his frowned eyebrows relaxed a bit.But, when he looked up to see the old lady, his face becomes ugly: \u201cOld lady, I must say, you are really harsh. This person was only left with one breath. If you want her to survive, we had to feed her with ginseng soup. I will also give her acupuncture treatment to help her a bit more.\u201dHearing the nonsense of the doctor, Bai Zhi wanted to laugh at him, but she dared not to do so.Old Lady Bai has been a bully in their entire village. But, this old doctor has never been bullied by her before.Old Lady Bai stared at Doctor Lu suspiciously, and said: \u201cHow can that be? She is my daughter-in-law, so why wouldn\u2019t I know her? This woman\u2019s skin and flesh were thick. So, how can a few hits of stick leave her with one breath? Are you trying to scare me?\u201dAs soon as Bai Zhi heard this, her blood started to boil.This dead little girl Bai and Zhao Lan had never lived a good day in this so-called home. All they do was nothing but work all day. However, once the member of the family gets angry, no matter who, they will bend their depressed mood unto their body. They will hit them, nonstop.\u00a0The old lady sees it, but it seems like a natural event for her.Anger rage from her chest. There were so many people in the scene, so how could Bai Zhi let the old woman just go?\u201cGrandmother, niang is almost dying. Can\u2019t you see it? Please, I beg you. Niang work all day like a horse for the sake of the family. So, please save my niang.\u201dDoctor Lu knitted his eyebrows and looked at the old lady: \u201cIf you want her to be cured you have to tell me your decisions right now. It will take some time to concoct a medicine and apply acupuncture treatment. If you delay further, she might even breathe her last breath.\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu heard this, she hurriedly pulled the sleeve of her mother-in-law. \u201cNiang, let her get treatment. Don\u2019t be disheartened, we can collect again the money from them. If she died, we will not only have nightmares, but we will also get into prison.\u201dThis old woman was now in the old age, so it doesn\u2019t matter if she gets into prison, but she was different. She was still young. She doesn\u2019t want her life to be spent in prison, just because of a few pieces of money.At this time, everyone\u2019s eyes were staring at the old lady. Old Lady Bai knew she had no other choice, so she nodded her head: \u201cOkay, cure her, but I don\u2019t have a money right now. Let me owe you this one first.\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu frowned. \u201cThe consultation fee can be own. After all, we are all from the same village. But, the money for the medicine cannot.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Will treat or not?Old Lady Bai was embarrassed. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t really have a money right now. I can\u2019t afford to buy your ginseng. Can\u2019t you use other medicine?\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu think for a moment, then said: \u201cAlthough the effect of the ladybell root is less effective than ginseng. It is much stronger than any normal tonic. The price is also much cheaper.\u201dOld Lady Bai was overjoyed after hearing this: \u201cThen, use that ladybell root.\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu took out a brush and paper from his medicine chest and quickly wrote a prescription, for the old lady to read: \u201cThis is the prescription for Zhao Lan. You look if there is no problem, then I\u2019ll go and take the medicine.\u201dBoth the old lady and Mrs. Liu were illiterate. So, seeing the prescription, they felt like reading the book of heaven. There was no single word they could understand.Mrs.\u00a0Liu smiled and handed the prescription back to Doctor Lu: \u201cLu\u00a0dafu, we can\u2019t read it. Just tell us how much money we have to pay.\u201dDoctor Lu took the prescription and knitted his eyebrow, then he reluctantly looked at the old lady: \u201cThe consultation fee is 1 silver, the medicine is 3 silvers. A total of 4 silver coins. If you are really on a tight budget, you can owe the consultation fee, but the medicine fee must be given first.\u201d\u201cWhat? 4 silvers?\u201d Old Lady Bai almost slipped, when she heard the price: \u201cDo we really have to pay 4 silvers for these injuries? Are you trying to rob us?\u201dWhen Doctor Lu heard her words, his face immediately sank: \u201cIf that is the case, then you send her to the medical museum in the town. Let see if you will only spend 4 silvers as a treatment fee.\u201dWho knows who the person was, but one of the villagers from\u00a0outside, suddenly open his mouth and said: \u201cThe person was badly hurt like this, but only take 4 silvers to be cured? Last year, my cousin had a cold so we went to the town. The medical museum used only a few medicines but we spent 3 silvers. Zhao Lan was badly wounded. If she will be taken to the town, the cost will definitely be a dozen silvers.\u201dA dozen silvers?\u00a0It\u2019s better to ask for her life directly.Seeing Doctor Lu taking his medicine box, Old Lady Bai rushed toward him and said with a smile: \u201cLu\u00a0dafu, I didn\u2019t mean anything by that. Don\u2019t mind this old woman too much.\u201dDoctor Lu was too lazy to take care of the old lady. He looked towards Zhao Lan, then asked: \u201cIs this person will be treated or not?\u201d\u201cTreat! of course, she must be treated.\u201d Old Lady Bai laughed and said. But, she actually felt in pain. As if she was stabbed by a knife. She saved money for years. She didn\u2019t even spend money on her husband and third son. So, who would have thought she will spend money on this woman.Doctor\u00a0Lu nodded his head: \u201cOk, then I\u2019ll go and pick up the medicine. You ready the money.\u201dIf it was someone else, he will not care about this issue. Old Lady Bai was famous in the village for being stingy and shameless.Doctor Lu took his medicine box and turned to go. But, Bai Zhi stopped him: \u201cLu\u00a0dafu, my niang\u2019s hand was fractured. Can you put a bandage on her before you go?\u201dDoctor Lu was stunned. Zhao Lan\u2019s hand was fractured? Why he didn\u2019t find it.Doctor Lu turned back and went to Zhao Lan\u2019s side. Then, he checked her hands. Her right hand was swelling and has obvious scars. He had seen these injuries, but he thought it was only the same as the other injuries on her body. He didn\u2019t expect that it was actually fractured. But, it\u2019s strange, how did the child know that it was fractured?Doctor Lu put down his medicine box and took out a bandage and a splint.\u00a0Then, he coldly looked at the old lady and Mrs. Liu: \u201cYou really know how to use your hands. Fortunately, you only hurt her hand. If your stick landed on her head, I\u2019m sure you guys will now enter the prison.\u201dDafu\u00a0\u2013 doctorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: My daughter is still aliveWith regards to this matter, both Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu become really scared. The two of them was already scared enough when Bai Zhi faked her death.When Doctor Lu was wrapping a bandage on Zhao Lan\u2019s arm, Bai Zhi helped him. The child was very skillful, so Doctor Lu was very surprised:\u00a0This child was very skillful. As if it was not her first time. Was this just a coincidence?After the wound was completely wrapped with bandage, Zhao Lan woke up. At first glance, she the straw mat was empty. Zhao Lan didn\u2019t put in mind the pain she felt, and just immediately climbed up: \u201cMy daughter? Where is my daughter?\u201d\u201cNiang, I\u2019m here.\u201d Bai Zhi stood behind Zhao Lan. Seeing Zhao Lan\u2019s back shaking in panic, Bai Zhi\u2019s heart felt a bit sour.In her previous life, when her mother and father divorced, she was still very young. Her father always complained when her mother remarried. In the end, she was abandoned by him. She grew up in the orphanage. She had never seen this distressed looked to her father. Which unknowingly made her feel touched.Zhao Lan looked back and saw her daughter standing behind her. She both cried and smiled. She pinched her harm until it reddens, and said: \u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019m not dreaming. My daughter didn\u2019t die. My daughter is still alive.\u201dZhao Lan wanted to hug her daughter into her arms but was afraid to aggravate her daughter\u2019s injuries. So, she only held her daughter\u2019s hand tightly: \u201cZhi\u2019er, niang is useless, niang failed to protect you and let you suffer.\u201dWhen Bai Zhi saw how Zhao Lan deeply loved her, she shook her head, as her eyes redden: \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m not hurt.\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai saw Zhao Lan, she immediately said to Doctor Lu: \u201cSee, there is nothing wrong with her. You don\u2019t need to treat her. You go straight back to your home!\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do!\u201d Doctor Lu doesn\u2019t want to let go of the old lady: \u201cI healed her fractured hand, plus my consultation fee. Although the cost is not 4 silvers anymore, it\u2019s still 2 silvers.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Old Lady Bai screamed and added: \u201cThe person now woke up, but you\u2019re still asking for 2 silvers!\u201d\u201cThe person woke up, but I still put a medicine, a splint and a bandage on her fractured hand. It cost 1 silver. Plus the consultation fee is 1 silver. So, it\u2019s a total of 2 silvers.\u201d Doctor Wu coldly said.Old Lady Bai hated it. But in front of so many people, even if she wanted to escape paying the bill, she couldn\u2019t do so.Humph! Just wait and see how I will make you pay for this!Old Lady Bai squinted her eyes and grumbled at Zhao Lan. She then gritted her teeth and went to her room to get her accumulated savings and handed it to Doctor Lu.The next moment, Zhao Lan released her daughter\u2019s pale hand and walked in front of Village Chief Li, then said: \u201cVillage Chief, while you are here, I formally wanted to propose a separation from my family. I hope you can help with this.\u201dThis was the long long hidden intention inside her heart. But today, she was finally able to spoke about it.Ever since her husband died, she and her daughter didn\u2019t have any good day.Every time she saw her mother-in-law and her sister-in-law hit her child, she really wanted to split with the family, but she knows this thing was bad. So, she never dared to speak about it.However, today, when she saw her daughter lying dead on the straw mat, she hated the fact that she couldn\u2019t exchange her life for her. So now that her daughter has come back to life, she could no longer let her live with these two evil. If this continue, her daughter will really die sooner or later.Village Chief Li naturally understand Zhao Lan\u2019s intention, He wanted to support her. These two evil women were becoming more and more outrageous. They treasure their own children, but not the other people\u2019s child.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: SeparationVillage Chief Li turned his head and looked at Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu, then asked: \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAs soon as she gave up the Bai Family\u2019s savings, they wanted to separate?\u201cReturn the silvers to me first!\u201d Old Lady Bai\u2019s heart was bleeding when she loses her money to the doctor. Doctor Lu really had gone too far. Just by thinking that her money will not return, her anger burst: \u201cIf you pay me back, you can get out from the Bai Family!\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu heard this, she immediately got anxious and pulled her mother-in-law\u2019s sleeve. Then, she pushed her to the side and whispered: \u201cNiang, what are you saying? If we divide the family, who will work in the field in the future? Who will wash the clothes? Who will cook?\u201d Zhao Lan is a woman, but she does all the work inside and outside the house. Ever since she lost her husband,\u00a0Bai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu stopped working, so she did the work alone.Although Bai Zhi was still very young, she was timid, so she also cooks and does the laundry. If the two of them leave, who will do all the work in the house? Can they do all those things?Old Lady Bai crossed her arms and sneered at Mrs. Liu: \u201cDon\u2019t you have hands and feet? Can\u2019t you do all those things?\u201dOld Lady Bai\u2019s hate towards the mother and child reached its limit. She doesn\u2019t want to see them again. She was planning to throw them out anyway.\u201cThen, how are you planning to divide the house?\u201d Seeing her mother-in-law was serious. Mrs. Liu has no other choice but to give up.Old Lady Bai shouted: \u201cI won\u2019t give them anything that belongs to Bai Family. If they want to go, they can go!\u201dThe courtyard was not large. So, although they tried hard to speak in a low voice, several people from afar could still hear them.Bai Zhi shook her head and felt bad.Village Chief Li also shook his head. The viciousness and shameless of these two people really gave him an eye-opener.Zhao Lan was very sad. In this home, aside from her daughter, she never felt a human\u2019s warmth. Everyone treated her like a horse, but she treated this place like her own home. So, she never complained although she has suffered again and again and felt wronged.But today, she was finally fully awakened. This family will never accept her and her daughter. Leaving this home perhaps will be a brand new start of their life.Village Chief Li open his mouth and said: \u201cOld Lady Bai, a person should have a conscience. Although your third son is now dead, Zhao Lan was still your daughter-in-law. She\u2019s still part of your family. You should give her a share.\u201dOld Lady Bai was unhappy, so she snorted and said: \u201cVillage Chief, this is our family\u2019s business. You better not try to control us. The headmaster of the Bai Family is me, so I will decide how to divide it.\u201dVillage Chief\u00a0Li wanted to say more, but Zhao Lan stopped him: \u201cVillage Chief, your kindness, I fully understand it. But, you don\u2019t have to say anything more. No matter how she divides it, as long as I and my daughter can be safe, I will be satisfied!\u201dVillage Chief Li sighed and then nodded: \u201cOkay, that\u2019s good!\u201dOld Lady Bai sneered and said:\u00a0\u201cRemember what you said. From now on, you and your daughter will not be part of the Bai Family. And since you are not related to the family, you will not receive a house, a field or any copper coins!\u201dZhao Lan was already expecting this outcome. So, she just turned around and pulled Bai Zhi\u2019s hand. She wanted to leave this place out once.However, Bai Zhi stopped her: \u201cNiang, we will leave this place, but before that, we have to make a written agreement. So that, when we get rich in the future, we don\u2019t need to recognize them as relatives. We should not only leave this house but also severe all ties with them.\u201dDazhu \u2013 first sonErzhu \u2013\u00a0 second sonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: Dogs can\u2019t spit ivoryVillage Chief Li looked at Bai Zhi and laughed: \u201cOh, this child is very clever ah!\u201d Then, he turned around and ask: \u201cDo you have any complaints?\u201dOld Lady Bai wanted to cut off their ties to this mother and child as soon as possible. So that by dinner time, they will beg for foods: \u201cI also have the same idea. Having a written agreement is useful than an empty mouth promise.\u201d Then, she turned around and look at the villagers: \u201cEveryone outside can also serve as witnesses. Starting today, our Bai Family has severed it\u2019s tied to Zhao Lan. And in the future, both of them has nothing to do with our family.\u201dHu Changlin who stayed silent for a long time, could no longer hold it: \u201cOld Lady Bai, you shouldn\u2019t be so heartless, driving the mother and child without any place to stay. How can you do this?\u201dFrom outside, the villagers also said their opinion: \u201cYeah, the mother and child were also injured, but they\u2019re driving them away? Isn\u2019t it too much?\u201dOld Lady Bai grinned: \u201cThis is not my proposal. She\u2019s the one who wanted to split. Didn\u2019t you hear what she said earlier?\u201dHu Changlin replied: \u201cEven if Zhao Lan proposed it, shouldn\u2019t you at least spare a room for them? And if you wanted them to leave the house so bad, shouldn\u2019t you at least give them the hut outside? The hut is still better than nothing.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu busily opened her mouth and said: \u201cThat can\u2019t be. The hut is where I used\u00a0 to raise cattle. If we let them live there, where will our family raise the cattle?\u201dZhao Lan smiled bitterly and went towards Hu Changlin: \u201cHu\u00a0dage, in this home, don\u2019t you still understand my importance? No need to speak about cows, I\u2019m sure I am even inferior to the chicken or duck.\u201dVillage Chief Li no longer wanted to hear the two evil woman\u2019s words, so he said to Zhao Lan and Old Lady Bai: \u201cJust wait, okay? I will go and write the written agreement. And then, I\u2019ll bring it right\u00a0away.\u201d Village Chief Li said and then left the yard. On the side, Hu Changlin said to Zhao Lan: \u201cZhi\u2019er\u2019s niang, don\u2019t think too much about it. It\u2019s not worth it. This evening, you go to my place first, there is still an empty room. Just squeezed yourselves in there for the meantime.\u201dZhao Lan was actually thinking for a place to stay in this evening. Hu Changlin\u2019s words were definitely like a torch that fall in her snowy world. So, she nodded her head and said while crying: \u201cThank you, Hu\u00a0dage.\u201dListening to this, Mrs.\u00a0Liu couldn\u2019t help but feel sour: \u201cWell, well, you haven\u2019t completely separated from the family, but you\u2019re already hooking up a man? You are really talented! Oh, let me guess one more thing, later on, you want your daughter to be Hu Feng\u2019s future wife, right?\u201dHu Changlin lost his wife in early years when she gave birth. Then, his son drowned in the river when he was eighteen years old. Since then, he lived alone. But, three years ago, he saved a young man in the mountain. The young man was very handsome. His physical strength was really great. But because his head was badly injured that year, he couldn\u2019t remember a thing about himself. So, Hu Changlin named him Hu Feng and treated him as his owned son.Hu Changlin swept his cold eyes towards Mrs. Liu: \u201cDon\u2019t think like all the people has the same mind as you. I, Hu Changlin, is not one of your kind. I am not a heartless person like you.\u201dZhao Lan busily adviced Hu Changlin: \u201cHu\u00a0dage, didn\u2019t you just said it\u2019s not worthy to mind them. Just ignore her, a dog cannot spit ivory.\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu heard this, she immediately got furious and scolded Zhao Lan: \u201cZhao Lan, who did you say a dog? You say it again ah, let\u2019s see if you have guts!\u201dZhao Lan didn\u2019t want to ignore Mrs. Liu this time, so she turned and faced her.Mrs. Liu\u2019s got even more furious. Previously, it was her who always bully Zhao Lan. When did they swap position? Remembering Zhao Lan\u2019s slaps on her earlier, Mrs. Liu could no longer suppress her anger, so she turned and took the broomstick in the courtyard and rushed toward Zhao Lan.Dage\u00a0\u2013 brotherDog can\u2019t spit ivory\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0dog can\u2019t speak good words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: Kicked like a dogBai Zhi was facing Mrs. Liu, so when she saw her rushing towards them, she immediately bent her body and picked up the wooden club on the ground. Then, she waved it towards Mrs. Liu and took a great shot. Mrs. Liu\u2019s eyes were focused on Zhao Lan\u2019s body, so she didn\u2019t saw Bai Zhi\u2019s actions. What more, she never think that Bai Zhi, who was obedient and timid, will suddenly hit her. As the wooden club landed on her body, Mrs. Liu yelled in pain.\u201cOh, so you know that this thing hurts? How many times do you think you hit me with this thing when my niang was gone? Have you counted them?\u201d When she just woke up, she was in so much pain. This pain Mrs. Liu felt was nothing compared to her.\u201cDon\u2019t think that I won\u2019t dare to kill you today!\u201d Mrs. Liu has tasted a lot of defeat today. First, Zhao Lan has slapped her. Now, Bai Zhi, who was a little girl hit her. These things were simply humiliating.Bai Zhi was not a vegetarian. Although she was a doctor, she has a wide variety of hobbies. She studied judo, taekwondo, boxing and she was very proficient in them. So although she was lacking\u00a0in strength, she has a flexible body. And that was enough for today.Zhao Lan originally wanted to help. But, it seems her daughter was more than enough. Mrs. Liu\u2019s broomstick didn\u2019t fall on her body. Instead, a wooden club landed on Mrs. Liu\u2019s body again and again. And she keeps shouting in pain.Old Lady Bai went back to her room earlier. But, she heard Mrs. Liu\u2019s cries once again. So, she rushed outside and saw Mrs. Liu was being hit by Bai Zhi. Seeing this, Old Lady Bai\u2019s eyes almost pop out.This Mrs. Liu has a strong personality. She never ate a defeat. But today, she was being kicked like a dog by a little girl.Old Lady Bai looked for a stick in the courtyard and wanted to rush to help Mrs. Liu. But seeing Mrs. Liu\u2019s injuries, the old lady think first for a moment. If she was hit by that wooden club for a few times, will she die in suffocation?Although Old Lady Bai had thought like that, she still lifted her foot and kicked Mrs. Liu on the ground. So, the old lady was hit again and again. But of course, Bai Zhi was a doctor, so she knew were to hit on the safe spot. It will not kill a person.Old Lady Bai didn\u2019t think that this little girl will not only hit her aunt but also hit her grandmother. The wooden club hit her old body a few times, so she almost fainted. But, whenever she was about to faint, the little girl will pinch her, so she will wake up again. She couldn\u2019t totally lose her consciousness.Seeing this scene, although she was shocked, Zhao Lan didn\u2019t stop her daughter. She knew how much pain her daughter had eaten in the hands of this two evil. She almost lost her life in their hands. So at this time, it\u2019s only normal to get furious. But, when did her daughter had this kind of skills?\u201cOkay, okay, stop fighting. Let\u2019s stop before someone died again.\u201d Village Chief Li shouted from outside. He originally arrived much earlier, but he wanted the two evil women suffered a bit. However, this little girl really made him admired her.After hearing Village Chief Li\u2019s words, Bai Zhi stopped swinging the wooden club. Her arms also felt sore anyway. Bai Zhi threw away the wooden club and looked at them coldly: \u201cRemember, I\u2019ll see you again. So, try not to walk around outside.\u201dOld Lady Bai pointed her finger at Bai Zhi, but she couldn\u2019t utter a word. In the end, she looked at Village Chief Li and said: \u201cVillage Chief, did you hear that? This little girl has become lawless. She dared to kill us. I, I want to go to the government office and report her. I want her to be in the prison.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Eye openerVillage Chief\u00a0Li looked at the old lady from head to toe and then shook his head: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you don\u2019t have any injuries to your body. How will you go\u00a0and report that you\u2019ve been hit by a little girl? Why don\u2019t you look at Bai Zhi? Her body was full of injuries. So, who do think obviously was hit?\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu heard this, her face turn pale. She quickly grabbed her mother-in-law\u2019s sleeve and shook her head vigorously.Old Lady Bai looked at Bai Zhi. Her body was full of bluish-purple bruises, her clothes have blood, which was enough evidence. This little girl hit them multiple times, but why they don\u2019t any bruise? If they went to the government office, they will naturally lose.Old Lady Bai shouted: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to go to the government office. You are our Village Chief. You\u2019ve just seen it! Let them pay me 4 silvers!\u201dVillage Chief Li shook his head: \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d Then, he turned around and ask the villagers: \u201cHave you guys seen it?\u201dThe villagers shook their head: \u201cWe didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d\u201cHey, this is? Are you guys saying that I am lying?\u201d\u00a0 Old Lay Bai was anxious.Bai Zhi was happy. Her neighbors were interesting people.Village Chief Li waved his hand and said: \u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense. This is the agreement contract that will prove your family had separate. Take a look at it. If there is no problem, put your fingerprints\u201dOld Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu don\u2019t know how to read. But, they can feel that the village chief was helping the mother and child. So, Old Lady Bai went inside their house and called out Bai Xiaofeng, who was sleeping.Bai Xiaofeng studied in school for two years now. So, he can read the contract for them.When Bai Xiaofeng took the contract, his face becomes dark. Whenever he goes to school, he could see some of his classmates, being served with a tea by their maidservant.Their family cannot afford to buy him a maidservant, so he treated Bai Zhi as his servant girl. And Bai Zhi treated him like a real young master.If the people leave, who will serve him?Bai Xiaofeng was so angry and immediately torn the contract. He looked at the old lady and said: \u201cGrandmother, have you gone crazy? If we separate, who will serve me at school? I\u2019m going to be the top scholar student. Who will serve me by then?\u201dAlthough the old lady hated the mother and child, Bai Xiaofeng was his favorite grandson. This grandson was the hope of their family!\u201cOkay, okay, we\u2019ll do as what Xiaofeng has said, we won\u2019t separate! Let\u2019s go back inside the house, so you can continue your studies\u2026 \u2026\u201d Old Lady Bai coaxed and took Bai Xiaofeng back to the house, and then came out to see Zhao\u00a0 Lan.Without any scruples, Old Lady Bai said to Zhao Lan and in front of so many people: \u201cYou want to separate? You must be dreaming! You think you can find another man after sucking the Bai Family\u2019s money? Zhao Lan, since your married in the Bai family, you can only stay. You will never leave here unless you become a ghost!\u201d\u201cVillage Chief, we will not divide our family, you go back to your house!\u201d After finishing her words, Old Lady Bai was about to leave. However, she noticed Bai Zhi coldly staring at her. So, she turned and looked towards her: \u201cAnd you, you dead girl, you ate the Bai Family\u2019s food for 12 years, so do you think you can just leave?\u201dThis is an eye-opener. We must separate from this family as soon as possible and draw a clear line!\u00a0Bai Zhi secretly made a decision inside her heart.Bai Zhi sneers inside her heart, but she didn\u2019t show it on her face: \u201cPeople that live here only eat, drink and sleep! So naturally, we will stay! But, I\u2019m sure, if we eat more and work less, you will eventually throw us away!\u201dOld Lady Bai didn\u2019t want to continue talking to Bai Zhi. And regardless of the villager\u2019s presence, she and Mrs. Liu left the yard and returned to the large room, where they lived.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: GossipVillage Chief Li shook his head and really felt sorry inside his heart. But in the end, it was true, that this was Bai Family\u2019s business. It\u2019s not good to meddle too much.\u201cOh, how unlucky ah. You\u2019re all hurt\u2026 \u2026\u201d Village Chief Lo approached the wounded Zhao Lan and looked at Hu Changlin: \u201cIf they lived in this broken house, their injuries will get worse. Old Hu, what do you think? Can they stay at your house for at least two days?\u201dAlthough Zhao Lan was a widow, she was known for being an honest person. Hu Changlin was also the same. So, hearing this, the villagers didn\u2019t open their mouth to speak. They didn\u2019t dare to make irresponsible remarks. They just went back to their homes.Bai Zhi can see that Hu Changlin and Village Chief Li were really a good-natured people, so she has no opinion. On the other hand, Zhao Lan was very worried. She was a widow and her daughter was still very young. In the Hu Family, only Hu Changlin and Hu Feng live in there. If she brings her child, she might hear terrible remarks. She was quite old now, so she has no worries for herself. But her daughter was different. In the future, she would like to find her a good husband, so she shouldn\u2019t let her reputation be tainted.After thinking carefully, Zhao Lan looked towards them: \u201cHu dage, Village Chief, thank you for your kindness. But, since we can\u2019t separate from the family, we will leave it like that. My daughter and I were injured. We don\u2019t want to burden anyone.\u201dBoth Hu Changlin and Village Chief Li know her real concerns. So, they understand her choice. After all, a woman\u2019s reputation was far greater than anything. Because it is related to a lifetime happiness. She shouldn\u2019t be careless.The two men were planning to leave, but suddenly, they heard a thunderstorm up in the air. Coupled with the strong wind, all the dust rose up in the courtyard, and they lose a sight.Nobody could react. They couldn\u2019t only listen to a few more noises. But, when they tried to look back, the broken house has already collapsed.This was not the first time the broken house collapsed. But, whenever it happened, Zhao Lan and her daughter hide in the large house and slept in there for a night. Once the rain stopped, she would repair their house. She continued to live like that until today. But, with her fractured arm, how could she fix it?Don\u2019t say that she has two brothers-in-law, even if those two returned, they wouldn\u2019t help her.Seeing this condition, Hu Changlin said, \u201cZhao Lan, I\u2019m afraid that this is not a good time to repair your house. Let\u2019s just do it this way, I have a small cabin behind our main house. Although it is very simple, it can be used as a shelter. In that cabin, you don\u2019t need to worry about gossips. Would you like to stay in there for a few days?\u201dWhen Village Chief Li heard this, he hurriedly persuaded Zhao Lan: \u201cThis is a good idea. I know that cabin, it was like a wooden hut, at least in there, you don\u2019t need to worry about the sudden gush of the strong wind or the rain. You and your daughter were injured, it\u2019s not good for you two to sleep in the mud.\u201dZhao Lan looked at the large house. The door was closed. According to her intuition, they have locked it inside. Today, they were not qualified to sleep in there. They can only sleep in the mud.Seeing her daughter\u2019s appearance, she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to endure the cold rain all night.So, she gritted her teeth and finally nodded her head: \u201cHu dage, thank you.\u201dHu Changlin quickly waved his hand: \u201cWhat are you thanking me for, it\u2019s nothing but an old empty cabin. You wait here, I\u2019ll help you get the quilt inside your house. I don\u2019t have an extra in our home.\u201d Hu Changlin said in a hurry and enter the half-collapsed broken house. In there, he took the patched quilt and two old wooden basins.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: Sexy ManBai Zhi also went inside and picked up a few ordinary clothes.Village Chief Li took the tubs from Hu Changlin\u2019s hands and said, \u201cHurry, let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll send you two girls in there before this heavy rain pours.\u201dZhao Lan responded with a quick step and pulled Bai Zhi out the courtyard with Hu Changlin.But, just as they walked halfway in the road, the heavy rain poured down. So, they trotted and came in first in Hu Changlin\u2019s house. Hu Changlin said to the mother and child: \u201cYou guys take a shelter here first. When the rain stops, you go and clean the cabin. So, that your quilt will not get dirty and wet.\u201dWith this agreement, Village Chief Li borrowed a piece of clothing to Hu Changlin and went back to his home in the rain.Hu Changlin then led Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi to sit in the living room. But, their butt hasn\u2019t touched the chair, when they heard a noise in the backyard. Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan quickly followed behind Hu Changlin.However, it turns out, Hu Feng came back from the mountain. He was sitting half-naked in the backyard and washing his clothes soaked in sweat.As the raindrops fell on his sturdy body. The crystallized water drops continued to slide, from his smooth back, up to his navy blue colored waistband. Which made him look extremely hot and sexy.His tan skin didn\u2019t lessen the handsomeness of his face. A face that was enough to kill all the women.Bai Zhi swallowed her saliva, as she continued looking at the young man\u2019s bare body.Hu Changlin spoke with a smile: \u201cHu Feng, from now on, Zhao Lan and Zhi\u2019er will live\u00a0in the cabin. But now, because of the rain, they stayed first inside the house.\u201dHu Feng looked at Zhao Lan and nodded his head. He then swept his eyes towards Bai Zhi. His eyes didn\u2019t stay long staring at them, he continued washing his clothes.Hu Changlin said: \u201cDon\u2019t mind, Hu Feng. He originally doesn\u2019t talk much. It\u2019s not because you\u2019re not welcome here.\u201dZhao Lan smiled and nodded. \u201cI know that. When I went to the mountain to pick wild vegetables, I nearly fell on the slope, Hu Feng saved me. I haven\u2019t thanked him, but he left.\u201dHu Changlin laughed: \u201cThere is such a thing. I\u2019ve never heard of it. You two sit first, I\u2019ll go and prepare the dinner. Just eat dinner here, before you go to the cabin to rest.\u201dAs soon as Bai Zhi heard his words, she pulled up her sleeves and said: \u201cI\u2019ll go too. I\u2019ll help you prepare dinner. Where is the kitchen?\u201dHu Changlin waved his hand and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to. You also have wounds on your body. Go and have some rest. Once your wounds healed, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201dHowever, once Bai Zhi found the kitchen, she walked straight in there without looking back: \u201cI\u2019m not hurt, it\u2019s only skin injuries. I\u2019ll be fine in a few days.\u201dHu Changlin\u2019s eyes swept over Zhao Lan. Zhao Lan felt bad inside her heart. Her daughter was hurt like this. But, because they were staying in someone else home and they will eat, her daughter was forcing herself to work: \u201cIf she wants to do it, let her do so. It\u2019s just her cooking skill is bad. Please forgive her in advance.\u201dMy cooking skill is bad?Bai Zhi smiled, the previous Bai Zhi\u2019s cooking skill was bad. But she, her cooking skill was no worst than the head chef in a nine-start hotel.However, aside from the pots and pans, there was nothing else inside the kitchen, but vegetable seeds.After searching for a long time, she finally found a jar of rice at the bottom of the cabinet. The jar was only as big as an ordinary cylindrical bottle. So no need to mention about four people\u2019s meal. Even two people cannot eat with this amount. In the memory of dead Bai Zhi, she has never seen, nor eaten a white rice before. She only eats rice soup all the time. No wonder she was very thin.The Bai Family has 5 acres of land. If all their harvest will be sold, it was enough to feed the whole family. However, the Bai Family used their earnings to support Bai Xioafeng\u2019s studies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Sweet Potato PorridgeEach year, their earnings need to be spent to buy Bai Xiaofeng inks and papers. Because of this, the Bai Family lived in poverty.Hu Family only has 2 acres of land. Although only two people live here, their food was only enough for them. So in case of emergency, such as sickness, or if they bought some needed things, their food will be strained.Bai Zhi sighed and then started making a fire on the stove first. Then, she boiled a pot of water. She washed the rice in another pot.After adding some more firewood to the stove, she walked out of the kitchen and asked Hu Feng, who was currently hanging his clothes: \u201cHu Feng, where is your family\u2019s food?\u201dHu Feng looked back at her and then pointed his finger to a pile of blackening things in the corner of the kitchen.These are foods?\u00a0Bai Zhi took one and then came out again to asked Hu Feng: \u201cWhat kind of food is this?\u201dHowever,\u00a0Hu Feng ignored her and went straight into the house.Is that guy dumb?Bai Zhi took back the black thing in the kitchen and tried peeling the skin. After cutting a few parts, she smelled a sweet scent. It smelled like a sweet potato.Bai Zhi\u00a0tasted a small piece to confirm it. It really tasted like a sweet potato, but she couldn\u2019t understand why it looks so ugly and colored black.If she added this sweet potato, they don\u2019t need to eat rice soup for dinner.Bai Zhi washed a few sweet potatoes. She peeled the skin and cut them into small pieces. Then, she threw them into the pot of water with the rice to make a sweet potato porridge.Bai Zhi also used to eat sweet potato porridge before. Aside from its sweet taste, it can easily make a person feel full, and its a very suitable dish for poor people.After half an hour, she put the sweet-smelled potato porridge on the table. The original watery rice soup has thickened with the rice. It looks very appetizing and smells good, which couldn\u2019t help but attract everyone\u2019s attention.So, instead of waiting to be called by Hu Changlin, Hu Feng himself come out in his room on his own. When he came out, he saw the sweet potato porridge on the table. He knitted his eyebrows and looked at Bai Zhi.Hu Changlin laughed and said: \u201cOh, so originally you can eat this lump like this? We only boiled it in the water, before deciding to eat it.\u201d\u201cLump? Isn\u2019t this a sweet potato? Why do you call it a lump?\u201d Bai Zhi looked very curious.Hu Changlin was also full of doubt: \u201cThis thing is called sweet potato? This is also our first time eating this. Hu Feng dug it out from the mountain. We didn\u2019t dare to eat it at once. The rice was not enough, so I boiled this thing twice to be sure before we eat it.\u201dThey don\u2019t know that it was a sweet potato\u2026 \u2026?When she took some of the sweet potatoes earlier, she found some green shoots. So, she said: \u201cThese two green shoots can be planted on the courtyard. It will grow on its own. After two to three months, it will bear some fruits. It doesn\u2019t need fertilizer, so it\u2019s very easy to take care of.\u201dHu Changlin\u2019s eyes lit up and then laughed: \u201cThese things are good ah. When I plant the peanuts on the field, I will also plant these things. Whether it grew or not, it\u2019s not a big loss for a simple effort.\u201dHu Feng stared at the porridge in front of him and said: \u201cCan we eat now?\u201d After smelling it, his stomach could no longer wait.After he went to the field to work early this morning, he didn\u2019t have\u00a0breakfast and lunch. He specifically waited for the meal at night.Hu Changlin then busily said: \u201cLet\u2019s have dinner, I\u2019m already hungry. I could no longer hold it.\u201dAside from Bai Zhi, it was everyone\u2019s first time to eat a soft and sweet porridge. Hu Changlin couldn\u2019t stop grinning because of this.A pot of sweet potato porridge was soon eaten, Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi deliberately eat less. After all, it was someone else\u2019s home, and the two big men were hungry the whole day. They usually don\u2019t have competitors with the food, so the pot was soon cleaned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t speak another word.Bai Zhi looked at the drifting back of Hu Feng with a strange look, then whispered: \u201cHu\u00a0bo, why he doesn\u2019t like to talk?\u201dHu Changlin sighed and said: \u201cRegarding this matter, Hu Feng is quite pitiful. I was cutting some woods in the mountain three years ago. When I was about to go back home, I found him in the dark ditched at the foot of the mountain. At that time, he was seriously injured. Especially, on his head part, a lot of blood was oozing out. When I saw he was still alive, I brought him to a doctor. But, when he woke up, he couldn\u2019t remember anything, even his name. So, he got stuck in here and lived with me for three years now.\u201d\u201cIn fact, if you will look at him closely, you will notice that he is very different to poor people like us. He likes to be clean, he is literate, and he knows martial arts. He must not be an ordinary person. He just forgot who he is, so he couldn\u2019t go back.\u201dBai Zhi is a doctor. A famous doctor of the most prestigious hospital\u00a0in the 23rd century. She mastered the Chinese medicine and Western medicine before the age of 18. She can both use silver needles and medicines to heal the patients.So after listening to Hu Changlin\u2019s words, her first analysis was that, because Hu Feng was seriously wounded on his head, he had a lot of congestion on his brain, and these blood clots were oppressing his brain nerves. Some people lose their eyes sight or memory in this kind of situation.This kind of disease was not unusual in the 23rd century. And it\u2019s quite easy to treat. The surgeon only need cut open the skull and then remove the congestion in the brain. This surgery is not a major operation. And statistically, the success rate was 90%.Bai Zhi has performed this operation not less than 100 times, and her success rate is 100%.Unfortunately, she was now living in the ancient time of a different world. There was no hospital apparatuses and instruments. And so, she can\u2019t perform that surgery.At this point in time, the rain outside has stopped, and the sun was still up in the sky. Daytime during the summer season was long. So, if she guessed it right, the time was 6 o\u2019clock in the evening. But, there were still at least, an hour before the sky turns dark.Zhao Lan asked Bai Zhi to take the quilt in the Hu Family main house and brought them to the cabin in the backyard. Although the cabin was small, it was enough for two people. There was no bed inside, but it was filed with sundries. After spreading some hay, it can be temporarily used as a bed.Bai Zhi looked at Zhao Lan\u2019s dirty clothes. Her clothes have some blood and mud. So, she stood up and close the door: \u201cNiang, you change your clothes into a clean one. It\u2019s still early, so I\u2019ll wash it for you.\u201dZhao Lan hesitated: \u201cI\u2019m afraid this hand cannot move, so how can I change my clothes?\u201dBut, how could this kind of simple work be difficult to Bai Zhi? So, she volunteered: \u201cI\u2019ll help you. I can guarantee that it won\u2019t hurt.\u201dShe is a doctor. Naturally, she knows what to do. She helps Zhao Lan to change her dirty clothes. The blood on her mother clothes must be cleaned as soon as possible. The longer the blood stay, the harder it gets to remove.\u00a0Not to mention, in this era where detergent soap doesn\u2019t exist.She also changed her dress into a clean one. And put the dirty clothes into a tub. Then, she went to the riverside, where the previous Bai Zhi remembered.When she came to the riverside of the village, there were many people gathering. The villagers were talking to one after another. However, they didn\u2019t know what exactly to say.But suddenly, a voice that can almost scratch the sky sounded: \u201cFound her, found her, Yingzi was found.\u201dBai Zhi\u00a0squeezed herself into the crowd and saw Hu Feng was carrying a young girl of the same age as her in the shore. The two of them were soaking wet. The young girl\u2019s pale arms were hanging down, and she seemed to be unconscious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The woman quivered as she checked if the young girl was breathing. After she found out that there was no breath, she burst into tears.The natural instinct of a doctor drove Bai Zhi to drop the tub in her hands and rushed forward to the young girl.The young girl temporary lose her breath due to drowning. She must receive\u00a0an immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Otherwise, she will surely die.Bai Zhi busily said to the woman who was crying in pain: \u201cGet out of the way, I\u2019ll save her.\u201dThe woman stopped\u00a0crying and looked at Bai Zhi, then said: \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dBai Zhi was in a hurry, so her tone was full of impatience: \u201cIf you won\u2019t let her go, she will not be saved. Your daughter will surely die.\u201dThe woman looked at Bai Zhi and thought:\u00a0What did she say? Yingzi was already dead, but she said she could save her?Bai Zhi was eager to save the young girl, but she couldn\u2019t control the people. So, she tried to push the woman away. Then, she crouched to the side, pressed her hands hard on the young girl\u2019s chest and spread her lips to put some air.These actions surprised everyone present in the vicinity. Especially, Yingzi\u2019s father who just arrived.As soon as he had seen what happened, Yingzi\u2019s father raised his fist to hit Bai Zhi\u2019s face. It\u2019s just, a strong hand suddenly caught his arm.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dHu Feng looked at the old man faintly, then his eyes swept towards Bai Zhi\u2019s hands that keep pressing the young girl\u2019s chest. And said: \u201cShe is saving your daughter.\u201dYingzi\u2019s father shouted angrily: \u201cWhat kind of rescuing is this ah? She\u2019s clearly\u2026 \u2026\u201dYingzi\u2019s father hasn\u2019t finished his words when his dead daughter suddenly spit out a mouthful of water and violently cough\u2026 \u2026The young girl clearly had no breath, but she was alive now.So not only Yingzi\u2019s father and Yingzi\u2019s mother were astonished, but also the villagers.It turned out that Bai Zhi was really saving the young girl, and not insulting her\u2026 \u2026Hu Feng\u2019s original deep black eyes, suddenly flashed with a strange light. As if his endless dark journey, suddenly brightly lit.He walked out from the crowd and deeply looked at Bai Zhi.\u201cIs she really alive? This young girl is really capable ah. She can bring back the dead to life.\u201d\u201cThis is scary. This young girl also died this morning. But, she was inexplicably brought back to life. Is this just a coincidence?\u201d\u201cOh! No, no, don\u2019t say it like that. I\u2019m having goosebumps all over my body. Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s leave. It\u2019s too scary here.\u201dAfter\u00a0Yingzi\u2019s father and Yingzi\u2019s mother\u00a0heard those arguments, they were also very surprised. They didn\u2019t even thank Bai Zhi. They just hurriedly left with their soaking wet daughter. And soon, the villagers have scattered away.Bai Zhi couldn\u2019t help but laugh at herself. She just saved a life, but it seems she only cause trouble for herself. This world was really ridiculous.Bai Zhi picked up her tub and washed their dirty clothes to the riverside. The noisy river earlier has quiet down. There was no other noise aside from her washing clothes.*On the Bai Family\u2019s house, Old Lady Bai knew that the mother and daughter went to the Hu Family. After all, it was the village chief\u2019s intention from the very beginning. She was not planning to stop them anyway.Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi were both injured. They cannot work on these upcoming two days. The Hu Family rather saved them from spending food to those useless people.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Has done a foolish thingAt this time, the Bai Family\u2019s eldest son and second son had come back from the field. And once they learned what happened in the family, the two brothers were both flustered.In dissatisfaction, Bai Dazhu complained to his aging mother and wife: \u201cHow could both of you didn\u2019t think of the weight of this situation? Zhao Lan ended up like this, so who will work in the field tomorrow, huh?\u201d Then, he look at Mrs. Liu: \u201cIs it you?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu hurriedly waved her hands: \u201cI can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know anything about the field. I\u2019ve never worked in there.\u201dBai Dazhu then swept his eyes towards Mrs. Zhang. Mrs. Zhang looked up and stared back at Bai Dazhu. Then, calmly said: \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the field just like sister-in-law.\u201dMrs. Zhang\u2019s cold eyes looked at the Bai Family and sneered. She had lived in this house for more than 10 years. So, how could she not know, what just these two brothers doing most of the time in the field? They go to the field, but only to walk around. Or, they will just choose some random area to clean, which was a very easy job. Then, they will wait for Zhao Lan to finished everything.Zhao Lan was responsible for the 5 acres of paddy fields. While the two brothers were only responsible for the half acres of the peanut field.Mrs. Zhang swept her eyes towards Bai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu. Seeing their clothes were clean, she knew they didn\u2019t work in the field and just went to the mountain and do sightseeing.Bai Erzhu sighed and said: \u201cNiang, you really had done such a foolish thing this time.\u201dOld Lady Bai\u2019s eyes rolled: \u201cFoolish thing? That dead girl had eaten our Bai Family\u2019s food for 12 years, but I don\u2019t have the qualifications to teach her a lesson? You didn\u2019t see it, but that dead girl took a wooden club and beat me and your sister-in-law. So, do you think we deserve that?\u201dBai Erzhu sighed again and said: \u201cNiang, I don\u2019t mean it like that. Now, Zhao Lan can\u2019t move. So, who will go and work in the field?\u201d\u201cWho will work? Are you two big men only for decorations? Of course, you two will do the work. Other family wants to have many fields like us, but you two were so unwilling?\u201dMrs. Zhang, the second daughter-in-law, intervened and said: \u201cNiang, let\u2019s stop talking about the field. Who will cook for dinner tonight?\u201dOld Lady Bai looked back at Mrs. Zhang and coldly said: \u201cWho do you think, huh? Do you want this old woman do it for you?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Zhang laughed twice, then said: \u201cNiang, I don\u2019t mean it like that. I\u2019ve been peeling the peanuts the whole day. My hands were about to fall off. I can\u2019t do it this time, why don\u2019t you let sister-in-law cook?\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu heard this, she immediately intervened with this idea: \u201cWhat did you say? You peeled peanuts the whole day? How many pieces did you peeled, huh? And can peeling peanuts waste your fingers? Do you think you are a daughter from a rich family in the town?\u201dMrs. Zhang and Mrs. Liu usually don\u2019t deal with each other. But, after hearing Mrs. Liu criticism, Mrs. Zhang\u2019s anger burst: \u201cI didn\u2019t work the whole day? What about you, huh? What did you do today? Did you cook meals for lunch or wash the clothes? Did you sweep the yard? Did you pull the grass out in the courtyard?\u201dMrs. Liu tried to rack her brain, but she couldn\u2019t remember what she had done today. It seemed she had only spent the whole day thinking with the old lady about how they will sell Bai Zhi for 12 silvers. However, at lunch, it seems Bai Zhi had heard their conversation. She refused and had a fight with them. As a result, she and the old lady beaten her to death.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Have nothing to do with the crimeFortunately, she came back to life again. Otherwise, with that noisy Hu Changlin, she will definitely go to prison with the old lady.\u201cWith your tone, it feels like you\u2019ve done all this work before.\u201d Mrs. Liu ironically said.Mrs. Zhang said: \u201cAlthough I have nothing to do with the crime. But if it was me, I will not hurt those people who survived and lose money again.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Zhang coldly looked at Mrs. Liu and then turned around to go to their room. She will not cook today\u2019s dinner.Once everything was opened up, the Bai Family naturally realized that this was something they should do. Especially, if they don\u2019t want to suffer again like this in the future.As soon as the silvers become the topic, Old Lady Bai felt uncomfortable: \u201cIn these two days, the family should work altogether. No one is allowed to be lazy. Today, you, the first daughter-in-law, should cook. Second daughter-in-law will do the household work tomorrow. In this case, no one will suffer alone.\u201dMrs. Liu immediately yelled in dissatisfaction. Bai Dazhu knew his wife was dissatisfied, but he said: \u201cNiang said you will cook tonight. So, what are you still dilly-dallying around? If you won\u2019t hurry, everyone will get hungry!\u201dMrs. Liu saw her husband winking his eyes at her while speaking. So, although she couldn\u2019t understand what he means, she calmed down her anger and replied with: \u201cOk, I\u2019ll do it. But, someone has to give me a hand. How can one person cook foods for so many people?\u201dOld Lady Bai was irritated: \u201cHow could one person do it alone? Didn\u2019t that dead girl always cook alone? How can a little girl do it, but an old woman like you cannot?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu\u2019s didn\u2019t dare to give a reply, she only took a step forward to the kitchen. Then, Bai Dazhu said with a smile: \u201cI\u2019ll give you a hand.\u201dBai Dazhu went to the kitchen with Mrs. Liu. So, Old Lady Bai\u2019s eyes fell on Bai Erzhu\u2019s body: \u201cDid you finished the work in the field?\u201dBai Erzhu scratched his head, then said: \u201cNo, we only finished a bit. I\u2019ll go again tomorrow.\u201dOld Lady Bai frowned: \u201cIf I remember correctly, our peanut field was only\u00a0a half acre of land. What are you doing? Two people cannot even finish it the whole day?\u201dBai Erzhu dryly laughed and said: \u201cToday is very hot, we\u2019re scared to get a fever and waste the family\u2019s money. So, we rested for a while and delayed it some time.\u201dOld Lady Bai\u2019s eyes rolled and said: \u201cOh, you know that today\u2019s weather is hot? How many villagers do you think that work today doesn\u2019t know that the weather is hot? Oh, I don\u2019t want to talk about your nonsense. In short, stop playing around. In our 5 acres of land, Zhao Lan had already finished planting the seeds in the 2 acres. You do the work in the remaining 3 acres in these two days. Otherwise, the seeds will rot and the harvest will be delayed.\u201dBai Erzhu\u2019s face was full of bitterness. In previous years, he and his older brother never work, but they never experience drought. Zhao Lan was working alone, but she works neatly, so their harvest was not bad.But now, all these activities have fallen upon himself. This was not his fault, so why he is suffering?\u201cNiang, now do you know how foolish your actions were? If you didn\u2019t beat Zhao Lan like that, do you need to worry about these things?\u201d The more he thought about his situation, the more he felt\u00a0uncomfortable.Old Lady Bai shouted: \u201cWhat else should we do except to fight?\u201dBai Erzhu shrugged his shoulder and said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about that. All I want you to know is that I\u2019m not familiar with the fields. You let older brother go and do the work. I\u2019ll go to the town and make some money.\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai heard his words, she immediately asks: \u201cWhat are you going to do in the town? Can you get some food in there?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: Hiding food to eatBai Erzhu busily said: \u201cNiang, I\u2019m not really sure, but if I go this time to the town, maybe I can really get food.\u201dSeeing him with a serious look, and seems not lying. Old Lady Bai ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Let\u2019s talk about it.\u201dBai Erzhu leaned towards his aging mother\u2019s ear and whispered in a very low voice: \u201cNiang, when I was working in the field and cleaning up the grass, I heard from the two people that went to the town and buy some foods that, the Xu Family bun\u2019s shop prepared 100 pieces of steamed buns for the 5 participants in the competition. These 5 contestants will be asked to eat these steamed buns. The contestant who will eat the most will be given 1 bag of flour.\u201d\u201cNiang, 1 bag of flour, 1 bag of flour, how long do you think it will help our family?\u201d Bai Erzhu\u2019s smile reached up to his ears. As if this bag of flour had already been delivered to their house.Old Lady Bai was amazed and ask: \u201cIs there really such a good competition in this world? They will ask you to eat steamed buns? And after you eat, they will also give 1 bag of flour? Does the owner of the steamed bun shop has a muddled brain?\u201dBai Erzhu said: \u201cThe owner doesn\u2019t have a muddled brain. Of course, there is also condition to participate. It\u2019s not just any person could participate in the competition. The participant will be asked to pay the money first.\u201dOld Lady Bai ask: \u201cHow much is it?\u201dBai Erzhu showed his palm: \u201cNot much, only 50 copper coins.\u201dOld Lady Bai calculated and then asked: \u201c50 copper coins are enough to buy 10 steamed buns. Will they returned the money after you win?\u201dBai Erzhu laughed: \u201cOf course, as long as you win the game, they will not only returned the 50 copper coins but also will give you a bag of flour. It\u2019s really a good deal!\u201dIndeed, it was a good deal. So, Old Lady Bai immediately nodded her head: \u201cWell then, you go to the town tomorrow and be sure to get back, okay? Our family hasn\u2019t tasted a steamed bun for a long time now.\u201dBai Erzhu smiled, and busily stretched out his hand: \u201cGive me the money.\u201dOld Lady Bai went to her room to get the money. Bai\u00a0Erzhu quickly followed in. When he saw his aging mother getting the copper coins from the wooden box, he smiled and said: \u201cNiang, give me sixty copper coins in total. I\u2019ll bring some spare money to ensure no problem will arise.\u201dAfter thinking the 1 bag of flour, Old Lady Bai thinks that there was nothing wrong with bringing some spare money. So, she gave Bai Erzhu a total of 60 copper coins.*In the kitchen, after Mrs. Liu took out two jars of rice, she squeezed herself to her husband and ask: \u201cWhy are you winking at me earlier?\u201dBai Dazhu looked behind him. When he saw no one followed, he whispered: \u201cAfter you cook the porridge, we will hide a thick bowl of porridge, so we will not get hungry at night.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu\u2019s eyes flashed with worries: \u201cIf your niang learned about this, she will get angry.\u201dAfter eating a small bowl of porridge and a few vegetables with no oil. Who will not get hungry at night? So, if they can really hide some food to eat in the evening, that would be great.Bai Dazhu smiled and said with a low voice: \u201cStupid wife, tonight you will cook the meal. If you add a bit more rice and hide the food early before everyone eats, who will know?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu gradually smiled: \u201cI see. Okay, I will listen to you.\u201d The unpleasant mood she felt earlier gradually dissipated.However, seeing\u00a0Bai Dazhu turning to go, she busily said: \u201cHey! Didn\u2019t you said that you will help me? Where are you going?\u201dBai Dazhu\u00a0did not return inside the kitchen, he only said: \u201cJust a simple task, yet you still want me to help? I am busy the whole day, I\u2019ll go and sleep. After the sun went down, the mosquitoes are flying everywhere. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep by then. Remember to wake me up, when you finished cooking dinner.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Rice SoupWhat else can she say? She can only quietly do her job. Mrs. Liu hadn\u2019t cooked in the kitchen for two years now. Fortunately, she only had to cook a pot of porridge and stir a large pot of vegetables.Bai Erzhu put the 60 copper coins in his purse and was about to go to their room. However, as soon as he walked out from his aging mother\u2019s room, he saw Doctor Lu carrying his medicine box and a few packets of medicine into their yard.Bai Erzhu hurriedly welcomed Doctor Lu: \u201cOh, isn\u2019t this Lu dafu? What brings you here?\u201dDoctor Lu was feeling lazy to talk to Bai Erzhu. So, he simply said: \u201cI came to treat Zhao Lan. Your not here earlier, so you might not know. But, your mother knew this.\u201dBai Erzhuo replied: \u201cThey are not here, their house collapsed, so they went to Hu Changlin\u2019s house.\u201dDoctor Lu look towards the broken house, and indeed, it collapsed. Doctor Lu sighed and said: \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go to Old Hu\u2019s house and give her the medicines.\u201dWhen Bai Erzhu heard this, he hurriedly stopped Doctor Lu: \u201cGive her the medicines? Isn\u2019t she alright now? Her broken hand is not worthy to be spent with medicines. We don\u2019t have so much money to waste with her. Just take back your medicines.\u201dDoctor Lu said: \u201cThese medicines have already been paid. And it was for Bai Zhi. Have you seen her condition? If I will not give her this medicine, she\u2019ll get sick the whole night. If anything bad happened, then don\u2019t blame me ah.\u201dBai Erzhu remembered the year when his father and third brother fell from the roof. At that time, they vomited blood, but they were still conscious.Doctor Lu also gave them prescriptions, but he asked them to go to the town to get the medicines. They felt that the medicines in the town will be expensive, so they didn\u2019t go. After dragging the treatment for a few more days, they both died.Although Bai Erzhu felt distressed this time by spending money to a doctor. He only swallowed his words. After all, if Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi reported this case. His mother and sister-in-law will definitely go to the prison. Can their family survive if that happens?Bai Erzhu closed his mouth and said nothing, then he turned and entered their house.Doctor\u00a0Lu shook his head and took his medicine box to go to Hu Changlin\u2019s house.*At last, the Bai Family was now having their dinner. Old Lady Bai stared at her bowl of porridge and frown her eyebrows:\u00a0Is this a porridge? This is clearly a rice soup.The old lady then swept her eyes towards Mrs. Liu. In the past, this daughter-in-law always tried to give her a thick porridge. But now, in this dining table, she didn\u2019t treat her like an elder.Mrs. Liu didn\u2019t dare to respond to the old woman\u2019s dissatisfied eyes. She only acted natural, as if she didn\u2019t notice anything.When Mrs. Zhang took a bowl of porridge back from the kitchen and came to the dining hall. She slammed the bowl and said: \u201cSister-in-law, is this a porridge or a rice soup?\u201dMrs. Liu smiled, then replied: \u201cOf course, it\u2019s a porridge, it\u2019s only a little thin.\u201dMrs. Zhang\u2019s said in dissatisfaction: \u201cA little thin? Can you please help me look for the rice in this porridge?\u201dMrs. Liu busily replied: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t blame me in this. You and I both eat the same meal. We don\u2019t have much rice in the jar. Of course, I can add more rice to this. But, if I did that, we won\u2019t have a meal on the following days. Not to mention, even rice soup will not do.\u201dFor this reason, Old Lady Bai\u2019s eyes become soft and so she waved her hand, then said: \u201d Stop it and let\u2019s just eat. We still have work to do tomorrow.\u201d Then, the old lady turned her head to her second daughter-in-law: \u201cAfter this dinner, we will divide the food per head to avoid this situation.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: OrphanThe two daughters-in-law no longer dared to argue. Although their heart was still full of contempt, the old lady\u2019s plan this time was really wonderful. As a member of the Bai Family, if the food will really be divided per head, then the lucky person will naturally be her, the first daughter-in-law.When Doctor Lu found the wooden cabin, where Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi lived. He saw the mother and daughter snuggling on the haystack. He couldn\u2019t help but deeply sighed in this scene, then said to Bai Zhi: \u201cOh, you mother and child\u2019s life are really poor. Of all the family, why you must fall into that Bai family?\u201dBai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cThis will never happen again in the future. I will protect my mother. Nobody can bully her again.\u201dDoctor Lu looked at the little girl in front of him, who was faintly smiling. But, her squinted eyes were radiating with light.He didn\u2019t looked at her carefully before, that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t know that she had such good looking eyes. Eyes that revealed great wisdom and spirit. So, this time, he couldn\u2019t help but trust her words.\u201cGood, you have to keep these words. Oh, with these things, your niang\u2019s wounds will definitely heal much faster.\u201d Doctor Lu was happy, and so, he handed the pack of medicines to Bai Zhi\u2019s hands. Then said: \u201cZhi\u2019er, earlier, I deliberately said that your niang was heavily wounded to frighten those people. But, you don\u2019t really have to worry about her. Your niang don\u2019t have any internal injuries. Aside from her fractured hand, the rest was only skin injuries. She will get better soon.\u201d\u201cThen, these medicines are?\u201d Bai Zhi naturally knew that her mother only has some skin injuries. So, she was very curious what the medicines are for. Skin injuries don\u2019t need oral medicines. She only needs to apply some ointment.Doctor Lu laughed and said: \u201cI brought these medicines for you to nourished back your health. You and your niang can drink this if you want. The Bai Family treat you bad, that\u2019s why you are so thin like this. You must take care of your body. Otherwise, it will be very difficult for you to find a husband in the future.\u201dWhen Zhao Lan heard these words, her tears fell down: \u201cWhy won\u2019t she be like this? Other young girls in the village eat an egg every day. But, my daughter doesn\u2019t even know the taste of an egg. This can only be blamed on me. I am so useless.\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu hurriedly persuade Zhao Lan to stop crying: \u201cHow can you say that? In Huangtuo Village, who doesn\u2019t know that you work so hard for Zhi\u2019er? If it weren\u2019t for your daughter, why would you stay with those evil people?\u201d When Zhao Lan\u2019s husband passed away, she was still young. It was still very easy for her to remarry. However, in order to stay with her daughter, she chooses to work like a horse in the Bai Family.Although Bai Zhi was only picked up by her and her husband, her last name was Bai. So, if Zhao Lan remarries, she wouldn\u2019t be able to take her daughter with her. Moreover, Old Lady Bai was so eager to sell her daughter to have some money.Bai Zhi remembered her previous life. Their living condition was not as worst as this. But, no one wanted her. At the age of 4, she was left alone in the street. She didn\u2019t know that her parents don\u2019t want her at that time. So, she sat on the side of the road and waited for them, until a police officer took her and brought her to the police station. The police officer asked her parents name and contact information. She remembered her mother\u2019s contact number, but when the police called her mother. She heard her mother said she didn\u2019t know her and she had no children at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: SelaginellaThe police officer then looked for her father. At that time, her father brought a stranger aunt with him, then said in front of her face that he didn\u2019t know her and he had no children at all.That year, she was only 4 years old.Ever since then, she had lived in the orphanage. She also never spoke that she has parents.However,\u00a0Zhao Lan, although she was not really her daughter. She uses all her energy to love and protect her. This was not only a mother\u2019s unconditional love but also a selfless affection.This love was the only thing that she ever wanted, but she couldn\u2019t get.In the past, she always thought that God was unfair. Everyone was loved by their parents, only her was not.However, today, she thinks God was truly fair. The love she didn\u2019t get in the 23rd century, was instantly given to her in this era.So, she will cherish this hard-earned affection and protect this kind mother.*Doctor Lu\u00a0applied some medicine to the bruises on Bai Zhi\u2019s face, then left his homemade ointment in her care: \u201cAfter this, you put this medicine on your wounds. Remember, you shouldn\u2019t let your wounds get wet. Otherwise, your wounds will not heal fast. And it may have some pus. It will become troublesome by then.\u201dBai Zhi took the ointment and smelled it, then she smiled and said: \u201cLu dafu, did you made this ointment?\u201dDoctor Lu nodded his head: \u201cYes, this prescription was handed down by our ancestors. The effect of this medicine is very good, you try it out.\u201dBai Zhi nodded her head and said: \u201cThis ointment is really good, but if you will add 3 grams of\u00a0Selaginella in it. I think the effect will be even better. You can try that out next time.\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu\u2019s face changed slightly. But, his brain was making calculations. That herb was not a stranger to him. It can be used to treat traumatic injuries. Especially, if the wound was full of pus. The wound heals faster once it was applied. Why didn\u2019t he think of it before?\u201cThis prescription was passed down in our family. If I made some changes, will it be okay?\u201d Doctor Lu was a bit hesitant.Bai Zhi smiled, then said: \u201cThe prescription was a man-made creation. People create laws, not only to let the people live in peace but also to let the future generations find flaws in it and create a more suitable one. The same with education, it helps the future generation to take less detour of struggles in life, instead of following the ordinary blacken road.\u201d\u201cOr perhaps, when your ancestors were formulating this prescription, they still don\u2019t know the effect of Selaginella, so they didn\u2019t include it on the list. But now that you know its great effect, don\u2019t you still want to take advantage of its use?\u201dDoctor Lu\u2019s hesitation instantly dissipated: \u201cRules are made to be broken, the old prescription was written to be surpassed, I understand, I understand.\u201d Doctor Lu looked very excited. He only had a brief conversation with this little girl, but he felt like, he had gained more than ten years of knowledge in medicine.\u201cZhi\u2019er, I really didn\u2019t expect that you know the effect of Selaginella. Although this herb is originally not so expensive, it was really rare to be found. Only a few people had seen it. Even I only had seen it once by chance. But, the effect of this herb is really good.\u201dBai Zhi\u00a0smiled and said, \u201cI happened to know it by accident. Lu dafu, if I can find this selaginella, can you help me sell them to get some money?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Finding the wayDoctor\u00a0Lu immediately nodded his head: \u201cOf course, this herb\u2019s effect is not the same as the other traumatic medicine, it\u2019s effect is very good. So, if you can really find selaginella, we can definitely sell it at a good price. I can help you sell it, but you look like this right now\u2026 \u2026\u201dBai Zhi waved her hand: \u201cI\u2019m fine, it\u2019s only a few skin injuries. Children lived at the foot of the mountain doesn\u2019t live like a precious gem. We will leave the Bai Family soon, so niang and I can only look at each other.\u201dDoctor Lu\u2019s eyes were full of admiration. This child was so young but very sensible. If his daughter was half as sensible as her, he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about anything.The\u00a0sky was getting darker, so Doctor Lu didn\u2019t stay much longer. He hurried back home before the sky completely turn black. He also left in a hurry as to not let the other people made a gossip.Seeing Bai Zhi closed the door, Zhao Lan took Bai Zhi\u2019s hand and let her sit, then asked: \u201cZhi\u2019er, what adding selaginella thing are you talking about? Your not talking nonsense, right? This ointment can save people\u2019s lives, you shouldn\u2019t blindly play with it.\u201dBai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cNiang, do you think I\u2019m only talking nonsense? Didn\u2019t you hear Lu dafu\u2019s words? He also knew the effect of Selaginella.\u201dZhao Lan was even more puzzled: \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d Her daughter seemed to have changed and became more talkative than ever. And everything she said was so strange. She had never heard of them before.\u201cWhen I dig some wild vegetables before, I heard some people talking about it. I didn\u2019t know that it was really good. Niang, let\u2019s just sleep, okay? We\u2019re all tired today.\u201dWhen Zhao Lan was coaxed to go to bed, she had quickly forgotten the issue. Her daughter has changed, but it was a good change. So, she was very happy.*The next day morning, when Yingzi\u2019s mother and Yingzi came to the Bai Family\u2019s House, they saw the old lady was feeding the chicken in the yard, and so Yingzi\u2019s mother asked: \u201cIs Zhao Lan at home?\u201dOld Lady Bai straightened her back and looked at Yingzi\u2019s mother in curiosity:\u00a0This woman actually came to our house and looked for Zhao Lan? This is amazing!Yingzi\u2019s mother\u00a0was a woman from the town. But because she didn\u2019t found a good husband when she was still young, she married a man from the mountain village. When she married the man, she gave a lot of dowries. At that time, the scenery was really beautiful. Who knows how many people felt envious.And because she came from the town, she rarely talked to the women in the village. She always turned a blind eye to them. Especially, to Zhao Lan who was easy to be bullied.So, why did she came looking for Zhao Lan?\u201cDo you have a business with her?\u201d Old Lady Bai asked while moving her eyes to Yingzi, who was standing beside her mother. Yingzi has a small bamboo basket in her arm. The basket was covered with a piece of fabric. So, she couldn\u2019t see the thing inside.Although she couldn\u2019t figure out what was inside, she knew that there must be something good in the basket.Yingzi\u2019s mother has stayed in this village for a long time now. So, how wouldn\u2019t she know what kind of family the Bai was? And what kind of a person was this old lady is? She also knew what was the position of Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi in this family. If she will give this thing they brought to the old lady, it wouldn\u2019t reach Zhao Lan\u2019s hands.Yingzi\u2019s mother said with a smile: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I have something to ask her.\u201d Then, she turned her head over to Zhao Lan\u2019s house. The broken house had collapsed. She thinks it must be because of the heavy rain yesterday. So, she busily asked: \u201cWhat happened to their house? Is Zhao Lan and Zhi\u2019er all right?\u201dOld Lady Bai waved her hand and said: \u201cWhat can happen to them? Those people have strong bones. They didn\u2019t stay here last night. They went and stayed in Hu Changlin\u2019s place. You go in there and you will find her.\u201d Afterward, the old lady added some filthy words.Yingzi\u2019s mother frowned her eyebrows and quickly pulled her daughter. She doesn\u2019t want to let her daughter heard those dirty words of the old lady.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Thank youZhao Lan who woke up early, but seeing Bai Zhi was still asleep. She decided to go out the bed quietly and prepare a water to wash her face. However, when she just stood on the ground, Bai Zhi climbed up and rubbed her eyes: \u201cNiang, you just rest, I\u2019ll go get the water.\u201d\u201cNo need, go back to sleep. I can still use my left hand, and I have the strength to fetch a water. You don\u2019t need to bother.\u201d\u201cOh, niang ah\u2014 just listen to me. This tub is thrice heavier than you think, so how will you carry it with one hand? Just sit down, I\u2019ll go get the water.\u201d Bai Zhi was about to go out with the wooden tub, but somebody knocked on the door outside.After opening the door, she saw Yingzi and her mother came.\u201cAunt, are you looking for me?\u201d Bai Zhi swept her eyes towards Yingzi. Yingzi was holding a bamboo basket. The basket was covered with a piece of cloth. The things inside were hidden.Yingzi\u2019s mother squeezed herself inside the cabin and smiled, then said: \u201cZhi\u2019er, yesterday, you saved my daughter\u2019s life. We haven\u2019t had a chance to thank you. I just went to the Bai Family\u2019s house, but your grandmother said that you two stayed in here. So, I came looking for you.\u201dBai Zhi smiled and waved her hand: \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. We are village folks. Helping one another is normal.\u201dYingzi\u2019s mother smiled and said: \u201cIt may not be a big deal to you, but for us, you are the savior of Yingzi. I will not say any beautiful words. I just want to tell you that, if you need any help, as long as I can do it, don\u2019t hesitate to come and ask me. I will find a way to help you.\u201dBai Zhi also smiled and said: \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll trouble Aunt in the future.\u201dYingzi\u2019s mother saw Bai Zhi was kind and pleasing, so her heart was full of joy. Why didn\u2019t she find this girl charming before?Yingzi\u2019s mother then\u00a0took the bamboo basket in Yingzi\u2019s hands and put it on the board, where Zhao Lan was sitting: \u201cThere are no many good things in the mountains. You both suffered from injuries. The Bai Family don\u2019t give you many foods. I have a few hens in my house, so I picked up some eggs and decided to give it to you two. You should eat these eggs to nourish your health.\u201dThe mountain people were poor. Only when it\u2019s annual festival, they eat special food like meat. So, the villagers who don\u2019t treasure much the eggs only depends on eating it every day to nourish their body.Zhao Lan hurriedly said: \u201cYingzi\u2019s niang, you take these eggs back. How can we take these eggs? We understand your intention.\u201dYingzi\u2019s mother said: \u201cThese are nothing but only a few pieces of eggs. These eggs came from our own hens. We still have some at home. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201dBai Zhi smiled, then said: \u201cIf that is the case, then we won\u2019t be polite. But, we will only borrow it today, in the future, when we get rich, we will return them all to you.\u201dYingzi\u2019s mother happily nodded her head: \u201cOkay, it\u2019s a deal.\u201dAfter exchanging a one or two more sentences, the mother and daughter left.When Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi were the only people left inside. They immediately uncover the cloth on the bamboo basket. They saw at least a dozen eggs. The picture of a poached egg immediately appeared in their mind. Bai Zhi greedily swallowed her saliva. And she couldn\u2019t help but sigh in this.She was very ashamed of herself. She was a famous doctor in the 23rd century. Her annual salary was over a million yuan. So, what delicious food she hasn\u2019t eaten in her life? But now, just because of a few raw eggs, she swallowed her saliva?\u201cNiang, we need to hide these eggs. Yingzi\u2019s niang just said she went to the Bai Family. The Bai Family knew she will bring us something. With their character, they will surely chase after these eggs. We shouldn\u2019t give them any.\u201dZhao Lan looked at the empty small cabin with four walls, then she worriedly asked: \u201cWhere can we hide these eggs in such a small place?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: The Luoying MountainBai Zhi remembered, that when the dead Bai Zhi went to the mountain to pick up some wild vegetables last year. She saw some wild grapes on the road and picked them up. There were not many numbers of it. She was afraid that the Bai Family will take them all. So, she hides them under the broken house and waits for the evening to come, to eat and share them with her mother.But, who knew that, while she was picking the wild grapes. A young boy from the same village saw her. And then rushed to Bai Xiaofeng to tell this news. The Bai Family almost turned upside down the broken house to get the wild grapes when they heard of it. They didn\u2019t stop until she gave them up. For this, Old Lady Bai also punished her for almost half of the day.The mother and daughter were still discussing how they will hide the eggs when Hu Changlin walked inside the cabin with a bowl.\u201cAre the\u00a0two of you busy?\u201d Hu Changlin entered the cabin with a smile. Obviously, he was in a good mood.Bai Zhi immediately thought of a plan, she smiled and said: \u201cHu Bo, just now, Yingzi\u2019s niang came and gave us some eggs. We don\u2019t have a place to put it. Can we put it in your house? We also want to hide them from the Bai Family.\u201dHu Changlin asked in curiosity: \u201cOh, she also gave you some eggs?\u201dBai Zhi nodded her head: \u201cYesterday, Hu Feng carried Yinzhi out of the shore. I also help Yingzi a bit, so her niang also gave us some.\u201dHu Changlin handed the bowl in his hand with a smile, then said: \u201cThese things are also what she sent. I cooked some of them. You two ladies, eat this while it\u2019s hot.\u201dBai Zhi busily took the bowl, she was also planning to eat their eggs with Hu Family. So, there was no need to care for formality.Bai Zhi\u2019s eagle eyesight gradually moved towards the sunlight coming out from the clouds. Then, asked suddenly: \u201cHu Bo, what is the closest mountain here in our Huangtuo Village?\u201dHu Changlin didn\u2019t think much about her question. And just said: \u201cIt\u2019s the Luoying Mountain. That mountain is very vast. There were a lot of giant trees all over the place. I also heard that from the other side of it, was the border of Zhou Country.\u201dWith this discovery, Bai Zhi smiled: \u201cIf that is the case, won\u2019t the Zhou Country can easily invade our Chu Country? They only need to pass through that mountain, right?\u201dHu Changlin waved his hand: \u201cEasy? How come it will be easy? Luoying Mountain is a very dangerous place. There were so many fierce beasts in there. No matter how many people went into the deepest part of it, no one came back alive. It is a legendary mountain of death. Even large army don\u2019t dare to enter it.\u201dBai Zhi frown her eyebrows: \u201cSo basically, no one dared to go in there?\u201dHu Changlin shook his head: \u201cNo one dared to go to the deepest part of the mountain. But some people still dared to go to the outer part. Some of those people are hunters that want to hunt for preys. Some people go to find some medicinal herbs. After all, there were lots of good herbs in the mountain. Many doctors came in there before. But, because it was really dangerous, only a few doctors now came to collect some herbs.\u201dZhao Lan saw Bai Zhi with a deep thought, so she asked: \u201cWhy are you asking these questions?\u201d \u201dBai Zhi replied with a smile: \u201cOh, I am going to pick up some wild vegetables and herbs that I could recognize. Lu Dafu said yesterday that he will help me to sell them in the pharmacy in the town.\u201dHu Changlin swept his eyes to Bai Zhi\u2019s thin body, then busily said: \u201cIs that so? Hu Feng also said yesterday that he will go hunt in the mountain. He intended to help me plant the peanuts first this morning. I can finish it alone. So, you go and ask Hu Feng to take you to the mountain. We can be more at ease by doing this.\u201dBai Zhi\u2019s heart felt warm. Hu Changlin was a very good person. He always thinks about their safety. Without asking for anything in return.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Little Wife\u201cHow can that be? How can you plant peanuts alone? If you insist, I will also go to the field and help you plant peanuts. Although I can\u2019t move my right hand, I can do some work with my left hand. I can help you somehow.\u201d Zhao Lan busily said.Hu Changlin refused, but couldn\u2019t stop Zhao Lan. In the end, he could only nod his head and agreed.The people in the village work in the field to live. They work all day long. If the family was living in a good condition, they will bring some dry foods with them. Once they felt hungry, they will eat some of it. But, if the family was really in a poor condition. They will let themselves hungry for a day, they will only eat at night. Most villagers only eat two meals a day.\u201cNiang, Hu\u00a0bo, me and Hu Feng will bring you foods at noon.\u201d When Bai Zhi thought that her mother and Hu Changlin will work all day long, she doesn\u2019t want them to feel hungry.Zhao Lan immediately waved her hand: \u201cNo need, I don\u2019t feel hungry when I work. You don\u2019t need to bring me a meal.\u201d Right now, they don\u2019t have anything aside from those dozens of eggs. She wanted her daughter to regain some of her health, so she wanted her to eat them alone.Hu Changlin wanted to agree with Bai Zhi if she was really willing to do so. But, when he remembered the empty rice jar at home. And remember that all the crops in the field have just been planted. Hu Changlin could only close his mouth.Bai Zhi had some thought in mind, but in the end, she didn\u2019t say anything. She just watched her mother and Hu Changlin left the house. Then, she took a bamboo bag and left with Hu Feng.Along the way, Hu Feng walked in front of her without saying a word. He never even turned back his head. As if he was going up to the mountain alone.Hu Feng\u2019s footsteps were fast. A small cockroach-like her was really having trouble to catch up. Her two legs were small and had some injuries, so each step she took was painful.\u201cHey, Hu Feng, can\u2019t you wait for me?\u201d Bai Zhi was very tired, so she simply sat down on the ground. She gasped for breath and refused to get up: \u201cI can\u2019t walk, you go on your own first.\u201dHu Feng finally stopped and looked back at her. His handsome eyebrows were tightly knitting together: \u201cYou don\u2019t have enough physical strength, but you insist on going up to the mountain? Just go back home and forget it.\u201dThis was obviously a challenge and it\u2019s quite useful!She lived for 23 years in her previous life. She became an orphan at an early age. She didn\u2019t get the love she wanted from her parents. She lived a bitter life. But, did she give up? No, she fought by honing her skills in the field of medicine. And with this, she changed her life and destiny.Now in this strange world, although her body has changed, she was still Bai Zhi. She will never give up. She must do everything she can to change not only her fate but also the fate of the people she cherished.Bai Zhi stubbornly climbed up and looked at Hu Feng\u2019s eyes, then lifted an eyebrow.She gritted her teeth while swallowing the pain she felt and keep up with his footsteps.Hu Feng also seemed intentionally slowed down his footsteps, so that she won\u2019t struggled like before.On the side road, there were some villagers working in the fields. One of the big guys jokingly said: \u201cHey, Hu Feng brought a little girl with him. From afar, it looks like he brought his little wife with him.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I must say, Hu Changlin is really clever ah. Bringing Zhao Lan and Zhi\u2019er to his house to live in is clearly a good deal. Zhao Lan is an expert worker in the field, while Zhi\u2019er, although she was still young, her beauty is like a water goddess. After two more years, she\u2019ll definitely be as beautiful as a flower jade. How many silver dowry Hu Changlin had save in this marriage ah?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that Old Lady Bai doesn\u2019t know the depth of her madness. If Zhao Lan and Zhi\u2019er stayed in Hu Changlin\u2019s house for good. Their Bai Family\u2019s fields were only waiting to be drowned by the grass.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Because you know medicineThe laziness of the Bai Family was well known throughout the whole village. Nothing can compete with them in this matter.And not only that, because they were also known for being an ambitious and self-righteous fart. If it weren\u2019t for Zhao Lan, their family has long been dead.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand the situation. Old Lady Bai was also clever. No one can compare with her calculation. Zhao Lan and Zhi\u2019er were now injured. They can\u2019t work. So, in order to lessen the consumption of their food, they let the mother and daughter lived in Hu Changlin\u2019s house. Just wait and see ah, once the mother and daughter were healed, the old lady will not let them go the Hu Family.\u201d\u201cOh, that is also possible, with the character of those people in the Bai Family, this kind of things can really be done.\u201dThe two people continued to walk their way. As if they didn\u2019t hear all those arguments.After a long while, Hu Feng saw that Bai Zhi was getting physically weak, so he pointed his finger at the big tree, then said: \u201cRest.\u201dBai Zhi quickly sat her butt and grasp for breath.Hu Feng then stepped forward and pointed his finger to the bamboo bag on her back: \u201cWhat are you planning to do with that in Luoying Mountain?\u201dBai Zhi looked up at him, under the radiance of the sun, Hu Feng stood tall and straight in front of her. She can\u2019t see any emotion in his face. She can only see that his pair of eyes looked pure and introverted.Bai Zhi\u00a0raised an eyebrow: \u201cHu\u00a0Bo, didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d\u201cHe said you were going to pick wild vegetables.\u201dBai Zhi nodded her head: \u201cYes, I am going to pick wild vegetables.\u201dHu Feng shook his head: \u201cYour lying, speak.\u201dBai Zhi was a little annoyed, but she didn\u2019t dare to offend him. She only scratched her scalp and said: \u201cI wanted to go hunt, let\u2019s try to catch two pheasants or hares. Our family has nothing to eat.\u201dHu Feng shook his head again: \u201cLies, speak.\u201dEven if Bai Zhi\u2019s temper was good, she shouldn\u2019t try to hold it at this moment: \u201cHey! What is wrong with you? Everything I said was lies? Then, what do you want me to say?\u201dWhen Hu Feng saw Bai Zhi\u2019s expression, he finds it a bit funny. Her rigid face has some hint of relaxed expression. And in her eyes, he didn\u2019t see any change. He could see that she was acting sly each time she will give a reason.Hu Feng\u00a0shrugged his shoulders and said: \u201cTell me the truth.\u201dBai Zhi opened her mouth and simply said: \u201cI am going to the mountain to pick up some herbs. My Family is very poor. I wanted to sell them to get some money. So, do you believe that?\u201dBai Zhi\u00a0thought Hu Feng will shake his head like before.But who would have thought, that he will actually nod his head: \u201cWell, I believe you.\u201d\u201cWhat? You believe that?\u201d Bai Zhi\u2019s eyes rolled: \u201cYou don\u2019t think they were lies? I am this small, but you believed that I can recognize herbal medicine?\u201dHu Feng looked at her from head to toe, then nodded: \u201cIndeed, you are small.\u201d He paused a bit, then added: \u201cBut, I still believed in you.\u201dBai Zhi thought she was hallucinating: \u201cWhy?\u201dIn Hu Feng\u2019s eyes, the scene in the riverside from yesterday played again. That little girl has died from drowning but survived with her emergency treatment.\u201cBecause you know medicine, it\u2019s not unusual for you to know herbs.\u201d Hu Feng looked into her eyes while speaking.Hu Feng\u00a0stared at her for a long time. So, she had a chance to see his face. Indeed, his handsomeness was not a joke, especially if he was serious. Then suddenly, she remembered the scene yesterday:\u00a0Right, the man who saved Yingzi was him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His gaze seemed to be able to penetrate a hole in her body.\u201cI can take you to the Luoying Mountain and protect you while you are in there, but I have one condition.\u201dBai Zhi wanted to curse her sister, this guy did not only force her to say her plan but also ask for a\u00a0condition? Is there no conscience in this world?Seeing Bai Zhi didn\u2019t speak, Hu Feng directly said: \u201cI am sick.\u201dBai Zhi naturally knows that he was ill: \u201cIf you are sick, go and find a doctor!\u201dHu Feng didn\u2019t look too far, but his eyesight seemed looking from a far distance: \u201cThose quacks\u2026 \u2026 They can\u2019t cure me, let alone\u2026 \u2026 I have no money!\u201dSo, the point is, are those doctors really a quack, or because you have no money?\u201cWhat makes you think I can cure you?\u201d Bai Zhi asked.Hu Feng\u2019s eyes sight were still from a far distance, \u201cJust trying!\u201dBai Zhi\u2019s tongue almost twisted. So, to make it clear, he had no money, that\u2019s why he wanted to try her skill. He won\u2019t lose anything with this\u2026 \u2026Hu Feng asked: \u201cThey call you Zhi\u2019er?\u201dBai Zhi nodded her head: \u201cMy name is Bai Zhi. People who are familiar with me call me Zhier. Unfamiliar people call me Bai Zhi. You and I are not familiar with each other.\u201d\u201cZhi\u2019er, if you want to go the Luoying Mountain you have to hurry. After another hour, the sun\u2019s heat will be higher.\u201d\u201cZhi\u2019er, what are you doing? Don\u2019t you want to go?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d*After Yingzi\u2019s mother left the Bai Family, Bai Erzhu suddenly rushed outside the house and screamed out to the room: \u201cIt\u2019s already late this hour, but no one cooks yet? I don\u2019t know what all the women here are doing.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Zhang also went outside the house and coldly shouted: \u201cAs if you have the ability to work earlier than the others.\u201dBai Erzhu has no time to argue with his wife. He scratched his hair and rushed back to the house. He then asked what else was there to eat.At this time, Old Lady Bai came out from the backyard. \u201cErzhu, why are you asking for foods? Isn\u2019t it better to join the competition with an empty stomach?!\u201dBai Erzhu was stunned. Yes, that\u2019s right, if he went to the competition with an empty stomach, he can eat faster than the others!When Bai Dazhu heard this, he looked very puzzled. \u201cWhat competition? What are you talking about?\u201dBai Erzhu originally intended to hide this from his eldest brother. But now that he heard about it, he had no choice but to say the truth.When Bai Dazhu learned that there was such a good thing, he no longer wanted to go the field to work. Who wanted to miss this kind of opportunity? So, he hurriedly turned around and enter their room to changed his patched clothes. Then, he said when he came out: \u201cI will go with you. Two brothers competing to bring back the bag of flour in our house is much better.\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai heard this, she immediately retorted: \u201cNo, if you go, who is going to finish the work in the field? Isn\u2019t one person enough to get the bag of flour? Why do we need to waste so much money?\u201dBai Dazhu was not happy, and said: \u201cWhy can\u2019t\u00a0 Erzhu finished the work in the field first before he went to play in the town?\u201dBai Erzhu busily said: \u201cPlay in the town? I am risking my life to earn our family a ration of food, but you don\u2019t appreciate it? Play? Who\u2019s person will risk his life to play?\u201d Bai Erzhu was feeling a little indifferent. So, he spoke loudly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: Dead people are possessed by evil spiritsHearing this, Mrs. Liu couldn\u2019t help but said: \u201cIf that is the case, then let your brother go instead of you. You stay here and work in the field. Your older brother is taller than you. His appetite is bigger than yours. If he goes to the competition in your place, the chance he will win is much higher.\u201dBai Erzhu was anxious: \u201cThat can\u2019t be done. This good opportunity was found by me. Why should I let older brother do it instead of me? No, I can\u2019t let him do it. I don\u2019t agree.\u201dThe two brothers rushed in the courtyard and fight. No one wants to give in. In the end, Old Lady Bai was forced to take out another 50 copper coins. And let her two sons went to the town.Zhao Lan was injured, she was not in the house. Bai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu went to the town. They will likely return by the evening. Only old and young women and children were left. No one was willing to work in the field. Old Lady Bai reprimanded her two daughters-in-law but even her grandchildren don\u2019t want to work. So, she only let them rest in the house.The villagers who passed by their courtyard looked stunned and shook their heads: \u201cI have never seen such a lazy family. At this hour, other family members are working early in the fields, but they only sleep at home.\u201dAfter a while, Mrs. Liu came back from the riverside with freshly washed clothes and saw the old lady sitting in the backyard. She busily said with her: \u201cNiang, I just washed the clothes by the river, and guess what I just heard?\u201dOld Lady Bai gave her a look and deeply sighed. Sh doesn\u2019t have a good feeling about her words: \u201cI didn\u2019t go outside, so how will I know? If you want to say, then say it. If you don\u2019t want to, then don\u2019t.\u201dThe old lady released a deep sighed.What happened yesterday was still gripping her heart with sorrow. Mrs. Liu always helps the old woman in the past all the time. But as a result, this old woman only coldly hummed at her when she arrived?But, how could Mrs. Liu not know what\u2019s on the old woman\u2019s mind? So, she busily said: \u201cNiang, I just heard that yesterday evening, that dead girl went to the river to wash the clothes. At that time, Yingzi drowned in the river. Hu Feng took her out on the shore, but she was already out of breath. However, this dead girl, who knows when did she learned black magic, but after she touched and kissed Yingzi. Yingzi came back to life. Niang, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange? The villagers are now talking about it, saying that dead girl was possessed by evil spirits. She clearly died yesterday, but she came back to life. Then, Yingzi also died but came back to life. Niang, do you think she was possessed by evil spirits?\u201dOld Lady Bai doesn\u2019t know if the dead girl was possessed or not. All she could remember was, this morning, Yingzi\u2019s mother came to their courtyard.\u201cThis morning, Yingzi\u2019s niang came in here.\u201d Old Lady Bai said after thinking.Mrs.\u00a0Liu stopped hanging their clothes and looked back at the old lady: \u201cYingzi\u2019s niang came? Is it because of yesterday\u2019s incident? Did she came to settle the account to that dead girl?\u201d When Mrs. Liu was saying those words, there was a trace of excitement in her tone. She would like to see how that little bitch suffers from this account.However, Old Lady Bai shook her head: \u201cNo, Yingzi\u2019s niang brought Yingzi together with her. She looks good. Nothing bad seems happened.\u201dMrs. Liu immediately lost her excitement: \u201cThen, why did she came?\u201dOld Lady Bai said: \u201cShe came with a basket. I didn\u2019t know her intention. But now that I heard your story, she must have come to thank Zhi\u2019er for saving her daughter\u2019s life. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside the basket, but I\u2019m sure, it was something good.\u201dSince it was something good, how can they just let it go?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Private possessionMrs. Liu suddenly thought of the group of young hens in Yingzhi\u2019s family. So, she said: \u201cIt must be eggs. I heard the hens in Yingzi\u2019s family can lay a lot of eggs every day. They must have come to give that dead girl a lot of eggs as thanks.\u201dSpeaking of eggs, Mrs. Liu couldn\u2019t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva. How long has it been since she had eaten an egg? The hen in their family can only lay a very few eggs, so Bai Xiaofeng was the only one who could eat an egg. After all, he was a student, he used his brain all the time, so naturally, he needs more nutrients.\u201cNiang, what are we waiting for? Hurry up and let\u2019s go to Zhao Lan. Let\u2019s take those eggs back home before those two monks eat them.\u201dOld Lady Bai also thinks the same. Their family hasn\u2019t separated yet. So, no matter what they have, the Bai Family have to confiscate it. Zhao Lan has no right and reason to have private possessions.So naturally, she will go ask Zhao Lan to hand over them.Old Lady Bai got up and said: \u201cLet\u2019s go and look for her.\u201dThe mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law hurriedly went outside the yard and went straight to the place where Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi stayed. The cabin was next to the ditch house of Hu Changlin. Almost every household in the village has one or two cabins to pile up some sundries or raise some livestock.The Bai Family was no exception. However, their cabin was not filled by sundries, but the newly cut timber of the old lady. It was impossible to be used as a room for the mother and daughter.*When Mrs. Liu saw the door was closed, she cleared out her throat and said loudly: \u201cIt\u2019s already in the broad daylight, but the door is still closed? She must be doing some dirty things inside.\u201dMrs. Liu\u2019s voice was originally loud, but she still deliberately made it louder.As soon as the villagers heard her words, they immediately stopped from working and looked towards her.Mrs. Liu thought that once the people inside heard her voice, they would immediately open the door.But the result was, no one still opens it. So, she rushed in front of the door and knocked. The wooden door was shaken by her action, so obviously her strength was not small.\u201cZhao Lan, what are you doing inside? Why aren\u2019t you opening the door? Are you hiding a wild man inside?\u201d\u201cYou just left our house yesterday, but you already hooked up with a man? Your courage is not only big, but you are really capable ah! Hurry, open the door! Niang wants to see you right now. Who\u2019s the wild man you are hiding, huh?\u201dThe more Mrs. Liu\u2019s screamed the more she gets excited. If Zhao Lan was really hiding a wild man inside, it will really be a good show. Not only Zhao Lan will lose a face but also that dead girl. With this, their Bai Family can also ask for compensation. With those thoughts in mind, Mrs. Liu\u2019s strength was getting more and more strong. As if once she opens the door, there will silver coins that will come out.\u201cNiang, she doesn\u2019t want to open the door. My hand is already swelling.\u201d When Mrs. Liu finally felt tired, she stopped slamming the door. And she turned around to talk to the old lady.When Old Lady Bai came forward, she carefully looked at the door and saw a copper lock hanging outside. She couldn\u2019t help but frown: \u201cIsn\u2019t this a lock? So, no one was inside?\u201dMrs. Liu indeed saw a lock hanging on the door from the outside\u2026 \u2026 Meaning, she has been slamming the door for a long time for nothing, right?At the next moment, Village Chief Li came back to the village with a hoe on his shoulder. When he saw Mrs. Liu and Old Lady Bai outside the cabin. He smiled and said: \u201cAre you two looking for Zhao Lan? She and Old Hu were planting peanut seeds on the field. She seems to be helping him out. But, they just started, so it will take sometime before they came back. Do you need to see her urgently?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: Slapped the faceUpon hearing this, Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu\u2019s face blacken. No one works in their family\u2019s field, their land stayed idle. Zhao Lan was feeling better that\u2019s why she worked in the other people\u2019s fields to help?Old Lady Bai was afraid Village Chief Li was only mistaken, so she carefully asked: \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Zhao Lan\u2019s right hand was injured, how can she plant seeds with that hand?\u201dVillage Chief Li smiled and said: \u201cFor diligent people, they can work even with one hand. But for lazy people, even they are not missing any limbs, they will not work.\u201d Village Chief Li swept his eyes to the first daughter-in-law. And then he went back home with his hoe in the shoulder.Mrs. Liu was stunned, she then turned her head and asked the old lady: \u201cNiang, is he talking about,\u00a0point at the mulberry tree and curse the locust tree?\u201dOld Lady Bai looked back at her and snorted: \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear it yourself?\u201dMrs. Liu completely understood the meaning, so she gritted her teeth and said: \u201cThis old village chief\u2019s mouth can really hurt people. He shouldn\u2019t let me see him next time.\u201dOld Lady Bai was stunned, but later on coldly snorted: \u201cWhat about seeing him? You dare make a move on him? Don\u2019t you know that two of his three sons are butchers of pigs? Can you handle them?\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu thought of how fierce and scary the sons of Village Chief Li were, she\u00a0suddenly lost her arrogance. Then, she compared her situation, her husband was a lazy bum. Her eldest son doesn\u2019t know martial arts. Her younger son was a scholar student. All in all, their family was not their opponent.\u201cI\u2019m just talking randomly, I have nothing against them.\u201dOld Lady Bai was too lazy to mind her stupid daughter-in-law. Her heart was burning more and more fire. This Zhao Lan neglected their family\u2019s field and help Hu Changlin instead? She clearly slapping her face. The villagers must be laughing at them behind their back.\u201cNiang, what should we do now? Do you want to open this door and look for the eggs?\u201d Mrs. Liu asked.Old Lady Bai shook her head: \u201cNo, this cabin belongs to Hu Changlin. If you break this door and he asked for us to pay, can you pay?\u201d\u201cThen, we will just forget it?\u201d Mrs. Liu asked, but seeing the old lady\u2019s face she knew she had an idea.Old Lady Bai coldly grunted: \u201cForget it? There is no such cheap word in this world. Since Zhao Lan can now work with her hands, she and her daughter should go back home today. They can no longer stay in the Hu Family.\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu heard this, she immediately became happy. If Zhao Lan went back, that dead girl would naturally have to go back. Things will return\u00a0back to normal, they don\u2019t need to work again.\u201cSo, we\u2019ll wait here?\u201dOld Lady\u00a0Bai said: \u201cWait? Wait for what? Let\u2019s go back first. Let\u2019s come again once Daizhu and Erzhu came back from the town.\u201d Old Lady Bai was simply afraid of Hu Feng. Hu Changlin\u2019s adopted son. She heard Hu Feng knows martial arts. She and Mrs. Liu were both females, so they can\u2019t fight with him. If her two sons were present, their winning odds will be much higher.As the sun grew stronger, Mrs. Liu refused to go back. She hasn\u2019t got the eggs. So, she was unwilling to leave: \u201cNiang, what about the eggs?\u201dOld Lady Bai said: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it. When Daizhu and Erzhu take Zhao Lan back to the house. Those eggs will naturally fell in our hands, right?\u201dMrs. Liu really wanted to give the old lady a thumbs up. She really calculated everything.\u201cThen, why are we staying here? Let\u2019s go!\u201d Old Lady Bai glared at Mrs. Liu. This woman always taught Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi a lesson with an awe-inspiring spirit. But, once she went outside the house, she will become stupid. Her brain shrink. She can\u2019t do anything but rely on an old woman like her.Point at the mulberry tree and curse the locust tree \u2013\u00a0To scold indirectly.\u00a0When names are not used directly, those accused cannot retaliate without revealing their complicity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Snow Lotus HerbWho knows how long the two of them walked, but finally they reached the foot of the Luoying mountain. Bai Zhi was so tired and hungry. The egg she had eaten this morning has already been digested. Her stomach was now feeling empty. Her mouth was dry. As if there was a fire inside her throat.Hu Feng pointed to a grass road not far away from them: \u201cThere is a small stream over there, you can wash your face and drink water.\u201dAs soon as Bai Zhi heard there was a water, she immediately swallowed her saliva and ran quickly towards the direction. At the end of the grass area, a clear water stream could be seen. Bai Zhi drink a few mouthfuls of water. After drinking and washing her face, the cold stream water made her feel refreshed. Bai Zhi sat on the grass area behind her and said: \u201cIf only we could catch two fish in this stream\u2026 \u2026\u201d Bai Zhi just opened her mouth, but her stomach groaned.At this time, Hu Feng also washed his face and got up, then said: \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s rest again later, we can\u2019t go up the mountain at noon.\u201dBai Zhi angrily sighed and got up, she lifted up her feet to go, but her eyes swept to the crooked plants behind her buttocks that looked unusual. It looked the same to the little yellow flowers to the roadside, but also looked like a snow flower.Bai Zhi lifted her foot and looked at it. She took a few stepped closers and stopped: \u201cWait.\u201d Then, she abruptly stood up and walked over to the little yellow flower that looked like a\u00a0snow flower.Hu Feng also turned back and frowned: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that this wildflower is a herbal medicine.\u201dBai Zhi smelled the little yellow flower and smiled: \u201cYou guessed it right. These little yellow flowers are herbal medicines. I think I\u2019m the only one who knows and understand the use of this.\u201dHu Feng slightly lifted his handsome eyebrow: \u201cAre you here alone?\u201dBai Zhi raised her head and smirked: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong of me to say that, it\u2019s us.\u201d In order to transfer the topic, Bai Zhi busily pointed her finger towards the little yellow flowers and said: \u201cThis little yellow flower is a herbal medicine, it\u2019s roots are even better and taste good.\u201d Then, Bai Zhi quickly unloaded her bamboo bag and took out her small shovel to excavate. However, she only dug for a while, but she\u2019s almost out of breath.Hu Feng saw that she was very serious about digging. She doesn\u2019t look joking at all. So, he crouched and took the shovel in her hand: \u201cYou take a break, I will dig it.\u201dBai Zhi could no longer continue, so naturally, she hurriedly sat down and take a break.With Hu Feng\u2019s strength, after digging three times, he soon dug out the flowers with the roots.Hu Feng then pointed his finger to something lying in the soil and asked, \u201cAnd this?\u201dBai Zhi took a glanced and nodded her head quickly. Her face become bright: \u201cYes, yes, also this.\u201dBai Zhi stretched out her hand and picked up the dirty thing like sweet potato.Hu Feng asked: \u201cIs this also wild sweet potato?\u201d Those things looked very similar to the black things he had dug from the mountains.Bai Zhi shook her head and took one to the river to wash it: \u201cThis snow lotus herb is also called yacon. Yacon is very delicious, you try and taste it.\u201d Bai Zhi handed the washed Yacon to Hu Feng. Then, she took and washed another one.Hu Feng smelled the yacon. The yacon smells bad, so he frowned. \u201cCan you really eat this?\u201dBai Zhi was too lazy to talk nonsense with Hu Feng. She was hungry. She wanted to eat first before she explains things to him.After asking Hu Feng to hand over the dagger to her, Bai Zhi peeled off the skin of the yacon fruit and cut a piece and then eat it. Seeing this, Hu Feng swallowed his saliva.Bai Zhi cut off the half of her yacon fruit and handed it to Hu Feng: \u201cYou eat this first.\u201d\u00a0 Then, she peeled off the skin of the other yacon fruit in his hand.Hungry ghost and gods were really poor. Perhaps, he was so hungry and almost starving to death, so he didn\u2019t think that the half yacon fruit in his hand, was already stained by someone else\u2019s saliva\u2026 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: Disguising the sceneAfter taking a bite, a sweet and tender taste immediately swept his taste buds. The half yacon was bitten by Hu Feng for only two or three times.After eating, he unconsciously took two yacon fruits from the pit and went to the stream to wash them.The two of them sat down by the stream and eat the yacon until their stomach was full.When Hu Feng put away the dagger, he only remembered that he didn\u2019t know what it was yet.Bai Zhi seems to understand what he wanted to ask, so she took the initiative: \u201cThis snow lotus herb is also called yacon. You can eat it just like the sweet potatoes. So, rest assured.\u201dHu Feng nodded his head and looked back at the few yacon fruits that were left. Then, he said: \u201cI will dig a few more pit and bring them together.\u201dBai Zhi busily said: \u201cDon\u2019t dig now, let\u2019s dig when we\u2019re about to go down the mountain. It will save us energy.\u201dHu Feng thought about it too, so he said: \u201cThen, let\u2019s wash these few yacon fruits and eat them when we get hungry.\u201d Hu Feng then excavated the remaining yacon fruits and washed them. After that, he returned the scattered soil into the pit. Refilling them like nothing happened. So that, when someone else came, no one will notice that they dug something from there.Bai Zhi gave him a thumbs up: \u201cGood, it will disguise the scene.\u201dHu Feng didn\u2019t make a sound, but his face was a bit reddish. His lips were also slightly curved with a smile.After busily working, the two of them began to walk up the mountain again. From the foot of the mountain, except for\u00a0the wild grass, they didn\u2019t see even dead branches. They want to hunt for prey and pick up some good herbs, so obviously, they need to go to the deeper part of the mountain.Hu Feng came more than once in this place. So, he took her to the familiar road. Halfway from the middle of the mountain, the road began to change completely.The distance between trees became dense. Dead branches could be seen were everywhere. The dead leaves under the trees were thick. The light in the surroundings become darker and darker. As if from the ordinary mountain, it became a grim and gloomy forest.Bai Zhi unconsciously leaned against Hu Feng\u2019s side. Her small hand clutched to his clothes. Her eyes were looking everywhere.Hu Feng never likes it when someone approaches him. He also hates it when someone touches him. So, he stretched out his hand, wanting to push Bai Zhi away, but when he saw her frightened, but excited eyes. He put down his hand. At this moment, he suddenly realized that it felt quite good when a little girl was sticking around him.\u201cScared?\u201d Hu Feng\u00a0 whispered.Bai Zhi stubbornly shook her head: \u201cI\u2019m not scared. What\u2019s scary about this place?\u201d.\u201dWhen her words just fell, a sudden gush of strong wind passed through the forest. The wind swept away the leaves.For Hu Feng, this event was very common in the forest, but for Bai Zhi who was never been to a\u00a0forest before. It was like a demon was howling. Bai Zhi was very scared, so she simply hide in Hu Feng\u2019s chest. She tightly closed her eyes and clasped her hand to Hu Feng\u2019s clothes. Her brain had imagined the demon fox she had seen on the TV.Hu Feng looked at the little girl who had thrown herself into his arms. She said that she was not afraid a bit earlier, but now, she was so scared like this? He really couldn\u2019t understand what she was afraid of.\u201cDidn\u2019t you just said you are not scared?\u201dBai Zhi opened her eyes. Her big black eyes moved everywhere, but he only saw the quietness of the surroundings. In addition to Hu Feng\u2019s steady heartbeat, it seems there was no other sound.Bai Zhi swallowed her saliva, then took a deep breath. She lifted her chin and said: \u201cWho, who said that I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m not scared! I just feared that the sands will go into my eyes. So, I hide.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: An idiot without a past\u201cReally?\u201d Hu Feng laughed. This little girl was really stubborn. She just came in this Luoying Mountain, so there were still a lot of \u2018surprises\u2019 waiting for her.The two of them continued to walk. Apart from a very few ordinary herbs along the way, there was nothing to gain. Bai Zhi began to feel a little depressed. Her interest was not as high as earlier.\u201cWhat? Are you disappointed?\u201d Hu Feng, who was holding a sharp wooden stick in his hand said while watching the surrounding with vigilance. No matter how many times he came on this mountain, he never dared to lower his guard. There was no fixed atmosphere in an old forest. The beast doesn\u2019t come out during the daytime, but it doesn\u2019t mean it will never come out.The trees in the old forest were very thick. The branches and leaves were more lavish than the ordinary trees. The old forest looked gloomy and cold, but the warm sunlight could still penetrate, so the old gloomy forest still has some warmth and light.In the 23rd century, Bai Zhi has her own greenhouse, which she used to specifically plant rare herbs, that were on the verge of extinction. She knew only sunny places could cultivate the finest herb.So whenever Bai Zhi sees a large array of sunlight in between the leaves, she will rush towards it and look. She also found some herbs under the trees, but they were mostly herbs for treating trauma. Although their quality was good, they were not the things she wanted. Those herbs were very common. Even if she took a basket of it, she can only sell it for a few coins.\u201cThese are not herbs?\u201d Hu Feng couldn\u2019t help but asked when he saw her excited and disappointed look.Bai Zhi shook her head, then said: \u201cIt\u2019s a herbal medicine, but it\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for. It\u2019s too ordinary. Its only worth a few copper coins.\u201dHu Feng raised an eyebrow: \u201cSo, you know many kinds of herbs?\u201dBai Zhi looked at Hu Feng, his face under the sunlight and shadow of the leaves was a bit blurred. Only his eyes looked clear and bright: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201dHu Feng didn\u2019t say anything.Ba Zhi shrugged her shoulders: \u201cWhether you believe me or not, it doesn\u2019t matter. But, why do you want me to cure you?\u201dHu Feng turned his head and looked into a far distance. His eyes gradually became confused: \u201cBecause I have no choice.\u201dHe doesn\u2019t know who he was. What was his name? Why did he lose his memories? He became an idiot without a past.\u00a0 He wanted to retrieve those memories and become a normal person. Just like everyone else.Ordinary doctors have no ability to cure his illness, while he had no money to ask a famous doctor for a cure. It has already been three years since then.Yesterday, when he saw Bai Zhi\u2019s special method of treatment that saved Yingzi, who had already died. The fire of hope that almost disappeared in his heart quietly ignited.When Bai Zhi thinks about her past, she remembered the despair and pain she experienced when she was abandoned by her biological parents. If she can, she would rather forget those kinds of memories. She had hoped many times for those memories to be erased from her mind. Remembering them only give her heartache.\u201cSometimes, losing some memories are not necessarily a bad thing. And finding back those memories are not necessarily a good thing.\u201d Bai Zhi smiled bitterly. Her heart was a bit in pain. No matter how long she tried to hide those memories in the darkness, it still appeared in front of her eyes from time to time.She desperate study hard, which resulted in her becoming the top one. The first in the capital, nor in the country.She was also the first doctor who had doctoral degree in both Chinese and Western medicine at the age of 21. And at the age of 23, she did not only became the youngest doctor in Mingxing Hospital, but also the most skilled medical practitioner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: Eating meat againShe wanted to use her own efforts to prove to the world that she was worth it. She wanted her parents to regret abandoning her.After looking for a long time, she finally found her biological parents. She was planning to show herself with such great achievements. She wanted to stand upright in front of them and tell them that she lived very well without them.Unfortunately, she hasn\u2019t achieved that goal, when she changed from a famous doctor of the 23rd century into a young farmer in this world.Hu Feng always looked at the little girl in front of him. He didn\u2019t take away his eyes to her childish face. Her eyes looked beautiful, bright and smart. But at the same time, there was deep restraint that wasn\u2019t consistent in her age.\u201cThat is wrong. A person\u2019s memory is proof of his existence in the past. How can a person obliterate his past just because of someone else preference? Can you call person normal if he can\u2019t remember his past?\u201dHu Feng rarely spoke such a long sentence. What more, he rarely spoke. But today, he seemed said a lot of words. With this little girl, he always talked, just like the ordinary people in the village. In front of her, he seems like a normal person.Bai Zhi sighed and said: \u201cYou are right. Everyone\u2019s situation is different. Because I have some bad memories, I felt like losing some memories were not a big deal. Perhaps in your memory, there were a lot of good and beautiful things that you don\u2019t want to forget. So, you can\u2019t just forget them all.\u201dBai Zhi looked up and looked at his half lighted and shadowed handsome face. Then, she said with a serious looking face: \u201cHu Feng, rest assured. I will cure your illness. I\u2019ll help you recover your memories as soon as possible.\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t know how much a promised could cost. And how much her success rate was. He felt very comfortable in his heart. He felt that he still had hope in this life. He felt like all his struggles were worth it.Hu Feng was\u00a0about to say thank you when a slight movement came from behind her. His eyes then passed over her neck and landed on the trunk behind. A fancy green snake spitting a long red tongue was rushing towards Bai Zhi.Without any plans, Hu Feng grabbed the snake with one hand, as his other hand quickly pushed Bai Zhi away on the ground.His push was extremely strong. Bai Zhi\u2019s body completely planted on the ground. Her mouth kissed the mud. Bai Zhi climbed up to curse Hu Feng, but she saw a snake as thick as a child\u2019s arm on his hand. The snake\u2019s opened mouth revealed it\u2019s little fangs. And it\u2019s throat revealing a strange sound.It turned out there was a snake behind her. If Hu Feng didn\u2019t save her, she might have been bitten by that snake now.Hu Feng grabbed the seven inches green snake. Then, he slammed it on the trunk to the side. The green snake\u2019s head was broken.Hu Feng then turned to look at her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201dBai Zhi nodded her head and said: \u201cI\u2019m fine, what about you?\u201dHu Feng also nodded his head: \u201cI\u2019m fine, let\u2019s go and find the herbs you want. Then, let\u2019s hurry go down the mountain, before it get\u2019s dark.\u201dHowever, Bai Zhi pointed her finger at the dead green snake under the tree: \u201cLet\u2019s take this. Then, let\u2019s go and find Hu bo and Niang later. Let\u2019s roast it and eat together.\u201dHu Feng stared at her with wide eyes opened in shocked: \u201cEat the snake? Can you eat a snake? Isn\u2019t a snake poisonous?\u201dBai Zhi also looked at him with shocked: \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten a snake?\u201d The snakes were delicious. Its meat was soft and tender. Whether it was fried or stewed, it was delicious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: BluebellHu Feng shook his head: \u201cI\u2019ve never eaten it before. I\u2019ve killed a few snakes before when I was hunting. But, I didn\u2019t know it was edible.\u201dBai Zhi felt pity when she listened: \u201cIt\u2019s a pity, you didn\u2019t know the taste of the snake meat. But, you will know it later.\u201dAlthough Hu Feng still has some resistance to eat a snake. He hasn\u2019t eaten\u00a0meat for a long time now. When he listened to her words, it gave birth to a wonderful feeling. And so, he followed her words and put the snake on the cloth bag.The two of them continued to walk deep into the forest. Along the way, Hu Feng hunted two gray rabbits. The rabbits were very fat, but Hu Feng didn\u2019t seem to be happy.\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not satisfied with them? I haven\u2019t pick up the herbs I want yet.\u201d Bai Zhi asked with a smile.Hu Feng swept his eyes to the heavy cloth bag and whispered: \u201cThis gray rabbit doesn\u2019t worth much. Even if you add these two, you can only sell it for 60 copper coins.\u201dBai Zhi was\u00a0stunned and rolled her eyes: \u201cWhat? 60 copper coins? These two big rabbits only cost 60 copper coins? Isn\u2019t it almost the same the price of a cabbage?\u201dHu Feng shrugged his shoulders: \u201cThere is no other choice. This animal can easily catch and its meat was unpalatable. Only a few rich families were willing to buy its meat. The town shop put a lot of pressure to its price, so it\u2019s current price only reach the price of a cabbage.\u201d\u201cHow can it\u2019s meat be so cheap? Moreover, the rabbit\u2019s meat tastes so delicious. Who said it was unpalatable? That person must not know how to cook it. He shouldn\u2019t blame the rabbit\u2019s meat ah.\u201d\u201cYou know how to cook it?\u201d\u00a0 Hu Feng raised an eyebrow.Bai Zhi nodded: \u201cOf course, I know how delicious the braised rabbit meat I made. Don\u2019t sell it. I will show you how good it is at dinner.\u201dHu Feng nodded: \u201cOkay. It won\u2019t sell a good price anyway.\u201dWhile discussing, Bai Zhi suddenly smelled a scent. A scent that was very faint. It was mixed with the fragrance of grass, leaves, and soil. If a person doesn\u2019t know it, it was very difficult to distinguish.Bai Zhi began to get excited. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes. When she opened her eyes, she pointed her finger in the direction: \u201cOver there.\u201dHu Feng doesn\u2019t understand: \u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201dBai Zhi replied: \u201cThe herbs that I\u2019m looking for was over there.\u201dBai Zhi continue followed the direction of the faint smell and went to the deepest part of the forest. Hu Feng followed closely behind her with vigilance. He had never been in this place before.\u00a0 This area was the real Luoying Mountain and not the area they just walked.Bai Zhi suddenly stopped her footsteps and looked at the green field not far away from of her. There were no towers of trees, there was a vast blue sky up above. A golden sunlight projected the whole green area. The green field was completely bathing in sunlight. The scent led her into this place.Bai Zhi was very excited. In the 23rd century, she tried cultivating Bluebell for two years but failed.Bluebell was almost extinct in the 23rd century. She and several professors tried to cultivate this herb but also failed.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Seeing her so excited, Hu Feng couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cThis is bluebell, it\u2019s a very expensive herbal medicine. It\u2019s extremely difficult to plant. Not to mention this many!\u201d At least, the whole green field was approximately 10 square meters.Hu Feng snorted and asked: \u201cWhat kind of disease can this herb cure?\u201dWhat kind of disease can this herb cure?\u00a0This sentence seems not only like a nail that was pondered on her brain, but also like a cold water of basin that was poured on her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: 100 years old ginsengBluebell was undoubtedly a herbal medicine. But, can it really be considered to be an extremely precious herb?Perhaps, not really. Bluebell has a fragrant smell, but taste bitter. It was mainly used to lessen to the side effect of strong drugs. It was also similar to licorice, but not as good as it is.Therefore, modern pharmacists were very reluctant to plant bluebells. And over the time, bluebells were replaced by another kind of herbs.It was not until that year when she inadvertently discovered that there was a very special medicinal essence in bluebell. This medicinal essence could kill cancer cells. In which it became a marvelous discovery. But, when she discovered it, there was only very few bluebells that exist in the world. And the current situation of the environment in the 23rd century was no longer suitable to grow bluebell.However, although there was a large file of bluebell in front of her. How will she extract its medicinal essence and do a research medicine in this world?This was not the 23rd century, she can\u2019t extract the medicinal essence. So, this bluebell was now only an ordinary herb\u2026 \u2026Seeing the excitement on her face gradually diminishing, Hu Feng was confused: \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201dBai Zhi sighed and shook her head: \u201cNothing, I\u2019m glad to see these bluebells. But, I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t sell at a good price. Forget it, let them grow here first. Maybe, we can use them in the future.\u201dBai Zhi\u00a0turned around with a bitter smile. The bamboo bag on her back was still empty. She thought, in such a big forest, there will be abundant herbs, but\u2026 \u2026 imagination was still far from reality.At this time, she was physically exhausted. She knows she could no longer go forward. They must return on the same road. Otherwise, if they were lost and the night came, the hungry animals will eat them. They will end up miserable.But, just as she was preparing to return back to the village, a bright red color fell on her eyes. She thought she was blinded. But, under the tree, near the bluebell\u2019s field, there was a dazzling red color.Bai Zhi quickly rushed over and stared at the bright red jujube-like fruit.Hu Feng also followed and glanced at the red fruit. He was curious, so he asked: \u201cIs this a wild fruit?\u201dBai Zhi rubbed together her palms and said with a smile: \u201cNo, this is not a wild fruit. This is a wild ginseng! A wild ginseng ah! With its size, it can be sold with a big amount.\u201dWhen\u00a0Hu Feng\u00a0heard it was a wild ginseng, he also got excited. The ginseng was as precious as gold. Especially the wild ginseng in this kind of forest. An average person like him cannot afford it.Bai Zhi took out her small shovel and carefully excavated the ginseng. Hu Feng didn\u2019t help her this time. He doesn\u2019t understand this thing. He might destroy it if he helps.Digging ginseng was a very meticulous work. She mustn\u2019t be anxious or hurry. She must ensure and keep the quality of this ginseng. After all, the more the quality was good, the better the price.After digging for a long time, half the body of ginseng was finally revealed. This ginseng was bigger than she had imagined. She doesn\u2019t know how long it has grown in this deep forest. Maybe, it was more than a hundred years old.After she finished digging out the whole ginseng, Bai Zhi patted the soil and smiled in front of Hu Feng: \u201cHave you ever seen such a big ginseng before?\u201dHu Feng shook his head, then said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I lost my memory. But in 3 years I lived in Huangtou Village, I\u2019ve never seen one.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: One\u2019s life experienceBai Zhi looked at the wild ginseng in her hands. If it was in the modern era, such a hundred-year-old wild ginseng will sell at least 200, 000 yuan.In the 23rd century, there were farmers specialized in growing ginseng. They were growing an artificial ginseng but the price was still good. At most, the price was 100, 000 yuan per piece. And the real hundred-year-old ginseng has been dug and cut out by them. So, most likely, all the wild ginseng in the market were fake, which ordinary people couldn\u2019t distinguish.\u201cHu Feng, how much money can you sell this wild ginseng?\u201d Bai Zhi asked.Hu Feng shook his head again: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cAnyway, no matter what price we could sell it, we will divide it in half.\u201dHu Feng raised an eyebrow. This little girl was generous. She thought he was protecting her, so she should give him half of the price. Hu Feng didn\u2019t refuse, their family was too poor and also needed money.Bai Zhi wrapped the ginseng in the leaves and put it inside her bamboo bag. She also put some common herbs on the top, so that when they went back, no one could see it.Now, she and the Bai Family aren\u2019t separated yet. If they learn this thing, will they let it aside? Obviously not.The two of them went back on the same road. They were lucky enough because they came back early. On the way back, Hu Feng hunted two pheasants. Although it was not worth a lot of money, he could sell it if needed.After going down the deep forest, they drank water at the stream. They dug the pit of yacon and washed all the remaining fruits to take it back.There was a bamboo forest not far from Bai Zhi\u2019s current place. Hu Feng went close to it and cut a bamboo that was thick as an arm.After cutting, Hu Feng threw it in front of Bai Zhi and asked: \u201cWhat do you want to do with it?\u201dBai Zhi pointed her finger at the stream on the side and smiled: \u201cHu Bo and Niang are both working in the field. The weather is hot, so they must have drunk the water they brought. This water is very cold, it will alleviate the heat in their body.\u201dHu Feng understood her meaning: \u201cYou are very careful.\u201d He took the bamboo tubes and cleaned it before he filled it with the water stream. Then, he covered it with the leaves.Bai Zhi\u2019s bamboo bag almost become full. There were still injuries in her shoulders. So, every step she took was like torture.Bai Zhi gritted her teeth and didn\u2019t scream in pain, nor complain.Hu Feng was originally walking in the front. He deliberately slowed down his footsteps, but the little girl still couldn\u2019t keep up with his pace.He stopped and turned to look at the slender figure, step by step walking towards him. Under the sunlight, her face was full of purple bruises and wounds. She lacks the tenacity of ordinary girls should have.She was always frowning and biting her lips. Her hands were at the bottom of her back as if she was trying to relive some weight on her shoulders.Despite this action, there were some traces of scarlet blood on the shoulder part of her dress.Hu Feng wrinkled his eyebrows and quickly approached her. Then, he stretched out his hand and unloaded the bamboo bag on her back.Bai Zhi looked up and stared at Hu Feng. Her sweat was almost covering her eyes, but the tall and fuzzy figure gave her a peace of mind.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Bai Zhi rubbed her aching shoulder and looked at Hu Feng inexplicably.Hu Feng took out the pheasant from the cloth bag on his back and said: \u201cYou hold this, I will carry your bag.\u201dHu Feng was originally carrying two big gray rabbits, two pheasants, a thick green snake and a bag full of yacon fruits. Adding them all, he was carrying a much heavier stuff than the little girl. But now, he was also carrying her bamboo bag on his back.Hu Feng didn\u2019t say another word, he just turned and walked away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: A dead snakeBai Zhi looked at Hu Feng\u2019s tall figure, that was walking steady and calm. This was not a kind of man that grew up on a mountain. Bai Zhi suddenly got curious:\u00a0What kind of person is Hu Feng before he got an amnesia?When Bai Zhi returned to her senses, Hu Feng had gone far, and so she trotted along with the pheasants.Bai Zhi\u00a0looked at the sun in the sky and concluded that it was about noon time now. This was how the ancient people predict the time.At this time, the sun\u2019s heat was the most dangerous. But, people who worked in the field hardly paid attention to it. Some people will go home and have some lunch. Some people will find a place or trees to rest in the shade. Waiting for the heat to disperse a bit and then work again. As to avoid getting sick and buy medicines that were not much worth than a candle.Hu Feng led Bai Zhi to their family\u2019s field. Their vegetable and wheat field was not in the same place. Their vegetable field was near in the slope, where there were trees and grass everywhere. That place was cooler than any place in the field. There were many shades that can be used to take a break. No wonder the Bai Family likes to work in a dry land.When they saw Hu Changlin, he was drenched in sweat. Zhao Lan was following behind him and helping him breaking the soil. Although she was using her left hand, she can still do a good job.Bai Zhi took three steps sideways and another two steps in front: \u201cNianggg, we\u2019re back!\u201dZhao Lan stopped her hand and turned her head. She saw her daughter running towards her. Her face that was full of purple bruises was red, so it became more and more visible. There were dead pheasants in her hand.\u201cSlow down, don\u2019t fall.\u201d Zhao Lan smiled and put down her farm tool. Then, she took Bai Zhi\u2019s hand and pulled her in the shade under the tree: \u201cYou rest here. We still have some work left. We will go back once we finished.\u201dBai Zhi pulled her mother: \u201cDon\u2019t, Niang, you take a break, okay? I will do it.\u201d Bai Zhi handed the pheasants to her mother and turned to go in the ground. She just saw how her mother did it, and it was not hard with the help of the farm tool.At this time, Hu Feng also unloaded the cloth bag and bamboo bag on his back and put them under the tree. When he saw Bai Zhi going on the ground, he also followed and grab the farm tool in her hand, then said: \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dHu Feng still has a great strength. He held the farm tool in his hand and pulled Bai Zhi to the side with his other hand.Hu Changlin, who was on the side, look at them with a smile. He said: \u201cZhi\u2019er you are tired too. Just rest with your mother. I will finish the rest with Hu Feng.\u201dBai Zhi was still injured, she shouldn\u2019t do a heavy work. Hu Changlin said so, so Bai Zhi said nothing regarding about\u00a0it. She just smiled and said: \u201cThen, I\u2019ll just prepare something you could eat. I\u2019ll make you a good one.\u201dHu Changlin wanted to ask her where was she going to get a food. But, when he saw her happily going under the tree, he no longer asks anything. He thought Hu Feng had dug some more sweet potatoes on the mountain. After all, in that wilderness, what else was there?Hu Changlin and Hu Feng continued to work hard. While Bai Zhi pulled out the dead snake from the bag.Zhao Lan was scared to death when she saw the snake.Seeing Zhao Lan\u2019 s shocked face while jumping to the side. Bai Zhi swayed the snake on her hand and smiled: \u201cNiang, look, it\u2019s a dead snake, why are you so scared?\u201dZhao Lan saw that the snake was indeed dead. So, she sighed in relief, but she still didn\u2019t dare to approach it. She pointed her finger at it and said to Bai Zhi: \u201cHurry, throw it away.\u201dHowever,\u00a0Bai Zhi shook her head: \u201cThat can\u2019t be done. We can eat it for lunch today. Why throw it away?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: Roasted SnakeWhen Zhao Lan heard her daughter\u2019s words, her eyeballs almost drop on the ground: \u201cWhat are you talking about? Eat the snake? Isn\u2019t snake poisonous?\u201dBai Zhi smiled and pulled Zhao Lan back into the shade: \u201cThere is a poisonous snake, but this one is not poisonous at all. On the contrary, it is delicious and nutritious. You will not know it unless you try.\u201dZhao Lan still has some doubt. She was afraid of it, but she could see that her daughter was so sure about it. She even saw her pouring water on it and cleaning. Bai Zhi took out the bamboo tube on her bamboo bag. She took a sip first and then rinse the snake meat with the remaining water.Bai Zhi hangs the cleaned snake\u2019s skin on the branch. Then, she burned a pile of dry branches nearby. She cut the snake meat into four sections and stick them on small branches.The snake meat was like a fish. Its meat was very easy to cook. In a short while, a seductive scent made Hu Changlin and Hu Feng stopped their hands from working and turned to look.\u201cIs that the snake meat?\u201d Hu Feng asked with amazement while staring at snake meat burning on the fire.Bai Zhi nodded her head: \u201cMmm, this snake meat is fresh and delicious. It\u2019s nutritious, so it will nourish your body. You try it.\u201d Bai Zhi took the largest one and handed it to Hu Changlin.As the roasted snake meat getting closer and closer, it\u2019s seductive scent was getting richer and richer. Hu Changlin was already hungry, so when he smelled it, he couldn\u2019t refuse.He put down the farm tool and patted away the gray soil in his hands before he took the roasted snake that was handed over to him. Hu Changlin couldn\u2019t wait any longer, so he took a bite. Although there was no seasonings, nor salt. The taste has no any difference.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Bai Zhi asked Hu Changlin.Hu Changlin\u2019s mouth was full. He bites the roasted snake meat right into his mouth. So, he could only raise his thumb and vaguely said that it was delicious.Bai Zhi took another two sticks of snake meat and handed it to Hu Feng and Zhao Lan. She left the smallest part to herself.Zhao Lan saw her daughter\u2019s food was too small, so she wanted to change with her. But, Bai Zhi didn\u2019t agree. Bai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cNiang, I\u2019m not hungry at all. This stick is enough. Besides, Hu Feng and I ate at the foot of the mountain. I ate two yacon fruits. I\u2019m not hungry now.\u201dZhao Lan didn\u2019t believe her: \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying? Where in this place could you find yacon fruits? Isn\u2019t that something only grow in a snowy mountain like Tianshan?\u201dBai Zhi replied: \u201cThis yacon fruit is different. You eat the snake meat first. You will know what yacon fruit I\u2019m saying later.\u201dSeeing her daughter keep insisting on this, Zhao Lan felt warm in her heart. Her daughter seemed more intimate than before.After the large snake meat was eaten, Hu Changlin obviously was still not full, so he sighed and said: \u201cIf I knew that snake could be eaten and taste delicious, I should have killed a lot of snakes in this filed. But, it\u2019s a pity, I threw them all away.\u201dBai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cIf you like to eat a snake, you can ask Hu Feng to give you a hand. Hu Feng is amazing, he can grab the snake as if only grabbing a mosquito. The snake couldn\u2019t fight at all.\u201dWhen Hu Changlin and Zhao La heard Bai Zhi\u2019s exaggerated words, they laughed and laughed. It was only Hu Feng who stayed silent, but his lips have a pretty smile.After eating the snake tail in her hand, Bai Zhi took out two bamboo tubes from her bamboo bag, which was filled with a cold water from the stream.\u201cThis is what we brought from the foot of the Luoyang Mountain. You two drink this, me and niang will drink the other one.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: 100 year old wild ginsengHu Changlin took the bamboo tube and drank the spring water. Although it was not that cold, it was a great satisfaction in this summer heat of the afternoon.Hu Changlin handed the remaining half of the water to Hu Feng, but Hu Feng refused to accept it. Saying he was not thirsty.Hu Changlin scratched his head: \u201cOh, look at my memory. I forgot you don\u2019t like sharing utensils with other people. I should have let you drink first.\u201dHu Feng didn\u2019t answer, he got up and walked towards the bamboo bag and took out two yacon fruits from the inside. Then, he took out his dagger and began peeling them.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Hu Changlin couldn\u2019t help but asked, he was happy inside his heart. Hu Feng seemed harvested a lot more this time, now that he went with Bai Zhi in the mountain.Hu Feng cut the yacon fruit several times. His movement was very fast. They didn\u2019t even see how did he cut it. The yacon fruit was peeled and cut in just a short moment.\u201cSnow lotus herb.\u201d He only spoke three words and handed it directly to Hu Changlin: \u201cYou eat them first.\u201dHu Changlin naturally wouldn\u2019t be polite to his son. He took a bite of the yacon fruit. The taste was sweet and it was crispy. He actually didn\u2019t know how to describe the delicious taste. It taste new and special.His first yacon fruit hasn\u2019t been swallowed, but Hu Feng was already cutting the second one. Then, handed it to Zhao Lan: \u201cYou eat.\u201dThis was the first time Hu Feng talked to Zhao Lan. Last time, when she almost fell to the hillside, Hu Feng passed by and helped her. At that time, she wanted to thank him, but he just left. Last night, she was eating in their house, but he never spoke with her.So this time,\u00a0Zhao Lan was somewhat flattered and quickly reached out her hand and took it.However, she didn\u2019t hurry to eat, instead, she handed it to Bai Zhi: \u201cYou eat this. The snake meat you ate was small. You must be hungry.\u201dBai Zhi pushed her mother\u2019s hand back and said: \u201cNiang, didn\u2019t I said before? When Hu Feng dug these yacon fruits, I already ate two. Now, I\u2019m still full, I don\u2019t want to eat at all. Besides, there were still a lot of them in the bag.\u201dHu Changlin looked at Bai Zhi and couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cDidn\u2019t you said you wanted to go to the mountain to pick up some herbs? Did you find any?\u201dBai Zhi got up and looked at the surroundings. When she was sure no one was around and listening. She whispered: \u201cHu Bo, we dug a hundred-year-old wild ginseng. After we sold it, we will divide it into two.\u201dWhen Hu Changlin heard her words, his jaw almost drop to the ground. He thought he heard it wrong: \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dBai Zhi took the wild ginseng from the bottom of her bag: \u201cThis is it. Hu Bo, how much do you think we can sell this wild ginseng?\u201dWhen Hu Changlin saw the wild ginseng. He was obviously very excited. He wanted to touch it, but he was afraid to break it. So, he retracted his hand and sighed: \u201cThis big wild ginseng seems a hundred-year-old. You can sell it for at least 100 silver coins.\u201d100 silver coins?Zhao Lan\u2019s eyes widen several degrees, her voice even trembled: \u201cHow much is it? 1, 100 silver coins?\u201dHu Changlin waved his hand: \u201cI am not really sure, but I\u2019ve heard people talked about it before. They said those rich people in the town rarely found wild ginseng. They could only find and bought common ginseng worth dozens of silvers. So, with its size, I supposed it could be sold for 100 silver coins.\u201dThe former Bai Zhi has never been to the town before. Her knowledge was very limited. Bai Zhi couldn\u2019t even find any helpful idea in her memory at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Each person gets half is very fair\u201cYesterday, I asked Lu Dafu if he can sell the herbal medicine I can find. Lu Dafu promised to help me. He is a doctor. He\u2019s not only familiar with medicines but also familiar in the pharmacies to the town. He can certainly sell this at a good price. If we sell it on our own, we may fail to sell it at a good price.\u201dHu Changlin listened and nodded: \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Old Lu is a good person. If he says he is willing to help, he will definitely help you. Zhi\u2019er, I didn\u2019t think that in your situation yesterday, you can still think of this idea. This is not simple ah.\u201dBai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cI just think of it on a whim. Hu Bo, don\u2019t exaggerate it too much. I am a proud person.\u201dThe four of them had a great time. Bai Zhi put back the wild ginseng in her bamboo bag and faced Hu Changlin: \u201cHu Bo, although this wild ginseng was dug by me, without Hu Feng\u2019s help, I won\u2019t be able to find it. I may even lose my life on the mountain. So, I decided that no matter what price I sold it, we will divide in half. What do you think?\u201dHu Changlin has never been a greedy and cheap person. After he heard her words, he hurriedly waved his hand: \u201cNo, that can\u2019t be. This wild ginseng is so valuable. It\u2019s not a common thing. We can\u2019t divide the price. You will lose too much money.\u201dZhao Lan also opened her mouth: \u201cHu Dage, can\u2019t you understand? If Hu Feng didn\u2019t protect Zhi\u2019er, she might have bitten by the snake now. How will she find this wild ginseng? I may also say, that giving you half the price is very little.\u201dHu Changlin swept his eyes to Hu Feng: \u201cWhat do you say?\u201dHu Feng\u2019s face was emotionless, but he swept his eyes to Bai Zhi and said: \u201cEach person gets half is very fair. Just do it.\u201dWith Hu Feng\u2019s words, Hu Changlin no longer refused. He just said with a smile: \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it. We will divide the price in half for the two families.\u201dHow long will it take before he could save 50 silver coins? So, Hu Changlin was naturally happy inside his heart. He has never seen so much money in his life. So, why he can\u2019t be happy?After the four of them rested for a while. They finished the work in the field together. While the sky was still bright, they hurried went home.But, after stepping into the village entrance, Bai Zhi pulled Hu Feng to go to Doctor Lu\u2019s house. She was not feeling safe with this wild ginseng. If she suddenly bumped with the Bai Family, she cannot save it.\u201cHu Bo, if you have free time, can you clean the big gray rabbit? At night, I will cook\u00a0braised rabbit meat for our dinner.\u201d Bai Zhi shouted while walking a few steps backward and turned around.Hu Changlin repeatedly nodded his head, while watching Bai Zhi and Hu Feng\u2019s departing figure. Then, he returned with Zhao Lan in his place.*Bai FamilyOld Lady Bai was sitting and chatting in the backyard with Mrs. Liu. When suddenly, she heard a movement in the front yard. And it seemed she heard Bai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu\u2019s voice. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law hurriedly threw away the fan in their hands and rushed towards the front yard to greet their hero.\u201cDazhu, Erzhu, you\u2019re back? What about the bag of white flour? Hurry and take it out, so we can eat steamed bread at night.\u201d When Old Lady Bai entered the house, she shouted at her two sons. Their door was wide opened, so the villagers definitely heard her voice.The villagers that could eat steamed bread were only a few. So today, when her two sons returned with the bag of flour, she naturally wanted the whole village to know that her sons also have abilities.But who knows, when she stood in the courtyard and saw the appearance of her two sons, she could no longer open her mouth to shout.The clothes of her two sons were torn and tattered. There were bluish purple bruises on their face. The corner of their mouth has some blood and their hair was messy. As if they escape a fight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Free PieBoth Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu\u2019s face dramatically changed. They rushed forward and encircled Bai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu. The two men returned empty-handed and only half living.\u201cWhat happened? Why do you look like this? Where is the bag of flour?\u201d Old Lady Bai asked urgently.Bai Dazhu murmured and then pushed Bai Erzhu\u2019s arm: \u201cYou say it.\u201dBai Erzhu laughed: \u201cYou are the big brother, so you say it.\u201dOld Lady Bai returned to her senses and stared at her two sons. Not only she didn\u2019t get the white flour, but she also loses a hundred copper coins. They even went back full of injuries.She swept her eyes outside their courtyard curiously and sneered. Then, she said with a cold face: \u201cGet inside the house and speak.\u201dOld Lady Bai beat her two sons, who were pushing and pinching each other to enter the house.After entering the house, Old Lady Bai turned to Mrs. Liu: \u201cClose the door.\u201dWhenever the old lady teaching Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi a lesson. She never avoided the villager\u2019s eyes. Instead, she was, even more, showing off her status and ability in the family.She was also teaching her sons a lesson, but she rarely does it in front of other people. Because for her, her son\u2019s face was the face of the Bai Family.\u201cTell me, what is going on?\u201d Old Lady Bai sat down at the table and stared at Bai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu.Bai Erzhu hurriedly pointed his finger at Bai Dazhu: \u201cIt\u2019s all big brother\u2019s fault. If it weren\u2019t for him, I will not lose.\u201dWhen Bai Dazhu heard his words, he immediate frown his eyebrows and stood up, then said: \u201cI didn\u2019t blame you, but you\u2019re blaming me? I ate two more pieces than you! So, why are you blaming me?\u201dAs the two brothers continued yelling at each other. Old Lady Bai\u2019s face was getting more and more ugly.\u201cYou all shut up! Did you bring back the bag of flour? What about the other things?\u201d Old Lady Bai asked.Bai Erzhu shrunk his neck, his eyes didn\u2019t dare to fall on his mother\u2019s face. He said with a small tone: \u201cI, we also wanted to take back the bag of flour, but we lose. So, naturally, we also couldn\u2019t take the other things, so, so\u2014\u201dOld Lady Bai felt a stabbing pain in her brain. She tried hard to suppressed her anger and asked: \u201cSince you didn\u2019t get the bag of flour, then what happened to the 100 copper coins I gave you? Did you get it back?\u201dThe two brothers looked at each other and hurriedly lowered their heads. No one could utter a word.Old Lady Bai roar in anger: \u201cI am talking to you two, are you all dumb? Where is the money? Did you get back the 100 copper coins?\u201dBai Dazhu saw that his second brother always refused to speak. So, he couldn\u2019t help but opened his mouth: \u201cNiang, don\u2019t mention it. For this 100 copper coins, I and Erzhu fight with the owner. We wanted to take back the money, so we got into a fight and get injured.\u201dThey were not seriously injured, it was only skin trauma. It will heal after a few days. They just looked\u00a0like this because they tore apart their clothes. They wanted to looked more miserable. Hoping that if their mother sees them like this, she will only give them a slap in the face and then forget the 100 copper coins\u2026 \u2026Old Lady Bai was so angry. She wanted to beat these two disappointing guys. But, seeing them injured, she can no longer pursue the matter. After all, it was her two sons, not Zhao Lan or Bai Zhi.\u201cForget it, I shouldn\u2019t have believed you yesterday. How can there be such a good thing in the world? Giving a\u00a0free bag of flour, isn\u2019t the owner himself asking for death?\u201d As the saying goes, there will be no free pie falling in the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Unclear relationshipBai Dazhu busily said: \u201cNiang, what you said is wrong. There was really such a good thing in this world. The other competitor really won a bag of flour. It\u2019s just, that man\u2019s appetite was bigger than us. Even if the two of us, added what we eat, we can\u2019t defeat that man. So tell me, how are we gonna win if we met such a person?\u201dOld Lady Bai stared at Bai Dazhu: \u201cHow many buns did you eat today?\u201dBai Dazhu stretched out his four fingers: \u201cFour.\u201dThen, Old Lady Bai looked at Bai Erzhu and asked the same question: \u201cWhat about you?\u201dBai Erzhu sticks out his two fingers: \u201cTwo\u2026 \u2026\u201dOld Lady Bai felt her brain began to hurt again: \u201cI bought six buns for 100 copper coins?\u201dBai Erzhu busily explain:ed \u201cYou should blame the owner. He had a black heart. The buns were too dry to eat, but he didn\u2019t give us water. How are we going to catch up? I\u2019m too thirsty, so how can I eat more?\u201dOld Lady Bai waved her hand: \u201cStop, don\u2019t speak anymore! You shouldn\u2019t blame others for your guilty conscience. Just blame yourself for being useless. You will only eat steamed buns, but you still lose? What can you do right?\u201dTheir fields stayed idle. They haven\u2019t finished planting. The villagers were busy planting, but their family was idle. They spent their money on other things, but they were beaten. If the villagers learned about this, they will laugh at them, right?The next moment, a loud voice came out from the door: \u201cNiang, open the door quickly!\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai heard the voice, her anger dispersed a lot. She looked at Mrs. Liu and busily said: \u201cXiaofeng is back, what are you doing? Hurry and open the door!\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu hurriedly opened the door and smiled, then pulled his son into the house: \u201cXiaofeng, how is your school today? Did your teacher praised you for your good handwriting?\u201dBai Xiaofeng put down his schoolbag in his hand and stared at the kettle on the table: \u201cI want to drink water. I am thirsty.\u201dOld Lady Bai rushed to the table and poured a water for her favorite grandson. She sighed and watched him drink the clean water. Then, she smiled and said: \u201cYou must be very exhausted. Hurry and go to rest. I will ask your niang to cook you an egg, to make up with your lost energy.\u201dBai Xiaofeng showed a smile on his flat face: \u201cGrandmother is kind. Oh right, I saw Third Aunt on the way.\u201dOld Lady Bai busily asked: \u201cWhere did you see her?\u201d\u201cAt the entrance to the village, she and Hu Changlin were walking together. The two went to the east side of the village with a smile.\u201dThey lived on the west side of the village. Hu Changlin\u2019s family lived on the east side. So obviously, she was\u00a0 going back with Hu Changlin.Old Lady Bai stood up and looked at Bai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu: \u201cYou two, changed your clothes and washed your face. We\u2019ll go to Hu Changling\u2019s house.\u201dBai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu were confused. But, Bai Dazhu took the initiative to speak: \u201cNiang, she hurt her hand. Now, she can\u2019t work in the field. Just let her live in Hu Changlin\u2019s house for a few more days. Let her return when she\u2019s cured. We can save a few more ration by then.\u201dOn the side, Mrs. Liu opened her mouth: \u201cYou might not know, but we went to Hu Changlin\u2019s house today. And guess what? This Zhao Lan actually went outside with Hu Changlin to work in their field. She didn\u2019t work in our family\u2019s field but work for the others. Since she can work with one hand, why she must stay in Hu Changlin\u2019s house?\u201dWhen Bai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu heard this, they immediately jumped up with their feet: \u201cWhat? What did you say? She went and work in Hu Changlin\u2019s field? She can be that shameless? A widow and a coward working together, their relationship is unclear. She can shame herself, but she shouldn\u2019t let the Bai Family lose a face!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Good luckOld Lady Bai led Bai Dazhu, Mrs. Liu, and Bai Erzhu. The four of them went to Hu Changlin\u2019s house on the east side of the village. When the villagers saw this, they knew there will be a good show. So, they stopped working and followed.On the other side, Bai Zhi and Hu Feng arrived at Doctor Lu\u2019s house. Doctor Lu was tidying up the dried medicinal herbs in his courtyard. Most of the dried herbs were personally collected up by him. Because after drying, he can sell\u00a0them in the town. In this mountain village, doctors couldn\u2019t earn much money. So, if he won\u2019t sell some medicinal herbs, he wouldn\u2019t be able to support his family.\u201cLu Dafu, are you busy?\u201d Bai Zhi stood outside the yard and warmly smiled at Doctor Lu.When Doctor Lu looked up and saw that it was Bai Zhi and Hu Feng. He quickly got up and put down the basket in his hand. Then, he got up and asked: \u201cDid your niang\u2019s illness worsen?\u201dBai Zhi shook her head: \u201cNo, no, I have something to asked Lu Dafu.\u201dWhen Doctor Lu saw Bai Zhi\u2019s smile and the bag on her back. It didn\u2019t take\u00a0him long to understand what was happening. He smiled and waved his hand: \u201cCome on in, and say it.\u201dDoctor Lu pushed aside his basket and walked quickly to open the gate for the two people.But, when Bai Zhi entered the yard, he whispered: \u201cLu Dafu, let\u2019s go inside your house and talk.\u201dDoctor Lu was stunned. Was it something that can\u2019t be discussed in the courtyard? He can see that Bai Zhi\u2019s face has this mysterious looked. So, he got curious. Doctor Lu nodded and said:\u00a0\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go inside the house.\u201dDoctor Lu\u2019s house was not so big. It was not as big as the Bai Family\u2019s house, but very neat and clean.After entering the house, Bai Zhi closed the door with her own hand.\u201cWhat on earth did you bring for you to act so mysterious like this?\u201d Doctor Lu smiled and asked.Bai Zhi unloaded the bamboo bag on her back. Then, she took out the wild ginseng. She unwrapped the covered leaves and handed the ginseng directly to Doctor Lu\u2019s hands: \u201cLu Dafu, what do you think about this wild ginseng?\u201dWhen Doctor Lu heard it was a wild ginseng, he was excited and immediately hold the wild ginseng. He had dug several wild ginseng in the mountain, but most of them were small. However, this wild ginseng in his hand, not only looked very good but also very big.\u201cThis, this wild ginseng\u2019s size and appearance are at least 100 years old!\u201d Doctor Lu looked at the wild ginseng in his hand. He said it was almost 100 years, but more likely it was 1000 years old. He had seen such a big ginseng before. The pharmacy\u2019s owner was not willing to sell it for a few thousand silver coins.\u201cWhere did you get this from?\u201d Doctor Lu asked anxiously.Bai Zhi answered: \u201cToday, Hu Feng and I went to the Luoying Mountain. I was originally looking for Selaginella. But as a result, I accidentally found this wild ginseng and brought it back to the village.\u201dThere was still a little fresh soil left on the wild ginseng. The stems and leaves on the top of it were still green. It was indeed newly dug out.Doctor Lu looked envious: \u201cYou are very lucky ah. This was your first time on the Luoying mountain, but you dug out such a big treasure. I have been there many times. But, I only get ordinary medicines. I didn\u2019t see any big wild ginseng.\u201dBai Zhi smiled and looked at Hu Feng beside her. Then, she smiled and said: \u201cNot only me, I found it with Hu Feng. It is his good luck. Without him, I can\u2019t survive in there.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Checking the pulseDoctor Lu has been to Luoying Mountain many times. But each time, he only strolls outside the forest. He never dared to go into the deep part of it. He was very clear about the danger inside. So, such wild ginseng definitely can only be found in the deep part of the forest.Doctor\u00a0Lu then asked: \u201cWhat are you planning to do with this ginseng?\u201dBai Zhi replied: \u201cLu Dafu, I am here to ask you for help. We will bother you to help us sell this ginseng in the town. No matter how much you sell it, I will give you 10 silver coins.\u201d10 silver coins as a reward?Without question, Doctor Lu was so shocked. When he listened, Hu Feng also couldn\u2019t help but raised an eyebrow. The little girl was really generous. She can spit out the word 10 silver coins without worries.Doctor\u00a0Lu busily said: \u201cNo, no, how can that be? We are village folks. I will help you sell it, but you don\u2019t need to give me a reward, okay? I originally planned to sell medicines in the town tomorrow. I will also sell yours.\u201d This little girl\u2019s life was harsh, so how could he collect her hard earned money?Bai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cLu Dafu, I know your kindness. However, that is not only a reward but also what I feel inside my heart. You are a good person. I understand what inside a human\u2019s heart. I know business is business. I am planning to dig up some more stuff in the mountain. If I want to sell them, I can only rely on you. If you won\u2019t accept my reward, I will feel embarrassed again and again to trouble you.\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu was somewhat moved, but when he thought about the 10 silver coins. He still couldn\u2019t bear it: \u201cBut, it doesn\u2019t need to be so big.\u201dHu Feng, who has been silent for a long time, suddenly opened his mouth: \u201cYou bring the ginseng in the pharmacy in the town then ask for a price. Once you learned the price, you can increase the price for 10 more silver coins. Then, that is your share. How about that?\u201dDoctor Lu\u2019s eyes lit up, that was a good idea. In that way, he wouldn\u2019t feel like taking away the little girl\u2019s earnings.\u201cLet\u2019s do it like that. Zhi\u2019er, Hu Feng, you can rest assured. I will not let you down. Just wait and see, I will sell it at a good price.\u201dNow, everyone was happy.*Outside Doctor Lu\u2019s courtyard, Bai Zhi looked at Hu Feng and smiled: \u201cHey, your brain is quite active ah. You don\u2019t look\u00a0like a sick person at all.\u201dHu Feng glanced at her and said: \u201cI just lost my memory. I didn\u2019t lose my intelligence.\u201dSpeaking of memory loss, Hu Feng simply asked: \u201cWhen are you planning to treat me?\u201dWhen Bai Zhi saw his anxious face, she smiled deep inside her heart. She turned her head and looked around. When she learned no one was around, she reached out to him.\u201cGive it to me.\u201dHu Feng couldn\u2019t understand her: \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYour hand, don\u2019t you want me to treat you? If I won\u2019t check your pulse, how will I know if I can cure you?\u201d Bai Zhi raised an eyebrow. The sweat on her forehead slide to her eyebrow up to her cheek. Reflecting a crystal-like light.Hu Feng stared at her and listened.The two of them were standing in the middle of the road. Hu Feng stretched out his hand. Bai Zhi held his hand and put her other hand over his wrist. His pulse was steady and powerful. His physical condition was very good. But of course, it was impossible to check his brain over the pulse. When it comes to this case, this move of her was only a cover-up. She thinks he was an open-minded person anyway.Seeing that she had retracted her hand, Hu Feng busily asked: \u201cHow is it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: Who did this?Bai Zhi frowned and said: \u201cYou have blood clots in your brain. If we will not clear it, it will be very difficult to recover your memory.\u201dHu Feng asked: \u201cHow will you clear it?\u201dBai Zhi shrugged her shoulders: \u201cThere are two ways to clear it. But, one of them is not possible because of the lack of proper tools.\u201d\u201cThen, let\u2019s talk about the available method.\u201d Hu Feng began to be impatient. Is this little girl only playing with him?Bai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Just listen to me, the blood clots in your brain have stayed for a long time. It will not be easy to clear it. We can use silver needles to puncture a hole and clear the blood. Although it is a slow process, there will be no side effect. It will also not affect your daily life. Plus, you will take some blood circulating drugs to improve the effect.\u201dHu Feng didn\u2019t understand much what she was saying. He doesn\u2019t know if the little girl words were true or false. He could only raise an eyebrow: \u201cSo, I can be cured?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Bai Zhi answered without hesitation. As if it was only a trivial matter.Who knows why, but when he saw the confidence in her eyes, his doubt was dissolved. She was clearly only a stupid child, but why she gave her a deep sense of trust?He couldn\u2019t understand it, but he never wanted to understand it.He has no other way. He could only give it a try. This was not a bad idea anyway. Maybe, there will be a surprising end. So, why not try it, right?He wanted to ask, where a 12-year-old girl like her learned medicine. She didn\u2019t even go to school. So, how did she had such a skill?But in the end, he didn\u2019t ask. Maybe, that was her secret. Everyone has their own secret. Things that they don\u2019t like other people to know.\u201cZhi\u2019er, Hu Feng, why are you here? Go back to your house. Hu Changlin and Zhao Lan were surrounded by the Bai Family.\u201d Lu Pingan who just came back from the school saw the Bai Family in Hu Changlin\u2019s place. When he gets closed, Village Chief Li told him to go home quickly and call his father to treat Zhao Lan.What? The Bai Family find niang to cause trouble again?Bai Zhi took a stepped forward and looked at her surroundings. When she saw a wooden stick on the road, she crouched and took it. Then, she rushed to Hu Changlin\u2019s house.Hu Feng followed behind her and the two of them run all the way. There were few people left in front of the Hu Family\u2019s house. Two villagers who were familiar with Hu Changlin kept persuading him.\u201cOld Hu, you are now in this age. Why do you still mixed up yourself with the Bai Family? Is it true you have feelings for Zhao Lan?\u201dHu Changlin stared at the man\u2019s eyes and said: \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? Is I, Hu Changlin such a person? I was just helping the poor mother and child. The wind blew out their house yesterday. It was raining, but the Bai family, who has a black heart didn\u2019t let them enter the house. The mother and child were wounded. So, should I just watch them?\u201d\u201cWell, even if it was me, I will also help them. The Bai Family is getting more and more unreasonable. Do they want the mother and daughter die?\u201d\u201cJust let me go, I have to go and see Zhao Lan. My hand is still hurting, but my conscience was not eaten by the dogs. I cannot let her get hurt again.\u201d Hu Changlin pushed aside the person who was blocking his way. However, he didn\u2019t use too much force, but he felt so much pain.\u201cOld Hu, I\u2019m afraid your hand will be crippled. Don\u2019t go in there, just hurry and see Lu Dafu.\u201dAt this time, Bai Zhi and Hu Feng rushed in. When they saw this situation, not only Bai Zhi trembled in anger, but also Hu Feng, who was always calm. In anger, his face blacken while asking: \u201cWho did this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Broken handHu Changlin hasn\u2019t had time to speak, but the middle-aged man beside him opened up his mouth \u201cBai Dazhu did it. They were forcing Zhao Lan to go back. Zhao Lan said she will wait for Zhi\u2019er first, but they refused. They tried dragging her away. Old Hu went to stop them, but they hit him. The Bai Family are really daring.\u201dBai Zhi asked: \u201cWhat about my niang?\u201d\u201cYour niang was taken away by them.\u201dThe voice hasn\u2019t fallen, but Bai Zhi immediately turned around and went towards the Bai Family\u2019s house.When Hu Feng saw this, he threw away the farm tool and cloth bag in his hand on the ground and followed: \u201cDie, you wait here at home, I\u2019ll go and see.\u201dThere was a fire in his heart that couldn\u2019t be extinguished.At ordinary times, he and Hu Changlin doesn\u2019t seem to be so close. But, he knew very well what he was to Hu Changlin. His heart was very clear of it. In these past three years, Hu Changlin has treated him like his own son. He also regarded him as his loved one. So today, when the Bai Family went to their door and broke Hu Changlin\u2019s hand, how can he swallow this anger?Hu Feng\u2019s footsteps were very fast. He wanted to catch up with Bai Zhi. To be more precise, he doesn\u2019t want that little girl to fell in the hands of those villains. But, he was still one step late.The Bai Family\u2019s courtyard was very lively. The villagers were surrounding the yard.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t see the situation inside. He could only hear horrible noises. As he listened carefully, he hurriedly pulled open the crowd to go in front.Hu Feng\u00a0thought that the person who was being beaten miserably might be Bai Zhi or Zhao Lan. But, who would have thought, that the person being chased and beaten was a seven-foot-tall man?Bai Erzhu didn\u2019t expect Bai Zhi will dare to beat him, nor didn\u2019t expect her skills to be so savvy. After a few moments of sorrow, he ate a few losses. He wanted to reverse the situation, but Bai Zhi didn\u2019t give him a chance to fight back. He continued to scream and scream, calling his eldest brother\u2019s name to help him.Bai Erzhu was short and thin. When he was still young, he works less. So, his strength was not comparable to Bai Dazhu.Bai Dazhu brought Zhao Lan into the small wooden house in the backyard. When he heard his second brother screaming, he hurriedly came out and rush to the front yard. Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu also followed.Although Bai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu were always quarreling. In the end, they were brothers. So, when he saw such his tragic appearance, he couldn\u2019t help but get angry.When Old Lady Bai saw her son being beaten like a dog by Bai Zhi. And there were many people watching her son like a joke. She got so angry. She also rushed in the front yard to help.At this time, the situation suddenly reversed. The one-on-one fight\u00a0becomes a three-on-one fight.Bai Zhi can fight back against Bai Erzhu without worries. She was clever, so she can rush to him.But now, her strength gradually depleted. On the other hand, two helpers joined in. She was destined to eat a heavy loss.Bai Zhi quickly thinks of a solution inside her heart. But all she could do now was, hope for a good man to suddenly jump out and defend her.Seeing Old Lady Bai and Bai Dazhu\u2019s stick flying towards her, Bai Zhi tried to avoid them. But, she could only avoid the old lady\u2019s stick. She could no longer avoid Bai Dazhu\u2019s stick.However the next moment, she didn\u2019t hear any slamming sound, instead, she saw a man standing in front of her. His wide hand was grabbing Bai Dazhu\u2019s stick. Bai Dazhu was trying to take back his stick by force, but he couldn\u2019t pull it.*\u00a0Die\u00a0\u2013 FatherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Shouldn\u2019t have hurtMrs. Liu, who was watching the battle on the side, yelled at her husband: \u201cHey, look at this, the dead girl and the Kung Fu man, this young and old adulterer really has power ah!\u201dHu Feng frowned, his cold eyes moved toward Mrs. Liu, and then he asked: \u201cWho are you calling the young and old adulterer? Say it again clearly.\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu saw his cold gaze, her body couldn\u2019t help but tremble. Her scalp also couldn\u2019t help but get numb. There were a lot of words she wanted to say, but she couldn\u2019t dare to spit them out.Bai Dazhu glared at Hu Feng: \u201cWhat are you doing? How dare you come to my Bai Family\u2019s house and act wild?\u201dHu Feng turned away his cold eyes to Mrs. Liu and stared at Bai Dazhu. The sharpness of his eyes was very obvious. So, even Bai Dazhu who was a strong man couldn\u2019t help but have palpitations.\u201cWhat are you calculating? You did not only dare go to my Hu Family\u2019s house and acted wild, but also hurt my father. Say, which hand did you use to hurt him?\u201dBai Dazhu hasn\u2019t been hit yet, but he felt his arms were breaking\u2026 \u2026Bai Dazhu took a step back and hurriedly said: \u201cYou, why do you care which hand I used? Your father was shameless, he doesn\u2019t want to let go of Zhao Lan, so I hit him. What\u2019s wrong with that? If he didn\u2019t do that, will I use my hand?\u201dBai Dazhu was completely regretting it. When he was fighting with Hu Changlin, he didn\u2019t think too much about it. He just released his anger. Now that he thinks about it, he realized he was too impulsive. Hu Feng was not a vegetable. He heard that Hu Feng\u2019s know martial arts and could kill a cow in one blow. It\u2019s just, he doesn\u2019t know if it was true\u2026 \u2026When Bai Zhi heard Bai Dazhu\u2019s words, she was so angry that she rushed forward and pointed her finger at Bai Dazhu: \u201cYou fart, my Niang was chased away by your Bai Family. Yesterday, our house was blown by the storm, it was also heavily raining. My Niang was injured, but your Bai Family closed your house door and won\u2019t let us in. Because of helplessness, we went and stay on Hu Bo\u2019s small cabin with the advice of Village Chief Li. Everyone in the village knows that situation, but you don\u2019t? Do you think everyone has a dirty mind like you?\u201dOld Lady Bai was so angry. She pointed her finger at Bai Zhi and shouted:\u00a0\u201cWhat are you talking about? Who has a dirty mind ah? Why don\u2019t you say it again?!\u201dHu Feng didn\u2019t have much patience to argue with them. His eyes were always looking at Bai Zhuzhu: \u201cI will ask you again, which hand did you use to hurt him?\u201dBai Dazhu panicked. But in front of so many people, how could he admit it? He looked up and said: \u201cI used both of my hands, what about it? Huh?\u201dAs soon as\u00a0 Bai Dazhu\u2019s words fell, Hu Feng\u2019s figure plunged in\u00a0front of Bai Dazhu. But before Bai Dazhu could react, he heard a cracking sound. He felt pain in his right arm and then, in his left arm.Everyone was shocked. They didn\u2019t expect Hu Feng will interrupt both Bai Dazhu\u2019s hands.Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu rushed forward to fight Hu Feng. But, how can they be his opponent? They flew in the ground with just his fingers.Bai Zhi was very hooked on the show. On the other hand, Mrs. Zhang retreated with Bai Erzhu on the side.Old Lady Bai was sitting on the ground. When she couldn\u2019t get up, she began to wail and cry. All obscene words came out of her mouth. She was a typical poisonous woman, so everyone couldn\u2019t help but frown.\u201cVillage Chief Li is coming, let him pass.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Small Black HouseVillage Chief Li rushed in. Earlier, he went to Hu Changlin\u2019s house. He saw Zhao Lan was being taken away. He also saw Hu Changlin got injured. He was so angry and came here again.\u201cChief Li, you came. If you came a bit late, I\u2019m afraid we will all be killed. Our Bai Family will be destroyed.\u201d Old Lady Bai held Village Chief Li\u2019s sleeves and wipe her tears. She rubbed her eyes until there were no longer tears.Village Chief Li frowned and swept his eyes over the crowd in the yard, then asked:\u00a0\u201cWhat is going on?\u201dBai Dazhu almost fainted in pain. His hands were broken, but his mouth was not. So, he yelled out: \u201cIt\u2019s Hu Feng. This bastard breaks my hands. He didn\u2019t even let the women slide. If you came a bit late, he might even do something more terrible.\u201dVillage Chief Li didn\u2019t take his words seriously, he directly asked: \u201cWhat about Zhao Lan? Where is Zhao Lan?\u201dThere were some memories of the previous Bai Zhi inside her mind. Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi have no status in the Bai Family. They were often being punished. The heaviest punishment Bai Zhi had experience was being locked in the small black house. But of course, she will be beaten first and let her stay hungry.The small black house was in the backyard. It was a small room filled with dry woods, which can only accommodate a person curling up inside. A person cannot only stand up but also sat up. A little girl like her cannot even stretch out her legs, so what more Zhao Lan who was tall?Without any thought, Bai Zhi rushed into the big house and went straight to the backyard.There were several people standing in the backyard, Bai Dazhu\u2019s eldest son Bai Dabao, second son Bai Xiaofeng. And Bai Erzhu\u2019s eldest daughter Bai Zhenzhu, the second son Bai Fugui.Bai Dabao was 18 years old this year, his body built can be compared to his father, but he looked just like his mother. His face looks sharp and thin. He was sitting in front of the small black house. The chair was leaning against the wooden door. Stopping the person inside to come out.Bai Zhi could hear her mother\u2019s voice on the other side of the door.Bai Xiaofeng and Bai Fugui were standing in the corner and don\u2019t know what to do. Bai Zhenzhu was holding a fan and crouching on the side. When she saw Bai Zhi came into the backyard, she immediately shouted: \u201cHey! You still know how to come back! Is Hu Feng\u2019s bed much softer than our Bai Family\u2019s bed?\u201dBai Zhi has no intention to bicker with her. From her memory, this Bai Zhenzhu has always been hostile to her. She always directs her anger at her. So, it was not strange to hear such strange words in her mouth.Bai Zhi went straight in front of Bai Dabao, then said: \u201cOpen it, let her come out.\u201dBai Dabao looked at her with squinted eyes and indifferently: \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201dBai Zhi\u2019s little fist were clenching tightly. She was preparing to hit Bai Dabao\u2019s face, but she heard Village Chief Li\u2019s loud voice behind her back: \u201cIf you won\u2019t let the people come out, I will report all of you to the officials and tell them that you are trying to kill her.\u201dWhen Bai Dabao saw Village Chief Li, he dared not to say another word. He quickly got up and carried away the chair.Bai Zhi quickly opened the door and crouched over to help her mother, who was curling up her body to the side.Zhao Lan\u2019s waistband has long been disappeared. Her clothes have been torn to several pieces. The five fingerprints on her face were clearly visible. There were even blood marks and nail scratched.In just one look, it could be seen Zhao Lan\u2019s breathing was unstable. Her forehead was full of sweat. Her lips were both pale and dark in color.Bai Zhi trembled in anger. If it weren\u2019t for her mother holding her hand tightly, she will likely fly and kill all those bastards.Village Chief Li sighed: \u201cLet\u2019s go, Lu Dafu will be here soon.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: The adultererBai Zhi helped her mother to go to the front yard. Zhao Lan saw her daughter tightly sipping her mouth and not talking, but her face looked very ugly. So obviously, she was angry. Zhao Lan pulled out a smile and said: \u201cZier, Niang is fine, it\u2019s really nothing.\u201dBai Zhi is a doctor. So, although Zhao Lan said it was nothing, she could see the truth in just one glance. Zhao Lan really does have a tough personality, if it was other women, they had long fainted.Bai Zhi shook her head and replied: \u201cNiang, you don\u2019t need to speak, I understand.\u201dZhao Lan nodded her head and no longer said anything. Her hand was very painful, so she was sweating all over her body. She actually doesn\u2019t have the strength to talk again. She was just clenching her teeth to endure the pain. She doesn\u2019t want her daughter to get worried about her.Bai Zhi helped Zhao Lan to come to the front yard and looked for a chair for her to sit down.Bai Dazhu was shouting on the side, saying that he wanted to kill Hu Feng. He also said that he would report Hu Feng to the officials and let him go to the prison.Village Chief Li went close to him and looked at him from head to toe. Then, he asked: \u201cDazhu, you said Hu Feng break your hands?\u201dBai Dazhu yelled out loud: \u201cIf it isn\u2019t him, who else? How many people here had seen it? Can\u2019t he still deny it?\u201dHu Feng still looked calm and indifferent. Village Chief Li then asked: \u201cI didn\u2019t say Hu Feng was denying it. I\u2019m asking you, why did he break your hands?\u201dBai Dazhu naturally refused to tell the truth: \u201cDo you still need to ask? Obviously, it was for the adulterer pair, it was for Hu Changlin and Zhao Lan. Hu Feng and Bai Zhi are also a pair of young adulterers. Their head was only full of love.\u201dWhen Zhao Lan heard his words, she almost faint. She said with a trembling voice: \u201cYou, what nonsense are you saying? I and Hu Ge are clean. Zhier and Hu Feng are also not like what you are saying. You are only ruining our reputation.\u201dVillage Chief\u00a0Li also said: \u201cDazhu, you cannot just indiscriminate people and talk nonsense. You are saying they were adulterers, do you have any evidence? If you don\u2019t have evidence, you shouldn\u2019t just destroy a woman\u2019s reputation with your mouth. Women\u2019s reputations are comparable with their life.\u201dBai Dazhu was sore and hurting, he doesn\u2019t have any more energy to argue. Mrs. Liu, who was standing next to her husband, went on with the topic: \u201cEvidence? It\u2019s all very obvious. Haven\u2019t you noticed it yet? If Hu Changlin and Zhao Lan don\u2019t have that kind of relationship, why Hu Changlin always helping her? I figured it out yesterday, in this whole Huangtuo Village, there were hundreds of families, but why only Zhao Lan was invited to live in his house? She was even picked up by Hu Changlin himself, right? No one will believe anymore that they were not adulterers!\u201dVillage Chief Li said: \u201cI believe Zhao Lan is not that kind of person. Who in Huangtou Village doesn\u2019t know who she really was? If she was such a kind of a person, will she still stay in your Bai Family for more than 10 years? In these ten years, she has been working hard like a horse. She has been working all day long. But did she ever tried to leave with another man? All the villagers can see it, but why you can\u2019t?\u201dOld Lady Bai coldly interrupted: \u201cIt seems you also have a soft spot with Zhao Lan. What is she? Do you know everything about her? If she secretly sneaks out with some wild man, will you be able to know about it?\u201dBai Zhi was suffocating in anger, she pointed her finger at Old Lady Bai and said: \u201d You old woman if you dare to speak more nonsense, I will tear off your mouth.\u201dOld Lady Bai was shocked, so she busily said: \u201cDid you hear what she said? In front of your face, she dared to yell at this old woman. If you\u2019re not here, I don\u2019t know how she will deal with me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Double RepaymentVillage Chief Li was too lazy to care for the old lady, he turned away his head and saw Doctor Li squeezing himself from the crowd. Apparently, he seemed to be running all the way because he was sweating.\u201cYou came, hurry, hurry and look at Zhao Lan. Her hand seems to be swelling than yesterday.\u201dDoctor Lu gasped for breath and said: \u201cI just went to Hu Changlin\u2019s house. Old Hu\u2019s hand was also broken. I put some medicine and bandage his hand. So, I came late.\u201dHu Feng originally wanted to go back home and see his father. But after hearing Doctor Li\u2019s words, he turned back and stand beside Bai Zhi. Although he can\u2019t do anything now, staying was still better.Old Lady Bai rushed in front of Doctor Lu and said: \u201cLook at my son, Dazhu first. Zhao Lan is used to living\u00a0a hard life, so she won\u2019t die easily. My son Dazhu\u2019s injuries were heavier than her.\u201dDoctor Lu frowned and swept his eyes towards Bai Dazhu. He seems not having difficulty to breath: \u201cAnyone who had eyes can see who was seriously injured here. You old woman only know how to speak ill.\u201dOld Lady Bai was still distressed with the 2 silver coins she lost with Doctor Lu. But now he was blaming her for the lack of morality? Old Lady Bai\u2019s anger immediately burst out and shouted: \u201cWhy are you swearing? Do you think you are the only doctor here? You get out, we don\u2019t need you to give us a cure.\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu heard this, she was so scared that she quickly released her husband\u2019s arm and rushed forward to the old lady: \u201cNiang, what are you saying? Dazhu is seriously injured. If he won\u2019t get treatment, won\u2019t he become disabled?\u201dNaturally, Old Lady Bai doesn\u2019t want her eldest son to become disabled. But, how much would it cost her? Yesterday, Zhao Lan\u2019s hand was only checked and bandaged, but it already cost her 2 silvers. Where will she get 4 silvers? How many days she has to save money?Old Lady Bai swept her eyes to Hu Feng, then she immediately got an idea. She cried and said: \u201cVillage Chief, you also saw it. My son Dazhu was injured by Hu Feng. Now, Dazhu needs to be treated. You have to get the money for us, you have to give us justice.\u201dVillage Chief Li looked at Hu Feng: \u201cDid you hurt Bai Dazhu?\u201dHu Feng nodded his head and said with indifference: \u201cI hit him. He hurt my father first. I just made him paid for it. I didn\u2019t ask for money for my father\u2019s treatment, so we\u2019re only equal.\u201dVillage Chief Li only smiled inside his heart. He didn\u2019t show it on the surface of his face, he only looked at Old Lady Bai and said: \u201cWas Hu Changlin injured by your son?\u201dOld Lady Bai gritted her teeth and shook her head: \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t hurt Hu Changlin. He fell on his own.\u201dAt this time, the villagers who had witnessed the whole process with their own eyes shouted: \u201cThis old woman, you can speak without any conscience ah. At that time, we all saw the truth. Your Bai Dazhu beat old man Hu. Why are you denying it now?\u201dOld Lady Bai pointed her finger at the man and shouted: \u201cDo you want to die a thousand times? This is our family\u2019s business, so shut up your mouth! Why are you staying here? Get away from here, get out!\u201dThe man said calmly: \u201cSo many people have witnessed your family hurt Old Man Hu. How dare you deny it?\u201dOld Lady Bai\u2019s face become red and white, then from white to blue. No need to mention how exactly how she feels. Old Lady Bai straightens her back and said: \u201cYes, its true, Hu Changlin\u2019s hand was injured by my son Dazhu. Dazhu only injured one of his hand, but Hu Feng injured both of my son\u2019s hands. How about that?\u201dHu Feng\u2019s cold and sharp eyes swept slowly to Old Lady Bai, then he said word by word: \u201cIf people will not commit a crime on me, I will not commit a crime. But if people commit a crime on me, I\u2019ll make him pay double.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: She knows acupuncture?Hu Feng stared at Bai Dazhu and said: \u201cDouble, is very fair.\u201dVery fair?Old Lady Bai almost faint, Hu Feng\u2019s father only broke one hand, but her son had two broken hands, but he said it was very fair?While Old Lady Bai and Hu Feng were arguing, Doctor Lu was dragged to Zhao Lan by Bai Zhi. Although Doctor Lu\u2019s medical skills were ordinary, and he only knows common orthopedic first aid, he was very skillful due to years of practiced.When Doctor Lu checked Zhao Lan\u2019s hand, he couldn\u2019t help but whispered: \u201cDamn it, the fracture on her hand has been misaligned. That\u2019s why it was swelling like this. We need to re-align your bones.\u201dDoctor Lu looked at Zhao Lan, when he saw her pale face, he couldn\u2019t help but get worried: \u201cRe-aligning bones is very painful. Can you withstand it?\u201d\u00a0\u201cZhao Lan gently nodded: \u201cI\u2019m fine, just do it. I can stand it.\u201d She actually didn\u2019t know if she could stand the pain or not. Her vision was getting blurry. If she doesn\u2019t keep thinking that her daughter will get worried, she wouldn\u2019t keep biting her lips to stay conscious.Bai Zhi had treated a lot of patient with fracture or dislocated bones before. She knew the pain was not something that could be eaten by ordinary people.So, Bai Zhi whispered to Doctor Lu: \u201cLu Dafu, can you lend me the silver needles in your medicine box?\u201dDoctor Lu nodded his head: \u201cYes, but we can\u2019t use silver needles to treat her bones.\u201dBai Zhi simply said: \u201cCan you lend me some?\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu knows that this little girl near him was not an ordinary girl. She was capable enough. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be able to tell what was lacking in their ancestral treatment formula. She wouldn\u2019t be able to dig such amazing wild ginseng in the mountain, in her first attempt. These things were not simply luck.Doctor Lu didn\u2019t say another word, he simply turned back and took out a set of silver needles to\u00a0his medicine box, then handed them to Bai Zhi.Bai Zhi looked at the Bai Family who was still arguing with Hu Feng. She also looked at the nosy villagers. Then, she whispered to Doctor Lu: \u201cLu Dafu, help me block the scene, I don\u2019t want other people to see me.\u201dWhen Doctor Lu saw that Bai Zhi had taken out two silver needles, he was so shocked. Bai Zhi wanted to use those silver needles to Zhao Lan? But, does she understood acupuncture treatment?A 12-year-old girl not only knows medicine but also acupuncture treatment?Doctor Lu has a lot of curiosity in his heart. He wanted to see if Bai Zhi really knows acupuncture treatment. So, he stood in front of Zhao Lan.Zhao Lan was sitting in the chair, Bai Zhi was small, so she could fit herself in the middle. No one could see what she was doing.Doctor Lu saw it clearly, Bai Zhi inserted the slender silver needles directly to the Qu Chi, Tianfu, and Hegu acupuncture point. She twisted the needle a few times in a special way and pulled them out. After that, she inserted a needle to the lingxu point in Zhao Lan\u2019s chest.\u201cOkay, I will pull the needle again, after you finished re-aligning the bones.\u201dThe silver needle remains in the Lingxu point. The needle was trembling and jumping, together with Zhao Lan\u2019s breathing.Doctor\u00a0Lu was not proficient in acupuncture treatment. He couldn\u2019t understand what Bai Zhi did. He doesn\u2019t know what Zhao Lan felt after Bai Zhi finished.So, he asked: \u201cZhao Lan, how do you feel?\u201dZhao Lan\u2019s spirit was obviously much better. She smiled and happily said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel any pain. My hand doesn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201d Zhao Lan\u2019s smile didn\u2019t last long, her smile solidified the next moment: \u201cBut, why I can\u2019t feel my hand at all? Although it doesn\u2019t hurt, I can\u2019t move it? What is going on?\u201dBai Zhi whispered: \u201cNiang, it\u2019s okay, I just used the needle to temporarily seal your acupuncture points. It will help you relived the pain. After re-aligning, I will pull out the needle and everything will be alright like before.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who taught you?\u201d From the day her daughter died and came back to life, she seemed changed into a different person.Bai Zhi shook her head and said: \u201cNiang, now is not the time to discuss this. I will tell you later, let\u2019s cure your injuries first.\u201dDoctor Lu also woke up from the horror. Although his needling technique was not good, he had heard that some needling technique could lessen or temporarily alleviate the patient\u2019s pain. At the same time, it could create a better treatment condition.\u00a0And this advance needling technique was called acupuncture treatment.This kind of acupuncture treatment can only be heard in hearsay. Because not many people could do it.So, how can a 12-year-old child do this?\u201cLu Dafu, don\u2019t worry, just re-align my niang\u2019s bones.\u201d If only she will not get into trouble, she had cured her mother right now. Why would she wait until now, right?Doctor\u00a0Lu knew that it was inconvenient to ask questions now. So, he hurriedly moved his medicine box and started working.Doctor Lu was treating Zhao Lan on the side. While Old Lady Bai and the others were still arguing and screaming. But suddenly, they look towards Zhao Lan. Seeing Doctor Lu bandaging Zhao Lan\u2019s hand, Old Lady Bai rushed over and shouted: \u201cWho asked you to treat her? When did I say you can treat her?\u201dBai Zhi stepped forward and stand in front of Doctor Lu. In preparation, if the old lady suddenly went crazy and rushed over to do bad things to her mother.\u201cGrandmother, my niang was badly hurt like this. Isn\u2019t it necessary for her to be treated?\u201dOld Lady Bai coldly snorted: \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but I do know that I can\u2019t afford to waste money on your niang. I already spent 2 silver coins on her yesterday. So today, even if she died, I will not take out any money.\u201d\u201cGrandmother, my niang, whether she was hurt yesterday or today. If you won\u2019t give money for her treatment, I will immediately go the to town and report this case to the government officials. Yesterday, she was hurt by you and today she was hurt by First Uncle. Let\u2019s see how will the country\u2019s magistrate judge this case.\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai heard her words, she couldn\u2019t wait to beat Bai Zhi.But when Hu Feng saw it, he immediately reached out his hand and grab the old woman\u2019s arm, then said: \u201cWhat? You still want to hurt another innocent person?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu naturally wanted to help the old lady. But, she didn\u2019t dare to fight with Hu Feng, so she only used her mouth, shouting and screaming: \u201cLook, look at this, who said that little bitch was innocent? Our family ended up like this because of her. But, you were saying she was innocent? Who will believe that?\u201dHu Feng didn\u2019t show any care to Mrs. Liu\u2019s swearing mouth. His hand that was gripping the old lad\u2019s arm tighten. Then, he said: \u201cAs long as I am here, who dares to touch her will face me, Hu Feng. You can try it.\u201d\u00a0 Hu Feng eyes swept through the old lady, then to Mrs. Liu and Bai Dazhu, who was sitting on the ground. Bai Erzhu and Mrs. Zhang\u00a0didn\u2019t dare to come forward. Even Bai Dabao and his brother and cousins just continue watching the show.Hu Feng stood in front of Bai Zhi like a giant tree. Blocking the wind and rain that was blowing in front of her. Giving the petite girl a sense of belonging.After the tall figure stand in front of her, Bai Zhi felt a sense of security that she had never experienced before. Giving her off a wonderful feeling.When the atmosphere became tense, the screaming and shouting come to an end. Everyone was afraid to start another fight again. Because things were already bad. So, Village Chief Li quickly advised: \u201cOkay, okay, let\u2019s speak no further.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was not stupid. She knows she will not win. The matter yesterday haven\u2019t passed. If today\u2019s incident will be added, it will be trouble. Additionally, they were also involved in Hu Changlin\u2019s case.Although Bai Dazhu\u2019s hands were broken by Hu Feng, their family first injured Hu Changlin. If they went and complained to the government officials, they will definitely not be on their side.Coupled with Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi\u2019s condition, their Bai Family will definitely eat a big loss.\u201cHow we will decide in private?\u201d Old Lady Bai asked.Village Chief Li looked at the involved party and said: \u201cI have an idea. Your family injured Old Hu. Hu Feng injured Dazhu. You two pays each other cost of treatment so that no owes the other.\u201dOld Lady Bai was heartbroken, but it seems there was no other way. And it seems it was hard to swindle Hu Feng.Old Lady Bai was heartbroken, she wanted to smash Zhao Lan a thousand times. And so her eyes swept to the mother and daughter over and over again. She couldn\u2019t wait to minced their meat and use it to pay their debt.\u201cYou need to make a quick decision.\u201d Village Chief Li was impatient.Old Lady Bai nodded her head. She couldn\u2019t deny this incident anyway. If she knew things will become like this, she shouldn\u2019t have brought Bai Dazhu with her. This impulsiveness of her made her lose so much money in her entire life.Mrs.\u00a0Liu was about to pull Doctor Lu to treat Bai Dazhu, but she heard Doctor Lu said: \u201cI can give a cure, but we have to discuss the price first before I will give treatment.\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai heard this, she immediately held her forehead and shouted in pain due to a headache. Giving off a pitiful look.Doctor\u00a0Lu knew that this was the old lady routine to escape, so he was not affected. He immediately added: \u201cSince Old Hu\u2019s consultation was not something for you to pay, let\u2019s talk about Zhao Lan and Bai Dazhu\u2019s treatment.\u201dDoctor Lu look at Bai Dazhu\u2019s hands. When he learned his condition, he said: \u201cOne hand cost 2 silver coins. Zhao Lan has already been cured, Bai Dazhu needs two hands to be cured. All in all, it cost 6 silver coins.\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai heard the cost, she immediately jumped out of her feet. Her head was no longer aching, instead, her chest became stuffy. Old Lady Bai pointed her finger at Doctor Lu and shouted: \u201cWhat? 6 silver coins? Why don\u2019t you just rob our family? Do you think our Bai Family are incompetent fools?\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu shrugged his shoulders: \u201cI don\u2019t care about that. If you think you can\u2019t afford it. The medical museum is just a few miles away from the village. You can take your son in there to seek for a cure. Let\u2019s see how much it will cost you.\u201dOn the side, Village Chief Li suddenly said: \u201cOld Sun broke his leg last month. Lu Dafu happened to be out of the village. Old Sun was taken to the town by his grandson and spent 50 silver coins in there. You should also do the same.\u201dDoctor Lu opened his mouth again: \u201cNo matter what you decide for Dazhu, I don\u2019t care. But Zhao Lan now has been treated. It cost 2 silver coins, give that to me first.\u201dOld Lady Bai was so angry, but Mrs. Liu took her to the side and whispered: \u201cNiang, now is not the time to lose temper. Let\u2019s make him cure Dazhu first. After he finished, let just say we don\u2019t have money. What else can he do by then?\u201dIt was a good idea, so Old Lady Bai\u2019s eyes shine brightly. Why didn\u2019t she think of it before? Well now, she wanted to see who will cry in the end.Old Lady Bai\u2019s face change abruptly. And her originally bad temper disappeared. She went to Doctor Lu\u2019s side and said: \u201cIt\u2019s too late to go to the town now. I\u2019m afraid, we will fail to catch up with the medical museum. It\u2019s not good to let Dazhu suffer for the whole night, right? And Lu Dafu is already here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Six silver coinsDoctor Lu felt strange, why did the old lady suddenly change her mind? Although he has doubt, he didn\u2019t think much about it. Doctor Lu went to Bai Dazhu\u2019s side with his medicine box to bandage his hands. Every time Doctor Lu move his hand, Bai Dazhu screamed miserably. His tragic cries seem endless and echoed in the courtyard.Even if he died, Bai Zhi doesn\u2019t want to give him acupuncture treatment. He deserved this pain. This pain was the so-called his retribution. For interrupting Hu Changlin and Zhao Lan\u2019s hand.After the bandaging was finished, Bai Dazhu\u2019s screams gradually ended. His face was as white as a paper. His lips were bitten, so blood was oozing out.Doctor Lu ignored Bai Dazhu and packed up his things to the medicine box. Then, he turned around and asked the old lady for the money.Old Lady Bai started complaining about a headache, chest pain and shortness of breath. But, there was actually nothing wrong with her body.\u201cOld lady,\u00a0 just now, you said you\u2019re going to pay 6 silver coins. In front of the Village Chief, do you intend to write it as a debt?\u201d Doctor Lu raised an eyebrow and looked at the old lady coldly.Old Lady Bai\u2019s face redden, her voice become as small as the mosquito: \u201cWho, who said we will write it as a debt? It\u2019s just, we are tight in money right now. We can\u2019t get silvers.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same as a debt? You don\u2019t have money in your hands. You can\u2019t get money. You waited for me to finished Bai Dazhu\u2019s treatment first, before you said those words. Since when did I, Lu Zhangchun was wronged and bullied like this?\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai saw the changed in Doctor Lu\u2019s face, she hurried put\u00a0on a smile on her ugly face and said: \u201cLu Dafu, what are you saying? We are village folks in the same village. Our Bai ancestors lived in this village for a long time. Since when did we have an account to you?\u201dDoctor Lu then stretched out his palm: \u201cSince you don\u2019t have an account with me, give me the 6 silver coins. Nothing more or less.\u201dOld Lady Bai laughed a couple of times and said: \u201cTruth be told, the 2 silver coins that were handed to you yesterday was the bottom of our pocket. It is really impossible to bring out a money right now. How about this, you wait for two months, and when we got paid, we will pay you back. What do you think?\u201dDebt?\u00a0Ha Ha Ha!Doctor\u00a0Lu smiled and laughed: \u201cOld Lady, do you still remember? 3 years ago, Bai Xiaofeng got a cold. I gave him the medicines, you also said you will write it as a debt. That was a total of 7 silver coins, but did you pay me?\u201d3 years had passed, but the 7 silver coins were still unpaid. However, they were pretending like nothing happened.Not to mention, 6 silver coins? It will really be strange if the old lady pays.Old Lad Bai knocked her head and said: \u201cLook at my memory, I thought I already paid that. I didn\u2019t remember it at all. Why didn\u2019t you remind me?\u201dYes, this old lady will really blame him to fight back.\u201cI am not here to make you pay for your old debt. I am here to ask for the 6 silver coins. Take it out and pay me.\u201dOld Lady Bai turned her head and look at Village Chief Li: \u201cVillage Chief, this thing is really troublesome. I\u2019m not the one who invited Lu Dafu, but he was asking for 6 silver coins. That amount is not small, where can I get that amount in just a short period of time?\u201dVillage Chief\u00a0Li doesn\u2019t know if the old lady was telling the truth or not. But at the moment, he knew that this old lady will not give the money.Village Chief\u00a0Li think for a moment and got an idea. Then, he opened his mouth and said: \u201cSince you can\u2019t pay right now, then let\u2019s write an IOU with the agreed time of payment, how about that?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: IOUOld Lady Bai thought that IOU was nothing but a piece of paper. She would admit it if she wants to, but she won\u2019t admit it if she doesn\u2019t want. No matter what, it doesn\u2019t matter, so she agreed.Therefore, when Doctor Lu wrote the IOU, she didn\u2019t look at it, nor let Bai Xiaofeng read it for them. She directly pressed her fingerprint on it, because she doesn\u2019t care.Doctor Lu dried up the ink on the paper and said: \u201cNow we made an agreement. You will give the money to me in the 8th of the next month. The 9th day is the day I will settle the payment in the pharmacy in the town. If you will not give me the money. I can\u2019t clear the account to the others. I will have to pay it myself. You have to hurry and save money.\u201dOld Lady Bai casually said: \u201cIf I have the money on the 8th next month, I will naturally give it to you. But if not, I can\u2019t help you.\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu raised the IOU in his hand: \u201cThat can\u2019t be done, you owe me the money, so naturally you have to pay. If you will not give me the money on the agreed date, then I will take this IOU to the country\u2019s magistrate to decide. This old man will take your field or your house as a payment. So, don\u2019t blame me by then.\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai heard his words, her face drastically changed: \u201cWhat did you say? You want to take our field or house as a payment? Can the country\u2019s magistrate do such thing? You are only bluffing! Do you think this old lady hasn\u2019t seen much in this world?\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu was too lazy to talk nonsense to the old lady, he raised and waved the IOU, then said: \u201cThe black and white of this case are clearly stated in here. If you\u2019re\u00a0still planning to dilly dally around every day, I\u2019m afraid you can no longer do so.Old Lady Bai wanted to take back the IOU, but Doctor Lu stuffed it inside his clothes. Then, he took his medicine box and turned to leave. Even if the old lady wants to jump in front of Doctor Lu and beat him, she couldn\u2019t do it. Doctor Lu was not Zhao Lan or Bai Zhi. She couldn\u2019t dare to hurt him.Old Lady Bai turned around and stopped Village Chief Li, who was about to leave: \u201cVillage Chief, is what he said true? If I don\u2019t have money on the 8th of the next month, he can talk about it to the country\u2019s magistrate? Can the country\u2019s magistrate manage this kind of thing?\u201dVillage Chief Li frowned his eyebrows and looked at the old lady. He felt some gloom in his heart: \u201cIn the eyes of the country\u2019s magistrate, there is no big or small case in his people\u2019s affairs. So naturally, he can manage it. Do you think this is just a child\u2019s play?\u00a0Do you think you can just question the law of Chu Country?\u201dOld Lady Bai became anxious: \u201cThat, how can that be? It\u2019s just, I, I don\u2019t know how to read. I didn\u2019t read the words he wrote. I didn\u2019t even look at it. He cheated on me. I will not recognize it.\u201dVillage Chief Li said: \u201cYou,\u00a0recognizing it is not my business, so I can\u2019t tell you anything. When the time comes, and Lu Dafu sue you. You can tell to the country\u2019s magistrate your side.\u201d\u201cThen, will the county\u2019s magistrate listen to me? Will he stand on my side?\u201d Old Lady Bai looked worried and confused.Village Chief Li shrugged his shoulders: \u201d How can I know how the country\u2019s magistrate will decide? When you go there, you will naturally know the answer.\u201dAfter he finished, Village Chief Li was too lazy to talk nonsense to the old lady again. He walked over to Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi\u2019s side, then said: \u201cSince Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi has been forcefully picked up by you, you have to treat them well. If something bad happened to them again because of you, don\u2019t blame me for doing things my way. I will no longer give you a face.\u201d Village Chief Li waved his sleeve and left.Old Lady Bai stamped her feet and spit at Village Chief Li\u2019s direction. Then, she muttered a few hateful words.When she just turned her head, she saw Hu Feng\u2019s cold eyes staring at her.Hu Feng looked at Bai Zhi and asked: \u201cDo you want to go back with me?\u201dBai Zhi has been thinking about this question before. Should she and her mother go back to the Hu Family? They don\u2019t have any place to sleep in this Bai Family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Irrefutable evidenceBut today, if they go with Hu Feng, won\u2019t the Bai Family keep calling them adulterer?Moreover, she doesn\u2019t want to timidly come and go again and again. She wanted to draw a clear line with the Bai Family and then go.To walk away clear without any worries.Bai Zhi shook her head and said to Hu Feng: \u201cHu Feng, thank you for your kindness. Bai Family is our home. It was windy and raining yesterday, so we had to go and stay at your place. I will tidy up the cabin, so people could stay there anytime.\u201dHu Feng was not worried about that. He was worried about that if they stay, the Bai Family will use their ruthless hands against them again. Things will be bad more by then.Bai Zhi had seen his concerns, so she smiled and said: \u201cRest assured, I am not easy to bully, people who died once, has nothing more to fear, right? If anyone wants us dead, I will make sure to bring them together in our funeral.\u201d When she said those words, Bai Zhi deliberately raised her voice. Listening to this, Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu\u2019s heart skip a beat. Remembering the scene yesterday, she died once and resurrected, so they felt cold in their back.Hu Feng nodded his head and swept his eyes over the collapsed wooden house. Thinking about the arguments earlier, he estimated that no one will help her to repair their house. And so, he pulled up his sleeves and said: \u201cI will help you repair.\u201dBai Zhi welcomes Hu Feng\u2019s help. Their house was blown away by the wind. And now, it can be seen that their wooden house was more broken than it seems. She was not familiar with this kind of work. Zhao Lan has a broken hand. The Bai Family was off no use, she actually worried about this matter. Since Hu Feng was willing to help, she will naturally accept it.Old Lady Bai was still distressed with the 6 silver coins. For her, Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi were like needles that stabbed her eyes. If Zhao Lan was not injured, and if this dead girl has no support of Hu Feng. She really wanted to beat them to death.When Old Lady Bai turned her head, she saw\u00a0Bai Xiaofeng standing at the door. She hurriedly pulled him inside the house and said: \u201cXiaofeng, you had read many books, so you know a lot of things than grandmother. So you tell grandma, is what they said is true? If grandma didn\u2019t give the 6 silver coins, Lu Dafu can really complain to the country\u2019s magistrate?\u201dBai Xiaofeng was thirteen years old this year. He went to school for two years now. If he passed the government exam, he will become a big official. So, he always acted like the master of this house. He never put anyone to his eyes, even his grandmother who loves him the most.\u201cGrandmother, you are really like an old lake, the IOU has been set, you also pressed your fingerprints. That is an irrefutable evidence. I am just standing in the door, but you didn\u2019t ask me to read it, you just directly pressed your fingerprints. If he really uses the 6 silver coins to take away our house as a compensation, what else can we do?\u201dOld Lad Bai trembled in anger: \u201cIf that Lu Zhangchun really dares to do that, I will risk my life and fight with him.\u201dBai Xiaofeng shook his head and sighed: \u201cGrandmother, it\u2019s still better for you to prepare the 6 silver coins. If our Bai Family went to the country\u2019s magistrate, it will affect our face, my examination might also get affected by this in the future.\u201dRegarding this case, for Old Lady Bai, her grandson was her treasure, but the silver coins were her life!Yesterday, in order to treat Zhao Lan, she had spent 2 silver coins. But now, they were asking her to spend 6 silver coins? What was the difference of\u00a0it than taking her life away?Bai Dabao came over and said to the old lady: \u201cGrandma, I wanted to get married this month, don\u2019t spend all the money that you said was for me. I don\u2019t want to be a bachelor my whole life.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Selling DaughterMrs. Liu supported Bai Dazhu and entered the house. When she heard her son\u2019s words, she immediately gritted her teeth and said: \u201cOriginally, if we successfully sold that little bitch, Bai Zhi, Dabao can now get married. But who knows, we did not only failed but also lose so much money.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Zhang also took her husband into the house. And saw her daughter, Bai Zhenzhu, leaning against the door and staring in the place, where Hu Feng was repairing the collapsed wooden house.Bai Zhenzhu was blushing while staring at Hu Feng. She didn\u2019t even blink.She rarely go outside, so she could only hear rumors about Hu Feng. She never had actually seen him in person. She thought he was a rough young man. But today, unexpectedly, she saw that he was a strong beautiful man. In just one glance, her soul was sucked away.She was 15 years old this year. At this age, she was ready to get married. She was introduced to young boys of several families, but she never put them in her eyes. Those young boys were either poor or ugly. Compared to Hu Feng, those young boys can\u2019t even worth his foot.Mrs.\u00a0Zhang stretched out her hand and hold her daughter\u2019s arm, then whispered: \u201cWhat are you staring at? Do you want to shame yourself? Go back to our room right now.\u201d\u2018Bai Zhenzhu blushed and ran back to their room.This scene happened to caught Mrs. Liu\u2019s eyes. So, how could she let go of this ridiculous opportunity to sneak back at Mrs. Zhang?\u201cSister-in-law, Zhu\u2019er is young and in the spring of love. So when she saw a good-looking man, her heart naturally can\u2019t stop staring. This is normal, you shouldn\u2019t yell at the child.\u201dMrs. Zhang\u2019s face immediately changed in expression, but then she calmed down herself: \u201cSister-in-law, I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying. Zhu\u2019er is staring at Bai Zhi. So, how did the topic become spring of love? Again, I don\u2019t agree with your words, what young girl can\u2019t stop staring at a good looking man? I have never experienced such a thing. Zhu\u2019er is still young, so naturally, she also cannot understand this. But in from sister-in-law\u2019s mouth, you seemed very experienced.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu didn\u2019t expect that the dirty pot of water she has poured to Mrs. Zhang, will be poured back to her own body\u2026 \u2026\u201cGood, good, can\u2019t you talk less? At this moment, you still have time to bicker?\u201d Old Lady Bai was really hurting this time. Her brain hurts. She couldn\u2019t help but tremble in anger when she thinks of the 6 silver coins.Bai Dazhu also stared at Mrs. Liu. He released a heavy breath and said: \u201cIf you can talk this much, why don\u2019t you just give niang an idea to pass this problem.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu replied: \u201cI already have an idea of how to get money. But if you didn\u2019t start a fight with Hu Changlin, will we lose 6 silver coins to Lu Dafu?\u201d \u201cWhen Old Lady Bai heard her words, she immediately asked: \u201cWhat do you have in mind? Let\u2019s talk about it.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu\u2019s lips curved into a smile: \u201cIt\u2019s actually very easy. It\u2019s the same to what we did before. Let\u2019s sell that little bitch, Bai Zhi, to some family. I\u2019ve heard, in the Baiyang Village five miles away from here, there were more men but fewer women. That village was full yin and had bad a feng shui. Many young girls are not willing to marry in there, so men in that village are desperately working hard to have money to get a wife. And now, their gift money to get a wife is worth 20 silver coins. 20 silver coins minus 6 silver coins, we can still have 14 silver coins, right? In Huangtuo Village, to get a wife, 10 silver coins are enough, we can still save 4 silver coins.\u201dThe Bai family inside the house was very busy making their calculations. So, they didn\u2019t know Bai Zhi was standing outside and heard all their conversation clearly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: Looking for the eggsThey want to sell her to get money and then let her son marry a wife.Bai Zhi turned and left, but she bumped into someone\u2019s chest. Bai Zhi stepped back and touched her nose. She frowned and look at that someone: \u201cWhy do you always walked like a ghost?\u201dHu Feng raised an eyebrow: \u201cEavesdropping on someone\u2019s plan to sell you? How does it feel?\u201dBai Zhi softly sneered and walked towards the newly repaired wooden house: \u201cNothing. Even if they wanted to sell me, its still depends whether I will agree or not. I am not the former Bai Zhi, who always let herself be bullied and never resist. As you said, If people don\u2019t commit crimes on me, I won\u2019t commit crimes. But if they do, I\u2019ll make them pay double. If they make me feel bad, I\u2019ll make them feel bad. Let\u2019s see who can do\u00a0much better.\u201dSeeing the little girl\u2019s face brightly shine, she talked as if it was very easy to fight with the Bai Family. However, he has no doubt about it. In his eyes, this little girl, who has a bright face, was arrogant but full of confidence. If she was confident, she can handle everything. And he believes in her.\u201cThe house has been repaired. I will go back first.\u201d Hu Feng strode away as if he was in a hurry.\u201cNiang, you take a break first, I will clean up the house.\u201d Although the house was repaired, their room was still very messy. There was still dirty water on the ground from the rain last night, and the hay on the bed was soaked in the water. Fortunately, their\u00a0house was not big, and so she had cleared them up quickly.However, she hasn\u2019t completely finished cleaning the house yet, when Mrs. Liu and Old Lady Bai came out from the big house and walked towards Zhao Lan, who was still sitting in the courtyard: \u201cHey, give me the key to the cabin house of Hu Family.\u201dThe key was indeed with Zhao Lan, but this thing didn\u2019t belong to the Bai Family. So naturally, she will not hand it over.\u201cWhat do you want to do with the key?\u201d Zhao Lan asked.Old Lady Bai answered: \u201cWhat do I want to do? You hurt your hand, Zhi\u2019er doesn\u2019t have time to get your clothes and quilt. Don\u2019t you feel guilty?\u201d Before the fight start, they got caught up with Hu Changlin. They didn\u2019t get a chance to go to the cabin. The eggs that Yingzi\u2019s parents had sent must still be hidden in there.Zhao Lan didn\u2019t know what they were thinking, but suddenly, they said that they would help her to take their things? This was not their usual style of action. So naturally, she doubted their intentions. She didn\u2019t dare to hand over the key easily.\u201cNo, Zhi\u2019er will finished soon, I\u2019ll go with her after.\u201dMrs. Liu glared at Zhao Lan and shouted: \u201cYou! You still wanted to go and pick things up yourself? I\u2019m afraid that picking up things was not really your intention, you only want to see your old lover again, right?\u201dZhao Lan trembled in anger, she pointed her finger at Mrs. Liu and said: \u201cYou, don\u2019t spit nonsense. Hu Dage and I don\u2019t have that kind of relationship. You can wrong me, but don\u2019t taint Hu Dage\u2019s reputation.\u201d\u201cLook what you are saying, that is also what Hu Changlin said. You both mutually supporting each other, but there\u2019s nothing going on with you? Who will believe that?\u201dBai Zhi, who was in the next room heard Mrs. Liu\u2019s words clearly. She knew that Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu were lazy people. Everything must be done by someone else. They never did any job. But now, they volunteered to help them get their clothes and quilt? That wasabsolutely impossible.Remembering the eggs that Yingzi\u2019s mother gave this morning. Yingzi\u2019s mother came to the Bai Family first, and when Yingzi\u2019s mother learned that she and her mother were gone, they went to the Hu Family\u2019s house. Obviously, Old Lady Bai had a glimpsed of this basket. They want to look for the eggs and confiscate it.Once confiscated, their things has nothing to do with them. With Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu\u2019s character, even if those eggs were stinky, it was still impossible for her and her mother to\u00a0eat any eggs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: If you won\u2019t do this the easy way, then we\u2019ll do it the hard wayFortunately, in the morning, before they left, they placed the eggs in Hu Changlin\u2019s house. So, even if they went to the cabin, they wouldn\u2019t be able to find even half of an eggshell.Bai Zhi walked out of the wooden house and smiled at Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu: \u201cGrandmother, Aunt, you are all very busy people. If we ask you to help us, how funny would that be?\u201dNow, whenever the old lady sees Bai Zhi, she was getting flustered. Especially, when she sees her smiling, her heart felt an inexplicable disgust and fear. She can\u2019t look at Bai Zhi\u2019s eyes directly, so she only waved her hand: \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, if you won\u2019t do this the easy way, then we\u2019ll do it the hard way. Just give us the key, how can our Bai Family\u2019s things be\u00a0left in someone else\u2019s home? If one or two went missing, won\u2019t we need to spend money again?\u201dAt this moment, Old Lady Bai couldn\u2019t say that Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan\u2019s clothes were not fit and complete. At first glance, people could tell that they were only worn out clothes of Bai Family that they could no longer wear. So, they were given to the mother and child.Bai Zhi then said to Zhao Lan: \u201cNiang, since Grandmother and Aunt are free, let them go and get our things. I am still busy here, your hand is injured, let\u2019s just trouble them this time.\u201dZhao Lan still couldn\u2019t understand what was going on, but because her daughter said so, she must have her own reason, so she no longer says anything. She took out the key and handed it to Mrs. Liu.Mrs. Liu took the key, without saying anything. Then, she and the old lady hurriedly went to Hu Changlin\u2019s cabin.Zhao Lan pulled Bai Zhi and asked: \u201cWhat is going on?\u201dBai Zhi came closer and whispered: \u201cThey were going to get the eggs that Yingzi\u2019s niang sent this morning. Let them turn upside down the cabin. There is nothing in there anyway.\u201dZhao Lan suddenly realized things, so there was a trace of a ridiculous smile on her face: \u201cIt seems they were destined to be disappointed and just return.\u201dBai Zhi helped Zhao Lan get inside the house. Their house now has been cleaned up. She put new dry hay on the side and covered them with two old clean clothes.\u201cNiang, you sit first, I\u2019ll go and get you water to wash your face.\u201d Bai Zhi said, but then she found out that there was no pot in the house. The only basin they could use was still in the cabin.When Zhao Lan saw her daughter\u2019s gloomy face, she busily said: \u201cIf there is no basin, just take a towel cloth and let\u2019s use it to wipe my face.\u201dBai Zhi didn\u2019t speak, she only took a towel cloth and went outside. Bai Zhi tightly clenched the towel cloth in her hand, her anger spread all over her body. She couldn\u2019t imagine how the former Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan, lived miserably in that old wooden house.While holding the towel, she went directly to the big house. There was a tank in the backyard of the big house. This water tank was always full of water. This water tank and all the other choirs were Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan\u2019s responsibility. Year after year, the Bai Family stop from working. As if it was only natural for the mother and child to work for them.Bai Zhi went straight to the tank in the backyard. The lid of the water tank was not yet opened. But suddenly, she heard Bai Xiaofeng\u2019s voice towards the small shed in the backyard: \u201cBai Zhi, come here and grind me some ink.\u201dBai Xiaofeng always finished his homework in this small shed every day. Their room was dim. So in order to save money, Old Lady Bai let Bai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu build up a small shed in this backyard. And then, they put a wide wooden table for Bai\u00a0Xiaofeng to use when he studied.Bai Zhi glanced at Bai Xiaofeng and ignored him. She opened the water tank and scoop a water from the inside. She soaked the towel cloth and twisted it dry in her hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: Bai Zhenzhu\u201cHey, dead girl, am I not talking to you? Are you deaf?\u201d Bai Xiaofeng angrily said.Bai Zhi put back the water tank lid and turned her head to look at Bai Xiaofeng, who was ferociously staring at her, then said: \u201cWhen reading and practicing calligraphy, you must have a peaceful mind. If I grind you an ink, you won\u2019t be able to concentrate. In order not to delay your study, it\u2019s better not to bother you.\u201dWhen she finished, Bai Zhi left. She was too lazy to pay attention to Bai Xiaofeng, who keeps screaming behind her. Inside the big house, Bai Zhi met Bai Zhenzhu, who was coming out of the room. Bai Zhenzhu stared at her eyes as if she owed her 500 silver coins.However, Bai Zhi was now worried about Zhao Lan, so she was not in the mood to fight with this girl. So before Bai Zhenzhi could attack her, Bai Zhi left the big house.After returning to the wooden house, Bai Zhi asked Zhao Lan: \u201cNiang, why do Bai Zhenzhu looked at me with cannibalistic eyes? When did I offend her?\u201dSpeaking of this, Zhao Lan couldn\u2019t help but smile: \u201cZhenzhu hates you since she was young, not because you offended her, but because you look better than her. Especially, when you two stood together, every guy stared at you more. She was jealous of you. She tried scratching your face several times. Fortunately, I always found out. Otherwise, your face must have been destroyed by her hands now.\u201dShe was going to scratch someone else\u2019s face, just because that someone looks better than her face? If this world has a lot of beautiful women, what will happen? Will she scratch all those beautiful faces?Seeing Bai Zhi suddenly smile, Zhao Lan couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d\u201cI am smiling, because I don\u2019t know who\u2019s the lucky guy who will marry a girl like Bai Zhenzhu. That event must be very exciting.\u201d Bai Zhi was overjoyed. In this world, there was no TV, computer or mobile phone. So if she wants to have fun, she can only use her imagination.Zhao Lan also smiled for a while, and then suddenly said: \u201cOkay, stop thinking about these useless things. Didn\u2019t you say that you want to separate from the family? But, I\u2019m afraid, they will not let us go easily.\u201dBai Zhi smiled with pride and said: \u201cI already think of a solution. Just wait and see. By then, they will be so anxious to part with us and will never force us to stay.\u201dSeeing her daughter so confident, Zhao Lan was relieved. Now, her daughter has become her strength. If she said there is a way, then there must be a solution.\u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d Zhao Lan asked.Bai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do anything. Just take a rest at home and treat yourself like a paralyzed person. Have a good time and just open your mouth when you are eating.\u201dZhao Lan\u2019s eyes lit up and immediately understood: \u201cI understand, this is a good idea. The Bai Family took me back to let me continue working like a horse. But if I become a waste, they will naturally abandon me.\u201d\u201cYes, this is part of the plan. You only need to cooperate with this part. You don\u2019t need to worry about anything else.\u201d She had seen it, in this family, Bai Xiaofeng has the highest status in the family. If she starts on him, will she still need to worry about other things?*At this time, Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu\u2019s screams sounded from the outside. Their scolding words were very ugly. It was almost possible to dig up Zhao Lan\u2019s ancestor\u2019s grave.For this kind of scolding, Zhao Lan has long been used to it, so she was numb. She only said to Bai Zhi: \u201cThey didn\u2019t find the eggs. They were definitely angry, they will look for us to vent their anger.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Eggs are not foundBai Zhi looked towards the wooden stick in the corner of the house and smiled, then said: \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019d like to see, who will dare to mess with me.\u201dHearing the footsteps getting closer, Bai Zhi got up and picked up the stick, then stood in front of the bed. Waiting for the two evil women get crazy and hurt her.Old Lady Bai kicked opened the door and fiercely stared at Bai Zhi, then she sharply asked: \u201cDead girl, you also now know how to hide things ah. Say it, where on earth did you\u00a0 hide the eggs that Yingzi\u2019s niang gave you?\u201dBai Zhi stared back coldly and also raised her voice: \u201cGrandmother, what are you saying? What eggs? Why I didn\u2019t know this?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu answered back immediately: \u201cYou, don\u2019t talk nonsense. Early this morning, Yingzi\u2019s niang came looking for you. She was carrying a basket of eggs in her hand. Do you still dare to say you didn\u2019t hide things?\u201dBai Zhi sneered: \u201cDid Aunt Xu, said that the basket of eggs was for me?\u201dMrs. Liu almost choked, her voice dropped by three points: \u201cNo, but it\u2019s definitely for you. Don\u2019t think that we didn\u2019t know you saved her daughter.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so sure? Have you heard or seen it? You\u2019ve searched the cabin, but did you find it?\u201dMrs. Liu busily replied: \u201cYou must have hidden it. You want to eat the eggs alone. Don\u2019t forget, you\u2019re still a member of the Bai Family. All thing should be shared, you mustn\u2019t hide private belongings.\u201dBai Zhi really wants to throw away the wooden stick in her hand and applaud Mrs. Liu: \u201cWhat First Aunt said is correct. All things must be shared fair and square. But, why is First Aunt only cooking eggs for her son and not for me? When our family has\u00a0broth soup, did you leave a bowl for me and my niang? When First Aunt bought a new fabric clothing, did you cut off a part for me and my niang?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu wanted to refute, but Bai Zhi immediately followed up: \u201cWhen my niang went to work in the field, did First Aunt go with her? You are a woman, my niang is also a woman. But, why do you think you are more precious than my niang and can\u2019t work in the field?\u201dMrs. Liu didn\u2019t expect that not only this dead girl, Bai Zhi learned to hit people, but also learned to speak poisonous words. This time, she was really speechless.Old Lady Bai was too lazy to talk to Bai Zhi. Right now, all she wanted to know was where was the basket of eggs had gone to. And whether she could find it and take it back.\u201cStop talking this useless things, tell me, where did you hide the eggs?\u201d Old Lady Bai angrily shouted.If it was the former Bai Zhi, seeing the old lady as angry as this can make her tremble in fear. But now, Bai Zhi is not the former Bai Zhi.Bai Zhi took two stepped forward with the wooden stick and slammed the wooden stick on the ground. Her atmosphere looked calm, but her eyes looked very scary. Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu couldn\u2019t help but took two stepped backward.\u201cI said there is no egg. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can go and find it yourself. I won\u2019t stop you. But if your planning to use this issue to bully my niang, I, Bai Zhi will swear. From today onwards, whoever bullies my niang, no matter who is it, I will not let that person go. Even if I die, I\u2019ll definitely make sure that I will pull that person together in my grave. Do you understand?\u201dOld Lady Bai grew up to this age, but she was never threatened, nor get panicked and angered like this. Old Lady Bai pointed her finger at Bai Zhi while shivering tremendously. Even her voice was also trembling: \u201cYou, you, you dare to go against us?\u201d\u201cOn the contrary, I am just telling you what I feel deep inside my heart. You can listen to it or do you as you like.\u201d Bai Zhi looked at Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu\u2019s pale face. Traces of arrogance keeps lingering around her body, which the former Bai Zhi never had.Aunt Xu \u2013 Yingzhi\u2019s motherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Not allowed to eat even a pieceWhen Bai Zhi saw that the two evil women came back, but not carrying anything in their hands, she asked: \u201cWhat about our clothes and quilt?\u201dMrs. Liu pulled Old Lady Bai to go out. She had eaten a big loss to Bai Zhi before with the use of a wooden stick. Now, she still felt in pain all over her body. So seeing the wooden stick on Bai Zhi\u2019s hand, she couldn\u2019t help but get panic.From afar, Mrs. Liu spit out some words: \u201cDon\u2019t you have your own hands? If you really don\u2019t have a time, why don\u2019t you ask your old lover to send over your things? Why are you asking us for help? You think you are so beautiful?\u201dBai Zhi followed them out of the wooden house, she was readying herself to speak a few words, but she saw Hu Feng carrying a quilt packed with their things in one hand and a large bowl to his other hand.\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d Bai Zhi stopped paying attention to Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu, and asked Hu Feng, who was coming over to her.\u201cWe didn\u2019t cook the rabbit, we cook the pheasant first.\u00a0Die\u00a0ask me to send you a bowl.\u201d Hu Feng then mentioned the quilt in his hand: \u201cI also brought your things.\u201dOld Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu stared at the big bowl. The big bowl was filled with aromatic oil of chicken meat.\u00a0The smell immediately rushed in their nose, so the two of them couldn\u2019t help but swallowed their saliva at the same time. The two of them could no longer remember the time they had eaten meat, let alone chicken meat. The hen in their house was specifically used for laying eggs.Old Lady Bai rushed Mrs. Liu to make a move. Mrs. Liu was obviously willing, so she walked forward to Hu Feng and smiled. She reached out her hands, trying to take the bowl from Hu Feng\u2019s hand: \u201cOh, Hu Dage is really polite. He even sends us a big bowl of chicken. How nice of him.\u201dMrs. Liu sounds very embarrassed, but her hands were not, she even went to pick up the bowl first.Hu Feng raised the bowl in his hand and coldly looked at Mrs. Liu, then said: \u201cThis is for Zhi\u2019er and Aunt Zhao, this is not for you.\u201d After that, he walked straight to the wooden house with the bowl and quilt.Bai Zhi was laughing inside her heart, he was clear about Hu Feng\u2019s intentions.\u201cYou dead girl, you are not allowed to eat that chicken. Once Hu Feng left, you must quickly bring that chicken soup to this old lady inside the big house. Your not allowed to eat even a piece. If one piece is missing, I will tear off your skin.\u201d Old Lady Bai pointed at Bai Zhi\u2019s nose and cursed.Her baby grandson was still growing up and studying hard. So naturally, every good thing must be given to him. But of course, with the large size of Bai Family, can they still share some to this dead girl?Bai Zhi sneered and said: \u201cOkay, you just wait.\u201d She then turned around with the stick and entered the wooden house. When she saw Hu Feng put down the quilt and the bowl, and then was about to leave. She pulled him and stopped from leaving.\u201cJust stay here a bit more.\u201dHu Feng can\u2019t understand her: \u201cWhat happened?\u201dBai Zhi pointed her finger at the half-opened door and smiled: \u201cIf you leave now, those two evil women will rush inside and take away the chicken. If you are still here, they will not dare to come inside. Just wait for me and my niang to finished eating, then go back and take the bowl.\u201dJust by thinking about Mrs. Liu\u2019s monkey looking face, she will definitely grab the food.\u201cOkay, you eat, I will sit at the door for a while.\u201dAfter Hu Feng went out, Bai Zhi took another small bowl in the house and removed the chicken from the big bowl. Then, she removed the bones and took the bowl full of chicken to the room.\u201cNiang, you eat quickly, we can only rely on this for dinner tonight.\u201d With the Bai Family\u2019s character, they will definitely not save them foods for dinner. She also doesn\u2019t want to eat rice porridge without a rice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: Remember your promiseWhen Zhao Lan saw her daughter so careful, her heart was very moved: \u201cYou, this child, I just can\u2019t move my right hand, not both of my hands. I can still eat with my left hand.\u201d\u201cOkay. Niang, eat this now, while it\u2019s hot. It doesn\u2019t taste good when it\u2019s cold.\u201d Bai Zhi smiled and put a small piece of chicken in her mouth.The meat tastes like firewood. There was no salt to taste, but luckily it was a pheasant. It has a fresh fragrance. Otherwise, she would spit them out.\u201cHu Feng, your cooking skill is really bad\u2013\u201d Hu Changlin\u2019s hand was injured, so this dish must definitely be cooked by Hu Feng.Hu Feng seemed didn\u2019t hear her words. He was still looking at the far distance. No one knows what he was thinking.Not long after, Bai Zhi went out with an empty bowl.But, Hu Feng was still standing at the door. He was standing straight and upright with his hands on his back. He has this elegant and noble atmosphere in his body. His side face has this sharpness like a knife, his deep eyes were as deep as a pool, full of confusion of his past.Bai Zhi\u00a0handed the bowl to him: \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201dHu Feng returned to his senses, then shook his head: \u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cLet me guess, you are thinking, what kind of person you are in the past, where do you live, what kind of family do you have, why you\u2019ve been missing for so long, but no one came to find you, right?\u201dHu Feng looked sideways, his eyes swept to Bai Zhi\u2019s face. Her small face was as big as his palm. There were bruises all over her face, he couldn\u2019t tell her original appearance. He could only see her clear eyes.Seeing him keeping silent, she asked another question: \u201cIf one day I cured your illness and you recovered your memories. Are you going to leave this place?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Hu Feng barely hesitated. The answer he gave this time was his most sincere answer of all.Bai Zhi asked another question: \u201cWhat about Hu Bo? If you leave, what will he do?\u201d\u201cHe is my father, no matter where I am, naturally, he will be there.\u201d Hu Feng still has no hesitation. His answer seems to have been deeply rooted in his heart.Bai Zhi was relieved when she heard his words. Obviously, Hu Changlin was deeply carved inside his heart.Hu Changlin was a good person. He rescued an unknown person like him. He treated him like his real son. If he turns out to be a white-eyed wolf, how hurt Hu Changlin will be, right?\u201cHu Feng, I promise you that I will cure you.\u201d Bai Zhi slightly lifted her head and looked at the man, who was tall and sturdy. Her eyes were shining with the light of confidence.Hu Feng lost his mind for a moment, but then nodded his head:\u00a0\u201cRemember your promise.\u201d After that, he looked at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s not early, I should go back. Come and see me if you need anything.\u201dHu Feng strode away just like a gust of wind. In a blink of an eye, he disappeared.Bai Zhi was about to return inside the house when suddenly, Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu rushed outside the big house.\u201cDead girl, your still not coming to give the food.\u201d Old Lady Bai shouted.Bai Zhi touched her belly and said: \u201cI am afraid I can\u2019t give it to you now. Maybe, tomorrow, I can.\u201dWhen Mrs.\u00a0Liu heard her words, she jumped up in anger: \u201cYou bitch, you ate them all?\u201dBai Zhi\u2019s face immediately turns cold: \u201cWho are you calling a bitch?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu pointed her finger at Bai Zhi and said: \u201cOf course, it\u2019s you. We raised you for 12 years. We raised a white-eyed wolf like you, who only knows how to eat alone. Don\u2019t forget that you are still in the Bai Family. No matter what things you have, it belongs to the Bai Family. There is no reason for you to enjoy things alone.\u201dBai Zhi coldly sneered: \u201cIf someone else scolds me, I will recognize it. But, if a bitch like you swearing and calling me a white-eyed wolf, I cannot afford to accept it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So, she only pointed her finger at Bai Zhi and scolded: \u201cYou damned unlucky star. Do you still put your elders to your eyes? Is this how your Niang taught you? To answer back your elders?\u201d\u201cMy Niang taught me a lot of things. She taught me that if I want to be loved, I should respect my elders. I didn\u2019t understand it before. I thought as long as I respect my elders, the elders will love me back. But now I understand, that even if I respect my elders, it can\u2019t be guaranteed that my elders will love me back. In that case, why should I respect my elders again?\u201d\u201cIn the past, my Niang and I worked like a horse for the Bai Family. Only the two of us worked inside and outside the house. While all of you, only doing nothing but order us. Whenever its time to eat, you ran faster than the rabbits. But when it\u2019s time to work, you move slower than the turtles. Even so, you never treated me and my Niang like a family. You only let us eat what is left by you. You only give us rag clothes, that you could no longer wear. Even if we are sick, you don\u2019t let us receive treatment. When our house collapsed, you didn\u2019t give us a place to stay. So speaking of a white-eyed wolf, I think it is I and my mother raised a lot of white-eyed wolves all these years.\u201dBai Zhi\u00a0suddenly spits out a lot of words. She talks very fast, but her words were very clear to understand. So, Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu couldn\u2019t utter a word.Bai Zhi took a deep breath and suppressed the anger in her heart. Then, she only added: \u201cMy Niang is badly hurt. If there is nothing else, it\u2019s still better not to bother us. If my mother got sick again, you will not only be owed Lu Dafu 6 silver coins.\u201dWhen Bai Zhi mentioned the 6 silver coins, Old Lady Bai\u2019s chest felt in pain. She pointed her finger at Bai Zhi and scolded back: \u201cWe owed 6 silver coins? If it weren\u2019t for you, would we end up in this situation? This debt is what you owed. Remember this old lady\u2019s words.\u201dBai Zhi softly sneered: \u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you just say, everything should be shared in the Bai Family? How come you forgot it so soon? Good things should be shared, but the bad things should not?\u201d\u201cDead girl, stop talking nonsense with me. You should pay this 6 silver coins, I will not help you to pay it back.\u201d Old Lady Bai shouted and pulled Mrs. Liu back into the big house. Then she slammed hard the door as if the door has offended her.*As soon as the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law entered the door, Mrs. Liu pulled Old Lady Bai and said: \u201cNiang, didn\u2019t you noticed that bitch seemed to have changed? Her mouth is completely different from before.\u201dOld Lady Bai didn\u2019t give Mrs. Liu a good look: \u201cDo you still need to say these words? Do you think I don\u2019t have eyes? But what if she changed? She\u2019s still a member of the Bai Family. We shouldn\u2019t wait any longer. You go to the\u00a0Baiyang Village tomorrow. Look for someone who wanted to marry and take her away as soon as possible. I don\u2019t want to see her another day.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu was very delighted. As long as that bitch was sold, her son Bai Dabao could get married. There will also be money for Bai Xiaofeng\u2019s tuition fee for the next year. Most of all, she could get rid of that torn in her eyes.Bai Xiaofeng finished his homework and entered the house. When he entered the house, he heard the dialogue between his grandmother and mother. So, he asked: \u201cGrandmother, Niang, who are you talking about? Is it Bai Zhi?\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai saw her baby grandson, her anger immediately eased by three points. She laughed and said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Grandmother will take good care of it. You only need to study hard.\u201dBai Xiaofeng shook his head: \u201cNo, no, you can\u2019t get rid of Bai Zhi. If you get rid of her, who will go with me to the school? Who will serve me food and fan me?\u201dOld Lady Bai busily said: \u201cI will go with you.

They can barely eat enough, but he wanted to buy a maidservant? Was it supposed to be a joke?But after all, he was the old lady\u2019s precious grandson. In the future, he will become a big official. He will bring happiness to the whole Bai Family. So naturally, they cannot go against his wishes. After pausing a few moments, Old Lady Bai smiled and said: \u201cOkay, okay, we\u2019ll do that. Grandma will buy you an obedient maidservant, okay?\u201dIn satisfaction, Bai Xiaofeng turned around and then went to his room.Mrs. Liu pulled Old Lady Bai\u2019s clothes and said: \u201cNiang, are you really going to buy him a maidservant? Can we afford it?\u201dOld Lady Bai sighed and said in a low voice: \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know that we can\u2019t afford it? I only followed his wishes first, we can discuss it again later.\u201dThe two were still muttering, when Mrs. Zhang came out from the kitchen, holding a pot of vegetable without salt and oil and put it on top of the table.Old Lady Bai looked up and frowned: \u201cDidn\u2019t I said yesterday that we will divide the food per head? Why didn\u2019t you divide it per person?\u201dMrs. Liu walked to the table and looked at the pot. Then, coldly said: \u201cHow come it\u2019s only this? Did you hide almost half of it?\u201dMrs. Zhang coldly replied: \u201cIn this world, there are people that really like to put their wrongdoing\u00a0on someone else\u2019s head.\u201dMrs. Liu\u2019s face changed slightly: \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dMrs. Zhang took a look at her and said: \u201cWhat do I mean? Can\u2019t you really understand?\u201d\u201cWhat do I need to understand? You need to show an evidence before you speak. Stop talking nonsense and accusing good people.\u201d Mrs. Liu anxiously said.Mrs. Zhang added: \u201cOnly stupid people will not understand. Sister-in-law, if you want to conceal it, then conceal it. But I prefer, you stop putting your own shit to my head. I am not Zhao Lan. I will not let you plant your stolen goods to my head. Don\u2019t think that I will not resist when being bullied.\u201dOld Lady Bai had a headache: \u201cOkay, speak no more. All right?\u201d Seeing her two daughter-in-laws stopped talking. Old Lady Bai pointed her finger at the table and ask: \u201cWhy do we only have this today? Who can eat enough with this?\u201dMrs. Zhang replied: \u201cThere is no oil in the house. There are only a few vegetables. There is not much rice in the jar.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t enough rice. Old Lady Bai originally wanted to let Mrs. Liu borrow two sacks of rice to the head of the Hu Family next door. Once they harvested their own grains, they will return it. On the other hand, this wild vegetables has always been dug out by Bai Zhi. Yesterday, she should have gone digging too. But, who knows what happened and it was delayed.Old Lady Bai said to Mrs. Liu: \u201cYou go and tell to that dead girl, to dig wild vegetables tomorrow morning. She still has her hands and feet, so shouldn\u2019t she use them if she wanted to continue living?\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu remembered how fierce Bai Zhi was, she hurriedly shook her head: \u201cYou better go. She doesn\u2019t listen to me now.\u201dOld Lady Bai also swept her eyes towards Mrs. Zhang\u2019s body. Mrs. Zhang knew what the old lady will say. So, she didn\u2019t wait for her to open her mouth. She turned around and went to the kitchen. She doesn\u2019t care about this stuff. She doesn\u2019t want to annoy Bai Zhi and get hit with a stick. She doesn\u2019t want to experience the same thing they experienced.Old Lady Bai was helpless. Remembering Bai Zhi\u2019s words earlier, she simply said: \u201cCall her tomorrow morning, that dead\u00a0girl must not be angry by then.\u201dMrs. Liu thinks for a bit, that dead girl, Bai Zhi has changed tremendously. Especially, when she hit people. She was so fast and ruthless, she couldn\u2019t fight at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: RefugeesThe next morning, Bai Zhi got up early and helped Zhao Lan to wash. Then, she went straight to the big house next door. She and Zhao Lan lived in a small house, they don\u2019t have their own stove and other cooking stuff. In the past, the two of them were waiting for the Bai Family to finished eating before they could eat a meal. They only let them eat their remaining cold foods. But, they let them washed their dishes, even though they were treated like dogs.Today, Bai Zhi naturally refused to live like that. She was hungry, so naturally, she will eat, but not what the Bai Family left behind.The door in the big house was opened wide, so as soon as she stepped her foot inside, she ran into Mrs. Liu, who was in a rush.Fortunately, she responded quickly and avoided her. Otherwise, the injury on her body might hurt again.Mrs.\u00a0Liu stopped walking when she saw Bai Zhi. Then, she immediately yelled at her: \u201cYou came at the right time. You cook our breakfast and dig some wild vegetables. Go to the mountain early, so you could get the fresh ones. Don\u2019t let the others get them first.\u201dBai Zhi tilted her head and said in a low voice: \u201cAunt, I\u2019m still injured, but you want me to go out and work? I think you only want me to die outside and never came back, right?\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu heard her words, she jumped up in fright, but then scolded back: \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about, you dead girl? Isn\u2019t digging vegetables your ordinary job? Why can\u2019t you do it right now? When you were holding a stick, I can see that you have a lot of energy. You don\u2019t look injured at all. So stop talking nonsense. After you finished cooking, you dig wild vegetables. When you came back, you can eat your breakfast.\u201dWhat? She wants her to cook breakfast, but she can\u2019t eat right after? She need to pick up wild vegetables first before she could have breakfast? What will she eat by then? Eat the wind?Bai Zhi was too lazy to argue with Mrs. Liu. Her stomach was grumbling in hunger.So, she turned around and walked away. Mrs. Liu hurriedly stopped her: \u201cYou haven\u2019t cook breakfast yet. Where are you going?\u201dBai Zhi looked back at Mrs. Liu and smiled: \u201cAunt, the time is not too early. If I cook breakfast first, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll fail to get the fresh wild vegetables. Other people will get them first. So, I better go now.\u201d After she finished, Bai Zhi quickly left the big house.She wants her to work, hmph, impossible!\u201cNiang, I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t eat any foods in this Bai Family. Let\u2019s go out and eat.\u201dZhao Lan has long been expecting to eat nothing in the Bai family. But, her daughter said they will eat outside? What can they eat outside?\u201cGo out to eat? Where will we go?\u201dBai Zhi helped her mother to get out of bed. \u201cNiang, are you confused? Didn\u2019t we leave a basket of eggs in Hu Bo\u2019s house? Aunt asked me to dig some wild vegetables, so we can go outside. Let\u2019s go to Hu Bo\u2019s house and cook two eggs for breakfast. Let\u2019s go back here by the afternoon so that they will not order us again and again.\u201dZhao Lan was also not willing to stay in the house. Although it was not appropriate to go to Hu Changlin\u2019s house now, its still better than listening to Bai Family\u2019s scolding from time to time.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d Zhao Lan got out of bed. The pain in her hand was not as strong as yesterday. She could bear the pain now. She could even work in the field with her uninjured hand.Bai Zhi said: \u201cNiang, when you go outside the house, try to act like you\u2019re still heavily injured. Walk slowly. Don\u2019t let them see you full of spirit.\u201dZhao Lan understood her daughter\u2019s meaning, so she repeatedly nodded her head: \u201cNiang understands, rest assured.\u201dThe mother and daughter helped each other out. They were wearing old and ragged clothes while walking in difficulty. As if, in every step they took, they were eating a great pain. They looked like refugees fleeing from a foreign country. Not to mention, they looked very miserable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: Pointing at the noseUnder Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu\u2019s sharp gaze, the mother and daughter carried the bamboo basket on their back and left the courtyard step by step. Outside the courtyard was the main road of the village. The houses of the big families were built near the main road. It was more convenient for them to pull their harvested crops with the ox cart.It was early in the morning, but many villagers were already carrying their farm tools to the fields outside the village. So, they saw the tragic situation of the mother and the daughter and they stopped to ask.\u201cZhi\u2019er, you both look like this, why did you come out?\u201dBai Zhi said with redden eyes: \u201cThere are no wild vegetables at home. Grandmother asked us to dig wild vegetables. Uncle, thank you for your concern, but we must go now. Otherwise, they will punish us if we came back late.\u201d Bai Zhi was originally thin, her thin face full of bruises, coupled with the tears on her beautiful eyes, her appearance became more pitiful.Seeing how the mother and child walking with difficulty, the villagers sighed and shook their heads: \u201cWhat a good child. How can this Bai Family be so cruel?\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. That family is so lazy, no one can work seriously. Only that mother and child do the work in the field and inside the house. But in the end, they become like this!\u201d\u201cIt all thanks to Zhao Lan\u2019s long patience. If it was another woman, I\u2019m afraid that woman already left the Bai Family and find another good family. Why would you stay with the Bai Family who only knows the bad practice in life?\u201d \u201c\u201cLeave? It\u2019s only easy for you to say that. If Zhao Lan is gone, what do you think will happen to Zhi\u2019er? Do you think Zhi\u2019er will have a better life than today in that Bai family?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Zhang just came back from the river, after washing their clothes. When she heard the villagers\u2019 comments and saw them looking at her with strange eyes. At that moment, her heart was on fire. Although she was part of the Bai Family. And also didn\u2019t give Zhao Lan a face. She didn\u2019t unscrupulously bullied Zhao Lan like her mother-in-law and sister-in-law. She never used her hand to slap or hurt Bai Zhi. But now, she was also branded notorious, just because she was a member of the family. This event really made her\u00a0suffocating.Mrs. Zhang glared at the villagers and walked back home with her tub. But as soon as she entered the gate, she scolded Bai Erzhu, who was stretching\u00a0out in the courtyard: \u201cYou really know nothing. You only know how to eat and sleep. Do you know what time is it now? Everyone in the village now finished working in the field. They were all now going back home.\u201dBai Erzhu was scolded right on his face.\u00a0Is this woman sick? Why is she scolding me as early as this morning?\u201cWhy are you staring at me? Did I say something wrong? I must be really blind for marrying a man like you!\u201dAlthough Bai Erzhu and Mrs. Zhang\u2019s were not really fond of each other, they rarely quarrel. Mrs. Zhang temper was very different from Mrs. Liu. She was not the kind of person who likes to care about every issue.Today, because of Mrs. Zhang sudden scolding, Bai Erzhu was completely dumbfounded. He doesn\u2019t know what kind of wind passed by.\u201cMy wife, you can scold people if you want, but can you at least tell me why are you getting angry? You shouldn\u2019t scold me for no apparent reason.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Zhang coldly sneered and throw the tub in her hand. She put her hand on her waist and pointed her finger at Bai Erzhu: \u201cYou don\u2019t know why? I can see that you really don\u2019t know anything. Your wife was pointed fingers by the villagers right under her nose, but where are you? Are you even a man? Why do you always let your wife do the work? Why don\u2019t you think of a way to earn money? Why do you always let me return to our home to borrow foods? Do you think I still have a face?\u201dBai Erzhu understood things by now. It turned out that she was wronged outside, so she came back and let out her anger at him.\u201cWho dares to point their fingers on your nose? Tell me, I\u2019ll scold them back for you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: Who wants to separate?Mrs.\u00a0Zhang coldly said: \u201cThere are many people pointing their fingers at me, who are you going to scold?\u201dBai\u00a0Erzhu was even more confused: \u201cFor no reason, they pointed their fingers\u00a0at you? Did you offend someone?\u201dWhen Mrs. Zhang heard this, she was even angrier. Although she usually didn\u2019t bother about Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi\u2019s case. This time, she didn\u2019t participate in any of it. It has nothing to do with her. But people were poking her spine. Who wouldn\u2019t feel wrong with this?\u201cDid I offend someone? Now, all the people in the village were calling the Bai Family a white-eyed wolf. That Bai Family only relies on Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi to live, but the family doesn\u2019t treat them nicely. Instead, the Bai Family is letting them live like half dead. People were injured, but were still being pushed to work. And the people who have good limbs were only resting at home. Tell me, does these thing has something to do with me? Why do they need to point their fingers at me when I didn\u2019t even move a finger to the mother and daughter? Why me?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu came out of the house, she was wearing new clothes. She usually couldn\u2019t bear to wear these clothes. But who knows why she was wearing it today.When she heard Mrs. Zhang\u2019s words, she immediately said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? You are also a member of the Bai Family. As a member, naturally, we have to shoulder things, whether it is good or bad.\u201dWhen it comes to this, Mrs. Zhang took a deep breath. Mrs. Zhang wanted to separate from the Bai Family. But every time she will mention it to Bai Erzhu, Bai Erzhu always refused. He said if they separate, the family also needs to divide the field. He doesn\u2019t want to work all day. He likes his life where he could eat and wear clothes while living\u00a0leisurely.Because of Mrs. Liu\u2019s words, Mrs. Zhang became more determined to separate. So, she gathered up her courage and said: \u201cWell, since sister-in-law had opened up this thing, then I will say it clearly. I want to separate. After we separate, we no longer need to shoulder things whether it is good or bad. We no longer need to share things. Don\u2019t rely on me anymore. We will no longer bother each other.\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu heard the word \u201cseparation\u201d, she got panicked. In this family, she was the most unwilling to split. The money her son, Bai Xiaofeng, needs in his studies were big. The eggs in the family were only eaten by her son. She couldn\u2019t afford to divide it.Additionally, Bai\u00a0Xiaofeng doesn\u2019t work in the house or fields. Bai Dabao was also not good at work, unlike Bai Fugui, even though he was only 13 years old. Also, Bai Dazhu\u2019s hands were now injured. If they separate, who will do all the work?Mrs. Liu\u2019s arrogance was extremely reduced by a few points. But, she still tried to smile at Mrs. Zhang and said: \u201cSister-in-law, we are all family through thick or thin, how can we separate?\u201d\u201cWho wants to be separate?\u201d Old Lady Bai was originally getting bored inside the house. But, she suddenly heard her two daughter-in-laws arguing.Mrs.\u00a0Zhang was somewhat scared of the old lady. When she first came to this family, she ate a lot of hardship. That\u2019s why even up to now, she was still somewhat listening to the old lady\u2019s rules. Even though the old lady was not as vicious to her like to Zhao Lan, but she could see with her eyes, that the old lady was biased to Mrs. Liu\u2019s son, Bai\u00a0\u00a0Xiaofeng. Her children were only a small grass to the old lady\u2019s eyes, while Bai Xiaofeng was a treasure.\u201cI want to separate.\u201d Mrs. Zhang gathered up her courage and said to the old lady.Old Lady Bai immediately looked at her coldly, then looked at Bai Erzhu: \u201cErzhu, do you want to separate?\u201dBai Erzhu hurriedly waved his hands: \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t want to separate. Only this woman wanted to separate. It has nothing to do with me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: Raising other people\u2019s sonMrs. Zhang almost coughs up blood, how did she marry such a man?Old Lady Bai\u2019s cold eyes, once again swept to Mrs. Zhang\u2019s face: \u201cYou old wench, now that your no longer a woman from the mountain, you dared to shout separation? Did we treat you badly? Didn\u2019t we give you enough food and clothes?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Zhang also tried to calculate, so she frankly said: \u201cI\u2019m not talking about foods and clothes. I am talking about Xiaofeng, first sister-in-law\u2019s son. Xiaofeng can go to school. But, my son who was also a member of the family and at the same age cannot? So why do our family need to keep working hard to support Bai Xiaofeng studies?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu busily said: \u201cSister-in-law, you shouldn\u2019t speak like a stranger. Xiaofeng is your\u2019s and second brother-in-law\u2019s nephew. In the future, when Xiaofeng become a big official, our family can enjoy the blessing. You and second brother-in-law, will be able to enjoy it too, right?\u201dOthers don\u2019t know Bai Xiaofeng\u2019s true character, but Mrs. Zhang has clear eyes, so why she wouldn\u2019t know? For someone like Bai Xiaofeng, who knows if he can passed the official test. However, even if he became a big official, will he help a poor relative like her or Bai Erzhu? Mrs. Zhang will not believe it.\u201cI don\u2019t expect any blessings. All I want now is to separate. I, Zhenzhu and Fugui can grow vegetables to eat. We don\u2019t want to work and raise other people\u2019s son anymore.\u201dOld Lady Bai felt distressed for Bai Xiaofeng. Especially, when she heard Mrs. Zhang said other people\u2019s son. Her heart couldn\u2019t help but feel in pain, so she pointed her finger to Mrs. Zhang: \u201cZhang Shumei, you are now really capable, you can manage the family\u2019s business now ah. But since when did you have the right to speak? Separation is not something for you to decide. You only have to do your part, you shouldn\u2019t control other things.\u201dAfter the old lady finished, she turned to Mrs. Liu and said: \u201cWhat are you still doing here? Aren\u2019t you going to do your business yet?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu returned to her senses and rushed outside to go.Old Lady Bai angrily looked back at Mrs. Zhang, then turned around and went inside the house.Mrs. Zhang was so angry, she wanted to vent her anger to Bai Erzhu, but Bai Erzhu ran away.Mrs. Zhang didn\u2019t even try to dry their newly washed clothes. She packed up a few clothes and pulled Bai Zhenzhu outside the house.\u201cNiang, where are you going to take me?\u201d Although Bai Zhenzhu didn\u2019t go outside the house, she clearly heard the quarrel outside.\u201cI can no longer stay in this house. You and I will stay at your uncle\u2019s house for a few days.\u201dBai Zhenzhu was reluctant, but her mother dragged her away. She doesn\u2019t want to beat in front of the villagers, so she has no choice but to go to the neighboring village.Old Lady Bai didn\u2019t know that her second daughter-in-law and granddaughter went away. She waited for Mrs. Zhang to call her to eat. But, when her stomach started rumbling, she looked for Mrs. Zhang, but she didn\u2019t see even her shadow. Even Bai Zhenzhu was gone.Old Lady Bai was so angry, her mouth kept swearing and swearing. Her face looked very angry. How will she eat? Cook for herself? Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi were outside. Mrs. Liu went to\u00a0Bai yang Village. Mrs. Zhang ran away. All the people who do the housework was gone, she was left all alone.Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan were on their way to Hu Changlin\u2019s house when they encountered Old Zhao\u2019s ox cart on the road. Old Zhao regularly pulling this ox cart of him and make a trip to the town. Other villager\u2019s who wanted to go to the town also rent his ox cart in advance for 5 copper coins.So at this time, the person who was sitting in the ox cart was Doctor Lu.When Bai Zhi saw Doctor Lu, her eyes lit up. She suddenly had an idea, and so she stopped the ox cart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: Destroying own reputation\u201cZhi\u2019er? Why are you here?\u201d Doctor Lu stopped and asked in surprise.Bai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cLu Dafu, may I have a few words with you, please? I have something to tell you.\u201dDoctor Lu thought Bai Zhi wanted to talk about the wild ginseng. The wild ginseng was inside the bag in his hand:\u00a0Does she want to take it back?With some doubts, Doctor Lu went down the ox cart and walked under the shade, then asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dBai Zhi went closed and whispered a few words in Doctor Lu\u2019s ear.Doctor Lu was shocked and\u00a0hurriedly waved his hand: \u201cThis can\u2019t be done. If this spread, how are you going to marry in the future? Your reputation will completely be ruined.\u201dBai Zhi shook her head: \u201cI\u2019ll think about it in the future. But for now, I don\u2019t want to be sold by my grandmother and my aunt. First Aunt will go to the Baiyang Village today, to find me a husband. It\u2019s good to get married, but not in this nasty way. They only want to sell me. I still want to stay with my mother and repay her kindness.\u201dWhen Doctor Lu heard her words, he couldn\u2019t help but gritted his teeth: \u201cThis Bai Family is really a beast. They are all wicked people. It\u2019s only really a waste for your mother to lose her youth and work hard for those people.\u201dDoctor Lu turned his head and said to Bai Zhi: \u201cZhi\u2019er think about it again. Once you destroyed your owned reputation, we can\u2019t do anything about it. You might not be able to get it back.\u201dBai Zhi nodded: \u201cI carefully thought of it. I don\u2019t care about my reputation. As long as I can live with my mother, I am more satisfied.\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu understood Bai Zhi\u2019s current mood. If such thing really happens, although reputation was important, nothing else was more important than life. Doctor Lu was very familiar with Baiyang Village\u2019s situation, some people there who don\u2019t have money cannot get married. But, some people who have money, also cannot get a wife.Most people there were an old\u00a0bachelors. Why they can\u2019t get married even though they have a little bit of money?Aside from the bad feng shui, there was another big reason, these old bachelors have very\u00a0tyrannical character. Who knows how many ordinary girls were tortured to death in that village. However, some wives who successfully sneaked out, spread news about those old bachelor\u2019s notorious behavior, which causes the other old bachelor had a hard time to look for a wife.\u00a0The price to get a wife increase, because only people who needed money was willing to marry off in the Baiyang Village.Doctor Lu looked at the ox cart that was not far away from the shades, then said in a low voice: \u201cZhi\u2019er, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll help you in this matter. I will look for an opportunity to spread some wind to a few women in the village that will go to the town. We will use their mouth to spread a news. By then, this incident you think off will spread throughout the village.\u201dBai Zhi\u2019s lips curved into a smile: \u201cThat\u2019s good. The sooner the news spread, the better. Today, First Aunt went to the Baiyang Village. Once she finds someone, it is estimated that person will investigate me in the next two days.\u201dThe two people continued whispering to each other. But, when someone came, they separate their ways.Doctor Lu went back to the ox cart. Seeing this, Zhao Lan pulled Bai Zhi and asked: \u201cThis child, what did you talk about with Lu Dafu?\u201dBai Zhi understood that this matter shouldn\u2019t be hidden from her mother, and so she simply told her.Zhao Lan became anxious. She wanted to chase after Doctor Lu, but Bai Zhi stopped her: \u201cNiang, don\u2019t worry, listen to me first.\u201dZhao Lan hurriedly said: \u201cHow can I not worry? Don\u2019t you know how important a girl\u2019s reputation is in this world? How can you destroy your own reputation? If this spread, how are you going to marry in the future?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: Lucky\u201cNiang, let\u2019s leave the future marriage in the future. What\u2019s important right now is our current situation. If we are not pushed in this situation, I will not do this. But, if I will not do this, I will have to marry someone in the Baiyang Village. Do you think I will live long in that village?\u201dZhao Lan\u2019s emotions gradually stabilized. She also realized their helpless situation. If Bai Zhi will be sent to the Baiyang Village by the Bai Family, they might not be able to meet again.\u201cNiang, you don\u2019t have to worry. I am still young. This rumor will be forgotten in a few years. By that time, I will ask Lu Dafu to help me regain my reputation. This thing will really not affect me, you can rest assured.\u201dZhao Lan released a long sigh: \u201cAll these things happened because your Niang is useless and can\u2019t protect you. Otherwise, you don\u2019t need to make such a decision.\u201d\u201cZhao Lan? Zhi\u2019er? You came?\u201dThe mother and the daughter unconsciously walked towards Hu Changlin\u2019s house. Hu Changlin was standing and cleaning in front of their\u00a0gate,\u00a0when he saw the mother and daughter. He busily came forward and asked a question.Zhao Lan looked at Hu Changlin\u2019s broken arm and felt ashamed. After all, Hu Changlin was injured because of her.\u201cHu Dage, I\u2019m sorry, I made you suffer like this.\u201dHu Changlin put down the broomstick and waved his hand: \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t get in the way, it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore. Lu Dafu said that my injury is not heavy. It will be fine in 7 or 8 days. It\u2019s you, you have been injured again. I\u2019m afraid, it became more serious than before, right?\u201dZhao Lan also hurriedly waved her hand: \u201cI am fine, it will be good after a few days, I\u2019m really all right.\u201dHu Changlin led the mother and daughter into the courtyard. Because the two Bai brothers caused a big commotion yesterday, the courtyard was messy.\u201cYou haven\u2019t had breakfast yet, right? Just eat here. Hu Feng is boiling the water, I will let him cook two more eggs.\u201dBai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cThat\u2019s great. Me and my niang are really hungry. We\u2019re not allowed to go back until we haven\u2019t dig enough wild vegetables. We were originally planning to go here to have a meal.\u201dHu Changlin stared at Bai Zhi and said: \u201cYou silly child, why do you let yourself get hungry? As long as Hu Bo is here if you want to come, live or stay here, you can do so. Do you understand?\u201dBai Zhi heavily nodded her head. Her nose slightly became sour. This unrelated person was really good to her. Thinking about her parents in her previous life, and the Bai Family in this second life, she thinks that she might not really be unfortunate. Because she had a mother who cares about her wholeheartedly. And a good uncle like Hu Changlin. With them beside her, she believes that her future will get better and better.Bai Zhi helped Zhao Lan to sit down at the table inside the house, then she turned her head towards Hu Changlin: \u201cHu Bo, I\u2019ll go and help in the kitchen.\u201dHu Changlin nodded his head. \u201cOkay, you go. I \u2018ll pour your Niang a glass of water.\u201dBai Zhi went to the kitchen. In there, she saw Hu Feng putting 4 eggs and 4 sweet potatoes in the pot.\u201cWell, that\u2019s enough for us.\u201d Bai Zhi smiled and went close. Seeing the fire in the stove was very strong, there was no need to add more wood. The water in the pot was also enough, there was no need to add water: \u201cIt seems that I don\u2019t need to give you a hand.\u201dHu Feng put the lid on the pot and turned his head to look at Bai Zhi. Then, he said: \u201cWhen are you going to start treating me?\u201dBai Zhi was a bit startled, she didn\u2019t expect Hu Feng will ask such a question at the moment. But then, she replied with composure: \u201cThis is not a simple matter. We must first find the right medicinal herbs for you to drink. And silver needles to get rid the blood clots that the medicine couldn\u2019t dissolve. The blood clots had stayed in your brain for a long time, it won\u2019t be easy to get rid of all of them at once. You need to undergo a long-term treatment and regain your memories slowly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s already been 3 years, I don\u2019t mind waiting for another 3 years.\u201d As long as he can regain his memories and find his past, he was willing to wait for another 3 years.Bai Zhi waved her hand: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to wait for another 3 years. It\u2019s just, right now, I am also injured, my physical strength is not good. I need enough strength to perform needle technique.

But regarding how many treatments you need before you recover your memories, it will depend on how effective the treatment on you. It\u2019s really hard to say anything right now, but I am certain that it will not take 3 years.\u201dHu Feng nodded: \u201cAll right, if you need anything for me to do, just tell me.\u201dBai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cOf course there is something you need to do. If you want me to find a good quality of herbs, I am afraid I have to go to the mountain. Without you, I will not dare to go in such a place.\u201d\u201cNo problem, just tell me when you want to go.\u201d Hu Feng faintly said, but his handsome face became bright. As if a light suddenly flashed in the dark road of his life.Bai Zhi looked up to him and seriously said: \u201cHu Feng, yesterday, thank you.\u201d No matter what Hu Feng\u2019s reason for helping her yesterday, she was really thankful. In her most difficult time, only him has stood up and defended her. He stood in front of her like a big mountain.Hu Feng slightly swept his eyes to Bai Zhi, his cold voice sounded above her head: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me. I am just repaying you in advance, just remember your promise.\u201d After he finished, Hu Feng\u2019s figure disappeared into the kitchen. No one knows where he was going.*When Mrs. Liu went to Baiyang Village, she quickly found someone who was willing to buy Bai Zhi for 20 silver coins.The man was called Yang Sigen. He was a widower. He was 40 years old, he was not that old. But compared to Bai Zhi\u2019s age, his age was enough to be her father.This man had already married three wives. Those three wives gave him three daughters.\u00a0 Each wife died soon under his hands after giving birth to his daughter.His two daughters were sold, the other one died from drowning.It can be said, that Yang Sigen was the exact example of how ruthless the men in the Baiyang Village is.There were other good candidates, but Mrs. Liu specifically chooses Yang Sigen because his mind was very vicious.This Yang Sigen was very ruthless. He badly wanted a son. So, whoever marries him that can\u2019t give birth to a son, will directly die.When Mrs. Liu received the 10 silver coins down payment, she immediately went back home. After entering the big house, Mrs. Liu hurriedly closed the big house\u2019s door, in fear of Bai Zhi might suddenly enter or heard their conversation.When Old Lady Bai saw the 10 silver coins in Mrs. Liu\u2019s hands, she was so happy to the point that her mouth couldn\u2019t stop from smiling. She rubbed her hands over and over again, while her tongue licked her upper lip.\u201cNiang, this is merely a deposit. I told him after we sent that dead girl in their family, he must give us the remaining 10 silver coins. But, he said he will send a matchmaker and a sedan chair in our place, then he will give us the remaining silver coins.\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai heard her words, she immediately said: \u201cThat will save you a lot of effort. That dead girl, someone is still willing to treat her good? If that man will change his mind not to hire a matchmaker and a sedan chair, he\u2019ll be able to give us 2 more silver coins, right?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu quickly nodded her head and smiled: \u201cI think so too.\u201dOld Lady Bai was feeling happier, then suddenly she asked Mrs. Liu: \u201cWhen will they send the matchmaker?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu replied: \u201cHe said the sooner the better, so after three days, they will come to pick up that dead girl.\u201dOld Lady Bai nodded her head in satisfaction: \u201cThree days are enough. The bruises on that dead girl\u2019s face will get better, she will not look too ugly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: Who will plant?The next moment, Bai Dazhu\u2019s voice sounded inside the house: \u201cIs the food ready? I am starving to death.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu rushed to the kitchen and take a look. In the kitchen, she only found a cold stove. She didn\u2019t see any shadows of foods, so she went back to the living room and said to the old lady: \u201cNiang, I think you need to talk to Second\u00a0Sister-in-law. Look at the time, why she haven\u2019t cook yet?\u201dOld Lady Bai replied: \u201cYour sister-in-law took Zhenzhu with her and went to her family. You cook our lunch.\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu heard this, she was dissatisfied: \u201cWhy am I cooking again? I cooked yesterday. Now that it\u2019s second sister-in-law\u2019s turn, she\u2019s being lazy? Why she didn\u2019t go there yesterday instead?\u201dOld Lady Bai was still weighing the silver coins in her hands, so she has still smile on her face: \u201cIf people want to leave, just let them leave. We can save a few more rations by then. You better cook now, didn\u2019t you hear your husband said he was hungry? Xiaofeng will come back home soon, remember to boil him an egg.\u201dWhen Mrs.\u00a0Liu saw that the old lady always keep her son, Bai Xiaofeng in mind, she finally felt better: \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to cook, but there was no egg. The old hen in the backyard hasn\u2019t laid an egg for several days now.\u201dMrs. Liu opened the door and saw no one in the courtyard. Then, she shouted again: \u201cThat dead girl hasn\u2019t come back yet. I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have food to cook.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu looked at the old lady\u2019s bulging clothes, then suddenly, she smiled and said: \u201cNiang, Li Si killed a pig yesterday, he sent it to the town and sell it today. I\u2019m sure there were few meats left behind. Would you like to buy some meat?\u201dIf it was an ordinary day, Old Lady Bai will not agree to it, but today was different. Today, Mrs. Liu brought back 10 silvers coins. And there were another 10 silver coins coming. The family hasn\u2019t tasted a meat for a long time now. Mrs. Zhang and Bai Zhenzhu were also not in the house. If they bought at least two pounds of meat, they could eat enough for the day.Thinking of this, Old Lady Bai went to her room and put the 10 silver coins in a box and took a few copper coins, then handed them to Mrs. Liu: \u201cThis is 50 copper coins. Take this to buy at least 2 pounds of pork. If there\u2019s still some change, you go and buy some eggs.\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu held the 50 copper coins, she swallowed a mouthful saliva. As if a braised pork was placed in front of her.When Bai Erzhu came in, he had witnessed such scene, so he also smiled and said: \u201cNiang, did the sun came out from the west today? Why are we suddenly eating meat?\u201dOld Lady Bai took a glance at Bai Erzhu and said in a bad mood: \u201cYou talk\u00a0like I\u2019ve never bought any meat before.\u201d Old Lady Bai then looked at Bai Erzhu from head to toe. She saw his clothes were clean, and there was no single sign of sweat or mud. She also saw his foot were clean as if he didn\u2019t go outside.Old Lady Bai\u2019s face suddenly sank and unhappily said: \u201cYou didn\u2019t go to work in the field?\u201dBai Erzhu\u2019s face darken as if he was taken for granted: \u201cHow can a person work in the field alone? You didn\u2019t even assign me a helper.\u201dOld Lady Bai was so angry, she wanted to give him a slap in the face. But because he was her son, she only scolded him: \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? How can a person work alone? You need a helper? Zhao Lan was injured but she could work in the field alone. Did you see anyone helping her!?\u201dBai Erzhu propped up his head to the side and said: \u201cZhao Lan is Zhao Lan. I am me. Why do you compare me to Zhao Lan? Also, aren\u2019t all these things happening because you hurt Zhao Lan? If you didn\u2019t hurt her, I\u2019m sure the work in the field is already finished by now. Do we still need to worry about anything?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: Give me the halfOld Lady Bai had a shortness in breath, but she still hurriedly slapped Bai Erzhu\u2019s arm and said: \u201cYou\u2019re blaming your uselessness on me? Didn\u2019t you think of it, Zhao Lan is a widow, Sanzhu has long been dead. She will not stay here forever. Who can tell how long she will stay in the family? Our family will have to rely on you to work in the field sooner or later. So, how can you still rely on Zhao Lan?\u201dBai Erzhu didn\u2019t show any care, he only smiled and said: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. Third Brother has been dead for ten years. But, Zhao Lan still stayed with us for ten years. Why? Isn\u2019t it because of that bitch, Zhi\u2019er. As long as that bitch is here, it\u2019s impossible for Zhao Lan to leave. Don\u2019t you still understand that?\u201dOld Lady Bai realized Bai Erzhu\u2019s analysis makes sense. Zhao Lan stayed in the Bai Family was really because of Bai Zhi. But, if Bai Zhi left the Bai Family, or to be more precise if they sent her to the Baiyang Village, will\u00a0Zhao Lan continue to stay?Old Lady Bai looked at\u00a0Bai Erzhu and said: \u201cBai Zhi is already 12 years old, she will be 13 in a few more months. She will reach the age of marriage soon. So, she will leave this house sooner or later.\u201dBai Erzhu replied: \u201cIsn\u2019t that marriage thing is decided by you? If you let her get married, she can get married. But if you don\u2019t let her marry, she can\u2019t get married. Isn\u2019t that simple?\u201dOld Lady Bai remembered the marriage price for Bai Zhi, so she simply said: \u201cI already found a marriage candidate for that dead girl. After three days, she will leave the family. Bai Zhi could only stay in our Bai Family for three more days.\u201dBai Erzhu\u2019s eyes widen in horror: \u201cNiang, are you that old so you are confused? If you sent away that bitch, Zhao Lan will not work. Then, who will plant in our field?\u201d\u201cWho will plant? Do you want this old lady to plant in the field?\u201d Old Lady Bai angrily said.Bai Erzhu suddenly remembered the scene earlier. Her mother asked Mrs. Liu to buy meat. His heart clearly understood that the other party might have promised a lot of money. His mother was so happy and willing to buy meat, so there must definitely a lot of money.\u201cNiang, is that person from Baiyang Village? Everyone knows that old bachelors in Baiyang Village want to marry a wife and that they pay a lot of money. How much did you sell that bitch?\u201dOld Lady Bai gave him a cold sneer: \u201cWhat sell? We are merely acting their matchmaker. People are willing to give 20 silver coins. So, what are you saying?\u201dWhen Bai Erzhu heard that the price was 20 silver coins. The unpleasant feelings in his hear disappeared without a trace. He rushed to the old lady and said: \u201cNiang, can you give me half the price of 20 silver coins?\u201dOld Lady Bai hurriedly waved her hand: \u201cThat can\u2019t be done. These 20 silver coins have already used. So, how can I give you the half?\u201dBai Erzhu immediately had a long face: \u201cThen, tell me, what\u2019s the use of these 20 silver coins?\u201d\u201cDabao is already 18 years old. We should find him a wife. So naturally, we will use it on his marriage.\u201dBai Erzhu knitted his eyebrows: \u201cBut, even if you want to let him marry, you don\u2019t need to spend all the 20 silver coins. We are not in Baiyang Village, there is no need to pay a high price.\u201dOld Lady Bai opened her mouth again: \u201cNaturally, we shouldn\u2019t spend much. The rest will be used to\u00a0Xiaofeng\u2019s tuition fee next year. We need a lot of money for his school. And again, Dabao needs to buy new clothes. I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money, but I think this is not enough.\u201dTo put it bluntly, all those money has nothing to do with his family. They will all be used to his elder brother\u2019s family. Their family was not much worthy than his elder brother\u2019s family. And now that his elder brother\u2019s hands were injured, all his work fell on his head. Doesn\u2019t it seem all the good benefits fell on his elder brother, but he has nothing at all?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: Braised Rabbit MeatSince all the benefits will not be his, then he doesn\u2019t want to do all the work in the family.Bai Erzhu turned his body and went back to his room. He slammed the door heavily. Old Lady Bai shouted and shouted, but Bai Erzhu didn\u2019t still open the door.*At the Hu family.The sun has finally set, it was noon time, hot smoke gradually floats on top of the houses in the village. Zhao Lan pulled Bai Zhi and said to Hu Changlin: \u201cHu Dage, I\u2019ve been resting here till morning, we will go back now.\u201dHu Changlin replied: \u201cIf you go back now, you will only be scolded. Just go back after you have lunch. And if the Bai Family saw you didn\u2019t dig wild vegetables, they will not give you lunch.\u201dThat case was really possible. With the character of those people in the Bai Family, they were doomed to be unlucky. And they only want the mother and daughter to work, but not to eat.Bai Zhi immediately smiled and nodded her head: \u201cThen, we will thicken our skin and harass Hu Bo to give us a meal.\u201dHu Changlin laughed happily: \u201cThis child, how can you say that you have thick skin? Oh right, didn\u2019t you said yesterday that you will cook us braised rabbit meat? I already cleaned it up, you can cook it.\u201dBai Zhi\u00a0said: \u201cI see, Hu Bo wants to eat braised rabbit meat, so he deliberately invited us to have lunch.\u201d\u201cYes, you got it right, this child is very used to this kind of event, you have to sell your service to me cheaply.\u201dThe three people laughed in the living room constantly. Especially Bai Zhi, when she laughs, her tone felt like a silver plate fall on the ground. It was crisp and melodious. Her laughter sounds beautiful and mellow. It\u2019s like a sweet honey that can intoxicate people.Listening to this, Hu Feng\u2019s mood improved by the sound of their laughter. For a moment, he forgot his trouble all day round. His lips slightly curved into a smile. And his indifference and coldness seemed disappeared for no reason.Bai Zhi then went to the kitchen. Hu Changlin was afraid that she was tired. After all, she still had injuries, so he called out Hu Feng to help.Bai Zhi stared at the thick kitchen knife. This kitchen knife was two times heavier than the knife used to kill pigs. She now only has a small arm and small body, she\u2019s afraid, she can\u2019t use it.Hu Feng came in the kitchen and saw the look in her face. He laughed inside his heart, but he didn\u2019t show it on the surface of his face. He picked up the kitchen knife and directly cut the rabbit meat. The rabbit meat was cut into five section cleanly.\u201cOh, your knife skill is good. It seems you have done it countless time.\u201d Bai Zhi smiled and gave Hu Feng a high praise.Hu Feng smashed the kitchen knife to the side and said in a low voice: \u201cFirst time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your first time, but you\u2019ve done a good job? It seems you are a very talented person.\u201dHu Feng sat down in the stove and looked up at Bai Zhi: Then, seriously said: \u201cI am very talented in everything I do.\u201dBai Zhi\u2019s eyes rolled. Was this guy joking with her? But, it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2026 \u2026Bai Zhi laughed twice as if she only heard a joke.At this time, Hu Feng had already lit a fire, Bai Zhi cleaned the pot and put it in the fire. She found some oil and condiments in the cabinet. There were not too many options, but it was enough to be used to cook braised rabbit meat.First, Bai Zhi boiled a pot of water. She boiled the rabbit meat and rinse it out. Then, she poured the oil into the pot. She fried the rabbit meat and put the star anise. She simmered it to a small fire. When the meat\u2019s juice came out, she removed the star anise and sprinkle the pepper.It would be better if there was seasoning such as onion, ginger, and garlic. Unfortunately, Bai Zhi looked for a long time in the cupboard, but only found only a small amount of star anise and a little bit of pepper. There was nothing else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: Good DayHowever, despite this, the rich aroma of the braised rabbit meat has already made the people feel drunk, and made their mouth left wide open.Bai Zhi even heard someone yelling to the other side of the wall, asking who was the person doing a good job in cooking. Making his nose smell a good fragrance.Bai Zhi then brought out a pot of braised rabbit meat. This pot was the biggest pot she found in the Hu Family\u2019s kitchen.Another pot was brought out in the kitchen. Bai Zhi and Hu Feng serve the dish one after another. One person served the braised rabbit meat, while the other one served the steaming rice. Hu Changlin and Zhao Lan were chatting while waiting. Such a scene, made them look like a real family, where there were parents and children.Hu Changlin remembered his wife and son who died early. He became emotional, but at the same time, was thankful inside his heart. God still didn\u2019t forsaken him, he let him met Hu Feng. He will not live alone during old age.When\u00a0Zhao Lan saw her daughter holding a pot of white rice in her hands. She couldn\u2019t help but frown: \u201cZhi\u2019er, why you didn\u2019t cook rice porridge?\u201dBai Zhi put down the white rice in her hand and smiled, then said: \u201cNiang, we are not like in the past. When Lu Dafu returned, he will bring back the money from selling the ginseng. So later on, we can eat rice, we don\u2019t need to eat rice porridge anymore.\u201dWhen Zhao Lan was teased by her daughter, she couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cThis child, you shouldn\u2019t make a decision like this. What if Lu Dafu couldn\u2019t bring back the money today? What will Hu Dage and Hu Feng going to eat tomorrow?Bai Zhi put a bowl of rice in front of Zhao Lan and smiled, then said: \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. If it was an ordinary ginseng, that can happen. But that was a hundred-year-old ginseng. How many pharmacists do you think will want to buy it? When Lu Dafu returned from his trip, I can guarantee 100% that he will bring us the money.\u201dAlthough she\u2019s not a businesswoman, she knows how the mind of businessmen works. When those pharmacists had seen that 100-year-old ginseng, they will definitely not let go of the opportunity of buying it. And they will wait for the right time to sell it at a high price.Hu Changlin smiled and said: \u201cEven if we didn\u2019t get the money today, we are hungry. What Zhi\u2019er said is right, we\u2019ve been suffering in poverty for a long time. Now that we have money, we shouldn\u2019t make ourselves suffer anymore. Later on, let\u2019s eat, drink and live a happy life for a few days.\u201dWhen Zhao Lan saw Hu Changlin didn\u2019t treat them like outsiders, her heart has eased a lot. She smiled and then said: \u201cWhat Hu Dage said is right, we adults have been suffering for a long time, so we shouldn\u2019t let the children also suffer.\u201d Zhao Lan looked at everyone around her. Her eyes looked gentle and misty, but also looked as sweet as a honey.*In the Bai Family.Mrs. Liu put a pot of braised pork on the table and a bowl of gruel to each person.The Bai family was sitting around the table, Bai Dazhu has injured arms, so he could only wait for Mrs. Liu to feed him. Mrs. Liu fed herself and fed Bai Dazhu after. Bai Dazhu screamed and ordered Mrs. Liu to feed him fast. He was afraid that if he ate slowly, his second younger brother will eat all the meat.Deep inside her heart, Mrs. Liu also want to hurry. She hasn\u2019t\u00a0even eaten two mouthfuls of a spoon, but the pot of braised pork has already reached the bottom. Bai Erzhu desperately put meat in his bowl, but he didn\u2019t forget to pick some meat for his son, Bai Fugui.Bai Dabao and Bai Xiaofeng haven\u2019t taken their share. But at the moment, all the braise pork almost disappeared. Old Lady Bai was very selfish. Her bowl was full of meat, but still, she didn\u2019t forget to put a meat on her mouth from the pot.Mrs. Liu became anxious. She stretched out her chopsticks to pick up the last piece of braised pork in the pot. But, when she was about to put it in her mouth, Bai Dazhu shouted at her again: \u201cWhere are you trying to put it? My mouth is here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: Braised PorkMrs. Liu refused: \u201cYou have no conscience, I haven\u2019t eaten a mouthful of meat because I am feeding you. But, I can\u2019t even eat this last piece of meat?\u201dBai Dazhu swept his eyes to Bai Erzhu\u2019s bowl: \u201cSecond younger brother, how can you take so much? Can\u2019t you give a little bit to your sister-in-law?\u201dBai Erzhu was too lazy to care for his older brother. He took his bowl and went back to their room. When Bai Fugui saw his father slipped away, he also took his bowl and quickly followed.Bai Dabao and Bai Xiaofeng\u2019s mouth was left wide open. They didn\u2019t have even a single piece of meat in their bowl. So, they looked at the old lady again.Bai Xiaofeng said: \u201cGrandmother, I haven\u2019t eaten any.\u201dBai Dabao also opened his mouth: \u201cYeah, grandmother, you should buy a lot of meat next time. So that we won\u2019t end up like this, we can\u2019t even eat enough.\u201dBai Dabao is the future head of the family, and Bai Xiaofeng is the hope of the Bai Family for a bright future. These two grandchildren were very important to the old lady. Especially Bai Xiaofeng, which simply can soften the heart of the old lady.Hearing her two grandchildren speak up their mind, Old Lady Bai couldn\u2019t say anything. She directly divided the braised pork in her bowl and gave three pieces of meat to Bai Xiaofeng and two pieces to Bai Dabao.Mrs. Liu, who was looking, didn\u2019t even receive a single meat.*At this time, Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan came back. Bai Zhi first sent Zhao Lan back to their wooden house, and then carried the wild vegetables that Hu Changlin gave to her.When she entered the door, she smelled the fragrance of braised pork. She couldn\u2019t help but sneer inside her heart. When she and her mother was not at home, they dared to eat meat? She was sure that they didn\u2019t even save them a single drop of broth.Bai Zhi stepped into the big house, she quickly walked inside towards the\u00a0dining\u00a0table with a smile on her face,\u00a0then unloaded the wild vegetables: \u201cIt smells\u00a0so good, what are you eating for lunch?\u201dWhen Mrs.\u00a0Liu saw Bai Zhi going to the table, she quickly poured all the remaining broth to her bowl.Bai Zhi looked at the dish that was as clean as a dog\u2019s bowl. She frowned and asked: \u201cHow come you finished everything? Me and my niang haven\u2019t eaten yet.\u201dOld Lady Bai quickly put the last piece of braised pork into her mouth, then she coldly looked at Bai Zhi: \u201cWho told you to come back so late? If you came back a little earlier, will this happen? Look at the time right now!\u201dIf we came back a little earlier, we can eat braised pork? Hahaha!Bai Zhi replied: \u201cMe and niang were both injured. If we could come back a little earlier, that would be good. But, you are too much. You didn\u2019t give us breakfast, yet you also didn\u2019t leave us some lunch? I think you are desperate to starve me and my\u00a0niang to death.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu pointed her finger to the wild vegetables and said: \u201cDidn\u2019t you dug wild vegetables? Why don\u2019t you cook and eat them?\u201dBai Zhi really wanted to kick away the wild vegetables, but after thinking that it was given to them by Hu Changlin and they can only eat them at dinner. She no longer said anything, even if she was dissatisfied. She only went to the kitchen expressionlessly.There was a half bowl of pork lard on the stove. It must be save by Mrs. Liu when she cooked the braised pork. The existence of pork lard was also a rare thing in the family. So, it was usually hidden by them. Occasionally, Bai Xiaofeng eat fried rice with it. But today, with the thought of a large amount of meat, Mrs. Liu seemed forgot to clean up the kitchen and hide it.When Bai Zhi fried the wild vegetables, she poured all the pork lard in it. She didn\u2019t even save a single drop for them.Bai Zhi fried the wild vegetables with the pork lard, so naturally, it tastes\u00a0was different. She put all the fried wild vegetable in a pot and hide it. The only thing that remained in the kitchen was the rice porridge. Bai Zhi went outside the kitchen in a hurry, she left the main room like a gush of wind, in fear that the Bai Family might saw her dish and robbed it back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: LessonsWhen Bai Xiaofeng smelled a flavoring scent, he tried stopping Bai Zhi. But, who would have thought, that she was very fast in running? She was gone in a blink of an eye.When Bai Zhi went back to their wooden house, she poured the porridge and stir-fried wild vegetables to their own big bowls. And she hides\u00a0them in the corner to save for dinner.Zhao Lan saw her daughter smiling, so she couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Every time you came back to the big house, you have a bad face. but this time, you are smiling.\u201dBai Zhi smiled and replied: \u201cNiang, you will know soon. First Aunt will come over and complain in anger. Just wait for the good show.\u201dSure enough, after a while, a loud shout of Mrs. Liu sounded: \u201cPork lard? Where is my pork lard?\u201dThen, Mrs. Liu\u2019s quick footsteps came. In a short while, she arrived in the wooden house, where Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan lives. Without any warning, she kicked open the door.Mrs. Liu put her one hand to her waist and shouted while pointing her finger to Bai Zhi: \u201cYou, you little slut, now you have the ability to steal my pork lard?\u201dBai Zhi shrugged her shoulders: \u201cI didn\u2019t steal it. I only used some while cooking the wild vegetables. First Aunt, you know that I have injuries, so while I\u2019m pouring some of it, I accidentally poured everything into the pot. My hand loses control. I originally wanted to save some of it, but I thought First Aunt save it for my mother. So, I used it with gratitude. Look, this is the bowl, please take it with you and wash it.\u201dZhao Lan finally understood, her daughter was like a ghost. No wonder she was smiling when she got back. Originally, she stole Mrs. Liu\u2019s treasure. Mrs. Liu always hides the pork lard for her son, Bai Xiaofeng. Only her son could eat it, no one else could touch it. So this time, she will naturally get angry.Mrs.\u00a0Liu\u2019s body trembled in anger, she pointed her finger to Bai Zhi\u2019s nose and said: \u201cYou, you dead girl, you even dared to touch this old lady\u2019s pork lard, don\u2019t think that this old lady will not teach you a lesson today, today \u2014\u201cBai Zhi raised an eyebrow, then her bright face changed into a cold one: \u201cWhat about today? Does First Aunt want to fight with me?\u201dLooking at Bai Zhi\u2019s cold face, Mrs. Liu\u2019s felt a chill on her back and she couldn\u2019t help but took a step backward. This step made her feet stumbled on the threshold of the wooden house. So, Mrs. Liu\u2019s body fell uncontrollably. Her waist bumped into the stone on the ground.Bai Dabao and Bai Xiaofeng, who was standing in the courtyard, saw their mother fall outside the wooden house. They immediately rushed forward to help their mother. Bai Dabao pointed his finger to Bai Zhi and said: \u201cYou dead girl, how dare you push away someone?\u201dBai Zhi shrugged her shoulders and said with an innocent face: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t wrongly accuse people. I am standing here, I didn\u2019t move a bit. It was First Aunt who fell on her own. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask her.\u201dBut, how can a person like Mrs. Liu tell the truth? Seeing that both of her sons were present, she wanted to use her two son\u2019s hands to teach Bai Zhi a lesson. So, she said: \u201cI am obviously pushed by you, how dare you to deny it?\u201dBai Zhi sneered: \u201cIf I lied I should be struck by lightning and died together with my sons, without a complete body. Do you dare to make a poisonous oath like that?\u201dIf she only needs to swear that she\u2019ll be struck by lightning if she lied, Mrs. Liu will naturally agree. But, Bai Zhi, that dead girl also wanted her to swear with her two sons. So naturally, she refuses. Her two sons were the ones she cherished the most. Regardless of whether this oath will come true or not, she couldn\u2019t take her two sons to swear.\u201cYou dead girl, how can your heart be so vicious? How can you speak such poisonous words? Aren\u2019t you scared of retribution?\u201d Mrs. Liu pointed her finger to Bai Zhi and said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: Yang SigenBai Zhi was not also willing to show weakness: \u201cRetribution? What are you saying? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, so why would I be scared? I am only standing here. People who secretly do bad things should be the one who must get worried about this so-called retribution.\u201dHow will Mrs. Liu know that things will get back to her? Mrs. Liu was so angry that she was trying her two sons teach Bai Zhi a lesson. But suddenly, she heard Old Lady Bai shouting out her inside the big house: \u201cWhat is all this noise? Get back here soon.\u201dMrs. Liu doesn\u2019t want to listen to the old lady\u2019s words, but in the end, she only pulled her two sons and leave.\u201cNiang, that dead girl, Bai Zhi, used the pork lard I saved and hurt me. Why aren\u2019t you letting Dabao and Xiaofeng teach her a lesson?\u201dOld Lady Bai took a deep breath and coldly snorted at Mrs. Liu: \u201cAre you crazy? Three days later, the Yang Family will come and pick her up. If you hurt her, how are you going to explain to the people after three days? Where is your brain?\u201dMrs. Liu suddenly realized it. Originally, her mother-in-law was considering this fact. No wonder they were not allowed to hurt that dead girl. Because after three days, the Bai Family no longer need to live with that dead girl. No one will go against her anymore.*At night, the villagers usually were gathering at the small river near the entrance to the village. Men were bathing in the upstream water, while the women were chatting and washing their clothes. The water in the river during the midsummer was very cold, so at this hour, most women only came to gossip and didn\u2019t wash clothes.\u201cHave you heard? Bai Zhi from the Bai Family suffered miserably this time under the old lady and Liu Shi\u2019s hands.\u201d\u201cEh? You mean that girl you came back to life? I just saw her and Zhao Lan strolling in the village this morning. What happened to her?\u201d\u201cI heard that Bai Zhi was badly hurt. Although she came back to life, she can no longer bear children. How will she get married in the future? So tell me, isn\u2019t that miserable?\u201d\u201cReally? With just a few hits, she can no longer bear a child? Who told you that?\u201d\u201cWho else, aside from Lu Dafu? Today, Lu Dafu and I went to the town. I asked him how is Bai Zhi\u2019s condition. Lu Dafu refused to tell me at first, but after asking for several times, he said in some difficulty that Bai Zhi\u2019s lower abdomen was damaged. She could no longer bear a child in the future.\u201d\u201cOh, this Bai Family are really too much. Bai Zhi is a clever child. How did she end up like this?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s because the old lady has a poisonous heart. When her husband and third son fell on the roof, they were also badly injured. But, Old Lady Bai was very reluctant to spend money on their medical treatment. In the end, her husband and third son died. Leaving Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi in the hands of those bullies. The Bai Family are not afraid of\u00a0retribution.\u201dThere were a lot of women chatting by the river. With just a simple sentence, in a blink of an eye, Bai Zhi, who was beaten by the Bai Family and can no longer bear a child, spread in the whole village.The Bai Family didn\u2019t go to the river to wash their laundry this time. They were very busy discussing about how they will spend the 20 silver coins. So, how can they come to the river to chat? The villagers know everything about the issue, but the Bai Family don\u2019t.Although the Baiyang Village and Huangtuo Village were separated by a few miles, there were relatives among the two villages. So, in just two days, the rumors about Bai Zhi\u2019s situation reached up to the Baiyang Village.Yang Sigen carefully inquired things about his future wife, so he learned that this Bai Zhi, was the same Bai Zhi that came out from Mrs. Liu\u2019s mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: Who said that Bai Zhi can\u2019t have children?\u201cFuck, that woman\u2019s courage is fat ah! She even dared to lie just to get my money? She dared to give me a chicken that can\u2019t lay eggs? Just wait and see, how I am going to clean her up!\u201d He was still wondering two days ago, how can a 12 or 13-year-old child be given to him as a wife, when he was already in his forties.So originally, that child was in such a condition. Fortunately, he hasn\u2019t picked up the person yet. Otherwise, he will fall into the Bai Family\u2019s trap.Yang Sigen gathered a few men from the same village. They were all strong and tall men. Just by lifting their sleeves can make the people feel scared and speechless.A group of seven to eight people came directly to the Huangtou Village. They came and look for the Bai Family. As soon as they learned where it was, they went immediately.When the villagers saw the appearance of those men, they knew right away that the Bai Family provoked someone. So, they also rushed to the Bai Family.The Bai Family was very busy these days. They don\u2019t have time to play around in the village.As if their life was scarce just like the other villagers.When\u00a0Yang Sigen arrived in the front yard of the Bai Family. He saw Mrs. Liu in the yard. As soon as he saw her, he immediately pushed open the door fence.Mrs. Liu was shocked. She doesn\u2019t know why seven or eight strange men suddenly break into their yard.She looked at them intently, so he recognized the man in front. The man was Yang Sigen, the man she met in the Baiyang Village. The very same person that gave her the 10 silver coins.When Yang Sigen saw Mrs. Liu\u2019s speechless appearance, he couldn\u2019t help but sneer: \u201cWhat? Only two days had passed, but you already can\u2019t recognize this old man?\u201dMrs. Liu frowned her eyebrows. This Yang Sigen\u2019s words were very vulgar and rude. This place belongs to the Bai Family. Her husband and sons were all presents. What if the people misunderstood the meaning of his words and think they were in that kind of relationship?\u201cYang Dage, how come you\u2019re here? Isn\u2019t it supposed to be after three days? Tomorrow is the third day!\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu saw many people were in their yard, although she was uncomfortable, she didn\u2019t dare to be rude.Yang Sigen sneered: \u201cThree days? After three days, so that you will send me a little chicken that can\u2019t lay eggs? Do you think I, Yang Sigen, is an incompetent fool?\u201dYang Sigen\u2019s voice was very loud. So, there was no need for the outsider to ask what was happening. Because they all heard it clearly.Mrs. Liu couldn\u2019t understand: \u201cWhat do you mean? What little chicken that can\u2019t lay eggs? Is there some kind of misunderstanding?\u201d\u201cMisunderstanding? Do you think I am a fool or deaf? Your Family\u2019s Bai Zhi was heavily injured and can\u2019t have children in the future. This case was known to everyone in the Huangtou Village. So tell me, is this a misunderstanding?\u201d Yang Sigen\u2019s became more and more agitated, so his voice became louder and louder.When the villagers heard those words, they immediately understood the inside story. It was very clear that the Bai Family kept this secret to the angry Yang Sigen, the man in front of them.Bai Zhi was less than 13 years old. This Yang Sigen killed his previous three wives and became an old bachelor, but the Bai Family let Bai Zhi get married to him? Does this mean they want her to die?The villagers shook their heads and secretly cursed the Bai Family. This family\u2019s ruthlessness was so extreme.When Old Lady Bai and Bai Erzhu heard a loud noise outside, they came out from the big house.Old Lady Bai frowned and swept her eyes to the group of men inside their yard. She was very unhappy: \u201cWhat happened? Who are these people?\u201dMrs. Liu whispered a few words to the old lady\u2019s ear and said what happened.Old Lady Bai\u2019s facial expression slightly changed, then she immediately said: \u201cThis is impossible. Who said that Bai Zhi can\u2019t have children, huh? Who said it? Let that person stand here and confront us.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you think you can still deceive the people in the Huangtou Village? This news has spread up to our Baiyang Village. Do you still dare to deny it? Do you think I, Yang Sigen, is easy to be bullied?\u201d He said as he revealed his strong arms.\u00a0 said\u00a0He licked his sleeves and revealed his strong arms.Yang Sigen work as a mason. He usually builds a house of the people and he does other physical work. So, when he pulled up his sleeves, people could see how strong he was.Old Lady Bai lived up to this age. If she easily gets scared, then she was not from the Bai Family. Old Lady Bai yelled at Yang Sigen: \u201cYou can\u2019t scare me. This is Huangtou Village,\u00a0not your Baiyang Village. You can\u2019t act wild here.\u201d\u201cI am wild? Good, good, I, Yang Sigen will let you know, the meaning of wild.\u201d Yang Sigen was so angry when the old lady looked down on him. He felt like she was simply slapping his face.\u201cBrothers, give me a hand.\u201d Then, he rushed inside the big house with a wooden stick. He smashed all the things inside and didn\u2019t let go a single thing.Seven or eight strong men followed Yang Sigen inside the big house. They also rushed with a wooden stick in their hand. They didn\u2019t even let go the door. Everything was ruined by them.Old Lady Bai was so anxious to jump and stop the bullies, but she didn\u2019t dare to go forward. With those people\u2019s strength, it was enough to smash her body like a pot.Old Lady Bai pulled Bai Xiofeng to the side and said: \u201cXiaofeng, hurry. You go to Village Chief Li\u2019s house and say that there are murderers in our village. They want to kill people and set a fire.\u201dBai Xiaofeng went outside in a hurry. Although Bai Erzhu and Bai Dazhu were big grown-up men, they don\u2019t have the courage to fight. They only stood there watching. They wanted to try to talk, but because of the loud smashing sounds, their voice couldn\u2019t be heard.*Zhao Lan wanted to go out and see the situation, but she was stopped by Bai Zhi: \u201cNiang, we can\u2019t go out now. In this situation, the old lady will not listen to anything we say. This is a natural incident. If we won\u2019t go out now, we can leave this hellish place today.\u201dZhao Lan\u2019s eyes lit up: \u201cIs what you\u2019re saying is true?\u201dBai Zhi smiled and nodded: \u201cOf course, it\u2019s true. When did I lie you?\u201dZhao Lan also thinks the same way. Now, everyone in the village knows that Bai Zhi can\u2019t have children in the future. This was a big trouble. And as long as a doctor will help them confirm this case to the Bai Family. Naturally, the Bai Family will refuse to keep feeding two useless people.The only choice was to separate.Thinking of this, Zhao Lan was in a good mood. She went back to her bed and sat down. She will wait for the Bai Family to call the two of them.When Bai Xiaofeng came back, the things inside the house where all smashed. Even the big tank in the backyard was not spared. His small shed for his study, and as well the pots in the kitchen were all destroyed.Old Lady Bai sat on the ground and cried. She swears and swears until she gets exhausted.\u201cStop, what are you guys doing? Why are you smashing things?\u201d Although he was an old man now. His body still has the atmosphere of a real elder. He can confront Yang Sigen and the others.Yang Sigen walked outside the big house with the wooden stick in his hand and asked: \u201cWho are you? Are you also from this Bai Family?\u201dVillage Chief Li said: \u201cI am the chief of the Huangtou Village. I am asking you, why are you causing trouble for no reason?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: Is I, Yang Sigen easy to be trifled with?\u201cFor no reason? It seems that you are ignorant of what\u2019s happening here. Okay, I will tell you why I am here and why I am smashing their things.\u201dYang Sigen turned his head to find Mrs. Liu\u2019s figure in the yard. Then, he pointed his finger on her: \u201cThis Liu Shi went to our Baiyang Village and said that there is a girl in their family that is looking for a husband. So, she asked everyone if there was a suitable family.\u201d\u201cThe bachelor in the Baiyang village is quite a lot. I am only one among them. After Liu Shi asked a few families, she had chosen me in the end. At that time, we made an agreement. I decided to give her 10 silver coins as advance payment. After 3 days, I will pick up the girl and give the rest of the money.\u201dWhen Village Chief Li heard this, there was something in his heart that he couldn\u2019t understand. Village Chief Li swept his cold eyes to the old lady and Mrs. Liu. Those two evil women were becoming more and more outrageous. How old Bai Zhi to be married to such a fierce and sinister old man? He\u2019s afraid that this man was even older than\u00a0Bai Erzhu, right?Yang Sigen continued to speak: \u201cIt was originally a happy event. I already prepared everything at home. I am only waiting for the agreed schedule. But today, I unexpectedly heard that this girl, Bai Zhi, was badly injured a few days ago. Because of this, she can no longer bear a child. So tell me, why should I keep a woman who can\u2019t give birth? To have some decoration at home?\u201dVillage Chief Li nodded his head: \u201cEven so, it doesn\u2019t mean, you can just smash things here, right?\u201dYang Sigen replied: \u201cI also don\u2019t want to do this. That\u2019s why, I talked to them, but they didn\u2019t listen. They said that I am only talking nonsense. They refuse to admit that they were lying. They didn\u2019t also try to inquire. Say, is I, Yang Sigen, easy to be trifled with?\u201dOld Lady Bai hurriedly climbed up from the ground and pointed her finger at Yang Sigen: \u201cNonsense. How can Bai Zhi not bear a child? Who\u2019s bastard said that? If there is such a case, why I, the grandmother, doesn\u2019t know this?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu also opened her mouth and said: \u201cYes, I also don\u2019t know this matter. Bai Zhi was in a good condition. She even went digging up wild vegetables yesterday.\u201dYang Sigen pointed his finger to Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu: \u201cYou see, I am trying to reason out with them, but what did they say? Did they admit it?\u201dVillage Chief Li pondered for a moment, then said: \u201cSince that is the case, it\u2019s better to ask a doctor to come and see. Let\u2019s make Lu Dafu clear things in front of everyone, how about that?\u201dYang Sigen naturally agreed: \u201cWell, I will listen to you.\u201dOld Lady Bai was a bit hesitant. This matter was better off unchecked. After all, even if Yang Sigen knew about this matter, if the truth was kept hidden, then her 20 silver coins will not fly away.But at this moment, it seems that she can\u2019t refuse.Old Lady Bai can only bite the bullet and said: \u201cGo, go and call a doctor. Who\u2019s afraid of who?\u201dOld Lady Bai then walked towards Mrs. Liu and wink: \u201cWhat are you still waiting for? Go and ask Lu Dafu to come over.\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu and Old Lady Bai have been mother-in-law for more than decades. So, she understood the meaning of this wink. She immediately answered right away and planning to go out, but she saw Doctor Lu squeezing out himself to the crowd.Doctor Lu smiled and said: \u201cI just came back from the town and saw a big crowd. So, I came over to take a look. But, I didn\u2019t expect that someone will mention me.\u201dOld Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu\u2019s face drastically changed. Their relationship with Doctor Lu was bad. They still owed him 6 silver coins. So, even if they call him, he wouldn\u2019t come. But now that he\u2019s here if he diagnosed Bai Zhi\u2019s condition, will things end up good?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: Returning the moneyOld Lady Bai was still thinking whether she would say that Bai Zhi was not at home. However, she suddenly saw Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan came out from their wooden house.They came out, so why they didn\u2019t come out a bit earlier? Obviously, they simply wanted to slap her face.Inside her heart, Old Lady Bai cursed in anger.When Village Chief Li saw Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan came out, he said to Doctor Lu: \u201cYou check Zhi Er\u2019s condition, see if the rumor\u2019s saying that Zhi\u2019er cannot have children in the future is true.\u201dDoctor Lu opened his mouth said: \u201cWhen I looked at Zhi Er\u2019s condition last time, I learned that her lower abdomen was damaged. It will be difficult for her to conceive in the future. However, at that time, it was not that serious yet. It can be nourished back, and recovering is possible. I will check her condition again to see if it\u2019s still the same as last time.\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai heard this, her heart became cold\u2026 \u2026Doctor Lu came forward and checked Bai Zhi\u2019s pulse. While pretending to be counting numbers, he frowned his eyebrows and said: \u201cWhat happened? Why her injury to the lower abdomen became more serious than before?\u201d After he finished, Doctor Lu turned his head and looked at the old lady with a face saying \u2018Didn\u2019t I said, you should help her recover?\u2019Bai Zhi sighed and said with grievances: \u201cI am no longer expecting to recover, I just hope that I can eat a meal each day. Everyone, I\u2019m not trying to deceive you, but ever since Niang was injured 3 days ago. We, mother and child only had two meals of a bowl of gruel and a bowl of wild vegetables. The rest was eaten by them.\u201dOld Lady Bai shouted in anger: \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? Didn\u2019t you intentionally return home late? So, who\u2019s fault it is that you missed the time of meal?\u201dBai Zhi shrunk back her neck in fear. She looked very scared and didn\u2019t dare to open her mouth again.When Village Chief Li saw this, he said: \u201cIf they missed the meal time, they deserved to starve? Don\u2019t you know how to left foods to those people who work outside? Seeing you like this, it seems you haven\u2019t reflected on your actions yet. Tell me, what did this child do, to be bullied by you?\u201dYang Sigen butted in and said: \u201cI am not interested in participating in their conflicts. I want them to forget this marriage agreement and return my money.\u201dIn regards to this statement, it was time for the Bai Family to return the money. But, how can Old Lady Bai be willing? Yang Sigen smashed their things, but he wanted them to return his money?\u201cYes, our Bai Family did received your 10 silver coins, but you have smashed our things today. How many of our things have you destroyed huh? I\u2019m afraid to say that, your 10 silver coins are not enough!\u201dWhen Yang Sigen heard this, his ferociousness was revealed, he immediately shouted: \u201cYes, I did smash your things, but that is to give you a face. Otherwise, if this stick falls on you, you\u2019re not in this condition anymore.\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai heard this, she couldn\u2019t help but step back. However, although she was afraid, her mouth didn\u2019t stop: \u201cIt\u2019s illegal to beat people for no reason. If you dare to do it, I will go to the town and report you.\u201dYang Sigen coldly replied: \u201cThat reminds me, marriage fraud is a very serious crime, I\u2019ll give you that 10 silver coins as compensation to your broken things. But, I will go to the town and report your crime. I want your whole Bai Family to go to prison.\u201dWhen Mrs. Liu heard this, she became anxious and immediately said: \u201cNiang, just give back his money. We can\u2019t become prisoners. There is Xiaofeng. Xiaofeng will become an official in the future. How will he become one, if we go there? We must absolutely not!\u201dOld Lady Bai also became anxious. She tried calculating inside her heart. If Mrs. Liu will go to prison, she will only be jailed for a few days. But, if she will also be caught, she\u2019s afraid that she will fail to keep the 10 silver coins!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: The silver coins flew awayAfter making calculations for several times, Old Lady Bai finally opened her mouth. She pulled out a fake smile with her blackened face, then said: \u201cI have something to say, I have something to say. I was only confused earlier. Now, I understand, I understand it.\u201dYang Sigen was not really trying to sue the Bai Family. However, 10 silver coins were not a small amount, so how can he just let them take it? If they were not willing to return it, it was naturally best to do this trick.\u201cEnough of this nonsense, just give my money back as soon as possible. Then, I will give you a face and let this thing pass.\u201d Yang Sigen answered back immediately.Village Chief Li nodded his head: \u201cThat\u2019s good. Old lady, are you still not going to give back his money?\u201d Village Chief Li knew very well how extreme Old Lady Bai\u2019s greed was. It was not an easy task to make her pull out the money in her pocket. Fortunately, Yang Sigen was a strong person. If it was someone else, who knows how things will end.In\u00a0front of someone like Yang Sigen, even if Old Lady Bai wanted to play with words, it will be useless. It was very obvious that Yang Sigen was more ruthless than her. She was good in setting up people, but in front of Yang Sigen, everything will be useless.Old Lady Bai was helpless. In the end, she went inside the big house and took the pouch with 10 silver coins. The pain she felt inside her heart was unimaginable. She felt like someone was cutting her flesh.Yang Sigen grabbed the small pouch to the old lady\u2019s hand. Then, he opened it and counted the money.Yang Sigen headed towards Village Chief Li and said: \u201cChief, I am thankful for your help today, I will not overdo it again next time.\u201d Yang Sigen, who has an iron looking face finally smiled a bit.Village Chief Li nodded his head: \u201cGo back to your home now. Remember, don\u2019t be too impulsive next time. If you need something, we can discuss it well.\u201dYang Sigen nodded his head again and again: \u201cChief, I have to say goodbye now.\u201d He was very respectful to Village Chief Li, but he was actually doesn\u2019t care too much. Some people can be reasonable to talk to, but others need to show their real color first before they talk.When Yang Sigen took his companion away, Old Lady Bai\u2019s fierceness came out again. She pointed her finger to Bai Zhi and said: \u201cThis is all your fault that those silver coins for your mother\u2019s hand treatment flew away. Now tell me, how are you going to pay?\u201dBai Zhi shrugged her shoulders and looked at Old Lady Bai coldly. \u201cGrandmother, you should speak reasonably. How can this be my fault? I am injured by you, you\u2019re also the one who look for marriage candidate outside the village. The money was also collected by you. In the final analysis, it was all because of your ruthless means. From top to bottom, I didn\u2019t do anything regarding this matter, right?\u201dOld Lady Bai\u2019s heart was filled with anger. How can Bai Zhi speak like that to her? Old Lady Bai leaned forward and picked up the wooden stick that was left by Yang Sigen. After picking it up, she rushed towards Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan: \u201cToday, in order to eliminate this anger in my heart, I\u2019ll make sure to kill you, two monks.\u201dDoctor Lu and Village Chief Li rushed forward to stop the old lady. Doctor Lu immediately said: \u201cOld lady, don\u2019t tell me that I didn\u2019t remind you, Bai Zhi was beaten by you. Zhao Lan\u2019s hand was abolished by you. She can no longer do a heavy work in the future. If you hurt her hand again, I\u2019m afraid that she\u2019ll even fail to feed herself. Can you take care of her for a lifetime?\u201dThis sentence was like a thunder that hit the Bai Family\u2019s head and made them dizzy.Zhao Lan was the one who works in the field. If she can no longer work in there, who will do it?If her hand became a waste, does that mean she can no longer work in the field anymore?Bai Dazhu and Bai Erzhu no longer felt bitter. Rather, they were regretting that\u2014 they don\u2019t know how to go easy. Now, what should they do?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: SeparationIt\u2019s just\u00a0a pity, there was no medicine for regret in this world.Village Chief Li also opened his mouth: \u201cNow that things became like this, you can only blame yourself. Your heart is too poisonous. Your hands are too ruthless. You both harm Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan. How do you think can this mother and child live in the future?\u201dOld Lady Bai turned around and faced Doctor Lu: \u201cLu Dafu, do you think you have the final say if they are gravely ill or not? Did you made an agreement with them and then tell us a lie?\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu coldly snorted: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, you can take the mother and child to the town. Then, look for the best doctor. With that, you will see, if I, Li Zhangchun is lying or not, right?\u201dHowever, with Old Lady Bai\u2019s character, how could she bring Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan to the town to seek medical treatment, right? That would be very impossible.Bai Zhi hurriedly added some oil to the fire: \u201cGrandmother, I also think, it will be better if you will bring me and niang to the town to find another doctor. Maybe, my illness and my niang\u2019s injuries can be cured, right?\u201dOld Lady Bai glared at Bai Zhi: \u201cDon\u2019t call me, grandmother. I don\u2019t have a granddaughter like you. You don\u2019t deserve to be in the Bai Family.\u201dWhen Bai Zhi heard the old lady\u2019s words, she immediately asks with a cold face: \u201cGrandmother, what do you mean? Are we separating?\u201dOld Lady Bai snorted: \u201cSeparating? What are you in this family? Why should I divide my property? What are you trying to calculate? How dare you to try grabbing this old lady\u2019s land?\u201dVillage Chief Li frowned: \u201cThat can\u2019t be, Zhao Lan is the wife of Bai Sanzhu. Bai Sanzhu is part of the Bai Family. So, how can you say that to Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi? Why can\u2019t they get their share in the Bai Family?\u201dRight now, everyone was not pleasing to Old Lady Bai\u2019s eyes. So, she didn\u2019t even put Village Chief Li to her eyes: \u201cThis is our family\u2019s affairs, outsiders shouldn\u2019t intervene. Right now, I am the head of the Bai Family, I will divide my property as I pleased.\u201dBai Zhi said: \u201cLi Bo, it seems this is the case for me and my niang. If grandmother refuses to give us our share, we will not force her. I am only asking Li Bo, to please help us write a separation agreement letter. That whether we became poorer or richer in the future, we, mother and daughter have no relationship to the Bai Family anymore.\u201dOld Lady Bai also wanted to avoid this situation. She doesn\u2019t want this mother and daughter to come back and eat in their family when they suffered in the future.Village Chief Li looked at the old lady: \u201cIs this final?\u201dOld Lady Bai nodded her head: \u201cIt\u2019s final. Now, I want them to separate from us. I don\u2019t want to see them for another minute. Let them leave immediately. It\u2019s best if they will not appear in front of me again.\u201dAs if, who would like to see you?\u00a0Bai Zhi sneers inside her heart:\u00a0Even if you kneel in front of me and beg me to eat with you, I will never come to see you anymore.Village Chief Li borrowed a paper and ink to Doctor Lu. And soon, three copies of the separation agreement letter were made. One was handed to Old Lady Bai, one was handed to Bai Zhi and the last one was for himself. As to have an evidence, if there will be a dispute in the future.Old Lady Bai asked Bai Xiaofeng to help her read the written words in the agreement letter.On the other side, Mrs. Liu\u2019s voice sounded: \u201cCan you even read? Why do you keep staring at it? A cheap girl like you, pretending to be educated, are you not afraid of people to laugh at you?\u201dBai Zhi has already finished reading the agreement letter in her hands, so she lifted her eyes and looked at Mrs. Liu. Then, she vaguely said: \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s son was, although had been going to school for years, his exam results are the worst. Can such a person become a big official in the future? That is really laughable. I\u2019m afraid, he can\u2019t even pass the student test.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: Anxious to live apartBai Xiaofeng\u2019s examination result was unknown to the Bai Family. So, when they heard Bai Zhi\u2019s statement, they naturally didn\u2019t believe her. In their eyes, Bai Xiaofeng will become a big official in the future. There was no mistake.Mrs.\u00a0Liu pointed her finger to Bai Zhi: \u201cYou little monk, now that you\u2019re leaving, you\u2019re discrediting our family\u2019s Xiaofeng? Our Xiaofeng treated you so well. You are just really a white-eyed wolf.\u201dBai Xiaofeng treated me so well?\u00a0Hahaha\u2014 treating her like a slave was good? When he was eating, he didn\u2019t even give her a share. When he was taking a nap, she had to stand around and keep fanning him. When she stopped, she will be punished. Can you call that good treatment?Bai Zhi was too lazy to argue with Mrs. Liu. It was too boring. In this family, the white will always be black. They have no sense of shame. It was only a waste of energy to argue with their nonsense.Zhao Lan has already pressed her fingerprint on the agreement letter. Old Lady Bai also pressed her fingerprint when Bai Xiaofeng nodded his head. After this, these two irrelevant people have no ties with them.When Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan returned inside their wooden house, they pick up and carried out their already packed up things.Mrs.\u00a0Liu rushed forward and took the baggage from Bai Zhi\u2019s hand. In front of everyone, she shook away the things inside. But, there was nothing but a few rag clothes.Bai Zhi looked at Mrs. Liu with cold eyes: \u201cLiu Guihua, remember this, this will be the last time I will tolerate your rudeness. If I met you in the village and you dared to be rude again, I will also be rude to you.\u201dWhen Bai Dazhu saw his wife was being called directly by her name, he rushed forward to help: \u201cYou dead girl, who do you think you are talking to? Who gave you such a courage, huh?\u201dBai Zhi pointed her finger to Bai Dazhu, then she pointed it to everyone else in the Bai Family. She said word by word: \u201cI\u2019m not only saying this to Liu Guihua, but also to every one of the Bai Family. Starting today, if your Bai Family dare to act rudely to me and my mother again, don\u2019t blame me for not being polite.\u201dBai Zhi\u2019s voice was clear and crisp. Every word fell into everyone\u2019s ears clearly. They can sense that she was not joking.After that, Bai Zhi took Zhao Lan\u2019s hand and turned away. She walked away in the Bai Family\u2019s courtyard without a trace of nostalgia.When they left, Old Lady Bai opened her mouth and said: \u201cHow can they leave so peacefully? In this situation, aren\u2019t that mother and daughter suppose to cry in front of us and beg us not to let them separate?\u201d\u201cShe still wishes for them to stay?\u201dAfter he said those words, Village Chief Li waved his sleeve and walked away. On the other hand, Doctor Lu didn\u2019t hurry to go. He said to Old Lady Bai: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you still owe me 6 silver coins. When the time comes, I will come and pick it up.\u201dOld Lady Bai was looking at Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan, who was drifting away. Then suddenly, she had an idea. She said: \u201cLu Dafu, we can\u2019t give you the money. Zhao Lan is now not a part of the Bai Family. You have to go and find her to get your money.\u201dDoctor\u00a0Lu knew that this old lady will play some tricks again. So, he was already prepared inside his heart. He answered her with: \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. I can go and get the 2 silver coins to Zhao Lan, but the 4 silver coins were for Bai Dazhu\u2019s treatment. Don\u2019t tell me, you also want me to get those silvers to Zhao Lan?Old Lady Bai couldn\u2019t make a sound. Bai Dazhu was injured by Hu Feng, it has nothing to do with Zhao Lan.Doctor Lu secretly snorted, then he picked up his medicine box and left.After they finished watching the excitement, a few carpenters stayed and opened their mouth: \u201cOld lady, your house became like this. I\u2019m afraid you have to re-build your furniture. We are all here. We are village folks, we can give you a discount, how about that?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: Buying LandWhen her broken furniture was mentioned by the carpenters, Old Lady Bai became very annoyed.As soon as the few carpenters saw the old lady\u2019s distorted face, they left in a hurry.Looking at her house that was in a mess, Old Lady Bai\u2019s heart felt at lost and empty.Bai Dabao entered the big house and went outside again. Then, he said to Old Lady Bai: \u201cGrandmother, the pots and bowls are all broken, how are we going to eat today?\u201d\u201cEat? Is that all the thing you know? Why don\u2019t you hurry and clean up the house instead, huh?\u201d When Mrs. Liu saw her mother-in-law\u2019s face was not good, she hurriedly pulled her son away.*After Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan left the Bai Family, they directly went to Hu Changlin\u2019s house.Bai Zhi had already discussed this issue with Hu Changlin in advanced. That once they separated from the Bai Family, they will borrow their cabin for a while.So, when\u00a0Hu Changlin saw them coming in with their belongings, he immediately came forward and grinned: \u201cSuccess?\u201dBai Zhi nodded her head and said: \u201cSuccess, we are now separated from the Bai Family. We no longer have any relationship with them.\u201dHu Changlin sighed: \u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good, now they can\u2019t beat you two again.\u201dAt this time, Village Chief Li, who passed by Hu Changlin\u2019s house, saw Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan standing in the courtyard. So, he also went inside and asked Zhao Lan: \u201cZhao Lan, what are you planning to do now?\u201dZhao Lan has many plans, but now, she only listens to her daughter. She follows every plan she made.Zhao Lan shook her head: \u201cDon\u2019t ask me Chief, you should ask Zhi\u2019er, she already has plans.\u201dVillage Chief Li raise an eyebrow and look at Bai Zhi: \u201cZhi\u2019er, let\u2019s talk about it. What are you two girls planning in the future?\u201dBai Zhi was actually planning to look for Village Chief Li to discuss this matter, but now that he\u2019s here, it saves her a lot of time.\u201cLi Bo, we don\u2019t have a place to live. We can only live in Hu Bo\u2019s cabin house for now, but we can\u2019t always live here. We want to have our own lot. I don\u2019t know if you can help us find a good place\u201dVillage Chief Li knew a lot of vacant land in the village, but he can\u2019t just give it away easily.Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi were considered to be people in the Huangtou Village. They were now separated from the Bai Family, so it is only reasonable to want to have their own place. However, if they want to have their own lot, they have to pay a necessary amount of tax in the government.Seeing Village Chief Li\u2019s embarrassing face, Bai Zhi immediately added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to deceive Li Bo, I was able to dig out medicinal herbs a few days ago. Lu Dafu help me to sell them in the town. Although it\u2019s not much, it\u2019s enough to let us buy a lot.\u201dAs soon as Village Chief Li heard this, he couldn\u2019t help but smile: \u201cThis girl, it seems you have been prepared. I was worried about your mother and child, but it seems I shouldn\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u201dBai Zhi laughed and said: \u201cNo need to worry. But, if there are no good people around us like Li Bo and Hu Bo, I\u2019m sure we will be very sad in the future.\u201d\u201cBy the way, we\u2019re not just planning to buy a lot, but also a field. Even if we have a house, if there is no field, we can\u2019t live a good life in the future.\u201dVillage Chief Li nodded his head: \u201cThere is no problem. There are lots and fields available. I will talk to the officials to reduce the price as much as possible, so things will get easier.\u201dVillage Chief Li then looked at Zhao Lan\u2019s hand and said: \u201cBut, didn\u2019t Lu Dafu said Zhao Lan cannot do a heavy work anymore? If you bought a field, you will have to work on your own, can you do it alone?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: MovingZhao Lan answered: \u201cMy hand will be cured soon. Lu Dafu was forced to bluff in front of the Bai Family. Otherwise, those people will not allow us to separate.\u201dThis thing shouldn\u2019t be said at this point in time, but Zhao Lan had already mentioned it. So, Bai Zhi had to open her mouth too: \u201cLi Bo, this matter, please keep it a secret. If the Bai Family learned this, they will definitely make a ruckus. We don\u2019t care about what they will do to us, but we\u2019re afraid they will blame Lu Dafu for this and use this opportunity to forget their account to him.\u201dVillage Chief Li nodded his head again and again: \u201cI understand, rest assured, this thing will rot in my stomach. I will say nothing.\u201d Village Chief Li laughed up straight, the last worry in his heart had disappeared.After a long talk, Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi took their things and went to the cabin. When they opened the door, the two of them was stunned by the scene inside.The cabin house was no longer the former cabin house. The sundries that had been piled up inside has all been cleared out. There was now a bed in the room. The bed has new bedding and two embroidered pillows. A small window was newly built on the wall, and a curtain was hanging on it.In the corner, there was a two-story shelf with two new basins and a dressing table. There was also a bronze mirror on it. Although it was not exquisite, it made Zhao Lan cried in excitement.Everyone knew that when she married Bai\u00a0Sanzhu, she didn\u2019t experience such good treatment. She didn\u2019t even had a new bed during their wedding.Not to mention, after Bai Sanzhu died, she and her daughter didn\u2019t even saw a bronze mirror.It was just a few simple types of furniture, but Zhao Lan\u2019s tears couldn\u2019t stop.Living in such a room made her feel like she was a person!Hu Feng, who was carrying a bucket of water walked towards the cabin house. In there, he saw tears on Zhao Lan\u2019s face but she was laughing, while Bai Zhi was calmly comforting her mother. Hu Feng put down the bucket and said to Bai Zhi: \u201cYou cook the dinner, the pheasants are already been chopped.\u201dBai Zhi turned to look at Hu Feng, a tall figure was standing at the door. Against the light, she couldn\u2019t see the expression on his face, but she could clearly feel his goodwill.\u201cHu Feng, thank you.\u201dHu Feng swept his eyes to the newly-built things in the house, he bought every one of them.Thinking about their previous living environment, he naturally understood the current mood of the mother and child.\u201cThese things are bought with the money you earned. You don\u2019t have to thank me, I only used some strength.\u201d Hu Feng said calmly.\u201cThank you, it\u2019s not like, everyone is willing to give strength towards us.\u201dThere were many people in the village who sympathize with them, but they only used their mouth at most. They secretly condemn the Bai Family, but who actually lend them a hand?Hu Feng stared at Bai Zhi\u2019s eyes and small face, her eyes were like stars that brightly shines in the night: \u201cIf you really want to thank me, then do a good job in today\u2019s dinner. That will serve as your repayment to me.\u201dBai Zhi\u00a0suddenly smiled, her lips curved into a beautiful smile like a myrtle flower, revealing her white teeth: \u201cI won\u2019t let you down.\u201dWhen Hu Feng left, Bai Zhi brought the bucket of water towards her mother to wash her face: \u201cNiang, look at you, if others see you like this, they will laugh at you.\u201dZhao Lan smirked and laughed, her face was a bit glowing in red: \u201cI want to die. Hu Feng has seen me. I don\u2019t know what he thinks about me. It is really shameful.\u201dBai Zhi helped Zhao Lan to wipe her face and also wiped her face. Then, she smiled and said: \u201cHu Feng had seen nothing. He is not a person who loves to talk. He will not think too much about it, you can rest assured.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: Good matchZhao Lan looked at her daughter and smiled: \u201cYou and Hu Feng really hit off ah.\u201dBai Zhi smiled and replied: \u201cNiang, what are you saying? Hu Feng and I are only helping each other. There is nothing into it. Don\u2019t think too much about it.\u201dA man likes Hu Feng, who was handsome, mysterious, strong and full of charm. No young girls wouldn\u2019t like him.However, such a man can also be very dangerous.Although his life was seemingly harmless, once he recovers his memories, everything will change. And this change will be something not every woman can bear.She was sure he was not an ordinary person. He knows how to read and write, he knows martial arts, his temperamental was extraordinary. And on his body, there were many sword scars. These scars were obviously not acquired in the same period of time, it was accumulated over the years.How can there be so many sword scars on the body of an ordinary person?\u00a0She was only a small farmer in a mountain village. She doesn\u2019t want to get involved in this mysterious man.Zhao Lan smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019m not thinking too much. But, I\u2019m afraid\u00a0that, you being Hu Feng\u2019s little wife\u00a0already spread in the whole village.\u201dBai Zhi laughed and waved her hand: \u201cThose people has no other thing to do, aside to catch wind all day. Let\u2019s just live our own life and pave our own path.\u201dZhao Lan still wanted to say something, but she was interrupted by Bai Zhi: \u201cNiang, let\u2019s go and make dinner, the time is not too early.\u201dWhen\u00a0Zhao Lan saw that her daughter doesn\u2019t like to talk about this topic, she had to close her mouth. However, she likes Hu Feng, he was matured and steady. He doesn\u2019t talk much, but he was strong and has no bad habits. If her daughter can really marry Hu Feng, they will be a good match.*In the Bai Family, everyone was sighing while cleaning up the house. Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu looked at all the smashed furniture. Their heart was screaming in pain and sorrow. Those things cost a lot of money, but they have to buy them all again. Old Lady Bai had saved a little money over the years, but it seemed she had to spend it.Bai Dabao was cleaning up the smashed frame in the corner. When he picked up the broken frame, he saw a green colored jade ornament sticking out from it.\u201cEh, what is this?\u201d Bai Dabao\u2019s voice was very loud. As he spoke, he quickly dropped the broken frame and picked up the jade ornament.When Old Lady Bai and Mrs. Liu heard his voice, they quickly came over.Mrs. Liu\u2019s sharp eyes stared at straight at the jade ornament. Although she didn\u2019t have any valuable jewelry, she could distinguish some qualities of it.She could tell that the jade ornament in Bai Dabao\u2019s hand has a good quality in just one glance. The radiant jade ornament was carved with a laughing Buddha. The laughing Buddha was colored green, the rest was colored white. However, the most distinguished part of it was, on the right hand of the Buddha, he was holding a fingertip size orchid. And this fingertip sized orchid was colored red. As if it was a drop of blood. It looks very special.Mrs. Liu took the jade ornament on Bai Dabao\u2019s hand, then said: \u201cThis is my dowry. How come it\u2019s with you?\u201d Mrs. Liu\u2019s desperately winked at Bai Dabao as she spoke.Bai Dabao has been staring at the jade ornament, so he didn\u2019t see that his mother has been winking her eyes towards him.Old Lady Bai grew old up to this age, how can she not noticed Mrs. Liu\u2019s eyes movement? And how can she let Mrs. Liu succeed?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: Laughing Buddha Jade OrnamentOld Lady Bai stretched out her arm and took the jade ornament from Mrs. Liu\u2019s hand: \u201cYour dowry? Your Liu Family was so poor to the point that you can\u2019t even eat rice, but you were saying this is your dowry? Who are you trying to fool?\u201dMrs. Liu was very\u00a0dissatisfied, so she opened her mouth and debated: \u201cMy Liu Family is poor, but were are not stingy people. This jade ornament was passed down by our ancestor. So, what so strange if I said it\u2019s my dowry?\u201dOld Lady Bai coldly sneered and said: \u201cThat would be very strange. Your brother is too poor, that\u2019s why even at the age of 30, he can\u2019t find a wife to marry.\u00a0 So tell me, will your parents rather give this valuable thing to you than to your brother and let him stay a bachelor? If you wanted to convince people, make your words believable.\u201dMrs. Liu\u2019s face reddens: \u201cThis valuable thing can only be passed down to women. That\u2019s why it was with me. What is wrong with that?\u201dOld Lady Bai stared at Mrs. Liu and immediately yelled at Bai Dazhu: \u201cDazhu, come over here.\u201dBai Dazhu was originally sitting in the backyard, so when he heard his mother words, he rushed over: \u201cNiang, are you looking for me?\u201dOld Lady Bai asked: \u201cWhen your wife married in the family, aside from a rugged quilt, did she brought something else as a dowry?\u201dBai Dazhu immediately shook his head: \u201cNo, except for a rugged quilt, there was nothing else. Oh! There were clothes, but those were her niang\u2019s old clothes.\u201dOld Lady Bai turned her head and looked at Mrs. Liu: \u201cDid you hear that?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu still wants to argue, but Old Lady Bai impatiently waved her hand: \u201cShut up, don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know what kind of people your Liu Family is. Before you were born, three children of your family died from hunger. If there is this valuable thing will they die? And will your parents let you marry in our Bai Family?\u201dMrs.\u00a0Liu knew that it was useless to say anything again. But, she glared at her husband and son. She really regretted it. If she picks up that thing first, the old lady wouldn\u2019t be able to take it away.Old Lady Bai knew that this jade ornament was a very valuable thing. After looking at it carefully, she hides it in her sleeve and said to Bai Dabao: \u201cDabao, where did you find this thing? Is there something else?\u201dBai\u00a0Dabao pointed his finger to the two broken frame, then said: \u201cIt seems it fallen from the frame. There is nothing else.\u201dOld Lady Bai picked up the broken frame and carefully examined it again and again. In there, she found a small slit that seemed have been cut for a long time. If no accident happened and the frame didn\u2019t split into two, no one will notice it.Bai\u00a0Dabao asked: \u201cGrandmother, how can there me a jade ornament in this frame?\u201dOld Lady Bai shook her head: \u201cI don\u2019t know. This frame was bought in a store from the town 10 years ago. It was a second-hand good. Maybe the first owner hid it inside, but who cares? This thing is now in our Bai Family, so this jade ornament is ours.\u201dBai Dabao pulled the old lady\u2019s arm: \u201cGrandmother, this thing is expensive, right? We might get more money in this than selling Bai Zhi.\u201d Because they failed to sell Bai Zhi, he also faces a dilemma in his marriage. But now that they have such a treasure, he can even look for a wife up to the next village.Old Lady Bai took the jade ornament in her sleeve. She looked at the front and back side. She knew that this was a very valuable thing, but she doesn\u2019t know how much it cost, so she said: \u201cSuch a very valuable thing, how can we sell it? We can use it as family\u2019s heirloom. If people cheated us with the price, won\u2019t we lose much more?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I am the eldest son of this family and Dabao is the eldest grandchild. This treasure is supposed to be passed to us.\u201dOld Lady Bai looked at Bai Dazhu and coldly snorted: \u201cI haven\u2019t died yet, so what are you talking about? When I die, this thing will naturally pass on to you. Why are you so anxious?\u201dWhen Old Lady Bai finished, she turned around and went inside her room. She sat beside the window and stared at the jade ornament. The more she stared at it, the more she liked it. She thinks Mrs. Liu and Bai Dazhu wanted it, so she simply put a red tie on it and hangs it on her neck. She\u2019ll wait and see if those two can steal it on her body.*In the\u00a0Hu familyAfter eating dinner, Hu Changlin took out all the money that Doctor Lu gave to him.\u201cZhi\u2019er, here is a total of 195 silver coins. Lu Dafu sold the wild ginseng for a total of 200 silver coins. He took his share of 10 silver coins from the shopkeeper himself. He handed the 200 silver coins to us. Yesterday, I and Hu Feng went to the town and bought something for you and your niang. We spent 5 silver coins in total. So, here\u2019s the 195 silver coins left.\u201dWhen Bai Zhi came closer, she divided the silver coins into two parts. But, she kept a little less to herself. He gave more to Hu Changlin.\u201cHu Bo, these are for you, you can buy the things you want. You can use it as soon as you want to.\u201dBai Zhi took out a small clothe and wrapped her silver coins. Then, she pushed it towards Hu Changlin: \u201cHu Bo, please keep this for me. We just separated from the Bai Family. If they learned about this, they will definitely come to us and cause trouble. These silver coins are not safe in us. I will take it back when I needed to use it.\u201dHu Changlin knew Bai Zhi\u2019s character. He knew she divided it like this not to show she was generous or faking kindness. But rather, because it was decided like this before. If he refuses, it will appear that he was being sentimental.So, Hu Changlin simply nodded his head: \u201cWell, I will help you keep it first. Just take it whenever you want.\u201dBai Zhi thought for a moment, then she took out 5 silver coins from the small clothing: \u201cTomorrow, niang and I will go to town to buy a few changed of clothes. We will leave first thing in the morning, as to avoid making too much noise.\u201dZhao Lan busily said: \u201cI have clothes to wear, you don\u2019t need to buy me one. Just by two sets of clothes for yourself.\u201dIn this aspect, when she and her roommate was watching on TV. Her roommates told her that all the parents in the world are the same. They were very reluctant to eat and drink because they want to save everything for their children.Bai Zhi felt very uncomfortable at the time, she wanted to tell her roommate that not all parents are like that. Because if they were all the same, why she was so unlucky? She didn\u2019t have a good parent.However, it\u2019s not the same now, she has a good mother that really loves her.Bai Zhi\u2019s eyes became teary, she said with redden eyes: \u201cNiang what are you saying? Didn\u2019t all your clothes are rugged and torn now? We should buy a new one. We don\u2019t have money to spend before, but now we have some. Why do you still need to wrong yourself?\u201dZhao Lan said: \u201cThere are plenty of ways to spend money. But, we have to save for the future. I am old now, so no matter what I wear it\u2019s still the same. You don\u2019t need to spend money on me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: DumplingsBai Zhi sat down beside her mother, took her hand, half joking and half-heartedly said: \u201cNiang, don\u2019t you believe me? In the future, our days will get even better and better. These 200 silver coins are just the beginning,\u00a0I will make more money to let you live a good life. So, what buying two sets of clothes can count on?\u201dZhao Lan was very touched, she took her daughter\u2019s hand and held it tightly: \u201cWell, my daughter is good. My daughter has a good heart, niang is already very satisfied.\u201d*The next morning, Bai Zhi got up early, and after washing her face, she went to the front house of the Hu family to cook breakfast. When Zhao Lan arrived, the fragrant porridge and side dishes were already arranged on the table.Hu Changlin\u2019s eyes widen: \u201cZhi Er\u2019s craft is really good. It\u2019s the same porridge, but it\u2019s exceptionally fragrant, making you all go hungry.\u201dBai Zhi was setting the tableware, when she saw Hu Feng didn\u2019t come out in his room, she curiously asked: \u201cWhere did Hu Feng go? Every time we eat, he always came in time, so why he was not here today?\u201dHu Changlin smiled and said: \u201cHe, he said that he will go with you to the town. So, he went to Old Li\u2019s house to rent the ox cart. He doesn\u2019t like crowded people, so he went there early to rent.\u201dBai Zhi said: \u201cHe is really strange, squeezing with the crowd can make the shopping more lively. You can talk with others and relieve your boredom.\u201dHu Changlin shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know his temper. He never likes to deal with strangers. He doesn\u2019t like to talk to strangers. He hates strangers approaching him.\u201dBai Zhi thought of Hu Feng\u2019s cold face and shrugged her shoulders: \u201cMaybe he has that character before, so even if he lost his memory he didn\u2019t change.\u201dHu Changlin nodded and sighed, he didn\u2019t say anything anymore.The next moment, from outside, they heard the sound of an ox cart. Hu Changlin hurriedly went to the door and welcome Hu Feng, who just arrived: \u201cYour back, wash quickly, the food is ready.\u201dAfter hearing the food, Hu Feng immediately stepped down the cart and tide the rope of the ox to the stone pier in the courtyard. Then, he quickly took a scoop of water from the tank to wash his hands and sweaty face... \u2026The breakfast was very simple, it was only a white porridge with side dishes. The white porridge was cooked very well, it was soft and sweet. The small dishes were the remaining vegetables in the kitchen, that was cut into small pieces. After it was cut, it was fried in oil and spices. The hot oil that covered the vegetables made it very fragrant.Hu Feng ate three bowls of porridge in one breath. Although he had a large appetite, he could only eat two bowls at most. But today, he ate three bowls. It can be seen how much the white glutinous rice changed the porridge taste.Hu Changlin smiled and said: \u201cZhi\u2019er, to whom did you learn to cook? I\u2019m afraid your cuisine is not worst than a chef in the town.\u201dBai Zhi replied in modesty: \u201cWhere will I learn it? It\u2019s nothing but my own thoughts and consideration to your preference.\u201dHu Feng looked at Bai Zhi seriously: \u201cI will go to the town to buy some of the ingredients to your specialty dish. There\u2019s no more food in the house.\u201dHer specialty dish? Well, in these past few days, they have been helping them, mother and daughter, so she wanted them to eat a nice meal to return the favor.\u201cAll right, when we get to the town, we will go to the market first. Let\u2019s buy some ingredients that everyone loves to eat. Let\u2019s buy some rice and noodles. Then, tomorrow, let\u2019s eat dumplings.\u201dBoth Hu Changlin and Zhao Lan got curious: \u201cDumplings? What are dumplings?\u201dThis time, Bai Zhi\u2019s facial expression changed and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know dumplings? You\u2019ve never eaten a dumpling?\u201d\u00a0Isn\u2019t dumplings a food in ancient times?\u00a0How can they not know?Zhao Lan was the most curious of all. After all, why does her daughter know something that she doesn\u2019t even know: \u201cI have never heard of it, how did you know about this dumplings?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: This girl was lyingZhao Lan was full of doubts. After her daughter died and came back to life, not only her personality changed, but also her knowledge has improved.This child was raised by her hand, she knew very clearly what she does, what she ate and where she goes every day.Therefore, she was more aware that she has no possibility to learn anything else in other places.Where did she learn the things she suddenly knew?Bai Zhi saw Zhao Lan staring at her with suspicion, so she said with a smile: \u201cIn fact, I also have never eaten dumplings. I thought Hu Bo and Hu Feng had eaten it, so I wanted to brag.\u201dHu Changlin asked: \u201cThen, you talk about it, what is this dumpling?\u201dBai Zhi turned her eye and smiled: \u201cIt\u2019s actually like this. When I was digging wild vegetables, there were two other children that were with me. They are not from Huangtou Village. I don\u2019t remember too well, where did they come from or where their village was. But, when the two of them felt hungry, they started to talk something about food. I was also hungry, so I secretly listened to them. They said the best food they ate in their life was this food called dumplings. They also discussed what is this dumpling, so I became greedy and my saliva started to flow down in my clothes.\u201dSeeing both her mother and Hu Changlin laughing, Bai Zhi added: \u201cI secretly made a vow that I must eat this dumpling in the future with my niang.\u201dWhen things turned out like that, Zhao Lan\u2019s heart was full of guilt. Her daughter used to dig wild vegetables. Every time the Bai Family will rush her to dig, she will go with an empty stomach. But, she doesn\u2019t have lunch when she returned. During dinner, it would be very lucky if she could eat a full meal, but if she\u2019s not, she could only eat rice soup.She could only blame her mother for being useless. She can\u2019t protect her, she can\u2019t give her a good life. She can only watch her daughter suffer.With Bai Zhi\u2019s story, Zhao Lan and Hu Changlin were convinced. Only one person was an exception.Hu Feng didn\u2019t believe it at all!Although what she said was a complete story, he knew that this little girl was lying.Just like, she didn\u2019t study medicine, but she knew medicine.She didn\u2019t learn to cook, but she did a good job.She didn\u2019t go to school, but she can recognize the words.Although she was young, seemingly simple and naive, she was also witty. In fact, it seems like this innocence was what gave her means to make a living.At a such a young age, she has that kind of talent, which makes him stare at her closely.The more he felt that she was special, the more he wanted to watch over her. However, the more he watched over her, the more he couldn\u2019t see through her.Hu Feng got up and headed towards Hu Changlin: \u201cI am going to feed the cows with some grass. You ready yourself to go. We will set off immediately.\u201d When he turned around, his lips curved into a smile. One day, he will personally unveil Bai Zhi\u2019s veil. Under that veil, what could be hidden?*Sitting on the oxcart, the four of them looked like a real family. The four of them were chatting while heading to the town.Mrs.\u00a0Liu, who was washing clothes at the river, just saw this scene. When she saw the scene, she immediately straightened her waist and pulled a female villager: \u201cHey, look at those two people, they only separated from our family yesterday, but look at them now? Even if you are in a hurry to live with someone else, you should at least wait for at least two days. Some people\u2019s face is really thick to the point that you can compare it to the city wall.\u201dZhao Lan\u2019s face became very ugly. She stayed as a widower for 10 years. In that 10 years, she worked like a horse in the Bai Family. She never considered her marriage life. She didn\u2019t even talk a few words to another man. So, she really doesn\u2019t know why the Bai Family think of her this way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: Stealing the chicken, and eating uncooked riceOther people may not know her personality, but how can the Bai Family not know?Knowing what kind of person she was, but still speak malicious words to slander her, how can she not be upset?Bai Zhi stood up from the oxcart and looked at Mrs. Liu, then she laughed and shouted: \u201cLiu Guihua, you are a fickle woman, is that why you think all the women in the world are like you? Do you want me to tell in front of the villagers about you and Yang Sigen?\u201dMrs. Liu\u2019s face drastically changed. She pointed her finger to Bai Zhi and shouted: \u201cDead girl, what nonsense are you talking about? I and Yang Sigen are both clean. What kind of thing happened between us ah? You better say this matter clearly.\u201dThe oxcart gradually drifted away, but Bai Zhi\u2019s crispy voice still passed on every woman\u2019s ears that were washing clothes by the river: \u201cLook at you, I haven\u2019t said anything yet, why are you so fierce and scary? If I come and talk about this matter, what if you hurt me? I\u2019m so scared, I don\u2019t want to say anything anymore.\u201dBai Zhi then snorted and turned around.Zhao Lan frowned and looked at Bai Zhi, then asked: \u201cIs what you said is true? Is Liu Guihua and that Yang Sigen really have something?\u201dBai Zhi shrugged her shoulders: \u201cI don\u2019t know if she and Yang Sigen have something. I just want her to taste her own medicine. I want her to feel how it is to be falsely accused.\u201dThis was the thing called an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.Mrs. Liu can smear other\u2019s reputation, but other\u2019s are not allowed to taint hers?Oh right, she has a husband and a mother-in-law, so she was in a more disadvantaged position.Mrs. Liu really wanted to cry, but no tears came out. It was very impossible for her to steal the chicken, and eat uncooked rice.She wanted to make Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan disgusting to everyone\u2019s eyes, but she didn\u2019t expect that she will burn her own self.Mrs. Liu\u00a0turned her head and said to the women on the riverside: \u201cDon\u2019t listen to that dead girl\u2019s nonsense. There is nothing going on between us. I and Yang Sigen had only seen each other twice. The first time was when I went to the Baiyang Village to look for Bai Zhi\u2019s husband. The second one was when he cause trouble to the village. We obviously didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201dThe villagers just laughed and didn\u2019t say anything. They only continued to wash their clothes. They acted like they didn\u2019t hear Mrs. Liu\u2019s words.Mrs. Yingzi got up with her washed clothes and look at Mrs. Liu: \u201cLiu Guihua, as a saying goes, there is no wave if there\u2019s no wind. Likewise, there is no smoke, if there\u2019s no fire.\u201d\u201cYou, you, what do you mean?\u201d Mrs. Liu became anxious.Mrs. Yingzi laughed and said: \u201cNothing, I\u2019ll go ahead now, I am finished.\u201d Mrs. Yingzi sneered and walked passed by Mrs. Liu.The village women who also had been washing clothes finished their work. They walked away and didn\u2019t listen to Mrs. Liu\u2019s explanation.Mrs. Liu has long been married in the Huangtou Village. So, how can she not know the habits of the villagers? Those words of that dead girl, Bai Zhi, will surely pass by like a wind in the whole village.This kind of thing, although it\u2019s not true, it will be passed to everyone\u2019s ears and mouth with different version\u2026 \u2026How can this thing be good? If this matter passed to her mother-in-law and Bai Dazhu\u2019s ears, she will not have peaceful days.Dead girl, you dare to slander me, let\u2019s see how I am going to clean you up!*The ox cart took Bai Zhi all the way to the Qingyuan town, then they went straight to the market. The market was very similar to the modern time market, the only difference was there was a small table on the ground, unlike in the modern time which was clean and tidy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: The Emperor\u2019s noticeThe way people sell vegetables were in the same style. Even modern people still maintain this ancient style. This thousand years of culture and living habits were kept intact.Dumplings have meat, so Bai Zhi bought 3 pounds of pork belly and a piece of pork lard, to be used for frying.\u00a0 She also bought a handful of leeks. Additionally, she bought several seasonal vegetables such as green peppers, eggplants, and string beans. She also bought another small wooden barrel to keep the newly bought two fishes alive.Thinking about Zhao Lan and Hu Changlin\u2019s broken hands, Bai Zhi bought some pork ribs and corn. She was planning to cook them a pot of corn soup.As for herself, as long as she properly nourished herself, she could grow taller. And so, she bought herself 2 pounds of beef.Then, she bought the seasonings that were missing in the kitchen. She also bought some rice and noodles, which were all put in the oxcart.\u201cHave you bought everything?\u201d Hu Feng asked with knitted eyebrows. This little girl was seemingly walking around the market, but she actually knew what she needs. She doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time, nor need a long hour to buy things. Her speed to buys things was pretty fast.Unlike some other people who just entered the town, they find everything around them strange. And so when they touch things, they wasted a lot of time observing.Bai Zhi nodded her head: \u201cMmm bought them. Now, let\u2019s go to the clothes store.\u201dThe four people rushed to the clothing store with the oxcart. While on the road, they passed by the bulletin board that the government has built in the long street. A yellow colored notice was posted, so many people were looking around.There were many people around, but only few can read the words on the post.When they arrived in front of the bulletin board, Hu Feng suddenly stopped the oxcart and looked at the yellow notice. As the words entered his eyes, his straight eyebrows gradually wrinkled. He couldn\u2019t tell why, but his heart was feeling very uncomfortable. He was also feeling dizzy.Hu Changlin asked: \u201cWhat did the notice say?\u201dHu Feng came back to his senses, he shook his head to throw away the inexplicable emotions he felt.Then, he said: \u201cThis is the emperor\u2019s notice, to tell the world that his Cefeng Imperial Concubine Chun became the empress.\u201dWho knows why, but when he mentioned the emperor and Imperial Concubine Chun his heart gave birth to strange emotions. Did he know the emperor and Imperial Concubine Chun before?Hu Feng shook his head, after all, that was impossible. He was in the northwest border. It was a thousand miles away from the capital, where the emperor and Imperial Concubine Chun lives. How could it be possible for him to know them?Hu Changlin just snorted, he didn\u2019t ask Hu Feng another question. He only asked him to hurry and drive.What the imperial family\u2019s things has got to do to commoners like them?When the carriage stopped in front of the clothes store, Bai Zhi pulled Zhao Lan\u2019s hand to enter. The store not only sold all kinds of expensive fabrics but also ready-to-wear garments. All kind of fabrics were displayed, even the cheapest fabrics for poor people from the mountain village was available.\u00a0But this cheapest fabric was the most sturdy coarse clothes.This kind of coarse cloth clothes only has a single color. Most color available was dark, such as dark red, dark blue, black, gray and the like.While silk clothes were light in color and comfortable. The color selection was also a lot more. The price was much cheaper than the satin, which was much more expensive than the coarse cloth.Bai Zhi chose a set of coarse clothes and silk clothes for herself and Zhao Lan. The colors were bright and beautiful.Zhao Lan has never walked through the clothes store in her life. So, when she touched the smooth surface of the fabrics and looked at the bright colors and delicate cuts, she couldn\u2019t tell how many times it was better compared to the rough linen she was wearing.It was something that women like, so she was no exception: \u201cDoes it cost a lot of money?\u201d However, although she likes them, she can\u2019t help but worried about money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: Buying silver needlesBai Zhi smiled and let the shopkeeper wrapped the clothes: \u201cAs long as you like them, the price doesn\u2019t matter. \u201dAlthough Zhao Lan was distressed with money, this was her daughter\u2019s filial piety. So in the end, she didn\u2019t say anything anymore. She just stared at the shopkeeper, who was wrapping the clothes for her daughter: \u201cYoung lady, these are your sets of clothes, it\u2019s a total of 2 silver coins.\u201dBai Zhi didn\u2019t try to bargain to the shop treasurer, she directly handed the 2 silver coins.The shopkeeper originally thought that their newly bought dress was shabby. And it could be seen that the little girl in front of him was poor. She would definitely be surprised at the price. However, he didn\u2019t expect that she will give him the money generously. She didn\u2019t even take aback. So, his fake smile immediately became a beautiful smile.\u201cYoung girl, we have some new good silk skirt in our store. It is the most suitable outfit during summer. Do you want to see them?\u201dBai Zhi waved her hand and said: \u201cWe are from the mountain village, who work all day in the field. I can\u2019t wear that kind of skirt, it is very inconvenient, but thank you, shopkeeper. When we don\u2019t need to work in the field anymore, I will come back and buy that kind of skirts.\u201dBai Zhi talked generously, and when she mentioned that she was from the mountain village, she didn\u2019t show any trace of inferiority. As if in her eyes, being a farmer was not inferior to any wealthy people in the town.The shopkeeper couldn\u2019t help but stare at Bai Zhi. The little girl in front of him was thin and small, she was most likely 12 or 13 years old. Her face was only as big as a palm-sized, but her facial features were extremely delicate. There were bruises on her cheeks up to her neck, but her skin was white, showing that she will become a big beauty.The shopkeeper\u00a0smiled and sent them out of the shop, the smile on his face became more and more sincere. After all, the little girl he met was really interesting.*Out of the cloth store, Hu Changlin said: \u201cIf there is nothing else to buy, let\u2019s go back now.\u201dBai Zhi was about to nod her head, but Hu Feng said: \u201cLet\u2019s go to the pharmacy store.\u201dHu Changlin busily asked: \u201cWhy do you need to go in there? Do you feel uncomfortable?\u201dHu Feng looked at Bai Zhi and said: \u201cDidn\u2019t you said that you need to buy silver needles? Now that you have money, isn\u2019t it about time to buy it?\u201dBai Zhi patted her head: \u201cRight, how can I forget that, let\u2019s walk around and go to the pharmacy store.\u201dHu Feng slightly knitted his eyebrow. Did she really forgot it or faking she forgot about it? Did she really just came to buy clothes and food, and didn\u2019t mind his treatment?Hu Changlin still couldn\u2019t understand, so he asked: \u201cWhat do you need silver needles for?\u201dBai Zhi chuckle twice, then said: \u201cThis is how it is, when I was accompanying Bai Xioafeng in the school last year, I found an acupuncture book on the road. I secretly hide it, so that when I became older I can use it\u2019s skill. I always took it out and studied everyday for a year now. I already learned a bit. I even tried it last time when I borrowed Lu Dafu\u2019s silver needle. I didn\u2019t expect that I will succeed.\u201dWhen Hu Changlin heard her words, he couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cYou learned acupuncture technique all by yourself? I heard acupuncture technique was very hard to learn. Some people even took 10 years to learn even a bit. But you, you only found a book and study by yourself? You are a\u00a0\u00a0genius!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t learned much, so I can\u2019t be called a genius. But, I\u2019m really interested to learn. If you will look closely at my skill, you will see that I only learn a bit.\u201dJust learned a bit?\u00a0Zhao Lan doesn\u2019t think so. She had a terrible pain that time, but when her daughter used silver needles. The pain slowly disappeared and Doctor Lu was amazed in her skills. How could she just learned a bit?Zhao Lan was also very curious, when did her daughter learned acupuncture technique? Why didn\u2019t she know that?Did she really just studied by herself?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: The FieldIt was Bai Zhi\u2019s first time coming in the pharmacy store, but Hu Feng and Hu Changlin were not, they have come here many times.Qingyuan Town was not big, there were only a few pharmacy stores. While there was only two to three medical hall.Every time Hu Changlin came here, he was with Hu Feng.In order to cure Hu Feng\u2019s amnesia, Hu Changlin didn\u2019t hesitate to spend money.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the medical center in the town has no way to cure his disease.\u201cWhat do you need to buy?\u201d A shop assistant greeted them and asked.Bai Zhi replied: \u201cDage, I don\u2019t know if you sell silver needles here? The doctor in our village asked us to help him buy a set of silver needles.\u201dWhen the shop assistant heard her words, he quickly smiled and said: \u201cYou are right, there is. In Qingyuan town, only our store is selling silver needles.\u201dBai Zhi smiled and said: \u201cThat\u2019s right, the doctor of our village specifically said to us to buy it here. He didn\u2019t let us go somewhere else.\u201dThe shop assistant smiled more and more: \u201cJust wait, I will go and get it for you.\u201dWhen the shop assistant went\u00a0away, Zhao Lan whispered and asked: \u201cZhi\u2019er, why did you lie to him? Obviously, we are buying it ourselves?\u201dBai Zhi looked around first and said: \u201cThe silver needles are not something everyone can use. Since that is the case, naturally they will not sell it to us cheaply. We are not aware of the price, but if I said a doctor needs to buy it, they will sell it to us with the same pricing as to the doctors.\u201dWhat Bai Zhi said was not easy to understand, but once people do, they will immediately understand her meaning.Zhao Lan was stunned, what her daughter said was right. Why she didn\u2019t think of it before? If her daughter didn\u2019t say that she was helping a village doctor to buy the silver needles and the shop assistant didn\u2019t give them the usual pricing, what will they do?As Hu Feng faintly looked at the little girl in front of him, he couldn\u2019t help but smile inside his heart. The little girl was very sophisticated in her age. It was really confusing. What was exactly inside this little girl\u2019s head?The shop assistant quickly brought the silver needles. A dark red needle bag with a tie was handed over to Bai Zhi. After opening it, there were various needles with different length inside, which were not as good as the one she had in the 23rd century. This set was not complete as her original set, but enough for treating ordinary disease.However, if it\u2019s to perform acupuncture treatment to Hu Feng, she was lacking two types of silver needles. She seems need to find another way out.*After buying a set of silver needles, the four people drove back in the Huangtou Village with the oxcart. In the afternoon, the four of them ate dry foods to ease their hunger. The oxcart moves slow, it will take 2 hours before they arrive in the house.However, just as their oxcart arrive in front of the village, they happened to meet Village Chief Li, who was also driving another oxcart.When Village Chief Li saw them, he hurriedly said: \u201cZhao Lan, Bai Zhi, your lot and fields have been approved. You came back in the right time, I will take you there.\u201dIn order to help them do this well, Village Chief Li made an appointment this morning. In the morning, he traveled with his oxcart to the town. He mentioned Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi\u2019s situation to the Official Registrar, and then he submitted the application for both lot and fields.The Official Registrar was in a good mood today, so the processing that usually takes two days was finished in just one day. Village Chief Li didn\u2019t expect that the Official Registrar will signed and sealed the application.Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi were so happy. After all, they didn\u2019t expect that they will have a lot and fields so fast. They could divide their fields so that even if they plant the wheat late, they could grow something else. They could harvest something around fall.Bai Zhi helped Zhao Lan to get off the oxcart and thanked Village Chief Li.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: DumplingsVillage Chief Li waved his hand: \u201cDon\u2019t thank me, I am the village chief of the Huangtou Village. These affairs are what I do. I should thank you instead.\u201dBai Zhi let Hu Changlin and Hu Feng go back first, then the two of them followed Village Chief Li.Zhao Lan is a daughter-in-law in this village, Bai Zhi is a daughter. So, it was reasonable to give them a place in Huangtou Village under such situation. Originally, Village Chief Li doesn\u2019t have much hope. However, unexpectedly, things went smoothly, so he was very happy.There was an open space next to the old banyan tree, not far from Hu Changlin\u2019s house and just right at the center of the village. Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi only consisted of two people, they don\u2019t need a large place to live. And if the two of them lived on the west side, it will be very convenient for two lonely women.When Bai Zhi saw the lot, she began formulating a floor plan. Although the area was not large, if she built a two-story house, it will be very comfortable. She can even use the rest as a small farm place, which she was dreaming of.After they check the place, Bai Zhi invited Village Chief Li to eat with them, in the Hu Family\u2019s house. However, Village Chief Li refused: \u201cI\u2019ve just eaten. I\u2019ll let you eat more. Besides, if I go and eat with you, the villagers might gossip about it, saying that I am taking a bribe, which is bad.\u201dBai Zhi didn\u2019t insist, she still has a lot of opportunities in the future to repay Village Chief Li, so she didn\u2019t hurry this time.After sending away Village Chief Li, Bai Zhi took Zhao Lan back to Hu Family house.*Hu Changlin and Zhao Lan\u2019s hands were broken, it\u2019s very inconvenient for them to work. So the dinner was naturally done by Bai Zhi and Hu Feng.Hu Feng washed the dishes, when he turned back, he saw Bai Zhi holding a rolling pin that quickly flattens the circle dough. The flatten dough was shaped in the same size as if it was drawn in advance.Seeing him standing stupidly, Bai Zhi pointed her finger to the dumpling\u2019s toppings in the big bowl and said: \u201cHelp me wrapped them up.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Hu Feng simple replied.However, Bai Zhi put down the rolling pin, picked up a dough, and then picked up a small part of the toppings from the bowl and gave it to him.The dumplings looked very cute, it has a round belly and a white coat.Hu Feng tried it, but he didn\u2019t succeed. He tried it again but also didn\u2019t succeed.Hu Feng couldn\u2019t help but be annoyed. It looks very simple, so how can it be so difficult?Bai Zhi grabbed Hu Feng\u2019s hand, then she held his finger, and taught him how to pinch it. \u201cDon\u2019t put too much force, control yourself. Do it softly and slowly, see, it\u2019s done, right?\u201d Bai Zhi looked up and smile brightly. Her eyes seemed to overflow with stars.\u201cYou try it again.\u201d Bai Zhi let go of Hu Feng\u2019s hand and continued flatting the dough.When Bai Zhi\u2019s palm left Hu Feng\u2019s hands, Hu Feng was a bit lost in his heart. He couldn\u2019t tell what it was.Although Hu Feng just learned, he was able to do a good job under Bai Zhi\u2019s teaching. His wrapping skill became better and better.After the dumplings were finished, Bai Zhi let Hu Feng start the fire. Then, she quickly cut the other ingredients for other dishes.Soon, a chili stir-fried meat strips, braised fish, stewed eggplant and corn soup with ribs were cooked in the stove to the yard.\u00a0 And it began emitting a tempting fragrance.When Bai Zhi was frying the vegetables, Hu Feng smelled the fragrance of the food while burning the fire. He doesn\u2019t know how long his stomach undergo a humane torture. He was not hungry, but when he smelled the food that Bai Zhi made, he felt like he didn\u2019t eat for 800 years. His stomach keeps growling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Where did they get the money?Finally, the last dish was being cooked. Bai Zhi let Hu Feng bring outside the other dishes, while she was steaming the dumplings to the stove.Village Chief Li\u2019s business with Bai Zhi and Zhao Lan quickly spread to the Bai Family\u2019s ears. How can they believe it? They don\u2019t have a job, but they can buy a lot and fields?Mrs. Liu opened her mouth: \u201cNiang, the money they spend to buy a lot and fields. Where did they get it from?\u201dOld Lady Bai gritted her teeth: \u201cWhy are you asking me? Go, let\u2019s go and see, I can\u2019t believe they could save private money under my eyes.\u201dBai Erzhu didn\u2019t want to join in this excitement. But when he saw Bai Dazhu\u2019s family joining the fun, he had no choice but also join in with his son, Bai Fugui.If his mother and brother get any benefit from Zhao Lan, then they will have no share.Old Lady Bai leads the way. Her two sons, Mrs. Liu, and three grandchildren followed behind her. The momentum of a group of seven people was not small.When the villagers on the road saw this scene, they couldn\u2019t help mutter: \u201cI heard that Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi bought a piece of land. Look at them, they can\u2019t sit still and wanted to make trouble.\u201d\u201cWhat trouble? They are separated now, what qualifications do they have to cause trouble? And besides, Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi live at Hu Family. Can they cause trouble? Compared to Hu Feng\u2019s physique, who are they? Will they dare to make a move? Did they forget how Bai Dazhu\u2019s hands got broken?\u201dThe villager\u2019s arguments became more and more ridiculous. All of them believed that the Bai Family will end badly this time.Old Lady Bai took her family to the old banyan tree, but she didn\u2019t see Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi.\u201cIs it a mistake?\u201d Mrs. Liu doesn\u2019t want to believe it. Only Zhao Lan and Bai Zhi lived in this village, they don\u2019t have relatives. Even if Hu Changlin has the heart to help her, it was still impossible to help her buy a lot and fields. They need to go to the government and declare their intentions first, it was not easy to be approved.Old Lady Bai said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear it wrong, let\u2019s go to Hu Changlin\u2019s place to make things clear.\u201dWhen Bai Dazhu heard they will go to the Hu Family, he immediately opened his mouth: \u201cI have to go to the Hu Family\u2019s house again? Can\u2019t I go?\u201d Just by remembering what Hu Feng did that day, Bai Dazhu was still in fear.Old Lady Bai gave Bai Dazhu a bad look: \u201cUseless thing, who ask you to fight? We have a reason to come. As long as we don\u2019t start a fight, can they dare to take actions?\u201dBai Erzhu couldn\u2019t help but whispered in his heart:\u00a0Reason?\u00a0What are we going to say in front of Zhao Lan and Bai Yu?Although he thought so inside his heart, Bai Erzhu\u2019s feet still lead him to the Hu Family\u2019s place.*At this time, Bai Zhi just put the dumplings on the table, the aroma was very tempting, special the shape, their eyes couldn\u2019t help but stared straight at the dumplings: \u201cThis is the dumplings?\u201d Zhao Lan asked.Bai Zhi nodded her head: \u201cMmm, this is dumplings, try it.\u201dEach one of them raised their chopsticks, they wanted to try and taste the dumplings. But suddenly, they heard familiar voices.Hu Changlin frowned: \u201cWhy did they come?\u201dBai Zhi put down the chopsticks in her hand and said: \u201cThe things about the lot and fields passed to their ears. They come to ask about it.\u201dHu Changlin sighed: \u201cThis Bai Family is really shameless. You two already separated from them. What are you planning to do with them?\u201dBai Zhi looked up at Hu Changlin: \u201cHu Bo, if they ask where did we get the money to buy the lot and fields, tell them they came from you. Don\u2019t slip your tongue, don\u2019t let them throw dirty water on me and my niang.\u201dBai Zhi had thought it through, so she added: \u201cHu Bo, go and bring 10 silver coins with you and put them to your body. Then, look at my eyes and wait for my signal.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
