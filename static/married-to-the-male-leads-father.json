The gentle breeze stirred lightly and the flower petals moved a little. The air was filled with the light scent of the flowers.The first rays of the morning sun shyly peeked, gray dawn floated on the east side.The servants in Changning Count Residence had started to get busy. They shuttle back and forth in their own courtyards and the residence slowly became merrier.A silent and elegant courtyard in the west side was quiet instead. There was not a single servant hurrying in there.On the carved bed in side of the courtyard, Jiang Ningbao who was asleep opened her eyes. Her eyes were beautiful and her looks were flawless. Her disposition was soft and clear, looking delicate and charming, making others feel pity.\u201cI actually transmigrated into a book?\u201dJiang Ningbao lifted the thin blanket on her body and sat on the side of the bed. Her eyebrows knitted slightly and she felt shocked and disbelief. Jiang Ningbao sat quietly for a while and then opened the veil, wearing a single layer of clothing to get out of the bed. She wore a pair of embroidered shoes and arbitrarily used her hair ribbon to tie her waist.Then, the door opened with a creak. A girl wearing crow blue clothes quietly and smoothly entered the room. Seeing that the person inside the room had woken up, she let out a surprised sound.\u201cLady, you\u2019re awake?\u201dJiang Ningbao glance at the incoming person and let out a faint smile, nodding lightly. She took the toothbrush made from poplar willow branch and moistened the tooth-powder made from medicinal materials and rinsed her mouth.After rinsing her mouth, Jiang Ningbao started to wash her face.Looking at the exquisite face reflected on the water inside the copper basin, Jiang Ningbao stared at it blankly. Even though she had been seeing it for more than then years, but she still was not used to this delicate and beautiful face.In her previous life, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s appearance was bright and colorful with strong disposition. Who knew that once she transmigrated, her look was the opposite of the beauty spectrum, a tender and delicate beauty.Even if she was angry, she would look like a beauty grumbling in a flirty manner.This look was the easiest to earn pity from men and grew envy from women.Jiang Ningbao sighed and did not stare at the reflection any longer. She washed her face with practiced movements and wiped her face clean with the towel brought by the servant. The female servant beside her let out a forced smile and said in a low voice, \u201cMiss, your breakfast is the chicken congee you love.\u201dSaying this, the servant girl lowered her head and quickly took out the chicken congee out of the food box.The chicken congee smelt good. It was apparent that the skill of the head chef in the residence was good.Being Changning Count Residence\u2019s oldest legal daughter from the second branch, Jiang Ningbao wore the silks and satin, ate delicacies from land and sea\u2026. but that was before. From three years ago, her parents encountered bandits on the was home to the clan. They fell from the cliff and it was still unknown whether they were still alive or not. From the on, her meals decreased day by day.Especially these past few days. Her breakfast was only a bowl of soup.Fortunately, the soup was still made by the head chef who was skilled at making porridge.Recalling the memories she received yesterday night, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s lips curved to a cold smile. She sat at the side of the table and slowly drank the chicken congee. After drinking the chicken congee, the sky outside had turned bright.\u201cMiss, today is fifteenth of the month. You must go to Golden Longevity Hall to pay respects to the old madam.\u201d The servant girl saw that the sky had brightened and cleaned up the table while reminding in a small voice.Jiang Ningbao heard the servant girl\u2019s reminder and nodded lightly.

The old madam is kind-hearted, giving second mistress\u2019 dowry to be managed by the fourth miss.\u201d\u201cNo matter what, the fourth miss is still Duke Ding\u2019s heir\u2019s fiancee. The masters won\u2019t do it too excessive, it\u2019s just that the rumors outside are too absurd. Duke Ding\u2019s heir shouldn\u2019t cancel the engagement for Anyuan Marquis\u2019 legal daughter.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. The fourth miss\u2019 status cannot compare to Anyuan Marquis Residence\u2019s legal oldest daughter. That oldest young miss won\u2019t want to be under the fourth miss.\u201d\u201cThat is true. Now, the whole capital is fixing their gaze on our Count Residence.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJiang Ningbao did not care about the servant girls\u2019 discussion and walked to the Golden Longevity Hall. When she arrived in front of the door of Golden Longevity Hall, she met the first branch\u2019s only legal daughter who was fifth in the line, called the fifth young miss Jiang Mingyao.Jiang Mingyao\u2019s voice was cool and faint as she nodded her head slightly toward Jiang Ningbao.\u201cFourth sister.\u201dFifth lady Jiang Mingyao had a pair of delicate eyebrows and her demeanor was that of a chilly beauty. She was only a month smaller than Jiang Ningbao. Although she was spoiled by glamorous underlings, but her brows did not carry smugness nor pride.\u201cFifth sister.\u201d Jiang Ningbao gave her a soft smile in return, appearing fragile and cowardly, earning other\u2019s pity.The two legal young miss met. One was crowded by her servants from back to front, while the other only had a lonesome servant.This obvious difference in treatment made people sighed endlessly.Jiang Ningbao did not care about this. She did not like to be served by too many people. From three years ago when her parents met with an accident, the servants in the residence mostly searched other big thighs to hug.The servant who remained by her side was only Chun Xi.The servants by the door raised the curtains and greeted respectfully, \u201cThe two misses, please come in.\u201dJiang Mingyao glanced at the cowardly and delicate fourth sister and her eyebrows knitted slightly before moving her gaze. She waited the other to enter the room first with a faint expression and followed her behind.The Jiang old madam of the Changning Count did not like concubine born children so the ones who could pay respect to the Golden Longevity Hall were only the two legal children and the legal born grandchildren. Aside from the legitimate children who were too young, the rest of the sons were at the academy or taking care of official missions at the government state.A year earlier, after the eldest legitimate daughter of the first branch got married, the only people going to the Golden Longevity Hall were Jiang Ningbao, Jiang Mingyao and the first branch\u2019s madam.Old Madam Jiang sat upright in the main hall with a gratified scattering flower dress. Her hair was meticulously combed back to a certain hairstyle and her face seemed amiable. If it were not for the calculative light in her eyes, anyone would think this was a benign old madam.Beside her stood a pretty middle aged woman with a signified air and delicate brows. She was Changning Count Residence\u2019s first madame, Jiang Mingyao\u2019s mother.Jiang Ningbao lifted her skirt, gently walked to where the old madame was sitting and bend her knees to pay respect.\u201cNingbao greets grandmother, oldest aunt.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She turned to Jiang Ningbao. Toward this granddaughter who possessed tender and beautiful appearance that easily evoke pity, Old Madame Jiang could not help but frown her brows.She actually did not like this granddaughter. Every time she looked at Jiang Ningbao, she would think of the favored concubine who had tender features during the time the Old Count was young.But this granddaughter was lucky, having a good engagement since she was little.She brought Changning Count Residence a lot of benefits, but now that her engagement met with an unforeseen event, it was hard to say whether or not this engagement could be saved. Even if it could be saved, the position of legal wife would probably be given to another. Old Madame Jiang\u2019s gaze was complicated as she looked at Jiang Ningbao, having a rare moment of soft-heartedness.\u201cFourth girl, you don\u2019t need to care about the awful rumors circulating outside. Grandmother will definitely support you. No one could humiliate the young misses of our Count Residence.\u201d\u201cMother is right. Fourth girl, you can be at ease, your engagement will be fine.\u201d The first madame surname Zhang also gave her word of consolation.If talking about who in the residence that did not wish Jiang Ningbao\u2019s engagement to met with mishap the most, it would be the first madame.Changning Count Residence was a declining noble family. Only having the title but no real power.The men in the residence did not have any high position.In the early years, the first madame was treated coldly and ignored in the circle of noble madams. After Jiang Ningbao\u2019s fiance was adopted by Lord Protector Ding, the madams who usually treat her coldly all became friendly with her.Her eldest daughter even married into the marquis residence.The first madame who tasted the sweetness of course did not want her niece\u2019s engagement to change, especially when her uncle was planning on giving her second son an official job.In reality, the first madame and the old madame was the same. They both did not like Jiang Ningbao who was beautiful and delicate. This was why the first madame silently allowed Jiang Ningbao to be treated less, but she won\u2019t do it too much.The old madame also knew about this but pretended not to.The cool and cold Jiang Mingyao who was standing beside Jiang Ningbao showed pity. Fourth sister\u2019s engagement what was the envy of others being stared at by so many people was not a good thing.Anyuan Marquis Residence had immense influence while Changning Count Residence had nothing.It was all up to Duke Ding Residence\u2019s decision.In her opinion, the engagement of fourth sister and Duke Ding\u2019s heir would change.Jiang Ningbao smiled lightly and nodded warmly, \u201cThanking grandmother and first aunt.\u201d Her lowered eyes flashed with coldness. She did not believe that Old Madame Jiang and first aunt would help her keep the engagement.Once she woke up and found herself as the venomous female antagonist, Jiang Ningbao had adjusted to it. She of course knew the continuation of the story from Peach Blossom Banquet. Duke Ding Residence would send someone to cancel the engagement. After Old Madame Jiang and first aunt knew about the tempting compensation, they were ecstatic to cancel this engagement.At this time, there was a servant girl giving report.\u201cOld Madame, First Madame, Butler Zhao from Duke Ding Residence request an audience.\u201dOnce these words were spoken out, the hall fell into a strange silence.Jiang Mingyao glanced at her fourth sister and on her cold face, a trace of worry appeared.It was obvious that Duke Ding Residence did not come with good intention.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart suddenly skipped as she thought of the plot development. She felt what a coincidence it was. It seemed that today was the day Duke Ding Residence came to cancel the engagement. She lowered her eyes and a dark glint passed her eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing from his straight back and the steady steps with hidden sharp killing intent, it was not hard to see that he was someone who had went to the battlefield.If it weren\u2019t for the experience in her past life, Jiang Ningbao would not sense that this refined-looking Butler Zhao had killing intent that was not worn out yet. She then thought of that famous Duke Ding whom she had never met, male lead Xie Jingyi\u2019s adopted father. Talking about Duke Ding, no one in Dayue Dynasty did not know of him.He was also someone Jiang Ningbao respected the most.He was still twenty eight years old, but already became Dayue\u2019s war deity whose fame spread all over.This kind of man who protected his country and a man with steel bones\u2026 Who would\u2019ve thought that two years later, he would die from a hidden injury when he was at the prime of his life.Male lead Xie Jingyi then became the new Duke Ding.Jiang Ningbao thought of the memory of a transmigrator she got when she first woke up and lightly rubbed the ruby bracelet she wore. She pursed her lips and sunk into deep thought.\u201cOld Madame, this Zhao visited today for the matter of the heir\u2019s and Jiang fourth miss\u2019 engagement.\u201d Butler Zhao was no doubt someone who had went to battle. He did not beat around the bush and directly point to the crux of the issue.Once these words were heard, the hall sunk into silence.Old Madame Jiang\u2019s heard thumped and a foreboding feeling arose. She looked at her granddaughter Jiang Ningbao and asked, \u201cWhat does Butler Zhao meant?\u201dFirst madame\u2019s handkerchief was twisted and wrung as she push down the discomfort in her heart and smiled, \u201cButler Zhao, my niece is already sixteen. May I ask when will the esteemed heir marry my niece?\u201dJiang Ningbao curbed her thought and her eyes looked indifferently to Butler Zhao.Butler Zhao thought of the heir\u2019s adamant attitude in disbanding the engagement and frowned slightly. He sighed in his heart and felt pity for Jiang fourth miss.\u201cThis Zhao was entrusted by the heir to disband the engagement between the heir and Jiang fourth miss.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang Ningbao smiled at her softly and her eyes were unwavering.Jiang Mingyao was stunned.Fourth sister\u2019s reaction was weird.A moment later, Old Madame Jiang sipped her tea and revealed a stiff smile. She tried to confirm with a dry voice, \u201cButler Zhao, did you misspoke? How can sir heir want to withdraw the engagement with the fourth girl?\u201dButler Zhao sighed, \u201cThis is sir heir\u2019s decision.\u201dOld Madame Jiang no longer held any hope in her heart and her face was filled with fury. She threw the pastel flower and bird tea cup with strength to the floor.\u201cButler Zhao! Canceling the engagement affects the reputation of the ladies in the Count Residence, please forgive this old madame for not agreeing! No matter how high the status of Anyuan Marquis Residence\u2019s oldest legal daughter, she must be forced to be below my granddaughter!\u201d\u201cThis engagement cannot be canceled.\u201dOld Madame Jiang\u2019s words were resolute and she sharply stared at Butler Zhao, emphasizing her words one by one.\u201cMother is right. This engagement cannot be canceled. My niece is always scrupulously abide by the rules of etiquette, knowing her place and never overstep her boundaries. The status of Anyuan Marquis legal daughter is indeed higher than my niece, but the one who lost purity with everybody watching is her! Why does my niece has to cancel her engagement and ruin her reputation for that miss?!\u201d\u201cAre you bullying my niece because she no longer has parents?\u201d\u201cSir Heir is too much!\u201d\u201cHow this engagement came to be, Butler Zhao knows it. Now Sir Heir wants to revoke the engagement, truly ungrateful!\u201dFirst madam, Madam Zhang, was outraged and her momentum was aggressive.The engagement of her niece meant that they could grab onto Duke Ding Residence\u2019s belt. If the engagement was no more, the position of Changning Count Residence would fall drastically.She, the count residence\u2019s madam, won\u2019t be as glorious as before.The situation of her older daughter\u2019s position in her husband\u2019s house falling drastically was something Madam Zhang would not allow.Jiang Ningbao looked at this scene calmly and a complicated gaze flashed through her eyes. The people in Changning Count Residence were not evil, but once it was related to their own interest\u2026\u2026The first madam, Madam Zhang, turned to Jiang Ningbao and pulled her smoothly. She patted her softly and placated, \u201cFourth girl, don\u2019t worry. Oldest aunt won\u2019t let you be bullied in vain.\u201d\u201cI trust grandmother and oldest aunt.\u201dJiang Ningbao gave her a smiled filled with trust and her brows were full of soft helplessness that evoke pity, as if a pure and gentle lotus flower, taking people\u2019s breath away.Butler Zhao had taken notice of the two young ladies in the hall. Out of politeness, he did not take a good look at them.Now he knew that the Jiang fourth miss whom sir heir wanted to cancel the engagement with was among them.Glancing at her, he was stunned by the beauty of Jiang Ningbao.Butler Zhao felt awkward in his heart and unbearable pity.Who knew that sir heir\u2019s fiancee, Jiang fourth miss, would had such exquisite beauty, one that made people want to protect her.In reality, sir heir\u2019s act of canceling their engagement was something that Butler Zhao did not approve. Jiang fourth miss was already sixteen years old and was about to get married to Duke Ding Residence.Who knew that this kind of thing would occur?Sir heir rescued Anyuan Marquis\u2019 oldest legal daughter during Princess Rui\u2019s banquet and ruined that miss\u2019 purity and also persist on canceling this engagement to marry Anyuan Marquis\u2019 oldest legal daughter.The old madam did not agree. She said if Anyuan Marquis agree, Anyuan Marquis\u2019 oldest legal daughter could be married in as equal wife, but sir heir knelt in old madam\u2019s courtyard for a day, making old madam had to agree.Butler Zhao\u2019s heart was not comfortable. In his heart, the old madam and the duke were the real masters of the residence, not sir heir who was adopted from the other legitimate branch.Not to mention the title of heir was not permanent. The duke had not made the document that stated who the heir was so sir heir\u2019s successor position was only in name.But thinking to the duke\u2019s condition, if there was no accident, then sir heir would be the next duke.Butler Zhao sighed in his heart.\u201cThe one who wants to cancel this engagement is sir heir. The duke does not know about this. Our old madam cannot force the heir, hence this Zhao is here to revoke it.\u201dButler Zhao was not willing to let the old madam and the duke bear this blame, so he explained the situation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her face sunk and she glared at Butler Zhao with lukewarm anger. She smiled coldly, \u201cDuke Ding\u2019s heir really has such a big face, canceling engagement as he likes. Has he not thought of the damage the girl will receive because of this? Why should he be the one doing this when he\u2019s the wrong one? After canceling the engagement, how will my niece get a good engagement?\u201dButler Zhao\u2019s face stiffened and turned red. He moved his mouth to say something, but he had no refutation to say because this was indeed sir heir in the wrong.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026Something forced is not goof. Sir heir wants to cancel this engagement so we servants could only obey. But the old madame already said that she will give the fourth lady compensation.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyebrow moved a little and glanced at Butler Zhao. It\u2019s finally here.The novel\u2019s male lead gave generous compensation for canceling the engagement and this was also the start of the novel\u2019s Jiang Ningbao\u2019s blackening.As a poisonous canon fodder with delicate appearance. She really used up her delicateness and poisonous plans.Jiang Ningbao thought to that mad venomous \u2018her\u2019 and her eyes flashed with an interested glint.To be honest, she and that venomous canon fodder was really people who was not the same as their appearances.It was truly amusing.The first madam was stunned and wrenched her handkerchief. Old Madam Jiang glanced at Butler Zhao and sipped her tea, expressionless.\u201cCompensation?\u201dA clear voice rang and everyone\u2019s line of sight all went to Jiang Ningbao who was at the center of this matter.\u201cWhy don\u2019t Butler Zhao speak out how exactly does Sir Heir compensate me?\u201dOld Madam Jiang frowned and her heart felt strange. She could not help staring at this granddaughter who seemed so soft and weak that she could be bullied and felt that something was not right.\u201cFourth girl, don\u2019t worry, grandmother will help you in this matter. No compensation is worth your reputation.\u201dMadam Zhang wanted to say something but decided to stay silent.\u201cThank you, grandmother.\u201d Jiang Ningbao curtsied and revealed a gentle smile. Her heart was thinking that this old madam would slap her own face later on.Jiang Ningbao slant her head to the side. Her pair of beautiful eyes were staring lightly at Butler Zhao.\u201cButler Zhao, you haven\u2019t told us what the compensation entailed.\u201d\u201cReplying to the fourth miss. Sir Heir promised that if the fourth miss agreed to cancel this engagement, he would adopt as his sister and enter the clan\u2019s genealogy. When the fourth miss get married, Sir Heir would give generous dowry.\u201d\u201cFourth miss, once you become Sir Heir\u2019s little sister, you\u2019ll become Duke Ding\u2019s oldest miss. Your status would rise and finding a good engagement won\u2019t be hard.\u201dButler Zhao felt that he could not bear to do it but hardened himself to speak out what sir heir\u2019s compensation was. His heart was full of pity toward this beautiful and gentle Jiang fourth miss.From fiancee to little sister. Sir heir really could think it through. But this was indeed a tempting compensation.Changning Count Residence was a declining nobility. They rely on the engagement with Duke Ding Residence to maintain their prestige. Once they lose the engagement with Duke Ding Residence, Changning Count Residence would fall.Butler Zhao\u2019s words cause several expressions on the people\u2019s faces.Old Madam Jiang who just said that no compensation would be worth your reputation was thinking deeply. She sipped her tea and stayed silent, as if weighing the loss and benefit.First Madam Zhang stopped her breath and her eyes glimmered. Even though she just defended her niece in righteous manner, Madam Zhang understood that this niece\u2019s engagement was destined to be gone. It all rooted down to one\u2019s interests.Once her niece became Duke Ding heir\u2019s little sister and continue to support the Count Residence, her daughter Yao\u2019er could marry a better man. Her eldest daughter would have unshakable position in her husband\u2019s house.Silence reigned the hall.Butler Zhao waited patiently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She lowered her eyes. It was indeed as the book wrote. The compensation of canceling the engagement was being the adopted sister, also Duke Ding Residence\u2019s oldest miss.If the one whose engagement was canceled was not her, then Jiang Ningbao might even praise this move.The fiancee who had the engagement but lost her parents would had her marriage plan controlled by Old Madam Jiang and the First Madam.Xie Jingyi was no doubt the book\u2019s male lead. He grasped the hearts of Old Madam Jiang and the others accurately.Old Madam Jiang and First Madam Zhang was not willing to revoke the engagement because they did not want to lose the support of Duke Ding Residence. If Jiang Ningbao became the eldest miss of Duke Ding Residence, entering the Xie clan genealogy book, then Changning Count Residence would forever be bound to Duke Ding Residence.At this moment, the willingness of Jiang Ningbao who was at the center of this matter was not needed.The clan\u2019s interest was the most important.Jiang Ningbao lowered her eyes and pretended to bit her lower lip in, feeling upset. No one noticed the indifference in her eyes.Now, Changning Count Residence\u2019s biggest power in the household \u2013 First Madam Zhang, broke this silence.\u201cMother, don\u2019t you think that you should give fourth girl\u2019s engagement further thought?\u201dJiang Mingyao snapped toward her mother. On her cold and icy face was a trace of her dumbfounded feelings, as if she could not believe that the first to agree was her own mother.She bit her lips and lowered her head. She did not dare to look at fourth sister in fear of seeing the stupefied gaze in her eyes.Being Duke Ding Residence\u2019s oldest miss was good, but her engagement being canceled would cause some damage to the reputation.Even if she was to be married, this stain won\u2019t disappear.The husband family might not make a fuss to give face to Duke Ding Residence, but when it\u2019s already long, they might think differently.Since fourth sister was not Xie clan\u2019s flesh and blood.Could Duke Ding Residence protect her for the rest of her life?Jiang Mingyao won\u2019t believe that her mother did not think of this.Old Madam Jiang thought it through and her heart already leaned on the compensation, but she was embarrassed to open her mouth. First Madam Zhang\u2019s suggestion gave her a leeway and Old Madam Jiang glanced at Jiang Ningbao who felt unsettled and moved her gaze away.\u201cIt should indeed be thought further.\u201dOnce these words came out, Old Madam Jiang was indeed slapping her own face. She just promised that her granddaughter\u2019s reputation preceded everything, but not even fifteen minutes later, she said the opposite. The servants inside the hall did their best to become invisible.Madam Zhang heaved a sigh of relief in her heart. As long as mother agreed, it mattered not if her niece opposed.

If her parents were still here, even if she did not care, the matter of this engagement won\u2019t be up to oldest aunt.How could Butler Zhao not understand the meaning of Old Madam Jiang and Countess Changning? He swept his gaze to Jiang fourth miss who stayed silent and his heart heaved a sigh. Sir Heir\u2019s calculation was on spot, but he had to do it according to sir heir\u2019s instructions, so he hardened himself to speak of the other compensation.\u201cOur old madam agreed with sir heir\u2019s suggestion and also promised to give your residence a position of counselor in Minister of Public Works. What does the old madam thinks?\u201dCounselor in Minister of Public Works was a fifth rank position.First Madam Zhang sucked in deep breath and her heart was palpitating in excitement. Her eyes already turned green.She gave birth to two sons and two daughters. Both her sons were useless. The first son was ordinary. He was twenty years old and studied diligently for ten years, participated in imperial examinations several times but never obtain scholarly honor. But the oldest son could inherit Changning Residence. Her second son gave up on imperial examinations this year and his future was unknown. Changning Count had pulled his connections and wanted to give his second son an official rank. It should be easy because others would give face to Duke Ding Residence.But after the matter in Peach Blossom Banquet, seeing Duke Ding heir\u2019s attitude to Anyuan Marquis\u2019 legitimate daughter, everyone was looking around. The seventh rank position which they agreed on for her second son never came.First Madam Zhang could not sleep well or eat well because of this matter. But now, there was suddenly a position of fifth rank official. How could she still think of her niece? She was dying for this engagement to be canceled.She took a deep breath and suppressed the excitement in her heart, wanting to open her mouth.\u201cMother, since Duke Ding Residence is sincere. Why don\u2019t we just agree on this matter?\u201dSaying this, Madam Zhang awkwardly looked at Jiang Ningbao and gave her an apologetic smile, \u201cFourth girl, don\u2019t blame oldest aunt. This is also for your own good. Being a duke residence\u2019s young miss is better than being a count residence\u2019s young miss.\u201dJiang Ningbao did not say anything but her pair of beautiful eyes stared at Madam Zhang silently. There was no longer any gentleness and her brows emanated coldness.Really her \u2018good\u2019 relatives.Benefit for Changning Count Residence and loss for her reputation.If her parents were still here\u2026..Jiang Ningbao could not help thinking about her parents who were \u2018deceased\u2019 and her older brother who was still studying at Azure Mountain Academy. Her heart was bitter. She and her older brother Jiang Jin had a good relationship. Jiang Jin already had already passed the county level imperial examination and was now studying at the academy to prepare for this year\u2019s provincial examination. He wanted to pass, gave honor to the second branch, and let her marry with pride.But a pity he did not know that his little sister\u2019s engagement was being canceled.Remembering the ending of the second branch, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart was doused with cold water.Madam Zhang was being stared until her guilty conscience came out. She felt angry and silently thought that this niece could not tell good from bad. She turned to Old Madam Jiang who was silent and called in an anxious voice, \u201cMother!\u201dJiang Mingyao\u2019s face changed. Her mother\u2019s attitude made her felt worse. She closed her eyes and did not dare to glance at her fourth sister. She was afraid that she would see a look of despair.Old Madam Jiang\u2019s heart waver even more. Between exchanging a granddaughter that she did not like for her legitimate grandson\u2019s future, she would choose the latter.But she could not agree too quickly since Old Madam Jiang really value her face. She had slapped herself once and although she said to think it through, she really wanted to agree right now. But if she did that, she would leave a bad impression on the servants present.Seeing her oldest daughter-in-law being so impatient, old madam wanted to scold her for being an idiot. Where was the calculation she had usually?Not receiving a reply from Old Madam Jiang, First Madam Zhang\u2019s face sunk.Butler Zhao waited patiently. He looked at the delicate looking Jiang fourth miss from the corner of his eye and noticed her expressionless face. His heart felt weird.Jiang fourth miss\u2019 reaction was not normal.A moment later, Old Madam Jiang glared at Madam Zhang and said sternly, \u201cMadam Zhang, fourth girl is mu legitimate granddaughter. Her marriage will be according to my decision, you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What did mother mean by this?\u201cGrandmother, since it\u2019s related to granddaughter\u2019s happiness, can granddaughter speak up?\u201d Jiang Ningbao suddenly smiled and her voice was light. There was no anger or unwillingness in it.Once Butler Zhao heard this Jiang fourth miss speaking, he could not help but become curious.Her granddaughter who was usually gentle suddenly spoke up at this moment made Old Madam Jiang\u2019s heart to jump. She frowned and her eyes flashed with unhappiness. She could not berate Jiang Ningbao in front of Butler Zhao so she spoke faintly, \u201cYou can speak.\u201dJiang Ningbao smiled faintly and the gentle helplessness between her brows was gone. \u201cGrandmother, granddaughter can agree to cancel the engagement. Since getting married is knotting two families together and sir heir does not like granddaughter, granddaughter is not someone who likes to force things.\u201dOld Madam Jiang felt relieved. Jiang Ningbao\u2019s words were spoken on time and excused Old Madam Jiang to feel troubled. Old Madam Jiang gave her a amicable smile.\u201cIf fourth girl can think like that, then that\u2019s good.\u201dFirst Madam also heaved a sigh of relief silently, her heart coming back to the ground. As long as this niece did not hold onto this engagement tightly then all was good. Engagement was gone but she could become sir heir\u2019s little sister. Their count residence would get some benefits from it.Most important was her second son could get a fifth rank official position.In Madam Zhang\u2019s heart, this position was her second son\u2019s. She did not even think about Jiang Ningbao\u2019s older brother Jiang Jin who was talented.\u201cGrandmother, granddaughter does not want to become sir heir\u2019s little sister.\u201d Jiang Ningbao pretended she did not see Madam Zhang\u2019s reaction and lifted her head to stare at Old Madam Jiang.Once these words came out, Old Madam Jiang\u2019s happy face sunk and almost threw the teacups to this fourth girl she disliked. She roared, \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201dMadam Zhang glared at Jiang Ningbao and thought that this niece was really idiotic.Duke Ding Residence\u2019s oldest miss. That was a position that even princesses had to respect and make friends with.This niece was really an ignorant lard.So idiotic that people could not look at it.Madam Zhang looked at her daughter who had a cool aura and pretty face and felt if this kind of good thing fell on her daughter\u2019s head, it would be better.A pity her daughter was not that lucky.\u201cButler Zhao, canceling the engagement is alright, but I don\u2019t want to become sir heir\u2019s littler sister Why don\u2019t we change the compensation?\u201dJiang Ningbao was not scared of Old Madam Jiang\u2019s rage. She stared at Butler Zhao and patted her ruby bracelet softly as she asked gently.Butler Zhao was stunned and asked in curiosity, \u201cWhat compensation does the fourth miss wants?\u201d\u201cSir heir is really skilled, giving a compensation people cannot refuse. I\u2019ve seen his determination in canceling the engagement. But I\u2019m not resigned. Why should I give away the title of fiancee to Yang Shuqing? Just because my status is lower than hers, do I have to lower my head and give way to her?\u201d\u201cI will not. So I\u2019ve decided that I agree to cancel the engagement, but I want to marry Duke Ding. I want to step on their heads. Butler Zhao, the compensation I want is this.\u201dJiang Ningbao glanced at Butler Zhao with a smile and spoke with a pace that was not fast nor was it slow, but the words spoken shocked everyone present.Butler Zhao was shocked.He thought that this Jiang fourth miss was weak and timid, only enduring even when her engagement was canceled. He didn\u2019t think that she would be waiting for this moment.Old Madam Jiang and First Madam Zhang was shocked by Jiang Ningbao who suddenly became tough and unyielding, different from her usual gentleness. Jiang Mingyao snapped her heard at her fourth sister who was no longer timid with surprise in her eyes.Was this still that weak and gentle fourth sister?Not only were they in disbelief, the servants in the hall were also shocked till their jaws dropped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A highly skilled eminent monk passed by coincidentally and saw that when Duke Ding was born, he carried near boundless ominous energy. He personally carried Duke Ding away and only then did Old Madam Xie return from death\u2019s door.What made people feel strange was that this monk did not ask Duke Ding to enter the monastery to cleanse the ominous energy but gathered ten highly skilled monks and spent nine nine eighty one days to consecrate a string of red sandalwood beads to wear on his wrist. Only after that did the ominous energy lessened.When Duke Ding was twenty years old, he left home and joined the war within the borders. In just a few years, he made a name for himself, making his enemies terror stricken and not daring to attack. He was given the title of the youngest Duke Protector and became Dayue dynasty\u2019s war deity.It\u2019s a pity that aside from healthy young men, no women dated to get close to him. Even his mother did not dare to. Once they got close to Duke Ding, the lightest reaction was laying on the bed in sickness, the worst was dying.When Duke Ding was at the age of marrying, there were a lot of noble ladies who did not believe in this news and chased after Duke Ding with ferocity. Unfortunately, the result was not optimistic.There were deaths and there were sicknesses. No women dared to get close with this Duke Ding anymore.Great power and influence was important, but life was more important.If there was no life, what could power and influence do?Now, the people around Duke Ding were those who had joined the war and were healthy and robust, but they still needed to be changed every few days because they could not stay around Duke Ding for a long period of time.This was something everyone knew about.But at this moment, the soft and gentle Jiang Ningbao who seemed like she could be toppled down by a gust of wind actually said that she wanted to marry Duke Ding! Everyone thought that she was driven mad by sir heir because of the matter of engagement.\u201cNo way!\u201d Old Madam Jiang snapped out of her shock and slammed the table.Duke Ding Xie Heng had great power and influence just at the young age of twenty eight, but compared to marrying over and dying \u2013 no, even before marrying over, just coming into contact with Duke Ding a few days might take one\u2019s life and the relation to Changning Count Residence would be cut off. It was better to be Duke Ding Residence\u2019s oldest miss. This would deepen their relationship.Jiang Mingyao\u2019s cold face flashed with alarm and bewilderment.Fourth sister\u2026..How could fourth sister be this mad and bet on her own life? She immediately pulled Jiang Ningbao\u2019s hand and squeezed it, then advised her nervously.\u201cFourth sister, don\u2019t joke around. Duke Ding is not someone we can think about.\u201d\u201cGrandmother, this matter relates to granddaughter\u2019s happiness. Please let this granddaughter be willful this once. Please agree.\u201d Jiang Ningbao gently pry off Jiang Mingyao\u2019s hand and lifted her delicate face filled with determination.This was the choice she chose after thinking deeply.When Butler Zhao was speaking, Jiang Ningbao went through the novel. The female lead Yang Shuqing was not a kind person. She would get vengeance with cruel methods. The people who condemned her in her past life were all retaliated by her and each with a tragic ending.In the book, Jiang Ningbao and the female lead Yang Shuqing never socialize before.After the female lead got reborn, she stole Jiang Ningbao\u2019s fiance and led Jiang Ningbao to blackened, turning into the book\u2019s biggest venomous canon fodder.Jiang Ningbao would not become that kind of venomous secondary character, but the male lead Xie Jingyi would definitely not let the female lead get the reputation of stealing another\u2019s fiance and got a stain on reputation, so they would inevitably have some encounters.Since she could not escape, why not face it head on?She transmigrated into a sixteen years old ancient girl and lived in the ancient time for sixteen years. Jiang Ningbao\u2019s whole self exuded an aura of nobility, but the personality she had in her previous life won\u2019t change.The one whose engagement was revoked was her and the one whose reputation was sullied was her.Being bullied till this point, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s face was calm and composed. She already had a plan and even Old Madam Jiang did not know of her thoughts.Declaring to marry Duke Ding was the first step.Whether Duke Ding responded or not was not in her considerations.As for losing her life\u2026..

Do not mention this matter ever again!\u201dOld Madam Jiang was infuriated by Jaing Ningbao who was stubborn and she staggered as she touched her forehead and fell backward. The close servant Hong Xi quickly supported her.\u201cMother, are you alright?\u201d First Madam Zhang glared at Jiang Ningbao and nervously stepped forward, questioning Old Madam Jiang as she patted her the spot where her heart was.Jiang Ningbao stood there unmoving. Aside from her soft and delicate face, there was no softness or gentleness on her, as if she was a tough and firm rose of Sharon.Blooming splendidly and emanating resplendent light.\u201cFourth young miss, this Zhao cannot decide this matter. Why don\u2019t you wait for this Zhao to report back to the old madam and then give the fourth miss the answer?\u201dAfter Butler Zhao was shocked and saw Old Madam Jiang\u2019s behavior, he immediately cleared his mind. Jiang fourth miss\u2019 suggestion indeed moved Butler Zhao. No matter if the fourth miss made this decision in anger or not, he would take the chance to agree.Rather than Sir Heir, Butler Zhao cared more about Duke Ding who was lonely from young to adult. He hoped there would be someone by his side.Not knowing why, Butler Zhao had a feeling that this Jiang fourth miss would not be affected by Sir Duke\u2019s ominous energy.This kind of instinct had not appeared for a long time after he retired from the battlefield, but it suddenly came out at this time. Butler Zhao glanced at the soft and delicate fourth miss and his gaze carried a trace of suspicion.\u201cI will trouble Butler Zhao.\u201d Jiang Ningbao nodded and ignored Old Madam Jiang who was furious.\u201cOld Madam, the matter of Sir Heir\u2019s engagement must be solved. Please think this through and give a reply two days later. This Zhao will take his leave.\u201d Butler Zhao curtsied and left with his group.He did not give Old Madam Jiang a chance to refuse.\u201cVile spawn! Kneel down!\u201d Once Butler Zhao left, Old Madam Jiang took a porcelain cup and threw it to Jiang Ningbao\u2019s side. With a smash, the porcelain cup shattered into five pieces.The tea stained her skirt and left a mark.Jiang Ningbao pursed her lips and stood straight. Her delicate face had a faint smile on it and her pair of beautiful eyes flashed with a light.\u201cGrandmother. I can agree to the revocation of engagement, but granddaughter will not swallow this injustice. Duke Ding is the person granddaughter respects the most. If granddaughter can marry Duke Ding, even if it results in death, granddaughter will not regret it.\u201d\u201cPlease forgive granddaughter\u2019s willfulness.\u201dOnce she said this sonorously and forcefully, she curtsied to Old Madam Jiang and left the hall without looking back.The servants in the hall all lowered their heads and did not dare to breath loudly. The big hall was so silent that one could hear the sound of leaves falling.Old Madam Jiang had a steam stuck in her throat and her body was trembling in anger. She glared at the silhouette of Jiang Ningbao leaving and her gaze was dark and cold as if one could squeeze water out of it.\u201cThis unfilial granddaughter! Really rebellious!\u201dJiang Mingyao was stunned silly and her heart had complicated emotions in it. She did not think that revoking the engagement would give fourth sister such a huge blow until she dared to go against grandmother.The servant Hong Xi carefully served a bowl of tea soup over. \u201cOld Madam, please don\u2019t get angry and place a burden on your body. Drink the tea and calm down.\u201dOld Madam Jiang took the tea bowl over and drank it. She turned calmer immediately.\u201cMother, what about fourth girl\u2019s matter?\u201d First Madam Zhang took notice of the situation and asked.This was related to her son\u2019s future.Madam Zhang was worried.Old Madam Jiang heard her oldest daughter-in-law mentioning her rebellious granddaughter and the fire in her heart blaze once more.She originally disliked Jiang Ningbao who looked soft and delicate and now that Jiang Ningbao hardened herself, Old Madam Jiang felt that her authority was challenged.Since Duke Ding Residence wanted to revoke the engagement\u2026..Then this granddaughter was useless. It would be hard to seek a good engagement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The ones left was only Madam Zhang and her granddaughter Jiang Mingyao. She laughed coldly, \u201cSince fourth girl wants to get married to Duke Ding then let her. She could not protect her engagement anyway, I want to see what kind of things she could do. Aside from that fifth rank official, don\u2019t forget to ask for more compensation.\u201dFirst Madam Zhang heard this and her eyes flashed with a calculative glint, \u201cMother is right. But like this, our relationship with Duke Ding Residence will end.\u201dTo be truthful, Madam Zhang was not willing to lose the relationship with Duke Ding Residence.Old Madam Jiang glanced at her oldest daughter-in-law and sipped her tea soup. She gave her a pointer, \u201cIsn\u2019t there still the Xie family? Fifth girl is almost sixteen and her engagement should be decided. I see that Xie family\u2019s second branch is not bad.\u201dJiang Mingyao was stunned and her cool face was written with surprise and bewilderment.Grandmother\u2026..grandmother wanted to make use of fourth sister\u2019s engagement being canceled to let her marry into the Xie family.How could they? How could they?Madam Zhang came to a realization. She remembered that Xie family\u2019s second branch had legitimate son who had just turned sixteen and without any engagement. He was the biological brother of Duke Ding\u2019s heir.As long as Yao\u2019er marry over, they could still had some relationship with Duke Ding Residence.Xie family\u2019s second branch\u2019s young master was a popular target. The people who wanted to marry over to Xie family\u2019s second branch were a lot and Changning Count Residence had nothing special to show.But now this chance came.\u201cThanking mother for giving pointer.\u201dFirst Madam Zhang squinted her eyes and they were full of calculations. Using the matter of her niece\u2019s engagement being annulled, she could get that engagement. Her niece\u2019s value was only this anyway.Old Madam Jiang saw her oldest daughter-in-law\u2019s gaze and nodded in satisfaction. It was still the oldest daughter-in-law who suit her the most, not like the daughter-in-law her second son married, not respectful and envious. When that woman was alive, her job was to anger her, this old madam, to death.Thinking about Madam Yang who was deceased and thinking about the fourth miss, the foolish granddaughter she gave birth to, Old Madam Jiang became angrier.\u201cThis matter must be dealt with quickly. You should send someone over to the Duke Residence later. I\u2019m tired. You should go down.\u201dOld Madam Jiang waved her hand and gestured for Madam Zhang to leave.Madam Zhang gave her respect and left. She called her trusted servant over in happiness and whispered some things in her ear. The servant then left the Changning Count Residence.Madam Zhang stood on the residence\u2019s winding corridor and stared at her trusted servant\u2019s leaving back. Her mouth curved into a smile subconsciously and said to Jiang Mingyao, \u201cYao\u2019er, mother found you a good marriage.\u201dJiang Mingyao glanced at her mother\u2019s smiling face with complicated emotions. She thought of her fourth sister who was given a blow so huge that her personality changed and she felt guilty. She pursed her lips and turned her face away, rejected coldly.\u201cMother, fourth sister is pitiful enough. I don\u2019t want to step on fourth sister to marry into the Xie family.\u201dFirst Madam Zhang\u2019s face changed and her voice was warm and gently as she persuaded.\u201cYao\u2019er, this concerns your future happiness. Don\u2019t be willful.\u201dJiang Mingyao stayed silent and her clear eyes gazed at Madam Zhang with rejection.She understood that her mother not only wanted the fifth rank official position in the compensation, she also wanted to use fourth sister until there\u2019s nothing left.Once she thought of the marriage was obtained by stepping on fourth sister, Jiang Mingyao\u2019s heart was uncomfortable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She ignored the servants who secretly glanced at her and gossiped among themselves.The matter of Butler Zhao visiting to annul the engagement could not be kept secret and it was already circulating around the capital.\u201cLady, are you alright?\u201d Chun Xi glanced at her young miss carefully. She thought back to Duke Ding Residence\u2019s Butler Zhao and could not help but ask in worry.Jiang Ningbao smiled faintly and gazed at the small garden nearby. The flowers in the garden were blossoming and she answered happily, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201dShe\u2019s indeed good. Being a delicate young miss for many years then revealing a little of her true face and shocking everyone till their jaws drop made Jiang Ningbao felt free and happy.Chun Xi gazed at the young miss\u2019 charming smile and not knowing why, her heart felt unsettled, feeling that her young miss was not right somewhere.When she went to the kitchen to grab evening lunch, she was notified of what her young miss did and trembled. How could the miss be this foolish?She took the lunch box hurriedly and went back to the courtyard. Chun Xi saw her young miss standing under an osmanthus flower tree, her delicate white face was filled with longing, as if she was a scroll of beautiful painting.Chun Xi subconsciously slow down her steps.\u201cLady, you\u2019re missing the second master and the second mistress again.\u201dJiang Ningbao nodded. She thought of the jars of wine buried under this osmanthus flower tree. A few of those jars were made by her and her father together and also buried them together. She sighed, \u201cIf mom and dad knew my engagement was annulled, they would be sad\u201dTransmigrating into ancient times, Jiang Ningbao was pampered by her parents.Thinking to the book where \u2018her\u2019 parents took revenge for \u2018her\u2019, Jiang Ningbao raised her lips. Her parents were not dead.It\u2019s something to be happy about.A pity that the book did not disclose where her parents were, only saying that they were rescued by someone in an isolated place. Dad broke his legs and mom got amnesia so they both could not go back to Changning Count Residence.\u201cLady\u2026..\u201d Chun Xi felt heartache for her. Her lady was pitiful. Second master and second mistress were gone and without her parents, her engagement was now annulled.Jiang Ningbao turned her head back to see Chun Xi. Chun Xi was her trusted servant and always served by her side, never leaving. She even did many evil things for \u2018her\u2019 and sold to a dirty place.\u201cIs there anything delicious in today\u2019s menu?\u201d Jiang Ningbao smiled.Chun Xi immediately mentioned a few dishes, \u201cThere\u2019s the chicken shred bird nest soup you like and eight treasures duck, stir-fry guinea fowl, sweet and sour ribs, jade bean cake, and stir-fry vegetables.\u201dShe thought that the kitchen staffs would decrease the lady\u2019s meal after her engagement was annulled, who knew that it was still the same as usual?Chun Xi released a breath silently.Jiang Ningbao raised her brow and did not say anything. She turned to her room to eat lunch. Actually, Jiang Ningbao did not care whether they decreased her meals or not. Her mother\u2019s dowry was in her hand so she did not need to worry about food and clothes.She could even open a little kitchen for herself in this courtyard.It was just Jiang Ningbao was too lazy to do that.The meals the kitchen made was delicious. As long as the quality had not gone down, she did not mind if they cut down the amount.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang Ningbao sat on the short couch and boiled a pot of fragrant leaves as she gazed at the osmanthus flower tree outside, her thoughts flying.Speaking about the engagement between Sir Heir Xie Jingyi and her, the book did not describe it but Jiang Ningbao was clear about it. Summing into a phrase, it would be life-saving gratitude, knotting the two families together.Her mother Madam Yang rescued Xie family\u2019s second madam and six years old Xie Jingyi when she was just three years old. At that time, Xie Jingyi had not been adopted by Duke Ding.After Xie family\u2019s second branch madam was rescued and knew that this mother had a three years old daughter, the second madam suggested getting engaged. Her mother, Madam Yang, seeing Xie Jingyi being smart and sensitive, also good looking, agreed.The two families were considered well-matched in social and economic status.Xie family was a famous nobility and was deep rooted with branches multiplied and leaves growing splendidly, especially after the Xie family produced a Duke Ding, it was even more lustrous and famous.Xie family\u2019s second branch had a lot of children but the ones who were outstanding were very few. In the Xie clan, their standing was ordinary but they produced Xie Jingyi who was good looking and smart.Xie Jingyi was acknowledged by Old Madam Xie when he was eight years old and under the witness of the clan, he was adopted to Duke Ding, becoming Duke Ding Residence\u2019s sir heir. She who was his fiancee also rose in status, becoming the lady other noble ladies envied.\u201cFor the girl he likes, he harms the daughter of the person who saved his life and then joined the female lead to destroy her family\u2026.. this male lead is really an ungrateful one.\u201dJiang Ningbao sipped her tea and murmured.The book never mentioned this, only saying that Jiang Ningbao was not resigned and pestered the male lead. No, it was mentioned after the reputation of Jiang Ningbao being a venomous woman who did her best to ruin Yang Shuqing but the timing was late. Aside from the people who originally knew of this and aside from her parents, no one was willing to speak up hence others did not believe this.Only feeling that she was carelessly climbing and bit onto the newly appointed Duke Ding.Jiang Ningbao knitted her brows and her gaze was wondering. A moment later, she realized something and sighed, \u201cWhat a foolish child.\u201dMatters of the heart were always puzzling.Fortunately, she was not the book\u2019s \u2018her\u2019.Having memory from her past life, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s feelings to Xie Jingyi was faint. Xie Jingyi was not her type but since she was already engaged to him, Jiang Ningbao planned to spend the rest of her life with a life of mutual respect.Who knew that she found out that she transmigrated into a book?And facing engagement annulment too.No one knew the excitement and happiness inside Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart.Chun Xi came back at this time, carrying a basket full of red strawberries. She opened the eight treasures bead curtain and put the strawberries that were already washed clean to the side of the short couch. After hesitating a few times, Chun Xi bit her lips an complaint.\u201cLady, Manager Yao send a crate of strawberries over and First Madam sent someone to take more than half of it over.\u201dManager Yao was the person responsible for managing Jiang Ningbao\u2019s dowry shops.These past three years, he would send some fresh fruits over to Changning Count Residence and Azure Mountain Academy. It\u2019s a pity that most of it went to First Madam Zhang\u2019s pocket.Every single time it happened, Chun Xi could not help but felt heartache.\u201cChun Xi, don\u2019t bother these small things. Oldest aunt won\u2019t dare to do it too much.\u201dJiang Ningbao laughed lightly and ate a strawberry. She spoke with indifference.Chun Xi thought it over and agreed. These past three years, First Madam never took all of the fruits Manager Yao sent over. But aside from the fruits, there was another matter Chun Xi was worried about.\u201cLady, First Madam actually let the servants discussed the matter of your engagement being annulled! The whole capital might already know that Duke Ding Residence annulled the engagement!\u201dJiang Ningbao glanced at Chun Xi and a smile appeared on her delicate and gentle face, \u201cIt will spread sooner or later anyway. Chun Xi, we have to stay calm. Isn\u2019t it just annulling the engagement, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201dThe brighter this fire burnt, the better.Chun Xi bit her lips and felt unfair for her lady. \u201cBut\u2026..but it\u2019s not young miss\u2019 fault!\u201dJiang Ningbao smiled faintly and blinked at Chun Xi.\u201cChun Xi, there are a lot of thing that won\u2019t go as we like, who knows that something better awaits us at the end?\u201dThen, she took another strawberry and ate it. Jiang Ningbao squinted her eyes in satisfaction and felt weird. How could no one spread the rumor of her wanting to marry Duke Ding?In Jiang Ningbao\u2019s perspective, Duke Ding was much better than Xie Jingyi that ungrateful b**tard. A pity he was not the male lead, only someone who delivered a cheat to the male lead and had to die early to let the male lead pick the power and status cheaply then stabilize his position as the male lead.What a disappointment.Fortunately, she had the ability of miraculous wine brewing. The wine she brewed had mystical effects. As long as she married Duke Ding and brewed him medicinal wine, he would have no problem living until hundred years.Speaking about it, she\u2019s a professional.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes flashed with a brilliant light..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She did not know that her young miss bravely declared that she wanted to marry Duke Ding. If not, she would\u2019ve been scared silly.\u201cBut, but young miss\u2019 engagement being annulled. It won\u2019t be easy to find another good engagement.\u201d Chun Xi was upset.Especially if the one annulling the engagement was Duke Ding Residence\u2019s sir heir.Jiang Ningbao smiled and she subconsciously emanated a trace of tender and delicate charm, evoking other\u2019s pity.\u201cChun Xi, what do you think about Duke Ding?\u201d\u201cWhen Butler Zhao was here to annul the engagement, I was stirred and declared that I will marry Duke Ding. Butler Zhao already agreed to tell Old Madam Xie.\u201dJiang Ningbao leisurely threw a bomb.\u201cLady, Duke Ding is a good person, but\u2026..but he\u2019s not the one! He\u2019s too dangerous! The ladies who got near him never end well. Lady, you must not think of weird things!\u201dChun Xi was horrified and persuaded in worry.\u201cChun Xi, who knew that me and Duke Ding may be a match made in heaven and tied with red string of fate.\u201d Jiang Ningbao glanced at Chun Xi\u2019s horrified face and sipped her tea as she said a joke that might or might not be true.In her previous life, aside from her mystical wine brewing ability, she had no other ability. But no matter the danger she face, every time her team got annihilated, she would luckily survive.She did not know whether it was because her life was too hard to crush or she was just unlucky.At last, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s friends and family were gone one by one, leaving her alone to survive in the world filled with zombies. Until the zombie king was killed and the world regained its life, she no longer had any desire to live and\u2026.. and committed suicide.Who knew that after suicide she would fail to die and transmigrate to ancient time.It was no longer a world of wounds and traumas with no close person for her. In this world, she had parents who spoiled her and she was able to eat various kinds of delicious food as she liked and then brewed all kinds of mystical wines. Jiang Ningbao once again had the desire to live.A woman like her whose life was too hard to crush, wasn\u2019t she a destined match with Duke Ding?The room went silent for a moment.A destined match\u2026..Dare to ask, which woman was a destined match with Duke Ding?Chun Xi took a deep breath and tried to get rid of her lady\u2019s dangerous thought, \u201cLady, before you, there are a lot of noble ladies who did not believe this and went forward. Those ladies only lived for one until the longest of seven days, each with a tragic ending. As time passes, no woman dared to get near Duke Ding.\u201d\u201cLady, you cannot endanger yourself.\u201d\u201cLady, why don\u2019t you think about the third young master? If third young master knows about this matter, he will be worried for you.\u201dHearing Chun Xi mentioned her biological older brother Jiang Jin, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s face softened. Wait a sec, she seemed to forget to write a letter to her older brother who was studying at the Azure Mountain Academy.She wanted to prevent her older brother worrying from the rumor circulating outside and hurry back home with no mood to study.Jiang Ningbao suddenly stood up and walked to the side of the long narrow table and ignored Chun Xi who was worrying by her side. She spread out the paper, rubbed the ink stink against an inkstone, and began to write a letter. She wrote to him what happened during the engagement annulment process and her own plans. She sealed the letter and gave it Chun Xi with instructions, \u201cChun Xi, give the letter to Manager Yao, let him deliver this to Azure Mountain Academy.\u201d\u201cYes, lady.\u201d Chun Xi thought she had successfully persuaded her lady and released a breath. She carefully tucked in the letter and left in a hurry.Not long after Chun Xi left, a few young and old servants came to the courtyard. One of them was an old servant who was deeply trusted by First Madam Zhang.Old servant Yang greeted Jiang Ningbao expressionlessly.\u201cFourth lady, the madam sent you a book and hopes that you copy it once. You should do things prudently in the future, do not offend the elders.\u201dSaying this, a servant girl respectfully gave Jiang Ningbao a book.Jiang Ningbao looked at the book and noticed the big title: Women Commandment. A book that dictated how a female should act.Oldest aunt wanted her to copy this book?Jiang Ningbao put the book back to the hands of the servant girl and gently said, \u201cServant Yang, bring this book back. I don\u2019t need it.\u201dThat\u2019s right. She did not need this thing.Oldest aunt wanted to gave her a blow with this book, truly ridiculous.Old servant Yang\u2019s eyes darkened and domineeringly put the book to Jiang Ningbao\u2019s bosom. She coldly said, \u201cFourth lady, this is the first madam\u2019s order.\u201d\u201cShhshshh\u2026..\u201dThe book that was forcefully given was shred into pieces by Jiang Ningbao.

How dare she!The servants around her were shocked with their eyes bulging.Their hearts was guessing that the fourth miss might be stimulated too much from the annulment of her engagement.Yes, it must be like this. The few servants who were informative had known that the fourth miss said in front of the old madam that even if she would die marrying over, she would have no regrets.Fourth miss was seeking death, ah.The hearts of the servant girls trembled. Don\u2019t look at fourth miss\u2019 soft and gentle appearance. If she hardened her heart, she would be terrifying.Jiang Ningbao fixed her eyes at old servant Yang and as if she did not notice old servant Yang\u2019s sunk face, she smiled a little but her voice turned ice cold, \u201cOld servant Yang, you go back and tell oldest aunt. Women Commandment this kind of thing, how many she send will be how many I shred.\u201dOld servant Yang glared at Jiang Ningbao and left with the servant girls furiously.Jiang Ningbao sipped her fragrant tea. She did not think that oldest aunt would act so quickly. If it was old madam who sent it over, she would not shred it but feigned compliance.This old servant Yang\u2026..bully people by flaunting her powerful connection. A fake tiger.From a few years back from the moment her daughter wanted to get into her father\u2019s bed and failed, then sold mercilessly, old servant Yang hated the second branch. When dad was still here, she did not dare to do anything. After her parents \u2018died\u2019 and she, the second branch\u2019s miss, lost her backing, old servant Yang became brave from the support of Madam Zhang.She also did some things in the dark against her.Jiang Ningbao smiled coldly in her heart.Right then, there was the sound of footsteps outside. Not long later, someone knocked on the door, seemingly unsettled.\u201cFourth sister, are you here?\u201dJiang Ningbao did not think that her fifth sister Jiang Mingyao would visit her.\u201cYou may enter.\u201dFifth sister was, how should she put it, a person with a cool personality and her morals were not screwed. She did not resemble Madam Zhang at all, but in this era of parents being the matchmaker, she had to marry Xie Jingyi\u2019s legitimate little brother in the end.In the book, after she got married, because of her guilt toward Jiang Ningbao, she secretly helped Jiang Ningbao many times.And then after she was found out by Xie Jingyi and the female lead, Jiang Mingyao who had not given birth to any child was schemed and detested by her husband.

She looked the the shredded pages and found out that the book was Woman Commandment.Thinking back to her meeting old servant Yang on her way here, Jiang Mingyao\u2019s heart sunk and she pursed her lips. Her cool voice carried a trace of apology.\u201cFourth sister, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dJiang Ningbao smiled and gestured her to come closer then poured her some tea.\u201cFifth sister, it\u2019s no your fault, don\u2019t worry too much. This is the spring tea Manager Yao sent over, you should try it.\u201dJiang Mingyao sat in front of Jiang Ningbao and sipped the tea. The slight bitterness entered her throat. She glanced at fourth sister\u2019s tranquil face and her unsettled heart became calm. She then spoke in a low voice.\u201cFourth sister, grandmother and my mother favored Xie family\u2019s second branch\u2019s legitimate second son, Xie Jinghui. They want me\u2026..they want me to get married to him.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m not willing.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to step on fourth sister and get married to Xie Jinghui.\u201dJiang Ningbao already knew Madam Zhang\u2019s calculations from the book. \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 did not agree to the engagement annulment no matter what but First Madam secretly formed an agreement with Duke Ding Residence and forcefully annulled the engagement.All the benefits were reaped by Madam Zhang.But now that she agreed to the annulment but was not willing to be the heir\u2019s little sister, also declaring that she wanted to marry Duke Ding, their calculations went off.First Madam Zhang and Old Madam Jiang must be furious.But fifth sister\u2019s destiny was still the same. Fifth sister being bound to Xie family\u2019s second branch was imperative.\u201cFifth sister, Xie Jinghui this guy, as long as you don\u2019t cross his bottom line, he\u2019s not bad.\u201d Jiang Ningbao spoke softly, stating the fact.No matter how hateful Madam Zhang was, fifth sister was innocent.Jiang Ningbao was not the kind of person to drag innocent people into her vengeance.The book\u2019s Xie Jinghui had some feelings toward Jiang Mingyao. As long as Jiang Mingyao rectify her attitude and not distanced herself from him because of guilt, then got schemed by another that caused Xie Jinghui to wear down his feeling toward her. She might even be happy with him.Sometimes, a little change could make the whole picture different.Jiang Mingyao was stunned. She lifted her eyes to look at the smiling fourth sister and slowly asked, \u201cFourth sister, you\u2026..you\u2019re not mad?\u201d\u201cWhy should I get mad? I\u2019m just a niece and you are oldest aunt\u2019s biological daughter. Who she gets close to, isn\u2019t it obvious? I\u2019ve said, right? I admire Duke Ding. Even if I die getting married to him, I won\u2019t regret it.\u201d Jiang Ningbao smiled and the smile carried gentleness that belonged to a girl.This was actually not true. Jiang Ningbao was someone who cherished her life in this lifetime.She carried an undying body type and aside from dying from old age or committing suicide, she won\u2019t die like a weed that won\u2019t die from being burnt. Her life-force was so strong it was shocking. This was why she could think about Duke Ding. If they met and he was to her liking, Jiang Ningbao did not mind chasing after him.Old Madam Xie should not be a challenge.As for whether or not Duke Ding agree, Jiang Ningbao did not care.She would get him one day.Jiang Ningbao was being domineering and confident.Jiang Mingyao looked at fourth sister in shock. She suddenly felt that fourth sister\u2019s smile was very beautiful.\u201cFourth sister, Duke Ding is a very dangerous person. Don\u2019t play around with your life just for getting even.\u201dJiang Ningbao just smiled at this but the determination in her eyes was seen by Jiang Mingyao. Jiang Mingyao was very worried and just when she was about to speak, Jiang Ningbao warmly patted her hand, \u201cFifth sister, this relates to my happiness. I have my own plan, don\u2019t you worry.\u201dJiang Mingyao could only carry her guilt as she left.The courtyard became silent.Jiang Ningbao took a pile of accounting books as she sipped her tes. She slowly looked it over while the tiny rays of warm sunlight peeked from the window, shining on the table. The atmosphere was bright and warm.First Madam Zhang who was in the central courtyard received old servant Yang\u2019s report and she was furious. She suddenly smashed the teacup in her hand and spoke with a sunken face, \u201cGood, very good! Fourth girl is very disobedient. When this engagement is successfully canceled, I will take care of her!\u201dOld servant Yang heard this and her old face showed joy. She fanned the oil by saying, \u201cMadam is right. Fourth miss\u2019 marriage is in your hands.\u201dOld servant Yang was a venomous person.She was just a servant so even if she hated the second branch, she could not do things in the open, only doing some things in the dark. Only the first madam could get rid of the fourth miss.First Madam Zhang smiled coldly, \u201cFourth girl recklessly declared wanting to get married to Duke Ding. See if she had that destiny! It\u2019s good if she\u2019s dead but if she isn\u2019t, then I will find her a \u2018good\u2019 marriage.\u201dOld servant Yang was happy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The incense smoke wafted in the air.Old Madam Xie whose hair was all white slowly sipped her tea as she heard Butler Zhao\u2019s report, her expression changing.Her son\u2019s marriage was always Old Madam Xie\u2019s sore point. But she was helpless since her son had that kind of body constitution that led to women hiding from her son. Now, there\u2019s actually a girl who did not want her life who wanted to get married to her son!Even if she was once her adopted grandson\u2019s fiancee, it\u2019s fine.Jiang family\u2019s fourth miss was born into Changing Count Residence\u2019s second branch. Both her looks and her background was not bad. If she really could resist her son\u2019s ominous energy\u2026..Old Madam Xie\u2019s eyes flashed.She\u2019s only a mother who wanted her son to have a wife who could accompany him. The adopted grandson and those etiquette was not as important as her son.Old servant Huang was Old Madam Xie\u2019s trusted servant and also Butler Zhao\u2019s wife. She was once the servant who followed Old Madam Xie after marriage and the one who knew Old Madam Xie the most. She glanced at Old Madam Xie and spoke.\u201cOld Madam, why don\u2019t we take Jiang fourth miss\u2019 eight characters to Monk Gao to see if she\u2019s suitable with Duke Ding\u2019s eight characters. If she is, then the change of the engagement should not be a problem.\u201dOld Madam Xie only sipped her tea, but the wavering in her eyes became stronger.\u201cYou\u2019re right. There\u2019s nothing wrong in trying.\u201dButler Zhao released a breath mentally. He took out a card with the horoscope and respectfully gave it. \u201cOld Madam, this is Jiang fourth miss\u2019 horoscope.\u201dThe horoscope card should be returned at first, but Changning Count Residence had not agreed to the annulment officially so Jiang Ningbao\u2019s horoscope card was not sent back.Old Madam Xie nodded and her eyes flashed with anticipation. She gestured for Old servant Huang to keep it.\u201cOld Madam, there\u2019s another thing. Changning Count Residence\u2019s first madam sent someone over with a condition.\u201d Butler Zhao thought back to the servant send by Countess Changning and his heart pity Jiang fourth miss even more.\u201cWhat condition?\u201d\u201cCountess Changning hoped that her youngest daughter can get married with Xie family\u2019s second branch, Young Master Xie Jinghui.\u201d Butler Zhao respectfully answered. He had not good impression on Countess Changning who stepped on Jiang fourth miss to get benefit.Old Madam Xie snapped her head and frowned. She said with indifference, \u201cI will not get involved in this matter. You tell the heir and he will decide.\u201dIn the end, the one who wanted to annul the engagement was that grandson so he should be the one dealing with the problems that came after.Old Madam Xie originally liked this adopted grandson and he was also from the Xie clan\u2019s main house so she doted on him and let the servants call him \u2018heir\u2019. Who knew that he would cancel his engagement with Jiang fourth lady for Anyuan Marquis\u2019 legal daughter? Old Madam Xie could not accept this. She knew how their engagement came to be so toward his action, there was a knot in her heart.A girl having her engagement canceled and the etiquette was harsh on girls so that girl would either be married off randomly or she would be sent to the monastery to be a nun.How could they talk about happiness?Especially a girl whose parents were deceased. Even if she had a good brother, but since he had not gained merits, adding the fact that Countess Changning was a calculative person, one could guess the difficulty Jiang fourth miss was facing.But Duke Ding Residence still needed him to impart and inherit.Old Madam Xie closed an eye on this matter and helped him clean up after his mess and compensated Jiang fourth miss. She secretly hoped that Jiang fourth miss\u2019 eight characters were compatible with her son\u2019s, so her grandson won\u2019t destroy a life.\u201cButler Zhao, don\u2019t let the heir know the compensation Jiang fourth miss wants. As for Changning Count Residence, there shouldn\u2019t be any word leaking about Jiang fourth miss declaring she wants to get married to my son.\u201dOld Madam Xie could not help giving instructions. She did not want Jiang fourth miss being dissed at this time, even if her eight characters were not compatible with her son\u2019s.Butler Zhao agreed and did not tell the heir.The result was as Old Madam Xie expected. Old Madam Jiang and First Madam Zhang did not leak what Jiang Ningbao said.So outsiders only knew that Butler Zhao visited to annul the engagement.Even the male lead Xie Jingyi did not know that his former fiancee would agree to the annulment and wanted to marry his adopted dad, Duke Ding, without any reluctance..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now, the whole capital was talking about this and without Jiang Ningbao knowing this, she gained a lot of pity.It was obviously not her fault but she had her engagement rescinded by the guy.This Changning Count Residence\u2019s fourth miss was too pitiful.There were people who felt pity and there were people who took this chance to condemn another. Yang Shuqing being the female lead naturally made a lot of females jealous. Along with the growth of her reputation, the people being jealous of her also increased drastically, growing stubble after stubble.Xie Jingyi who had a very good reputation also got himself dissed by a lot of people.\u201cJiang fourth miss is really pitiful.\u201d\u201cJiang fourth miss is also unlucky. She\u2019s done nothing wrong but her engagement is annulled. I wonder how attractive Yang Oldest Miss is or is it Heir Xie who is too heartless?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t speak recklessly. Duke Ding\u2019s heir annul the engagement because of responsibility. I heard that Duke Ding\u2019s heir wants to adopt Jiang fourth miss as little sister and enter the clan genealogy book. Actually, turning from fiancee to little sister is not bad.\u201d\u201cAs if! What kind of \u2018being responsible\u2019 is this? Don\u2019t insult the word \u2018responsibility\u2019. In my opinion, this Xie heir is also a heartless and merciless person. Who knows what kind of drug Oldest Miss Yang fed him? It\u2019s just Jiang fourth miss is pitiful.\u201d\u201cActually, being the oldest miss of Duke Ding Residence is not bad.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018not bad\u2019? Jiang fourth miss is an outsider. Even if she enters the Xie clan genealogy book, it might not be bad at first, but who can guarantee what happens after she got married?\u201d\u201cI have inside news. Oldest Miss Yang and Xie Heir knew each other from a long time ago. Oldest Miss Yang falling into the pond at Princess Rui\u2019s Peach Blossom Banquet is actually a calculated plan.\u201d\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true. There are only a few people who know this.\u201d\u201cThe truth is actually like this. Xie Heir already has plans on revoking the engagement. Jiang fourth miss is so pitiful, being schemed by Oldest Miss Yang and Xie Heir like this.\u201d\u201cI even thought that Oldest Miss Yang is a smart and wise person, comparable to men! I never thought that she is a scheming person and shamelessly schemed to get another girl\u2019s fiance.\u201dJiang Ningbao who stayed in the residence did not know how wild the rumor circulated. The female lead Yang Shuqing and the male lead Xie Jingyi were condemned a lot while Jiang Ningbao became the person everyone pitied.If she knew, she would only laugh like a pig.It was useless to condemn the main characters. The more they were condemned, the brighter it would be when they washed themselves white.Anyuan Marquis ResidenceYang Shuqing sat in front of the make-up desk. She glanced at the reflection of a beautiful girl on the mirror and her heart felt sweet. She never thought that the powerful Duke Ding Heir in her past life would cancel his engagement with Jiang Ningbao for her.\u201cJiang fourth miss, I really did not steal your fiance on purpose.\u201dYang Shuqing murmured and her eyes flashed with hesitation. In the end, she rose and walked to the long desk to write a letter and instructed her trusted servant girl Qian Bi to send it.\u201cQian Bi, give this letter to Duke Ding\u2019s heir.\u201dQian Bi took the letter and respectfully retreated.Yang Shuqing looked at the incense burner with a complicated gaze. She admitted that she had fallen for Duke Ding Heir, but she had not avenged those people in her past life yet. She had not cruelly enacted her vengeance against King Jin and Queen Jin. How could she marry another?But letting her give up on Xie Jingyi\u2026..She could not.She also wanted to be pampered by another and had the warmth that only belonged to her and no other woman. Only her.This kind of feeling, only Xie Jingyi could give her.In her past life, he only had Jiang Ningbao and she became the target of admiration from other ladies in the capital.Yang Shuqing was one of them.In the years being in the Cold Palace, she had imagined many times if she had not stubbornly wanted to marry over as a noble concubine, cefei, would the ending be different?Even if she could not marry someone like Xie Jingyi who was loyal, she still could become the legal wife.She wanted to proudly and magnificently marry over, becoming the legal wife.This had become Yang Shuqing\u2019s obsession.This life, Yang Shuqing changed her unruly behavior and was not blinded by love anymore. She step by step snatched the initiative and disguised as a man to gather power outside.But the rumor outside was very noisy outside and there were a lot of people hired to condemn her. This must be related to her dad\u2019s concubines and the concubine-born sisters. At this moment, she could not do anything to become the spotlight. That would only make her reputation become worse.Only Xie Heir could do something.But she would not do nothing. Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes darkened and a bright light flashed through her eyes. A moment later, she decided to meet Jiang Ningbao and apologize to her.She did what she thought and she called another trusted servant called Qian Rong. She gave her another letter and instructed something in a low voice. Qian Rong then left quickly..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was still no news which made her raise her brows. She even silently joked that could it be Xie Jingyi did not dare to annul the engagement because of how ferocious the rumor outside was?No, it should not be.The female and male leads in the reborn novel had great attraction to each other, especially Xie Jingyi who already felt like toward Yang Shuqing. How could he let her be wronged?\u201cLady, three days have passed. Heir Xie should not cancel the engagement.\u201dChun Xi\u2019s face was filled with joy. Even if the rumor outside were flying without restraint, but the engagement between the lady and Heir Xie had not been revoked officially. It might not even be canceled.Even the first madam in the residence was still waiting for news and did not dare to do anything excessive.\u201cChun Xi, what are you being happy for? Xie heir also did not say that he will not revoke the engagement.\u201d Jiang Ningbao smiled lightly and poured her a douse of cold water.The happiness in Chun Xi\u2019s face were gone and she glanced at her lady with a trace of blame. Why won\u2019t the lady think positive?\u201cChun Xi, I sent you to watch Duke Ding Residence and Anyuan Marquis Residence\u2019s oldest miss. Is there any new development?\u201d Jiang Ningbao did not care about the male lead Xie Jingyi\u2019s troubles. She only wanted to know what Old Madam Xie was thinking.It\u2019s been three days yet Butler Zhao had not gave them any confirmation.The little and petty moves from oldest aunt had not stop and according to what Jiang Ningbao knew, Madam Zhang\u2019s trusted servant girl often met the page boy by Xie Jingyi\u2019s side. She did not know what deal they made.Jiang Ningbao slowly frowned.Yesterday, the oldest aunt who like to treat her like air came over to gave her a blow. The words hanging on her lips were that annulling the engagement was necessary and let her to not do any petty tricks.Oldest uncle who was ordinary cheaply took the position of Changning Count as the eldest legitimate son and got the six rank official position. These past few years, there was not sign of promotion.The compensation from Duke Ding\u2019s Heir was a fifth rank official position. No need to guess, her oldest uncle must be aiming at this.Jiang Ningbao squinted her eyes and thought indifferently that how could the position fell on the first branch\u2019s hands? There was still her biological brother.\u201cLady, two days ago, Old Madam Xie left Duke Ding Residence and has not return until now. Heir Xie\u2026..Heir Xie and Anyuan Marquis\u2019 oldest miss met privately a few times.\u201dChun Xi was troubled. She lowered her head and did not dare to look at her lady as she report her findings in a small voice.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell this to me?\u201d Jiang Ningbao sipped her tea and her pair of beautiful eyes stared at Chun Xi\u2019s unsettled face, as if reading her mind.\u201cThis servant\u2026..this servant\u2026..\u201d Chun Xi\u2019s face went red and did not dare to explain to her. Could she say that she was afraid that her lady would be sad so she hid this information?How could Jiang Ningbao not know what Chun Xi was thinking? She sighed and softly said, \u201cChun Xi, I won\u2019t pursue this matter this once, but don\u2019t hide anything from me.\u201dDon\u2019t see Jiang Ningbao as a soft and gentle woman. She indeed stayed inside Changning Count Residence most of the time and did not go out, but she had the dowry and connections her mother left her. Jiang Ningbao not only knew everything going on inside of the residence, but also the ones outside.Even first madam and Old Madam Jiang did not know that Jiang Ningbao hid deep.At this time, there was an old servant who greeted from outside the room.\u201cFourth miss, there\u2019s a letter for you.\u201d\u201cChun Xi, take it inside.\u201d Jiang Ningbao was happy. Could it be older brother\u2019s letter? Manager Yao should already gave her letter to older brother.When Chun Xi took the letter over, Jiang Ningbao felt weird because there were two of them.

Seeing the familiar handwriting on the letter, Jiang Ningbap\u2019s mouth curved upward.After reading the letter, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart felt lighter.Her older brother indeed stood by her side. Even though she wanted to marry Duke Ding, her older brother did not oppose and told her to not make him worry and that she should cherish herself right.Chun Xi was worrying by her side. She did not know if third young master had knock out her lady\u2019s idea of marrying Duke Ding or not.Jiang Ningbao kept her older brother\u2019s letter and preciously put it down in a small box. The letters sent from her older brother from Azure Mountain Academy and their usual letters were placed in this small box.Closing the small box, Jiang Ningbao started opening Yang Shuqing\u2019s invitation letter. This was the first time she saw the female lead\u2019s handwriting. Hers was small and flowery. It was pretty and carried a trace of unyielding.These words made even the first supporting male lead King Qin and the male lead Xie Jingyi sighed in admiration.Jiang Ningbao also felt that the female lead\u2019s letters had lingering charms.After admiring the female lead\u2019s writing, she looked at the time and place written on it. A place called Jinjiang Teahouse and a pondering smile grew on her face.\u201cReally can pick the place.\u201dAlmost no one knew that Jinjiang Teahouse was the business she made from when she was ten years old with the support of her parents and also the place where noble madams and noble children loved to visit. The rooms had soundproof walls and the privacy was well-maintained.Jinjiang Teahouse was weird. Its most famous was not tea, but the various types of flower wines.These flower wines were all produced by Jiang Ningbao. Her mystical wine-brewing ability made the flower wines she brewed carried some specialty. To mask this effect, the wines in Jinjiang Teahouse were diluted drastically so the wines would only be a bit better than ordinary wines.Every year at this time, the most popular wine was Peach Blossom Wine. Long period of drinking this wine was beneficial to looks and beauty and was very welcomed among the noble ladies.The reason why no one dared to cause ruckus in Jinjiang Teahouse was because when she was just ten years old, she dared to put tiger skin and spread rumor that the one behind this teahouse was Duke Ding.Recalling this and the faces of her parents and older brother when she told them this, Jiang Ningbao could not help smiling and muttered.\u201cCould this be fate?\u201dActually, Jiang Ningbao was not fully lying.Her fiance was Xie Jingyi, Duke Ding Residence\u2019s heir and her backing was also Duke Ding Residence, while Duke Ding Residence was Duke Ding\u2019s. So her backing could be counted as Duke Ding, right?There were some people who did not believe this and mentioned this matter to Duke Ding. After he investigated, he stayed silent in confirmation.Now, the whole capital knew that the one behind Jinjiang Teahouse was Duke Ding so no one dared to play tricks to Jinjiang Teahouse.Jiang Ningbao curved her lips and gazed to the peach blossom tree outside with a beautiful smile.This might be hers and Duke Ding\u2019s fate. Six years later on that day, Heir Xie revoked the engagement and she declared that she wanted to marry Duke Ding. When she marry Duke Ding, it would make Duke Ding her legal backing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She wore a yellow trimmed white magnolia dress with two expensive jades dangling from her waist that created jingling sounds every time she moved, giving her the impression of moving gentle beauty.Seeing the soft and gentle beauty in the bronze mirror, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s lips curved into a meaningful smile as she blinked her pair of beautiful eyes.\u201cYang Shuqing, we\u2019re finally meeting.\u201dEven though Jiang Ningbao was Xie Jingyi\u2019s fiancee, but the two only met a few times and always on Old Madam Jiang\u2019s birthday party. The two never get to know each other so they had no feelings for each other.Especially the last three years after her parents \u2018passed away\u2019. On Old Madam Jiang\u2019s birthday, Xie Jingyi would only give the birthday gift in a hurry and left.Xie Jingyi should not know that after she grew up, she turned into a pity evoking, soft and gentle girl.\u201cChun Xi, bring my hat over.\u201dJiang Ningbao retracted her gaze and ordered in a soft voice.\u201cYes, please wait, lady.\u201dChun Xi went to the wardrobe and took out a black hat with white gauze.Jiang Ningbao stared at the hat and her eyes flashed with nostalgia. This was the hat that her mother, Madam Yang, gave her wen she was twelve years old. She remembered her mother saying that when a girl was going out, it\u2019s best to cover her face.Her mother, Madam Yang, was a gentle and warm elegant lady. She place great importance on her only daughter and from the teachings of Madam Yang, she washed away the crudeness she gained from the apocalypse and gained the air of a noble lady.Under Madam Yang\u2019s teaching, Jiang Ningbao was used to covering her face when going out.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dJiang Ningbao wore the hat and covered her delicate face as she took Chun Xi out.Chun Xi called a carriage to the front of the residence. Changning Count Residence\u2019s carriages all had owners. If Jiang Ningbao, a lady from the second branch, wanted to go out, she must report to the First Madam Zhang for approval before she could use the carriage.But Jiang Ningbao was too lazy to greet Madam Zhang who was all about calculation and bought a delicately made carriage from her dowry and entrusted it to Manager Yao. As long as she wanted to go out, Chun Xi would call the carriage.The driver was someone Manager Yao bought, a clean servant.It would prevent trouble that way.Old Madam Jiang knew this but since Jiang Ningbao did not spend a penny from the residence, she could not say anything. Madam Zhang did not even care about this, pretending not to see this.\u201cLady, are you really going to meet Oldest Miss Yang?\u201d Getting in the carriage, Chun Xi became unsettled and her face was filled with worry.Jiang Ningbao glanced at Chun Xi with mirth. She teased, \u201cChun Xi, Oldest Miss Yang is not a wild beast, what should we be afraid of?\u201dChun Xi almost cried. How could her lady be so calm?Although this Oldest Miss Yang was not a wild beast, she was scarier than that! She\u2019s also the miss\u2019 love rival!.sNote: Someone posed the question about JNB\u2019s memories. In the early chapters, the author made JNB transmigrated just in time for \u2018engagement annulment\u2019 scene, but then, the author made it that JNB already has the past life memories from birth.As the translator, my only job is to translate the chapters however the author wrote it.

When Duke Ding Residence formally revoke this engagement, see where she could cry to.That\u2019s right. Madam Zhang already knew that Jiang Ningbao went out to fulfill the invitation of Anyuan Marquis\u2019 Oldest Miss. Madam Zhang did not prevent this, even waiting to see Jiang Ningbao make a fool out of herself in the dark.Madam Zhang finally made an agreement with Heir Xie. After her niece\u2019s engagement was annulled, her Yao\u2019er would get engaged with Xie family\u2019s second branch\u2019s Xie Jinghui. The fifth rank official position would also fell on the Count and there were other generous compensation.Madam Zhang\u2019s mood was very good.Jinjiang TeahouseJiang Ningbao who wore a black hat and white veil got down the carriage. A breeze of wind coincidentally swept past, revealing a little of her beautiful and delicate features. After the manager of the teahouse saw her, his eyes flashed with surprise and thought why did the master suddenly came by. He respectfully welcomed her.\u201cManager, I have a reservation in the second floor\u2019s fourth room.\u201d Her clear and voice rang and separated with the veil, Jiang Ningbao blinked and pretended not to know him.Jinjiang Teahouse was built on the famous street on the capital and the building was big with clear surroundings and good atmosphere. There were already noble young masters conversing in small voices inside. There were plenty of people who were trying the delicacies in the store.Noble ladies and madams liked to reserve the rooms upstairs.Jiang Ningbao stepped into the teahouse and she did not attract anyone\u2019s attention. The politeness of the guests in the teahouse was high so they just glanced at her.\u201cSo it\u2019s Miss Yang\u2019s guest. This servant will take you there.\u201d The manager accompanied Jiang Ningbao acting like strangers and respectfully led the way.The second floor\u2019s fourth room was reserved by Yang Shuqing. The room was elegantly decorated and there were a few paintings hung on the wall. The frame on the corners of the room had colorful fresh flowers put in the vase on it.Yang Shuqing had long arrived in the room and was waiting for Jiang Ningbao with two servants by her side.The red peony skirt dress she wore was eye-catching and it emphasized her white skin, as if sheep-fat white jade.Jiang Ningbao saw this scene and clicked her tongue mentally. The female lead Yang Shuqing indeed fitted this bright red dress. It made her look noble and beautiful.The book revealed that in her past life, the female lead did not care about Anyuan Marquis\u2019 opposition and stubbornly wanted to get married to King Jin as noble concubine, cefei, and never worn bright red dress from then on.After rebirth, the female lead had strong obsession.This life, she would not be concubine, even if it was one from the royal family.So the female lead liked wearing red dress. No matter if it\u2019s bright red, dark red, or pink\u2026.. as long as it had red, she would like it, especially bright red.\u201cMiss Yang, hello.\u201d Jiang Ningbao greeted politely with soft voice pleasant to the ears. The people who heard it would had a good impression.Yang Shuqing was beautiful and her aura was strong. She had radiant atmosphere, as if a shining pearl. It was different from Jiang Ningbao.Yang Shuqing\u2019s looks were fit to be the legal wife in the eyes of the madams and Jiang Ningbao\u2019s white lotus soft and gentle looks were the type those madams dislike.Jiang Ningbao was also helpless. Looks were decided from birth. She were period of mourning for her parents for three years and had not attended any banquet, so outsiders did not know the looks of Duke Ding Residence\u2019s heir\u2019s fiancee.\u201cJiang fourth miss, please sit.\u201d Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes flashed and she smiled as she spoke. She glanced at the manager. \u201cManager, send a jug of plum blossom wine later.\u201dThe manager complied and carefully closed the door of the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang Ningbao lifted her hand and put her hat down, revealing her soft and delicate face. She led her servant Chun Xi to the seat. The jades on her waist collided, creating a clear sound that complement her goose yellow and white magnolia dress, appearing moving and pity evoking.Yang Shuqing saw Jiang Ningbao\u2019s face and she frowned subconsciously.This was Yang Shuqing\u2019s first time seeing Jiang Ningbao\u2019s real face. She never thought that Jiang Ningbao would appear soft and moving, evoking pity. Her heart felt disgust.No matter which lifetime, Yang Shuqing hated this kind of looks, as if just frowning would make men crowd to protect her.Seeing Jiang Ningbao, Yang Shuqing\u2019s guilt flew away. She even thought badly that Xie Jingyi only had Jiang Ningbao because of this kind of looks.Thinking like this, Yang Shuqing\u2019s heart became comfortable.How could Jiang Ningbao miss the disgust Yang Shuqing hid?The female lead hated white lotus the most so Jiang Ningbao had prepared herself. She did not care about this at all. Others\u2019 likes and dislikes were not related to her.She only needed to be herself.When Jiang Ningbao sat down, Yang Shuqing hid her emotions and acted magnanimous. She smoothly poured tea for her and showed an apologetic smile.\u201cJiang fourth miss, I invite you privately like this to apologize to you. I did not think that because of the accident on the Plum Blossom Banquet, Heir Xie would revoke the engagement.\u201d\u201cAlthough I\u2019m grateful to Heir Xie\u2019s rescue, I did not mean to steal your fiance.\u201dYang Shuqing gave her tea and smiled bitterly with sincere tone.Jiang Ningbao received the tea and glanced at the sunken tea leaves. Her heart was laughing. This female lead was really meaningful. Her words made her seemed innocent and everything was Xie Jingyi\u2019s fault and at the same time, showed off her attractiveness in a veiled way.If she was the book\u2019s Jiang Ningbao, hearing these words that kept mentioning Heir Xie would piss her off.May be this was the female lead\u2019s objective.Saying that she wanted to apologize when in fact, she wanted to stimulate Jiang Ningbao who had her engagement revoked. Under these circumstances, an ordinary girl would be stimulated to doing some excessive things.Jiang Ningbao speculated the cruel female lead\u2019s motives in the worst light. She gave a smile that did not reach her eyes to Yang Shuqing who pretended to be innocent and showed off in a roundabout way using a soft voice.\u201cThe matter of Heir Xie annulling the engagement has circulated all over the capital. My reputation was long gone. Miss Yang, don\u2019t you feel that this apology came way too late?\u201dFrom the book, she knew that after Yang Shuqing was reborn, she disguised as a male and befriended people who would be great figures. She had known Xie Jingyi from two years ago and their relationship was deep.May be it was because of the female lead halo, aside from the first second male lead, no one noticed this.\u201cJiang fourth miss, annulling the engagement is Heir Xie\u2019s decision. The miss is kind, feeling guilty, so she invite you here to apologize. The miss is innocent.\u201d\u201cMoreover, the miss did not deliberately give late apology. After the miss fell into the water, she got a cold and recuperated in the house. She did not know what Heir Xie did. After she knew, the rumor outside is already wild.\u201dQian Bi, being Yang Shuqing\u2019s trusted servant, acted as if she felt indignant and explained. At the same time, she pointed that Yang Shuqing was innocent in all this.\u201cQian Bi, shut your mouth!\u201dYang Shuqing\u2019s face sunk and glared at Qian Bi and faced Jiang Ningbao in embarrassment, saying, \u201cJiang fourth miss, don\u2019t listen to my servant. No matter what, your engagement is revoked because of me falling into the water, causing Heir Xie to do something like this. I invite Jiang fourth miss today because I want to compensate this mistake.\u201d\u201cI know that saying anything at this point is too late, but if I do nothing, my heart won\u2019t be at ease.\u201dYang Shuqing\u2019s words seemed sincere, but she felt strange from Jiang Ningbao\u2019s faint respond. If a noble lady had her engagement forcefully annulled, the respond shouldn\u2019t be like this.\u201cMiss, Heir Xie\u2019s decision is not related to you\u2026..\u201d Qian Bi jumped on spot and explained in anxiety.Yang Shuqing glared at her again and Qian Bi shut her mouth.Jiang Ningbao sipped her tea and calmly witness this scene. Her heart was calm. What \u2018no relation\u2019, being sick from falling into the water, it were all lies. Yang Shuqing had met Xie Jingyi in private a few times yet Yang Shuqing still wanted to act in front of her and tried to make her angry. It was really funny.\u201cMiss Yang, based on Heir Xie\u2019s moral quality, I do not believe that he canceled the engagement just because you fell into the water. I only wanted to ask Miss Yang. Had you known Heir Xie before?\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s tone was soft and gentle.This question almost did not ask Yang Shuqing \u2018how long had you been intimate with Heir Xie?\u2019.Yang Shuqing was stunned. Her heart felt guilty from being stared at with Jiang Ningbao\u2019s pair of beautiful eyes, but she did not admit. She shook her head in denial, \u201cBefore the Plum Blossom Banquet, I\u2019ve never known Heir Xie.\u201dShe always met Heir Xie in man disguise.No one would notice.Yang Shuqing who was confident felt bighearted.\u201cThen it must be that Heir Xie fell in love at first sight with Miss Yang. I really did not expect that my fiance is that kind of person.\u201d Jiang Ningbao smiled and her words carried hidden needles, implying that Yang Shuqing was a femme fatale.Yang Shuqing\u2019s heart trembled. She not realized that this soft and gentle Jiang fourth miss was not simple.She actually made a mistake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Qian Rong opened the door and saw the manager holding a tar of jug bottle with a smiling face.\u201cThis is the Plum Blossom Wine Miss Yang ordered.\u201dIt\u2019s the manager bringing the ordered wine over. After the manager gave the wine to Qian Rong, she closed the door.Yang Shuqing received the wine jug and poured two cups of it. She gave one to Jiang Ningbao and sipped the wine.\u201cJiang fourth miss, this Plum Blossom Wine is Jinjiang Teahouse\u2019s most welcomed flower wine. Each day, each person is limited to a jug.\u201dJiang Ningbao smiled and sipped it lightly. She praised, \u201cThis flower wine is indeed delicious just as the rumors said.\u201dPraising and selling herself, she did it without shame.Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes flashed with satisfaction.The one backing Jinjiang Teahouse was Duke Ding Residence. After she married into Duke Ding Residence, she might know the real master behind this Teahouse and the one who brew the wine.Jiang Ningbao saw the female lead like this and she could guess what the female lead was thinking and laughed silently in her heart.For a moment, the two slowly savored the Plum Blossom Wine and the atmosphere was nice.Then Yang Shuqing spoke.\u201cI can understand Jiang fourth miss feels resentment but innocence will prove itself. I will not do unnecessary explanation since no matter how much I say, Jiang fourth miss won\u2019t believe.\u201dJiang Ningbao nodded, \u201cIndeed, I will not believe.\u201dWhat innocence will prove itself. She had tangled with Xie Jingyi for a long time and still acted as if she was innocent, Jiang Ningbao felt fed up.Yang Shuqing was stunned, she did not expect that Jiang Ningbao would directly nod her head. This Jiang fourth miss was really hard to deal with. She took a deep breath and poured Jiang Ningbao another cup of flower wine and sighed, \u201cIf it were me, I will not believe it too, but these are words from the bottom of my heart.\u201dJiang Ningbao shook the cup with the flower wine and she enjoyed the service given by the female lead. She suddenly gave Yang Shuqing a soft and gentle smile, \u201cMiss Yang, do you remember you just told me you want to compensate me?\u201dYang Shuqing\u2019s heart thumped but her face was smiling as she nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMiss Yang, if you really want to compensate me, why don\u2019t you put out the words that you don\u2019t have any intention to steal my fiance and will not marry into Duke Ding Residence. How about it?\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s pair of beautiful eyes stared at Yang Shuqing, waiting for her reaction.This pit was dug well.

Who knew that this female lead was a cruel and merciless one whose real motive was to scheme against her and stimulate her.No digging a trap for the female lead would be unfair to her carefully calculated plans.Once these words left her mouth, Yang Shuqing\u2019s two servants were no longer calm and glared at Jiang Ningbao with anger. This Jiang fourth miss was really too much. The miss already apologized and even poured her wine, how could she\u2026..made such a request?No one was clearer than them that the miss and Heir Xie had mutual feelings.If the miss was really forced to accept Jiang fourth miss\u2019 request, then won\u2019t the things the did before meaningless? And losing pure reputation too.Jiang fourth miss was forcing others into difficult spot. Really too much!Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes flashed with surprise. She did not think that Jiang Ningbao would be this cruel. It seemed that the things she did before were useless. This Jiang fourth miss could not be reasoned with.If she agreed to Jiang Ningbao\u2019s request and put out those words, then she and Heir Xie won\u2019t have a future. If she married into Duke Ding after, others would think that it was a ridiculous joke.Living once more, Yang Shuqing won\u2019t cause herself any grief.If she did not agree, then whatever she said before was hitting her face.What a good drastic measure to deal with an emergency.What pitiful and soft and timid, they were all fake. Jiang fourth miss was more scheming than she thought and smarter too. It seemed that her plan before was seen by Jiang fourt miss.Yang Shuqing smiled bitterly. After rebirth, the road was too smooth that she forgot that there were others greater than her. A person that she did not put in her eye actually put her in a difficult spot.May be in the past life, the reason why Jiang fourth miss could had the undivided pampering of Heir Xie was not only because she had a pity evoking appearance, but it was more because of her bright and limpid heart, also her bright and intelligent mind.\u201cMiss Yang, is there any difficulty in doing this? Or is it that Miss Yang liked my fiance from long before and the words of not wanting to steal my fiance are all fake?\u201dJiang Ningbao lightly swept the hair beside her ear and smiled as she looked at Yang Shuqing, as if reading her heart.Yang Shuqing had never been put in such difficulty before. She glanced at Jiang Ningbao\u2019s beautiful smiling face and felt that it was sore to her eyes. She no longer had any thoughts of peaceful coexistence with Jiang Ningbao.\u201cJiang fourth miss, forgive for not being able to fulfill your request. Heir Xie is dragon among men. The noble ladies who like him are countless, I am not an exception.\u201d\u201cHeir Xie ruined my purity and willing to take responsibility, who will I marry if not him? Aside him, I have no other choices. Jiang fourth miss, please don\u2019t put me in a difficult spot.\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s like that, then there is no need for Miss Yang to pretend to be innocent?\u201d Jiang Ningbao smiled and did not seem angry. She only spoke faintly.\u201cHeir Xie rescuing Miss Yang and ruining Miss Yang\u2019s purity. Then I, this innocent fiancee had to revoke the engagement and give way to Miss Yang? It is not like you people don\u2019t know that revoking the engagement is fatal to a girl. There are solutions aside from engagement annulment. I am willing to be sisters with Miss Yang, but Miss Yang does not think this way, am I right?\u201dYang Shuqing\u2019s face sunk. This Jiang fourth miss was not simple. Every words were piercing right into her heart\u2019s true thoughts.That\u2019s right. She was not willing to be under others. After she was reborn, she swore that she won\u2019t be a concubine int this life and was not willing to share her husband. After Heir Xie said that he would take responsibility, she said these to Heir Xie.So he could only annul the engagement.Jiang Ningbao smiled faintly. Yang Shuqing\u2019s apology had bad intentions from the start. She would never be sister with this female lead. Since she accepted the invitation today, she had been prepared to throw away all pleasantries.The two people who had no way of coexisting peacefully, was there any need to pretend otherwise?\u201cIf you don\u2019t wish anyone to know what you\u2019ve done, it\u2019s better not to have done it in the first place. Does Miss Yang still remember the old plum blossom tree in the capital\u2019s west part\u2019s alley two years ago? It seemed to be able to match-make people. Is this true?\u201dJiang Ningbao revealed a smile.

She looked at the smiling gentle girl in front of her in disbelief.It turned out that Jiang fourth miss knew everything. She felt that she was an buffoon jumping around in front of her with no escape.The old tree Jiang fourth miss said located in Western Capital\u2019s alley was the place she met Heir Xie while disguised as a man two years ago.The day before yesterday, she met privately with Heir Xie and even mentioned that same old tree.Remembering that she said that before the Plum Blossom Banquet, she did not know Heir Xie, Yang Shuqing\u2019s face was red and hot with embarrassment, wanting to jump in a hole.Now, her face was gone.Yang Shuqing\u2019s mental was good and she recovered a moment later. She glared at Jiang Ningbao and left in a hurry with her servants. Seeing her back, it was as if she was fleeing.This meeting, Yang Shuqing and Jiang Ningbao part on bad terms.Yang Shuqing left but Jiang Ningbao did not. She leisurely tasted the scarce Plum Blossom Wine alone in the room leisurely. Her brows indicated her happiness.\u201cLady, are you throwing away all pleasantries with Miss Yang?\u201d Chun Xi was in a trance as she asked. Why could she not understand what the miss was talking about? What old plum tree? It seemed that there was a big secret inside.Jiang Ningbao raised her eyebrow, \u201cDidn\u2019t you see it too?\u201dChun Xi\u2019s face was full of struggle. These past few days, her lady was composed, she thought that her lady did not mind it. Never would she thought that her lady was holding it in all these time. Her lady was too pitiful!Then, Jinjiang Teahouse\u2019s manager came inside bringing a good news for Jiang Ningbao.\u201cMaster, Old Madam Xie had went back to the residence. Our men found out that she seemed happy.\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes flashed and she had a guess on the reason why. Now, she was no longer in the mood to relax in the teahouse. She carried Chun Xi back home in a hurry.When her carriage left Jinjiang Teahouse, Yang Shuqing\u2019s carriage went out from another alley. Hearing to the news she just got, Yang Shuqing\u2019s face revealed a smile.Duke Ding Residence, Thriving Joy HallOld Madam Xie did not think that going to the monastery to find Monk Gao would bring her such a pleasant surprise. Jiang fourth miss and her son\u2019s eight characters were a perfect match!\u201cIf I had known that Jiang fourth miss suits my son much earlier, it would be great.\u201d Old Madam Xie sipped her tea and could not help felt a bit greedy.\u201cOld madam, it\u2019s not too late now.\u201d Old servant Huang smiled.Old Madam Xie also smiled.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not too late. Wait after the heir annulled this engagement, I will send people to propose.\u201d\u201cOld madam, have you asked the duke\u2019s opinion?\u201d Old servant Huang was stunned. She did not think that the old madam would be this anxious to take in Jiang fourth miss.Old Madam Xie\u2019s mind was filled with her son\u2019s cold and handsome face. She shook her head and sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s useless asking him.

Once she knew that Jiang fourth miss\u2019 eight characters were compatible with her son\u2019s, she was so happy that she forgot her son\u2019s special constitution. She frowned.\u201cThat\u2019s right. How could I forget?\u201d\u201cOld madam, why don\u2019t you find the right time to let the duke and Jiang fourth miss to meet in private and see the outcome. Or you can invite Jiang fourth miss to the monastery and let Monk Gao see her?\u201dOld servant Huang suggested.Old Madam Xie heard this and felt that old servant Huang was reasonable, so she nodded. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it that way. I heard Butler Zhao said that the heir and Changning Count Residence had agreed on the compensation and will officially cancel the engagement tomorrow.

There were thick black clouds hovering across the sky of the capital, as of brewing a storm.Butler Zhao had prepared to visit Changning Count Residence once more, carrying a huge carriage of compensation. He passed the market and gained the attention of a lot of passerby.\u201cSeeing this setup, does Heir Xie wants to propose marriage or annulling the engagement officially? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cIt should be canceling the engagement. Did you not see that only Butler Zhao is there?\u201d\u201cBefore, I admire Heir Xie very much, thinking that Heir Xie is really the role-model in our generation, but now, I felt that I was blind. No matter what, a man should not harm his innocent fiancee for another woman.\u201d\u201cI thought that with the rumors going wild, Heir Xie would find his conscience and not annul the engagement. It seems that I think too much. Jiang fourth miss is so pitiful.\u201d\u201cBetween a fiancee who is not famous and the Oldest Miss Yang who is known for her beauty and talent, both about responsibility, Heir Xie choose Oldest Miss Yang. As a man, I can understand Heir Xie\u2019s choice.\u201dIt was not known whether it was Xie Jingyi and Yang Shuqing doing something to prove their \u2018innocence\u2019 silently or may be it was because of Yang Shuqing\u2019s female lead halo, there was no rumor about Heir Xie and Oldest Miss Yang trapped schemed Jiang fourth miss.\u201cActually, Heir Xie can take them both in, no need to harm Jiang fourth miss\u2019 reputation. She is innocent.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? Is there no one who thinks that Jiang fourth miss is ugly while Oldest Miss Yang is attractive, so Heir Xie cast Jiang fourth miss aside and choose Oldest Miss Yang?\u201d\u201cHeir Xie is not someone like that.\u201d\u201cSay, if Jiang fourth miss is really as ugly as the rumor says, then she cannot become the Duke Ding Residence\u2019s heiress. It was better to become Duke Ding Residence\u2019s oldest miss. When she marry later, no one would dare to offend her.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. I also think this way.\u201dThe conversation was led on purpose and started to talk about how Jiang fourth miss was very ugly. Jiang Ningbao was too secretive.

The atmosphere in the room was nervous and dignified.Old Madam Jiang sat on the main hall with her hair neatly combed. Her coloring seemed good, especially her pair of sharp deep eyes.Coincidentally, Changning Count was not working today. He and First Madam Zhang sat near Old Madam Jiang. There were also other children and madams from side branches who used the excuse of greeting the old madam to look at the show.The only weird thing was, there was no Jiang Mingyao.Jiang Ningbao mull it over. This matter that was disgraceful for Changning Count Residence, aside from her who was at the center of the matter, it was indeed not good for other ladies and young masters to appear here.The madams from the side branches who rarely saw Jiang Ningbao stealthily sneaked a peek at her who was sitting next to Madam Zhang calmly. They discussed in a small voice.\u201cSo the second branch\u2019s fourth miss is actually this pretty.\u201d\u201cWhat pretty? Weak and soft like that, it\u2019s not good. No wonder Heir Xie wants to annul this engagement. The fourth miss did not look like a madam, but a concubine.\u201d\u201cIndeed not good. Seeing her face makes me think of those temptress back in the harem. I can finally understand Heir Xie\u2019s choice. This kind of woman being the madam, it\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as you say. Looks are decided from birth. Don\u2019t you see that her eyes are clear? May be she is not like you think.\u201d\u201cChi! Only you will be the good person.\u201dThese discussions entered Jiang Ningbao\u2019s ears and she patted her Sapphire bracelet carved with auspicious clouds. Her eyes seemed as if flittering light passed by.Her weak and soft looks really made other women envious.Between 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. past forty five minutes, there was an old servant hurrying in to report.\u201cOld madam, Duke Ding Residence\u2019s Butler Zhao has arrived.\u201dOld Madam Jiang waved her hand and her eyes were bright and shiny, \u201cLet them in.\u201dChangning Count and Madam Zhang sat straight unconsciously.The side branches madams shut their mouths and they had a gaze that were seeking to see a good show. Their gazes went to Jiang Ningbao here and then, seeing her with pity and gloated on her misfortune.Jiang Ningbao took in the expressions of the people in the hall, especially the few side branches madams. Her mouth curved and she laughed voicelessly.Butler Zhao led a bunch of guards who carried boxes of compensation gifts and greeted Old Madam Jiang and Changning Count.\u201cThis Zhao greets old madam, the count, and the madams.\u201d\u201cToday, this Zhao believes that every one here know the purpose of this visit, that is representing sir heir to give back the engagement cards and officially annul the engagement. Aside from the two compensations mentioned before, sir heir also gave other compensations.\u201dButler Zhao was the same as before, cutting into the point once he arrived. After he was done talking, he gestured to the guard and the guards opened the boxes.High quality silks and satin, shining gold and silver pearls and jewelry, precious paintings, and there were two big boxes of gold, all presented to the people in the hall.The hall was filled with the shine of the treasures, almost blinding people.The side branches madams wrung their handkerchiefs and stared at those boxes with short and heave breaths. Their eyes were almost green.First Madam Zhang\u2019s heart was beating fast, almost jumping in excitement.Hers! These were all hers!Madam Zhang screamed in her heart.Changning Count seemed composed, but his eyes were widened and the hand gripping the cup gave away his excitement. His heart was blooming.Only Old Madam Jiang was dissatisfied.These much material compensation, in Old Madam Jiang\u2019s eyes, were lacking not just by a bit, but she could not speak out, lest she got an image of a greedy person who sold her granddaughter.Hence, Old Madam Jiang could only stay silent and glared at her son and daughter-in-law, along with those side branches madam. She scolded them in her heart, good-for-nothings!Butler Zhao carried a smile as he took in the reactions of the people in Changning Count Residence. He especially took notice of Jiang fourth miss. Her eyes were clear and pure, the pair of beautiful eyes were not moved in the slightest.He nodded in approval in his heart. This Jiang fourth miss did not let him down.\u201cButler Zhao, are these the compensations given to me?\u201d Jiang Ningbao lifted her lips and her soft voice rang like a thunder in the silence, snapping the people back to reality.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What compensation? No way. After the engagement was officially annulled, she would send people to move it to her treasury.Butler Zhao smiled and nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right. These are the compensation for Jiang fourth miss.\u201dOld Madam Jiang glanced at Madam Zhang\u2019s face that showed her indignant feeling. This Madam Zhang really seek death with her short sight. She glared at the bunch of people who were intoxicated by the sight of the treasure and sternly yelled.\u201cI will put the bad words first, these are all the compensation Duke Ding Residence gave to fourth girl. Don\u2019t you dare think of stealing it or you will be dealt with house rules, do you hear me?\u201dMadam Zhang was stunned and she clenched the handkerchief in her hands. Her eyes were filled with disbelief and unresigned feelings. What did the old madam meant by this?Changning Count\u2019s face turned dark and sunken, then he recovered. He silently resented his mother for wanting face. She was just a niece who lost her parents, why should they be courteous to her?In his heart, these compensation was already his.Once the side branch madams heard the old madam\u2019s words, they suppressed the greed and envy in their hearts and calmed down. No matter how many compensation Duke Ding Residence gave, it would never be theirs.If these really fell into fourth lady\u2019s hands, then they could try to get it. They heard that the fourth lady had her mother\u2019s dowry. They remembered that year, when the second mistress marry into Changning Count Residence, her dowry was plenty.The more they thought, they more their hearts shook.The fourth miss was already sixteen and after the engagement was annulled, they must find another engagement quick or it would be difficult later on. They could ask their families if there was someone with suitable age.The few side branch madams all thought of the same scheme.Taking in the reactions of those people, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s smile disappeared and she bowed to the old madam with a face full of gratitude, \u201cThanking grandmother.\u201dOld Madam Jiang looked at Jiang Ningbao with fondness and her eyes flashed with complicated feelings as she sighed, \u201cThese should be yours. Just don\u2019t blame grandmother for canceling the engagement.\u201dJiang Ningbao smiled coldly in her heart. It was obviously them who wanted the compensation Heir Xie gave and wanted to annul this engagement as soon as possible, harming her reputation, and they pretended that it was all for her good. Old madam was really pretentious, but she only smiled, \u201cGrandmother is doing this for granddaughter, how can granddaughter blame grandmother?\u201d\u201cWhat a good child.\u201d Old Madam Jiang nodded in satisfaction.Butler Zhao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dWhy did he feel that Jiang fourth miss\u2019 smile was weird?\u201cButler Zhao, this matter has developed into this step. I\u2019ve said it before, I will not force anything. This is the horoscope card for engagement of me and sir heir.\u201dJiang Ningbao glanced at Butler Zhao and smiled as she took out the horoscope card that was legalized in the government office from her sleeve and gave it to Butler Zhao.There were three copies of the engagement card.Two for each sides and one for the government office.Only when the person whose engagement was annulled go to the government office to revoke it, the engagement could be officially annulled.Old Madam Jiang and First Madam Zhang did not dare to force Jiang Ningbao because of this reason. The engagement card and her fiance\u2019s horoscope card was also in her hands.\u201cJiang fourth miss, when will you go to the government office?\u201d Butler Zhao admired Jiang fourth miss\u2019 efficient way of doing things.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s fair and long finger swept through the engagement card and there was no lingering feelings in her eyes. She calmly looked at Butler Zhao and spoke.\u201cButler Zhao, before giving back the engagement card and the horoscope card, I have two thing that I want to ask.\u201d Jiang Ningbao\u2019s pace was slow and her voice was soft and gentle, making people feel favorable toward her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The people there could felt their hearts beating.They were all curious what Jiang Ningbao would ask.Old Madam Jiang, Changning Count, and Madam Zhang all turned their gazes on Jiang Ningbao. They all frowned, worrying that she would use a trick.Seeing Jiang Ningbao being not slow and not fast, not angry nor ashamed, the side branch madams\u2019 eyes flashed. Perhaps they would be wrong and this fourth miss was eccentric.Butler Zhao\u2019s eyes had interest in them and said, \u201cJiang fourth miss, please ask.\u201d\u201cThe first thing is, I want to ask who will get Duke Ding Residence\u2019s compensation of fifth rank official position?\u201d Jiang Ningbao curved her lips and asked in a soft voice.Once the words were spoke, Old Madam Jiang and Changning Count\u2019s expression slightly sunk.Butler Zhao looked at Jiang fourth miss in surprise and answered truthfully, \u201cIt will fall to the count.\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s brows were slightly knitted and her face unconsciously showed delicateness, making people unbearable to upset her. She pretended to be confused.\u201cI remember that this fifth rank official position is compensation for the engagement annulment, right?\u201d\u201cSo shouldn\u2019t this fifth rank official position fall to the hands of my biological brother, Jiang Jin? My older brother is already eighteen and he had passed the scholar examination and in preparation for the provincial examination.\u201d\u201cBased on what?\u201dMadam Zhang\u2019s heart was in panic and she was afraid that Butler Zhao would change his mind. She glared at Jiang Ningbao and blurted out.The eyes of Old Madam Jiang who was composed turned cold and glared at Madam Zhang who jumped out in impatience with unhappiness.What an idiot.Where was the calculation she had usually?The eyes of Changning Count, Jiang Dongming, flashed with unhappiness and his heart was dissatisfied. In his eyes, this niece was ignorant. She was not even aware of Dayue Dynasty\u2019s rules and made a fool of herself.\u201cFourth girl, according to Dayue Rules, official positions can be upgraded. My official position is sixth rank now and the upgrade would be fifth rank position. So no descendants of the noble family is allowed a rank higher than sixth rank.\u201dAfter Changning Count said this, Madam Zhang realized what an idiotic act she did and she saw the ridicule from the eyes of the side branch madams and the old madam\u2019s cold gaze. Her face changed whiter.Jiang Ningbao was stunned.No wonder her older brother\u2019s letter did not mention the official rank. So older brother already knew that this position won\u2019t fall on him.But the events in the book was not like this. The fifth rank official fell to Madam Zhang\u2019s second son and also her second cousin, Jiang Yue. How could it be her oldest uncle now?Jiang Ningbao could not help but recall the memories of that transmigrator and reviewed the content of the book. It seemed that she was careless and confused the timeline.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang fourth miss, this position compensation can only fall on the count.\u201d Butler Zhao nodded solemnly.When sir heir asked for this fifth rank position as compensation from the old madame, it was actually for the count.Jiang Ningbao realized this and nodded, revealing a bitter smile. She explained in embarrassment, \u201cSo it\u2019s like this. It is me who is ignorant. I only want older brother to establish the second branch since mother and father aren\u2019t here.\u201dThree years ago, her older brother Jiang Jin was just fifteen years old. He did not have any engagement yet when their parents were gone. The two of them needed to mourn in filial piety for three years and this year, he had just got out of the mourning period.Her older brother studied at home for three years and on the spring this year, he went to Azure Mountain Academy.Who knew that a few days ago, Jiang Ningbao found out that she transmigrated into a book and her parents were actually alive somewhere.This was such a joke.Fine, not everything could go the way she wanted.It seemed that her agreeing to annul the engagement before time made some butterfly effects to the content of the book. Onward, she could only use it as a reference.Eating a bit of loss was eating a bit of loss. Later, her parents would still come back and her older brother was only a scholar now. He haven\u2019t passed the test and gain official rank. Her maternal family was too far from the capital and too far off to help. She still could not break it off with Changning Count Residence.So as to avoid the first branch using some underhanded means and affect her older brother\u2019s provincial examination this year.Jiang Ningbao silently calculated the loss and gains in her heart.\u201cJiang fourth miss and Jiang third young master really cares about each other, very admiring.\u201dButler Zhao smiled in understanding. Jiang second branch only had Jiang fourth miss and Jiang third young master. Seeing the acts of Jiang first branch\u2019s couple, they were not dependable. She could only rely on Jiang third young master.Changning Count\u2019s face turned better. So this niece actually wanted Jin boy to establish the second branch sooner which caused her to became anxious. The dissatisfaction in his heart decreased.\u201cRead more of Dayue Rules later on, lest you make a fool of yourself.\u201dJiang Ningbao nodded in a manner that she had learnt, \u201cYes, thanking oldest uncle\u2019s pointer.\u201d She indeed had to do research on Dayue rules. Even if not all could be used, she still needed to understand them.Maybe it was because she had been in a lawless apocalyptic world for too long that she had forgotten the rules and law of the peaceful period. She passed these past few years easy and comfortable.\u201cFourth girl, the count residence is your backing and never think stray thoughts. Only if the clan is well can you enjoy the protection of the clan.\u201dOld Madam Jiang stared deeply at this seemingly obedient granddaughter and could not help warned her. It seemed that Heir Xie\u2019s engagement annulment gave her a very big blow that caused her personality to change.If she did something that would ruin the reputation of the count residence\u2026.. Old Madam Jiang had to take precautions.\u201cGrandmother is right, granddaughter has learned.\u201dJiang Ningbao replied respectfully.Her heart was laughing coldly. The protection of the clan\u2026.. old madam dislike her, this granddaughter; oldest aunt Madam Zhang was snobbish. Not sucking dry the benefits from her and her older brother was already holding back.The past three years, she had lived smooth and comfortable, only because she was the fiancee of Duke Ding Residence\u2019s heir and would marry into Duke Ding Residence.But there was an accident during Plum Blossom Banquet and Heir Xie annulled the engagement.Old madam and first Madam Zhang changed their faces and decreased her meals day by day. Whatever clan protection words were just a joke.\u201cJiang fourth miss, what is the second matter you wanted to ask?\u201d Butler Zhao saw that it was getting late so he asked.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s exquisite face revealed a smile that was like the flowers blossoming on spring, bewitching people. She asked with a trace of anticipation.\u201cButler Zhao, I\u2019ve said it before that I am not willing to be the heir\u2019s little sister and will not swallow down this matter down.

She did not even need to think to know that once Butler Zhao exited the count residence, the capital will be filled with another gossip.Changning Count who did not manage the affairs of the backyard, for the first time, knew that his niece actually had this kind of idea. His face changed and he roared, \u201cMaking trouble!

She looked at him calmly and composed as she lifted her exquisite face and spoke without any compromise.\u201cOldest uncle, forgive this niece for not being filial!\u201dButler Zhao did not think that Jiang fourth miss would ask this matter this fast. It was fortunate that the old madam was very satisfied with Jiang fourth miss.

Her tone was light and feathery as she spoke.\u201cI\u2019ve asked what I want to ask. Butler Zhao, let us go to the government office and quickly annul the engagement, lest it troubles the Heir Xie.\u201dThis time, no one stopped her. Changning Count held back a breath. He thought of something and he eyes were dark and murky.Old Madam Jiang looked at Jiang Ningbao with a complicated gaze. Madam Zhang did not care whether or not Jiang Ningbao had left the hall. Her pair of eyes were glued to the few big boxes and there were excitement in her eyes.\u201d\u201cGrandmother, should we put away the compensation from Duke Ding Residence?\u201dOld Madam Jiang glanced at the side branch madams and silently cursed Madam Zhang as an idiot in her heart.\u201cHong Xing, call someone to clean it up.

Why is she wearing a hat? Could it be that she\u2019s ugly as the rumor said?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible. No wonder Heir Xie wanted to cancel this engagement.\u201d\u201cWhy is Butler Zhao going to the government office?\u201d\u201cSee the situation. They must be going to the government office to annul the engagement. Since they place much importance to this engagement, there must be something going on back then.\u201d\u201cYou think too much.

When they saw Jiang Ningbao\u2019s face, their eyes bulged out full of stunned and pitiful feelings. Not few people felt that they were evil, especially those who said that Jiang fourth miss was ugly beyond compare. Their faces flushed immediately and felt ashamed.Who said that she was ugly beyond compare?Jiang Ningbao did not think that her face would be revealed to the crows and glanced at their reactions. Her brows knitted and her pair of beautiful eyes glared at the culprit.Someone rode a horse with a purple bow in his hand. The male who wore silken clothes gave her a smug smile.The youth was around twenty with red lips, white teeth, and handsome features. The accessories on his body all indicated that he was from a noble family.Jiang Ningbao glared at him and averted her gaze to Chun Xi who was rising from the ground and the crowd that were there to see a good show. Her brows knitted, \u201cChun Xi, let us ride the carriage.\u201d She turned to where the carriage was.The two guards were afraid that there would be another incident and they hurried to Jiang Ningbao\u2019s side.When tender and delicate women were angry, it would give others a feeling grumbling in a flirty manner. Not only would it evoke men\u2019s pity, it would also stimulate their lust for conquest.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s face was the the tender in tender.That was why Jiang Ningbao rarely got angry. Even if was almost being attacked in broad daylight under the witness of many people, she would only bury it in her heart and would not chase this matter any further.But, things were different than she hoped. Jiang Ningbao did not provoke the other, but the other wanted to provoke her.\u201cJiang fourth miss, wait!\u201d the youth\u2019s clear voice and his guards surrounded Jiang Ningbao\u2019s carriage.The voice of the youth attracted the attention of the audience.There was someone who recognized this youth and said in surprise, \u201cThat\u2019s the little king from King Rui Residence!\u201dChun Xi\u2019s face went white and her face was filled with worry. She asked anxiously, \u201cOh my! That\u2019s actually the little king from King Rui Residence! Lady, what do we do?\u201dThe reputation of the little king from King Rui Residence was spread wide.Jiang Ningbao also heard this voice. It\u2019s actually King Rui Residence\u2019s little king, Xiao Ran. She furrowed her brows. There was no one who did not know this person.This little king Xiao Ran\u2019s biggest hobby was to collect various kinds of beauty.It was rumored that his harem already had one hundred and seven beauties.\u201cWe\u2019ll cross the bridge when we get to it.\u201dJiang Ningbao felt unlucky. She did not think that going to the government office could let her meet this kind of person who loved to collect beauties. This luck was really.She remembered in the book, this little king and the female lead had numerous encounters and then he liked the female lead, becoming the book\u2019s second male support character, changing the style of collecting beauties to collecting people who looked similar to the female lead.\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor that Jiang fourth miss is incomparably ugly. Seeing the miss today, it is false. Jiang fourth miss is a rare beauty, having different style with Oldest Miss Yang.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor that Jiang fourth miss is incomparably ugly.

Jiang fourth miss is a rare beauty, having different style with Oldest Miss Yang.\u201d\u201cMay I know if Jiang fourth miss is unwilling to become this heir\u2019s one hundred and eight concubine?\u201dOnce the little king opened his mouth, it was these kind of words. This was his trademark sentence that every one in the capital knew about.One hundred and eight concubine\u2026\u2026Jiang Ningbao\u2019s face blackened and she took a deep breath. Her voice carried anger, \u201cLittle king, please mind your words.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If she gave herself a fake identity, without the backing of Changning Count Residence, this little king would immediately kidnap her.The people who still held suspicion were in an uproar.So this tender and delicate beauty was the rumored ugly beyond compare Jiang fourth miss!\u201cJiang fourth miss, this heir is full of sincerity. It you are willing, this heir will send someone to propose tomorrow.\u201d Little king Xiao Ran smiled as he spoke on his own.The more he see, the more he felt that this strong and resilient Jiang fourth miss who had tender and delicate appearance was more appetizing than Oldest Miss Yang who was radiant and charming.A pity that her family background was not enough and she had her engagement canceled by Xie Jingyi, her reputation harmed. If not, he would marry her as his heiress.The little king who thoroughly loved female beauty sighed in pity.Once the audience heard the little king\u2019s words, they were stunned and their eyes were wide open. They felt sympathy toward this Jiang fourth miss who was surrounded by people, for her to be favored by this big \u2018buddha\u2019.Really, really unfortunate.In a secret corner in the government office, without anyone noticing, a man wearing silk clothes with talk, handsome, and noble disposition came. There was a male servant by this youth\u2019s side.\u201cHeir, it\u2019s King Rui Residence\u2019s little king and Jiang fourth miss.\u201dThe pretty man walked silk stared at the delicate beauty surrounded by people.After not seeing for three years, she was even more beautiful and mesmerizing, carrying a hidden presence that solely belonged to her, bursting into bloom her radiance.When his gaze averted to little king Xiao Ran, the pretty male could not help but frown and his gaze sunk.Jiang Ningbao who was protected by two guards had calmed down. Wanting to leave, if she was not careful, her reputation may shatter. It seemed that she could only use unconventional gambit. With a plan in her heart, Jiang Ningbao pursed her lips. She deliberately patted the pearl head ornaments on her head, she laughed lightly.\u201cLittle king, do you know why I agree to annul the engagement this simply and straight-forwardly?\u201dA lot of beauty were beautiful only in skin, but their presence were lacking. This Jiang fourth miss was beautiful to the bones and her aura was special, giving others a conflicting feeling. Every frown and every smile could not hide the elegance and intellectual brilliance.The crowd was once again looked at her in stunned feelings.Actually, this was also Jiang Ningbao not covering her radiance.Her looks were pitiful and delicate, but her action and aura did not change. Suddenly having her face revealed in this kind of place, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s objective was still getting married to Duke Ding.Since she could not hide it, then she would improvise.Little king Xiao Ran\u2019s eyes flashed with a feeling of being stunned from her beauty. Hearing her words, he immediately got interested. He asked in vigorous interest, \u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t it because that guy Xie Jingyi give you a lot of compensation?\u201dThe crowd heard the little king\u2019s straight-forward words and they all straightened their ears, wanting to hear Jiang fourth miss\u2019 answer.The man wearing silk robes and the corner had long taken in Jiang Ningbao\u2019s change in aura. He suddenly felt that he had never known this ex-fiancee.Especially after not meeting for three years. He did not know of her uniqueness.Hearing her saying the matter of engagement, the pretty man in silk robes subconsciously held his breath and rubbed the ring on his finger.The male servant at the side was this and was stunned.Could it be that the heir still had lingering attachment to Jiang fourth miss?Then what about Miss Yang?Jiang Ningbao\u2019s mouth curved and she flicked her hair. Her words surprised the crowd, \u201cBecause I feel that being my ex-fiance\u2019s mom is better, isn\u2019t it?\u201dChun Xi was shocked, \u201c\u2026..\u201dLady.. How could the lady say such words at a crowd like this?The audience was shocked beyond measure.They did not hear it wrong, right? Jiang fourth miss actually said that she wanted to become Heir Xie\u2019s mom? Then\u2026.. Then wouldn\u2019t it be marrying to Duke Ding?OMG! What a big piece of rumor material!The crowd was excited.In Dayue, who did not know of Duke Ding? Although he had big influence and power and famous reputation, but he was the poisonous husband in the eyes of females and the person all female avoided.This Jiang fourth miss was really courageous.The male in the corner stiffened and a trace of complicated and stupefied feelings flash through the bottom of his eyes. He did not think that after engagement annulment, his ex-fiancee would had this kind of idea.The trusted male servant did not dare to look at sir heir. He never thought that Jiang fourth miss actually\u2026.. actually wanted to be sir heir\u2019s mom!Could it be after getting her engagement annulled, she was dealt with too big of a blow and gave up on herself?But\u2026..this was good.Little king Xiao Ran\u2019s pair of plum blossom eyes widened and he was obviously shocked. He looked at Jiang Ningbao in disbelief.\u201cJiang fourth miss, you\u2026..you are not joking?\u201dJiang Ningbao took back her smile and her gaze was serious.\u201cLittle king, I\u2019m not joking. Everybody know that between me, this fiancee, and Oldest Miss Yang, he chose Oldest Miss Yang, meaning that we are destined to meet but not fated to be together.\u201d\u201cMoreover, me and Heir Xie only met a few times and the last three years, I\u2019ve never met Heir Xie, so there is no deep feeling. Heir Xie is dragon among men, Miss Yang is talented, the two of them suit each other.\u201dThe pretty male in the corner was silent.\u201cJiang fourth miss is indeed understanding and reasonable, but is there any relation between this and you being Xie Jingyi\u2019s mom? Could it be that you want to get married to Duke Ding and let Xie Jingyi pay respects to you every day and call you mom?\u201dLittle king Xiao Ran did not like Xie Jingyi who was used to being chased by a bunch of noble ladies. It was not known what he imagined as he asked with hidden excitement.Good question, little king!They also want to know if it\u2019s because of this!The crowd readied their ears with never before seen excitement.OMG! Jiang fourth miss was really gutsy! Wanting Heir Xie to call her mom!The man wearing silk robe in the corner stopped rubbing his ring and unconsciously straightened his back. His lips were pursed to a single line.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing this little king\u2019s bright and shining pair of eyes, she wondered what he imagined in his head. She admitted that she indeed had this kind of thought.But then she felt that this was not fair to Duke Ding.Duke Ding protected the family and the country, becoming Dayue\u2019s war deity and the stabilizing force. With him here, Dayue\u2019s commoners could felt peace and assured, not receiving the pain and horror that war brought.\u201cNo. Little king, saying this is humiliating Duke Ding. I\u2019ve always admired and respect Duke Ding, anticipating that I can be a part of his family. But now that Heir Xie rescinded the engagement, I only feel disappointment. There is no lingering attachment.\u201d\u201cThere may be people who think I\u2019m mad, but I only want to say, married to Duke Ding, even if the result is death, I won\u2019t regret!\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s brows were had a trace of sharpness. She heavily repeated her words and she looked solemn and determined.Duke Ding made her recall the strongest ability user during the apocalypse who killed the zombie king and then being poisoned. Before turning into a zombie, he killed himself.That time, Jiang Ningbao who had no ability looked at this scene from the city wall and it left a deep impression on her.Living once more, this had not changed.Recalling the book saying that Duke Ding only lived to thirty years old, the first thing Jiang Ningbao thought was the wine brewing skill she had.With her there, Duke Ding would have no problem living to a hundred years old.With the ray of light sneaking braking through the clouds, the soft looking lady had a layer of golden light, as if the plum tree that stubbornly grew in the winter.Strong and beautiful.The crowd went silent.The little king was shocked to silence.He suddenly felt that his action before was too frivolous and he had a rare moment of self-reflection. He spoke with embarrassment, \u201cJiang fourth miss, I\u2019m sorry. This heir apologize for the action before.\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes flashed with surprise. It seemed that this little king was not hopeless, after all, being able to know his mistake. The impression she had in her heart toward him became a bit better.\u201cI receive the little king\u2019s apology. May I know if I can leave?\u201d\u201cYou guys, make way! Don\u2019t surround Jiang fourth miss\u2019 carriage!\u201d The little king riding a horse gestured to his guards to make way and not surround Jiang Ningbao\u2019s carriage anymore.\u201cThank you, little king.\u201dJiang Ningbao released a silent breath. Changning Count Residence was too weak. Talking about Duke Ding was the right decision. She bowed to the little king and took Chun Xi who was in a trance to the carriage and left with her two guards.\u201cLady, that shocked me.\u201d On the carriage, Chun Xi wiped her cold sweat and patted her bosom in fear.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes flashed with light and smiled, \u201cThis matter is resolved peacefully. The little king is a reasonable person.\u201d Her heart sighed. To get away from the little king, she could only declare that she wanted to marry to Duke Ding.Good thing she had favorable impression on Duke Ding.If she could not get married to Duke Ding, she did not mind spending the rest of her life alone.Chun Xi: \u201c\u2026..\u201dWho did not know of King Rui Residence\u2019s little king\u2019s reputation? She had never heard that the little king was a reasonable person.The people who were still there were excited. They wanted to see a good show but they never thought to hear such a big rumor material.Little king Xiao Ran who was riding the horse gazed at the leaving carriage. His eyes squinted and flashed with a dangerous glint. His face sunk.\u201cGo investigate, who is it that schemed against this grandpa?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since there\u2019s a beauty with annulled engagement, the little king naturally became interested. If he liked her, then his harem may be one person larger.So he took his guards and came here in anxious curiosity.He wanted to shot her veiled hat away at first, but who knew that Jiang fourth miss had good reflexes and avoided his arrow. Although the process was different, he could still see Jiang fourth miss\u2019 real face.The face of Jiang fourth miss was truly as the news said. Soft and gentle with special air, making the people in his harem seemed like fake powders. It made him want to kidnap her away.A pity that this beauty vowed to get married with Duke Ding.Little king Xiao Ran was not an idiot. Although he liked beauties, but he would not force them. If he dared to kidnap her and ruined her reputation, then his father king would break his legs tomorrow.Being favored by his adopted son\u2019s ex-fiancee, no matter what Duke Ding was thinking, if he dared to go anything to Jiang fourth miss, it would be challenging Duke Ding Residence.\u201cMaster, this servant just got the news that Duke Ding Residence\u2019s Butler Zhao said that Old Madam Xie is very satisfied with Jiang fourth miss.\u201d A guard reported while trembling in fear.Little king Xiao Ran\u2019s face turned so dark, ink could be squeezed out of it. He was like a furious little lion, making others scared. He gritted his teeth and spoke with hatred.\u201cInvestigate! Investigate who is scheming this grandpa!\u201d\u2026..On the road back to the residence, the carriage turned to a corner and suddenly stopped. The driver\u2019s voice rang.\u201cFourth miss, there is a young master blocking the road.\u201dJiang Ningbao was stunned and opened the carriage\u2019s curtain to take a look. She saw a black horse with a handsome man with clear air who wore silk robes.The man\u2019s face, Jiang Ningbao was very familiar.This was her ex-fiance who was not willing to appear from the beginning to the end process of the engagement annulment. He was the book\u2019s male lead, Xie Jingyi.Jiang Ningbao knitted her brows.Why would Xie Jingyi block her carriage?The two guards bowed to Xie Jingyi and guarded the carriage nervously on each side.Jiang Ningbao did not left the carriage. Her pair of beautiful eyes met with her ex-fiance\u2019s cool ones.Chun Xi recognized Heir Xie and she asked in a small voice with worry, \u201cLady, we\u2019ve annulled the engagement, why is Heir Xie blocking our carriage?\u201dJiang Ningbao slightly shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dHer heart was silently guessing. Could it be that Xie Jingyi knew the conversation between her and the little king in front of the government office and wanted to warned her in person?At this time, Xie Jingyi pressed the horse\u2019s stomach and went forward.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s head flashed with many ideas, but when Xie Jingyi rose his horse over, she did not leave the carriage and only leaned on the window, giving him a polite smile with a tone of greeting, \u201cSir heir, it\u2019s been a long time!\u201dAs if the two were old friends who did not meet for a long time.There was not sadness or depression on her beautiful face from having her engagement annulled.Xie Jingyi was stunned from her polite smile and his hands tightened his hold on the reins. There were complicated emotions and guilt on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\u201cSir heir, is there something you need?\u201dJiang Ningbao ignored the guilt on his face and asked calmly.Not meeting for three years, Xie Jingyi who was the male lead became more good looking and got rid of his baby fat, turning more solemn and his air was more powerful.Too bad he was someone who bit the hand that fed him.\u201cJiang fourth miss, I\u2019ve always think of you as a sister. As long as you agree, we can still be a family, you\u2026.. you don\u2019t need to take your life as a joke.\u201dXie Jingyi who was on the horse hesitated and spoke with his clear magnetic voice.Jiang Ningbao realized why he was this way. It seemed that the conversation in front of the government office was heard by Heir Xie. She flicked her hair and had a faint smile on her lips.\u201cHearing Heir Xie\u2019s words, I only want to say; Heir Xie, being my fiance for these years, it has wronged you.\u201d\u201cGood thing I don\u2019t want to be sir heir\u2019s little sister, please do not mention this again.\u201d\u201cMy eight characters are very compatible with Duke Ding and the person suitable for Duke Ding. If sir heir cannot accept your ex-fiancee admiring your adopted father and feel humiliated, you can ignore it or intercept.

Her pair of eyes glanced at Xie Jingyi, waiting for this ex-fiance to no longer block the road.Chun Xi who was inside of the carriage stealthily looked at Heir Xie\u2019s face and her palm excreted cold sweat subconsciously.Lady spoke it right!Her heart agreed with what her lady was saying but she was also afraid that Heir Xie would get angry.Xie Jingyi was silent for a moment and his lips pursed. In the end, he gazed at her deep, not saying anything but pulled the rein to the side, giving her way.\u201cThanking the heir.\u201dJiang Ningbao smiled as she said her thank and immediately closed the curtain, blocking Xie Jingyi\u2019s view. Chun Xi released a breath of relief.To be honest, Chun Xi was really afraid that Heir Xie would be angry.Good thing he was not.Going back to Changning Count Residence, Jiang Ningbao decided to not meet Madam Zhang and Old Madam Jiang. She sent Chun Xi to announce to the Golden Longevity Hall and went back to her courtyard on her own. She sat down and sipped her fragrance tea as she admired the scene in her courtyard.There were footsteps outside the courtyard and a pretty female servant went in with male servants who were carrying a few big boxes.\u201cFourth lady, this servant is Old Madam Jiang\u2019s servant, Hong Xing. This is the list of the compensations from the duke residence, please take a look.\u201dHong Xing bowed to Jiang Ningbao and respectfully gave the book.Jiang Ningbao was slightly surprised.Old madam actually gave her the compensations this fast.Receiving the book, Jiang Ningbao did not open the book to check and put it on the table. She nodded, \u201cYes. Go back and tell grandmother that I\u2019ve received them.\u201d She then gestured for them to leave.Hong Xing was stunned, \u201cFourth lady, why don\u2019t you check?\u201d\u201cNo need. I trust grandmother.\u201d Jiang Ningbao slightly curved her lips and showed a trusting smile.Since the old madam had showed her stance in this matter in the hall, she would not hit her own face. Moreover, Butler Zhao had also said that these compensations were hers.Old Madam Jiang was not that short sighted.Thing kind of embarrassing thing, once was enough.As for First Madam Zhang, there was Old Madam Jiang suppressing her from above, she won\u2019t dare to do anything outrageous.Hong Xing\u2019s gaze changed and she revealed a real smile. She bowed toward Jiang Ningbao and led the male servants out, leaving the few big boxes.The room went silent.Jiang Ningbao took out a custom made rose scented slender stick of incense and lit it up. A moment later, the room was filled with the clear fragrance of rose, making people relax.Compared to sandalwood incense, agalloch eaglewood incense, or benzoin incense, Jiang Ningbao preferred the natural made flower incense.The craft of making incense were taught to her by her mother, Madam Yang. After Jiang Ningbao learned it, she could make incense from flowers. Every year, she would let Manager Yao gather all kinds of flower to make wine and incense.Jiang Ningbao sat on the short chair silently and made a pot of tea. Her mind flashed little king Xiao Ran\u2019s face and she felt that the little king\u2019s action today was not normal.Who would shot an arrow at a female stranger on the streets? It\u2019s not like there was a grudge either.The people in Changning Count Residence could not reach the little king and she seldom went out. The probability of making grudge outside were zero. There was only Yang Shuqing. She met Yang Shuqing and their meeting did not went pleasantly. She even broke Yang Shuqing\u2019s lies.The female lead was a cruel and merciless person.She had known the fact that the female lead disguised herself as a man and was intimate with Xie Jingyi so the female lead would definitely remember her.Jiang Ningbao sipped her tea. Once this hypothesis was out, she could be sure that it was Yang Shuqing who did this. A pity that aside from the first male support character, King Qin, there was no one else who knew that Yang Shuqing and Xie Jingyi knew each other for two years.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that if she spread this, others would think that this ex-fiancee was having her revenge out of not being resigned feelings.Jiang Ningbao had wanted to do so early on.In Jiang Ningbao\u2019s perspective, this first male support character was a tragic guy. He was schemed by Yang Shuqing to get his legs broken in previous life, having no qualification for the big seat.This lifetime, Yang Shuqing wanted to compensate him because of guilt and also getting her revenge against her previous lifetime\u2019s husband at the same time. She got close to him with intentions and helped him, using Anquan Marquis Residence\u2019s power to help him get to the throne, becoming the protector.\u201cFemale lead halo is really annoying.\u201dJiang Ningbao squinted her eyes and sipped her tea. There were still many days ahead. They might become mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in the future. Settling the account then would not be late.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chun Xi, tidy it up and put inside of the personal storage.\u201d Speaking this, she thought about it, rose, and took a red whip. She tried it a few times and the movements were fluid and natural.\u201cThis whip is still as good as it was.\u201dJiang Ningbao nodded in satisfaction. She had not used a whip for many years so she was a bit rusty.\u201cLady, why are you taking the whip out?\u201d Chun Xi was busy tidying the things inside the boxes and saw her lady using a whip with eyes wide.\u201cI thought about it and feel that taking a whip outside is safer.\u201d Jiang Ningbao trailed over the red whip and her lips formed a light smile.She had promised her mother, Madam Yang, to become a gentle and refined young lady. But this time, only this time, after her mother came back, she would understand her choice.She was shot by an arrow from little king Xiao Ran today without any reason so there was a sense of danger in Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart.Who knew if she would encounter danger later on? Especially after she was remembered by the female lead.Having a whip by her side, she could use it when there was danger and did not need to use her hands. Who knew if there was a male scammer who set up an accident?Jiang Ningbao was not rest assured by her beautiful soft and weak and pitiful looks.It attracted wolves too much.Chun Xi could not help bu recall when her lady was still nine years old, she easily broke a tree and brought it down with her whip and shuddered. She trembled and spoke carefully, \u201cLady, you\u2019re already skilled. It\u2019s no difference whether there\u2019s a whip or not. Who would dare to bump into you?\u201dIf her lady did not took out the red whip she had not used for years, Chun Xi who had gotten used to her lady\u2019s soft and weak looks would\u2019ve forgotten how fierce her lady was when she was little.At that time, there were the second master, second mistress, and the third young master who hid this so no one knew the lady\u2019s secret.\u201cWe have to take precautions to prevent any accidents from happening. With the whip, I won\u2019t need to dirty my hand.\u201dJiang Ningbao answered and put away the whip.Chun Xi: \u201c\u2026..\u201dThe lady was always this vigilant even in peace time.But after thinking about it, the lady was right. Going outside was indeed not safe, especially after the arrow today. It the lady had not reacted in time, she might have been injured.At this moment, the master and servant duo never thought that the little king\u2019s objective today was only seeing Jiang Ningbao\u2019s real face.Who let the little king always be domineering and abnormal?Main CourtyardFirst Madam Zhang who went back to the courtyard was furious. She shouted at the servants to go out, only leaving old servant Yang inside. She threw the things inside the room and her face was dark and scary.\u201cMadam, please ease your anger.\u201dOld servant Yang was afraid. She looked at the floor full of broken pieces and water stain. Her heart was bleeding. These were all good high quality porcelain, but the madam broke them all to pieces.If the old madam knew, she would scold the madam for wasting expenses.\u201cPa!\u201dA glaze colored flower vase was broken to pieces, the flower inside the vase and the water fell on the flower.\u201cEase my anger? Why should I? Once I think that those big boxes of compensation will be taken by that wretch from the second branch, how can I swallow this?\u201dFirst Madam Zhang heaved and she shouted in dark fury.It was obviously the compensation she discussed with Heir Xie, but it actually fell on the hands of fourth girl. The old madam also pulled her down by pretending to be magnanimous. When they left, the count also glared at her, blaming her for not finishing this matter well. Who knew which fox\u2019s room he was resting in now?She was busy for nothing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A few days ago, her mother sent a servant to say that the house already unemployed not little servants while the ones remaining were the ones that could not be unemployed, maintaining the face of the noble family.If the family was too poor, Madam Zhang would not have face so she had to help.Changning Count Residence did not have merits and had no fourth rank officials or above for a few generations. The residence did not lack money and the deceased second brother was a business genius, earning a lot of money and obtaining many lands for the count residence.At the beginning, she placed importance on this point and when her second sister-in-law, Madam Yang, wanted to have separate residence, Madam Zhang kept talking to the old madam about how it was best that brothers helped each other and benefit from each other non-stop.And it was proven that she was right.The count residence flourished day by day and the food and clothes became better not just by one level.After her second brother-in-law and her second sister-in-law met with mishap, the money fell to the old madam\u2019s grasp. Madam Zhang did not dare to blatantly used the money to help her family. She had two sons and her eldest daughter-in-law was pregnant and was casting her gaze on the compensation in Jiang Ningbao\u2019s hand. She especially said she wanted the two big boxes of gold.Now, because of the old madam\u2019s words, there was nothing. It all went to the hands of the wretch from the second branch.Madam Zhang was so angry she almost vomit blood.\u201cMadam, the fifth rank position fell on the count and the fifth lady is about to get engaged with Xie family\u2019s second branch\u2019s legal young master. There must not be any mistake at this point. After fifth lady\u2019s engagement is settled, it\u2019s not too late to deal with fourth lady.\u201d Old servant Yang was afraid that the madam would do something bad in impulse and tried to persuade her.Once First Madam Zhang heard old servant Yang mentioning Yao\u2019er, her fury lessened.That\u2019s right. The most important thing was to settle the engagement belonging to Yao\u2019er.Dealing with Jiang Ningbao was a later matter.\u201cOld servant Yang, pick some clever servants with good looks to the Western Courtyard, lest others said that our Changning Count Residence treated the second branch\u2019s lady horribly because she only had a single servant.\u201d First Madam Zhang spoke darkly.\u201cAnd the second branch\u2019s Brother Jin is almost eighteen and there is no close female servants around him. This is the neglect of this aunt. Remember to send some pretty female servants with some means to his courtyard.\u201dAfter Jiang Ningbao woke up from a nap at noon, there were laughter and talks outside the courtyard.Jiang Ningbao knitted her brows. She rose from the bed and wore her outer clothes. She walked out the room and saw four pretty female servants embroidering pouch under the eaves in the verandas.\u201cWho are you? Why are you here?\u201dThe four servants heard an unhappy inquiry and lifted their heard. It was the fourth lady. They hurriedly rose and put down their embroidery and respectfully greeted, \u201cThis servant greets fourth lady.\u201d\u201cUs servants were sent by the first madam to serve the miss.\u201d A servant with apple shaped face explained clearly and sharply. After saying this, the four of them introduced themselves.They had their own specialty and did not let others find fault.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes flashed. So they were the servants sent by oldest aunt.Three years ago, after her parents met an accident, the servants in hers and her brother\u2019s courtyard all left one by one to find another master and left the Western Courtyard. Her oldest aunt never said anything.But then that oldest aunt sent four servants here to serve her.Just thinking about it was obvious that there was problem.But Jiang Ningbao could not refuse. As a lady from the count residence, it was too poor to have only one servant by her side. If she refused now, there would be another time.If she wanted to buy servants from the outside or arrange some servants into the residence, they need to go through first Madam Zhang and not only it was troublesome, it may not be successful.Jiang Ningbao considered it and let the four servants stay after remembering their names.\u201cBai Mei, where is Chun Xi?\u201dWhen Bai Mei was about to answer, Chun Xi hurried into the courtyard. Seeing her lady awoken, she immediately stepped forward, as if there was something she wanted to say. Jiang Ningbao called Chun Xi into the room and closed the door.The four servants outside exchanged glances.The servant called Bai Mei pursed her lips and stealthily put her ear on the door, but she could not hear anything. So she could only go back to the veranda to embroider pouches.Inside the room.Jiang Ningbao sat on the short chair and glanced at the unmasked fury on Chun Xi\u2019s face. She could not help but ask, \u201cChun Xi, did something happen?\u201d\u201cLady, first madam called four female servants over when you are sleeping. Not only that, first madam sent four beautiful and seductive female servants to third young master\u2019s courtyard, saying that they were the bed servants for third young master.\u201dAfter Chun Xi said to the end, her face turned red and her voice became smaller.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes darkened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If her older brother weren\u2019t at Azure Mountain Academy studying right now, it might ruined her older brother.At this moment, Jiang Ningbao was truly glad that after the mourning period, her older brother entered Azure Mountain Academy with the help of her maternal family.If he was in the count residence, how could he study in peace?\u201cI will write a letter to older brother.\u201dJiang Ningbao thought about it. Her older brother had mentioned that he would go back to the residence at the end of the month. It seemed that it was better if he did not return, lest her oldest aunt made another move.After Chun Xi sent the letter, Jiang Ningbao stayed in the residence with relief, not minding the storm and rain outside.\u2026..The teahouse and winehouse in the capital was in a buzz. The people in the capital were all discussing Jiang fourth miss\u2019 appearance and the words she spoke in front of the government office, mentioning Duke Ding.\u201cJiang fourth miss is really brave, saying that Heir Xie and Miss Yang is a match in front of many people.\u201d\u201cTruly brave.\u201d\u201cI heard that if it were not for the arrow shot by King Rui Residence\u2019s little king, every one would not know that Jiang fourth miss is actually that beautiful. A pity I was not there, if not, I can see how beautiful Jiang fourth miss is.\u201d\u201cI was there at the time. Jiang fourth miss is really beautiful and very charismatic too. Who was it that spread the words that Jiang fourth miss is ugly beyond compare? Maybe it was because of jealousy?\u201d\u201cSo what if she\u2019s pretty? Heir Xie still annul the engagement. A girl whose engagement is annulled and both parents deceased, not to mention that her clan is not that prominent. Even if she\u2019s beautiful, she won\u2019t find a good engagement.\u201d\u201cTch, you\u2019re being as sour as grape because you can\u2019t get the grape. Jiang fourth miss doesn\u2019t even mind, even saying that she wanted to get married to Duke Ding who she respects since she was little. Do you dare?\u201d\u201cRight, right. I admire Jiang fourth miss\u2019 guts. I hope that things can go as she wished for.\u201d\u201cWhy do I feel that you\u2019re laughing at Heir Xie?\u201d\u201cI feel that way too.\u201d\u201cCan it be that you don\u2019t want Jiang fourth miss to get married to Duke Ding?\u201d\u201cHeng! I feel that Jiang fourth miss is out of her mind and want to get vengeance on Heir Xie, deliberately saying she wants to get married to Duke Ding when it\u2019s actually only to humiliate Heir Xie.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s reasonable. Jiang fourth miss had her engagement canceled, she must have resentment in her heart, but she should not take Duke Ding as a laughing matter.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. A girl whose engagement is annulled and her reputation is not good, how can she be worthy of Duke Ding? Moreover, Jiang fourth miss is Heir Xie\u2019s ex-fiance, this is not fitting with the customs.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say whether or not that fits the custom. Duke Ding has went through life and death for Dayue, protecting Dayue Dynasty. I only want there to be a good wife for him. Those noble girls all fear death and hide from him like there\u2019s he\u2019s a viper. At least Jiang fourth miss had the guts. Just for this, she\u2019s worthy of Duke Ding.\u201dOnce these words came out, the crowd immediately agreed.\u201cI have inside news that the first time Butler Zhao went to annul the engagement, Jiang fourth miss rejected Heir Xie\u2019s compensation and said that she wanted to get married to Duke Ding. A few days ago, Old Madam Xie went to the Clear Water Temple to find Monk Gao regarding the eight characters.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the result?\u201d\u201cSeems like Jiang fourth miss\u2019 life is special and very suitable with Duke Ding\u2019s eight characters.\u201d\u201cAa, really?\u201d\u201cOf course! Every one is waiting for Old Madam Xie to propose to Changning Count Residence.\u201dOn the second floor of a certain teahouse.Yang Shuqing who wore male clothing were sitting there, drinking her tea. Knowing that Jiang Ningbao and Heir Xie had officially annulled the engagement, her heart was in a good mood. But hearing the discussion below, the hand grabbing the teacup tightened and her eyes darkened.\u201cMaster, Jiang fourth miss really said that she wanted to get married to Duke Ding, is she muddle-headed or is she doing this on purpose to humiliate Heir Xie?\u201d Qian Rong who disguised as a male could not help but voice her suspicion.Yang Shuqing squinted her eyes and a dark light flashed by.\u201cJiang fourth miss won\u2019t have that chance to marry into the duke residence.\u201dIn her previous life, Jiang Ningbao obtained the ancient wine brewing recipe but she still could not safe Duke Ding\u2019s life. Not to mention that in this life, the wine brewing recipe had fallen into her hands.So what if her life was special? A few years ago, there were a few women with special life. A pity that they were all defeated and henceforth, no one dared to get married to Duke Ding.Duke Ding became the poisonous tortoise in the eyes of Dayue Dynasty\u2019s females.Jiang Ningbao won\u2019t be an exception.Once Yang Shuqing thought this, feeling that she was worrying for nothing, the discomfort in her heart vanished.She would sit and wait for Jiang Ningbao\u2019s laughingstock.Suddenly, a little male servant entered the teahouse anxiously. He went to the second floor to find Yang Shuqing who was disguising as a male and spoke something in a low voice to her. Yang Shuqing\u2019s face changed greatly and she hurriedly left the teahouse after paying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was still that good day of a bright and brilliant spring.The capital was filled with various rumors. Jiang Ningbao only smiled and had good sleep.She had received her older brother\u2019s letter and also the star origami her older brother made for her. Jiang Ningbao looked at this star origami and laughed warmly and brilliantly.This star origami was related to the memory they had together.She still remembered when her brother was five years old and she was three, he said: Little sister, what do you like, big brother will give you.Jiang Ningbao laughed on the spot and felt that her older brother was very cute. Coincidentally, it was night and the sky was filled with stars, so she pointed to the sparkling star in the sky and teased him, \u201cI like the star in the sky.\u201dThe little five years old shouta, her older brother, stared at the stars in the sky, stunned. He then wailed and cried.\u201cLittle sister, big brother is useless, not able to give you the stars you like.\u201dIn the end, Jiang Ningbao taught her older brother how to make star origami.It was unknown if it was because of the star matter, but her older brother had an obsession. Every year, he would send her the star origamis he folded himself. On these star origamis, there would be various kinds of decorative patterns and designs.Very beautiful.Jiang Ningbao stopped thinking about it and poured out the star origamis inside the jar onto the table. When looked closely, every star origami had its own decorative patterns.The more she looked, the wider her smile.Maybe good things come in groups. When she woke up from her nap, Jiang Ningbao received the invitation Old Madam Xie sent, making her heart felt more at ease. It seemed that it was as Butler Zhao said, Old Madam Xie should be satisfied with her.\u201cChun Xi, we\u2019ll go to Duke Ding Residence tomorrow.\u201d\u201cLady, you\u2026..you will really go to Duke Ding Residence tomorrow?\u201d Chun Xi put the food box and took out a few delicate snacks the main kitchen made. She asked with hesitation.\u201cThat\u2019s right. This is the invitation Old Madam Xie gave herself. We might even meet Duke Ding.\u201d Jiang Ningbao waved the invitation card in a good mood, her brows showed her smiles.She was really looking forward to the meeting tomorrow.Chun Xi was not that happy. Once she thought that her lady would go to Duke Ding Residence and might meet Duke Ding, her heart was filled with worry. If something happened to the lady, how could she explain it to the third young master?But seeing her lady happy, she only moved her mouth and did not say anything in the end. She, a servant, could not change the master\u2019s matter, but telling others was another thing.\u201cLady, when this servant came back, I heard the old servants saying that an official matchmaker came. This seems to be for the fifth lady.\u201dJiang Ningbao retracted her smile and silently sighed that such a day had come. This was Jiang Mingyao\u2019s and Xie Jinghui\u2019s destiny.\u201cIt should be the official matchmaker sent by Xie family\u2019s second branch. Fifth sister is the same age as me. If she does not get an engagement, it might be late later.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually Xie family\u2019s second mistress\u2026..\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She really had no good impression on Xie family\u2019s second branch. Her lady mourned for three years and every year, there would be a lot of presents sent to Duke Ding Residence and Xie family\u2019s second branch, but Xie family\u2019s second mistress would send return gifts according to customs and it would be polite and distant.What made her heart went cold was last year, when her lady had her fifteen years old coming of age ceremony, Xie second mistress did not even send a gift.Chun Xi\u2019s heart ached for her lady.\u201cSince I\u2019ve annulled my engagement with the heir, I have no relation to Xie second branch. There won\u2019t be any necessity to send gifts to Xie Residence.\u201d Jiang Ningbao spoke faintly and put down the invitation in her hand. She washed her hands using the water in the basin on the side and took a snack and ate it.These past few years, she had already seen the selfish and snobbish nature of Xie second mistress.If it weren\u2019t because she had an engagement with Xie Jingyi and did not want outsiders to nitpick at her fault, she would\u2019ve stopped any relation with Xie second branch after her parents met with an accident.Now was a good chance to cut everything off with Xie family\u2019s second branch.Chun Xi was happy. Her lady finally did not need to have anything to do with the Xie family.\u201cYes, lady.\u201d\u201cChun Xi, these few days, do Bai Mei and the rest behave well?\u201d As Jiang Ningbao ate pea-flour cake, she inquired about the four servants that just came.\u201cThe four of them did things with good behavior and never entered the lady\u2019s room.\u201d\u201cContinue to keep your eyes on them.\u201dJiang Ningbao did not trust them. She always had only Chun Xi by her side and never let them serve her. Even when getting food from the main kitchen, it was always Chun Xi.The four servants sent by Madam Zhang were arranged to do other things.\u201cYes, lady.\u201dEven if her lady did not say this, Chun Xi would also keep her eyes on them.\u201cIs there anything new going on in the capital these past three days?\u201d After Jiang Ningbao ate a snack, she sipped her fragrance tea and asked about the gossip in the capital in interest.Chun Xi shook her head. \u201cLady, there was nothing new going on these past two to three days. The whole capital is discussing your matter. You\u2019re already a famous person within the capital.\u201dSaying this, Chun Xi was full of complaints.\u201cIt\u2019s already been three days, how can Heir Xie still not propose to Anyuan Marquis Residence?\u201dJiang Ningbao did not care about the gossip about her. She felt it was strange. How could there still be no good news about the male and female lead?As long as they made an engagement, then the capital would be in an uproar about them.There were outstanding men around Yang Shuqing. No matter the past life\u2019s husband, King Jin, or King Qin, or the other kings, the ones of age already had wives. The female lead already swore that she won\u2019t be a concubine in this life, especially the imperial family.Like this, Xie Jingyi who had a great background, was clean and had no woman in his harem, also the heir to Duke Ding Residence was the first choice.The noble ladies who paid attention to him were countless.She did not believe that Yang Shuqing won\u2019t grasp this chance that did not come easy.The longer the time, the more the variables.Chun Xi shook her head in confusion. \u201cNo.\u201dJiang Ningbao sat on the comfortable pillow and her lips curved to a smile, \u201cHeir Xie annulled the engagement for Miss Yang, but he is not anxious to be engaged with Miss Yang. This is strange.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Not only this servant felt curious, there are also messy rumors outside. But these rumors only flew for a short while before disappearing. Anyuan Marquis is bustling. I heard that a favored concubine mixed up the bloodline of the marquis and was caned to death.\u201d\u201cThis kind of disgraceful matter is not suppressed, but becomes so bustling that everyone knows.\u201d\u201cBut this still does not suppress the rumors related to the lady.\u201d After Chun Xi was happy, her expression was sullen.Once Jiang Ningbao heard about this, she felt it was familiar and went through her memory. She immediately thought of a scene in the book.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After she was reborn, she accidentally found a proof of this concubine mixing up the marquis residence\u2019s bloodline and schemed so Anyuan Marquis would know.This concubine born eldest son was actually the child Concubine Yan stealthily took from her maternal family. She only gave birth to a daughter and she was Yang Shuqing\u2019s concubine born little sister, Yang Wanling.The male and female twins were fake.This daughter of Concubine Yan, Yang Wanling, was the person the blackened \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 worked with to deal with the female lead but was instead dealt by the female lead tragically.This kind of thing was originally suppressed by Anyuan Marquis, but Yang Shuqing silently spread it out and she added fuel to the flames, making the whole capital abuzz with this matter, but it was suppressed in the end.It seemed that female leads who got reborn for revenge all like this kind of ruining the reputation of the targets of vengeance.Yang Shuqing never thought that once she spread this out, although it ruined her concubine born little sister\u2019s reputation, but Anyuan Marquis Residence\u2019s reputation was also ruined a lot. A marquis actually got deceived by a concubine for almost twenty years. His face would be all gone.\u201cThis servant almost forgot. Manager Yao gave news to this servant, saying that King Rui Residence\u2019s little king had met Miss Yang and it was unknown what they were talking about. When Miss Yang left, her face was dark and sullen that it\u2019s scary.\u201d\u201cI never thought that Miss Yang and the little king had some relations.\u201dChun Xi frowned.\u201cMiss Yang is talented and is beautiful with a good background. There are a lot of people who like her. Little king is known for his love for beauties. It\u2019s not strange that he has some relations with Miss Yang.\u201dJiang Ningbao squinted her eyes. She felt that the reason why the male and female leads did not make an engagement should be because of this little king from King Rui Residence. Little king Xiao Ran was the book\u2019s number two male support character who solved a lot of female lead\u2019s problems and enemies both blatantly and silently. He swept many obstacles in the female lead\u2019s road of revenge.It seemed that her guess was right. Little king\u2019s appearance was not a coincidence.With her, this female canon fodder who was not acting according to script, who knew if this little king who liked beauties Xiao Ran would still fall in love with the female lead like in the book. Jiang Ningbao thought with interest.Chun Xi: \u201c\u2026..\u201dActually, her lady did not lose to Miss Yang. That one time her lady\u2019s face was revealed among the crowd, the audience were all surprised and they praised the lady\u2019s beauty and aura. Her lady was not the capital\u2019s top five beauties.This, Chun Xi did not dare to tell her lady.As a trusted servant, she always knew that her lady did not like the soft and weak looks her lady had.Midday, Jiang Mingyao\u2019s engagement was made. The official matchmaker left and the whole Changning Count Residence was in a happy mood.Old Madam Jiang and First Madam Zhang gave thirty percent additional salary to the servants because of this happy matter.When Jiang Ningbao knew Jiang Mingyao\u2019s engagement was made, she only smiled. The other party was like she thought, Xie Residence\u2019s second branch second legal young master, Xie Jinghui.This time, Jiang Mingyao did not come over.She heard that Madam Zhang arrested her in the courtyard to make her wedding dress. The date was also settled, in this year\u2019s latter half. The wedding was a bit rushed, Madam Zhang specially invited the old servant from the palace to teach Jiang Mingyao for this matter.A few days ago, Jiang Mingyao went to her place three times. Jiang Ningbao only placate her with a few sentences and did not act as an understanding older sister. Madam Zhang\u2019s action of sending women to her older brother\u2019s courtyard made her uncomfortable and she did not want to get close to Jiang Mingyao.If the encounters increase, feelings would deepen and the chains would increase.Jiang Ningbao disliked troubles.\u2026..Large barracks in Western SuburbsA handsome man with grave and stern expression with swift and fierce momentum sat on the table, sorting through documents. The man\u2019s whole body emitted a tyrannical aura that made people\u2019s hearts tremble. A moment later, he put down the writing brush and closed his eyes. The string of shiny purple wooden buddhist beads on his wrist was attractive.This handsome man was Dayue Dynasty\u2019s war deity \u2014 Duke Ding Xie Heng.\u201cMaster, the old madam asked you to return to the residence to discuss some matters.\u201d A man wearing black clothes entered soundlessly and spoke respectfully.This black clothed was one of Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s personal guards.\u201cMother?\u201dDuke Ding, Xie Heng, lifted his handsome faces. His pair of sharp eyes carried a natural dominating aura and his voice was low and cold as he spoke, \u201cDid something happen in the residence?\u201d\u201cReplying master. There is indeed something big happening in the residence. Heir and Jiang fourth miss annulled their engagement three days ago.\u201dAlso, Jiang fourth miss and the master\u2019s rumors were out of control.The black clothed man silently swallowed the latter words.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s sharp sword-like brows knitted. His finger tapped lightly on the table. He lightly said, \u201cReason.\u201dThe black clothed man lowered his head. He spoke from the events in Plum Blossom Banquet and told the cause and reasons of the heir annulling the engagement in detail.When Duke Ding Xie Heng heard that the heir knelt in the old madam\u2019s courtyard to force her to agree, his body exploded with a violent and sharp aura, making the black clothed man\u2019s face turned white and he excreted cold sweat, almost kneeling.Fortunately, this violent aura was only released for a moment and disappeared.\u201cContinue!\u201dFrom Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s cold voice, no emotions could be heard.The black clothed man mentally lit up a candle for the heir. Even though the master usually did not seem intimate with the old madam, even rarely going back to Duke Ding Residence, that\u2019s because the master could not get near. They, these personal guards, knew that the master placed the most importance on the old madam.How could the heir not know?\u201cReturn to the residence tomorrow.\u201dHearing the black clothed man\u2019s report, Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s eyes turned frosty cold. He lightly patted the purple beads on his wrist and spoke with no emotion..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His face was handsome and his air was cold and noble, making people admired.\u201cSir Heir, it\u2019s time to depart.\u201dXie Jingyi\u2019s male servant looked at the sandglass in the room and he reminded in a small voice.\u201cI will greet grandmother first.\u201dXie Jingyi nodded lightly and went out the room in large strides. He took his male servant to Thriving Joy Hall and waited to see the old madam to inform her. Heir Xie took the official matchmaker and generous betrothal gifts along with a bunch of guards with him as he went to Anyuan Marquis Residence in a vast and mighty manner.After knowing that her adoptive grandson left, Old Madam Xie let out a breath.She did not want Jiang little miss to meet her adoptive grandson when she arrived and chose to invite Jiang little miss to Duke Ding Residence on the day her adoptive grandson propose to Anyuan Marquis Residence. At the same time, she also incidentally let her meet her own son.Coincidentally, when Heir Xie went out, Jiang Ningbao who dressed up delicately went in her horse carriage as she hugged a jug of medicinal wine she brewed to go to Duke Ding Residence to meet Old Madam Xie.Main Courtyard\u201cMadam, Bai Mei said that fourth lady is invited by Old Madam Xie to Duke Ding Residence and that Old Madam Xie wanted to meet fourth lady.\u201d Old servant Yang\u2019s face was not looking good.She did not want to see fourth lady holding onto Duke Ding Residence.First Madam Zhang sipped her tea and coldly laughed, \u201cThe noble ladies Old Madam Xie met are not little. Don\u2019t know if she had that luck.\u201d\u201cCall Zhuo boy here.\u201dMadam Zhang thought to her family\u2019s crisis. Her oldest nephew had not had an engagement while fourth girl possessed the plentiful dowry her second sister-in-law had. Her heart could not help sprouting some ideas.Old servant Yang called someone to find the oldest young master. After Jiang Zhuo came, Madam Zhang ordered the servants to get out, only leaving her trusted servant old servant Yang.It was unknown what Madam Zhang said. Once Jiang Zhuo went back to his courtyard, he went out the residence after.Anyuan Marquis Residence was basked in a happy atmosphere.The servants in the residence all knew that on this day, the heir from Duke Ding Residence came to propose to their oldest miss. This news spread throughout the whole capital.Who knew how many hearts of noble ladies it broke.Heir Xie was a desired bachelor. In terms of background and skill, he was in the top-notch selections. At the age of nineteen years old, he was already a sixth rank official five cities military forces commander, responsible for the capital\u2019s public security.Later, he would inherit the position and connections of Duke Ding Residence.Anyuan Marquis was smug.If there was not that falling into water accident, her oldest legal daughter won\u2019t be able to get this kind of good engagement.Once Anyuan Marquis thought that his son-in-law was the future Duke Ding, the smile on his face won\u2019t fade. This engagement was a very rare perfect match.Around forty five minutes after 9 to 11 a.m., the group arrived in Anyuan Marquis Residence.Under the witness of the official matchmaker, the two houses formally exchanged horoscope cards and wrote down the marriage certificate on the spot.There were three copies.The last one was for the government office to keep.Yang Shuqing who hid behind the screen lifted her lips to a relaxed happy smile. Her heart was now rest assured.She had finally got engaged with Xie Jingyi.She would be Xie Jingyi\u2019s official fiancee, the future Duchess Ding.Living once more, Yang Shuqing had investigated thoroughly that the beautiful encounters of her and King Jin were all calculated carefully. But she idiotically fell into the love trap he made and became cefei as if she was mad. And she also used her maternal family\u2019s support and Yang family\u2019s military power to push King Jin to be the emperor.This time, she avoided King Jin\u2019s calculations, even allied herself with King Qin to cut down the power he gathered in the dark. Now, she was engaged with Xie Jingyi, completely changing her fate.At the same time, feeling happy, Yang Shuqing\u2019s mind could not help but think about Jiang fourth miss\u2019 feeble as a willow, slim and beautiful figure. There was also the King Rui\u2019s little king\u2019s biting sarcasms. Because of his appearance, she and Xie Jingyi had a little misunderstanding, delaying the time of engagement.Yang Shuqing\u2019s heart smiled coldly.Jiang fourth miss really had good move, even that total womanizer little king was beguiled with her pitiful appearance and stick out for her.How could this kind of woman be worthy of Xie Jingyi\u2019s love and pamper?She and Xie Jingyi had known each other for two years and she knew him. Xie Jingyi seemed cold and aloof, but he a had strong sense of responsibility. Maybe Jiang fourth miss used this point to get hold of Xie Jingyi\u2019s heart.Jiang fourth miss was a two faced woman with scheming heart.She thought it wrong before. Maybe Xie Jingyi was not enticed with her weak and beautiful appearance, but because Xie Jingyi was a good and responsible man.Thinking like this, Yang Shuqing\u2019s heart became a lot more comfortable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, their miss once more revealed a happy smile.The two were now engaged, hence, there was no more need to hide.After Yang Shuqing thought it through, she led her two servant girls to walk from behind the screen.Today, Yang Shuqing wore a dark red peony dress. It was a match with Xie Jingyi\u2019s dark red clothes with silver thread.It was a coincidence.The official matchmaker saw this and could not help but laugh. She praised sincerely, saying, \u201cMarquis, Heir Xie and Miss Yang are connected by heart, finding each other congenial.\u201dAnyuan Marquis laughed loudly.Although Yang Shuqing\u2019s looks could not be said to be unrivalled beauty, her looks were clear, brilliant, and magnanimous, especially this time. On her white skin was red blush, carrying a trace of shyness, making one unable to avert eyes.She took a glance on the handsome and talented Heir Xie. A sweetness rose from her heart.\u2026..Duke Ding Residence was at the west side of the capital, claiming a large land. The residences surrounding it was all second rank and above high-ranking official\u2019s residences. From Changning Count Residence to Duke Ding Residence was pretty near, only needed an hour of journey.An hour later, the carriage arrived in front of the main gate of Duke Ding Residence. Chun Xi went down the carriage first and took out the invitation card sent by Old Madam Xie. The guards in front of the gate took a look at it and opened the red gates, then shouted to the inside.Jiang Ningbao stepped on the small chair to get down the carriage and within her embrace was a delicate and small wine jar.Today, she specially wore a light blue embroidered white magnolia dress.The two guards saw the rumored beauty for the first time, Jiang fourth miss who carried a good aura, and they could not help but take a few more glances. The rumor was indeed true.Jiang fourth miss was really good looking.With one look, a person would know that this girl was they type to have weak and pitiful beauty but had an air of her own that was special to her.Around fifteen minutes, Butler Zhao hurried over and saw Jiang fourth miss who was standing slim and graceful. A smile hung on his face.\u201cJiang fourth miss, this way please. The old madam has been waiting for you!\u201d Saying this, Butler Zhao curiously glanced at the small and delicate wine jar Jiang fourth miss brought in her hands.\u201cDadada\u2026..\u201dThe sound of a bunch of horses galloping rang.Following that, a group of men in black clothes rode horses in a hurry. The man leading them was a handsome purple clothed man with an imposing manner. His long dark purple gown was blown by the wind.Jiang Ningbao who just stepped on the stairway looked back in curiosity. Her beautiful pair of eyes coincidentally met with the man\u2019s deep, swift, and fierce eyes, as if a sharp sword unsheathed, carrying a trace of violent killing intent. Just one look would make one\u2019s back to be drenched in cold sweat.Chun Xi who was at the side gasped a mouthful of cold air, her eyes carried fear and her face was white. She unconsciously lowered her head and clutched the place her heart was as she staggered and trembled.How scary!Jiang Ningbao was not affected. She only thought that the man in dark purple long gown was cool and domineering. Maybe it was the aesthetic views developed during the apocalypse for more than ten years that led Jiang Ningbao to admire strong, handsome, and spirited men.Although she admired this, Jiang Ningbao only took a glance and averted her eyes calmly. When she wanted to retract her gaze, she found a pleasant surprise. Her gaze landed on the bracelet the man wore. It was a string of smooth and shiny purple buddhist beads.This was the symbolic buddhist bracelet.Jiang Ningbao had a realization. So the one leading them, the one who wore dark purple long gown man, was actually Duke Ding, Xie Heng.Her lips curved up. What kind of affinity was this? The first she accepted Old Madam Xie\u2019s invitation to meet, she met Duke Ding Xie Heng on the gates of the residence.The first time meeting, this man was to her liking.The man riding black horse with cold and violent air who wore dark purple long gown did not think that he would meet a soft and delicate young girl in the gates of Duke Ding Residence, especially that when this girl met his pair of eyes filled with ominous air, she was not afraid, even calmly staring at the purple buddhist bracelet he wore.The man pursed his thin lips and his voice was cold and dense, dignified and deep.\u201cStop!\u201dWith one command, the group of black clothed men tardily held their reins and the horses rose their front feet up, all raising their heads to shout out and stopped around the gates.The man wearing a dark purple long gown was the first to come down the horse with clean and quick movements and then stood beside the horse. The man was tall and straight with handsome and cold features. His eyes were deep and cold, as if inside was endless tyranny and darkness.As if he was a walking weapon..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The gaze traveled in all directions. Even the two guards unconsciously held their breaths, not daring to make eye contact and walked backwards.Actually, this was also the reason why the man wearing a dark purple long gown deliberately did not restrain his ominous air.The rest of the black clothed men went down their horses one by one, each with straight stature and sharpness with ominous air. It was obvious that they were soldiers who had gone to the battlefield, but they kept a distance with the dark purple clothed man with only one black clothed man nearer to him.\u201cButler Zhao, is the duke the one in front?\u201dJiang Ningbao calmly lifted the small and delicate wine jar and stood on the stairway gracefully, her gaze settled on the man wearing a dark purple long gown as she asked Butler Zhao who was by her side.Chun Xi stood behind her miss in fear with her body slightly trembling. Sweat had covered her back.Why was her miss still not going in?\u201cYes.\u201dButler Zhao nodded. It was obvious that he did not think that the duke would come back to the residence at this time and felt surprise and then joy. Jiang fourth miss actually met the duke in the main gates. This was a happy thing.Butler Zhao welcomed with quick steps, but he did not dare to get too close. He kept quite the distance where the ominous energy was not that dense. His old bones could not handle that torture.\u201cSir Duke, welcome back to the residence.\u201dThe man wearing a dark purple long gown answered faintly, his gaze on the weak and delicate little girl who dared to meet his eyes. His brows knitted and his voice was cold and sharp as a blade, \u201cWho is she?\u201dOnce these words were spoken, the black clothed man behind him had a stiff expression.He did not think that his master would meet this Jiang fourth miss.He recalled the bold declaration Jiang fourth miss spoke and the black clothed man lowered his head, though his heart silently anticipated that this Jiang fourth miss could be that exception.Butler Zhao was moved. This was the first time the duke asked for the name of a girl.\u201cAnswering the duke, this is Changning Count Residence\u2019s Jiang fourth miss. She received the old madam\u2019s invitation.\u201dJiang fourth miss\u2026..Duke Ding Xie Heng heard this and a trace of surprise flashed in his pair of cold and deep eyes. She was actually his adopted son\u2019s ex-fiancee.He did not think that she would be this bold of a girl.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s pupils moved and she suddenly put the small wine jar to Chun Xi\u2019s hands. She lifted her skirt and moved past Butler Zhao and walked to the front of the man wearing a dark purple long gown. It could be seen that she was not affected by the ominous energy emitting from the man.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s heart was surprised.Jiang Ningbao smiled lightly and greeted Xie Heng with a sweet and mild voice.\u201cChangning Count Residence\u2019s second branch\u2019s Jiang fourth greets the duke!\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s eyes were deep and cold, making one\u2019s heart tremble. His voice was deep and he answered, \u201cEn.\u201dButler Zhao who saw this scene was filled with joy.No wonder Monk Gao said that Jiang fourth miss\u2019 fate was very fitting with the duke\u2019s.This was indeed true.\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of me?\u201d A moment later, Duke Ding Xie Heng suddenly asked with his deep and cold voice that carried a trace of huskiness. His whole body was exuding a domineering momentum.Jiang Ningbao was still indifferent and composed. She lifted her eyes to look at Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s handsome and cold face with shining and dazzling eyes. She curved her mouth. \u201cYou are not a savage beast, why should I be afraid?\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s eyes fell on the smile on her lips.This little lady was indeed not afraid of him.Living for twenty eight years, this was the first time a girl was this close to him. Her body had a faint scent and a trace of strange feeling rose in Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were some who thought of the wild rumors outside and their gazes carried excitement.Maybe the duke\u2019s spring had come.Chun Xi who was holding the small delicate wine jar trembled at the back and her legs were shaking. Duke Ding was so scary. She stood so far yet she still felt uncomfortable. The miss was really valiant, actually able to get so near the duke. She wanted to cry.\u201cDuke, Jiang fourth miss, please enter the residence. Don\u2019t let the old madam waiting.\u201d Butler Zhao did not want to speak at this moment, but he feared that the old madam was waiting anxiously so he could only remind them.\u201cYes!\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng was taking the lead, his gaze was on Jiang Ningbao\u2019s white face that was adorned with blush, letting her walk first. Who knew that Jiang Ningbao smiled as if flowers were blooming instead and said, \u201cDuke, let\u2019s walk together. I want to hear the matter about the battlefield.\u201dAt this time, how could she not make use of time to grow feelings? Duke Ding was not someone to be met at any time. She would grasp this chance.\u2018Reserved\u2019 this kind of thing was not suitable to be put on Duke Ding.Duke Ding Xie Heng: \u201c\u2026..\u201dThe twenty eight years old man who never conversed with any girl before was at a loss, especially since this little lady was not afraid of him, even using a pair of sparkling eyes filled with worship and anticipation to look at him.This let Xie Heng who was used to people not daring to get near him felt something arose in his heart.\u201cAlright!\u201d He nodded unexpectedly.Butler Zhao\u2019s face flashed with a gratified smile. Jiang fourth miss was really amazing. The duke who usually never spoke a lot to women seemed to feel favorable to Jiang fourth miss.Jiang Ningbao heard the duke agree and her eyes lit up. On her delicate white face rose a happy color.She turned her head and walked in front of Chun Xi. With a speechless expression on Chun Xi\u2019s face, she took the wine jar back to her embrace and turned her body back to the side of Duke Ding who was emitting ominous energy. She lifted her small face and looked at Duke Ding\u2019s handsome side face with a brilliant smile, her voice carrying a joyous breath.\u201cDuke, let\u2019s go.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng glanced at the delicate and weak little lady by his side. The little lady had a faint scent that was nice to smell. Duke Ding moved his brows and calmly said, \u201cYes!\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s smile brightened and she deliberately walked side to side with Duke Ding.Duke Ding carried an oppressive and ominous air. Ordinary men could not get near him, but the weak and delicate Jiang Ningbao could adapt to just fine. Her nose smelled the strong masculine scent from Duke Ding. As she heard Duke Ding use his cold and deep voice to dully talk about the matters of the battlefield, her lips could not help but curve upward.After a few steps, Jiang Ningbao realized that Duke Ding consciously pulled the distance between them and her lips curved as she had a sly smile. She hugged the small wine jar and acted as if she subconsciously walked nearer to him and walked shoulder to shoulder.Duke Ding\u2019s steps halted and continued to silently pull their distance.After a few times, Duke Ding Xie Heng could only let this unyielding little lady get near him. His heart was thinking that this little lady was really bold.Jiang Ningbao laughed inside her heart.The tall and straight Duke Ding made Jiang Ningbao look very small, but the atmosphere between the two was very harmonious.One with ominous air all over that made others fear him while the other carried clean air, giving others the impression of light and dark intertwining but not affecting each other.It\u2019s really weird.The bunch of black clothed personal guards all widened their eyes, as if they were seeing something inconceivable.Butler Zhao\u2019s eyes were lit up, as if seeing the scene of the duke and Jiang fourth miss getting married. He could not help but laugh in happiness.As he kept laughing, his heart turned sour.He had waited for this day for a long time and his wait finally bore fruit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She then remembered the word her lady spoke before.\u201cMaybe I and Duke Ding are a match made in heaven.\u201dChun Xi thought, maybe her lady would really get married to Duke Ding, becoming the duchess and let Heir Xie regret. Thinking like this, Chun Xi became happy.She no longer felt that Duke Ding was scary.But she still did not dare to get near. Her lady was indeed fierce, she was not scared of a person like Duke Ding.The land Duke Ding Residence claimed was very big. After walking through the fake mountain and veranda. On the way, the fragrance of flowers was apparent. The servants in the residence were mainly soldiers and a little part was female servants and old female servants. Seeing Duke Ding coming back to the residence, they all greeted him with respect, and then they all stared tongue-tied as the expressionless Duke Ding conversed with the delicate beauty by his side.They wondered who this lady was, actually not fearing the duke.Maybe Duke Ding Residence would soon welcome a new female master.Thinking like this, the gaze the servants used to look at Jiang Ningbao silently carried respect.Duke Ding Xie Heng noticed the change with the servants and his steps slowed and walked shoulder to shoulder with the little lady with no expression.Duke Ding Residence, Thriving Joy HallThe incense in the hall wafted into the air. Aside from old servant Huang, all the servants were instructed to get out.Old Madam Xie whose hair was all white elegantly sat on the purple wingceltis wooden armchair carved with luan bird pattern. She wore a cyan satisfactory dress and her hair was combed neatly. Her pair of eyes were bright and sharp, her whole self seemed spirited.\u201cIs she not here yet?\u201d Old Madam Xie stretched her neck to look at the main door once in a whole and asked anxiously.Old servant Huang shook her head and she infused the teapot with water for the old madam and smiled, \u201cOld madam, the duke and Jiang fourth miss met at the main gate and they are walking here together.\u201d\u201cAccording to Xie Qi, the duke even spoke about the matter of the battlefield to Jiang fourth miss.\u201dOld Madam Xie was moved and could not help but blurt out the secret she kept for the past twenty years, \u201cIt seems that Jiang family\u2019s little lady is really the fated person for my son.\u201dThe high monk once said that only the fated person would not be affected by A\u2019Heng\u2019s ominous air.Old servant Huang widened her eyes and she felt muddled.\u201cFated person?\u201d\u201cAfter A\u2019Heng was born, the high monk in Clear Water Temple sent a paper with the claim that said A\u2019Heng\u2019s ominous energy is too strong and could not live past his prime, but there is a single way out. As long as he met his fated person, then he would be wealthy and high-ranking with children and grandchildren.\u201d\u201cA pity that the high monk went out to travel ten years ago and has not returned. I am not sure if Jiang family\u2019s little lady is my son\u2019s fated person or not. A few days back, I went to Clear Water Temple to invite Monk Gao to read Jiang family\u2019s little lady\u2019s eight characters. Monk Gao said that Jiang family\u2019s eight lady is very special and very matching with my son\u2019s.\u201dOld Madam Xie was crying tears of joy. She had been keeping this secret in her heart for too long. It was so long that with only two years left to her son\u2019s lift, Old Madam Xie was despairing.Now, it was finally extreme adversity in the beginning of luck, dispelling the clouds and seeing the sun.Old servant Huang suddenly realized what was happening.No wonder the old madam placed this much importance on Jiang fourth miss. Before, it was not like there were no women with special destiny who wanted to get married to the duke, but once they got near the duke, their faces turned white and they almost fainted. There was a noble lady who persisted until seven days, but then she got sick in bed and almost died.Old madam\u2019s face became heavier and heavier, even feeling slight despair.And then, she suddenly adopted a relatively old child to be put under the duke\u2019s name which old servant Huang could not understand. Now, she finally understood the reason why the old madam did that.The old madam did not want the nobility the duke fought so hard for to be taken back by the imperial family.At the same time, the successor of the duke residence could not be too small so she chose the smart and good looking oldest son of Xie clan\u2019s second branch.He was not given the official title of heir because the old madam was still bearing hope of the single living chance the high monk said. The old madam was waiting for that single chance.And now, she had finally found it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t know if I have the chance to see my biological grandchild to grow up.\u201d Old Madam Xie was very happy and could not help but felt a little greedy.The main hall was silent.Old servant Huang did not know how she should cheer the old madam up. She could only change the topic carefully and speak of happy things with Old Madam Xie. Around fifteen minutes later, Old Madam Xie had felt better.At this moment, an old servant announced the arrival in front of the door of the main hall.\u201cOld madam, the duke and Jiang fourth miss arrived.\u201dAs the old servant said this, Old Madam Xie sat straight and tidied her dress nervously. She stared at the door of the main hall with eyes carrying worry. Her heart felt a little sour and longing, and there was more of the happiness for meeting her son soon.Hearing Xie Qi\u2019s word, A\u2019Heng\u2019s ominous energy worsened.When Old Madam Xie was thinking randomly , Jiang Ningbao hugged a small delicate wine jar and entered Thriving Joy Hall at the same time as Duke Ding Xie Heng. Chun Xi and Butler Zhao were left outside and did not enter.The man was tall and handsome, the female was delicate and beautiful.They looked like a pair.Old Madam Xie saw the two people entering at the same time and her eyes were lit up, especially when she saw the little lady wearing a light blue dress standing with her son. She revealed a happy smile.After Duke Ding Xie Heng entered the main hall and went to the center, he stopped and did not walk forward. He gazed that the white haired Old Madam Xie from afar and his heart felt stifled. He subconsciously rubbed the buddhist bracelet he wore and he did his best to restrain the ominous energy.Especially the thick ominous air stored in his pair of eyes.Xie Heng did not dare to get near his mother, afraid that his ominous air would make it difficult for his mother.Old Madam Xie was old. That year when she gave birth to Xie Heng, she was wounded and was always sickly. She looked older than the old noble madams her age.\u201cMother!\u201d Duke Ding Xie Heng moved his lips and stared deeply at Old Madam Xie then lowered his eyes and spoke the word with much difficulty.Old Madam Xie saw that her son was standing that far from her and did not dare to look at her. She knew that her son was afraid of wounding her and her heart felt sour. Her pair of eyes greedily took in her son and there was a layer of tears glistening her eyes.As a mother, how could she be afraid of her own son?\u201cA\u2019Heng, you\u2026..are you well?\u201dXie Heng pulled the corners of his mouth, wanting to smile, but he realized that he could not so he hoarsely answered, \u201cSon is alright, letting mother be worried.\u201d\u201cAs long as you\u2019re alright, mother is happy,\u201d Old Madam Xie saw her son like this and her heart was stifled, but she still squeezed out a happy smile.A\u2019Heng\u2019s condition, Xie Qi would report once in a while. Old Madam Xie was clear on it and she understood the reason her son did not dare to go back to the residence.He did not even dare to go back to his own home.Old Madam Xie shed tears. The more she thought about it, the more the heartache. At last, she could not help but cry as old servant Huang tried to appease her on the side.Duke Ding Xie Heng saw his mother crying and he wanted to go up and comfort his mother, but knowing his condition, he only gripped his fists and his thin lips were pursed into a line, not daring to go nearer.Seeing this scene silently, Jiang Ningbao felt sour and sad.So Duke Ding also had such a weak side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She looked at the little lady who stood there silently with warmth.\u201cThis must be Changning Count Residence\u2019s fourth lady, right?\u201dJiang family\u2019s fourth miss was as the rumor said to be beautiful and the way she carried herself was very good.Old Madam Xie nodded in satisfaction.Old servant Huang at the side also had a very good impression on Jiang Ningbao.This Jiang fourth miss was the duke\u2019s fated person. Later, the duke would need her help to get past thirty.Jiang Ningbao smiled and hugged the small wine jar as she stepped forward. She saluted to Old Madam Xie, \u201cNingbao greets the old madam.\u201dOld Madam Xie saw that not only Jiang Ningbao had delicate features, her eyes were also clear and she conducted herself magnanimously with no fakeness.

She added with a trace of embarrassment.\u201cI heard that a few years ago, Sir Duke was wounded. This medicinal wine can also heal hidden wounds and recuperate the body.\u201dOld Madam Xie was at first curious what was inside the earthen jar. Hearing that it was the medicinal wine the little lady made herself and glancing at the movement of her son, her eyes flashed with laughter.Her son was cold, like a piece of wood. It was good that Jiang family\u2019s little lady took the initiative.Old Madam Xie smiled as she let old servant Huang to receive the small earthen jar, \u201cNingbao girl is considerate. Hearing you, I do want to taste how good this medicinal wine is.\u201dAfter that, Old Madam Xie turned to her son and smiled in teasing, \u201cA\u2019Heng, you see how considerate the little lady is toward you?\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng: \u201c\u2026..\u201dOld Madam Xie did not expect her cold son to respond.

Seeing her mother and the little lady conversing happily, faces carrying smiles, the usually cold heart of his felt a trace of warmth.But once he thought of the act of his adopted son forcing his mother to agree to annul the engagement, Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s eyes could not help but have a trace of ominous air emerging.\u201cAlright alright. Old servant Huang, have you heard Ningbao girl\u2019s words?\u201d Old Madam Xie turned to look at old servant Huang. Thinking that this little lady would be her daughter-in-law, she could not hold in her smile.Old servant Huang nodded with a face full of smiles, \u201cThe servant will open the jar.\u201d As she spoke, she only used a little strength to open the lid of the jar. A burst of warmth and medicinal scent and wine scent spread out from the little jar.Only the scent diffused out, the people smelling it felt their body turned at ease.Old Madam Xie sighed in surprise, \u201cSmelling this medicinal wine smell, I feel that my body turns lighter. I can\u2019t wait to drink a large mouthful of the medicinal wine to try the effects.\u201d\u201cOld madam, this medicinal wine can only be drunk in a small cup every time.\u201d Jiang Ningbao said with a soft voice at the side. Her heart was moved by Old Madam Xie\u2019s trust.\u2018Medicinal wine\u2019 this kind of thing, most people would first find doctors to check before drinking and they won\u2019t drink at the spot.But Old Madam Xie did this.Jiang Ningabao did not know that Duke Ding Xie Heng and Old Madam Xie had long known that she was the master behind Jinjiang Teahouse and they knew that she was good at brewing wines. Hearing that this was the wine she brewed herself, they were filled with anticipation.Old servant Huang took out the lid and cloth, a denser smell of the wine burst.Old Madam Xie took a deep breath of the medicinal wine smell.\u201cQuick, pour me the wine.\u201dOld servant Huang smiled, \u201cOld madam, don\u2019t be anxious. This servant is pouring you the wine.\u201d As she spoke, she cleaned her hand in the bronze bowl and dried her hands, then she took out three clean white small cups from the tea set and poured three glasses of medicinal wine.The medicinal wine was clear and translucent, faintly yellow. The smell of the medicinal wine and the density made the people revel in it and their bodies became more at ease.\u201cNingbao girl, why don\u2019t you take a cup to give to A\u2019Heng so he can taste it?\u201d Old Madam Xie pointed to one of the cups on the tray and did not forget to make opportunities for Jiang Ningbao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She raised the cup of medicinal wine and turned to walk toward Duke Ding Xie Heng. She smiled as she glanced at this cold and handsome face, her voice was clear, melodious, and sweet, \u201cSir Duke, please have a taste.\u201dAfter saying this, she offered the medicinal wine with both hands.One of her hands wore a red ruby bracelet that was eye-catching, capturing one\u2019s gaze to stop at her pair of white and soft hands.Duke Ding Xie Heng averted his gaze a little and received the cup of medicinal wine. He spoke with a faint voice.\u201cThank you!\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s mouth curved upwards. She went back to take her own cup of medicinal wine to taste and her gaze fell on Duke Ding Xie Heng every once in a while.The more she looked, the most he suited her taste.Duke Ding Xie Heng gulped down the small cup of medicinal wine without hesitation.Once the medicinal wine entered his stomach, he immediately felt a subtle force of heat circulating in his body, it carried a little pain. Once the heat passed, the pain disappeared. Big and small, also hidden, injuries were repaired one by one.Especially his stomach. In the early years he went to the battlefield, he was shot by a poisonous arrow in his negligence. In the end, he lived on, but he did not get rid of it completely. Now, just a small cup of medicinal wine let him feel the light of curing it.In Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s eyes brimming with ominous energy, a trace of shock flashed by.At the same time, Old Madam Xie had drunk the small cup of medicinal wine and she looked as if she became ten years younger.For more than twenty years, Old Madam Xie was always riddled with sickness. As she aged, her eyes also turned blurry. Now, she noticed that after drinking the medicinal wine, her whole body was warm and very comfortable. Her eyesight actually recovered to the time when she was still young. Seeing things won\u2019t be like there was a screen between.\u201cThis medicinal wine is very mystical! I have the feeling that the heaviness drifted away and I obtained a new life. I can even see the little bird perched on the big tree outside.\u201dOld Madam Xie exclaimed in agitation.Hearing the old madam\u2019s words, old servant Huang\u2019s eyes widened. She also noticed Old Madam Xie\u2019s changes. It seemed that the small jar of medicinal wine Jiang fourth miss gave was very precious. Old servant Huang immediately closed the wine jar carefully.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s lips pursed into a smile. The medicinal wine was obviously mystical. When she was brewing it, she specially gave the wine the attribute of erasing the body\u2019s hidden threats.\u201cThe medicinal wine Ningbao girl brew is very mystical. Upper Cloud Wine Shop\u2019s sky high priced wine is lackluster compared to this.\u201d\u201cA\u2019Heng, what do you say?\u201dWhen Old Madam Xie was praising Jiang Ningbao, she did not forget to mention her ice block son who could not earn the favor of the little lady.Jiang Ningbao knew what the old madam meant and her mouth lifted into a brilliant smile. Her whole self exuded unparalleled soft beauty, capturing others\u2019 gazes.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s expression did not change in the least and he concise and comprehensive.\u201cThe medicinal wine is very good.\u201d\u201cAs long as the old madam likes it. I will send a few more jars of health preserving medicinal wine later on.\u201d Jiang Ningbao\u2019s mind thought of Upper Cloud Wine Store\u2019s information and smiled with her eyes shining.Few people in the capital knew that the secret owner of Upper Cloud Wine Store was the female lead Yang Shuqing. Yang Shuqing relied on her knowledge of the future and gtot the ancient wine brewing receipt that \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 got in her previous life.Ancient wine making\u2019s sky high priced wines were all health preserving wines.The effects were astonishing.Yang Shuqing relied on the sky high priced wines to rope in a lot of backing. It could be said that this ancient wine receipt was the female lead\u2019s important cheat.Although Old Madam Xie was moved by this offer, she did not want to cheat off this little lady.\u201cNingbao girl, how about I pay you according to Upper Cloud Wine Store\u2019s sky high priced wine with additional thirty percent to you?\u201d\u201cAdd forty percent.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng suddenly spoke coldly.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyebrow jumped. \u201c\u2026..\u201dThis one was worse, as if money was something blown over by the wind.Old Madam Xie nodded in agreement, \u201cA\u2019Heng says forty percent, then it\u2019s forty percent. This medicinal wine is worth it!\u201d\u201cOld madam, no need that much. The ingredients for this medicinal wine are not that expensive.\u201d What\u2019s precious was the mystical wine brewing ability she brought with her, giving the medicinal wine this kind of mystical attribute.Upper Cloud Wine Store\u2019s sky high priced wine was worth a lot of gold. Adding forty percent to this price was a sum that would make one\u2019s head dizzy. Jiang Ningbao did not think of earning money from Old Madam Xie.The two people wanted to give more money, but one disagreed.Both parties were not willing to step back.Seeing this scene, old servant Huang was speechless and she felt a little urge to laugh.In the end, Jiang Ningbao smiled helplessly, \u201cOld Madam, Sir Duke, I really do not need that much. If you want to give money, then just give five hundred silver taels.\u201dThe production cost of her medicinal wine was really low, only more or less using the ordinary brewing method. It was not like Upper Cloud Wine Store\u2019s high priced wines that had complicated brewing procedures and needed a lot of precious herbs.It was only a few jars of medicinal wines. Jiang Ningbao really did not mind it.But she could not send it for free even if she wanted to.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her heart silently decided that she would use another way to compensate Jiang Ningbao.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s heart also thought this way.At this time, he thought of the purpose of his return to the residence and the air around became cold, \u201cMother, where is Xie Jingyi?\u201dOld Madam Xie choked and could not help but glared at this worrisome son. He actually mentioned the little lady\u2019s ex-fiance in front of her!Jiang Ningbao had no feeling when she heard Duke Ding Xie Heng asked where her ex-fiance went. She only lifted her brow and a flash of curiosity went through her eyes.Xie Jingyi was not in the residence. If not, when his adopted father came back, it won\u2019t be possible that he as the adopted son would not appear until now.\u201cHe went to Anyuan Marquis Residence to propose early in the morning.\u201dWhen Old Madam Xie talked about this adopted grandson, her gaze carried a trace of coldness.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s handsome face became gloomy and his ominous energy spread in all directions. The few people in the main hall felt a sudden oppressing force. Fortunately, this oppressive force disappeared after a short moment.\u201cI disagree!\u201dJiang Ningbao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dAs Xie Jingyi\u2019s adopted father, Duke Ding indeed had the right to disagree.But the person had gone to propose early in the morning. Around this time, they should have already exchanged horoscope cards. Even if Duke Ding disagreed, this matter was settled.\u201cA\u2019Heng, why do you disagree?\u201dOld Madam Xie looked at her son in surprise.Although she was a little disheartened by this adopted grandson, she still hoped that he would be fine. Since he liked Anyuan Marquis Residence\u2019s oldest legal daughter, then Old Madam Xie won\u2019t oppose.As long as it was not Jiang family\u2019s little lady.Jiang family\u2019s little lady was the daughter-in-law she had decided on.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s expression was cold and hard. His gaze swept through Jiang Ningbao\u2019s face and her eyebrow moved.Old Madam Xie who had good sight noticed this and she realized something. So it was because of Jiang family\u2019s little lady. She smiled as she asked, \u201cA\u2019Heng, are you worried about Ningbao girl?\u201dOld servant Huang who heard this also smiled.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s expressions did not change, only silently confirming Old Madam Xie\u2019s guess.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s pair of eyes were overwhelmed with gleaming reflection of sunlight. Her mouth was curved into a soft and beautiful smile as she said with intention, \u201cSir Duke, actually, the heir having another person he likes, I am happy.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s gaze was cast to the little lady and their eyes met.The little lady\u2019s pair of eyes were clear and clean. There was not a single trace of other feelings. His voice was cold and hoarse as he asked, \u201cDon\u2019t like?\u201d\u201cYes, don\u2019t like. In the beginning, I and the heir were engaged because of the debt of gratitude and bound the two families together. These past few years, I and the heir have only met a few times, there are no deep feelings to speak of.\u201dEspecially when this heir was one who bit the hand who fed him.\u201cI am fine with the heir sending Butler Zhao to annul the engagement, I\u2019m just not resigned to have to give my spot to others and have my reputation ruined.\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes met Duke Ding\u2019s eyes that were brimming with ominous air as she spoke in a frank and sincere way.Old Madam Xie had known that Jiang family\u2019s little lady did not have any feelings toward her adopted grandson. Seeing her coming out clean like this made her heart happy.Her adopted son\u2019s action indeed made one\u2019s heart go cold.In the beginning, Old Madam Xie did not agree to him annulling the engagement. The solution was not only that, but her adopted grandson chose the cruelest method.\u2013Annulling the engagement.Engagement annulment was too cruel to females, especially when the female was innocent. But her adopted grandson was determined to annul it, even kneeling in front of Thriving Joy Hall for one day one night. His biological parents even came to plead. Old Madam Xie was forced to nod in helplessness.She even regretted choosing Xie Jingyi to be adopted.Duke Ding Xie Heng did not think that the little lady would be this indifferent. The cold air was frozen. Xie Heng who wanted to back her up went silent.But what should be accounted for, he would count it clearly.\u201cBut, I told the heir that I want to be a family with all of you.\u201d Jiang Ningbao smiled naughtily. Her pair of beautiful eyes stared fixedly at Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s cold and hard handsome face as she spoke meaningfully.When Old Madam Xie heard Jiang family\u2019s little lady\u2019s words, she snapped back and could not help but laugh.Jiang family\u2019s little lady was really\u2026..really not conservative, but she liked it.Her son\u2019s head was made of wood, so she could only rely on her daughter-in-law to make the move.Old Madam Xie suddenly anticipated the life they had after marriage. With Jiang family\u2019s little lady, her son\u2019s daily life won\u2019t be so boring.Duke Ding Xie Heng unexpectedly said a sentence, \u201cYou want to be my daughter?\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The white sandalwood inside the incense burner lingered, fine and continuous white vapour rose.You want to become my daughter\u2026..Hearing these words, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s smile stiffened and astonishment flashed across her delicate and beautiful face. It was as if she was splashed with a basin of cold water, cold from head to toe.This unenlightened wood head.No, saying he\u2019s a wooden head was praising him too high. In Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes, Duke Ding was a piece of rotten tree, a hopeless case.She was already this obvious, even deliberately gave Duke Ding flirty eyes. Could it be that her flirting skills were too poor?Jiang Ningbao contemplated in her heart seriously.The difference between theory and reality was like a natural moat.In the future, she must be more diligent around Duke Ding. She must enlighten this piece of rotten wood!The more Jiang Ningbao was defeated, the more she was brave.Becoming the daughter\u2026..was non-existent! Her objective was to be his wife!After getting married to him\u2026..Hmph! Hmph!Old Madam Xie who was imagining the days of her son and Jiang family\u2019s little lady after marriage choked and the hand that held the teacup trembled as the tea water in the teacup splashed a few drops out.She stared at her tall and handsome son. Her son who made her proud had never let her be this vexed.\u201cCough, cough. A\u2019Heng, actually, there is another way for us to be a family.\u201dLike being your wife.Old Madam Xie specially glanced at the calm and confident Jiang family\u2019s little lady as she reminded her.Her son was too much of a wooden head, she who was his mother had to squeeze ideas out of her mind.Duke Ding Xie Heng knitted his brows, his gaze fell on the little lady\u2019s white and clean little face. The spot between his brows twisted a little and his voice carried confusion, \u201cIs being Duke Ding Residence\u2019s oldest miss not good?\u201dOld servant Huang was speechless and her mouth twitched. She suddenly pitied Jiang family\u2019s little miss. How determined was Sir Duke to make Jiang fourth miss to be his daughter?Jiang Ningbao went silent for a moment. She remembered that Duke Ding rarely went into the capital, always staying in the large barracks in Western Suburbs. She and Heir Xie\u2019s engagement annulment and her declaration of getting married to Duke Ding was only a few days ago.Her heart suddenly had an inconceivable guess. Her pair of beautiful eyes stared at Duke Ding\u2019s handsome face and her mouth curved into a sly smile.\u201cSir Duke, have you heard of the rumors that are currently wild in the capital?\u201dDuke Ding looked at the little lady in bewilderment for suddenly mentioning this, but his hard and cold face softened. He shook his head and said, \u201cNever heard of it.\u201dNow, both Old Madam Xie and Jiang Ningbao released a breath, but they were all speechless.Doing this and that for half a day, the main character actually did not know of this.\u201cCough, cough. A\u2019Heng, the rumors that are currently wild in the capital have a big relation to you.\u201d Old Madam Xie sipped her tea to suppress the shock. She said this with her eyes filled with slyness.Duke Ding Xie Heng became stiff after being stared at by his mother. His lips were pursed into a line and her brows were colder by a few degrees, \u201cWhat relation?\u201d\u201cOld madam, it is better if I\u2019m the one who tells this part.\u201d Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes were shining as she spoke warmly. A beautiful and moving smile appeared on her delicate white face.Old Madam Xie smiled as she glanced at her wooden head son. She nodded with a tacit understanding, \u201cYes, it is suitable that Ningbao girl speaks of it.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s heart had a trace of subtle feelings..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She told him the beginning of the matter to the end. Her eyes were staring at Duke Ding\u2019s expression.\u201cSo, I\u2019m not interested in being your daughter, I only want to be your wife.\u201d After Jiang Ningbao finished speaking, she confessed directly in front of them with a blush decorating her face.In her previous life, she died single. This life, she decided to brave herself to chase after her husband.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart was itching.Old servant Huang\u2019s eye twitched. Jiang family\u2019s little lady seemed weak and delicate, but her actions and bearing were decisive. One truly could not judge a book by its cover.Old Madam Xie almost choked on her own saliva. Jiang family\u2019s little lady was very fierce. She actually\u2026..actually said that she wanted to be A\u2019Heng\u2019s wife in front of her!But her heart could not help but praise \u2018good\u2019!\u201cA\u2019Heng, Ningbao girl is a good girl. She\u2019s not afraid of your ominous energy. Why don\u2019t you consider it?\u201d Old Madam Xie coughed lightly and helped Jiang Ningbao speak.This little lady actually wanted to be his wife\u2026..his mother even helped her from the side.Duke Ding Xie Heng who was confessed to all of a sudden stood stiff. His expressionless face almost broke. His gaze could not help but find the little lady and Jiang Ningbao whose gaze was on Duke Ding subconsciously let out a brilliant smile to him.\u201cSir Duke, why don\u2019t I become your wife?\u201d her soft voice carried a trace of coquettish taste.\u201c\u2026..\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s cold and handsome face did not reveal any emotion, but his mind was blank. His heart was jumping fast as if it wanted to leap out of his body.His heartstrings were stretched taut. He warned himself that this little lady was only muddled and pretended to be calm as he averted his gaze. His heart had a feeling of wanting to escape, but his feet seemed as if it was nailed on the ground and could not move.The main hall was a piece of silence.Old Madam Xie waited for her son\u2019s answer in interest.Not receiving any answer for a long time, Old Madam Xie\u2019s heart was worried and anxious. She could not help but put oil to the fire, \u201cA\u2019Heng, can it be that you mind the fact that Ningbao girl used to be Jingyi\u2019s fiance?\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng pursed his lips and shook his head subconsciously. His voice was deep and throaty as he said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen what misgiving do you have?\u201dOld Madam Xie kept on asking.Duke Ding Xie Heng averted his gaze and spoke, \u201cWe\u2019re not suitable.\u201d Once these words were out, his heart felt loss as if there was something suffocating it.That\u2019s right. Not suitable.He\u2019s twelve generations older than the little lady. His age was old enough to be her father.He\u2026..He did not want the little lady to feel regret in the future.Old Madam Xie\u2019s heart was half-cold. Her son was really worrisome. She, as his mother, was extremely anxious for him.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s gaze was always on Duke Ding\u2019s handsome face and did not miss any expression he had. Her heart was secretly laughing. This fierce Duke Ding was really a noob on the matters of feelings. Old Madam Xie\u2019s rapid questions would only make this wooden block hide back to its shell.It\u2019s her turn to enter the stage.Jiang Ningbao continued to put out the big gun.\u201cSir Duke, the rumors outside have spread that I spoke that I will get married to you. So if I can\u2019t get married to you, I can only be a nun.\u201dSaying this, her pair of pitiful eyes glanced at Duke Ding Xie Heng, having wronged and pitiful tears.Jiang Ningbao was a beautiful and tender person, giving others the impression of pity. Now that she acted pitiful, she seemed even more weak and easy to bully, making one\u2019s heart could not bear it and wanted to pull her into one\u2019s embrace to give consolation.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s breath hitched and his heart felt as if it was lightly bumped, rising to ripples. His pair of lips moved and his throat rolled.\u201cDon\u2019t be a nun, I\u2019ll marry you!\u201dOnce he spoke these, Duke Ding Xie Heng felt as if things came to their proper settlement, as if he had released a huge burden. There was no discomfort. He ignored the strange feeling in his heart and only blamed that he did not consider enough and almost forced the little lady to be a nun.The little lady had her reputation harmed because of his adopted son and impulsively said that she wanted to get married to him and this was spread all around wildly. Now, there was only the option of marriage.If he did not marry her, this little lady\u2019s life would be ruined.He had to be responsible.Duke Ding Xie Heng found a reason for himself in his heart.Jiang Ningbao widened her eyes. Happiness came too fast. She was almost hit silly by this happy news.\u201cYou sure?\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng was silent for a while and spoke. \u201cI will take responsibility.\u201dJiang Ningbao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although she used some methods, it was alright as long as Duke Ding agreed to marry her. Marrying first before love was not made. Love at first sight was too uncertain and momentary. Jiang Ningbao preferred feelings that grew with time.This kind of feeling would last longer.Jiang Ningbao curved her mouth in happiness and it showed in her brows. Her whole body exuded joy and she grasped the chance to ask.\u201cSo, when will we get married?\u201dOld Madam Xie finally got her son\u2019s answer and could not help but reveal a moved smile. Hearing Jiang family\u2019s little lady asked, she also asked in anticipation.\u201cA\u2019Heng, if you have no objection, then I will go to Clear Water Temple tomorrow to ask for a good day to get married. And then, I will ask for the marriage decree from the palace.\u201dJiang family\u2019s little lady was this good. If she did not hurry and settle this for her son, Old Madam Xie would not be able to sleep in peace.Asking for a marriage decree and going to the Clear Water Temple to ask for a marriage date. This emphasized the importance Old Madam Xie placed on Jiang Ningbao.Jiang Ningbao was surprised and moved.Duke Ding Xie Heng saw the happy little lady and his heart beat faster. The coldness in his eyes disappeared, \u201cOkay.\u201dThe two people\u2019s marriage was settled on their first time meeting.Although it was only oral, after getting the marriage decree, the betrothal gifts would not be less. This was her son\u2019s only wife in this lifetime. Old Madam Xie placed great importance on it.At noon, Old Madam Xie asked Jiang Ningbao to stay for lunch. They ate lunch happily and when she left, Old Madam Xie gave Jiang Ningbao a set of jewellery and she told her son to send her back with a face full of smiles.Her final objective was to let people know that her son was now a flower with an owner.She believed that Jiang family\u2019s little lady would grasp this chance.One midday, every person in Duke Ding Residence knew that the beautiful girl standing beside the duke\u2019s side was the heir\u2019s ex-fiance, Jiang fourth miss.According to Butler Zhao\u2019s leak, old madam already let out the words that Jiang fourth miss would be the future mistress of Duke Ding Residence.This time, everyone in Duke Ding Residence was shocked and they all breathed in cold air.Future mistress.That won\u2019t that mean Jiang fourth miss would get married to the duke?Only the black clothed personal guards Duke Ding carried back were calm. They already had the premonition at the gates of the residence. The old madam said that only made the premonition true.Jiang fourth miss was from Changning Count Residence. She\u2019s beautiful with good bearings. She was suitable with the duke.Maybe some discussed how Jiang fourth miss was the heir\u2019s ex-fiance in private and could not measure up to the duke, but the two already annulled the engagement so their marriage partner was none of their business. Having another engagement was normal.In the hearts of the black clothed guards, the duke was their real master. Now that his marriage was settled, they were happy for him.Why would they mind those kinds of traditional rules?There were many people in the big Duke Ding Residence. They were mostly divided into people who were loyal to the duke and the ones loyal to the heir. Once this news was out, some were happy and some were anxious.Heir Xie was Duke Ding Residence\u2019s only successor. The people who sucked up to him and were loyal to him were plenty. A few days earlier, they heard the Jiang fourth miss who had her engagement annulled by the heir spoke that she wanted to get married to the duke. They were indifferent to this.Girls who wanted to get married to Duke Ding were plenty, but they all failed.But it was different now.Jiang fourth miss was the daughter-in-law she decided on. They only needed to give the betrothal gifts and the marriage certificate.On this day, Heir Xie\u2019s engagement was settled, so was the duke\u2019s engagement.After Jiang fourth miss married into the duke residence and gave birth to the duke\u2019s children, how would there be a place for the heir?But at this moment, Heir Xie went to Anyuan Marquis Residence to propose. The servants loyal to the heir could only bear it in as they looked at the others being happy with stiff and forced smiles.Heir Xie who was thought of by the servants came back with his brand new fiance, Yang Shuqing to greet Old Madam Xie.Coincidentally, to give a good impression on Old Madam Xie, Yang Shuqing and Jiang Ningbao both chose to present precious wine on that day.One was personally brewed while the other was Upper Cloud Wine Shop\u2019s sky high priced health preserving wine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gentle breeze flew, making people comfortable.Jiang Ningbao was walking to the gates with Duke Ding Xie Heng. Her heart was happy and her feet were light. Her brows carried a smile like a blooming flower spreading intoxicating scent.Duke Ding Xie Heng, this cold and pure man with firm temperament, warned himself again that he agreed to marry the little lady because of responsibility. But once he thought that the little lady by his side would soon be his little wife, his heart rose to strange ripples.The two walked shoulder to shoulder and the air between them were harmonious.The man was tall and handsome, the girl was delicate, small, and beautiful. The two airs of supreme manly coldness and supreme soft and warmth were shown on their bodies vividly and incisively.The servants in the residence stealthily glanced at the future mistress of the duke residence with eyes carrying happiness and respect. Only those who were loyal to Heir Xie were left with complicated emotions.Actually, Jiang fourth miss was really good. Warm, beautiful, and had special air.Why would the heir annul the engagement?Maybe Anyuan Marquis Residence\u2019s oldest miss was more charming?\u201cSir duke, what do you like to do in your spare time?\u201d Jiang Ningbao\u2019s lips carried a smile as she asked softly, wanting to know more about Duke Ding\u2019s habits and hobby.\u201cCopying the Buddhist Scripture?\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s steps halted and answered with doubt. His voice was cold and deep as always.Jiang Ningbao was stunned. She did not think that Duke Ding would copy Buddhist Scriptures in his spare time. Then she thought that aside from relying on the Buddhist beads to suppress his ominous energy, chanting the scripture or copying the sutra could make the heart calmer and stabilize the ominous energy.Her gaze fell on the purple wooden Buddhist bracelet on Duke Ding\u2019s wrist. Her mind could not help imagining Duke Ding who was overflowing with ominous energy sat straight on the chair and seriously copying the Buddhist scripture.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s mind swayed and her heart felt as if something struck it as it jumped \u2018thump, thump\u2019.Duke Ding Xie Heng noticed the abnormality on the little lady and he stopped his footsteps as he stared at her. His cold and deep voice carried concern.\u201cAre you alright?\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s face blushed. She actually thought of strange things in front of the duke. She immediately shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Sir duke, can you send me a Buddhist scripture you copied?\u201d Saying this, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s pair of beautiful eyes stared fixedly at Duke Ding with anticipation.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s eyes carried hesitation. The Buddhist scripture he copied carried a bit of his ominous energy, but once he thought that the little lady was not affected by it, he nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201dAs he said this, he ordered a black clothed personal guard and the guard left quietly. Less than fifteen minutes laters, the black clothed personal guard came back with <Vajracchedika-sutra> Duke Ding personally copied.Duke Ding Xie Heng saw this <Vajracchedika-sutra>. It was the sutra he copied five years ago. He was dazed for a second and gave it to the little lady.\u201cThe sutra you want.\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s mouth curved and took the sutra from his hand. She opened it with anticipation and was surprised.The words on the Buddhist scripture were bold and sturdy, vigorous and powerful with sharpness, pressing momentum and ominous energy.The words were like the writer.Duke Ding\u2019s strong and vigorous words that exposed the strength of character made Jiang Ningbao filled with praise.But this sutra, making this sutra having this kind of ominous energy, only Duke Ding could do it.Jiang Ningbao sighed in her heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sutra he copied having ominous energy was not intentional.Maybe copying the scripture really could lessen his ominous energy.The Buddha was benevolent, delivering all living creatures from torment.Seeing the little lady opening the sutra, Duke Ding who was stable as a mountain could not help but look at her beautiful and delicate side face, his heart rose with a sliver of nervousness.This was an unprecedented matter.Duke Ding\u2019s heart was startled.Jiang Ningbao closed the <Vajracchedika-sutra> and decided to look at it after she came back. She put it in a casket and smiled beautifully at Duke Ding, \u201cThe sutra is very good. I like it very much.\u201dDuke Ding recovered his calmness, as if the previous nervousness was just his imagination, and replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI am good at brewing wine and I\u2019ve brewed a lot the past few years. I will send you a few jars tomorrow. This is my thank you gift, you can\u2019t refuse it.\u201d Jiang Ningbao smiled as she looked at Duke Ding. She waved the sutra in her hand and spoke with a light and fast tone.\u201cAlright.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng nodded hesitantly.Jiang Ningbao was happy. She specially used a little scheme. First, she would send some wines, and then she would integrate into his life, making Duke Ding used to her existence.\u201cSir duke, do the booklet you write also have ominous energy?\u201d Jiang Ningbao asked in curiosity.\u201cNo, the sutra is an exception.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng slowed his steps and answered.When copying the sutra, he won\u2019t suppress his ominous energy. Hence, the sutra would be tainted with it. The <Vajracchedika-sutra> he sent the little lady was written five years ago, so the ominous energy had lessened a lot.But others still could not get near and read it.Especially females. They were easy to be attacked by the ominous energy.\u201cI see. Sir duke, what do you usually do aside from copying sutra?\u201d Jiang Ningbao put the sutra in her sleeve and continued asking about his life and habits with interest.\u201cPracticing martial arts.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s steps walked forward steadily as he replied.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cCan one get internal energy?\u201d During the apocalypse, she who had no ability could only practice the ancient martial arts in various large bases publicized.It\u2019s a pity that after transmigrating, with her parents pampering her and the servants having more than ten, she could not practice martial arts in secret. She could only practice her skill of brewing wine. Don\u2019t look that her appearance was weak and soft, seemingly would fall just by being blown by the wind, she actually could defeat seven to eight muscly men with empty hands.If it weren\u2019t for when she was seven years old and her hand was itching, using a whip to fall down a big tree and shocking her parents, her mother won\u2019t stare down at her as she learned the etiquette noble ladies should learn.Jiang Ningbao sobbed in her heart incessantly.\u201cThe ones with excellent natural endowment can.\u201dDuke Ding answered faintly.Jiang Ningbao silently thought that all of the martial arts officers in the Dayue Dynasty practiced martial arts. But hearing the duke, not everyone could use internal energy. This was different from the ancient martial arts she knew. Going silent for a moment, Jiang Ningbao sounded out, \u201cSir duke, what do you think of a girl practicing martial arts?\u201dIn ancient times, most men hoped that their wife was chaste, calm, and virtuous while their concubine was gentle and dependent.But the lioness from the martial families was not few.Actually, Jiang Ningbao did not want to be one of them who grew up in the house. She preferred to dress in fine clothes and ride on well-groomed horses, living life as she liked it. But Madam Yang who was from a literary family hoped that she would become a gentle, chaste, and virtuous noble lady. After marriage, become the heiress people praised.Duke Ding halted his steps and calmly stared at her tender and beautiful features.\u201cYou want to practice martial arts?\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes flashed with surprise. She did not think that Duke Ding would think that she wanted to practice martial arts. She struck when the iron was hot, her pink lips moved upward.\u201cCan I?\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s gaze settled on her tender and beautiful face for a moment and thought to the matter of King Rui Residence\u2019s little king blocking her in the streets, then nodded, \u201cYou can.\u201dThe little lady was born with a beautiful appearance. If she met with danger, she would have the skill to defend herself.\u201cSir duke, I will be in your care.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She\u2019s indeed smart, giving herself a chance to grow feelings.Duke Ding Xie Heng nodded.\u201cSir duke, from when I was little, I have the ability to give wondrous effects to the wines I brew using ordinary methods. You have to keep this a secret for me.\u201d Jiang Ningbao lowered her voice and spoke softly.Today, she sent an earthen jug to Old Madam Xie. She had already prepared to be exposed.\u201cOkay.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s pupil contracted. A trace of his emotions flashed across the ominous energy in his eyes. His cold and hard face subconsciously softened.\u201cThe flower wines in Jinjiang Teahouse are also brewed by me, but these wines are given more water. It cannot be compared with Upper Cloud Wine Shop\u2019s sky high priced wine.\u201dJiang Ningbao said as she smiled.\u201cI know.\u201d Duke Ding Xie Heng answered faintly.Jiang Ningbao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dThe two walked shoulder to shoulder forward. Maybe it was because of the ominous energy lingering around Duke Ding, only Jiang Ningbao was talking with Duke Ding with a flowery smile.The servants in Duke Ding Residence looked at Jiang Ningbao with respectful gazes.No wonder the old madam said that Jiang fourth miss would be the future mistress of the duke residence. Only Jiang fourth miss could get near Duke Ding this easily.Hence, Jiang fourth miss was special.Chun Xi carried a delicate casket and followed behind them. She did not dare to get near. Once she was near, she would be like a fish out of water, hard to breathe.Butler Zhao at the side saw Chun Xi\u2019s white face and smiled, \u201cIf you\u2019re not feeling well, we can be further apart. The duke won\u2019t mind.\u201dChun Xi flushed in embarrassment.\u201cThank you, Butler Zhao.\u201dButler Zhao slowed his steps and pulled the distance from Duke Ding. Chun Xi\u2019s face finally turned better.No matter how long the road was, there would be an end to it. Jiang Ningbao looked at the large gates and sighed in her heart. After she went into the carriage, she could not converse with Duke Ding this close anymore.Maybe it was because Jiang Ningbao\u2019s complaint was too big, when she and Duke Ding Xie Heng stepped out of the gates, Heir Xie who went to Anyuan Marquis Residence coincidentally came back at this time.She saw the noisy guards, especially the one leading them, the man riding on a horse galloping nearer wearing a set of dark red brocade robes weaved with silver threads.And the familiar looking carriage on his side.Jiang Ningbao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dWhat kind of karma was this? She actually met her ex-fiance and the female lead Yang Shuqing in front of the gates of Duke Ding Residence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She looked frail and beautiful.At this moment, he was standing next to a handsome man emitting sharp and ominous energy. Under the sunlight, the two of them looked like a pair of jade.Heir Xie never thought that once he arrived in the residence, he would see the scene of his ex-fiance and his adopted father standing next to each other and looking harmonious.The bottom of Heir Xie\u2019s eyes flashed with shock and bewilderment. His mind recalled the scene where his ex-fiance declared that she would get married to Duke Ding. His heart rose with a disbelieving taste.A moment later, he slowly got down the horse. He went down on a spot not far from the main gates. He patted his gown lightly and greeted Duke Ding respectfully.\u201cGreeting father.\u201dJiang Ningbao heard Heir Xie called Duke Ding \u2018father\u2019 respectfully and her gaze could not help but sweep through the two of them. One had a domineering attitude and was handsome and strong while the other was cool, handsome, and noble.They were both excellent and were not mundane. They were also young.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart unknowingly felt happy.The two of them were nine years apart. Ancient people matured early, but they also became a father after more than ten years. Seeing this pair of father and son, she really wanted to ask Old Madam Xie why she chose Xie Jingyi to be adopted at that time.Could she not adopt a two to three years old child?But once she thought back to the book revealing that Duke Ding died in his prime and the male lead inherited the position of duke, Jiang Ningbao could not help but suspect that there was a secret others did not know about.The guards by Heir Xie\u2019s side did not think that they would see the duke who rarely went back and they all went down their horses and respectfully greeted the duke with loud voices.\u201cGreeting the duke!\u201dThe male servant who accompanied Heir Xie to the government office saw Jiang Ningbao and waves rose in his heart.The girl by the duke\u2019s side was actually Jiang fourth miss.Yang Shuqing who was in the carriage heard her fiance calling \u2018father\u2019 and the guards all shouting \u2018Duke Ding\u2019 and her heart was happy. Could it be that Duke Ding specially went back from the Western Suburbs for the engagement of the heir?It seemed that Duke Ding placed great importance on Heir Xie.Thinking like this, Yang Shuqing opened the curtain in happiness. Who knew that she would see the elegant and dazzling Jiang Ningbao who was smiling like a flower blooming? Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes flashed with astonishment and the happiness on her face receded and her face sunk. The gaze she used to see Jiang Ningbao carried hostility and coldness.Jiang fourth miss actually came at Duke Ding Residence.The news of her and Heir Xie settling their engagement had spread throughout the capital. Now, Heir Xie was her fiance. Jiang fourth miss actually did not give up, coveting her fiance. Yang Shuqing\u2019s face went taut and her face went cold a few degrees.\u201cJiang Ningbao!\u201dYang Shuqing lowered her voice and spoke the name word by word. Her voice was cold and biting, making others\u2019 hearts feel cold.The pressure in the carriage suddenly became cold, making the servants by her side, Qian Rong and Qian Bi, to lower their heads. Their sweat covered their backs.As the oldest miss\u2019 trusted servants, they knew better than anyone how cruel and merciless the oldest miss was and how good her means were. Even Concubine Yan who was favored for nearly twenty years fell in her hand. Not to mention that she ruined the reputation of the concubine born young misses and young masters.Now that Jiang fourth miss was hated by the oldest miss, Qian Rong and Qian Bi shivered coldly. They could predict Jiang fourth miss\u2019s tragic ending.Once the oldest miss struck, it would be bullseye.Duke Ding Xie Heng stared at the handsome adopted son of his without saying anything. He thought of the reports from the guards and recalling the white hair of his mother, the ominous energy in his eyes went brutal. The ominous energy on his body moved and a strong oppression, carrying strong and awe-inspiring ominous energy attacked Xie Jingyi.The bunch of guards on the back saw the duke suddenly making things difficult for them and they thought that the heir had made the duke angry. They all knelt on the ground with white faces as they forcefully resisted the attack of the ominous energy. Beads of sweat fell non-stop and they all shouted with fear.\u201cSir duke, spare us!\u201dYang Shuqing and her two servant girls who did not go down the carriage were also swept by the sudden explosion of Duke Ding\u2019s ominous energy. Yang Shuqing\u2019s face became white in an instant and she felt it hard to breathe. She breathed heavily and deeply, fear flashing across her eyes.Duke Ding was scary.Only his momentum already made people frightened.Fortunately, fortunately Duke Ding only had a short of two years left to live. If not, with the existence of such a scary person in Duke Ding Residence, she was afraid that she would lose her life.Yang Shuqing could not help but shivered coldly.\u201cFather, may I ask what this son did to make you angry?\u201dHeir Xie\u2019s straight figure swaggered and almost knelt in front of the crowd. His cool and handsome face revealed a trace of paleness and astonishment. He could not help but settle his gaze on his ex-fiancee who was standing next to his adopted father.This was a strange feeling. Heir Xie felt that the reason his father was this angry had something to do with his ex-fiancee.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes met with Heir Xie\u2019s eyes. She understood the meaning in his eyes and she gave him a pretty smile. She used her mouth to silently said: This has nothing to do with me.Her heart was sighing. As expected of the male lead. He could actually stand straight facing the duke\u2019s enormous momentum.Duke Ding Xie Heng heard his adopted son\u2019s question and the ominous energy in his eyes condensed brutally once more, deep and biting. The dignity between his brows seemed to be released and pressured Xie Jingyi. His low and deep voice carried sharpness like a blade.\u201cUnfilial!\u201d\u201cUnjust!\u201dThe faces of the guards behind Heir Xie turned white and their foreheads had cold sweat that drenched their backs. The duke\u2019s momentum was really scary, but they respected the woman who stood beside the duke calmly even more.Unfilial\u2026..Unjust\u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His body shook and his pupils contracted. He thought back to when he knelt in the Thriving Joy Hall for the matter of annulling the engagement. It seemed that this matter angered his adopted father.No wonder his adopted father returned at this time to the residence.Unjust\u2026..Heir Xie raised his head to look at the feeble and beautiful girl with a gentle and refined smile who stood next to his adopted father again.Adopted father was helping her find justice!Heir Xie swiftly knelt after knowing the reason for his adopted father\u2019s anger.\u201cPlease give me punishment, father.\u201dThe guards behind him were all staring with wide eyes.Sir heir admitted to it.If this was spread, then won\u2019t that cut off the heir\u2019s path?Chun Xi, Butler Zhao, and the others also witnessed this scene.Especially Chun Xi. She did not think that she would one day witness Heir Xie kneeling and admitting his wrong. Her heart was very happy and her eyes could not help but lift a little.Butler Zhao\u2019s gaze was indifferent.In his eyes, sir heir was indeed not filial. The old madam\u2019s body was not good but he still knelt to force the old madam.Jiang Ningbao lifted her brow. Her calm gaze stared at Heir Xie who was kneeling and thought silently that this male lead was decisive and not sly. He was good in other aspects but when managing the matter of engagement, he went back on his principles and became ungrateful.It was indeed as Duke Ding Xie Heng said.Unjust.Jiang Ningbao did not feel pity at all toward him, only satisfaction in her heart.At the moment, she was a bit curious as to how the duke would punish Heir Xie. If she did not remember it wrong, Heir Xie was a real sixth rank five cities military forces commander, responsible for the capital\u2019s security.Like this, the range of the punishment became a lot smaller.\u201cThe punishment will be fifty beating with wooden staves, kneel in the ancestral hall for three days straight.\u201d Duke Ding Xie Heng saw that his adopted son did not try to quibble and directly admitted his wrong so he retracted the dominance and ominous energy while telling him the punishments in a cold voice.If it were not because his adopted son had an important job, the punishment won\u2019t be that light.Once the punishment was spoken, Heir Xie heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He lowered his head and respectfully said, \u201cSon accepts the punishment!\u201dDuke Ding giving punishment, Jiang Ningbao saw it calmly, her brows did not even move. Unfortunately, this was within the area of Duke Ding Residence. Aside from the people carried by Yang Shuqing, there was no other official passing by.The male lead\u2019s luck was good.But today was the day Heir Xie got engaged, he got punished by Duke Ding Xie Heng fifty wooden staves instead. Having blood poured on this day, she was happy thinking about it.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes stared at the carriage not far from them that had its curtain open. Her lips curved to a faint smile.Yang Shuqing could not sit back anymore.Things went like Jiang Ningbao expected. When the tyrannical momentum was gone, Yang Shuqing who was inside the carriage became feeble. Before she cooled down, she heard Duke Ding\u2019s cold voice reprimanding Heir Xie to be unfilial and unjust.Her heart sank.Unfilial and unjust\u2026..how could her fiance have this kind of title?Before she thought it through, she once more heard Duke Ding\u2019s punishment. Yang Shuqing blackened and almost fainted over. Today was the day she got engaged, but her fiance was punished with fifty wooden staves.Once this news spread out, who knew how much dirty water would be spilled on her?Especially on the day she persuaded the heir to let her specially greet Old Madam Xie.Yang Shuqing became anxious. Before the two servant girls reacted, she already jumped down the carriage in anxiety and ran toward Xie Jingyi\u2019s side after lifting her skirt. Her breath was short and fast.\u201cHeir, this is slander, you cannot admit to the punishment.\u201dOnce he admitted, then won\u2019t he admit that he was not filial and did injustice?Yang Shuqing could not let her fiance carry these titles. She could not let herself got the reputation of harming her fiance since whoever just had the engagement settled and then the fiance was injured, it was not a good thing.Jiang Ningbao saw Yang Shuqing went down the carriage and ran to Xie Jingyi\u2019s side. Her lips curved to a playful smile. This new fiance and fiancee, one wore dark red brocade robe weaved with silver threads while the other wore dark red peony dress.Those who did not know the internal workings would think that these two had mental rapport.But Jiang Ningbao who read the book knew that this was all the idea Yang Shuqing proposed and Xie Jingyi complied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His tone was calm.\u201cShuqing, I indeed did something wrong. It is only normal that I am punished.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Unfilial and unjust, these are heavy accusation. I only know that you respect the elderly and are good to your brothers. How can you be unfilial and unjust?\u201dYang Shuqing took a deep breath and regained her coolness. She scanned the guards around and spoke in a sonorous and forceful voice.The handsome Heir Xie who knelt on the ground closed his eyes and bellowed lowly.\u201cShuqing, don\u2019t ask!\u201dThat\u2019s right. Before he liked Shuqing, he was indeed as she said to be respectful to elders and good to his brothers, impressive like the moon. But after knowing that Shuqing was a woman and knowing how he felt toward Shuqing, because she said she did not want to be a concubine and only wanted one life, one world, one pair of couples.Because of that, he annulled the engagement he had since he was little and went back on his principles, becoming ungrateful. This was injustice.For her, he knelt to force the old madam to agree to annul the engagement. This was unfilial.Adopted father was right. He was unfilial and unjust.He only wanted to bear the consequences himself and not let the woman he liked to know and felt guilty.After being bellowed by Heir Xie, Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes went red. She bit her lips, feeling wronged. She gazed deeply at him and stubbornly said, \u201cHeir, forgive me, I only want to give you justice.\u201dAfter saying this, Yang Shuqing\u2019s sight went to the elegant and beautiful Jiang Ningbao who stood next to Duke Ding. She naturally ignored Jiang Ningbao\u2019s standing position. While suppressing the hatred in her heart, she asked loudly word by word.\u201cJiang fourth miss, this is your revenge, right? Heir Xie gave you up and chose me, so you gave sir heir the title of unfilial and unjust. I want to ask, how is the heir unfilial and unjust?\u201dOnce she spoke, the guards behind Heir Xie all perked up their ears.Actually, they also wanted to know why the duke who was just and sound said that the heir was unfilial and unjust.Jiang Ningbao glanced at Yang Shuqing who straightened her back and was bold and assured. Her heart was laughing. Heir Xie was unfilial and unjust, why else if not because of her?At this time, she actually jumped to ask her, this pushover. How laughable. Jiang Ningbao lifted the hair below her ear and stared at Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s side face as she laughed lightly.\u201cMiss Yang, why the heir is unfilial, why don\u2019t you ask the duke? What is your meaning asking me?\u201d\u201cSir duke, don\u2019t you think so?\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s voice was soft and warm, easy to the ears like a breeze of spring wind.This Yang Shuqing was too self-confident. After rebirth, things were too smooth so she felt very superior and could not get the slightest grievance. Once she got any grievance, she would return it a hundred times.Heir Xie was a smart man. He wanted to protect her by admitting to the mistakes and let it be.But Yang Shuqing did not want to let this off and pointing the spearhead to her. Wasn\u2019t it because Yang Shuqing thought that she liked Heir Xie and deliberately spoke accusations in front of the duke that she was stuck out this strongly?What a pig teammate.\u201cTo annul the engagement, kneel down to force the elder, is not filial.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s sword brows were knitted and his voice was cold and sharp as it carried indisputable dominance. This was the first time he saw the woman his adopted son liked. This woman could not take even the slightest grievance.No wonder his adopted son who was mature and steady would kneel to force his mother to agree to annulling the engagement. So the reason was this woman.The momentum of Duke Ding condensed and the crowd immediately felt a strong force attacking and suppressing them. It was only for a moment and it disappeared.Yang Shuqing\u2019s heart trembled and her face turned white.She suddenly thought back to when the male servant of sir heir\u2019s telling her that to let the old madam agree to annul the engagement, he knelt outside the old madam\u2019s courtyard one day and one night. After she knew this, she was moved and happy.Thinking about it now, forcing the elder was indeed not filial.So the real culprit of this was her.Yang Shuqing sweated coldly and bit down her lower lip, suddenly speechless. What Duke Ding said was a fact. She could not forcefully turn it around. It would only harm her reputation.\u201cMiss Yang, because of your words of not willing to be a concubine, Heir Xie knelt to force his elder. His feeling toward Miss Yang was deep and heavy. Now that Miss Yang got what she wanted, congratulations!\u201dJiang Ningbao glanced at Yang Shuqing\u2019s changing face with a smile. Her tone was light, soft, and clear, as if pearls were dropping on a jade plate. Everyone could hear the sarcasm in the words \u2018not willing to be a concubine\u2019 and \u2018congratulations\u2019.The people present looked at Yang Shuqing with weird gazes. At the same time, the ones following Heir Xie felt a trace of disappointment.\u201cShuqing, don\u2019t speak anymore. I\u2019m willing to take the punishments.\u201dFifty wooden staves and kneeling in the ancestral hall for three days was already the lightest punishment.Heir Xie\u2019s brows knitted and his lips pursed into a line. He did not want his fiancee to continue speaking and bellowed once more to prevent this. This time, his voice had some severeness.Yang Shuqing was hurt by Heir Xie\u2019s severe voice. Knowing each other for two years, he had never spoken this way to her. Yang Shuqing\u2019s heart suddenly felt cold.She was sticking out for sir heir, but he did not feel grateful.Yang Shuqing inhaled deeply, but once she thought that she let sir heir get the title of unfilial, her heart could not help but feel a trace of gratitude and guilt. That little grievance disappeared and the gaze she used to look at Jiang Ningbao carried coldness.\u201cSir duke, when you say sir heir is unjust, does it have anything to do with Jiang fourth miss having her engagement annulled?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He did not refute.\u201cYes.\u201dYang Shuqing silently heaved a sigh of relief and her brows flashed with a trace of sharpness. She did not think that this was really related to Jiang Nigbao. She smiled coldly in her heart and her gaze went to Jiang Ningbao.This time, she finally realized what was wrong.Jiang Ningbao, a soft and tender girl, actually able to stand next to Duke Ding easily. Yang Shuqing\u2019s gaze changed and her heart had a bad premonition.\u201cSir duke, let me explain this matter.\u201d Jiang Ningbao\u2019s glances roamed and she spoke softly and warmly.Duke Ding glanced at her and said, \u201cAlright.\u201dJiang Ningbao laughed lightly and her forehead shone with elegance and intellectual brilliance. She faintly swept her gaze on Heir Xie\u2019s changing expression and looked at the female lead Yang Shuqing once more. Her lips curved upward and her smile was even more beautiful and moving.\u201cMiss Yang wants to know why sir heir annulling the engagement is injustice, then I will tell you the reason now.\u201dOnce these words were spoken, the people present perked up their ears to listen.Only Xie Jingyi looked at his ex-fiancee deeply. He realized that every single time he saw her, it would make people felt attracted and awed, as if a polished diamond, standing out from the crowd and catching everyone\u2019s gazes.Today, he got engaged with Yang Shuqing. Jiang Ningbao and his tall and handsome adopted father standing together gave him a feeling of a hero and a beauty.Xie Jingyi lowered his eyes.He suddenly realized that he did not understand this ex-fiancee of his. Was she sincere in getting married to his adopted father or was it because she was not resigned and wanted to retaliate against him by marrying into Duke Ding Residence?\u201cJiang fourth miss, please speak.\u201d Yang Shuqing suppressed the restlessness in her heart and coldly looked at Jiang Ningbao.\u201cMiss Yang, today, I will tell you the reason of my engagement with Heir Xie and let everyone to judge.\u201d Jiang Ningbao spoke not fast or slow. Her gaze swept through everyone present and a light flashed through her eyes.With Duke Ding\u2019s witness, Xie Jingyi could not refute.She, Jiang Ningbao, was not a pushover that anyone could pinch.Yang Shuqing gave her a good opportunity so Jiang Ningbao would not miss it.\u201cWhen I was three years old, me and my mother rescued Xie family\u2019s second madam and six years old Heir Xie who were attacked by bandits on the way back from the temple. Second Madam Xie was grateful for my mother\u2019s rescue and proposed an engagement. My mother saw Heir Xie was smart and agreed to this engagement, exchanged the horoscope card and wrote the notarized engagement certificate.\u201dJiang Ningbao revealed the internal knowledge of the birth of the engagement that year in the simplified version.Her tone was very calm and there was no undulation, as if she was saying the matter of another person, though it moved the heartstrings of the people present. They did not think that there was this kind of thing behind Jiang fourth miss\u2019 engagement.Duke Ding did not treat sir heir unjustly. Sir heir who was impressive like the moon was indeed unfilial and unjust.The one proposing engagement was Xie family, the one annulling it was also Heir Xie.Jiang fourth miss was innocent in all this.\u201cJiang fourth miss, this was only your one-sided statement. Who knows if it\u2019s real or not?\u201d Yang Shuqing\u2019s hand was sweating coldly and her face was heavy like water as she smiled coldly.Jiang Ningbao smiled. As expected of the female lead of a reborn revenge story, this mentality was indeed strong. Her gaze averted to Xie Jingyi and she spoke, \u201cReal or not, why doesn\u2019t Miss Yang ask Heir Xie?\u201d\u201cWhat Jiang fourth miss said is indeed true.\u201dA low and deep clear voice rang. Xie Jingyi knew that once he admitted this, his reputation would fall to the ground, but fact was fact. It could not be turned around for him.The blood on Yang Shuqing\u2019s face disappeared. Astonishment and disbelief filled her clear face. It was obvious that she found this hard to accept and staggered backward.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201dYang Shuqing finally realized that she fell into Jiang Ningbao\u2019s trap.What a good one stone killing two birds.Her fiance\u2019s reputation, her reputation, was ruined because of her. It was all ruined.Jiang Ningbao smiled faintly. Her tone was very soft and light, \u201cMiss Yang, for you, Heir Xie was willing to bear the titles of unfilial and unjust. This kind of emotions are really admirable.\u201d\u201cMiss Yang, I believe that you will not let down Heir Xie\u2019s love, since you\u2019ve told me once that Heir Xie is a dragon among men. The noble ladies who like him are countless, you are not an exception.\u201d\u201cNow, Miss Yang got what you wanted. I wish you get together for a hundred years.\u201dJiang Ningbao carried a faint smile from beginning to the end and she did not look hurt at all, even wishing for them. This magnanimity made others could not help but look at her in praise.Duke Ding Xie Heng at the side glanced at the little lady, his hard and cold face softened a bit.The little lady was magnanimous.He did not know that in her heart, Jiang Ningbao was silently feeling it was a pity that she could not reveal the big news that Yang Shuqing and Xie Jingyi had conversed with each other for two years, if not, she would be bit by Yang Shuqing. Revealing it later on was not later. Chewing too much would make her fat. The news she revealed today was enough to make Xie Jingyi\u2019s reputation fall.As Xie Jingyi\u2019s fiance, Yang Shuqing won\u2019t be better.In ancient times where male dominated, people were used to push the blame to the women, but as the female lead, Yang Shuqing was not innocent. This was all because of her.Her rebirth changed a lot of people\u2019s fate.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart felt happy and her black eyes shone with a brilliant light.Yang Shuqing\u2019s face color was like the ground. She looked at Jiang Ningbao who was smiling warmly not far away from her. The sunlight was obviously magnificent, but her whole body felt cold as she shuddered not from coldness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was obvious that someone told what happened on the gates of the residence to Old Madam Xie.The crowd immediately greeted her.\u201cGreeting the old madam.\u201dOld Madam Xie nodded with a faint smile. Her eyes swept across the people present and she saw her adopted grandson kneeling on the ground with a beautiful girl on his side. She could not help but frowned and said, \u201cWhy are you kneeling in front of the main gates? Get up, let us speak inside the residence.\u201dThe crowd stood in sync.Once Yang Shuqing saw Old Madam Xie, her eyes shot with a trace of light. She thought to the health preserving wine she took back. This health preserving wine was the most expensive kind and the process of brewing this wine was complicated as it used a lot of treasured herbs.It was still not sold in Upper Cloud Wine Shop.Her heart had an idea. Duke Ding went to the battlefield when he was younger and the hidden injuries on his body were not little. If she was given this health preserving wine, Old Madam Xie would definitely regard her in a favourable light.As long as Old Madam Xie spoke up for sir heir, sir heir\u2019s criminal title of \u2018unfilial\u2019 would be washed off.As for \u2018unjust\u2019\u2026..Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes flashed with cruelty as her heart already had a plan.At this time, the small sedan Old Madam Xie sat on face Jiang Ningbao. She gave Jiang Ningbao an amiable smile and glared at her useless son, \u201cA\u2019Heng, why have you not send Ningbao girl back to her residence?\u201dOnce these words were spoken, Yang Shuqing\u2019s expression changed abruptly.She thought that Jiang Ningbao had just arrived at Duke Ding Residence just like her. She did not think that Jiang Ningbao would already meet Old Madam Xie and seeing Old Madam Xie\u2019s amiable expression with fondness, her heart sunk suddenly. A trace of cloudiness appeared in the bottom of her eyes.Xie Jingyi\u2019s cold and cool handsome face flashed with astonishment.It seemed that grandmother liked Jiang fourth miss very much.\u201cOld madam, don\u2019t be angry. Sir duke was only delayed by certain matters.\u201d Jiang Ningbao glanced at Duke Ding\u2019s handsome face and spoke for him with a smile.Old Madam Xie scolded her with laughter, \u201cThis girl.\u201dThe intimacy in her tone was something everyone could hear and their hearts trembled as they all glanced at Jiang fourth miss. They never knew that this tender and beautiful Jiang fourth miss was this favored by Old Madam Xie.\u201cA\u2019Heng, it\u2019s no longer early, you should quickly send Ningbao girl back to the residence.\u201d Old Madam Xie could not help but urge him on.Duke Ding Xie Heng paused. He turned his face to meet with the little lady\u2019s clear and brilliant pair of eyes as he spoke faintly.\u201cI will send you back.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s lips bloomed into a magnificent smile. She bowed toward Old Madam Xie and lifted her feet to the place where her carriage was parked not far away. Along with her movement, Chun Xi who was carrying a delicate accessory box rushed over, helped her lady to board the carriage and then closed the curtain.She cut off the gazes that Heir Xie and Yang Shuqing sent them.A black clothed personal guard took Duke Ding\u2019s horse over.\u201cButler Zhao, the matter of punishment, must be executed.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng commanded Butler Zhao with an indifferent voice and he bowed toward Old Madam Xie. He got on the horse, he sat on the stallion horse with his dark purple long gown and held the rein. His wrist revealed a purple wooden Buddhist bracelet. The warm sunlight fell on him, giving a feeling of handsome and spirited, tall and sturdy.Jiang Ningbao opened the curtain of the carriage, her head was out to gaze at the handsome and out of the ordinary Duke Ding and waved at him with a radiant and enchanting smile. After that, she commanded the driver and the carriage moved forward slowly.Duke Ding Xie Heng galloped his horse to follow her. Behind him was a small group of black clothed personal guards escorting.\u201cSir heir, Miss Yang, please enter the residence.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He retracted his gaze and looked at Heir Xie and the other who stood there waiting. He welcomed them respectfully.Xie Jingyi nodded slightly. He stood straight and tall, still that aloof and noble, his voice was low to the utmost.\u201cButler Zhao, how can Jiang fourth miss be here?\u201dYang Shuqing lowered her eyes as she stood at the side, a trace of coldness flashed through the bottom of her eyes.Butler Zhao glanced at Old Madam Xie who was sitting on the sedan that moved forward as he answered with a smile.\u201cThe old madam invited.\u201d\u201cSir heir, let me tell you some good news. Under the witness of the old madam, Jiang fourth miss and sir duke had settled their engagement orally, only waiting to propose formally. Sir heir, please keep your distance with Jiang fourth miss from now on. Jiang fourth miss is going to be your elder soon, the future Duchess Ding.\u201dOnce Butler Zhao\u2019s words were out, they were like thunder clapping in Yang Shuqing\u2019s ears.The future Duchess Ding.After rebirth, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s identity was still Duchess Ding.Could it be that Jiang Ningbao was destined to be a duchess?The hands she hid in her sleeves tightened and her eyes flashed with cloudiness. How could it be? How could Jiang Ningbao get married to Duke Ding\u2026..the future duchess should be her.Once she thought of Jiang Ningbao suppressing her above her head using her identity as mother-in-law and got her revenge on her\u2026..she still had to be respectful in front of Jiang Ningbao\u2026..Yang Shuqing\u2019s face did not reveal that her heart turned cold once more.She could not let this be.Yang Shuqing placated her messy thought and she smiled faintly, though her eyes were not.\u201cJiang fourth miss can get married to Duke Ding as she wants, this is a matter worth happy for.\u201d\u201cMiss Yang is right. Sir duke finally gets married and has children. The old madam is very happy, even raising the servants\u2019 monthly salary.\u201d Butler Zhao replied with smiles.He was really happy.As long as Jiang fourth miss gave sir duke children, then Duke Ding Residence would definitely be inherited by the legitimate heir and won\u2019t fall to outsider\u2019s hand.These few years, Xie family\u2019s second branch was too rampant.Marrying a wife and having children\u2026..Yang Shuqing was shocked and her eyes flashed with a trace of cruelty. If Jiang Ningbao really gave sir duke children, then\u2026..then what about sir heir?The only fortunate thing was no one knew that Duke Ding only had two years left to live. As long as Jiang Ningbao did not get pregnant with the duke\u2019s child in these two years\u2026..no, maybe there was even a crueler method.Preventing Jiang Ningbao to get married into Duke Ding Residence.Having the counter plan, Yang Shuqing\u2019s whole body was at ease and her clear face had on a faint smile.Butler Zhao looked at her deeply.Xie Jingyi\u2019s whole body stiffened and his lips were pursed into a line.Maybe he already had the premonition when he saw his ex-fiancee standing next to his adopted father and now that his guess was right, Heir Xie did not feel unexpected.He could not help but recall a few days earlier, his ex-fiancee declared in front of the government office.\u201cI feel that being my ex-fiance\u2019s mom is better.\u201dNow, she really wanted to get married to his adopted father, becoming his\u2026..elder. Being short a generation for no reason made Xie Jingyi feel a complicated emotion that was hard to define.\u201cI know.\u201dHeir Xie spoke faintly and turned his head to glance at his fiancee, Yang Shuqing. Yang Shuqing gave him a brilliant and magnanimous smile as they entered Duke Ding Residence together.Butler Zhao followed with smiles.Duke Ding Residence\u2019s red painted main gates closed with a loud sound.Yang Shuqing turned her head to gaze at the tightly shut red doors and looked at Old Madam Xie who was being carried in the front. She took a deep breath and while Duke Ding was not in the residence, she decided to plead.Today was the day of her and Heir Xie\u2019s engagement, there must not be any blood.Even a little was not tolerable.\u2026..Going back to the residence this time, with Duke Ding\u2019s escort, Jiang Ningbao used a little trick. She did not use the nearest road, but deliberately moved around to circle a big road.\u201cLady, us circling this big of a circle, is it really okay? Isn\u2019t it too obvious?\u201d Chun Xi asked with anxiety. Once she thought that her lady specially picked a road that passed through the capital\u2019s bustling road to delay the time of arriving back to the residence, her heart trembled.Duke Ding must have seen through it.Jiang Ningbao smiled slightly and she flicked her hair, \u201cChun Xi, what are you worried about?\u201dChun Xi was about to cry.\u201cLady, how can this servant not be worried? If sir duke got angry\u2026..\u201dJiang Ningbao laughed with a \u2018pfft\u2019.\u201cChun Xi, rest assured. Sir duke won\u2019t get angry. He must have seen through my want to declare ownership. He may even be secretly happy in his heart.\u201dDeclare ownership\u2026..Duke Ding Xie Heng who was quite close to the carriage heard the conversation of this pair of master and servant, his eyes rose with an undetectable wave.Secretly happy\u2026..The black clothed guards who escorted the carriage all twitched their lips. Was the one Jiang fourth miss spoke about really their cold as ice master?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Most of them were talking about Duke Ding\u2019s heir proposing to Anyuan Marquis Residence and they once more pitied Jiang fourth miss.This moment, someone saw Duke Ding Xie Heng, who emitted a sharp and dense aura that made people avoid him, actually led the black clothed guards to escort an ordinary carriage. This elicit surprised reactions and they all stopped discussing as they were all curious who the person in the carriage was.Jiang Ningbao deliberately opened half the curtain when the audience reached its peak and revealed half of her delicate and tenderly beautiful face. The one that got the most attention was the arm that opened the curtain.Her white, delicate, and tender wrist had on a ruby bracelet and under the illumination of the sun, it faintly shone with red light.\u201cIt\u2019s a noble girl.\u201dThe ones with sharp eyes saw this scene and let out exclamations. Duke Ding actually escorted a noble girl. What was the identity of the noble girl? The people in the wine shops and tea houses were all burst.Who did not know that Duke Ding was a walking weapon and the bachelor all girls avoided?Now that they witnessed Duke Ding personally escorting a noble girl, everyone lost interest in discussing about Heir Xie and Oldest Miss Yang\u2019s matter. They all stretched out their necks and rubbed their eyes, all wanting to clearly see who that noble girl was.Some people followed behind secretly to see the excitement.Being looked at by so many people far away did not cause any change on Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s handsome and cold face. Only when he thought of the words the little said about declaring ownership did a change occur.The road passed by the market.While the followers behind were growing.Until the carriage stopped in front of the gates of Changning Count Residence, the people following behind became dumbstruck like chickens, so shocked that they could not form words for a long while. Who could tell them that this noble lady\u2019s identity was actually Changning Count Residence\u2019s young miss\u2026..They all thought of Jiang fourth miss at the same time.This was hot news.When Changning Count Residence\u2019s servants saw the familiar carriage, they were all shocked wide-eyes and they trembled. Duke Ding actually led the black clothed guards to escort the fourth miss back to the residence\u2026..This time, a pretty servant girl came down first to place a small stool and in the following, a graceful figure wearing a light blue dress appeared. With the help of the servant girl, she stepped on the stool to get down the carriage.The girl was around sixteen to seventeen years old, wearing a light blue embroidered white magnolia dress and silently stood beside the carriage looking tender and beautiful. Her black hair contrasted her jade skin and she looked very charming.\u201cIt\u2019s Jiang fourth miss!\u201dThe ones who had seen Jiang Ningbao\u2019s face exclaimed and everyone knew that the noble lady Duke Ding escorted back was really Jiang fourth miss, making the crowd was in an uproar.\u201cFourth lady, you\u2019re back.\u201d The servants in Changning Count Residence had their own discretion and the moment they say Jiang Ningbao went down the carriage, they greeted respectfully and bowed.Jiang Ningbao nodded slightly and turned to stare at the men on the horse who wore dark purple long gowns. The bottom of her eyes flashed with a trace of slyness. From her sleeves, she took out the sutra and waved it as she flashed him a naughty smile. Her voice was sonorous and easy to the ear.\u201cSir duke, thank you for the sutra you sent me. I like it very much.\u201d\u201cAlso, today\u2019s lunch was very delicious.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s brows moved.He noticed that aside from being gutsy, the little lady was also very sly. His heart had a premonition that after his mother went to the palace to ask for a marriage decree, his peaceful days would take off and won\u2019t return.But he strangely looked forward to it.The black clothed guards all secretly glanced at their master\u2019s cold and handsome face and then to Jiang fourth miss\u2019 beautiful and brilliant smile. They all thought that Jiang fourth miss was really\u2026..really wanted to declare to the whole world how intimate her relationship was with the duke.Chun Xi widened her eyes. She noticed that after breaking her engagement with Heir Xie, her lady seemed to have unleashed something. Her whole self became livelier and gutsy.She did not know whether the third young master would be shocked or not when he saw the lady like this after coming back.Chun Xi honestly preferred her lady like this.Duke Ding Xie Heng realized that the gazes of the surrounding people were on the little lady and his sharp sword-like brows subconsciously knitted. A huge suppressant force suddenly coming down in torrents.The surrounding people were shocked by this oppressive force and they all retracted their gazes with white faces and trembling knees as they wanted to run away.How scary!\u201cIt\u2019s not safe outside, let\u2019s enter first.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng took back the ominous aura and his dark and cold voice seemed as if there was no warmth in it, but the people who were shocked could hear a trace of concern.\u201cThank you for the duke\u2019s concern. Thank you for escorting me all the way, duke.\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s pair of eyes were shining like the stars. She once more waved the sutra and bowed with smiles. After that, she elegantly strode in small quick steps into the residence.The servants guarding the gates had not snapped back.But fourth lady had taken her servant girl Chun Xi and walked far away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He expressionlessly whipped the horse to turn and led the black clothed guards to leave. The carriage drive also whipped the horse to leave.The crowd outside had not dispersed and they were in a heated discussion.\u201cDuke Ding\u2019s aura is so scary. I\u2019m shocked till I\u2019m drenched in cold sweat.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m shocked till my knees turned weak.\u201d\u201cWhat is happening? Wasn\u2019t today the day Heir Xie and Oldest Miss Yang got engaged? What is the meaning of Duke Ding sending Jiang fourth miss a sutra?\u201d\u201cLove token?\u201dThe crowd halted and they all looked at the last one speaking with a speechless state. That person shrunk his neck and stepped back in fear, \u201cWhy are you guys looking at me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anyone giving Buddhist sutra as a love token.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it either.\u201d\u201cThe Buddhist sutra was not the main point. Have you guys forgotten that Jiang fourth miss said that today\u2019s lunch was delicious? It seems that Jiang fourth miss is treated well in the Duke Ding Residence.\u201d\u201cAlso, it seems that Jiang fourth miss is not afraid of Duke Ding and Duke Ding seems to treat Jiang fourth miss differently. Won\u2019t this mean that Jiang fourth miss has a big chance of getting married to Duke Ding?\u201d\u201cHearing you say it like that, I suddenly feel a little anticipation.\u201d\u201cHaha, I also anticipate it. Ex-fiancee turned adopted mother, being higher in seniority all of a sudden. I want to know how Heir Xie reacts.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s really like this, won\u2019t Jiang fourth miss and Oldest Miss Yang become mother-in-law and daughter-in-law?\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201d\u201cNot there\u2019s a good show.\u201d\u201cI want to know how Heir Xie reacts.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dThe servants of Changning Count Residence heard the discussion of the crowd and they were all in a trance. If Jiang fourth miss really got married to Duke Ding, the residence would undergo big changes.As the first madam\u2019s servants, there was old servant Yang\u2019s relative within the two gatekeepers and the news traveled fast. They all knew that the first madam wanted to give this fourth miss an engagement and they looked at each other.This would be troublesome.Old Madam Jiang received the news about what happened in the gates right after it happened. She did not think that this fourth miss that she did not like had this kind of good luck.Old Madam Jiang sipped her tea and her eyes glinted.\u201cHong Xing, call fourth miss to go to Golden Longevity Hall later on.\u201dJiang Ningbao returned to her courtyard with a good mood, not at all minding the gazes of the servants. Who knew that on the road, she would meet Old Madam Jiang\u2019s trusted servant Hong Xing who was searching for her. Hong Xing bowed to Jiang Ningbao respectfully, \u201cFourth lady, the old madam wishes to see you.\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes flashed and she nodded with a light smile, \u201cI will go there now.\u201dFollowing servant Hong Xing to the Golden Longevity Hall and telling Chun Xi to stay outside, Jiang Ningbao entered the hall alone and saw Old Madam Jiang who sat in the main hall. First Madam Zhang sat below her and beside her, there were three lively servants serving at the side.Jiang Ningbao walked forward in small steps and greeted with a smile, \u201cGranddaughter greets grandmother.\u201d And then she greeted First Madam Zhang whose face was not too good.From the etiquette, no one could find fault in her.Old Madam Jiang deeply gazed at the smiling fourth lady. Before, this granddaughter of hers was always too submissive and meek.Every single time the old madam saw her like this, she would feel disgusted and unhappy.No, fourth girl seemed like a jade that was polished delicately, displaying the resplendent brilliance that belonged to her, stealing others\u2019 gazes. This kind of aura and romantic charm was not something one could have overnight. It seemed that the fourth girl had been hiding inadequacy by keeping quiet these past years.\u201cFourth girl, I heard that Duke Ding escorted you back to the residence, is it true?\u201d Old Madam Jiang lifted her teacup and sipped the tea. Her eyes were staring at Jiang Ningbao\u2019s face sharply.Jiang Ningbao smiled slightly and answered in a tone not fast or slow, \u201cReplying grandmother, there is indeed this matter.\u201d\u201cFourth girl, why would Duke Ding escort you back to the residence?\u201d Old Madam Jiang\u2019s eyes lit up with a luster. She put down her teacup and continued to ask.Jiang Ningbao smiled as she answered, \u201cOld Madam Xie told sir duke to send granddaughter back to the residence.\u201dOld Madam Jiang heard this and her gaze turned more amiable. Her eyes moved to the Buddhist sutra in Jiang Ningbao\u2019s hands and halted. She heard that Duke Ding gave the fourth girl a sutra, could it be this one?\u201cIs this the sutra Duke Ding sent?\u201dJiang Ningbao lowered her head to look at the sutra in her hands. She gently stroked it and raised her head to stare at the old madam with clear eyes. She nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cFourth girl, why did Duke Ding send you a sutra? Could it be that your speech a few days ago angered Duke Ding?\u201d Her first aunt Madam Zhang who kept silent got the chance she looked for to speak. Her eyes stared at the sutra in Jiang Ningbao\u2019s hands without moving as her voice carried the intention to corner her.Jiang Ningbao thought in her heart, here it came.The women in the backyard had the specialty of using Buddhist sutra to make news.Old Madam Jiang\u2019s face sank slightly. It was obvious that she also thought that the action of giving a sutra may have a different meaning, if she interpreted it wrong\u2026.. It seemed that she still had to ask for more details.\u201cFourth girl, let use put aside the matter of Buddhist sutra. Tell grandmother the matter about Duke Ding Residence.\u201dJiang Ningbao glanced at her oldest aunt and calmly told her what happened from when she met Duke Ding at the main gates of Duke Ding Residence. She retold what happened today clearly.She also hid the matter of medicinal wine.The whole hall was in silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was so moved that her hands were slightly shaking. It was obvious she never thought that this fourth girl could get near Duke Ding without being affected. This was the chance for Changning Count Residence to rise.\u201cFourth girl, you really can get near Duke Ding?\u201d Old Madam Jiang could not help but want to confirm this.Jiang Ningbao nodded in confirmation, \u201cYes.\u201dThis matter could not be kept a secret. Tomorrow, Old Madam Xie will go to Clear Water Temple to choose an auspicious day. After that, she would enter the palace to get a marriage decree. It should be around one to two days.Madam Zhang\u2019s face was dark and sullen. She was gritting her teeth in hatred mentally. She did not think that there would be a day she would make an error in judgement.She thought Jiang Ningbao was a meek little sheep, who knew that she actually had hard bones to chew.Now, she had a relationship with Duke Ding.How hateful!Once she thought that the generous dowry in fourth girl\u2019s hands would fly away, Madam Zhang\u2019s heart had a trace of anxiety. She silently bit her lips. It seemed that she could not wait anymore. She did not believe that a fallen woman could get married to Duke Ding Residence.\u201cSo this is the sutra Duke Ding personally wrote. Fourth girl, can your oldest aunt have a look?\u201d Madam Zhang took a deep breath and calmed down. She had on a smile as she asked.Once she asked, Old Madam Jiang also had interest.Jiang Ningbao raised her brow. The sutra Duke Ding wrote had a trace of ominous energy, though it was not much. Strangely, no one seemed to feel the presence of the ominous energy.\u201cOldest aunt, not everyone can see the sutra Duke Ding wrote.\u201d Jiang Ningbao pretended to care as she shook her head. She could not open the sutra Duke Ding copied eagerly. If that time, the oldest aunt had a mishap, she would be blamed.Especially when there were still other servants in the hall.Gossip was a fearful thing.Although she was not afraid of gossip, Jiang Ningbao preferred to make a few turns and stand on the reasonable side first.First Madam Zhang could not help but darkened her face, \u201cFourth girl, what do you mean?\u201dOld Madam Jiang who sat in the main hall could not help but furrow her brows, her eyes flashed with an unchanging flash. Could it be that having Duke Ding as her backing, this granddaughter\u2019s heart swell?\u201cOldest aunt, this Buddhist sutra is not the same. There\u2019s Duke Ding\u2019s ominous energy tainting it, not suitable for you to see.\u201d Jiang Ningbao revealed an awkward expression and tried to tactfully explain. When she saw her oldest aunt\u2019s face smeared with anger, her heart secretly laughed.\u201cIf you really want to look, niece will let you look.\u201dFirst Madam Zhang smiled coldly. The more fourth girl spoke like that, the more she did not believe it and the more she wanted to take a look at the Buddhist sutra. At first, she only spoke it without any intention, but now, Madam Zhang felt that fourth girl was challenging her.She must take a look at the Buddhist sutra.\u201cMother, you see how smooth the fourth girl lies? What tainted by Duke Ding\u2019s ominous energy, what a lie!\u201dOld Madam Jiang nodded faintly. It was obvious that she also thought Jiang Ningbao to be lying.\u201cFourth girl, your oldest aunt wants to see so let her see. It\u2019s only a sutra, not some rare treasure.\u201d\u201cYes, grandmother.\u201dJiang Ningbao pursed her lips and sighed lightly. She presented the sutra in her hands with a heavy hearted expression. Seeing her oldest aunt take it eagerly, Jiang Ningbao was afraid that she could not hold it in and laugh. This oldest aunt was really digging her grave.What could Jiang Ningbao do? Of course it\u2019s to help her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Without disappointing Jiang Ningbao\u2019s anticipation, she opened it once the sutra was in her hands.Things happened once she opened the sutra.A gloomy and horrifying aura dispersed from inside the sutra. First Madam Zhang was the one who got impacted the most, tyrannical and cold ominous energy attacked into her body\u2026..Her body instantly became ice cold, as if there was something in her body wreaking havoc.\u201cAa, what ghostly thing is this? How cold, how painful\u2026..\u201dMadam Zhang trembled and the blood on her face receded. Her eyes were filled with horror and her blue lips let out a scared scream. She threw the sutra in her hand far away.The sutra fell with a \u2018pah\u2019 sound.Jiang Ningbao had already known that the ominous energy in the sutra won\u2019t be able to make one lose their reasoning or become an idiot.But ominous energy entering the body would make the body turn cold and weak. The whole person would be easily angered and the temper would be bad.That was why she did not prevent her oldest aunt from digging her grave.The people in the hall saw this situation and they were all shocked until their souls left their body. They all staggered backward with faces filled with fear.The sutra that was thrown away was still open. The cold and tyrannical energy in the words dispersed out and Old Madam Jiang who was supported by Hong Xing was affected. She could not help but trembled coldly as she covered her heart with discomfort, and then she called out in anxiety.\u201cFourth girl, quickly close the sutra.\u201dJiang Ningbao made a sound of consent and lowered her eyes that flashed with a trace of satisfaction. She walked fast to where the sutra was and picked it up. The strange thing was when the sutra was still open and Jiang Ningbao picked it up, the ominous energy did not leak even a bit.Jiang Ningbao did not notice this.\u201cGrandmother, oldest aunt, the Buddhist sutra is already closed. The ominous energy won\u2019t disperse anymore.\u201dDuke Ding copied sutra to cleanse the ominous energy on his body so the words on the sutra contained dense ominous energy, but compared to the ominous energy of Duke Ding who wore the purple wooden Buddhist bracelet, it was still a lot lighter.Women\u2019s body constitution belonged to the cold category and they were sensitive to cold ominous energy, especially women whose body was not fit. They were vulnerable to the impact of the ominous energy.First Madam Zhang was the nearest to the sutra and was the first to get attacked. Her body contained the most ominous energy, she might be heavily sick later on. She also needed to supplement her body with hot nature things to compensate for the imbalance. Old Madam Jiang was only brushed by the ominous energy so she might have some small sicknesses for a few days, but she would be fine.The curtain in the hall was open for ventilation and not long later, the ominous energy was gone. Madam Zhang who was still shocked was trembling with chattering teeth as she was supported by old servant Yang. Her hair was a bit messy and her body was drenched as if she had just gotten out of soaking in the bathtub. Her eyes still had the fear that had not receded.At this moment, Madam Zhang regretted it very much.The sutra Duke Ding made was indeed not something anyone could read. Her eyes looked as if they were dipped in poison as she looked at Jiang Ningbao. It was this niece that made her be a laughingstock in front of the servants.A servant girl who had good discretion presented two bowls of calming nerves tea.\u201cOld madam, madam, please drink the calming nerves tea to suppress shock.\u201dOld Madam Jiang\u2019s face was like murky water. She received the tea Hong Xing held and drank it fast. After drinking it, she felt better. First Madam Zhang also drank the tea and when the warmth of the tea entered her mouth, her ice cold body became a little warmer and her face turned better.The two of them wanted to scold Jiang Ningbao. Their gazes settled on the sutra Jiang Ningbao held and their hearts trembled, afraid that she would open it in carelessness. Old Madam Jiang could only waved her hand to let her leave.\u201cFourth girl, you go back first.\u201dOld Madam Jiang now had trauma toward Buddhist sutra.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s mouth flashed with a trace of undetectable smile. She saluted Old Madam Jiang and First Madam Zhang who were in a sorry state and left Golden Longevity Hall with light and quick steps.After Jiang Ningbao left, Old Madam Jiang stared at the servants in the hall with an unfriendly expression, staying silent.Madam Zhang was also like that.Her face was dark and gloomy, her eyes were very scary.The atmosphere was constrained and all servants had white faces as they trembled. They all knelt.\u201cOld madam, spare us!\u201dNot mentioning how the old madam would manage the servants inside Golden Longevity Hall, Chun Xi who was waiting outside saw her lady coming out and immediately came forward.\u201cLady, are you alright?\u201dOutside the hall, Chun Xi could hear the scared exclaims inside the hall and could not help but ask in worry.Jiang Ningbao smiled slightly, \u201cI am fine.\u201d The ones who met with accidents were First Madam Zhang and Old Madam Jiang. The residence might be livelier in the few days ahead.Chun Xi was confused.On the road back to the courtyard, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s mouth curved upward and her whole body exuded a happy aura. She did not think that the sutra Duke Ding sent also had this kind of function, really\u2026..really a pleasant surprise.In the future, she could bring it with her everywhere.Once <Vajracchedika-sutra> was out, who could compete with her?The gazes the servants in Changning Count Residence used to look at Jiang Ningbao secretly held a trace of respect. Jiang Ningbao who was in a good mood did not care about this. The people in the residence were best at sailing with the biggest wind.When they arrived back at the courtyard, Bai Mei and the other servants were already waiting. They greeted her with respect and Jiang Ningbao\u2019s smile turned faint. She waved her hand to dismiss them and once she was in the room, she put the sutra Duke Ding gave her in an empty box.Chun Xi handed over a set of jewellery Old Madam Xie sent over.Jiang Ningbao glanced at the delicate jewellery box and a soft warm smile was on her lips. Today was a good day. She must write a letter to tell her older brother.When Jiang Ningbao was writing her letter, Changning Count Residence and Duke Ding Residence were not calm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once she was in the main courtyard, she immediately invited a Buddhist great master. Following that, old madam also sent someone to invite a Buddhist great master.For a span of time, the people in Changning Count Residence were in a state of anxiety. They did not know what happened to old madam and the first madam that they invited Buddhist great masters together.Could it be that something ghostly appeared in the residence?The people in the residence who had committed bad things were shocked and scared.Jiang Ningbao just told Chun Xi to go send the letter and she was in her room relaxing. After Chun Xi went back, she told her the movements in the residence so she knew what Old Madam Jiang and First Madam Zhang did. She could not help but laugh.\u201cLady, can it be that something bad appeared in the residence?\u201d Chun Xi asked in worry.Jiang Ningbao laughed, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that happened or not, but the reason why old madam and first madam invite great masters is definitely not this.\u201dChun Xi was stunned and she thought back to the exclaims she heard in the Golden Longevity Hall. It seemed to be the first madam\u2019s voice. She could not keep in her curiosity and asked, \u201cLady, what exactly happened?\u201d\u201cSir duke\u2019s sutra.\u201d Jiang Ningbao did not tease her and told her the answer.Chun Xi sucked in cold breath with wide rounded eyes, \u201cOld madam and first madam actually\u2026..actually saw the Buddhist sutra sir duke made?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve told them that the sutra had sir duke\u2019s ominous energy but grandmother and oldest aunt did not believe. They stubbornly wanted to read the Buddhist sutra sir duke made,\u201d Jiang Ningbao gasped. Her pair of beautiful eyes were filled with laughter.Chun Xi widened her mouth and after a while, she spoke dully, \u201cOld madam and first madam are really brave.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. They\u2019re really brave. A few days ahead, oldest aunt might be bedridden and her temper will turn bad and easily angered. Old madam is better, she was not attacked much.\u201d Jiang Ningbao sighed lightly and her brows rose with a trace of worry.Chun Xi: \u201c\u2026..\u201dHer lady was becoming more amazing.The most amazing was still sir duke. The sutra he made could make people retreat ninety kilometers.\u2026..Duke Ding ResidenceAfter Duke Ding escorted Jiang Ningbao and left, Xie Jingyi and Yang Shuqing went to Thriving Joy Hall together with Old Madam Xie.Yang Shuqing revealed a dignified and gentle smile as she magnanimously send a jar of health preserving wine to Old Madam Xie. This jar of health preserving wine was very precious, but compared to Old Madam Xie\u2019s acknowledgement, this jar of wine was nothing.Old Madam Xie would only live for two more years. In her life before, after Duke Ding passed away, not even two months later, Old Madam Xie also followed.She more or less needed to wait for two more years.In the future, the backyard of Duke Ding Residence would be her reign. In the two years, she must not make any mistake.According to what she knew about Heir Xie these past two years, what Heir Xie felt toward Old Madam Xie and Duke Ding was more of respect and they were not close. Heir Xie was closer to Xie family\u2019s second branch.Yang Shuqing\u2019s heart already had an inclination.Sitting in the main hall, this was the first time Old Madam Xie saw the girl her adopted grandson wanted to marry even though it made him go back on his principles. Anyuan Marquis\u2019 oldest legal daughter was good looking with a clear and beautiful face. Her actions were dignified and magnanimous, making people feel favorable.But after drinking the mystical wine, Old Madam Xie\u2019s eyesight was very good. She saw through the vicious tendencies Yang Shuqing hid deep in her eyes and she could not help but knitted her brows. For the first time, she doubted her adopted grandson\u2019s eyesight.Compared to Anyuan Marquis\u2019 oldest young miss, Old Madam Xie preferred Jiang family\u2019s little lady. Jiang family\u2019s little lady had a special bearing and was clean and pure. She seemed weak and feeble but she was actually stronger and more enduring than anyone else.This kind of woman with a tough and firm personality was very suitable for A\u2019Heng.\u201cNot a bad lady, Yi\u2019er\u2019s eyesight is not bad.\u201d Old Madam Xie smiled and gave a sentence of praise. She let old servant Huang keep the wine and took off a good looking bracelet to give as a meeting present.\u201cThank you for the praise, Old Madam Xie.\u201d Yang Shuqing received the bracelet the old madam sent with a shy face. Her heart was thinking that it seemed that Old Madam Xie\u2019s first impression of her was not bad.Old Madam Xie smiled slightly and sipped her tea.\u201cOld madam, today is my and sir heir\u2019s engagement day, it is not good to see blood. Can sir heir\u2019s punishment\u2026..be done on another day?\u201d Yang Shuqing bit her lip and revealed an unsettled expression to Old Madam Xie as she spoke in embarrassment.Xie Jingyi beside her was stunned. It was obvious he did not think that Yang Shuqing would say this kind of words.\u201cShuqing, father\u2019s words are decisive, don\u2019t make things difficult for grandmother.\u201dFifty wooden staves was not heavy.Xie Jingyi knew his adopted father\u2019s personality, it was usually settled and decisive.Especially when this involved grandmother.Shuqing was making things difficult for grandmother. Once his adopted father knew, he would definitely get angry. Grandmother was adopted father\u2019s reverse scale.A trace of astonishment and wronged expression appeared on Yang Shuqing\u2019s face. Her eyes were slightly red as she said, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see blood on our happy day. I don\u2019t mean to let you escape the punishment.\u201d\u201cI know, but this is father\u2019s command.\u201d Xie Jingyi\u2019s heart was pulled and he stroke her hair naturally, as if he had done it many times.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They had only known each other for a few days, her adopted grandson and Anyuan Marquis\u2019 oldest young miss was too familiar with each other.Suppressing the suspicion and doubt in her heart, Old Madam Xie looked at Butler Zhao below and asked, \u201cButler Zhao, what punishment?\u201dButler Zhao looked at Heir Xie and Oldest Miss Yang and frowned a little. He respectfully told what happened in the gates and after Old Madam Xie heard this, her heart warmed.Her son was venting for Ningbao girl.\u201cLet us speak about this matter after A\u2019Heng came back.\u201d Old Madam Xie muttered after a while.Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes flashed with disappointment, but she still spoke to Old Madam Xie with smiles and did not stop to try to make Old Madam Xie happy. The smile on Old Madam Xie became more intimate.This little lady could deal with people.But her vicious tendencies were too strong, it was not good. But since her adopted grandson liked her, it was hard for Old Madam Xie to say. As long as this little lady could behave well with her grandson, then it should be fine.Even if her adopted grandson would not inherit the duke residence, but with the duke residence\u2019s power and connections, added with her adopted grandson\u2019s skills, he could climb higher and his future would be immeasurable.Xie Jingyi saw his grandmother and his fiancee conversing harmoniously, his heart slightly released a breath as his mouth unconsciously went up. A trace of warm smile flashed through his eyes.They waited for Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s return for an hour. Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes lit up and she stared at Old Madam Xie with a face filled with hope, hoping that Old Madam Xie would placate her.It was indeed not good for blood to spill on her adopted grandson\u2019s engagement day.Old Madam Xie spoke a plea, but the punishment was still executed.There was no room for discussion.Old Madam Xie only spoke a bit and seeing her son not agreeing, she did not say anything else. There was a steelyard in her heart, her biological son was more important than her adopted grandson, especially when this adopted grandson was blinded by emotions.Yang Shuqing\u2019s face sank a bit as she glanced at Xie Jingyi in nervousness, pulling his sleeve with her eyes filled with worry. Xie Jingyi gave Yang Shuqing a gaze of consolation as he swiftly knelt on the ground.The punishment was executed by two black clothed guards.\u201cPah\u2026..Pah\u2026..\u201dXie Jingyi bent over unmoving.The servants in the courtyard were dispatched and it was silent with only the sound of a stick hitting someone\u2019s body.This was Duke Ding taking care of his adopted son\u2019s face.The witnesses of the punishment were only Duke Ding Xie Heng, Butler Zhao, Yang Shuqing, Xie Jingyi\u2019s male servant, and a few black clothed guards.Old Madam Xie\u2019s age was old, it was not good for her to watch punishment being executed.Every hit made Yang Shuqing\u2019s heart to be seized with pain. Her fists were curled and she bit her lower lip as hatred filled her heart. Her eyes had a trace of blood red.Jiang Ningbao\u2026.. Jiang Ningbao\u2026..If it weren\u2019t for her, how could sir heir be punished with this kind of fleshly pain?The humiliation sir heir got today, she would return it a hundred fold in the future.After more than forty staves, there was a little fresh blood trickling out from the dark red gown embroidered with silver threads. Heir Xie\u2019s forehead was drenched with cold sweat as the sweat disappeared into his clothes.\u201cPah\u2026..Pah\u2026..\u201dFifty staves punishment had been executed.Although Xie Jingyi\u2019s body was good, after fifty staves, he still needed a servant to support him to return to the courtyard. Following him, aside from Yang Shuqing whose eyes were red, there was an old doctor well-versed in healing who resided in the Duke Ding Residence.Under the setting sun, Yang Shuqing kept turning her head as she left Duke Ding Residence. After she went in the carriage, her mind was filled with the blood traces on Heir Xie\u2019s body. The hatred she did her utmost to hide burst.\u201cJiang Ningbao!\u201dThe servant girls in the carriage, Qian Rong and Qian Bi, lowered their heads as their fingers trembled non-stop. They did not date to breathe too loud.Once they arrived back to Anyuan Marquis Residence, the residence that basked in a joyful atmosphere was covered by a trace of shadow. When the servants saw their oldest young miss return to the residence, the smile on their faces was a little stiff.Yang Shuqing just noticed the abnormality in the residence and her road was blocked by a few concubine born sisters who deliberately waited for her.Yang Shuqing who already suppressed her anger, now having her road blocked by people who provoked and ridiculed her, immediately displayed her battle prowess. She strung up those few concubine born sisters and felt that she had vented a little.At this time, her servant girl Qian Bi submissively spoke about the news she inquired.Yang Shuqing\u2019s face instantly became black and sullen, feeling stifled.She was about to burst in anger.The things that happened that day was like unconstrained fluctuation. It should be an auspicious day, but she kept meeting trouble, especially her fiance spill blood on their engagement day.How would outsiders see her?Jiang Ningbao was indeed her jinx, there was no good thing when meeting her.Duke Ding was also unreasonable.Delaying for only one day was not alright.Yang Shuqing could not help but resent Duke Ding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he annulled the engagement to be responsible for another girl, others could still understand, but he was ungrateful and perfidious. There were obviously more than one way to settle this but he chose the cruelest one.This made others hard to accept.Anyuan Marquis Residence\u2019s Oldest Young Miss became the femme fatale in everybody\u2019s mouth. There was also secret news that Oldest Young Miss\u2019 eight characters did not match with Heir Xie\u2019s.If it weren\u2019t for Oldest Miss Yang not letting the matter go, everyone wouldn\u2019t have known that the reason why Jiang fourth miss was engaged with Heir Xie was because of the debt of life-saving with the intention of knotting two families.No wonder they were so careful that they made notarized marriage certificates.Everyone once more pitied Jiang fourth miss.Duke Ding\u2019s act of leading black clothed guards to escort Jiang fourth miss back to the residence today was probably to back her up. Everyone made a realization and at the same time, there was a trace of disappointment.They thought that Jiang fourth miss and Duke Ding would get together.They were excited for nothing.The rumors were explosive.\u201cIs there anyone who felt that Oldest Miss Yang;s eight characters jinx husband?\u201d\u201cJinx or not, I don\u2019t know, but hindering is already indisputable. If that day, she did not make a ruckus, no one knew that Heir Xie and Xie second madam were once saved by Jiang fourth miss\u2019s mother and Heir Xie\u2019s reputation won\u2019t fall to the ground.\u201d\u201cBrother, you\u2019re right. Oldest Miss Yang may be hindering or maybe her eight characters are not suitable with Heir Xie\u2019s.\u201d\u201cJiang fourth miss is morally outstanding. She was bullied to annul her engagement and her reputation ruined, but she still did not reveal this matter. It was because she was kept being questioned by Oldest Miss Yang who just got engaged with Heir Xie did she reveal this old matter. Time, life, can change.\u201d\u201cWho knew if the act of saving lives is real or not. Maybe it\u2019s just Jiang fourth miss talking nonsense and deliberately wanting to ruin Heir Xie\u2019s reputation.\u201d Someone spoke in disagreement.\u201cHeir Xie admitted it himself and Duke Ding also acknowledged this. I believe in Duke Ding\u2019s moral standing. This matter must be true.\u201d\u201cChih, it may even be Jiang fourth miss\u2019 mother scheming this to climb onto Xie family.\u201d That person still did not give up on blackening Jiang fourth miss and her mother.The people present all turned to that person with gazes filled with detest.\u201cYou\u2019re really narrow-minded. You are dark and gloomy so you see everyone as dark and gloomy. It was obviously Xie second madam who proposed the engagement and the one annulling it was Heir Xie. What does it have to do with Jiang family\u2019s second madam?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I see that he\u2019s either Xie family\u2019s second madam\u2019s person or Oldest Miss Yang\u2019s person.\u201d\u201cYou may be right!\u201dUnder the disgusted gazes of the others, that person sneaked off.\u201cSaying this much, does anyone feel the fact that Heir Xie who is usually cold and distant to girls suddenly rescuing Oldest Miss Yang, then liking Oldest Miss Yang, very strange?\u201dOnce these words were spoken, the others were shocked. That was right. The brilliant and admirable Heir Xie, from the moment he rescued Oldest Miss Yang, was madly infatuated with her as if he was bewitched.It was too strange.\u201cIt is indeed strange. Heir Xie\u2019s personality, no matter how you look at it, is not like someone who can fall in love at first sight and won\u2019t go back on his principles, biting the hand that fed him, just for a girl he just knew. There must be something more to it.\u201d\u201cThere must be some secrets!\u201d\u201cDoes everyone still remember someone saying that Heir Xie and Oldest Miss Yang had known each other for a long time? I feel that this is the most reasonable. If not, then it cannot be explained.\u201d\u201cMaybe someone planted gu in Heir Xie or he was plotted against using insidious methods.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dEveryone brainstormed the plot and guessed every possible scenario. In the end, everyone agreed that the two of them had secretly interacted with each other before.Without Yang Shuqing and Heir Xie knowing it, this rumor had spread all over the place.The bunch of them continued their discussion and their topics went to whether or not Jiang fourth miss could get married to Duke Ding. Speaking about this, they, the gossiping bunch, hoped that Jiang fourth miss could.Duke Ding\u2019s marriage was something everyone in Dayue Dynasty paid attention to.Even enemy countries paid attention to this,They waited year by year. In those years, there were rumors of a few girls who liked Duke Ding but there was no continuation. The ones who like Duke Ding all got married to other people and until now, Duke Ding had not got married.On the second floor of a certain wine shop, a handsome and amorous youth with red lips and white teeth was leaning on the railing. He held a cup and waved it. As he heard the discussions below, he smiled happily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He remembered that the little king was very interested in Oldest Miss Yang before, even had the intention of marrying Oldest Miss Yang as his legal wife.Now he actually told his men to spread rumors that Oldest Miss Yang hindered her husband and that she and Heir Xie had known each other for a long time. The guard was a little confused with the little king\u2019s action.Little King Xiao Ran laughed and cast a sidelong glance at the guard. He spoke carelessly.\u201cReal and fake, who knew? Just enjoy.\u201dThe guard was stunned and asked carefully, \u201cMaster, don\u2019t you like Oldest Miss Yang? This kind of rumor can hurt Oldest Miss Yang\u2019s reputation.\u201dLittle king Xiao Ran sipped his wine and his pretty peach blossom eyes flashed with a trace of gloominess. He laughed coldly, \u201cGrandpa no longer likes her. There are many beautiful people, she\u2019s not the only one.\u201dYang Shuqing acted as if she was refusing him with stern righteousness but schemed him in the dark. Thinking of the things he did for her because he was interested, the little king felt that he was really blind.If she asked for his help honestly, he would be happy to help, definitely not being schemed in the dark like this.Once he thought that every time he helped her, it had high probability of the results of her schemes, little king Xiao Ran had no good feeling toward Yang Shuqing, he even secretly felt disgust.Guard: \u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cTalking about this, growing up, I\u2019ve seen various beauties, but it\u2019s still Jiang fourth miss who suits my taste the most. A pity I can\u2019t do anything toward her. If not, I really want to propose to Changning Count Residence.\u201d Little king Xiao Ran\u2019s peach blossom eyes flashed with a trace of pity.Saying this and that, the little king Xiao Ran who liked beauties still could not forget Jiang Ningbao who he had only met once.Guard: \u201c\u2026..\u201dThe little king\u2019s backyard already had one hundred and seven beauties, still diligently collecting various beauties. If it weren\u2019t for King Rui Residence being big enough, how could it fit so many beauties?Fortunately, the little king could not forget Jiang fourth miss. If not, the residence would have another addition of beauties. They, these personal guards who followed the little king to collect various beauties, were also very tired.They were thankful for Jiang fourth miss. Having Jiang fourth miss, this gem, at the front, the little king\u2019s standard increased by a lot and many beauties could not enter his eyes. These few days they met a few beauties who wanted to climb onto the little king, the little king directly ignored them. Before, he won\u2019t refuse those who came to him.Without Jiang Ningbao knowing it, she got the gratitude of the guards belonging to the little king.\u2026..Changning Count ResidenceFirst Madam Zhang suddenly became unwell, as her niece, Jiang Ningbao had to visit her. First Madam Zhang not welcoming her was one thing, but her etiquette could not leave a mistake to be discussed.Before going out of the room, Jiang Ningbao changed her clothes to a simple but elegant flowering crabapple skirt with very light blue embroidery. Then, she took Chun Xi to the main courtyard.Bai Mei and the other three servants silently stared at the fourth lady leaving, their hearts were anxious.The task first madam gave them was not easy to do.Fourth lady never trusted them and she only had Chun Xi as her servant girl. Every time she went out, she would lock the door and lock all important things. They had never seen such a cautious lady.In the hall of the main courtyard, it was filled with people.Changning Count Jiang Dongming, eldest male cousin Jiang Zhuo, second male cousin Jiang Yue, fifth sister Jiang Mingyao, and other concubine born brothers and sisters with their mothers.What made Jiang Ningbao knit her brows was an unfamiliar man.This man wore a blue gown and seemed to be eighteen or nineteen years old. He had fine features and appeared dignified. He was sitting with oldest male cousin Jiang Zhuo and seemed to be a relative of Changning Count Residence.A few around twelve to thirteen concubine born sisters silently glanced at him from time to time with gazes carrying bashfulness.Once Jiang Ningbao entered the hall, a few gazes settled on her, one of which belonged to the unfamiliar man. He fixedly stared at her white and delicate face with eyes that did not hide how attracted he was.Jiang Ningbao knitted her brows and her eyes flashed with unhappiness.This man\u2019s gaze was wanton.\u201cNiece greets the oldest uncle.\u201d Jiang Ningbao stepped forward and greeted Changning Count.\u201cYes, sit down here.\u201dChangning Count Jiang Dongming gave her a smile and his tone was genial. This niece was always making trouble recently. Changning Count did not like this niece very much. The only thing that comforted him was that after annulling her engagement, she still could cling onto Duke Ding Residence.This made Changning Count give her special treatment and gave her a genial smile.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s beautiful eyes flashed. This oldest uncle was someone who would work for profit.He\u2019s actually giving her a genial smile.How rare.After her parents met with \u2018mishap\u2019, this oldest uncle never gave her or her older brother any smile. One New Year of other festivals, he would only indifferently say a few sentences. The treatment was vastly different compared to when her parents were there.It seemed that Duke Ding Residence, this signboard, had really strong attraction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A pretty servant girl came over to pour her a cup of tea.The few concubines from the first branch and the children they bore all glanced at Jiang Ningbao with jealousy and envy.Legitimate born was good.Especially this fourth lady who had the generous dowry of the second branch\u2019s madam. The output and input every year could be summed into a very abundant wealth.No wonder the first madam would put her sight on this fourth lady.Old Madam Jiang of Changning Count Residence placed great importance on legitimate and illegitimate, and she was a control freak, managing a household in a very strict manner. Even First Madam Zhang could only dare to do only petty tricks in the dark, while the concubines and their children could not enter the old madam\u2019s eyes. No matter how Changning Count favored them, he still did not dare to let them overstep the boundaries.But their food and their clothes were not bad.Jiang Ningbao ignored the gazes of the first branch\u2019s illegitimate children and smiled toward her fifth sister, Jiang Mingyao. The one thing that she was most satisfied about Changning Count Residence was that the annoying things were little and the intrigue was all done in private.Aside from the people who used the title of elders, no one dared to annoy her.\u201cOldest uncle, I heard that grandmother and oldest aunt had invited Buddhist great masters into the residence. Are grandmother and oldest aunt alright?\u201d Jiang Ningbao asked with a face full of concern although she was actually speechless in her heart. The group of people stayed in the main hall and oldest uncle\u2019s concubines all glanced seductively. No one went into the first madam\u2019s room to see.Even Madam Zhang\u2019s children were like that.Actually, Jiang Ningbao did not know because she came late that everyone had entered to see First Madam Zhang. Seeing her alright, only frightened because of the invasion of the ominous energy as she lay on the bed trembling and feeling unwell, they all did not stay in the room.Coincidentally, it was time for dinner. Because of that, the first branch\u2019s concubines and the illegitimate children did not leave, preparing to eat dinner with Changning Count.This was a rare chance to gather.Changning Count Jiang Dongming glanced at the culprit, his niece, and saw her unsettled expression. His brows eased at that.\u201cYour grandmother is alright. Tomorrow, your oldest aunt will go to the temple to stay for a while.\u201dJiang Ningbao revealed a relieved expression and the restlessness between her brows disappeared. She released her breath, \u201cIt\u2019s good that grandmother and oldest aunt are alright. If not, this niece will feel restless and won\u2019t be able to eat and sleep peacefully.\u201dChangning Count Jiang Dongming looked at his niece deeply and spoke faintly.\u201cYou are not to blame for this matter. It\u2019s just your oldest aunt seeking trouble.\u201dJiang Ningbao : \u201c\u2026..\u201dThese words were spoken too direct. The concubines of the first branch heard the oldest uncle\u2019s words and expressions of gloating over others\u2019 suffering appearing on their faces while only her two male cousins\u2019 expressions changed.She noticed that this oldest uncle was callous. There was no shred of care or worry in his eyes. It was obvious that he did not have any emotion toward his oldest aunt.But Jiang Ningbao did not feel empathy toward Madam Zhang.Jiang Mingyao looked at the soft and gentle fourth sister with a complicated gaze. She knew that her mother must have been attacked by the ominous energy contained within the sutra Duke Ding made and this was not the fourth sister\u2019s fault, but her heart still felt uncomfortable.So she did not speak with Jiang Ningbao.A few days after not meeting each other, the fourth sister changed to be more dazzling. The matter of engagement annulment did not affect the fourth sister in the slightest. At the same time, she distanced herself to her. Jiang Mingyao pursed her lips and averted her gaze.At this time, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s oldest male cousin Jiang Zhuo patted the shoulder of the male beside him. He smiled as he spoke, \u201cFourth sister, come, let me introduce to you. This one is my cousin Zhang Zhan. You can call him Cousin Zhan. He will live in the residence for a few days.\u201d\u201cJiang fourth miss, I\u2019ve heard of you before. I am Zhang Zhan.\u201d The refined and good-looking man smiled and introduced himself with politeness. His heart was very satisfied.This Jiang fourth miss was pretty and her background was good. She also had generous dowry.No one was more suitable to be his wife than her.Aunt really chose a good one for him.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s expression was faint and she was polite and distant, \u201cHello, Sir Zhang.\u201dSurname Zhang and also Jiang Zhuo\u2019s cousin. It seemed that this was First Madam Zhang\u2019s maternal nephew.Wait a moment. Zhang Zhan, this name felt familiar.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart was surprised. Wasn\u2019t this Zhang Zhan someone who was related to Jiang Ningbao? She once more browsed through the transmigrator\u2019s memories and finally found the materials of this Zhang Zhan.\u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 in the book did not agree to annul the engagement and kept on getting entangled with the male lead Xie Jingyi. She also framed the female lead. While the female lead acted as if she was enduring it and made concessions, the female lead secretly made an alliance with First Madam Zhang to deal with \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019. Zhang Zhan was an important pawn in this.He was the legitimate son of First Madam Zhang\u2019s oldest brother. Madam Zhang\u2019s maternal house was poverty-stricken and they ate next year\u2019s food. \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 had a big dowry and Madam Zhang had long wanted to scheme against \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 but she was afraid of the Duke Ding Residence, so she did nothing.And then, with Anyuan Marqui\u2019s oldest legitimate daughter\u2019s support, Madam Zhang became gutsy.She used Zhang Zhan to ruin \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019s\u2019 innocence, forcing \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 to get married to her maternal nephew. \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 was not willing. Even though \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019\u2019s innocence was gone, she was not willing to get married.But male lead Xie Jingyi used this opportunity to forcefully annul the engagement with the excuse of \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 losing her innocence and got engaged with Yang Shuqing. This made \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 completely crumble apart.She did not think that Zhang Zhan would appear ahead of time.Jiang Ningbao laughed coldly in her heart. It seemed that after she annulled her engagement, oldest aunt Madam Zhang kept thinking about her dowry. What living in the residence for a few days, they probably wanted to ruin her innocence and force her to get married.What a good scheme.She was not the book\u2019s \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019, but the characters related to \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 kept on coming..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His eyes flashed and he looked at his cousin Jiang Zhuo. Jiang Zhuo silently moved his mouth toward Changning Count\u2019s direction, telling him to remain calm.Zhang Zhan nodded slightly.\u201cOldest uncle, I will visit my oldest aunt.\u201d The gazes full of tender feelings Zhang Zhan sent her once in a while made Jiang Ningbao feel disgusted. Seeing the sky about to go dark, almost time for dinner, she could not help but say.She did not want to eat dinner with this bunch of people.\u201cFourth sister, I will go with you.\u201d The cool and cold Jiang Mingyao suddenly spoke.Changning Count Jiang Dongming nodded without care. \u201cYes, you go together. Looking is good.\u201d After that, he called a servant girl who led his niece and Yao\u2019er over.The few concubine born sisters saw Jiang Ningbao left and they secretly heaved a sigh of relief with gazes filled with happiness. With the fourth sister present, Cousin Zhan was attracted to her, he won\u2019t pay attention to them.Jiang Ningbao and Jiang Mingyao went to the main room together with Chun Xi and another servant girl behind them.The two of them followed the leading servant soundlessly. Jiang Mingyao opened her mouth but did not say anything. Old servant Yang saw the fourth lady came and her face sank as her voice carried a trace of coldness.\u201cFourth lady, fifth lady, the madam is asleep. Please go back.\u201dJiang Ningbao saw this and looked at the tightly shut door. Her voice was soft and gentle, \u201cSince my oldest aunt is asleep, then I will not disturb. I will visit my oldest aunt another day.\u201d\u201cFourth lady does not need to come anymore. Tomorrow, the madam will go to the temple for a few days.\u201d Old servant Yang stiffened her old face and spoke coldly.Jiang Ningbao nodded slightly and turned to leave.Jiang Mingyao who kept silent at the side finally could not help but speak, her voice was still cool and cold, \u201cFourth sister, you obviously know that the sutra carries ominous energy, why didn\u2019t you stop mother from opening it?\u201dJiang Ningbao stopped her steps and looked at Jiang Mingyao. From Jiang Mingyao\u2019s eyes, she could see a trace of resentment. She smiled faintly, \u201cFifth sister, you resent me?\u201dJiang Mingyao stayed silent.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of disappointment. That\u2019s right. She had the intention to trick her oldest aunt, but she had reminded her before. If the oldest aunt trusted her words, she could not trick the oldest aunt.Maybe she was wrong. Right now, she was not the book\u2019s \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 and Jiang Mingyao was not the book\u2019s Jiang Mingyao.\u201cFifth sister, it\u2019s better if we distance ourselves. Chun Xi, let\u2019s go back.\u201dAfter saying this, Jiang Ningbao did not look at Jiang Mingyao and sent a servant girl to tell Changning Count. She returned to the courtyard for dinner and turned to leave the main courtyard with Chun Xi.People who had different principles would walk different paths. Jiang Ningbao was not the type to wrong herself. The crueler first madam\u2019s schemes were, she and Jiang Mingyao would one day become strangers.Jiang Mingyao stared at the fourth sister\u2019s leaving figure. Her bright pupils dimmed and the servant girl beside her looked at the fifth lady in worry.\u201cFifth lady, you should have less contact with the fourth lady. She schemed against the madam today, she would scheme against the lady in the future.\u201d Not knowing when, Old servant Yang suddenly came beside Jiang Mingyao.\u201cFourth sister is not that kind of person.\u201d Jiang Mingyao hesitated and rebutted.Old servant Yang heard this and was worried. Fifth lady actually trusted the fourth lady this much.\u201cFifth lady, you don\u2019t know a person\u2019s heart. Don\u2019t forget that your good engagement is gotten through stepping on fourth lady. Fourth lady seems soft and weak, but her heart is cruel.\u201dJiang Mingyao pursed her lips and her cool face flashed a little shaking.When Jiang Ningbao returned to her courtyard, the sky was dark and the residence had hung up lanterns. The wind blew softly, carrying a trace of coldness.Bai Mei and the other servant girls waited by the door.Chun Xi entered the room first, lighting up the candles inside the room and then went to the kitchen to get dinner. After dinner, taking a bath, and drying the hair, it was already 7 to 9 o\u2019clock at night. Chun Xi was tidying the bed.The candle light in the room shook. Jiang Ningbao\u2019s long hair was spread and she wore loose clothing as she looked at the window.Recalling Zhang Zhan who she met in the main hall and thinking about the four servant girls First Madam Zhang sent, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes shone with coldness like ice.Fortunately, she had long guarded against those four servant girls and her private belongings were locked in the boxes. Even the key to the gates of the courtyard was given to Chun Xi, only letting them to do some menial tasks.\u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 in the book getting schemed was because she was not careful enough. There was no one she could trust by her side and her older brother Jiang Jin got his legs broken that time, letting Madam Zhang have the opportunity. If not, Madam Zhang would not be able to pull it off easily.Setting a private meeting in her own courtyard with a man and getting caught by the mass.Jiang Ningbao laughed coldly. Madam Zhang\u2019s schemes were cruel enough.\u201cLady, the bed is already tidy.\u201dJiang Ningbao snapped her thought and walked over. She took off the clogs and laid on the bed, sleeping not long after. Chun Xi pulled the curtain and blew off the candles. She left with light steps.The night was cool like water, dark night enveloped the land.Duke Ding Residence Main CourtyardDuke Ding Xie Heng laid on the bed expressionlessly. He thought to his mother who would go to the palace to ask for a marriage decree tomorrow and his heart rose with ripples. He turned to his side and had difficulty sleeping.He rubbed the Buddhist bracelets he wore and his mind could not help but think of the little lady\u2019s soft and beautiful smile and the conversation they had.\u201cWhy don\u2019t I become your wife\u2026..become your wife\u2026..\u201dSonorous voice kept on repeating in his mind.Tonight, Duke Ding Xie Heng had a rare insomnia and could not sleep for the whole night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The flowers, grass, and the leaves on the trees were dripping with water droplets. The air was filled with moisture.Duke Ding Xie Heng, who could not sleep, rose early and washed himself. He changed to a clothes of black robe and practiced martial arts in the empty space in the courtyard. His movements were sharp and fast, his figure was strong and vigorous, his steps were deep and stable, and his whole body was exuding a stern air.After Duke Ding finished practicing martial arts, he was brimming with energy and seemed bright. The sky had gone bright.Old Madam Xie sent people to invite Duke Ding for breakfast. The breakfast should be for three people, but after Xie Jingyi was punished with fifty wooden staves and kneeling in the ancestral hall for three days, his meals were sent to his room.Thriving Joy HallOld Madam Xie and Duke Ding conversed after eating breakfast.\u201cA\u2019Heng, I\u2019ve thought about it yesterday night and decided to go to the palace first to get the marriage decree for you and Ningbao girl and then go to the Clear Water Temple after.\u201d Old Madam Xie drank the bowl of tea old servant Huang gave and smiled as she spoke.Duke Ding Xie Heng heard his mother mentioning the little lady and could not help but recall his insomnia, his head was full of that lady\u2019s smile and voice. His cold and handsome face flashed with uneasiness, \u201cMother decides it.\u201dOld Madam Xie\u2019s smile turned deeper.Yesterday night, the more she thought, the more she felt that getting the girl first was better.Who knew what would happen if they were a step late?Ningbao girl\u2019s marriage was decided by Old Madam Jiang and Changning Countess.From what Old Madam Xie knew of these two, if someone who had a background that was not bad, they might agree.Around nine to eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, a bunch of guards escorted Old Madam Xie as she left Duke Ding Residence and went to the direction of the palace.One could see how anxious Old Madam Xie was.After Old Madam Xie left the residence, Duke Ding Xie Heng prepared to go to the Western Suburbs out of habit, but once he thought of his mother\u2019s words, his foot stopped and he turned back to the courtyard. Butler Zhao who followed with a distance silently released a breath.After the decree was given, Sir Duke would be someone who had a wife too. He had to adjust and could not stay at the Western Suburbs from day to night.He needed to grow feelings with Jiang fourth miss so they could have a child earlier and gave the duke residence heir, lest it fell onto outsider\u2019s hands.Butler Zhao was worried for Sir Duke as he walked.Changning Count ResidenceJiang Ningbao who was thought about had a good sleep. Once she woke up, her whole body seemed glowing. After rinsing, she chose a random hair tie to tie her hair and draping outside clothes, she walked to the window. She pushed the window and her flashed with a surprise.There was rain yesterday night and water droplets were present on the flowers and tree leaves. The morning air blew in, carrying humidity.Within it was coldness.\u201cLady, the morning wind is big, careful to not get a cold. This servant will close the windows.\u201d Chun Xi carried a box of food as she entered. She saw her lady standing by the window and could not help but chatter. After putting the breakfast on the table, she took a pouch with a stem of plum blossom and gave it to her lady.\u201cLady, this servant met the fifth lady\u2019s trusted servant girl on the way. She gave this servant a pouch, saying that the fifth lady gave this.\u201dJiang Ningbao moved to the side of the table and took the pouch. There was a letter inside. She took it out and the words were fifth sister\u2019s, Jiang Mingyao\u2019s, writing, graceful and pretty.After seeing it, Jiang Ningbao kept the letter and her face flashed with a trace of complexity and then she sighed.Jiang Ningbao was still that good lady with normal moral views, but her heart inclined to First Madam Zhang because she was her biological mother. Her biological mother suddenly got sick because of the sutra Duke Ding made, it was normal that her heart had resentment.After a night, Jiang Mingyao thought it through. Fish and bear paw could not unite. The conflicts between first branch and second branch was not something that could vanish just because of a few words. Moreover, Madam Zhang agreed with all her might for the engagement annulment that time.The guilt in her heart won.Jiang Mingyao decided to do as Jiang Ningbao said, only contacting Jiang Ningbao a little, being a little closer than strangers.Actually, Jiang Mingyao was just a sixteen years old little lady and was raised to be innocent by Madam Zhang. Her personality was good, but Jiang Ningbao had expected too high from Jiang Mingyao so she felt disappointed.Moreover, she still did not know that her own mother was scheming for her fourth sister\u2019s dowry.\u201cBeing just acquainted is good.\u201d\u201cLady, are you alright?\u201d Chun Xi closed the window and looked at her silent lady. She could not help but ask in worry.Jiang Ningbao smiled and said, \u201cNothing, only sighing with emotion.\u201d After saying this, she started to eat breakfast. Today\u2019s breakfast was chicken shred bird nest soup, crispy fritter, vegetable filled stuffed bun, and fried dumpling. They were simple and delicate, making one\u2019s appetite grow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Old Madam Jiang who just had her breakfast heard that fourth girl was coming and the smile on her face stiffened. A moment later, she said, \u201cLet her in.\u201dOnce Jiang Ningbao came in, she greeted Old Madam Jiang, \u201cGreeting grandmother.\u201dOld Madam Jiang\u2019s eyelid twitches and her tone was indifferent as she asked, \u201cFourth girl, come over and sit. Why have you come today?\u201dJiang Ningbao sat below Old Madam Jiang and Hong Xing at the side poured her tea. Her plum lips pursed and the hand holding the cup tightened. Her eyes were a bit dodgy as it revealed a trace of fear. After a moment of hesitation, she bit her lips.\u201cGrandmother, granddaughter had a terrifying nightmare yesterday night.\u201dOld Madam Jiang frowned and spoke unhappily, \u201cMaking a fuss about nothing. It\u2019s only a nightmare, who never had a nightmare?\u201d This fourth girl came over early in the morning just to say that she had a nightmare. Old Madam Jiang\u2019s face was full of unhappiness.Now, once she saw fourth girl, she would feel stifled.Old Madam Jiang was clear on Madam Zhang\u2019s condition and until now, her heart was still thinking about it. She did not have a good sleep yesterday. Not only once did she feel it was fortunate that Madam Zhang stole the chance to open the Buddhist sutra, if not\u2026.. If not, the one lying on the bed would be her.Living up to this age, Old Madam Jiang cherished her life very much.Her heart disliked fourth girl, but she detested Madam Zhang even more.Fortunately, Madam Zhang lifted a rock to smash her feet.Jiang Ningbao lifted her head to look at the servants in the Golden Longevity Hall. Her pair of beautiful eyes revealed deep worry, \u201cGrandmother, this nightmare is different, it concerns the oldest uncle.\u201dOnce Old Madam Jiang heard that it was related to her oldest son, her eyes looked at her granddaughter in suspicion. In the end, she gestured for the servants to get away and only left her trusted servant, Hong Xing. She stared fixedly on Jiang Ningbao, \u201cFourth girl, speak, how is this nightmare different?\u201d\u201cGrandmother, I dreamed that\u2026..that oldest uncle was strangled by a big snake\u2026..\u201dOld Madam Jiang\u2019s eyes contracted, \u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cAnd then\u2026..And then because the oldest uncle was squeezed too tightly by this big snake, he fainted and did not wake up for a long time. And then this big snake suddenly changed into Sir Zhang Zhan\u2019s figure, then granddaughter woke up in fear.\u201dJiang Ningbao clutched at the small teacup. The more she spoke, she paler and the more terrified her face was.Changning Count Jiang Dongming suddenly fainting was only described a little in the novel. It happened half a month after Duke Ding Residence visited to annul \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019s\u2019 engagement. It was only a few days from now.Jiang Ningbao formulated a plan. First, manufacture and dig a pit for Zhang Zhan, lest Madam Zhang made a raft out of it like in the novel and schemed a play to entrap her older brother Jiang Jin.Cut off his road of imperial examination.Before the provincial examination, what one should abstain the most was diverting one\u2019s attention. Madam Zhang knew that her older brother was smart and had the most chance to get pass, so she caused problems to trouble her older brother, letting him unable to focus. In the novel, \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019 was used several times to give blows to her older brother Jiang Jin by Madam Zhang.What Jiang Ningbao wanted to do was to prevent those problems.Zhang Zhan had impure intentions from the start. One who had such impure intention to scheme for her dowry, Jiang Ningbao did not have any guilt in scheming against him.If he did not appear before her, Jiang Ningbao would only ignore his existence.But it was different now.Zhang Zhan already had such ideas.Thinking of the gazes Zhang Zhan used to look at her, it was obvious that he had thought of her as his belonging. Jiang Ningbao felt disgust at that.Old Madam Jiang believed in such abstruse things. Maybe she won\u2019t believe it now, but after Changning Count fainted all of a sudden and no reason was found, Old Madam Jiang would think of this dream she had.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s only a dream, you should go back.\u201dOld Madam Jiang was indeed half-believing and half-doubting. She put the small teacup on to the tea table with an ugly expression. Anyone who heard that someone dreamed of one\u2019s eldest son squeezed faint by a big snake won\u2019t have a good expression.\u201cGranddaughter withdraws.\u201dJiang Ningbao rose and bowed to Old Madam Jiang. Before leaving, she said, \u201cGrandmother, granddaughter hopes that this was only an ordinary nightmare.\u201dAfter saying that, she left Golden Longevity Hall.After Jiang Ningbao left, Old Madam Jiang\u2019s eyes sunk. She was confused and uncertain as she said, \u201cHong Xin, what do you think is the meaning behind the fourth girl\u2019s dream? Wait, send someone to ask about which animal Madam Zhang\u2019s maternal nephew was born.\u201dOld Madam Jiang was the first to know about Zhang Zhan\u2019s arrival and she knew that fourth girl had only met Madam Zhang\u2019s maternal nephew once yesterday night.But now, the fourth girl actually had such a nightmare.Old Madam Jiang could not help but be terribly suspicious.Hong Xing immediately sent someone to inquire about Zhang Zhan and around fifteen minutes later, they had Zhang Zhan\u2019s information.\u201cOld madam, Sir Zhang Zhan was born under the snake year.\u201dOld Madam Jiang\u2019s mind was shocked and the hand gripping the teacup tightened abruptly..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This dream was a bad omen.\u201cOld madam, Sir Zhang Zhan will live in the residence for a few days. Do you want to send people to escort him back to the Zhang family?\u201d Hong Xing was good at reading others\u2019 expressions and she asked carefully.\u201cLet some people watch him first.\u201dOld Madam Jiang felt lucky in her heart. Maybe fourth girl\u2019s nightmare was only a nightmare.Coming out of Golden Longevity Hall, Jiang Ningbao had on a brilliant smile. This smile was coincidentally seen by Zhang Zhan who was not far from her. His eyes carried astonishment and a determination to have flashed through his eyes. As long as he married Jiang fourth miss, he could have both money and beauty. This kind of good matter, Zhang Zhan thanked his aunt not only once in his heart.He was about to go over when a little lady wearing a pink dress barred his way. The lady was the first branch\u2019s concubine born daughter and was favored by Changning Count. From the moment she saw Zhang Zhan, she had liked him.The small road was a little wet and Jiang Ningbao who did not know that someone almost blocked her road lifted her skirt and went to the main courtyard.\u201cLady, you seem to be happy?\u201d Chun Xi asked in curiosity.\u201cYes, once I think of the possibility that Old Madam Xie would enter the palace for a marriage decree, I feel happy.\u201d Jiang Ningbao smiled and did not speak of her plan to scheme against Zhang Zhan.\u201cSpeaking of Old Madam Xie, I miss Duke Ding a bit. I wonder if he\u2019s in the residence right now? I\u2019ve promised him that I will send him a few earthen jugs of medicinal wine. If he is in the residence, I decided to visit personally to appear more sincere.\u201dJiang Ningbao spoke as she walked.Chun Xi, who was following behind her, had her jaw dropping. \u201c\u2026..\u201dLady, what about your restraint?\u201cRight, Chun Xi, go and tell Manager Yao today to gather more herbs. I want to brew some medicinal wines.\u201d Jiang Ningbao thought of something and suddenly ordered.\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d Chun Xi immediately answered.People scurried around in the main courtyard. Old servant Yang was busy ordering the other servants to put the luggage on the carriage. When she saw Jiang Ningbao coming over, her face immediately sank.\u201cFourth lady, the madam is unwell. You should go back.\u201dJiang Ningbao was not angry. After asking about First Madam Zhang, she stood at the side with Chun Xi and did not leave. Actually, she came here only to put on an act to show the outsiders.Of course, she could not leave just after Old servant Yang said a sentence. Others could easily make this a subject of ridicule.Old servant Yang could not help but glare at her, her heart was thinking that this fourth miss was really hard to get rid of. No wonder the four clever servants girls could not even do a simple matter.She misjudged her in the past.After around a quarter of an hour, First Madam Zhang sat on the carriage lifted by the servants. Jiang Ningbao stared at her and was surprised. She did not think that after only a night, Madam Zhang who was attacked by the ominous energy seemed to change. The thick make-up could not hide her thinness and her pallidness. She seemed dispirited and listless, leaning on the small carriage with no energy, as if she had aged ten years in a single night.Jiang Ningbao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dThe might of the ominous energy seemed to be bigger than expected.No wonder Madam Zhang wanted to live in the temple for a while. Only the eminent monk in the temple could drive out the cold ominous energy. If not, in less than three days, Madam Zhang would be incomparably weak and would stay sick on the bed.There was also another possibility that Madam Zhang\u2019s body was weak to begin with and with the attack of the ominous energy, it became this severe.Jiang Ningbao leaned on the second possibility.As time flew, the people visiting the main courtyard increased.Changning Count Jiang Dongming, Jiang Zhuo, Jiang Yue, and Zhang Zhan who temporarily resided in the count residence. There were also the first branch\u2019s concubines and their children, all there to send off Madam Zhang.Jiang Mingyao also came, being clustered by a bunch of servants. Her face was cool and only when she looked at Madam Zhang did a trace of worry appeared in her eyes.Jiang Ningbao and Jiang Mingyao met eye to eye and averted their gazes.Old servant Yang saw this scene and was relieved in her heart. It seemed that fifth lady listened to her words. Now, she did not need to worry of her being schemed by fourth lady.Madam should rest assured.When the carriage arrived, it was already around eleven o\u2019clock. First Madam Zhang carelessly noticed that within the group that sent her off, there was a slim and graceful figure. When she saw Jiang Ningbao, First Madam Zhang cracked and hatred rushed in her heart.A pity that Madam Zhang could do nothing at that moment, only glaring coldly at Jiang Ningbao.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s mouth curved and she happily waved her hand toward First Madam Zhang.Oldest aunt seemed to hate her very much.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This shocked the servant girls by her side as they immediately supported her and gave her nerve calming tea.After the first madam\u2019s carriage left, Jiang Ningbao greeted her oldest uncle and slightly nodded her head toward Jiang Mingyao. She turned and went back to her own courtyard with quick and light steps. Who knew that in the middle, she would meet her oldest male cousin Jiang Zhuo and Zhang Zhan.\u201cFourth sister, what a coincidence. Are you going back to your courtyard?\u201d Oldest male cousin Jiang Zhuo asked with a smile and led his cousin Zhang Zhan to block her road.\u201cJiang fourth miss, we meet again.\u201d Zhang Zhan was dignified in appearance and his figure was tall. His brows carried a smile and he seemed suave, letting out an air belonging to a scholar.Just because of his face, it was easy for little ladies to like.The few concubine born daughters of the first branch were like that.But he was not the type Jiang Ningbao liked. Jiang Ningbao was indifferent even toward the male lead Xie Jingyi who had that kind of superior looks and air and annulled the engagement just like that. Don\u2019t even mention this kind of weak scholar.Especially when this weak scholar was a brute with impure motive.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s brows knitted and her eyes flashed with a dark light. Her hands subconsciously rubbed the red whip on her hip. She suddenly felt that her hand was itching to do something.Chun Xi stared nervously at the side. Vigilance filled her eyes.\u201cOldest cousin, Sir Zhang, why are you here?\u201d Jiang Ningbao smiled slightly and asked the obvious. This road was the road to her courtyard and the people around were little. These two blocked the road with her as the objective.\u201cWe waited specially for fourth sister here.\u201d Jiang Zhuo\u2019s face was not bad but his aptitude was mundane. He had participated in many examinations but never passed. Fortunately, he was the oldest legal son so he would inherit the position of Changning Count.Speaking of this, Jiang Ningbao seldom sees this oldest male cousin.\u201cWhy does oldest cousin search for this little sister?\u201d Jiang Ningbao squinted her bright eyes and asked softly.\u201cCough, cough. Actually, this is nothing big. Fourth sister, what do you think of Cousin Zhan? He\u2019s from Dongping Count Residence and will inherit Dongping Count Residence one day. Not only that, Cousin Zhan is like a third brother, already having scholarly honor at a young age. He\u2019s also handsome and will participate in the provincial examination this year. He has a big chance to pass the provincial imperial examination.\u201dJiang Zhuo seemed to praise Zhang Zhan without holding back, but his heart felt stifled.Although the two were similarly degrading count residences, Changning Count Residence was much better than Dongping Count Residence. His fifth sister was engaged to Xie family\u2019s second branch and his oldest sister was married into a marquis residence, although she was not the wife of the heir, but her husband was the legal sibling with the heir. The concubine born second sister and third sister married into rich merchant families. It could be said that the first branch was rising.Dongping Count Residence only had one Zhang Zhan. No one knew if he could handle the count residence.If it weren\u2019t for his mother secretly helping her maternal family, Dongping Count Residence would have long lost its face.In front of Zhang Zhan, Jiang Zhuo had a sense of superiority.\u201cJiang fourth miss, from the first time I saw you, I like you. Are you willing to be my wife?\u201d Zhang Zhan\u2019s voice was clear and his pair of eyes emit a trace of softness, giving others a subtle impression of deep feelings.Chun Xi was speechless.This Sir Zhang Zhan liked her lady?Jiang Ningbao smiled faintly as she heard her oldest male cousin boasting about Zhang Zhan and hearing Zhang Zhan\u2019s direct words, her white face was calm and there was no trace of being moved.\u201cVery sorry, Sir Zhang, we are not suitable. I like strong heroes like Duke Ding and not physically weak scholars.\u201d\u201cFrom ancient times, beauties are paired with heroes. A beauty like me, if married to a big hero, will be a much told tale.\u201dJiang Ningbao flicked her hair and smiled softly as she spoke with a look of yearning.Chun Xi: \u201c\u2026..\u201dPhysically weak. Lady, were you sure that these words were not stabbing Sir Zhang\u2019s heart? Could you not see that his smile almost fell off?Chun Xi roasted in her heart.Jiang Zhuo\u2019s hands trembled. He had never thought that the weak and soft fourth sister would be this\u2026..making others this speechless. He looked at his Cousin Zhang and could not help but felt schadenfreude.Weak scholar, physically weak\u2026...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even facing a few burly men, I still have the ability to attack.\u201d Zhang Zhan smiled slightly and his tone revealed his pride.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes flashed and she suddenly drew the whip by her hips. She swung it a few times and looked at Zhang Zhan with a smile. Her voice was sonorous and there was a trace of joy in it.\u201cSo Sir Zhang practiced martial arts. Can we have a spar?\u201dThe soft and delicate beauty suddenly swinging a red whip shocked Jiang Zhuo and Zhang Zhan. They looked at the smiling girl and a trace of weird feeling rose in their hearts.Zhang Zhan indeed practiced martial arts. Now, a soft and weak beauty wanted to spar with him. His eyes flashed and swept through Jiang Ningbao\u2019s well-developed and graceful waist. His mouth felt dry and his heart heated up.Spar\u2026..The beauty wanted a spar, it was the most welcomed matter.\u201cWe may, I will hold back.\u201d Zhang Zhan smiled politely.The prey had caught the bait.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s smile became even sweeter.Jiang Zhuo at the side was gaping in shock. He looked at his Cousin Zhan with the gaze of looking at a beast. How could he not know what kind of person his Cousin Zhan was?This guy was simply a beast in human clothing.He appeared clean, but in fact, any servant girls with slight good looks had climbed his bed.Chun Xi looked at Sir Zhang with a pitiful gaze. Her lady was already so fierce when she was a child. Now, she was even fiercer. This Sir Zhang really had courage.\u201cSir Zhang, be careful.\u201d Jiang Ningbao warned with a smile. As her words fell, the whip in her hand had moved like lightning and swept off Zhang Zhan\u2019s leg. With one powerful swing, Zhang Zhan flew away.With a \u2018pah\u2019 sound.Zhang Zhan cried out miserably. His whole body dropped to the strong with a body full of mud.\u201cSir Zhang, are you alright? Sorry, I\u2026..I was a bit nervous just now so I attacked a little heavier\u2026..\u201d Jiang Ningbao kept her red whip with a helter-skelter manner. She ran in small steps to Zhang Zhan\u2019s front with teary eyes.Chun Xi: \u201c\u2026..\u201dJiang Zhuo who was shocked immediately came forward to support his Cousin Zhan.The bones in Zhang Zhan\u2019s body hurt. He never thought that though this Jiang fourth miss looked like she would be blown away by the wind, her strength was this big. But seeing the beauty\u2019s tears with a worried look, he gritted his teeth to let out a smile, \u201cJiang fourth miss, don\u2019t put it in your heart, I\u2026..just fell, it\u2019s nothing big.\u201dHis heart was surprised and bewildered. This Jiang fourth miss was not like what his aunt said to be.\u201cFourth sister, I will help Cousin Zhan to find a healer.\u201d Jiang Zhuo was afraid that his Cousin Zhan would fall ill from falling so he carried Zhang Zhan anxiously to find a healer.Jiang Ningbao looked at them with an unsettled face. Her white and beautiful face was filled with guilt as she rubbed her eyes in flurry and she nodded, \u201cRight, right, oldest cousin is right. Chun Xi, call a male servant to help.\u201dChun Xi immediately called someone and not long later, two male servants hurried over. They took Zhang Zhan in a hurry and before they left, Zhang Zhan still gave a smile while holding in his pain. He must leave a good impression on Jiang fourth miss.\u201cJiang fourth miss, this is an accident, I don\u2019t blame you.\u201dJiang Ningbao nodded with teary eyes and after their figures disappeared, Jiang Ningbao stopped her tears. Seeing Zhang Zhan\u2019s sorry figure, she could not help but smile.\u201cLady, you\u2019re amazing. You\u2019re making a fool of Sir Zhang like this and Sir Zhang still does not blame you.\u201d Chun Xi spoke with a face of admiration.Jiang Ningbao smiled lightly and stared at the direction of the main courtyard. Her tone had coldness, \u201cWanting my things, he should prepare to pay the price.\u201dSaying this, she walked to the courtyard leisurely and when she was about to arrive at the gates, a young male servant ran over and spoke with an out of breath voice.\u201cFourth lady, someone from the palace arrived. Please go to receive the decree.\u201d\u2026..At the gates of Changning Count Residence, there was an incense burner table.Eunuch Zhao who was by the side of the Qianyuan Emperor took a decree to Changning Count Residence with a bunch of serving officials and guards.The people of the Jiang family knelt on the ground.Old Madam Jiang never thought that the emperor would really give a marriage decree for fourth girl and Duke Ding. At that moment, happiness rose and her heart felt complicated.Eunuch Zhao looked at the beautiful woman kneeling at the front and there was a smile on his face. Jiang fourth miss was indeed graceful and beautiful like the rumors, her air was also good. She was suitable for Duke Ding.\u201c\u2026..heard Changning Count Residence\u2019s Jiang fourth miss is beautiful and talented, fragrant like an orchid in nature. This emperor heard that Duke Ding Xie Heng is of marriageable age and Jiang fourth miss stays in the chambers, a suitable match to be together. This emperor points to the lady to be married to Duke Ding and choose an auspicious day to get married. End of decree.\u201dOnce the decree was read, Eunuch Zhao handed the marriage decree to Jiang fourth miss and teased her with a smile.\u201cCongratulations to Jiang fourth miss to get what is wanted.\u201dIt was obvious that this Eunuch Zhao knew of the rumors flying in the capital.Jiang Ningbao was stunned and then beamed a smile, \u201cThank you, eunuch.\u201d Her heart was bursting in joy. She finally could develop feelings with Duke Ding openly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After Eunuch Zhao left, the people in Changning Count Residence surrounded Jiang Ningbao in happiness. Only her oldest male cousin Jiang Zhuo was absent-minded.He never thought that in the blink of an eye, his fourth sister would get a marriage decree.What about Cousin Zhan?Jiang Zhuo thought of his Cousin Zhan who was still lying in bed while shouting in pain. The gaze he used to look at Jiang Ningbao was a little weird, especially when she actually flung his Cousin Zhan with just one swing.Jiang Zhuo was still in disbelief until now and his head was in a trance.Fourth sister seemed so weak and soft, but had great strength. How scary! He never offended before, right?Jiang Zhuo thought with unease.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s smile was sweet, her brows and the corner of her eyes told of her happiness. Now, the whole Changning Count Residence knew that Jiang Ningbao could get near Duke Ding and was shocked.She glanced at her oldest male cousin, Jiang Zhuo\u2019s, expression and her lips curved a little.She seemed to have shocked this oldest male cousin.After weighing the advantages and disadvantages, Old Madam Jiang who was supported by Hong Xing had a face full of smiles. She knocked with her cane heavily and swept through the servants. Her voice showed how moved she was. \u201cFourth girl to have this big fortune is Changning Count Residence\u2019s luck.\u201dChangning Count twisted his lower beard and nodded with an amiable smile.\u201cMother is right. Fourth girl is fortunate. Duke Ding is young and handsome with great power. This is a very rare perfect match. I never thought that fourth girl is the lady with the highest prospect in our count residence.\u201dHe looked at the graceful and cool smallest legal daughter of his and his eyes flashed with regret. His small daughter obviously did not lose to his niece, but this kind of good thing did not fall on Yao\u2019er.Although Xie family and Duke Ding Residence were from the same clan, Xie family could not compare to Duke Ding Residence, which was an incomparable inheritance.If Madam Zhang did not anxiously make the engagement with Xie family\u2019s second branch, using the opportunity of the emperor giving fourth girl marriage decree, Yao\u2019er could get a better marriage. She may even get married into a marquis family.Changning Count thought greedily and he blamed Madam Zhang for being too anxious.\u201cCongratulations, fourth sister!\u201d Jiang Mingyao looked at the happy fourth sister with a complicated gaze as she slowly moved forward to congratulate coolly. The old servants by her side protected the fifth lady as they stared at Jiang Ningbao with faces full of vigilance.Jiang Ningbao sighed in her heart and smiled faintly toward her, her tone was equally distant. \u201cThank you, fifth sister.\u201dJiang Mingyao pursed her lips and led her servants to leave.\u201cCongratulations, fourth sister.\u201d Oldest male cousin Jiang Zhuo put on a smile and her second male cousin Jiang Yue congratulated her with a smile.Jiang Ningbao received the congratulations of others with a smile.After they left, Jiang Ningbao walked toward his courtyard at a normal pace with Chun Xi following beside her with a happy face. A marriage decree. This was the good thing all noble ladies wanted.Now, who in Changning Count Residence dared to give ugly face to her lady?\u201cLady, if the second master and second madam know of the lady\u2019s marriage matter is settled, they will definitely be happy.\u201d Chun Xi\u2019s voice was very moved and excited.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s steps slowed a little and she stared at the vast, blue sky. She pursed her lips and smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Mother and father will definitely be happy for me.\u201dChun Xi did not know that her parents were still alive. When her parents appeared, Chun Xi would definitely be shocked and her older brother Jiang Jin would be too. Jiang Ningbao had thought of whether or not she told her older brother that their parents were still alive.But after thinking about it, she felt inappropriate.How could a lady in the chambers know that her parents were still alive? If she said that she had a prophetic dream, her older brother would not believe it, only thinking that she missed her parents too much.She could only keep this secret in her heart.\u201cAnd that Sir Zhang, he will definitely not dare to get near lady.\u201d Chun Xi continued in an overly excited manner.Jiang Ningbao nodded in agreement, \u201cTrue. A pity, I still want to teach a lesson to him.\u201dZhang Zhan was a fake gentleman in the book. To climb higher, he could do anything. But he had a strong point of being able to take a realistic view of the situation..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang Ningbao felt rather regretful. Maybe some people would feel that in the novel, he ruined \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019s\u2019 innocence and he needed to be severely punished.Not punishing was unfair to the novel\u2019s \u2018Jiang Ningbao\u2019.Taking preventive measures was alright, but Jiag Ningbao was not someone with strong viciousness. Even though she had struggled in the apocalypse for ten more years, her heart still kept that bottom line and clearness.Now, Zhang Zhan had just started hitting on her. A little lesson was alright.But Zhang Zhan using his own marriage as a chess piece to fuel his ambition to climb higher would one day make him get in big trouble.Returning to the courtyard, Bai Mei and the other servant girls were more respectful than usual.Jiang Ningbao only glanced at them faintly. This glance made Bai Mei and the others sweat and felt regret. If they knew that fourth lady would be this fortunate, they would take fourth lady\u2019s side.Fourth lady\u2019s standing within Changning Count Residence rose drastically right now.Bai Mei and the other glanced at the trusted female servant by fourth lady\u2019s side, Chun Xi, in admiration. They felt envy. This Chun Xi really got lucky.The most obvious change was the lunch she had consisted of five big menus, four small dishes, and a delicious old duckling soup. The menus filled the whole table.The dishes were fragrant and made people salivate.Jiang Ningbao calmly ate her lunch. This lunch was only recovered to how it was when her parents were still alive, even Chun Xi did not feel happy.When she was eating lunch, Zhang Zhan whose body hurt all over acted like how Jiang Ningbao expected. After knowing that Jiang fourth miss was given a marriage decree to Duke Ding, he was first astonished and then fearful. Though he was not resigned, he could not throw away the initial plan.As for his aunt\u2019s plan to \u2018ruin innocence\u2019 to force Jiang fourth miss to get married to him, Zhang Zhan who liked to rise through the current threw it at the back of his mind.He\u2019s still young and he had a future. He won\u2019t ruin it for one Jiang fourth miss. No matter how beautiful Jiang fourth miss was and no matter how generous her dowry was, he could not let Dongping Count Residence who was tied to him get dragged down the water.He did not care if his aunt would get angry. Dongping Count Residence was more important than a girl\u2019s dowry.\u2026..The news of Jiang fourth miss getting a marriage decree to Duke Ding traveled all over the capital as if it had grown wings. The various noble families were all shocked.Changning Count Residence\u2019s Jiang fourth miss went from a pitiful girl whose engagement was annulled to being the fiancee of Duke Ding with a marriage decree and stepped on her former fiance\u2019s head.The whole capital was shocked.This day, hundreds of noble ladies were envious and admired Jiang Ningbao. No matter how envious and admired they were, they could only congratulate her sincerely.Who let Jiang fourth miss be the only girl who could get close to Duke Ding? Aside from her, who could get married to Duke Ding?This was not something they could get from envying and admiring.The women who used to like Duke Ding had now become wives and when they heard this news, their hearts rose with faint melancholy, but they mostly felt relief and gave their blessing.Because they were not that lucky one.THe commoners in the capital were dancing in joy. Their Dayue dynasty\u2019s war deity finally had a wife! This was worthy of celebration to thank heaven, and the emperor to not let Duke Ding get old by himself.Although a few strict traditional people would scold that this did not conform to the traditions, no one minded them. The status Duke Ding had in the Dayue Dynasty was unshakable.The whole capital was in a joyful atmosphere.But under this atmosphere, Madam Zhang who had arrived in the temple not long ago heard this \u2018bad\u2019 news and could not breathe, almost fainting. This shocked the servants by her side.Yang Shuqing in Anyuan Marquis Residence also did not feel any joy.There was a \u2018pah\u2019 sound.Yang Shuqing violently threw the teacup in her hand to the ground. Her pair of beautiful eyes were ablaze with envy and the bottom of her eyes were filled with shocking anger and feelings of not resigned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And that if Jiang Ningbao gave birth to any child, Jingyi\u2019s heir position would be given to another and the position of Duke Ding would fall to another\u2019s hand.Yang Shuqing only felt that the ground was spinning and that the future was bleak. She went out of breath and blood went through her throat.Rather than getting married to Xie Jingyi, it was better to be the imperial family\u2019s concubine.Living once more, this one was worse than the previous. What was she tossing around for?Thinking of her personal enemies laughing at her in the dark, Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes became red and smashed the porcelains in her room as if she had gone crazy. In the end, she even smashed a chair which shocked her trusted servant girls Qian Rong and Qian Bi who did not even dare to breathe loudly.In the big room, everything was a mess filled with smashed fragments and water stains.After venting it out, the envy and anger in Yang Shuqing\u2019s heart still did not lessen but increased instead. Her eyes flashed with shocking fury and coldness as she wanted so badly to cut Jiang Ningbao into eight pieces.Outside, Anyuan Marquis stood in front of the door with a gloomy face. The old servants stood trembling at the side as they all moaned in their hearts and hoped that the oldest miss would calm down.After a while, Anyuan Marquis slammed open the door and entered in strides. Her eyes swept through the broken fragments on the ground and his oldest daughter\u2019s red and crazy looking eyes with an angry face.\u201cQing\u2019er, enough! Look at how you look like right now.\u201dAfter seeing her father enter, Yang Shuqing\u2019s body stiffened and her mind suddenly cleared. The craziness on her face receded and she stared at her angry father with red eyes as she shouted in grief and indignation.\u201cDad, I\u2019m not resigned. I am Anyuan Marquis Residence\u2019s oldest legal daughter being suppressed by a girl from a very small count residence, especially she had her engagement annulled by Jingyi. After marrying into Duke Ding Residence, she would set up rules and after she gave birth to Duke Ding\u2019s children, where can there be any place for me and Jingyi? Dad, I\u2026..I cannot stand this.\u201dAnyuan Marquis also did not think that Duke Ding would suddenly get married and he never even thought that Jiang fourth miss who he never placed in her eyes could get close to Duke Ding.But hearing his oldest daughter mentioning children, Anyuan Marquis suddenly laughed loudly.\u201cQing\u2019er, rest assured, Jiang fourth miss cannot gave birth to Duke Ding\u2019s children. Later, Duke Ding\u2019s position will be inherited by Heir Xie.\u201dYang Shuqing was stunned and looked at Anyuan Marquis confusement. She asked anxiously, \u201cDad, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cNot many people know this, but dad is one of them. When Duke Ding first went to the battlefield, he was accidentally shot by an enemy country\u2019s general with a poisonous arrow. He retained his life, but there was a problem with children. So even if Duke Ding will get married, the probability of him having children is little. In the future, Duke Ding Residence will be yours and Heir Xie\u2019s.\u201dAnyuan Marquis smiled and gave his oldest daughter relief.Yang Shuqing was astonished. There was actually such a matter. Initially, she wanted to prevent Jiang Ningbao from getting pregnant if she could not stop Jiang Ningbao from marrying and only waiting for two years, Duke Ding would be gone. She could slowly get rid of Jiang Ningbao by then. She did not think that Duke Ding\u2019s body was problematic.This was really helping her.Yang Shuqing\u2019s heart was happy and she had a schadenfreude smile. The stifled feelings in her chest disappeared and she looked spirited.The two servants at the side lowered their heads. They did not think that they would hear such a secret so they did their best to appear invisible.\u201cQing\u2019er, you must be stable right now, don\u2019t do anything impulsive.\u201d Anyuan Marquis ordered, not feeling assured.Yang Shuqing nodded calmly and her confidence was back on her face. She smiled slightly, \u201cDad, daughter understands. Small things cannot ruin the bigger plan. I will be careful and won\u2019t let others catch my weakness.\u201dThe probability was small, but it did not mean that it was impossible.Yang Shuqing still did not feel assured, but this was easier than preventing Jiang Ningbao from getting pregnant.Anyuan Marquis then left with his heart assured.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What a sight!\u201d\u201cHaha, I wonder how Heir Xie is feeling right now?\u201dThere were people laughing in the crowd and looking at the show.The proposing group arrived in Changning Count Residence with Duke Ding personally leading. This not only shocked Changning Count, but also Old Madam Jiang.They thought that the proposal would come after deciding on the marriage date. They did not think that after getting the marriage decree in the evenight, the proposal would be at noon. Wasn\u2019t this speed too fast?Old Madam Jiang was old and Duke Ding emitted ominous energy so she held it in and did not go out. She only sent a few old servants and male servants to report to her the situation, but the males of Changning Count Residence all lined up to welcome him.Hearing this news, Jiang Ningbao secretly rushed to a secret corner in the front gates. She could see Duke Ding who was the most eye-catching in the group and her eyes lit up. Her lips subconsciously lifted.Today, Duke Ding Xie Heng wore a silver red gown and his hair was lightly tied. His features were cold and handsome with a straight body and iron bones. He seemed even more handsome than usual and his air was sharp and deep, especially his pair of eyes that had ominous energy. No one dared to meet eye to eye with him.Duke Ding got off his horse and walked forward steadily. The surrounding air became dark and cold. He was not near but that forceful coldness hit one\u2019s face.The people waiting at the gates could not help but stepped back.A black clothed guard personally handed the gift list.Changning Count Jiang Dongming and his two legal sons took the list in fear and trepidation. The invited Duke Ding in but did not dare to get near.\u201cSir duke, please enter.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng expressionlessly nodded and entered Changning Count Residence in strides. The tidy and stern black clothed personal guards followed behind. Changning Count Jiang Dongming\u2019s forehead sweated and called servants to put the betrothal gifts in Jiang Ningbao\u2019s courtyard.His heart was dripping blood.Especially after looking at the gifts list. He was so envious that his eyes turned red.Tens of high quality silk, boxes of silver, gold, jades, porcelains, and pearls, also precious herbs, make-up, and others.The servants in Changning Count Residence were shocked agape by the boxes of betrothal gifts.Chun Xi was very excited.\u201cLady, Duke Ding places great importance in you. Heir Xie was not this grand when proposing to Anyuan Marquis Residence.\u201dJiang Ningbao glanced at Chun Xi and her smile was beautiful and moving. \u201cMy eyesight is the best. It\u2019s just when the male is proposing, the female could not be present.\u201dSaying this, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s beautiful eyes flashed with a trace of pity.\u201cLady, won\u2019t this servant call Duke Ding as male master?\u201d Chun Xi suddenly thought of this and asked with joy.A smile rose in Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes and she agreed, \u201cYou should indeed call him master.\u201d Then, her fiery gaze was fixed on Duke Ding who emitted cold and gloomy air not far from her. Her lips kept lifting up.Suddenly, Duke Ding Xie Heng who was wearing a silver and red gown sensed something and turned his head suddenly. His sharp and cold gaze flew to the small corner she was.A familiar beautiful face entered his eyes.So the little lady secretly looked at him. The little lady also noticed his action and even blinked her eyes at him with a naughty smile.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s steps halted and his ominous eyes subconsciously softened. He turned his head and walked to the main hall. His mind was thinking that the little lady was quite lively.Until Duke Ding\u2019s figure left, Jiang Ningbao reluctantly retracted her gaze. Chun Xi at her side happily spoke in a low voice, \u201cLady, this servant just counted. One hundred and eight boxes of betrothal gifts. A total of one hundred and eight boxes.\u201d\u201cImperial family\u2019s betrothal gifts are one hundred and twenty-eight boxes at the most. Who does not admire the lady for having this fortune?\u201d Chun Xi felt proud and elated and her voice was excited and moved as if she had part of it too..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chun Xi was very worried in her heart, but now, she felt that her lady had the right foresight.\u201cAlright, we\u2019ve seen it. Let us head back. Right now, the courtyard is probably filled with betrothal gifts.\u201dJiang Ningbao smiled slightly and there was joy in her warm voice.Returning to the courtyard, a bunch of black clothed guards who emitted stern and harsh air was at her courtyard with the servants in Changning Count Residence. Bai Mei and the others were coincidentally looking at the list.Once Jiang Ningbao arrived at the courtyard, the black clothed guards all greeted her respectfully.\u201cGreeting Jiang fourth miss.\u201d\u201cThis is the list of betrothal gifts, there are four copies. Jiang fourth miss, please accept this list.\u201d A black clothed guard handed her a list.Jiang Ningbao nodded with a smile and spoke with a sonorous voice, \u201cYou all have worked hard.\u201d She took the list and gave it to Chun Xi, telling her to keep it well.The faces of Bai Mei and the others changed slightly. They never thought that Duke Ding would be this detailed. It seemed that the order of the count to take a part of the betrothal gifts could not be done.Jiang Ningbao glanced at them and understood what the four servants were thinking in their hearts. She smiled coldly in her heart. Her oldest uncle was really good, even daring to want the betrothal gifts Duke Ding gave her.After all the betrothal gifts were put in the storage room, the black clothed personal guards left and the courtyard recovered its silence.Jiang Ningbao sipped her tea and looked down at the four servants in silence. The big room was very silent and one could hear the sound of falling leaves.The stifling atmosphere made Bai Mei and the others did not dare to breathe heavily and sweat made their backs wet.A moment later, Jiang Ningbao faintly spoke.\u201cLater, clean up your things and go back to the main courtyard. This place does not need servants who live off a person while secretly helping others.\u201d\u201cYes, lady.\u201dOnce those words were spoken, Bai Mei and the others felt despair and they all left with their heads lowered.Chun Xi was happy. They finally could get rid of Bai Mei and the others. It was tiring to guard against them everyday.\u201cLady, do we need to hire people from outside the residence? What if the old madam disagreed?\u201d\u201cGrandmother will agree.\u201d Jiang Ningbao\u2019s pair of eyes were rippling with gleam. Having the identity as Duke Ding\u2019s fiancee, Old Madam Jiang who prioritized benefits won\u2019t reject her small request.Before, she was Xie Jingyi\u2019s fiancee and Old Madam Jiang only looked at her a little higher. She was treated no different and could not be compared to how the legal children from the first branch were treated.Because Xie Jingyi was heir only in name and did not get the acknowledgement of the emperor.Who knew what kind of change would occur?Duke Ding and Xie Jingyi were not on the same level. The master of Duke Ding Residence was only Duke Ding and he had war merits with high position and much authority.Chun Xi also thought of this. Her face was full of smiles.Old Madam Jiang was as Jiang Ningbao expected, immediately agreeing to her request. Now, the servants in the courtyard were her people and Chun Xi felt at ease.At the same time, someone told the fourth lady that the marriage would be held on the first day of the fifth month.There was still more than one month from the marriage date.It was not long nor short. It was good for preparing for the marriage ceremony.The marriage decree was just given and Duke Ding personally proposed. The one hundred and eight boxes of betrothal gifts made Jiang Ningbao became a hot topic once more.The eyes of Yang Shuqing who just calmed down turned red once she heard of this \u2018tragic news\u2019. One hundred and eight boxes of betrothal gifts! Thinking to her own betrothal gifts, Yang Shuqing curled her fists until her nails dug into her palm and did not feel the pain.She felt wronged and not resigned. She obviously lived once more and it was not the same as the previous time. This life, all was smooth and people praised her. She also ruthlessly avenged the enemies from previous life.Even the powerful and influential man who pampered his wife, Xie Jingyi, became her fiance, but why did she still feel that she could not compare to Jiang Ningbao\u2026..?Jiang Ningbao, who was thought by Yang Shuqing, was nested in her room. She leaned on the table and her pair of beautiful eyes stared at the opened letter on it. She bit her writing brush and her face showed that she was at a loss.How should she write a love letter that could stir sir duke\u2019s heart?Jiang Ningbao, who never had a romantic relationship before, felt deep anxiety.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her mind suddenly had ideas. What wind, flowers, snow, moon. Those love poems that were sentimental nonsense were thrown to the back of her mind. She held the brush and quickly wrote her letter.Ancient people liked being reserved and roundabout, but this letter was simple and straight-forward, even a little\u2026..a little bold. When Jiang Ningbao wrote the letter, she wrote it without stopping and had no other feeling. But after she silently recited it in her heart, her face flushed and her ears turned red. Heat rushed to her cheeks and it was very warm and very hot.\u201cI just feel that my face is a little hot.\u201dJiang Ningbao could not help but touch her flushing face and muttered a little. Her delicate and beautiful face had red dusts and she appeared soft and beautiful, making others could not help but feel tender love.She and Duke Ding had the marriage decree. Sending letters to each other was nothing forbidden, it even could deepen the feelings between the two people. Because of this, people who were engaged liked to give each other personal belongings or something like a fragrance pouch and others.Jiang Ningbao rather liked conversing on papers, she could boldly unleash all of her. The embarrassing love words that she could not speak to Duke Ding, she could easily write it on the paper.After thinking about it, Jiang Ningbao drew a heart on the letter. The words on the letter was clear and beautiful. It was worth the effort she put into practice this for ten years.Jiang Ningbao had a motive for racking her brain to write a letter. She wanted sir duke to give her a reply and she also liked conversing using papers privately like this. She would then keep these letters and when she was old, she would take them out to reminiscence.The only problem was the word she would use to address herself. If she directly used \u2018I\u2019, then it would feel a little dry. In the end, she decided to use the poetic form of \u2018I\u2019. Many girls in the Dayue Dynasty also used that word.Jiang Ningbao felt that word had a lingering charm.It had the feeling of flirting together.The sky outside the window had turned dark and candles were lit inside the room.Jiang Ningbao blew the letter so the ink would dry and she carefully folded it and put it in a delicate pouch. She called Chun Xi and gave the pouch to her as she coughed lightly. She suddenly felt that her heart was beating and jumped fast as she pretended to be calm.\u201cChun Xi, send someone to send this pouch to the Duke Ding Residence and give it to Sir Duke. Remember, you must give it to Sir Duke.\u201d\u201cYes, lady.\u201dChun Xi obeyed respectfully, though her heart was curious what her lady wrote that she acted so secretive and had such a happy smile. She took the pouch and left the room. Outside, she quickly found a servant with quick and neat hands and feet to send the letter to Duke Ding Residence.Night descended and lanterns filled Duke Ding Residence. Butler Zhao went to Duke Ding\u2019s courtyard with a smile. He gave the black clothed personal guard a delicate and pretty pouch.\u201cXie Qi, this is the pouch Jiang fourth miss sends, it must be given to Sir Duke.\u201dIt\u2019s actually a pouch Jiang fourth miss sent. Xie Qi heard this and surprise flashed through his eyes. He nodded toward Butler Zhao and took the pouch with excited emotion, and then he went into the main courtyard.In the main room, the candle light was bright, as if it was day.Duke Ding who sat straight was flipping through the documents on the table seriously. The candle light illuminated the duke\u2019s cold and handsome stern face. The purple Buddhist bracelet he wore on his wrist reflected the light as if it had radiance shining under the candle light.Xie Qi saw this and felt speechless. The duke was now engaged, already had a fiancee, but he was the same as before, not willing to relax even for a day. On the day he got engaged, he was still working at night.Fortunately, Jiang fourth miss was enthusiastic and took the initiative. If not, how would they spend time in the future?\u201cMaster, Jiang fourth miss sends you a pouch.\u201d Xie Qi respectfully spoke.Once Duke Ding Xie Heng heard that the little lady sent him a pouch, the hand handling the document halted. He raised his cold and handsome face and spoke faintly, \u201cGive it to me.\u201dXie Qi respectfully handed the delicate pouch.Duke Ding Xie Heng took the pouch in his hand. It was a pouch embroidered with white magnolia and the embroidery was done well. There seemed to be something inside and Duke Ding was stunned. He opened the pouch carefully and took out a letter emanating faint fragrance.The little lady wrote him a letter?He opened the letter and read it. Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s pupils contracted and his heart beat violently and suddenly as his body stiffened. His expressionless face on his handsome face cracked and the hand holding the letter trembled.Sir Duke:Seeing you today, \u2018I\u2019 am very happy. Once \u2018I\u2019 thought that you are \u2018my\u2019 future husband, the heart jumps without stop. \u2018I\u2019 feel that it got sick heavily and aside from you, there is no other cure. Sir duke, can \u2018I\u2019 visit tomorrow to get the cure?Remember to reply to \u2018my\u2019 letter.Your most beloved fiance, Jiang Ningbao.This little lady was really\u2026..not reserved.Duke Ding Xie Heng did his best to ignore the heat that rushed to his face and tried to be expressionless, but his mind could not help but remember the scene of the little lady winking at him in mischief when he went to propose. He felt that his heart was jumping high, as if it wanted to jump out.Xie Qi coincidentally saw his master\u2019s hand trembling and he widened his eyes. His heart felt as if a cat scratched on it and he really wanted to see what Jiang fourth miss wrote in the letter that made his master who was stable and cold as ice to misbehave.But he did not dare.After reading the letter, Duke Ding Xie Heng put the letter into an empty box next to the table and he put his hand over his heart. He could feel those hidden crazy jumps of his heart.He felt that his heart also fell sick. It jumped too fast, it was a bit abnormal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hesitation appeared on Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s cold and stern handsome face and a moment later, he finally took the paper and held the writing brush. He sat straight and seriously wrote his reply letter.On the letter paper, he wrote four simple and big words.I\u2019ve read it. Agreed.And then, he signed his name below it. He habitually took the seal and when he was about to stamp it, he realized that he was not sorting out documents at that moment. Duke Ding\u2019s hand stiffened and put the seal back to its place.After waiting for the ink to dry, Duke Ding took the letter and when he was about to put it in an envelope, his gaze fell on the two words \u2018Xie Heng\u2019. His sword-like brows unconsciously knitted. He felt that something was lacking.He thought of the sentence the little lady wrote, \u2018Your most beloved fiance Jiang Ningbao\u2019. Duke Ding Xie Heng hesitated once more and he held the brush in his hands. He did not write anything for a long time and in the end, with a solemn face, he added the words \u2018Your most beloved fiance\u2019 in the letter.With the addition of four words, the letter seemed to look better.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s mood suddenly felt a bit happy. He put the letter in the envelope and sealed it well. He raised his handsome face to look at Xie Qi and his voice was low and cold.\u201cGive this letter to Jiang fourth miss\u2019 hands.\u201d\u201cMaster, it\u2019s already dark. Should this servant go through the main door or climb the wall?\u201d Xie Qi took the letter and asked.Once he said this, Xie Qi could feel the temperature in the room lowering as if snow rained in there, cold to the bone. His face could not help but turn white and he wished to slap his own mouth for talking without filtering.Jiang fourth miss was the future madam. The walls of her courtyard were not something an underling like him could climb, right?Duke Ding was silent for a moment and spoke faintly, \u201cClimb wall.\u201dXie Qi was shocked: \u201c\u2026..\u201dThat was Changning Count Residence where Jiang fourth miss lived in. Could he really climb the wall to get in?\u201cClimb the count residence\u2019s wall and give her the letter through the backdoor where she lives.\u201d Duke Ding\u2019s sharp and ice cold eyes stared at Xie Qi. There was a warning he neglected within his cold tone.\u201cThis underling understands.\u201d Xie Qi wiped his sweat and spoke respectfully.\u201cGo.\u201dDuke Ding looked at Xie Qi coldly and took the document on the table to read, The candle light illuminated Duke Ding\u2019s cold and stern face.It was almost the exact same as what he saw when he came in, but Xie Qi realized that there seemed to be a weird air on the duke.After Xie Qi left, the room was silent with only the sound of the candle burning.Duke Ding Xie Heng suddenly put down the document in his hands and his gaze fell on the box beside the table in which he kept the letter the little lady wrote. Once he thought of the content of the letter, his calm heart jumped uncontrollably and his ears were burning with heat.\u201cLately, my heart jumps too erratically. Could it be that I got an illness?\u201d Duke Ding\u2019s sword like brows knitted and uncertainty flashed across his ominous filled eyes. \u201cThe little lady seems to have a heart sickness. I will call an imperial doctor to check tomorrow.\u201dAs he thought he found out the reason for his abnormal heartbeat, Duke Ding returned to being cold and calm.\u2026..The night was cold like water and the moonlight was like frost.Tonight, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s courtyard was not as silent as it used to. There were a lot of servants going back and forth in the courtyard and they spoke silently, giving a few rowdiness.Before nightfall, Chun Xi contacted Manager Yao and sent the people needed over to them. The male servants, chicken staff, and the servant girls were all gathered and could provide food in their own courtyard.By Jiang Ningbao\u2019s side, there was another servant, Chun Le, who was Manager Yao\u2019s daughter. Chun Le did not look like the other girls, she had a smiley face. Once someone looked at her, even if she was not smiling, others would feel like she was, which was nice to look at.At this time, Chun Le entered and presented her smiley face, \u201cLady, the hot water is prepared, please take a bath.\u201dJiang Ningbao responded weakly and walked to the side bathroom.The hot air from the bathtub swirled and there were flower petals floating on the water. Chun Xi stood by the side to serve. Seeing her lady coming in, she immediately helped to take off her clothes.Jiang Ningbao buried herself in the water, revealing white and shining shoulders. She sighed in comfort.Chun Xi stood behind the wooden bathtub and scrubbed her lady\u2019s back.\u201cChun Xi, do you think the duke will reply to my letter?\u201d Jiang Ningbao spoke softly and her face showed her unsettled feelings.This was the first love letter she wrote in both her lives and her wordings were bold with no warm shyness a girl would have. Would he feel his heart tickled or would he throw it at the side or felt that she was too bold?Dayue Dynasty was open and there were many women who dared to love and hate openly, but the difference between them and her was that she had a marriage decree and her marriage was settled.Moreover, it was not weird for her to write a love letter to her fiance. It could only be said that this was conversing their feelings.After Jiang Ningbao sent the letter, she was unsettled. It was now seven to nine p.m. but there was still no reply yet. She began to let her imagination run wild.\u201cHe should be,\u201d Chun Xi answered with hesitation.Jiang Ningbao sighed and her brows had a light anxiety. She finally knew what \u2018a day was like a year\u2019 felt like..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was as if she heard the voice from heavens and her heart was blooming flowers.She immediately rose from the bathtub and dried herself. She put on a clean and elegant sleeping dress as her moist hair fell to her waist, her pair of beautiful eyes were shining like diamonds.\u201cLady, you\u2019re very good looking.\u201d Chun Xi could not help but praise.\u201cWhat a sweet mouth.\u201dJiang Ningbao teased her in a good mood. She held her sleeping attire and walked out of the room with anticipation. She opened the letter with a heart bursting with joy. But when she read the four big words on the letter, it was as if cold water doused her body.I\u2019ve read it. Agreed.Could Duke Ding think that he was sorting out documents? Jiang Ningbao was completely speechless. Duke Ding was really a wooden blockhead. As she wanted to keep the letter, her eyes fell on the recipient.Your most beloved fiance, Xie Heng.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart felt like it was soaked in warmth. She felt happy and her brows had smiles on it. She did not think that the ice cold Duke Ding would have such a cute side.Chun Xi and Chun Le were curious to what Duke Ding wrote in the letter that let their young miss this happy.\u201cRemember to prepare. We will go to Duke Ding Residence tomorrow.\u201dJiang Ningbao threw these words and sat on the chair with a good mood as the two servants helped to dry her hair.Chun Xi widened her eyes and the hand wiping the hair halted. She asked in curiosity.\u201cLady, are you going to see the male master tomorrow in the duke residence?\u201dChun Le heard Chun Xi called Duke Ding as \u2018male master\u2019 and her eyes turned wide. There was shock and bewilderment in her eyes. Her lady\u2026..lady was not married yet.Jiang Ningbao glanced at them and spoke with slyness, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Duke Ding approved of it\u201d And wasn\u2019t it approved? Once she thought of the duke\u2019s reply on the writing was the four words \u2018I\u2019ve read it. Agreed,\u2019, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart felt cold.Tonight, Jiang Ningbao had a nice dream and a good night sleep but Duke Ding Xie Heng once again had trouble sleeping.The night was silent at Duke Ding Residence\u2019s ancestral hall.Xie Jingyi who had not gone to sleep heard his male servant describing the marriage decree at day and the grand scene of his adopted father proposing on the rush cushion. His clear eyes rippled.\u201cHeir, in the future, Jiang fourth miss will get married into the residence and would give birth to the duke\u2019s children, if\u2026..\u201d the male servant muttered and mumbled with a face filled with worry.Jiang fourth miss was sir heir\u2019s ex-fiancee. Who knew if she hated sir heir in her heart?Xie Jingyi glanced at the male servant and cut him off with his cold tone, \u201cDuke Ding Residence originally belongs to my adopted father. The duke position should be inherited by adopted father\u2019s biological child.\u201dThe male servant\u2019s face stiffened, \u201cBut\u2026..but heir, you\u2019re already adopted under the duke and if the duke had no children, you would have the chance to inherit the position.\u201d\u201cIn the future, don\u2019t call me this, call me young master.\u201d Xie Jingyi spoke deeply. There was no undulation in his voice. No matter whether he inherited the position of duke or not, he was still a member of the Xie family.He had his own pride and honor.The male servant\u2019s implied words, how could Xie Jingyi not heard it?But he chose to reject.The male servant was shocked and still struggled, \u201cDoesn\u2019t the old madam tacitly acknowledge that you are Duke Ding Residence\u2019s heir?\u201d\u201cWithout the emperor\u2019s recognition, the title of heir is just false and could be replaced anytime.\u201d Xie Jingyi\u2019s face was indifferent. There were servants who wanted to suck up to him and called him heir, he told them to correct themselves but after getting grandmother\u2019s tacit agreement, the servants all called him Heir Xie.Slowly, the commoners in the capital also called him Heir Xie.Now, the calling of Heir Xie became his binding.In the future, his adopted father would have his own children and the title of heir would only be a laughingstock.The male servant went silent and spoke carefully, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the position of heir, won\u2019t Miss Yang be looked down upon by others?\u201d The heir liked Miss Yang, he might protect his heir position for Miss Yang, right?Xie Jingyi\u2019s cold and handsome face softened, \u201cShuqing won\u2019t mind this kind of false thing. I am now a five city military forces commander and I will have a promotion in the future. Maybe this was because of the duke residence, but I can do this job well.\u201dMale servant: \u201c\u2026..\u201dWas it really like that?As a trusted male servant, he was strong in reading others. As Anyuan Marquis\u2019 oldest legitimate daughter, Miss Yang had high status, but he saw the ambition in her eyes. She was not the same kind of person as Jiang fourth miss.The process of sir heir and Miss Yang getting to know each other, the male servant knew it clearly. At this moment, he could not help but have a suspicion of whether or not Miss Yang dressed up as a male to get close to sir heir.Since sir heir always kept a distance with females.Now that Miss Yang and sir heir had gotten engaged, the male servant only hoped that Miss Yang really liked sir heir and not sir heir\u2019s position.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang Ningbao opened her sleepy eyes and she wore an outer garment as she walked to the window. The servants were cleaning the courtyard outside.\u201cLady, you\u2019re awake?\u201d Chun Le brought a bronze basin inside and saw her lady standing beside the window. Her round face flashed with surprise.\u201cYes, I slept early yesterday so I woke up earlier today.\u201d Jiang Ningbao calmly went to wash her face.Chun Le: \u201c\u2026..\u201dAfter Jiang Ningbao ate breakfast, she wore a light blue dress with red plum embroidery in the front and back. She wore an exquisite jasper hair clasp and on her waist, there were two rings of sheep-fat white jade ornaments, appearing clean and elegant.\u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s time to go to Duke Ding Residence.\u201d Jiang Ningbao looked at the woman in the mirror and smiled. She turned to look at Chun Le and Chun Xi and walked out of the room. As she walked, the jade ornaments clashed and made a clear sound.Around an hour later, the carriage arrived at Duke Ding Residence.Jiang Ningbao led her two servant girls to Thriving Joy Hall to see Old Madam Xie. Knowing that Jiang Ningbao was coming, Old Madam Xie\u2019s face was full of smiles and immediately sent someone to call her son over.A moment later, Duke Ding Xie Heng who was wearing a dark colored brocade gown entered Thriving Joy Hall with steady strides. The air froze and it made people scared. Strangely, Duke Ding led an old imperial doctor with white long beard. This imperial doctor was following not far behind Duke Ding.\u201cGreeting mother.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng greeted Old Madam Xie on the high chair and his gaze fell on the little lady beside her. The little lady gave him a smile.\u201cSir duke, I\u2019m here.\u201dHer smile was soft and beautiful, her voice was warm and easy to the ears.Duke Ding Xie Heng felt his heart start to jump erratically. He pursed his lips and his handsome and spirited face emitted solemnity and coldness.He seemed to really have a heart problem.At this time, the white haired old imperial doctor greeted Old Madam Xie and was surprised at her appearance that seemed ten years younger.Perhaps it was the happy matter that made her like this.\u201cA\u2019Heng, why did you call the imperial doctor over? Mother is fine,\u201d Old Madam Xie nodded slightly to the old imperial doctor and smiled as she asked Duke Ding.After drinking the medicinal wine Ningbao girl gave her, the pain and sickness she had disappeared. Her whole body felt very healthy.Duke Ding Xie Heng shook his head, \u201cThe imperial doctor is not here to check on mother.\u201dOld Madam Xie was stunned and asked with worry, \u201cA\u2019Heng, is something the matter with Jingyi?\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng shook his head again and turned to the old imperial doctor. Her voice was cold and deep, \u201cImperial doctor Chen, you should check Jiang fourth miss. I think that she has heart sickness.\u201dJiang Ningbao widened her eyes and she would no longer be calm, \u201cSir duke, I am very healthy.\u201dOld Madam Xie was bewildered.\u201cYesterday, you said that your heart got sick beyond cure. I invite an imperial doctor to check on you. Don\u2019t hide sickness for fear of treatment.\u201d Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s handsome face was solemn.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s white face instantly had red dust and she could not help but glare at Duke Ding, this wooden head, out of embarrassment. Her expression was hard to describe.Old Madam Xie was first astonished and hearing her son\u2019s words, she almost laughed. Oh my goodness! Her son was really an unenlightened wooden head.Ningbao girl was pitiful.The old imperial doctor could hear the fishiness inside and his eyes twitched. Duke Ding actually made such a silly ruckus. He lightly coughed and spoke as he held back from laughing.\u201cJiang fourth miss, come here. Do not hide sickness for fear of treatment, let this old doctor check so the duke can be assured.\u201dJiang Ningbao glanced at Old Madam Xie\u2019s sly smile and could only let the old doctor check.The old imperial doctor checked the pulse and smoothened his white beard. He looked at Duke Ding and smiled, \u201cSir duke, Jiang fourth miss is very well, there is no heart sickness.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng released his breath. It was good that the little lady was not sick. He did his best to restrain the ominous energy on him and solemnly let the Imperial Doctor Chen check him.\u201cImperial doctor, check me. These past few days, my heartbeat is abnormal, I might have heart sickness.\u201dThe Thriving Joy Hall was silent.Jiang Ningbao widened her eyes and gaped her mouth.Old Madam Xie who was drinking tea almost spurted out the tea in her mouth. She looked at her son\u2019s handsome face with her eyes twitching. Even old servant Huang looked at the duke speechlessly.Sir duke, you did not have heart sickness, your heart was moved.The old imperial doctor\u2019s face was hard to describe, but he still seriously checked the duke as he resisted the ominous energy. The result was that he was healthy.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s sword-like brows knitted and confirmed three times.He really felt that he had heart sickness.After the old imperial doctor fled in defeat and she saw Duke Ding\u2019s cold and solemn face, Jiang Ningbao could not help but laugh.Hahaha, sir duke was really cute.Old Madam Xie could not help laughing. So her cold son also had this cute side.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because in the past twenty eight years, his heart never beat abnormally. This must be the symptom of a heart sickness.The little lady was still small and did not understand that it was hard to treat once one had a heart sickness.Duke Ding knitted his brows and the air around froze. The ominous energy on him unconsciously was released a little and it oppressed the people within the vicinity, making them unwell.Old Madam Xie knitted her brows from feeling unwell.\u201cYou cannot hide sickness for fear of treatment. Tomorrow, I will invite another imperial doctor to check.\u201d Duke Ding Xie Heng felt something amiss and instantly restrained the ominous air on him. His handsome face stretched taut and his cold and deep voice had cautiousness.Old Madam Xie glared at her son with astonished expression. She did not think that her son would be more wooden than wood. Saying he was a blockhead was raising him too high.Fortunately, Ningbao girl was clever and quick-witted.If her son made the ruckus wider and everyone knew, it would be a laughingstock.\u201cCough, cough. A\u2019Heng, actually, you really do not have any sickness. You have to believe Imperial Doctor Chen. He is well versed in medical skill and is good in treating miscellaneous, difficult, and complicated cases of illness.\u201d Old Madam Xie had a helpless tone.Jiang Ningbao laughed boisterously but once she heard Duke Ding wanted to find another imperial doctor, she immediately stopped laughing and thought that it was not good. She immediately straightened her attitude and spoke, \u201cSir duke, old madam is right. Actually, we are not sick. Before explaining, I want to ask the duke, when does your heart beat erratically?\u201dSaying this, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s pair of beautiful eyes filled with anticipation. Although she had a guess, it would make her happier if Duke Ding spoke it himself.Duke Ding, who did not know Jiang Ningbao had dug a pit, fixed his gaze on the little lady\u2019s red and moist face. His brows knitted and he glanced at her expressionlessly without saying anything.\u201cIs it related to me?\u201dJiang Ningbao raised her white and delicate face with a sly smile.Duke Ding nodded slightly and his eyes flashed with bewilderment. He said, \u201cYes.\u201d When his heart beat abnormally, it was always related to the little lady.There was something strange.Old Madam Xie looked at the show as she drank her tea. She knew that Ningbao girl had a solution. Old servant Huang silently released a breath. Good thing there was Jiang fourth miss. From young to adult, Duke Ding had no servant girl serving him. Every servant was strong and robust male servants and guards. It was normal that he did not understand these feelings.\u201cActually, everytime my heart beats abnormally, it is related to sir duke.\u201d Jiang Ningbao curved her lips and spoke with a soft voice. Her brows and eyes emitted a happy air.Duke Ding Xie Heng looked at her in focus. Hearing these words, his heart jumped as if there was something inflating and filling it.The heart sickness came again.\u201cSir duke, do you know what mutually in love means? It\u2019s the heart that would jump.\u201d Jiang Ningbao smiled and explained mischievously. She specially put her slender and pretty hand on where her heart was. A faint fragrance flew and Jiang Ningbao walked to Duke Ding\u2019s front as she spoke.\u201cJust like I get near you. The heart goes badump, badump, jumping abnormally and fast.\u201dThe girl\u2019s clear scent wafted to his nose and Duke Ding Xie Hend looked at the little lady in front of him. His heart seemed to jump faster as if he did not notice, it would jump out of his body.It was the same as what the little lady said.His brows knitted once more and the contours of his face seemed cold and hard. He expressionlessly said, \u201cSo mutually in love means abnormal heart beat.\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s smile stiffened and she choked off. Her fighting spirit rose. They were all people who had never been in a relationship. The reason why she had rich theories while Duke Ding was like a white sheet on emotions was because\u2026..\u2026..it was all thanks to the nine years of compulsory education.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart felt faint pride. She softly explained the deeper meaning of mutually in love and only had your heart beating erratically. She did not notice that Duke Ding\u2019s ominous filled eyes turned deeper and quiet. There was a dark light flashing by.\u201cSir duke, so you\u2019re not sick, no need to search for another imperial doctor.\u201d Jiang Ningbao explained science in satisfaction and concluded this.Duke Ding looked at the little lady deeply.\u201cUm.\u201dHis heart was thinking that the little lady knew a lot. So his reaction was because he liked the little lady. Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s heart rose with a trace of joy. He finally understood what silliness he made and he decided to ask Xie Qi and the others when he had the time.Old Madam Xie who heard Ningbao girl explained and played tricks on her son did not felt unhappy but had to suppress a smile instead. She sipped her tea and drank her laughter. Old servant Huang also had a face full of smiles.\u201cA\u2019Heng, you should take Ningbao girl to tour around.\u201d Old Madam Xie saw that it was bright outside and immediately made a chance for her son to converse.Hence, the cold and innocent Duke Ding Xie Heng led the little lady to his courtyard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hearing Butler Zhao\u2019s words, this was the courtyard Duke Ding lived in. So their lady had directly passed through the hall into the inner chamber.\u201cThis isn\u2019t good, right?\u201d Chun Le\u2019s smiley face showed hesitation and spoke in a small voice.Chun Zi smiled in helplessness. She lowered her voice and replied, \u201cThe emperor decreed the marriage and it is settled. The lady knows what she is doing.\u201d Chun Le just came to her lady\u2019s side yesterday so she did not know her lady well.From the time Butler Zhao came to annul the engagement, the lady was no longer gentle and agreeable. The bold things she had done were not little.Now, the whole capital was full of the rumors about her lady and Duke Ding.It\u2019s only entering the inner chamber. Based on Duke Ding\u2019s character, he won\u2019t do any bold things, but her lady whose guts grew big might not be the same. Chun Le should be worrying about the duke.\u201cSir duke, this is your courtyard?\u201d Jiang Ningbao observed the courtyard in curiosity. The courtyard was quite big and the plants were obviously delicately trimmed and planted. It was simple and imposing. There was also a big field for practicing martial arts. It suited Duke Ding very much.Duke Ding faintly said, \u201cYes.\u201d And he walked to the small martial arts practice field out of habit.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes lit up. She lifted her skirt and walked forward, her tender and delicate face was filled with the desire to have a go. It had been a long time since she last practiced and her movements were rusty. This time, her red whip was placed in the carriage and she did not take it with her. She could try her skills.\u201cSir duke, why don\u2019t we have a spar?\u201dThe black clothed personal guards in the courtyard all stared at Jiang Ningbao with stunned gazes. Jiang fourth miss, this slim and tender lady, actually wanted to spar with the duke.Duke Ding saw her slim and tender figure, especially her graceful and slim waist that looked as if it would be hurt with just a light touch. He unnaturally shifted his gaze and spoke coldly.\u201cYou cannot, you\u2019ll get hurt.\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s brow was raised and she had a brilliant smile, \u201cI can or cannot, won\u2019t the duke know after trying?\u201d Saying this, her body moved and her right hand became like a knife that was thrust toward Duke Ding. Her move was swift and fierce, formidable and impressive.Duke Ding\u2019s eyes flashed with ripples and astonishment. He did not think that the little lady would be this fierce.One could tell that this move was not a move that was showy and of no use.Duke Ding\u2019s tall and straight body did not move. His move was fast like thunder. He immediately reached out his hand to capture the little lady\u2019s arm. Jiang Ningbao was no chicken either. She moved her body and her long and slender hand captured Duke Ding\u2019s arm instead. The move was done in an instant.In an instant, the two had exchanged many blows.The black clothed personal guards all widened their eyes as they stared at the black and light blue colors intermingling on the field. One was manly and domineering, the other soft and tender, looking like they\u2019re well-matched in strength.Jiang fourth miss actually practised martial arts.Chun Xi covered her face. Her lady actually revealed her fierce nature this fast. Chun Le was incomparably shocked and her smiley face was in a trance.\u201cThe lady practises martial arts?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The lady is good at flinging whips. Sir Zhang, a grown man, was flung flying with just one swing from the lady.\u201d Since it was revealed, Chun Xi did not need to keep it a secret.Fortunately, the lady was about to get married to the duke and there was even a marriage decree. She did not need to worry that her engagement would be annulled again.Chun Xi felt rejoiced in her heart.The black clothed guards around had sharp ears and hearing Chun Xi and Chun Le\u2019s conversation, they all twitched their lips. So Jiang fourth miss only looked soft and weak on the outside but was actually fierce on the inside.She even made a grown man fly with just one swing.On the martial arts field, Jiang Ningbao fought to her heart\u2019s content. Duke Ding was really a good opponent. A pity that he did not go all out. It seemed that the difference between her and Duke Ding was quite big. It was all Duke Ding conceding her.But, this was a good chance.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes turned and her lips had on a sly smile. She suddenly shouted \u2018ah\u2019 tenderly and her excellent and graceful figure was about to fall to the ground.Duke Ding\u2019s heart trembled and he immediately retracted his strength. He quickly flew and reached out his hand to receive her, but Jiang Ningbao took this chance to pull him and they both fell on the ground.With the posture of the woman pushing down the man.The black clothed personal guards, Chun Xi, and Chun Le all watched with widened eyes and gaping mouths.On top of Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s hard and firm body, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s hair was loose and some strands fell. Her breathing was faint and her sweat was fragrant. On her white face, there was a layer of faint pink. She looked beautiful and enchanting, making others could not lift their eyes off her.The little lady\u2019s body was soft and tender, carrying a faint fragrance as she pushed down on him. The mind of Duke Ding Xie Heng, this firm and unyielding handsome man, blanked. A foreign limp and numbing sensation traveled across his body and he stiffened.He could not move and could not not move.His ears turned pink.The two were silent.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes were bright like the stars. She looked at the handsome and resolute face of Duke Ding and smiled tenderly. Her clear and melodious voice carried a trace of smugness.\u201cSir duke, I win.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Faint scent entered his nose and Duke Ding\u2019s breath turned short, his heart hammering like thunder. Unconsciously, the bottom of his eyes had a dark layer.\u201cYes, you win.\u201dDuke Ding\u2019s voice was cold and deep as always but there was an addition of hoarseness to his voice.The black clothed personal guards were all shocked by the sudden turn of events. They never thought that the fierce beyond compare Duke Ding would be pushed down by Jiang fourth miss.Based on their eyesight, they had seen the duke going easy on Jiang fourth miss and they also saw clearly Jiang fourth miss\u2019s tricks, but the duke\u2019s reaction made them speechless.Chun Xi and Chun Le: \u201c\u2026..\u201dEspecially Chun Xi, she felt that this was expected.Although there were only the black clothed personal guards, Chun Xi, and Chun Le in the courtyard, Jiang Ningbao was embarrassed to keep on pushing down the duke. She rose with a red face and took a handkerchief from her sleeve to wipe her sweat. She smiled at Duke Ding, \u201cSir duke, please take care of me from now on.\u201dAfter saying this, she elegantly tidied her crumpled dress and thinking of her bold action, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart thundered and her face was burning.Chun Le wanted to come over but she was held by Chun Xi. Chun Le was stunned and looked at Chun Xi in confusion.\u201cChun Le, when the lady is together with the duke, we should not go and obstruct them. Just act as if you don\u2019t see anything.\u201d Chun Xi looked at Chun Le helplessly. Without even mentioning Duke Ding who emitted ominous energy, the lady would also not want to be disturbed at this moment.Chun Le: \u201c\u2026..\u201dNot far, Duke Ding expressionlessly stood up from the ground and lightly patted the dust on his black brocade gown. He looked calm but if one looked closely, the stiff movements of Duke Ding would be noticeable. His gaze fell on the little lady\u2019s white and beautiful side face, his eyes seemed to have a trace of something.\u201cOkay.\u201dJiang Ningbao was stunned, then she understood that the duke was replying her earlier words. Her lips lifted upward and she breathed in deeply. The heat on her face receded a little.At this time, Butler Zhao came to the courtyard with two delicate invitations. He greeted them from afar.\u201cGreeting the duke and Jiang fourth miss.\u201d\u201cYou have something?\u201d Duke Ding Xie Heng spoke coldly.Butler Zhao answered respectfully, \u201cReplying to the duke. In two more days, Queen Rui will hold an admiring flowers banquet. She sent the invitation just now and knowing Jiang fourth miss is in the residence, the messenger gave Jiang fourth miss\u2019 invitation for this servant to send.\u201dAfter saying this, he took a big step forward and resisting the ominous energy emitted by the duke, he gave two delicate invitations.Duke Ding Xie Heng stretched his big hand and took the invitation.\u201cIs this my invitation?\u201dBecause of her three years mourning period, Jiang Ningbao was not used to it. She moved close to Duke Ding and surprise flashed across her white face. Queen Rui actually sent her an invitation.\u201cYes, yours.\u201d Duke Ding Xie Heng gave one invitation to her.Jiang Ningbao opened in curiosity and her name was really written on the invitation. She could not help but reveal a smile. In the capital, who did not know that Queen Rui was very enthusiastic in holding banquets?The invitations to Queen Rui\u2019s banquet were in great demand.Ultimately, the heirs, official sons, and talented youths made a lot of noble ladies proud of being invited to Queen Rui\u2019s banquet.Based on Changning Count Residence\u2019s standing, even when her parents were still there, she had not received the invitation from Queen Rui.\u201cSir duke, can I join?\u201d Jiang Ningbao waved the invitation in her hand and asked with a smile.Actually, she was not interested in the banquet, but Jiang Ningbao was quite interested in the flower admiring banquet Queen Rui held. A few days ago, Queen Rui held a plum blossom banquet.That plum blossom banquet was a turning point in Jiang Ningbao\u2019s life.The male lead Xie Jingyi saved the female lead Yang Shuqing which led to a series of events.In the novel, there would be various incidents in the flower admiring banquet Queen Rui held.Some good, some not.But Queen Rui did not mind. She only liked to hold banquets and could not control others\u2019 actions and behaviors. The people joining the banquet knew this.\u201cGo if you want to, if not, reject.\u201dAside from imperial banquets, Duke Ding had never joined various banquets. He glanced at the little lady who seemed interested. There was no undulation in his voice.It was Duke Ding\u2019s way of replying as expected.Domineering.Jiang Ningbao smiled slightly, \u201cThen I will go to take a look. It\u2019s the first time I received an invitation from Queen Rui. I should go for a trip.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng pinched the invitation he held.Everytime he received an invitation from Queen Rui, Duke Ding would throw it to the side and never joined. This time, Duke Ding hesitated for a moment and debated if he should join too or not.But thinking of the little lady\u2019s moves and that there would be a lot of delicate and frail noble ladies attending the banquet, Duke Ding Xie Heng decided to throw this invitation away.After Butler Zhao delivered the invitations, he wanted to retreat. His gaze swept through the duke\u2019s gown. Wait, his eyes were not blurry, right? Why did he seem to realize that the duke\u2019s gown was dirty?Wait a second. Butler Zhao widened his eyes. Jiang fourth miss\u2019 face was red and her hair was loose and a few strands fell. Dusts tainted the light blue long dress she wore.What exactly happened?Butler Zhao looked at the surrounding black clothed guards, his eyes carrying his question. The black clothed guards all averted their faces. Butler Zhao was muddled and could not help but ask.\u201cSir duke, why is your gown dirty?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang Ningbao gave him a brilliant smile and flicked the hair by her ear. She looked at Butler Zhao and spoke with a smile and soft, warm voice.\u201cButler Zhao, I just sparred with sir duke.\u201dButler Zhao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dJiang fourth miss who looked weak and feeble dared to spar with the duke. A pity that he did not see their spar. Butler Zhao felt curious and pity in his heart.\u201cJiang fourth miss is really amazing.\u201d Butler Zhao praised sincerely and spoke a while with Jiang Ningbao. He then bid farewell and left. As the big manager in the residence, he had a lot of things to do.Nearing noon, Jiang Ningbao once again ate lunch with the enthusiastic Old Madam Xie. When she went back, she carried with her a few black clothed personal guards.These black clothed personal guards followed to take the medicinal wine.The journey was an hour long. When Jiang Ningbao arrived in Changning Count Residence, she personally led people to take five big earthen jugs of medicinal wines and gave them to the black clothed personal guards. After they left, Jiang Ningbao returned to her courtyard.Chun Le served the tea with her smiley face.Chun Xi who was at the side could not help but say, \u201cLady, the madness from the previous plum blossom banquet has not receded yet but why does Queen Rui hold another banquet already? Before, there\u2019s usually one to two months before another banquet is held. This time, it\u2019s only half a month.\u201dJiang Ningbao smiled and sipped her tea, \u201cQueen Rui loves to hold banquets. This is nothing weird.\u201d\u201cLady, will you really go to Queen Rui\u2019s flower admiring banquet?\u201d Chun Xi asked with entangled emotions.Jiang Ningbao nodded with a faint smile, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t the male master say that if you don\u2019t want, you can reject? This servant still remembers the time that little king asked the lady to be his one hundred and eight concubine on the street.\u201d Chun Xi spoke indignantly.\u201cChun Xi, the past is the past, no need to bring it up.\u201d Jiang Ningbao could not help laughing. If Chun Xi did not say, she would\u2019ve forgotten that unrestrained and good looking youth with red lips and white teeth.She wondered if this little king who liked beauties still liked the female lead, Yang Shuqing.At this time, she heard the voice of an old servant out of the door.\u201cLady, the old madam invites you to the Golden Longevity Hall.\u201dJiang Ningbao\u2019s eye corner raised lightly and she looked at the delicate invitation on the short chair and then she looked at her dirty long dress. She rose and changed into a clean and elegant scattering flower long dress inside the inner chamber. She then led Chun Xi and Chun Le, along with a few servants, to the Golden Longevity Hall.On the road, she met with many servants in Changning Count Residence. After three years, they once more saw the fourth miss leading a bunch of servants to Golden Longevity Hall again. The few servants could not help but sighed that things changed.Who would\u2019ve thought that Jiang fourth miss would have such changes?Inside Golden Longevity Hall, Old Madam Jiang who was sitting on the high chair saw her fourth granddaughter entering the hall and although her heart felt stifled, she still gave an amiable smile. She gestured for Jiang Ningbao to seat below her seat and called her trusted servant Hong Xing to serve tea.Old Madam\u2019s attitude was too passionate and Jiang Ningbao\u2019s delicate and beautiful face revealed an expression of being overwhelmed with unexpected favor while her heart went on guard instantly.\u201cFourth girl, I heard that you received the invitation to Queen Rui\u2019s flower admiring banquet?\u201dJiang Ningbao heard this and she already had a guess. She admitted magnanimously, \u201cIndeed.\u201dOnce she said this, Old Madam Jiang\u2019s eyes flashed with joy, \u201cSince it\u2019s like that, two days later, take the fifth girl and your second male cousin with you.\u201dOld Madam Jiang felt pity that the fifth girl\u2019s marriage was settled.In Queen Rui\u2019s banquet, there were countless high status noble ladies and talented youths, even princes and kings would attend. Fifth girl\u2019s air and appearance were considered high class. Who knew if a king liked her and they would be able to climb a higher branch?As for engagement, they could annul it.Although her second grandson\u2019s status was a bit low, feelings could not be calculated. Her second grandson\u2019s appearance was good, who knew if a high status noble lady liked him?Old Madam Jiang planned these things in her heart.Toward this small request, Jiang Ningbao agreed.Two days later, before setting off, the number of people going to King Rui Residence to attend a flower admiring banquet increased by one. It was Zhang Zhan who she sent flying with just one swing. When Zhang Zhan looked at her, he was refined and courteous, but there was a distant feeling.Jiang Ningbao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dThe first time she attended Queen Rui\u2019s flower admiring banquet, Jiang Ningbao wore a silver and red dark plum flower pattern long dress. On her head, she wore delicate golden hairpin. The one that attracted attention was the big and round night pearl inlaid on the golden hairpin.Night pearl was one the world\u2019s rarest treasure. This hairpin seemed to be one of the betrothal gifts Duke Ding sent.Around an hour later, two carriages finally arrived on the street where King Rui Residence was. This street was full of various carriages from both sides.The carriages all had the symbols of various clans. There were gorgeous ones, humble ones, or simple ones. The managers in King Rui Residence all welcomed the guests warmly.The carriage where she sat, bearing Changning Count\u2019s symbol, came and attracted the attention of the crowd. Coincidentally, the carriage of Anyuan Marquis Residence\u2019s oldest young miss also came.The carriages of Changning Count Residence\u2019s Jiang fourth miss and Anyuan Marquis Residence\u2019s oldest young miss met and they stopped in front of the gates of King Rui Residence at the same time.One was the future Duchess Ding, Heir Xie\u2019s former fiance. One was Heir Xie\u2019s current fiance.Thinking about the relationship between them, many people around the horse carriages became excited and stretched their necks to see a good show.Who would be the first to get down the carriage and enter King Rui Residence?.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were excited silently and sent an old servant to report to Queen Rui.\u201cQuick, tell the queen that there\u2019s a good show.\u201dOthers were used to the different style of King Rui Residence. Who did not know that King Rui and Queen Rui had similar interests. One liked to eat, drink and play while the other liked to host banquets to see good shows.The only legal son liked beauties and his harem had one hundred and seven little concubines. They were like flowers and had various amorous expressions.Every time Queen Rui held a banquet, the little king would parade his own concubines to show off their talents and skills with dance or songs. They were quite popular.There were carriages belonging to noble ladies, sons, and officials around who came earlier. They could have entered sooner but they who were up to date all waited at the gates.They waited to see the rumored very beautiful Jiang fourth miss with excellent bearing who could easily get close to Duke Ding and was the future Duchess Ding. Who knew that they would get such a surprise?Jiang fourth miss and Anyuan Marquis\u2019 oldest young miss bumped into each other.In the carriage, Jiang Ningbao saw her second male cousin Jiang Yue who rode a horse next to the fifth sister\u2019s carriage steering his horse toward her. He got near her window and spoke with a trace of excitement.\u201cFourth sister, we bumped into Anyuan Marquis\u2019 carriage. You have to get down fast. We have to enter before them.\u201d\u201cLady, the second master is not wrong. Your status is not the same as before. It is within reason that you enter before Oldest Miss Yang. This way, you can emphasize your position as the elder.\u201d\u201cIf Oldest Miss Yang enters first, then you will be looked down upon by the other noble madams after marrying.\u201dChun Xi immediately added. Chun Le nodded with her smiley face.Jiang Ningbao raised her eyebrow and tidied her hair. She laughed lightly, \u201cDon\u2019t be too hasty to conclude things. Observe the situation first. Miss Yang is a smart person.\u201dThe female lead Yang Shuqing was not a push-over. There were a lot of people around the carriages who were looking at the show. If Yang Shuqing could not satisfy both sides, she would easily be a subject of ridicule and both sides would not be good.Yang Shuqing would definitely not enter the residence before her.If she entered first, Yang Shuqing would feel stifled in her heart.Firstly, she, Jiang Ningbao, was only the lady of the second branch of Changning Count Residence. Before her father met with \u2018mishap\u2019, he only managed the business and had no official position.Because her oldest aunt Madam Zhang was not willing to separate the residence because of her selfishness, Jiang Ningbao was considered a count residence\u2019s lady and had seniority ranking along with the status of noble lady.If her older brother Jiang Jin passed the imperial examination this year and had an official position, the second branch could rise and she could be considered a true noble lady.Without the count residence, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s status would be worse than the child of a seventh ranking official.Being suppressed by a girl whose status was much lower, even though this girl had her engagement annulled, she still got the thing Yang Shuqing wanted but could not have in the life before. She won\u2019t be resigned.Jiang Ningbao could understand a little regarding Yang Shuqing\u2019s mentality after she was reborn.Second, Jiang Ningbao was now Duke Ding\u2019s fiance decreed by the emperor. Her status elevated a lot.Based on etiquette, Jiang Ningbao was Yang Shuqing\u2019s elder so Yang Shuqing had to respect this future elder.But Jiang Ningbao was only Duke Ding\u2019s fiance and she had not married into Duke Ding Residence. Yang Shuqing\u2019s status was still higher than her, being the oldest legal daughter of Anyuan Marquis who had real influence. The nobility placed great importance on face and once they lose it, they would be talked about as a laughingstock.With Yang Shuqing being so prideful, what would she do? Would she endure and let her enter first or would she discuss and perform in front of others to enter the residence together?Jiang Ningbao\u2019s mouth curved into an interested smile.At this time, Jiang Yue retorted with emotion, \u201cFourth sister, your marriage is decreed by the emperor and won\u2019t have any accidents. No one will say anything if we enter the residence first.\u201d\u201cLet us get down first.\u201d Jiang Ningbao directly ignored Jiang Yue\u2019s words. Seeing the carriage opposite her had no movement, Yang Shuqing obviously wanted to observe while in a difficult spot. Her heart laughed.If Yang Shuqing sent someone to discuss, she wouldn\u2019t refuse and enter the residence harmoniously.But fifteen minutes passed and there was no movement from the carriage in front. Jiang Ningbao was too lazy to wait any longer.Could Yang Shuqing want her to lower her head first and send someone over?Jiang Ningbao shook her head silently. Yang Shuqing placed herself too high. Could a lower nobility like her not want face?She was also Duke Ding\u2019s fiance.Chun Xi and Chun Le heard this and they immediately straightened their backs. They were filled with fighting spirit.\u201cAlright, lady.\u201dThe two servants opened the curtain and went down the carriage. They put a short chair on the ground. The people outside and the managers who wanted to look at a good show waited and became anxious. It seemed that Jiang fourth miss did not want to wait any longer and moved first. They were excited.As they expected, not long later, a figure wearing silver and red went down the carriage and stood elegantly at the side of the carriage.The girl\u2019s bearing was special and she was very beautiful. Her silver and red dark plum embroidered long dress emphasized her skin that was as white as snow.Shining illustriously, unparalleled brilliance.Especially the night pearl on the golden hairpin she wore on her head. Under the sunlight, it shone enchantingly.The eyes of the surrounding noble ladies shone and they all looked at the golden hairpin.What a big night pearl!They heard that this golden hairpin set with night pearl was one of Duke Ding\u2019s betrothal gifts.The noble ladies all revealed admiring looks.The rumor was indeed true. Jiang fourth miss indeed was beautiful with good bearing. Her bearing was better than Oldest Miss Yang.They really did not know what kind of eyes Heir Xie had.Based on the reaction of the noble ladies, one could tell that the appearance and bearings of someone was very important.Now that Jiang Ningbao changed a lot, the evoking pity appearance that she had was ignored by others.She obtained the favor of the present noble ladies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She stretched out her neck to see Jiang Ningbao who was getting down her carriage. Her eyes changed. Jiang Ningabo actually ignored her and got down the carriage first. Not only that, she also wore an eye-catching red and silver long dress today.Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes sank suddenly. Her forefinger stroke the silver and red tapestry weaved twin lotus long dress.Both of them actually chose the same silver and red colors.Yang Shuqing\u2019s face sank and the surrounding air became ice cold and oppressive in the carriage.Qian Rong and Qian Bi both called out in their hearts. Every single time they met Jiang fourth miss, the lady was easily affected.\u201cWe\u2019re also going down.\u201d Yang Shuqing spoke coldly.The movement in Anyuan Marquis\u2019 carriage attracted the gazes of the crowd.After Yang Shuqing went down the carriage, the crowd\u2019s gazes fell on her silver and red long dress and golden hairpin.The stone embedded on Yang Shuqing\u2019s golden hairpin was ruby.The two future mother-in-law and daughter-in-law wore similar clothing.One did not fear comparison, only fear unable to compare.It was obvious that Oldest Miss Yang lost on her golden hairpin.The crowd got excited and the heirs and officials\u2019 sons admired the two different beauties with interest.They wondered if the two beauties would tear each other or not.The moment Jiang Ningbao looked at Yang Shuqing, surprise flashed by.What a coincidence.Could it be that they were destined to be opponents?Chun Xi and Chun Le were happy that her lady won over Oldest Miss Yang.\u201cJiang fourth miss, what a coincidence. I did not think that you would receive an invitation from Queen Rui.\u201dYang Shuqing had a brilliant smile and led her two servants to Jiang Ningbao\u2019s front as she spoke.\u201cIt is indeed a coincidence.\u201d Jiang Ningbao nodded with a smile, her gaze sweeping to the golden hairpin on Yang Shuqing\u2019s head and her silver and red long dress as she spoke meaningfully.Yang Shuqing felt furious but her face still had a smile as she changed the topic, \u201cThis is the first time Jiang fourth miss received Queen Rui\u2019s invitation. I\u2019m afraid you are unfamiliar. Why don\u2019t we enter together so that I can introduce Jiang fourth miss?\u201dThese words were obvious. Yang Shuqing chose to enter the residence together with her.Jiang Ningbao also did not like to give others a show and nodded with a slight smile.\u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll be troubling Miss Yang.\u201dThe audience all had disappointed looks. They did not tear each other up.In the next moment, the tables turned.Jiang Yue, this pig teammate, suddenly shouted, \u201cNo! Fourth sister, you are the future duchess, Oldest Miss Yang\u2019s future mother-in-law! There is seniority. You should enter the residence first.\u201dZhang Zhan who was not far from Jiang Yue was shocked until he almost fell from his horse. Could it be that water flooded his second cousin\u2019s head?The cool beauty Jiang Mingyao who just got down the carriage stiffened and abruptly looked at her fourth sister with shame.Right, right, it should be like this!Tear each other up! Tear each other up!The disappointed crowd became excited again.Yang Shuqing\u2019s face changed and her smile instantly froze. She looked at Jiang Yue with eyes cold as ice.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes twitched. She was actually dragged down by this pig teammate.If she had known, she would\u2019ve rejected Old Madam Jiang\u2019s suggestion.The situation which could be solved peacefully broke and it was obvious that no one heard the voice in her heart.Not only that, a familiar laughter traveled to her ears.\u201cThat brother is not wrong. It is reasonable that Jiang fourth miss enters first.\u201dAlong with these words, an unrestrained and good looking youth came from King Rui Residence with a bunch of various beauties behind.The youth waved a fan and his pretty plum blossom eyes flashed with mischievous smiles. He looked at Jiang Ningbao heatedly.Today, Jiang fourth miss was really beautiful.It was actually the beauty fan of King Rui Residence, little king Xiao Ran.Jiang Ningbao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dYang Shuqing\u2019s face turned black instantly and a dark light flashed through the bottom of her eyes. The hands in her sleeve tightened.D*** Xiao Ran.Jiang Yue who got the little king\u2019s approval was very happy.Dadada\u2026..A clear and tidy horse steps was heard and the audience saw King Qin\u2019s guards, no, there were also King Jin\u2019s guards. The two kings came together.King Qin once revealed that he admired Oldest Miss Yang very much and wanted her to be his cefei.The expressions of the people around turned weird.Seeing the people who were coming, Yang Shuqing\u2019s face unconsciously had a brilliant smile.Jiang Ningbao looked at the gates that were blocked by the little king and his beauties and lightly smiled. Her gaze was calm while she sighed in her heart. Wherever the female lead was, it was hard to have peace.It would be good if this was the apocalypse, people would listen to the one with the biggest fist.After the carriages that came later knew what was happening in front, they all became interested and all stopped to look at the show.The manager of King Rui Residence once more sent someone to deliver the news to Queen Rui.King Rui Residence\u2019s Main Courtyard.A middle-aged woman wearing gorgeous clothes leaned on the soft chair with satisfaction as a few pretty servants massaged the beautiful middle-aged woman\u2019s shoulders and legs.An old servant ran to the main room, out of breath as she reported, \u201cQueen, there\u2019s a good show. Jiang fourth miss and Oldest Miss Yang originally prepared to enter the residence together but a young master who came with Jiang fourth miss refused loudly. The little king suddenly joined in and stood on Jiang fourth miss\u2019 side. Coincidentally, King Jin and King Qin arrived. It was known that King Qin admired Oldest Miss Yang very much and once said he wanted to marry her as cefei. After being rejected by Miss Yang, he\u2019s still infatuated with Miss Yang.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She clapped her hands happily and spoke with abundant interest, \u201cIt seems that there will be a good show. Good thing this queen specially invites Jiang fourth miss to attend this flower admiring banquet.\u201dThe gates of King Rui Residence.King Qin and King Jin arrived at the same time. The two kings on the horse were noble and the air was oppressive.The noble ladies present looked from the windows of their carriages with shyness and their faces blushed as they went down their carriages.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s gaze fell on the first supporting male character, King Qin. This King Qin was a little over twenty years old and he was good looking with a deep blue long gown. The sleeves and the front of the jacket were embroidered with auspicious clouds and white crane patterns. There was a sheep-fat white jade fastened to his waist and he looked noble and not mundane.The other was the King Jin that the female lead wanted vengeance on. He wore a dark brocade gown and his figure was tall with a handsome face. His sword-like brows were eye-catching and his bearing was cold and sharp, carrying a faint oppression.The male lead Xie Jingyi belonged to the cool and cold handsome type.No wonder the previous life, Yang Shuqing was madly in love with King Jin. King Jin indeed had the capital.Jiang Ningbao did not miss the hatred roaring in the bottom of Yang Shuqing\u2019s eyes when she looked at King Jin.\u201cSecond male cousin, Sir Zhang, fifth sister, let us wait at the side.\u201dJiang Ningbao spoke lowly and faintly. After saying this, she let the carriage driver park the carriage at the side of the road, giving way to others.Jiang Ningbao had a suspicion that the little king deliberately let the gate got blocked.They left Yang Shuqing and her two servant girls at the gates of King Rui Residence.The two kings pulled the reign on their galloping horse at the same time and neatly stopped before Yang Shuqing.Yang Shuqing bowed to the two kings and smiled slightly, \u201cShuqin greets King Qin, Kin Jin.\u201dThe words \u2018King Jin\u2019 were squeezed out from her teeth.King Qin revealed a surprised smile as he asked warmly.\u201cIs Miss Yang waiting for this king?\u201dOnce these words were out, King Jin beside him sharply squinted his eyes.Yang Shuqing shook her head and looked at Jiang Ningbao as she smiled faintly, \u201cI\u2019m preparing to enter with Jiang fourth miss into King Rui Residence.\u201dKing Qin and King Jin followed her sight and saw a beautiful girl who also wore a silver and red long dress.So this was Jiang fourth miss.Xie Jingyi\u2019s ex-fiance and Duke Ding\u2019s fiance.King Jin\u2019s eyes flashed with a light,\u201cShe made things difficult for you?\u201d King Qin asked with a frown as he looked at Jiang Ningbao with a gaze that was not amiable.She also wore a red and silver long dress, but the eye-catching golden hairpin on her head made her beat Yang Shuqing.King Qin\u2019s heart felt a trace of unhappiness.Yang Shuqing\u2019s heart felt warm and she smiled as she shook her head, \u201cNo, it\u2019s just her second male cousin said that there\u2019s an order of seniority so Jiang fourth miss should enter first.\u201dHer tone did not carry any wronged feeling but she highlighted where she was wronged, making King Qin feel heartache.\u201cLater, you enter with this king.\u201dYang Shuqing\u2019s heart felt greatly pleased but her face revealed hesitation.\u201cThis is not good, right?\u201dLittle king Xiao Ran who was not far from them heard King Qin\u2019s words and shook his fan. His gaze turned to Jiang Ningbao as he carried a bunch of beauties to her front.\u201cJiang fourth miss, we meet again.\u201dJiang Ningbao slightly raised herself slightly, \u201cGreeting the little king.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to meet a familiar person. Let\u2019s go. Jiang fourth miss, this young master will take you inside.\u201dLittle king Xiao Ran said with a smile. After saying this, he let the bunch of beauties let out a path.Jiang Ningbao did not refuse.\u201cThanking little king.\u201d\u201cStop. Xiao Ran, let us enter first.\u201d King Qin suddenly spoke up.The little king Xiao Ran\u2019s plum blossom eyes squinted and he harrumphed coldly. \u201cXiao Xu, this is King Rui Residence, not your King Qin Residence. Whoever I let enter first will enter first.\u201d\u201cXiao Yan, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\u201cThe guest is up to the host, this king has no objection.\u201d King Jin, Xiao Yan, nodded his head and slightly nodded his head toward Jiang Ningbao.Yang Shuqing\u2019s pretty face changed and she lowered her eyes as she hid the hatred and killing intent that were bursting from her eyes.King Qin frowned.Jiang Ningbao slightly smiled toward the little king and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be troubling the little king.\u201dThe little king closed his fan and nodded with satisfaction as he laughed loudly, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dJiang Ningbao decisively led her fifth sister and the rest into King Rui Residence.She did not look at Yang Shuqing even a bit, only leaving her lissom and graceful back.Yang Shuqing who was left behind stood there as she tried to maintain her smile. The gaze from all directions fell on her, as if laughing at her.King Qin\u2019s face sank. He did not think that Xiao Ran would put a hand in this matter.The surrounding noble women laughed silently, their hearts felt free and happy.Oldest Miss Yang also had today.They were not blind, how could they not see that Oldest Miss Yang wanted to use King Qin\u2019s status and influence to step on Jiang fourth miss? They did not think that the little king who liked beauty would stand on Jiang fourth miss\u2019 side.It was stealing chicken only to lose the rice used to lure it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They felt that it was not worth it for him.King Jin only looked at Yang Shuqing faintly. He used to feel that Oldest Miss Yang had money and power, her means were impressive. Now, he felt she was idiotic and he suddenly felt flat and insipid. Once he thought that the decrease in his power was related to King Qin, coldness rose in his pair of sharp eyes.He did not hesitate to lead his guards into King Rui Residence.Yang Shuqing suddenly looked back and stared fixedly at King Jin\u2019s tall and straight back. Her fists curled and her eyes were filled with hatred. Once she thought that Kin Jin was worried out of his mind recently, her heart felt satisfied.\u201cMiss Yang, let us enter.\u201d King Qin went down his horse and strode to Yang Shuqing\u2019s side as he looked intensely at her beautiful face.Yang Shuqing thought that she was engaged and she still wanted to be the future Duchess Ding, so her reputation could not be tainted. She immediately shook her head and refused, \u201cThanking King Qin for the kind offer. I am now engaged, it is better to keep a distance.\u201d After saying this, she took Qian Rong and Qian Bi as she turned to enter King Rui Residence.King Qin pursed his lips and followed in big strides as he led his people while maintaining a little distance.The eyes of the girls who stood around the carriage shone. King Qin was hot stuff and he had Anyuan Marquis\u2019 backing. Anyuan Marquis\u2019 oldest legal daughter was not engaged to Heir Xie. For this point, King Qin was now the imperial cousin with the highest reputation to succeed the throne. A lot of big officials had silently stood on his side while recently, King Jin\u2019s forces were decreased, losing a level.The people who could join Queen Rui\u2019s banquet all had bright minds. The noble sons and official sons were all talented youths.Their hearts had a steelyard.Jiang fourth miss was Duke Ding\u2019s only fiance. The current emperor was the previous emperor\u2019s legal son and he was also Duke Ding\u2019s cousin. If he did not carry poison since he was in his mother\u2019s womb and his body was fragile with no child until now, how could he designate imperial cousins?When the previous emperor passed away before he could appoint the crown prince, as the previous emperor\u2019s only legal son, he ascended the throne with Duke Ding\u2019s backing although his body was weak since Old Madam Xie was his aunt.So where Duke Ding leaned to was important.Oldest Miss Yang was usually calm and smart, giving others the impression of planning strategies with a command tent. This time, it was not known if she was muddled or others, but she actually wanted to use King Qin\u2019s status and influence to step on Jiang fourth miss.Women would get muddled once they encounter feelings.Oldest Miss Yang was probably also like this. The noble sons and official sons who quite admired Yang Shuqing revealed a trace of disappointment.Jiang Ningbao and the others followed little king Xiao Ran into the King Rui Residence and were dazzled by the scene inside. The fake mountain and flowing water, various buildings, and the exquisiteness and luxury all over. Aside from old servants, they met young male and female servants who were all good looking.Jiang Ningbao: \u201c\u2026..\u201dNo wonder this little king Xiao Ran grew the personality of loving beauties. He grew up within an environment of good looking people so it was normal that his standards were high.\u201cThere are many good looking people in the little king\u2019s residence.\u201d she could not help but sigh.Little King Xiao Ran in front squinted his plum blossom eyes and he shook his fan as he spoke with pride, \u201cJiang fourth miss, your eyes are good. The things belonging to King Rui are not much, but beauties took up the most.\u201dJiang Ningbao thought of the little king\u2019s one hundred and seven concubines that were more than the emperor\u2019s harem and went silent.Indeed, beauty was the most.She turned back to look and Jiang Mingyao was silent the whole way, not looking sideways. Jiang Yue looked around enthusiastically while Zhang Zhan\u2019s demeanor was elegant, his actions were befitting his position.Jiang Ningbao slightly knitted her brows. Wasn\u2019t Jiang Yue\u2019s personality too rash and careless? Before, she rarely had contact with this second male cousin and her understanding toward him was not much. Looking at it now, Old Madam Jiang was digging a pit for her.\u201cJiang fourth miss, the duke does not come?\u201d After little king Xiao Ran went prideful, he suddenly asked in curiosity.His mother hosted many banquets and every single time, she would send an invitation to Duke Ding, but Duke Ding never participated. Little king Xiao Ran felt a little disappointed.\u201cLittle king, do you think that the noble ladies can withstand the ominous energy from the duke?\u201d Jiang Ningbao asked him a question instead with a soft voice.Little king Xiao Ran was speechless and did not speak anymore.Jiang Ningbao smiled and continued following behind little king Xiao Ran\u2019s back. She thought of King Qin and King Jin who she saw today. These two kings, how should she say it? The bearing was very out of ordinary. They both had ambitions but the feeling King Qin gave her was that he was lesser than King Jin.In the novel, King Jin was an ambitious man. In the life before, he lied and schemed the female lead and made her die tragically. King Qin lost because of the female lead and also King Jin\u2019s scheme.But King Qin had his legs broken by Yang Shuqing proved that this King Qin\u2019s intelligence was not on par to King Jin. Though after the female lead went back to the past, King Qin was helped by the female lead\u2019s fore-knowledge and assaulted King Jin, becoming the emperor and the female lead became King Qin\u2019s unattainable love.This was meaningful.The female lead Yang Shuqing felt that she was so tragic in her previous life because King Jin got rid of her as soon as she had done her job. But there was a cefei from a prominent family who married King Jin being given the title of guifei.This woman was also the female lead\u2019s target of vengeance.After Jiang Ningbao saw the two kings, she could not help but laugh in her heart. Yang Shuqing could become King Qin\u2019s unattainable love not only because of King Qin\u2019s personality, it was also because Yang Shuqing had future knowledge and made plans for King Qin. Every attack would strike the target. In King Qin\u2019s heart, she had the label smart and matchless, planning strategies within a command tent.King Jin\u2019s ambition was big with careful and deep thoughts, also strong willpower. He won\u2019t like a woman easily and he was good at hiding and enduring. It was not something ordinary people could do. According to the novel, King Jin should be under King Qin\u2019s suppression and his power was decreased by a lot. Today, he still attended the banquet and maintained the superficial brother\u2019s relationship with King Qin.Just for this endurance, if Yang Shuqing did not reborn and shatter the forces he gathered secretly and did not get HEir Xie\u2019s support when he became the new Duke Ding, King Qin won\u2019t be able to win over King Jin.King Jin was the novel\u2019s final boss.Jiang Ningbao curled her lips to a sly smile. She was now Duke Ding\u2019s fiance and Duke Ding was Qianyuan Emperor\u2019s cousin. If she used her mystical medicinal wine to treat Qianyuan Emperor\u2019s persistent ailment, Qianyuan Emperor wouldn\u2019t die early and he would even have children.This stage of imperial brothers\u2019 war could come to a close.Yang Shuqing could also stop.She definitely would not let Duke Ding Residence enter this storm of fight for the throne.Jiang Ningbao decided to mention this matter to Duke Ding after going back. Once she thought that she had another reason to go find Duke Ding, Jiang Ningbao\u2019s mood was good and she emitted a happy air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was now the season of blooming flowers and hundreds of flowers bloomed in the hundred flowers garden, making people feel happy.There were five big wayside pavilion in the hundred flowers garden. One wayside pavilion could accommodate more than thirty people.Good looking male and female servants carried plates as they came and went in the small road among the sea of flowers, giving a person the impression that flowers were beautiful but the person was even more beautiful.There was also the sound of flute, bamboo, and singing voice.In the hundred flowers garden, the figures were lithe and graceful, noble ladies whose bearing was dignified led servants to admire flowers. Some noble sons, official sons admired the beauty as they drank wine while some others were talking to the girls.Once little king Xiao Ran arrived at the hundred flowers garden, he immediately attracted the gazes of the people, especially the bunch of different beauties behind him, making others\u2019 eyes shone. Time to time, there were a few males who exchanged greetings familiarly with the little king.There were not a few gazes that fell on Jiang Ningbao and Jiang Mingyao that carried uncertainty.Little king Xiao Ran led Jiang Ningbao and the others to the center wayside pavilion in the hundred flowers garden. The big wayside pavilion had wollen blanket and on it were a few tea table and low stools. On the tea table, there were papaya and snacks.There were already a few noble ladies in the big wayside pavilion, chatting as they let out clear and melodious laughter from time to time. When seeing little king Xiao Ran leading the two unfamiliar faces, Jiang Ningbao and Jiang Mingyao, they smiled slightly at them and were polite and decent.Jiang Ningbao gave them a friendly smile.She was thinking that these were the true noble ladies, well-bred ladies. Every knit of the brows, every smile, every action and moves were polite and decent, not giving others the impression of high and mighty and any uncomfortable feeling.\u201cJiang fourth miss, you stay here first, Young master will take them to the other side.\u201d Little king Xiao Ran\u2019s plum blossom eyes slightly carried dislike as he looked at Jiang Yue.Zhang Zhan\u2019s demeanor was elegant as he thanked the little king. His heart could not help but feel a trace of thirst and excitement. The ones attending this admiring flower banquet were the real well-bred ladies from illustrious families and noble ladies.If he could get a noble lady\u2019s favor\u2026..Zhang Zhan\u2019s heart was ready to start wriggling though his face did not show it. A beast in human clothing was talking about his kind of person.Jiang Ningbao also smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll be troubling the little king.\u201d\u201cJiang fifth miss, your fiance, Xie Jinghui, is also here, at that big wayside pavilion. You can go there to develop some feelings with him, or should this young master call him here?\u201d Little king Xiao Ran looked at Jiang Mingyao and pointed in a direction.Jiang Mingyao\u2019s cool face showed how she was stunned and at a loss. She pursed her lips and her voice was cool, \u201cThanking little king\u2019s kind offer, no need.\u201dLittle king Xiao Ran saw this and did not say anything.Jiang fifth miss was indeed a beauty and a cold beauty, but the little king had no interest in beauties who already had engagements.Jiang Ningbao smiled and asked another matter, \u201cLittle king, when will the admiring flower banquet start?\u201dBefore little king Xiao Ran answered, a clear and melodious voice of a woman rang, \u201cJiang fourth miss, the flower admiring banquet starts the moment you step into the hundred flower garden.\u201dJiang Ningbao was stunned and she looked at the woman who was talking. The woman seemed to be fifteen to sixteen years old, wearing an apricot colored silk skirt. Her brows were exquisite and her skin was white. She was smiling as she looked at Jiang Ningbao.It was obvious that she knew who Jiang Ningbao was from the little king\u2019s conversation.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Miss Fu\u2019s words are correct. Jiang fourth miss, everytime this master\u2019s queen mother holds a banquet, it\u2019s actually a big gathering. There is no talent and skill show and no need for making poems and painting. It\u2019s fine as long as everyone\u2019s happy. Of course, you can leave a head of time. You can leave or stay as you please.\u201dLittle king Xiao Ran spoke as he smiled.Jiang Ningbao thanked him politely and thought that wasn\u2019t this the ancient version of high-class blind date gathering? Well-bred young ladies, noble and official sons gathered and if they liked each other, they might propose.No wonder the banquet Queen Rui held would make others scrabbles madly.But the legal daughters who got the invitations would more or less carry the concubine daughters to participate so there would be various incidents.After little king Xiao Ran led Jiang Yue and Zhang Zhan and left, Jiang Ningbao and Jiang Mingyao sat on their own seat and the few well-bred ladies introduced themselves.They did not look down on Jiang Ningbao because she was only Changning Count Residence\u2019s legal daughter from the second branch and did not think highly of her because she was Duke Ding\u2019s fiance. IT gave Jiang Ningbao a comfortable feeling.Jiang Ningbao finally knew that this Miss Fu\u2019s name was Fu Wanning, the legal granddaughter of the left minister and she could not help but be surprised. This Miss Fu Wanning was the guifei from a prominent family that the female lead wanted vengeance on.After self introduction, Fu Wanning asked with curiosity, \u201cJiang fourth miss, I heard that you can get close to Duke Ding, is it true?\u201d The few noble ladies by the side also had a curious face.Jiang Ningbao smiled as she nodded, \u201cYes, perhaps, my life trajectory is a bit special.\u201dThis was agreed by the present ladies.The noble ladies were curious and feared Dayue Dynasty\u2019s war deity Duke Ding, and could not help but ask a lot of things about Duke Ding.\u201cDuke Ding is very good, he\u2019s very filial.\u201d Jiang Ningbao spoke of Duke Ding, Xie Heng. She thought of the silly heart-sickness matter he did and the time when they spar. Her brows and eyes were all smiles.The eyes of the present noble ladies lit up. It seemed that this Jiang fourth miss really liked Duke Ding.Jiang Mingyao silently heard the conversation between her fourth sister and the few noble ladies. At this time, a youth who had a clear appearance stepped into the wayside pavilion with two guards.\u201cMay I ask which one is Jiang fifth miss?\u201d The clear looking youth\u2019s gaze fell on Jiang Mingyao and Jiang Ningbao\u2019s two unfamiliar faces as he asked clearly.Jiang Mingyao\u2019s looked at him coolly and knitted her brow, \u201cI am, may I ask who you are?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m called Xie Jinghui, your fiance. If you have the time, can we walk outside?\u201d The clear youth saw that the cool girl was his fiance and invited her with a slight smile.Jiang Mingyao hesitated and looked back at her fourth sister. Jiang Ningbao only smiled and did not make the decision for her, only staying silent. In the end, Jiang Mingyao stood to follow Xie Jinghui.The few people in the wayside pavilion all left the wayside pavilion one by one to admire flowers and meet up with a talented youth. Jiang Ningbao and Fu Wanning felt comfortable with each other and went to admire flowers together.Chun Xi and Chun Le followed behind.The more she talked with Fu Wanning, Jiang Ningbao felt that Fu Wanning was a smart and magnanimous girl. She thought of her older brother Jiang Jin who was eighteen but have yet to have an engagement. If Fu Wanning was her sister-in-law, then it would be great.A pity that the difference between the two families was big. Jiang Ningbao could only bury this in her heart. But when they were talking, she also praised her own big brother.Fu Wanning knew this but did not point it out, only heard it while smiling slightly.Jiang Ningbao stopped before going too far.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Yang Shuqing saw Fu Wanning behind her, her eyes quickly flashed with a trace of deep coldness.The two nodded politely and brushed their shoulders with each other.\u201cWanning, Miss Yang seems to have something against you.\u201d Jiang Ningbao felt that prickling gaze at the back and reminded Fu Wanning. Because she was comfortable with Fu Wanning, she and Fu Wanning were now on a first name basis.Fu Wanning\u2019s steps halted and she slightly knitted her brow as she smiled helplessly, \u201cYes, I feel it\u2019s weird. I have no interaction with Miss Yang. These past two years, whenever I meet her, I can feel she holds something against me.\u201d\u201cPay more attention to it.\u201d Jiang Ningbao warned.Fu Wanning was the novel\u2019s fifth female cannon fodder. Yang Shuqing started her vengeance and after Fu Wanning became King Jin\u2019s cefei, she ruined Fu Wanning and made the relationship between King Jin Residence and the Left Minister Residence become bad. Two birds with one stone.Fu Wanning nodded with a slight smile. The two continued to stroll around the hundred flowers garden as they chatted. On the road, they met with a lot of noble ladies and official sons, also some concubine born daughters from big families.Not far from the theater stage, the theatrical troupe was performing. Little king Xiao Ran led a bunch of beauties to see the performance which attracted a lot of the noble sons.Jiang Ningbao did not mingle among them. She heard that there were a lot of incidents in the hundred flower garden. No matter if the legal daughter framed concubine born daughter or concubine born daughter framed the legal daughter, there were continuous big shows that were bustling. She heard that there was a noble lady from a prominent family who schemed to get King Jin.Jiang Ningbao thought of Yang Shuqing once she heard of this rumor.Suddenly, Jiang Ningbao felt a familiar ominous energy and she abruptly raised her head to meet with a pair of dark and sharp cold eyes filled with ominous energy.It was the duke! The duke actually came.Jiang Ningbao was happy and she gave Duke Ding who was far away a brilliant smile. Far away, Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s gaze fell on the little lady\u2019s face and his cold and sharp eyes had a trace of softness.\u201cWhy, Duke Ding came.\u201d Fu Wanning noticed Jiang Ningbao\u2019s strangeness and raised her head to look. She saw the domineering figure who struck fear in the heart and could not help but say this.She heard that Duke Ding never joined the banquet Queen Rui held. He came suddenly this time, could it be for Jiang fourth miss?\u201cYes, the duke came.\u201dJiang Ningbao nodded with a smile. Though in her heart, she wanted to fly to the duke to develop some feelings.Fu Wanning covered her mouth and coincidentally saw a lady she knew was admiring flowers so she immediately said, \u201cNingbao, you go talk to Duke Ding. I won\u2019t disturb you guys. Let us meet again when we have the time.\u201dAfter saying this, she led her servants to leave.Jiang Ningbao laughed lightly. She led Chun Xi and Chun Le to walk toward Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s direction with a good mood.Duke Ding\u2019s arrival attracted a commotion.But the noble ladies and well-bred ladies avoided him. Only little king Xiao Ran and a few Xie clan males with Old Madam Xie\u2019s maternal house\u2019s males went to say a few sentences but they did not dare to stay for long.Yang Shuqing looked at Jiang Ningbao walking to Duke Ding\u2019s side with a brilliant and beautiful smile, making her feel it was an eye-sore. Yang Shuqing took a deep breath and turned to look at Xie Jingyi with a warm smile.Xie Jingyi\u2019s punishment was over and the wounds on his body were more or less healed. After knowing his fiance went to King Rui Residence, he and Duke Ding went to join Queen Rui\u2019s flower admiring banquet together.\u201cSir duke, are you here to see me or pick me back to the residence?\u201d Jiang Ningbao stood beside Duke Ding and on her white face, red dust appeared because she was walking too fast.Duke Ding Xie Heng looked at the little lady and his gaze fell on the golden hairprin embedded with night pearl. His gaze softened and he spoke faintly, \u201cTo see you, pick you back to the residence.\u201dActually, for the whole evening, Duke Ding was absent-minded. And then, the black clothed guards told him that the little lady met with Yang Shuqing in front of King Rui Residence\u2019s gates.Duke Ding decided to back up the little lady.\u201cNot meeting for one day is like parting for three years. Sir duke must be missing me.\u201d Jiang Ningbao\u2019s eyes wander and she mischievously flirted with Duke Ding.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s cold eyes flashed with laughter and he said, \u201cYes.\u201dJiang Ningbao widened her eyes. She did not see it wrongly, right? She actually saw the duke smiling.Won\u2019t this prove that her method was effective? See, the duke chased her to the flower admiring banquet.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s heart felt very pleased with herself.\u201cAre we going back now?\u201d\u201cGo back if you want to. Today, there will be someone to measure your clothes.\u201d Duke Ding Xie Heng looked at the little lady and spoke faintly.\u201cTo make a wedding dress?\u201dJiang Ningbao just recalled that her wedding date was on the first of the fifth month. There was still more than a month\u2019s time. She usually only thought to develop feelings with Duke Ding and it seemed that she had not prepared her wedding dress so she could not help but have a guilty conscience.She seemed to have forgotten to embroider her wedding dress.But she could not embroider her wedding dress. After living for sixteen years in ancient times, Jiang Ningbao had not obtained this skill. She could only do a bit of embroidery so don\u2019t even talk about wedding dress.\u201cYes.\u201d Duke Ding nodded.\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t embroider the wedding dress?\u201d Jiang Ningbao asked with a red face and her gaze was wandering.\u201cI will prepare.\u201d\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Jiang Ningbao asked with hesitation. She heard that women mostly embroider their wedding dress. If one could not, she would still make the finishing touch.Duke Ding hit bulls-eye, \u201cYou cannot embroider.\u201dJiang Ningbao choked.She then thought that not being able to embroider a wedding dress was not much, the duke had prepared a better one. Jiang Ningbao\u2019s mood became happy and she naturally grabbed Duke Ding\u2019s arm as she smiled at his handsome face.\u201cLet us go back to the residence. We can also spar.\u201dDuke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s body stiffened and his heart beat violently.Not far away, Jiang Mingyao saw how Duke Ding and her fourth sister interacted for the first time and she silently heaved a breath. Her fourth sister should be better off in the future, right?She turned back to look at her fiance beside her and a trace of anticipation rose in her heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Married To The Male Lead\u2019s FatherChapter One HundredPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBefore leaving, Jiang Ningbao sent people to tell Jiang Yue, Zhang Zhan, and Jiang Mingyao. Then, she happily interlocked arms with Duke Ding Xie Heng as they left King Rui Residence\u2019s hundred flower garden.\u201cSir duke, I don\u2019t get the matter of marriage and don\u2019t know what to plan. I want to find an experienced elderly woman to teach me, do you have someone in mind?\u201dJiang Ningbao could not help but bring up her difficulty with a guilty conscience. She had forgotten the important matter of preparing a wedding dress. In Changning Count Residence, no one reminded her to embroider a wedding dress and as someone with no experience, Jiang Ningbao did not know what to prepare.She already had dowry and she did not know if the elders in Changning Count Residence would add it or not. Jiang Ningbao felt they would not. Old Madam Jiang was hard to tell, but Changning count and Madam Zhang definitely would not.Especially Madam Zhang. She dared to scheme for her dowry so it would be weird if she added it. Moreover, fifth sister will also get married this year.Thinking that her fifth sister had First Madam Zhang finding a teacher for her, it seemed that it was a must to find an elderly woman to teach. She could not let something embarrassing happen when she got married.This was Jiang Ningbao\u2019s first marriage in her two lives.But Jiang Ningbao did not have the connection to find an elderly woman so she could only find Duke Ding to help.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s steps halted. He was clear on the little lady\u2019s situation. Her parents were deceased and she had no elder by her side. Old Madam Jiang did not care about the little lady much and Changning Countess could only stare at the little lady\u2019s things. Thinking of the little lady\u2019s situation, Duke Ding\u2019s heart felt a trace of pity.\u201cHand it to me.\u201d Duke Ding Xie Heng said.Jiang Ningbao\u2019s brows had a trace of joy and she hugged his arm tightly. Her eyes wandered and she smiled slyly, \u201cSir duke, how about you manage the matters of the marriage?\u201dAfter saying this, Jiang Ningbao felt that this suggestion was really great.\u201cAlright.\u201d Duke Ding Xie Heng looked at the arm she hugged as she smiled happily. He nodded expressionlessly and thought that the little lady seemed like a thieving cat when she smiled. Very cute.\u201cSir duke, this flower admiring banquet is boring. I won\u2019t attend next time. But I think, there won\u2019t be next time. At that time, I would\u2019ve gotten married to you. The only good thing was I made a friend. I hit it off with her. I really want her to be my sister-in-law, but she\u2019s the legal granddaughter of the left minister. The disparity between the two families is too big.\u201dJiang Ningbao spoke with a \u2018what a pity\u2019 face.She really liked Fu Wanning very much.Duke Ding Xie Heng placated with a faint voice, \u201cAnything is possible.\u201d Just like him and the little lady. He thought that he would be alone until he died. Who knew that his adopted son\u2019s ex-fiance would become his madam?Jiang Jin was talented and skilled. He will pass the imperial examination this year. In the future, with him taking care of him, a meteoric rise won\u2019t be a dream.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Just like me and the duke.\u201d Jiang Ningbao threw the pity in her heart and she smiled like a flower. She made use of every bit of time and space to flirt with Duke Ding. She did not know that she and Duke Ding Xie Heng thought the same thoughts like kindred spirits.Duke Ding Xie Heng\u2019s eyes turned darker.\u201cYes.\u201dThe two people intimately walked outside and the servants in King Rui Residence were shocked by this scene. Jiang fourth miss and Duke Ding actually held hands as they walked forward.Queen Rui knew this news from the servant and she was so excited that her eyes shone. She did not think that the first time Duke Ding joined the flower admiring banquet she held for his fiancee.She thought that Duke Ding had this fiance when he was about to be in his prime. Perhaps, he could only have his fiancee, so it was normal to look at her closely.Queen Rui gasped endlessly.\u201cEven Duke Ding was about to get married. Xiao Ran this little cub is still playing around. He threw one beauty after another into his courtyard. Which good lady would want to get married to him?\u201dThe servant beside lowered the head.There were many women who wanted to get married to the little king but mostly because of his status and identity, which the queen did not like. The ones he liked, the queen did not like, so they became the little king\u2019s concubines instead.This led to the beauties in the little king\u2019s courtyard increasing to a while one hundred and seven, more than the emperor\u2019s harem. In the whole capital, there won\u2019t be anyone who had more concubines than the little king.Little king\u2019s reputation outside was not that good.\u201cQueen, after the little king saw Jiang fourth miss, his standard went up and he did not find a new person to put in the courtyard lately.\u201d a trusted servant spoke carefully.Queen Rui became more anxious and felt regret.\u201cI should have proposed to Anyuan Marquis Residence when I knew Xiao Ran liked Anyuan Marquis\u2019 oldest legal daughter.\u201dQueen Rui did not like Yang Shuqing, feeling this lady\u2019s heart had vicious currents and she was ruthless and vicious. But her son was interested in her and wanted to marry her as his wife. Queen Rui rejected that time.Her son did not bring it up again.Now that her son finally had someone he wanted to marry, the other party already had an engagement.The trusted servant\u2019s head lowered. Her son worked by the little king\u2019s side. She did not dare to tell the queen that the little king no longer liked Anyuan Marquis Residence\u2019s legal daughter. Not only did he not like her, he even threw dirty water on said person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
