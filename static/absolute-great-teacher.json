Please collect the newbie gift pack as soon as possible!\u201dWhen he heard this voice for the third time, Sun Mo wanted nothing more than to smash the dog head of the other party.(It was fine if you don\u2019t want to extend a helping hand, but is there a need to taunt me like that?)Gurgle~Sun Mo\u2019s body sank downward. A large amount of lake water immediately splashed on his face, gushing into his mouth and nose.\u201cIf this is a swimming pool, how many mouthfuls of urine would I have drunk?\u201dSun Mo self-ridiculed, trying to suppress his nervous and scared emotions. If not, he was afraid he couldn\u2019t continue preserving.His swimming technique, the dog paddle, was something self-taught in a small river outside the village. If he was alone, he would be able to persist until he reached the shore. But now that he was pulling a girl through the water, he felt a little helpless.\u201cSave\u2026save me!\u201dThe black-haired girl struggled with all her might as she flailed about.\u201cStop moving about randomly or you will die!\u201dBefore Sun Mo finished his speech, he swallowed another mouthful of lake water. The suddenness of it made him involuntarily want to cough.\u201cThe Absolute Great Master System has been bound. Please collect the newbie gift pack as soon as possible!\u201cF***!\u201dSun Mo dragged the girl by her clothes and climbed to the shore as he panted wildly. Gazing at the surroundings like a wild dog, he then ruthlessly raised his middle finger, but there wasn\u2019t even a single person in the vicinity.The beautiful moonlight was like silver sand sprinkling on the grass. The Yunting Lake in the distance was glistening like crystal!\u201cWhat the hell?\u201dSun Mo furrowed his brows. It seemed that they were tight enough to crush a crab. Lowering his head, he cast another glance at the girl he had just saved. The girl was wearing ancient style clothing, and there was even a sachet at her waist!\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she Zhou Miao?\u201dSun Mo felt a little headache. After he had graduated, he went to No.2 High School to teach. In a short six years, he managed to teach two students who ended up going to Tsinghua and Peking University. His dazzling achievements caused him to take the lead role in high school.Initially, getting a raise and promotion should have been a cinch, but who knew that a girl named Zhou Miao from the next class had fallen for him. After he rejected her, Zhou Miao started to spread rumors that the two of them were together. She was preparing to make lies into the truth.Sun Mo didn\u2019t want his life to be destroyed. Hence, he had invited Zhou Miao to the park for a detailed chat. When they were rowing a boat in the lake, Zhou Miao suddenly lunged at him. This caused the two of them to fall into the lake together.\u201cWhat is this place exactly?\u201dThe flames of anger still burned in Sun Mo\u2019s heart. He glanced at the plants in the surroundings. The atmosphere was quiet and gloomy, and this seemed to be the outskirts. A look of doubt gradually appeared on his face.Cough, cough!The girl lying on the ground started to cough because of discomfort, spitting out a generous amount of lake water mixed with saliva. Her gaze was disorganized and perplexed, and she was gradually regaining consciousness.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d the girl asked weakly. \u201cLife is so beautiful, please don\u2019t commit suicide!\u201d\u201cDid water just enter your brain?\u201d Sun Mo was depressed. \u201cI have only played the computer I bought for a few thousand dollars a few times. Why would I commit suicide? Do I have nothing better to do?\u201d\u201cMn?\u201dThe girl had a stupefied look on her face. \u201cIn that case, why are you trying to drown yourself by jumping into the river?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dSun Mo suddenly discovered a problem. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you got into the water because you wanted to save me?\u201d\u201cWuwuwu~ Li Ziqi (herself in third person), you stupid fool!\u201d the girl muttered. Her beautiful face turned red instantly. She had originally come to rescue someone, but she ended up being rescued by him instead. How embarrassing.\u201cThe Absolute Great Master System has been bound. Please collect the newbie gift pack as soon as possible!\u201dThe annoying sound rang out once more, causing him to be extremely vexed.\u201cRing, ring, ring, can you stop being so annoying?\u201dClanking sounds~A large, shiny treasure chest suddenly appeared before Sun Mo. It was so bright that it almost blinded his dog eyes.\u201cDo you want to open it?\u201dThe system asked.Sun Mo glanced around, and his gaze fell onto the girl. After that, he grabbed the chest, seemingly understood that he was the only one who could see this.\u201cOpen or not?\u201dThe system continued asking.\u201cOpen, open, open. If there isn\u2019t a mansion or valuable treasures in there, I\u2019m going to bust open your dog head!\u201dSun Mo was extremely impatient.The treasure didn\u2019t give Sun Mo enough preparation time and immediately opened. A golden-colored book appeared in front of him, slowly spinning about.\u201cCongratulations. You obtained the grandmaster-grade \u2018Divine Sight\u2019. When you focus your sight, you can read all the data of your target.\u201dThe system\u2019s voice was as listless as a husky resting in the shadows of a roof on a hot summer day. Clearly, there was no sense of \u2018congratulations\u2019. It was clearly just conventional polite words.Sun Mo\u2019s lips twitched and he glanced at the girl who finally sat up. His gaze became focused, and three white large words \u2018Li Ziqi\u2019 floated above the head of the girl. This should be her name.Gradually, other streams of data jumped out of her body. The white words trembled unceasingly, and there were even lines of evaluation at the end.Strength: 4, level of an ordinary girl. Slightly stronger than someone who lacks the strength to even truss a chicken.Intellect: 10, numerical value off the charts! When the majority of people are compared to you, it would be a praise to even call them monkeys.Agility: 1, slightly more inferior than a klutz. Suggestion: Do not head out from your house, you face the risk of stumbling and tripping to your death if you walk.\u2026Sun Mo had a stupefied look on his face. What the hell was this?\u201cMn..my name is Li Ziqi!\u201dUpon seeing Sun Mo not speaking, the girl felt the atmosphere was a little awkward. Hence, she found a topic, wanting to alleviate the tense atmosphere.\u201cOh!\u201dSun Mo continued to ask, \u201cDid you jump into the water because you wanted to save me earlier?\u201d\u201cMn\u201d. But she hurriedly shook her head again, blushing furiously. After all, she had failed to save him and almost drowned instead. This was just too embarrassing.Sun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. (You are someone with 1 point of agility, but you still want to save others? Are you tired of living?)However, when he thought of how the girl intended to save him, his expression became much gentler.\u201cThanks.\u201dWhen she heard Sun Mo\u2019s thanks, Li Ziqi was like a rabbit being stepped on. She immediately leaped as her hands continued waving.\u201cNo, no, no need for you to thank me. I got the whole situation wrong and also, you are the one who saved me!\u201dLi Ziqi was evidently depressed. She didn\u2019t know when she would stop being such a klutz!In any case, Sun Mo had also been a teacher-in-charge for six years. What sort of students had he not seen before? With his experience and the information gained from Divine Sight, he was able to guess the reason behind Li Ziqi\u2019s depression.\u201cNot all gold is sufficiently pure, and nobody is perfect. You don\u2019t have to be so hard on yourself. So what if you are a klutz?\u201dSun Mo laughed. \u201cMoreover, you have a pair of good brains, your intellect alone can crush many people.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dLi Ziqi\u2019s eyes brightened. She inclined her head and stared at Sun Mo.\u201cMn!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t lie. This girl, whose intelligence was off the charts, was a top genius that all his rival teachers wanted. She would never be assigned to his class.\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026\u201dLi Ziqi suddenly thought of the rumors and gossip targeting her.\u201cHaha, don\u2019t care too much.\u201dA clumsy young girl really caused people to be fond of them. As Sun Mo spoke, he subconsciously patted her head slightly. \u201cIf your heart is clear, there\u2019s no need to fear any wind and rain!\u201dIt was only meant to be some words of consolation, but after Sun Mo finished speaking, a golden light suddenly shone around them.Swish~ swish~ swish~The strands of golden light were like the rain, sprinkling and scattering out, penetrating Li Ziqi\u2019s heart and nourishing it silently.Li Ziqi was shone upon by the golden light, and her body also began to emit golden-light as well. She suddenly felt extremely refreshed and vitalized. Her entire person became more optimistic and cheerful.\u201cYou\u2026you are a great teacher?\u201dLi Ziqi had a look of astonishment on her face as she looked at Sun Mo. This young man was at most 18 or 19 in age. Yet, he was already a great teacher?Sun Mo lowered his head and glanced at the clothes he was wearing. He was somehow clad in blue-robes of an ancient style too. Although the time he spent on shore wasn\u2019t long, he still understood his current situation. He should have traversed space-time and arrived at another world.This place was Middle-Earth. There were nine provinces and tens of countries in this world, and each of them was the capital of learning and education. Regardless of which country, great teachers were the most respectable of all occupations.However, it wasn\u2019t easy to be a great teacher. One had to have a moment of enlightenment, possess the great teacher halo, be proficient in several types of occupations, and pass a strict test by the Saint Gate.\u201cEarlier, that was the \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019, right?\u201dLi Ziqi had a look of worship in her eyes. \u201cThe effects are very strong!\u201dA great teacher could transmit the dao and dispel the students\u2019 doubts. The great teacher halo was a unique talent all great teachers had. The halos could help the students relax, allowing them to comprehend the teaching with higher efficiency.This \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 was able to let the logic of the great teacher influence the students. It would allow them to not forget this for several days and maintain the same state of heart.If a student hated studying and the great teacher used \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 to persuade the student, the student would be infused with \u2018fighting spirit\u2019 and work hard in their studies for several days.Staring at the strange gaze of little sister Li Ziqi, Sun Mo didn\u2019t know how to say the words he had been about to say \u2013 \u2018I just gained a flash of enlightenment earlier\u2019.At the same time, the system\u2019s notification rang out.Ding!Favorable impression from Li Ziqi +3.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi unlocked. Current state, neutral (3/100)!Remark: Put in more effort and gain the first enthusiastic fan-student on your path to be a great teacher!\u201cWhich academy are you from?\u201d asked Li Ziqi while blinking curiously.\u201cCentral Province Academy!\u201dSun Mo tidied up the memories in his mind and didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. The situation of his host was truly terrible. No wonder his \u2018past-self\u2019 would want to head to the outskirts to relax.After his past-self in this world had graduated, he luckily entered the Central Province Academy. It was just that the other graduates in the same batch as him had all become teaching assistants, while he was tossed to the logistics department.\u201cWow, the Central Province Academy! You are so awesome to be able to teach there!\u201dThe worship in Li Ziqi\u2019s eyes became even more fervent. That was one of the nine great academies in Middle-Earth. The Central Province Academy was extremely famous and had an outstanding reputation.\u201cHehe, you don\u2019t need to praise me.\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t know what he should say. 300 years ago, the Central Province Academy had experienced a huge calamity, and all the great teachers and genius students died completely. From then on, that setback led to total collapse. It gradually declined and only had its past reputation to depend on now.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the nine provinces of Middle-Earth, there were over thousands of academies. They were divided into different grades based on their size and number of qualified teachers. Currently, the Central Province Academy had already fallen to the \u2018D\u2019 grade. In the league tournament this year, if it continued to be ranked at the bottom, it would be delisted and removed from the education system.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t remember wrongly, it would soon be the student recruitment meet for the Central Province Academy, right? I\u2019ll go there and support you!\u201dLi Ziqi\u2019s smile was very sweet. Her adorable dimples seemed to be filled with honey.\u201cDing, mission issued. Please make Li Ziqi wholeheartedly take you on as her teacher within half-a-month. Reward: 1 mysterious treasure chest.\u201dThe voice of the system rang out in Sun Mo\u2019s ears, and it caused him to involuntarily curse silently in his heart. \u201cNow, I\u2019m just a part of the logistics department. I basically have no qualifications to take on disciples!\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2: Favorable Impression +1LordbluefireLordbluefireThe night was already late, the bonfire swayed gently in the wind.Li Ziqi, who was a budding beauty, emitted a dense air of innocence only teenage girls would have. This was especially so for her melon-shaped face. It was beautiful and adorable.Although she wasn\u2019t an adult yet, she already possessed the immature charm of one. A few years later, she would definitely rank among the top ranks of beauties and become famous throughout the world.Yet, Sun Mo had no time to admire her beauty. His brain was busy searching through the Great Absolute Teacher System.\u201cThe system can help the host to become a great absolute teacher. The host can gain an increase in favorable impressions through the system guidance and targets set.\u201cFavorable impressions can be transformed into gold coins and be used as the currency to purchase items from the system shopping store.\u201cMerchandise sold includes but is not limited to various spells, secret treasures, alchemical pills, absolute arts, and blueprints\u2026\u201dSun Mo read silently and chose to open up the system shopping store. A shop\u2019s shelf made of sandalwood appeared before his eyes. However, nothing was on it other than a glowing dark-red fruit at the right corner.\u201cStarmoon Fruit, price 1,000 favorable impression points. After consuming it, it will increase your level.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s expression became unsightly.\u201cAre you kidding me? Where\u2019s the bunch of good stuff promised? Why is there only one item? Do you believe that I\u2019ll smack your face?\u201dIn the continent of nine provinces, spirit qi was in abundance, and some distinguished sages had created various cultivation methods. If one trained their cultivation to the extreme, they could achieve eternal life and shatter the void. Up until now, tens of thousands of years had already passed in this world, and it had become a mature system.The first realm for cultivators was known as the body-refinement realm. Next was the spirit-refining realm.Energy was stored in your pores, transforming into spirit. When all 108 acupoints were cleared, the cultivator would step into the blood-ignition realm followed by the divine force realm. As the name implied, cultivators at the divine force realm had the strength that surpassed mortals.Sun Mo felt like the cultivation realms were the same as learning; both could grow based on cultivating oneself through the system. No matter what, he was still a postgraduate student. He didn\u2019t feel that cultivation would be difficult. Hence, compared to the Starmoon Fruit that could be used to increase his level and realm, he wanted an absolute art more.\u201cDon\u2019t need to be in a rush. The other items would gradually be unlocked!\u201dThe tone of the system wasn\u2019t fast nor slow.\u201cIs there something like the Art of Nine Negations? How about the Six-Meridians Divine Sword?\u201dSun Mo was a cultured youth. Usually, he would be reading novels on his phone in his idle time. When he had the feeling, he would even write some stories himself.\u201cNo!\u201dThe system was as calm as ever. \u201cBut there are better absolute arts than that.\u201dSun Mo and the system were squabbling, neglecting Li Ziqi at the side. However, she wasn\u2019t impatient and was staring at Sun Mo in interest.\u201cHe is quite good-looking!\u201dLi Ziqi bit her lips. Usually, people would always smile after looking at her. They would use all sorts of topics, trying to compliment her. But this young man didn\u2019t even glance at her directly.Ding!Favorable impression from Li Ziqi +1.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi. Current state, neutral (5/100)!\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, I won\u2019t bite.\u201dSun Mo squeezed out a smile, feeling puzzled in his heart. Why did her favorable impression of him increase? According to the system\u2019s explanation, he thought that he needed to provide teachings and guidance before the target\u2019s favorable impression of him would increase?\u201cThat\u2019s a great teacher\u2019s words and actions. The way they sit and walk can be considered role models. Your demeanor can also stir the hearts of students, causing them to generate respect and worship.\u201dThe system\u2019s explanation was very detailed. It felt a little like a caring older sister.\u201cWhat is a prestige connection then?\u201dSun Mo asked.\u201cHost\u2019s level is too low. Unable to reveal the information.\u201dThe system rejected him.Sun Mo continued to explore the system\u2019s functions as he felt his headache growing increasingly painful. When he first arrived, the memories in his brain were in chaos. Also, because he went into the water to save someone earlier, he expended quite a large amount of strength. He was incomparably weary and soon fell asleep involuntarily.\u2026Kua! Kua!A frog jumped onto Sun Mo\u2019s face without any regard for him. After leaving two wet prints, it leaped off again.\u201cThe dream last night was so long. But that girl was quite beautiful.\u201dThe slightly cool dewdrops wetted his body, making him extremely uncomfortable. Sun Mo casually wiped his face and when he turned, he directly knocked his head into a locust tree next to him.Bang!The sensation of pain drifted over.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream!\u201dSun Mo rubbed his forehead and searched for Li Ziqi. However, at the bonfire that was already extinguished, there was no one at all. Even so, there was a pink-color handkerchief tied around his left wrist.\u201cTen days later, see you at the student recruitment meet.\u201dThe beautiful-looking words exuded the gentle aura of a girl from a wealthy family.When Sun Mo thought of his terrible situation, he couldn\u2019t help but smile bitterly. If he was to let this girl know that he was just a logistic staff, wouldn\u2019t her disappointment shoot through the roof?He went to the lake\u2019s side to wash his face first. This face of his was 80% similar to him in his previous world, but it was slightly more good-looking with a few hints of delicateness and immaturity to be seen. On his countenance, no confidence was emitted, there was only trepidation.\u201cNo way!\u201dSun Mo was very satisfied. Everyone wanted to be more good-looking. In his past world, his handsome face had added some impression points for him before the vice headmaster. After all, there would always be more opportunities for good-looking people.\u2026The Jinling City was the ancient capital of the Six Dynasties. Although its bricks and tiles were covered with moss, the city had a rich historical background.He walked to the end of Hongwu Street, which was the location of the Central Province Academy. A majestic and gigantic stone gate exuded a feeling of tyranny and solemnness as it stood there.Sun Mo rushed back based on his memories. It was already close to noon.\u201cWhere did you go?\u201dMister Qin who was guarding the gate immediately stretched his head out when he saw Sun Mo.Sun Mo nodded and then quickly entered the campus.\u201cLi Gong wanted you to go to the logistics department and look for him straight.\u201dMister Qin had a very loud voice. No matter how he listened, Sun Mo could hear a gloating tone over his misfortune in his voice.The passing students also began to mumble to themselves as they pointed at Sun Mo. He was probably the most famous person in the school now. It was just that rather than fame, it was infamy.After he went up the office building and pushed open the logistics department door, a smell of cigarette smoke assailed his nose. Sun Mo hadn\u2019t seen anyone yet, but a scolding voice already rang out.\u201cWhere have you gone to? Do you know that during lesson times, you are not allowed to leave the campus for no reason? Do you think you are a great teacher?\u201dA middle-aged man sitting at the corner stood up and limped over. He pointed at Sun Mo and began cursing at him.\u201cHe isn\u2019t a teacher, but he is the fiance of the headmaster. So what even if he skipped work? Do you dare to interfere?\u201dA taunting voice that was exceptionally ear-piercing rang out.Sun Mo swept his gaze over; this voice belonged to a short-haired middle-aged man. He had a teapot in his right hand and would occasionally throw a few taunts over. Sun Mo remembered that this man was named Liu Tong.\u201cI don\u2019t care whose fiance you are. If there\u2019s a next time, you will immediately be fired!\u201dLi Gong scolded and his tone was filled with violent anger. \u201cNow, scram and go clean up the storehouses. I will do a check tomorrow morning.\u201dSun Mo then retreated.\u201cWait a minute. Your salary for this month will be reduced by half.\u201dLi Gong added. After that, he impatiently waved his hand like he was trying to chase a fly away.\u201cYou guys bully him so much. What if this brat really resigns?\u201dChen Mu who had a headful of white-hair felt some worry. He was afraid that they might be implicated. \u201cI heard that Headmaster An personally wrote a letter of appointment to hire him.\u201d\u201cOi, he is just someone who lives behind a woman\u2019s backing. What are you afraid of?\u201dLi Gong was filled with disdain. In any case, if the headmaster came down on them, there would be people above the headmaster protecting them. Besides, the faster Sun Mo was fired, the quicker he would be promoted.After an intern came to the school, they would be assigned to an experienced teacher. They would start from a teaching assistant and learn from the teacher. However, Sun Mo\u2019s situation was terrible. He was assigned to Li Gong.Li Gong wasn\u2019t a teacher. He was a foreman in the logistics department, and he did odd jobs for the school like repairing the tables and chairs. Basically, those with judgment could already tell that the chance of Sun Mo becoming a teacher wasn\u2019t great.\u201cHmph, with me around, forget about being a great teacher, he won\u2019t even be able to be a teacher in his life. If my mood is good, I can still teach him woodwork. At the very least, he would be able to fill his stomach.\u201dLi Gong drank a mouthful of tea and had a complacent look on his face. To him, he didn\u2019t have many chances to \u2018fix\u2019 intern teachers.Chen Mu opened his mouth, but he swallowed back the words he was about to speak. Forget it, he didn\u2019t want to interfere. Currently, many worrying matters were affecting the school, bringing plenty of troubles. It was best for him to protect himself and idle away while receiving his salary!Standing in the corridor, Sun Mo\u2019s expression was gloomy. He was never a person to turn the other cheek after being slapped. If it wasn\u2019t for him still not being familiar with this body and not understanding the concept of spirit qi, he would have definitely sent a punch over and taught the lame Li Gong why the flowers were red.\u201cLi Gong? I\u2019ll let you boss around for now!\u201dSun Mo made a note about this lame cripple in the notebook of his heart. \u201cAlso that fiancee of mine? She seemed to be very fickle with this relationship.\u201dThree years ago, the old headmaster of the Central Province Academy had failed to obtain the laurel of a Saint. Although he didn\u2019t die, he was still unconscious now.His son wasn\u2019t filial and had escaped his responsibility. Thus, his granddaughter An Xinhui had no choice but to step up temporarily and bear the headmaster\u2019s role.An Xinhui had peerless looks and a pure heart. She had graduated from the Heavenly Mystery Academy of Cloud Province. That academy was different from this \u2018famous school\u2019 that had long since fallen to the \u2018D\u2019 grade. It was one of the nine top famous schools in the world.Even in the Heavenly Mystery Academy of Cloud Province, An Xinhui was still the cream of the crop and had obtained an outstanding reputation. During her first year, she had already made her way into the Devastatingly Beauty Rankings.However, being a headmaster and a student was two different things. In these three years, An Xinhui worked her heart out but was still unable to prevent the Central Province Academy\u2019s decline.After Sun Mo arrived at the school, he merely saw An Xinhui from afar during a meeting. In fact, they didn\u2019t even have any private communication.His past-self had come to the Central Province Academy after graduation because he wanted to help this fiancee of his who was childhood sweethearts with him. His goal was to let the Central Province Academy return to the top nine famous schools in the world. However, all of a sudden, people started labeling him as a \u2018soft-rice guy\u2019. Also, he was tossed into the logistics department. Leaving aside getting a good position, he didn\u2019t even manage to become a normal teaching assistant.\u201cAs a soft-rice guy, didn\u2019t I lose out too much?\u201dSun Mo was speechless.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDing, new mission available. Please become a teaching assistant in one month. Reward: One silver chest.\u201dThe system\u2019s voice rang out with no prior signs.Note:Art of Nine Negations and Six-Meridians Divine Sword are both ultimate-level martial arts in Jinyong Novels.Soft-rice guy: A guy that lived off a woman.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3: Divine SightLordbluefireLordbluefireSun Mo wanted to curse.Becoming a teaching assistant? How could things be so easy? Right now, his job at the logistics department was insecure. No matter what, he had been a teacher-in-charge for six years and had experienced office politics before.If there was no one instructing Li Gong to do this, a logistics supervisor like him wouldn\u2019t constantly target Sun Mo without any benefits. Unless, of course, he was so idle that his balls hurt.\u201cSo someone is hiding in the shadows, targeting me? I will find out who you are and chase you out of the school.\u201dSun Mo vowed. After heading down, his expression returned to normal. The old headmaster had once said that even if one was so frantic that their heart chilled, they must not allow anyone to see it from their external expressions.After passing by the martial lecture hall, he continued forward and walked through the field. He then saw a stretch of storerooms northwest from here. These storehouses were used to store junk.Sun Mo walked for a bit and knew that Li Gong was purposely making things difficult for him. These storerooms were in a state of half-broken for many years. Rust mottled their doors. Clearly, it had been a very long time since anyone had used them.He casually chose a storehouse and opened the door. The smell of dust particles lying on molded timber assaulted his nostrils.\u201cClean up everything by tomorrow morning? It\u2019s impossible even if the time limit was a week.\u201dSun Mo rubbed his nose. There was no need to ask, he would definitely be cursed at by Li Gong tomorrow morning.He casually picked a few items up. They were either damaged tables or tattered sofas. He would occasionally see a few rusted arrows on the ground too.Sun Mo instantly lost all interest in tidying this place up. He found a table designed for the game of Go and casually wiped it twice before sitting on it. As he basked in the sun\u2019s rays, he began to analyze the Divine Sight spell he had obtained from the Absolute Great Teacher System yesterday.\u201cWhen the user focuses his attention at the target, the user will be able to see each and every data of the target. The targets include but aren\u2019t limited to humans, animals, cultivation arts, and items. However, it had the best effect on humans!\u201d\u201cNote: The higher your proficiency, the more details you would be able to see.\u201dThe system gave him a timely reminder.\u201cEven cultivation arts and items can be seen through? This is awesome then!\u201dSun Mo was shocked. Even an ordinary teacher would understand how powerful this spell was even if they used their knees to think.What did a teacher need the most? It was naturally a comprehensive understanding of each student. Now, he would be able to read their data, as well as their potential value just by focusing on them. How terrifying was this?The system didn\u2019t reply, but Sun Mo could fantasize silently. If the system had a face, it would definitely have a reserved yet filled with superiority smile.\u201cThe grandmaster-grade is the proficiency index, right?\u201dSun Mo speculated.\u201cThat\u2019s right, the proficiency index is a unique method of the Absolute Great Teacher System to evaluate the standards and grades of skills and techniques.\u201dThe system acted like a caring elder sister. \u201cProficiency index can be categorized as elementary, good, expert, grandmaster, ancestor, and legend grade!\u201dHis Divine Sight was now at the elementary grade. The amount of details he can obtain is just barely satisfactory. At the good-grade, it would automatically show more basic data of the target. At the expert-grade, he would then be able to see the target\u2019s potential value.And at the grandmaster-grade, Divine Sight would show the target\u2019s strength, weaknesses, talent, recent body condition, etc. In any case, the data obtained would be extremely thorough and detailed.\u201cHaha, getting a grandmaster-grade Divine Sight Spell\u2026the newbie gift pack is truly generous.\u201dAfter reading the detailed introduction, Sun Mo had a wide smile on his face. He looked like a fox that had succeeded in stealing grapes from an orchard.\u201cThat\u2019s only natural. If you completely master the grandmaster-grade Divine Sight, even if it was a young girl who got hemorrhoids, she wouldn\u2019t be able to hide it from your eyes.\u201dThe system was complacent.\u201cHow do I level it up to the ancestor-grade?\u201dSun Mo licked his lips and impatiently focused his sight as he stared at the junk in his surroundings.[A desk, made from poplar wood. Damage degree over 70%, impossible to repair.][Rusted arrow, during creation, the intensity of the fire wasn\u2019t high enough. This is considered an inferior product.][Wall, constructed using stone materials from Wuman Mountain. The creator put in a lot of effort when grinding it, it can be reused.]\u2026Before Sun Mo\u2019s eyes, dense streams of data instantly floated up, almost causing him to be blinded. However, he couldn\u2019t bear to close his eyes. The feeling of instantly getting the data was too satisfying. It was like anything before his eyes would transform into beauties who took off all their clothes, allowing him to view everything about them.\u201cTruly a panoramic view!\u201dSun Mo continued turning his head. He glanced at an abandoned book, a torn and tattered love letter, and paint sprayed on a wall by teenagers who just experienced their first awakening of love two days ago.The system didn\u2019t reply, but Sun Mo didn\u2019t care. He was having fun playing. After looking through everything in the storeroom, he turned his attention to the next storeroom.Suddenly, a stream of red words appeared among the complicated data.[Wooden blade, made of black sandalwood. A great master in smithing spent a total of three years of his efforts to create this weapon in the Liang Province.][This timber\u2019s quality is tough and unyielding, comparable to steel. It would also emit a weak fragrance that could persist for tens of years. It has the miraculous effect of calming one\u2019s mind and heart and dispelling nightmares.]This was a spirit weapon and would definitely cost a lot. However, what caused Sun Mo to feel shocked was the description written in red.[On this wooden blade, the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art is inscribed. It\u2019s a peerless-grade saint-tier product.]\u201cIs this real or not?\u201dSun Mo found this a little hard to believe. Through the memories he got after fusing with this body, he knew that the cultivation arts in Middle-Earth were divided into three tiers \u2013 Saint, Heaven, and Earth. Each tier was further divided into inferior, average, superior, and peerless grades.Peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art was considered a pinnacle cultivation art in Middle-Earth.\u201cSuch a powerful art was engraved onto a wooden blade?\u201dSun Mo immediately checked it. On the handle, tiny words like flies were carved in flamboyant calligraphy. The words were extremely graceful and elegant. From this, one could tell that the writer had very high attainments in calligraphy.\u201cIt\u2019s night, the dark clouds are lowered. I fought against my good friend in chess for three months plus and have not suffered a single defeat. Due to my joyous mood, I hereby carve the Formless Divine Art onto the wooden blade and bequeath it to a fated person.\u201dSun Mo was speechless. From the words, he could tell that the writer was a passionate person. If it was him in the writer\u2019s stead, he would also be so happy that he would head to a KTV to sing until the place exploded.What Sun Mo didn\u2019t know was that the unlucky person who had lost throughout the three months went into seclusion for three years after that event. After he exited seclusion, he continuously defeated tens of national experts from countless countries in the nine provinces. Everyone then gave him the title of \u2018Chess Saint\u2019. He had not lost a single chess battle from then on until now.After reading carefully, Sun Mo exclaimed loudly.\u201cBeautiful!\u201dLeaving aside how good the divine art was, just the words alone were sufficient for him to take it out and admire it once every day.Although Sun Mo had already fused with the memories of this body and understood the concept of spirit qi and some basic cultivation methods, he didn\u2019t hastily cultivate the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art. He locked the storeroom door and went to the library to check on some information, wanting to understand this country in detail first.This was something Sun Mo had planned to do since the beginning. As a man who loved to plan and react, Sun Mo\u2019s good look wasn\u2019t the only thing that secured him the position of a teacher-in-charge not long after he graduated.The library of the Central Province Academy was very large. There were also many people. However, the atmosphere was so quiet that one could hear if a pin dropped. Every student would do their utmost to lighten their footsteps even if they were walking.\u201cThe mood of learning is excellent!\u201dSun Mo stood before some wooden bookshelves and stared at these students who seemed as though they just came out from ancient era dramas. When he inhaled deeply, he could smell a mixture of ink and incense.Reading history was undoubtedly the shortcut to understanding a country and its people.There were nine provinces on Middle-Earth namely, Liang Province, Xia Province, Barbarian Province, Jing Province, Central Province, Serene Province, Cloud Province, and Sea Province.Sun Mo was part of the Tang People in Central Province. He was now living in Jinling, a place that was close to China\u2019s ancient eras. There were emperors and concubines, subjects and generals, and also bandits and refugees. However, the greatest difference was that this world was filled with dense amounts of spirit qi.Breathing spirit qi in and out could strengthen one\u2019s physique. Hence, cultivators were born. The weak ones had punching strength reaching 500kg, and they could break stone and iron easily. The strong ones could even shift mountains and overturn seas, including summoning the wind and rain.Who didn\u2019t wish to be immune to a hundred diseases or have a longevity of 1,000 years? Hence, during this golden period, these cultivation academies were growing like the spring bamboo after the rain, popping up one after another.Each province had a peak-level academy. The Central Province Academy had once been the top-ranked academy in Central Province, and this was why it managed to have the words \u2018Central Province\u2019 in its name, indicating the school\u2019s glory and honor. However, right now, it had fallen from one of the top nine ranks to the \u2018D\u2019 grade. If it wasn\u2019t able to pass the league tournament at the end of the year, it would be removed from the system and forced to become an abandoned school.\u201cSigh, so tragic!\u201dSun Mo also felt a headache for his fiancee whom he hadn\u2019t met yet. Return to the top nine rankings? This was basically an impossible mission.There were several manuals of cultivation arts in the library, and the students could flip through them casually. The cultivation art that the past Sun Mo had practiced was the Overflow Rain Sword, and it could also be found here. This art was extremely common and its might was ordinary.There were much fewer heaven-tier and zero saint-tier cultivation arts in the world. Hence, Sun Mo treated the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art he had obtained by chance as a supreme treasure. He began to seriously read it.This cultivation art could be split into nine levels. The essence was using the formless to triumph over the myriad manifestations and the shapeless to win against the myriad of shapes. Simply speaking, it could copy all types of moves from the opponents and was able to produce a stronger level of might than them.\u201cMn?\u201dAs a teacher, Sun Mo was very sensitive toward words like \u2018copy\u2019. But this cultivation art could be used to \u2018feed\u2019 moves to students.Regardless of doing questions, playing chess, or battling, the more opponents he encountered, the more experience he would gain. If he did focused training in one of those areas, he would have already won 30% of the fight before they even fought.\u201cIf my student is going to face an enemy, I can \u2018feed\u2019 the moves of his enemy to them. Wouldn\u2019t that be equivalent to winning?\u201dSun Mo was unable to restrain a smile. It seemed that he was truly fated with the teaching job. As this place was a school, the person who had left behind the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art should be an extremely famous great teacher with high prestige.\u201cThanks!\u201dSun Mo expressed his gratitude softly. He had initially been worrying about his livelihood. But with this cultivation art, leaving aside an ordinary school, even if he was here in Central Province Academy, he was confident that he would stand out among his peers.He then stretched his body before leaning against a chair.\u201cBecoming a teaching assistant in a month? I will accomplish that for you in half-a-month!\u201dSun Mo was currently feeling a little arrogant. However, his happiness soon turned into sadness.\u201cAs you wish!\u201dThe voice of the system rang out. This time, the tone wasn\u2019t like a caring elder sister, but rather like the evil step-mom that abused cinderella. \u201cDing! The duration of the mission has changed. Please become a teaching assistant in half-a-month. If you fail, there will be severe punishment!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo wanted to cry but no tears were coming out. \u201cI was just speaking randomly. You wouldn\u2019t take my words for real, right?\u201dSwish~A flash of golden light suddenly spread throughout the library. Sun Mo\u2019s mind was fatigued from checking the information all morning. But now, he instantly felt refreshed and inspired. It was like he had just been injected with stimulants.\u201cA great teacher halo!\u201dSome students exclaimed in shock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4: Great Teacher HaloLordbluefireLordbluefireA twenty-year-old young man entered the reading zone, and many students in the surroundings immediately stood up as they bowed and greeted him.\u201cTeaching assistant Qin!\u201dOn Middle-Earth, the academic atmosphere was flourishing, and a good system where students were taught to respect their teachers was ingrained in everyone. Moreover, teaching assistant Qin was even displaying a \u2018wide learning and retentive memory\u2019 halo, causing everyone\u2019s learning efficiency to double. Just based on this reason, it was normal for all the students to greet him.Qin Fen was dressed in blue-color robes that represented the identity of a teaching assistant. He had a smile on his face as he pressed his hands in a downward motion, indicating the students to continue with their learning.\u201cTeaching assistant Qin\u2019s great teacher halo is so large. It seems that he is about to be converted into a substitute teacher!\u201d\u201cAre your words not superfluous? He is a graduate of Jixia Learning Palace of Xia Province. That\u2019s one of the nine great schools!\u201d\u201cAi, I heard that our school has only recruited three graduates from the famous schools this year. How miserable.\u201dWhispers began to ring out from the surroundings. The status of a graduate from a famous school would always gain the recognition of everyone. The reason why the hearts of the students were filled with respect was also largely due to the three words \u2018Jixia Learning Palace.\u201dThe corner of Sun Mo\u2019s lips curled.On Middle-Earth, if one wanted to become a teacher, it wasn\u2019t easy. They first had to gain enlightenment and produce a great teacher halo. This depended on the teacher\u2019s individual talent. It could allow the students to produce twice the results with half the effort when it came to studies.For example, after the \u2018wide learning and retentive memory\u2019 halo was used, the students would enter a state of having wide learning and a retentive memory. In this period, their memory would be strengthened, and their comprehension ability would be elevated, allowing their studying efficiency to be boosted several times.One wouldn\u2019t be able to gain a great teacher halo from postnatal learning efforts. They could only depend on gaining enlightenment before they could obtain one. Hence, the number of great teachers on Middle-Earth was not a lot.If one wanted to become a teacher, the first barrier was to gain enlightenment and obtain a \u2018self-taught\u2019 halo before they were 18 years old.One must know that enlightenment was a miraculous state that was extremely rare and abstruse. The probability of one having it was akin to finding someone in a crowd of millions.Gaining enlightenment of the \u2018self-taught\u2019 halo represented that there were no problems with your intelligence. You could also cultivate and comprehend true intent even without the guidance of a teacher.At the same time, with the \u2018self-taught\u2019 halo, your chance of gaining enlightenment would be elevated. Throughout your teaching career, you might be able to obtain a new great teacher halo.If you wanted to gauge how outstanding a teacher was, you could just take a look at the number of their great teacher halos.The levels of great teachers were gauged by \u2018stars\u2019. Other than the \u2018self-taught\u2019 halo, if one obtained another three great teacher halos and was also proficient in a secondary occupation, that person would be a 1-star great teacher.9-star great teachers were the pinnacle. They were also known as secondary saints.\u201cI\u2019m not even a teaching assistant!\u201dSun Mo ridiculed himself. The status and respect a great teacher could get in the society wasn\u2019t something an ordinary teacher could compare to. After gaining enlightenment of the \u2018self-taught\u2019 halo at the age of 16, the Sun Mo of the past hadn\u2019t acquired any other halos until yesterday when he was drowned. From this, one could see how difficult it was.Speaking of which, the Sun Mo of this world had gone to the outskirts to relax and he simply wanted to swim a bit because he was bored. In the end, this caused Li Ziqi to misunderstand that he was committing suicide. Li Ziqi jumped into the water to save him. In the end, the Sun Mo of this world had drowned to death in order to save Li Ziqi. This also caused him (Sun Mo of the other world) to have the opportunity to cross-over to this world.\u201cAi, you are really a good person!\u201dSun Mo sighed. That \u2018priceless advice\u2019 halo was something the Sun Mo of this world had comprehended before his death. He didn\u2019t even get to use it once and had benefited Sun Mo of the other world.The learning atmosphere in the Central Province Academy was very rich. For the library, other than every morning when it was temporarily closed for half an hour for the sake of cleaning, it would be open every day of the year.\u201cDing! Midnight passed. The lucky treasure chest is refreshed!\u201dAs the system\u2019s reminder rang out, a red-colored chest with a gigantic word \u2018fortune\u2019 imprinted on it appeared before Sun Mo.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201dSun Mo glanced at it. Although it was already late at night, there were still many students immersing themselves in learning.\u201cEvery day after midnight, the host will get a chance to draw a prize.\u201dThe system continued, \u201cIf you find this troublesome, you can store the treasure chests first and choose a good date before opening them all.\u201d\u201cWill the chance of getting a rare prize be higher if I burn incense, take a bath, kowtow, and offer my worship to the heavens?\u201dFor someone as unlucky as him, he could only use some metaphysics methods to increase his chances of getting a good prize. For example, the simplest ten-draws at one go.The system didn\u2019t reply. Clearly, it didn\u2019t wish to answer such a retarded question.\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Open it!\u201dWith a treasure chest before his eyes, who would be able to control their excitement?There were no cool effects. The treasure chest popped open and a tiny clump of soil appeared before his eyes.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dSun Mo was happy. Could it be he was about to become extremely lucky?\u201cJust a clump of soil. It is considered a consolation prize to encourage you to try again next time.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of shitty values do you have? Do you think I will treat a clump of soil, which I received from a reward, like a precious meal coupon?\u201dIn Sun Mo\u2019s heart, he wanted to curse at the system\u2019s mother. If the prize was really a food coupon, even if it was just a 20% discount, it could allow him to have an egg in his breakfast, and he would be happy for it.The system fell silent. Other than to provide the necessary explanation, it wouldn\u2019t accompany the host to talk nonsense.Thinking of food made Sun Mo feel a little hungry. Hence, he went back to his dorm room.The lodging of intern teachers was arranged by the school, and it wasn\u2019t far from the student zone. They could stay for three months without charge. Before this, the intern teachers used to be able to stay for a year, and if they ate their three meals in the canteen, the meals would be free. However, the financial situation of the Central Province Academy was very bad now. Hence, all these benefits were either removed or reduced.It was said that even with some of the new year\u2019s benefits, the conditions became much more inferior. For this, the teachers were grumbling privately.The dormitory building was constructed near a lake, it was a small building of five levels. Sun Mo stayed on the third level of the eastern side. When he returned, the three dorm mates of his hadn\u2019t fallen asleep yet.Zhang Sheng, who was sitting on his bed and meditating, opened his eyes and looked at Sun Mo who pushed the door open. He closed his eyes again as a smile of disdain appeared on his lips.\u201cYo? You are back?\u201dLudi, a burly and muscular youth who seemed more like a blacksmith than a teacher, smiled. In passing, he lifted the teapot at the side. \u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d\u201cNo need, thanks!\u201dWhen Sun Mo sat on his bed, memories of his three roommates were also recalled.Every one of them graduated from the Songyang Academy. Zhang Sheng\u2019s personality was arrogant, but his strength wasn\u2019t weak. He was the most confident of them all. As for Ludi, he would always smile no matter who he was talking to. His attitude was humble. And for the last one, a young man with frog-like eyes, his name was Yuan Feng.\u201cDid your fiance tell you any news through the grapevine? Come and share with us!\u201dYuan Feng spoke. His voice was thin and sounded somewhat ear-piercing.Sun Mo furrowed his brows slightly. When they had first arrived in the Central Province Academy, after knowing Headmaster An Xinhui was his fiancee, Yuan Feng had been very ardent and wanted to please him. He had even treated him to a meal before. However, as the others became teaching assistants while Sun Mo was tossed into the logistics department, Yuan Feng\u2019s attitude rapidly changed.This sentence was filled with mocking intent and was roughly inquiring about non-public information.\u201cOh yes, you haven\u2019t returned the money from our last meal. When will you be returning it?\u201dYuan Feng didn\u2019t have any intention to spare Sun Mo. \u201cJinling City is bustling and prosperous. It isn\u2019t easy to stay here for the long-term. If the school hires me, I still have to rent a house, and it will be another large amount of expense.\u201dPak!A tael of silver was tossed to Yuan Feng\u2019s bed.Yuan Feng\u2019s eyes brightened. He hurriedly grabbed it and tested its genuineness by biting it.Sun Mo checked his possessions. Other than three sets of clothes, two pairs of cloth shoes, a few novels, and a money pouch with some fragments of silver, he had nothing else.The cloth shoes were something his mother personally sewn for him. The stitches were very close together.\u201cYour wooden blade isn\u2019t bad. Where did you buy it?\u2019Ludi sniffed and turned his gaze onto the wooden blade made from black sandalwood. It was unknown whether it was his illusion or not, but he could sense a faint sense of fragrance entering his nostrils.\u201cI picked it up.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s words were simple and concise.This blade was created after a blacksmith in Liang Province had spent three years of effort on it. Even if it was abandoned in the storehouse for over ten years collecting dust. The fragrance of the wood remained somewhat.\u201cI will give you 100 taels of silver. Sell it to me!\u201d said Zhang Sheng.Zhang Sheng\u2019s father was a landlord, and his family-owned good agricultural land and many fields. He didn\u2019t lack money.\u201cEven if you give me a million taels of gold, I won\u2019t sell it!\u201dSun Mo was a little unhappy. Zhang Sheng\u2019s tone was extremely arrogant, like he was asking for a beating.\u201cHmph, you dumb fool. You lost out on a chance of striking it rich.\u201dZhang Sheng closed his eyes. He was only curious for a while and felt that the wooden blade wasn\u2019t bad. But even if Sun Mo changed his mind and agreed to the 100 taels of silver now, he wouldn\u2019t agree.\u201cHehe!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. (If I told you that the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art is engraved on this wooden blade, even if you sell your as*hole, you won\u2019t be able to afford this.)A peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art. Let alone 1 million taels of gold, even if it was changed to 1 million spirit stones, Sun Mo wouldn\u2019t sell it.\u201cHow\u2019s the work in the logistics department? Is it tiring? In any case, being a teaching assistant is really tiring. I feel like sleeping the moment I return,\u201d said Yuan Feng\u201cWhen we ate together previously, we spent a total of 30+ coins. Just consider that I treat you then. Pay me back the excess,\u201d Sun Mo spoke to Yuan Feng.Sun Mo didn\u2019t intend to suffer this disadvantage. A tael of silver was worth 100 coins.\u201cI don\u2019t have spare change now. I will return the money to you a few days later.\u201dYuan Feng made an excuse while coldly mocking Sun Mo in his heart. Because Sun Mo was An Xinhui\u2019s fiance, many people were unhappy with him, feeling that he was a toad lusting after a swan\u2019s flesh. Hence, they were looking for an opportunity to prank him. He wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on to his job in the logistics department for long, let alone being a teaching assistant.If he delayed a few days more and waited for Sun Mo to be fired, he wouldn\u2019t need to pay back the 70 coins.Pak!Sun Mo took two steps forward and arrived before Yuan Feng\u2019s bed. His hand hoisted Yuan Feng\u2019s clothes and pulled him up.\u201cPay me, now!\u201dSun Mo stared at Yuan Feng, his tone was icily cold.\u201cEh!\u201dNot only was Yuan Feng and Lu Di stunned, but even Zhang Sheng at the side had a face full of astonishment. Why did Sun Mo who had a kind and gentle personality suddenly flip out?\u201cRelease me!\u201dYuan Feng recovered from his shock and felt extremely angered. He had long since made some inquiries and knew that Sun Mo had just entered the blood-ignition realm recently. Sun Mo was a level lower than him and would definitely not be his opponent.\u201cDon\u2019t fight!\u201dLudi was shocked. He hurriedly rushed over and tried to stand between them.\u201cGet out of the way!\u201dYuan Feng wasn\u2019t going to accept this.\u201cNow, it is still the intern period. What if both of you are fired because of fighting?\u201dIf Ludi wasn\u2019t afraid of being implicated, he would cheer them on to fight. After all, if two people were fired, he would have two fewer competitors.No, just one competitor less. Sun Mo was trash. It was basically confirmed that he wouldn\u2019t be able to stay here any longer.\u201d\u201cIf you want to fight, scram outside and do it!\u201dZhang Sheng\u2019s expression turned heavy. He was also worried about the consequences.Pak!Sun Mo stretched his hand and grabbed the tael of silver in Yuan Feng\u2019s hand back. \u201cOh, come look for me when you have the spare change then.\u201d\u201cDo you really think you will be able to marry Headmaster An Xinhui?\u201dYuan Feng mocked, \u201cLet me tell you this, you won\u2019t be able to eat the \u2018soft rice\u2019 you are planning to.\u201d\u201cOh is that so? Even so, I\u2019m still better than someone like you who doesn\u2019t even qualify to eat \u2018soft rice\u2019.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips twitched as he revealed a smile. It was as though the sunlight of spring cascaded down on him. His white teeth were so dazzling that it would cause one to feel dizzy.\u201cThis fellow has such a poisonous tongue!\u201dLudi mused silently. (How infuriating are these words. Are you simply impressive because you are handsome?)\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201dYuan Feng was so angered that his heart thumped violently. His face looked even more like a frog now. His fist was clenched tightly as he glared at Sun Mo\u2019s face.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2013\u2013\u2013Note:Eating soft rice means a grown man depending on a woman for survival.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although a conflict had just occurred, his inner heart was calm. This was because he was confident that as long as Yuan Feng had some brains, he would endure it. Even if he wasn\u2019t able to endure it, the two other roommates would stop him.Leaving aside the fact that one couldn\u2019t break the school rules during the internship period or they would be fired, he was now already targeted by malicious people. They were just waiting for him to commit a mistake before firing him.If Yuan Feng attacked, he would be out of luck together.Naturally, if a fight broke out, Sun Mo wasn\u2019t scared either.\u201cI still have to quickly research about spirit qi and succeed in training my Grand Universe Formless Divine Art. If a conflict occurs again, who would still be quarreling? I will directly explode their dog heads!\u201dFor a conflict of this level, Sun Mo might seem extremely agitated and wanted to fight the moment they quarreled. However, his heart was extremely calm. He had long since considered all the situations that would happen and how to handle them.Yuan Feng\u2019s eyes were protruding. He felt extremely disgruntled and smashed his fist against a wall.\u201cThe day he is sacked will be the day I\u2019ll buy a hundred firecrackers to set off, sending him off \u2018respectfully\u2019.\u201dYuan Feng gritted his teeth.\u201cThat fellow is done for sure. Why do you have to lower yourself to his level?\u201dLudi consoled. From his point of view, there was basically no hope for Sun Mo to join the faculty. As Yuan Feng had a high possibility of being his future colleague, he would naturally stand on Yuan Feng\u2019s side.The campus under the starlight had a different feel to it. The night wind gusted as Sun Mo took a night walk, pondering over the matters of him and his fiancee.Although An Xinhui was older than him by three years, the two of them were childhood sweethearts.As An Xinhui grew older, her shocking talent was also displayed and she eventually chose to join the Heavenly Mystery Academy of Cloud Province. Also, her fame began to spread when she was just a freshman.On the contrary, Sun Mo\u2019s aptitude was far inferior. He was only slightly stronger than ordinary people. He could only depend on his hard work and barely manage to join the Songyang Academy.Sun Mo knew that he wasn\u2019t worthy of An Xinhui. He also didn\u2019t take the joking words of the old headmaster to heart. But who knew that a few days before he graduated, An Xinhui suddenly sent a personally written letter of appointment and marriage contract to him. Other than hiring him to be an intern in the Central Province Academy, she also hoped that they could finalize their marriage as soon as possible.An Xinhui was very beautiful, and she was Sun Mo\u2019s first love. Hence, the moment he graduated, he packed up and came over quickly. In the end, he was targeted everywhere and chased into the logistics department.\u201cMy old self is so stupid. There are definitely some ulterior motives behind all this.\u201dSun Mo was speechless. He also understood why the old Sun Mo would head to the outskirts to relax. This feeling was like when one was waiting to eat a sumptuous lobster meal and found out that they could only eat shit.\u201cWhat should I do then?\u201dSun Mo most probably wouldn\u2019t be able to return. Besides, he had the two missions the Absolute Teacher System had given him. It seemed that he could only continue being a teacher.Luckily, he had six years of experience being a teacher-in-charge and he also possessed the Divine Sight now. With them, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem for him to establish a foothold in the Central Province Academy.However, Sun Mo seemed to have forgotten that the things taught here weren\u2019t foreign languages, physics, or chemistry. It was martial arts, spirit rune words, herbology, astrology, etc.\u201cI wonder how\u2019s the salary is like. Would the pay be the same even if one worked for five years straight?\u201dWhen he thought about the terrifying rental, Sun Mo suddenly panicked. The rental prices of Jinling City wouldn\u2019t be so high as to cause people to commit suicide, right?The Sorrowless Lake of the Central Province Academy was a famous scenery spot in Jinling City. Under the silver moonlight, it looked even more beautiful.Sun Mo suddenly heard a slight noise coming from the forest of his right when he was walking. He hesitated and eventually decided to enter.In the sparse forest, there was a half-naked youth currently practicing his fist techniques. His cotton pants were drenched with sweat and were rolled up. He was wearing a pair of cloth shoes.Sweat trickled down his back. As he executed the military fist technique, his beads of sweat also scattered through the air from the impact.Sun Mo had the impulse to whistle in admiration. The figure of this youth was really good. Although he wasn\u2019t tall, there were no signs of any excess flesh on his body. The contours of his muscles were clear, and his physique was robust. The sight of this youth caused Sun Mo to recall the powerful slender figure of Bruce Lee.Bang! Bang! Bang!The gusts of wind from his punches broke the air, creating low booming sounds. The young man was very focused. He attempted to execute each of his punches perfectly. He didn\u2019t bother to glance at Sun Mo, a stranger who suddenly arrived.Sun Mo crossed his arms and leaned against a maple tree at the side as he watched.His Divine Sight was activated.One meter above the young man\u2019s head, three words floated out.\u201cQi Shengjia? This name isn\u2019t bad.\u201dSun Mo praised silently.After that, streams of data floated out from other parts of his body.Strength: 8, he\u2019s considered outstanding among peers. It isn\u2019t a problem for him to kill a bull with his fists.Intellect: 4, a little wooden (slow thinking) and slow of speech. He only knows how to train diligently.Agility: 6, ordinary standard.Will: 3, can reach 7 points at its peak. It isn\u2019t normal for such a young man to have this temperament.\u2026\u201cWill?\u201dCompared to Li Ziqi, this Qi Shengjia\u2019s data had an additional \u2018will\u2019 stat. There were also red words describing it.\u201cRecently encountered a setback, his will is gradually weakening.\u201d\u201cThis Absolute Great Teacher System is truly personalized. It even knows how to add a note of importance in red!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. In his mind, he asked the system, \u201cWhat is the normal standard of an ordinary male adult\u2019s intellect?\u201d\u201cFive!\u2019The system\u2019s reply was concise and comprehensive, as though if it said an extra word, it would get tired to death.\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean this Qi Shengjia is a little dumb?\u201dSun Mo was speechless. The system\u2019s reply was too simple. However, given Sun Mo\u2019s intellect, he understood that each respective stat of an ordinary person was 5.The system didn\u2019t have the obligation to chat with him.\u201cEndurance: 7, Strength Eruption: 6. Not bad!\u201dSun Mo thought of Li Ziqi. That beautiful girl\u2019s intellect was 10, and so her potential value was extremely high. Although she was a klutz, the system still recommended him to take her as a disciple.As for this person, after Sun Mo found his potential value data, which was hovering at the side of his right leg, he involuntarily shook his head.Potential Value: Extremely low!Even if Sun Mo didn\u2019t know the average potential value of ordinary people, when he saw the words \u2018extremely below average\u2019, he knew that this guy had no future.Age: 15.Realm: 3rd level of Body-Refinement RealmWhen Sun Mo saw this, he frowned. After reading for a day in the library, he had understood the dao of cultivation.The beginning realm of the dao of cultivation was the Body-Refinement Realm. It meant to use cultivation-type martial arts, tonic food, and medicinal baths to strengthen one\u2019s physique.The body was a human\u2019s origin. As long as one\u2019s body was strong enough, they wouldn\u2019t need to fear illnesses and could survive even with a myriad of wounds. Only by living would they be able to climb to an even higher realm.Simply put, if the death of a person was equivalent to their light snuffing out. The body-refinement realm was something that allowed this lamp of light to burn brighter and for an even longer period. It wouldn\u2019t be extinguished just from a gust of wind.The body-refinement realm had a total of seven levels. The most notable sign was one\u2019s improvement in terms of cultivation realm and strength.Qi Shengjia\u2019s realm truly did match the \u2018extremely low\u2019 evaluation of his potential value.Usually, when one was still a child, they wouldn\u2019t practice refining their bodies because they weren\u2019t fully grown. This was to prevent leaving behind any residual injuries. Hence, they would at most do some simple tempering of their bodies. The majority of their time was spent in learning rune words, the four books, the five classics, and the six arts.In the nine provinces of Middle-Earth, 12-years-old cultivators were considered coming of age. At that time, one could gradually start to cultivate and refine their bodies.\u201cAt 15, normally, one would have reached the 4th or 5th level.\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t feel surprised. The Central Province Academy\u2019s students had their uniforms, but Qi Shengjia couldn\u2019t bear to wear it for training during the night. If he damaged it, he would have to spend money to purchase a new set.This set of cotton-padded clothes had long since lost its original color, and there were also patches on it. For people from poor families, there was no need to mention anything about eating tonic food or taking medicinal baths. Hence, poor people could only depend on their talent and hardwork.Qi Shengjia\u2019s actions were somewhat awkward. Being observed by Sun Mo caused him to feel a little uneasy. Hence, he might as well choose to take a break. He walked to his clothes, which were on the floor, and picked up a bottle of water to drink a few mouthfuls.\u201cStop training!\u201dSun Mo spoke.\u201cMn?\u201dQi Shengjia turned his head and stared at Sun Mo with puzzlement. Evidently, this person was talking to him.As a teacher, Sun Mo still admired hardworking students like him.Gurgle~Qi Shengjia drank his water. Rubbing the muscles on his arms and thighs, he walked to the empty space ahead and began to practice the Skywolf Fist.The test of the battle hall a week later was his final chance. If he couldn\u2019t pass, he would have to return home and be a farmer. If he didn\u2019t train hard now, he wouldn\u2019t have a chance to train hard in the future.When he thought of this, Qi Shengjia punched out with even more effort.\u201cIt\u2019s incorrect for you to train like this!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t wish to be a busybody. However, the data showed that the fatigue level of this youth was already very high. Also, many parts of his muscles had suffered slight injuries.\u201cYou are\u2026?\u201dQi Shengjia stopped his movements.\u201c\u2026\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t know what to say. He also had self-respect. Without first gaining the school\u2019s recognition, he wouldn\u2019t claim to be an intern teacher.\u201cAre you an intern teacher?\u201dQi Shengjia probed. Sun Mo was wearing a blue-colored long robe, and this was something only intern teachers would wear. When he thought of this, he felt a little agitated. As long as an intern teacher could guide him a little, his strength would be able to increase.\u201cMy name is Sun Mo.\u201d\u201cAh, you are Headmaster An\u2019s fiance?\u201dWhen he heard this name, Qi Shengjia subconsciously called out. After that, he widened his eyes and surveyed Sun Mo. Indeed, Sun Mo was born with handsome and exquisite features. His countenance was like jade. The capital he possessed for him to eat \u2018soft-rice\u2019 was truly robust and strong.Comparing himself to Sun Mo, he was like a clod of dirt on the road.\u201cI said, it\u2019s incorrect for you to practice this way. You should hurry back to rest.\u201dSun Mo hated wasting time the most. The fact of him repeating his words for three to four times caused his tone to become strict.\u201cOh!\u201dQi Shengjia mumbled, but he didn\u2019t listen to Sun Mo.Sun Mo furrowed his brows. After that, he gave a self-mocking laugh and turned to leave. The other party didn\u2019t believe in his suggestion. He also didn\u2019t intend to provide any guidance and merely spoke out because his heart was stirred by how hard-working Qi Shengjia was.Qi Shengjia was indeed doubting Sun Mo, as he was a very hot topic in the school. From Qi Shengjia\u2019s point of view, this intern teacher, who couldn\u2019t even become a teaching assistant and had to do odd jobs in the logistics departments, would not have a good teaching standard.This matter was an important one that concerned his life. How would Qi Shengjia listen to some random, unreliable guidance?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cPay attention to your right arm and left leg. Don\u2019t overuse your strength at those parts!\u201dOutside the forest, a reminder drifted over. One couldn\u2019t help but say that Sun Mo\u2019s voice was still quite melodious to the ear.Qi Shengjia involuntarily laughed. His method of practicing bitterly had caused all parts of his body to ache in pain. But other than enduring this, what could he do?\u201cIn any case, working hard will never be wrong!\u201dFrom Qi Shengjia\u2019s simplistic view, he felt that the more effort he put in, the stronger he would become.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6: RewardLordbluefireLordbluefireSun Mo spent another day in the library. The book collections were simply too rich, and they allowed his understanding of the nine provinces of Middle-Earth to become even more detailed.When it was almost midnight, Sun Mo closed the book he was reading and rested for a while, waiting for the notification from the system.\u201cDing! Midnight has passed. The chance to draw one lucky treasure chest is refreshed!\u201dThe Absolute Great Teacher System caused him to feel joy punctually every midnight. Without much expectation, Sun Mo told the system to open the chest.Unfortunately, there were still no cool effects. The red-colored treasure chest with the word \u2018fortune\u2019 opened up, showing Sun Mo that he got another clump of soil.\u201cAre you asking me to eat soil?\u201dSun Mo muttered. The system naturally didn\u2019t bother to reply.In any case, Sun Mo, who didn\u2019t harbor any high hopes, went back to his reading. Time flowed by, and it was only until morning did his stomach tap out, feeling hungry.\u201cLet\u2019s go and have a taste of breakfast in Jinling City!\u201dSun Mo stood up, placing [A Basic Outline of Pill Alchemy] back onto the shelf and preparing to leave. But before he walked out of the entrance, he saw Li Gong\u2019s limping figure waiting for him there.The school had clear rules that the library was a place students could learn and read. Therefore, maintaining absolute silence was a must. If someone shouted, created a disturbance, or did something that had no relationship with learning here, they would be forcefully evicted and punished. For a year, they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to enter the library again.Li Gong naturally didn\u2019t dare to berate Sun Mo in the library. Hence, he could only wait at the entrance.Sun Mo halted his steps and stared at Li Gong.Numerous rows of data appeared before his eyes.Sun Mo glanced at these basic data, only looking at those he could use. Very soon, a smile appeared on his lips.\u201cDivine Sight is too awesome.\u201dSun Mo sighed silently in admiration.\u201cStop hiding here, scram out!\u201dSeeing that Sun Mo had noticed him and stopped there, Li Gong panicked. He immediately cursed silently. Would this brat be like a cowardly turtle and hide here? He shouldn\u2019t have waited at the entrance but hid at some other spots to find a chance and catch Sun Mo.The department head of the logistics department didn\u2019t have a good temper. If someone didn\u2019t do the thing he had instructed to do, they would definitely be out of luck.Just when Li Gong was contemplating how he should get Sun Mo to leave the library, Sun Mo strode toward him and walked out. He didn\u2019t hesitate at all.After being in a daze for a while, Li Gong\u2019s expression turned ashen. Was Sun Mo looking down on him? Did Sun Mo feel that because he was an intern teacher, a staff of the logistics department couldn\u2019t offend him?\u201cHmph. I will \u2018fix\u2019 you soon until you become autistic and scram out of this school yourself.\u201dLi Gong laughed malevolently and lunged over, preparing to let Sun Mo know how many teeth this old dog had left.\u201cYour leg was crippled 12 years ago.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips curled into a smile. The first rays of the morning sun cascaded down on his sharply contoured face, adding to his handsomeness.\u201cEh?\u201dLi Gong had an expression as though he just saw a ghost. He wanted to curse, but all his words were stuck in his throat. Why? Because Sun Mo was right. His leg had been indeed crippled 12 years ago.\u201cYour leg was crippled by the Cloudpush Palm!\u201dSun Mo was enjoying the shocked look on Li Gong\u2019s face.\u201cEh?\u201dLi Gong gasped in shock.\u201cThe Cloudpush Palm is truly impressive. It took only three palm strikes to make your leg lame for over ten years. It hasn\u2019t recovered until now!\u201dSun Mo mocked.\u201cYou investigated me?\u201dLi Gong ruthlessly stared at Sun Mo. His expression was as sinister as an infuriated wild dog. Having a crippled leg was the greatest shame of his life.\u201cInvestigate you? Are you qualified?\u201dSun Mo chortled.Li Gong raged, but he regained his senses in the blink of an eye. He was just a small character, so who would care about him? Although one could purchase this information if one went to the black market, how much would someone have to spend? From what Li Gong understood, Sun Mo was extremely poor.Alright then, even if Sun Mo had the money, he had only been in the logistics department for a few days and met him less than five times. In such a short time, even if it was the greatest information broker, they wouldn\u2019t be able to gather such accurate information.\u201cHow did he know that my leg was crippled by three palm strikes from the Cloudpush Palm?!\u201dLi Gong\u2019s mind was filled with question marks. One must know that he had never mentioned it to anyone before.\u201cScram!\u201dSun Mo berated.Li Gong\u2019s heart wavered. He subconsciously opened up a path, but after that, he felt something was amiss and hurriedly took a big stride forward, blocking Sun Mo. Just when he was about to open his mouth to curse\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s still hope for recovery for your lame leg!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s voice was relaxed. His tone was bright, and it was very melodious. However, to Li Gong, it was like the sound of a thunderclap, jolting him so much that he froze on spot.The word \u2018recovery\u2019 was like a magical spell that kept echoing in his ears. It caused him to feel agitated. It made him timid, it made him hesitate!\u201cScram!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s right hand pushed out, slamming into his waist.Li Gong subconsciously retreated two steps. His expression was complex as he looked at Sun Mo\u2019s departing back. He no longer dared to obstruct Sun Mo.To a man whose leg had been lamed for over 12 years, there was nothing more attractive to him than being able to walk normally again.For this, Li Gong would spare no expense.\u201cIs he playing me? Wrong, since he could tell that I was injured by the Cloudpush Palm and could even accurately say out the number of palm strikes, he should have a solution, right?\u201dLi Gong was conflicted. \u201cBut he is only an intern teacher. Would he have such good judgment?\u201dDing!Favorable impression from Li Gong +1.The prestige connection with Li Gong is unlocked. Current status, neutral (1/100)!The notification caused Sun Mo to be bewildered. \u201cHe had a favorable impression of me just like that?\u201d\u201cWhen the host provides a guiding act toward a target, the target will generate feelings of good-will, intimacy, awe, and worship. After all these factors are combined, a favorable impression would be formed.\u201dThe system became a caring elder sister again.\u201cI understand!\u201dSun Mo accurately said the reason behind Li Gong\u2019s lame leg, causing him to feel impressed. Also, he wanted to seek guidance from Sun Mo to ask how he should cure his leg. This was why a favorable impression was generated.Naturally, Li Gong still had a suspicious attitude toward Sun Mo. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have generated the lowest number of favorable impression points at 1 point.Sun Mo glanced at the system\u2019s shopping store. He didn\u2019t expect that other than the Starmoon Fruit, an emblem that was emitting a dense golden-colored light could be found here.\u201cTen-years time emblem. After using it, it will give you ten years of experience in a certain skill or technique. Your proficiency level of that skill or technique would be increased by one level.\u201d\u201cPrice: 1,000 favorable impression points.\u201dTime emblems were good stuff. Sadly, it was so expensive that Sun Mo could only gaze at it from afar. Now, he only had a total of 5 favorable impression points.\u201cIt seems like I have to think of a method to become a teaching assistant quickly.\u201dSun Mo was planning for the future. Only after becoming a teaching assistant would his chances to interact with students increased. He could then give lectures to guide them and harvest favorable impression points.In the nine provinces of Middle-Earth, there were a hundred schools of thought and every kind of study material. Among them, martial arts were the basics. All cultivators were chasing after the extreme pinnacle of the martial dao, so naturally, great teachers who taught and provided guidance about cultivation would have the most respectable statuses.With the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art, how would Sun Mo still look up to the Overflow Rain Sword that he used to practice? He directly abandoned that and started his cultivation on the peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art.Because he had never come in contact with cultivation before, Sun Mo was exceptionally excited. His feelings were like he had just bought a limited-edition game and couldn\u2019t wait to clear the game on the day itself.Male building, dorm #557.Qi Shengjia who was sleeping under a blanket opened his eyes. When he saw the strong rays of sunlight already streaming in, he felt a little vexed. He wasted some time again.He pulled the blanket off and wanted to get up from the bed. However, half of his body had no reactions at all; he was dumbstruck for a moment. After that, he felt waves of great terror drowning him in like the ocean waves.\u201cShengjia, it\u2019s rare to see you sleeping so late!\u201dAs he yawned, Wang Hao from the upper bunk jumped down. When he saw Qi Shengjia still lying in bed, he couldn\u2019t help being greatly startled. Qi Shengjia was famous for being hard-working. Ever since he joined the school three years ago, Qi Shengjia would wake up before dawn and start his practice.Drip! Drip!Qi Shengjia bit his lips, and his tears involuntarily flowed, wetting his pillow.\u201cAi, how could it be so easy to enter the battle hall? You don\u2019t have to feel bad about it,\u201d consoled Wang Hao.There were quite a lot of clubs in the school with experienced teachers as consultants. This was to make it convenient for students to exchange information, interact, and ask questions after their lessons for the day ended.The battle hall was the most popular club, mainly established for combat. Students could spar against each other in the battle hall and compare their skills.Naturally, it was very popular, making students rush to join it like a duck rushing to water. It was because a 1-star great teacher was acting as the consultant there. The teacher would provide free public guidance every week.On Middle-Earth, the status of a great teacher was very respected, and they were also very busy. They held an office or post in the various large schools. Other than guiding their personal disciples, they would also hold a fixed number of public lessons every period.If the great teacher had a position in the school, he or she would be able to give more lessons. But if it was those who held positions in a few schools, they would basically leave straight after their lessons. Students wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to ask questions.There was no solution to it. A great teacher was simply too busy, and there were too many students wanting to ask questions. They definitely didn\u2019t have the time to care for each and every student so deeply.If one wanted to get the guidance of a great teacher, there were two ways. One was to have outstanding individual talent and gained recognition from the great teacher. The great teacher then would accept the individual as a personal disciple and put his heart into guiding them. The second way was to go and attend public lectures.The effect of the latter was definitely inferior to the former. But in this world, talented people were ultimately a minority.For people like Qi Shengjia, he only managed to enter the Central Province Academy due to the decline happening after the calamity 300 years ago. If not, given his aptitude, he wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to step past the school gate.For any famous school, they regarded the aptitude and quality of their students very highly.To Qi Shengjia, entering the battle hall was the only way to raise his strength.Wu~Qi Shengjia finally couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. He bit on his blanket and cried out. Right now, his body couldn\u2019t move, and he would soon lose his only chance. How could he not despair?\u201cSomething is wrong.\u201dZhou Xu, who was lying on the lower bunk on the opposite side, instantly sat up as he looked at Qi Shengjia. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t move any more!\u201d Qi Shengjia\u2019s voice was mournful.\u201cAh? I will go and call the doctor!\u201d Wang Hao was badly frightened.\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201dUpon hearing this, Qi Shengjia\u2019s reaction was even greater than Wang Hao.\u201cWhat situation is it now? You still want to save money!?\u201dZhou Xu was speechless. He knew that Qi Shengjia wasn\u2019t from a wealthy background.\u201cNo\u2026No. Wait. Maybe my body has gone numb due to sleep paralysis. I will be fine just by resting for a while longer.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euQi Shengjia\u2019s face was pale, and his lips trembled. Right now, he could only pray.Wang Hao and Zhou Xu exchanged a mutual glance. There were no solutions for it. They then glanced at Yan Li who was seated on another bed. Yan Li shrugged and put on an \u2018unable to help despite how much he wanted to\u2019 expression before continuing to lower his head and read his novel.From his point of view, this poor bumpkin from the countryside should have scrammed long ago. Qi Shengjia would always disturb his beauty sleep by heading out early in the morning to practice. Now that he was paralyzed, it was truly too wonderful.\u201cHe must have damaged his body because of overtraining!\u201dYan Li silently gloated in glee.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her raven-black long hair was tied up behind her head using a simple hairpin. Although she didn\u2019t have any cosmetics on, she was still elegant and incomparably beautiful.In the room, the low sound of breathing could be heard. The summer wind gusted by and the sound of paper pages flipping filled the room. There was also a faint fragrance in the atmosphere and a knowledgeable aura silently permeated the air.Zhou Lin pushed open the door and lightened her steps as she walked in.\u201cThe gatekeeper of the Qian Family said that Elder Qian was out visiting friends and didn\u2019t receive your invitation. Evidently, he didn\u2019t wish to meet Eldest Miss!\u201dZhou Lin bit her lips, her tone was indignant. She was An Xinhui\u2019s assistant and was responsible for handling the miscellaneous official business.In private, Zhou Lin would always refer to An Xinhui as \u2018Eldest Miss\u2019.\u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense. Maybe Elder Qian is really not at home.\u201dAn Xinhui\u2019s tone was calm, there were no fluctuations in her voice at all.\u201cI think he basically doesn\u2019t wish to come to the student recruitment meet.\u201dZhou Lin coldly spoke, \u201cI heard that he has already agreed to the invitation of the headmaster from Myriad Daos Academy and is preparing to be a great teacher under them.\u201dThere were over ten academies in Jinling City. The most famous one was undoubtedly the Central Province Academy, but due to its unceasing decline, it was now already surpassed by the Myriad Daos Academy.An Xinhui fell silent. She knew that the rallying power of Central Province Academy had almost fallen to the freezing point. She was trying her best to turn the situation around, but things naturally wouldn\u2019t be so easy.\u201cEldest Miss, we have to think of a solution fast. Seven great teachers under us have been headhunted away by our rivals.\u201dZhou Lin felt anxious in her heart. The foundation of a famous school was naturally the number of great teachers it had. If they didn\u2019t even have a single great teacher, what qualifications did they have to have the title of a \u2018famous school\u2019?\u201cMn!\u201dAn Xinhui stopped her impulse to sigh. In front of outsiders, she wasn\u2019t willing to display her weaknesses and dejected feelings. \u201cOh yes, how has he been doing?\u201d\u201cVery good!\u201dZhou Lin knew that Headmaster An was talking about her fiance. The moment this fellow was mentioned, Zhou Lin would feel angry. An Xinhui was a top graduate from the Heavenly Mystery Academy, a great beauty ranked 7th on the Devastating Beauty Rankings. She had good looks and high intelligence, so what qualifications did that Sun Mo have to marry her?\u201cHe should be blaming me, right?\u201dAn Xinhui furrowed her brows.\u201cDid he dare to?\u201dZhou Lin\u2019s vocal timbre was lifted by ten octaves. \u201cEver since you took over this terrible mess, you have been so busy and hard-pressed from the pressure that you have no time to handle any other matters. Moreover, you cannot make decisions about matters of the school alone.\u201d\u201cBut I should have persisted back then. Sun Mo was tossed into the logistics department and couldn\u2019t even become a teaching assistant. To a teaching graduate, the impact of such a blow is too heavy.\u201dAn Xinhui felt some regret. Back then, she should have endured the pressure those fellows gave her. She understood that those fellows were targeting Sun Mo because they wanted to display a show of strength toward her.\u201cIf he cannot even settle this bit of difficulty, he might as well commit suicide earlier.\u201dZhou Lin mocked, \u201cDon\u2019t hope that he would be able to help you at all. That Sun Mo..? It\u2019s impossible for him.\u201d\u2026During the afternoon, Qi Shengjia could finally move. However, his right arm and left leg were still numb and had stiffened up. He could feel hard blocks of flesh when he touched them; the tactile sensation felt like rocks.\u201cYou should look for a doctor,\u201d said Wang HaoHe bought lunch back and placed it on the table. \u201cEat a little less.\u201d\u201cYou definitely won\u2019t be able to join the battle hall. The thing you have to do now is to do your utmost to not become crippled,\u201d interjected Yan Li who was eating his porridge.Usually, he wouldn\u2019t stay in the dorm at this time. However, today was different. When he saw the look of despair on the loathsome Qi Shengjia\u2019s face, he was so happy that he wanted to hum a little tune.\u201cIf you speak less, no one will think that you are a mute.\u201d Zhou Xu said.\u201cWhat has this got to do with you? Can\u2019t I be concerned for Qi Shengjia?\u201d Yan Li shouted back with an aggressive expression.Qi Shengjia sat on his bed and stared at the floor in a daze. He hadn\u2019t spoken for half-a-day. If he was really crippled, he might as well commit suicide to save some trouble for his family.\u201cYou definitely damaged your body because of excessive training. Do you want to look for a great teacher and seek their guidance?\u201d asked Zhou Xu. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue with Yan Li.\u201cDo you think a great teacher is a stone by the side of the road that you can find any time?\u201dYan Li rolled his eyes. Zhou Xi was truly indulging in fantasy.Qi Shengjia, who was in a daze, suddenly woke up when he heard this. His eyes brightened as though he had managed to grab hold of his last hope. He struggled and got off the bed, suddenly recalling Sun Mo whom he had met last night. Sun Mo had told him that his way of training was incorrect and had even specially reminded him to pay attention to his right arm and left leg.\u201cCould he have seen the problems in my body?\u201dWhen he thought of this, Qi Shengjia felt a little regret. He had ignored the other party yesterday.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dWang Hao went over to help Qi Shengjia up, seeing that he wanted to move.\u201cI want to\u2026go out to relax a little.\u201dQi Shengjia wanted to explain, but seeing that Yan Li was present, he swallowed the words he wanted to say back into his mouth.\u2026It was very easy to find the residence of the intern teachers. Qi Shengjia soon managed to inquire about Sun Mo\u2019s address. It was just that when he walked to his unit\u2019s door, he hesitated again.\u201cYesterday, my attitude wasn\u2019t good. What if he doesn\u2019t want to guide me?\u201dLudi just returned and had a pottery pot with him. When he saw Qi Shengjia standing at the door, he lowered his voice and asked, \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201dAfter asking, Ludi silently felt a little annoyed. His voice was too loud, exhibiting the prestige of a teacher, yet he had ignored the personal warmth and friendliness. He had to continue tempering his voice more.Qi Shengjia\u2019s neck shrank back. He avoided Ludi\u2019s gaze and took a few steps backLudi shrugged. He didn\u2019t express an opinion and entered the door.During dusk, the birds returned to their best.Yuan Feng carried a pile of books and returned. The moment he entered, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that student outside?\u201d\u201cNo idea, he already came a few times this afternoon.\u201dThere was a plate of pig trotters placed in front of Ludi. He was carefully pulling out the fur. This was something he wanted to give to a teacher, so he naturally needed to make it perfect.\u201cDid the student come because he wanted some guidance?\u201dYuan Feng was curious. As he was speaking, Zhang Sheng also returned.Night descended. Qi Shengjia still didn\u2019t have the intention to leave.\u201cDo you guys think that he is here for guidance but doesn\u2019t dare to ask?\u201dLudi subconsciously tidied up his clothes.\u201cIf he wants to look for someone, it most probably is Zhang Sheng I guess!\u201dYuan Feng bootlicked. From his perspective, there was an 80% to 90% chance that Zhang Sheng would join the faculty after the internship. There was no mistake to forge a good relationship with him now.Zhang Sheng didn\u2019t say anything, but his arrogant expression clearly said that he was also paying attention to that student.\u201cShould we go and ask him?\u201dLudi suggested. He had some hopes that maybe the student was looking for him?\u201cIf we have to go and ask, Zhang Sheng should be the one!\u201dYuan Feng urged. \u201cA student staying here until night just to seek guidance. If this matter circulates out, it would be good for our reputation!\u201dZhang Sheng had long since decided. Since that student didn\u2019t want to knock on the door, he wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to ask. After all, even an intern teacher had to have some prestige, he mustn\u2019t lower himself. But when he heard Ludi\u2019s words, he found it logical too.\u201cQuickly go and see what that fellow wants guidance on?\u201dLudi urged.\u201cMn!\u201dZhang Sheng stood up. He smoothed the creases in his clothes before walking out.\u201cYou have been standing outside the door for so long, do you have something you need?\u201dZhang Sheng asked.\u201cI\u2026\u201dQi Shengjia swallowed a mouthful of saliva. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Sun Mo\u2026Teacher Sun.\u201dWhen he heard the two words \u2018Sun Mo\u2019, Zhang Sheng\u2019s face instantly turned black, and he almost wanted to turn and leave. However, he bore the impulse. A student came to seek guidance from Sun Mo, why did he have to come out? If this matter was to spread, he would truly lose face. Hence, he had to ask clearly.\u201cWhy are you looking for him?\u201dAfter Zhang Sheng asked, a self-mocking smile appeared on his face. He felt that he was thinking too much. For trash like Sun Mo, even if the student was retarded, he would never be looking for Sun Mo for guidance!\u201cTo\u2026to ask for guidance!\u201dQi Shengjia\u2019s voice became even lower.\u201cWhat?\u201dZhang Sheng\u2019s voice broke. Even Ludi and Yuan Feng, who were eavesdropping from the house, also had dumbfounded looks on their faces.Qi Shengjia lowered his head. His foot shifted as he wanted to leave.\u201cStop right there!\u201dZhang Sheng\u2019s voice was filled with anger. \u201cSun Mo isn\u2019t around. What do you want guidance on? I can answer for him!\u201dZhang Sheng truly didn\u2019t want to bother with this ignorant student, but there was no way he could let this student walk away like that. If not, wouldn\u2019t that be saying that he was inferior to Sun Mo? Hence, what he needed to do now was settle the problem of this student and prove that his teaching ability was excellent.\u201cMy\u2026my hand and leg are disabled. I want to seek guidance on the reason behind this.\u201dQi Shengjia decided to muster up his courage and asked.Zhang Sheng was astonished. After that, his complexion turned ashen as he roared, \u201cDamn! You are not only crippled in your hands and legs. Your brain is crippled too. Are you crazy? If you are injured, why don\u2019t you look for a doctor?\u201dAfter cursing, Zhang Sheng turned and left. From his point of view, this must be a sinister plot between competitors. They wanted to destroy his reputation and lower his chance of joining the faculty after the internship.\u201cSun Mo must be the one behind this!\u201dYuan Feng pointed the finger of blame at Sun Mo. \u201cHe must be jealous of your talent and wants to drag you under the water.\u201dLudi pretended to be a cowardly turtle and remained silent as he continued plucking the fur from the pig trotters.Bang!Zhang Sheng smashed his teacup angrily, annoyed because he had never thought of using this method. (I will find a few students to look for me in batches to increase my reputation.)Wasn\u2019t it just gaining reputation? Who didn\u2019t know how to do this?\u201cThat fellow Sun Mo doesn\u2019t have any abilities, but has quite a lot of crafty ideas.\u201dYuan Feng patted his pocket and calculated how much money he had. He could hire a few students for this purpose too, but he was also worried the school might find out and directly fire him!When the three woke up in the morning and went out, they saw Qi Shengjia waiting at a location not far away from their door.\u201cThis time around, Sun Mo must have paid dearly. I wonder how much he spent!\u201dYuan Feng mocked.\u201cHmph!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Sheng didn\u2019t look at Qi Shengjia. Such an inferior student wouldn\u2019t be able to excel in his entire life. He would feel disdain if he was to speak half-a-word more to this student.\u2026In the canteen. As Sun Mo ate a vegetarian bun, he was looking at the floating golden-colored book before him in a daze.Yesterday, the lucky treasure chest had been refreshed. Sun Mo had thought that he would get another clump of soil, but then this book appeared.According to logic, he should feel happy after getting a prize. But when he saw the name of this skill book, Sun Mo felt perplexed and even a little unhappy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Upon hearing this name, everyone would feel an ambiguous feeling.\u201cIn the past, was your name the Massage Master System, but you took an arrow to the knee and changed into the Absolute Great Teacher System?\u201dSun Mo mocked.The system remained silent.\u201cAre you planning on nurturing me into a young girl who massages customers\u2019 feet in a hair salon?\u201dSun Mo had a suspicious attitude.\u201cYou are a male.\u201dThe system replied, \u201cAlso, I discovered that you have quite the poisonous tongue.\u201d\u201cClearly, the skill book you gave has a problem. You don\u2019t allow me to talk about it?\u201dSun Mo furrowed his brows. \u201cAs a teacher, how can I curse at people? Let me tell you, if I begin cursing, I will be like a wild unleashed dog. I\u2019m even afraid of myself.\u201d\u201cThe ancient massage technique is a very effective massage technique from ancient times. With your hands, you can sense and understand every part of your target\u2019s body, achieving perfect control and allowing you to plan the logical cultivation path of the target.\u201dThe system explained.\u201cUnderstood.\u201dSun Mo had a colleague whose husband was a province-level athlete. Hence, he knew that body massage was a part of their training. Maintaining the conditions of their bodies and recovery was of utmost importance. The better the maintenance, the longer they would be able to compete in their career.\u201cHowever, isn\u2019t the name ancient massage technique a little too out of style? Can you change into something more impressive-sounding? For example, Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands?Sun Mo\u2019s complaint was ignored by the system.\u201cAre you going to learn it or not?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m learning it!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s reply was clean and clear-cut.Pak!The skill book shattered, transforming into a ball of golden light that shot into Sun Mo\u2019s center of the brow. Some strange knowledge appeared in his mind.\u201cCongratulations, you obtained the expert-grade circulation technique. This technique is one of the four parts of the \u2018ancient massage technique\u2019. It mainly targets the energy channels. Once the energy channels in one\u2019s body are cleared, the spirit qi would be able to flow through unobstructed.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips trembled and almost cursed the system\u2019s mother. After half-a-day, this was just a partial skill? How petty.After breakfast, Sun Mo found a quiet storehouse. After locking the door, he began to cultivate the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art. Because of the presence of spirit qi, he discovered that his body was extremely strong. With just a casual leap, he could jump five to six meters.\u201cIf I went to run a marathon and failed to give a psychological impact to the second-ranker, I would truly have let this body down.\u201dSun Mo fantasized. Everyone would thirst for a healthy body. In the past, he had been near-sighted and had had problems with his stomach and cervical vertebra. Now, they were completely fixed.\u201cEverything is good about cultivation other than the fact that it is too tiring.\u201dAlthough he was grumbling, Sun Mo was close to stepping in the doorway of the first level of the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art.The first level would allow him to unleash his potential and control his body, allowing it to erupt with strength at any moment, achieving perfect control of his strength.The essence of the first level was one\u2019s control over their body. It was to dig out more of his potential.This cultivation session lasted for a day. During this time, Sun Mo saw Li Gong who was looking all over for him. But since he was hidden, Li Gong didn\u2019t find him.It wasn\u2019t that he was afraid of Li Gong. He just didn\u2019t have the mood to handle him temporarily. It felt like he just got a brand-new game and was fascinated by it. Let alone going to school, he didn\u2019t even have time to meet his girlfriend.Sun Mo didn\u2019t like crowds. He waited until the peak-time was over before he headed to the canteen.He ordered a bowl of noodles that was extremely chewy. The broth was clear and satisfying, and he also ordered a few pieces of beef that were boiled for the whole night. It was so delicious to the extent where he could even swallow his tongue.Intern teachers had subsidies, so Sun Mo only had to spend 5 coins. If he was officially employed, the subsidies would be even higher.After leaving the canteen, Sun Mo headed to the Sorrowless Lake, wanting to take a walk after dinner.Qi Shengjia followed 20 meters behind him, his heart was filled with hesitation. Earlier, he couldn\u2019t find Sun Mo. Then Wang Hao had an idea and told him to wait at the canteen\u2019s entrance. After all, everyone needed to eat.\u201cSun\u2026Teacher Sun!\u201dQi Shengjia hastened his speed and chased after Sun Mo, which caused him to pull a few more muscles. It was so painful that his head was covered in sweat.\u201cYour leg is crippled?\u201dSun Mo stopped and furrowed his brows.\u201cMy right hand too.\u201dQi Shengjia revealed a tragic smile. He stared at Sun Mo\u2019s calm face and gritted his teeth before falling on his knees. The force was so great that during the contact between his knees and the pavement, a loud thud could be heard.\u201cTeacher Sun, please advise me!\u201dQi Shengjia spoke and prostrated himself. This was his last hope.\u201cGet up!\u201dSun Mo berated, \u201cThere\u2019s gold underneath the knee caps of a man. You should only kneel to the heavens, the earth, and your parents!\u201dSun Mo hated those who didn\u2019t love themselves the most. Hence after saying this, his emotions flooded forth, activating his great teacher halo.Swish!From Sun Mo, a golden light sprang forth like the fine rain, landing on Qi Shengjia\u2019s body.Under the supportive effect of his \u2018priceless advice\u2019 halo, the sentence about having gold underneath a man\u2019s knee cap was like the chime of a giant bell, shaking Qi Shengjia\u2019s heart and mind. He subconsciously stood up.\u201cI was wrong!\u201dQi Shengjia apologized. He lowered his head as all hesitation from before completely faded away. The emotions replacing it were deep respect as well as regrets.He shouldn\u2019t have looked down on Teacher Sun. The effect of \u2018priceless advice\u2019 was truly powerful. He soon felt hope rising again in his heart.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +3.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia unlocked. Current state: Neutral (3/100)!\u201cI can gain favorable impression points like this?\u201dSun Mo activated Divine Sight and observed Qi Shengjia. The muscles of Qi Shengjia\u2019s right arm and left leg were injured seriously. This was especially so for his energy channels. They were a mess.\u201cTeacher, please guide me!\u201dQi Shengjia once again implored with sincerity.\u201cYou want me to cure your limbs? I apologize, I won\u2019t be able to do it.\u201dSun Mo rejected.\u201cTeacher Sun, you are my last hope.\u201dQi Shengjia forcefully held back his tears and didn\u2019t allow them to flow.\u201cYou fell into this state because of excessive training. Over-training caused your muscles and energy channels to be damaged. As long as you stop training, you will slowly recover.\u201dSun Mo was very confident because this was the result Divine Sight told him. It was extremely accurate.\u201cHow long\u2026how long must I stop training for?\u201dQi Shengjia had a look of hope on his face.\u201cOne year at least.\u201dWhen he heard this answer, Qi Shengjia\u2019s complexion turned pale. \u201cNo, the time is too long. I have to gain the qualifications to join the battle hall in this test. If not, I can only quit school.\u201dThe word \u2018quit school\u2019 caused Sun Mo to frown. He was frowning so hard that the tightness of his brows could crush a crab to death. As a teacher, these were the two words he didn\u2019t want to hear the most.\u201cTeacher Sun, you definitely have a solution. Can you please guide me on what to do?\u201dQi Shengjia\u2019s knees bent. He wanted to kneel again, but he forcefully bore with the impulse.Sun Mo fell silent.Qi Shengjia didn\u2019t dare to speak and just stood quietly at the side, waiting for Sun Mo\u2019s judgment.\u201cThe circulation technique should be able to cure his damaged energy channels, but I have no solutions for his muscles. But then, his main problem now is still his energy channels. At the very least, I can allow his arm and leg to not be so stiff.\u201dStaring at the data from Qi Shengjia, Sun Mo contemplated and told him the truth.\u201cI can cure your arm and leg, but I don\u2019t have 100% confidence. An unexpected accident might exacerbate your condition or even cause you to become a true cripple. Do you still want to go ahead with the treatment?\u201dThis was the first time Sun Mo would be using the circulation technique, who knew how the situation would turn out?Qi Shengjia was in a daze.Sun Mo wasn\u2019t in a hurry and silently waited. After five minutes, he turned and left.\u201cTeacher Sun!\u201dQi Shengjia bowed. \u201cI will leave everything to you.\u201dThe two of them went back to a storehouse. Sun Mo tidied the place a bit and took out a piece of a clean wooden plank. He then asked Qi Shengjia to remove his clothes and lie there.Expert-grade. As the name implied, it meant that he was proficient in this, and his level of expertise was above \u2018good\u2019. Although it wasn\u2019t at the \u2018grandmaster\u2019 level, it was at least at the elite standard.The expert-grade circulation technique that Sun Mo grasped allowed him to know how to handle Qi Shengjia\u2019s condition the moment he touched his right arm and rubbed it for a bit.Ah!An intense piercing pain could be felt from his arm, causing Qi Shengjia to scream in pain. He then hurriedly closed his mouth, afraid that he might disturb Teacher Sun\u2019s focus.Sun Mo focused his mind. He gathered spirit qi in his fingers and performed Tuina (chinese massage therapy) for Qi Shengjia.A feeling of being poked by needles could be felt from the places Sun Mo touched. About two minutes later, the pain transformed into itchiness, and after that, the itchiness transformed into currents of warmth that circulated around his arm.Qi Shengjia comfortably closed his eyes. He felt as though he was floating on clouds and returned to his mother\u2019s embrace.The first rays of the morning sun penetrated through the window and cascaded down on Qi Shengjia\u2019s face. When he woke up, it was already morning.\u201cHere, eat something!\u2019Sun Mo went to the canteen and bought some porridge, passing it to Qi Shengjia.\u201cI don\u2019t dare, I don\u2019t dare!\u2019Qi Shengjia hurriedly rose and waved his hand to reject. After that, he started. He discovered that the numbness of his right arm and left leg, as well as other parts of his body, had completely faded.\u201cTeacher Sun!\u201dQi Shengjia abruptly inclined his head. Tears flashed in his eyes as he looked at Sun Mo. This current state of the body was something he hadn\u2019t felt for a long time.\u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201dSun Mo passed a bowl to Qi Shengjia. Last night after this fellow had fallen asleep, Sun Mo decided to use Tuina to treat all the energy channels in Qi Shengjia\u2019s body.After using Divine Sight to observe, Sun Mo could confirm that the injuries to Qi Shengjia\u2019s energy channels had been greatly reduced. If he came for Tuina a few times more, he should be able to recover completely.Truthfully speaking, Sun Mo really wanted to shout the words, \u2018Absolute Great Teacher System is Awesome!\u2019. The ancient massage technique he got in a treasure chest was truly useful. If he had enough favorable impression points, he also wanted to buy the other parts of this technique.Qi Shengjia placed down his bowl and had a solemn look on his face as he knelt. He kowtowed heavily three times, causing three thudding sounds to ring out. Even the dust on the ground flew up from the impact.\u201cTeacher Sun, I have no words to express my gratitude toward you!\u201dAs Qi Shengjia kowtowed to convey his thanks, the system notification sound rang out in Sun Mo\u2019s ear.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +15.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia. Current state: Neutral (18/100)!Sun Mo nodded in satisfaction, not because of Qi Shengjia\u2019s respectful attitude, but rather because his favorable impression points were now in double digits.Adding on Li Ziqi\u2019s 4 points and Li Gong\u2019s 1 point, he now had a total of 23 favorable impression points. However, he still had a long way to go. The price for a Starmoon Fruit was 1,000 points.Since he could increase his realm after consuming the Starmoon Fruit, if he bought a bunch of them to eat, didn\u2019t that mean he would no longer need to cultivate?Qi Shengjia was still very agitated. He had looked for Sun Mo because he had been desperate. However, the effect was much better than he had imagined.\u201cSuch an awesome intern teacher is tossed into the logistics department. Is the school\u2019s management blind?\u201dQi Shengjia felt that it was an injustice for Sun Mo.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright, let\u2019s eat!\u201dJust when Sun Mo ate a mouthful of porridge, he froze. The voice of the system hadn\u2019t stopped.\u201cDing! New mission unlocked. Help Qi Shengjia pass the battle hall\u2019s test. Reward: A golden treasure chest!\u201dBang!After the system finished speaking, Sun Mo swept the bowl to the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9: Extremely ShockingLordbluefireLordbluefireQi Shengjia was badly frightened, and his expression tightened. He didn\u2019t dare to swallow the half-mouthful of porridge in his mouth.\u201cCan you be any shadier?\u201dSun Mo was extremely unhappy. Qi Shengjia\u2019s potential value was extremely low, and there were just five days before the test started.Sun Mo was a \u2018newcomer\u2019, and the Central Province Academy could be considered his home ground. Hence, after spending two days in the library, he had almost read through all the information relevant to the school.The battle hall was the most popular club in the Central Province Academy. It was also extremely famous in Jinling City.In order to maintain the battle hall\u2019s lofty status and make each member of the club cherish their identity, the limit of their members had always been set at 500.Every three months, the battle hall would organize an entrance test. Students who wished to join the hall could draw lots in the test and choose a person in the club as their opponent.If they won, they would be able to enter the battle hall. If they lost, they had to wait for next time.If a member lost, they would instantly lose their identity as a battle hall member. It was precisely this cruel competition rule that caused all members of the battle hall to do their utmost in cultivation.There was a great teacher in the battle hall acting as a consultant, and he would provide public guidance lectures for free every week. As long as one wasn\u2019t retarded, who would bear to miss it?Other than this, if one could join the battle hall, their reputation would surely grow. Their social circle would enlarge as well, and this would prove to be of immense help for their futures.Under the temptation of such good conditions, the competition in each test would be extremely intense. Even using his knees to think, Sun Mo could tell that Qi Shengjia didn\u2019t stand a chance at all.\u201cA great teacher is someone who can transform the impossible into the possible. Turning a student who\u2019s crow into a phoenix, from rotten wood to a pillar that can support the state. If not, why would the world need great teachers for?\u201dThe system sounded like this was inevitable and right.\u201cDo you have an original body? Come out for me, I guarantee I won\u2019t hit you to death.\u201dSun Mo cracked his fingers.\u201cTeacher Sun?\u2019Qi Shengjia summoned up his courage and asked.\u201cEat your porridge!\u201dSun Mo commanded.\u201cOh!\u201dQi Shengjia\u2019s neck shrank back, and gurgling sounds rang out as he ate the porridge. Although it was a little hot, he didn\u2019t spit it out.\u201cAfter finishing your meal, lie back on the wooden plank.\u201dIt seemed like there was no way for him to cancel the mission that had been issued. Sun Mo could only do his best.\u201cTeacher Sun is so good!\u201dQi Shengjia\u2019s eyes grew wet again. As a mediocre student, he had never received any extra care from any teachers before.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +2.Prestige connection state with Qi Shengjia. Neutral (20/100)!Upon hearing the notification, Sun Mo\u2019s mood became much better. At the very least, this fellow still had a conscience and knew how to feel grateful.Qi Shengjia didn\u2019t dare to let Sun Mo wait too long. He hurriedly finished his breakfast and lay back on the wooden plank.\u201cTeacher Sun, do you think this pose is okay?\u201dQi Shengjia\u2019s eyes were filled with trepidation.\u201cRelax your body, why are you so nervous for? I\u2019m not a butcher, alright?\u201d Sun Mo was speechless. \u201cWhy are you lying in such a straight and stiff manner? Are you a salted fish?\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dQi Shengjia grew even more nervous.Sun Mo didn\u2019t wish to be stared at, so he took Qi Shengjia\u2019s clothes to cover his head. After that, he grabbed hold of Qi Shengjia\u2019s left arm and started Tuina, clearing his energy channels.Time slowly flowed.\u201cHow\u2019s the feeling?\u201dAs Sun Mo massaged, he asked Qi Shengjia. He could gain a more detailed understanding of this partial ancient massage technique from Qi Shengjia\u2019s answers.\u201cIt\u2019s painful at the start, after that, the pain transforms into an itch!\u201dQi Shengjia moved slightly. \u201cIt feels like ants are crawling on my body.\u201d\u201cAnd after that?\u201dSun Mo patted Qi Shengjia\u2019s arm. \u201cFlip your body over and lie down on your stomach!\u201dOne couldn\u2019t help but say that this fellow did train his muscles well. Qi Shengjia\u2019s body was robust. Sun Mo could tell that Qi Shengjia was someone walking down the path of a man of steel.\u201cHot!\u201dQi Shengjia then flipped his body over. \u201cIt feels comfortable!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s hands gently massaged Qi Shengjia\u2019s cervical vertebra. After that, his hands moved down toward the backbone. When his hands reached the lumbar vertebra, Sun Mo suddenly used force and pressed down.\u201cArgh!\u201dQi Shengjia immediately shouted in pain. His backbone curved like a bow, and he looked akin to a cooked prawn now. Before the pain faded, the spirit qi in the surroundings suddenly surged in, flooding his body.\u201cMn?\u201dSun Mo was puzzled. As he also understood the dao of cultivation, he soon realized that this was the phenomenon that would occur before a cultivator broke through to the next level.Because this was the first time he was seeing it, Sun Mo observed very seriously. His hands didn\u2019t leave Qi Shengjia\u2019s body and were moving about, stopping on different parts as he sensed the flow of spirit qi through the energy channels.Pak! Pak! Pak!Qi Shengjia\u2019s body suddenly emitted patting sounds. His muscles seemed to be inflated. They swelled up and this condition lasted for about three minutes before they returned to their original form.In the storehouse, the surging spirit qi also gradually calmed down.Sun Mo retreated as he recalled the massage process that had happened earlier in his mind. This was his habit. Through reflecting the process step-by-step, he wanted to reinforce his memories and dig out all the good points and flaws that were worthy to be taken note of. This way, he could perform better in the future.\u201cI\u2026I\u2026broke through?\u201dQi Shengjia\u2019s body trembled. He was dumbstruck as he stared at his hands in a daze. This feeling of having an abundance of spirit qi in his body\u2026there was no mistake.He had experienced this wondrous state before. It was half-a-year ago when he had broken through to the 3rd-level of the body-refinement realm.He was in a daze for five whole minutes. Only then did he remember Sun Mo, and he hurriedly got up.Boom!Qi Shengjia overturned the wooden plank, scattering dust around. He took two steps and rushed in front of Sun Mo. With a thudding sound, he knelt down.Bang!Qi Shengjia kowtowed. The force he used was too great and shattered the floor panel. He wanted to say some words of thanks, but he was too agitated and only unintelligible words came out of his mouth. In the end, he didn\u2019t manage to say anything.\u201cWhy are you kneeling again?\u201dSun Mo frowned. \u201cAre you a kowtowing bug?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026I not\u2026\u201dQi Shengjia\u2019s head was filled with sweat. He was afraid that Sun Mo would loathe him. But because of this, he grew more and more anxious and couldn\u2019t speak smoothly.At this moment, Sun Mo\u2019s status in his heart had risen endlessly. Just after a round of massage, Sun Mo had allowed him to step into the 4th-level of the body refinement realm. This was too awesome.\u201cIf you are not, quickly get up!\u201dSun Mo instructed, \u201cTidy up the things on the ground.\u201d\u201cMn!\u201dQi Shengjia was so obedient that he was like a sheep being glared at by a wolf. Right now, he was incomparably excited and wanted to shout at the top of his lungs. By breaking through to the 4th level, his chance of passing the battle hall\u2019s test would be greater.When he thought of this, Qi Shengjia couldn\u2019t help but praise Sun Mo.\u201cTeacher Sun, you are so awesome!\u201dDing!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +30.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia. Neutral (50/100).Sun Mo clicked his tongue, +30 points directly? He wasn\u2019t despising it for being too little. Rather, he wanted to know how he could get so many favorable impression points every time.\u201cWhen your act of guidance generates a favorable impression like closeness, being impressed, feelings of worship, etc, you will be able to gain favorable impression points.\u201cThe greater the emotional fluctuation of the target, the more favorable impression points would be generated.\u201d\u201cUsing Qi Shengjia as an example. Right now, his breakthrough causes him to feel hope of passing the battle hall\u2019s test, and if he really passed, his life would immediately be much better. This is why he has generated plenty of favorable impression points.\u201dIf the system\u2019s voice could have a little more emotions in it, it would really be like a caring elder sister.\u201cSo, this is the case. The more they feel that my guidance is important, the better it would be for me. So I have to put in more effort in guiding others to gain more favorable impression points, right?\u201d\u201cCorrect!\u2019The system paused for a moment before adding another line, \u201cIn view of your intelligence, I discovered that it is very possible for the Absolute Great Teacher System to finally make a correct choice in choosing you.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t these words superfluous?\u201dSun Mo wanted to roll his eyes.\u201cI take back my words. Your mouth is simply too toxic.\u201dAfter the system said that, it fell back into silence.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201dSun Mo then glanced at Qi Shengjia. He didn\u2019t feel proud of himself. This was because Qi Shengjia had already cultivated to the peak of the 3rd-level before this, and he only lacked a bit of stimulus before he could step into the gateway of the 4th-level. It was just that his body got injured and he was overly fatigued, leading to his weaker state of being. This was why Qi Shengjia didn\u2019t manage to break through even after a long time.Sun Mo\u2019s ancient massage technique could clear his energy channels, allowing his spirit qi to flow in the smooth circulation. This could be considered a stimulus that triggered Qi Shengjia\u2019s breakthrough.\u201cI feel very excellent!\u201dQi Shengjia punched his fists together, wanting nothing more than to find someone for a spar right now.\u201cScram back and rest. Don\u2019t keep thinking about cultivating.\u201dSun Mo commanded.\u201cAh?\u201dQi Shengjia was astonished. He initially wanted to say no, but when he thought of how much Sun Mo had helped him, he immediately shut his mouth and nodded heavily. \u201cI\u2019m going back to sleep right now!\u201d\u201cDuring these few days, you can come back here after school.\u201dIn order to complete the mission and get the reward, Sun Mo could only give it his all.\u201cTeacher Sun, you are willing to guide me?\u201dQi Shengjia\u2019s gaze was glowing as he looked at Sun Mo. He was so agitated that he was panting.Sun Mo waved his hand, and Qi Shengjia tactfully departed. Before he left, he still closed the door to the storehouse gently. It was as though if his movements were too big, he would startle Teacher Sun.When he reached his dorm, although it was in the middle of the day, Qi Shengjia hurried to bed so he could sleep. Right now, he treated Sun Mo\u2019s words as a royal edict. He would execute Sun Mo\u2019s instructions carefully to the fullest.\u2026\u201cSigh, Shengjia is so pitiful. I\u2019m afraid he is going to quit school!\u201dWang Hao sighed.\u201cIt might not sound nice, but given Shengjia\u2019s aptitude, he won\u2019t be able to get into the battle hall anyway. During these few years of school, he had spent quite a lot of money but he didn\u2019t make much progress. Let alone his father, I also feel that it would be better for him to quit school and find a job to lighten the financial burden of his family.\u201dZhou Xu didn\u2019t have a bad heart, but he truly felt that Qi Shengjia was wasting time. Without the guidance of a great teacher, even if Qi Shengjia practiced without eating or sleep, he wouldn\u2019t have any results.Honestly speaking, a place like the Central Province Academy didn\u2019t lack students who were willing to work hard. What they lacked was the guidance of great teachers.When the two of them returned to their dorm and saw Qi Shengjia lying on this bed, they shook their heads. It seemed like Qi Shengjia\u2019s situation didn\u2019t turn for the better. The two of them didn\u2019t know how to console him, yet they suddenly heard him laughing.\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201dWang Hao waved his hand. \u201cHe has gone crazy.\u201d\u201cShengjia, there are many opportunities in life. Don\u2019t be too persistent about the present\u2026\u201dZhou Xu consoled, but before he could finish his sentence, he was interrupted.\u201cI broke through!\u201dQi Shengjia shared his happiness with these two friends of his.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe two of them were stunned. Zhou Xu walked forward and placed his hand on Qi Shengjia\u2019s forehead. \u201cAre you having a fever?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dQi Shengjia pulled Zhou Xu\u2019s hand away. \u201cI\u2019m telling you guys that Teacher Sun is very awesome. Not only has he cured me, but he even caused me to have a successful breakthrough!\u201d\u201cWhich Teacher Sun?\u201dZhou Xu asked.\u201cI\u2019m talking about Sun Mo, Teacher Sun!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euQi Shengjia\u2019s voice was filled with admiration.\u201cSun Mo? That new intern teacher?\u201dZhou Xu had some impression of this name. After all, Sun Mo\u2019s matters were considered a hot topic among the students.\u201cAre you certain you didn\u2019t mention the wrong name? I heard that he was a soft-rice guy who couldn\u2019t even become a teaching assistant. He was thrown into the logistics department instead!\u201dWang Hao was puzzled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t know what to reply upon being asked like this. After a while, he suddenly remembered a reason. \u201cThere must be someone among the higher-ups who was jealous of Teacher Sun\u2019s talent. This was why they forced him into the logistics department!\u201dWang Hao shrugged. \u201cSure, sure. Whatever you say!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not lying to you guys.\u201dQi Shengjia was anxious. \u201cI\u2019m telling you guys this because I wanted you guys to get his guidance. If he used his massaging technique on you guys and allowed you to level up, how good would that be?\u201dWang Hao\u2019s heart stirred.\u201cTell us how he guided you?\u201dZhou Xu was more intelligent. He wanted to judge Sun Mo\u2019s capability through the guidance process.Qi Shengjia stated everything truthfully.After Zhou Xu finished hearing it, he nodded. \u201cUnderstood, actually he didn\u2019t guide you much. He only gave you a massage.\u201d\u201cSeems like Sun Mo\u2019s massage techniques are not bad. We can try it!\u201dRight now, Wang Hao was stuck at the 4th-level of the body refinement realm for three months, showing no progress at all.\u201cIt\u2019s Teacher Sun!\u201dQi Shengjia strongly emphasized. He had wanted to say that they didn\u2019t have enough time last night, and so Teacher Sun only had time to help him recover and would guide him later on. However, he was interrupted by Zhou Xu.\u201cYou should rest. We will go and take a look!\u201dThe two of them walked out.\u201cYou all have to be more respectful to Teacher Sun!\u201dQi Shengjia reminded them. He lay down for a while, but he couldn\u2019t feel at ease. Hence, he got up, wore his shirt, and went out to chase after his friends.Bang!Li Gong kicked the door to the storehouse open, having an unfriendly look on his face. His gaze was like a razor blade, wanting to slice Sun Mo\u2019s flesh off.Sun Mo didn\u2019t even lift his eyelids. He continued to practice the first level of the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art.\u201cOi!\u201dSeeing Sun Mo ignoring him. Li Gong unhappily roared. However, this display of dominance was completely useless. During these few years in the Central Province Academy, he had seen quite a lot of intern teachers. The vast majority would be filled with trepidation when they first arrived. They were cautious and overly friendly, fearing that they might make mistakes.However, this Sun Mo was very good indeed. He was extremely calm.Despite having received the instructions from the logistics department head to chase Sun Mo out of the school, Li Gong had to admit that Sun Mo\u2019s temperament was very good. In addition to his exquisite face, as well as his body that was as straight as a ramrod, he was indeed very good-looking.\u201cAs expected, you have the capital to eat \u2018soft-rice\u2019.\u201dLi Gong mumbled. When he thought of his own ugly face, his unhappiness toward Sun Mo started to rise rapidly. He was preparing to ruthlessly teach Sun Mo a lesson.\u201cOh, so you like to be a cripple?\u201dSun Mo smiled lightly.\u201cYou are the one who likes to be one!\u201dLi Gong angrily cursed.\u201cIn that case, why is your attitude toward me, someone who can cure your lameness, so rude and unreasonable?\u201d Sun Mo counter-asked.\u201cYou can cure me?\u201d Li Gong\u2019s eyelids twitched.\u201cNaturally.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s words were simple and concise.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dLi Gong\u2019s chest heaved. He glared at Sun Mo with rage in his eyes. His fists were clenched tightly and wanted to hit someone. The mouth of this fellow was so toxic.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe it, you can scram!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s attitude became domineering.\u201cCould it be that you don\u2019t want to join the faculty after the internship?\u201dLi Gong threatened.As the saying went, it was easy to talk to the Yama King but hard to deal with the little ghosts. For a foreman in the logistics department like Li Gong, he could truly make an intern die if he was determined to mess with them.If the higher-ups arranged an intern under Li Gong, the intern would simply be in hell. After all, if an intern committed \u2018too many mistakes\u2019 during his internship, he would directly be fired. Whether the mistakes committed were a lot or little, it was naturally dependent on Li Gong\u2019s judgment.\u201cHehe.\u201dSun Mo coldly laughed. Although An Xinhui was his childhood sweetheart and this school was also a part of his childhood, he absolutely wouldn\u2019t give in and fawn on Li Gong.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dLi Gong was so angered that his lungs felt as though they were about to burst. At this moment, a call of \u2018Teacher Sun\u2019 interrupted their conversation.Qi Shengjia and his two friends stood at the door.\u201cThis is the storehouse area, what are you doing here?\u201dLi Gong suppressed his temper.\u201cWe are here to look for Teacher Sun!\u201dQi Shengjia replied.\u201cTeacher Sun?\u201dLi Gong\u2019s gaze was filled with suspicions as it landed on Sun Mo. \u201cYou are talking about him?\u201dThere was no need for Qi Shengjia to reply because he directly pulled Wang Hao and Zhou Xu along as they jogged to Sun Mo. \u201cGood afternoon, Teacher Sun!\u201d\u201cF***!\u201dLi Gong was shocked. He had a foolish look on his face as he surveyed Qi Shengjia. He wanted to ask if Qi Shengjia had gone crazy? Sun Mo wasn\u2019t even a teaching assistant!\u201cTeacher Sun, recently my cultivation hasn\u2019t been smooth. I wish to seek your guidance!\u201dZhou Xu had a glib tongue. He was the first to speak.Sun Mo didn\u2019t reply. He used Divine Sight and surveyed the two students.The name \u2018Wang Hao\u2019 appeared above the head of the slightly shorter guy on the left.Strength: 6, mediocre.Intellect: 5, standard.Agility: 6, mediocre.Will: 3, extraordinary mediocre.\u2026Potential value: below average.Note: Don\u2019t waste time on mediocre people.\u201cSystem, I thought you said I was toxic? Your notes are also quite brutal.\u201dSun Mo glanced over. There wasn\u2019t any especially dazzling data. Everything indicated mediocrity; it was so boring that people would fall asleep if they saw it.As for Zhou Xu, he was slightly more good-looking, but his stats were mediocre as well. However, his potential value was slightly stronger, evaluated at \u2018average\u2019.\u201cWhy are there no geniuses looking for me?\u201dSun Mo sighed.Seeing that Sun Mo wasn\u2019t speaking and was surveying their bodies, Wang Hao and Zhou Xu couldn\u2019t help but squirm as they felt a little uncomfortable.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me he is a pervert that likes pretty boys?\u201dZhou Xu, who had always felt himself to be handsome, touched his left face.\u201cOi, you guys must have been tricked by him. He can\u2019t even be a teaching assistant and can only come to the logistics department to help me do odd jobs.\u201dLi Gong vilified Sun Mo.\u201cPlease do not insult Teacher Sun!\u201dWang Hao and Zhou Xu had no reactions. But Qi Shengjia couldn\u2019t take it anymore and turned to roar at Li Gong.Li Gong\u2019s expression stiffened. A nameless evil fire rose in his chest. In the end, he was only a foreman in the logistics department, and even a trash student like Qi Shengjia dared to roar at him. Moreover, when facing Sun Mo, even if he was just an intern teacher, no students would dare to show him disrespect on the surface no matter how badly they were cursing Sun Mo in their hearts.This was the status of a teacher in society.In truth, if it wasn\u2019t for the logistics department head instructing him to make things difficult for Sun Mo and even saying he would bear all consequences, Li Gong wouldn\u2019t have messed with Sun Mo.Sun Mo lowered his head and stared at the light-blue robes he was wearing. Although this was made from cotton and the design was simple, it represented the identity of an intern teacher. Li Gong, although he was wearing a buttoned mandarin jacket and blue-cotton pants, including a gemstone ring on his finger that was unknown to be genuine or fake, he was still just an unskilled worker in the logistics department.\u201cI definitely have to wear the sky-blue teacher\u2019s attire!\u201dSun Mo suddenly felt that the set of clothes he was wearing was very irksome.\u201cTeacher Sun? I heard you helped Shengjia breakthrough in a single night?\u201dZhou Xu also couldn\u2019t control his emotions.\u201cYou guys can return. I\u2019m busy now!\u201dSun Mo naturally understood that these two students wanted to use his guidance as an excuse to experience the ancient massage technique.\u201cZhou Xu!\u201dQi Shengjia felt a little unhappy. Was this the attitude you should have when asking someone for help? What if this annoyed Teacher Sun?\u201cTeacher Sun, my cultivation has made no progress for three and a half months, please provide me with some guidance!\u201dCompared to Zhou Xu, Wang Hao\u2019s performance was more obedient.\u201cFoolish!\u201dLi Gong stared at them with disdain. The Central Province Academy had truly declined. The students they recruited were getting more and more trashy, and they didn\u2019t even have basic judgment any longer.\u201cYour problem lies in you wasting too much energy. Stop thinking about women, and you should also not overly indulge in mast*rbation. After resting for a while, your problem will be solved as long as you focus on your cultivation.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s expression was calm, but he was laughing in his heart. The data showed that Wang Hao\u2019s will was only 3 points. It was very bad. The data also showed that he would frequently stay up late through the recent half of the year. He needed to mast*rbate five to six times a day. No matter how strong a young man\u2019s body was, it wouldn\u2019t be able to take it.\u201cEh!\u201dWang Hao didn\u2019t expect Sun Mo to point out something like this. He was in a daze. After that, his face turned as red as a baboon\u2019s buttocks.\u201cHow embarrassing!\u201dSeeing that his secret was discovered, Wang Hao was so embarrassed that he didn\u2019t know what to do. He was fond of reading novels. Half a year ago, he had managed to borrow a book named [Silver Lotus] for reading. After he finished it, it was like a brand new world had opened up for him. From then on, he couldn\u2019t stop.It was also at that time that he got into the habit of mast*rbation. He wanted to get rid of the habit, but sometimes, he couldn\u2019t bear the impulse.\u201cThis is nonsense, right?\u201dZhou Xu glanced at Sun Mo, feeling that this Sun Mo was good at talking bullshit with a straight face.\u201cTeacher Sun, thank you for your guidance!\u201dWang Hao bowed. Compared to earlier, his attitude was much more respectful now.He wasn\u2019t a fool. Sun Mo had merely taken a few glances at him earlier and could tell where his problem lay. Wasn\u2019t his judgment a little too terrifying? If Sun Mo took the effort to guide him, he might be able to improve his strength by a lot.Ding!Favorable impression points from Wang Hao +5.Prestige connection with Wang Hao unlocked. Current state: Neutral (5/100)!\u201cAh? His words were correct?\u201dZhou Xu was shocked after seeing Wang Hao\u2019s attitude. Speaking of mast*rbation, he recalled that during these few days, Wang Hao\u2019s toilet time had become longer and he would frequently stay in the toilet for one hour. Zhou Xu had initially been worried that Wang Hao was not feeling well.Qi Shengjia had a stupefied look on his face. He didn\u2019t understand what mast*rbation was!\u201cReally?\u201dLi Gong stared at Sun Mo doubtfully. Was he so awesome? Or was this a prank? This must be a prank, right?\u201cI really didn\u2019t judge wrongly. Teacher Sun is so awesome!\u201dQi Shengjia was proud of this.Ding!Favorable impression from Qi Shengjia +1Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia: Neutral (51/100).Sun Mo glanced at Qi Shengjia while feeling a myriad of emotions in his heart. Honest people were so nice. It hadn\u2019t been a day and Qi Shengjia had contributed over 50 favorable impression points to him.\u201cIn the future, why don\u2019t I look for students with lower intellect?\u201dSun Mo was silently contemplating. To nurture such students into talent, the difficulty was greatly increased.Zhou Xu and Wang Hao wanted to experience the ancient massage technique, but they didn\u2019t know what they should say. Qi Shengjia was an honest man. As he couldn\u2019t bear to see his good friends in such an awkward position, he decided to help them say it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTeacher Sun, they wished to experience your massage technique!\u201dQi Shengjia\u2019s EQ was too low. He basically didn\u2019t think that if Sun Mo was unwilling, this sentence would cause Sun Mo to be very unhappy and start to loathe him.Sun Mo didn\u2019t think too much about this and wanted to reject it. (You say you want to experience it, and I have to let you experience it? What about my reputation?)However, before he could say anything, the system notification rang out.\u201cDing! New mission. Help ten people solve their energy channels\u2019 issues. Do your best to upgrade the circulation technique. Reward: One black-iron treasure chest!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The easier they could get something, the less they would cherish it. They could tell that Sun Mo didn\u2019t wish to display his massage technique and this caused them to become extremely nervous, filling their heart with worry.Li Gong decided not to mess with Sun Mo for now. He wanted to observe him for a little while. If Sun Mo was truly capable, Li Gong would have to change his attitude toward him.\u201cAlright then!\u201dIn order to complete his new mission, Sun Mo could only do this. \u201cHowever, this isn\u2019t any massage technique. It\u2019s known as the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands!\u201d\u201cWhat a powerful name!\u201dWang Hao was astonished.\u201cTyrannical!\u201dZhou Xu praised.\u201cThis is a consummate skill that has been lost since ancient times. After using it, it will clear your meridians and energy channels, improve blood circulation to your muscles, allow you to be immune to a hundred illnesses, and maintain your peak state for a longer period.\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t have any intentions to lie to people. However, he felt the name \u2018massage technique\u2019 too unpleasant-sounding.Qi Shengjia\u2019s gaze was filled with enthusiasm. When he thought about his body being massaged by such a consummate skill last night, he was so emotional that he was shaking.\u201cYou first, lie on the wooden plank!\u201dSun Mo pointed to Wang Hao.Wang Hao immediately went to the wooden plank and lay down obediently. His body was tense and straight, like a salted fish waiting to be packed.\u201cRelax!\u201dSun Mo instructed. His hands grabbed out, and he used force to knead Wang Hao\u2019s veins on his thigh.\u201cArgh!\u201dA heart-drilling pain started to spread from that area, causing Wang Hao to scream. Half of his body directly turned numb.\u201cYou are too lazy, even your veins are starting to be rusty.\u201dSun Mo frowned. His expert-grade circulation technique allowed him to accurately assess the conditions of Wang Hao\u2019s meridians.This Wang Hao\u2019s potential value was higher than Qi Shengjia. However, his constitution was extremely ordinary.\u201cI\u2026I will start working hard tomorrow!\u201dWang Hao turned red and guaranteed while stuttering. At the same time, his admiration for Sun Mo grew. Indeed, ever since he got hooked on reading novels, the amount of time he spent on cultivating had been reduced by half.Teacher Sun could tell his condition just by kneading his thighs. Teacher Sun was simply too awesome!As the pain faded, currents of warmth generated in his body, causing Wang Hao to moan in comfort. He felt that the accumulated fatigue of these past few days had vanished.Five minutes later, Sun Mo heard the system\u2019s notification.\u201cDing! The optimal performance of the target\u2019s energy channels is extended by 120 two-hour periods.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Sun Mo since he didn\u2019t understand.\u201cThere\u2019s a lifespan for the various organs and tissues in the human body. After the lifespan is exceeded, their performance would gradually decline. The energy channels share the same logic. Your Tuina technique can allow your target\u2019s energy channels to maintain their optimal performance for a bonus of 120 two-hour periods,\u201d the system explained.\u201c120 two-hour periods, which means 240 hours or also equal to 10 days. Isn\u2019t the amount of time too little?\u201dSun Mo instantly calculated. What could someone do in 10 days?\u201cOptimal performance is when the target\u2019s energy channels are in the \u2018extreme eruption state\u2019. You can extend this period by 240 hours.\u201dThe system replied.Sun Mo nodded to indicate that he understood. In this case, the circulation technique was truly impressive. If he leveled it up to the grandmaster-grade or ancestor-grade, the upgrade this technique brought to his targets would be even greater.\u201cAlright, your turn now!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t massage them for nothing. His comprehension of the circulation technique improved by a little again.Wang Hao stood on the ground and couldn\u2019t help but jump about, punching out a few times. Right now, he felt that his body was more relaxed and lighter. His punches were also more accurate.However, the most important thing was that he could feel the qi circulation in his body quicken!Wang Hao immediately became joyful. Before this, the circulation of qi in his body had been sluggish. Now that the circulation had become quicker, it also meant that his state of being had improved and his cultivation level had been enhanced by a little. If he could maintain this state of being, he would be able to break through to the 5th-level of body refinement realm very quickly.\u201cTeacher Sun, thank you!\u201dDing!Favorable impression points from Wang Hao +18.Prestige connection with Wang Hao. Neutral (23/100)Zhou Xu comfortably closed his eyes. His father was a tea merchant and he was quite wealthy. Hence, Zhou Xu would often go to various associations and enjoy all types of massages. But even for those aged masseurs with plenty of experience, they had no way to be compared to Sun Mo.Sun Mo\u2019s skill was not as fanciful, but its effect was beyond comparison.\u201cDing! The optimal performance of the target\u2019s energy channels is extended by 100 two-hour periods.\u201dThe system\u2019s notification rang out.\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201dSun Mo contemplated and understood. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t done the massage well. In this case, Zhou Xu\u2019s energy channels were healthier than Wang Hao\u2019s. Therefore, the upgrade that the massage had brought for him was slightly weaker in comparison.This also indicated that Zhou Xu\u2019s cultivation, aptitude, diet, and many other aspects were superior to Wang Hao. If not, Zhou Xu wouldn\u2019t be a level higher than Wang Hao.Zhou Xu didn\u2019t get up straight after the massage. He began to breathe in and out in tandem with the circulation of spirit qi. Very soon, the spirit qi in the surroundings gathered, forming a mini-spiral before entering his body.BOOM!Zhou Xu\u2019s clothes began to swell. His muscles became full and were glowing with a faint layer of light.Crackle! Crackle!Zhou Xu\u2019s entire body began to emit a cracking sound.\u201cHe is going to break through?\u201dLi Gong exclaimed in shock.\u201cHush!\u201dQi Shengjia and Wang Hao hurriedly shush Li Gong, indicating for him not to disturb Zhou Xu.Sun Mo took several steps back. His arms were crossed over his chest as he observed Zhou Xu.Not long later, a booming sound like an exploded balloon rang out from inside Zhou Xu. The gathered spirit qi in him burst forth, permeating the surroundings, causing the dust here to be blown away. After that, Zhou Xu\u2019s breathing gradually became level.The spirit qi in the surroundings also reverted to their earlier state of calmness.His breakthrough had ended.\u201cHaha, I broke through to the 6th-level of the body refinement realm!\u201dZhou Xu laughed out loud. He couldn\u2019t help but forcefully thump his chest. After the 9th-level of body refinement, it would be the spirit refinement realm. That realm wasn\u2019t far from him.\u201cTeacher Sun, your Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands are truly awesome!\u201dZhou Xu praised him sincerely. As a young man with average potential, his perception was stronger than Wang Hao. He could sense that while Sun Mo had been massaging him, the circulation of his spirit qi had been much faster and also increased in quantity.Spirit qi was the foundation of everything.During combat, cultivators needed to expend spirit qi. The faster their spirit qi circulated, the faster it would be replenished. It also represented that one\u2019s combat strength would be higher.\u201cCongratulations!\u2019Qi Shengjia punched his good friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie, right? Teacher Sun is very awesome!\u201d\u201cCongratulations!\u2019Wang Hao also congratulated Zhou Xu. He was filled with envy, and he was annoyed at himself. After the massage, his condition was extremely good. It was the best chance to try for a breakthrough, but why didn\u2019t he think of it.He had the same opportunity but wasn\u2019t able to grab hold of it. This was too depressing.Ding!Favorable impression points from Zhou Xu +25.Prestige connection with Zhou Xu unlocked. Current state: Neutral (25/100).\u201cF***, this soft-rice guy is so awesome?\u201dLi Gong was dumbfounded. However, the truth was before his eyes.\u201cTeacher, are you free tonight? I wish to be the host and treat you to a dinner to express my respect.\u201dZhou Xu had a smile on his face.Zhou Xu, who was from a merchant clan, knew when to grab hold of opportunities to build better relationships. Even if Sun Mo\u2019s teaching ability wasn\u2019t that good, this Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands was enough for him to spend a large sum of money to get to know Sun Mo.\u201cI\u2019m very busy!\u201dSun Mo would never attend such invitations.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. This student was too impetuous.\u201dZhou Xu hurriedly apologized and felt some regret. He had just broken through and was too excited. Hence, he thought of things too simply. This kind of invitation should be sent by his father, and he should also prepare a gift for Sun Mo. Only then would his actions have enough weight.\u201cAlright, disperse if there\u2019s nothing else. Work hard when you go back.\u201dSun Mo waved his hand. He still needed to handle Li Gong.After hearing these words, Qi Shengjia and his friends solemnly bowed. \u201cWe, your students, will take our leave first!\u201d\u201cSun Mo, can you help my lame leg to recover?\u201dAfter seeing the three students leave, Li Gong impatiently asked.\u201cSystem, how do I train my circulation technique to the grandmaster-grade?\u201dXun Mo silently asked.\u201cUse the circulation technique for 10,000 hours. Once your proficiency grows, you will be able to attain the grandmaster-grade.\u201dThe system stated.\u201cSo many hours!\u201dWhen he heard the amount of time needed, Sun Mo lost interest completely. Even if he didn\u2019t become a great teacher, he wouldn\u2019t want to be a little masseur either.\u201cAll techniques and skills are the sublimation of experience. Being called a grandmaster means you can be considered as an existence at the peak of \u2018this dao\u2019.\u201dThe system could even say such profound and philosophical things? Sun Mo was really astonished.\u201cSun Mo!\u201dLi Gong walked to the front of Sun Mo as he shouted.\u201cDo we have such a close relationship?\u201d Sun Mo corrected. \u201cCall me Teacher Sun!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dLi Gong was extremely unhappy, but when he thought of his lame leg, he squeezed out a smile. \u201cTeacher Sun!\u201d\u201cAre these three examples enough for you to believe my words?\u201dSun Mo activated Divine Sight and glanced at Li Gong\u2019s lame leg. There was no mistake. This was a problem of damaged energy meridians, and he could cure it.\u201cIf you cure my leg, I won\u2019t make things hard on you again.\u201d Li Gong set a price.\u201cYou are already over 40 years old, but you are still so naive?\u201d Sun Mo mocked.\u201cWhat do you want then?\u201dPak!Sun Mo lifted his hand and slapped Li Gong\u2019s face on the left, leaving behind a palm imprint.\u201cYou hit me?\u201dLi Gong was stunned. \u201cYou actually dared to hit me?\u201dAlthough he was from the logistics department, he had been in this school for seven years. Even when the teachers saw him, they would nod and greet him, causing him to feel a little proud of himself. Yet, he was smacked by an intern teacher today? No, Sun Mo wasn\u2019t even an intern teacher\u2026Pak!Sun Mo completely disregarded Li Gong, who was as angry as a mad dog, as he slapped him again with the back of his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m hitting you.\u201dThis taunt directly caused Li Gong\u2019s anger to burn. His wrinkly old face flushed red. \u201cI\u2019M GOING TO KILL YOU TODAY!\u201d\u201cDo you wish to be lame forever?\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t dodge. He continued standing at his original location and looked at Li Gong calmly.Li Gong felt like a bucket of ice was pouring on his head. His anger instantly extinguished as he froze on the spot. His expression was incomparably gloomy.He had been lamed for 12 years and had visited many doctors, but all of them didn\u2019t have a solution. Gradually, Li Gong gave up. But now, there was a chance before his eyes. He truly didn\u2019t want to miss it.\u201cIf I can walk normally, others wouldn\u2019t look at me with contempt anymore. If my leg is healed, I will be able to find a better job\u2026\u201dA lame leg didn\u2019t simply bring about a physical handicap to Li Gong. He also felt inferior to others in his heart. The word \u2018cripple\u2019 made him extremely uncomfortable.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou are an intern under my supervision. Are you not afraid of being fired if I say that your performance is bad?\u201dLi Gong threatened.Sun Mo\u2019s answer was very simple. He launched another slap over.Pak!A crisp sound rang out. His palm imprint was extremely clear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why was this fellow so gusty? Wait a minute, he suddenly realized something. \u201cDo you think that Headmaster An Xinhui can protect you? Stop dreaming. The school isn\u2019t a place where her words alone hold sway\u2026\u201dThis time around, he didn\u2019t wait for Li Gong to finish talking. Sun Mo directly opened up his stance. His back-hand and front-hand launched forward, slapping both sides of Li Gong\u2019s face.Pak! Pak! Pak!In the storehouse, the sound of slappings echoed out.\u201cStop hitting, I\u2019m in the wrong!\u201dLi Gong covered his head. In order to cure his lame leg, he decided to endure. Besides, he had discovered that this brat was much more self-confident than before. His tongue was also more \u2018poisonous\u2019.Sun Mo stopped. His gaze held no fluctuations as he stared at Li Gong. He didn\u2019t forget the vile attitude this fellow had shown him that day when he scolded him.This fellow kept finding trouble for Sun Mo because his purpose was to get him fired. Once Sun Mo was fired, he would have a black mark on his record forever, and it might be impossible for him to find another job as a teacher in another school. Even if he were to look for other jobs, his future would definitely be affected.Facing a fellow who wanted to destroy his future, Sun Mo absolutely wouldn\u2019t feel pity.\u201cWhat do you want me to do before you will cure my leg?\u201dLi Gong\u2019s tone turned soft. Many intern teachers were afraid of committing mistakes during their internship as they would be fired. Thus, what he could threaten Sun Mo with was his power to grade Sun Mo badly. But if Sun Mo didn\u2019t care whether he joined the faculty or not, the threat Li Gong presented would be ineffective.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dSun Mo counter-asked.Li Gong fell silent. As an experienced member of the society, he knew what Sun Mo wanted. However, he couldn\u2019t say it or he wouldn\u2019t be able to stay in the school any longer.\u201cNo one instructed me to make things hard on you. I was the one who feels that you are unworthy after I heard that you are Headmaster An\u2019s fiance. I felt unhappy in my heart, and this was why I messed with you.\u201dBefore the sound of Li Gong\u2019s words faded, Sun Mo\u2019s hand smacked over again.Pak!Li Gong staggered, his face had swollen.\u201cWho the hell do you think you are? With your guts, how would you dare to mess with me if there was no one instructing you? Have you gone stupid from eating too much?\u201dSun Mo sneered.Plop!Li Gong\u2019s knees turned soft as he knelt. Mucus and tears flowed down his face as he cried, \u201cI can\u2019t say it. If I say it, not only will I not be able to keep my job, but I will also be beaten to death.\u201d\u201cYou can escape.\u201dSun Mo squatted down and looked at Li Gong. \u201cOnce your leg is healed, you can find another job whenever you want.\u201dLi Gong hesitated. He felt he was extremely unlucky.\u201cIt\u2019s Department Head Yang Cai from the logistics department. If I can chase you away, he promised to make me his vice department head.\u201d\u201cWhy does he want to target me?\u201dSun Mo frowned.\u201cMaybe you took something from him?\u201dAfter Li Gong finished speaking, when he saw Sun Mo lifting his hand again, he hurriedly covered his head. \u201cI have no idea. Maybe the higher-ups wanted to make trouble for An Xinhui and you got implicated?\u201dAny places with humans would have disputes over benefits. The Central Province Academy also wasn\u2019t a board of iron. It had fallen to the bottom of the \u2018D\u2019 grade in the league tournament and was at the point where its name was about to be removed. Other than the calamity that had happened 300 years ago being a part of the reason, there were also huge issues in the internal departments of the school.Sun Mo furrowed his brows as he sank into contemplation.Li Gong knelt on the ground, didn\u2019t dare to disturb Sun Mo or get up.\u201cYou should have done many bad things for Yang Cai, right?\u201dSun Mo suddenly spoke, scaring Li Gong badly.\u201cNo! No!\u201dLi Gong hurriedly waved his hands in denial. Pak! Another slap was launched at him, and he almost became stupid from the force of it.\u201cThere are over twenty staff in the logistics department, so why did he choose you specifically? If you say you are not his lackey, who will believe this?\u201dSun Mo liked to read novels, and he especially loved those logic deductions genres.\u201cAre you a devil?\u201dLi Gong\u2019s body shivered. Sun Mo\u2019s eyes had clear distinctive shades of black and white, and the calmness and self-confidence radiating from them made Li Gong feel as though he had been seen through.\u201cAlright, tell me everything you know!\u201dSun Mo grabbed hold of Li Gong\u2019s lame leg and started to employ the circulation technique.Li Gong\u2019s body trembled. He had been prepared to not say anything even if he was beaten to death. However, a current of warmth could be felt from his lame leg, causing his spirits to stir.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dLi Gong stared at Sun Mo with shock. The Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands were truly awesome. With a casual press, his leg already felt much more comfortable.Ding!Favorable impression points from Li Gong +5.Prestige connection with Li Gong: Neutral (6/100).\u201cI said it before, I can heal your leg!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s voice was filled with confidence.Li Gong hummed and hawed, eventually saying all the \u2018black history\u2019 he knew about. His leg had been crippled for almost 12 years. He would feel it grow cold in the summer, and he had to wrap his to protect it. It felt even worse in the winter. Now that he had felt a sense of comfort from his leg, he truly didn\u2019t want to miss out on this opportunity.\u201cCorruption is truly a widespread phenomenon.\u201dAfter listening to Li Gong\u2019s words, Sun Mo\u2019s expression grew increasingly colder.\u201cPlease press a little bit more for me!\u201dAfter that, Sun Mo\u2019s hand moved away. The sense of comfort Li Gong felt instantly vanished.\u201cHmph, listen well and follow my instructions exactly to the letter. After this matter is settled, I will cure your leg completely.\u201dSun Mo carefully told him what to do.\u201cNo way. If I do this, I will die for sure!\u201dAfter Li Gong heard what Sun Mo said, his face turned completely pale.Sun Mo took out a chestnut-size white-colored jade stone and tossed it about between his hands.\u201cVoice-retention stone?\u201dLi Gong wailed in grief. He was so angered that he almost fainted. \u201cSun Mo, you are scheming against me!\u201dA voice-retention stone was a special jade stone that could record the surrounding noises. Li Gong didn\u2019t expect Sun Mo to have this trick up his sleeves.\u201cYou\u2019ve already said so much. Do you think you still have the chance to go back on our deal?\u201dAlthough a voice-retention stone wasn\u2019t cheap, even poor students would do their best to prepare one. They could use it to record the lessons given by great teachers and use it as a source of revision in the future.After Sun Mo saw this stone in his luggage, he knew that his plans were in the bag. As long as Li Gong fell for the first step, he would have no choice but to board this ship of his.As a fan of deduction-genre novels, Sun Mo knew that secret records were weapons that would never blunt from use.Li Gong gritted his teeth, looking like a mad dog that was about to bite. He rushed toward Sun Mo, wanting to snatch the voice-retention stone back.Sun Mo had long since been on guard against this fellow.Just when Li Gong moved, Sun Mo\u2019s right leg lifted high and kicked at Li Gong\u2019s head.Bang!Li Gong was flung to the side like a sack. The impact of the fall caused the dust here to fly around.\u201cTsk!\u2019Sun Mo moved his leg about. As expected of a world where spirit qi could be cultivated. This made it so that his body was extremely healthy and robust.After being kicked, Li Gong started to be afraid. Had he gone mad? He had attacked Sun Mo. Even if this guy was someone who ate \u2018soft-rice\u2019, he was ultimately a graduate from the Songyang Academy.\u201cI will give you two days to think!\u201dSun Mo flicked away the dust on his robes. \u201cThink about it. If your leg is healed, you can find a respectable job and earn more money.\u201dLi Gong\u2019s heart was moved. Doing odd jobs was tiring and the pay was low. Also, because his movements were inconvenienced, the work was sometimes strenuous for him.\u201cIn any case, given how old you are and with a lame leg, even if you went out to play, those ugly old women wouldn\u2019t care about you right?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s tongue was toxic.Li Gong started. After that, his face turned black. He could only feel resentment and helplessness in his heart.\u2026Walking on the limestone pathway of the school, basking in the sunlight of the afternoon, Sun Mo felt extremely comfortable in his heart. After settling Li Gong, no one would temporarily make trouble for him. He could relax for a few days.The Central Province Academy was very big. Sun Mo would occasionally see students with immature looks on their faces. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that their clothes were of the ancient style, Sun Mo would have felt that he returned to his old school.After entering the school gate, if one walked for a few more steps to the main avenue, there would be a small public square. At this moment, someone was preparing some set-ups here. Seven days later, this would be the location for the student recruitment meet.The standard of recruitment for Central Province Academy was that the students had to reach 12 years of age.In the past, even before the student recruitment meet, the school gate would have been destroyed by the students who came to join the school. Hence, there had been a need to prepare an entry test to filter away those students who weren\u2019t up to the standard.Now, as the standard of the school dropped to the \u2018D\u2019 grade, other than some false reputation, the grandness of the recruitment meet no longer existed. As long as their slots could be filled, the school leaders would already thank the heavens and earth.The Myriad Daos Academy, which replaced the Central Province Academy, was now the number one academy in Jinling City. It was the top choice of school for high officials and rich merchants.\u201cFrom Li Ziqi\u2019s way of talking and clothes, she should be from a wealthy family. Her parents will definitely hope for her to go to the Myriad Daos Academy. So why did the system want me to get her to be my student? This mission is truly too difficult.\u201dHonestly speaking, if he was Li Ziqi\u2019s parents, he would also choose the Myriad Daos Academy for her. Who didn\u2019t wish for their children to attend a better school?\u201cForget it, I will take a step at a time. Let\u2019s hope there will be no punishments if I fail the mission!\u201dSun Mo touched his hair. Speaking of which, he still had three missions. One was to become a teaching assistant in half-a-month, and the reward was a golden treasure chest. Initially, the mission\u2019s duration was one month. But because he spoke too much, the duration was changed. If he couldn\u2019t complete this, the system had clearly expressed that there would be a strict punishment.The second mission was to help Qi Shengjia pass the battle hall\u2019s test. The reward would also be a golden treasure chest. However, after Sun Mo understood the test\u2019s mechanism and Qi Shengjia\u2019s extremely low potential value, he felt that this was almost impossible.The third mission was a simple one, but Sun Mo wasn\u2019t that keen because there was no challenge to it. Just like what the system had said, a great teacher was someone who transformed the impossible into the possible, allowing trash to become a gem.This sentence fit Sun Mo\u2019s style. Because when he played games, he would always start with the highest difficulty level.\u201cDuring the student recruitment meet, I must definitely select a few students that have off-the-charts potential.\u201dSun Mo rubbed his eyes. The Divine Sight spell was the source of his confidence. \u201cI heard my fiance is named An Xinhui? Hmm, this name is really not bad. I heard she\u2019s also a beauty on the Devastating Beauty Rankings, should I go and see her?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe Devastating Beauty Rankings were only for female great teachers. As the name implied, not only must the female great teacher be extremely beautiful, but their knowledge must also be profound and deep, suffering no disadvantages when compared with their outstanding and peerless demeanor. One could say that those who could take a spot in it were all goddesses that males wanted to chase after.This ranking was different from the Greencloud Rankings and Great Teacher Rankings. The Beauty Rankings was announced by the government after collecting a large amount of data. As the rankers were chosen by everyone else in the public, it was worthy of being believed.One must know that in this current age, there were no hired posters on the internet to sway the opinions of the public. Hence, those on the rankings must have received the public\u2019s approval and recognition.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be illegal to glance at my own fiance, right?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s heart stirred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The smell of the fresh air with a hint of summer was very comfortable.Sun Mo walked to the end of the stone path and stopped in his footsteps, allowing the shadows from the mulberry tree to cast down and flicker on his body. He then turned and headed toward the dorm building.What point would there be if a man didn\u2019t equip himself with a famous blade and ride a great horse to meet his beloved woman?\u201cSince An Xinhui is the headmaster, then I must at least be a great teacher, right?\u201dSun Mo mumbled and then added one more thought in his heart. \u201d I have to become the top great teacher in Jinling!\u201dDing!\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019ve reached 100 favorable impression points, activating the great teacher path. As you have taken a small step on the great teacher path, you\u2019re rewarded with a lucky treasure chest. I hope that from now on, you\u2019ll obtain even greater achievements as a great teacher. Good luck, intern teacher Sun Mo!\u201dThe system\u2019s series of reminders cut off Sun Mo\u2019s thoughts.\u201cDo you have to speak up suddenly every single time? You\u2019re like a ghost and it\u2019s quite scary!\u201dSun Mo complained, but the system naturally wouldn\u2019t pay him any heed.A lucky treasure chest that flashed in red light landed in front of Sun Mo\u2019s eyes. He was familiar with this situation and called out \u2018open\u2019 softly.It opened with the command and then immediately disappeared, leaving behind a small, round glass bottle that was the size of a palm. It was flat and there was a creamy white liquid inside.\u2018The ancient whale oil is the essence extracted from the ancient whale. It is refined together with 16 precious medicinal herbs and is for external application. It can strengthen the body, prevent illnesses, relieve pain, and increase the sensitivity of the six senses.\u2019\u2018Remark, as the effect is too powerful, please use small amounts appropriately each time. If used in too high of a dosage, it\u2019ll corrode the nerves and result in a huge sense of excitement.\u2019After looking at the instructions on the bottle, Sun Mo was speechless. \u201cSystem, you want me to go further and further down the path of a masseur? Nurturing a great teacher? You must be nurturing a masseur instead.\u201d\u201cPlease do not doubt the accuracy of the Absolute Great Teacher System,\u201d the system emphasized. \u201cMoreover, there aren\u2019t any differences in statuses between jobs.\u201d\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you a Foot-Masseur System?\u201dSun Mo asked.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe system fell silent for about ten or more seconds and then diverted the conversation, \u201cPlease do not underestimate the ancient whale oil. When used together with the ancient massage technique, it can have a powerful effect.\u201dHe opened up the shopping store and saw that other than the Bodhi Fruit, there was also a bottle of ancient whale oil on the rack that looked exactly the same as what he had just gotten. The amount was 200ml, and the price was set at 1,000 favorable impression points.\u201cIt\u2019s so expensive?\u201dSun Mo was shocked. This was comparable to the price of a Bodhi Fruit.200ml? Was that little? Of course, it was. Sun Mo had seen his female colleague\u2019s 200ml Chanel No. 5 perfume that cost over 2,500 RMB. After she bought that, she ate plain buns and salted vegetables for over a month.That was a perfume, and a light puff of it would allow one to have the fragrance for one day. One could use it for several months. But he\u2019d have to use 7 to 8 ml worth of this ancient whale oil each time, right? Otherwise, if the person had a big face, there wouldn\u2019t be enough to cover the face, let alone using enough for a full body massage.\u201cCheap things aren\u2019t good. Everything sold by the system shopping store is worth more than their price!\u201dThe system added, \u201cFor a full body massage, you\u2019ll just need to use 5ml of the ancient whale oil and dilute it with clean water in a 5:1 ratio. If the ratio is even lower, the effect would be reduced even more.\u201cA full body massage will give you at least 25 favorable impression points.\u201dSun Mo immediately did his estimation. It seemed that he had to use it sparingly.\u201cWhy do you have to use it sparingly? The high price is to stimulate you to work hard and guide even more students, gaining favorable impression points.\u201dThe system made his scheming sound so legitimate, giving Sun Mo the urge to raise his middle finger at it.Sun Mo currently had 109 favorable impression points, out of which 4 came from Li Ziqi, 6 from Li Gong, 23 from Wang Hao, 25 from Zhou Xu, and rest came from Qi Shengjia\u2019s 51.\u201cIs there anything I can purchase?\u201dSun Mo asked as he walked.\u201cThe lucky treasure chest costs 10 favorable impression points each. It gives you a certain chance of drawing items sold in the shopping store.\u201dThe system recommended.\u201cI\u2019m an unlucky person who can\u2019t even win a consolation prize in lucky draws since young. Aren\u2019t you asking me to waste all the favorable impression points by doing that?\u201dSun Mo rolled his eyes.After returning to the dorm building, Sun Mo saw a student standing in front of the entrance. He was bowing toward Zhang Sheng. \u201cTeacher Zhang, thank you for your guidance.\u201d\u201cGo on. Go back and work hard.\u201dZhang Sheng was holding a book in his left hand, and his right hand clasped behind his back. He wore a faint smile, putting on the appearance of a great teacher.Seeing that Sun Mo had come back, Zhang Sheng threw a sideward glance at him and then turned his head away, not even bothering to give a greeting. He didn\u2019t want to get close to useless men like him.Yuan Feng and Ludi were both in the dorm. The former also ignored Sun Mo, but Ludi nodded. Ludi was someone who would choose not to offend anyone.\u201cZhang Sheng, this is the fifth student who had come to look for you for guidance, right? It seems that you\u2019ve already gained the recognition of some students as a teaching assistant!\u201dYuan Feng said politely.\u201cIt\u2019s acceptable!\u201dZhang Sheng wore a proud expression and went back to his bed, continuing with his meditation.The atmosphere in the dorm was very awkward.Zhang Sheng looked down on Sun Mo. Or rather, it could be said that Zhang Sheng looked down on his three roommates. Other than giving short replies when Yuan Feng was making polite and respectful talk, he usually spent his time meditating and didn\u2019t chat with them. Yuan Feng also didn\u2019t care for Sun Mo and thus chose to ignore him.Ludi had a nonchalant attitude toward Sun Mo, but he wouldn\u2019t take the risk of offending Zhang Sheng and Yuan Feng and talk to him.Sun Mo could be said to be ostracized and was unable to integrate with them. However, he didn\u2019t care about this. Instead, he felt that it was very quiet, which allowed him to contemplate some things.Sun Mo would definitely not bootlick someone to get into their good books.A quiet night passed by.In the morning, Ludi took his pig trotter and soup stock to bring to the canteen to stew. This was his unique means of getting into the teachers\u2019 good books.\u201cTeacher Zhou has already eaten two pieces. By the time he eats five pieces, I should be able to stay in the school,\u201dLudi yearned for a beautiful future.Every intern teacher was tagged to a senior teacher as their teaching assistant. The senior teachers\u2019 assessment of them held great influence on whether they could continue to stay in the school or not.The dorm\u2019s door was opened, and Ludi saw seven students standing outside. He wasn\u2019t surprised. It was because quite a number of students had come to seek Zhang Sheng\u2019s guidance yesterday. Therefore, he turned and called out.\u201cZhang Sheng, there are students looking for you to get your guidance!\u201dLudi yawned, feeling a little envious.\u201cIt\u2019s good to be rich.\u201dLudi touched his pocket. He didn\u2019t have the money to get students to join his side. However, he had his pig trotters, and it would more or less have the same effect in his opinion.\u201cZhang Sheng, there are too many students. Will you be able to cope?\u201d Yuan Feng said politely, wearing a smile but feeling very gloomy. Why didn\u2019t he have a rich father?\u201cIt\u2019s a small case!\u201dZhang Sheng smoothened out his hair, and after ascertaining that there were no creases on his clothes, he walked out. \u201cTake turns, one at a time. You go first!\u201dWang Hao, who was selected, was dumbfounded. He subconsciously asked, \u201cWhat am I supposed to say?\u201d\u201cEn?\u201d Zhang Sheng was stunned. \u201cAren\u2019t you here to seek guidance?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dWang Hao nodded.\u201cThen what do you think you should be saying?\u201dZhang Sheng\u2019s tone turned solemn, bearing a little grudge toward Fang Ziliang. He had paid a huge price, but yet Fang Ziliang wasn\u2019t reliable at all. Even if he had looked for people to put up an act, he should have looked for a few smarter students.Wang Hao scratched his head, wearing a dazed expression.\u201cErm, we\u2019re here to look for Teacher Sun, Sun Mo.\u201dZhou Xu said and tilted his body, avoiding Zhang Sheng. He then looked into the dorm.\u201cHuh?\u201dLudi, who had wanted to leave, stopped in his footsteps and turned to look back.Hearing this, Zhang Sheng\u2019s countenance turned grim. He glared at Ludi and returned to the dorm.\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault!\u201dLudi didn\u2019t know how to react. He had wanted to explain that he had no idea Sun Mo would be so shameless as to have gotten people to put on this act.\u201cHaha!\u201dSeeing Zhang Sheng getting humiliated, Yuan Feng went back under his blankets and almost laughed out loud.\u201cGood morning, Teacher Sun!\u201dZhou Xu stood at the door and greeted Sun Mo, who had gotten up after hearing the noises. After the massage from yesterday, his condition was now very good.\u201cTeacher Sun.\u201dWang Hao quickly greeted him as well, smiling brightly.\u201cLook at the people he looked for. Their aptitude for acting is so high. This guy\u2019s smile looks like he admires Sun Mo from the bottom of his heart.\u201dZhang Sheng was stumped and wanted to go look for Fang Ziliang to get a refund.\u201cSun Mo, you must have spent quite a lot of money to hire the help of seven students.\u201dYuan Feng purposely spoke out loud, wanting to ridicule Sun Mo, putting him in an awkward spot. However, Sun Mo didn\u2019t pay him any heed at all.\u201cWhat do you guys want?\u201dSun Mo walked out and stood at the corridor, glancing toward them.His Divine Sight was activated, and every student\u2019s statistics appeared next to them. Amongst them, the one with the highest potential value was only at the average level.\u201cTeacher Sun, they\u2019re all here to seek your guidance,\u201d Zhou Xu explained.\u201cI\u2019m not free!\u201dAfter saying that, Sun Mo went downstairs. How could Zhou Xu possibly hide his thoughts from Sun Mo? These people must have come to see things for themselves after hearing about the ancient massage technique.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe group exchanged glances after seeing Sun Mo\u2019s back view.\u201cPfft haha!\u201dZhang Sheng couldn\u2019t help but break out laughing. \u201cIf a person isn\u2019t capable, then it\u2019d be useless even if they were to spend money.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Students came to seek guidance, but the teacher ran off, not giving a single word of guidance. This is such a joke.\u201d Yuan Feng gloated.\u201cHe\u2019s just full of trash, so how is he supposed to give them guidance?\u201d Zhang Sheng smirked, no longer feeling upset.\u201cHowever, this guy had spent a lot of money in order to stay in school. It probably costs a lot for him to look for so many students at once.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYuan Feng contemplated if he should also borrow money to build up his reputation.\u201cSun Mo looks quite handsome. If he were to sacrifice himself, there\u2019d definitely be people who would want to keep him.\u201dZhang Sheng stroked his chin and said in disdain, \u201cHe isn\u2019t even a teaching assistant, yet he wants to become a teacher? He\u2019s dreaming.\u201d\u201cSigh, these people are too shameless. They don\u2019t show the morals a teacher should have. I\u2019m the innocent one, relying on my own talent.\u201dLudi shook his head and looked at the pig trotter he was holding. He felt that so few people were as honest as he was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Teacher Sun couldn\u2019t have been angry, right?\u201dWang Hao was very worried. What would happen if Teacher Sun was angry and refused to give him a massage in the future?\u201cTeacher Sun isn\u2019t that kind of person, right?\u201dZhou Xu was uncertain as well. He was now regretting speaking too much yesterday.To a cultivator, advancing successfully was something worth celebrating. When Zhou Xu had gone back yesterday, he had called his friends out, reserved a private room at the Nature Lodge, and given them a treat. While there, he naturally mentioned Sun Mo because his Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands had been the one that allowed him to advance.Who didn\u2019t have a few friends? Everyone was curious and wanted to come and take a look. Therefore, Zhou Xu, being someone who liked to look good in front of others, brought everyone over early in the morning to meet Sun Mo.\u201cIsn\u2019t he just someone who lives off a woman? Why is he acting so high and lofty?\u201dSomeone felt displeased after being given the cold shoulder.\u201cHey, what do you mean that he lives off a woman? If you continue to talk about Teacher Sun in this manner, we might as well not continue being friends!\u201dZhou Xu was feeling worried if he had offended Sun Mo. Thus, when he heard what the guy was saying, he was infuriated and rebutted harshly.\u201cI\u2019m telling you that Teacher Sun\u2019s Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands is really amazing. When trained to the extreme, he\u2019d even be able to grab an ancient dragon, destroying its body and spirit.\u201dWang Hao boasted, \u201cIt\u2019s your loss that you guys aren\u2019t able to see it.\u201dSun Mo went downstairs to the canteen for his meal. He had slept early the night before and hadn\u2019t waited for midnight when the lucky treasure chest was refreshed. However, such a reward wouldn\u2019t disappear. It would be the same even if he were to open it in the morning.There wasn\u2019t any surprise. It was another tuft of soil.\u201cSystem, can I store these things aside and not have them in front of me all the time?\u201dSun Mo stretched his body. All the young men and ladies had already woken up and were practicing their martial techniques in the field, sweating it out. Some of them were under the shade of the trees, memorizing alchemy knowledge.\u201cIf you blink twice, you can summon out a storage cabinet. If you blink another time, the storage cabinet will disappear.\u201dSun Mo followed the system\u2019s hint and blinked twice. A black cube that measured one meter on each side floated in front of him. It was pitch-black like an inkstone. There were mysterious prints all over it, and it emitted a rustic and extravagant aura.Kacha!The chest was opened up, and there was a storage cabinet inside that could allow him to store items.Sun Mo drew out the wooden blade that emitted a sandalwood scent from his belt, attempting to put it in.\u201cThat isn\u2019t possible. The storage cabinet can only store items that come from the system.\u201dThe system explained.\u201cTsk!\u201dSun Mo was a little disappointed. He thought that he had obtained a spatial storage cabinet.After having his breakfast, Sun Mo went to the library and borrowed the Skywolf Fist manual. He then headed for the warehouse while he studied it. Not long later, Qi Shengjia came as well. If Sun Mo hadn\u2019t instructed him to rest well, he would have come here very early and waited.\u201cGo through the Skywolf Fist once!\u201dSun Mo instructed.Qi Shengjia didn\u2019t dare to be lax and after taking a few deep breaths, he started practicing the fist technique. He tried to ensure that each move was done perfectly.\u201cThe important thing about the Skywolf Fist is to be fast and smooth. What are you doing?\u201dSun Mo frowned.Given Sun Mo\u2019s outstanding comprehension, after reading it for a few times, he had a faint grasp of this technique. Its trait was that it could launch quick attacks, having a specialty in speed. The prowess of each of its attacks wasn\u2019t great, but the user could use it very quickly.Qi Shengjia lowered his head. In order not to make any mistakes, he naturally moved slowly.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of making mistakes. It\u2019s better for you to miss your target than to reduce your speed!\u201dSun Mo reprimanded, \u201cOne more time!\u201dAlthough Qi Shengjia was stupid, he listened to instructions and wouldn\u2019t complain. He started practicing seriously again. Sun Mo didn\u2019t say anything, so he continued practicing repeatedly.Sun Mo had received the memories of the original owner of this body. Although he was said to be sponging off a woman, he still had some capability. He could guide a student to cultivate a trashy earth-tier technique.\u201cNot fast enough!\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cForget about accuracy! Punch out faster!\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long for Qi Shengjia to be drenched in sweat. When Sun Mo told him to take a break, he sat down on the ground, panting vigorously.\u201cHave some water.\u201dSun Mo tossed over a deer-leather bottle.Gulp! Gulp!Qi Shengjia wiped his mouth after having a drink. He looked at Sun Mo\u2019s eyes and couldn\u2019t help but praise him, \u201cTeacher Sun Mo is really amazing. I feel that my practice of the Skywolf Fist is a lot smoother than usual.\u201dDing!+5 favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia. Current state, neutral (56/100)Sun Mo was stunned upon hearing the system\u2019s notification. He then shook his head. Qi Shengjia was really an honest person to be satisfied just because his practice was a lot smoother.What Sun Mo didn\u2019t know was that he had cured Qi Shengjia previously, allowing him to see hope when he was in a state of despair. Also, the effects of the Circulation Technique on Wang Hao and Zhou Xu were quite good. Hence, Qi Shengjia placed great trust in Sun Mo now. He felt that it was his great fortune to be able to receive Sun Mo\u2019s personal guidance.\u201cContinue after you\u2019re done resting.\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t satisfied. Did he think that he\u2019d be able to defeat his opponents and pass the battle hall\u2019s tests with just this bit of improvement? That would be wishful thinking.The Skywolf Fist wasn\u2019t complicated and only had 12 diagrams. After he memorized all of them, he started to practice it himself.Bang! Bang! Bang!He punched out like a great storm, waving his arms as fast wind as!Qi Shengjia glanced toward Sun Mo every now and then, and gradually couldn\u2019t turn his gaze away. In the end, he stopped his practice and looked at Sun Mo with great astonishment.Sun Mo\u2019s fist technique started off appearing stiff and immature, but soon became a lot more smooth and well-versed.\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026\u201dQi Shengjia stuttered. He was able to tell that Sun Mo\u2019s Skywolf Fist was extremely smooth even with his inferior skills. There was a flowy beauty when paired with his handsome face. It looked so much better than when he was practicing this technique.\u201cWhy is that so?\u201dQi Shengjia couldn\u2019t understand. He wasn\u2019t unfamiliar with the diagrams of the Skywolf Fist. It was because he had borrowed it from the library in the past. Looking at Sun Mo, it was clear that this was his first time reading about the Skywolf Fist, and his first time practicing it as well. No, that was impossible. One couldn\u2019t reach this stage when they were cultivating it for the first time.Sun Mo came to a stop, frowning as he went deep into thought.\u201cTeacher, is this the first time you\u2019re practicing this fist technique?\u201dQi Shengjia couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cEn!\u201dSun Mo replied, not paying it much heed. However, when Qi Shengjia heard that, he felt as if a ram that was used to break through city walls was smashed into his head, causing him to be stunned.Thereafter, an intense feeling of disappointment appeared on Qi Shengjia\u2019s face as he mumbled, \u201cI really don\u2019t have any talent.\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t see Qi Shengjia immerse in self-grieve. He suddenly had an idea and activated his Divine Sight to read the Skywolf Fist\u2019s diagrams.He hadn\u2019t expected that some data would appear.\u2018Bamboo paper, west mountain charcoal ink. Duration of book\u2019s completion, 15 years.\u2019These were the materials and ink source used to make the diagrams, as well as the time it had existed. However, what was important was the next bit of information.\u2018The crux of the Skywolf Fist is to be fast, channeling strength into the fingertips, but not exerting full force in the punches. There must be some energy kept in reserve, and the moves must be made smoothly. This is the essence of this fist technique.\u2019\u201cMy Divine Sight is really amazing.\u201dSun Mo was astonished. He had thought of some of these points, but having the Divine Sight listing all of them out made everything so clear. It was as if a fog that shrouded one\u2019s eyes had suddenly disappeared.\u201cQi Shengjia!\u201dSun Mo spoke up, feeling even more confident in himself.\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Qi Shengjia quickly replied.\u201cYou\u2019re exerting too much force!\u201d\u201cHuh? But this technique emphasizes a sharp and vicious disposition, so I need to punch out at full power. I had asked three teachers in the past and even sought guidance from a few seniors who also cultivate the Skywolf Fist. All of them said that I\u2019m supposed to launch every punch with rapid speed and at full power!\u201dQi Shengjia scratched his head, feeling confused. Could it be that Teacher Sun was mistaken? He was stupid, so he referred to the majority\u2019s opinions to assess if something was right or wrong. The side with more people would definitely be right.\u201cPunching out at full power means that your strength has to reach your fingertips and not just to your palms or arms. You also have to use the strength of your entire body.\u201dSun Mo walked up to Qi Shengjia and poked his chest with a finger. \u201cCan you feel it?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dQi Shengjia seemed to have understood something amidst the perplexity.\u201cOne more time!\u201dSun Mo instructed.Qi Shengjia did as he was told and discovered that his fist prowess became sharper and greater. He couldn\u2019t help but cry out in surprise, \u201cThis is really the case!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing that you\u2019ll have to take note of.\u201dSun Mo knocked Qi Shengjia\u2019s stomach. \u201cThe strength of your entire body is too fierce. Restrain some of it.\u201dQi Shengjia was unable to understand this.\u201cAlright, face the wall and charge over at full speed. Then, in the instant before you\u2019re about to bang into it, dodge.\u201dSun Mo changed his method of teaching.\u201cEn!\u201dQi Shengjia answered and then started to dash out. With a bang, he bumped into the wall and even broke his nose.\u201c\u2026\u201dSun Mo was speechless.\u201cTeacher?\u201dQi Shengjia rubbed his nose. \u201cDid I do it correctly?\u201d\u201cOne more time. This time around, hold back a bit of your strength. Dodge just before you\u2019re about to knock into the wall.\u201dSun Mo made a personal demonstration.Qi Shengjia did as he was told, but he still knocked into the wall. However, this time around, the impact was a lot lighter.\u201cDo you understand it now?\u201dAfter Sun Mo asked this, he saw Qi Shengjia shaking his head. For that moment, Sun Mo had the urge to draw out his wooden blade and split Qi Shengjia\u2019s head open. As expected of someone with low potential value. He was extremely slow.\u201cIn the two attempts of dodging, which was easier?\u201d\u201cThe second time!\u201dQi Shengjia was able to sense this.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Skywolf Fist seeks speed and continuity. However, when you perform each move with full power, there\u2019ll be a delay before you proceed with the next fist. You should reserve some strength. The essence of this fist technique isn\u2019t to perform it at full power, but to be continuous and fast.\u201dSun Mo backed off. \u201cOne more time!\u201dQi Shengjia continued to do as he was told, but he was so dense that Sun Mo had the urge to beat him.\u201cI must find a student with erupting potential value at the student recruitment meet.\u201dAlthough Sun Mo was complaining, he didn\u2019t like to give up. Since he had taken on this task, he was going to do his best.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAfter channeling your strength to your fingertips, punch out with 70% of your power.\u201dSun Mo instructed him again. Since Qi Shengjia was stupid, then Sun Mo should use a stupid way to teach him. He let Qi Shengjia slowly increase the amount of his strength until he reached the limits in which his flow wouldn\u2019t be affected.After practicing for 67 times, Qi Shengjia finally understood what Sun Mo meant. He also figured out how much strength he should use in his punches.\u201cTeacher, I think I understand it now.\u201dQi Shengjia was overjoyed. \u201cI feel that the prowess of my punches has increased. I want to head to the combat strength dojo to test it out!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15: Increase in Combat StrengthLordbluefireLordbluefireThe combat strength dojo was located at the south-side of the academy. It was roughly the size of a soccer field and mainly constructed from bricks. The roof was curled up beautifully, completing the dojo\u2019s visually stirring appearance of the eight trigrams and five elements.One had to climb up a flight of 36 steps to enter the combat strength dojo. After that, they would find 12 sites with a combat-strength bronze man in each of them.The combat-strength bronze men were 3 meters tall, and their entire bodies were forged with bronze. As they had been enduring the attacks of students all year round, wear and tear could be seen on certain parts of their bodies.These bronze men were forged from uncommon metal ingredients from the Darkness Continent, and their ability to endure damage was extremely strong. Also, after being attacked, there was a type of mysterious golden sand that would emit dazzling light in their stomach. The motes of light would then form into certain shapes.If the degree of damage caused to the bronze man was the same every time you hit it, the shape emitted from these grains of golden sand would also be the same.Using this characteristic, the Saint Gate collected a large amount of data, and each of the light forms was recorded down and corresponded to a certain value. Hence, the combat-strength bronze man could test the attack power of each cultivator.Although there was a difference, the margin of error was very small.\u201cIs this the black-technology of Middle Earth?\u201dAs he thought back to the information of the combat-strength bronze man, Sun Mo felt excited. In the nine continents, those who could create such items were known as mechanists. It was also a job that required quite a high IQ.\u201cTeacher, over here!\u201dBecause there weren\u2019t so many people, Qi Shengjia chose the first site on the left. After the people before him finished, he immediately displayed his Skywolf Fist, slamming his punches into the bronze man\u2019s head. He wanted to see just how much his combat strength had surged after his breakthrough!Bang!The bronze men didn\u2019t have legs. They were attached to a large metal plate and were buried ten meters below the earth. Hence, they were extremely stable.\u201cThe creator of these bronze men is definitely a pervert!\u201dSun Mo walked over as he mumbled. His gaze landed on the abdomen of one of the bronze men. The area was glowing and he could clearly see golden light flowing. A few seconds later, a special shape was formed, and it glowed before gradually dimming. And after about ten seconds, it reverted to its original shape.\u201cCombat strength of only 39? I didn\u2019t improve at all!\u201dQi Shengjia had a look of disappointment on his face. In the past, his score was 37, and that was when he was at the 3rd-level of the body refinement realm.The cultivation system had been developed since long ago and had experienced many modifications. Thus, the system could be considered very perfect now. Combat strength also had a publicly acknowledged standard.The combat strength of ordinary people was 5.The body refinement realm was split into nine levels. The lowest combat strength of someone at the 4th-level was 40, and the lowest combat strength of someone at the 5th-level was 50. So, in a similar fashion, the lowest combat strength of someone at the 9th-level was 90. If one\u2019s combat strength could break the 100 point, that would mean a pretty excellent result. It represented that the person\u2019s aptitude wasn\u2019t bad and that he was ready to try and break through to the spirit refinement realm.Naturally, these values weren\u2019t absolute and were for reference only. After all, geniuses were something that couldn\u2019t be evaluated normally. The numbers they hit would usually cause the eyeballs of people to explode in shock.Staring at the number Qi Shengjia achieved, Sun Mo\u2019s lips twitched a little. Forget it, this was the hole he dug himself. He could only stop his tears and jump down it.\u201cYou just broke through to the 4th-level and haven\u2019t stabilized your realm. It\u2019s normal for you to get this value!\u201dSun Mo consoled him.\u201cIs that so?\u201dQi Shengjia\u2019s expression became much more relaxed after hearing that.\u201cYes!\u201dSun Mo knew that some children who felt self-inferior needed to be praised. If not, their mental-states would worsen as they grew up. Actually, when one just broke through to the 4th-level, they should be able to achieve the lowest standard score of 40.\u201cI\u2019ll try punching again!\u201dQi Shengjia\u2019s expression was heavy. He breathed deeply for over a minute and when he felt that his state was at his best, he ferociously punched out.Bang!The combat-strength bronze man\u2019s lower abdomen shone. Golden sand flowed, weaving into a certain shape.\u201c40! I did it this time!\u201dQi Shengjia happily called out.HAHAHA!The few students at the side couldn\u2019t help but cover their mouths as their laughter rang out. The shape formed from the golden sand corresponded to a certain value. Everyone had long since memorized the corresponding values to the shapes. When they saw the shape that corresponded to the 40 point, a sense of superiority rose in their hearts.\u201cPreparing for a minute only to achieve the lowest value. How stupid!\u201dSome of the students were mumbling. They already heard Sun Mo\u2019s words. This lean-looking student just broke through to the 4th-level of the body refinement realm. When they were at the same level, their lowest result was 42, 43.\u201cTest out your combo!\u201dSun Mo merged with his original body\u2019s memories. When he thought back, he remembered the information of the combat bronze men. The bronze men could test the peak attack power of a cultivator, including the average attack value of a combo within one minute.For ordinary evenly-matched combat, it was impossible for one to defeat their enemies in a single blow. Hence, the average value of a continuous combo was then the true power of a cultivator.Qi Shengjia slowly exhaled. He used his full strength and unleashed the Skywolf Fist, blasting it into the body of the combat-strength bronze man.Bang! Bang! Bang!The bronze man didn\u2019t even sway slightly. On the contrary, when Qi Shengjia\u2019s cloth shoes stepped onto the surface, a cloud of dust and soil flew up from the impact.After Qi Shengjia finished, the abdomen area of the bronze man emitted golden light, and the motes of light gradually re-arranged themselves into a certain shape.\u201c39!\u201dQi Shengjia wanted to cry. He no longer dared to even look at Sun Mo.At this time, the few students in the surroundings did nothing to mask their laughter. Truly, his movements looked as fierce as a tiger, but he turned out to be trash!\u201cHow did I teach you earlier? Have you forgotten it so quickly?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s expression turned heavy as he berated. He didn\u2019t feel surprised by this result. The attack power of a combo would definitely be lesser than a single full-force punch.\u201cOh! Oh!\u201dQi Shengjia clapped his forehead. He hurriedly recalled Sun Mo\u2019s teaching.\u201cChannel your strength into your fingertips, gather your full power in your fist, but you must withhold a hint of power.\u201dQi Shengjia muttered as he punched out again.Bang! Bang! Bang!The bronze man let out a buzzing sound from the impact.\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same as before?\u201dThe few students at the side who were waiting to use the bronze man all felt that Qi Shengjia was wasting time when they saw his performance.\u201c41?\u201dQi Shengjia saw the shape of the light and involuntarily cried out in surprise. This number was much higher than he expected.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +20.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia: Neutral (76/100)!\u201cEh?\u201dThe students there were also stunned.\u201cWhat did he do? I feel that his punching form didn\u2019t change. Why is the result so much higher?\u201dIn the officially published standard, every increase of 1 in the attack value represented that one\u2019s attacking power had improved by quite a bit. It was very normal for someone to be stuck on the same attack value even after training for a few months.Hence, this wasn\u2019t as simple as an increase of 2 points. When converted into destructive might, it represented quite a large amount of increase. However, the key point was that this dumbo didn\u2019t seem to have done anything special.Sun Mo shook his head and urged, \u201cAgain!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dQi Shengjia might be dumb, but he had a good point and that was that he was very obedient. He concentrated his attention completely and launched his strikes. In the end, the value was 41.\u201cContinue!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t call for him to stop. Qi Shengjia simply continued attacking.There were a total of 12 combat-strength bronze men in the combat strength dojo. There were empty slots, but the students who were waiting here didn\u2019t leave. All of them stood at their original location and waited because none of them understood the reason for the increase in Qi Shengjia\u2019s combat strength.Although the value fluctuated, the overall trend was increasing. The last attack value he got was fixed at 44.\u201cIs this a joke?\u201dThere was a student who subconsciously called out in disbelief. One could tell that this docile-looking student, Qi Shengjia, was someone ranked at the bottom of his class with just a look. How did he manage to do that?Other people didn\u2019t say anything. They stared at the abdomen of the combat-strength bronze man and thought that their vision might be blurry.\u201cTeacher, your guidance is really correct!\u201dQi Shengjia had a look of worship on his face as he looked at Sun Mo. Tears flashed in his eyes. A combat strength of 44 wasn\u2019t bad. For the entrance test of the battle hall this time around, he would at least have a 50% chance of passing.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +32.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia: Friendly (108/1000)\u201cTeacher?\u201dUpon hearing this title, the students around immediately turned to look at Sun Mo.\u201cSo young, I\u2019ve never seen him before. He should be an intern teacher, right?\u201d\u201cHe seemed to be quite capable?\u201d\u201cShould we seek his guidance?\u201dThe few students mumbled. All of a sudden, they heard a clamor that grew increasingly louder. Turning their heads, they saw many students rushing toward the entrance.\u201cWhich great teacher is here?\u201dThe loud-mouthed student\u2019s spirit stirred. He immediately rushed over, and his other comrades weren\u2019t willing to lag behind. In this situation, even if they couldn\u2019t receive any guidance from that great teacher, it would still be of help if they could listen to the advice the great teacher was giving others.Qi Shengjia stood on tiptoe and was looking over as well. However, he was embarrassed to leave just like that since Sun Mo was beside him.Sun Mo didn\u2019t notice this because the system\u2019s notifications were still not over.Congratulations. Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia reached \u2018friendly\u2019. Reward: 1 lucky treasure chest. Please continue to work hard.Congratulations. On the journey to become a great teacher, this is the first \u2018friendly\u2019 student you gained. Reward: 1 lucky treasure chest.Note: You are advancing through the path of Great Teachers. Continue your great work!\u201cHey, what\u2019s above \u2018friendly\u2019?\u201dSun Mo asked.\u201cPrestige connection can be divided into six levels. They are cold, neutral, friendly, respect, reverence, and worship respectively. As long as the prestige connection of a target isn\u2019t unlocked, the state would always be \u2018cold\u2019.\u201dThe system\u2019s explanation was simple to understand.\u201cIs \u2018worship\u2019 the highest level? What benefits would I get if I maxed it out?\u201dSun Mo was very curious.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a guess?\u201d the system counter-asked.\u201cCome on out, I promise not to beat you to death!\u201dSun Mo cracked his fingers.\u201cFor every increase in prestige level, the favorable impression points needed would be 10 times the previous one.\u201dThe system\u2019s voice was like a bucket of cold water. It wasn\u2019t that easy to gather so many points.\u201cTeacher, It\u2019s Teacher Gu!\u201dQi Shengjia tugged Sun Mo\u2019s sleeves, feeling a little agitated.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWho?\u201dSun Mo frowned. He originally planned to open his lucky treasure chests after some prayers. But now that he was distracted by Qi Shengjia, he felt that his luck had been \u2018broken\u2019.Lottery draws were a metaphysical thing. There was no need to care if it was effective or not, Sun Mo would just pray first and hope for the best.\u201cGu Xiuxun! A top graduate of the Myriad Daos Academy. It\u2019s said that she is still the campus queen from her batch,\u201d Qi Shengjia replied.Sun Mo inclined his head and saw Gu Xiuxun directly walking over. Beside her, Zhang Sheng was smiling. It was unknown what he was saying, but Zhang Sheng was pointing toward him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16: Honor GraduateLordbluefireLordbluefireGu Xiuxun was extremely famous in the Myriad Daos Academy, as she was the honor graduate of this year. This also meant that out of the 2,000 graduates from the 18th batch, she was their top genius.Given Gu Xiuxun\u2019s aptitude and achievement, it had long since been decided that she would join the faculty. She was someone whom An Xinhui had personally paid a visit to and spent a huge amount of money to recruit over.In Jinling City, even a three-year-old child knew that the Central Province Academy and Myriad Daos Academy were arch-enemies. This move by An Xinhui had greatly dulled the sharpness of the Myriad Daos Academy. It also allowed the Central Province Academy that had always been suppressed to feel exaltation.Someone cursed Gu Xiuxun for being a traitor. Others cursed her for being a white-eyed wolf that only saw money and had forgotten the school that had nurtured her. However, the fiercer the curses and scoldings, the more it proved that the Myriad Daos Academy couldn\u2019t endure the pain. Their losses were extremely huge.With the halo of the honor graduate, Gu Xiuxun would naturally attract the full attention of everyone when she came to the Central Province Academy. Naturally, her graceful bearing also caused those who saw her to praise that \u2018An Xinhui had benefitted\u2019.Gu Xiuxun, who was 19, was now at the most beautiful time of her life. However, because she matured early, the puerile look on her face had faded, and a steady maturity replaced it.Gu Xiuxun didn\u2019t laugh, and her mouth was always pressed together into a thin line. This was a minor trick she used to maintain her teacher\u2019s prestige.\u201cHow beautiful!\u201dThe crowd was mumbling to each other incessantly. There were even some guy students who hurriedly ran to a combat-strength bronze man and took out their most serious attitude as they hit it. They hoped their results could be seen by Gu Xiuxun, and she would accept them as her personal disciple.Gu Xiuxun\u2019s figure wasn\u2019t tall. But because she was more on the slim side, she appeared taller than guys with ordinary height.She was clad in the school\u2019s long robe for intern teachers. The style was old and rigid, but Gu Xiuxun evidently made some changes to that. The robes covering her chest and waist area had some additional folds, which made her figure appear even more lithe and graceful.\u201cIs there something wrong with the food in Tang Country?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. She was yet another sunny-side-up. (small br*asts)\u201cSun Mo, in order to join the faculty, you are truly unscrupulous!\u201dZhang Sheng spoke. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he still had some rationale and knew some words shouldn\u2019t be said, he really wanted to ask how much did Sun Mo spend to hire all these actors.However, Sun Mo\u2019s brain was really good. Not only did he hire actors, but he even came to a place like the combat strength dojo to act. By doing so, his fame would certainly spread.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of this?\u2019Zhang Sheng felt vexed in his heart. He had always flaunted himself as someone whose intelligence was off-the-charts. But for this matter, he completely couldn\u2019t compare with Sun Mo.\u201cBut it\u2019s fine. My intellect is used on the correct path. Sun Mo likes to play all these minor tricks so much; he would be out of luck sooner or later.\u201dZhang Sheng consoled himself. When he glanced at Sun Mo again, his eyes shifted a little and exuded a thick sense of superiority.Gu Xiuxun furrowed her brows. As a top student, her IQ and EQ wasn\u2019t low. By thinking a little, she understood the meaning of Zhang Sheng\u2019s words.In truth, Gu Xiuxun had no interest in these intern teachers. Other than Qin Fen and the other graduates from the nine famous schools, no one could catch her attention, including Zhang Sheng who kept trying to bootlick her. But when she heard the name \u2018Sun Mo\u2019, she still subconsciously cast a glance over.\u201cSo that is Headmaster An\u2019s fiance?\u201dGu Xiuxun surveyed Sun Mo and discovered that he was looking at her as well. But that was nothing strange. Through these many years, as an honor graduate with both beauty and ability, she was used to being in such a situation.\u201cIn any case, even if he took a few more glances at me, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see my ability.\u201dGu Xiuxun was very calm.\u201cShe has an extremely high potential value? How awesome, An Xinhui\u2019s judgment is really accurate.\u201dSun Mo had long since activated Divine Sight and was staring at the data floating from Gu Xiuxun\u2019s body. It was truly a sight that delighted the eye.Strength: 26. Above-average.Intellect: 27. Extremely rare, not even one in ten thousand. Your intellect can crush the vast majority of people.Agility: 28. Fast speed, when you run, many people are left behind in your dust.Will: 25. Average stat, there\u2019s room for improvement.Endurance: 22. Your only shortcoming.\u2026Sun Mo read through everything, and the last part was the note from the system. \u2018As a sunny-side-up girl, although you no longer have room for growth, you should feel happy as you are not a steelplate girl. (flat)\u2019\u201cSteelplate girl?\u201dSun Mo laughed. \u201cSystem, what\u2019s going on with these stats?\u201d\u201cAn ordinary adult male would have 5 points in every stat respectively. Those at the body refinement realm would have 10 points per stat, spirit refinement realm would have 20 points per stat, and the limit of blood-ignition realm would be 30 per stat.\u201dThe system explained.\u201cAs you cultivate, the cultivator\u2019s various stats would gradually rise. If not, why would cultivators be immune to a hundred diseases and gain increased longevity?\u201d\u201cThe limit is 30? In that case, the stat values of this Gu Xiuxun can be considered really outstanding!\u201dSun Mo clicked his tongue.\u201cSeems like there are some mistakes in your understanding of the term \u2018outstanding\u2019.\u201d The system corrected, \u201cThe word \u2018outstanding\u2019 isn\u2019t worthy to be used on this girl!\u201d\u201cHow are my stats? Why can\u2019t I see them?\u201dSun Mo had tried using Divine Sight on his reflection in the mirror, wanting to see his stats. However, the stats displayed were of an unknown value.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for the host to check his own stats.\u201dThe system explained.\u201cOi, have you seen enough? It\u2019s very rude to act like this!\u201dSeeing Sun Mo keep staring at Gu Xiuxun, Zhang Sheng took a step forward and blocked his line of view.Sun Mo leaned to the side and continued staring. Because at the thigh area of Gu Xiuxun, another note appeared.\u201cWhen this spot is stimulated by an ache or pain, it will generate excitement.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dUpon seeing this data, Sun Mo started. Was this the legendary \u2018M\u2019 type? He didn\u2019t expect that he would meet someone like this in real life.Gu Xiuxun\u2019s beautiful brows furrowed. Given her personality, she would never dodge any gazes directed at her. But when their gazes met and she saw his large, clearly defined eyes, her heart pounded rapidly all of sudden, and she subconsciously averted her gaze.His eyes seemed as though they could see through the hearts of people. Gu Xiuxun felt as if all her deepest secrets had been discovered.\u201cHehe, I actually evade his gaze?\u201dGu Xiuxun gave herself a self-mocking laugh.\u201cOi, are you done or not?\u201dZhang Sheng grew unhappy. He stretched out his hand to push Sun Mo feeling, as though the rice at his home had been stolen by someone.Sun Mo didn\u2019t retreat. His right hand grabbed hold of the black sandalwood blade on his waist.\u201cTeachers, please calm down!\u201dA docile male student with large ears followed beside Gu Xiuxun. Upon seeing this, he immediately took a step forward and blocked the space between the two of them.Zhang Yanzong had a smile across his face, and no one would feel any malice from him.\u201cHmph, if I hit him, I\u2019m afraid he might die from my blow!\u201dZhang Sheng was filled with disdain.\u201cZhang Yanzong, go and hit the combat-strength bronze man and start the test!\u201dGu Xiuxun instructed. As for the scenes of men fighting because of her, she had seen too many of such things.\u201cSun Mo, did you pay this student to be an actor? How much did you spend?\u201d Zhang Sheng mocked. He originally didn\u2019t wish to expose Sun Mo, but his goddess was just beside him. He had to win beautifully.\u201cI\u2019m sorry then, you can only become my stepping stone!\u201dZhang Sheng\u2019s gaze was filled with superiority like he was looking at an ant that he was about to trample.Because of these words, people in the surroundings started whispering.\u201cTeacher Zhang, don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201dQi Shengjia was badly frightened and hurriedly sought to clear their names. If this matter was believed by everyone and became the truth, not only would Sun Mo be affected, but Qi Shengjia would also be expelled.Gu Xiuxun\u2019s brows furrowed again. Her impression of Zhang Sheng wasn\u2019t too good. Although this was a possibility, there was no evidence whatsoever. Slandering Sun Mo in public would undoubtedly damage his reputation.\u201cToday, seven students were waiting for you outside our dorm early in the morning, sincerely begging you to guide them. As an intern teacher, you are truly very awesome. You are almost at the level of Qin Fen and Gu Xiuxun,\u201d Zhang Sheng mocked.\u201cIs his brain too dumb or what? Even if he is getting them to put on an act, isn\u2019t that a little too exaggerated?\u201dGu Xiuxun mumbled silently to herself.She believed that she had done her job as a teaching assistant well, but it wasn\u2019t that well to the extent that there would be seven students coming to her door early in the morning to seek her guidance.Upon noticing Gu Xiuxun\u2019s expression, Zhang Sheng became even more complacent. His brain spun rapidly and searched for loopholes to attack Sun Mo. He then glanced at a familiar-looking student. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cQi\u2026Qi Shengjia!\u201dQi Shengjia was very nervous, and this was especially so given that he was standing beside Gu Xiuxun. This was something he had never once dared to imagine. As he smelled the fragrance from the beautiful intern teacher, his thoughts were in a whirl and sweat flowed down his back.\u201cThis is the honor graduate of this year from the Myriad Daos Academy, a true top student. If you have any questions, you can seek guidance from her.\u201dZhang Sheng knew how to act in such a situation. Not only did he strike at Sun Mo, but he also created a chance for Gu Xiuxun to display her abilities.\u201cAh?\u201dQi Shengjia started as he glanced at Gu Xiuxun. In terms of martial arts, he truly had many questions. However, after his mouth opened and closed a few times, he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Teacher Sun Mo has already answered my questions for me.\u201dWhispering sounds rang out~Many people were hissing in displeasure. In their eyes, Gu Xiuxun was overflowing with talent and had a beautiful appearance. She was simply a goddess. They would naturally choose to stand with her.Seeing that Qi Shengjia was not seeking guidance, wasn\u2019t this a case of giving someone face but that person didn\u2019t want any? No matter how anyone looked at it, Sun Mo was simply inferior to Gu Xiuxun!\u201cYou are his personal disciple?\u201dZhang Mo ridiculed. \u201cIf you are, there\u2019s basically no need to seek other teachers out for their opinions as this would be disrespectful to your teacher.\u201d\u201cThis student is too stupid. I\u2019m not worthy to be Teacher Sun\u2019s personal disciple!\u201dQi Shengjia lowered his head and had a downcast expression. He knew he was stupid; hence, he had thought about this before but he hadn\u2019t dared to speak up and ask Sun Mo to accept him as a personal disciple.\u201cHehe, Sun Mo. You didn\u2019t waste your money indeed.\u201dZhang Sheng\u2019s words left the rest for the audience to infer. But the acting skills of this person named Qi Shengjia was not bad.\u201cStop your nonsense!\u201dGu Xiuxun put a stop to this; she looked down on Zhang Sheng for many things. As for Qi Shengjia\u2019s reply, she basically didn\u2019t put it in her heart. He was just an actor, if not, when given a rare chance to consult with someone like her for guidance, how could ordinary people give it up?She still had this bit of confidence. Hence, when she glanced at Sun Mo, Gu Xiuxun\u2019s gaze became filled with some loathing.\u201cHeadmaster An is such a perfect woman. Even if she had no choice and had to marry someone, she wouldn\u2019t have chosen a scheming person like him who likes to play minor tricks, right?\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t rebut, you are really going to climb over my head, right?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo coldly laughed as he glanced at Zhang Yanzong before turning to Zhang Sheng. \u201cDidn\u2019t you self-proclaim to be overflowing with talent, and you will become a great teacher within a year? Tell me then, what\u2019s the problem with this student\u2019s fist technique?\u201d\u201cTesting me?\u201dZhang Sheng sneered. \u201cOpen your dog-eyes wide. The fist technique he is executing is called the Thunderclap Fist. Each of his movements is as fast as a thunderbolt, creating sonic booms. This is the sign of the major-completion stage of the Thunderclap Fist. You actually asked me what\u2019s his problem? Tell me, are you retarded or what?\u201d\u201cHe has an old injury on his right arm.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s manner of speaking was neither hurried nor slow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yet, you said that his right arm had an injury?\u201d\u201cYes, there\u2019s an injury.\u201dSun Mo was sure. Through the Divine Sight, he saw a row of data from Zhang Yanzong\u2019s right arm, and it indicated that his muscles were slightly strained due to an injury.\u201cHehe, ignorant!\u201dZhang Sheng sneered, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to reply. He glanced at Zhang Yanzong. Whether there was an injury or not, he just needed to get the person in question to reply, this was the most persuasive method.(Sun Mo definitely will lose all his face here. Finding actors to boost his reputation? I\u2019m going to destroy your reputation completely!)Zhang Sheng felt joy in his heart. A guy who lived off a woman, if such a person was scolded by him, that person should simply be prepared to be castigated. However, Sun Mo even dared to rebut? He truly didn\u2019t know how to write the word \u2018death\u2019!Zhang Yanzong, who had been smiling all this while, froze. His smile stiffened upon hearing the word \u2018injury\u2019 as he glanced at Gu Xiuxun.Gu Xiuxun\u2019s red lips were slightly parted as she stared with astonishment at Sun Mo. Zhang Yaozong\u2019s training load had always been very great. Last week, something had finally happened. He had pulled his muscles and sprained his arm. She even reprimanded him because of this, and this matter was only known by her.\u201cMn?\u201dZhang Sheng wasn\u2019t a fool, when he saw Zhang Yaozong\u2019s silence, he suddenly felt uneasy. Just when he was thinking about how to save himself, Sun Mo who had a \u2018poisonous tongue\u2019 started his attack.\u201cYou have a muscle pull on your right arm. However, it isn\u2019t simply due to your large training load; there\u2019s also an old injury.\u201dSun Mo calmly looked at Zhang Yaozong and spotted another stream of data.\u201cHow do you know this?\u201dZhang Yaozong called out, a look of astonishment on his face. He didn\u2019t even mention this to Gu Xiuxun.When his words came out, everyone here was in an uproar. Zhang Yaozong only hit the combat-strength bronze man, and Sun Mo could already tell that he had an injury. How powerful must his judgment be?\u201d\u201cYou definitely must have guessed it!\u201d Zhang Sheng coldly snorted, \u201cYour desire to survive is very strong!\u201dZhang Yaozong felt that Zhang Sheng was correct. If Sun Mo couldn\u2019t clean his name, his reputation would be ruined. Hence, he had to think of a solution to retaliate.\u201cZhang Sheng, enough.\u201dGu Xiuxun\u2019s voice was clear and cold. She felt Zhang Sheng was too overbearing.Zhang Sheng\u2019s lips twitched when he heard that. He wanted to curse, \u201cYou are someone full who doesn\u2019t know the feeling of hunger!\u201d For this year, a total of 216 intern teachers came to the Central Province Academy. But in the end, An Xinhui would only select 15 at most!Gu Xiuxun already had a slot because An Xinhui had personally spent a huge amount of money to recruit her. Qin Fen, Zhang Lan, Gao Ben were graduates from the nine famous schools, and they would also join the faculty for sure. This meant that the remaining people out of the 216 intern teachers had to fight for 11 slots. This was an odds close to 20:1.Although Zhang Sheng was arrogant, he didn\u2019t feel that with his strength alone, he could secure a slot. When he thought about not being able to join the faculty, he would feel jealous of Sun Mo.Most of them graduated from Songyang Academy, and thus Zhang Sheng knew that Sun Mo was far inferior when compared to him. But because Sun Mo had a fiancee like An Xinhui, if there were no unexpected incidents, it could almost be guaranteed that he could join the faculty.\u201cWhat does he have? His handsome face? Or just because he is childhood sweethearts with An Xinhui?\u201dDuring the private chats among intern teachers, many of them would mock Sun Mo. Thus, when they saw him being tossed into the logistics department by the vice headmaster Zhang Han, all of them were so happy that they wanted to clap and dance.Although the intern teachers were staying in the same dorm building, it didn\u2019t mean that they would move, eat, and have fun together. In everyone\u2019s heart, each of them was hiding a ruthless aura, preparing to trample on the others. This was because all of them were competitors.If they could obtain a slot and remain in the school, their future life would be bright. Those who were eliminated could only seek out other schools and hope to be employed. But after missing out on the graduate period, they would have to wait until next year before the other schools would hire intern teachers.\u201cLife is so difficult!\u201dWhen he thought of this, Zhang Sheng felt a multitude of emotions in his heart. This was the life of ordinary graduates. It was filled with competition, and things were different for graduates from famous schools. Even before those people graduated, many schools would use a high salary to headhunt them.Sun Mo could deduce the reason why Zhang Sheng was targeting him. Back then when he was employed, he also passed through a series of tests. In the same batch, there was an extremely unlucky fellow. That fellow also passed the test, but because the slots for intern teachers suddenly got reduced by one, that unlucky fellow, who had the worst results, were eventually dropped.It was inevitable. Zhang Sheng had a father that possessed authority and status. He was just so impressive to the point of being able to bend the rules and allow his son to get one spot.Back then, Sun Mo also envied him. He didn\u2019t expect that right now, he was the one being envied instead.\u201cWait, something is wrong. I\u2019m not confirmed to join the faculty yet. During these few days, An Xinhui also didn\u2019t meet with me. Besides, there are plenty of people among the higher-ups that are planning to deal with me to suppress An Xinhui.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s situation was actually very bad. This was why the logistics department head could instruct Li Gong to find a chance to kick Sun Mo out of the school.\u201cHmph, a \u2018soft-rice\u2019 guy with no capabilities. It\u2019s shameful to even talk with him!\u201dZhang Sheng grumbled. After hearing Gu Xiuxun\u2019s words, he didn\u2019t dare to annoy her. He then put on an expression \u2018I can\u2019t be bothered with you\u2019 when he looked at Sun Mo.\u201cHehe, Zhang Sheng. This student has an injury on his right arm. When he displayed the Thunderclap Fist, he could only display 90% of its effects, yet you are still bragging? Are you blind?\u201d Sun Mo mocked, \u201cIf you want to join the faculty, make sure you learn well and improve your ability as a teaching assistant. Stop being a bootlicker who licks the smelly feet of women.\u201d\u201cWho did you say was a bootlicker?\u201dZhang Sheng glared at Sun Mo. His eyes protruded out slightly due to rage, resembling large grapes. Sun Mo\u2019s manner was like an elder teaching a junior a lesson. What capabilities did he have to do this?Gu Xiuxun\u2019s expression stiffened. Her feet that were hidden in her cloth shoes subconsciously scratched the ground. She knew Sun Mo wasn\u2019t referring to her specifically when he spoke about smelly feet, but she still felt uncomfortable hearing that.\u201cRegardless of talent or capabilities, the current you is inferior to Gu Xiuxun in everything.\u201d Sun Mo laughed lightly. \u201cStop putting on the face of a bootlicker, she would only look down on you even more.\u201d\u201cCould it be that you think you are worthy?\u201d Zhang Sheng roared. He sneakily cast a worried glance at Gu Xiuxun and saw a hint of pride in the center of her brows. She didn\u2019t seem to have any intentions of saying words in his defense.For such a proud woman like Gu Xiuxun, she would only look for more outstanding men.\u201cBut I\u2019m not wooing her?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips twitched as he shrugged.\u201cAh?\u201dZhang Sheng was stunned, and his face turned red. In the end, his heart became filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred.That was true, why would Sun Mo want to woo Gu Xiuxun? His fiancee was An Xinhui, a genius from the Heavenly Mystery Academy that was rarely seen even in a hundred years. She was also an honor graduate and a 3-star great teacher. As an undisputed campus queen of her year, someone ranked #7 on the Devastating Beauty Rankings, she was publicly acknowledged as a great beauty by many schools in the nine provinces.Regardless of talent, beauty, fame, or prestige, Gu Xiuxun and An Xinhui weren\u2019t on the same level.Gu Xiuxun\u2019s expression turned unsightly, and she cast a deep glance at Sun Mo. This fellow\u2019s tongue wasn\u2019t just poisonous, he would also seek revenge for the slightest grievance, not willing to suffer the slightest loss.When Sun Mo walked past Zhang Sheng, he stopped to pat his shoulder and spoke in a heavy tone as though trying to persuade Zhang Sheng. \u201cPromise me. As a man, you shouldn\u2019t be a bootlicker, alright?\u201dPu!Many students, who were watching the show, involuntarily laughed when they heard this. A minority of them showed dim looks of sorrow. After all, some also silently admired this goddess Gu Xiuxun in their hearts and wanted to woo her.\u201cTeacher is so toxic!\u201dQi Shengjia sighed in admiration and hurriedly followed behind Sun Mo.Zhang Sheng clenched his fist tightly, and his bones let out creaking sounds. He really felt like punching Sun Mo to death, but he didn\u2019t dare to. Once they fought in front of so many students, it would create negative influence and they had an 80% to 90% chance of being fired.\u201cZhang Yaozong, let\u2019s go!\u201dGu Xiuxun called out as she headed to a corner.\u201cXiuxun!\u201dZhang Sheng hurriedly called out, wanting to gain back some favorable impression.Gu Xiuxun completely ignored him.\u201cXiuxun! Xiuxun!\u201dZhang Sheng panicked and chased after her.\u201cEnough. Don\u2019t call me Xiuxun. Are we that familiar with each other?\u201d Gu Xiuxun turned her head and berated him.\u2026\u201cHehe, how tragic!\u201d\u201cSigh, he can\u2019t even suppress a \u2018soft-rice\u2019 guy. Seems like Zhang Sheng\u2019s capabilities are just like that!\u201d\u201cWhat is his name? Zhang Sheng? I can tell he doesn\u2019t have the fate of being a great teacher just by hearing his name!\u201dZhang Sheng saw the cold look in Gu Xiuxun\u2019s eyes and froze on the spot. The whispers and mumblings of the students also entered his ears; all of them were negative. He could no longer endure it and hurriedly covered his mouth with his hands.Pu!Zhang Sheng was so angered that he coughed out a mouthful of blood.\u201cSun Mo, I\u2019ll remember this grudge. I\u2019ll definitely destroy your reputation. You want to marry An Xinhui! Just go and continue dreaming!\u201dHis mouth was filled with the smell of blood. This caused Zhang Sheng to hate Sun Mo even more.Sun Mo naturally also had no thoughts of sparing Zhang Sheng. This fellow publicly said that he hired actors to boost his own reputation. This action of his was simply filled with malicious intent. If this circulated out, it would surely affect his reputation.One must know that let alone a great teacher, just an ordinary teacher would also treasure their reputation. After all, no schools would want to hire a teacher with a bad reputation.In the combat strength dojo, the students did their utmost as they hit the bronze men, hoping their efforts would be seen by Gu Xiuxun. Sadly, her attention wasn\u2019t focused on them.\u201cZhang Yaozong, what do you think? Did he really manage to see that there\u2019s an injury in your right arm?\u201dAs someone who knew about this, Gu Xiuxin could naturally tell that Zhang Yaozong had been holding some strength back with his right arm when he had displayed the Thunderclap Fist earlier.\u201cBefore I hit the bronze man, I rubbed my right wrist. He might have seen it.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Yaozong analyzed. \u201cBased on that, he should have come to the judgment that I have an injury. If not, he must have guessed it randomly.\u201dGu Xiuxun fell silent. She recalled the exchange between Sun Mo and Zhang Sheng in her mind. She discovered that from the beginning to the end, Sun Mo was incomparably calm. Even when Zhang Sheng had accused him of finding actors, others would surely be extremely defensive, but Sun Mo didn\u2019t. His unperturbed attitude was truly unexpected.\u201cBut his tongue is very poisonous. Hmm, hinting that my feet are smelly? Next time I\u2019ll stuff my feet into his mouth.\u201dGu Xiuxun\u2019s ruby lips twitched, and she decided not to think about this temporarily. Her opponents were Qin Fen and the two others from the famous schools, as well as the unfathomable higher-ups of the school. As she wanted to help Headmaster An to safeguard this school, any other matters were not a priority for her.Next would be the entry test for the battle hall, and she had to amaze everyone with a single brilliant feat. With Zhang Yaozong\u2019s talent, in addition to her guidance for him, there shouldn\u2019t be any unexpected incidents.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hence, he would wake up earlier and head to the canteen to have breakfast before the peak period.\u201cI\u2019ll get some steamed dumplings and one porridge for takeaway. I don\u2019t want the salted veggies.\u201dSun Mo calculated the money he had in his pocket. Although it wasn\u2019t healthy to eat meat in the morning, the steamed dumplings of the canteen were extremely delicious.After moving out of the dorm building, he went onto a path leading to the sports field. He could see many intern teachers finishing their morning practice, and they were currently on their way back.Due to the competitive nature of their current situation, it seemed as though there were no mutual greetings among them. Their gazes were filled with disregard for each other.\u201cTeacher Sun!\u201dSun Mo heard someone addressing him with an honorific, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel astonished. When he glanced toward the voice, he saw a young girl with exquisite features standing below a maple tree at the side.\u201cOh, it\u2019s you?\u201dSun Mo felt a little surprised. The young girl wore men\u2019s clothes that were tailored fit for her. However, her fair skin, her gentle-looking exquisite features, her slender figure\u2026Everyone could tell that she was a girl with just a glance.This girl was none other than Li Ziqi, the person who had wanted to save him but ended up almost drowning herself. The system had also issued a mission, wanting Sun Mo to accept her as his student.\u201cTeacher Sun!\u201dLi Ziqi smiled sweetly. Her eyes, where the shades of white and black were clearly distinct, immediately curved into shapes of the crescent moon. However, just as she jogged over, her feet tripped on a flagstone after a few steps.Pak!Li Ziqi was like a frying pan as she fell and slammed into the limestone slab.\u201cAre you alright?\u201dSun Mo was badly frightened. He hurried over to help her up, but he soon stopped. Li Ziqi had directly covered her head with her arms and curled into a ball.\u201cBoohoo, I lost face again. Why am I so stupid?\u201dLi Ziqi really wanted to find a hole and hide in it.\u201cBecause of your kindness, this ant can continue to admire the scenery of this world.\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t go to help her up. Instead, he squatted at the side and was staring at an ant that was passing by.\u201cEh?\u201dLi Ziqi started.\u201cYou really are a kind girl!\u201dSun Mo smiled, he picked that ant up and showed it to her.\u201cEh?\u201dLi Ziqi was still in a daze, but she soon understood. Sun Mo thought that she fell down on purpose in order to avoid stepping on the ant. Aiya, she turned from a stupid girl into a kind girl in an instant. After managing to save her face, happiness bloomed in Li Ziqi\u2019s heart.\u201cNo one has ever treated me like this!\u201dLi Ziqi felt very strange. In the past when she fell down, her servants, guards, and aunties would be extremely frightened and hurry over to console her. But today, this was the first time she had a different experience.By saying such words, she didn\u2019t feel the embarrassment she had felt in the past. Instead, she even felt a little joyful.\u201cHave you eaten yet?\u201dSun Mo put the ant down and passed over a handkerchief.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve eaten.\u201dLi Ziqi took the handkerchief, slightly started. Only then did she realize that the area above her mouth was wet. Evidently, the skin of her nose was grazed a little, and there was fresh blood flowing down. She hurriedly wiped the blood away with the handkerchief.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t narcissistic enough to believe that she was here to look for him.\u201cThe student recruitment meet will begin three days later, and the battle hall\u2019s test is today. Hence, I came earlier to take a look.\u201dLi Ziqi glanced at the blood on the handkerchief and she blushed. \u201cI\u2019ll return it to you after I wash it clean!\u201d\u2026The battle hall of the Central Province Academy was pretty famous in Jinling City. The students in there were all experts who were proficient in combat.If there were students who wished to have some attainments in martial arts, there was no mistake if they chose to join here.\u201cThere are so many people!\u201dLi Ziqi saw many students gathered outside the battle hall. She was involuntarily speechless. \u201cAre they all challengers?\u201d\u201cYup!\u201dSun Mo was searching for Qi Shengjia\u2019s silhouette. Some of these students were praying, some were using the time to warm up, some had faces filled with confidence, and some were chatting idly with the people beside them.The fame of the battle hall was too great. Hence, for the entry test held once every three months, the number of participants would be filled to the brim. In fact, there had been situations where some members of the battle hall had to have three or four fights in a day. In order to avoid such a situation, the hall leader of the battle hall set a rule. And that was, if a challenger failed his challenge, he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to issue another challenge for the next test. He had to wait half a year later.This was Qi Shengjia\u2019s last chance. Even though his father didn\u2019t complain about the fees, Qi Shengjia would quit school if he failed to join the battle hall this time.The school fees were simply too expensive. If he didn\u2019t improve, he would truly not have any face to stay here.At eight sharp, the sound of drums echoed out.BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!All the students gathered before the battle hall fell into silence. They inclined their heads and stared in the direction of the entrance.A young man with a height close to two meters stood there. He was like an iron pagoda and was proclaiming in a bright and clear voice.\u201cAll challengers, line up before the entrance. After that, proceed with drawing lots. You will enter the competition based on the number you drew. If you missed your number when it\u2019s called out, it will be considered that you have decided to give up.\u201dAfter the students immediately surged forward like a hive of bees when they heard it. All of them wanted to snatch a good position.\u201cSilence. Anyone who still jostles and creates a commotion will have their qualification of challenge removed.\u201dThe young man berated. His voice wasn\u2019t loud, but it was like a clap of thunder, ringing out loud in the ears of everyone.The students immediately got into rows obediently. This person who spoke was Zhu Ting, someone that was ranked #5 in the battle hall. He was extremely impartial and followed the rules of the school religiously. Since he said words like removing one\u2019s qualification of challenge, it meant that he would do that.Everyone didn\u2019t wish to lose their qualifications just by snatching a good spot. That would be too tragic.Once everyone was organized into neat rows, the efficiency became much faster. The students walked to a large metal box and put their hands into it to draw a lot.\u201cMay the heavens bless me!\u201dZhu Ting immediately cursed at them.\u201cThe heavens won\u2019t bless you. Your own hard work is the only thing you can depend on. If you are not confident, just scram now. Don\u2019t waste everyone\u2019s time.\u201dZhu Ting continued, \u201cAlso, for the rest of you. I want you to move quicker. Do you all think the box is a woman? Why are you putting your hands inside it for so long?\u201dZhu Ting\u2019s words were funny, but not a single student dared to laugh.Everyone no longer dared to delay and drew out a wooden plate from the box. In fact, they didn\u2019t even have time to see the number on their lots and hurriedly left to make space for the next participants.\u201cThe rest will draw lots tomorrow!\u201dWhen 500 students finished drawing the lots, Zhu Ting stopped the next student.\u201cGo and make your preparations first. The challenge will begin ten minutes later!\u201dAfter Zhu Ting spoke, he carried the metal box that weighed over 50 kg with a single hand. He then returned inside the battle hall.\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201dAfter Zhu Ting\u2019s silhouette vanished, a student tossed the wooden plate in his hand onto the ground and involuntarily wailed in anguish.The people beside him glanced at the wooden lot and immediately conveyed their sympathies.On the thumb-size wooden plate, there were three characters \u20181, Fang Yan\u2019.Fang Yan, a student of the seventh-grade. He was the publicly acknowledged #1 ranker of the battle hall, and this unlucky student drew him out of 500 students. His luck was truly so bad that no one could beat it.However, he wasn\u2019t the only one wailing and sighing. Those who had drawn the top 100 rankers looked as though they were attending a funeral.Sun Mo didn\u2019t waste much time and soon found Qi Shengjia. Qi Shengjia was seated on the stairs and was listlessly staring at the ground. His eyes were red. It was evident that he just cried.\u201cA bad draw?\u201dUpon seeing Qi Shengjia\u2019s state, Sun Mo already guessed the answer.\u201cHis opponent is Peng Wanli.\u201dZhou Xu passed a wooden plate over, but Sun Mo didn\u2019t take it. He already saw the number 106 on it.\u201cYour hard work can be seen by everyone. If you continue to train, half-a-year later, you will even win against someone in the top #100.\u201dWang Hao consoled, but even he himself didn\u2019t believe in his own words.During these few days, Qi Shengjia was full of confidence and he became more chatty. He, who had always been shy, could even say words like he would pass the test for sure. But after drawing his lot, it was like all his energy and spirit had been sapped away.\u201cTeacher!\u201dWhen he saw Sun Mo, Qi Shengjia greeted him in a mournful voice. It was simply like a cuckoo crying blood.\u201cYo, isn\u2019t this student Qi Shengjia? When you were publicly proclaiming that you would pass the battle hall\u2019s test, your expression wasn\u2019t like this.\u201dYan Li came specially to see Qi Shengjia being defeated so he could taunt him later. However, he didn\u2019t expect Qi Shengjia\u2019s luck to be so bad. There was no need for a challenge and it was almost certain that he would lose.\u201cLet me see who\u2019s your opponent?\u201dYan Li moved over. \u201cPeng Wanli? Hehe, this guy is the same year as us, but he\u2019s at the 6th-level of the body refinement realm. His Eighteen Arhat Palms is extremely famous. You are only at the 3rd-level of body refinement, how can you win?\u201d\u201cShengjia is at the 4th-level.\u201dWang Hao rolled his eyes.\u201c4th-level? You broke through recently?\u201dYan Li was astonished. Soon after, he cursed in a low voice. Although Yan Li was at the 5th-level and Qi Shengjia was still one level weaker, he felt unhappy when he saw someone he disliked breaking through.\u201cAre you done or not? Quickly leave!\u201dZhou Xu frowned.\u201cI\u2019m only reminding him out of good-will. Try not to die from being beaten up. Let alone the 4th-level, even if he was at the 6th-level, he wouldn\u2019t be able to beat Peng Wanli.\u201dYan Li laughed uproariously as he left. This detestable poor ghost was finally going to quit school and scram. Tonight, he definitely had to go out and enjoy a feast to celebrate it.\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201dQi Shengjia stood up and walked over slowly. Clearly, he wanted to give up,Wang Hao and Zhou Xu didn\u2019t feel surprised by this. If he entered the battle, it was unknown whether his injuries would be heavy or light. If his injuries were heavy, he would need to spend a bomb on medical fees.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have any hopes\u2026Boohoo!\u201dQi Shengjia lifted his hand to wipe his tears as he cried sorrowfully.Sun Mo surveyed Qi Shengjia. He saw that Qi Shengjia\u2019s potential was still extremely low. Such a thing wouldn\u2019t suddenly rise due to reasons such as \u2018sympathy\u2019 or \u2018you are a good person\u2019.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSystem, open the shopping store!\u201dAs Sun Mo silently mused, the shelf for goods appeared before him.The items here were pathetically little. Sun Mo glanced at everything and his vision then landed at the lucky treasure chest at the bottom left corner of the goods shelf.\u201c\u2018Lucky treasure chest\u2019 valued at 10 favorable impression points. There\u2019s a 0.1% chance you will be able to draw a technique, an item, or a cultivation art, etc.\u201dAs he looked at the note about the lucky treasure chest, Sun Mo decided to gamble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

From low to high, the grades were black-iron, bronze, silver, gold, and diamond treasure chest.When opening a treasure chest, the host would have a chance to gain a reward. The higher the grade of the treasure chest, the better the rewards would be.Other than this, there was another type of treasure chest named lucky treasure chest. This was what the host could get every midnight when the timer refreshed. This same type of treasure chest was also sold in the system shopping store for 10 favorable impression points each.Although the chances of getting good items were very low, this treasure chest was like the last life-saving straw in the hand of a drowning person. Although they knew it was useless, the presence of hope would still bring about great comfort to their hearts.\u201cSystem, how many favorable impression points do I have now?\u201d Sun Mo silently asked.\u201c170,\u201d the system answered in a concise and comprehensive manner.\u201cI\u2019ll buy 10 lucky treasure chests.\u201dActually, Sun Mo knew the answer. His question was to test the system, but sadly, there were no loopholes he could take advantage of.The system\u2019s actions were extremely clean, not giving Sun Mo any chance to regret his words.\u201cWhy do I still have to open the storage cabinet? Just bring them all out, I want to open them.\u201dAfter Sun Mo spoke, a treasure chest before his eyes. He didn\u2019t do anything superstitious like praying for good luck or washing hands to wash away bad luck. He simply mumbled the word \u2018open\u2019 silently.The chest opened; there was nothing in it. There wasn\u2019t even a consolation note that stated \u2018Please try again the next time!\u2019Sun Mo continued.He opened another chest again but didn\u2019t receive anything. It was so for all the ten chests.\u201c\u2026\u201dSun Mo felt like cursing the system\u2019s mother. He really wanted to curse out loud. 100 favorable impression points for ten lucky treasure chests, yet he didn\u2019t receive anything at all.\u201cYou are an extremely unlucky person, why are you trying to gamble on your luck? Does your family own a mine? Do you think it\u2019s so easy to gain favorable impression points?\u201d Sun Mo silently mumbled to himself.Sun Mo slapped his left hand.Pak!\u201cAh?\u201dLi Ziqi called out, feeling a little afraid. However, when Teacher Sun was serious, he also looked quite handsome.\u201cSystem, give me another sev\u2026forget it!\u201dAs Sun Mo spoke halfway, he thought about the lucky treasure chests he would get every midnight. During these few days, he hadn\u2019t been opening them, so he did a quick check and realized that he had five.\u201cOpen them all!\u201dSun Mo was too lazy to open them one by one.Swish, swish, swish~A bright light flashed. All of a sudden, a book emitting a dense golden light flew out from one of the lucky treasure chests and floated before Sun Mo.\u201cCongratulations, you obtained the grandmaster-level \u2018Muscleforge Technique\u2019. This was one of the four branch techniques of the ancient massage technique.\u201cUsing the muscleforge technique on a target can increase the target\u2019s cell vitality, enhance the strength of the target\u2019s muscle, rejuvenate muscle damage, increase strength, and upgrade spirit qi storage.\u201d\u201cYou are determined to make me get on the path of a masseur, right?!\u201dSun Mo was speechless. The things he wanted most were peak-grade medicine, which could be used to directly upgrade one\u2019s combat strength. However, the muscleforge technique wasn\u2019t bad. It was still better compared to some random stuff.\u201cQi Shengjia, come back here!\u201d Sun Mo spoke.Qi Shengjia turned, having a look of despair. \u201cTeacher Sun, I won\u2019t be able to win.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s expression was ice-cold as he walked in front of Qi Shengjia. He lifted his hand and slapped his face.Pak!The clear sound of a slap rang out, causing a female teacher who was walking by to jump in shock. She couldn\u2019t help but turn her gaze in this direction.\u201cSay that again!\u201d Sun Mo berated.Qi Shengjia felt that there was nothing sadder than this. What could the pain of this slap count for? \u201cPeng Wanli\u2019s ranking is #106\u2026\u201dPak!Sun Mo\u2019s slap interrupted Qi Shengjia\u2019s words.\u201cSay that again!\u201d\u201cPeng Wanli\u2019s ranking\u2026\u201dPak!Sun Mo launched another slap.\u201cSay that again!\u201d\u201cPeng Wan\u2026\u201dPak!This time, even before Qi Shengjia finished saying Peng Wanli\u2019s name, all his latter words were smacked back into his throat by the slap.Li Ziqi watched on as her heart trembled.\u201cTeacher\u2026\u201dQi Shengjia didn\u2019t understand why he was slapped.\u201cYou haven\u2019t even gotten on the stage, how do you know you will lose for sure?\u201dSun Mo was very angry. From the time he had taught students until now, he had never hit anyone before. But this Qi Shengjia was too soft and weak. \u201cAs a man, you can lose. But you cannot choose to flee even before the battle. Do you know that you look like a pathetic dog?\u201dThe female teacher involuntarily nodded when she heard this. Her beautiful eyes turned toward Sun Mo as she surveyed him.\u201cTeacher Sun, even if he went up to the stage, he won\u2019t be able to win. And if he is injured, he still needs to spend money on treatment after that,\u201d Zhou Xu spoke in support of Qi Shengjia.\u201cShut up!\u201dSun Mo turned and shot a ruthless glare over. \u201cWhen I\u2019m teaching someone a lesson, how are you qualified to interrupt?\u201d\u201cEh!\u201dZhou Xu hurriedly lowered his head after seeing how fierce Sun Mo was. However, his heart didn\u2019t accept Sun Mo\u2019s words as correct. Although Qi Shengjia\u2019s current actions were very embarrassing, would it be different if he went up the stage?\u201cEven if you cannot win, you cannot allow your opponent to win too easily. Treat yourself as a mad dog, go and bite him, bite him ruthlessly. Make sure that the next time he meets you, his first reaction isn\u2019t to think of you as a soft and weak dog, but a mad dog that could take a few bites out of him.\u201dSun Mo lectured.Pu!The female teacher couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud when she heard this.(This unfamiliar-looking fellow, is he an intern teacher from this year? How interesting.) Just when she was preparing to leave, a buzzing sound rang out. Sun Mo\u2019s body began to emit a layer of golden light.After that, the golden light scattered outward, landing on Qi Shengjia\u2019s body and also enveloping others.Qi Shengjia suddenly felt an abundance of battle intent.\u201cGreat teacher halo!\u201dA student cried out in shock as all of them turned their heads over.\u201cTeacher Sun\u2019s words make sense!\u201dLi Ziqi\u2019s beautiful melon face was golden when the rays of the sun fell on her. The education she had received told her that Sun Mo\u2019s words were extremely impolite. But when she thought carefully about it, it did seem to make sense.If Qi Shengjia fled this time around like a pathetic dog, in the future, when his opponent encountered him again, he would definitely mock him and wouldn\u2019t be afraid to fight again. But if Qi Shengjia was determined to take bites out of his opponent, even if his opponent was the victor, he would most probably change his route to avoid him the next time they met. After all, no one would want to be bitten by a mad dog twice.\u201cAre these the words of wisdom from Teacher Sun?\u201dDing!Favorable impression from Li Ziqi +1.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi. State: Neutral (5/100)Sun Mo, who was encouraging Qi Shengjia, suddenly jumped in shock when he heard the system\u2019s notification. He involuntarily turned and glanced at Li Ziqi.A young woman clad in men\u2019s clothes. When she saw Sun Mo glancing over, she waved her fist with force to cheer him on.\u201cWhat? What did I do? I can even receive favorable impression points like this?\u201dSun Mo was speechless. However, the top priority was to hurry up and boost Qi Shengjia\u2019s morale, giving him confidence.\u201cIt\u2019s time I use my ultimate technique. Qi Shengjia, come with me.\u201dSun Mo took the lead and walked toward the battle hall, preparing to borrow a resting room. He wanted to use his ancient massage technique on Qi Shengjia, as he couldn\u2019t possibly use that in this small public square, right? If that was the case, the title of a masseur would probably be stuck with him forever and there was nothing he could do to cleanse himself of it.Upon hearing the words \u2018ultimate technique\u2019, not only did Qi Shengjia\u2019s eyes brighten, but Wang Hao and Zhou Xu also hurriedly followed him. Li Ziqi didn\u2019t say anything. It was like she was wagging her little tail like an obedient puppy and silently followed behind Sun Mo.Since today was the day of the test, various jobs needed to be done. But since the battle hall\u2019s reputation was so great, it was extremely easy for them to find students who volunteered to help.Staring at the red armbands the volunteers had around their arms, Sun Mo reckoned that their authority shouldn\u2019t be great. Hence, he directly looked for Zhu Ting, the student who had presided over the drawing of lots earlier.\u201cBorrowing a resting room?\u201dZhu Ting frowned and surveyed Sun Mo. Yet, his tone was one of rejection. \u201cSorry, the resting rooms of the Battle Hall have never been borrowed to outsiders before.\u201d\u201cI will only use it for 20 minutes at most.\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t for Qi Shengjia, Sun Mo wouldn\u2019t have said this. He then continued, \u201cI can pay money for it.\u201d\u201cHehe, the resting rooms of our Battle Hall aren\u2019t something you can borrow just by spending money.\u201dZhu Ting laughed, his voice was filled with a hint of superiority. Even the few students beside him had similar expressions on their faces.Sun Mo turned his head and left while noting down Zhu Ting\u2019s name in the small notebook of his heart. Were students from the Battle Hall so impressive? When he formally became a teacher, he would enter the Battle Hall as their consultant and make them call him \u2018teacher\u2019 every day.\u201cHe should be an intern teacher!\u201d a student reminded Zhu Ting.\u201cSo what?\u201dZhu Ting\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cIt\u2019s still not confirmed whether he can join the faculty or not!\u201dIf it was a teacher of the school asking, Zhu Ting might have agreed. But an intern teacher? Who would care about them?Speaking of status, Zhu Ting as the 5th-ranker of the Battle Hall was highly regarded by many teachers, belonging to the category of students that had a bright future. Quite a few teachers had openly expressed their intentions to accept him as a personal disciple, but they were all rejected by Zhu Ting.\u2018A fine bird chooses a tree to nest in.\u2019 Zhu Ting was also waiting for a good offer. After all, with a good teacher to protect him from the wind and rain, his future path would be much more relaxed.\u201cZhu Ting!\u201dZhu Ting\u2014who was currently acting like a big boss, instructing the volunteers\u2014instantly smiled radiantly before turning his head. At the same time, he sucked in his stomach and pushed out his chest, adopting a perfect posture.\u201cTeacher Jin!\u201dZhu Ting called out. His voice was filled with respect and even a hint of amiability. Don\u2019t look down on the words \u2018Teacher Jin\u2019, he had privately practiced calling these words out, infusing them with his emotions.\u201cWhy was that intern teacher looking for you earlier?\u201dJin Mujie was dressed in a moon-white long robe. There were three strands of golden threads being embroidered on the cuff and the bottom of the robe. This was an indication of a 3-star great teacher.Zhu Ting didn\u2019t dare to hide anything.\u201cOh, give him a resting room.\u201dAfter Jin Mujie finished speaking, she turned and departed.The students merely glanced at each other before hurriedly lowering their heads.The consequence of offending a great teacher was an immediate expulsion.\u201cMn!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter Jin Mujie left, Zhu Ting chased after Sun Mo. At the same time, he was frowning. Could it be that Teacher Jin was acquainted with this intern teacher? If this was the case, would his earlier attitude cause the intern teacher to feel hatred in his heart?\u201cThere\u2019s a resting room now?\u201dLi Ziqi happily spoke when Zhu Ting appeared and spoke to them.\u201cYes, I will bring everyone over.\u201dAlthough Zhu Ting\u2019s smile wasn\u2019t radiant, his expression was much better compared to his earlier dead-fish look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, he didn\u2019t have the mood to analyze it. After he reached the resting room\u2019s entrance, he spoke to the others, \u201cThis chance is extremely rare. You guys should go ahead and view the battles. They would be of help to your growth.\u201dSun Mo was just finding an excuse. He didn\u2019t want others to see him performing Tuina.\u201cMn\u2026\u201dLi Ziqi lowered her head and twiddled her index fingers. She wanted to see how Sun Mo would help Qi Shengjia, who was clearly an inferior student, to overturn the situation.\u201cZiqi, come in with me!\u201dSun Mo couldn\u2019t bear to see Li Ziqi like this. After all, she came here to find him. If he tossed her out like this, it would be too merciless.Wang Hao and Zhou Xu exchanged mutual glances when they saw the door being closed.\u201cDeliberately acting mysterious!\u201d Zhou Xu whispered.\u201cAgreed!\u201dWang Hao nodded. From his point of view, Qi Shengjia had no way to reverse the situation.After entering the room, Sun Mo immediately took out the ancient whale oil when the two others didn\u2019t notice. \u201cTake off your clothes!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Li Ziqi gasped in a low voice.Qi Shengjia was ill at ease, glancing at the melon-faced young girl. Although Li Ziqi was in men\u2019s clothes, she was so beautiful, and one could tell that she was a girl with just a glance.\u201cWhy are you \u2018ah-ing\u2019? I\u2019m not asking you to take off your clothes.\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t have time to waste. He was going through the steps of the \u2018muscleforge technique\u2019 in his mind to be more familiar with it. Then he urged Qi Shengjia, \u201cHurry up.\u201dThe order of the battles depended on the lot they drew. The top 50 should all be crushingly strong. Many students were like Qi Shengjia, completely giving up to despair when they saw who their opponents were.Even though some students felt that the opportunity was rare and wanted to spar with these experts, the battle hall members wouldn\u2019t show mercy and would give it their all to end the battles quickly. After all, to these powerful students, these battles were a waste of time, and there was no meaning to it.Hence, although Qi Shengjia was the #106 to head up the battle stage, it would be his turn in at most half an hour later. This was why Sun Mo wanted to quickly borrow a resting room. If they went too far away, it was possible that Qi Shengjia might miss his turn and would be treated as though he had given up.Due to Teacher Jin Mujie\u2019s instruction, Zhu Ting specially found a resting room that was usually reserved for teachers. It wasn\u2019t large, but the equipment inside was very comprehensive. There was even a small bathroom.On the bed, the bedsheet was clean and tidy. Qi Shengjia, who only had a pair of shorts left, climbed up on it embarrassedly.\u201cGo and lie on it!\u201dAfter cleaning his hands, Sun Mo twisted open the bottle\u2019s cap. A strange fragrance instantly permeated the area, causing one\u2019s mind and spirit to stir.\u201cWhat is that?\u201dLi Ziqi was curious.\u201cAncient whale oil.\u201dAfter Qi Shengjia lay down, Sun Mo stretched his hands and pressed down on Qi Shengjia\u2019s back. As expected of the grandmaster-grade \u2018muscleforge technique\u2019, with just a single touch, he could clearly sense the outline of Qi Shengjia\u2019s muscles. After that, he kneaded the muscles to soothe the pressure as detailed information entered his mind.\u201cMuscles are mildly injured, and many capillary blood vessels are fractured. But there\u2019s no problem with his blood. As expected, he trained too excessively, resulting in internal injuries.\u201dSun Mo activated Divine Sight. Before he obtained the muscleforge technique, he could only see the data of his target\u2019s muscles. But now, he clearly knew what influence those data would have on Qi Shengjia\u2019s body.The ancient whale oil that was diluted by water was still white. He smeared it on Qi Shengjia\u2019s skin and as he continued to knead and press. The oil blended into Qi Shengjia\u2019s skin. As sizzling sounds rang out, clouds of white steam rose.\u201cUh-huh!\u201dQi Shengjia only felt his body heating up. It was like he ran for an entire day and went into a hot spring. All fatigue in his body vanished.In the resting room, as the clouds of white steam rose, the fragrance became more intense.\u201cAncient whale oil? It\u2019s really fragrant. I will get some people to search for it when I return and give one bottle to my aunt. This oil seems to be very effective when used on one\u2019s body.\u201dLi Ziqi had been embarrassed to keep staring at the back of a man. However, her gaze gradually couldn\u2019t be shifted away.This massage technique of Sun Mo was too bizarre!Li Ziqi\u2019s clans had five grandmaster masseurs. Usually, after her cultivation, some of them would help to adjust her condition. And because her aunt\u2019s body wasn\u2019t that well, Li Ziqi specially went to learn massaging skills for her sake. With regard to the three main factions and six branches of massage skills, she had some understanding of them all. But the massage skill Sun Mo was using didn\u2019t seem to lie within this system.\u201cIt should be some sort of massage technique that\u2019s circulated from remote places.\u201dLi Ziqi was contemplating. All of a sudden, she saw Sun Mo\u2019s hands ferociously clapping onto Qi Shengjia\u2019s back.Pak!After that, a large amount of golden spirit qi flowed out from Sun Mo\u2019s hands. The streams of golden spirit qi gathered and solidified into a strange-looking human.\u201cThis\u2026this\u2026\u201dLi Ziqi\u2019s ruby red lips opened wide. She couldn\u2019t help but take two steps back as her heart trembled.The bottom-half of this golden man was in vapor state, but its upper-half was a robust male with solid muscles. It shone brightly, as though its body was covered in olive oil.Although the golden man was formed from spirit qi, it was incredibly vivid and life-like.Shua!The golden man opened its eyes. Both its arms exerted force as it hugged inward, displaying its plump and sturdy muscles. After that, a thudding sound rang out as its right fist hammered onto Qi Shengjia\u2019s back.Pu!Qi Shengjia spat out mouthful after mouthful of saliva. He felt like a dough that was being kneaded by Sun Mo.\u201c\u2026\u201dSun Mo had a headful of sweat. What the hell was this thing on his back? Could it be that before it took an arrow to the knee, it was the genie from Aladdin?The oil on the golden man\u2019s body shone brightly. It wore a corset and had a purple turban on its head.Ever since the indian-looking golden man was formed, Sun Mo didn\u2019t need to act personally. Its massage techniques were profound and exquisite. Its thick and strong hands would cause Qi Shengjia to scream every time they come in contact with the young man.\u201cSun\u2026Teacher Sun\u2026what\u2026what massage technique is this?\u201dLi Ziqi was badly shocked. Letting someone like that knead your body must truly be a terrifying experience!\u201cAncient Dragon Capturing Hands!\u201dSun Mo was too shy to admit the truth. Even if someone were to beat him to death now, he wouldn\u2019t tell them that this was known as the ancient massage technique. Sigh, he had truly met a ghost. Why did the golden man\u2019s forms seem to carry a philosophical aura?\u201cHow\u2026how unique!\u201dLi Ziqi quietly took a few steps back. She was deeply afraid that the golden man might stretch out its hand, pull her onto the bed, and start kneading her as well.The golden man suddenly leaped into the air. It flipped in the air while raising its right arm and jutted its elbow out before heavily smashing it into Qi Shengjia\u2019s body.\u201cARGHHHH!\u201d Qi Shengjia roared.Li Ziqi also screamed. Her hands were covering her face, but there were gaps between her fingers where one could see that she was watching unblinkingly.Sun Mo was badly frightened. Would this indian-looking golden man kill someone? Just when he was preparing to check on Qi Shengjia\u2019s condition, the muscles of Qi Shengjia\u2019s body began to tremble and frenziedly absorb spirit qi.\u201cThis is the sign of a breakthrough!\u201dLi Ziqi exclaimed in shock. Qi Shengjia was in a daze after the massage. How did he manage to break through in such a state?\u201cCould this be an effect of the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands?\u201dLi Ziqi analyzed, she couldn\u2019t help but breathe softly, \u201cHow miraculous!\u201d\u201cQuickly wake up!\u201dSun Mo shouted loudly. He grabbed hold of Qi Shengjia\u2019s arm and wanted to pull him up. At such a crucial moment, one had to maintain their consciousness and clarity to absorb the largest amount of spirit qi, elevating the effectiveness of the massage to the maximum. Sadly, Qi Shengjia wasn\u2019t able to do so.He was like a pile of rotten mud lying limply on the bed. There was even a stupid-looking smile of enjoyment on his face.\u201cSigh, no wonder your potential value is extremely low!\u201dSun Mo shook his head.It was only after five minutes did Qi Shengjia wake up. In addition to the nine minutes used during the massage, not even twenty minutes had passed yet.\u201cWho am I?\u201d Qi Shengjia rubbed the center of his brows. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost your turn to fight!\u201dLi Ziqi passed a cup of water over.Qi Shengjia gulped the water down and finally regained his senses. After that, he only felt shocked. Right now, his entire body felt extremely comfortable.\u201cI\u2026I broke through?\u201dQi Shengjia finally recalled what had happened earlier.\u201cCongratulations.\u201dLi Ziqi offered her congratulations.\u201cTeacher Sun!\u201dQi Shengjia got down the bed, and a thudding sound echoed as he knelt on the ground. The force was so great that it almost cracked the floor.Two rows of tears flowed from his eyes. He couldn\u2019t help but be emotional because now that he was at the 5th-level of the body refinement realm, he truly had enough strength to fight Peng Wanli.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +50.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia. Friendly (158/1000).\u201cGet up and tidy this place up. Prepare to go on the stage!\u201dAfter hearing the favorable points notification, Sun Mo was very satisfied. He used less than 10ml of the ancient whale oil and after counting everything, he gained an excess of 40+ favorable impression points from the incident. He still made a profit.\u201cMn!\u201dQi Shengjia nodded furiously. He was extremely agitated. \u201cHow did I break through? Oh right, it must be the effect of the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands. As expected of Teacher Sun\u2019s ultimate technique!\u201dQi Shengjia felt that meeting Teacher Sun was the blessing of three lifetimes. It was truly too fortunate for him.\u2026At the battle hall\u2019s stage, it was already the second time that the judge Zhu Ting called out.\u201cQi Shengjia, please get up on stage!\u201dZhu Ting frowned. When he saw that no one replied, he took out an hourglass. When the sand in the hourglass fell completely, it would mean that Qi Shengjia had automatically given up.\u201cTeacher Sun?\u201dQi Shengjia stood in the passageway and felt a little anxious. However, since Sun Mo didn\u2019t say anything, he didn\u2019t dare to speak either!\u201cDo you want to win?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s gaze turned to the battle stage in the distance. Beside Zhu Ting, there was a short but stocky young man. Through the Divine Sight, all his data appeared before Sun Mo\u2019s vision.\u201cMn!\u201dQi Shengjia nodded.\u201cIf you want to win, do what I told you to!\u201dSun Mo instructed in a low voice.Li Ziqi was like a rabbit as her ears pricked up.\u201cEh?\u201dQi Shengjia tidied his hair, completely clueless.\u201cWhat are you \u2018eh-ing\u2019 for? Have you remembered what I said earlier?\u201d Sun Mo berated.\u201cYes!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euQi Shengjia hurriedly nodded.\u201cGo ahead. Even though this might be your last battle before you quit school, I hope you can give it your all. When you recall this battle in the future, I want you to only feel pride and not regret.\u201dSun Mo patted Qi Shengjia on his back for encouragement. After that, he pushed Qi Shengjia forward.This time, Sun Mo\u2019s great teacher halo wasn\u2019t activated, but in Qi Shengjia\u2019s heart, an unprecedented sharpness and determination appeared.For this battle, he would win or die trying!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At this moment, one-third of the students in the battle hall had already left. The reason why they were here was because they wanted to see the fights of the top 50 ranked geniuses. At most, maybe the top 100. The more backward the ranking, the less interested they were.\u201cQuickly began!\u201dThose students who were arranged to battle near the end began to urge. They hated those who wasted time the most. If the challenger knew he couldn\u2019t make it, he might as well not show up to embarrass himself.\u201cI still thought that Qi Shengjia would forfeit!\u201dWang Hao was surprised.\u201cSun Mo must have encouraged him and he impulsively went up. Why doesn\u2019t he think a little? There\u2019s a two-level difference in their cultivation. How can he win?\u201dZhou Xu shook his head.On the stage, Zhu Ting spoke, \u201cBoth parties are to greet each other mutually.\u201d\u201cPeng Wanli, 6th-level of the body refinement realm. Please provide me with guidance!\u201dPeng Wanli who was short and stocky surveyed Qi Shengjia. Qi Shengjia\u2019s mental state seemed to be not bad, but it was fine. Their cultivation bases were two levels apart; he would win for sure.When students wanted to participate in the challenge battles, they had to report their information during the registration. Peng Wanli was an official member of the battle hall, so he simply asked his friends who were in charge of registration and soon learned of his opponent\u2019s information.\u201cQi Shengjia, 5th-level of the body refinement realm. Please provide me with guidance!\u201dQi Shengjia adopted a battle posture. He remembered Sun Mo\u2019s instruction. Once the judge gave the announcement to start, he would attack immediately.\u201cHe\u2019s actually at the 5th-level? No wonder he is so confident!\u201dPeng Wanli\u2019s lips twitched, yet he didn\u2019t really care at all. However, Zhou Xu and Wang Hao in the audience were stunned.\u201cDid I hear it wrong or did Shengjia say wrongly? 5th-level of the body refinement realm? If he lied, he would be expelled!\u201dWang Hao was worried. He thought that Qi Shengjia was lying to Peng Wanli because he wanted to win.\u201cHow stupid. This minor trick is useless!\u201dZhou Xu hated iron for not becoming steel. Teacher Sun must have been the one who taught him this. If not, the honest Qi Shengjia wouldn\u2019t have done such a thing.As for Qi Shengjia breaking through to the 5th-level, even if the two of them were beaten to death, they wouldn\u2019t believe it. Leaving aside the fact that Qi Shengjia spent more than half-a-year before he broke through to the 4th-level of the body refinement realm, his aptitude was extremely inferior and he had just successfully broken through to the 4th-level just a few days ago. How could he break through again?\u201cBegin!\u201dAs Zhu Ting\u2019s voice rang out, Qi Shengjia was like a hungry wolf lunging over. His fists danced in the air, generating gusts of wind that swept over to Peng Wanli.\u201cHmph!\u201dPeng Wanli didn\u2019t bother to evade, and he domineeringly faced the attack.Bang! Bang! Bang!Fists and palms collided with each other. Their impact caused waves of energy to blast out.\u201cTeacher Sun is right!\u201dQi Shengjia felt agitation in his heart as he recalled what Sun Mo had said to him.\u201cAll young people would have pride in their hearts, let alone your opponent who is one level higher than you. He would definitely choose to face you head-on. At that time, aim all your attacks at his right shoulder!\u201dAt the start of their exchange, it was already proven that Sun Mo was correct. This caused Qi Shengjia\u2019s confidence to swell as he gave it his all.\u201cRemember, trade injuries for injuries. Do not even retreat for half-a-step, just crush his right shoulder.\u201dQi Shengjia remembered Sun Mo\u2019s guidance. He gritted his teeth and fought valiantly. Peng Wanli\u2019s Eighteen Arhat Palms was indeed very powerful. Each blow on his body caused him extreme pain. He felt that if it was him in the past, he would definitely not be able to withstand this. But today, his condition was so good that it was terrifying. Although it was painful, it was like his endurance had also increased.\u201cRight, it must be the effect of the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands!\u201dQi Shengjia guessed. He was too stupid, and he forgot that after he leveled up, the strength of his body would increase as well.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dPeng Wanli was frowning, and his display of the Eighteen Arhat Palms grew increasingly hurried. It was clearly a relaxed battle, but why did it feel so difficult? His opponent was like a mad dog, refusing to retreat. He was adamant about trading injuries with him.Bang! Bang! Bang!After another round of attacks, Peng Wanli who suffered over ten blows to his right shoulder continuously retreated in order to extend the distance between them.Qi Shengjia\u2019s chest heaved violently as he panted.\u201cA pity!\u201d Li Ziqi sighed.Qi Shengjia\u2019s strength was only at this level. If he were stronger, he could take down Peng Wanli now if he exerted another spurt of energy.Jin Mujie sat behind a long table made from mahogany. She was drinking tea and chatting with a few students, guiding them on their flaws. After Qi Shengjia got up the stage, her gaze instantly shifted over.\u201cHe leveled up? Did he eat a peak-grade alchemy pill? Wrong, that intern teacher shouldn\u2019t be a fool. He wouldn\u2019t do something so meaningless like feeding an alchemy pill to the student just for the sake of winning this battle.\u201dJin Mujie analyzed, \u201cBut if he didn\u2019t eat an alchemy pill, how did he level up?\u201dThis graceful young married woman furrowed her brows as a puzzled look appeared on her face. As a 3-star great teacher, her judgment was extraordinary and could naturally see Qi Shengjia\u2019s previous condition. Qi Shengjia hadn\u2019t been at the stage where he was about to break through. Hence, his current cultivation at the 5th-level of the body refinement realm was due to something the intern teacher did.\u201cMy god\u2026what the hell?\u201dZhou Xu cried out in surprise. How could Qi Shengjia fight so dazzlingly against Peng Wanli? Could it be that Peng Wanli\u2019s ranking was fake?\u201cDid Peng Wanli have diarrhea today?\u201dWang Hao was puzzled too. \u201cSpeaking of which, did Shengjia get a bit stronger?\u201d\u201cYeah, he couldn\u2019t really be at the 5th-level of the body refinement realm, right?\u201dAs someone at the 6th-level of the body refinement realm, Zhou Xu realized Shengjia\u2019s outstanding performance. If one spoke of their mental states and imposing manner, Qi Shengjia might be even stronger than him!\u201cCould it be that he can really win?\u201dAfter Wang Hao mumbled to himself, he involuntarily shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m thinking too much, Peng Wanli isn\u2019t an immobile target!\u201d\u201cI can win!\u201dOn the stage, these three words appeared in Qi Shengjia\u2019s heart.The scene right now was no different from what Teacher Sun had said.\u201cAfter some time, he wouldn\u2019t want to fight directly against you and will take the initiative to retreat. At that time, after your earlier eruption, you won\u2019t be able to catch up to him. However, don\u2019t be anxious. Take the chance to gather your breath and strength. You should use words to disturb his mental state.\u201dAs he recalled Teacher Sun\u2019s instructions, Qi Shengjia spoke.\u201cPeng Wanli, I\u2019ve already seen through your flaws.\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201dPeng Wanli laughed coldly, acting as though he wasn\u2019t bothered. However, his heart was pounding in fear.\u201cMy aptitude is bad and my family is poor. If I cannot enter the Battle Hall this time around, I will have to quit school and be sold to a large clan as a servant. Hence, I will fight to the death in this battle today.\u201dQi Shengjia looked directly into Peng Wanli\u2019s eyes. His tone was honest and filled with desolation.Sun Mo covered his face. Qi Shengjia completely didn\u2019t have any acting talent. Luckily, his current situation was roughly the same as what he said. Hence, his expression was still on the ball.\u201cWhat do you mean by this? You want me to show mercy?\u201dPeng Wanli wasn\u2019t those types of people that would be considerate to the circumstances of others.Qi Shengjia didn\u2019t know what to reply, but Teacher Sun had said before that no matter what Peng Wanli said, he just had to repeat the words Teacher Sun had taught him.\u201cYou and I are different. You are a genius, and even if you lost this, you will be able to rejoin the battle hall three months later.\u201d\u201cHmph, that\u2019s only natural!\u201dPeng Wanli had arrogance on his face.\u201cHowever, if you truly fight to the bitter end with me, even if you won, you would still suffer some residual injuries. Although you will recover, your peak state will never be the same again!\u201d After speaking, Qi Shengjia directly rushed out.Skywolf Hunt! A moment later, twenty sets of fist shadows surged over.Boo!Scattered booing sounds rang out from the crowd, criticizing Qi Shengjia for using a dirty trick. However, the majority of students didn\u2019t care about it. Wasn\u2019t it just trash-talking? There were no problems as long as Qi Shengjia didn\u2019t use hidden weapons or disgraceful methods.Zhu Ting, who had been bored to death, seriously surveyed Qi Shengjia after hearing his words. He felt somewhat taken aback. \u201cQi Shengjia actually knows how to use verbal attacks and fight a psychological battle?\u201dJin Mujie nodded. Attacking the \u2018hearts\u2019 of your opponents was the supreme battle method!\u201cWhat?\u201dPeng Wanli retreated again and again. The pain in his right shoulder seemingly intensified. His doctor once told him that due to his injury, he mustn\u2019t fight in the meantime, or it would affect his recovery.However, no one could avoid the test of the battle hall. When he had been selected by Qi Shengjia, Peng Wanli was rejoicing. He had thought that he had found an easy opponent. But who could have known that Qi Shengjia was a hot potato!Peng Wanli\u2019s mind was unsettled. His pride made him not want to defend. However, the words from his doctor made him feel as though there was a bone stuck in his throat. He had no choice but to defend instead of attacking.At this moment, Qi Shengjia\u2019s morale received a boost as he attacked even more fiercely.\u201cIs he going to win?\u201dLi Qizi\u2019s hands were tightly clenched as nervousness could be seen on her face.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dSun Mo turned to leave, there was no need to watch any longer. Peng Wanli\u2019s defensive posture indicated that his heart was already in chaos.\u201cWhat to do? What to do?\u201dPeng Wanli\u2019s heart was jittery and filled with anxiety. He didn\u2019t know what he should do.Should he ignore the worsening of his injuries and defeat Qi Shengjia? However, the consequences would be severe. If he lost now, he could always join the battle hall again after he recovered three months later.To a young guy that was 14 years of age. This choice that would affect his future simply gave him too much pressure.As for Qi Shengjia, his confidence skyrocketed because up until now, everything that Sun Mo said, had come true.\u201cI can win this battle!\u201dQi Shengjia stepped and punched out with immense might.Skywolf Whistling at the Moon.Roar!Spirit qi whistled. The strands of it transformed into a wolf head and shot over to Peng Wanli, wanting to take a bite out of him.Thump! Thump!Peng Wanli continued to retreat. He executed his Arhat Heart Shattering Palm and after dissipating the wolf head, he discovered that Qi Shengjia had taken the opportunity to rush forward, appearing before him. It was too late now even if he wanted to continue defending.Bang!Peng Wanli\u2019s right shoulder was punched, and he fell down the stage from the impact.\u201cFor this match, Qi Shengjia is the victor!\u201dZhu Ting announced.The entire audience was in a state of absolute silence. The eyes of the students were filled with a mixture of envy and disdain when they looked at Qi Shengjia. None of them felt he deserved the win.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThey felt that Qi Shengjia didn\u2019t win by virtue of his strength. Rather, it was because Peng Wanli coincidentally had an injury and encountered him. If they were fighting against Peng Wanli, they would win as well.\u201cMy god, Shengjia won\u201dWang Hao rubbed his eyes forcefully. He felt that he was dreaming.Clap! Clap! Clap!All of a sudden, sounds of applause rang out. Everyone turned and discovered that the 3-star great teacher Jin Mujie was the source of it. She was clad in the long white robes with three strands of gold embroidered on it. The robes fully accentuated her full figure, and she exuded a sense of holiness and beauty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was praise from a great teacher, something that he had never received before!The other students were so jealous that their eyes almost turned red. Jin Mujie who had the air of a young married woman was not only beautiful, but her figure was great as well. Her teaching ability could be considered among the top in the Central Province Academy. Being able to be praised by her was something many guys yearned for even in their dreams.\u201cPeng Wanli, your aptitude isn\u2019t bad. Sadly, your will is too weak and your combat experience is lacking, resulting in your mind being shaken in the psychological battle. Otherwise, given your strength, the battle wouldn\u2019t be this one-sided.\u201dJin Mujie listed the reasons for Peng Wanli\u2019s defeat.Peng Wanli bitterly laughed. He stood up straight, and his hands were at the sides of his legs as he bowed. \u201cThis student has benefited from your advice.\u201d\u201cQi Shengjia, your acting skills are too bad. If you were facing geniuses like Zhu Ting, they would definitely not be fooled,\u201d Jin Mujie commented.\u201cThis student has benefited from your advice.\u201dQi Shengjia gulped down a mouthful of saliva. He had simply followed Sun Mo\u2019s instructions to the letter, totally not expecting them to be so effective. But when had he ever waged a psychological battle? He was a direct and pure guy. Honestly, he would forgive his wife-to-be even if she turned out to be unfaithful on their wedding day.\u201cYour aptitude is bad, but you shouldn\u2019t undervalue yourself. Your execution of the Skywolf Fist is extremely good!\u201dAfter pausing for a moment, she added one more sentence. \u201cOut of all the students in the Central Province Academy, the number of people whose attainments in the Skywolf Fist are higher than you can be counted on two hands!\u201dHua~After hearing Jin Mujie\u2019s words, everyone was in an uproar.This country bumpkin was so powerful? This was an evaluation given by a 3-star great teacher, so it shouldn\u2019t be wrong.For a time, Qi Shengjia became the target of envy of the crowd. Many students, who also cultivated the Skywolf Fist, were prepared to bring some gifts over to seek guidance from Qi Shengjia about it.\u201cIt\u2019s fake, right? This must be a dream,\u201d Zhou Xu muttered. He was so jealous that he was about to go crazy. Qi Shengjia had received a great evaluation from Teacher Jin Mujie. Why did he qualify to get such an evaluation?\u201cIt\u2019s too incredible, Shengjia actually won?\u201dWang Hao clicked his tongue.\u201cAlright, you guys can leave now. The next battle will begin shortly!\u201dJin Mujie sat back down. Given the aptitude Qi Shengjia displayed, it was evident that he didn\u2019t comprehend the Skywolf Fist by himself. Since that was the case, someone must be teaching him.\u201cWas it that intern teacher?\u201dJin Mujie suddenly felt some interest in the young man with the sunshine-like smile. If it wasn\u2019t for her having seen the scene of Sun Mo berating Qi Shengjia earlier, she basically wouldn\u2019t have given an evaluation at all.\u2026Two rows of tall chinese parasol trees, which were planted at both sides of the road, cast down their shadows onto the limestone pathway.Sun Mo leisurely walked over, simultaneously admiring the beautiful scenery of the campus while listening to the notifications from the system. A smile could be seen on his face, making him appear like a fisherman who had just returned with a full haul.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +50, this was the worship that Qi Shengjia felt after he obtained victory by blasting Peng Wanli off the stage.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +50, this was the eruption of his emotions after receiving the evaluation from great teacher Jin Mujie. Without Sun Mo\u2019s guidance, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to receive praise from a great teacher in his lifetime.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +50. The sense of worship in Qi Shengjia\u2019s heart was growing after he had heard the praise of great teacher Jin Mujie regarding his Skywolf Fist.Without Sun Mo\u2019s guidance, his Skywolf Fist wouldn\u2019t have improved by so much. By receiving a positive evaluation from a 3-star great teacher, it also could prove Sun Mo\u2019s teaching ability.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +50. Without Sun Mo, Qi Shengjia would have to quit school for sure. But now, everything was different.Ding!Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia. Friendly (358/1,000).\u201cSeems like one could only generate a max of 50 favorable impression points at any given time.\u201dSun Mo was very satisfied.\u2018Ding! The host helped Qi Shengjia to pass the battle hall\u2019s test. Mission completed. Reward: one golden treasure chest.\u2019As the system notification rang out, a shiny golden treasure chest appeared in front of Sun Mo.\u201cBeautiful!\u201dA golden treasure chest had a very high probability of containing some peak-grade items. Just when he was about to open it, a voice rang out in his ears.\u201cTeacher Sun, he won!\u201dLi Ziqi jogged over. Because she hurriedly tried to stop, when she got near Sun Mo, she tripped and fell forward.Luckily, Sun Mo\u2019s reactions were fast. He stretched his arms up and supported this girl that only had 1 point in the agility stat.\u201cAhh!\u201dLi Ziqi felt extremely embarrassed. She lowered her head and pretended to be a turtle that pulled its head in.\u201cEveryone has different things they are proficient in. Don\u2019t be too bothered.\u201dSun Mo laughed. Under the sunlight, he looked even more handsome.\u201cYour guidance is too useful!\u201dBeing with Sun Mo this whole time, Li Ziqi had experienced how Sun Mo orchestrated the whole battle. One could say that Qi Shengjia had won because of Sun Mo\u2019s excellent guidance, which had led him step by step in this \u2018tempo-battle\u2019.Ding!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +30.\u201cIt\u2019s normal!\u201dEarlier, when Sun Mo had seen Peng Wanli standing on the stage, he had immediately activated Divine Sight and looked through Peng Wanli\u2019s data. If Sun Mo hadn\u2019t seized the advantage and used it to the fullest, he would have let the spell \u2018Divine Sight\u2019 down.\u201cYou are too humble!\u201d Li Ziqi spoke. This was most probably the effect of a good teacher who could change the fates of students. If it wasn\u2019t for Sun Mo, Qi Shengjia could only quit school and be a normal worker forever.\u201cDon\u2019t need to be so polite, or I will take it as you treating me as an outsider.\u201d Sun Mo smiled. He then gave an open indication. \u201cI\u2019m in a good mood today, so I will treat you to a meal. You can order anything as long as the food cost is below one tael of silver.\u201d\u201cTeacher, you are so petty. Just one tael of silver? It isn\u2019t even enough to order a flask of cool grape wine.\u201dLi Ziqi was only joking. She was like a happy little chick following beside Sun Mo. She didn\u2019t know why, but she always felt very happy when she was together with him.\u2026Qi Shengjia didn\u2019t see Sun Mo after his battle ended. Feeling a little anxious, he was prepared to look for him, but he was stopped by Wang Hao and Zhou Xu.\u201cHow did you win? Quickly tell us what\u2019s going on!\u201dZhou Xu jumped over. His right hand directly hung over Qi Shengjia\u2019s neck. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I will treat you for today\u2019s lunch. We will have a feast at the Drunken Immortal Inn!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all Teacher Sun\u2019s credit.\u201dWhen speaking of Sun Mo, Qi Shengjia became even more respectful.\u201cHow did you break through to the 5th-level of the body refinement realm?\u201dWang Hao\u2019s eyes flashed. From the strength unleashed by Qi Shengjia in the earlier fight, there was no doubt that he was at the 5th-level.\u201cTeacher Sun used the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands on me. Oh right, he even used an extremely expensive bottle of whale oil. When he opened it, the fragrance permeated the entire resting room.\u201dWhen he thought back to that fragrance, Qi Shengjia had a look of intoxication on his face.Wang Hao and Zhou Xu exchanged mutual glances, feeling extremely shocked in their hearts. Then what followed was the feeling of regret. They should have been more respectful to him.At this moment, Sun Mo received two notifications from the system.Ding!Favorable impression from Wang Hao +30.Prestige connection with Wang Hao. Neutral (63/100).Ding!Favorable impression from Zhou Xu +35.Prestige connection with Zhou Xu. Neutral (50/100).Sun Mo furrowed his brows, feeling as though he had just picked up a ten-dollar coin from the road. He knew that these must have occurred because Qi Shengjia had explained the reason for his victory to Zhou Xu and Wang Hao.\u2026\u201cDo you think he will use his Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands to help me level up if I go and beg him now?\u201dZhou Xu had an extravagant hope.\u201cAre you dreaming? It\u2019s such a powerful method, how could it be displayed so easily?\u201dWang Hao felt extremely regretful. He had eyes but couldn\u2019t see Mt. Tai, missing the chance to get into Sun Mo\u2019s good books. He also didn\u2019t know what he could do to make up for this.\u201cStudent Qi Shengjia, please wait!\u201dPeng Wanli rushed over.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dZhou Xu\u2019s tone was unfriendly. He thought Peng Wanli was here to look for trouble.Qi Shengjia also grew nervous.\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. I just want to know how you could tell that my right shoulder was injured.\u201dPeng Wanli stared at Qi Shengjia. Regarding this matter, no one should have known about it, and he had concealed it very well. Why was it exposed? If he didn\u2019t make things clear, he would feel hard to rest or eat in peace.\u201cIt was Teacher Sun Mo who told me,\u201d Qi Shengjia spoke bluntly.Wang Hao wanted to roll his eyes when he heard this. (Do you have to be so honest?)\u201cWho?\u201dPeng Wanli thought he heard wrongly. \u201cSun Mo? Headmaster An\u2019s fiance? The \u2018soft-rice\u2019 guy?\u201d\u201cCorrect!\u201d Qi Shengjia nodded.\u201cHmph. Student Qi Shengjia. Even if you don\u2019t wish to tell me, there\u2019s no need for you to trick me like this!\u201dPeng Wanli coldly snorted as he turned to leave. The name \u2018Sun Mo\u2019, due to the connection with An Xinhui, was extremely well-known in the Central Province Academy. If he had such good judgment, why wasn\u2019t he qualified enough to be a teaching assistant?\u2026Sun Mo and Li Ziqi ate some fried dishes in the canteen, and their total expenses were below half-a-tael of silver. The steel plate girl (flat) Li Ziqi wanted to treat him. But as a man, how could Sun Mo permit it?\u201cTeacher Sun, goodbye!\u201dAfter their meal, Li Ziqi waved her hand. She had been hesitating but after experiencing the matters today and seeing the joy that Qi Shengjia felt after winning against his opponent, she made a decision.\u201cSun Mo is a teacher worthy of my trust!\u201dLi Ziqi muttered to herself. Her hands were placed behind her back as she skipped while walking, staring at the Sorrowless Lake in the distance. \u201cIn addition, I like the scenery of the Central Province Academy very much!\u201d\u2026After Sun Mo returned to his dorm, he heard the discussion between Ludi and Yuan Feng.\u201cGu Xiuxun is so awesome. Although she\u2019s just an intern teacher, there\u2019s already a student that wants her to be his master.\u201dYuan Feng\u2019s words were filled with envy.\u201cThat student is named Zhang Yaozong, right? I heard that this fellow defeated the #10 ranked Cai Tan in the battle hall\u2019s battle today. He became famous after a single battle.\u201dLudi clicked his tongue and continued, \u201cAfter he won, he even praised Gu Xiuxun and her guidance. Sigh, Gu Xiuxun can be considered to be in the limelight today.\u201dQi Shengjia merely won against Peng Wanli who was ranked #108. This incident was so small that it was like a pebble tossed into the water. And as for the top ten rankers of the battle hall, they were all publicly acknowledged geniuses of the school. When one of them was defeated, it would cause a huge commotion.\u201cCai Tan is so miserable. No matter what, he is one of the representative characters of the fourth-year students, but he could only become a stepping stone to a first-year.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYuan Feng felt a little joy and delight in Cai Tang\u2019s misfortune. There was nothing he loved more than watching these geniuses suffer a setback.\u201cI heard that Gu Xiuxun used the momentum of her student\u2019s victory to come up with a condition. She wanted the intern teachers to have the qualifications to recruit personal students in the upcoming student recruitment meet.\u201d Ludi praised.Gu Xiuxun\u2019s ambitions were truly great. If the school agreed, with the gratitude of all the intern teachers and her own capabilities, she would become the leading character of this batch of intern teachers.\u201cHas the school agreed?\u201dYuan Feng opened his eyes wide and had a nervous look on his face. The thing intern teachers sought after the most was to become a substitute teacher. This would mean that they had officially joined the faculty and became a real teacher that could teach students and give lectures boldly on the rostrum.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23: Great Teacher Halo, Ignorant and IncompetentLordbluefireLordbluefire\u201cThe leaders of the school have already finished discussing, and they decide to permit intern teachers to recruit students. As long as an intern teacher has five students under them, they would be able to become substitute teachers and officially join the faculty.\u201dAfter Ludi finished speaking, Yuan Feng jumped up agitatedly.\u201cThis is too awesome!\u201d Yuan Feng used his strength and waved his arms in excitement. \u201cGetting a pay raise and promotion is just before our eyes.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too happy. The title of an intern teacher holds no attraction toward new students.\u201dLudi poured a bucket of cold water down on Yuan Feng\u2019s head.Just like how a fine bird would choose a good tree to rest in, acknowledging a master was an extremely major matter. All students would only acknowledge a teacher as their master and sincerely seek the chance to be a personal disciple after studying in the school for two to three years, or until they completely familiarized themselves with the teacher\u2019s situation.Naturally, a great teacher was an exception. But how many students would truly be overflowing with enough talent that they would be recruited by a great teacher?Teachers wouldn\u2019t casually accept disciples either. Once a student became their personal disciple, they had to treat the student like a half-son or a half-daughter and attentively guide them.Similarly, the students would also treat their teachers as parents and show them respect and love. If they changed their mind half-way through and turned to other teachers, they would receive great condemnation and rejection from the majority of people.But even a salted fish (trash) would have dreams!It wasn\u2019t easy to join the tutelage of a great teacher. Hence, many students would consider acknowledging teachers with many years of experience. As for intern teachers who just joined the school and wasn\u2019t even guaranteed that they could join the faculty? Truthfully speaking, unless one had a way with words or had some accomplishments, they would only then be able to attract maybe two\u2026or three students.When he thought of this, Yuan Feng sat back dejectedly. But after he saw Sun Mo, he became complacent again. \u201cIf I cannot make it, this \u2018soft-rice\u2019 guy would undoubtedly not have a chance.\u201dSun Mo lay on the bed. His left eye blinked twice as he opened up the storage cabinet.The golden chest appeared, shining brilliantly.\u201cHow can I increase the chance of getting good stuff? Should I go and find a 36E papaya girl and touch her chest to increase my luck?\u201dOpening treasure chests was a metaphysics study. But when he thought of the fact that papaya girls were rarely seen, Sun Mo gave up on the notion.\u201cOpen!\u201dAs Sun Mo mumbled, the golden treasure chest opened. A book emitting a dense golden light floated in the air, revolving slowly around.\u201cIgnorant and Incompetent?\u201dWhen he saw the name on the cover, Sun Mo rapidly sat up. In the end, he banged his head into the wooden plank above his bunk bed.BOOM!Sun Mo drew in a breath of cold air due to the pain. However, he couldn\u2019t bother to rub his bruise, his attention was completely attracted by the golden book.\u2018Ignorant and Incompetent, a great teacher halo. When students don\u2019t want to put in any effort or work hard, devolving into muddle-headed youngsters that only know how to idle their time away, becoming scums that only know how to play and enjoy themselves\u2026You can use this great teacher halo to administer punishment, helping them back onto the proper path.\u2019\u2018After a teacher uses this halo, the student being berated would experience a sensation of being hit in the head for the purpose of bringing about instant awakening. The student would instantly enter a dazed state and lose their ability to think.\u2019\u2018Elementary-grade.\u2019\u201cHaha, it\u2019s actually a great teacher halo?\u201dSun Mo involuntarily laughed out loud. \u201cCould it be that by being together with that steel plate girl, it would increase my luck? Praise to Li Ziqi, Amen!\u201dSun Mo decided that in the future when he received another golden treasure chest, he would chat with Li Ziqi for three days before opening it.\u201cCrazy fellow, you can\u2019t even become a teaching assistant, yet you can laugh out loud? You truly have no sense of shame.\u201dYuan Feng stared at the smiling Sun Mo with contempt. (When you are fired, I would definitely buy 1 kg of pig head\u2019s meat to send you away.)Sun Mo couldn\u2019t do anything about the happiness he felt. This was a great teacher halo! One could only obtain one by gaining enlightenment and not through studies. If one wanted to become a great teacher, they had to comprehend three great teacher halos at the very least and have a secondary occupation.The prerequisite to becoming a normal teacher was to comprehend the \u2018self-taught\u2019 halo. Because that was the basic, it couldn\u2019t be considered a great teacher halo.The current Sun Mo possessed the \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 and \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019 halo. It could be considered that he had taken a small step forward on the path of being a great teacher.Sun Mo couldn\u2019t wait anymore. He quickly left his dorm and found a remote location with no one else. He then took out the golden book and placed it before his nose, inhaling deeply.\u201cHow fragrant. This must be the smell of a great teacher.\u201dSun Mo mumbled. After that, he crushed the skill book.Pak!The book crumbled apart, transforming into a ball of golden light that shot into the center of Sun Mo\u2019s brows. In Sun Mo\u2019s mind, some mysterious and profound secrets instantly appeared.When he glanced at the great teacher halo\u2019s effect, Sun Mo wanted nothing more than to find someone to try it on.\u2026In the resting room of the logistics department.Li Gong stared at the teacup in front of him, and a conflicted look could be seen on his face. His face was currently scrunched up like an \u2018anus\u2019.\u201cConstipation again?\u201dChen Mu passed some pickled plums over.Just when Li Gong wanted to reply, a fatty walked into the resting room. Li Gong hurriedly stood and squeezed out the most radiant-looking smile he could muster.\u201cDepartment Head Yang!\u201dCreak! Creak!The grinding sound caused by the friction of chairs moving against the floor could be heard. Also, the sounds of greetings rang out together in unison.\u201cMn, you guys can go out first!\u2019Yang Cai nodded in satisfaction after seeing that all the staff in the logistics department stood up. He placed his hands behind his back and walked toward Li Gong. The fat on his stomach was too much. When he walked, the flesh there trembled like waves.The staff hurriedly bowed. They lowered their heads and left the resting room.\u201cHas it been settled?\u201dYang Cai stood before Li Gong and casually lifted Li Gong\u2019s teacup.\u201cAl..almost done.\u201dLi Gong\u2019s neck shrank.Pak!Yang Cai threw the teacup right at Li Gong\u2019s nose, scolding, \u201cAre you dumb? How many days has it been? Can\u2019t you even handle an easy matter like this?\u201d\u201cSun Mo is very cunning!\u201dLi Gong smiled bitterly.Bang!Yang Cai took the teacup and threw it at Li Gong again.\u201cWhat do you mean by he is cunning? You only need to find trouble for him. When the matter becomes big, I will be the one to wrap things up.\u201dYang Cai coldly snorted. Sun Mo was merely an intern teacher while he was the logistics department head. As long as Sun Mo made a mistake, he would have an excuse to deal with him.\u201cI will do it immediately.\u201dIn order not to be hit again, Li Gong hurriedly guaranteed.\u201cI will give you three more days. If you cannot handle it, scram for me.\u201dYang Cai glared at Li Gong. He then walked past a few office desks and pulled their drawers out. Only after he did a rough check did he leave the department.\u201cPui, how stupid.\u201dYang Cai spat out a mouthful of saliva on the flowers beside him. He was considering using other methods. The higher-ups said this was very urgent and were rushing him for results. If he didn\u2019t chase Sun Mo away quickly, he would have to be scolded again.\u201cWhat can I do? I\u2019m also in despair!\u201dLi Gong sighed. He sat on the chair, seemingly devoid of strength. Blood flowed from his nose, but he didn\u2019t have any mood to wipe it away.\u2026The sun gradually set.Li Gong opened the door leading to Sun Mo\u2019s room.\u201cWho are you looking for?\u201dLudi was holding a pig trotter while staring at Li Gong in puzzlement.\u201cI\u2019m looking for Sun Mo, Teacher Sun.\u201dLi Gong smiled.\u201cSun Mo, someone is looking for you.\u201dLudi called out and then returned to the table, continuing to pluck away the fur on the pig trotter. However, his eyes involuntarily turned to Li Gong. This lame middle-aged man was clad in the uniform of a worker from the logistics department. Why was he looking for Sun Mo?\u201cTeacher Sun.\u201dWhen Li Gong saw Sun Mo sitting at the side of his bed, reading a book, he laughed. He placed the bag of tea leaves that he had bought beside him. \u201cThis is the Tuanlong Tea from Ceylon Mountain. I\u2019ve already kept it for twenty years.\u201dUpon hearing the words \u2018Tuanlong Tea from Ceylon Mountain\u2019, Ludi\u2019s brows involuntarily twitched. This was a famous tea, 50 grams of the dried tea leaves could be sold for over 1,000 taels of silver. Unless one was a wealthy person or a government official, they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it.Ludi glanced over. Li Gong had brought a bag of roughly 250 grams of tea leaves. Although it might not be a lot, if these were truly Tuanlong Tea Leaves, that would mean that their value was about 5,000 taels of silver.During these few years, the Tang Country enjoyed favorable weather. The country prospered and the people were at peace. However, the annual expenses of a family of three were at most about 100+ taels of silver.\u201cThis fellow put so much thought in his present, what does he want to do?\u201dLudi was incessantly shocked. However, what was even more shocking was the scene that followed. Sun Mo\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t even glance at the tea leaves. He couldn\u2019t even be bothered to acknowledge Li Gong\u2019s presence.A hint of rage flashed on Li Gong\u2019s face, but he didn\u2019t dare to vent. He continued smiling and stood obediently at the side.After over ten minutes, Li Gong finally couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. \u201cI will go to boil some water to steep the tea!\u201dLi Gong took up the bronze kettle on a nearby table and went out of the dorm. The moment he got out, he couldn\u2019t help but begin to curse.\u201cYou little brat, how dare you treat your daddy Li like this. When you fall into my hand, I\u2019m going to make sure you die with pain.\u201dAfter the water boiled, Li Gong, who was so angry, coughed twice intentionally. He then spat out a mouthful of yellow phlegm into the kettle. But when he returned to the dorm, his smile shone again.Sun Mo was the only one who could cure his leg that had been lamed for over ten years. If he wanted to recover, he could only endure this.\u201cTuanlong Tea\u2019s essence would only be fully brought out in the second infusion. You must definitely drink it while it\u2019s hot!\u201dAs Li Gong introduced, he steeped the tea. A dense tea fragrance permeated the atmosphere of the dorm, causing one to salivate.Gulp!Ludi silently swallowed a mouthful of saliva. From the fragrance, these tea leaves should be the Tuanlong Tea from Ceylon Mountain.\u201cThis teacher, why don\u2019t you come and try as well?\u201dLi Gong called out to Ludi.\u201cI won\u2019t stand on ceremony then.\u201dLudi walked over and lifted his teacup, blowing on it a few times. Then a sizzling sound could be heard as he pursed his mouth and drank a mouthful. At that moment, the fragrance immediately flowed into the bottom of his heart. He involuntarily called out \u2018good tea!\u2019 after he drank it.\u201cHehe, Teacher Sun. Come and try it.\u201dLi Gong smiled widely, but his heart was bleeding. This was the tea leaves he had kept for over ten years after all. It was wasted just like this.Sun Mo glanced at the tea and activated his Divine Sight.\u2018Ceylon Mountain, Tuanlong Tea, good-grade. Upon consumption, one\u2019s mind would be cleared and one\u2019s fatigue would dissipate. It\u2019s healthy for the guts and digestion.\u2019The age of the tea leaves wasn\u2019t bad, but they couldn\u2019t be considered top-quality. Given Li Gong\u2019s status and his financial ability, being able to get 250 grams of them was already his limit.\u201cSun Mo, come and taste it. It\u2019s very fragrant, really good.\u201dLudi urged. His EQ wasn\u2019t bad. He knew that Li Gong treated him to this tea not because he was generous. It was because Li Gong wanted his help in praising this tea.Li Gong tactfully filled up another teacup and passed it over.\u201cYou drink it!\u201d Sun Mo spoke.\u201cAh?\u201d Li Gong was stunned.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDrink up all of the tea, not even a drop is to be left.\u201d Sun Mo\u2019s tone was ice-cold.(Damn, how could this guy spit a mouthful of phlegm into the tea? Could he be more disgusting than this?)\u201cSun Mo, he is kind-hearted enough to give you the tea leaves. Is your attitude not a little too vile?\u201d Ludi spoke and drank another mouthful. The taste wasn\u2019t bad.\u201cOh? You help him to drink it then!\u201dSun Mo laughed lightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then he took his pig trotters and headed out.The tea wasn\u2019t bad, but Ludi was thin-skinned, so he didn\u2019t ask for another cup.\u201cAfter I become a great teacher in the future, I\u2019ll be able to afford such tea leaves as well. I\u2019ll rinse my mouth with it!\u201dLudi set a small goal for himself.\u201cDrink up!\u201dSun Mo personally poured Li Gong a cup of tea.Li Gong smiled bitterly and finished it. It didn\u2019t matter since he was the one who had spewed it out anyway.\u201cDrink it all up, the entire pot.\u201dSun Mo had no intention of letting this end.(When a gentleman seeks revenge, it\u2019ll be from day to night. Want me to drink a cup of tea that has been spat? You\u2019ll count as lucky if I don\u2019t pee all over your face.)\u201cTeacher Sun!\u201d Li Gong pleaded.\u201cPui!\u201dSun Mo spat into the cup and put it in front of Li Gong.\u201cSun Mo, you are an intern teacher. Can you not humiliate me like this?\u201dLi Gong gave in.Sun Mo was sick of the persuasion and grabbed Li Gong\u2019s hair directly, tugging it downward. He then brought the cup to Li Gong\u2019s mouth, forcing the tea down his throat.\u201cCough cough, cough cough!\u201dLi Gong coughed and struggled.\u201cWhen you spat into it, why didn\u2019t you think of my status? Should I be the one humiliated instead?\u201d Sun Mo asked.Li Gong had wanted to push Sun Mo away with brute force. But when he heard this, his body stiffened up, and cold sweat covered his entire forehead. How did he know about that? A fluke? Right, it must be a fluke!\u201cHmph!\u201dSun Mo raised his hand and slapped the cup into Li Gong\u2019s face.Bang!The cup shattered, and Li Gong\u2019s nose broke as well. Two streams of blood immediately trickled down like water from a fountain.\u201cAhh!\u201dLi Gong cried out agonizingly, held onto his face, and fell to the ground.Sun Mo picked up the pot and poured it all over Li Gong\u2019s head.Splash!Water splattered and Li Gong was drenched.\u201cAhhh, it\u2019s so hot!\u201dLi Gong\u2019s clothes were completely wet, and he rolled around after being scalded. His skin had turned a little red as well.Creak!The dorm room opened, and Ludi stood there in a daze. He had forgotten something and came back to get it. However, he hadn\u2019t expected to see such a violent scene.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I came to the wrong place!\u201dBang!Ludi closed the door and dashed down the stairs. As he was too nervous, a few pig trotters had dropped down.Rumors said that people were giving Sun Mo a hard time and that he was leading a pathetic time in the logistics department, having to do all the tiring and dirty jobs. He wouldn\u2019t be able to hang on for long\u2026Bullshit. That person seemed to be the one in-charge of Sun Mo in the logistics department. However, he was being trashed and yet didn\u2019t dare to make a sound.\u201cCould it be that he can act like this just because his fianc\u00e9e is the headmaster?\u201dLudi was extremely envious. \u201cSun Mo is really having it good when sponging off a woman!\u201d\u2026\u201cDepartment\u2026 Department Head Yang Cai came to look for me today, asking me to make things hard on you.\u201dLi Gong was in so much pain that he was clenching his teeth.\u201cYou\u2019re trying to haggle with me?\u201dSun Mo smiled coldly.\u201cNo, no, I wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d Li Gong explained, \u201cI think that you should help me cure my lame leg, then we can deal with him to\u2026\u201dBang!Before Li Gong could finish his words, Sun Mo picked up the pot from the ground and smashed it right on Li Gong\u2019s head.Dong!Li Gong fell flat on his back.\u201cDon\u2019t you understand your situation yet?\u201dSun Mo squatted down next to Li Gong, poking him in the chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice. Yang Cai\u2019s goal is just to deal a blow to An Xinhui through me, chasing me away while he was at it. I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t care if I have this job or not.\u201dLi Gong looked at Sun Mo. Given his judgment that was trained from scrambling around at the bottom of the society, he could tell that this young man wasn\u2019t joking.The actual owner of this body was previously worried that he\u2019d make mistakes and get fired. That was why he kept on tolerating things. However, things were different for Sun Mo. Although this was a good job that over 200 people were fighting to get, even if he were to be eventually converted to a permanent position, he\u2019d still tender his resignation if he wasn\u2019t happy with the job. He wouldn\u2019t have any reservations.Li Gong was at a loss. He was like an old dog whose territory had been snatched from him, lowering his head. His teeth were unable to get through Sun Mo!Sun Mo grabbed onto Li Gong\u2019s leg with one hand and kneaded a little with his grandmaster-grade \u2018Muscleforge Technique\u2019. This gave him a greater understanding of Li Gong\u2019s injury.Li Gong first felt soreness and numbness, followed by a piercing pain, and then a warm current flowing through. His lame leg, which he had lost the feeling of, felt extremely comfortable.\u201cIt\u2019s moving? My leg is actually moving?\u201dLi Gong was elated.\u201cDon\u2019t challenge my patience again. If you want your leg to be cured, then do as I say.\u201dSun Mo got up and patted Li Gong on the shoulder. \u201cAnother thing. The muscles on your lame leg haven\u2019t been moved over the years and have shrunk a lot. If this drags on, it will be impossible to cure it.\u201dAs Sun Mo removed his hand, Li Gong\u2019s lame leg once again returned to the icy cold condition it was in before. That feeling was like a parched traveler in the desert finding a watermelon after great difficulty. But when he had just taken a bite into it and hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to enjoy it, someone slapped him in the face, and he spewed it out.\u201cAre you a demon?\u201d Li Gong cried.\u201cNo, I\u2019m Sun Mo.\u201dSun Mo wore an extremely alluring smile, flashing his eight white teeth, causing Li Gong\u2019s heart to palpitate. \u201cI\u2019m Sun Mo, who is even more terrifying than a demon!\u201dSun Mo had been a teacher-in-charge for six years and had taught 12 students who went to Tsinghua and Peking University. He hadn\u2019t managed to do this only through patient guidance. When he became strict, he could make a spartan warrior cry.\u201cOh, right, I\u2019ve gained enlightenment and obtained a great teacher halo today. Do you want to give it a try?\u201d Sun Mo teased.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dLi Gong pouted, not believing it. Was it so easy to get a great teacher halo?\u201cIgnorant and Incompetent!\u201dAfter saying that, Sun Mo snapped his fingers.Pa!A golden flare flashed, like sparks that were created when flintstones were struck against each other. These flares didn\u2019t disappear but condensed to form a golden arrow, shooting out toward Li Gong.\u201cHuh?\u201dAfter seeing the light flare appearing, Li Gong was given a shock. He backed off unconsciously. However, the golden arrow\u2019s speed was too fast, and it stabbed into his head in the blink of an eye.The golden arrow\u2019s power pushed back Li Gong\u2019s head abruptly. When he lifted it back up, his eyes had lost focus. His gaze became dull and spiritless, appearing as if he was intellectually disabled.Heh!A sound came out from Li Gong\u2019s throat unconsciously. His mouth opened wide, and saliva came dripping down from the corners of his lips.\u201cLi Gong, can you hear me?\u201d Sun Mo asked loudly.Li Gong turned his head, still appearing to be in a daze.\u201cMy great teacher halo is really amazing!\u201dSun Mo was surprised. He had temporarily turned a person into an idiot. He walked up to Li Gong and tested him by asking some simple questions.Li Gong didn\u2019t show any reaction.\u201cIs this for real?\u201dSun Mo was a careful person. He would always try his best to gather information about the unknown to prepare for emergencies. He raised his hand and slapped Li Gong\u2019s face.Pa!The slap was very loud.\u201cHehe!\u201dLi Gong smiled idiotically, and more saliva came dripping out from his mouth.Pa! Pa! Pa!Sun Mo exerted more and more strength, but Li Gong continued to smile, still not showing any significant reaction.\u201cI\u2019ve ascertained from his gaze that he\u2019s a real idiot now.\u201dSun Mo was surprised.The \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 halo that he had gotten previously had the effect of reinforcing what the teacher said, and thus Sun Mo didn\u2019t manage to have any direct experience from it. But now, he truly experienced how powerful the great teacher halo was. He felt very happy. If any student were to not listen to him and create trouble in class, he would just toss an \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019 halo at them, turning that person into an idiot and stop the ruckus.Sun Mo started to study the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art. It was only after half an hour had passed that Li Gong started to regain his consciousness.\u201cWho am I? Where am I? What did I do?\u201dThe daze in Li Gong\u2019s eyes gradually dissipated. He realized that he was still in Sun Mo\u2019s dorm, but his memories were still stuck at the point where he had been hit by a \u2018golden arrow\u2019. He couldn\u2019t recall what he had experienced in between.Plop!Li Gong dropped to his knees.Ding!+20 favorable impression points from Li Gong.Prestige connection with Li Gong. Current state, neutral (26/100)\u201cTeacher Sun, I was wrong!\u201dLi Gong cried. He was regretting why he had promised the Logistics Department Head to create trouble for Sun Mo. He had initially thought that Sun Mo was just a mediocre person who had become an intern teacher in the Central Province Academy after getting involved with An Xinhui. He had thought that Sun Mo didn\u2019t have much capabilities. However, by the looks of things, Sun Mo was very scary.\u201cIf anyone were to say that Sun Mo is someone who sponges off a woman in the future, I\u2019ll spit all over their face.\u201dLi Gong had seen Sun Mo performing the \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 halo at the warehouse a few days back, and he had gained enlightenment with yet another one. His talent was probably at Gu Xiuxun\u2019s level.Li Gong was just a worker in the logistics department. Although he had the Logistics Department Head, Yang Cai, backing him up, why did he have to fight against Sun Mo? To Yang Cai, someone like himself was like a chamber pot. When needed, he would be called. If not needed, he would be kicked away.If he were to get into trouble, he could forget about Yang Cai helping him out.\u201cTeacher Sun, if you ask me to head to the east, I\u2019ll definitely not run toward the west.\u201dAs someone who had been scrambling in society for over twenty years, Li Gong decided to change sides after assessing the situation.Ding!+30 favorable impression points from Li Gong.Prestige connection with Li Gong. Current state, neutral (56/100)Two consecutive notifications rang out, causing Sun Mo to assess Li Gong. He was a little surprised.\u201cLi Gong\u2019s respect toward you led to the increment in the favorable impression points. This is the power of a great teacher!\u201d the system explained.\u201cVery good. Go gather negative news about Yang Cai after this.\u201dSun Mo was in no hurry to take care of that Logistics Department Head. It wasn\u2019t because he had any reservations, but more like once he made a move, he wanted it to be lethal, not giving the opponent any chance to retaliate.In order to keep Li Gong motivated, Sun Mo massaged his lame leg a little more, making him feel so good that he had a strong urge to do anything for Sun Mo.\u2026Next morning, Sun Mo was woken up by the sound of rain hitting the plantain trees.\u201cIt\u2019s raining?\u201dHe opened the window and a light breeze blew in, bringing in the humidity from the rain. Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help but stretch out his body.The rain still hadn\u2019t stopped after he had his breakfast.Sun Mo took out an oiled paper umbrella, picked up the [Essentials of Alchemy] and [Compendium of Herbology] he had borrowed from the library, and went out to return them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo\u2019s body was very healthy due to cultivation. However, after he got a rough grasp of the general knowledge in this world, he still chose to study alchemy and herbology. He wanted to have a greater understanding of his body through them.As it was raining, there were fewer students around. Sun Mo walked for a while and then turned to the path leading to the Sorrowless Lake.The wind and rain brought about melancholy, causing Sun Mo to miss his home.The lakeside, pavilion, and stretches of lotus leaves!Jin Mujie was enjoying the scenery when her beautiful gaze landed on Sun Mo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He walked along the pebbled path by the Sorrowless Lake, taking a stroll.He was wearing a light blue long robe, his long black hair tied up into a bun. As he wasn\u2019t used to such a hairstyle, he didn\u2019t do a good job of tying his hair up. A few tufts of hair escaped the knot and came falling down.Sun Mo felt irritated and wanted to cut them off. However, Jin Mujie felt as if it gave the handsome Sun Mo an additional hint of unconstrained and relaxed disposition.\u201cIt\u2019s so relaxing. It\u2019s a pity that I didn\u2019t bring along my drawing tools with me!\u201dJin Mujie sighed. What a waste of such good scenery!Sun Mo looked up and saw that a young married lady was sitting at the pavilion by the lake. Her limpid eyes that were like that of the autumn water happened to land on him.The rain was getting heavier, and Sun Mo entered the pavilion. He took the furthest seat from the lady and sat down.The scenery here wasn\u2019t good, but it was far away from the lady. This would save others from saying that he had ill-intentions and wanted to hit up on her.Sun Mo had taken a few glances at the young lady and couldn\u2019t help but notice that she was very beautiful and had a curvy figure. Although she was in her thirties, there weren\u2019t many traces of time on her face. She wore light makeup, but brought out an elegant disposition.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Jin Mujie spoke up. As a 3-star great teacher, she wielded great authority in the Central Province Academy.There were plenty of teachers who came to the lakeside to enjoy the scenery in the rain. However, when they saw Jin Mujie, they avoided the pavilion. They were worried that they\u2019d disturb and displease her.Sun Mo was the only guy who had the guts to come over.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Sun Mo asked.Jin Mujie smiled faintly, not replying. With just this alone, she could tell that this elegant-looking guy was extremely aggressive.She didn\u2019t reply, so the atmosphere in the pavilion turned awkward.\u201cYou think that I don\u2019t know just because you aren\u2019t saying it?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips curled up as he looked at her.The words \u2018Jin Mujie\u2019 immediately appeared above her head.\u201c30 years old, likes sweet food. Has the hobby of collecting bones. As she has been working too much in the office, her cervical vertebrae is feeling a little uncomfortable.\u201d\u201c3-star great teacher.\u201d\u201cPotential Value: Extremely High.\u201d\u201cRemark, she hasn\u2019t had a taste of love for three years. If this goes on, she\u2019ll wither.\u201dThe rows of information appeared next to Jin Mujie. When Sun Mo saw the words \u2018collecting bones\u2019, his brows couldn\u2019t help but raise.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201dSun Mo was quite a courageous person, but he\u2019d definitely avoid contact with bones. Therefore, his gaze became a lot more indifferent when he looked toward Jin Mujie again.Seeing Sun Mo looking at her, Jin Mujie felt a little displeased. This was offensive to any lady. She had wanted to reprimand him but then noticed that he shifted back a little and turned his gaze away.\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201dJin Mujie was perplexed. She could feel some repulsion from Sun Mo\u2019s subconscious action.Yes, repulsion. This was too unbelievable to Jin Mujie. Putting aside her dignified status as a 3-star great teacher, given her beauty and figure, she had seen too many men who had strong yearnings for her. There was a reason why there tended to be more guys in her public classes than there were girls.\u201cCould it be that he likes guys?\u201dJin Mujie was curious.\u201cSister, it isn\u2019t that nice for you to be staring at me like this, right?\u201dWhen Sun Mo brushed his teeth every morning, he would practice smiling. This made him more approachable before his students.Sun Mo didn\u2019t continue the conversation and only stared at Jin Mujie while smiling.Although Sun Mo didn\u2019t have a girlfriend and had been a single man who had devoted all his leisure time to games, he wouldn\u2019t jump out just because he saw a beautiful lady.The reason he spoke up was because of her title as a \u20183-star great teacher\u2019.Having been a teacher for six years at No.2 High School, Sun Mo understood how helpful it was to his career to be able to cling onto someone influential.Since ancient times, having connections would make it easier to get things done.From day one, the higher-ups of the academy had thrown Sun Mo to the logistics department instead of giving him the position of an intern teacher. From this, it was clear that although he was said to be someone sponging off a woman, that An Xinhui, who wasn\u2019t in a good position herself, probably couldn\u2019t be of much help to him. However, given Sun Mo\u2019s character, he wouldn\u2019t mind this.Sun Mo had always been someone who liked to prepare for the rainy weather. Now that he had met a 3-star great teacher by chance, it\u2019d be a waste of the many years of reading the Thick Black Theory [1] if he didn\u2019t try to forge a connection and cling onto her.In Middle-Earth, a place where great teachers held the greatest statuses, a 3-star great teacher had higher status and prestige as compared to a Logistics Department Head.Of course, Sun Mo had his bottom line as a person, and he wouldn\u2019t just cling to anyone.At the thought of this, Sun Mo turned his gaze toward Jin Mujie.Today was a rest day, so Jin Mujie was wearing casual clothes. She wore a long dress made from brocade, and it looked resplendent and expensive.Jin Mujie felt uncomfortable from being stared at by Sun Mo and couldn\u2019t help but raise her hand to cover her collar. She spoke out in a slightly angered tone, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cLooking at your cervical vertebrae. There\u2019s a problem with it. If you don\u2019t seek treatment earlier, the lines of your neck won\u2019t look good in the future.\u201dSun Mo intentionally exaggerated things. Women loved to look beautiful, so he should be able to make a move from this point.\u201cPeople who work at the desk for a prolonged period would end up like this.\u201dRecently, Jin Mujie\u2019s neck would feel stiff and there would be a piercing pain if she were to sit for too long. She had looked for a female doctor to help give her Tuina, but it didn\u2019t help.\u201cI can cure it!\u201dSun Mo felt so confident as he had the grand-master grade \u2018Muscleforge Technique\u2019.\u201cHehe!\u201dJin Mujie didn\u2019t believe him, wanting to say, (bastard, you want to take advantage of me? No way.)Sun Mo stood up and walked toward Jin Mujie.Jin Mujie wasn\u2019t scared. How would an intern teacher dare to offend her? But as she looked at Sun Mo with a challenging gaze, about to reprimand him, he suddenly grabbed the back of her neck.An astonished look appeared on Jin Mujie\u2019s face instantly. Although Sun Mo\u2019s wasn\u2019t rough, it was a man\u2019s hand after all.There hadn\u2019t been a man who dared to be so rude toward her.\u201cI\u2019m going to break his hand!\u201dJin Mujie was instantly filled with rage and stood up. However, the words of reprimand she was going to say instantly turned into a low scream.\u201cAhh\u2026\u201dWhen Sun Mo\u2019s hand pressed onto the back of Jin Mujie\u2019s neck, even though there was a slight piercing pain, it still felt comfortable for her. It was the feeling of liberation.That feeling was indescribably good.\u201cMmmhmm!\u201dJin Mujie forgot about the reprimands and let out a soft moan without realizing it. She closed her eyes slightly and sat back down, behaving like a cat master who was enjoying the stroking from its servant.\u201cIt\u2019s a success.\u201dSun Mo had broken out into cold sweat. A 3-star great teacher was at least at the divine force realm. If she were to slap out and kill him, he wouldn\u2019t be able to retaliate.Thankfully, Jin Mujie\u2019s hostility plunged.\u201cYour pain started about nine months ago.\u201dSun Mo tried to display his value the best he could.Jin Mujie was very surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re able to find that out just from touching it a few times?\u201d\u201cEn!\u201dSun Mo nodded and let go of his hand, returning to his seat. He could resolve Jin Mujie\u2019s neck problem in one sitting, but he mustn\u2019t do that. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have any other excuse to approach her in the future.Jin Mujie moved her fair neck, yearning for more of the massage and feeling a little dejected. She wanted to experience that comfortable feeling for a little longer, but her dignity as a great teacher wouldn\u2019t let her make this request.\u201cTry not to work at the desk for a prolonged period. If you must work, remember to get up and move your neck every once in a while.\u201dSun Mo then picked up his umbrella and wanted to leave.\u201cThank you!\u201dJin Mujie stood up. From this action alone, it was clear that her impression of Sun Mo had gotten a little bit better. \u201cI\u2019m called Jin Mujie. If you have any trouble in the future, you can come to look for me.\u201dJin Mujie didn\u2019t mention anything about money, but these words of hers were even more precious than gold.Sun Mo didn\u2019t look back, only waving his hand. He then stepped onto the pebbled path and disappeared in the rain.\u201cInteresting. He dares to plot against me. He\u2019s quite daring.\u201dJin Mujie thought of how this kid had instructed Qi Shengjia the other day, and it piqued a little interest in her.Ding!+1 favorable impression points from Jin Mujie.Prestige connection with Jin Mujie initiated.

Jin Mujie had clearly enjoyed the experience, but it ended up only giving him one favorable impression point.It was hard for ordinary people to obtain the recognition and favorable impression from important characters like Jin Mujie.However, Sun Mo didn\u2019t mind that. Even if Jin Mujie\u2019s cervical vertebrae was fine, there\u2019d still be ways in which the ancient massage technique would benefit her. After all, this was a nurturing technique.

In this place, there was neither the forest of concrete nor the metal vehicles of his world. Instead, it was filled with alleys, maids in green clothes, and elegant-looking young ladies who took light steps into some shops that were selling make-ups.You could smell the fragrance of claypot chicken or meat skewers and hear the occasional calls from generous customers who wanted the waiters to serve them wine.Sun Mo bit on his vegetarian bun as he walked along the wet and slippery slated path. After passing past a tanghulu [1] seller who was lifting a carrying pole, he entered a bookshop called Reading Veranda.As it was raining, there were very few customers in the shop. There was only an old man sitting on a wooden chair, reading a book leisurely. Placed next to him was a cup of tea that had already turned cold.The bookshop was very big, filled with tall and heavy bookshelves made from Chinese locust trees. Even with Sun Mo\u2019s tall stature, he would have to tiptoe to reach the books on the highest level of the bookshelves.Sun Mo took a liking to this bookshop after taking a look around.Everything was categorized and placed very neatly. The books could be loaned out, and it would only cost one copper coin per day.Usually, books that were loaned out would have some stains or damage to them, but that wasn\u2019t the case for the books here. This meant that the owner took great care of the books and had solemnly given a warning to the people who loaned them.Sun Mo didn\u2019t like to go out. Other than playing games, his other hobby was to read novels. Therefore, he felt very endearing to see a bookshop here.There were folk stories, Chinese opera manuscripts, as well as poetries. There were different types of books here, but the one Sun Mo picked up was a novel.[Nine Provinces Immortal Slaying Legend], written by Wild Mountain Old Man. There were over ten books in the series, and they filled up half the shelf. This should be a popular series in the Tang Country.Sun Mo flipped through the book. The title sounded very domineering, and the plot was heavy. It wrote about the emotional entanglements in a sect, presented in an imposing style. It was no wonder that they could be displayed here.In Middle-Earth, the literature was written in movable type printing. Therefore, knowledge still wasn\u2019t being disseminated widely, and only a minority of people were literate.\u201cTsk, if they are of this standard, I can write my own novels.\u201dSun Mo took a few glances and put the book back.\u201cWhy? Not satisfied?\u201dSun Mo hadn\u2019t noticed when the old man had gotten up from the wooden chair and approached him. Seeing Sun Mo put back the [Nine Provinces Immortal Slaying Legend], he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cThis is a popular book that took the entire Jinling by storm in the past one year. Youngsters like to read it.\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t say anything. This old man was clearly a fan of the book. If he were to say the wrong things, they might end up getting into a fight.The old man carefully tidied the bookshelf that Sun Mo had browsed through and then sat back on the chair. About half an hour later. he saw Sun Mo coming back, holding onto the [Nine Provinces Immortal Slaying Legend]. He couldn\u2019t help but smile.\u201cI thought you don\u2019t like it?\u201dThe old man raised his brows, making his intentions very clear. (You said that it isn\u2019t good, but your body seems to be very honest. You\u2019re still going to borrow them after all, right?)\u201cThat\u2019s right. I don\u2019t like it. But there are really no other books to borrow, so I can only make do with it.\u201dSun Mo wore a helpless expression. The novels here were still stuck in the xianxia and monster genres. How could such monotonous subjects possibly satisfy Sun Mo?Hearing the words \u2018make do\u2019, the old man glared at Sun Mo, his mustache flying as he puffed out. \u201cThen write a book and show me what \u2018not make do\u2019 is like!\u201d\u201cHave you read Transformers before?\u201d Sun Mo teased.The old man appeared stunned.\u201cHave you read Dragon Ball before?\u201dThe old man continued to wear a dazed expression.\u201cThen you must have not read Journey to the West before, right?\u201dSun Mo started his teasing episode.\u201cYou\u2019re spouting gibberish, right? I\u2019ve read countless books. Why is it that I haven\u2019t heard of the books you mentioned?\u201dThe old man felt gloomy and stared at Sun Mo suspiciously. He hadn\u2019t expected this young man to be such a liar when he looked so refined.\u201cThat\u2019s because you haven\u2019t read enough.\u201dSun Mo said as if it was true, but he was laughing inside. Then he felt dejected. Sigh, he wouldn\u2019t be able to read them anymore in the future.The old man\u2019s face turned black. But as someone who loved books as much as his life, he suppressed his fury and asked, \u201cWhere did you read those books?\u201d\u201cI wrote them myself!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t dare to say things recklessly. As someone who came from another world, he wouldn\u2019t say these names if it wasn\u2019t because the old man had been speaking sarcastically to him. It was because revealing information might just bring him trouble.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dThe old man was so angry that he raised his hand, wanting to beat Sun Mo. Sun Mo had piqued his interests, yet he was now telling him that those were all made up? What an awful man.\u201cIt costs one copper coin to rent it for a day, right?\u201dSun Mo dug out the money.\u201cEn.\u201dThe old man nodded and settled the procedures for Sun Mo. However, the words Sun Mo had mentioned earlier kept on flashing in his mind. Putting that Transformers aside, just the names of Dragon Ball and Journey to the West sounded very interesting. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat is Journey to the West about?\u201dSun Mo let out a soft laugh and shook his head.\u201cIf you have a manuscript, I can buy it from you!\u201dThe old man had read too many books, and thus it was far too difficult for him to find a book he liked. This was a torment to someone who loved books as if they were his life.\u201cHow much would you offer?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s eyes lit up. Right now, the money he was spending belonged to the original owner of this body, and there wasn\u2019t much of it in the first place. Moreover, an intern teacher\u2019s salary was very meager. Sun Mo could predict that he\u2019d have to live a straitened lifestyle for quite a while.If he were to get into a relationship and have a girlfriend, then he\u2019d have to spend even more money. At the thought of how he didn\u2019t even have the money to change his lifestyle, he felt way too pathetic.\u201c200 silver taels!\u201d The old man offered.Sun Mo shook his head.\u201cWhy? You think it\u2019s too little?\u201dThe old man knocked on the table. \u201c100 silver taels is enough for a family of three to lead a comfortable life for a year. Young man, don\u2019t be too greedy.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the market price if I were to publish a book?\u201dSun Mo thought, (if I were to sell the story of Journey to the West to you, I\u2019d be a fool.)\u201cHehe!\u201d The old man let out a contemptuous laugh. \u201cYoung man, lead a proper life. Don\u2019t be dreaming.\u201dMiddle-Earth was still in a feudal era, and the production capabilities were low. When the printing and paper manufacturing capabilities were lacking, it would mean that publishing a book was an extremely extravagant matter.Sun Mo turned to leave.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll satisfy you.\u201d The old man gave in. \u201cI\u2019ll help you publish 300 copies. If it ends up being a loss, it\u2019ll be on me. And if it earns money, it\u2019ll all go to you.\u201d\u201c1,000 copies!\u201dSun Mo made an exorbitant request. He had a colleague who published reference books, and back then, 1,000 copies were considered quite a good result.\u201cToo many, no money, not possible!\u201dThe old man gave three rejections, not wanting to be scammed.Sun Mo looked at the old man and activated his Divine Sight.\u2018Zheng Qingfang, retired to his hometown three years ago, becoming a rich man. He loves books as if they were his life, and his divine force realm is at the seventh level.\u2019\u2018His body function is severely damaged. He was harmed by poison in the past, and it left a hidden ailment.\u2019\u2018Remark, the Zheng Clan has a strict family teaching. If you encounter a member from the Zheng Clan who has fallen down, you can help them with a peace of mind. Don\u2019t be afraid of being scammed for money.\u2019Sun Mo looked at the data that appeared next to the old man. Retired? Did that refer to an official who had retired? He didn\u2019t expect that this bookshop owner had worked as an official before. He must not be lacking in money.Zheng Qingfang had survived a lot of great storms in the court, but somehow he felt uncomfortable being stared at by Sun Mo. It was as if ants were crawling on his body.\u201cAlright, 500 copies. Nothing more.\u201dZheng Qingfang gave in and assessed Sun Mo while he was at it.Sun Mo was wearing a light-blue long robe that was washed very cleanly. Together with his handsome appearance and upright figure, he gave off a faint and refreshing disposition. When he pursed his lips, there seemed to be a faint and unnoticeable arch to it, giving off a calming feeling.Zheng Qingfang had seen many youngsters with outstanding dispositions in his lifetime. But this young man was even more outstanding than most of them.\u201c1,000 copies.\u201dSun Mo refused to give in.\u201cAlright, but I want to admire your wooden blade.\u201dZheng Qingfang\u2019s gaze landed on Sun Mo\u2019s waist. He had attached a wooden blade made from black sandalwood there.Sun Mo shrugged and turned to leave. What a joke. It had the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art on it. How could it be shown to others so easily?However, this old man\u2019s judgment was extremely good, capable of seeing Sun Mo\u2019s most valuable thing in one glance.\u201cKid, it\u2019s useless no matter what you say. Bring me the manuscript first. If it\u2019s interesting, I\u2019ll go all out and print 1,000 copies for you,\u201d Zheng Qingfang shouted out.When Sun Mo\u2019s figure disappeared from his sight, this old man sat back on his wooden chair. Now that he looked at the novel he was holding, it all felt so boring. His mind was filled with the names Dragon Ball and Journey to the West.\u201cWhat kind of story do they have?\u201dIt was as if a cat was scratching at Zheng Qingfang\u2019s chest. He felt an uncontrollable itch in his heart.The rainy season in June continued. After buying a few pieces of osmanthus cake, Sun Mo got onto a small boat and toured along the Qinhuai River.The wooden blade was casually stashed at his belt. Its value wasn\u2019t high to begin with, but after the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art had been carved on it, it no longer had the same value as it did before.Since Sun Mo was worried that he\u2019d lose the wooden blade if he were to leave it in the dorm, he could only keep it with him.It wasn\u2019t forbidden to bring around blades and swords in the Tang Country, but bows and arrows were banned. If one were found to be holding them, they\u2019d be arrested and chained down, even thrown into prison for a few days.Sun Mo still wasn\u2019t used to keeping a heavy blade or a sword with him, so he just kept this wooden blade on him as a means of defense.After offering a joss stick at the Spirit King Temple, Sun Mo headed back to school. When he passed by a corner, he saw a skinny girl hugging a small bag tightly in her arms. She was sitting under a roof to get out of the rain.The girl was about 13 to 14 years old and looked very innocent. It was just that her face was filled with dejection.\u201cA young girl with nowhere to go back to?\u201dAs a teacher, Sun Mo was very sensitive toward kids like her. It was because he had had an encounter back in school where a student had run away from home.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo looked at her, activating his Divine Sight.\u2018Lu Zhiruo, 14 years old, penniless. In a state of extreme starvation.\u2019Sun Mo secretly gave his approval at this elegant name.The roof was small and couldn\u2019t shield the girl from the rain completely. Her cotton clothes were all wet, but she seemed as if she didn\u2019t notice anything. She curled up, like a little kitten who had been abandoned.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TanghuluPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her money pouch must have been stolen by a thief.\u201d Sun Mo analyzed as he walked over, handing the packet in his hand to the girl. \u201cThese are osmanthus cakes. You can have them.\u201dLu Zhiruo looked up and threw a glance at Sun Mo. The girl didn\u2019t accept the packet and cowered back a little, avoiding his gaze.\u201cI\u2019m not a bad guy!\u201dSun Mo tried to ease his tone.\u201cFather said that all bad guys would say that.\u201dLu Zhiruo pretended not to hear what he had said.\u201cIf you don\u2019t dare to speak to strangers, why would you leave home by yourself?\u201dThis girl really didn\u2019t bring shame to her surname. She was like a newborn deer, cowardly and scared of strangers.Lu Zhiruo remained silent, not saying a word, almost burying her entire head into her bag.Sun Mo shook his head and turned to leave.It was only until Lu Zhiruo heard the footsteps getting further and further away did she quickly look up. She saw the package placed at the side. After struggling for a few minutes, she then reached out her index finger and poked at it.It was the scent of osmanthus cake!\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like a bad guy. Should I eat some?\u201dLu Zhiruo picked up the package, but before she took a bite, she put it down again. \u201cI better not. He might be hiding in some corner, waiting for me to take the bait!\u201dAt the thought of this, Lu Zhiruo held onto her bag tightly and stood up. She tiptoed and looked around, only sitting back down when she didn\u2019t see anything.\u201cShould I eat it or not?\u201dLu Zhiruo was hesitant.Gurgle~Her stomach was starting to growl again. Lu Zhiruo had been waiting here for one day and one night, ever since she lost her money pouch yesterday. She wanted to catch the thief but didn\u2019t manage to succeed.\u201cI\u2019ll just take one bite. Even if there are sleeping drugs in it, I wouldn\u2019t fall from just that bit, right?\u201dLu Zhiruo couldn\u2019t stand the starvation anymore. However, when she opened up the package and ate the osmanthus cake, her ears pricked up, like a small deer that had heard a ferocious beast getting near.The footsteps she had heard earlier were coming back.\u201cThis is bad! I really fell into the trap!\u201dLu Zhiruo\u2019s face was filled with worry. She wanted to run away, but what if that thief happened to pass by when she had left? Wouldn\u2019t she miss the thief then?The girl hadn\u2019t made her decision and Sun Mo was already standing in front of her.\u201cThese are buns that had just come out. Do you want to try one?\u201dSun Mo had casually brought the buns seller with him from the corner of the road. He then took a bite on one of the buns.Lu Zhiruo glanced at the buns and then looked toward Sun Mo, assessing him seriously for the first time.This person wasn\u2019t old, and his teeth were very white. He had a very gentle smile, which contrasted with the worry and reproach in his black eyes.When she saw his gaze landing on her hand, Lu Zhiruo\u2019s face flushed up, and she quickly hid the osmanthus cake behind her back.\u201cAre you going to eat it or not?\u201dThe seller was feeling displeased. If it wasn\u2019t because Sun Mo had paid him a lot of money, he wouldn\u2019t care to make this trip.Pa!Lu Zhiruo quickly took one bun. She gave it some thought, took another, and then suddenly bowed toward Sun Mo.\u201cGive me ten more buns!\u201d Sun Mo said, \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m a teacher at the Central Province Academy.\u201dAfter hearing this, Lu Zhiruo\u2019s big eyes lit up. She instantly became less wary against Sun Mo.\u201cWhy are you sitting here by yourself?\u201dSun Mo stood under the roof, looking at the sky that was filled with dark clouds.Drip! Drip!The raindrops hit the umbrella, producing a deep and stifled sound.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m trying to catch a thief.\u201dAfter eating the hot buns, Lu Zhiruo\u2019s hostility toward Sun Mo dropped even more.\u201cIt\u2019s raining, and there are so few people on the streets. It\u2019s harder to steal in this situation. Thieves would be laying at home and sleeping.\u201dSun Mo wanted to add that given her physique, even if the thief were to appear, she wouldn\u2019t be able to catch him.Strength: 3. You\u2019re really very weak.Intellect: 5. Your brain is still alright, but why do you appear so stupid?Agility: 3. What gave you such a heavy burden?Endurance: 3. Weakling, go and train!\u2026Looking at Lu Zhiruo\u2019s data, Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help but glance toward her chest. He was then astonished. The girl was hugging her small baggage the entire time, blocking her chest. It was only now did Sun Mo notice that her chest was astonishingly big. Did she stuff two papayas in her clothes?\u2018Potential Value: Extremely Low.\u2019\u201cSystem, is it possible to have a lower potential value than this?\u201dSun Mo was speechless. Even Qi Shengjia, whose potential value was extremely low, would be able to spit in contempt when standing in front of this papaya girl. There was probably no one whose data could be as low as hers.\u201cShe already has such big papayas, so why would she need potential value?\u201d the system asked.Sun Mo was stunned from the remark, but he had to agree.\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201dLu Zhiruo sighed and looked toward the cloudy and raining sky. It seemed that she wouldn\u2019t be able to get her money pouch back. At the thought of this, her expression turned sad. \u201cThat\u2019s something my mother left for me!\u201dThe girl\u2019s shoulder trembled and she started sobbing.Sun Mo couldn\u2019t bear to see this and consoled her, \u201cMaybe the thief who stole it is someone hardworking and can\u2019t bear to take a break even on a rainy day.\u201d\u201cRight, right, there\u2019s this possibility!\u201dLu Zhiruo instantly cheered up and kept on nodding.\u201c\u2026\u201dSun Mo thought in his heart. (There\u2019s really no one who can compare with your intelligence. Can you not take someone else\u2019s consolation seriously?)Lu Zhiruo was scared of strangers, timid, and wary. However, once she started talking, she would let her guard down completely. Sun Mo didn\u2019t even try to find things out from her, but she already said a lot.\u201cI came to Jinling to find a great teacher to learn from. But they don\u2019t want me!\u201dLu Zhiruo shared what she had been through and couldn\u2019t help but start crying.(Given your aptitude, they\u2019d be blind to take you in.)Sun Mo shook his head.The rain kept on pouring down, not showing signs of stopping.\u201cWhat are you planning to do next?\u201dIt didn\u2019t make sense for her to keep on waiting out here.\u201cWaiting for the thief.\u201dThere was a hint of stubbornness in Lu Zhiruo\u2019s reply. Moreover, given that she didn\u2019t have any money, there was nowhere she could go to.\u201cYou\u2019re better off going back home earlier.\u201dSun Mo took out his money pouch and pushed it to Lu Zhiruo. If she continued to wait here, she\u2019d probably even lose herself. Then Sun Mo turned around and left.\u201cI can\u2019t take it.\u201dLu Zhiruo chased after Sun Mo, wanting to return the money pouch to him.\u201cTake it as a loan.\u201dSun Mo waved his hand impatiently.\u201cNo. Father said that one shouldn\u2019t get undeserved rewards. Moreover, I\u2019ve already eaten the osmanthus cake and hot buns you gave me.\u201dLu Zhiruo was very stubborn, making a few attempts to stuff the money pouch back to Sun Mo. Then, after making another attempt, she suddenly cried out.\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201dAlthough this word didn\u2019t make any sense, given Sun Mo\u2019s intellect, he immediately understood that Lu Zhiruo was referring to that thief. Therefore, he immediately followed her gaze.A sloppy-looking young man was holding onto an umbrella and staying close behind an auntie.Sun Mo was speechless. (You\u2019re really hardworking. To think that you\u2019re not even taking a break on a rainy day!)\u201cDon\u2019t run, return me my money!\u201d Lu Zhiruo shouted out loud.\u201cIs this what they meant by having big boobs but no brain?\u201dSun Mo had wanted to remind Lu Zhiruo to not alert the thief, but it was too late. Thankfully, his reaction was fast enough and he had already darted out. At the same time, he drew his wooden blade and tossed it out.The young man was a habitual offender. When he heard the cry, he quickly ran toward the closest alley. However, he hadn\u2019t run far off when the sound of slicing wind rang out next to his ear. Then, a wooden blade hit him at the back of his neck.Pa!The young man stumbled from the strike and fell to the ground.Puddles splattered.\u2026After Sun Mo rummaged through the thief\u2019s home, he called the constables to take care of the case.He had to say that with the title of a teacher, things progressed a lot smoother. He watched as a constable broke one of the thief\u2019s legs and then acted very respectful toward him. Sun Mo was very pleased with this outcome.Lu Zhiruo, who was wearing cotton clothes, hugged her small bag and followed behind Sun Mo like she was his tail. As she had managed to find her lost money, she started humming happily.When they were nearing the school gates, Sun Mo turned back.Lu Zhiruo\u2019s head shrank back, her grip on her bag tightened, and her ears also pricked up. She was like a small deer that was listening to any movements, immediately escaping if something was amiss.\u201cHow long are you going to follow me?\u201d Sun Mo asked.Lu Zhiruo avoided Sun Mo\u2019s gaze and mumbled softly, \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201dSun Mo couldn\u2019t understand what Lu Zhiruo was thinking about.\u201cThat\u2026 Teacher Sun, you\u2019re really amazing. How did you know that the thief would come back?\u201dLu Zhiruo blinked her eyes, looking at Sun Mo with an admiring gaze.(How could I have known? I just mentioned it in passing to console you.)Sun Mo couldn\u2019t get himself to speak the truth after seeing the girl\u2019s gaze. He did feel a little proud to have such a beautiful young girl admiring him.\u201cThis is called conjecture!\u201d Sun Mo fabricated a story.\u201cThat\u2019s so amazing!\u201dLu Zhiruo\u2019s eyes gleamed brightly like the stars in the night sky.Ding!+5 favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo initiated. Current state, neutral (5/100)\u201cThat can\u2019t be. You believe this?\u201dSun Mo was speechless. He looked at the girl\u2019s innocent face and suddenly felt that he mustn\u2019t leave things as they were. Otherwise, she\u2019d definitely be swindled.When they entered the school gates, the guard, Mister Qin, put out his head from the window.\u201cTeacher Sun, this is\u2026\u201dFrom the young lady\u2019s dressing, Mister Qin could tell that she was clearly not a student of their school.\u201cMy relative.\u201dSun Mo passed him a packet of tobacco leaves that he had bought a long time ago. Although the guardhouse\u2019s authority was very small, almost at the bottom tier in the school\u2019s hierarchy, it would be beneficial to keep a good relationship with them. Moreover, a packet of tobacco leaves was just about twenty or so coins.\u201cOh, she came to look for you for help? Or is she going to take part in the student recruitment meet?\u201dMister Qin immediately broke into a smile. It was no wonder that Sun Mo could sponge off Headmaster An. He really knew how to conduct himself. Amongst so many intern teachers, he was the first to give him, a guard, a gift.After entering the school and looking at the passing students, Lu Zhiruo felt very anxious. She immediately went up a few steps and followed Sun Mo closer.Intern teachers didn\u2019t have an office, so Sun Mo brought Lu Zhiruo back to the dorm.\u201cThat\u2019s my bed, feel free to take a seat!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo poured a cup of water.\u201cEn!\u201dLu Zhiruo nodded. However, as her clothes were drenched by the rain, she was worried that she\u2019d dirty the sheets. Therefore, she put her bag down by the bed and sat on it.She kept her legs closed tightly and put her hands on her knees, behaving herself.Sun Mo\u2019s impression of the girl improved after seeing this. She was a sensible girl, but he\u2019d still have to ask about her plans. Otherwise, if her family were to come looking for her and blame him for human trafficking, he\u2019d be in trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was her dream.\u201cSo you came out alone by yourself to learn?\u201dSun Mo had some admiration for this girl. On the way back, the two of them chatted a little. He knew that she was from the Sheng Capital, and it would take close to half a month to travel to Jinling by horse carriage. She hadn\u2019t reached 14 years old yet but dared to travel alone. Her guts were admirable.\u201cAhh, uhh.\u201dAt the mention of this, Lu Zhiruo\u2019s countenance immediately turned dim. It hadn\u2019t been easy for her to meet that great teacher, but her aptitude turned out to be too bad, and the great teacher only took a glance at her before waving his hand to send her off. He couldn\u2019t even be bothered to say anything.\u201cThe Central Province Academy\u2019s student recruitment meet will be held the day after tomorrow. You can take a look. You might be able to find a better great teacher then.\u201dSun Mo hoped that Lu Zhiruo could recognize reality and head back home earlier. After all, given her aptitude, even intern teachers might give her the cold shoulder as well.(Although you have breasts, it isn\u2019t any help to your studies!)Sun Mo sighed. If Lu Zhiruo\u2019s breasts could be considered as her aptitude, then she\u2019d be looking down on the rest of the world.\u201cTeacher Sun, you\u2019re a good guy!\u201dLu Zhiruo felt very thankful.Sun Mo had initially planned on letting Lu Zhiruo look for an inn near the school, but she wasn\u2019t willing to do so. Left with no other choice, Sun Mo could only look for Li Gong, who then cleared up a warehouse to let her stay there temporarily.\u201cThis is where I usually rest. No one will come, so feel free to stay here.\u201dLi Gong\u2019s face was full of smiles, afraid that Sun Mo might not be pleased with his service.Sun Mo waved his hand, and Li Gong took his leave. However, before he left, he couldn\u2019t help but throw a glance toward Lu Zhiruo. (Oh my god, the man who marries her in the future would be so fortunate.)\u201cTake this money, you can use it first.\u201dSun Mo took out five silver taels and gave it to Lu Zhiruo. When they had caught the thief and gotten back the loot, he knew that this papaya girl didn\u2019t have much money left. This might be the reason why she refused to stay at an inn.\u201cNo! No!\u201dLu Zhiruo waved her hand and rejected, wearing a horrified expression.\u201cTake it. Are you expecting me to send you food every day?\u201dSun Mo frowned.Seeing that Sun Mo was angry, Lu Zhiruo jumped up like a rabbit whose tail had been stepped on. She explained, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t have that intention!\u201d\u201cThen take it.\u201dSun Mo asked Lu Zhiruo for her home address so he could get someone to come and fetch her. However, when he mentioned this, Lu Zhiruo would lower her head and pretend to be dumb. Therefore, he could only give up on this thought.After returning to the dorm, Sun Mo went through his luggage and realized that he didn\u2019t have much savings left. Therefore, it was important for him to earn money quickly. Otherwise, his standards of living would plummet.If this was in the past, given his educational background, it\u2019d be easy for him to work as a home tutor for a few days. However, he couldn\u2019t do this in Jinling. It was because he hadn\u2019t taken on a permanent role yet.\u201cAm I only left with the choice of writing [Journey to the West]?\u201dTo be honest, Sun Mo didn\u2019t wish to do this. However, he thought of the homeless Lu Zhiruo. He had to help her out, right? This was like he had picked up a lost kitten from the roadside. He had to keep it for a while. If he didn\u2019t even have the money to buy dried fish for its snack, then the kitten would look down on him as well.\u201cThat\u2019ll settle it then. It\u2019s better to write \u2018Journey to the West\u2019 than to become a masseur!\u201dThe ancient massage technique was very amazing, and he could definitely be a world-class masseur. However, Sun Mo felt that if he were to do this, the system would definitely be the first to die from laughter.The morning sunlight had just appeared when Ludi carried a bowl of soup and a plate of pig trotters, leaving the dorm. Teacher Zhou Shanyi\u2019s impression of him was quite good. As long as he continued to keep things up, he\u2019d definitely be able to get an \u2018excellent-grade\u2019 rating. It\u2019d increase his chances of being able to stay in school.The only thing he wasn\u2019t happy about was the teacher\u2019s rating on his braised meat. What did he mean when he said that it\u2019d be better if Ludi were to add some goji berries and caterpillar fungus?\u00a0That would be heterodoxy. It\u2019d spoil the natural taste of the braised meat.Moreover, only middle-aged people would drink goji berries steeped in water. (You\u2019re already an old man and no longer need that. Even if you were to eat goji berries every day as you would rice, you\u2019d still age and slowly lose strength.)At the thought of this, Ludi couldn\u2019t help but increase his force exertion in his arms, being narcissist of his healthy body that was filled with vitality, and then\u2026He felt gloomy. A papaya girl was sitting on the ground, leaning against the wall. She propped her legs up and hugged them with her arms. With her head resting on her knees, she slept comfortably.Glistening saliva trickled down the corners of her lips, landing on her pants. It made a huge wet patch on it.\u201cWould you guys cut it out?\u201dLudi felt that Zhang Sheng and Sun Mo were truly shameless. To think that they\u2019d spend money on actors to boost their reputation so that they could stay back in school. He, on the other hand, was very upright.At the thought of this, Ludi felt that the braised meat he was holding became even more fragrant.\u201cUh?\u201dLu Zhiruo rubbed her eyes, looking up with a dazed expression. As she had been sitting there for too long, her shoulders felt a little sore. She instinctively shook and rubbed them, moving her body.\u201cOh my god!\u201d Ludi almost screamed out. Was this the legendary child-like complexion? \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for Teacher Sun, Sun Mo!\u201dLu Zhiruo quickly stood up. After saying that, she even bowed. \u201cHello Teacher!\u201dLudi was stunned. He hadn\u2019t been called a teacher before. Everyone would refer to him as \u2018Teaching Assistant Lu\u2019, and it somehow sounded like the words \u2018pig trotter braiser\u2019. Other than making Ludi feel upset, this title also made him swear that he\u2019d become a substitute teacher as soon as possible, followed by the yearly teacher-in-charge and then a great teacher. He would then get the intern teachers to braise pig trotters for him.To suddenly be called a teacher by a student, Ludi felt as if he had drunk iced sour plum soup on the hottest day of the year. The feeling of exhilaration went right down into his bones.\u201cSun Mo, someone\u2019s looking for you!\u201dLudi shouted out and then flashed a smile that he had been practicing for a while. \u201cI am Ludi. If you have any problems in the future, you can come to ask me.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no\u2026 no need. Teacher Sun can help me with my questions!\u201dLu Zhiruo backed off a step and lowered her head. This teacher\u2019s smile was so scary. She could even see the chives stuck in the back of his teeth.(Hey, hey, do you think I don\u2019t want any face to be rejecting me so quickly?) Ludi\u2019s passion was like the sandcastle on the beach that was washed away by the waves.(Hmph. You look at me in contempt right now, but in the future, I\u2019d be at a level too high for you to reach!)Ludi thought in his heart and then turned to leave. However, he had only taken a few steps away when he turned back, throwing a glance at Lu Zhiruo\u2019s chest.Sun Mo attached the wooden blade at his waist and walked out of the dorm.Lu Zhiruo hid behind a pillar and looked around, afraid that another guy she didn\u2019t know would come out. When she saw that it was Sun Mo, she jumped out with a peace of mind, bowing and greeting him.Sun Mo ran two rounds around the Sorrowless Lake. After warming up, he practiced the first level of the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art.Lu Zhiruo was like a small tail, following him in what he was doing. Sun Mo hesitated for a moment but didn\u2019t stop her.By the time he had started to sweat a little and more people were coming to the lakeside, Sun Mo stopped. It was going to be the peak hour at the canteen soon. If he didn\u2019t go now, it\u2019d be squeezy there.Someone handed a towel to him.Sun Mo turned and saw the girl, who was still dressed in her green clothes, standing under the sun and passing him the towel respectfully with both hands.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do these things!\u201dAlthough Sun Mo said that, he still took the towel from her and wiped off the perspiration on his forehead.Lu Zhiruo then took out a bamboo cylinder from her bag. After pouring out a cup of water and passing it to Sun Mo, she took the used towel, not saying a word in the entire process.The fragrance of meat buns was permeating the second level of the canteen.\u201cAre you hungry?\u201dSun Mo looked around.Lu Zhiruo nodded subconsciously and then quickly shook her head.Gurgle~Lu Zhiruo\u2019s stomach started growling, making her feel extremely awkward. Her face was instantly flushed up all the way to her neck.The papaya girl lowered her head, and her two slender index fingers were rubbing against the corner of her clothes uneasily. She was like a quail that had been captured.\u201cGo get what you want to eat!\u201dSun Mo threw his employment pass to Lu Zhiruo and headed toward a table next to a window. \u201cI\u2019ll have porridge and salted vegetables. If there are hotteoks, then get me one.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201dLu Zhiruo took the employment pass and quickly ran toward the porridge stall.All the teachers in the Central Province Academy had an employment pass. It was a small wooden token that was the size of one\u2019s palm. Other than allowing one to use places such as the martial lecture hall and the Meditation Dojo for free, there\u2019d also be discounts when one showed it when buying meals and other things.Lu Zhiruo was holding onto Sun Mo\u2019s employment pass and thus would be able to enjoy the discounts. This caused the corners of her lips to curl up, giving her the urge to touch the money pouch in her pocket that was almost empty.After having breakfast, Sun Mo went to the library. He looked for a secluded spot and started writing [Journey to the West]. For fear that she\u2019d disturb Sun Mo, Lu Zhiruo took a seat slightly further away from him.Sun Mo had read the Four Classic Novels many times in the past. He felt that out of them [Journey to the West] was the most obscure one in its writing. He remembered all the stories, but he couldn\u2019t replicate it word by word. Therefore, he used his own language to reproduce the story in which Tang Sanzang went on a mission to seek holy scriptures.\u201cShould I make Wukong wilder?\u201dAs the first chapter was done, Sun Mo was a little uncertain if he\u2019d be able to earn his first bucket of gold with it. Although he had tried to make it sound more like ancient literature, it was still too straightforward when compared to the novels in the market now. However, since he couldn\u2019t find other methods to earn quick bucks, he could only continue with his writing.Thankfully, Sun Mo also enjoyed writing in his free time. This wasn\u2019t something difficult for him.Lu Zhiruo was bored just sitting there and planned to take a few books to read. However, after taking a look around the library, he realized that she had read almost all of them before and didn\u2019t like the remaining ones. She came back empty-handed. Not daring to disturb Sun Mo, she placed both hands on her knees and sat upright, being so well-behaved as if she was a cat.The summer wind blew past the window, sending one of the manuscripts to her. She had long since felt curious about what Sun Mo was doing and thus glanced over.\u201cThe Flowerfruit Mountain is a place of good fortune, and the Water Curtain Cave presented a whole new world?\u201dLu Zhiruo continued reading. (This is a story of a monkey, but is it possible for a monkey to come out from a stone? That\u2019s so mysterious! Hmm, isn\u2019t Teacher Sun\u2019s choice of words too straightforward?)Lu Zhiruo felt that she\u2019d be able to do a better job than Sun Mo. However, she couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away from the manuscript. It was because this monkey was really interesting. It was just a beast, but it dared to call itself the \u2018Monkey King\u2019. What arrogance.Lu Zhiruo put aside the copy of the manuscript and then glanced toward Sun Mo. She then secretly inched closer, reached out her hand, and took another piece.Distressing journey to the west, the birth of the Monkey King.Traveling the world in search of immortality!Lu Zhiruo continued reading. When she reached out again and touched nothing, she quickly realized that she had finished reading through all the manuscripts.\u201cThere\u2019s no more?\u201dLu Zhiruo was disappointed and subconsciously looked toward Sun Mo. He was also looking at her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euClank!Lu Zhiruo instantly got up in shock, but because she moved too quickly, her knees scraped against the table. It hurt a lot.\u201cOuch!\u201dLu Zhiruo gasped but quickly greeted, \u201cTeacher Sun!\u201dThe papaya girl then turned her gaze toward the manuscript in front of Sun Mo, subconsciously reaching out her hand. She had a strong yearning to read it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Won\u2019t I be able to read it openly then?\u201dLu Zhiruo clenched her small fists and knocked her head. She was so stupid.Swoosh!A golden halo suddenly extended out in the library, bringing forth some noises in the initially quiet atmosphere.\u201cIt\u2019s a great teacher halo!\u201dLu Zhiruo looked around and saw a handsome young man walking in. He waved his hand to get everyone to continue with their learning.\u201cHe\u2019s called Qin Fen, a graduate from Jixia Learning Palace, one of the top nine renowned schools. Do you want to have him as your teacher?\u201dSun Mo assessed Qin Fen. What high EQ. He had released the \u2018Wide Learning and Retentive Memory\u2019 halo in the library. Not only would this leave a favorable impression on the students\u2019 hearts, but it would also spread his name. His way of doing things was a lot better when compared to Zhang Sheng who only knew how to build up his reputation by bribing students.Of course, the great teacher halo was something that could only be gained through enlightenment and not learned. Even if Zhang Sheng wished to do this, he was unable to.Sun Mo was unable to replicate this act either. The \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 halo could increase the weight of his words, allowing the students to be influenced for a while. However, he hadn\u2019t grasped it completely yet; thus, it would only work at times. As for the \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019, it was a great teacher halo that was purely punishment in nature. If he were to throw it out here, he\u2019d definitely bring about a great commotion, and he\u2019d then be fired.\u201cNo!\u201dLu Zhiruo shook her head without any hesitation.\u201cYou don\u2019t look up to him? From what I heard, many students want to become his personal disciple.\u201dSun Mo was surprised by how decisive Lu Zhiruo was. For students who didn\u2019t have a good aptitude, there was no chance for them to study under a great teacher. Therefore, Qin Fen\u2019s reputation as a graduate from a renowned school was very tempting. It wouldn\u2019t be bad to be his personal disciple.\u201cIt\u2019s not about his capabilities. I just don\u2019t like the scent of him!\u201d Lu Zhiruo explained.\u201cHuh?\u201dSun Mo was stunned and he subconsciously sniffed. There didn\u2019t seem to be any other smell other than that of ink? (Moreover, are you really able to smell it despite being over 30 meters away from him?)\u201cTeacher Sun smells better.\u201dLu Zhiruo smiled sweetly, flashing her dimples.\u201cHaha.\u201dSun Mo couldn\u2019t help but pat Lu Zhiruo on the head when he saw how docile she was.The papaya girl didn\u2019t doge but squinted her eyes slightly. She tilted her head a little and rubbed it against his hand. Her hand then reached out toward the manuscript on the table.Did that monkey obtain the art of immortality? She really wanted to read it!\u2026The sky was slowly turning bright. Yan Li, who usually liked to sleep in, got up. After washing up, he changed into a clean set of uniforms.\u201cIt\u2019s such a pity. Why can\u2019t we wear the clothes we brought from home? Who would be able to tell that I come from a rich family like this?\u201dYan Li felt gloomy as he looked into the mirror. But that didn\u2019t matter. He put on his jade bracelet and then rolled up his sleeves just so that the bracelet would be revealed discreetly.The true way of doing things was to flaunt your wealth in a low-profile manner.It wasn\u2019t as if Yan Li wanted to hitch up with girls, but that he wanted to become Qin Fen\u2019s student. He knew that his aptitude was mediocre, but he could make it up with his wealth.After all, cultivation required the depletion of a tremendous amount of resources, and money could be used to purchase some resources. Otherwise, if one were to rely on their own cultivation, how long would they take before they managed to achieve anything?\u201cYan Li, you\u2019ll definitely be able to succeed.\u201dYan Li gave himself some encouragement. Today was the day of the student recruitment meet. Many teachers who were hard to meet would appear, and there would even be great teachers amongst them. However, Yan Li felt that he might not have such a chance to be chosen by them.At the thought of this, Yan Li felt very gloomy. However, when he turned and saw Qi Shengjia, who was just getting up from his bed, he felt a sense of superiority.\u201cA salted fish!\u201dYan Li wore a contemptuous smile. It was degrading to share the same dorm with trash like him. Was he not leaving school? Why was he still not doing anything?Over the past two days, Yan Li would hope to see Qi Shengjia\u2019s bed being emptied every time he returned to the dorm. He had even had the delusion that this pauper would flee away sheepishly like a loser, but he would be disappointed every time.\u201cI must get a great teacher this year!\u201dWang Hao clenched his fist.\u201cSigh, Shengjia has entered the battle hall. His chances are a lot greater than ours.\u201dZhou Xu felt emotional and couldn\u2019t help but be a little jealous. Previously, he was in a position in which he could look down on Qi Shengjia. However, now that Qi Shengjia had overtaken him, he naturally felt slightly uncomfortable.\u201cZhou Xu, who did you say has gotten into the battle hall?\u201dYan Li frowned. Had he heard wrongly?\u201cIt\u2019s Qi Shengjia. Didn\u2019t you know that?\u201dWang Hao was a little envious as well.\u201cHaha, is it fun to lie to me?\u201dYan Li let out a stifled laugh and then glanced at Qi Shengjia from the corners of his eyes. \u201cIf some trash of the 4th-level of the body-refinement realm could get into the battle hall, then wouldn\u2019t I be able to become its lecturer?\u201d\u201cShengjia, show him your battle hall\u2019s identity plate.\u201d Wang Hao teased, \u201cBy the way, Sheng Jia is at 5th-level of the body-refinement realm, not 4th-level.\u2019\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d Yan Li cried out and assessed Qi Shengjia dubiously. \u201cEven if you want to lie, you should be more serious about it. I would believe that he can get up to 4th-level. After all, anyone could have a streak of good luck. But 5th-level\u2026 Would a guy who\u2019s so poor that he has to wear a pair of holey socks be able to afford peak-grade medicine?\u201dWang Hao and Zhou Xu exchanged a glance and suddenly appeared astonished. If a cultivator wished to advance, other than putting in effort into their cultivation, the other method was to take peak-grade medicine for additional nourishments. However, these alchemical pills were all very expensive.Even Qi Shengjia\u2019s father couldn\u2019t bear to buy them. So, did Sun Mo, who was completely unrelated to Qi Shengjia, have so much money to waste on him? It could only mean that Sun Mo\u2019s Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands was very amazing.Ding!+20 favorable impression points from Wang Hao.Prestige connection with Wang Hao: Neutral (73/100).Ding!+16 favorable impression points from Zhou Xu.Prestige connection with Zhou Xu: Neutral (41/100).Sun Mo immediately received favorable impression points from two students. This gave him a feeling of exhilaration as if he had picked up a money pouch. However, this Zhou Xu clearly didn\u2019t have much admiration for him.\u2026\u201cHow about it? You don\u2019t have anything else to say, right?\u201d Yan Li sounded very proud. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t remember wrongly, your opponent was Peng Wanli, who is at 6th-level of the body-refinement realm. Even if you\u2019re at 5th-level, you won\u2019t be able to win against him!\u201dWang Hao couldn\u2019t be bothered to answer him. He took out Qi Shengjia\u2019s plate and threw it over.Pa!Yan Li immediately took it and was then stunned. Qi Shengjia\u2019s name was written in gold on the black wooden token. There wasn\u2019t any sense of aesthetics to it, but after seeing it, Yan Li was so astonished that he was speechless.This was something Yan Li wanted and even dreamed of but couldn\u2019t get. Even worse, now it appeared in the hands of an inferior student.\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201dYan Li screamed as if a thick mace was pierced into his butt, and his voice broke. He clutched onto the plate tightly, trying to console himself by saying that this was a fake. However, he was unable to do so. It was because he had seen a battle hall\u2019s plate that belonged to a good friend. He had spent a lot of money to treat that person to a meal.\u201cShengjia won against Peng Wanli despite the difference in their level. Moreover, Teacher Jin Mujie even gave him praise in front of everyone, saying that Shengjia\u2019s Skywolf Fist is quite good and that he has reached a small achievement in it.\u201dZhou Xu helped to speak up for Qi Shengjia as the former would still need the latter\u2019s help in the future. In the past, although Zhou Xu didn\u2019t like Yan Li, he would definitely not scoff at him.\u201cImpossible!\u201dYan Li denied this possibility without even giving it any further thought. A great teacher\u2019s judgment was very high, so why would they praise Qi Shengjia?\u201cYou can just go and find out from others! Many of them saw the battle with their own eyes.\u201dWang Hao urged. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Today\u2019s a big day.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Yan Li couldn\u2019t understand. (How did a salted fish manage to turn the tables around? Could it be that he encountered a great teacher? But why would a great teacher be so free as to bother with such a trashy student?\u00a0That won\u2019t do. I must find out the truth behind this.)Qi Shengjia pursed his lips and clenched his fists tightly. He wasn\u2019t good with words and thus wasn\u2019t able to scoff at Yan Li. However, when he saw Yan Li\u2019s countenance changing from blue to red repeatedly after taking the plate, Qi Shengjia felt that all the humiliation he had experienced over the past three years had been washed away.Qi Shengjia smiled and reached out his hand. \u201cHave you seen enough? If you have, then return it to me. I\u2019ll be heading to the student recruitment meet.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dYan Li almost died from fury. He wanted to rebut, saying \u2018who would care for a lousy plate like this?\u2019 But he wasn\u2019t able to say it. It was because he really wanted it!Qi Shengjia left the dorm, and he hadn\u2019t left far away when he heard banging sounds coming from it. He didn\u2019t have to ask. It must be Yan Li venting his frustrations by smashing stuff to the ground.\u201cThank you, Teacher Sun Mo!\u201dQi Shengjia had heartfelt gratitude toward Sun Mo. In the 15 years of his life, he had never been able to walk with his head held up high like this before. And all of this was what Sun Mo had given him.Ding!+50 favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia. Current state, friendly (408/1,000).Sun Mo, who was cultivating the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art by the Sorrowless Lake, received a notification from the system. It was really a case of sitting at home but money was coming down from the sky.(Qi Shengjia, you can do it!)Sun Mo hadn\u2019t expected that Qi Shengjia would contribute so many points. Honest people were really reliable. If you were to treat them well, they\u2019d thank you for life.For a short instant, Sun Mo had thought of taking Qi Shengjia as his personal disciple. After all, he\u2019d be able to gain a tremendous amount of points, but he immediately dismissed this thought.There was no other way out. Qi Shengjia\u2019s potential value was extremely low, and it was destined that he wouldn\u2019t be able to gain much in life. How could he let a student like him be his first disciple?Even salted fish had dreams!Sun Mo was still planning on producing a few great swordsmen, saber saints, or people like that.Turning his head, Sun Mo then looked toward Lu Zhiruo whose potential value was extremely low. However, the first thing that he saw was her pair of papaya breasts.They were really too big and would be seen with just a casual glimpse.Sun Mo hesitated. He felt that if Lu Zhiruo wanted him to be her teacher, he\u2019d definitely not reject her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIs this discrimination?\u201dThe system clearly guessed what Sun Mo was thinking.\u201cRubbish. Big boobs are just. What\u2019s wrong with sticking firmly by justice?\u201dSun Mo retorted, speaking as if he had a righteous stand. He then took the water the papaya girl had passed to him and drank it up. He couldn\u2019t help but think that if he were to do this in No.2 High School, he\u2019d be reported to the Ministry of Education the next day, suspended from his job, and received investigation.\u201cDing! Please recruit five students from the student recruitment meet. If you fail, there\u2019ll be a punishment!\u201d The system issued a mission.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The lowest-tier reward would be one black-iron treasure chest.\u201dSun Mo was about to ask what the system would do if he were to ignore everything and randomly recruit five students with the weakest aptitude. However, the system covered that.It didn\u2019t leave any loopholes.It had just passed eight in the morning, but the number of people in the school was bustling. Most of them were teenagers who were about 12 years old. There was uneasiness, curiosity, and yearning in their youthful faces.Entering a reputable school, meeting a great teacher, and becoming a character who was renowned in the world was the dream of almost every youngster.\u201cThere are so many people!\u201dLu Zhiruo grabbed onto Sun Mo\u2019s sleeve tightly. She was very scared of strangers. If it wasn\u2019t because she wanted to accompany Sun Mo, she would have escaped back to her room, closed the door tightly, and then locked it.Everyone, both male and female, would throw Lu Zhiruo a glimpse when they passed by her. It was inevitable because her papayas were too big. In addition to her child-like face, the killing prowess was tremendous.\u201cTeacher Sun!\u201dLu Zhiruo was very nervous. She buried herself into Sun Mo\u2019s arm without realizing it. Why were all these people looking at her? Had she not washed her face properly this morning? Or did something get stuck in his teeth?\u201cWhy don\u2019t we head back?\u201d Lu Zhiruo mumbled softly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t take this opportunity to train your courage, what are you going to do in the future? Why are you shrinking your head back just because you see other people? Are you an ostrich?\u201dSun Mo tugged Lu Zhiruo\u2019s arm away.\u201cOuch!\u201dLu Zhiruo instinctively wanted to grab onto his arm again. However, she hesitated a little, worried that she\u2019d be reproached. Therefore, she put out her fingers and pinched the clothes on his waist.The schools in Middle-Earth\u2019s nine provinces were all managed by the Saint Gate, and they could be classified into five grades.There were only nine Supreme Academies, and they were known as the Nine Greats, as well as the Aristocratic Schools.Below them, there were 18 \u2018A\u2019 grade schools, 36 \u2018B\u2019 grade schools, 72 \u2018C\u2019 grade schools, and 108 \u2018D\u2019 Grade schools.These 5 grades were followed by over 1,000 schools that weren\u2019t included in the grading.All in all, a total of 243 schools were listed in these five grades, and they could be given the title of famous schools.Every year, all schools of the same grade would head to the Darkness Continent and participate in a league tournament. Then, based on their rankings, the top five schools would rise to participate in the higher grade tournament. Respectively, the five schools ranked at the bottom would go down by one grade.Over 1,000 schools that weren\u2019t included in the five grades would compete for ten positions. Then, after passing the Saint Gate\u2019s test, they would get the qualification rights and could advance to the \u2018D\u2019 Grade league tournament to obtain the title of a famous school.At the same time, the ten schools that were ranked at the bottom of the \u2018D\u2019 Grade would be downgraded and lose their title.The two most renowned schools in Tang Country\u2019s Jinling City were firstly the Central Province Academy and secondly the Myriad Daos Academy that had risen in the recent ten years.In the past, the Central Province Academy would be the first target of many students, but things had completely reversed in the past few years. However, compared to the other non-graded schools, the Central Province Academy still retained its title as a \u2018famous school\u2019 at least. It had a glorious history and was situated in the flourishing Jinling City. These added bonus points, and thus it was the second option of some students.Schools that wished to advance to a higher grade would have to obtain good results in the league tournament and be ranked in the top five.How could they raise the rankings?Of course, it was through having outstanding students represent the school to take part in the competition. For this, it was necessary to have a supply of students with outstanding aptitude.An Xinhui had been on this job for three years and had put in a lot of effort in this area. However, the returns were very small. Most of the good students had been snatched by the Myriad Daos Academy. After all, the Myriad Daos Academy was a \u2018C\u2019 grade school that was one grade higher than the Central Province Academy.After understanding the education system in the nine provinces, Sun Mo was filled with emotions. He thought of how the housing prices in the school district had skyrocketed, but not many people were willing to sell their houses. It was because having houses in the school district meant that they had the right to enter a good school.However, there was only one condition that determined if one could enter a famous school or not\u2014 your aptitude and not your father\u2019s money.Although these students might be leftovers from others\u2019 picks, Sun Mo believed that there\u2019d be pearls amongst them. With his Divine Sight, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him to unearth five or even ten of them.However, after roaming around for one hour, Sun Mo felt gloomy. He didn\u2019t even see a single student with a high potential value, let alone someone with an extremely high potential value like Li Ziqi.\u201cTeacher, you can\u2019t do things like this.\u201dLu Zhiruo was very anxious. She was worried that Sun Mo wouldn\u2019t be able to get a single student after the three days were over.\u201cSystem, how did you measure the potential value of a person?\u201d Sun Mo asked.\u201cThe overall assessment of the target\u2019s current condition, as well as the system\u2019s expectations of the target\u2019s future.\u201dThe system\u2019s reply was very generic, giving Sun Mo the urge to give it a beating.\u201cThis means that the greater your anticipation is, the higher their potential value would be?\u201d Sun Mo analyzed.\u201cYes. But a student with an extremely high potential value might also become mediocre because they didn\u2019t get the guidance of a great teacher. Misguidance might lead to the destruction of a genius.\u201dHaving a high potential value meant that one had a high growth possibility. It represented the successful future they might have.\u201cTeacher, you must take the initiative!\u201dLu Zhiruo thought that Sun Mo was unable to lower his standard. But since he was so young and lacked experience, he could only go head-on if he wished to take the first step.Even though the teachers were picking the students, the students also wanted to find a teacher who could stimulate their potential.\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry.\u201dSun Mo rubbed his eyes. He was starting to feel a little tired and decided to sit down by the flowerbed. It was tiring for the eyes to keep on using Divine Sight.Another half an hour passed by, and he still didn\u2019t get any success. Lu Zhiruo was starting to feel very anxious. Seeing that Sun Mo still had no intention of approaching the students, she clenched her teeth, summoned her courage, and ran toward a female student.\u201cHe\u2026 Hello. Are you planning to enroll in a school? Can you consider Teacher Sun Mo?\u201dLu Zhiruo bowed and then finished her words while trembling.\u201cHim? He\u2019s too young!\u201d The female student rejected her.Lu Zhiruo didn\u2019t give up. She ran toward a second female student and asked the same question.\u201cHow long has he been a teacher for?\u201dThe female student assessed Sun Mo. This young man looked quite handsome, and when the sunlight shone down on his face, it gave him a cool aura. This met her aesthetic requirements.\u201cHold on!\u201dLu Zhiruo quickly ran back to ask Sun Mo.\u201cOver a month, currently on an internship!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t hide anything.\u201cHuh?\u201dLu Zhiruo was stunned when she heard this. She felt that the level of difficulty had suddenly increased by many folds. This fact discouraged her a lot when she walked back toward that female student.As expected, after the female student heard that, she shook her head, took a final look at Sun Mo, and then left.Even a female student who placed a great emphasis on looks wouldn\u2019t pick an intern teacher who lacked experience.Lu Zhiruo stood on the spot, struggled for a moment, and then decided to continue helping Sun Mo. What if there were students who didn\u2019t care that he was an intern teacher?She continued to stop a third female student. However, this time around, the student\u2019s question was very domineering. \u201cAre you his student? How are his teaching capabilities?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201dLu Zhiruo stuttered and turned her head back pitifully, looking at Sun Mo for help.\u201cShe\u2019s not my student.\u201dSun Mo stood up. This female student was willing to ask this question, meaning that she valued the teacher\u2019s capabilities more than their status. It was just that before he could give a self-introduction, the female student continued to question him.\u201cShe must trust you a lot to be helping you like this, but why don\u2019t you take her as your disciple? Is it because you don\u2019t wish to waste her aptitude? Or does she think that you aren\u2019t worthy? Regardless of which it is, they both prove that your capabilities are limited!\u201dThe female student looked straight at Sun Mo. She was very gutsy and forceful.\u201cOh, interesting!\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t angered but had his interest pique instead due to her logical conjecture. He activated his Divine Sight and observed her.\u2018Ying Baiwu, 13 years old.\u2019Strength: 7. Top-notch amongst those from the same age group.Intellect: 7. Top-notch amongst those from the same age group.Agility: 7. Top-notch amongst those from the same age group.Will: 7. Top-notch amongst those from the same age group.Endurance: 7. Top-notch amongst those from the same age group.\u2018Potential Value: Low\u2019\u2018Remark, possesses a huge flaw and is not recommended to be taken in as a disciple. Please keep your distance from her.\u2019\u2026Sun Mo looked at Ying Baiwu\u2019s data and was speechless. He wanted to drag the system out and give it a beating. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that you\u2019re being contradictory? No matter how you look at it, this data should be matched with a high potential value, right?\u201d\u201cThe system is never wrong!\u201dThe system added emphasis on the word \u2018never\u2019.Sun Mo fell silent and stared at the \u2018remark\u2019. Her flaw must be the thing that lowered her potential value.\u201c10,000 taels!\u201d Ying Baiwu spoke up.\u201cWhat?\u201dSun Mo heard her clearly but didn\u2019t understand what she meant.\u201cGive me 10,000 taels and I\u2019ll be your personal disciple.\u201d Ying Baiwu gave a quote.Lu Zhiruo was so surprised that her mouth was wide-open. This was something that could be sold for money? This was the first time she even heard that!\u201cI\u2019m a pauper.\u201dSun Mo rejected her.\u201cSorry to bother you!\u201dYing Baiwu turned to leave decisively.Sun Mo looked at Ying Baiwu\u2019s clothes that looked old from repeated washing, and the image that appeared in his mind was her pale and lean face. She was poor.Lu Zhiruo was hesitant to speak up.\u201cDon\u2019t look for people anymore.\u201dAlthough all the students that Lu Zhiruo had approached had low potential value, he appreciated her help. She had been extremely nervous even when speaking with girls.As a teacher who had come into contact with many students before, Sun Mo knew that Lu Zhiruo had a fear of strangers. She would feel nervous if she had to come into contact with them. This whole time, she was breaking out in a sweat, and she might even have a strong urge to pee. This was a psychological illness.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLu Zhiruo looked at Sun Mo worriedly, wanting to ask him what would happen to him if he couldn\u2019t recruit any students.\u201cYou\u2019re a good girl!\u201dSun Mo rubbed Lu Zhiruo on the head. He liked such well-behaved students. She had summoned a lot of courage to approach the three girls from earlier.\u201cIf\u2026 if you don\u2019t mind that my aptitude is too weak\u2026\u201dAfter saying that, Lu Zhiruo threw a glance timidly at Sun Mo and then lowered her head. She drew small circles with the tip of her toes and mumbled softly, \u201cThen why not take me as your personal disciple?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31: Being AppreciatedLordbluefireLordbluefire\u201cDo you know what this sentence signifies?\u201dSun Mo felt a little touched as he looked at the papaya girl in front of him who was wearing green clothes and had a pair of innocent eyes.Lu Zhiruo still had her head lowered and spoke as soft as a mosquito, \u201cI know.\u201dIn Middle-Earth\u2019s Nine Provinces, it was a tradition to honor and respect your teacher. Once a student had acknowledged a master, they should not change their affiliation easily. If they were to acknowledge multiple masters, they would be condemned universally.Because of this tradition, as long as the teachers had some ethics, they would not take personal disciples easily. But once they took a student in, they would teach with patience.\u201cBe happier, I am not so pathetic to the extent where you have to sympathize with me!\u201dSun Mo rubbed Lu Zhiruo\u2019s hair. Under normal circumstances, internships had to last a full year before the school decided whether the intern teacher stayed or left.As Gu Xiuxun\u2019s performance was overly superior, the school had promised her that as long as an intern teacher could recruit five students, they would be able to become substitute teachers and join the faculty officially. In the past, intern teachers like Sun Mo would never be qualified to recruit students at all.\u201cBut\u2026 But.. You are a nice person!\u201dPatter! Patter!Tears dripped down Lu Zhiruo\u2019s eyes. She would never forget the day when she lost her money pouch. The memory of how she sat alone for two days and one night amid the pouring rain was still vivid.She was staring blankly at the Qinhuai river in front of her; the whole world seemed to have turned dark. At that moment, she had planned to jump off a few times at least.It was Sun Mo, the teacher with a good-looking smile, who gave her a sweet osmanthus cake, some piping hot meat buns, and a shelter over her head.As Sun Mo was a kind man, Lu Zhiruo didn\u2019t want to see Sun Mo end up empty-handed.\u201cI know you are worried about me, but you don\u2019t have to give me a good person card, you know?\u201dSun Mo opened up the wrapper of a pear blossom candy and stuffed the candy into her mouth.\u201cAh!\u201dLu Zhiruo was at a loss.A young man with a big nose came over. After looking left and right, he then lifted his shirt placket and said, \u201cYou are a teacher, right? Do you want some students\u2019 information?\u201dSun Mo almost lifted his leg to kick the guy had he not spoken fast enough. Sun Mo thought that they had met a pervert as there had always been a flasher near No. 2 High School who harassed female students after their self-study sessions at night.Lu Zhiruo was startled when she saw a stranger come near. She quickly ducked behind Sun Mo and clenched onto his sleeve tightly.When the big-nose guy saw Sun Mo\u2019s unfriendly gaze, he didn\u2019t dare to spout any nonsense and went straight to the point. \u201cDo you want this? Five hundred taels of silver for one booklet. It has a record of every famous child in Jinling city and its nearby area.\u201dSun Mo was speechless when he saw how people came up with such methods to earn money.The big-nose guy flipped open a booklet and presented it to Sun Mo. \u201cHere, you can see their surnames, hometowns, capabilities, and even what they are famous for.\u201d\u201cHow many people are there?\u201dSun Mo reached his hand out for the booklet, but the big-nose guy took it back just as fast.\u201cFive hundred people.\u201d After his reply, the big-nose guy quickly explained further, knowing that the number was too little. \u201cThe student recruitment meet only lasts for three days, and it\u2019s already considered good if you manage to interact with two hundred students. Hence, even though the name list is short, it\u2019s sufficient.\u201d\u201cToo expensive!\u201dSun Mo shook his head.\u201cOh, my great teacher, you can earn money easily by teaching a few classes. But we? We have to run our legs apart to collect these names, and all we hope is to earn some cash these few days!\u201dThe big-nose guy complained tearfully.\u201cOne hundred taels of silver!\u201dSun Mo bargained.\u201cThat\u2019s too little, four hundred and fifty taels of silver!\u201dThe big-nose guy requoted a price.\u201cOne hundred taels of silver!\u201dSun Mo was persistent.\u201cFour hundred taels of silver! Look how much weight I lost this year by living on the streets and having nothing to eat!\u201dThe big-nose guy insisted.Lu Zhiruo stared with her jaw dropped. She was swept off her feet after hearing how the price was bargained to one hundred and fifty taels.She wished she had such bargaining skills!She could have saved some money here and there to buy more pear blossom candies!\u201cOne hundred and twenty taels of silver! It cannot go any lower than this.\u201dThe big-nose guy cried out.\u201cForget it then!\u201dSun Mo turned and walked away.\u201cEh?\u201dThe big-nose guy was stunned. How could Sun Mo not have persisted? He was almost removing his pants, but Sun Mo still wanted to leave. Thus, the big-nose guy could not let this go and chased after Sun Mo.\u201cFine fine fine, one hundred taels of silver!\u201dThe big-nose guy put up a performance where he shed tears.\u201cFifty taels of silver!\u201dSun Mo continued to re-quote the price.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dThe big-nose guy trembled with rage. He would have spat on Sun Mo\u2019s face if he was not in the territory of Central Province Academy. He thought to himself. Sun Mo might as well kill him if he wanted to bargain to this extent.\u201cI\u2019ll take it for one hundred taels of silver.\u201dWith this timely interruption by a middle-aged man, the big-nose guy\u2019s raging expression started to beam. He received the money and went away.Lu Zhiruo cowered behind Sun Mo\u2019s back again.The middle-aged man was square-faced with dashing eyebrows. Even as he smiled, an imposing aura was emitted out of him.\u201cYoung man, don\u2019t be stingy when it\u2019s time to invest.\u201dThe square-faced guy advised.\u201cI\u2019m poor.\u201dSun Mo spoke back with anger and thought to himself, who was this guy? Did people even know him? Who was he to lecture Sun Mo?Lu Zhiruo tugged at Sun Mo\u2019s sleeves and reminded softly, \u201cTeacher, I think he\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cHehe, young man, don\u2019t lose yourself for the sake of winning.\u201dThe square-faced guy was warning Sun Mo but had his eyes fixed on Lu Zhiruo.Wham!Lu Zhiruo cowered behind Sun Mo instantly. This middle-aged man was very imposing, how scary!\u201cJust ask around casually and you\u2019ll find out who these famous children are. Don\u2019t even waste your effort in checking. I believe that some schools have collected such information or have even sent it to their teachers,\u201d said Sun Mo coldly.Even though Sun Mo had never seen An Xinhui before, as an honor graduate of Heavenly Mystery Academy, she was considered a genius of the century. If she hadn\u2019t been scheming, how could she have revitalized Central Province Academy?The square-faced guy raised his head and measured Sun Mo with his eyes while flipping through the booklet. He had thought that Sun Mo couldn\u2019t bear to spend some money, but he never knew that Sun Mo had such deep thinking.\u201cEven if you\u2019re right, you don\u2019t have the information, do you?\u201d said Lu Zhiruo. She didn\u2019t get it. \u201cOr are you going to ask the principal for it?\u201d\u201cI mean, if everyone could collect such crucial information, then this recruitment meet won\u2019t have any value left. Besides, all the schools would have sent some scouts to examine good seedlings, and these seedlings would surely receive an invitation after their aptitude was confirmed,\u201d said Sun Mo.He had seen many such occurrences. When normal students had not even started researching the school and their majors, Tsinghua and Peking University had sent vehicles out to every city to fetch these top scorers.\u201cAfter those good seedlings are chosen and selected by other schools, only the leftovers will come to Central Province Academy. Even if they come, those very experienced teachers will get the first dips on them.\u201dSun Mo hadn\u2019t even mentioned anything about great teachers. Those students who knew that they had the talent would have taken the initiative to meet these great teachers before the recruitment meet, aspiring to be taken under their tutelage.\u201cThat explains!\u201dLu Zhiruo was enlightened.\u201cIs there any other reason?\u201dThe square-faced guy was curious.\u201cThere are bound to be teachers who buy students\u2019 information. The demand is high, but the supply is low. Even if you have set your eyes on a specific student, there will be competition from other teachers. To recruit a student, you must spend a lot of time explaining your teaching rationale or even proving your teaching ability.\u201dSun Mo shrugged. \u201cThe student recruitment meet will only be open for 3 days. Instead of competing, why don\u2019t you pick those unpolished jades (undiscovered talent)?\u201d\u201cNot bad!\u201d The square-faced guy touched his chin and seriously observed Sun Mo. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing capable about depending on information! You will only have the potential to become a great teacher if you pick students through your own judgment!\u201dLu Zhiruo was amazed. She had thought that it was merely them buying some information. However, it turned out to have so many twists and turns. She was totally impressed.(Teacher Sun has formidable analytical capability! If it was me, I would have probably wasted all this money.) Lu Zhiruo thought.Ding.Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +3.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Neutral (8/100)\u201cWhat are you rambling about?\u201dThe square-faced guy roughly flipped through the information and tossed the booklet into the rubbish bin even before he had finished reading it. He had purchased it out of curiosity, not because he wanted to use it as a tool to pick students.\u201cSun Mo!\u201dSun Mo thought to himself. The actual reason why he didn\u2019t buy this information was because he has his Divine Sight. He could see every student\u2019s potential value just by glancing around, and he would never recruit any bad goods (untalented student).\u201cHave you discovered any unpolished jade?\u201dThe square-faced guy had no intention to leave.\u201cWhat is a teacher from Myriad Daos Academy doing at our school? Are you here to poach our students?\u201dSun Mo intentionally ostracized the square-faced guy.\u201cEh?\u201dLu Zhiruo looked at the square-faced guy. Her surprised expression turned into alertness as the guy seemed ready to yell at any moment.\u201cYoung man, don\u2019t try any tricks!\u201dDespite his words, the square-faced guy was not angry.\u201cTell me, which students have you set your eyes on?\u201d Sun Mo teased.\u201cWhat are you guys talking about? Why don\u2019t I seem to understand?\u201d asked Lu Zhiruo.Her head bowed with sorrow. She could neither catch up with their logic, nor could she understand the scheme Sun Mo was plotting.Lu Zhiruo\u2019s silly character was very adorable; hence, the square-faced guy explained to her patiently despite his usually stern personality.\u201cSince we\u2019re all from Jinling City but born to be enemies, the chances of Myriad Daos Academy to spy on you guys were higher than that from any other schools. Sun Mo did not question if I was a teacher from Myriad Daos Academy as he was very certain about it. By using the word \u2018inquire\u2019, he had wanted to make me angry so he could extract information from me through deceit. You must know, when people get angry and impulsive, their inferential ability becomes weaker, and they may let out confidential information through their words.\u201dThe square-faced guy looked at Sun Mo with much admiration this time around. He had wanted to say something but held it back instead.\u201cWe still have to observe for a while.\u201dHence, the square-faced guy quietly followed behind Sun Mo.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHey, are you the kind of pervert who likes to tail behind people?\u201dSun Mo frowned. This man gave him goosebumps. He\u2019d rather be followed by pretty ladies like Jin Mujie.\u201cHehe, what a toxic mouth.\u201dThe square-faced guy wasn\u2019t offended but quietly marked Sun Mo down in his heart. He pointed to the nearest flower bed. \u201cI saw that student on the information booklet before and he\u2019s quite good, why don\u2019t you go and recommend yourself?\u201dAs Sun Mo turned his head, he saw a student who was brandishing a two-feet red spear. A middle-aged man in his forties stood at his side. He was wearing an azure long robe, the uniform of a formally employed teacher in Central Province Academy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Top-notch amongst those from the same age group.Intellect: 5. Average level. Sufficient.Agility: 6. Still could be said to be sufficient, but not very agile.Will: 7. The young man has a strong and outstanding will.\u2026Potential Value: Above Average.Remark, practices spear arts. About to reach the expert-grade.Sun Mo used his thumb to stroke the sandalwood blade. Although Chu Jian\u2019s potential value wasn\u2019t considered high, it was above average. It might be one tier lower, but it wasn\u2019t considered bad. Given his age, he should be a new student who was planning to enroll. Moreover, he must have had an expert giving him guidance in his spear arts before.The system\u2019s grading scale was the elementary-grade, good-grade, expert-grade, grandmaster-grade, and then the ancestor-grade!At the expert-grade, a cultivator was familiar with the technique and was starting to develop their own insight and understanding about it.Sun Mo\u2019s Circulation Technique was at the expert grade, thus he roughly knew what level the spear arts of this young man called Chu Jian had reached.If he hadn\u2019t put in hard work, it\u2019d be impossible for him to have such achievements.Sun Mo threw a glance toward the full-time teacher.Liu Wenyan, 42 years old, at the peak of the blood-ignition realm.Potential Value: Average.Remark, has reached a bottleneck and has been in the blood-ignition realm for three years, unable to advance to the divine force realm.As for the concrete data, Sun Mo couldn\u2019t be bothered to read it. A teacher at his level was considered one who wouldn\u2019t realize his desires. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be landed in a plight where he\u2019d have to come to recruit new students.\u201cGo and take a look!\u201dThe square-faced guy said and walked over first. He couldn\u2019t even bother to glance at Liu Wenyan.A person like this wasn\u2019t within his area of concern.Sun Mo followed after him and looked at the square-faced guy.Yue Rongbo, 45 years old, Longevity Realm.High potential value.Remark, obtained the 4-star great teacher title three months ago.Looking at the words marked in red next to the square-faced guy\u2019s face, Sun Mo didn\u2019t need to look at the other data.In order to become a 4-star great teacher, one would need to gain enlightenment in at least 12 great teacher halos, be at the expert grade in four secondary occupations, and have personal disciples on the Heroes Rankings.There were only a few great teachers of this level in the entire Central Province Academy.This was a big shot! However, Sun Mo\u2019s attitude was as usual, not changing. He merely started to have a new analysis in his heart.\u201cCould he be a new teacher that An Xinhui invited?\u201dIn order for a school to increase its grade, having experienced great teachers was an absolute must. Of course, the salary for recruiting such a person would be unbelievably high.After all, great teachers were very rare existences.Chu Jian saw Yue Rongbo and the other two but didn\u2019t mind it much. It would be weird if someone of his talent didn\u2019t have people surrounding him. Therefore, he asked Liu Wenyan calmly, \u201cWhat do you think of my spear art?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s excellent.\u201dLiu Wenyan\u2019s face turned grim and he lost confidence. From his judgment, a person who could cultivate their spear art to this level at only 12 years old must be a genius. Liu Wenyan was worried that he wouldn\u2019t be able to teach Chu Jian. He felt that Chu Jian\u2019s spear art was perfect.Chu Jian shook his head after seeing Liu Wenyan\u2019s countenance. It was useless to listen to the opinion of a teacher who was lacking in confidence.Lu Zhiruo tugged at Sun Mo\u2019s sleeves and asked softly, \u201cCan you give him any guidance?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSun Mo did have guidance to give him. He could analyze a lot of things by looking at the data he saw with his Divine Sight.Lu Zhiruo immediately became more spirited. She tiptoed and shouted toward Chu Jian, \u201cIf you have any questions, you can ask Teacher Sun, Sun Mo.\u201dChu Jian looked toward Yue Rongbo while Liu Wenyan frowned, assessing Sun Mo. This couldn\u2019t be An Xinhui\u2019s fianc\u00e9, right?\u201cIt\u2019s not him.\u201dLu Zhiruo panicked and tugged at Sun Mo\u2019s hand, wanting him to say something.Chu Jian instantly lost interest. As they said, youngsters were inexperienced and unreliable. Putting aside the fact that Sun Mo was young, he was also wearing a light blue long robe.As Chu Jian was planning to enter Central Province Academy, he knew some information about its system. Sun Mo\u2019s clothes were the representation of an intern teacher.\u201cHe\u2019s looking down on you.\u201dYue Rongbo teased.\u201cYour spear art is good, and you have made a small achievement in it. But you shouldn\u2019t continue with it in the future.\u201dThe moment Sun Mo spoke up, he said something really astonishing.Chu Jian frowned. Before he said anything, Liu Wenyan was already displeased. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know things, then don\u2019t spout rubbish. Do you know that you\u2019re misleading students? Given the talent he showed in spear arts now, he\u2019d definitely become a renowned spear grandmaster in the future!\u201dLiu Wenyan was truly thinking of Chu Jian\u2019s sake. He had heard that Sun Mo wasn\u2019t even a teaching assistant and had gone to the logistics department; thus, it was clear that Sun Mo didn\u2019t have much talent. Moreover, the rumor had it that because he looked handsome, An Xinhui would let him sponge off her.Hearing Sun Mo\u2019s assessment, Yue Rongbo\u2019s eyes lit up. His interest in Sun Mo surpassed his interest in Chu Jian.\u201cYour spear art is very good now, but your progress will be increasingly slower in the future.\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t angry but instead looked at Chu Jian. Over 100 lines of detailed data appeared next to Chu Jian. \u201cIt\u2019s because you made the wrong choice right from the beginning.\u201d\u201cWhat rubbish!\u201dLiu Wenyan reprimanded.\u201cGo on.\u201dYue Rongbo wanted to listen on.\u201cYour stature is too short and your arms aren\u2019t long enough. You\u2019ll be at a disadvantage if you were to practice the spear. You won\u2019t be able to release the greatest advantage spear arts have.\u201dSun Mo sighed.One inch longer, one inch stronger. Chu Jian\u2019s disadvantage was that his arms were too short. If he were to encounter another spear expert who was of a similar level as him, but taller, he would be at a disadvantage.\u201cHuh?\u201dLiu Wenyan was flabbergasted.Chu Jian was also stunned. He suddenly recalled what his father had told him back in the past.\u201cJian`er, it\u2019s too disadvantageous for you to walk on the path of the spear with your short body and short limbs. Even if you go to the very end, you won\u2019t be able to reach my level.\u201dAs Chu Jian admired his father, liking the way his father was domineering and challenged the world head-on with his spear, Chu Jian ended up being infatuated with the spear. He thus put in hard work at it over the years.After achieving a small success in his spear arts, everyone would praise him when they saw him. There were even quite a number of people who wanted him for their disciple.Chu Jian started to feel proud of this, thinking that what his father said was wrong. However, in the last half a year, he had made no progress in his spear art. This was why he came to the Central Province Academy, wanting to find a way to attain a breakthrough.He hadn\u2019t expected to hear the same rating his father had given. For that instant, he was very angry. However, he immediately suppressed his anger and the contempt on his face disappeared. Instead, he bowed solemnly.\u201cThank you for your guidance, Teacher Sun.\u201dIt was the tradition in the nine provinces to respect teachers and honored their teachings. Regardless of his age, a teacher who could say the same thing his father, whom he held great admiration for, deserved some respect.Ding!+20 favorable impression points from Chu Jian.Prestige connection with Chu Jian initiated: Neutral (20/100)Sun Mo let out a soft laugh after hearing the system\u2019s notification.\u201cTeacher Sun is so amazing!\u201dSeeing Chu Jian bowing, Lu Zhiruo immediately felt as if she shared the honor.Ding!+10 favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Neutral (18/100)\u201cHuh?\u201dLiu Wenyan let out a surprised cry, and his countenance turned increasingly grim. He was trying to help this young man out, but he turned to bow to Sun Mo.\u201cCould it be that what he said is right?\u201dLiu Wenyan looked toward Sun Mo. The light blue long robe that Sun Mo wore pierced his eyes strongly.He wasn\u2019t even comparable to an intern teacher!\u201cI really don\u2019t have the talent to be a teacher!\u201dLiu Wenyan sighed and turned to leave.\u201cSince Teacher Sun\u2019s guidance is accurate, then do you want him as your teacher?\u201dLu Zhiruo opened her eyes wide, looking at Chu Jian, hoping that he\u2019d agree immediately.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I need to give it some thought.\u201dChu Jian drew his spear back and left. The reason he came to this school was to find a way to attain a breakthrough. He didn\u2019t give up on the spear in the past, and he wouldn\u2019t give it up in the future.\u201cOh, then how long are you going to consider?\u201dLu Zhiruo asked.Sun Mo raised his hand and knocked on Lu Zhiruo\u2019s head. \u201cStupid. He\u2019s rejecting discreetly.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dLu Zhiruo was too innocent and couldn\u2019t read between the lines.\u201cHis aptitude isn\u2019t bad. Are you not going to consider him?\u201dSun Mo tried asking Yue Rongbo.\u201cCompared to him, I admire you more.\u201d Yue Rongbo chuckled. \u201cDo you have a way to take him as your disciple?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dSun Mo replied honestly. A young man who could train his spear to this level was someone who wouldn\u2019t change his mind easily. Moreover, his will was at 7, showing that he was clearly very stubborn. If there weren\u2019t any accidents, he\u2019d probably study under a spear art master. Sun Mo knew that he didn\u2019t have a chance and thus didn\u2019t want to waste the effort to try.\u201cYoung man, you must learn to take on challenges head-on.\u201dYue Rongbo was a little displeased that Sun Mo was giving up. He was hoping to see Sun Mo showing a better performance.\u201cI\u2019m off. I\u2019ll go take a look at the Martial Arts Platform. There might be students with good potential there.\u201dSun Mo had no intention of running into a brick wall.In order to let students better display their talents, the school set up a wooden platform on the field that was the size of a basketball court. Right now, only three to four students were displaying their martial arts there.The Martial Arts Platform was surrounded mostly by students, with only a few teachers. Therefore, everyone didn\u2019t have a strong desire to perform.Sun Mo looked over and saw a lot of data popping up, almost blurring his vision. Therefore, he only focused his attention on the students whose potential values were at least above average or higher.It was a pity that there were very few of them.\u201cAs expected, these are the students leftover after people have made their selection.\u201dSun Mo tsked. Suddenly, an \u2018extremely high potential value\u2019 appeared in his sight. He was about to take a careful look when a commotion broke out in the crowd. There were even some girls screaming.\u201cTeacher Liu Mubai is here!\u201dWith the chaos, he lost sight of the \u2018extremely high\u2019.\u201cWho is Liu Mubai? He\u2019s so popular?\u201d Lu Zhiruo tiptoed and looked around. \u201cIs he a great teacher?\u201dSun Mo noticed that Yue Rongbo, who was next to him, also wore an interested expression.\u2026Liu Wenyan stood next to the Sorrowless Lake, looking at the calm lake while wearing an aggrieved expression. He kept on recalling the scene in which Sun Mo had given Chu Jian pointers when he was unable to. After hesitating for very long, he eventually let out a long sigh and returned to the dorm.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen he came out again, he was holding onto a letter. After a short moment of hesitation, he walked toward the administrative building. He couldn\u2019t get himself to face An Xinhui and thus handed the letter to Zhou Lin.\u201cTeacher Liu, this is\u2026\u201dZhou Lin was surprised. It was because the words \u2018resignation letter\u2019 was written on the envelope.\u201cPlease help me to pass this letter to Headmaster An.\u201dAfter saying this, Liu Wenyan\u2019s expression became a lot more relaxed. He swung his sleeve and turned to leave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A teacher had tendered his resignation for no reason, so Zhou Lin didn\u2019t dare to delay the matter and immediately passed the resignation letter to An Xinhui.\u201cWhat else did he say?\u201dAn Xinhui put down her brush and opened up the letter.The content wasn\u2019t long. He had first said that he had a good time in the school for the past ten or more years and had developed strong feelings for it. Thereafter, the topic changed to him being ashamed of having failed the previous headmaster. Not capable of advancing to become a great teacher all this while, he no longer had the face to stay in the school.\u201cNo, but by the looks of it, he seemed to have been dealt a great blow.\u201dZhou Lin felt that it was good for Liu Wenyan to resign as well. It\u2019d save some money for the school.\u201cGo and prepare 1,000 silver taels.\u201dAn Xinhui instructed.\u201cHeadmaster.\u201dZhou Lin wasn\u2019t pleased. She must be planning to give this to Liu Wenyan. Was there a need for that?\u201cGo and prepare it.\u201dAn Xinhui put down the documents she was going through and headed out.\u201cHeadmaster, that Liu Wenyan is too mediocre. He\u2019s not worth you showing kindness to.\u201dZhou Lin didn\u2019t wish to move. The school\u2019s financial situation was in red. If they were to give out these 1,000 silver taels, An Xinhui would definitely have to scrimp and save for a very long time.\u201cAlthough he is mediocre and hasn\u2019t produced any results, he has worked for the school for over ten years. Moreover, he has a family to take care of. I only hope that he won\u2019t be troubled too much financially before he finds his next job.\u201dAn Xinhui said in a very calm tone.\u201cBut isn\u2019t that too much?\u201dZhou Lin pouted. An Xinhui was really kind, but she knew what Eldest Miss\u2019s character was like. Once she had made up her mind, it\u2019d be impossible to persuade her otherwise. Therefore, Zhou Lin went to prepare the money.Liu Wenyan stood by the roadside not far away from the school\u2019s entrance. He had luggage with him and was waiting for a horse carriage.\u201cTeacher Liu!\u201dHearing the graceful voice, Liu Wenyan, who was lost in his thoughts, got back to his senses. Seeing that An Xinhui was standing right next to him, he quickly greeted her.\u201cHeadmaster An.\u201d\u201cWhy does Teacher Liu wish to resign? Is it because I haven\u2019t done a good job? Did I disappoint you?\u201dAn Xinhui asked.\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m too useless.\u201dLiu Wenyan lowered his head, looking ashamed.\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I wish Teacher Liu well on your journey.\u201d An Xinhui took the wooden chest from Zhou Lin and handed it to Liu Wenyan. \u201cThis is a token of our appreciation. Please accept it.\u201d\u201cNo, no, I mustn\u2019t take it.\u201dLiu Wenyan refused to take it. He felt both touched and ashamed. Who was he to be personally sent off by Headmaster An Xinhui?\u201cTake it. Give my greetings to aunt.\u201dAfter saying that, An Xinhui turned to leave. She was very graceful and dignified during the entire process, giving off a great impression.Liu Wenyan held onto the chest as he looked at An Xinhui\u2019s back view. He couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. She was a talented and good lady, but it was really an extremely difficult task to bring the Central Province Academy back up.Right now, the school had too many malpractices, and it had accumulated to the point of no return. At the thought of this, Liu Wenyan couldn\u2019t help but call out.\u201cHeadmaster An, please be careful of Zhang Hanfu.\u201dAn Xinhui didn\u2019t turn back.\u201cIt is only after he has resigned and taken the 1,000 silver taels that he dared to say \u2018be careful of Zhang Hanfu\u2019. What a coward.\u201dZhou Lin was still feeling upset.Recalling the scene from earlier in which Sun Mo had guided Chu Jian, he called out again, \u201cAnd that Sun Mo, he does have some capability!\u201d (I really hope that you\u2019re not just someone who sponges off a woman and that you\u2019ll be able to help Headmaster An.)Hearing Sun Mo\u2019s name being mentioned, Zhou Lin\u2019s expression immediately turned dark, and she couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cSomeone like Liu Wenyan should have resigned long ago. What capability can that Sun Mo have when he can\u2019t even work as a logistics worker? He must really be blind!\u201dAn Xinhui frowned slightly. Could it be that Sun Mo was related to Liu Wenyan\u2019s resignation? She immediately shook her head. She must have over-thought things. But she should go and see him after the student recruitment meet had ended.\u2026Liu Mubai\u2019s arrival caused the atmosphere around the Martial Arts Platform to liven up.\u201cRanked 18th on the Greencloud Rankings, a definite candidate to becoming a great teacher. He came from the Black-White Academy, which is one of the top nine famous schools. He graduated with outstanding results, being third in the cohort and having a high level of mastery in sword arts. He is a new teacher whom An Xinhui places great hopes in\u2026\u201dYue Rongbo brought out amazing praises one after another, all of which belonged to Liu Mubai.The Greencloud Rankings was a ranking that the Saint Gate had come up with. Youngsters and students below the age of 25 who were outstanding enough would be able to get listed on this ranking.As its name suggested, the Greencloud Rankings was established with the hope that youngsters could get their names on it and rise to the clouds.This ranking covered all youngsters in Middle-Earth\u2019s nine provinces who were 25 years old or below. Therefore, everyone knew that it was a representation of great quality.The 18th position that Liu Mubai was ranked at was already an existence that other people held admiration for.\u201cLiu Mubai is 24 years old this year. It\u2019s said that he has long reached the standard of a 1-star great teacher, and that if he were to take the Occupation Examination, he\u2019d have a high chance of passing it. The reason he didn\u2019t go for it is because he planned to make history, aiming to become a 3-star great teacher directly.\u201dYue Rongbo shared a small secret.\u201cThat\u2019s so amazing!\u201dLu Zhiruo exclaimed.Sun Mo tsked. If Liu Mubai also had the Absolute Great Teacher System, the amount of favorable impression points he received would probably be over 1,000 points.\u201cWhy did such an amazing teacher come to the Central Province Academy?\u201dWhen someone next to them heard this, they asked, feeling perplexed, \u201cGiven his results, Liu Mubai shouldn\u2019t have any problem staying in the Black-White Academy, right?\u201d\u201cOutstanding people like to take on challenges. If Liu Mubai were to stay in the Black-White Academy, his life would just continue as it had been. However, if he were to come to the Central Province Academy, helping this famous school with a great historical background to return to the top nine rankings, then his name would become monumental for this school. He\u2019d get a statue made after him, his name passing down in history. If it was you, what would you choose?\u201dYue Rongbo could relate to what Liu Mubai was thinking. Which great teacher wouldn\u2019t want their name to be passed down in history?\u201cHe has such great ambitions!\u201dLu Zhiruo exclaimed.\u201cOf course. That\u2019s probably one of the reasons why An Xinhui kept Liu Mubai here.\u201dYue Rongbo kept his gaze on Liu Mubai, who was amongst the crowd. He didn\u2019t blink at all.There had only been three to four people on the Martial Arts Platform earlier on, but after Liu Mubai\u2019s arrival, over 100 students jumped onto it. They couldn\u2019t wait to perform the martial arts that they were proud of, wanting to show off their moves and be selected by Liu Mubai.Suddenly, the Martial Arts Platform was packed with people.At a time like this, giving way to others wasn\u2019t something that people would consider. There were usually too few chances to come into contact with Liu Mubai, so they must grab hold of this chance.A few teachers immediately went up in a bid to uphold the order, but it was too late. With a loud boom, over ten students let out agonizing cries as they were sent flying and fell off from the Martial Arts Platform.The commotion ceased instantly. Even the surrounding students looked over.A young man, who was over 1.8 meters tall, stood on a vacant area on the Martial Arts Platform, holding onto a silver spear, sweeping his cold gaze out.The summer wind blew, causing his white clothes to flutter.\u201cOh, not bad!\u201dYue Rongbo praised as his gaze landed on the young man\u2019s white clothes. There were some traces of dark red on it. From his experience, those were likely left behind from washing out blood traces.\u201cXuanyuan Po is here to accept challenges!\u201dThe young man called out loudly and proudly.The students on the Martial Arts Platform were stunned for a moment before they charged out toward him angrily. This young man holding a silver spear was too arrogant and deserved to be given a beating.\u201cTake this!\u201d A muscular young man immediately pounced out. \u201cThinking of using me as a stepping stone? Dream on!\u201dHowever, he had just finished his words when he was struck in the chest by Xuanyuan Po\u2019s spear, and he fell backward like a broken sandbag.Bang!The muscular young man landed on the ground. He was in so much pain that he had curled up into a ball.This attack hadn\u2019t scared off the rest but agitated their competitiveness instead. Therefore, another young man charged out.Bang!The young man was struck by the spear and sent flying.\u201cI\u2019ll have a go!\u201dA soft bellow rang out as a budding young girl charged out. However, it took only an instant before she was knocked off the Martial Arts Platform.Sssss!Everyone couldn\u2019t help but draw in a cold gasp. This Xuanyuan Po was arrogant and amazing, but at the same time, very vicious as well. He didn\u2019t even hold back against a girl.The girl let out an agonizing cry, but Xuanyuan Po was unmoved. He swung his silver spear around. \u201cYou guys are too weak. Come at me together!\u201dSuch an arrogant callout infuriated the crowd.\u201cLet\u2019s attack together and kill him!\u201d\u201cThis guy is really brutal. He even beat up girls!\u201d\u201cTrash him.\u201dThe young men were all infuriated, but just as they were all planning to jointly attack Xuanyuan Po, they were stopped by a teacher who had jumped up the Martial Arts Platform.\u201cWhat are you guys doing? This place is for you guys to demonstrate your martial arts and spar. It\u2019s not for mass-fighting and creating trouble. All of you get off now!\u201dLian Zheng was infuriated. The youngsters didn\u2019t know how to hold back. What if they were to cripple someone?The students were hesitant and unwilling.\u201cGet off!\u201dLian Zheng bellowed, and golden light lit up on his body as \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 was activated. Influenced by the great teacher halo, all of the students got off the Martial Arts Platform docilely.Xuanyuan Po tsked, rested his spear on his shoulder, and then jumped off the Martial Arts Platform.\u201cHold on!\u201dLiu Mubai spoke up.Hua!A commotion broke out, and some people wore envious gazes. It was clear that Liu Mubai wanted to recruit Xuanyuan Po.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dXuanyuan Po turned back and sniffed.Many people had the urge to beat him up after seeing his attitude. (Do you know what it means to respect teachers and honor their teachings? Who speaks to a person who was a sure candidate to become a great teacher like this?)Some of them wanted Xuanyuan Po to quickly offend Liu Mubai and be detested by him.\u201cI\u2019m Liu Mubai. I\u2019m very interested in you.\u201dLiu Mubai smiled as he assessed Xuanyuan Po. He looked at Xuanyuan Po\u2019s physique and felt that he was someone with great potential.\u201cThere are many people interested in me!\u201dXuanyuan Po smiled proudly.Many teachers shook their heads when they heard this reply. This Xuanyuan Po\u2019s head couldn\u2019t be filled with muscles, could it? Usually, when a teacher said this, smarter students would know that the teacher wanted to take them in as their disciple. If the student was interested, they would quickly drop to their knees and pay respect to the teacher.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll say this again. I\u2019m Liu Mubai, ranked 18th on the Greencloud Rankings. I graduated from the Black-White Academy and am a teacher from the Central Province Academy. I admire your physique and character, and plan on taking you in as my disciple.\u201dProud as he was, Liu Mubai wouldn\u2019t dare to call himself a strong candidate for becoming a great teacher.In fact, just the fact that he was ranked 18th on the Greencloud Rankings was enough to explain a lot of things. However, Xuanyuan Po was clearly a hotheaded person and there wasn\u2019t any hint of respect in his tone.\u201cDo you excel in spear arts?\u201dSuch a straightforward question was considered to be quite offensive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Teachers tended to have more patience and be more tolerant toward geniuses. If an ordinary student were to ask the same question, Liu Mubai would have swung his sleeves back and left.Zhang Sheng didn\u2019t say anything but stared at Xuanyuan Po, wanting to see how he was different from other people. This guy should be a genius considering that Liu Mubai had taken the initiative to speak up to him.\u201cIf only I could learn the way Liu Mubai discerns students!\u201dZhang Sheng felt envious.\u201cI excel in eight types of weapons, especially in the sword. I have plenty of insights.\u201dLiu Mubai\u2019s tone remained calm, but the people around him started to gasp. It required great capabilities for one to be able to master so many weapons.When a teacher implied that they excelled in something, it meant that they were at a level in which they could teach students.Xuanyuan Po clearly knew this as well, so his expression became a lot more solemn. He stared at Liu Mubai seriously. \u201cCan you make me the best spear-wielder in the world?\u201dHua!The moment he said this, a commotion broke out. All the students looked at Xuanyuan Po with wide-open eyes and mouth, wanting to ask him, (Are you a fool? Young man, everyone has the dream of becoming a sword saint or spear saint!)However, no one would voice it out because the possibility of achieving it was close to zero. Everyone could only think about it.To think that this Xuanyuan Po had asked this question so solemnly, they felt so ashamed about this. Of course, all of them thought that he was being too full of himself.Liu Mubai fell silent.\u201cI understand!\u201dXuanyuan Po turned and left.People started talking amongst themselves, and some teachers who had initially thought well of Xuanyuan Po couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads as well. This kid was talented, but his emotional intelligence was too low.Questions like this were quite difficult to answer. Even secondary saints wouldn\u2019t dare to assure that their disciples would become the best in one aspect, let alone great teachers.\u201cTeacher Liu, there\u2019s no need to take this to heart. Once a student like him suffers a few times and grows up, he\u2019ll know how foolish his question was.\u201dLian Zheng was afraid that this matter might affect Liu Mubai\u2019s mood.\u201cTeacher Lian, you\u2019re overthinking things. We should be happy if the youngsters have great ambitions.\u201dLiu Mubai smiled, giving off a sunshine vibe and dazzling all of the girls present until they felt like screaming.\u201cHehe!\u201dZhang Sheng felt happy inside. It felt very exhilarating that someone else couldn\u2019t get what he wanted to get!\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to give it a try?\u201dYue Rongbo teased.\u201cWe\u2019ll see if we have an affinity later.\u201dSun Mo scanned through the place, wanting to find the student with \u2018extremely high potential value\u2019, which he had seen earlier. However, that student was nowhere to be found.Many teachers had their eyes on Xuanyuan Po since Liu Mubai viewed him in high regard. However, Sun Mo wasn\u2019t going to go in the scramble as it would make him appear more inferior.\u201cThe way you\u2019re composing yourself has the demeanor of a great teacher.\u201dYue Rongbo gave Sun Mo a thumbs up.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to treat me to a meal?\u201dSun Mo felt curious. Given Yue Rongbo\u2019s status as a 4-star great teacher, the chances of him successfully recruiting Xuanyuan Po would be very high. However, Yue Rongbo clearly wasn\u2019t intending on doing so.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be the one to play host?\u201d Yue Rongbo countered. However, he still treated Sun Mo to a meal.Seeing Yue Rongbo\u2019s departing view after they bade goodbye, Sun Mo reminded Lu Zhiruo, \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to be the student of a great teacher? He is a 4-star great teacher.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dLu Zhiruo gasped.\u201cGo on, it\u2019s a rare opportunity.\u201dAfter saying that, Sun Mo planned to head to the library to take a look. All of the school\u2019s facilities were opened today, and he felt that students who would go to the library should be those who loved to study.Sun Mo walked for about ten or so meters when Lu Zhiruo came running after him and then continued to stay by his side.\u201cHmm?\u201dSun Mo was perplexed.\u201cI\u2019m so stupid, he\u2019d definitely not want me.\u201dLu Zhiruo wore a self-ridiculing smile. If she had an outstanding aptitude, then he\u2019d have asked her some questions long ago. Since they hadn\u2019t spoken for the entire morning, it was clear that he didn\u2019t care for her.\u201cDon\u2019t think too much about it.\u201dSun Mo rubbed Lu Zhiruo\u2019s hair.\u201cEn!\u201dSensing Sun Mo\u2019s concern, Lu Zhiruo felt a lot better.\u2026Evening came, but Sun Mo still didn\u2019t manage to get any student. Instead, Lu Zhiruo was the one who was feeling very anxious.\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes tomorrow.\u201dSun Mo sent Lu Zhiruo back to the warehouse where she was temporarily residing. After walking over, he saw a group of students having a private fight here.Bang!A student was sent flying by a silver spear, smashing against the wall and bringing up a lot of dust.\u201cNext!\u201dXuanyuan Po\u2019s gaze was that of despise.\u201cI\u2019ll have a go!\u201dA muscular-looking student who was wielding a saber jumped in. As he didn\u2019t want to let Xuanyuan Po recover his stamina, he immediately launched his attack.After Liu Mubai\u2019s attempt to recruit him, Xuanyuan Po\u2019s reputation rose rapidly. Some students couldn\u2019t accept this, and some of them wanted to prove that they were better than him by defeating him. They felt that they\u2019d then be able to be viewed by the great teachers in high regard. Therefore, there had been a ceaseless line of people challenging Xuanyuan Po to a private battle.In order not to be discovered, everyone hid in a secluded warehouse area.Xuanyuan Po didn\u2019t care. He felt happy as long as he could battle.After 36 moves, Xuanyuan Po swept out his silver spear, pushing back the muscular student\u2019s saber and then lashing the back of his spear on his lower leg.Pa!The muscular student immediately dropped to his knees. When he saw the silver spear rapidly sweeping toward him, he cried out for mercy, \u201cI\u2019ve lost!\u201dSwoosh!The silver spear stopped right in front of the muscular student\u2019s face, and Xuanyuan Po broke into a smile. \u201cLet me tell you, even if I don\u2019t have any stamina, it won\u2019t be an issue to take care of you. Alright, next.\u201dThe muscular student\u2019s countenance turned a little grim when his scheme was noticed. When the other students saw Xuanyuan Po, they started to fear him and didn\u2019t dare to challenge him anymore.\u201cNext!\u201dXuanyuan Po shouted out again, but no one answered him. Looking at the sky and seeing that it was a little late, he took out a piece of cotton cloth and wiped his silver spear carefully.\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d Sun Mo frowned. \u201cWho allowed you to have private battles here?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a teacher!\u201dSomeone shouted out, and all the students scattered off. The only ones left behind were three young intern teachers. Qin Fen was one of them.Everyone\u2019s gazes met for a moment then turned away.After carefully wiping his beloved silver spear and putting the cover back on it, Xuanyuan Po sat under the roof, took out a plain bun from his bag, and started eating.Two of the intern teachers wanted to approach him but were hesitant and lacked confidence. Qin Fen, on the other hand, walked over after tidying out his clothes. He sat down next to Xuanyuan Po.\u201cCan you make me the best spear master in the world?\u201dXuanyuan Po went straight to the point with the same question.\u201cHehe, even if a secondary saint was here, they won\u2019t be able to answer this question. There are too many factors to consider in order for one to become a spear saint.\u201dQin Fen didn\u2019t falter but started chatting with Xuanyuan Po like a like-minded elder brother.The atmosphere was very amicable.The other two intern teachers instantly felt nervous. It couldn\u2019t be that Qin Fen was going to succeed, right? They wanted to go up and interrupt their talk, but Qin Fen immediately glared at them. His vicious gaze caused them to stop in their footsteps.\u201cTeacher!\u201dLu Zhiruo tugged at Sun Mo\u2019s sleeve, also feeling worried.Sun Mo didn\u2019t disturb them. He stood there and looked at Xuanyuan Po.\u202614 years old, 5th-level of the body-refinement realm.Strength: 8. Valiant.Intellect: 5. It\u2019s a little low.Agility: 8. If the opponent thinks that you\u2019re a strength-type fighter, they\u2019d definitely suffer big time.Endurance: 9. A steel person who won\u2019t die from running.Will: 5. This is your shortcoming.\u2026Potential Value: Extremely High!Remark: He only thinks about martial arts and battles, so he has lower emotional intelligence. He is a little one-track minded and doesn\u2019t know how to be flexible!What terrifying statistics and potential! This was what a real genius was like, being a rare find even amongst 10,000! He was unlike Qi Shengjia, someone who could be found everywhere on the streets.In this world where martial prowess was revered, a seed like Xuanyuan Po was someone that any great teacher would crave to have as their disciple. As long as given proper guidance, he\u2019d definitely be able to shine.Qin Fen graduated from Jixia Learning Palace and had both high intelligence and emotional quotients. It only took him a few words to draw his relationship closer to Xuanyuan Po.(It\u2019s too easy to deal with a hotheaded person like this.)Qin Fen felt proud to see Xuanyuan Po smiling.\u201cThen how do you think I\u2019m lacking in my spear art?\u201dXuanyuan Po asked.\u201cThis is bad!\u201dThe two intern teachers felt very anxious, but there was nothing they could do. The feeling was as if they were watching a peach of immortality that they had been keeping their eyes on being plucked by someone else.If they didn\u2019t need to take any responsibility for killing Qin Fen, they would have done that long ago.\u201cYour spear arts are excellent. You should continue training in the same manner and gain more battle experience.\u201dQin Fen smiled. In his eyes, the other intern teachers weren\u2019t even worthy of being his opponent.Xuanyuan Po fell silent. This wasn\u2019t the answer he was looking for.\u201cI\u2019m a student of the Jixia Learning Palace. I\u2019ll return to my alma mater and search for spear arts manuals, then I\u2019ll study them carefully and seek help from my teacher. I\u2019ll definitely not waste your talent!\u201dQin Fen looked straight at Xuanyuan Po, sounding very sincere.\u201cHow shameless!\u201dThe two intern teachers felt a strong sense of defeat. People who graduated from famous schools had great connections.Xuanyuan Po hesitated. No matter how low his emotional intelligence was, he knew the benefits of following a teacher who had graduated from a famous school.\u201cLiu Mubai is very strong, but because of this, he will definitely have a lot of personal disciples in the future, and the amount of effort and resources he\u2019ll give you wouldn\u2019t be much then. As for me, I can guarantee that you\u2019ll be my first personal disciple and I\u2019ll place greater emphasis on nurturing you.\u201dThis was his assurance.Seeing that Xuanyuan Po seemed to be wavering, the corners of Qin Fen\u2019s lips curled up uncontrollably. (Who said that intern teachers wouldn\u2019t be able to recruit geniuses? I\u2019ll show you guys!)(Liu Mubai, I\u2019ll prove that I\u2019m no weaker than you!)Just as Qin Fen was about to elaborate on the benefits he could offer, Sun Mo spoke up, \u201cThere\u2019s a problem with your spear art!\u201dSwoosh!Xuanyuan Po immediately looked over as he was greatly infatuated in spear arts. \u201cWhat problem do I have?\u201d\u201cHa, you want to join in the competition?\u201dAlthough Qin Fen continued to maintain a humble appearance, he clearly looked down on this intern teacher. His name seemed to be Sun Mo? If it wasn\u2019t because this guy was An Xinhui\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Qin Fen wouldn\u2019t have remembered his name amongst over 210 intern teachers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe two intern teachers were also extremely surprised.\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201dSun Mo asked.\u201cNo, please start your performance!\u201dQin Fen appeared very magnanimous.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

On the side, Lu Zhiruo was biting her lips, praying for him in her heart.\u201cThere\u2019s a flaw in your character.\u201dAll sorts of data on Xuanyuan Po appeared right before Sun Mo.\u201cHah, what are you talking about?\u201dQin Fen let out a stifled laugh, thinking that Sun Mo was trying to fool others.\u201cYou cultivate the Prairie Blazing Fire Spear Technique which pursues pressing forward courageously, fighting to one\u2019s last breath!\u201dSun Mo ignored Qin Fen.Xuanyuan Po\u2019s eyes lit up, and he started to pay attention. \u201cPlease go on!\u201d\u201cHe knows about Xuanyuan Po\u2019s spear technique?\u201dQin Fen was astonished and his heart beat fiercely, almost jumping out from his throat.To be honest, Qin Fen didn\u2019t recognize the technique.(No, Sun Mo must have seen it by chance before. It must be a coincidence! There\u2019s no way that he has more experience than me, a graduate from Jixia Learning Palace!)\u201cTo reach the apex in spear art, one must comprehend the state of \u2018one with the spear\u2019, but your character is too indecisive for it.\u201dGrandmaster-grade Divine Sight could list out the target\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. After Sun Mo sorted through the data, he came up with this conclusion.Xuanyuan Po sank into deep thought.At the sight of this, Qin Fen felt anxious. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to his gibberish. Youngsters like you tend to have an unstable temperament. You\u2019ll naturally become firm and decisive after you gain more experiences in life.\u201d\u201cLook, you\u2019re hesitating right now!\u201d Sun Mo pointed out.Before Sun Mo finished his words, Qin Fen bellowed furiously, \u201cShut up. You call this guidance? This is a hoax.\u201dThe two intern teachers were shocked. Qin Fen had always appeared refined and calm in front of others. They hadn\u2019t expected that he would have such a crazy side to him as well.It did make sense. If they were in his shoes, watching as the prey that had gotten into their hands being snatched away, they wouldn\u2019t be in a good temper either.\u201cWhat you said isn\u2019t right. I\u2019m unafraid of death. My spear technique is very forceful, not giving up until my last breath.\u201dXuanyuan Po shook his head.\u201cWhat does \u2018unafraid of death\u2019 have to do with your indecisiveness? I\u2019m saying that you shouldn\u2019t be indecisive in your daily life or when you come in contact with others.\u201dSun Mo explained. \u201cHave you heard of a saying before?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dXuanyuan Po was curious.\u201cSometimes, living on requires greater courage than committing suicide does!\u201dSun Mo recalled his classmate from university who hadn\u2019t been able to withstand the pressure from life. He had committed suicide in a bid to escape from reality.Xuanyuan Po was stunned. Memories from his past surged out from the depths of his mind, and his expression turned extremely solemn.\u201cXuanyuan Po, he\u2019s just trying to dupe you. What that can help you grow is still one\u2019s teaching capabilities. You can ask him if he has the confidence to beat me in this aspect.\u201dQin Fen felt unsettled.On the other hand, Lu Zhiruo clenched her small fists and shuddered nervously.Sun Mo stopped talking. He kept his right hand behind his back and his left on the wooden blade, his eyes looking at Xuanyuan Po calmly. No matter how much he wanted a genius disciple, he mustn\u2019t lose his front as a teacher.Sun Mo didn\u2019t want to howl out in exasperation like Qin Fen.Xuanyuan Po looked at Sun Mo and then at Qin Fen. Smiling, he lowered his head and stroked the marks on his spear. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I indeed have an indecisive character.\u201d\u201cXuanyuan Po, don\u2019t listen to his gibberish.\u201d Seeing him like this, Qin Fen became anxious. \u201cIf you want to become a spear saint, other than talent, you\u2019ll also need to rely on a tremendous amount of resources. I can provide you with these.\u201dQin Fen made his offer, trying to tempt him.\u201cTeacher, he\u2019s tempted. Quickly say something!\u201dLu Zhiruo mumbled softly.However, Sun Mo didn\u2019t say anything, knowing that silence had a greater prowess in this situation. Moreover, he hadn\u2019t stopped with his psychological battle. He had calculated the place at which he was standing right now, and he happened to have his back against the setting sun.From Xuanyuan Po\u2019s angle, the orange-red evening glow was casting down on Sun Mo, making his disposition stand out even more.The old principal from No.2 High School had once said that as a teacher, one\u2019s disposition was very important. One must learn to make use of the environment to build up the atmosphere and influence the students.\u201cThat can\u2019t be. This kid is going to choose Sun Mo?\u201dThe two intern teachers didn\u2019t even dare to breathe too heavily as they watched this. However, they also admitted that Sun Mo\u2019s words were very provocative.Qin Fen was anxious and his eyes turned red, but he still could think rationally. He wanted to let Xuanyuan Po understand that Sun Mo\u2019s teaching capabilities were lacking. Therefore, his gaze landed on Lu Zhiruo.\u201cAre you his personal disciple?\u201dQin Fen questioned.Lu Zhiruo backed off in surprise, shrinking her neck back. Her gaze started to dart around as she had the urge to find somewhere to hide.(Haha, my gamble\u2019s right. I knew it!)Qin Fen was laughing hard in his heart. Working with the principle of \u2018taking someone\u2019s life while he was sick\u2019, he continued with his questioning.\u201cSun Mo, it seems like you treat her very well. Are you not taking her as your disciple because you feel that you\u2019re incapable and don\u2019t want to hinder her, or does she not care for you?\u201dThis question was very cutting.Xuanyuan Po looked toward Lu Zhiruo, and she panicked even more. Feeling nervous and afraid that she\u2019d hold up Sun Mo\u2019s affair, tears started trickling down her face.\u201cDon\u2019t be scared!\u201d Sun Mo turned and walked up to Lu Zhiruo, rubbing her head. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t manage to recruit Xuanyuan Po, I won\u2019t blame you. You don\u2019t have to blame yourself!\u201d\u201cTeacher Sun!\u201dLu Zhiruo felt like she was lying on bedsheets that had been sunned after hearing Sun Mo\u2019s gentle voice. Her entire body relaxed and then she bit her lips, dropping to her knees.\u201cTeacher Sun Mo, student Lu Zhiruo makes a bold request for you to take me as your disciple!\u201dLu Zhiruo kowtowed.\u201cWhat?\u201dQin Fen and the two intern teachers were greatly astonished. They had thought that Qin Fen had managed to turn the tables around, but hadn\u2019t expected that his trump card turned out to be one that killed himself.\u201cZhiruo, you don\u2019t have to do this for my sake.\u201d Sun Mo bent over and took Lu Zhiruo\u2019s arm. \u201cGet up!\u201d\u201cNo, this is out of my own accord!\u201dLu Zhiruo continued to stay down. Her forehead pressed down on the grass, and she could smell the dust. That was right. She had come out to learn, so why didn\u2019t she understand things?Her father said that she was trash. She had traveled long distances but wasn\u2019t able to meet the great teachers she had visited. She had taken many tests and also asked some seniors, all of which proved that she had an extremely bad aptitude. However, she still had the wishful thought of learning under a great teacher\u2026During the journey, Sun Mo was the one who had treated her the best. He had given her osmanthus cake, pear blossom candy, hot buns, and a place to stay\u2026The teachers she had visited in the past all despised her aptitude, but what Sun Mo was first worried about was her feelings.The funny thing was that she had waited for so long. She should have asked to become his disciple a long time ago.At the thought of this, Lu Zhiruo straightened her back and then gave another hard kowtow.Bang!\u201cTeacher Sun, please take me in as your student!\u201dLu Zhiruo was very sincere.\u201cAre you crazy? You aren\u2019t going to consider your future?\u201dQin Fen cried out. What was this?\u201cHave you really considered things thoroughly?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s tone was solemn.\u201cYes!\u201dAlthough it was a simple reply, it was the most serious one that Lu Zhiruo had ever given in her life.\u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll take you in as my disciple!\u201dSun Mo smiled. He still remembered the horrible data belonging to Lu Zhiruo, but why did that matter? Since she couldn\u2019t become a great master in martial arts, then she could just aim to develop in other directions. He had always believed that as long as a person put their heart into things, any student would be able to shine.Bang! Bang! Bang!Lu Zhiruo gave three hard kowtows and then stood up. A smile broke out on her tear-stricken innocent face.\u201cHaha!\u201dSun Mo lifted his hand and wiped off the dust on Lu Zhiruo\u2019s forehead.\u201cTeacher!\u201dThis \u2018teacher\u2019 sounded very sweet, and the meaning it represented was also different from before.\u201cEn!\u201dSun Mo answered, feeling that there was suddenly an additional responsibility on his shoulder now.\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201dQin Fen wanted to say that this was an act meant to dupe Xuanyuan Po, but he didn\u2019t dare to do so. It was because in Middle-Earth\u2019s nine provinces, \u2018formal acknowledgment of one as their teacher\u2019 was something that mustn\u2019t be faked. Once discovered, the people involved would be banished to the Darkness Continent, with no possibility of getting saved in their lifetime.\u201cHaha!\u201dXuanyuan Po broke out into a loud laugh and then carried his silver spear, walking toward Sun Mo in huge strides.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201dQin Fen reached out his hand, wanting to pull Xuanyuan Po back. But how could he possibly stop something like this from happening?\u201cTeacher Sun Mo, please accept my bow!\u201dThe sight of Xuanyuan Po, with his height of over 1.8 meters and a muscular body, was as if a mountain of gold had been pushed and jade pillars had been toppled, as he dropped to his knees. When he smashed his forehead to the ground, it was as though some kind of metal was clanking.\u201cYou still have a chance to regret your decision!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t put on a proud front but asked him again. If the student was going to regret in the future, then it\u2019d be better off that they didn\u2019t establish this relationship in the first place.\u201cI, Xuanyuan Po, won\u2019t ever regret the things I say and do!\u201dXuanyuan Po recalled Sun Mo\u2019s assessment of him. It was true that he should be more decisive about things. Since he had already done it, then he shouldn\u2019t regret his decisions. He bowed once again. \u201cPlease grant me my wish, teacher!\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll take you in as my disciple!\u201dAfter Sun Mo said that, Xuanyuan Po gave three loud kowtows.\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201dThe sight of this scene agitated Qin Fen. He had a strong urge to hammer Sun Mo\u2019s head and smash it. He wasn\u2019t able to accept such a defeat.\u201cMy god!\u201dThe two intern teachers were so shocked that their jaws dropped to the ground. How could Xuanyuan Po acknowledge an intern teacher like Sun Mo as his master? This was too unbelievable!\u201cSenior Martial Sister!\u201dXuanyuan Po smiled at Lu Zhiruo. Over the one year plus, he had been fretting over such trivial matters. Now that he had acknowledged a teacher and things were decided, he followed what Sun Mo said, no longer being irresolute. He threw away all those things.Just as he tossed away those thoughts, Xuanyuan Po immediately felt his entire body relaxing. The bottleneck that he had been in for several months now showed signs of breaking through.Xuanyuan Po felt that he might have acknowledged a talented teacher!\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201dLu Zhiruo instantly felt at a loss and subconsciously hid behind Sun Mo. To think that there\u2019d come a day where she\u2019d be called senior martial sister, what a strange feeling! However, more of her feelings was that of horror and anxiety. She was worried that she might not be able to do well in this position, to be a good example to her martial junior!\u201cAlright, things are over now. Let\u2019s go and have a meal to celebrate!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo felt very happy to have gained two personal disciples in one go, one of which was a genius. This was an exhilarating feeling.\u201cI have gained some insights and want to meditate on it!\u201dXuanyuan Po reported and then sat down in lotus position.Sun Mo had no other choice. He couldn\u2019t possibly leave by himself and thus could only wait.The two intern teachers exchanged a glance, not knowing if they should go offer their congratulations or not. At this moment, Gu Xiuxun appeared in her blue robes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Behaving as if they were cocks in heat that were fighting for the right to mate, they instantly brought out their most perfect posture.\u201cTeacher Gu!\u201d\u201cTeacher Gu!\u201dThe two intern teachers went up, greeting her enthusiastically. Even the angered Qin Fen also took a deep breath and calmed the annoyance and anger in his heart.Gu Xiuxun nodded, greeting everyone in turn. She gave off a very good feeling.\u201cTeacher Gu is here for Xuanyuan Po?\u201dQin Fen knew that he had no hope, but he didn\u2019t wish for trash like Sun Mo to get his hands on Xuanyuan Po either. Seeing Gu Xiuxun\u2019s arrival, he immediately schemed in his mind.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dGu Xiuxun might seem calm on the surface, but she was secretly gloating. Qin Fen must have failed because of how angry he looked. This was why they said that the recruitment of a student wasn\u2019t determined by the order of appearance, but by one\u2019s strength.\u201cThen you\u2019ve come late. He has already acknowledged a teacher.\u201dThe uglier intern teacher took this chance to get close to Gu Xiuxun, trying to get into her good books. He could smell the fragrance coming from Gu Xiuxun and had a strong urge to take a deep whiff.\u201cHuh?\u201dGu Xiuxun lost her cool and was no longer smiling. She stared at Qin Fen. In her opinion, the other three weren\u2019t considered a threat, and her only enemy was Qin Fen who came from the Jixia Learning Palace.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to stare like that. It\u2019s not me!\u201dQin Fen shrugged.\u201cThen who is it?\u201dGu Xiuxun first looked toward the uglier intern teacher and then turned toward the ordinarily ugly-looking intern teacher. She then smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t like such jokes.\u201dGu Xiuxun was someone of ambition. She wanted to help Headmaster An Xinhui, whom she admired, to get the Central Province Academy back up. After entering the school, she immediately devoted herself entirely to her work.She had already gained some slight achievements.As a female teacher, and a beautiful one at that, Gu Xiuxun had a very big advantage. Almost all of the students whom she had guided while working as a teaching assistant fell to her charm.In order to get ten genius students from the student recruitment meet and break a new record, Gu Xiuxun had made many preparations a long time ago. When she noticed Xuanyuan Po this morning, she arranged for five students to follow him, and they would report his situation in half an hour intervals.Gu Xiuxun was in no hurry. It was because a student would be very careful when acknowledging a teacher. After all, their future was on the line. Moreover, she also had a few fixed targets to recruit and mustn\u2019t waste her time.Geniuses like Xuanyuan Po, who was highly regarded by Liu Mubai, must have many teachers coming to recruit him. Gu Xiuxun didn\u2019t wish to fight with those people since it\u2019d make her appear as if she was lacking in class. Therefore, she only came in the evening when there were fewer teachers.According to Gu Xiuxun\u2019s plan, Xuanyuan Po would definitely come into contact with many teachers throughout the day. He would also listen to many guidances, promises, and self-recommendations. Gu Xiuxun believed that her performance would definitely be able to win against those other teachers, giving Xuanyuan Po a stark comparison. He would know that she, Gu Xiuxun, was the most outstanding out of them all.Of course, after being surrounded and bombarded for the entire day, Xuanyuan Po would be feeling mentally fatigued. Therefore, his ability to consider things would naturally drop, which would also increase her chances of winning.After putting in so much effort, she was told that this guy had been recruited by someone when she had just met him and hadn\u2019t done anything yet? If it wasn\u2019t because she had to maintain her image, Gu Xiuxun would definitely smash the heads of these two intern teachers.\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201dThe uglier one of them quickly explained, worried that he\u2019d offend Gu Xiuxun.Sun Mo felt like laughing when he saw the uglier and ugly intern teachers hanging around Gu Xiuxun, currying up to her, worried that they\u2019d anger her. He looked at Gu Xiuxun and some data appeared.\u201cThen who has he been recruited by? You?\u201dGu Xiuxun\u2019s tone sounded a little cold. She was thinking that if someone like this ugly guy could recruit Xuanyuan Po, then she\u2019d kneel and lick his shoes.\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201dThe ugly intern teacher pointed at Sun Mo.\u201cHmm?\u201dGu Xiuxun turned and looked toward Sun Mo dubiously.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Qin Fen chipped in, sharing the entire story of what had happened earlier. In the end, he put out both his hands and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not as eloquent and can\u2019t win against him in words.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I feel that such guidance sounds more like sophistry.\u201dThe ugly intern teacher didn\u2019t wish for Sun Mo to stand out before Gu Xiuxun and thus vilified him.\u201cIt\u2019s a hoax, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe uglier one sounded even more hostile.Gu Xiuxun fell silent, assessing Sun Mo with a hostile gaze. How could she not feel angry when her prey had been snatched away? However, most of what she felt was helpless gloominess.She had thought that her competitors would be Liu Mubai and the other full-time teachers. Some of them could even be great teachers. Thus, she hadn\u2019t expected Sun Mo to succeed.This felt as if she had been sharpening her blade, preparing to snatch a rare monster from a group of elite players. However, the rare monster ended up being killed by a newbie player\u2026\u201cWhy is it him?\u201dAt this moment, Gu Xiuxun, who had always maintained her disposition of a graceful lady, felt like cursing. She couldn\u2019t accept a loss like this.\u201cThat\u2019s right, why is it him?\u201dThe two ugly intern teachers agreed. They wouldn\u2019t mind if they had lost to Liu Mubai or even Qin Fen. However, it felt really bad that they had lost to Sun Mo!\u201cThe kid had been duped. If you were to step in, there might be a chance of salvaging things.\u201d Qin Fen wore a pained expression. \u201cXuanyuan Po\u2019s aptitude isn\u2019t bad, but he\u2019d probably be a goner if he were to land in Sun Mo\u2019s hands.\u201dGu Xiuxun looked at Qin Fen and then followed him to walk up to Sun Mo.Lu Zhiruo immediately felt nervous and shrank to hide behind Sun Mo.Gu Xiuxun didn\u2019t say anything. She went on her tiptoes and inclined her body forward, staring into Sun Mo\u2019s eyes. It was as if she was a feline that was confronting its opponent in order to fight for the prey.Gu Xiuxun wanted to see through him, and she recalled her encounter with him at the battle hall. Could this guy have some capabilities?\u201cAre you hoping that I\u2019ll kiss you?\u201dSun Mo spoke up.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe two ugly intern teachers gasped, and Qin Fen\u2019s lips twitched, wanting to scold Sun Mo and ask if he was a fool. Gu Xiuxun clearly wanted to bite him to death.\u201cUrgh!\u201dGu Xiuxun, who had appeared aggressive, became like a punctured leather ball, losing her disposition. This was especially so after she saw Sun Mo inclining his body forward, as if wanting to kiss her. She quickly backed off in surprise, keeping her distance away from him.\u201cHehe!\u201dSun Mo was amused. Gu Xiuxun\u2019s anxious expression was a little cute.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dGu Xiuxun knew that she had been fooled and was very angry. She hadn\u2019t been taken advantage of like this over so many years. But after Sun Mo\u2019s teasing, her hostility had dissipated by a lot.\u201cYou won\u2019t be so lucky next time.\u201dGu Xiuxun left, taking graceful steps. Her fair neck made her look like a swan.\u201cShe has finally left.\u201dLu Zhiruo patted her chest. Gu Xiuxun\u2019s disposition earlier was scary.\u201cTeacher Gu\u2026\u201dQin Fen frowned. This wasn\u2019t the outcome that he wanted.Gu Xiuxun didn\u2019t bother to turn back. (Want to make use of me? Dream on!)Unable to get Xuanyuan Po, Qin Fen wanted Gu Xiuxun to seize the student. Even if she didn\u2019t succeed, it\u2019d at least make Sun Mo feel upset.\u201cI won\u2019t fall for the trick!\u201dGu Xiuxun was someone with a baseline. She wouldn\u2019t do something like snatching someone else\u2019s student. Moreover, she had her own consideration as well. After Xuanyuan Po followed Sun Mo for a while and found out that he was unable to perform as a teacher, Xuanyuan Po would want to leave. The chances of her success would be higher if she waited until then to make a move.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I can look for Xuanyuan Po at a suitable time, to talk about mundane matters and increase his good impression of me.\u201dGu Xiuxun quickly came up with a plan in her mind.Qin Fen didn\u2019t wish to see Sun Mo\u2019s face and swung his sleeve, leaving. The two ugly intern teachers both looked at Gu Xiuxun\u2019s back and then went after her. Even if they couldn\u2019t talk to her, it would be good if they could admire \u2018the view\u2019 for a little longer.Even salted fish had dreams. Maybe there\u2019d come a day where they\u2019d be able to touch her!The surroundings finally turned quiet.Just like someone who had managed to get good equipment in the game and couldn\u2019t help but take it out to admire it, Sun Mo activated his Divine Sight and marveled at Xuanyuan Po\u2019s data.(Oh, compared to earlier, his will has strengthened slightly. Now it\u2019s 6.)\u2018Remark, the target\u2019s mental state has grown and his will naturally increased.\u2019\u201cIs this thanks to me?\u201dSun Mo felt a little agitated.\u201cThat\u2019s right. This is the effect of a teacher. Please continue to work hard and nurture Xuanyuan Po well.\u201dThe system cheered for Sun Mo.Sun Mo heaved out a long exhale. Although he had successfully taken Xuanyuan Po as his disciple, he was a little worried that he might not be capable enough and waste this seed\u2019s future. Seeing that his will had increased by one, Sun Mo now felt a lot more confident.Ding!\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019ve finally gained your first personal disciple, taking a big stride on the great teacher path. You\u2019re rewarded with a mysterious treasure chest. I hope that you\u2019ll obtain greater achievements from now on.\u201dAs the system\u2019s notification rang out, a big treasure chest that was shrouded in purple light appeared before Sun Mo.\u201cOh, there\u2019s also a reward?\u201dThis was a pleasant surprise. The big treasure chest emitted a mysterious yet magnificent aura. It was clearly different from the bitchy lucky treasure chest.\u201cDo you want to open it?\u201dThe system asked.\u201cOf course!\u201dSun Mo patted the papaya girl\u2019s head. He should continue to ride on his wave of great luck today. He might just end up with something amazing.Lu Zhiruo tilted her head and blinked her big eyes as she looked at Sun Mo, not understanding why he was suddenly patting her head. However, she didn\u2019t dislike the feeling. On the contrary, she did enjoy it a little.The purple mysterious treasure chest opened upon command, and a tremendous amount of fog spewed out in all directions, like the steam coming from China\u2019s green train from the past. The treasure chest was then gradually revealed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA book that was glowing in purple light quietly floated in the air, like a bride waiting to get married, waiting for Sun Mo to touch it.\u201cI\u2019m done!\u201dXuanyuan Po jumped up and pounded his chest hard. He felt that his condition was amazing, and he had a strong urge to have a fight immediately. No, he couldn\u2019t wait.\u201cTeacher Sun, you guys can go and have your meal. I\u2019ll go and fight!\u201dXuanyuan Po picked up his spear, jumping up onto the warehouse\u2019s roof and disappearing without a trace before Sun Mo could say anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37: Why Is It Him?LordbluefireLordbluefireQin Fen felt that it was a humiliation to have failed to recruit Xuanyuan Po as his student and thus wouldn\u2019t speak of it to others. However, the two ugly intern teachers didn\u2019t have the same concerns. The process in which Sun Mo had convinced Xuanyuan Po made them speechless. It was like a toad having gotten to eat swan meat [1], and it was far too surprising. Therefore, after they returned to the dorm, they couldn\u2019t wait to share this matter to their dorm mates, and then the news spread wider and wider.On the second day of the student recruitment meet, the school continued to be swarming with people.Seated in the canteen, Zhang Sheng stirred the watery porridge in front of him, wearing a dim expression. His legs had almost broken from all the running around yesterday, and he had spoken so much that his voice was hoarse now. However, he hadn\u2019t even managed to recruit a single student.\u201cDon\u2019t be feeling down. This is how difficult it is for an intern teacher to recruit a student. I\u2019ve been rejected over 20 times yesterday.\u201dYuan Feng bite on his bun, only able to vent his frustrations on food.Zhang Sheng couldn\u2019t be bothered to care about Yuan Feng. However, at the thought of how he had been rejected for over 30 times as well, his countenance turned grim.\u201cThey are all fools, having no idea what they\u2019re missing out on.\u201dZhang Sheng felt that the students who had rejected him didn\u2019t know what was good for them.Ludi ate his rice porridge. After finishing this, he would still have to rush back to braise pig trotters. He knew his worth and thus hadn\u2019t thought of recruiting students.\u201cAs long as I can get Teacher Zhou to write good ratings about me, I will have the right to stay in school.\u201dLudi didn\u2019t have high expectations. He wanted to first stay in the school and then slowly climb up.\u201cHave you guys heard? Sun Mo managed to dupe Xuanyuan Po to be his student!\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be true, right? Xuanyuan Po didn\u2019t even care for Liu Mubai. How could he possibly accept Sun Mo?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Sun Mo go to the logistics department? Does he have the right to take in disciples?\u201dThe intern teachers from the next table were talking amongst themselves as they ate.Yuan Feng was curious and got closer to them. After hearing some of their talks, he was extremely astonished. \u201cAre you guys joking? Where did you hear this from? Someone like Sun Mo can manage to recruit Xuanyuan Po?\u201d\u201cSomeone saw it with their own eyes. Moreover, Qin Fen and Gu Xiuxun were present at that time as well\u2026\u201dBefore this intern teacher could finish his words, he heard a loud bang that gave him a big fright. He turned and saw that it was Zhang Sheng who had slammed his chopsticks onto the table.\u201cBullshit!\u201d Zhang Sheng bellowed furiously. \u201cHow is that Sun Mo worthy?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If Gu Xiuxun and Qin Fen were present, then it\u2019d be even more impossible for Xuanyuan Po to pick Sun Mo.\u201d Yuan Feng sat back and continued to eat his breakfast. \u201cDon\u2019t spread false rumors. Sun Mo must have gotten people to disseminate the rumors in order to spread his name and make it easier for him to recruit students.\u201dHearing Yuan Feng said that, the intern teachers started to feel dubious about the matter. After all, the chances of Sun Mo recruiting Xuanyuan Po were definitely zero.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is!\u201dZhang Sheng, who was feeling angry, was struck by a realization. (I knew it. If it\u2019s something I can\u2019t do, it\u2019d be impossible for Sun Mo to do it either!)\u2026In an office in the teaching building.There weren\u2019t any classes during these few days, but the full-time teachers weren\u2019t slacking either. Putting aside the fact that they were also choosing students, classes would start officially after the student recruitment meet ended. They would need to prepare the lesson plans and other documents in advance.Zhou Lin pushed the door and entered, smiling before she said anything. \u201cTeachers, do you guys have any hauls?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Assistant Lin.\u201d Teacher Zhou Shanyi, who was a little fat, patted his stomach and said, \u201cWhy? Are you here to find out news for Headmaster An?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also very concerned about you guys!\u201dZhou Lin pretended to be angry and rolled her eyes. However, teacher Zhou wasn\u2019t infuriated but enjoyed it instead. No matter what beautiful women did, it could be tolerated.\u201cDidn\u2019t the school gather some information about those outstanding students and gave it to us? I\u2019ve gone around and saw quite a few of them, so I have quite a haul.\u201dTeacher Jiang Yongnian, who always had his hair tidied neatly, picked up his teacup and took a sip, wearing a relaxed expression. He had just reached 30 years old and thus was quite competitive.Strong teaching capabilities weren\u2019t dependent on talk but the results! What were the results? To see if a teacher could produce outstanding students! And the first step of doing so was to recruit students.Although the school didn\u2019t provide any rewards, the teachers would all be competing both in the open and in the dark during the annual student recruitment meet, fighting for the outstanding students.\u201cOh, then I\u2019ll have to congratulate Teacher Jiang.\u201dZhou Lin congratulated.\u201cLiu Mubai, with his high expectations, had taken a liking to a young man called Xuanyuan Po. But what did you think happened?\u201dJiang Yongnian stroked the teacup, wearing a smile on his face.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dZhou Lin asked.\u201cThe guy rejected him.\u201dAlthough Jiang Yongnian was a 1-star great teacher, he knew that Liu Mubai, who hadn\u2019t gotten the \u20181-star great teacher\u2019 title, was a strong opponent. Therefore, he felt very happy to see Liu Mubai being defeated.\u201cThe youngsters these days are too prideful. They\u2019ll only realize what a precious opportunity they\u2019ve lost after encountering setbacks!\u201dLian Zheng viewed Liu Mubai in high regard and was very angry toward Xuanyuan Po.\u201cWas it because a great teacher with stars had made a move?\u201dZhou Lin wasn\u2019t surprised. Even An Xinhui had high expectations of Liu Mubai. However, the students didn\u2019t know that.\u201cNo.\u201dJiang Yongnian kept them in suspense. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make a guess?\u201d\u201cCould it be a teacher amongst you all?\u201dZhou Lin looked around, thinking of good things and praises she could say.\u201cThat\u2019s not it either.\u201dJiang Yongnian shook his head.Zhou Lin fell silent, her countenance turning grim. Her intelligence and emotional quotient weren\u2019t bad. Since Jiang Yongnian kept on denying her guesses, it meant that the teacher who had gotten Xuanyuan Po must be very special. Then, a thought struck her.\u201cCould it be Gu Xiuxun?\u201dThat was it. It would only be a surprise if an intern teacher managed to recruit a genius.\u201cTry again!\u201d Jiang Yongnian chuckled. \u201cBy the way, it\u2019s not those three graduates from the nine famous schools either.\u201dZhou Lin frowned. She had gone through those intern teachers\u2019 information herself and had memorized them. There wasn\u2019t anyone who stood out amongst them.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to guess? It\u2019s Sun Mo!\u201dLian Zheng was displeased. The reason Jiang Yongnian was saying this was to taunt Liu Mubai. He was telling everyone indirectly that Liu Mubai had lost to an intern teacher.\u201cWho?\u201dZhou Lin instantly stretched her neck up, like a fighting cock that had encountered an enemy.\u201cIt\u2019s Sun Mo.\u201d Jiang Yongnian fueled the conversation, sharing what he had heard. \u201cBut this kid is really sly. To think that he knew how to play with words.\u201dThe teachers in the office didn\u2019t say anything, but they shared similar sentiments, feeling that Sun Mo had tricked the naive Xuanyuan Po with his words.\u201cI feel that Sun Mo\u2019s status as Headmaster An\u2019s fianc\u00e9 has a greater effect.\u201dLian Zheng felt that Sun Mo was taking advantage of Headmaster An\u2019s authority. If he were to bring out this identity, even adults who didn\u2019t know of the story would be scammed, let alone students.\u201cNo matter what it is, Xuanyuan Po, who has good potential, is probably going to be wasted.\u201dJiang Yongnian sighed. If he was the one teaching Xuanyuan Po, he would definitely gain a position in the Greencloud Rankings.Zhou Lin chatted with them for a little longer before leaving. She then headed straight to the Headmaster\u2019s office.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dAn Xinhui heard the sound of Zhou Lin\u2019s anxious footsteps and thought that something serious had happened.\u201cXuanyuan Po has acknowledged Sun Mo as his teacher.\u201d Zhou Lin quickly shared the news she had heard earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s still not too late now. Quickly get Sun Mo to give up on Xuanyuan Po and pass him to Liu Mubai.\u201d\u201cCalm down first!\u201dAn Xinhui passed a cup of water to Zhou Lin.\u201cHow am I supposed to calm down? If this carries on, that Xuanyuan Po will be wasted!\u201dZhou Lin was very anxious. To the current Central Province Academy, all students with good potential mustn\u2019t be wasted. It was only by producing outstanding students would they have the right to be one of the nine Aristocratic Schools again.The summer wind blew in, causing An Xinhui\u2019s hair to flutter.\u201cEldest Miss, that guy is definitely scamming people using his status of being your fianc\u00e9. He must be warned. Otherwise, many students with good potential would be held back by him!\u201dZhou Lin was infuriated.\u201cThat won\u2019t happen!\u201d An Xinhui shook her head as she recalled distant memories. \u201cSun Mo isn\u2019t that kind of person.\u201d\u201cMy dear Eldest Miss, people change. You always see others in such a positive light.\u201dZhou Lin felt gloomy.\u201cI believe in Sun Mo.\u201dAn Xinhui insisted.\u201cAlright. Even if Sun Mo didn\u2019t use his status to dupe others, what will happen in the future? He is just a graduate from Songyang Academy. Will he be able to teach Xuanyuan Po?\u201dZhou Lin snuffed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that this young man was highly regarded by Liu Mubai, and even a few great teachers had their eyes on him. He must be a genius. What kind of joke is this?\u201dAn Xinhui continued with her work.\u201cEldest Miss, quickly think of a solution. It\u2019d be fine even if it\u2019s Gu Xiuxun and Qin Fen who gets Xuanyuan Po. But Sun Mo? Why is it him?\u201dZhou Lin was unhappy. It was like seeing a beautiful bride being slept by a smelly, dirty man from next door. Just the thought of it was disgusting.\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be him?\u201dAn Xinhui countered.\u201cIt\u2019s because\u2026\u201dZhou Lin had a whole bunch of reasons, but before she could list them out, An Xinhui interrupted her.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Go back to work.\u201dAn Xinhui\u2019s tone was very stern.Although Eldest Miss treated people very well, she would give off a very imposing feeling whenever she got angry. Zhou Lin didn\u2019t dare to defy An Xinhui, so she pouted her lips and then left unwillingly.An Xinhui continued with her work, but there was an additional distraction in her mind now. She put down her brush and walked to the window, looking down at the school ground.\u201cLittle Momo, it\u2019s fine if you can\u2019t help me, but I hope that you\u2019ll be able to prove yourself and not be belittled by those people.\u201dAn Xinhui stroked the carvings on the window sill, looking at the plants in the school. She seemed to be able to see a little boy who was always trailing behind her like a small cat, calling her \u2018elder sister, elder sister\u2019. Her lips curled up uncontrollably into a smile.This school held beautiful memories from her childhood, and she must protect them. If they wanted to remove this school\u2019s qualification rights, they could only do that over her dead body!\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo sat in a corner of the canteen, having porridge while admiring the beautiful book in front of him. It was shrouded in a purple glow, feeling both magnificent and mysterious.\u201cSystem, say it again!\u201dSun Mo requested.\u201cCongratulations on obtaining the elementary-grade divine-tier skill, \u2018Immemorial Vairocana!\u201d[1] A reference to the saying, a toad lusting after a swan\u2019s flesh, suggesting that someone craves for another person they aren\u2019t worthy of.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just as its name implied, only the divinities were able to grasp this skill. Just look at its literal meaning, even a three-year-old child would know how powerful this cultivation art was.\u201cSystem, say it again!\u201d Sun Mo requested.Are you done yet?\u201d System was unhappy. \u201cThis is already the 32nd time!\u201d\u201cSorry, I just can\u2019t control the agitation in my heart!\u201dSun Mo was an extremely unlucky person. For someone who had never received any consolation prize before, he had picked a divine skill this time around, so how could he not burst into tears? If he were to have a computer, he would have celebrated this joy with some beer and peanuts and played his computer games for three whole nights.He had to admit that the massive breasts did increase his luck value, especially when he received this treasure chest only after Lu Zhiruo acknowledged him as her master.Sun Mo decided to treat the shy and timid papaya girl better from now onward.\u201cImmemorial Vairocana. How poetic, how domineering. It\u2019s so lovable.\u201dSun Mo could feel the porridge in his mouth become sweeter and more fragrant.\u201cYou better know when to stop!\u201dThe system couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201cGrand Universe Formless Divine Art belongs to the peerless-grade saint-tier skill, and this is a divine skill, which one is more powerful?\u201dSun Mo was curious. As documented on the library, at Middle-Earth Nine Provinces, the best cultivation arts belonged to the saint-tier level, and they were deemed to be the least in quantity.\u201cDo you still need to ask? There are at least 5 people who know how to use Grand Universe Formless Divine Art. As for Immemorial Vairocana, it\u2019s exclusive to you.\u201dThe system spoke with arrogance.\u201cI understand now!\u201d Sun Mo was very pleased with this answer. \u201cAlright, system, you may leave now!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dIf the system was alive, it would have died from anger.Sun Mo dropped his spoon and concentrated on the cultivation art\u2019s practice.\u2018The moon shines in the past and present; nothing can hide from it. Even the inconsequential gravels of sand in the Ganges would be fully visible and traceable.\u2019 (the raws for immemorial vairocana can also be translated into \u2018boundless illumination from past till present, eternal sand has no vestiges\u2019, referencing that to this will make this sentence have more sense.)The introduction to the cultivation art had a domineering and strong description.\u2018When you attack someone with this skill, a part of their cultivation arts and techniques they learned will be condensed into a page and be beaten out from them.\u2019\u2018The more you attack, the more pages will pop out. Eventually, they will converge into a book that records the target\u2019s complete cultivation art, and you will be able to read it at will.\u2019\u2018When your proficiency in this skill increases, you can even extract the opponent\u2019s insights and experience. At its highest level, this skill can even derive the opponent\u2019s entire lifetime of cultivation, converging everything into a book.\u2019What did this signify?This signified that the peerless skills and knowledge, which others owned exclusively, would no longer be of secret to Sun Mo. As long as he could hit his opponent, he would be able to see everything.What was the world\u2019s most precious thing?It was neither gold and jewelry, nor was it loyalty and freedom. It was knowledge. Only knowledge was eternal.In Middle-Earth Nine Provinces, the martial dao reigned supreme. What did one depend on to have a strong martial dao? Cultivation arts!With \u2018Immemorial Vairocana\u2019, Sun Mo could learn every single one of them!\u201cDon\u2019t be complacent! Don\u2019t be complacent!\u201dSun Mo muttered, warning himself to keep a low profile. Even though this cultivation art was very strong, he needed to study the method of utilizing it. If he were to challenge a saint now, he would be killed before he could learn their exclusive cultivation arts.When playing computer games, Sun Mo always stood by a principle\u2014there was no such thing like the strongest profession, only the strongest player. Even if it was a divine skill, in the hands of different players, it would produce different results. In other words, it wouldn\u2019t do if he ignored everything and kept pressing the button \u2018Q\u2019, continuously spamming one\u2019s ultimate.\u201cI\u2019m happy!\u201dSun Mo decided to order one more egg.Nothing was wrong with the skill being in elementary grade. He could take it slow. Petite breasts would eventually develop into big breasts, and underripe girls would become elegant ladies one day.Lu Zhiruo was sitting at the side, drinking little sips of her porridge and glancing at her teacher from time to time. She could feel his good mood today!After having breakfast, Sun Mo continued cruising through the campus. Through yesterday\u2019s observation, he discovered that students with extremely high potential values were equivalent to extremely rare little elves. Not to mention catching, it was even hard to bump into one or two of them. Even students with high potential values were rare.\u201cSo, I should lower my expectations.\u201dSun Mo decided to be more practical.\u2026Li Ziqi stopped when she saw the gate of Central Province Academy and tidied the long pink skirt she was wearing. After confirming that her faint make-up was still there, she walked in.\u201cIt\u2019s all uncle\u2019s fault, had he not insisted on recommending some great teachers to me, I wouldn\u2019t have missed yesterday\u2019s attendance. I hope Sun Mo has not recruited any student yet.\u201dLooking at those young and tender faces in the campus, Li Ziqi felt a little worried as she wanted to become Sun Mo\u2019s first disciple. But she soon felt relieved.\u201cLi Ziqi, don\u2019t scare yourself. Sun Mo is just an intern teacher, so which student would want to be his personal disciple? Sun Mo must have been rejected continuously and is feeling very dejected now. Hmph, let Li Ziqi save you!\u201dJust thinking of this, Li Ziqi quickened her footsteps. While she was searching for Sun Mo\u2019s figure, her mind couldn\u2019t help but recall the day when Sun Mo saved her life at Yunting Lake.\u201c\u2018If your heart is clear, there\u2019s no need to fear any wind and rain\u2019. Sun Mo said it so well!\u201dLi Ziqi murmured.Under the shade of the tree next to the campus, there were more than ten groups of students squatting around. They had been commanded by their teachers to keep a watch on people. The moment they saw a teacher\u2019s targeted student, they must report back immediately.When Li Ziqi stepped through the school gate, everyone was expressionless for a moment, and a commotion followed thereafter.\u201cDid I see correctly? Isn\u2019t that Li Ziqi?\u201dThe gaze of an average-looking student followed Li Ziqi. He was stunned. Other students were flipping through the information booklets given to them by their teachers.It was of no surprise that the first person on the first page was Li Ziqi. Other students\u2019 drawings only consisted of head portraits, while Li Ziqi\u2019s drawing had a full-body portrait.\u201cWhat is Li Ziqi doing here? Even if she\u2019s not going to the Nine Greats, she should at least be at Myriad Daos Academy!\u201dAn uglier-looking student could not understand.\u201cShe could be here to join in the fun?\u201dAnother average-looking student made a guess. But after he spoke, the rest of the students started running off immediately. Hence, he quickly went to report to Teacher Jiang.Even though the teachers hadn\u2019t specifically mentioned Li Ziqi, since a student like her had arrived at the school, it was mandatory to report back immediately. Otherwise, they would be punished for it.Li Ziqi had only strolled for a while before a middle-aged teacher came up to recommend himself. But after speaking a few sentences, he walked off with disappointment.\u201cLook, even such an old guy who has been a teacher for over ten years stand no chance. It\u2019s even more impossible for us.\u201dYuan Feng felt a little nervous and scared.Zhang Sheng frowned as he looked at Li Ziqi. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking of ways to convince Li Ziqi to become his student.A student of Li Ziqi\u2019s level was actually out of his league. But since he encountered her by chance now, he must seize the opportunity.\u201cShould we\u2026should we tell Ludi?\u201dYuan Feng suggested.\u201cWhat is the use of telling him?\u201dZhang Sheng scoffed.Yuan Feng was stunned and couldn\u2019t help but let out a mocking smile. What he said was true, what could Ludi be doing here? Would he come to deliver some braised pig trotters? Li Ziqi wasn\u2019t Teacher Zhou and would not be enticed by a few pieces of braised meat.Eventually, Zhang Sheng realized that many teachers had come upon hearing the news. Some of them were daring and directly went up to recommend themselves, but the others with lower confidence just followed behind her, not leaving.\u201cSo many competitors!\u201dZhang Sheng observed his surroundings, calculating his probability of success. When he saw that Qin Fen was about to act, his heart instantly leaped into his throat.It was inevitable. The three words \u2018Jixia Learning Palace\u2019 were highly regarded.It took roughly ten seconds for Li Ziqi to reject him tactfully. Qin Fen stood at the same spot, looking embarrassed.\u201cEh, such a short amount of time, he probably has not even finished his self-introduction.\u201dLudi sighed. It seemed like the title of Jixia Learning Palace\u2019s graduate wasn\u2019t useful either.\u201cSee, he has not given up. He is chasing her up again.\u201dZhang Sheng was elated to see how Qin Fen faced defeat.Qin Fen\u2019s second round of self-recommendation was naturally fruitless. Li Ziqi wasn\u2019t annoyed and managed to reject him politely.This scene caused many unconfident teachers to cower.The morning\u2019s sunlight slowly became stronger.After following her for a while, Zhang Sheng started tidying his hair and arranging his collar. He carefully smoothened every crease along his long robe.\u201cZhang Sheng, cheer on, you are the best!\u201dAfter Zhang Sheng displayed his practiced smile, he quickened his footsteps and chased after Li Ziqi. He had decided to act before the great teachers arrived; otherwise, he might even lose the chance to recommend himself.Yuan Feng was stunned for a while before quickly chasing up. Even though he knew he had no chance, he wanted to get to know her as he had never interacted with anyone close to Li Ziqi\u2019s status.\u201cHi student Li, I am Zhang Sheng, a graduate of Songyang Academy.\u201dZhang Sheng did not stop Li Ziqi but followed beside her instead. He didn\u2019t introduce himself as an intern teacher; otherwise, he would be rejected immediately.\u201cI am Yuan Feng!\u201dYuan Feng squeezed out a vibrant smile.\u201cHi, both of you!\u201dLi Ziqi continued walking.\u201cIs student Li here to take a look around?\u201dZhang Sheng did not go straight to the point. By chatting casually, he wanted to first create a good atmosphere.(My gentle voice that sounds like a big brother next door would be able to leave a good impression, right?)Zhang Sheng was somewhat complacent.\u201cMn\u201dLi Ziqi observed her surroundings. Suddenly, her eyes lit up and she ran toward the direction of the nearby flower bed. \u201cTeacher Sun!\u201d\u201cWhat Sun?\u201dZhang Sheng had prepared more than ten back-up plans to ensure a smooth conversation with Li Ziqi, and he was confident that there would be no awkward silence. However, he was stunned when he heard the words \u2018Teacher Sun\u2019 come out of her mouth.\u201cHow sad, he didn\u2019t even get a chance to speak!\u201dYuan Feng felt a sense of gloat after seeing how Zhang Sheng faced his defeat, but as his gaze followed Li Ziqi\u2019s silhouette, his happiness turned into astonishment.Sun Mo was sitting next to the flower bed with a lady in green.\u201cShe couldn\u2019t be calling for Sun Mo, right?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYuan Feng murmured and shook his head. (What was I thinking? How could people like Sun Mo get to know Li Ziqi?)\u201cWhat kind of joke are you making?\u201dZhang Sheng complained. However, he had a bad premonition because Li Ziqi was running toward Sun Mo, and she even shouted.\u201cHi Teacher Sun, how are you?!\u201dLi Ziqi\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t loud, but under the bright morning sun, her voice pierced the ears of the teachers behind her, giving them a shock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he turned his head, he saw Li Ziqi running toward them.She was wearing a long pink skirt, and her black silky hair was tied with a pink ribbon. As she ran, her ponytail bounced up and down. She was full of vitality.When Lu Zhiruo saw that a stranger was jogging over, she shut her mouth and cowered behind Sun Mo\u2019s back.(Oh? A female student? Who is she? And what relationship does she have with Teacher Sun?)Li Ziqi looked at Lu Zhiruo\u2019s slim fingers. The former couldn\u2019t help but feel some unhappiness when she saw the latter holding onto Sun Mo\u2019s clothes.\u201cTeacher Sun, is she\u2026 Ah!\u201dLi Ziqi was about to question Sun Mo. But because she was distracted, she didn\u2019t notice a bump on the road and stumbled. She lost her balance and fell straight toward the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201dLi Ziqi closed her eyes, thinking that she would be disfigured this time. Luckily, with Sun Mo\u2019s sharp eyes and agile hands, he held her elbow in time.\u201cBe careful!\u201dSun Mo helped Li Ziqi up and stared at her with Divine Sight on. Rows and rows of data jumped out in that instant.Potential value: Extremely high!Remark, athletic ability: extremely low.\u2026Sun Mo ignored the remark straight away as he knew that it was normal for a genius to have a few shortcomings.\u201cMy shoes, my shoes don\u2019t fit well!\u201dLi Ziqi made an excuse to cover up the fact that her motoric senses were bad. At the same time, she quickly diverted the topic. \u201cHow was it? Did you get a little excited when I called you Teacher Sun?\u201dSun Mo shook his head.\u201cHmph!\u201d Li Ziqi pouted and looked at Lu Zhiruo. \u201cWho is she? Do you intend to take her as your personal disciple? How\u2019s her aptitude?\u201dBefore Sun Mo could answer, Zhang Sheng and Yuan Feng had walked over.\u201cHey, Sun Mo!\u201dZhang Sheng greeted Sun Mo with a friendly look. In front of an outsider, he had to hide his arrogance toward fellow teachers.Yuan Feng nodded, but his eyes couldn\u2019t look away from Lu Zhiruo\u2019s breasts. He had no choice; they were so big that he couldn\u2019t control his eyes.\u201cSun Mo, could you guess what I brought you?\u201dLi Ziqi called his name directly, wanting to say it a few more times. After all, she would have no more chance to do so in the future.\u201cHehe, I must have heard it wrongly!\u201dZhang Sheng heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing this salutation. He was happy he still had a chance. \u201cDo student Li and Sun Mo know each other?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dSun Mo was curious and looked at the calf leather satchel hanging on Li Ziqi\u2019s waist.\u201cIt\u2019s students\u2019 information!\u201dLi Ziqi tossed out a thick booklet and passed it to Sun Mo. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to waste your time anymore; you can recruit students more effectively with this booklet.\u201dYuan Feng gulped as he looked at the information booklet and subconsciously reached his hands out to take it. He remembered someone promoting this to him before, but he couldn\u2019t bear to buy it as it was too expensive.\u201cTsk, this information booklet is very expensive, how much did student Li spend?\u201dZhang Sheng tried to interrupt. \u201cSun Mo, you better remember student Li\u2019s kind intentions!\u201d\u201cQuickly open it, I have marked the good students with a red-inked brush!\u201dLi Ziqi moved next to Sun Mo, helping him to flip the pages and starting to recommend each student.\u201cHow much did you spend? I\u2019ll pay you back.\u201dSun Mo frowned. He had never taken advantage of any student; hence, he was prepared to return the money to her.\u201cOh well, it\u2019s not that expensive!\u201dLi Ziqi didn\u2019t seem to bother.\u201cI recall it now. It should have cost you around one thousand taels of silver, right?\u201dZhang Sheng continued to interrupt, but Li Ziqi\u2019s peripheral vision didn\u2019t even land on him. He felt extremely angry and awkward.He couldn\u2019t even join in their conversation. Li Ziqi pretended not to hear his question, but once Sun Mo asked something, she replied immediately.He thought to himself, why would she treat him with such double standards? He couldn\u2019t have been any worse than Sun Mo.Even Yuan Feng, who was beside them, could feel the awkwardness. Zhang Sheng had always been proud of himself and looked down on others, but he was being ignored now.Normally, Yuan Feng would have walked away after seeing all these. He didn\u2019t like to receive cold shoulders. However, when facing Li Ziqi, he couldn\u2019t bear to leave even if he had to receive cold treatment.Sun Mo was indeed very lucky to have a girl buy an information booklet worth a thousand silver taels for him.Yuan Feng looked at Li Ziqi who was innocent and cute. Seeing her quick-witted eyes and an oval-shaped face full of charming grace, Yuan Feng was drowned by gushes of envy and hatred.\u201cHow could it be Sun Mo?\u201dYuan Feng couldn\u2019t help but feel angry.Lu Zhiruo was not tall. She had to tiptoe and hold onto Sun Mo\u2019s elbow to look at the information booklet.\u201cSun Mo, who is she?\u201dLi Ziqi saw how Lu Zhiruo\u2019s breasts were squeezed against Sun Mo\u2019s elbows. It had formed an exaggerated curve on her green clothing. She thought to herself, \u2018Lu Zhiruo must have done this on purpose!\u2019\u201cShe\u2019s my student!\u201dSun Mo replied casually, but Li Ziqi\u2019s smile froze in that instant. Her heart was filled with frustration, and she tightened her fists.She was crying in her head and couldn\u2019t help but blame her uncle. She had gone to meet a great teacher and that had delayed her arrival by a day. Her title of first personal disciple was gone now.(No, I must not give up.)Li Ziqi gritted her teeth and smiled after cheering herself on. \u201cOh? Then I must congratulate Teacher Sun. Hey, have you acknowledged him as your master?\u201dThe second half of the sentence was clearly directed at Lu Zhiruo.Lu Zhiruo was startled as she could feel a strange sense of hostility. She cowered behind Sun Mo like a little kitten, his body acting as a barrier between her and Li Ziqi.\u201cYes\u2026..yes I have!\u201dLu Zhiruo stuttered.\u201cTo acknowledge one as your master, you must have prepared a ceremony and chosen an auspicious date!\u201dJust by looking at Lu Zhiruo\u2019s clothes, Li Ziqi knew that she didn\u2019t have much money. She was certain Lu Zhiruo had completed the ceremony with just 3 kowtows. This was her only chance to seize back the status of the first disciple; hence, she had intentionally described the ceremony as a serious affair.(Li Ziqi, you\u2019re truly a genius!)Li Ziqi knew she had a perfect plan, and her brows raised in delight.\u201cI don\u2019t do such ceremonies. It\u2019s fine with me as long as I know the student\u2019s intentions.\u201dSun Mo hated these unnecessary and over-elaborate formalities.\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t do, acknowledging one as a master is no child\u2019s play!\u201dLi Ziqi insisted.(I\u2019m done for! I\u2019m done for!)Zhang Sheng was so heartbroken that he couldn\u2019t breathe. He knew he wasn\u2019t overthinking it. Li Ziqi was here to acknowledge Sun Mo as her master. Moreover, her way of seizing the title of first disciple showed that she had planned this.Yuan Feng looked at Sun Mo and Lu Zhiruo, and he couldn\u2019t hide the shock on his face. All he could think of was how this big-breasted girl said, \u2018yes I have\u2019.\u201cHow could you have acknowledged him as your master? D*** it, Sun Mo has a student already? Did you cheat? Yes, you must have cheated!\u201dYuan Feng yelled out without thinking.Shoosh!Li Ziqi looked at Yuan Feng unhappily. Just when she was about to berate him, she held back her words. She figured she could make use of this guy to make the big-breasted girl leave.Lu Zhiruo got a scare and quickly explained, \u201cNo, Teacher Sun didn\u2019t cheat. I acknowledged him willingly.\u201dDon\u2019t believe him, he has a shady history.\u201dYuan Feng became even braver when he saw that Li Ziqi was reactionless.\u2018My student\u2019?Hearing those words from Sun Mo, Yuan Feng murmured. How cool! He wished he had the chance to say those words too.Sun Mo was upset and rested his left hand on the wooden blade\u2019s handle.\u201cWhy? Do you want to fight now after being angered by Yuan Feng\u2019s words?\u201dZhang Sheng spoke as well. He could use this chance to kick Sun Mo while he was down.\u201cWho wants to fight?\u201dA sudden clear and lucid voice interrupted Zhang Sheng\u2019s words. When he turned his head, his expression became serious once he saw Gu Xiuxun and Liu Mubai.His chances of recruiting Li Ziqi became non-existent.\u201cTea\u2026Teacher Gu.\u201dYuan Feng couldn\u2019t even speak clearly anymore after smelling Gu Xiuxun\u2019s fragrance. This was his first time being so close to her.\u201cHi, student Li Ziqi. I am Liu Mubai, I believe you have heard my name before.\u201dLiu Mubai didn\u2019t even bother to greet the rest and spoke to Li Ziqi straight away. His attitude was extremely arrogant, but Zhang Sheng and Yuan Feng didn\u2019t dare to complain. They were afraid of offending him and tried their best to let out a smile.If this was in the past, Li Ziqi wouldn\u2019t even bother. But since she was unhappy to see how Sun Mo was being treated, she spoke mercilessly, \u201cSorry, I haven\u2019t heard of you.\u201dZhang Sheng and Yuan Feng had almost laughed out loud when they saw Liu Mubai\u2019s countenance, but they managed to hold it back. On the other hand, Lu Zhiruo started laughing.\u201cHehe!\u201dThen, Lu Zhiruo slowly realized that the atmosphere wasn\u2019t right. She quickly cowered and hid behind Sun Mo\u2019s back.\u201cStudent Li, I am Gu Xiuxun, this year\u2019s honor graduate of Myriad Daos Academy!\u201dGu Xiuxun introduced herself with much confidence and charm.(She\u2019s actually a masochist!)In his heart, Sun Mo added a description for Gu Xiuxun. He hadn\u2019t thought the magnanimous and strong-looking Gu Xiuxun would have a different side of her.\u201cTeacher Gu, are you competing with me?\u201dLiu Mubai turned his head slightly. Sharpness penetrated from the narrow corner of his eyes.\u201cI dare not! I\u2019m just a passer-by joining in the fun.\u201dGu Xiuxun knew that many great teachers were waiting to recruit students like Li Ziqi.She came over only because she wanted to see Liu Mubai face a rejection.Of course, she would never let people know of her intention.\u201cStudent Li Ziqi, please allow me to introduce myself?\u201dUnder usual circumstances, the proud Liu Mubai would have left after being angered, but he couldn\u2019t leave this time around. He knew that his future would be positively influenced if he were to recruit Li Ziqi as his student; hence, he tolerated his unhappiness.He knew that life\u2019s journey would not be smooth-sailing, and this must be heaven\u2019s test for him!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter figuring out his thoughts, Liu Mubai\u2019s mood basked under the summer day\u2019s sunlight and improved greatly.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to. I know your purpose for coming, but I already have a teacher in mind.\u201dLi Ziqi rejected him. She was already very frustrated, having to deal with all kinds of teachers recently.Liu Mubai\u2019s words were all stuck at his throat. His expression was a mix of anger and awkwardness after being rejected so directly.Instead of sunshine, Liu Mubai felt as though a big pouring rain was drenching him from head to toe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40: Apologize to Teacher Sun!The scene now was extremely awkward!Ever since Liu Mubai got into the Greencloud Rankings and became a dazzling genius, to say nothing of being a graduate from the Black-White Academy with the third-best results, all he enjoyed was praise. When had he ever been treated like this before?For a while, Liu Mubai\u2019s heart was filled with anger. If the truth was that his skill was inferior to others, he could forget about it. However, he hadn\u2019t even displayed his talent yet.\u201cMight I ask an impudent question? Which of you is Student Li\u2019s teacher?\u201dLiu Mubai swept his gaze over at the three of them.How would Zhang Sheng and Yuan Feng dare to offend Liu Mubai? When they saw that his eyes were like fire, like branding iron capable of scorching their skin, they were so afraid that they hurriedly clarified things.\u201cIt isn\u2019t me!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also not me!\u201dTheir nervous appearances made it seem as though they almost wanted to strip their pants to prove their innocence.Liu Mubai\u2019s gaze landed on Sun Mo.\u201cIt\u2019s me then?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s EQ was ordinary. But now that things had reached such an extent, if he still couldn\u2019t discern Li Ziqi\u2019s intent, that would truly be too foolish of him.(You are showing off after getting the benefits? You are definitely doing so! Damn, I really want to smack your face rotten!)It was as though there was an angry bull roaring in Zhang Sheng\u2019s heart.\u201cTeacher Sun, you saved me in the Yunting Lake. From that time on, I am already your disciple,\u201d Li Ziqi explained.However, the truth was naturally not like this.Li Ziqi had encountered many annoying matters recently. This was especially so when her father used all his connections and paid out a huge sum of money to find a secondary saint as a teacher for her. But in the end, because her energy circulation was bad, she got rejected.This had caused her to blame herself. She felt inferior because she had let down her father\u2019s expectations. Hence, she went to Yunting Lake to relax.Because of misunderstanding, Li Ziqi had jumped into the lake to save Sun Mo but had ended up being saved instead. She felt some gratitude for Sun Mo. However, it was still that sentence of Sun Mo \u2013 \u2018If your heart is clear, there\u2019s no need to fear any wind and rain!\u2019 \u2013 that caused her favorable impression of him to greatly increase. He allowed her to see a ray of hope in her life that was not going that smoothly.At that time, Li Ziqi did think of acknowledging Sun Mo as her master. Hence, after seeing how Sun Mo guided Qi Shengjia, she made a resolution in her heart.Naturally, Li Ziqi wouldn\u2019t tell anyone about these. She kept insisting that after she had met Sun Mo back then, she already wanted to take him as a master. If not, the identity of his number one personal disciple would fly away.When she thought of this, Li Ziqi couldn\u2019t help but glance at Lu Zhiruo. (Hmph, are you that impressive just because you have large breasts? The position of the eldest martial sister definitely belongs to me!)\u201cOh?\u201dSun Mo furrowed his brows slightly.\u201cYes, I even tied a handkerchief on your wrist. That was my token of sincerity!\u201dWhen she dived into the water, all the valuable stuff on her was washed away. Other than a satchel that was filled with water, she only had a handkerchief left. Hence, she chose to give him the handkerchief.Sun Mo observed Li Ziqi. Although the system had given him a mission to make Li Ziqi wholeheartedly acknowledge him as her master, now that it was completed, Sun Mo wanted to ask her reason. He wanted to ask this even though it might offend Li Ziqi.There were too many people in the surroundings, and Sun Mo didn\u2019t wish to let people like Gu Xiuxun feel that Li Ziqi was losing out on this. Hence, he controlled himself and didn\u2019t ask.\u201cStudent Li Ziqi, you might be mistaken. Sun Mo lives in the same dorm as me, and I\u2019m very clear about his standard. He doesn\u2019t even have the qualifications to be a teacher and is merely a staff in the logistics department,\u201d said Zhang Sheng.He was so jealous at the moment that he felt like he was about to explode. He would rather help Liu Mubai than to let Sun Mo succeed.\u201cHis character is also problematic. He even hired students to act and boost his reputation. You must have been swindled by him,\u201d chortled Yuan Feng who had just regained his senses. Regardless of whether it worked or not, Liu Mubai would definitely remember this favor.He naturally had to grab hold of such a good opportunity.Upon hearing the words \u2018hired students to act\u2019, Zhang Sheng\u2019s eyelids twitched. However, he was also a scheming individual and immediately pointed the arrowhead at Lu Zhiruo.\u201cThis student, why do you want to be his disciple?\u201dFrom Zhang Sheng\u2019s point of view, Sun Mo didn\u2019t have any ability. He must have used some methods to swindle this cowardly little girl over. As long as she said the process, Sun Mo\u2019s ugly deeds would be exposed here.\u201cThat\u2019s right, don\u2019t be afraid. Bravely say everything!\u201d Yuan Feng encouraged her.Swish~Upon being stared at by everyone, Lu Zhiruo was like a frightened rabbit. She hurriedly shrank back and hid behind Sun Mo. However, she extended her head out an instant later and courageously shouted, \u201cTeacher Sun is a good person!\u201d\u201cYou must have been swindled.\u201d Yuan Feng felt bitter and hateful.\u201cShut up!\u201d Li Ziqi couldn\u2019t bear to listen on any longer. She was so angry that her steel plate-like chest was shaking. \u201cApologize!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dYuan Feng was badly frightened.\u201cApologize to Teacher Sun right now!\u201dLi Ziqi glared at Yuan Feng, feeling extreme loathing for this person. This person\u2019s words no longer targeted Sun Mo\u2019s teaching capabilities but his character. If this was to spread out, it would destroy Sun Mo\u2019s image.\u201cI\u2026\u201dYuan Feng stuttered. This was especially so when he thought of Li Ziqi\u2019s identity. All of a sudden, he felt regret for shooting his mouth off.\u201cApologize!\u201dLi Ziqi persisted.Being glared at by Li Ziqi\u2019s large eyes, Yuan Feng couldn\u2019t withstand the pressure. He lowered his head. \u201cSo..sorry!\u201d\u201cAnd you!\u201dLi Ziqi glared at Zhang Sheng.\u201cI\u2019m helping you!\u201dZhang Sheng explained, staring at Li Ziqi with a look of lament on his face, like he was looking at a lost sheep.\u201cWhat qualifications do you have to help me?\u201d Li Ziqi counter-asked.\u201cJust apologize. Your ways of speaking could cause harm to a teacher!\u201d Gu Xiuxun spoke.If even the teachers couldn\u2019t be a good example, how could students adore and respect them? There were no problems if they wanted to vie over students, but using such a method was truly disgusting.Zhang Sheng\u2019s expression was unsightly to the extreme. He wanted to avoid the problem by leaving, but he didn\u2019t dare to. If Li Ziqi reported this matter to the higher-ups in the school, he would definitely be fired.(Why does she want to protect Sun Mo!?)Zhang Sheng roared in his heart. After that, he lowered his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dThese three words were like thorns that pierced his pride. What extraordinary shame and humiliation was this?!Gu Xiuxun curiously stared at Sun Mo, also having no idea how he had convinced Li Ziqi. But from the looks of things, this girl seemed to have a very favorable opinion of him.\u201cWhat are you all arguing about?\u201dA middle-aged man walked over, imposing without being angry. Two strands of golden thread could be seen on his collar and cuff.This was the sign of a 2-star teacher.\u201cTeacher Xu!\u201dEven Liu Mubai was also respectfully greeting the newcomer at this moment. He was named Xu Shaoyuan, a 2-star teacher.\u201cZiqi, how\u2019s your aunt recently?\u201dActually, Xu Shaoyuan had only met Li Ziqi\u2019s aunt once or twice. But by asking like this, it could make it seem that he had a close relationship with her aunt.\u201cYou are?\u201d Li Ziqi asked.\u201cHe is Teacher Xu Shaoyuan!\u201d Zhang Sheng hurriedly introduced.Joy was rising in his heart, and he couldn\u2019t help but glance at Sun Mo. (Wanting to accept Li Ziqi as your disciple? Go and continue dreaming. Now, with the appearance of a 2-star teacher, you better scram as far as you can!)\u201cTeacher Xu, you also want to recruit me as your personal disciple? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve already acknowledged a master!\u201dLi Ziqi didn\u2019t wish to play these games. It was so tiring.Xu Shaoyuan\u2019s lips twitched. He felt a little unhappy. However, given his self-restraint, he wouldn\u2019t display it. On the contrary, he was smiling instead.\u201cOh, it must be Mubai, right? Congratulations!\u201d Xu Shaoyuan pretended not to know and laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s not me!\u201dLiu Mubai shook his head.\u201cMn?\u201dXu Shaoyuan glanced toward Gu Xiuxin.\u201cTeacher Xu, it\u2019s Sun Mo!\u201dGu Xiuxun had made some inquiries about Xu Shaoyuan\u2019s character. He was extremely narrow-minded. Hence, she didn\u2019t want to inspire jealousy and hatred from such a person.(What\u2019s going on with this Li Ziqi? She doesn\u2019t even want to consider a 2-star teacher. Was her brain spoiled?)Zhang Sheng\u2019s gaze was sluggish. Yuan Feng, who was at the side, couldn\u2019t understand this as well. What sort of bewildering soup did Sun Mo give this girl?\u201cSun Mo?\u201dXu Shaoyuan followed the gazes of everyone and turned to Sun Mo. He had an impression of this name. \u201cAre you An Xinhui\u2019s fiance?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t expect Li Ziqi to attract a 2-star great teacher over. It seemed like he had underestimated her.\u201cYou are still an intern teacher, right?\u201dXu Shaoyuan\u2019s attitude was like someone lofty speaking down to a subordinate. Leaving aside the fact that Sun Mo was an intern teacher, even if he was a teacher with tens of years of experience, Xu Shaoyuan would still dare to scold him. \u201cStudent Ziqi is a good seedling. You won\u2019t be able to teach her well with your ability. You would only waste her talent!\u201dThese words were enough. He wanted Sun Mo to give up.Zhang Sheng and Yuan Feng suddenly felt joy in Sun Mo\u2019s calamity when they heard these words. (Show me what you will do now!)(Do you dare to defy the words of a 2-star great teacher? If you dare to, just wait for the consequences then!)Gu Xiuxun shook her head silently. She held Xu Shaoyuan\u2019s actions in contempt.\u201cSun Mo, our school\u2019s current situation isn\u2019t too good. We need to raise a few good students, so our school can pull through. A genius like Ziqi needs to be nurtured heavily, and you are not qualified yet!\u201dWhen Xu Shaoyuan said the last five words, he purposely emphasized on them.Gu Xiuxun sighed in her heart. These words weren\u2019t pleasant to hear, but he did have the qualifications to say them. After all, Xu Shaoyuan was a 2-star great teacher.\u201cTeacher Xu\u2026\u201dLi Ziqi couldn\u2019t bear to continue listening. Just when she wanted to speak, someone held her back. She turned her head and saw Sun Mo looking straight at her.The two of them didn\u2019t say anything. But at that instant where their gazes locked, it was as though a thousand messages were transmitted between them.LI Ziqi came to the Central Province Academy precisely because she wanted to acknowledge Sun Mo as her master.If not, given her family background, she would have countless better choices.\u201cI understand!\u201dSun Mo smiled. He used some strength and pulled Li Ziqi behind him. After that, he looked straight at Xu Shaoyuan. \u201cSorry, whether my teaching ability is good or bad, that\u2019s not up to you. That would only be determined after a test!\u201dThese words were so tyrannical!Liu Mubai stared at Sun Mo in amazement, not understanding how Sun Mo had the courage to argue head-on against a 2-star teacher. Did he not understand the consequences of his action?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Sheng and Yuan Feng were in a daze. Had Sun Mo gone crazy? Why did he use such an attitude to speak to a 2-star great teacher? But after that, wild joy filled their hearts.Sun Mo was finished. His teaching career was absolutely finished!(Ze, you are quite manly!)Gu Xiuxun was astonished. After that, she couldn\u2019t help but silently praise Sun Mo. She could tell that Li Ziqi wasn\u2019t willing to acknowledge Xu Shaoyuan as her master, but if this girl rejected him directly, even if Xu Shaoyuan didn\u2019t dare to say anything due to Li Ziqi\u2019s status, he would definitely slander her from the shadows. If these words were to circulate out, it would be very bad for Li Ziqi. And now, Sun Mo\u2019s action was actually to protect Li Ziqi.This also meant that Sun Mo had to endure all the pressure and hostility from Xu Shaoyuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She couldn\u2019t help but reach out and grab onto Sun Mo\u2019s clothes.Ding!+20 favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo.Prestige Connection with Lu Zhiruo: Neutral (38/100).Li Ziqi stood behind Sun Mo, looking at his broad back that seemed like a tall mountain. It blocked off Xu Shaoyuan\u2019s threatening face, and a strong sense of security gushed toward her.Li Ziqi had felt a little worried prior to this. After all, Sun Mo was too young and could be lacking in his teaching capabilities. However, at this moment, she knew that she had made the best decision in her life.Ding!+15 favorable impression points from Li Ziqi.Prestige Connection with Li Ziqi: Neutral (50/100).Xu Shaoyuan\u2019s countenance was grim, and his body inclined forward slightly. He stared at Sun Mo like a majestic lion who was about to swing out its sharp claws and tear its prey.Sun Mo wasn\u2019t scared and didn\u2019t back off at all.\u201cGood! Very good!\u201d Xu Shaoyuan patted Sun Mo\u2019s shoulder while forcing a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re very good!\u201dPa!Sun Mo slapped away Xu Shaoyuan\u2019s hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me that. I know that I\u2019m very good!\u201dSsss!Everyone drew in a cold gasp. This time around, even the calm Liu Mubai felt a little astonished. Sun Mo\u2019s actions were surely a provocation!Gu Xiuxun backed off one step, assessing Sun Mo seriously. An Xinhui\u2019s fiance was amazing. To think that he would dare to go against a 2-star great teacher? Did he not know how the word \u2018death\u2019 was written?Both Zhang Sheng and Yuan Feng were so excited their blood vessels were going to erupt. They couldn\u2019t wait to see Xu Shaoyun slap Sun Mo into a mush.\u201cStudent Ziqi, I hope that you\u2019ll gain achievements under Sun Mo\u2019s teachings!\u201dAfter Xu Shaoyuan finished his words, he turned and left. However, people who knew his temper would know that Sun Mo would be given a hard time in the future.Great teachers wanted face as well. It\u2019d be a complete humiliation to Xu Shaoyuan if he didn\u2019t get Sun Mo to kneel and call him \u2018father\u2019 before quitting.He had personally gone to recruit a student but ended up getting rejected. It\u2019d be fine if the student followed a great teacher of the same rank as him but to think that it was an intern teacher. If word of this were to spread, Xu Shaoyuan would be better off dead. It was utter humiliation.At this moment, Xu Shaoyuan hated himself for being too rash and hadn\u2019t done any probings in advance.This wasn\u2019t Xu Shaoyuan\u2019s fault either. There weren\u2019t that many 2-star great teachers in Jinling City. With his status, he\u2019d be highly revered no matter where he went.Ever since he gained the title of a 1-star great teacher, he had been revered by others. That led to his pride swelling up.Liu Mubai left. He didn\u2019t care to say goodbye to Sun Mo. As for Li Ziqi, although she had a respectable identity, he decided to give up on her.\u201cSun Mo\u2026\u201dGu Xiuxun had just called out when she was interrupted by Sun Mo.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you leaving? Are you planning to get me to treat you to lunch?\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t feeling happy as he had offended a 2-star great teacher out of nowhere. However, he wasn\u2019t afraid of Xu Shaoyuan\u2019s revenge. With a blade in his hand and courage within him, there was nothing he was afraid of.Gu Xiuxun\u2019s countenance stiffened up slightly. She didn\u2019t want to pay any heed to Sun Mo, but she couldn\u2019t just speak to Li Ziqi directly. It\u2019d make her out to appear too material. That was why she had taken an indirect approach to this; however, she didn\u2019t expect Sun Mo to be so spiteful.\u201cI can be the one treating you!\u201dGu Xiuxun wore a beautiful smile on her face. She even ran her hand through her beautiful black hair, giving off a feminine and alluring vibe.Gu Xiuxun could make use of her body language to strengthen the impact of her words.\u201cNot free! Not hungry! Goodbye!\u201dSun Mo gave three replies in succession and then left.Li Ziqi and Lu Zhiruo exchanged a glance and then immediately went after Sun Mo, following behind him.\u201cHe\u2019s too repulsive. Who does he think he is?\u201dYuan Feng was enraged. He wanted to talk to Gu Xiuxun but was hesitant and didn\u2019t dare to do so.\u201cThis Sun Mo is too arrogant!\u201d Zhang Sheng said. He then put up what he thought was his most handsome smile as he looked toward Gu Xiuxun. \u201cTeacher Gu, don\u2019t mind him. One day, there\u2019ll be someone teaching Sun Mo a lesson for being so arrogant.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201dGu Xiuxun answered half-absently, but her gaze was on Sun Mo\u2019s back. An indescribable feeling was stuck in her chest.As the top beauty of the Myriad Daos Academy, Gu Xiuxun was used to having men trying to get into her good books. It was a very refreshing feeling to be suddenly rejected by Sun Mo openly in public.\u201cThose onlookers must be laughing at me, right? Especially those women who are jealous of me and the men whom I\u2019ve rejected. They must be mocking and slandering me behind my back.\u201dAt the thought of this, Gu Xiuxun suddenly felt a little excited.\u201cTeacher Gu, do you have time in the afternoon? Why don\u2019t we have lunch together? We can talk about teaching over the meal as well.\u201dZhang Sheng appeared to be saying this very casually, but he was feeling extremely nervous. He kept on wishing in his heart that she would agree.\u201cNot free! Not hungry! Goodbye!\u201dGu Xiuxun gave the same reply Sun Mo had given her, and she realized that these three lines were very impactful. She could consider using them to reject those detestable suiters.If the invitation was from Liu Mubai, Gu Xiuxun would definitely accept it. But who was Zhang Sheng? Even if he managed to stay in the school, they\u2019d still be from different worlds.\u201cUrgh!\u201dHearing these three short replies, Zhang Shen was first stunned and then his countenance turned grim. This was absurd, really absurd.(Bitch, you\u2019re looking down on me? One day, I\u2019ll get you to kneel and lick my shoes!\u201d)Zhang Sheng stared at Gu Xiuxun\u2019s beautiful figure and swore in his heart.\u201cSigh!\u201dYuan Feng sighed. As expected, it was impossible to successfully invite Gu Xiuxun. However, he then felt a little indignant. It was because Gu Xiuxun had invited Sun Mo and was also rejected rudely\u2026\u201cWho is Sun Mo to do that?\u201dYuan Feng couldn\u2019t understand. In his opinion, that guy who sponged off a woman was worse than himself. That was right. It must be because of Li Ziqi that Gu Xiuxun would take the initiative to invite him. Otherwise, how could he possibly have that kind of charm?However, at the thought of Li Ziqi acknowledging Sun Mo as her teacher, Yuan Feng sank into a deep bout of envy once again. Who was Sun Mo to be so privileged? Did he have a big p*nis?\u2026In the office of the teaching building.Since many teachers had arranged for students to keep watch at the school\u2019s entrance, everyone soon received news that Li Ziqi had come.\u201cShe should have gone to the Myriad Daos Academy. Why did she come to our school?\u201dZhou Shanyi couldn\u2019t understand. Given the current teaching capabilities and future prospects, the Myriad Daos Academy, which was a notch higher than the Central Province Academy, would be the top pick for those influential people.\u201cShe must be here to play?\u201dSomeone spoke up, not feeling that their school would be able to attract Li Ziqi.\u201cCould it be that there\u2019s a teacher here that Li Ziqi would like to learn from?\u201d Lian Zheng guessed.It was very common in the Central Province that students would join a certain school for the sake of a particular great teacher. This was the great attraction that great teachers had. Therefore, when the opportunity arose, all schools would go all-out to fight for the great teachers, even forking out extremely high salaries.Just as the teachers were discussing amongst themselves, Jiang Yongnian entered hurriedly.\u201cWhy are you so happy? Could it be that you\u2019ve managed to recruit Li Ziqi?\u201dZhou Shanyi teased.\u201cI know my own worth well!\u201d Jiang Yongnian rolled his eyes. He wasn\u2019t willing to give up on Li Ziqi. After all, she had a very distinguished status. However, he hadn\u2019t expected to have come across a good show. \u201cGuess what did I see just now?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dZhou Shanyi sipped on his tea slowly.\u201cXu Shaoyuan went to recruit Li Ziqi but was rejected.\u201dJiang Yongnian had never liked Xu Shaoyuan who was merely a 2-star great teacher. He would be able to reach 2-star very soon himself. So, seeing Xu Shaoyuan in a bad plight felt as comfortable as if he was eating chilled watermelon on the hottest day of the year.\u201cIsn\u2019t that normal?\u201dLian Zheng was speechless. It would be surprising if Xu Shaoyuan were to succeed.\u201cNo, the reason Li Ziqi rejected him was because she has already acknowledged a teacher.\u201dJiang Yongnian\u2019s words caused the other teachers who hadn\u2019t been paying attention to stop their work and look over.\u201cWho is it? Is it Teacher Jin Mujie? No, a 3-star great teacher\u2019s attraction is probably still not enough?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be Headmaster An, right?\u201d\u201cI wonder who will have the good fortune of taking Li Ziqi as their disciple!\u201dThe group of teachers chatted enthusiastically, with some of them clearly sounding envious.\u201cDon\u2019t keep us in suspense. Quickly tell us!\u201d Zhou Shanyi urged.\u201cIt\u2019s Sun Mo!\u201d Jiang Yongnian revealed.The moment he said this, it was as if a freezing wind from the north had run through the entire office, freezing it up in ice. All the teachers were speechless as they looked at Jiang Yongnian. Their gazes then turned to that of perplexity, followed by doubt.\u201cTsk, you\u2019re kidding, right?\u201dZhou Shanyi drank his tea while the others went back to their work.\u201cHey, I\u2019m not lying. It\u2019s true. I saw it with my own eyes.\u201dJiang Yongnian had witnessed the entire process in which Xu Shaoyuan had been rejected. As he was a 1-star great teacher, his ears were sharper, so he had not missed out anything from their conversation at all.\u201cAre you sure? That Sun Mo? Why is it him?\u201dLian Zheng furrowed his brows so tightly that creases were formed on his forehead.\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Jiang Yongnian shrugged. \u201cAnyway, Xu Shaoyuan has gotten a great humiliation this time around.\u201dSome of the teachers who didn\u2019t like Xu Shaoyuan also broke out into stifled laughter.\u201cTeacher Jiang, what happened? Can you tell us in greater detail?\u201dZhou Lin, who was passing by, entered when she heard the commotion in the office. After hearing Jiang Yongnian\u2019s elaboration of the entire story, she immediately ran to look for Gu Xiuxun to ascertain if it was trueAfter ascertaining the story, Zhou Lin anxiously dashed into the headmaster office.\u201cEldest Miss, you mustn\u2019t let Sun Mo act so recklessly anymore!\u201dZhou Lin was very anxious.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter this time around?\u201d An Xinhui asked, feeling perplexed.\u201cLi Ziqi has acknowledged him as her teacher\u201dZhou Lin\u2019s countenance was grim. It wasn\u2019t anything serious that Sun Mo had offended Xu Shaoyuan. However, the sky would collapse if Li Ziqi\u2019s aunt were to be infuriated and come charging over.\u201cHmmm?\u201dEven An Xinhui, who had trained her heart to remain calm regardless of the situation, appeared surprised. To think that her childhood sweetheart had done such a great thing? If news of this were to spread out, a great commotion would break out across the entire Jinling City!\u201cEldest Miss, the matter with Xuanyuan Po aside, we must stop Li Ziqi from acknowledging Sun Mo as her teacher.\u201dZhou Lin insisted.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo had neither status nor capabilities. Regardless if Li Ziqi was sincere on wanting Sun Mo as her teacher or if she had been duped by his sweet talk, Sun Mo would suffer if Li Ziqi\u2019s aunt were to find out about this. When that happened, even the Central Province Academy might be implicated as well.The Central Province Academy was clearly in the midst of a raging storm and couldn\u2019t afford to take on any additional turbulences.\u201cI understand. You can take your leave!\u201dAn Xinhui furrowed her brows tightly, her expression turning a lot more solemn.\u201cShould I call Sun Mo here and so that you can talk to him personally about this?\u201d Zhou Lin suggested.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why? It was because these students came naturally with a tremendous amount of political resources.An Xinhui wanted students like Li Ziqi, but she knew that the current state of the Central Province Academy wouldn\u2019t be able to win against the Myriad Daos Academy. Therefore, she didn\u2019t expect this surprise haul!Zhou Lin was worried about Li Ziqi\u2019s aunt, while An Xinhui was thinking that if things were handled properly, this could bring a lot of benefits for the school!After all, if it wasn\u2019t for Sun Mo, there was a high chance that Li Ziqi would be going to the Myriad Daos Academy!\u201cNo matter how things are, my fiance is really amazing!\u201dAn Xinhui decided that after the student recruitment meet ended, she would go and take a look at Sun Mo, to meet this childhood sweetheart who had used to enjoy following behind her.\u2026Right now, Sun Mo had two tails trailing behind himLi Ziqi kept on trying to find out about Lu Zhiruo\u2019s situation. Given her max intellect at 10 points, the papaya girl wasn\u2019t her match at all. It didn\u2019t take long for Lu Zhiruo to place great trust in her and say many things.\u201cVery good. From today onward, I\u2019ll be your eldest martial sister. If there\u2019s any trouble, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201dLi Ziqi took out a jade pendant and handed it to Lu Zhiruo. \u201cHere, this is eldest martial sister\u2019s gift for you.\u201dLu Zhiruo lowered her head and didn\u2019t take it.\u201cTake it!\u201d Li Ziqi urged.\u201cI\u2026am teacher\u2019s first disciple.\u201dIt was rare to see the cowardly Lu Zhiruo showing such persistence.Li Ziqi pinched her forehead, explaining solemnly, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? I\u2019ve done the teacher acknowledgment long ago. Teacher Sun, where is that scarf? Take it out and show her!\u201dSun Mo pretended as if he hadn\u2019t heard anything. He would let the kids deal with the matters between them, and he wouldn\u2019t help either of them.\u201cThe first disciple is the teacher\u2019s image. While the person doesn\u2019t have to be the strongest, they must at least not be embarrassing. You\u2019ll suffer a lot given your weak character!\u201dLi Ziqi rambled on, striking the papaya girl\u2019s weakness.\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201dLu Zhiruo kept on stuttering \u2018I\u2019 but eventually didn\u2019t finish her sentence. She was aware that her character was weak, and even when she met strangers, she would feel so scared that she wouldn\u2019t dare to breathe too loudly.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s decided.\u201dLi Ziqi smiled proudly. \u201cCome on, call me eldest martial sister!\u201dLu Zhiruo struggled for a very long time but was eventually unable to win against Li Ziqi\u2019s insistence. \u201cEldest\u2026 eldest martial sister!\u201d\u201cEn!\u201dLi Ziqi nodded solemnly and waved her little fist excitedly. \u201cFrom today onward, I\u2019m someone who has a junior martial sister.\u201d\u201cAnd also a junior martial brother!\u201d Lu Zhiruo reminded her.\u201cWhat?\u201d Li Ziqi was perplexed and looked at Lu Zhiruo. She realized that Lu Zhiruo spoke too slowly, so she decided to run up to Sun Mo and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThis is how it is. If you acknowledge me as your teacher, not only would you have an elder martial sister, but you\u2019ll also have an elder martial brother.Sun Mo teased. It ended up that Lu Zhiruo was still unable to win against Li Ziqi. This feeling was as if he was watching an endearing and naive little deer being fooled by a Little Red Riding Hood.\u201cThis is detestable!\u201dLi Ziqi pouted her little lips and raised her foot to kick Sun Mo\u2019s lower leg. It was only then did she realize that it was bad for her to be doing this, and she sneaked a glance toward him. Realizing he wasn\u2019t angry, she felt relieved and patted herself on the chest.\u201cYou\u2026 You are being disrespectful toward teacher Sun!\u201dLu Zhiruo was shocked.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m just bringing our teacher-student relationship closer !\u201d Li Ziqi\u2019s eyes rolled as she immediately came up with an excuse. \u201cThat\u2019s right, bringing our relationship closer!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dLu Zhiruo nodded.Seeing Lu Zhiruo\u2019s naive expression flashing with an innocent aura like a harmless little deer, Li Ziqi suddenly felt a little conscience-stricken. She was hesitating if she should explain things when she saw Lu Zhiruo running over and catching up to Sun Mo.\u201cHehe!\u201dLu Zhiruo raised her right leg and kicked out hard.Pa!Sun Mo stumbled a little from the sudden kick and almost knelt on the ground. He couldn\u2019t help but turn back and look at Lu Zhiruo, feeling puzzled.\u201cThis is to improve our relationship!\u201d Lu Zhiruo said seriously.She felt that the greater the strength she exerted, the deeper their relationship would be. After saying that, she turned and looked at Li Ziqi.(Hey, hey, don\u2019t look at me. It has nothing to do with me.) Although Li Ziqi was thinking this, she nodded seriously. \u201cThat\u2019s right, we both like Teacher Sun a lot.\u201dSun Mo had the feeling that his life wasn\u2019t going to be so easy in the future.\u201cWho is that junior martial brother?\u201d Li Ziqi asked.\u201cA battle maniac who likes to fight!\u201dSun Mo recalled Xuanyuan Po\u2019s data. It was true that it\u2019d be a waste of his body if he didn\u2019t battle.\u201cOh, that means that his head is filled with muscles!\u201dLi Ziqi was assured. Simple-minded people who only had brawns were the easiest to deal with. \u201cOh right, Teacher Sun, come over here!\u201dSeeing that there was a large shaded area behind the library not far away and that there weren\u2019t many people there, Li Ziqi immediately grabbed Sun Mo\u2019s arm and ran over.Lu Zhiruo wanted to follow after them.\u201cMartial Junior Lu can wait here!\u201d Li Ziqi instructed.The summer wind blew, causing the leaves to rustle, leaving behind the swaying trees.After ensuring that Lu Zhiruo was unable to see her, Li Ziqi dropped to her knees while wearing a solemn expression.\u201cTeacher Sun, please accept student Li Ziqi!\u201dLi Ziqi did three proper kowtows, banging her head to the ground without trying any tricks.Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help but look at her seriously, asking the question that was in his heart, \u201cWhy is it me?\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be you?\u201dLi Ziqi was puzzled and asked him back.Neither of them said anything. They just quietly looked at each other. It was as if time had come to a stop and there was only the sound of the summer cicadas ringing out in the forest.\u201cSystem, is she sincere about this?\u201d Sun Mo asked.\u201cMake a guess?\u201dThe system\u2019s reply was as simple as usual.Very long later, Sun Mo smiled. Li Ziqi smiled as well, showing off a pair of sweet dimples.That was right. Why did he need an answer? Since Li Ziqi had chosen him, then he should guide her seriously and not let his mind wander recklessly.\u201cGet up!\u201dSun Mo helped Li Ziqi up.\u201cTeacher Sun Mo!\u201dLi Ziqi smiled very sweetly, like the flower nectar that the bees had gathered early in the morning. She put her hand into her collar, took out a piece of teardrop-shaped jadestone, and removed it from her neck. She then handed it to Sun Mo, \u201cThis is my teacher acknowledgment gift. It represents my determination!\u201cThis should be very precious to you, right?\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t take it from her. After hearing what Li Ziqi said and considering that it was something she kept close to her, it was apparent that this jadestone must have a special meaning to her.Li Ziqi stroked the jadestone, pursing her lips as she recalled back on a memory. \u201cThat was in the past. Right now, it\u2019s a gift for the teacher acknowledgment. Take it!\u201dLi Ziqi put out her hand and stuffed the jadestone into Sun Mo\u2019s hand. She then turned, planning to run away. However, she was immediately stunned because Lu Zhiruo\u2019s small head had popped out from the side of a loquat tree not far away. She was hiding there and secretly watching like a little kitten.Seeing that Li Ziqi had noticed her, Lu Zhiruo instantly hid behind the loquat tree, raising the branch in her hands.\u201cOh my, she must have seen the entire process of me going through with the teacher acknowledgment.\u201dLi Ziqi\u2019s eyes darted around, feeling a little nervous. However, she quickly boosted her own morale and tried hard to calm down. \u201cNo matter what, the place of the first disciple must be mine!\u201dLi Ziqi adjusted her emotions and then wore an extremely friendly smile as she walked toward Lu Zhiruo. On the other hand, the papaya girl was holding onto tree branches and slowly backing away.Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help but smile. It seemed that their relationship would be very cordial.Ding!\u201cCongratulations on taking Li Ziqi in as your disciple, completing the system\u2019s first mission. Rewarded with one mysterious treasure chest!\u201dAs the system\u2019s reminder rang out, a big treasure chest that flashed in a purple glow appeared before Sun Mo.The divine skill, \u2018Immemorial Vairocana\u2019, was something that he had obtained from opening a mysterious chest. Therefore, Sun Mo felt a little agitated. It was the same feeling from when he was opening the first movie [1] he had downloaded in the past.\u201cOpen the chest!\u201dSun Mo regretted a little after saying that. He should have touched Lu Zhiruo before opening it. At the very least, he should go and stand next to her. After all, big boobs could increase one\u2019s luck.The treasure chest opened and immediately disappeared, leaving behind a book that was shrouded in a platinum glow, spinning slowly.\u201cCongratulations on obtaining an elementary-grade great teacher halo, \u2018Soul Imprint\u2019. Host exclusive\u201dThe system\u2019s calm voice was like plain water. It was giving the polite talk again, but Sun Mo didn\u2019t mind it. It was because he hadn\u2019t heard it clearly.\u201cWhat imprint?\u201d Sun Mo blinked. \u201cPregnancy?\u201d\u201cDid your brain get damaged from playing too many er*tic games?\u201d The system said in despise, \u201cIt\u2019s Soul Imprint!\u201d\u201cYou know er*tic games? You\u2019re really not a serious system!\u201dSun Mo was testing the system. When he checked through the information, he found out that great teacher halos could only be gained through enlightenment and not from anywhere else. But in addition to the \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019, the system had contributed two great teacher halos for him.Given Sun Mo\u2019s capability of scoring 148 marks for his language in the college-entrance examinations, Sun Mo understood and was certain that \u2018Host exclusive\u2019 meant that this was something only he knew.The system fell silent.\u201cSoul Imprint. After the host uses it, it would be possible for him to project information that includes but isn\u2019t restricted to martial arts moves, unique skills, as well as any knowledge, experience, memories, a certain condition, mood, and teachings into a target\u2019s mind, letting them receive instant comprehension.\u201d\u201cProficiency Index: Elementary-grade. The Soul Imprint\u2019s effect can be sustained for at most ten minutes. When the proficiency index increases, the sustained duration will increase.\u201dLooking at the skill\u2019s introduction, Sun Mo\u2019s expression gradually turned into that of shock. Given his comprehension ability, he could be certain that this great teacher halo was a divine skill to a teacher.What annoyed teachers the most?Explaining a certain knowledge for the entire day, yet the students still couldn\u2019t understand. With this halo, it meant that the teacher no longer had to verbalize things. They could project the knowledge directly into the students\u2019 minds, letting them gain immediate comprehension.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis is amazing, my wonderful system!\u201dAll sorts of feelings welled up within Sun Mo and he subconsciously reached out to touch the book. This wasn\u2019t all to how powerful the Soul Imprint was. The host could even channel things that were hard to grasp, such as his feelings and condition into the students\u2019 minds\u2026\u201cDid you only just realize?\u201dThe system suddenly spoke up with a hint of proudness in its tone.[1] Referring to p*rn movies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If the teacher was an idiot, there wouldn\u2019t be anything of value that could enter the student\u2019s mind.On the campus, the young and inexperienced youths brushed past each other. They were like pieces of unpolished jades that had yet to be refined.Sun Mo, who was in a joyous mood, activated Divine Sight and searched for those students who didn\u2019t even know that they were geniuses.\u201cTeacher Sun, what do you think about that guy? I feel that his aptitude isn\u2019t bad.\u201dLi Ziqi pointed to a male student who was almost 2 meters tall.\u201cIsn\u2019t that bad? Which part of him isn\u2019t? We are selecting students with the potential for future development; we are not looking for laborers!\u201dSun Mo was speechless. The data showed that the bone quality of that fellow was a little bad. His physique belonged to the injury-prone type. Leaving aside cultivation, he would even fail to qualify for hard physical labor in a construction site.\u201cHow about that girl beside the flowers? Her breasts are small, and I can tell that she\u2019s good at cultivation just by looking at her!\u201d Li Ziqi solemnly spoke.Sun Mo glanced at Li Ziqi. (Are you praising yourself after going in a circle? You are definitely doing so, right? Alright, I know you are \u2018small\u2019, but I won\u2019t discriminate against you.)Lu Zhiruo heard these words, and she was like a startled little deer. She hurriedly hugged her chest and snuck a few glances at Sun Mo, as though she was afraid of being abandoned.\u201cOne\u2019s aptitude isn\u2019t measured by the size of their \u2018that\u2019!\u201dSun Mo laughed.\u201cOh? Comparing my aptitude and Zhiruo, whose aptitude is better?\u201dLi Ziqi\u2019s eyes glowed as she stared at Sun Mo.\u201cHehe!\u201dSun Mo chose to remain silent.\u201cHmph!\u201dLi Ziqi put her hands on her hips and snorted complacently. (I don\u2019t need you to say it, but I, the steel-plate girl, my aptitude is definitely number one under the heavens!)\u201cBoohoo!\u201dLu Zhiruo squatted on the ground, covering her head as she sobbed. So it turned out that the reason why her aptitude wasn\u2019t good was because of her huge papayas. This situation was terrible then. She wouldn\u2019t have any opportunity to improve her aptitude in this lifetime.\u201cStop crying. Aptitude only plays a part, and it cannot represent achievement. Your achievements still depend on your own learning and hard work!\u201dSun Mo consoled Lu Zhiruo. He wasn\u2019t a teacher that only focused on genius students.\u201cReally?\u201dLu Zhiruo lifted her head. Her eyes were filled with tears as she looked at Sun Mo.\u201cYes!\u201dSun Mo rubbed the papaya girl on her head.\u201cI don\u2019t know whose aptitude is better, but that male student who just passed us is definitely not a good catch.\u201dLi Ziqi glanced around the surroundings, and her vision landed on a young man not far away. That young man was extremely skinny and was dressed in white. There was a cotton handkerchief in his hand, and he would occasionally cover his mouth as he coughed.Sun Mo initially wasn\u2019t bothered. He took a casual glance but soon started to frown.Tantai Yutang, 14 years old. 1st-level of the body refinement realm.Strength: 3. You are an invalid, you lack the strength to even truss a chicken!Intellect: 10. You have the qualifications to call many people monkeys.Agility: 3. If you are ill, you should just lie down.Endurance: 3. Trash.Will: 9. Compared to the standard of youths, your will is indestructible.\u2026Potential value: Extremely high!Note: Do not use the gaze you use to look at a child on him, or you will be extremely unlucky.Note: This is a time bomb. Suggestion: Be as far away from him as possible.The polarization of the data was extremely serious. This was the first youth whereby the system had two notes about.\u201cI think that might not be the case.\u201dLu Zhiruo doubted.\u201cChe, he looks so sickly. I can tell he isn\u2019t cultivation material. Let\u2019s go, we will go look for more geniuses!\u201dLi Ziqi urged.\u201cThat might not be the case.\u201d Sun Mo went over while asking in his heart. \u201cSystem, will there be a danger if I accept him as my disciple?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you read the note? Please just follow the system\u2019s suggestion,\u201d the system reminded him.\u201cHehe!\u201d Sun Mo laughed softly. He went over to Tantai Yutang. \u201cYo, young man. Are you preparing to join the school?\u201d\u201cAh? Teacher couldn\u2019t possibly want to recruit him, right?\u201dLi Ziqi was puzzled. She wanted to follow them but was stopped by Lu Zhiruo.The papaya girl was afraid that Li Ziqi\u2019s appearance might affect Sun Mo\u2019s performance.\u201cCough cough!\u201d Tantai Yutang didn\u2019t say anything but started smiling after he coughed. \u201cHello, teacher. I came to this place on account of its reputation, and I\u2019m filled with admiration toward the school\u2019s glorious history.\u201d\u201cAre you interested in becoming my student?\u201dSun Mo went straight to the point. This young man was a rarely seen genius with an intellect of 10. Thus, regardless of how obedient or honest he appeared to be, Sun Mo knew he couldn\u2019t trust him easily. And rather than having his probe discovered, Sun Mo might as well be more sincere and open.\u201cMn?\u201dTantai Yutang would frequently cough blood due to chronic ailment, and this also resulted in his sick-looking appearance. Hence, through these 14 years, he had never been recruited by anyone before. This was why he was stunned when he heard Sun Mo.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, there\u2019s always a first time in life!\u201dSun Mo teased.\u201cTeacher!\u201d Li Ziqi hurriedly ran over and tugged on Sun Mo\u2019s clothes. After that, she covered her mouth with her hand and whispered, \u201cWhich point of him do you fancy?\u201dThe matter of a teacher accepting a disciple was a very solemn one. One naturally mustn\u2019t fool around.\u201cIntellect!\u201dSun Mo tapped her forehead as he spoke, \u201cThis guy is a monster like you. Both of you have an intellect stat of 10.\u201d\u201cEh!\u201dLi Ziqi wanted to say that she had no way to believe this answer.Tantai Yutang was surveying Sun Mo. When he heard Sun Mo\u2019s answer, he began to frown. Could something like intellect be seen?\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t joke around anymore.\u201d Sun Mo\u2019s expression turned solemn. He looked directly at Tantai Yutang. \u201cI only feel that you are the right person!\u201d(Oi! Oi! Teacher, can you not be so corny? He is not a girl. If you keep acting like this, I\u2019m going to suspect your sexual orientation!)Li Ziqi covered her forehead. However, she felt that Sun Mo shouldn\u2019t be someone who would speak without thinking. Hence, she also seriously surveyed Tantai Yutang.(Che. His looks are very ordinary. He is skinny and has a sickly appearance, looking as though he might die any time. Teacher Sun is still the better-looking one.)When she thought of this, Li Ziqi turned her head.Under the sunlight, Sun Mo stood firmly. His left hand was placed on the hilt of his wooden blade; his bearing exuded comfort and relaxedness. This was especially so when he wasn\u2019t speaking. The angle of his pursed-up mouth was very nice to look at. It was like a smile.Very sweet!\u201cI apologize. If you are looking for students to make up for a shortfall in the number of people. You shouldn\u2019t be looking for a sickly person like me.\u201dTantai Yutang rejected his offer because he couldn\u2019t see through Sun Mo. This feeling wasn\u2019t good at all.\u201cNo hurry. My name is Sun Mo and I\u2019m an intern teacher. If you change your mind, you can look for me.\u201dAfter speaking, Sun Mo turned and left. He was testing the system. As to whether he could recruit Tantai Yutang or not, that wasn\u2019t so important to him.Truthfully speaking, Sun Mo was more fond of students like Xuanyuan Po whom he could tell the personalities in a single glance. It was easier to interact with those kinds of people.\u201cAre you playing with me?\u201dTantai Yutang\u2019s expression sank. However, his look of anger instantly vanished as his expression went back to the harmless look he had on earlier. It was as though his words were just a casual question.\u201cI\u2019m a teacher, I won\u2019t be playing around when it comes to recruiting students.\u201d Sun Mo halted. \u201cIf you want to acknowledge me as your master, I will accept you now.\u201d\u201cWhat can you teach me then?\u201dThese words revealed his sharpness.After Tantai Yutang finished speaking, he began to feel regret. He could say such words, but he shouldn\u2019t have done so in such a manner. Also, his tone should be slightly lower, or he would reveal his emotions.\u201cI can guide you on the aspects you are lacking\u2014martial arts.\u201dWith Divine Sight and Qi Shengjia as an example, Sun Mo was very confident when he said these words. He still hadn\u2019t included his recent gains such as the Soul Imprint and Immemorial Vairocana.Tantai Yutang fell silent. He stared at Sun Mo\u2019s eyes and discovered that Sun Mo didn\u2019t waver at all.This person was either extremely confident, or he was a conceited fool.\u201cAlright, go and consider well. I have something on!\u201dSun Mo waved his hand in farewell. Regardless of which, he had to recruit five students before the student recruitment meet ended. By doing so, he would be able to become a substitute teacher.Staring at the back of Sun Mo who had already walked far away, Tantai Yutang who hadn\u2019t moved yet suddenly smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to meet such an interesting person when I came to the Central Province Academy. Seems like I can cancel my plans and directly join this school.\u201d\u2026\u201cLook at his soon-to-die appearance. Even if he\u2019s a genius, he would be useless if he died early. Besides, we don\u2019t know what illness he has. Teacher, you shouldn\u2019t go near him.\u201dLi Ziqi felt Tantai Yutang wasn\u2019t honest enough!\u201cTeacher!\u201d Lu Zhiruo, who was afraid of strangers and hadn\u2019t spoken much, suddenly offered a rare opinion. \u201cI feel that he is very dangerous. It\u2019s better not to accept him as a disciple.\u201dWhen he felt the concern these two girls had for him, Sun Mo smiled. He was even more determined that he mustn\u2019t let them down. In the nine provinces of Middle-Earth, after acknowledging a master, there would be a connection between the teacher and the student. If one was bad, the other would be bad. If one achieved glory, the other would be able to bask in it too. If he was not famous enough, his students would also lose face.Looking at the two new stars, Liu Mubai and Gu Xiuxun, and also the 2-star teacher Xu Shaoyuan\u2019s extreme desire to recruit Li Ziqi. He knew that it wasn\u2019t enough for him to become a substitute teacher. He had to quickly become a great teacher.To become a 1-star great teacher, he had to comprehend three great teacher halos and have a secondary occupation.Currently, he had reached the required number of great teacher halos. But what about his secondary occupation? There was no mathematics, foreign languages, etc\u2026 in the Nine Province. He couldn\u2019t possibly teach the students his ancient massaging technique, right? If he did so, he would definitely become the butt-jokes of the entire Jinling City.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTeacher, quickly look over there!\u201dLi Ziqi suddenly tugged on Sun Mo\u2019s clothes and pointed to the flight of steps before the teaching building. There was a group of adults surrounding a youth. There was no need to ask. These people were definitely teachers. And being able to make so many teachers surround him or her, that person was definitely an outstanding talent.\u201cTeacher, let\u2019s hurry over to snatch him to our side!\u201dLi Ziqi pulled Sun Mo along as she ran toward that direction.The little bambi Zhiruo quickly followed after them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44: An Abandoned Student!Several people in the surroundings were watching. Other than teachers, some students were also there.\u201cSorry, please let us pass!\u201dLi Ziqi squeezed her way over. When she saw the young man sitting on the steps, she couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in shock.That young man exuded an unwelcoming aura. As he flipped through the book in his hands, he was munching on a piece of hard sesame bread. He completely ignored the mutterings around him, including those pointing their fingers at him.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with this fellow? Is he an escaped slave?\u201dWhispers echoed out in the surroundings.There was a scar on the youth\u2019s left forehead, and it was evidently shaped like the word \u2018trash\u2019. From the looks of things, it should have been caused by a sword or a dagger.Above the \u2018trash\u2019 word, there were a few other disarrayed scratches. It was as though the scratches were there to destroy the word \u2018trash\u2019, but it was unknown what the young man experienced.Other than this, although his collar was straightened and he wore a silk cloth around his neck, one could still see uncovered parts of a tattoo that stretched up to half of his left face.This type of tattoo was known as spirit runes.In the nine provinces, humans called pictures or diagrams that contained spirit qi as spirit runes. There were many types of spirit runes, and they could display miraculous effects.However, the tattoos on the young man couldn\u2019t display any effects. Even Sun Mo, someone who didn\u2019t understand spirit runes, could tell that these spirit runes were already destroyed. Sharp swords slashed through them, leaving behind cruel and unsightly-looking scars.\u201cTeacher, let\u2019s go. We have to go and snatch some genius students.\u201dLi Ziqi pulled Sun Mo as she prepared to leave. This young man was just someone pitiful. He would be even more pitiful if he was surrounded and watched, just like what was happening now.Lu Zhiruo was so scared that she tugged on Sun Mo\u2019s clothes. The scars on this young man\u2019s face, as well as his tattoos, caused her to feel extremely terrified due to how malevolent they looked. To her, the young man seemed like a fierce dog that was hunting everywhere for food.\u201cWait a minute!\u201dSun Mo stared at the young man. As a teacher, the thing he couldn\u2019t bear to see the most was an abused student.Jiang Leng, 12 years 7 months old. 9th-level of the body refinement realm.Upon seeing this cultivation realm, Sun Mo was a little shocked. The Saint Gate had done research that the 12-year-old mark was the best age to start cultivation. If one started earlier, they might injure their foundation. Even if the individual was a genius, they might destroy or affect their future accomplishments. However, this young man was already at the 9th-level.Strength: 8. You are not a power-type contestant.Intellect: 7. Although you don\u2019t depend on your brain for meals, those who underestimate you will definitely pay a great price.Agility: 8. Relatively normal, barely sufficient.Endurance: 10. Your endurance is extremely terrifying. You can call yourself an iron man.Will: 1. The fire of hope is dwindling. Maybe death is your only release.\u2026\u201cSystem, is it possible for someone\u2019s endurance to max out?\u201dSun Mo was surprised. From his point of view, if one was a human, they would feel fatigued at some point in time. But according to this stat, the young man before his eyes belonged to the type of people that would never give up.\u201cThe system will never be wrong.\u201dThe system emphasized.\u201cWill 1. Does it mean that this little fellow\u2019s mental state will collapse soon and he would commit suicide?\u201dSun Mo surveyed Jiang Leng, and he continued to look at him.Potential value: LowNote: It\u2019s a pity. Before he was 10-years-old, his potential value was extremely high.Note: Target has a very grave tendency to commit suicide.\u201cAs expected!\u201dUpon seeing the note, Sun Mo sighed. This young man definitely had a very tragic childhood. It was unknown who could be so ruthless to use a sword and carve the word \u2018trash\u2019 on his forehead.\u201cTeacher?\u201dLi Ziqi suddenly felt a sense of unease. Did he want to accept this person as a disciple? This \u2018trash\u2019 word young man was even more inferior to that sick-looking Tantai Yutang.Sun Mo walked over.The environment, which was originally filled with whispers and mumblings, instantly fell silent. All the audience here adopted the same action without prior consultation with each other as they all turned to look at Sun Mo.\u201cWere you rejected when you attempted to acknowledge a master?\u201dSun Mo got right to the point.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dJiang Leng coldly looked at Sun Mo. His grip that was holding onto the hard bread tightened slightly, causing some crumbs to fall on the stairs.\u201cI just want to say that there are many teachers. There\u2019s no need for you to give up just because of a few rejections.\u201dSun Mo lowered his voice.\u201cHehe!\u201dJia Leng coldly laughed. Although he knew it would be extremely difficult for him to find a master in his current state, the Central Province Academy was still a famous school with a thousand years of history. One couldn\u2019t deduce things based on common sense. He had felt that he had a chance to find a teacher here that would admire him. Sadly, he was wrong. Let alone great teachers, even those experienced teachers didn\u2019t want to give him a chance.\u201cTeacher!\u201dLi Ziqi came over. Lu Zhiruo glanced at the left and right and also jogged over before hiding behind Sun Mo.Sun Mo scratched his head. As expected, a youth that wanted to commit suicide was very hard to handle.\u201cAre you pitying me?\u201dJiang Leng forcefully bit a mouthful of the bread. He stared at Sun Mo, his eyes were like a wolf.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that you will die!\u201dSun Mo recalled the summer afternoon three years ago. Amidst the cries of cicadas, a female sophomore student had jumped down from a teaching building. The impact turned her into a pulp of flesh.\u201cMy life is mine. Are you qualified to care about it?\u201dJiang Leng turned his head away, no longer bothering about Sun Mo.\u201cOi, what\u2019s with your attitude?\u201dLi Ziqi was extremely unhappy. (Teacher clearly is worried about you for your own good.)\u201cWang!\u201dLu Zhiruo peeked out and shouted at Jiang Leng.Jiang Leng revealed a malevolent smile. He stared at Li Ziqi. \u201cDo you believe that I will bite you to death?\u201dLi Ziqi didn\u2019t feel too scared, but Lu Zhiruo was so frightened that she directly cowered behind Sun Mo.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dSun Mo shook his head, he couldn\u2019t allow his students to be injured. He had already stepped out to persuade Jiang Leng and that could already be considered extremely benevolent of him. Since Jiang Leng didn\u2019t want to listen, that was his business then.\u201cTeacher, this fellow must have been rejected by too many teachers, and his mental state became abnormal,\u201d Li Ziqi mumbled.\u201cMn! Mn!\u201dLu Zhiruo hurriedly nodded.\u201cDing! New mission. Before the student recruitment meet concludes, get Jiang Leng to acknowledge you as his teacher. Reward: 1 bronze treasure chest. There will be a punishment if you fail the mission!\u201dThe system notification rang out.\u201cF*** your mother! System, you are scheming against me!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s unhappiness rose to the peak. He only persuaded Jiang Leng due to his occupation as a teacher. He had no intention of recruiting him as a disciple.A student with a difficult personality like this would definitely annoy him to no end.\u201cAs a great teacher, you have to be able to handle all sorts of challenges. This is the tempering exercise the system is giving you. Please provide a satisfactory answer!\u201d the system explained.\u201cWhat is the punishment if I failed?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s heart was filled with curses.\u201cBelieve me, you definitely won\u2019t want to know.\u201d The system tactfully indicated the severity of the punishment. \u201cThat will become the worst nightmare of your life.\u201d\u201cCan the system detect the thoughts in my heart? Speaking of which, what\u2019s going on with this Absolute Great Teacher System? Why did it choose me?\u201dMany questions appeared in Sun Mo\u2019s mind.\u201cThis fellow truly doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him!\u201d\u201cWhy did the security allow someone like this to enter? He\u2019s too terrifying!\u201d\u201cHis injuries\u2026could they have happened because of the bad deeds he did when he was young? Did someone do that to teach him a lesson?\u201dThe students were mired in their discussion. Jiang Leng\u2019s vile attitude caused everyone to determine that he was a bad student.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dLian Zheng was the year\u2019s head. When he saw so many people here, he came over to check out the situation and ensure that no commotion would occur.\u201cTeacher Lian.\u201dThe teachers hurriedly greeted him.When Jiang Leng saw a golden thread at the collar of Liang Zheng\u2019s white robes, his eyes instantly brightened. This was the sign of a 1-star great teacher. Hence, he stood up and walked over.\u201cTeacher Lian, hello!\u201dJiang Leng revealed a smile. Maybe it was because of his scars, but his current expression was quite frightening.\u201cMn.\u201dLian Zheng swept a glance at Jiang Leng and no longer paid attention to him.Jiang Leng could sense Lian Zheng\u2019s coldness toward him, but he didn\u2019t want to miss out on this opportunity. Hence, he knelt and kowtowed. \u201cTeacher Lian, I wish to acknowledge you as my master!\u201dHua~A clamor rang out in the surroundings. The students were all dumbstruck when they looked at Jiang Leng.Wasn\u2019t the skin of this new student a little too thick? After seeing Lian Zheng\u2019s uniform and understanding that he was a 1-star great teacher, this guy casually knelt like this and wanted to acknowledge Lian Zheng as a master?This was simply such a shameful thing!The students all felt that Jiang Leng wouldn\u2019t succeed. But even so, they were worried. They had a feeling as though the rice at their homes was being eaten by someone else. After all, they didn\u2019t dare to publicly ask a great teacher to take them as a disciple. How did this ugly ghost qualify?\u201cYoung man, you don\u2019t meet my requirements.\u201dLian Zheng didn\u2019t even hesitate and rejected him directly.The word \u2018trash\u2019 on Jiang Leng\u2019s forehead was something that would affect his image; moreover, Lian Zheng disliked the spirit rune that was branded on half of Jiang Leng\u2019s face. Just the sight of it was nauseating.A minority among cultivators would choose to brand spirit runes on their bodies to increase their combat strength. But those were choices made after they were of age.Why? Because after a spirit rune was branded, it was an irreversible process. The risk was that once the spirit rune was damaged, the remnant spirit qi in it would disrupt the qi circulation of one\u2019s body, causing one\u2019s cultivation speed to become slower. For more serious cases, their cultivation bases would remain stagnant forever.Jiang Leng looked to be at most 13 or 14 years of age, but he already had a damaged spirit rune branded on him. Even if he was once a genius, he was a cripple now.For students like this that definitely had no future, why would Lian Zheng want them? Even if he wanted someone to wash his feet and toilet, it wouldn\u2019t be Jiang Leng\u2019s turn.Jiang Leng stared at Lian Zheng. In his eyes, the last flame of hope gradually dissipated. Although he already guessed that this would be the reply, being rejected like this still hurt him a lot.\u201cHaha, he deserved it!\u201d\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he look at his own appearance? He is truly overestimating himself!\u201d\u201cHow can a great teacher accept disciples so casually?\u201dThe students were in discussion. When they saw Jiang Leng being rejected, all of them had a feeling as though the rice at their homes was kept safe and wasn\u2019t stolen by this fellow.Sun Mo shook his head. Lian Zheng rejected a student too quickly and basically didn\u2019t consider their feelings. However, there were so many students wanting to take him as their masters. Most probably, Lian Zheng didn\u2019t care about a student like Jiang Leng whom he completely had no regard for.\u201cWhy did you shake your head? You have an opinion about me?\u201dLian Zheng turned his head and stared at Sun Mo. It was precisely this person\u2014someone that had no sense of his own limitations\u2014who snatched away Xuanyuan Po and Li Ziqi.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIs this a hot-tempered bro?\u201dSun Mo had initially thought that Lian Zheng didn\u2019t have a good temper. But after he saw the look in Lian Zheng\u2019s eyes that was filled with loathing and contempt while looking at him, as well as the expression of pity on his face when Lian Zheng looked at Li Ziqi, Sun Mo suddenly understood. This fellow simply disliked him.\u201cIf you have no opinions, scram!\u201dLian Zheng berated and prepared to leave.Sun Mo lifted his feet. However, he didn\u2019t make way. He directly walked over and stood before Lian Zheng. His eyes showed no fear as he stared at Lian Zheng directly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But at this moment, it was so quiet that you could hear a pin if it dropped. Everyone widened their eyes as they stared at Sun Mo, so shocked that they weren\u2019t able to say anything.(Has this fellow gone crazy?)(He actually dares to publicly provoke a 1-star great teacher?)Lu Zhiruo glanced at the surroundings in a panic. On the other hand, Li Ziqi\u2019s spirits stirred. As expected, she hadn\u2019t chosen the wrong teacher.This step that Sun Mo took to move forward was truly tyrannical!Ding!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +6.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi. Neutral: (56/100).Lian Zheng also didn\u2019t imagine Sun Mo would do something so out of bounds. He halted in astonishment. After that, his boorish face revealed a look of extreme rage.\u201cImpudent!\u201dLian Zheng roared.Sun Mo stared at Lian Zheng, and his body inclined forward slightly. Baring his teeth, he enunciated each word slowly, \u201cI have an opinion. Hence, I blocked your way!\u201dThe entire atmosphere was so quiet that it felt terrifying. This was especially so for those intern teachers. All of them had fallen into a daze. (Wasn\u2019t Sun Mo just berated by a great teacher? What\u2019s the great deal about it? He actually dared to retort? Does he want to be fired?)\u201cAlthough you don\u2019t find this student suitable, can\u2019t you be more tactful about it and show some care for his pride?\u201dSun Mo used his Divine Sight and observed Jiang Leng. He discovered that Jiang Leng\u2019s will had already fallen to 0. Another note appeared \u2013 Target is extremely disappointed and might commit suicide anytime!Lian Zheng didn\u2019t know how much damage his casual reply had caused a student who had been continuously rejected. His final life-saving straw was destroyed by Lian Zheng.\u201cNo matter what\u2019s my attitude, it\u2019s not up to an intern teacher like you to lecture me!\u201dLian Zheng berated.Sun Mo\u2019s fists instantly clenched. He stared at Lian Zheng and he vowed in his heart. He definitely had to specialize in a secondary occupation within half-a-year and pass the test issued by the Saint Gate, gaining a great teacher title.Damn, at that time, he would definitely say, \u2018You are just a great teacher that\u2019s almost 40 years in age, how shameful\u2019. At that time, he wanted to see if Lian Zheng still dared to use his status to pressure others or not.\u201cDing! New mission. Please become a 1-star great teacher within a year. Reward: Two golden treasure chests!\u201dThe system issued a mission that was apt to the occasion.\u201cSystem, which camp do you belong to? You actually cause trouble for me at such a moment?\u201dSun Mo was unhappy.\u201cWhy? You are reluctant to accept it?\u201d Lian Zheng stared at Jiang Leng. \u201cSince you look down on my attitude and pity him, why don\u2019t you accept him as your disciple?\u201d\u201cAiya, this old man is so sinister.\u201dLi Ziqi mumbled in her heart. She hurriedly came over and was preparing to stop Sun Mo.Lian Zheng wanted to push Sun Mo into the fire pit. The young man with the word \u2018trash\u2019 on his forehead definitely had no future. If Sun Mo accepted him as a disciple, there would certainly be a large taint on his reputation.\u201cTeacher, my stomach hurts. Can you quickly bring me to see a doctor?\u201dLi Ziqi clutched her stomach and showed a face of agony.Lian Zheng had long since noticed Li Ziqi. Now that he saw her pretending to be sick to help Sun Mo get out of this predicament, he grew even angrier.Why was such a good student following Sun Mo?\u201cTeacher, let\u2019s take a step back?\u201dLi Ziqi tugged on Sun Mo\u2019s clothes as she persuaded in a low voice.\u201cTake a step back? Ziqi, in my dictionary, there are no such words. Even if a mountain obstructs my path, I will shift the mountain aside. Even if an ocean blocks me, I will reclaim it in its entirety. I, Sun Mo, won\u2019t give way, won\u2019t retreat, won\u2019t concede!\u201dSun Mo waved his hands. He pushed Li Ziqi\u2019s hand away and stared straight at Lian Zheng.Li Ziqi was stunned. Sun Mo\u2019s words resounded out loud, and each word was filled with force. They were like iron hammers smashing on her brain.Yue Rongbo who was in the crowd involuntarily wanted to clap and praise when he heard this. After that, his gaze shifted to the left as he saw Jin Mujie who was standing under a parasol tree not far away.\u201cDamn, this fellow is so brazen!\u201dAn intern teacher couldn\u2019t help but shout. Although his words openly showed contempt, he felt somewhat impressed in his heart. This was retorting a great teacher. If he was in Sun Mo\u2019s shoes, let alone causing a great teacher to be angry, he would have long since swallowed his anger.\u201cWhat is that teacher\u2019s name?\u201dThe students began to ask in a low voice.Lian Zheng\u2019s hands were folded before his chest. He was calm and unruffled as he stared at Sun Mo. His tone was that of ridicule. \u201cVery well then, why don\u2019t you accept him as a disciple?!\u201dSun Mo looked at Jiang Leng. \u201cYou have heard everything, right? What\u2019s your decision?\u201dA bead of sweat appeared on Jiang Leng\u2019s forehead.\u201cAccording to your situation, this is your only chance in life to acknowledge a master. You better know how to grab hold of this opportunity!\u201d Lian Zheng chortled.\u201cAlthough Teacher Sun is an intern teacher, he is a very awesome one. He would definitely not waste your time.\u201dLi Ziqi was very intelligent. Although her words appeared to be openly praising Sun Mo, she actually meant something else. She was warning Jiang Leng not to be foolish. She didn\u2019t want such trash as her junior apprentice-brother.\u201cRight, teacher is really very awesome!\u201dLu Zhiruo ran over and stood behind Sun Mo. After saying this sentence loudly, she cowered back again, only revealing her eyes as she watched.\u201cAiya, you stupid fool!\u201dLi Ziqi really wanted to strangle Lu Zhiruo. This papaya girl\u2019s words were sincere, and she worshiped Sun Mo from the bottom of her heart.Jiang Leng was hesitating. Earlier, he tried to acknowledge many masters but no one was willing to take him in. Now that someone was willing to do so, he suddenly began to worry about his future and whether this person would be a good teacher or not.The scenes of his childhood began to appear from the depths of his mind. They caused Jiang Leng to turn pale. It was unbearable.\u201cIt\u2019s rare for such a \u2018good\u2019 teacher to accept you as a disciple. What are you waiting for?\u201dLian Zheng urged.\u201cSun\u2026Teacher Sun\u2026can you let me become a\u2026saint?\u201dWhen Jiang Leng said the word \u2018saint\u2019, he also felt bashful. Because even he himself felt that it was impossible. However, if he didn\u2019t ask, he would feel reluctant in his heart.\u201cHaha, is he dreaming?\u201dMocking laughter rang out from the crowd. This fellow truly didn\u2019t know the immensity of heavens and earth.Sun Mo really wanted to shoot back at Jiang Leng. Wasn\u2019t he aware of his own situation? He could become half of a saint (\u5723\u4eba), if things went on.However, when Sun Mo stared at the hope-filled eyes of the young man, as well as the word \u2018trash\u2019 on his forehead, Sun Mo swallowed his initial mocking response, and he decided to smile instead.\u201cI don\u2019t dare to guarantee whether you can become a saint or not. But I can guarantee that I will do my best to teach you. Your achievements in the future will still depend on your own effort.\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t kidding when he said this. This was the principle he scrupulously abided by ever since he became a teacher. He wouldn\u2019t treat any student differently regardless of their results.\u201cAre you dumb? Why are you asking such a question? Even Sun Mo doesn\u2019t dare to guarantee he himself can become a saint!\u201dLian Zheng felt even angrier, and his spittle almost flew onto Jiang Leng\u2019s face. The Central Province Academy mustn\u2019t allow such a fool to join them.\u201cIf a human doesn\u2019t have dreams, what will be the difference between them and salted fish?!\u201dSun Mo stared at Lian Zheng. If youth didn\u2019t have dreams and only acted realistically, was there still any meaning in this world? Would this world have any future?Swish~A golden light began to emit from the angered Sun Mo.\u201cIt\u2019s the Priceless Advice Halo!\u201dSomeone exclaimed in shock.Swish~ Swish~ Swish~The golden light was like fine rain scattering outward, enveloping a range of 100 meters and engulfing the audience in the crowd.They also began to shine with golden light, and their minds and spirits were instantly stirred. Those forgotten dreams of theirs began to rise again.For a time, the noisy environment fell back into silence. Everyone sank into an indescribable mood.(That\u2019s right, who doesn\u2019t have dreams?!)Being able to enter a famous school, being capable enough to chase the girl they secretly admired, finding a good job\u2026Even getting full marks and becoming the number one student for a time could also be considered a dazzling dream!\u201cBecoming a saint\u2026\u201dLian Zheng mumbled. When he regained his senses, only then did he realize that tears were flowing down his face.He was once a young man and had hot blood too, brimming with ambition. But when he was close to 40, he was still a 1-star great teacher. Let alone becoming a saint, he would already feel very content if he could become a 4-star great teacher before his death.Li Ziqi was so excited that she was panting when she saw people in the surroundings immersed in the atmosphere of recollection due to Sun Mo\u2019s Priceless Advice Halo. Even that great teacher whom she loathed was no exception as well.\u201cYay, teacher is so awesome!\u201dDing!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +15.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi.

Her finger, which was holding on to his clothes, exerted even more force.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +30.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo. Neutral (68/100).After hearing the system notifications, Sun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. As expected, honest people would contribute more favorable impression points.\u201cHmph, you are on your own!\u201dLian Zheng, who had just awakened, snorted while flicking his sleeves as he left. He no longer had any mood to look for trouble.\u201cTeacher Sun, please accept me, Jiang Leng, as your student!\u201dJiang Leng knelt and kowtowed.Ding!Favorable impression points from Jiang Leng +30.Prestige connection with Jiang Leng unlocked. Current state: Neutral (30/100).The effect of Sun Mo\u2019s Priceless Advice Halo was the greatest for Jiang Leng, allowing him to pull himself together again.\u201cQuickly get up!\u201dSun Mo glanced at him again and discovered that his will stat had +2. The note about his inclination of committing suicide had vanished.\u201cSigh!\u201dLi Ziqi sighed in her heart, but since it had been done, she could only acknowledge it. She put on a smiling face. \u201cJunior brother Jiang, I\u2019m the eldest martial sister. This is Lu Zhiruo, your second senior martial sister.\u201dShe wanted to settle the level of their statuses first. After everyone agreed, even if Lu Zhiruo or Xuanyuan Po were to regret it in the future, it would already be impossible to change anything.\u201cMaybe the teacher I acknowledge isn\u2019t that bad.\u201dJiang Leng greeted Li Ziqi and Lu Zhiruo while seriously surveying Sun Mo for the first time. Sun Mo was very young.Without a good show to watch, the people in the surroundings dispersed as well.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cHow can I think? Sun Mo is too impulsive, letting emotions affect his decision. He dug a huge hole for himself, and I dare to confirm that Jiang Leng will definitely become a huge taint on his path of becoming a teacher!\u201d\u201cThat Jiang Leng\u2019s aptitude is definitely extremely bad. He was abandoned by everyone, so how bad do you think it is? This must be the reason why someone carved the word \u2018trash\u2019 on his forehead, right?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe surrounding teachers departed as they discussed. In any case, they didn\u2019t think highly of Sun Mo. He had basically trashed his own career. Such a way of acting was truly too foolish.Jin Mujie had long since left, but she was thinking about the young man who had helped her massage her neck a few days ago at the Sorrowless Lake.\u201cSo, you are Sun Mo!\u201dJun Mujie felt a little surprised. He didn\u2019t seem to be as inferior as what the rumors had stated. Also, that sentence \u2018I, Sun Mo, won\u2019t give way, won\u2019t retreat, won\u2019t concede!\u2019 was truly well-spoken. Even she wanted to clap and cheer for him!Jin Mujie abruptly halted. She turned her head back and stared in the distance. Speaking of which, his massage technique was very good. Ever since her neck was massaged by him, she felt extremely comfortable during these few days. Should she take the initiative to ask him for a massage?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Neutral (2/100).The sudden notification stunned Sun Mo. He subconsciously thought about the well-rounded figure of that beautiful great teacher. This was especially so for her ample juicy peach (as*), it would be imprinted in anyone\u2019s memories once they glanced at it.\u201cSystem, if the accumulation of favorable points is enough, does it mean that I can do some indescribable things to a target?\u201dSun Mo glanced at the surroundings, but he didn\u2019t see Jin Mujie\u2019s figure.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m the Love Yellow Lotion System?\u201d The system was speechless. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s too time-consuming to gain high amounts of favorable impression points. You might as well toss some money at her. Oh, I\u2019ve forgotten, you are dirt-poor!\u201d\u201cDo you believe I\u2019m going to crush you now?\u201dSun Mo was speechless. However, the system was right. He was truly extremely poor. It seemed like he had to hurry up and finish the Journey to the West so he could get some money from Zheng Qingfang.If a man couldn\u2019t even afford an extra egg during breakfast, that would truly be too pathetic.Clap! Clap!Yue Rongbo clapped his hands and walked over. \u201cWhat a wonderful response. You put the \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 to good use!\u201dSun Mo turned over and saw a smiling square face.\u201cAre you not afraid that a great teacher would take revenge on you? Even if he is just 1-star, his status is much higher than yours.\u201dYue Rongbo was curious.\u201cIf I\u2019m afraid, I wouldn\u2019t have stood out.\u201dSun Mo rolled his eyes. If he was unhappy, he would simply resign. In any case, the world was so big, where couldn\u2019t he go?He didn\u2019t leave now because he just arrived here and was still unfamiliar with this world. Besides, this body of his had memories and feelings toward An Xinhui. They also played a part in influencing him.\u201cHehe!\u201d Yue Rongbo\u2019s gaze glanced over Li Ziqi and landed on Jiang Leng. \u201cFor the sake of a dispute, is it worth it?\u201dJiang Leng\u2019s body was covered with a large patch of damaged spirit runes, which would severely disturb his absorption of spirit qi. Hence, his cultivation speed would definitely be slow.This indicated that even if he was an unpolished jade, he was already a damaged one.\u201cI didn\u2019t accept him because of that great teacher\u2019s provocation.\u201dAfter Sun Mo finished speaking, he added another sentence in his heart. \u201cI did this because the damnable system forced me to! What shitty mission is this? It actually said it wanted to temper me? The system is most probably a sadist, right?\u201dHowever, since Jiang Leng had acknowledged him as a master, he would wholeheartedly guide him.When Jiang Leng heard Yue Rongbo\u2019s words, his expression turned dim. But after listening to Sun Mo\u2019s reply, his spirit stirred as gratitude rose from his chest.Ding!Favorable impression from Jiang Leng +5.Prestige connection with Jiang Leng. Neutral (35/100).Sun Mo felt a little surprised. Jiang Leng looked aloof and exuded an inhospitable aura. Yet, he still knew how to be grateful.Yue Rongbo no longer spoke. He just patted Sun Mo on his shoulder while thinking this was the mental attitude a qualified teacher should have.(Oi, oi. Don\u2019t just show an expression of admiration toward me, alright? It\u2019s more practical to give me some favorable impression points!)Sun Mo quietly mused. He put on a professional-looking smile while he noted down Lian Zheng\u2019s name in his mental notebook.This matter hadn\u2019t concluded yet.\u201cIt\u2019s not early anymore. How about eating together?\u201dYue Rongbo invited.\u201cSure!\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t polite as well. Speaking of which, this was a 4-star great teacher\u2019s lunch party. Yue Rongbo, this square-faced guy had three more stars than Lian Zheng.Ding!Congratulations to the host for accepting Jiang Leng and completing the mission. Reward: 1 bronze treasure chest.\u2019As the system notification rang out, a shining bronze treasure chest appeared before Sun Mo.Sun Mo patted Lu Zhiruo on her shoulder before saying the word \u2018open\u2019.\u201cTeacher?\u201dLu Zhiruo turned her head, waiting for instructions.\u201cNothing!\u201dSun Mo smiled. As expected, a papaya girl could truly increase his luck.The treasure chest vanished as a bottle of ancient whale oil floated in the air. Although it wasn\u2019t a skill book, this item was still worth 1,000 points.\u2026After the meal, Jiang Leng left. He had already acknowledged a master, and it was confirmed he would be enrolled in the Central Province Academy. Hence, there was no need for him to continue following Sun Mo. In addition, he knew his own situation very well. If he wanted to improve, he had to grab hold of every second.Li Ziqi wanted to tour around the teaching building. Sun Mo naturally didn\u2019t mind it.The teaching building was a building constructed from a mixture of wood and stone. There were three types of classrooms in the building: for twenty people, fifty people, or a hundred people.The higher the fame of a teacher, the higher the number of students who would want to attend his public lecture. Naturally, the classroom size had to be bigger as well.Other than this, each level also had a lecture hall with a capacity of 300 people. But even so, when a great teacher was giving a lesson, the place would be packed to the brim. There were no solutions to it, as there were too many students who wanted to listen in.In a school, the fewer the number of students during a lesson, through direct observation, it meant that the fame and ability of the teacher were very low.Li Ziqi walked in the corridor. She patrolled the classroom and curiously glanced at the surroundings. In the past, she had never gone to a school before, as her family always arranged a private tutor for her.The lecture hall also had many new students touring it. Li Ziqi took a glance and just when she wanted to leave, she turned her head back again. After that, she called out in a low voice.\u201cTeacher, come quickly. I discovered a good seeding!\u201dAt a seat below the windows on the left, there was a pair of twins. They were currently chatting with a few intern teachers.\u201cThis pair of brothers are surnamed Zou. The elder brother is named Zou Ping and the younger brother is named Zou An. They are in the information booklet as well. They came from Wuyi County, and their family has been in the herbs business for generations. Hence, they have always been taking medicinal baths since they were young, resulting in their bodies being extremely robust and healthy. They can be considered quite wealthy,\u201d Li Ziqi introduced.Lu Zhiruo hurriedly checked the information booklet.\u201cAt the eight-column of the sixth page, bottom left corner!\u201dLi Ziqi subconsciously displayed her outstanding intellect that was at 10 points. She had simply glanced through the information booklet earlier out of boredom and didn\u2019t really have any intentions to memorize it.Sun Mo\u2019s gaze landed on Qin Fen, as well as Qi Shengjia who was standing beside him.Li Ziqi was worried the Zou brothers would be recruited away. Hence, she immediately ran over to get into a conversation with them.This group immediately stopped their conversation. When Qin Fen saw Li Ziqi, his gaze turned and landed on Sun Mo. A great enemy had arrived, and this involved the matter of his failed recruitment of Xuanyuan Po. Everyone had already heard of this.\u201cSun Mo, you came too late. They have already agreed to be my students.\u201dQin Fen\u2019s tone was filled with a hint of arrogance. This time around, it could be considered that he had recovered some lost ground.\u201d\u201cPlease talk only after you have awakened from your dream.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. He could see many intern teachers who hadn\u2019t given up yet and were also in the vicinity. This indicated that the Zou brothers had not acknowledged a teacher yet. At most, they only promised Qin Fen verbally.\u201cSun Mo, when doing things, please note the order of arrival.\u201dYuan Feng ruthlessly glared at Sun Mo. He knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the Zou brothers as his disciples; hence, he helped Qin Fen to speak out. In any case, he wouldn\u2019t let Sun Mo get what he wanted.\u201cThe matter of accepting disciples definitely touches upon the capabilities of the teacher. How could a good teacher allow a stupid fool to accept a good disciple just because the stupid fool was here first?\u201d Sun Mo ridiculed.\u201cHehe, teacher is so toxic!\u201dLi Ziqi was silently joyful.\u201cWho did you say was a stupid fool?\u201dQin Fen was greatly angered. This was especially so when he saw Li Ziqi following Sun Mo. He had heard Yuan Feng saying that the number one female student in the information booklet had chosen Sun Mo. In addition to the matter from before where he failed to snatch Xuanyuan Po, the old grudge added on with the new, resulting in Qin Fen wanting nothing more than to slay Sun Mo right now.\u201cWhoever replied to me.\u201dSun Mo shrugged.Yue Rongbo leaned against the door. His hands were folded before his chest as he watched the good show.\u201cDidn\u2019t you just accept two disciples? Why are you acting so complacent?\u201dEveryone lived in the same dorm, and Yuan Feng had always looked down on Sun Mo. Now that he suddenly saw Sun Mo accepting two disciples, he was so jealous that he could die. He felt that the heavens were very unfair.\u201cThere are many teachers in the school that have disciples. They have over ten and twenty, and these are still considered relatively little. So, what do you count as?\u201d Yuan Feng mocked. He stared at the Zou brothers. \u201cLet me tell you a secret. Some disciples are willing to acknowledge this fellow as their master, but it isn\u2019t due to his capabilities. It\u2019s because his fiance is Headmaster An Xinhui.\u201dThe students in the lecture hall also turned their gazes over.\u201cOi, your words are too over-the-top!\u201dLi Ziqi frowned.\u201cAm I wrong? He is just a \u2018soft-rice\u2019 guy. If it wasn\u2019t for him hugging the thigh of Headmaster An, he won\u2019t even become a teacher,\u201d Yuan Feng spoke. He continued trying to persuade Li Ziqi and Lu Zhiruo, \u201cYou guys were tricked by him. Luckily, our school leaders are brilliant and knew that if they allowed him to be a teacher, he would waste the time of the students. Hence, they tossed him into the logistics department.\u201dQin Feng was calm and unruffled as he watched Sun Mo being humiliated.The Zou brothers also stared at Sun Mo in puzzlement. Evidently, the distrust in their gazes was now much more pronounced.\u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense.\u201dLi Ziqi grew angry.\u201cTeacher Sun has a very good character.\u201dLu Zhiruo explained.\u201cI have proof!\u201dYuan Feng called out.\u201cSpeak!\u201dQin Fen added oil to fire. He wanted nothing more than to trample Sun Mo to death.Yuan Feng pulled Qi Shengjia who was standing behind Qin Feng over. \u201cThis student is named Qi Shengjia, and he has gone to our dorm to look for Sun Mo in the past, sincerely seeking his guidance. If Sun Mo is truly capable, why didn\u2019t disciple Shengjia acknowledge Sun Mo as his master but chose to follow teacher Qin Fen instead?\u201dQin Fen lifted his chin in a reserved yet proud manner.\u201cAlso, you guys most probably didn\u2019t know that in the past, this student Qi Shengjia was only at the 3rd-level of the body refinement realm. In the end, under the guidance of teacher Qin Feng, he broke through two levels in five days. And in the test of the battle hall, he jumped levels and defeated Peng Wanli, someone at the 6th-level of the body refinement realm, who ranked at #108. Currently, Qi Shengjia is already an official member of the battle hall.\u201dYuan Feng introduced Qi Shengjia\u2019s backgroundIn the lecture hall, exclamations of shock rang out. \u2018Broke through two levels in five days\u2019, \u2018ranked at #108\u2019, \u2018official member of the battle hall\u2019, all these terms were sufficient to make people gasp in admiration.The gazes of everyone turned to Qi Shengjia. When they thought of the famous reputation the battle hall had in Jinling City and that this student was one of the 500 members, all the new students were filled with extreme envy. The gazes that turned to Qin Feng now were filled with urgency and enthusiasm.The Zou brothers exchanged mutual glances, and their gazes became determined now.\u201cWhy? Do you have nothing to say?\u201d Yuan Feng stared at Sun Mo and decided to make things worse. \u201cIf you are capable, why did he acknowledge Qin Fen as his master?\u201d\u201cHehe, you are an irksome presence in my eyes. Do you feel like digging a hole and hiding yourself in it right now?\u201d said Qin Fen. He was so happy that he could die.\u201cNo\u2026No\u2026\u201dQi Shengjia was an honest and foolish kid who was not good with words. Now that so many people were looking at him, he stuttered even more.\u201cQuickly tell them how outstanding Teacher Qin Fen is.\u201d Yuan Feng encouraged Qi Shengjia. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid that he would take revenge on you. He is just someone that sponges off women.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I will back you up no matter what,\u201d Qin Fen spoke.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo didn\u2019t rebut. Instead, he turned to Qi Shengjia and asked in a low voice, \u201cIs your body still well during these few days?\u201dUpon hearing that Sun Mo didn\u2019t rebuke him but was concerned about his condition, Qi Shengjia\u2019s eyes immediately turned red. He ferociously pushed away Yuan Feng\u2019s hands and knelt before Sun Mo, kowtowing three times.\u201cThe\u2026the situation is not like this!\u201dQi Shengjia roared.Because of this unexpected occurrence, everyone in the lecture hall fell into silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wanted to find a hole and dive into it to hide.\u201cThen\u2026then why did you acknowledge Qin Fen as your master?\u201dYuan Feng questioned.\u201cMy\u2026my aptitude is too bad, and I don\u2019t have the face to beg Teacher Sun Mo to take me as his disciple. If I did, I would definitely become a taint on his teaching career. Coincidentally, teaching assistant Qin Fen came to look for me saying that he wanted to accept me as his disciple, and I decided to agree.\u201dQi Shengjia explained.After he finished speaking, the entire place was in an uproar.Although Qi Shengjia didn\u2019t say too much, everyone understood the meaning of his words. Because this fellow felt inferior, he didn\u2019t dare to ask Sun Mo to be his master. Hence, he chose Qin Fen who went knocking on his door.Comparing this, it was very clear who was stronger between Sun Mo and Qin Fen.For people like Yue Rongbo, they thought deeper. Qi Shengjia referred to Qin Fen as a teaching assistant while he called Sun Mo as a teacher. From this, one could see the difference in statuses the two of them held in his heart. Did Qi Shengjia not know how face-smacking this was for Qin Fen by saying all this in public?Then again, Qi Shengjia looked like an honest person who would forgive his wife even if she turned out to be unfaithful on their wedding day. Evidently, he didn\u2019t think about how serious the consequences of his words were.Or maybe, he did think about it. However, he respected Sun Mo too much; hence, he was helping Sun Mo to explain.\u201cHave you heard it?\u201dLi Ziqi questioned Yuan Feng.Yuan Feng\u2019s thoughts were in turmoil, and he didn\u2019t know how to explain it. On the contrary, Sun Mo had a cold expression on his face as he spoke up.\u201cQi Shengjia, when have I ever taught you before? Don\u2019t try to form a relationship with me randomly!\u201dWhen Sun Mo heard Qi Shengjia\u2019s words, he felt extremely gratified. However, he was also worried about Qi Shengjia. (Do you have to be so honest? After saying these words, even if you are not driven away by Qin Fen, you would be ignored for a few years. In any case, you will die for sure.)If a personal disciple was expelled by a teacher, that would be a huge taint in their life. Basically, it would be extremely difficult for them if they wanted to find another teacher.After hearing Sun Mo\u2019s words, Yue Rongbo nodded, feeling even more admiration for Sun Mo.Ding!Favorable impression points from Yue Rongbo +1.Sun Mo glanced at Yue Rongbo. Were teachers at the 3-stars and above all so stingy? Would they die if they gave him more favorable points?In truth, Sun Mo understood that the higher the star-grade of a great teacher was, the more situations they had seen before. Besides, they had seen too many geniuses. It was too difficult for them to admire a junior and feel a very favorable opinion of him.\u201cAh?\u201dQi Shengjia was startled. Clearly, he didn\u2019t understand Sun Mo\u2019s good intentions and thought that Sun Mo was really angered. Hence, he kowtowed three more times with even more force.\u201cQi Shengjia, since you worship him so much. Our verbal agreement in the past no longer counts.\u201dQin Fen emphasized the words \u2018verbal agreement\u2019, and this could be considered as him finding a way out of the situation.He didn\u2019t have Divine Sight and naturally wouldn\u2019t know about Qi Shengjia\u2019s potential. When he saw this fellow breaking through two levels in such a short time and even jumped levels to defeat Peng Wanli, he thought that this fellow was enlightened and would rise meteorically. Hence, he took the initiative to recruit Qi Shengjia.\u201cTeaching assistant Qin?\u201d Qi Shengjia cried out in shock. After that, he secretly cast a glance at Sun Mo. In truth, he really wanted to be Sun Mo\u2019s student.\u201cNo, it\u2019s impossible. You are a \u2018soft-rice\u2019 guy. If it wasn\u2019t for you hugging Headmaster An\u2019s thigh, how could you possibly recruit any students? Do you think you are the top great teacher in Jinling City?\u201dYuan Feng shook his head, his face was filled with disbelief. He pointed at Qi Shengjia and roared, \u201cThis student must be afraid to offend you because you are An Xinhui\u2019s fiance!\u201dOne couldn\u2019t blame Yuan Feng for having such thoughts. He and Sun Mo were both graduates of the same batch from Songyang Academy, and they were even living in the same dorm. It could be considered that he understood Sun Mo very well. Qin Fen\u2019s talent definitely trumped Sun Mo\u2019s.Just ten days ago, Sun Mo had still been a loser. Why did he suddenly become so sharp?(If you are so awesome, why didn\u2019t you show any of your brilliance when we were studying? Hence, you must have definitely relied on An Xinhui\u2019s fame to cheat others.)\u201cAre you done?\u201dSun Mo mocked.\u201cNo.\u201dYuan Feng felt even angrier when he saw the casual and relaxed expression on Sun Mo\u2019s face. (What qualifications do you have to act so composed? Your face should be red in anger and you should quarrel with me. Quickly hit me due to being angry from embarrassment and show others your true face!)\u201cPui, you are a scheming dog. Why didn\u2019t I discover this in the past?\u201dYuan Feng spat a mouthful of saliva.\u201cYou are truly annoying. In any case, let me just tell you this. I don\u2019t simply have two students. I have four of them!\u201dSun Mo lifted four fingers.\u201cAh?\u201dYuan Feng was dumbstruck. There were still two more? (Who is so foolish to fall for your lies?)\u201cMake way! Make way! Is there a fight?\u201dBecause Yuan Feng was shouting, there were quite a lot of people surrounding the lecture hall outside, watching the show. Xuanyuan Po just arrived, and he directly squeezed his way through the crowd.\u201cOh, he\u2019s my student!\u201dSun Mo smiled lightly.\u201cXuanyuan Po? Why would a genius like him follow you?\u201dWhen Xuanyuan Po saw Sun Mo, he immediately retracted his ostentatious attitude. He jogged over. After that, he stood straight and bowed. \u201cTeacher!\u201dAfter speaking, Xuanyuan Po touched his spear and stared at Yuan Feng. \u201cTeacher Sun Mo, is this fellow trying to find trouble with you?\u201dYuan Feng was dumbfounded when he saw Xuanyuan Po protecting Sun Mo as though former was a battle hound. What was going on with these students? Did shit enter their brains?\u201cNo way, I\u2019m going to tell Headmaster An that you are using her name to cheat students!\u201d Yuan Feng roared, \u201cI cannot let the headmaster\u2019s name and the school\u2019s reputation be destroyed by you!\u201d\u201cHow noisy!\u201dSun Mo hadn\u2019t wanted to act. But when he heard that Yuan Feng wanted to complain to An Xinhui, how could he let this happen? Hence, he lifted his finger and pointed straight at Yuan Feng.Pak!A golden facula shot out from his finger like sparks from flint. The golden light didn\u2019t disappear but condensed into the shape of a sharp golden arrow that shot toward Yuan Feng.The distance was too close. Yuan Feng basically didn\u2019t have time to react.Swish~The golden arrow shot into Yuan Feng\u2019s head, and the impact caused his head to be knocked back slightly. When his head returned to the normal position, his eyes had already lost focus; there was no spirit in them.Ah!Yuan Feng subconsciously let out a low roar. He stared vacantly ahead. His mouth was wide open and drool flowed down, wetting his clothes.\u201cIgnorant and Incompetent?\u201dQin Feng screamed shrilly as his expression drastically changed. He subconsciously took a step back, lengthening the distance between him and Sun Mo. The expressions on the faces of the other intern teachers were unsightly as well.\u201cIs that the great teacher halo, \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it before, but I heard that those under the effect of this halo would fall into a daze and become something like an imbecile!\u201d\u201cHow terrifying!\u201dThe students discussed as they looked at the dazed look on Yuan Feng\u2019s face. He was drooling and wandering about aimlessly. He even knocked into a few desks, but he had no reactions. All of the audience felt fear and trepidation. When they turned their gaze to Sun Mo again, a hint of reverence could be seen in their eyes.This was the power of a great teacher halo!Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +15.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia. Friendly (373/1,000)When Sun Mo heard the system notification, he felt a little conflicted. Should he accept Qi Shengjia as a personal disciple or not?\u201c20 years old, possessing two great teacher halos. Not bad at all.\u201dYue Rongbo nodded. If he had three, it would be even better. However, that was an extravagant hope on his end. After all, Sun Mo just recently graduated and hadn\u2019t taught any students before.How could teachers comprehend a great teacher halo? There was actually a trick, and that was to teach students. Once the number of lessons exceeded a certain number, the teachers would gather enough experience and understanding. When the conditions were right, success would follow naturally, and they would comprehend a great teacher halo.\u201cTeacher, you are so awesome!\u201dLi Ziqi clapped and cheered. Quarreling with such a person was too damaging to one\u2019s status, so Sun Mo had directly used a great teacher halo and solved the problem.Ding!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +10.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi. Neutral (81/100).Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +15.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo. Neutral (83/100).Although Lu Zhiruo didn\u2019t say anything, the favorable impression points generated from her had expressed her feelings.The eyes of the Zou brothers brightened as they surveyed Sun Mo. It seemed like Yuan Feng\u2019s words were unreliable. This teacher Sun Mo wasn\u2019t a \u2018soft-rice\u2019 guy. In any case, even if he cheated, being able to accept four students also meant that he had some capabilities.\u201cTeacher, do you want to accept them as disciples?\u201dXuanyuan Po pulled his spear out as an aura of sharpness radiated forth. \u201cCome, fight me first and let me see if you guys are qualified to be Teacher\u2019s students or not!\u201dXuanyuan Po loved battle, and his aura immediately became sharp the moment he took out his spear. He was like a ferocious beast choosing targets to devour.The expressions of the Zou brothers turned heavy. As geniuses, they could feel that Xuanyuan Po was a very strong enemy.Pak!Li Ziqi rolled the information booklet and used it to hit Xuanyuan Po\u2019s head. \u201cDon\u2019t start trouble!\u201d(The aptitudes of the twins aren\u2019t bad. What if they got chased away after being beaten by you?)\u201cWhy are you hitting me?\u201dXuanyuan Po stared at Li Ziqi. His attitude didn\u2019t soften just because she was a girl.\u201cTeacher, he is just a battle addict that likes to fight. His EQ is too bad!\u201dLi Ziqi was speechless. (I\u2019m standing beside Sun Mo. Normal people should be able to guess my identity, right?)\u201cTeacher Sun Mo!\u201dThe Zou brothers greeted him. During the first day of the student recruitment meet, they had seen Liu Mubai try to recruit Xuanyuan Po on the Martial Arts Platform.Liu Mubai was very famous. He was one of the targets the Zou Brothers wanted as a master. Now when they saw that Xuanyuan Po had chosen Sun Mo, they naturally didn\u2019t dare to slight Sun Mo.Upon seeing this scene, Qin Fen was anxious and angry. He glared at Sun Mo and roared.\u201cSun Mo, do you dare to compete with me?\u201dDuring these two days, Qin Fen\u2019s path of accepting disciples was not smooth at all, and he had been rejected many times. He had failed to recruit all the students he had his eyes on, and he was enraged by it. Hence, he could only lower his target and recruit Qi Shengjia.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEarlier, he had put in so much effort and finally convinced the Zou brothers. But now, the meat before his eyes was about to fly away, so it would be a wonder if he wasn\u2019t angry.Sun Mo didn\u2019t reply. He glanced at the brothers as their data rose from their bodies.\u201cSun Mo, are you not the number one great teacher in Jinling? Come on, fight with me!\u201dQin Fen wanted to spur Sun Mo into action by making negative remarks. He wanted to defeat Sun Mo fair and square to let Xuanyuan Po and Li Ziqi know that they had missed out on the chance to follow an outstanding teacher like him.Sun Mo wasn\u2019t even worthy to lift his shoes for him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48: SchemingThe lecture hall that was enough for 300 people to sit in was packed to the brim now. Many new students came over to watch the show, and there were even some teachers among them.The whispers of everyone were like ants crawling across a leaf, emitting a slight rustling sound.Zou Ping, 12 years old. 1st-level of body refinement realm.Strength: 6. Very normal, nothing eye-catching.Intellect: 5. The standard.Agility: 6. Still very ordinary.Will: 4. The temperament of a youth, not too stable.Potential value: Above averageNote: No flaws, no strong points. For such students, I find it hard to muster the interest to give an evaluation.After Sun Mo read the data, he turned to look at Zou An.Zou An, 12 years old. 1st-level of the body refinement realm.Strength: 6Intellect: 5Agility: 6Will: 4His potential value was a hair better than his elder brother.Note: As expected of twins, their basic stats are basically the same. Suggestion for them to practice combination attacks to maximize the advantage of being twins.\u2026Sun Mo knew the system classified potential value into seven tiers: extremely low, low, below average, average, above average, high, extremely high.Zou Brother\u2019s potential value was above average. In a class, they could be considered third-tier students. Their results would surpass the majority and if they worked hard, they might enter the top twenty or even exceed expectations slightly to enter the top ten. However, if they wanted to be in the top three, that was definitely impossible.This pair of brothers didn\u2019t even have a \u2018high\u2019 potential value. No wonder the system didn\u2019t show any interest.Seeing Sun Mo remain silent, Qin Fen thought that he was afraid. He complacently shook his head and pointed to the door with his chin. \u201cIf you don\u2019t dare to compete, scram now. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself here!\u201d\u201cWould our number one great teacher in Jinling City be afraid?\u201d\u201cSun Mo, f*** him!\u201d\u201cSun Mo, I support you!\u201dA few intern teachers egged them on. Although people were cheering for Sun Mo, they actually wanted him to \u2018die\u2019 because they were jealous that he managed to recruit students. Hence, they wanted to egg him into battle.Who was Qin Fen?He was a graduate of Jixia Learning Palace, one of the nine famous schools. How could Sun Mo win? If he lost, he would be in an embarrassing position. At that time when the few students under him saw his true appearance, they would definitely feel cheated. If they took the initiative to resolve their master-student relationship, Sun Mo would have a stain on his reputation forever.\u201cMy teacher is not afraid!\u201dLu Zhiruo argued.\u201cWhat do you want to compete in?\u201dSun Mo glanced at Yuan Feng. This fellow was still drooling and was like an idiot, vacantly staring around. He didn\u2019t even know how to turn back when he knocked into a wall. He simply continued to try and walk forward.\u201cWe are teachers, we definitely have to compete in our guiding abilities!\u201dQin Fen\u2019s voice was bright and clear. He confidently swept his gaze through the crowd. \u201cI\u2019ve already asked earlier. The cultivation bases of this pair of twins are the same. Their strength is relatively similar too. Why don\u2019t we each instruct one of them? Two hours later, they will have a competition. Whichever side wins will be the one with a better teacher.\u201dThe students nodded. This idea wasn\u2019t bad.\u201cWhat if someone concedes intentionally?\u201d Xuanyuan Po scratched his head. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they just fight against me? The one who persists longer will be the winner!\u201dHush!After Xuanyuan Po finished speaking, hissing sounds rang out from within the lecture hall as the other students cursed at him. (Aren\u2019t you too brazen?)The Zou students stared at Xuanyuan Po with unfriendly looks on their faces. They were all in the prime of their youth, who among them wouldn\u2019t have an ego? How would they allow someone to step on them?\u201cA combat addict whose brain turned into muscle. Just by thinking about it, you will know it\u2019s impossible for Qin Fen to agree. This is because he\u2019s worried that you might throw the fight!\u201dLi Ziqi was speechless but on account of her junior martial brother, she explained, \u201cMany great teachers are here for the student recruitment meet. If the Zou brothers have an outstanding performance, some great teachers might regard them highly. So, will they give it their all or not?\u201d\u201cAre you all willing?\u201dQin Fen glanced at the Zou brothers.\u201cWe are willing!\u201dAfter the Zou brothers exchanged a mutual glance. Both of them agreed in unison. With such a good chance to display their abilities, only a fool would give it up. Looking at the number of people in the lecture hall and the spectators outside\u2026this could already be considered a big scene.\u201cWe should find one more respectable teacher as the judge. Things will be fair then.\u201dLi Ziqi suggested.\u201cLet me do it!\u201dJin Mujie spoke.Everyone turned their heads. When the students and teachers here saw the three golden threads on her white robe\u2019s cuff and collar, their expressions immediately turned into one of respect as they bowed in greeting.\u201cGood day to Teacher Jin!\u201dThese were the students.\u201cTeacher Jin!\u201dThen the teachers.\u201cTeacher Jin!\u201dQin Fen was astonished. This incident actually drew her attention? His mind and spirit stirred. With a great teacher on the scene, there was no need for him to be afraid that Sun Mo would refuse to acknowledge the result.As long as his performance was outstanding and was appreciated by Jin Mujie, he would be able to have much better days in the Central Province Academy in the future.\u201cThe two of you first have an exchange of ten moves.\u201dJin Mujie walked out of the crowd and instructed the Zou brothers.After this pair of brothers learned of Jin Mujie\u2019s identity, they were so agitated that they were trembling. After agreeing, they started to attack.At this moment, how would they still remember Sun Mo and Qin Fen? They wanted nothing more than to show their abilities to Jin Mujie.\u201cVery well. Both of you can stop now.\u201dAfter the Zou brothers exchanged ten moves, they still wanted to continue, but they were stopped by Jin Mujie. \u201cTheir strengths are indeed comparable. Sun Mo, Qin Fen, you guys can select your candidate!\u201d\u201cZou An, are you willing to receive my guidance?\u201dQin Fen asked, directly naming the younger brother.Zou Ping started. His expression showed a hint of indignation and disappointment. Didn\u2019t this mean that Qin Fen held his younger brother in higher regard than him?\u201cDon\u2019t be depressed. Because you are the elder brother and would usually take care of the younger brother, your personality is also more mature. Hence, your strength should be slightly higher. I\u2019m not willing to take advantage of Sun Mo; hence, I allowed him to choose you.\u201dQin Fen explained.\u201cSo this is the case!\u201dZou Ping\u2019s expression relaxed.\u201cDo you have any objections?\u201dJin Mujie asked Sun Mo.\u201cNope!\u201dSun Mo shook his head, but his eyes involuntarily surveyed Qin Fen. This fellow was as expected of a graduate from the Jixia Learning Palace, his judgment was pretty good.Speaking of potential, Zou An was slightly better than Zou Ping.\u201cYou guys can go and guide your respective student. Two hours later, gather at the public square before the teaching building for the competition!\u201dAfter Jin Mujie finished speaking, she involuntarily snuck a glance at Sun Mo. Her favorable impression of him became much weaker. He was after all inferior to a graduate from a famous school. He wasn\u2019t able to tell that Qin Fen had seized a better student.\u201cSun Mo, see you later!\u201dQin Fen appeared very polite, but his heart was filled with a sense of superiority. (You are a salted fish graduate from a rubbish school. Most probably, you don\u2019t know I\u2019ve already won the starting gambit, right?)\u201cThere\u2019s no need for us to look for a classroom. This place is fine, it is pretty spacious.\u201d After Sun Mo finished speaking, he clapped his hands. \u201cCan I trouble everyone to leave? I want to proceed with the solo-guidance!\u201dAlthough the audience felt curious, they knew this incident concerned the reputations of the two teachers and the future of the Zou brothers. Hence, they didn\u2019t cause a disturbance and decided to leave.Zou Ping didn\u2019t say anything. His heart was filled with trepidation as he looked at Sun Mo.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Teacher Sun is very awesome,\u201d Li Ziqi consoled.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dLu Zhiruo nodded.Jin Mujie was the last to leave. After that, Yue Rongbo closed the door and walked over. \u201cThat Qin Fen has some skill. Sun Mo, you shouldn\u2019t do things according to what he said!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dSeeing that Yue Rongbo was clearly not optimistic about Sun Mo\u2019s chances, Lu Zhiruo\u2019s heart clenched.\u201cEh?\u201dJin Mujie initially wanted to leave, but after she heard these words, she halted her steps. (Who\u2019s this middle-aged guy? How could he see through Qin Fen\u2019s scheme?) She had thought he was the parent of a student.In order to prevent Sun Mo from cheating, Jin Mujie stopped and listened attentively outside the door. Her personality was strict and serious. If Sun Mo cheated, she wouldn\u2019t show any mercy.\u201cDo you think he can win just by having good judgment?\u201dSun Mo counter-asked.\u201cMn? You also saw through Qin Fen\u2019s scheme? In that case, why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201dYue Rongbo couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cWhat scheme?\u201d Xuanyuan Po scratched his head. \u201cCan you guys make things clearer?\u201d\u201cZou Ping, don\u2019t be fooled by Qin Fen\u2019s words. In truth, he feels that you are inferior to Zou An. That\u2019s why he took the initiative to \u2018seize\u2019 him.\u201dSun Mo looked into Zou Ping\u2019s eyes as he explained.\u201cHehe!\u201dZou Ping laughed. \u201cYou want to arouse my spirit of competitiveness? It won\u2019t work. Me and my younger brother have sparred many times throughout the years, and we are relatively evenly-matched. Also, many elders have said that our level of talent is roughly the same.\u201dThey were twins, how much different would their level of talents be?\u201cTeacher, if you only have such a minor trick up your sleeves, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to win.\u201dZou Ping didn\u2019t think highly of Sun Mo anymore.\u201cYou are mistaken. In terms of attacking, Zou An is more aggressive while you are calmer in comparison.\u201dSun Mo waggled his index finger. \u201cI think that usually in your spars, you would give in to your younger brother more, right?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dZou Ping started. When he thought back, things were truly the case. Because he was the elder brother, although he was just older by a few minutes, he should have the appearance of an elder brother. There were many times where he would give in to his younger brother.\u201cIt is fine if it\u2019s a normal spar. But once this concerns your futures, the importance of this competition is far greater. Given Zou An\u2019s aggressive personality, the chances of him winning are higher.\u201dIn order to teach students better, back in his world, Sun Mo had bought over 1,000 books about psychology.\u201cAh?\u201dZou Ping was stunned.Outside the lecture hall, after Jin Mujie heard this, a look of amazement appeared on her face. After that, she showed a self-mocking smile. She had thought that Sun Mo was in the dark and she had even looked down on his identity as a graduate from a normal school.Seeing Zou Ping\u2019s expression, Li Ziqi knew that Sun Mo was correct. After that, she felt happy and proud. (Teacher Sun is truly awesome!)Ding!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +10.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi. Neutral (96/100).Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUpon hearing the system notification, Sun Mo snuck a glance at Lu Zhirou. (Ai\u2026what an adorable dumb girl, she still doesn\u2019t understand how awesome I am.)However, it was fine. It was enough to have big breasts. After all, she could raise his luck.As for Xuanyuan Po, Sun Mo had no hopes that this muscle-brained student could contribute a lot of favorable impression points. After he sighed, he suddenly started. Xuanyuan Po had already acknowledged him as a master, but the prestige connection between them hadn\u2019t been activated yet!There was no mistake. Xuanyuan Po hadn\u2019t even contributed a single favorable impression point.Yue Rongbo was surprised, his gaze was filled with even more admiration than usual. However, he still didn\u2019t understand. \u201cSince you know about this, why didn\u2019t you bring it up and display an initial show of strength against Qin Fen earlier?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49: Magnificent PerformanceEveryone held their breaths, waiting for Sun Mo\u2019s reply.\u201cI can bring it up, but what will happen then? Even if I get the younger brother and manage to win, Qin Fen will still have excuses.\u201dSun Mo shrugged.\u201cYou can continue to teach Zou Ping.\u201dAfter Li Ziqi said that, before Sun Mo replied, she understood. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Since the results would be the same, then you might as well not mention it. After that, you can tell Zou Ping about it privately to stimulate his yearning for victory. In the end, the only part that Zou Ping might lose to Zou An is probably just the mentality of \u2018always wanting to give in to the younger brother.\u201dAt the mention of this, Li Ziqi smiled sweetly and couldn\u2019t help but grab onto Sun Mo\u2019s arm, shaking it. \u201cTeacher, you\u2019re really such a schemer!\u201dDing!+10 favorable impression points from Li Ziqi.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi: Friendly (106/1000).\u201cCongratulations. Your prestige connection with Li Ziqi has reached \u2018friendly\u2019. Rewarded with one black-iron treasure chest. Please continue to work hard!\u201dA big treasure chest that was shrouded in a black glow appeared before Sun Mo.Jin Mujie, who was outside the door, subconsciously nodded when she heard of this. To think that this Sun Mo had gone on with the scheme! He was a scheming person!Yet, why was it that she didn\u2019t find Sun Mo detestable but had some admiration for him instead?\u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201dLu Zhiruo appeared stunned, not understanding the conversation.\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about things too simply. I can tell you clearly that Zou Ping\u2019s potential isn\u2019t comparable to his younger brother\u2019s,\u201d Yue Rongbo reminded him.\u201cAmazing!\u201dSun Mo gave him a heartfelt thumbs-up. If it wasn\u2019t for his Divine Sight, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell the difference in the duo\u2019s potential value. However, Yue Rongbo was able to do so. Was this the judgment that a 4-star great teacher had?\u201cYou know about it?\u201dAfter hearing Sun Mo\u2019s praise and realizing that he wasn\u2019t trying to flatter him, Yue Rongbo felt even more curious. Could Sun Mo tell this as well? This was a judgment Yue Rongbo had developed after having seen over 100,000 students. How could Sun Mo possibly\u2026Zou Ping\u2019s countenance turned grim. After all, no one liked to be looked down upon.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll definitely be able to defeat Zou An. Come, take off your clothes.\u201dSun Mo stroked Lu Zhiruo\u2019s head as if he was stroking a Scottish Fold cat.\u201cHuh?\u201dZou Ping subconsciously grabbed onto his clothes and backed off one step. Other than Li Ziqi who seemed to be thinking about something, everyone else appeared stunned. One was required to take off their clothes when receiving guidance?\u201cZiqi and Zhiruo, go out!\u201dSun Mo instructed then secretly said \u2018open\u2019 in his heart, opening this black-iron treasure chest.A small palm-sized round bottle appeared before him.Ancient whale oil!The essence was extracted from the ancient whale oil\u2019s fats and bones and refined together with 16 types of precious medicinal herbs. For external use. The effect will be greater when used together with the ancient massage technique!Remark, as the effects are too powerful, please use them in small amounts each time. If used in too high dosages, it would corrode the nerves, resulting in a great feeling of excitement.\u201cSystem, you\u2019re really bent on having me go down the path of a masseur!\u201dAlthough Sun Mo was complaining, he was very satisfied with this reward. The black-iron treasure chest was the treasure chest of the lowest level. It wasn\u2019t a loss to be able to get a bottle of ancient whale oil that was worth 1,000 points.As expected, the papaya girl could increase his luck.Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help but pat Lu Zhiruo\u2019s head again.The papaya girl turned her head, letting out a \u2018hmmm?\u2019 sound. (Why are you touching my head again?)Li Ziqi pouted.\u201cThere\u2019s not much time left. Don\u2019t just stand there, quickly take off your clothes. If the two of you don\u2019t mind, you can stay!\u201dSun Mo urged.\u201cWhat\u2026 What do you want to do?\u201dZou Ping felt a little uneasy.\u201cThere\u2019s only two hours. What guidance can I give you? I can help you analyze battle strategies at most. Even if I were to point out your problems in battle, these aren\u2019t things that can be changed within a short period. Therefore, the only thing left to do is to give you a tuina.\u201dSun Mo had already thought through things. Right now, he had two cards up his sleeves. One was the ancient massage technique, and the other was his \u2018Soul Imprint\u2019 great teacher halo.The owner of this body had gone through many battles to reach the blood-ignition realm. Sun Mo had long since integrated the owner\u2019s memories and experience with his own. If he were to strike all of them into Zou Ping\u2019s mind with the Soul Imprint, it\u2019d take immediate effect and last for five minutes.Yes, he\u2019d definitely be able to win. However, Sun Mo had always been someone who liked to think about things before putting them into action. This was like playing a game of Fighting the Landlord [1]. Who would throw out a king bomb [2] right from the very start?The system said that the Soul Imprint was unique to him. Such a great trump card must be left for the most critical moment.Of course, in Sun Mo\u2019s opinion, the ancient massage technique and the ancient whale oil would be able to bring up Zou Ping\u2019s physique, spiking his battle condition to its peak.\u201cTuina?\u201dZou Ping\u2019s gaze turned hesitant.Yue Rongbo opened his mouth, not knowing what to say.\u201cZou Ping, you\u2019re lucky. Teacher\u2019s Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands is really amazing. He had given that Qi Shengjia a massage a few days back, allowing him to level up.\u201dLi Ziqi looked at the small round bottle in Sun Mo\u2019s hand. \u201cThis is the ancient whale oil. It\u2019s said to be refined from ancient whale\u2019s fats together with many precious medicinal herbs.\u201d(Oh my, I\u2019m teacher\u2019s disciple now. I should be able to experience the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands\u2019 prowess as well, right? But I\u2019ll have to take off my clothes. It\u2019ll be so embarrassing!)Li Ziqi\u2019s face suddenly flushed up.\u201cGulp!\u201dZou Ping swallowed a mouthful of saliva then took off his clothes. He lay down on the tables that Xuanyuan Po had helped to put together, acting like a salted fish.\u201cGo get some clean water!\u201dSun Mo instructed Xuanyuan Po. Ancient whale oil was very expensive, and he couldn\u2019t bear to waste it.Seeing Xuanyuan Po coming out, Jin Mujie felt bad about secretly listening outside the door. She was just about to leave when he saw quite a few students who were also listening in secretly.Yuan Feng, who had been dragged out and was roaming around the corridors, was drooling a lot from the corners of his mouth. Many students who saw that were pointing and snickering at himSun Mo pulled out the cork from the small round bottle, and a strange fragrance immediately permeated the classroom. Even Yue Rongbo, who had great experiences, couldn\u2019t help but take a whiff, wearing a curious expression.\u201cRelax!\u201dAfter saying that, Sun Mo pressed down on Zou Ping\u2019s back.With just a few presses, relying on the grandmaster-grade Muscleforge Technique as well as the expert-grade Circulation Technique, he was able to grasp Zou Ping\u2019s body condition.He had to say that this kid was as expected of someone who came from a family that specialized in medicinal herbs business. His body was very healthy and Qi Shengjia couldn\u2019t be compared with him.Even if Zou Ping didn\u2019t cultivate, his lifespan wouldn\u2019t be short.After putting down the water, Xuanyuan Po, who was sitting down by the side, lost interest after a few glances. Wasn\u2019t it just a massage? However, Yue Rongbo\u2019s curiosity got piqued even further.\u201cAs expected, Sun Mo\u2019s massage technique doesn\u2019t belong to any of the three main factions and six branches!\u201dLi Ziqi wore an expression as if she was struck by a realization. After she went back home, she immediately went through materials and even went to look for a few masters who excelled in tuina massage to ask them. However, no one knew about it.The massage was still continuing. Even though Sun Mo also ridiculed himself by saying that he was like a masseur, he was very serious when he got to do things.Pa!Sun Mo exerted great force in both hands and slapped out toward Zou Ping\u2019s back!Li Ziqi was struck by a wave of vigor and immediately covered up her face with both hands, peeping through her fingers. She couldn\u2019t help but let out a cry in her heart.(It\u2019s here! It\u2019s here!)A tremendous amount of golden spiritual qi surged out from Sun Mo\u2019s hands, instantly condensing to become a golden human.\u201cHuh?\u201dLu Zhiruo was surprised and backed away. This golden human that had a glistening skin was too strange.The lower half of his body was a wisp of spiritual qi, while his upper body was that of a muscular guy. He was gleaming in golden light, as if covered in olive oil.\u201cHmmm?\u201dXuanyuan Po clutched tightly onto his silver spear.The golden human opened his eyes, raising both arms up, showing off his muscles vigorously. He shouted \u2018ataa\u2019 and then with a flying pounce, smashed down on Zou Ping\u2019s back, elbow first.Pffft!Zou Ping\u2019s cheeks puffed up like a frog, and he spurted out a mouthful of saliva.\u201c\u2026\u201dEven though this was his second time seeing this golden human, Sun Mo was still unable to accept it. Was this the genie from Aladdin?The golden human\u2019s head was still wrapped up in that purple turban, and his vest was open, not buttoned up. Also, he would occasionally show off his muscles as if he was in a bodybuilding competition, filled with a philosophical aura.\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026\u201dEven Yue Rongbo, who had seen a lot of things in his life, was stunnedZou Ping\u2019s cries quickly filled up the classroom as it really felt too comfortable.Drool was uncontrollably dripping out from the corners of his lips, gathering into a small puddle on the ground.Sun Mo stood at the side, forcibly holding back the uncomfortable feeling he had and admiring the massage techniques of the genie from Aladdin\u2019s lamp.He had to say that putting aside the golden human\u2019s image, his technique was really pleasing to the eye. It appeared magnificent and dazzling.\u201cNo, I can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201dHaving seen the golden human jumping high up then smashing his thick elbow onto Zou Ping\u2019s back, Li Ziqi shook her head. She had better give up on letting Teacher Sun give her a massage. She\u2019d rather die than have a muscular man rub and knead her body.After the massage ended, the genie put his palms together and bowed toward Sun Mo. Then, he disappeared into the air like a wisp of smoke that had been blown by the wind.Zou Ping lay down on the table, his eyes rolling back. Like a pool of mush, his limbs were convulsing uncontrollably. At the same time, his muscles were trembling, absorbing a tremendous amount of spiritual qi.\u201cHe\u2019s going to level up?\u201dYue Rongbo suddenly understood this state.\u201cGet up, meditate!\u201dSun Mo pulled Zou Ping up and gave him two slaps when he saw that Zou Ping hadn\u2019t gotten back to his senses.Pa! Pa!It was useless. Even though his potential value was on the higher end of average, Zou Ping\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t much different from Qi Shengjia back then.Thankfully, the spiritual qi absorbing process hadn\u2019t stopped. Moreover, as Zou Ping had soaked in medicinal baths since young, his body\u2019s ability to contain spiritual qi was greater.Boom! Boom! Boom!A tremendous amount of spiritual qi gathered with great impact.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXuanyuan Po immediately sat down cross-legged and started meditating. He didn\u2019t care what that golden human was. The only thought on his mind was to not waste this dense spiritual qi.Right now, in the other classroom that had been cleared up, Qin Fen was seated on a stool, appearing relaxed while wearing a confident and proud smile.\u201cZou An, don\u2019t be nervous. I guarantee that you\u2019ll definitely win this.\u201d[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou_dizhu[2] card combination that can beat any other sets in the game.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What did he mean by this?\u201cSince young, every time I spar with my elder brother, I\u2019ll reserve a little bit of my strength. After all, there are no benefits even if I were to win!\u201dZou An shrugged. There was something else he hadn\u2019t said. It was only by giving his elder brother a high winning rate and thus developing a sense of superiority that he would continue to act like an older brother, defending him and standing in front of him if there were any problems.Otherwise, if the younger brother was stronger than the older brother, why would the older brother still take care of him?\u201cHaha!\u201dQin Fen smiled. As expected of someone who was born in a big clan. He was skilled in scheming from a young age.\u201cTeacher Qin, I can win and let you hold your head high in front of that Sun Mo. But what can I get out of it?\u201dZou An sniffed.Qin Fen\u2019s smile stiffened up, his mood turning bad. \u201cYou\u2019re threatening me?\u201d\u201cHow would I dare? It\u2019s just a deal!\u201dAcknowledging a teacher was something that affected one\u2019s entire life. Therefore, Zou An wanted to take a gamble even if it meant that he would offend Qin Fen.\u201cYou want me to introduce you to a great teacher?\u201dQin Fen graduated from Jixia Learning Palace, so there were naturally no issues with his intellect. He didn\u2019t need Zou An to say anything before he could guess his objective. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t be able to win either!\u201dZou An threatened.Hearing this, Qing Fen had the strong urge to slap Zou An, killing him. However, not only couldn\u2019t he do that, but he even had to coax Zou An.After all, if he couldn\u2019t win against Sun Mo, his reputation would be ruined.Which student would want Qin Fen as their teacher if he couldn\u2019t even win against a teacher who sponged off a woman?\u201cI\u2019m only a teaching assistant now. I don\u2019t know many great teachers.\u201dQin Fen explained.\u201cThen what about Liu Mubai?\u201dZou An lowered his expectations.\u201cAlright!\u201dQin Fen gave in. He had no other choice since Zou An had a handle over him.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be thanking Teacher Qin!\u201dZou An smiled, feeling satisfied. He felt that he was a great genius. Given Zou Ping\u2019s brain, he\u2019d forever be within his control.When Sun Mo and Qin Fen had gotten into a fight, Zou An was already considering how he should make use of this opportunity to bring the greatest number of benefits for himself.\u201cHeh, I\u2019m not a tool for your fight!\u201dZou An was proud.\u201cThen can you perform your cultivation art now? Let me see if there are any areas in which you\u2019ll need to improve on!\u201dQin Fen didn\u2019t wish to lose.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019ll definitely win!\u201d Zou An put a few tables together and lay down, resting. \u201cThat Sun Mo must have the same thought as you, so my brother is definitely showing him his cultivation art. Let him waste his energy. I\u2019ll end up being more energized during the battle and will have even greater chances of winning.\u201d\u201cThis guy\u2019s heart is really black!\u201dQin Feng cursed in his heart, but he had to admit that what Zou An said was right.Forget it. At the thought that he\u2019d be winning against Sun Mo later, being able to taunt him as much as he wanted, Qin Fen\u2019s displeasure was reduced by a lot.(As expected, my opponents are still Liu Mubai and Gu Xiuxun. I\u2019ll gain a great reputation in the future as well and let those students think of means and ways to come under my tutelage.)\u2026Yuan Feng woke up in the corridors.\u201cWho am I? Where am I?\u201dFeeling uncomfortable in his chin and neck, Yuan Feng touched them and realized that they were covered in drool. There was even a large patch on the chest area of his clothes that was soaked.\u201cWhat did I do?\u201dYuan Feng furrowed his brows tightly as he bore with the headache, recollecting what had happened. Wasn\u2019t he quarreling with Sun Mo? Why was he now in the corridors?Sun Mo seemed to have snapped his fingers and then a golden arrow had shot out toward him. Thereafter, he lost consciousness\u2026\u201cHaha, the way that intern teacher looks while roaming around is really foolish, like an idiot!\u201dQin Feng heard the sneers coming from the surroundings, and his face turned even paler.\u201cI was hit by\u2026 Ignorant and Incompetent?\u201dYuan Feng panicked, and his body trembled uncontrollably. He quickly took a look around. As the student recruitment meet was being held, the teaching building was open to the public, which allowed students to take a look around. Therefore, there were a lot of people.\u201cWuuuu, I\u2019m a goner. I\u2019ve definitely been seen by many students. What should I do?\u201dYuan Feng felt great despair and had the urge to bang his head into the wall and just die.As an intern teacher, he naturally knew how amazing the \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019 halo was. He yearned to get it, and if students were to create trouble and not listen while he was teaching, he would throw it out and turn the student into an idiot!\u201cF*ck your mom, Sun Mo!\u201dYuan Feng was filled with anger at the thought of that guy who sponged off a woman. Then, he was overwhelmed with envy because Sun Mo already had four students.If he were to get one more student, he would be able to become a substitute teacher.Liu Mubai had thought well of Xuanyuan Po but failed to recruit him. So why did Xuanyuan Po acknowledge Sun Mo as his teacher?(Is there still any justice in the world? Is that Xuanyuan Po blind?)\u201cEven I am better than him!\u201dYuan Feng mumbled and kicked the wall.Bang! Bang! Bang!Yuan Feng\u2019s leg hurt, but he didn\u2019t care. He could only forget about the humiliation temporarily through the pain, venting the fury he was feeling.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe sudden reproach took Yuan Feng by surprise. He turned and saw Jin Mujie who was dressed in a moon-white long robe. She was standing a short distance away, looking at him with a scowl.\u201cTeacher\u2026 Teacher Jin!\u201dYuan Feng quickly bowed and greeted, instantly covered in a cold sweat that drenched his clothes. This was a 3-star great teacher. His unseemly state after being hit by the \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019 halo was probably seen by her.\u201cEven if you haven\u2019t been employed officially, you should still conduct yourself strictly like a teacher. What are you doing? Does the wall have any feud with you?\u201dJin Mujie was angry. \u201cTo be showing such an unseemly sight in front of the students. Where\u2019s your self-control?\u201d\u201cTeacher Jin, I was wrong.\u201d Yuan Feng apologized.\u201cGo wipe off all the footprints on the wall and then clean up the corridors.\u201dJin Mujie punished him.\u201cEn!\u201dYuan Feng lowered his head like a docile quail. He felt even more embarrassed when he glanced out from the corners of his eyes. The students in the vicinity were all pointing at him and talking amongst themselves.\u201cDon\u2019t always look down on others and deny them. If you can\u2019t accept it, then use your strength to defeat them and not use rumors to defame others.\u201dWhen Jin Mujie saw Yuan Feng reproaching Sun Mo earlier, especially saying that he was someone who sponged off a woman, she felt that there was a problem with Yuan Feng\u2019s character.It was normal for there to be competition between teachers, but couldn\u2019t he be more aboveboard with his methods?\u201cI understand!\u201dYuan Feng didn\u2019t dare to rebut. He was being reprimanded by a 3-star great teacher, so he could only quietly listen.\u201cAfter cleaning up, go and apologize to Sun Mo.\u201dAfter saying that, Jin Mujie turned and left.\u201cHuh?\u201dYuan Feng was stunned.(Why do I have to be the one apologizing? I am the victim.) At the thought of how he had entered a delirious state after being hit by \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019 halo and had been seen by so many students, Yuan Feng\u2019s heart ached even more. However, since this was an order by a great teacher, he could only suppress his fury and dissatisfaction, replying \u2018I understand.\u2019\u201cI\u2019ll tell Headmaster An of your problem.\u201dJin Mujie had a heartfelt love for the Central Province Academy. Therefore, she didn\u2019t wish for its standard to be lowered. She felt that someone like Yuan Feng didn\u2019t deserve to work here.\u201cHuh? Teacher Jin, don\u2019t!\u201dYuan Feng was frightened and perspiration broke out profusely. Once Jin Mujie were to tell this to Headmaster An Xinhui, then his internship life in the Central Province Academy would be over. He wouldn\u2019t be able to get a chance to be converted to a permanent position.Jin Mujie didn\u2019t pay him any heed.Plod!Yuan Feng fell down limply onto the ground, smacking himself hard in the face. Why did that Sun Mo have such good luck? At the thought of how even Jin Mujie knew of his name, Yuan Feng felt even more upset.\u201cSo what if he is handsome? So what if he sponges off a woman?\u201dYuan Feng yelled out. In his heart, he had secretly felt envious of Sun Mo in the past. Why was Sun Mo the one who was able to sponge off a woman? Why was it not him? His mother was to be blamed for not giving him a handsome face.\u2026When Zou Ping came to his senses, he could feel that a tremendous change in his body. His hearing and vision became very clear, and his body felt extremely light. It was as if he had just soaked in a top-notch medicinal bath for two hours, no, the effect was even better than that!Without saying anything, Zou Ping jumped off the tables and swung his fists around, performing Crow Fist.This felt great! Really great!The stiff and unsmooth feeling that he usually felt had disappeared.Zou Ping\u2019s current state was like a bicycle that hadn\u2019t been maintained for very long, but could now be used for speeding like a roller coaster after being oiled and reinforced.\u201cDo you want me to spar with you?\u201dXuanyuan Po was itching for a fight.\u201cDon\u2019t fool around!\u201dLi Ziqi rolled her eyes at Xuanyuan Po. (What if you were to hurt him?)\u201cThank you, Teacher Sun!\u201dZou Ping bowed respectfully toward Sun Mo, changing to speak in a more respectable tone.Ding!+10 favorable impression points from Zou Ping.Prestige connection with Zou Ping initiated: Neutral (10/100).\u201cIt\u2019s a pity! You almost leveled up!\u201dSun Mo felt a little dissatisfied. He could see Zou Ping\u2019s realm through his Divine Sight. Zou Ping was now at the peak of 1st-level of the body-refinement realm.\u201cI was wondering why I\u2019m feeling so good. So it\u2019s because I\u2019m about to reach the boundaries of the realm!\u201d Zou Ping clenched his fists excitedly. He felt as if he had an endless amount of strength now. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m sure to win against my younger brother now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that your pre-battle condition isn\u2019t bad.\u201dYue Rongbo pointed out.\u201cHuh? Then if the ancient whale oil is used, won\u2019t he be able to level up?\u201dLi Ziqi noticed the blind spot.Everyone immediately turned their gaze to the small bottle placed at the side of the table. It had white liquid in it that emitted a fragrant scent.\u201cIf Qin Feng were to lose after I rely on an external item, then he probably won\u2019t accept the results.\u201dSun Mo kept the bottle. If he were to use the ancient whale oil to give Zou Ping another massage, he\u2019d definitely be able to level up. However, Sun Mo didn\u2019t wish to do that.Although the ancient whale oil was a nourishing medicinal item and not the kind of pill medicine that could allow one to level up immediately after eating them, it was still medicine.\u201cOh!\u201dZou Ping looked at that bottle and licked his lips in yearning. It was a pity that he didn\u2019t get to enjoy it.\u201cYour massage technique is really impressive. Where did you learn it from?\u201dYue Rongbo was curious.\u201cA great teacher taught me!\u201dSun Mo randomly came up with an excuse.\u201cHaha!\u201dKnowing that Sun Mo didn\u2019t wish to say it, Yue Rongbo didn\u2019t continue to ask. However, his wavering mind had come to a decision.Regardless of the price, he must get his hands on Sun Mo.Ding.+2 favorable impression points from Yue Rongbo.Prestige Connection with Yue Rongbo: Neutral (3/100).Hearing the notification, Sun Mo turned to look at Yue Rongbo and noticed that he was looking at him. Sun Mo was very familiar with that gaze and smile. It was the same feeling he had when he was looking at a good game and couldn\u2019t wait to have it for himself.\u201cBrother Yue, I don\u2019t like guys!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo\u2019s lips twitched.\u201cHmmm?\u201dYue Rongbo was stunned for a moment before he broke out laughing. This Sun Mo was interesting, very interesting. It\u2019d be very enjoyable if he could work together with him.\u201cTeacher, quickly start to give him guidance. There\u2019s not much time left before the sparring.\u201dLi Ziqi reminded him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had been busy for the past few days and hadn\u2019t had any chance to read it.\u201cHuh?\u201dLi Ziqi was stunned. (Teacher, is it alright for you to be so confident? What if things don\u2019t turn out the way you want them to? It\u2019d be embarrassing.)In Li Ziqi\u2019s view, since there was time, they should make full use of it.\u201cTeacher is so cool!\u201dLu Zhiruo was innocent and didn\u2019t think too much. She only felt that Sun Mo, who was so calm, had the air of a great teacher.Ding.+15 favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Neutral (98/100).Sun Mo threw a glance at the papaya girl. (Your trigger points for favorable impression pots are a bit off. To think that you didn\u2019t show any reaction after seeing my amazing ancient massage technique, but had contributed 15 favorable impression points because I picked up a novel\u2026)However, that was still better than Xuanyuan Po. This kid had sat down and meditated after seeing that he couldn\u2019t spar against Zou Ping. He really didn\u2019t think of anything other than fighting.\u201cIt\u2019s true that there isn\u2019t a need for it anymore. If the Zou brothers have similar capabilities, then with Zou Ping getting close to the peak of the 1st-level, he\u2019d be able to crush Zou An.\u201dYue Rongbo explained. He admired how confident and at ease Sun Mo was acting now.Jin Mujie was a strict and fair teacher. When it was ten minutes away from the agreed time, she sent students to notify both parties that they must arrive at the square in front of the teaching building on time. If they were late, it\u2019d be treated as they had given up.When Sun Mo came down, he saw that there were already seven to eight hundred people gathered at the square. There were a lot more people than there had been before.\u201cEveryone, please keep quiet. Both parties please get prepared. The match will start in three minutes!\u201dJin Mujie spoke up and the place immediately fell silent.\u201cHow do you feel?\u201dQin Fen asked.\u201cI had a good sleep!\u201dZou An stretched out his body. When he looked at Zou Ping, a hint of disdain flashed in his eyes. (The days in which I hide my capabilities are over. From today onward, I\u2019ll let everyone in the family know that I\u2019m a lot more outstanding than you, who is my elder brother. I\u2019m the perfect successor to the clan.)\u201cVery good. Go on. Go clinch the victory that belongs to us.\u201dQin Fen patted Zou An on the back.Very soon, both brothers stood in the center of the arena, standing ten meters apart from each other.\u201cBrother, you\u2019ll have to watch out!\u201dZou Ping moved his limbs excitedly.Although his chances of winning every time they sparred in the past were average, Zou Ping was very disappointed each time. After all, he was the elder brother and should be the stronger one. Therefore, as time passed by, he started to hate sparrings. However, Zou Ping felt unprecedented confidence today.\u201cHaha.\u201dZou An couldn\u2019t be bothered to give a reply.\u201cTo prevent any accidental injuries, both parties will fight with bare hands!After ascertaining that neither of them had any objections, Jin Mujie called for the match to start.Zou An\u2019s legged stomped down onto the ground and he darted out!In his eyes, there wasn\u2019t a foolish and mediocre elder brother. There was only his plan for the future.He would give his all, defeating Zou Ping in a second and then receiving the attention and cheers from the crowds. He would then get Qin Fen to stick to his end of the agreement, to introduce him to Liu Mubai. He would then make use of Liu Mubai\u2019s connections to reach a greater stage, becoming a winner in life.\u201cPerfect!\u201dAt this happy thought, Zou An\u2019s lips couldn\u2019t help but curl up into a smile. Then, his smile stiffened up.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201dZou An was surprised. How did his brother suddenly appear in front of him in the blink of an eye? This speed was too fast!Boom!Strong gales seethed and a heavy punch was launched.Zou An instinctively raised his arm to put up a block.He had seen this move many times in the over 100 matches they had. Therefore, he didn\u2019t feel nervous. He even had the leisure to think about his retaliation. However, at the next instant, he received a huge blow in his left shoulder.Bang!Zou An was sent flying out.\u201cWhat?\u201dQin Fen was so surprised that his eyeballs were popping out. (What happened to all the talk about you being more outstanding? What happened to the talk about how you\u2019d definitely win? Why were you sent flying right off the bat?)\u201cI can win!\u201dZou Ping was so agitated that he let out a loud cry, stomped down fiercely onto the ground, and shot out like a sharp arrow, catching up to Zou An.Bang! Bang! Bang!Zou An was like a small boat that was wavering amidst a storm, swaying left and right, seeming as if he was going to topple at any moment.\u201cAm I dreaming?\u201dZou An was very surprised, and he would feel the occasional pain coming from his body after being hit by punches, causing him to clench his teeth. However, what he found the most unbearable was the current state in which he was being overpowered.When had his elder brother become so strong?Zou An wanted to retaliate but wasn\u2019t able to do so. The power of Zou Ping\u2019s punches, his body\u2019s agility, and the speed at which he was punching out were all one notch above Zou An\u2019s.\u201cHe\u2019s able to become so strong after one hour?\u201dAs Zou An knew his elder brother\u2019s abilities well, his surprise turned into astonishment, and he subconsciously glanced toward Sun Mo.This intern teacher wasn\u2019t simple. It was no wonder that Xuanyuan Po would choose to acknowledge Sun Mo as his teacher.\u201cBrother, admit your loss. You won\u2019t be able to win against me.Zou Ping advised him to surrender, feeling exhilarated. He had wanted to say this since three years ago, but never had the chance to do so. Yet today, he could say it.Ding!+15 favorable impression points from Zou Ping.Prestige connection with Zou Ping: Neutral (25/100).Sun Mo watched the match. Although he had received the favorable impression points contributed by Zou Ping, he didn\u2019t feel happy about it. To think that this kid was already getting distracted when he hadn\u2019t won the match yet\u2026As expected, Zou An managed to grab hold of this instant and immediately retaliated. He pulled back his right arm and lashed it out like a whip toward Zou Ping.Crow Tailflick!\u201cThis move again?\u201dZou Ping\u2019s heart skipped a beat. This was his brother\u2019s special move, and he had suffered from it many times in the past. He knew how to defend against it, but his body was unable to keep up. Therefore, he could only take the attack forcibly.This was what it meant to be doing things proudly, bullying the other party for being able to see the attack but unable to fend it off!Pa!Zou An\u2019s right hit a target. However, it wasn\u2019t Zou Ping\u2019s shoulder, but his crossed arms instead!\u201cWhat?\u201dZou An was very shocked and then he was kicked in the stomach.Bang!Zou An tumbled.\u201cI managed to block it? Haha, to think that I managed to block off the Crow Tailflick?\u201dZou Ping laughed out loudly. When he looked at Zou An again, his gaze had turned from a serious one into an overlooking one. There was even an additional hint of confidence in it.\u201cIt was just a coincidence!\u201dZou An couldn\u2019t accept it and bellowed out. He couldn\u2019t wait anymore. He must use his killer move, or else he would lose.\u201cTrash!\u201dQin Fen cursed and had a strong urge to personally go down and fight on Zou An\u2019s behalf.\u201cHe\u2019s winning!\u201dLi Ziqi was very happy.Lu Zhiruo grabbed tightly onto Sun Mo\u2019s sleeve as she watched the intense battle.\u201cSo this is Zou Clan\u2019s great hereditary technique, the Crow Fist? Interesting!\u201dXuanyuan Po planned on looking for a chance and challenged this pair of twins.Zou An immediately pulled his right arm back, gathering his spiritual qi onto his fist until it was shrouded in a black glow. This was his killer move. Once performed, he\u2019d be able to turn the tables around immediately.\u201cElder Brother, you\u2019re the one who won\u2019t be able to win!\u201dZou An sneered. When they sparred in the past, when he took on this pose, his elder brother would attack him anxiously. But it was useless, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it.\u201cHmph, I deliberately let you send me flying. This will allow me to draw my distance from you and perform my ultimate skill.\u201dThe reason Zou An said this was not only to give Zou Ping mental pressure. He also wanted to hide his awkwardness of having been sent flying. However, he was good at adapting and assessing situations. It was just that this time around, his elder brother hadn\u2019t come attacking toward him fiercely like he had done in the past.Zou Ping inhaled deeply and pulled his right arm back, taking on the same pose as Zou An.\u201cHmmm?\u201dZou An was so shocked that he almost bit off his tongue.(What the hell? Brother, what are you trying to do? Have you also managed to learn this move? That\u2019s not the case. When you used this move in the past, you\u2019d fail eight of ten attempts\u2026Hmph, you want to put in the effort and show off so that a great teacher would set their eyes on you? That\u2019s impossible. I\u2019ll let you know that the difference between us is that of heaven and earth!)Zou An discarded all distracting thoughts and was about to attack when he saw Zou Ping forestalling him with a disposition of a dragon spear that was launched out from a ballista.Domineering, sharp, and advancing forth without hesitation!Crow Covers the Sun!Boom!Zou Ping\u2019s clothes fluttered, and dust flew all over the place. His punch was like a rainbow stretching across the sky, piercing forth.Zou An panicked, and sweat broke out on his forehead. He took a deep breath and then anxiously launched out his killer move.Crow Covers the Sun!There wasn\u2019t a need for a great teacher to be here. Even the students could tell that even though both of them had performed the same move, Zou Ping had struck out with greater prowess.Both fists collided!Boom!Zou Ping stood there while Zou An was like a battered sack that had been sent flying, falling to the ground. His right arm bent at 90 degrees as a \u2018kacha\u2019 sound rang out.\u201cAhhh, my arm!\u201dZou An held onto his arm and cried out agonizingly.\u201cThe match is over. Zou Ping wins!\u201dAfter saying that Jin Mujie moved and appeared next to Zou An, giving him treatment immediately.\u201cWon? I\u2019ve won?\u201dZou Ping looked at his fist, still wearing a look of disbelief on his face. Thereafter, he threw a glance at his younger brother whom he had defeated. It was only then did he swing his fist excitedly, letting out a bellow!\u201cI\u2019ve won!\u201dThis cry was Zou Ping releasing his pent up feelings from being suppressed by Zou An over so many years. As the elder brother, he should be the one suppressing his younger brother.Zou An\u2019s countenance was grim as he looked at Zou Ping, his lips trembling non-stop.He had lost. It was all over. The occupational path he had planned out for himself was cut off before he had even started. He could no longer be a winner in life.\u201cOh yay, he won!\u201dLi Ziqi cheered. As expected, Teacher Sun was really amazing!Ding!+10 favorable impression points from Li Ziqi.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi: Friendly (116/1000).Clap clap clap!Lu Zhiruo clapped enthusiastically.Ding!+15 favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Friendly (113/1000).Sun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. Zou Ping and Zou An\u2019s potential was on the higher end of average, so Sun Mo didn\u2019t have a great desire to recruit them to begin with. At the sight of this scene, he became even less interested.Putting Zou An aside, Zou Ping\u2019s character was a little cold. While he could explain this as him having lost control over his attack, he hadn\u2019t gone up to console his brother at the first instant. Instead, he was immersed in the exhilaration of victory. This wasn\u2019t acceptable.Moreover, both Li Ziqi and Lu Zhiruo had contributed favorable impression points. This meant that both of them were impressed by his guidance. However, there wasn\u2019t any reaction from Zou Ping at all.This member from a great clan was showing some signs of burning the bridge after crossing it!\u201cBrother, are you convinced now?\u201dZou Ping asked proudly\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for me to lose. I\u2019ve been the one giving way to you every time we spar. My aptitude is better than yours!\u201dZou An glared at Zou Ping, not understanding what was going on.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cForget it. I\u2019ve been the one who has been giving way to you. Don\u2019t believe me? The result now is the best evidence!\u201dZou Ping was very proud.Zou An fell silent. (Could it be that my assessment is really wrong? Is Zou Ping\u2019s aptitude really better than mine? Could it be that he had held back when he had lost in the past?)\u201cThat\u2019s not it. The reason you can win must be because you\u2019ve undergone a tremendous change in the past two hours!\u201d Zou An looked toward Sun Mo in astonishment. \u201cWhat guidance did you give him?\u201dSun Mo stood there like a narcissus, covered in the afternoon sunlight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52: Sun Mo Victorious. Indisputable!\u201cWhat is this teacher\u2019s name?\u201dThe students amongst the spectators were starting to find out about Sun Mo\u2019s name.This was how the world of the great teachers was like. The greater the teacher\u2019s reputation, the more students would come. If they were to produce a few great disciples who could enter the Greencloud Rankings, then there\u2019d be an overwhelming number of students who would come under the teacher\u2019s tutelage.\u201cSun Mo won?\u201dYuan Feng, who was amongst the crowd, was shocked. What was Qin Fen doing? A graduate from Jixia Learning Palace had lost out to Sun Mo, who wasn\u2019t known even in Songyang Academy? Did you buy your graduation certification?Although it wasn\u2019t good to be looking down on his alma mater, Songyang Academy was only D-Grade. It was a big difference from someone who had graduated from one of the Nine Greats. How could he lose?Qin Fen was one of the only three amongst this batch of intern teachers who had graduated from the Nine Greats. He had always been very proud and didn\u2019t care for people like Zhang Sheng. However, he had now become Sun Mo\u2019s stepping stone.\u201cSun Mo is going to become famous!\u201dAt the thought of this, Yuan Feng was filled with envy.\u201cAs expected, Teacher Sun is really amazing!\u201dQi Shengjia, who was amongst the crowd, looked at Sun Mo with admiration. When he turned toward Zou Ping, his gaze was that of envy. Sigh, his aptitude was too weak, and he didn\u2019t have the chance to go under Teacher Sun\u2019s tutelage.Ding!+20 favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia: Friendly (393/1000).\u201cQin Fen, you\u2019ve lost!\u201dSun Mo wouldn\u2019t reply to Zou An\u2019s question. He didn\u2019t deserve to know it. Moreover, Sun Mo was feeling emotional from the system\u2019s notification.Qi Shengjia was really an honest person. He had felt admiration toward Sun Mo just from watching in the crowd, giving him so much favorable impression points. It was more than what he had gotten from Zou Ping, who was the one who had gained improvement.\u201cShould I take him as my student?\u201dSun Mo hesitated.Qin Fen, who had been enraged to begin with, turned pale upon hearing this. He felt extremely embarrassed. His countenance was grim.(No, I haven\u2019t lost!)Qin Fen thought real hard, trying to find a loophole in this. He questioned, \u201cSun Mo, the reason why Zou Ping could win wasn\u2019t because he had gained advancement in his martial technique, but that he had an overwhelming advantage in his physical attributes. You fed him something, right?\u201dHua!The moment he said this, a commotion broke out. It was because Qin Fen was indirectly hinting that Sun Mo had cheated.\u201cYour desire to survive is really strong.\u201dSun Mo sneered.Zou An\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cTeaching Assistant Qin, please do not defame both Teacher Sun and my character.\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t anxious, but Zou Ping was. If he didn\u2019t clarify things, it\u2019d be a great blemish to his name if people were to misunderstand that he had only temporarily increased his battle prowess after taking alchemical pills.Moreover, after having witnessed the prowess of the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands, Zou Ping had made up his mind to acknowledge Sun Mo as his teacher. At times like this, the disciple naturally had to be the one to speak up and defend his teacher.\u201cQin Fen, please mind your words.\u201dJin Mujie frowned, disliking Qin Fen\u2019s attitude of not admitting his loss.\u201cTeacher Jin, if Sun Mo hasn\u2019t done anything against his conscience, then I\u2019d like to know what guidance he has given Zou Ping.\u201d For the sake of his reputation, Qin Fen could only gamble on this. Thankfully, he wasn\u2019t a fool and knew that he should conceal things. \u201cThis is also an experience for me.\u201dSwoosh!Everyone turned their gaze toward Sun Mo. They were curious as well.\u201cSun Mo, what\u2019s your take on this?\u201dJin Mujie asked.\u201cI don\u2019t mind!\u201d Sun Mo shrugged. \u201cZou Ping, tell him!\u201d\u201cTeacher Sun had used the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands to give me a massage for about five minutes, and my physique gained a tremendous improvement then. Right now, it is almost at 2nd-level of the body-refinement realm.\u201dZou Ping explained. Before the tone for his last word ended, Zou An was the first to cry out.\u201cImpossible!\u201dZou An was wearing an expression as if Zou Ping was lying and spurted out angrily, \u201cYour realm should be the same as mine. According to my estimation, it\u2019ll take at least three months before we can level up. What crap are you saying that you\u2019d be able to gain such a great improvement within five minutes?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it either, but it\u2019s the truth!\u201dZou Ping was elated when he saw his younger brother\u2019s expression. (Now you know how amazing your elder brother is, right? Continue to show respect for me in the future!)\u201cAncient Dragon Capturing Hands? That sounds really domineering!\u201d\u201cA five-minute massage can make up for three months worth of cultivation? Why does it sound a little fake?\u201d\u201cThat must be a lie, right?\u201dThe spectators murmured amongst themselves. If what Zou Ping said was true, then Sun Mo\u2019s Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands would be almost comparable to the Origin Nurturing Pill\u2019s effects.This was an alchemical pill used for the body-refinement realm. After taking it, it would strengthen one\u2019s constitution and physique, increasing the person\u2019s realm by one level.Of course, the price was very expensive. Just one pill would cost over 100,000 silver taels. It\u2019d be a dream pill if one\u2019s family wasn\u2019t rich enough to have their own ore mines. They\u2019d be better off working hard in their cultivation.Hearing Zou Ping\u2019s words, Qin Fen lit up, as if he had grabbed onto a life-saving straw. He immediately questioned, \u201cSun Mo, we are competing on our guidance, and not massages and tuina!\u201d\u201cHaha, Teaching Assistant Qin, can you be any more shameless than this?\u201d Sun Mo was amused. \u201cMay I ask what is considered guidance?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s referring to pointing out students\u2019 flaws!\u201dQin Fen insisted on his point, but even he was feeling embarrassed to be saying this.In Middle-Earth\u2019s nine provinces, a teacher\u2019s guidance was in all aspects. Not only did it include guidance on their cultivation, but also the maintenance of the student\u2019s physical and mental constitution. Sometimes, the teacher might even worry about their student\u2019s marriages.It could be said that after a student came under a teacher\u2019s tutelage, they\u2019d become the teacher\u2019s raw jadestone. The teachers\u2019 eventual goal was to forge them into perfect masterpieces.Some strict teachers might interfere with a lot of areas, including the food they ate, their cultivation plan, their rest time, and even their relationships.If one were to encounter great teachers who were abstinent, after coming under the teacher\u2019s tutelage officially, the students had to be mentally prepared that they\u2019d never be able to have sex in their lifetime.After Sun Mo read the materials in the library and found out about this, he was surprised as well. However, he quickly accepted things.In ancient China, the relationship between a teacher and their student was very close. Once a teacher, forever one\u2019s father. Even in the modern world, those top-notch coaches would also practice strict control over the sportsmen under them.In Middle-Earth\u2019s nine provinces, after a student acknowledged a teacher, they would stay by the teacher\u2019s side to learn, and the teacher would have to give it their all into guiding the student. Even though it couldn\u2019t be said that many teachers treated their students as their own kids, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that they treated each of their students as half a son or daughter.As long as there wasn\u2019t any cheating involved, the teacher would be considered a good one as long as the student could defeat their opponents. It didn\u2019t matter what guidance the teacher had provided.The students around burst out laughing, suddenly feeling a little disappointed toward the Jixia Learning Palace. This was the standard of its graduates?Of course, there were more students and teachers who were interested in the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands.\u201cYou want my guidance? Alright. This Zou Ping isn\u2019t a match for his brother in terms of his martial technique. His moves don\u2019t flow smoothly enough, and he would need to work hard in his cultivation. As for Zou An, he has shown great mastery in his Crow Fist, being able to lash out and draw back freely. It\u2019s also because of this that he had been able to freely hold back in the past matches, causing Zou Ping to wrongly estimate their abilities.\u201dSun Mo spoke up.He had kept his Divine Sight activated for the entire period of the battle. Through the duo\u2019s detailed data, and then comparing it to their actual battle, it was easy for him to come up with some conclusion.\u201cBut Zou An has his flaws too. He is over-reliant on his right arm, and the prowess of his left arm is almost half of his right. If he doesn\u2019t put in effort into training it, it would be a weak point.\u201dZou An, who wasn\u2019t convinced with the outcome earlier, was stunned, and he looked at Sun Mo in astonishment. It was because everything that Sun Mo said was right. However, he had only exchanged less than ten moves with his brother, which had taken only several tens of breaths. How did Sun Mo manage to see through so many things within this short period?Yue Rongbo was surprised as he assessed Sun Mo. It seemed that Sun Mo was a lot more amazing than he had thought him to be.Ding!+3 favorable impression points from Yue Rongbo.Prestige connection with Yue Rongbo: Neutral (6/100).Jin Mujie looked at Sun Mo with her beautiful gaze, feeling a little surprised. She was then a little angry. Both Zhang Hanfu and Wang Su had given An Xinhui pressure in order to fight for authority, and they had thrown Sun Mo to the logistics department. Thankfully, he hadn\u2019t resigned in fury. Otherwise, the Central Province Academy would lose a good teacher.Ding!+1 favorable impression points from Jin Mujie.Prestige connection with Jin Mujie: Neutral (3/100).Sun Mo tried to stop the twitching in his lips when he heard the system\u2019s notification. The two great teachers\u2019 expectations were really high, so they were very stingy with the favorable impression points.The two great teachers had naturally seen through the Zou brothers and thus admired Sun Mo.The spectators had no idea if what Sun Mo said was right. However, Zou An knew and he had lost. This meant that he probably had no chance of entering under Liu Mubai\u2019s tutelage. Therefore, he was decisive and walked over, kneeling before Sun Mo.\u201cTeacher Sun, please take me as your disciple!\u201dBang!Zou An kowtowed.(Sun Mo shouldn\u2019t be too bad either. He\u2019s able to see through me from a few moves of the battle. Moreover, he seems to be Headmaster An Xinhui\u2019s fiance. If I can make use of this connection, I\u2019ll be able to climb even higher.)Seeing what his younger brother had done, Zou Ping was stunned for a moment before he realized that his younger brother was trying to snatch the chance away from him. He quickly came dashing over.\u201cTeacher Sun, Student Zou Ping admires your talent and hopes to study under your tutelage!\u201dBang!Zou Ping kowtowed. As he was wary of his younger brother, he kowtowed even harder.The two students knelt before Sun Mo respectfully, not daring to get up without his approval.At the sight of this, Qin Fen was so angry that his lips were twitching fiercely. It was as if something he had his eye on had been snatched by someone else. Then an indescribable feeling of disappointment appeared on his face.There was no need for Jin Mujie, the referee, to determine the winner. The Zou brothers\u2019 kowtow was the best answer.Sun Mo won. It was indisputable!\u201cTeacher, you\u2019ve managed to snatch them!\u201dLi Ziqi put out a finger and secretly poked Sun Mo\u2019s arm.Lu Zhiruo stood at the side, smiling sweetly as she looked at Sun Mo with admiration. Teacher Sun was so amazing!Ding!+10 favorable impression points from Li Ziqi.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi: Friendly (126/1000).Ding!+15 favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo..Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Friendly (128/1000).Qi Shengjia, who was amongst the crowd, looked at the Zou brothers, feeling extremely envious. He wanted to be Teacher Sun Mo\u2019s student as well!Ding!+20 favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia: Friendly (413/1000).Sun Mo was feeling a little embarrassed from listening to the consecutive notifications. (Qi Shengjia, I\u2019ll feel proud if you admire me this much.) However, he couldn\u2019t help but throw a glance toward Xuanyuan Po. This battle maniac was watching the show with his arms crossed in front of his chest, completely unmoved.Yuan Feng was so jealous that his eyes had turned red. If it wasn\u2019t a crime to kill, he\u2019d dash out immediately and chop Sun Mo up into meat paste.If an intern teacher could recruit five students in this student recruitment meet, they could be officially hired, becoming a teacher recognized by the Saint Gate. Sun Mo had achieved this, and he was even faster than Qin Fen.Jin Mujie backed off a few steps, leaving the stage to Sun Mo. This was the glory he had earned.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeeing that Sun Mo wasn\u2019t showing any reaction, Zou An felt a little unhappy. (I\u2019m already giving you face, so why aren\u2019t you agreeing?)If it was some other intern teacher, they\u2019d have helped both of them up long ago. He curbed his impatience and shouted out even louder, \u201cTeacher, please accept this disciple!\u201d\u201cTeacher, please accept this disciple!\u201dZuo Ping quickly did the same. No matter what, he must be the first to enter Sun Mo\u2019s tutelage, being his younger brother\u2019s martial senior.\u201cBoth of you can get up!\u201d Sun Mo looked at this pair of twins calmly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll be able to teach either of you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The surrounding people were staring at Sun Mo with astonished looks on their faces, as though they had heard wrongly.What did he say?Unable to teach? Wasn\u2019t this a tactful rejection?Jin Mujie glanced at Sun Mo. This answer caused her interest in him to grow.Yue Rongbo nodded. He didn\u2019t really like this pair of brothers either, but he didn\u2019t remind Sun Mo because this could be considered a testing ground. He wanted to see if Sun Mo could withstand the temptation of being acknowledged by someone as their masters.When a teacher first got acknowledged as a master by someone, they would feel a floaty feeling and accept all types of students. But they didn\u2019t know that by doing this, it would seriously affect their teaching career.And as for Sun Mo, he was very rational.\u201cHehe, teacher. This joke isn\u2019t funny!\u201dZou An laughed dryly, but he felt a sense of unease in his heart.Zou Ping thought that it was because Sun Mo was unsatisfied with his attitude. Hence, he kowtowed once more with more force. \u201cTeacher Sun, please accept this student!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already said it. I\u2019m just an intern teacher, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t know how to teach you guys. I don\u2019t want to ruin two wonderful pairs of unpolished jades.\u201dSun Mo tactfully declinedHua~A clamor rang out in the surroundings. This time around, even a fool could understand. Sun Mo basically didn\u2019t want this pair of twins. But what was the reason?Someone that could cause two teachers to vie for them should definitely be a genius, right? Also, there were teachers who read through the information booklet. This pair of siblings had pretty good rankings.Li Ziqi hurriedly tugged on Sun Mo\u2019s sleeves. She used her hand and covered her mouth as she asked softly, \u201cTeacher, did you say wrongly?\u201d\u201cYou two can get up, you will definitely be able to find an even better teacher.\u201dAccepting disciples was a major matter, Sun Mo naturally wouldn\u2019t be casual about it. The attitude Zou Ping showed after he had defeated Zou An, as well as the low number of favorable impression points he contributed, made Sun Mo think lowly of this student.There were no other reasons. Zou Ping\u2019s personality was too cold.As for Zou An, Sun Mo simply didn\u2019t wish to have him as a student.\u201cTeacher, why?\u201dZou Ping didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWe are from an aristocratic clan that deals in the herbs business. Our constitution isn\u2019t bad and has been headhunted by many teachers from the time we participated in the student recruitment meet up until now. Could it be we still fail to gain your regard?\u201d\u201cJust get up, he already showed that he doesn\u2019t think highly of you. Why are you still calling him Teacher?\u201dCompared to his elder brother, Zou An was easily angered. However, this was the temperament of youths. After he spoke, everyone could feel the resentment in his tone.\u201cHas Sun Mo gone silly?\u201dIn the crowd, Yuan Feng was dumbstruck. If it was him, he would definitely accept them immediately.A pair of wealthy students would definitely not forget to pay respects to their elders every new year. The teacher would have a better life too. However, Sun Mo rejected them? Was he retarded?\u201cHaha! Haha!\u201d Qin Feng was so angered that he started laughing. He glared at Sun Mo. \u201cSince you don\u2019t think highly of them, why did you still want to compete with me?\u201d\u201cYou are the one who wanted to compete with me!\u201dSun Mo shrugged.Qin Fen was dumbfounded. Now that he recalled it, it was true. Sun Moon didn\u2019t say anything earlier, it was Yuan Feng and himself who egged Sun Mo on. After that, the competition occurred.From the start to the end, Sun Mo had never stated that he wanted to accept this pair of brothers as his disciples.\u201cI\u2019m so despicable!\u201dQin Fen muttered, wanting nothing more than to slap himself.\u201cYou just realized it?\u201dSun Mo counter-asked.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dQin Fen was almost angered to death. The main reason for his anger was that Sun Mo obtained Xuanyuan Po and Li Ziqi. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have bragged that this pair of brothers had wanted to take him as their master just to gain back some face. And now, everything was over.\u201cHehe, teacher is so toxic!\u201dLi Ziqi used her elbow and prod Lu Zhiruo.\u201cMn! Mn!\u201dThe papaya girl continuously nodded. After that, she felt a little happy. It was so good that Sun Mo had accepted her.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dSun Mo no longer wished to be surrounded and watched. He called out to the two girls as he turned to leave.The surrounding spectators automatically opened up a path, and the intern teachers all stared at Sun Mo with complicated emotions. However, the majority of them felt emotions like depression and unhappiness.He was also just an intern teacher, yet he was choosing which students to accept? Who gave him the courage to do so? If they were in his shoes and someone wanted to take them as their masters, they would immediately rush forward to accept.\u201cI\u2019ve already said it earlier. How can they be worthy of Teacher Sun?\u201dUpon seeing the Zou brothers fail to acknowledge Sun Mo as their masters, Qi Shengjia felt relief. He also retracted the tiny hope in his heart. His aptitude couldn\u2019t even be compared to the Zou brothers. Hence, he would also naturally not be successful in getting Sun Mo to be his master.Qin Fen\u2019s eyes locked on to Sun Mo when he left. All of a sudden, he clenched his fist and shouted, \u201cTeacher Sun is awesome indeed. Most probably, you will be able to trample on Liu Mubai soon and suppress Fang Wuji, becoming the number one great teacher in Jinling!\u201dYue Rongbo frowned. Qin Fen\u2019s heart was so filthy.As the saying went, three men made a tiger. With so many spectators here, as long as the spectators casually spread these words, the meaning of the words would surely change.Qin Fen wanted to create troubles for Sun Mo.In Jinling City, Liu Mubai and Fang Wuji of the Myriad Daos Academy were two extremely famous great teachers-to-be. By lumping Sun Mo with them, Qin Fen evidently wanted to make trouble for him.The spectators hadn\u2019t dispersed completely, Qin Fen and the Zou brothers had already left. But nothing could be done; things were too embarrassing for them.\u201cTeacher Qin, do you hate Sun Mo very much?\u201dAt a remote location, Zou An caught up to Qin Fen.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dQin Fen mockingly asked.\u201cAccept us as disciples. We will cooperate together and make sure we teach that Sun Mo a good lesson. Also, I will defeat all his disciples.\u201dZou An bared his teeth when he said this. Each word was dripping with blood.Zou Ping had a look of reluctance on his face. Although he didn\u2019t hold Qin Fen in high regard, he knew that after they were publicly rejected by Sun Mo, it isn\u2019t going to be easy for them to acknowledge another master.Who wouldn\u2019t have pride? If there was a teacher that accepted the Zou brothers which Sun Mo didn\u2019t want, wouldn\u2019t that be saying that they were inferior to Sun Mo?Picking up the left-over vegetables that no one wanted. It wouldn\u2019t be pleasant to hear.\u201cYou want to acknowledge me as your master now? It\u2019s too late. As for taking revenge, I\u2019ll do it myself!\u201dAfter Qin Fen spoke, he turned and left directly.He was someone who had been abandoned by this pair of brothers earlier, how could he accept them again? If a graduate of the Jixia Learning Palace didn\u2019t even have a little bit of ambition like this, he might as well commit suicide.As they watched Qin Fen depart, a bitter look appeared on Zou Ping\u2019s face. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\u201cWhat can we do? Let\u2019s think of a way to enter the Myriad Daos Academy!\u201d Zou An no longer had any face to stay here. After they exited the school, he turned his head back and looked, \u201cJust wait and see. I will definitely kill my way back and make Sun Mo, who underestimates me, kneel before me. I\u2019ll make him admit that what happened today was the greatest mistake he ever made in his life!\u201d\u2026In the headmaster office.During the evening, the sounds of Zhou Lin\u2019s pants could be heard as she rushed over.\u201cEldest Miss, have you heard?\u201dZhou Lin was very anxious.\u201cHeard about what?\u201dAn Xinhui stood before the window. The white robes she was wearing were free from dust.\u201cSun Mo was victorious in the competition between him and Qin Fen!\u201d Zhou Lin spoke. After that, anger rose in her heart. \u201cThe crucial point is that although he had won, why did he still have to humiliate the Zou brothers?\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201dAn Xinhui asked.\u201cAfter losing so much face, the Zou brothers would definitely go to another school. I\u2019ve checked, the aptitudes of the brothers aren\u2019t bad.\u201dZhou Lin was extremely anxious. \u201cRight now, our school needs a supply of good students, and we cannot miss out on any one of them. Also, what qualifications does Sun Mo have to reject others?\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t he reject them?\u201dAn Xinhui\u2019s tone was calm.\u201cHe\u2026he is just an intern teacher!\u201dFrom Zhou Lin\u2019s point of view, Sun Mo should be extremely happy to the point of burning incense if there were students willing to follow him. How would he have the qualifications to be picky?An Xinhui fell silent.\u201cQin Fen is also stupid enough. He must have looked down on Sun Mo because Sun Mo is from Songyang Academy. In the end, he suffered instead. He definitely has learned a lesson.\u201dQin Fen was someone the eldest miss had recruited. Hence, Zhou Lin had high hopes for him. She didn\u2019t expect he would screw up so badly right at the start. This would cause those in the higher echelons of the school to doubt her judgment ability.\u201cAre you done?\u201d An Xinhui pressed her brow\u2019s center. \u201cIf you are finished, go and prepare 1,000 taels of silver and send them to Teacher Zhou Song for me.\u201d\u201cAh? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zhou Lin was startled. When she thought of Liu Wenyan yesterday, she couldn\u2019t help but ask in shock, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me he also resigned?\u201d\u201cRight!\u201dAn Xinhui drew in a deep breath.Zhou Lin subconsciously glanced at the desk, and there were three letters of resignation there. This caused her heart to tremble violently. \u201cWho else resigned?\u201d\u201cLook at them yourself!\u201dAn Xinhui didn\u2019t wish to mention these names.Zhou Lin grabbed the letters and after she looked at them, she called out, \u201cQin Fen also resigned?\u201d\u201cAfter losing so much face, could he still stay on?\u201dIf Qin Fen didn\u2019t leave, An Xinhui would be disappointed. A good teacher should have their pride.\u201cNo way, we have to get him back! He\u2019s a graduate of the Jiaxia Learning Palace!\u201d Zhou Lin panicked. \u201cThis year, we only recruited three graduates from the Nine Greats. If one of them left, the Myriad Daos Academy would definitely ridicule us to the death.\u201dRecently, the job-hopping trend was very serious in school. If the school couldn\u2019t even retain a teacher, their reputation would surely plummet.If they couldn\u2019t even attract graduates from the Nine Greats, it meant that the school no longer had any attractive side to them.One must know that in the student recruitment meet ten years ago, there would always be a publicity segment saying how many intern teachers from the Nine Greats there were that year.\u201cQin Fen should still be at a place not far from the school\u2019s entrance.\u201dAn Xinhui laughed softly.\u201cMn?\u201dZhou Lin didn\u2019t understand.\u201cHe lost his face, and the only way he can gain them back is to resign and wait for me to invite him.\u201dAn Xinhui glanced at the campus\u2019s grounds, no longer wanting to explain. The Central Province Academy might have declined, but they had not fallen so low as to beg those who had resigned to come back. Even if the school was demolished, they had to be demolished standing!Naturally, Qin Fen had lost and he didn\u2019t match An Xinhui\u2019s aesthetic sense. As the top graduate of the Heavenly Mystery Academy of Cloud Province, her level of judgment was very high. Since she had already judged wrongly once, she wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake again.Zhou Lin no longer said anything as she understood the eldest miss\u2019s temper the most. Once she made a decision, she wouldn\u2019t change it. Besides, the eldest miss hated those who schemed against her the most. \u201cHmph, wanting to use the eldest miss to elevate his own status? Stop dreaming!\u201d\u201cGo and give this to Teacher Zhou Song!\u201dAn Xinhui instructed.Zhou Lin glanced at Zhou Song\u2019s resignation letter. A look of unhappiness appeared on her face. That fellow said that he was already old and useless. Today, when he saw Sun Mo\u2019s performance, he felt very gratified and congratulated Headmaster An for finding such a good fiance. Also, with young teachers like Gu Xiuxun and Liu Mubai, there was no need to worry about the school\u2019s future. Hence, he could set his heart at ease and retire.\u201cAll these words are nonsense. That old man even said that he wanted to share life-and-death with our school just a month ago. Right now, he clearly cannot withstand the pressure and wish to step away from this pile of muddy water.\u201dZhou Lin wanted to tear the resignation letter into pieces. Could Sun Mo be considered a good fiance? Zhou Song must be blind!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cJust do it according to my instructions!\u201dAn Xinhui didn\u2019t wish to explain. She still had many things she needed to do.\u201cAlright then!\u201d Zhou Lin had no solutions and could only do as she was asked. Before she left, she added a reminder, \u201cEldest miss, it\u2019s better that you quickly go and warn that Sun Mo. He better stop creating trouble.\u201dNot long after Zhou Lin left, she ran back extremely urgently. After she checked up on Sun Mo, she discovered that there was an even crazier thing that guy had done compared to rejecting the Zou brothers. He had rebutted the 1-star teacher Lian Zheng who was the year\u2019s head and also recruited a bunch of rubbish students.\u201cNo way, we cannot let Sun Mo continue wreaking havoc. What if he angered Teacher Lian so much that he decided to leave? Lian Zheng is a solid supporter of the eldest miss!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54: Headhunting from the Myriad Daos Academy\u201cSun Mo publicly rebutted Teacher Lian?\u201dThe rays of the setting sun penetrated the windows, cascading on An Xinhui\u2019s startled face. Her childhood sweetheart shouldn\u2019t have such courage!\u201cIn order to become an official teacher, Sun Mo\u2019s actions were unscrupulous. I\u2019ve investigated it. That student named Jiang Leng had many damaged spirit runes on his body. This proved that in the past, he was looked upon highly by a great teacher that specialized in spirit runes. However, maybe because his talent was insufficient, he got abandoned. Jiang Leng is clearly trash that someone tossed away, why did Sun Mo pick him up?\u201dZhou Lin panted as her chest heaved.There must be a reason why Jiang Leng had so many spirit runes on his body. Before things were clear, regardless of whether the reasons were good or bad, an ordinary person would have definitely chosen to watch first. However, Sun Mo had directly recruited Jiang Leng. Truly, no medicine could cure retardedness.\u201cI understand.\u201dAn Xinhui\u2019s expression was as calm as ever. This was something her grandfather taught her. Even if she was in extreme panic, she had to maintain a composed external appearance.Zhou Lin kept jabbering on and didn\u2019t leave. An Xinhui wanted to focus on her job, but she was also filled with some worry with regard to Sun Mo. Hence, she decided to take a trip outside.About the contempt Zhou Lin had for Sun Mo, An Xinhui actually didn\u2019t like it very much. However, she knew that Zhou Lin was saying all of these for her own good. Hence, she didn\u2019t berate her.Her situation in the Central Province Academy was simply too bad. The two factions belonging to Zhang Hanfu and Wang Su were extremely overbearing. Her own authority was the weakest and there weren\u2019t many people around her that she could depend on. If she chased her trusted aide who had been working for her for almost ten years away, what would the others think?Zhou Lin\u2019s abilities might not be sufficient, but she was loyal enough.\u2026Under the setting sun.Qin Fen stood at a location not far from the school gate, feeling trepidation in his heart. Would An Xinhui come out for him? Most probably yes, right? After all, he was someone she personally chose. She should have some patience toward him, right?However, why did no one come to find him despite having waited for so long?As the sun gradually set, Qin Fen\u2019s heart sank to the bottom of the valley. Although the summer wind was quite hot, his entire body felt ice-cold.He was given up by An Xinhui.Qin Fen\u2019s hand shook. He carried up the luggage beside him and wavered as he walked a few steps forward. He soon couldn\u2019t bear it and turned his head back.The school gate of the Central Province Academy was solemn and silent.He had wanted to become a great teacher here and help An Xinhui restructure the school, allowing it to be part of the Nine Greats once again. After that, with his effort, he wanted to win An Xinhui\u2019s heart and marry her. He would then become the headmaster of the Central Province Academy while leaving a heavy brushstroke on the great teacher rankings of the nine provinces.Yet, before his dream even began, it was already shattered.\u201cSun Mo, it\u2019s all because of you!\u201dQin Fen clenched his fist as he bit his lips tightly. He took another few steps forward and subconsciously turned his head once more. There was no one behind.A self-mocking smile appeared on Qin Fen\u2019s face.That was right. An Xinhui was a genius from the Heavenly Mystery Academy, a rare talent of the century. She was someone with beauty and intelligence, and a ranker on the Devastating Beauty Rankings. Wanting to use such a figure\u2019s status to get back the pride he lost? How laughable.An Xinhui definitely saw through this. That was why she didn\u2019t appear.\u201cYou must have felt that my talent is not enough, and I\u2019m not worthy for you to persuade!\u201dQin Fen mumbled to himself.After thinking through this point, he picked up his luggage. He cast a deep look for a few minutes at the school gate and departed.(Just wait! Sun Mo, I will definitely kill my way back. Also, An Xinhui, I will let you know that your decision is a mistake!)\u2026A`choo!Sun Mo sneezed.Lu Zhiruo, who was like a puppy following behind him, instantly took out a handkerchief and passed it over.Because it was already quite late, Li Ziqi had already returned home. However, why did Yue Rongbo still follow Sun Mo?\u201cJust say it out directly if you have something to say. Let me make things clear first, I\u2019m not a ji lao (gay guy)!\u201dSun Mo spoke.\u201cWhat is a ji lao?\u201dYue Rongbo had already thought of something to say, but when he heard this term, something that he had never heard before, he was confused.\u201cHehe!\u201dSun Mo surveyed Yue Rongbao. Were 4-star teachers so free? If he had so much free time, why didn\u2019t he go home to read novels!\u201cForget it, my instincts tell me that \u2018ji lao\u2019 isn\u2019t a good term!\u201d Yue Rongbo decided not to continue asking. After that, he coughed and spoke in a solemn term, \u201cI admire you very much!\u201d\u201cI already said that I\u2019m not a ji lao!\u201dSun Mo furrowed his brows and took two steps back.\u201cAh?\u201dYue Rongbo was stunned. After that, he finally realized what \u2018ji lao\u2019 meant. (Wait a minute! I also don\u2019t like guys. I love small bre*sts the most!)Sorrowless Lake looked extremely beautiful during the evening. It was one of the famous places in the Central Province Academy. Those prospective students who visited the academy would definitely come here to admire it, or they would have wasted their trip here.An Xinhui felt that since Sun Mo wanted to recruit students, he would definitely not ignore this place. Hence, she searched for him in the surroundings, and as expected, she saw his figure not long later.She initially wanted to go over and greet him, but they had not met for many years and An Xinhui suddenly found it a little hard to speak to him. What should she say? Hence, she decided to follow him for now while she thought about what she wanted to say.\u201cShould I talk about matters of our lives or official matters? If I choose official matters, would it seem a little cold?\u201dAn Xinhui was conflicted. After all, she had another identity \u2013 Sun Mo\u2019s fiance. However, her attention soon turned to Yue Rongbo.This person looked so familiar. A few minutes later, An Xinhui finally remembered. Wasn\u2019t this guy the extremely famous Yue Rongbo? He recently rose to 4-stars and was in the imperial bulletin issued by the Saint Gate.Why was he together with Sun Mo?Because of curiosity, An Xinhui didn\u2019t choose to greet Sun Mo. She followed silently behind them instead.Their voices drifted over to her ears.\u201cI admire you very much!\u201dYue Rongbo\u2019s tone became much more formal compared to earlier.\u201cYou said that before.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s expression was calm. However, An Xinhui was shocked when she heard this. What the hell? So Yue Rongbo was someone who liked guys?Then again it was understandable. When the red rays of the setting sun fell on Sun Mo, his clearly-defined features exuded even more elegance and handsomeness. This was especially so for his eyes. They were like pools of spring water, causing everyone to generate a sense of intimacy toward him.An Xinhui didn\u2019t expect that the little boy who used to follow her everywhere when they were young was now a young man so good-looking that even guys would feel attracted to him.\u201cOh, I mean I admire your talent. Do you want to join my team?\u201dYue Rongbo issued an invitation.Sun Mo didn\u2019t react. However, An Xinhui, who was at the back, almost cried out in shock. If it wasn\u2019t for her hand covering her red lips fast enough, she would have been discovered.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Yue Rongbo admires Sun Mo\u2019s talent?\u201dAn Xinhui furrowed her brows.She didn\u2019t understand it. This was especially so for these two days. She kept hearing Zhou Lin complaining about Sun Mo\u2019s atrocious behavior. Yet now, An Xinhui saw a 4-star teacher wanting to recruit Sun Mo. This feeling of shock was as incredulous as the sight of a crow transforming into a phoenix.It seemed like Zhou Lin must have mistaken something due to her prejudice toward Sun Mo.\u201cContinue!\u201dSun Mo knew some supervisors of famous schools who loved to invite various teachers that specialized in different secondary occupations and gather them to form a team.This was the so-called great teacher group. Because there were many people with different secondary occupations, it meant that the number of shortcomings would be lesser. When there was an alliance like this, it was easier for them to compete against other great teachers.One must know that for great teachers, regardless of their increase in realms or deeper research into secondary occupations, both required a great amount of resources. At the very least, they should never lack money.For a great teacher group of great power, they wouldn\u2019t lack any resources.\u201cPlease allow me to formally introduce myself. My name is Yue Rongbo, I\u2019m from the Song Country of the Jing Province, and I\u2019m a 4-star great teacher. Three months ago, I was headhunted by Headmaster Cao of the Myriad Daos Academy of Jinling City, and I obtained the position of the year\u2019s head.\u201dYue Rongbo spoke frankly with assurance. His square face was calm and composed, exhibiting the graceful bearing of a 4-star great teacher.\u201cAh!\u201dThere was no need to hear about the position. Just the title of a 4-star great teacher was sufficient to cause Lu Zhiruo to exclaim in shock. To her, a 4-star great teacher was an existence she had to admire.And such an existence was formally headhunting her own teacher now\u2026\u201cTeacher Sun is so awesome!\u201d Lu Zhiruo felt a little agitated. \u201cI\u2019m truly too fortunate that I was able to acknowledge him as my master.\u201dDing!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +30.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo. Friendly (143/1,000).An Xinhui who was hiding behind a mulberry tree was extremely stunned. What had Sun Mo done exactly? Why was he held in such high regard by Yue Rongbo?However, very soon after, An Xinhui felt a huge sense of pressure.\u2018D\u2019 grade and \u2018C\u2019 grade schools didn\u2019t have enough attractiveness for 4-star great teachers. Hence, if one wanted to headhunt them, one had to spend an extremely great price. Headmaster Cao of the Myriad Daos Academy had invested so much capital into this. In that case, didn\u2019t that mean that the Central Province Academy would always be suppressed to the extent where they would never overturn the situation?Yue Rongbo stared at Sun Mo and discovered that there were no fluctuations in his expression. Sun Mo was so calm like he was facing the canteen aunty asking him if he wanted to eat porridge or something else for breakfast. This made him admire Sun Mo even more.In the past when he headhunted 6 teachers, all of them pretended to be calm and composed upon learning his identity. Yet, they weren\u2019t able to conceal the excitement and agitation in their hearts.Being able to be chosen by a 4-star teacher was a type of recognition and praise. If word of this spread out, everyone would envy them for a long time.Through Divine Sight, Sun Mo already knew that Yue Rongbo was a 4-star teacher. Hence, why would he be surprised now?Naturally, the most important thing was that Sun Mo just arrived in this world, and he still hadn\u2019t fully understood the weight of a 4-star great teacher. Also, the sounds of the system notifications were ringing in his ear.Ding!\u201cCongratulations. The prestige connection between you and Lu Zhiruo reached \u2018Friendly\u2019. Reward: 1 black-iron treasure chest. Continue to work hard.\u201dA shiny metallic treasure chest appeared before Sun Mo. This was naturally better looking than Yue Rongbo\u2019s square face.\u201cI initially came to this school to headhunt Liu Mubai and inspect Gu Xiuxun. But I think you are more outstanding than them.\u201dYue Rongbo directly looked into Sun Mo\u2019s eyes.\u201cYou are praising me too much.\u201dSun Mo understood his own weightage.\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t be unduly humble. In terms of teaching ability, you might be inferior to Liu Mubai and Gu Xiuxun. However, I admire your character very much.\u201dThis was the sixth sense honed through the many years of experience as a great teacher.\u201cThank you!\u201dSun Mo laughed lightly while musing in his heart that no matter what, he was still someone who had six years of experience as a teacher-in-charge. In order to better educate the students and form a better relationship with them, the number of books he had bought cost over several thousand dollars in total. Psychological books, philosophy books, and there were even over ten books about acting skills.No.2 High School was a prominent school. Sun Mo didn\u2019t simply depend on his teaching abilities to get a main role within six years.\u201cI wish to invite you to join my group. There\u2019s no need for any test, and you can directly obtain a formal teacher\u2019s contract of the Myriad Daos Academy. Also, I will promise to give you the various resources you need to help you level up.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYue Rongbo stated his price. Since he wanted to poach someone over, he had to be willing to spend.Sun Mo fell silent because he could sense Yue Rongbo\u2019s sincerity. In that case, should he leave?To a teacher-in-charge with six years of experience, they would all understand the importance of having a superior that appreciated and guided them.\u201cSun Mo!\u201dAn Xinhui couldn\u2019t sit still any longer. If she put herself in Sun Mo\u2019s shoes, her heart would also be moved by this condition. Hence, she walked out from behind the mulberry tree and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55: First Meeting with An XinhuiThe sudden sound of someone speaking caused Sun Mo and the two others to turn their heads.Under the orange glow of the setting sun, An Xinhui stood in the forest. The night wind that gusted over from the lake caused the corners of her robes to flutter.Due to over-exhaustion, An Xinhui\u2019s skin was pale and her figure was a little skinny. However, her gaze was as sharp as ever.Sun Mo smiled. This was the look of a successful career woman.The sharpness in An Xinhui\u2019s eyes flashed and disappeared. After that, her large eyes where the shades of white and black were distinct became filled with gentleness. She automatically showed approachability, causing people who looked at her to feel an extremely favorable impression of her.The first reaction of Lu Zhiruo when she saw Yue Rongbo was fear and respect. And now when she saw An Xinhui, it was one of amicability. She felt like she had met an elder female neighbor who was smiling at her gently, asking her if she wanted to eat pineapple sweets together!\u201cHow classy!\u201dSun Mo involuntarily praised.An Xinhui\u2019s beauty would make it so that if she entered the entertainment industry, she wouldn\u2019t need acting skills and only needed to be a vase. Many males would be happy enough to reach in their wallets to purchase movie tickets just for a glance at her. Even if they needed to pee, they would rather hold it in than to miss any of her scenes.Her demeanor was even more outstanding. It was those types of demeanors that would cause people to forget her beauty and notice her demeanor.Simply speaking, An Xinhui\u2019s aura was immensely strong.One must know that Yue Rongbo was a 4-star teacher, and his aura was very strong too. But when An Xinhui appeared, it was like the voice of the guest overwhelmed that of the host. It caused everyone to involuntarily pay attention to only her.An Xinhui no longer spoke. She looked at Sun Mo, surveying this childhood sweetheart of hers whom she had not met for many years.He was much taller. Maybe it was because he just graduated, but she could still see the underripe look on his face. His fingers were lanky, and his nails were clean. He wore the light-blue robe for intern teachers and there were no creases on it. Just from a look, she could tell that he was a man that cared about details.\u201cHeadmaster An!\u201dSun Mo spoke. His lips curled lightly as a fresh, sunshine-like aura instantly emitted forth.\u201cAh, he must have practiced this smile for 6 months or more!\u201dAn Xinhui guessed. She couldn\u2019t control it and felt like laughing, but the expression on her face didn\u2019t change.Yue Rongbo was naturally acquainted with An Xinhui. Hence, his brows began to furrow.There were no solutions to this. When it came to the snatching of talented men, a beautiful great teacher had a natural advantage. In addition, An Xinhui was extremely famous and had several halos of glory.Other than her great teacher\u2019s level being inferior to him and the Central Province Academy had declined and was insufficiently qualified, An Xinhui had no other shortcomings.\u201cI hope Sun Mo isn\u2019t a shallow man who wouldn\u2019t leave just because of a beautiful woman.\u201dYue Rongbo muttered to himself. After that, he stepped forth and started his attack. \u201cHeadmaster An is so idle. Why don\u2019t you enjoy the scenery together with us?\u201dYue Rongbo\u2019s words sounded relaxed but if An Xinhui\u2019s reply was incautious, she would be expressing a negative image where she wasn\u2019t serious about her work. One must know that today was still the student recruitment meet. The busiest person should be the headmaster.\u201cMy teacher is about to be poached away. I naturally have to come and stop it!\u201dYet, An Xinhui couldn\u2019t be bothered to cross swords verbally. She went straight to the point.Yue Rongbo frowned. An Xinhui was truly like what the rumors said, she wasn\u2019t easy to deal with. No wonder Headmaster Cao of the Myriad Daos Academy had to employ him.According to what Headmaster Cao said, if it wasn\u2019t for An Xinhui taking over the Central Province Academy, this school would have long since been removed from the list due to his suppression, vanishing into history.\u201cHehe, the Central Academy Province has already declined. You guys are ranked at the bottom of the \u2018D\u2019 grade. After this year\u2019s league tournament concludes, if you guys are still at the bottom, your school would directly be removed from the list. Rather than letting Teacher Sun waste his talent here, why don\u2019t you let him follow me to the Myriad Daos Academy, creating brand new heaven and earth there?\u201dYue Rongbo retaliated. At the same time, he cast a glance at Sun Mo.An Xinhui\u2019s words, be it whether they were sincere or not, had expressed her high regard for Sun Mo and her recognition for him. If it was another guy here instead of Sun Mo, that person would surely feel a little proud and complacent. After all, he had obtained the high regard of a beautiful headmaster.However, Yue Rongbo discovered that Sun Mo\u2019s expression was so calm that it was as though they were the canteen aunties asking him what he wanted for breakfast. There were no fluctuations at all.Sun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. Yue Rongbo\u2019s words were truly filled with killing intent.\u201cBottom-ranked? Removed from the list? Sir, as a 4-star great teacher and an extremely popular character in the great teacher circle, you didn\u2019t want to go to any of the \u2018A\u2019 grade schools or one of the Nine Greats. Weren\u2019t you headhunted by Headmaster Cao to deal with my Central Province Academy?\u201dAn Xinhui retorted sarcastically.\u201cHaha, Headmaster Cao overestimates your Central Academy Province too much.\u201dYue Rongbo laughed loudly. Although the truth was this, he would not admit to it.\u201cSpeaking of creating brand new heaven and earth, I remember that Headmaster Cao\u2019s greatest wish is to make the Myriad Daos Academy rise to the \u2018A\u2019 grade. As for my Central Province Academy, our greatest wish is to return to the rankings of the Nine Greats.\u201dAn Xinhui spoke frankly with assurance, \u201cIs there anything more legendary than leading a school that has declined back into the ranks of the Nine Greats?\u201d\u201cHow awesome!\u201dYue Rongbo silently praised. An Xinhui\u2019s debating skills were very outstanding. Also, when she was speaking, her points were clear and arranged properly. She involuntary shifted the topic toward an area that was advantageous for her.\u201cIf Sun Mo could achieve this point, he would definitely leave behind a heavy brushstroke in the history of the great teacher circle. His statue would also stand tall and upright in the school, and he would be revered by students of countless generations.An Xinhui stated.\u201cVery grand ambitions. But the prerequisite is that it must be possible to accomplish!\u201dYue Rongbo sneered. He didn\u2019t dare to think about such a thing.\u201cOh? Are you saying you don\u2019t believe in Sun Mo?\u201dAn Xinhui immediately found a loophole and launched her attack.\u201cEh!\u201dYue Rongbo started, silently musing that things looked bad. However, he also wasn\u2019t easy to deal with. He shifted the topic. \u201cTeacher Sun, as long as you are willing to join my group, you will obtain a large amount of resources. Firstly, let\u2019s talk about salary. No matter how much Headmaster An is offering, I will give you three times that.\u201dAfter his words rang out, An Xinhui felt her heart pounding.Let alone a great teacher, for an ordinary person working a job, it was precisely because of two reasons. The first was due to dreams and ambitions, the second was to earn a large amount of money.Now, Yue Rongbo wasn\u2019t simply talking about ambitions, he was willing to pay a high sum too. It was really hard for An Xinhui to handle this!\u201cThree times the salary? You are regarding him so highly?\u201dAn Xinhui had no way to match the price. She was very poor.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s only natural. For a person that I, Yue Rongbo, regard highly, he is definitely worth this amount. Why? Can Headmaster An not follow?\u201dYue Rongbo continued to push.This was his confidence. Although An Xinhui was a headmaster, even if the Central Province Academy had no in-fighting and she was the sole person in charge, she wouldn\u2019t dare to recklessly increase Sun Mo\u2019s salary. If not, what would the other teachers think?\u201cTeacher Yue, you\u2019ve already spoken that your current position is the year\u2019s head. How is it possible that you have such great authority?\u201dAn Xinhui doubted.\u201cHaha, you are a headmaster. You should know that it isn\u2019t so easy for a school to be flexible. However, Headmaster Cao has already settled the dissidents. In less than a month, I will become the vice headmaster and have a portion of funds that I can allocate according to my will.\u201dYue Rongbo looked directly at An Xinhui while silently saying that she was still too young.An Xinhui fell into silence, she could feel extremely great pressure. That was right, if Headmaster Cao wanted to headhunt a 4-star great teacher, he definitely had to pay a huge price. If not, why would Yue Rongbo \u2013 someone who had better choices available to him \u2013 join the Myriad Daos Academy?\u201cWow, what\u2019s this? They are vying for a teacher?\u201dLu Zhiruo, who was watching at the side, was so nervous that her little hands were tugging at her shirt. Her palms were filled with sweat. One was a 4-star teacher, the other was the headmaster of the Central Province Academy. These two major characters were actually vying for Teacher Sun?\u201dLu Zhiruo gazed at Sun Mo with worship in her eyes.Teacher Sun, you are so awesome!Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +30.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo. Friendly (173/1,000).(Oioi, is it that you want to become my fan?)Upon hearing the system\u2019s notification, Sun Mo involuntarily stretched out his hand and patted Lu Zhiruo on her head.Ah!Lu Zhiruo instantly leaned her head to the side. Her eyes narrowed like she was a siamese cat who was enjoying Sun Mo\u2019s patting.\u201cTeacher Sun, currently the Central Province Academy is besieged with internal and external troubles. Zhang Hanfu and Wang Su weren\u2019t easy to deal with. Also, with your relationship as An Xinhui\u2019s fiance, they would definitely suppress you. Even if you are overflowing with talent, don\u2019t even think about displaying it. Why not join my group? Let\u2019s create the number one great teacher group under the heavens together.\u201dYue Rongbo stretched out his right hand. He stared at Sun Mo with sincerity in his gaze.An Xinhui could only be silent. Yue Rongbo\u2019s words were all true. He also considered the aspects of \u2018ambitions\u2019 and \u2018salary\u2019 for Sun Mo. This was already an extremely sincere offer.If it was some other teachers, they might even be filled with so much gratefulness that they would thank him while shedding tears, speaking so many words of gratitude like they wanted to offer their lives in sacrifice.However, An Xinhui was someone with a pure heart and mind. How would she give up so easily? She didn\u2019t say anything, but her eyes looked toward Sun Mo.There was hope, trepidation, and a trace of pitifulness in it. This gaze was enough to stir up the protective desire of any men.\u201cAiya! An Xinhui, you actually used such a move!\u201dYue Rongbo was so angered that he almost coughed out blood. However, he still maintained the graceful bearing of a great teacher. He couldn\u2019t possibly argue with a woman over this, right? In any case, even if he wanted to argue, he had no solutions to do so. He couldn\u2019t possibly use the same gaze to look at Sun Mo.Ai, he was really infuriated. If he knew he would run into An Xinhui today, he would also pull a few beautiful teachers along to help him out. With so many beautiful teachers, he didn\u2019t believe that a young and vigorous man like Sun Mo would be able to withstand his offer.Lu Zhiruo was even more nervous. No matter where her teacher went, she would definitely follow him all the way.Sun Mo glanced at Yue Rongbo\u2019s hand. After that, he swung his hand and slammed it onto the ground before he began to clap.\u201cBrother Yue, I thank you for your appreciation. However, I have a shortcoming. Wherever I suffer losses, I definitely have to earn back my capital at that place. There are so many people here who call me a guy that sponges off a woman. If you were me, how would you handle it?\u201dSun Mo smiled as he asked.\u201cHow would you handle it?\u201dYue Rongbo counterasked.\u201cI will naturally snatch all their rice bowls and make sure they don\u2019t have any rice to eat!\u201d Sun Mo smiled. His gaze was filled with sincerity as he looked at Yue Rongbo. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry to have to let down Brother Yue\u2019s appreciation of me.\u201dSun Mo was sincerely apologizing. This was because he could sense the high regard Yue Rongbo had for him. This caused him to be reminded of his old headmaster in his previous world who had also recognized his worth and chosen to employ him, helping him to fend off the pressure, letting him become a teacher-in-charge, and allowing him to display his brilliance.\u201cDon\u2019t assume this was just a chance. For some people, they wouldn\u2019t have such a chance in their entire lives.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2013\u2013\u2013Note:Being a vase = Just have to look pretty and do nothingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56: Super MissionYue Rongbo stared attentively at Sun Mo. Although he was rejected, he didn\u2019t become angry from embarrassment. In fact, he admired Sun Mo\u2019s character instead.It\u2019s true. Since they say that I sponge off women, I will snatch all their rice bowls then.These words were truly tyrannical!An Xinhui could no longer continue acting when she heard this. She didn\u2019t expect the reason for Sun Mo\u2019s rejection would be this.\u201cSun Mo?\u201dShe muttered her childhood sweetheart\u2019s name silently. A trace of shock appeared in An Xinhui\u2019s beautiful eyes. In the end, the emotions in her eyes transformed into admiration. She didn\u2019t expect that this young kid who used to follow behind her had finally grown up.\u201cWow, Teacher Sun is so tyrannical!\u201dLu Zhiruo agitatedly wanted to clap.If he left like this, those who didn\u2019t know Sun Mo might misunderstand and thought he was slinking away with his tail between his legs. So, if he wanted to leave, he had to slap the faces of those who looked down on him first before he left.The sun had almost set completely, but the sun wouldn\u2019t vanish. It set now so it could glow even more resplendently tomorrow morning.\u201cI understand you!\u201dYue Rongbo took his hand back. \u201cHowever, after hearing your words, I don\u2019t want to give up even more. Sun Mo, the door to the Myriad Daos Academy will always be open to you. As long as you are willing to come over, no matter what requests you have, it won\u2019t be a problem. In that case, farewell!\u201dYue Rongbo nodded to An Xinhui before he turned to depart.Sun Mo didn\u2019t say anything. An Xinhui also didn\u2019t know what to say. Hence, the atmosphere was a little awkward now.\u201cWhat should I do? Should I act like when I was little and call her elder sister An Xinhui? Or should I call her my wife? But would I be beaten to death if I call her that?\u201dSun Mo self-mocked. Although his original self had already died. His memories still contained a deep longing for An Xinhui. Hence, Sun Mo could feel his heart pounding rapidly now.\u201cLittle Momo!\u201dAn Xinhui didn\u2019t like such an atmosphere. Hence, she wanted to break the awkwardness. However, the moment she spoke, she called out Sun Mo\u2019s nickname when he was young.\u201cWhat the hell is \u2018Little Momo\u2019?\u201dSun Mo was astonished. This was so embarrassing!\u201cMn?\u201dAn Xinhui started. After that, she lifted her hand and patted Sun Mo\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhy? Because you have grown up, you don\u2019t want to recognize me as an elder sister anymore?\u201dAfter saying this and doing the action she used to do when they were young, An Xinhui suddenly laughed. This wasn\u2019t an act. It was a smile from the bottom of her heart because she recalled those wonderful times during their childhood.Sun Mo didn\u2019t know what to say. He could only continue to smile.\u201cSun Mo, thank you for staying behind.\u201d After An Xinhui laughed, her tone became solemn and she changed the way she addressed him. \u201cHow about it? Please work with me to improve this school, allowing it to return to the ranks of the Nine Greats, alright?\u201d\u201cDo you believe I can do it?\u201d Sun Mo counter-asked.\u201cAs long as you believed so, you will definitely be able to.\u201dAn Xinhui engaged in sophistry.\u201cSister An, your words are very cunning.\u201dSun Mo teased her. If An Xinhui truly believed he could help the Central Province Academy to return to the peak of the famous schools in the Nine Provinces, she must be retarded.An Xinhui was very busy. After exchanging a few more sentences, she bid Sun Mo farewell and departed.Sun Mo stood at the side of the Sorrowless Lake as he stared at the campus where the night was about to fall. His expression was complicated. \u201cSystem, can I still return home?\u201d\u201cIf you pass the test of the Absolute Great Teacher System, you can naturally return home to your world!\u201dThe system gave an answer, causing Sun Mo\u2019s spirit to stir.\u201cHow do I pass the test?\u201d\u201cComplete all the various missions the system issues!\u201dThe system\u2019s explanation was simple and concise.\u201cThat\u2019s no different than not giving an answer.\u201dSun Mo furrowed his brows so hard they could crush a crab.\u201cIn that case, set a small target first. In one year, you have to help the Central Province Academy obtain one of the top three rankings in the \u2018D\u2019 grade league tournament and successfully rise to the \u2018C\u2019 grade.\u201dThe system suggested.\u201cAre you joking?\u201dIn a year, he wouldn\u2019t have a stable footing in the school yet. From the meaning of Yue Rongbo\u2019s words, the Central Province Academy had two \u2018BOSSES\u2019 named Zhang Hanfu and Wang Su.Ding!\u201cMission issued: Within a year, help the Central Province Academy gain one of the top five rankings in the \u2018D\u2019 grade league tournament. Reward: 3 diamond treasure chest.\u201dVery good, the requirements were relaxed by two spots. But what was the use of this? Upon seeing the three diamond treasure chest rewards, he already knew how difficult this mission was.Sun Mo wanted to hit someone the moment he heard about this mission.\u201cYou should be content. If it wasn\u2019t for me stopping it, you might have been given the mission of making the Central Province Academy rise back to the rankings of the Nine Greats.\u201dThe system expressed, but it had something it didn\u2019t tell Sun Mo.It was impossible for Sun Mo to leave the Central Province Academy and join Yue Rongbo\u2019s great teacher group. The system would prevent it for sure.If Sun Mo left, he would be given a death punishment and would be erased.Back in his world, Sun Mo had been pushed by the female student Zhou Miao into the lake. He didn\u2019t die, but somehow \u2018crossed-over\u2019 to the Jinling City of Tang Country. The reason for his crossover was precisely because of the Central Province Academy.If this academy was removed from the list of famous schools and abolished, Sun Mo would instantly die!Naturally, the system didn\u2019t feel the need to tell Sun Mo about this.\u201cAlright, alright, alright! You are the great benefactor!\u201dSun Mo pointed a middle-finger at the system. He called out to Lu Zhiruo and they went to the canteen for their meals.Lu Zhiruo wasn\u2019t a picky eater and ate whatever Sun Mo ordered. It was just that after a few meals, she felt a little embarrassed because Sun Mo had never asked her to pay before.\u201cJust eat when I tell you to eat!\u201dIn Sun Mo\u2019s eyes, Lu Zhiruo was still a child. How could he ask her to go dutch? Hence, even if he didn\u2019t have enough savings, he had to persist all the way to the end.Dinner was steamed rice, two dishes of seasonal vegetables, and a plate of beef. The beef was for Lu Zhiruo to supplement her body.Honestly speaking, the large breasts of this papaya girl made her uniform look like it was on the verge of exploding. Sun Mo was afraid that if she continued to nourish and supplement her body, her large bre*sts would become super bre*sts.\u201cMn!\u201dLu Zhiruo lowered her head and continued eating. Occasionally, she would use her chopsticks and pick up large pieces of meat, only to place them in Sun Mo\u2019s bowl. She was so obedient like a cat raised by a family.After finishing the meal, Sun Mo patted Lu Zhiruo on the head and told her to return to the warehouse where she was staying temporarily. As for himself, he headed back in the direction of his dorm while opening the iron-black treasure chest he had obtained during the afternoon.Ding!\u2018Congratulations, you obtained a fragmented map (\u2155). The map will reveal a certain terrain. If you want the complete layout, you have to obtain the other four pieces of the map.\u201dThe system\u2019s notification was filled with an ancient aura.Sun Mo glanced at it. This fragmented map was made from beast skin. The tactile feel wasn\u2019t bad, but the content of the map was indistinct. There was basically no way to distinguish it.\u201cIs there a need to be so mysterious?\u201dSun Mo was instantly unhappy. From the meaning of the notification, it meant that if he wanted to see the content, he had to get all five pieces of the map? (Do you think this is Dragon Ball?)\u201cThe items given out as rewards would all have value.\u201dThe system declared.\u201cIncluding the clumps of soil I obtained every day from the lucky treasure chests?\u201dSun Mo counter-asked.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe system suddenly fell silent. It wanted to ask if Sun Mo could just chat cheerfully?Who knew when he would be able to get the four remaining pieces of the map. Hence, Sun Mo placed the map into the black-colored storage cabinet.In the dorm, the atmosphere was oppressive.When Sun Mo saw that Yuan Feng\u2019s bed was empty, he started for a while and didn\u2019t pay any more attention to that.Yuan Feng took the initiative to resign. Now, it was still the graduation period, and it was easier for him to find other schools to join. If he was persuaded to leave by Headmaster An or fired, it would be much more difficult if he wanted to look for another school. This was because no schools would want to accept a teacher with stains in their reputation. Hence, Yuan Feng quickly resigned and fled before Jin Mujie reported to An Xinhui.Ludi sat at the side of the table and was plucking the fur from a plate of pig trotters. When he saw Sun Mo had returned, he initially wanted to ask if Sun Mo knew where Yuan Feng was. But after glancing at Zhang Sheng, he decided to endure the impulse.Zhang Sheng wasn\u2019t fond of Sun Mo. If Ludi spoke to him, Zhang Sheng would definitely be unhappy.Sigh, pig trotters were still the best. No matter how smart or stupid you were, it would do its best to fill your stomach.When he thought of this, Ludi began to pluck the fur even more gently.Zhang Sheng lay on his bed, stewing in anger.The student recruitment meet had lasted for two days, but he hadn\u2019t even recruited a single student yet. Such an abysmal result directly dealt a blow to this conceited intern teacher. If this \u2018fist\u2019 had corporeal form, he would not only get a nosebleed, but quite a few of his teeth would also be shattered.Luckily, Zhang Sheng had an agreement with three students. Once he became a substitute teacher, after two months of probation, they would officially acknowledge him as their master.Such a method was commonly seen in school. A period of two months was sufficient for the students and teacher to mutually understand each other. If everyone was satisfied, they would proceed with the master-student ceremony. If not, they would simply part without any hard feelings.Naturally, because of how respected teachers were in the nine provinces. Such things couldn\u2019t be done in plain sight, and these would all be discussed privately.\u201cHmph, when I become famous, you guys better kowtow until your heads bleed if you want to become my disciples.\u201dZhang Sheng mumbled to himself. After he cast a glance at Sun Mo, his mood became much better. This fool definitely hadn\u2019t recruited a student. However, there were rumors spreading saying that Sun Mo had recruited Xuanyuan Po. These people truly didn\u2019t have brains. Xuanyuan Po didn\u2019t even hold Liu Mubai in high regard. How would he have chosen Sun Mo?Even if one took ten thousand steps back, even if Liu Mubai wanted Xuanyuan Po, Sun Mo wouldn\u2019t have a chance. For a good seedling like Xuanyuan Po, he was even worth a 1-star great teacher rolling up their sleeves to snatch him.One must know that one of the hard conditions to become a 2-star teacher was for one\u2019s personal disciple to be ranked in the Greencloud Rankings. Hence, if one couldn\u2019t recruit students with extraordinary aptitudes, it would mean that they had to be stuck as 1-star great teachers forever.\u2026The cries of birds could be heard in the early morning.Zhang Sheng woke up very early. He saw Ludi rubbing his eyes, struggling to get up the bed while Sun Mo was still sleeping. Zhang Sheng\u2019s lips involuntarily curled up into a smile filled with superiority.If one wanted to be more successful than the others, they had to pay 10x more effort in comparison. Sun Mo was so lazy, he didn\u2019t even need to dream about recruiting five students in his entire life. He would never successfully become an official teacher.\u201cZhang Sheng, work hard! You will definitely be able to recruit five students today!\u201dZhang Sheng encouraged himself. He was prepared to stroll about the office building\u2019s surroundings and \u2018encounter\u2019 An Xinhui. He heard that the headmaster had been extremely busy from morning until night during these few days and had decided to stay in the office.(If she saw me being so hardworking, she would definitely view me in a new favorable light, right?\u2019When Zhang Sheng thought of this, he involuntarily smiled. After that, he pushed open the door and immediately retracted his smile. His expression became one of seriousness.There was a girl currently sitting with her back against the wall. Her hands hugged her knees as she napped. Because of this action, the two bre*sts so large that they resembled papayas were squeezed until they almost changed forms. Her clothes were so tight that they almost burst. It felt like her clothes might tear at any moment.Upon hearing the sound of a door opening, the girl inclined her head in a daze.\u201cTruly fresh and pure!\u201dZhang Sheng praised silently. This little lady in green had such pure and innocent eyes. There were no impurities within, and he could tell with a single glance that she was inexperienced in society. She hadn\u2019t been tainted by the world yet.(Speaking of which, could she have come here because she heard of my name? Did she want to take me as her master?)Just as Zhang Sheng was preparing to speak, the papaya girl glanced at him and continued to nap.\u201cDamn, Sun Mo do you still want face or not? Why are you hiring actors every few days to brush up your reputation?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Sheng inclined his neck and was as proud as a swan. When he walked past Lu Zhiruo, he was filled with silent anticipation in his heart that this girl might be awed by his elegant manner.\u201cTeacher!\u201dThe girl suddenly called out.Zhang Sheng quivered instantly. As expected, one should always have dreams. He revealed the smile that he had been practicing privately for six months as he turned his head and spoke.\u201cStudent, you are calling for me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She could\u2019ve just continued talking in her dreams, must she have shouted \u2018teacher\u2019?It was ridiculous! It got him excited for nothing.Zhang Sheng stared at Lu Zhiruo while dragging his footsteps down the stairs, but until the end, she didn\u2019t have any intention of acknowledging him as her master.\u201cHumph! One day, even if you were to acknowledge me as your master, I will not agree to it!\u201dZhang Sheng cursed.(I must also recruit a female student with bigger breasts than this papaya girl!)\u2026Sun Mo went out and saw Lu Zhiruo sleeping. Her saliva was almost flowing out.\u201cCough cough!\u201dSun Mo coughed and pinned the wooden blade on his left waist.When Lu Zhiruo heard the sounds, she jumped up immediately with a bow and greeted, \u201cTeacher, good morning!\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Sun Mo nodded his head. \u201cLet\u2019s go and eat!\u201dHence, Sun Mo walked in front with Lu Zhirou tagging behind like a big-breasted little tail. They headed toward the canteen.Their usual breakfast consisted of porridge, egg chives buns, as well as a small plate of salted vegetables. Lu Zhiruo\u2019s meal was more sumptuous as it had two more eggs.Lu Zhiruo peeled off the eggshells and passed it to Sun Mo first.\u201cI bought it for you.\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t eat.\u201cBurp!\u201dLu Zhiruo was very obedient compared to Li Ziqi, who would have started a bout of argument. This papaya girl would lower her head while eating and was always following Sun Mo\u2019s instructions.Sun Mo checked for a bit. The lucky treasure chests that he would get every midnight were lying inside the black-colored storage cabinet quietly. He planned to open them all once the number reached 18, an auspicious number.Ding!\u201cCongratulations! You have won your first match against another teacher. You achieved an accomplishment \u2018defeated a teacher for the first time\u2019, and the prize is one golden treasure chest.\u201dSystem\u2019s notification sound rang abruptly.Sun Mo extended his hand. Touching Lu Zhiruo\u2019s head, he spoke calmly,\u201cOpen it!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s tone had no sense of urgency, as though he was a veteran who had passed the flower bushes countless times. Those black fungi had no way of raising his excitement anymore.\u201cThis is a golden treasure chest, why aren\u2019t you excited?\u201dThe system was curious.\u201cCan the excitement increase my chance of getting a peak-grade item?\u201d Sun Mo replied.\u201cIt can\u2019t!\u201dThe system felt that Sun Mo was thinking too much.\u201cThen why should I be excited?\u201dSun Mo took a small sip, enjoying the porridge\u2019s nice temperature. Then, he ate some salted vegetables to enhance the great taste, how yummy!The system was silent, having not meant it that way. But Sun Mo\u2019s words seemed to make sense, it couldn\u2019t even retaliate!\u201cStop dilly-dallying, open the box!\u201dSun Mo was worried that if they continued talking, the luck he had received from the papaya girl\u2019s body would disappear.The treasure chest disappeared and a ray of golden light burst in the air, leaving behind a piece of stone tablet that was shaped like a mahjong tile but bigger. It was illuminating rays of bronze-colored light.On the stone tablet, there were carvings of totems that could not be understood by humans, giving off a mysterious vibe.\u201cCongratulations, you have received \u2018time emblem\u2019. After using it, one of your skills will seem to have endured ten years of cultivation. The proficiency index will be increased by one grade.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s eyes brightened after reading the introduction, so he decided to add an egg to his porridge.This must be some good item, probably costing a thousand favorable impression points if sold at the shopping store.\u201cWhich skill should I use it on?\u201dSun Mo did a self-examination. Currently, the cultivation arts he knew were Grand Universe Formless Divine Art, which he had just begun practicing, and Immemorial Vairocana, proficiency index: elementary.The rest were grandmaster-grade Divine Sight, expert-grade Circulation Technique, and grandmaster-grade Muscleforge Technique.He also had three great teacher halos, namely \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019, \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019, as well as an exclusive \u2018Soul Imprint\u2019. They were all of elementary grade.\u201cHost, what do you think?\u201dThe system asked.\u201cIf you have a brain, you will know how to choose!\u201dSun Mo replied ruthlessly.The system became silent instantly, too angry to talk.Divine Sight, Circulation Technique, Muscleforge Technique, they were all of sufficient usage.\u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 as well as \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019, both had great effects. Although he had never used \u2018Soul Imprint\u2019 before, he knew it wouldn\u2019t be too shabby.By increasing the proficiency index, the three great teacher halos could be sustained for a longer period. Its effect would be increased and there would be a greater enveloping range. Even if he were to be formally employed into the faculty, he would only have 5 students. He should be able to make do with these halos for the time being.As for cultivation arts, Immemorial Vairocana could copy random cultivation arts of the opponent\u2019s, and once it was increased by another grade, it would be able to target a specific type of cultivation art.Sun Mo decided to give up on upgrading it after a lot of consideration. Even if he was able to copy a specific type of cultivation art from his opponent, it wouldn\u2019t be very useful. The crucial factor was because Immemorial Vairocana was exclusively owned by him, the mentioned effect had not been verified. As for Grand Universe Formless Divine Art, it was one of the best cultivation arts in this world. Numerous people had hoped to learn this cultivation art, so one could imagine just how great it was.\u2018Grand Universe Formless Divine Art level 2, Invulnerable Glaze Golden Body. It would greatly increase your ability to withstand damage.\u2019\u2018If you want to learn your opponent\u2019s cultivation art, you must experience their attacks. Only once you have withstood them all will you be able to grasp its essence.\u2019\u2018Level 3: copy, you are now able to imitate your opponent\u2019s moves, exerting similar powers and skills.\u2019Looking at the introduction of this saint-tier cultivation art, Sun Mo had decided on it.In the nine provinces, great martial artists were treated with respect. Hence, even though great teachers held different occupations, they still regarded teaching martial arts with the highest form of respect. Sun Mo felt that he should first increase his fighting power.Last time, the competition\u2019s content was on their capability to coach the students. But what if Sun Mo was challenged to a fight during the next round\u2019s competition, what would happen if he were to be killed or disabled by his opponent?Sun Mo had not forgotten that because of An Xinhui, many male teachers felt as though that Sun Mo had stolen their household\u2019s rice from them. They couldn\u2019t wait to punish him!Yes, it would definitely be correct to increase his fighting power.Sun Mo found an excuse and went to the toilet. While there was no one, he took out the time emblem and kneaded it into pieces.Piak!Bronze rays of light sputtered out and landed onto Sun Mo\u2019s body, leaving a layer of green fluorescent on him.Sun Mo almost burst into vulgarities, couldn\u2019t it have used another color instead of green?However, the effect felt extraordinarily good. He could feel the warmth on his body, with many images pertaining to the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art emerging in his mind.Time flew, and it felt as though ten years had passed.Ding.\u201cCongratulations, Grand Universe Formless Divine Art level 1\u2019s proficiency index has been increased to grandmaster-grade. Level 2 Invulnerable Golden Glaze Body has been increased to expert-grade. Please continue to improve.\u201dThe system\u2019s monotonous notification sound rang.\u201cIs my aptitude that bad?\u201dSun Mo felt that he should at least reach level 3!\u201cIf someone reached the grandmaster-grade in any skill, it would mean that they had achieved mastery in it and would be addressed as a Grandmaster. If you don\u2019t spend more time building a solid foundation, then your path of cultivation will soon come to an end.\u201dSystem explained, \u201cThis cultivation art is a saint-tier one, it\u2019s naturally hard to practice.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Sun Mo expressed his understanding, \u201cHow many favorable impression points do I have now?\u201d(I should just go with level 2 then. Since my favorable impression points have increased by a bit, I could use the points to buy a new time emblem and increase the art to level 3 straight away.)\u201c983!\u201dThe system replied succinctly, \u201cPlease continue to improve!\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201dSun Mo thought for a bit. The majority of the points were contributed by honest man Qi Shengjia and papaya girl Lu Zhiruo. Hence, even though Lu Zhiruo\u2019s potential value was extremely low, she could still be of use.Moreover, even if she was useless and unable to contribute favorable impression points, she had a pair of massive breasts! Massive breasts brought justice, power, popularity, love, and contribution!Of course, the most important thing was how massive breasts increased his luck. Sun Mo could feel every time he touched the papaya girl\u2019s head before opening the treasure chest, the chances of him getting a peak-grade item would be greatly increased.Sun Mo stopped letting his thoughts run wild. After calming his energy, he focused his attention on practicing his cultivation art.Buzz!Faint golden-colored runes immediately began to appear on Sun Mo\u2019s complexion, and they seemed abstruse and mysterious. They were even illuminating a weak but faint fluorescent, making him look more sacred and divine.\u201cWhat is this? It brought along the power of blinding someone\u2019s eyes?\u201dSun Mo was speechless, but at least they weren\u2019t any nonsensical forms of runes. If they appeared to be something like a left Azure Dragon and a right White Tiger, he\u2019d rather not have it.Sun Mo held his fists, walked near the wall, and slammed it.Bang!Cracks shaped like spider webs started to extend on the wall. However, Sun Mo\u2019s hands didn\u2019t feel any sense of pain. If he were to do this in the toilet of No. 2 High School, his finger joints would have been swollen.Invulnerable Glaze Golden Body, it indeed had some extraordinary aspects.Sun Mo immediately brought Lu Zhiruo to the combat strength dojo. He found a combat strength bronze man and started throwing punches.Bang Bang Bang!As Sun Mo\u2019s fists were launched one after another, he could feel the gradually increasing pain. After throwing a punch with all his strength, the pain on his fists became unbearable.\u201cThe way you\u2019re testing is useless, Glaze Golden Body\u2019s defense will only increase accordingly with the state of the practitioner. However, it will never become invincible.\u201dThe system\u2019s words exposed Sun Mo\u2019s intentions. He had intended to make the Invulnerable Glaze Golden Body an \u2018invincible\u2019 skill that was immune to damage.Sorry, that would not be possible.\u201cI\u2019m not that greedy.\u201dSun Mo pouted. Anyway, the attacks from body-refinement and spirit-refinement realm cultivators wouldn\u2019t be able to break his Glaze Golden Body. If he were to coach students personally with this cultivation art, he would be very safe.Sun Mo was not afraid of getting injured. He had only wanted some dignity, as it would be very disgraceful to be injured by a student.\u201cTeacher, are you still going to practice?\u201dLu Zhiruo asked timidly.\u201cI\u2019ll try again!\u201dSun Mo started to use Immemorial Vairocana against the combat strength bronze man. Unfortunately, there was no feedback received.\u201cTeacher, you can only be formally employed after recruiting five students. You\u2019re still short of one, and today is already the last day of the student recruitment meet.\u201dLu Zhiruo felt it was necessary to remind Sun Mo.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDon\u2019t worry, as long as there\u2019s fate, I will definitely get a student.\u201dAfter Sun Mo spoke, someone continued, \u201cTeacher Sun is so calm!\u201dLu Zhiruo turned her head and saw a young man standing not far away. He was skinny and had a pale-looking complexion. Occasionally, there were a few sounds of him stifling his coughs.\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201dLu Zhiruo recognized this sickly person. \u201cWhat are you doing here? To acknowledge Teacher Sun as your master?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58: Looks of A Genius\u201cIf I dare to acknowledge Teacher Sun as my teacher, would you dare to accept me?\u201dTantai Yutang smiled in self-ridicule.There were basic requirements that teachers had when recruiting students. Although no one could really assess a person\u2019s aptitude, and they didn\u2019t have information on the students\u2019 background and experiences, they could do basic assessments from their bodies.If students wished to cultivate, they\u2019d need to at least reach the divine force realm. Not only would they need to have healthy bodies, but they also needed to be stronger than ordinary people. Otherwise, how would they be able to withstand the hardship of cultivation?Tantai Yutang had a sickly constitution. He kept on coughing, occasionally even coughing hints of blood. It was as though he would fall if a strong gust of wind were to blow.Given how weak he was, there\u2019d be no teachers who would accept him as their disciple, unless they were blind.\u201cIf you dare to acknowledge me, then I\u2019ll dare to accept!\u201dSun Mo replied then looked at this sickly person. All of his data immediately appeared next to him.He hadn\u2019t seen wrongly the other time. This person\u2019s potential value was really stated as being extremely high.He was of the same standards as Xuanyuan Po and Li Ziqi. During the three days of the student recruitment meet, Sun Mo had seen over 2,000 students. However, these three were the only students who had an \u2018extremely high\u2019 potential value.At the same time, the system also stated to not treat him in the same manner as one would toward a child. Otherwise, you\u2019d get it bad. This showed that although this young man looked harmless, he might secretly be a scheming person.\u201cHmmm?\u201d Tantai Yutang was stunned and he assessed Sun Mo. \u201cYou aren\u2019t afraid that trash like me will become a blemish on your path as a great teacher?\u201d\u201cI have the confidence of nurturing you into someone great.\u201dSun Mo merely mentioned this in passing. He didn\u2019t really care if he would be able to recruit Tantai Yutang successfully or not. It was because the system had said that this person was a time bomb, and it was advisable to stay far away from him.Tantai Yutang was stunned, and he looked at Sun Mo in surprise. This handsome-looking intern teacher seemed to be more confident than he was!To think that he would say something so narcissist? Who gave you the courage to do that?However, Tantai Yutang felt a slight throb in his heart. The reason he came to the Central Province Academy this time around was because a great teacher whom he had been admiring for a long time was a guest professor here. Although he made use of some tricks and got to meet the teacher, the teacher didn\u2019t take him in as his disciple.The reason was because of his sickly constitution. What use would it be if he were to die young, even if he was a genius? Great teachers were very busy and didn\u2019t lack disciples. Why would he have to waste his energy on Tantai Yutang?\u201cHaha!\u201dTantai Yutang laughed in self-ridicule and decided to test out Sun Mo further. However, he was interrupted before he could say anything.\u201cIs there an end to this? I hate people who try to scheme against me the most. Aren\u2019t you here to come under my tutelage? If you\u2019re willing, then kneel down now. Otherwise, scram.\u201dSun Mo felt displeased. (You want to test me? Who do you think you are?)Tantai Yutang\u2019s calm expression changed. He couldn\u2019t help but feel surprised that Sun Mo had seen through him.Tantai Yutang had seen the process in which Sun Mo had accepted Jiang Leng as his student, and it left a strong impression on him. Thereafter, he tried to find out about Sun Mo. The reason why he had come to the battle hall was so that he could check Sun Mo out. If Sun Mo met his expectations, then he\u2019d ask to go under his tutelage.This was a little awkward. Moreover, it seemed that this Sun Mo was a schemer as well. Why would people say that he was someone who sponged off a woman? It seemed that there must be a hidden story behind this.\u201cYou\u2019re so hesitant. Are you even a guy?\u201dSun Mo frowned.\u201cHaha, Teacher Sun, you\u2019re really different from others. But aren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019ll bring you great trouble if you were to take me as your disciple?\u201d Tantai Yutang asked.Pa!Sun Mo raised his hand and slapped Tantai Yutang\u2019s face.\u201cHuh?\u201dLu Zhiruo, who had been watching by the side, was shocked. Why did he suddenly raise his hands?\u201cI\u2019m someone who hates to repeat what I said for a second time! Don\u2019t test me any further!\u201dThe reason why Sun Mo had done this wasn\u2019t only because he was feeling a little angry. He was also trying to test Tantai Yutang. After all, he mustn\u2019t ignore the system\u2019s remark.The students nearby heard the commotion and looked over.Tantai Yutang, who had been hit, didn\u2019t appear furious, violent, or ashamed. He only looked at Sun Mo with a hint of surprise.Thereafter, he shook his head, knelt down, and kowtowed respectfully.\u201cTeacher Sun, please take me in as your disciple!\u201dDing!+1 favorable impression point from Tantai Yutang.Prestige connection with Tantai Yutang initiated: Neutral (1/100)Sun Mo\u2019s gaze paused when he heard the system\u2019s notification. (You didn\u2019t contribute any favorable impression points when I saw through your scheme, but you showed a reaction after I gave you a slap. Are you a masochist?)As expected of a student who was deemed to be a time bomb by the system. His reaction was too surprising.What did those psychology books he had bought say?There was a high chance that someone like him wasn\u2019t mentally well.\u201cTeacher!\u201dLu Zhiruo hid behind Sun Mo, tugging at his sleeve secretly. She covered her mouth with her hand and reminded him, \u201cI feel that he\u2019s very scary. It\u2019s better to not take him in as a disciple.\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dSun Mo laughed as well. (When I play games, I love to challenge the highest difficulty level. How can I possibly back off when a student is challenging me now?)\u201cSun Mo, don\u2019t go too far and end up failing miserably later!\u201dThe system suddenly reminded him.\u201cAlright, after three kowtows, you\u2019ll be my disciple.\u201dSun Mo spoke up, not paying the system any heed.\u201cTeacher!\u201dLu Zhiruo tugged at Sun Mo\u2019s sleeves anxiously.\u201cTeacher, please accept three kowtows from this disciple!\u201dTantai Yutang kowtowed properly, knocking his forehead to the ground without trying any tricks.\u201cGet up!\u201dSun Mo had his hands behind his back and walked out of the battle hall, not helping Tantai Yutang up.The sickly guy didn\u2019t mind it. He got up, brushed off the dust on his kneecaps, and then bowed toward Lu Zhiruo. \u201cSenior Martial Sister Lu!\u201dLu Zhiruo immediately ran off like a rabbit that had seen a hunter.\u201cOh my, that sickly guy hasn\u2019t scared off my lucky mascot, right?\u201dSun Mo was a little worried.\u201cYou\u2019re better off worrying about yourself. I\u2019ll repeat it again. This is Middle-Earth\u2019s nine provinces. Don\u2019t use the teaching method you used back in No.2 High School. It\u2019d be useless.\u201dThe system reprimanded, feeling that Sun Mo hadn\u2019t listened to its advice.\u201cSince you\u2019ve chosen me as your owner, then you should trust me. Or are you saying that you\u2019re blind?\u201d Sun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cI was challenged, so what was I supposed to do? Avoid it? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019d rather die!\u201dThe system suddenly fell silent. After hearing Sun Mo\u2019s words, it suddenly felt that it might have made the best choice in choosing Sun Mo.Putting his capabilities aside, it was true that he had conducted himself with the air of a great teacher. Its previous few hosts would all immediately shrink back after docilely listening to its warning.\u201cAre you feeling admiration for me now?\u201d Sun Mo asked, \u201cIf so, just say it. Don\u2019t keep it pent-up inside you!\u201d\u201cScram!\u201dThe system made its point clear.Ding!\u2018Mission released. Please make Tantai Yutang want to acknowledge you from the bottom of his heart. The reward will be one golden treasure chest.\u2019It wasn\u2019t that pleasant when Sun Mo heard the mission announced by the system. This sickly guy really didn\u2019t harbor a pure intention, but that didn\u2019t matter. Things would only be challenging then.After coming to the Central Province\u2019s Tang Country, he couldn\u2019t lay his hands on game consoles anymore and couldn\u2019t play games. Therefore, he could only find his own fun. Teaching a student would be considered quite a good way of spending his time!Due to Gu Xiuxun\u2019s efforts, the school agreed that as long as an intern teacher managed to recruit five students, they\u2019d be converted to an official position, becoming a substitute teacher.An internal announcement had been released, so there wouldn\u2019t be any changes to it.Li Ziqi, Lu Zhiruo, Xuanyuan Po, Jiang Leng, and now, with Tantai Yutang, there were a total of five of them. Although they each had their flaws, Sun Mo had managed to meet the requirements.\u201cYou guys can take a walk around the school by yourself. I\u2019ll be taking my leave first.\u201dSun Mo had been going around for two days but hadn\u2019t met that many students with high potential value. Moreover, it wasn\u2019t easy for him to recruit students in the first place given his status as an intern teacher. Therefore, he decided not to waste time on this and went back to the dorm to continue his writing of [Journey to the West].Men mustn\u2019t be short of money. It was because they\u2019d have nothing to back them up if they didn\u2019t have any. This was what Sun Mo had always thought. Therefore, he needed to come up with the manuscript quickly and head to the Reading Veranda to look for the boss whose surname was Zheng, exchanging the manuscript for money.Tantai Yutang touched his face where he had been slapped by Sun Mo and watched as Sun Mo departed. His lips curled up into a smile, hoping that this life spent in the Central Province Academy wouldn\u2019t be boring.Lu Zhiruo had run off after Sun Mo.\u2026The student recruitment meet finally ended after three days.The staff from the logistics department dismantled the Martial Arts Platform, took off the banners that were hung up in various parts of the school, as well as some temporary infrastructures that had been set up. After they were done with all the work, they then had a gathering at a restaurant.After digging into the dishes and wine, the atmosphere became more lively.It wasn\u2019t long before the conversation was turned to Sun Mo. There was no helping it since this guy had a relationship with An Xinhui.\u201cDid you guys hear? Sun Mo had taken in quite a few students, out of which, one of them was a genius that Liu Mubai had taken an interest in. I think he is called Xuanyuan Po. I wonder if this is true!\u201dChen Mu felt curious.\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a lie. Which student would be so stupid to study under an intern teacher?\u201dLiu Tong let out a soft cough. He had drunk so much that his face was flushed up, and his breath smelled of wine.\u201cThat might not be the case. I heard that Gu Xiuxun had recruited five students on the first day. As expected of a graduate that our Headmaster An had personally headhunted. She\u2019s too outstanding.\u201dChen Mu retaliated.\u201cHow can Sun Mo be compared with Gu Xiuxun? He\u2019s not even worthy of carrying her shoes!\u201dLiu Tong said in disdain.\u201cThat\u2019s right. He must have spent money to get people to spread the rumor for the sake of his reputation. Weren\u2019t there intern teachers who had done the same in the past? They still ended up being fired in the end!\u201d\u201cEven if Sun Mo has the capabilities, he won\u2019t be able to work for long. Zhang Hanfu\u2019s son had always liked Headmaster An. Do you guys think that Zhang Hanfu would let Sun Mo off?\u201cThat Sun Mo really doesn\u2019t have a discerning eye. He thinks he has the right to get involved in our school\u2019s chaotic matters? He\u2019s planning on helping Headmaster An to bring back the school\u2019s glory? To bring it back to the ranks of the Nine Greats? He\u2019s thinking too much!\u201dThe workers from the logistics department had fewer reservations in their talks after having drunk a lot. It was difficult for the Central Province Academy to return to its former glory. If they were to be ranked last in this year\u2019s league tournament, then they\u2019d lose their rights and be removed from the list. It\u2019d be all over for them then.It made sense. Zhang Hanfu and Wang Su had been in the school for over 20 years, and their influences were deeply rooted.It had only been three years since An Xinhui came. In the past, she didn\u2019t have any experience of being a Headmaster. To be honest, it was already considered good that she hadn\u2019t been chased off after three months.When An Xinhui just came, other than Zhou Lin, she had no other close aides by her side. She had to put in great effort to stabilize her standing in the school.\u201cOld Li, you\u2019ve been taking care of Sun Mo recently. What\u2019s your take on this?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLiu Tong gulped down a cup of wine.\u201cHaha!\u201dLi Gong wore an awkward expression, having a strong urge to curse. He had been following Sun Mo over the past few days, wanting to see if there was any way to deal with the predicament. He then increasingly lost the courage to go up against Sun Mo.Taking Xuanyuan Po in was a rumor?What a joke. When Xuanyuan Po knelt down and acknowledged Sun Mo as his teacher, Li Gong had been hiding in the warehouse, witnessing the entire process.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But what was the truth like?Qin Fen had also been present at the scene then. He had even confidently mentioned his brilliant achievements to prove how outstanding he was. In the end, Xuanyuan Po still chose Sun Mo.Even until now, Li Gong could still remember how furious Qin Fen had been after losing to Sun Mo. He was just short of devouring Sun Mo up.Was Xuanyuan Po a genius?Li Gong couldn\u2019t tell. However, he knew that Liu Mubai and Gu Xiuxun had both wanted to recruit him. But in the end, he landed up in Sun Mo\u2019s hands.As someone who was used to the society\u2019s ways, having experienced a lot of ups and downs, Li Gong didn\u2019t believe in luck. There must be a reason why Sun Mo had been able to win against Qin Fen.Then, Li Ziqi came up by herself to look for Sun Mo, wanting to become his disciple.Li Gong had seen for himself how many teachers had fought to recruit her. Putting aside Liu Mubai and Gu Xiuxun, who were new teachers that An Xinhui had held great expectations for, even a few great teachers came. However, Li Ziqi hadn\u2019t wavered at all and insisted on choosing to follow Sun Mo.Li Gong found it funny after seeing Xu Shaoyuan returning in disappointment, wearing an expression as if someone had stolen his food supply. (You great teachers have always carried yourself so loftily. You\u2019ve been defeated now, right?)However, Li Gong\u2019s amusement was then replaced by respect and fear. Xu Shaoyuan was a 2-star great teacher, and even he had wanted to recruit Li Ziqi. This showed that Li Ziqi was either very talented or had come from a wealthy family, having a distinguished status.Regardless of which it was, Sun Mo had gotten a good deal.Of course, there was also the possibility that he might suffer great losses.Not all great teachers were good people with respectable morals. What would happen when someone snatched the opportunity and recruited a student like Li Ziqi, whom even great teachers wanted?Of course they\u2019d keep on sending trouble to that particular teacher\u2019s way. This trouble wasn\u2019t referring to fighting, but in the area of their teaching capabilities.If the teacher\u2019s capabilities were insufficient, they\u2019d gradually lose confidence from these challenges. They might even become reclusive, feeling that they weren\u2019t able to teach the student well and take on the initiative to rescind their teacher-student relationship.There was no other way out. Who would still have the face to continue as a teacher after failing too many times?Li Gong had been working in the Central Province Academy for close to ten years and had seen such occurrences before. Great teachers didn\u2019t just need to be able to recruit students with good potential, but they also had to be capable of holding onto them.\u201cHmph, Sun Mo, don\u2019t be proud. The real tests are the ones that are coming.\u201dLi Gong wanted to see Sun Mo ending up in a wretched state. However, upon recalling his pathetic state the other day after being struck by the \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019 halo, he shuddered and quickly dismissed this thought.Even if Sun Mo were to lose, he still wouldn\u2019t be someone that Li Gong could taunt.At the thought of this, Li Gong felt upset and drank an entire jug of wine.Ding.+20 favorable impression points from Li Gong.Prestige connection with Li Gong: Neutral (76/100).\u201cSun Mo isn\u2019t as bad as you guys say, okay? In order to fight for students, he even had a competition with Qin Fen and ended up winning.\u201dOne logistics worker pointed out. He had been present at the scene then.\u201cI heard about that as well. It was said that after he won, that pair of twin brothers immediately knelt and asked to study under him. However, did he really reject them?\u201dChen Mu asked.\u201cIt must be fake. If it were you, would you reject students who want to study under you?\u201dLiu Tong was very certain.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201dChen Mu shook his head. \u201cI would want to put them up on an altar and revere them.(That\u2019s why you\u2019ll forever be a logistics worker, while Sun Mo is a teacher. Moreover, it is very likely that he might become a great teacher.)Li Gong sneered in his heart. He had seen that competition as well. He had even been outside the classroom, making use of some tools to peep at the process in which Sun Mo had used the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands massage technique on the student called Zou Ping. It was too magnificent and too amazing.If he could have the good fortune of enjoying it, his lame leg would definitely be able to recover.At the thought of this, Li Gong felt even greater respect toward Sun Mo. Just with his hands alone, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him to take care of his living needs in the Central Province Academy.The only problem was that the vice-headmaster Zhang Hanfu would definitely destroy his reputation and chase him out of the school so that his son would be able to marry An Xinhui.Ding.+20 favorable impression points from Li Gong.Prestige connection with Li Gong: Neutral (96/100).The logistics workers chatted on, and the topic soon changed to the ladies. They talked about female teachers, students, as well as throwing out all sorts of lewd jokes.Li Gong was usually someone who enjoyed conversations like these, but he had no mood for that today.What kind of person was Sun Mo?Li Gong felt that given his judgment that he had trained up while mingling in society for so many years, he was able to see through plenty of people. However, he was unable to see through Sun Mo.Why did he reject the Zou brothers?They were young men who were called geniuses and had their names listed on the talent booklet. If Sun Mo didn\u2019t care for them, then why did he take in Jiang Leng thereafter?Having stayed in the school for a very long time, even Li Gong knew of some basic techniques for selecting students. One shouldn\u2019t take students who were covered in spirit runes. That would mean that the students would have no more potential for growth. One shouldn\u2019t take in sickly students either\u2026However, not only did Sun Mo recruit Jiang Leng, but he had even gone up against Lian Zheng, who was a 1-star great teacher, to get him. Lian Zheng was someone that Li Gong would anxiously curry up to, but Sun Mo was unafraid of him.At the thought of how he had threatened Sun Mo back then, Li Gong felt that he had been too ridiculous. In Sun Mo\u2019s eyes, he was probably more of a clown than a clown was.Ding!+20 favorable impression points from Li Gong.Prestige connection with Li Gong: Friendly (106/100).\u201cLi Gong, drink up!\u201dChen Mu called out.\u201cOh!\u201dLi Gong downed another cup of wine. He was completely in submission to Sun Mo after having seen his performance during the student recruitment meet. He decided to do as Sun Mo planned. After he got his lame leg treated, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him even if he had to seek a living elsewhere.What Sun Mo said was right. With a lame leg, he\u2019d be despised by the prostitutes even if he were to patronize brothels. It\u2019d take him a long time to struggle to change \u2018positions\u2019, and he\u2019d have gotten \u2018soft\u2019 then.\u201cI\u2019m telling you, even if Sun Mo were to become an official teacher, he won\u2019t be able to stay here for long. Would Zhang Hanfu let him off? Would Liu Mubai let him off?Liu Tong was gloating. \u201cGiven how An Xinhui has reputation, beauty, and status, who wouldn\u2019t want to marry her? Sun Mo is destined to be kicked away when he is standing at the very front.\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019d be good if he can be kicked to death!\u201d\u201cLiu Mubai might be barely worthy of Headmaster An, but who is Sun Mo?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why Sun Mo should do things properly. If he is a toad, then he shouldn\u2019t be lusting after the swan\u2019s flesh.\u201dThe group of logistics workers started laughing. An Xinhui had a very good reputation in the Central Province Academy. This was like people seeing the female celebrity they liked announcing that she had gotten engaged. Moreover, the guy was someone who had extremely ordinary looks.\u201cKick Sun Mo aside? They\u2019d probably get their legs broken instead!\u201dLi Gong mumbled.Of course, he didn\u2019t dare to say this out openly. As someone experienced with the way things worked in society, he knew how he should act to integrate with a group. He had to smile on the surface, sharing the same views as the majority.\u2026The entire story of [Journey to the West] wasn\u2019t long, and Sun Mo wasn\u2019t planning on giving old man Zheng the entire manuscript in one go either. In the event that the old man denied things, then he\u2019d have an alternative route to turn to.It wasn\u2019t that Sun Mo didn\u2019t believe old man Zheng, but it was just that he liked to keep a backup plan and not let himself be sunk into a desperate strait. This was one of his beliefs.After writing about staying the night at the Wuzhuang Monastery and secretly eating the Renshen Fruit, Sun Mo stopped writing. The school had already sent out the notification that they\u2019d be holding the meeting for intern teachers.They mustn\u2019t be late for such meetings, so Sun Mo went to sleep now.However, before long, the system\u2019s notification rang out. He had received favorable impression points from Li Gong.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dSun Mo frowned.\u201cLi Gong has developed a reverence for you and thus generated favorable impression points!\u201dThe system explained.\u201cCome on, can we be more reasonable with things? I had just fallen asleep! I won\u2019t be encountering a lot of such situations in the future, right? I\u2019d definitely die young then!\u201dSun Mo was speechless. (Li Gong, you\u2019re a guy. Can you think of a woman before you sleep? What do you mean by having reverence for me?)The system fell silent, not talking crap with Sun Mo.Sun Mo lay down, but a few minutes later, the system\u2019s notification rang out again.20 favorable impression points was a lot. It was as if he had picked up 100 dollars while walking on the road in the day. However, Sun Mo didn\u2019t feel good about it. He got up from his bed, poured himself a cup of water, and drank as he thought about things. What was this situation? Why did Li Gong contribute so many favorable impression points?Were there any schemes in this?It wasn\u2019t long before another notification rang out. The word \u2018friendly\u2019 was especially pleasant-sounding.\u201cHaha!\u201dSun Mo had no idea what to say now. Even though he felt happy from receiving the favorable impression points, at the thought of how a man wasn\u2019t sleeping at night but thinking of him instead, he felt uncomfortable despite that it was the feelings of reverence.How good would it be if it was changed to a big-boobed girl?Ding!\u201cCongratulations, your prestige connection with Li Gong has been raised to \u2018friendly\u2019. Rewarded with one black-iron treasure chest. Please keep up the good work!\u201dA pitch-black treasure chest immediately dropped down and appeared before him.\u201cKeep it!\u201dLu Zhiruo, who could increase his luck, wasn\u2019t by his side, so Sun Mo didn\u2019t dare to open up the chest. Otherwise, it\u2019d be as useless as throwing meat buns at a dog to beat it.After waiting for another half an hour, there was finally no new notifications. However, Sun Mo wasn\u2019t able to go back to sleep anymore. Left without a choice, he could only open up the [100 types of alchemical secret concoction methods] and continued to study it.Other than grasping three great teacher halos, one must also reach the expert-grade in a secondary occupation to become a 1-star great teacher. The original owner of this body had studied alchemy previously, so Sun Mo decided to go with it.\u2026The wind in the early morning had a hint of coolness.Sun Mo woke up early as usual, practicing his Grand Universe Formless Divine Art. Thereafter, he had breakfast and then headed for the teaching building. The meeting for intern teachers was going to start at 8 a.m.Sun Mo arrived 15 minutes earlier, but when he reached the classroom, he realized that close to 200 of the intern teachers had already arrived. It seemed that everyone wanted to leave a good impression of being punctual to the school\u2019s leaders.Gu Xiuxun was talking to some teachers when she saw Sun Mo entering. She threw him a glance. The others also noticed Sun Mo, and the talking sounds instantly softened.Everyone\u2019s gazes turned toward Sun Mo.\u201cThat\u2019s Sun Mo?\u201dAs An Xinhui\u2019s fianc\u00e9, as well as the only intern teacher who had been thrown to the logistics department, quite a number of people hadn\u2019t seen Sun Mo before. However, there was almost no one who hadn\u2019t heard of his name.Sun Mo couldn\u2019t be bothered to walk further in and randomly found a seat in the last row to sit down.As there were too many people and they wouldn\u2019t fit in the office, they could only come to the classroom to hold the meeting.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHe looks so composed!\u201dSome intern teachers were surprised. If they were the ones to get so much attention, they\u2019d definitely feel nervous and at a loss.\u201cTsk, although he looks calm, he\u2019s definitely very anxious inside!\u201dSome people looked down on him.Gu Xiuxun pursed her lips. The one directing today\u2019s meeting was the vice-headmaster, Zhang Hanfu. Sun Mo was in for a scolding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60: Storming HostilitySun Mo sat at the back row, assessing his 200 competitors. Other than a minority of them who couldn\u2019t get along with others, the rest were basically split into three groups.The first group was one led by Gu Xiuxun. As the top graduate from Myriad Daos Academy and the top beauty in the school, most of her people were male intern teachers.Most top beauties of their school would maintain a cold attitude, letting the guys know that it wasn\u2019t an easy thing to get close to them. They wanted to increase their value in this manner.However, Gu Xiuxun didn\u2019t do so. When she smiled, it was as if the spring breeze had blown. She would reply even when occasionally approached by some ugly intern teachers.Gu Xiuxun\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t just to become a great teacher. She wanted to bring the Central Province Academy back to its former glory, to the rankings of the Nine Greats.For the sake of this, Gu Xiuxun had displayed her astonishing approachability. Only people with that quality would be able to gain good impressions of most teachers and thereby becoming a leader.The second group took up space on the right of the classroom, with Gao Ben in its core. The ratio of guys to ladies wasn\u2019t too different, but it was the biggest group out of all three.Gao Ben graduated from Liang Province\u2019s Westshore Military School and had achieved great mastery in the Mystic Ice Spear Arts that was passed down in his family. He had outstanding battle prowess, and this was also the reason why vice-headmaster Zhang Hanfu had spent a great amount of money to recruit him.The Westshore Military School was one of the Nine Greats, and their specialties were in battles. Moreover, as they uphold the military-style management in the school, most of their students were very careful and serious.Of course, there were also a lot of them who didn\u2019t smile at all. Therefore, there was a saying that was spread amongst the world of the great teachers\u2014if they saw a teacher or student who had a poker face, then they must definitely be from the Westshore Military School.Gao Ben didn\u2019t like to talk, but this didn\u2019t stop him from becoming the focal point of the group. This was because this world had always been one that revered the strong.Quite a number of intern teachers tried to seek guidance from him but almost couldn\u2019t get any replies.The third circle had the least number of people, taking up space on the left of the classroom, further to the back. Zhang Lan was like the leader of the group, and most of the people here were female intern teachers.Zhang Lan was a graduate from Yue Province\u2019s Myriad Spirits Academy, and specialized in spiritual beast control. This school was also one of the Supreme Academies.As a female, Zhang Lan\u2019s looks were ordinary. However, after dolling up and having the status as a graduate from a famous school, she was able to attract some guys as well. However, there was an eerie spirit rune tattoo on her left face which made her disposition scarier.If her partner who shared the same bed with her were to see her after waking up in the middle of the night, he\u2019d definitely get a bad scare.The female intern teachers didn\u2019t look down on her. Or rather, when ladies with ordinary appearances gather together, it\u2019d have the feeling as if they were gathered together to share warmth. There might also be those who had a hint of superiority, thinking that although they weren\u2019t stronger than her, they were at least better-looking.This sense of superiority was non-existent when they were with Gu Xiuxun.Sun Mo pinched his forehead. It wasn\u2019t easy to survive in the workplace.\u201cI heard that Qin Fen has resigned. Is that true?\u201dGao Ben stroked his newly-shaved beard stubble and looked around for Qin Fen.\u201cHah, he wasn\u2019t even able to win against Sun Mo who sponges off a woman. What else can he do except to resign? To stay behind and be ridiculed?\u201d Zeng Jun sneered. \u201cIf I were Jixia Learning Palace\u2019s headmaster, I\u2019d beat him to death for bringing such shame to the school.\u201d\u201cWho amongst you has seen the competition that day? What happened? How did Sun Mo win?\u201dGao Ben was curious, and it was rare for him to ask more questions.\u201cIt was meant to be a competition of their ability to provide guidance, but Sun Mo had pulled a trick and used massage techniques to help bring up the student\u2019s level. How were they supposed to compete then? That student would surely win!\u201dThe uglier guy who had seen Sun Mo recruited Xuanyuan Po on the first day of the student recruitment meet spoke up. He didn\u2019t witness the situation on that day, but the rumors spread like wildfire. Moreover, because Sun Mo was An Xinhui\u2019s fianc\u00e9, many intern teachers didn\u2019t like him. Therefore, the rumors continued to move toward the negative aspect as they spread.\u201cMassage technique?\u201dGao Ben frowned.\u201cHow can there be such an amazing massage technique? The student must have eaten some sort of alchemical pill, or that he was almost advancing to the next level to begin with.\u201dZeng Jun had doubts.Everyone continued to talk about this, and when Zeng Jun heard that almost everyone doubted Sun Mo, his mood instantly became a lot better.The school that Zeng Jun had graduated from was at the bottom even amongst the \u2018D\u2019 Grade schools. Therefore, he valued this internship opportunity at the Central Province Academy.Seeing that Sun Mo had become famous, in addition to the fact that he was An Xinhui\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and thus was almost certain to get a position to stay in the school, Zeng Jun felt very displeased. Therefore, the things he talked about Sun Mo behind his back wouldn\u2019t sound very pleasing.In fact, many intern teachers didn\u2019t like Sun Mo. It was because he wasn\u2019t capable yet could stay behind in the school.If the right to remain in the school was dependent on their capabilities, they felt that they\u2019d definitely be able to crush Sun Mo.Clank! Clank! Clank!The bell suddenly rang. It was 8 a.m.The intern teachers were stunned for a moment and then quickly returned to their seats. Some of them even started to tidy up their appearances, putting on what they felt was a charming smile.If they could leave a good impression with the school\u2019s leaders, they might increase their chances of staying in the school.The door soon opened and a middle-aged guy with a height of less than 1.6 meters walked in. He was short but stocky. The black long robes he was wearing bulged tightly from his muscles, and his figure could be clearly seen.His short stature and limbs looked a little funny given his status as a teacher. When he stood in front, he was only one head taller than the desk. However, no one dared to laugh.This middle-aged man was called Zhang Hanfu, and he was one of the three vice-headmasters in the Central Province Academy. He was a 2-star great teacher and was also an expert in the divine force realm.Putting these aside, the pressure that Zhang Hanfu emitted was powerful enough. It could be that his height was too similar to that of Wu Dang [1], so he placed a greater emphasis on his spirit and disposition. He kept a tense expression and as he looked around, his narrow eagle eyes gleamed with a sharp glow.Zhang Hanfu\u2019s gaze swept across the room like a sharp blade.All the intern teachers shifted their gazes, not daring to look him in the eye.\u201cWhat a domineering disposition!\u201dGu Xiuxun wasn\u2019t afraid, but given how intelligent she was, she was smart and knew how she should act.Zhang Hanfu was satisfied. Due to his physical flaw, he valued high positions even more and enjoyed the mental joy he received from subduing others. However, when his gaze landed on the back row, he frowned.Sun Mo sat there, assessing him and not averting his gaze at all. There weren\u2019t any hints of reverence or fear either.\u201cWhat insolence!\u201dZhang Hanfu\u2019s lips twitched, and he was about to look for an excuse to give Sun Mo a scolding when the door at the back of the classroom was pushed open with a loud bang.Ludi ran in, panting furiously, holding onto a bag that had half a pig trotter that was covered in thick hair.Swoosh!Half of the intern teachers\u2019 gazes turned over but quickly turned back at an even faster speed, looking steadily to the front.Hua!Ludi broke out in a cold sweat, and it instantly drenched his clothes. However, he didn\u2019t dare to wipe it off. He stood there, stiffened on the spot as if he had been turned into a stone, not daring to move.He looked at Zhang Hanfu with a pleading gaze.\u201cThe first requirement of a teacher is to be punctual. If you can\u2019t even do this, then how do you expect to become a teacher? Get out!\u201dZhang Hanfu didn\u2019t bellow but spoke as if he was bellowing. His words seemed to come straight from his throat, sounding very imposing.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201dLudi wanted to explain that he had woken up very early, but was delayed because he was braising pig trotter and sending it to Teacher Zhou Shanyi. However, it was a pity that when he met Zhang Hanfu\u2019s stern gaze, it was as if he had been smacked in the mouth by a club, unable to say a word.Another six of the school\u2019s leaders entered, with An Xinhui at the very back. She was wearing a moon-white long robe, appearing elegant and refined.The male intern teachers secretly threw a glance at her and then felt even more jealous of Sun Mo.\u201cSit down. There\u2019s no next time!\u201dAn Xinhui said and looked at Ludi, who seemed as if he was going to burst out in tears.\u201cOh! Oh!\u201dLudi quickly found an empty seat nearby and sat down, looking as though he had been granted great amnesty.After Ludi\u2019s episode, when Zhang Hanfu looked toward Sun Mo again, he had lost his chance to reproach him. However, he was in no hurry. He would get his chance.The other school leaders sat on the chairs that had been prepared, with only Zhang Hanfu standing. He cleared his throat and started to speak.Gu Xiuxun was a little surprised at the sight of this. It seemed that the fight for power in the Central Province Academy was a lot more intense than she had expected, and An Xinhui seemed to be in a very disadvantageous position.Usually, it would be the headmaster who started off a speech. The one to speak first would be the one who held the highest position and the greatest authority. But right now, Zhang Hanfu had gone against his position and took on this role.Looking at how the other leaders were behaving, it seemed that they weren\u2019t unfamiliar with such things. This meant that this wasn\u2019t something that happened by chance.\u201cWe, the Central Province Academy, don\u2019t look at one\u2019s background and experience. As long as you have talent, you can rise and get the chance to showcase your abilities.\u201dZhang Hanfu spoke up.Although this vice-headmaster was short like a potato, he spoke imposingly. In addition to his powerful body language, his speech had a great ability to influence others.\u201cBased on past years\u2019 precedences, an intern teacher must first be a teaching assistant for a year and pass the tests before taking on the job officially. However, this year, after the discussions amongst the school\u2019s leaders, we\u2019ve decided that as long as an intern teacher can recruit five personal disciples from the student recruitment meet, they will be able to get the employment letter from Central Province Academy, becoming a substitute teacher.\u201dSlight commotions broke out in the classroom, and everyone\u2019s gaze turned toward Gu Xiuxun, Gao Ben, and Zhang Lan.Gao Ben\u2019s legs were apart, his hands resting on his knees, and his back upright as he looked straight to the front. Zhang Lan didn\u2019t show any expressions, while Gu Xiuxun smiled lightly, exuding strong confidence.\u201cRight now, all the intern teachers who have recruited five personal disciples, please raise your hands!\u201dZhang Hanfu instructed.Gu Xiuxun was confident and proud, raising her hand without any hesitation. Next, Gao Ben also raised his right hand. Their gazes met, releasing sparks and great competitiveness.Swoosh!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEveryone\u2019s eyes turned toward Zhang Lan.Zhang Lan was expressionless and paused for about ten or so seconds. Just as everyone thought that she hadn\u2019t recruited enough students, she raised her hand.\u201cHa, you guys must have been fooled, right?\u201dZhang Lan felt exhilarated.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_DalangPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 61: Sorry, I Have 5 Students Too\uff01The intern teachers\u2019 faces were filled with helplessness. Must they tease people like that?\u201cI\u2019ve already said it, for someone who was crowned a graduate of one of the Nine Great famous schools, how can he not have recruited any student?\u201d\u201cSigh, if only I had been more hardworking and had been admitted to one of the Nine Greats, I would have even more opportunities now.\u201dMany people were commenting softly and looked toward the few intern teachers who loved to be in the limelight. There was no exception; no one raised their hand.Everyone didn\u2019t jeer because this was a normal phenomenon. After all, they couldn\u2019t treat Gu Xiuxun and the rest with conventional reasoning.Zhang Sheng felt so awkward that he wished he could squeeze his head into the school desk. He had always been bragging that he was an elite of the same level as Gao Ben and Qin Fen. But now, he finally realized how huge the gap was between him and the true elites.(It\u2019s ok. I still have a chance since I had made an agreement with three students. As long as I am able to go through a year of internship and become an official teacher, they would acknowledge me as their master.)Thinking of this, Zhang Sheng instantly felt more at ease.In any class, most of the good students would take the initiative to sit on the front rows, and the same theory could also be applied here. The most outstanding and confident intern teachers had already filled up the front-most seats.They were trying to show their faces to the higher-ups as much as possible to get more opportunities and appreciation.Over two hundred people were competing for fifteen vacancies and among these vacancies, some had been decided behind closed doors. After a simple calculation, the elimination ratio was twenty to one, so how could they not try hard to perform?Ludi looked at his colleagues that were sitting on the front row. He pouted and thought, \u201cI should behave and continue to braise the pig trotters. That way, I will get a favorable evaluation from serving Teacher Zhou well.\u201d\u201cJust wait and see, the victory round will only be determined one year later!\u201dAfter muttering to himself, Ludi felt balanced psychologically. After all, Gu Xiuxun and the rest were very outstanding. If he were to compare himself to them, he was simply asking for trouble. His rivals this time were the other intern teachers.\u201cVery good, it seems that no other intern teachers meet this requirement,\u201d muttered Ludi.He held his pig trotters tightly and swept his eyes over the room. However, when he saw Sun Mo\u2019s figure on the left side of the same row, he was startled and almost let out a shout.Sun Mo raised his right hand and placed it on his desk.Oh dang, for someone who was living off a woman, what was he doing raising his hand?Sun Mo sat in the last row, and in front of him was a man with a big build. The way he raised his hand was not similar to Gu Xiuxun and Gao Ben who had extended their arms in the air. He had only propped his elbow against the desk. Hence, other than the few people around him, the rest almost didn\u2019t see his action.Zhang Hanfu looked at Gao Ben and felt pleased. Since Zhang Hanfu was the one poaching Gao Ben over, the latter was already tagged with his label. If Gao Ben achieved some results, then it meant that Zhang Hanfu had an eye for talents.(Qin Fen who was poached over by An Xinhui is already out, how great. The only troublesome one left is Gu Xiuxun.)Thinking of this, Zhang Hanfu looked at Gu Xiuxun.It was no wonder that she was the campus queen of Myriad Daos Academy. She was indeed beautiful. If she was tactful and gave up on the wrong path, turning to a better one, he would accept her or even give her a place as the year\u2019s head. But if she was determined to follow An Xinhui\u2019s path into the dark, sorry then, he would definitely destroy her.As for Zhang Lan, this graduate had personally handed over her job application. It was apparent that she had not been involved with An Xinhui or Wang Su at the moment; hence, Zhang Hanfu could try to recruit her at any time.The various school leaders were whispering to each other\u2019s ears. In all honesty, the results were somewhat disappointing, but they couldn\u2019t put the blame on anyone else. Looking at the current fame of Central Province Academy, it was difficult to recruit the elite graduates from A and B Grade universities.Even if they had any, they would be the unchosen few at the bottom of the ranking.\u201cAhem ahem, since this is the case, I hereby announce that Gao Ben, Zhang Lan, and Gu Xiuxun are officially employed as teachers of Central Province Academy with immediate effect!\u201dZhang Hanfu started clapping after his speech.Regardless of whether they were sincere or not, all the intern teachers started clapping as well, except for Sun Mo whose hand was still raised.Ludi looked at Sun Mo with a face full of surprise. Was he having diarrhea? At this point, he had to bear with it even if he couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. What if he was being misunderstood for raising his hand?Being misunderstood by vice-headmaster Zhang for having recruited enough students when he was only raising his hand to go to the toilet, oh my god, just the thought of it was extremely awkward.Gu Xiuxun shot a glance at An Xinhui. Before announcing the three teachers\u2019 employment, Zhang Hanfu hadn\u2019t even discussed with the various school leaders or especially listened to Headmaster An\u2019s opinions. He had seriously gone beyond his own authority.However, An Xinhui\u2019s expression remained unchanged, and she was able to keep her composure.\u201cHeadmaster An was indeed worthy of being admired!\u201dGu Xiuxun gave a compliment in her heart but started to feel unhappy again.(Zhang Hanfu, this bastard, how could he announce my name as the last out of the three of us? Just wait and see! I will crush Gao Ben and the rest of the teachers under his faction. He must pay dearly for looking down on me!)Zhang Hanfu made a gesture and the applause stopped immediately.\u201cAlright, if the rest of you have nothing else to add, you may leave. The three of you, stay back for a while!\u201dZhang Hanfu instructed.The intern teachers started standing up one after another. At this point, a voice shouting \u2018Vice-headmaster Zhang\u2019 sounded across the lecture theater.Swish!Everyone turned their heads and looked at the back rows, following the voice.The big guy jumped in fear and quickly dodged to the side. Then, everyone could see Sun Mo\u2019s figure and his raised right hand.Ludi also quickly shifted to the side to not disturb anyone\u2019s line of vision.\u201cSun Mo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Once Zhang Hanfu finished asking, he chided impatiently, \u201cAll the school\u2019s leaders are very busy. If it\u2019s trivial things, then think of a solution yourself. Don\u2019t come looking for us every time a problem arises.\u201dEven though Zhang Hanfu had a stern appearance, he was laughing in his heart. It seemed that his strategy had taken effect. Yang Cai, this fella, he was indeed something!\u201cI will settle my personal matters and will not trouble \u2018Vice\u2019-headmaster Zhang.\u201dSun Mo talked back immediately and emphasized on the word \u2018vice\u2019.Zhang Hanfu felt as though birdshit had been thrown at his face. He had been a vice-headmaster for over ten years, but he hated the \u2018vice\u2019 word the most.\u201cThen what\u2019s the issue?\u201dZhang Hanfu\u2019s tone was filled with anger.\u201cI\u2019m qualified!\u201dNormally, when speaking to a school\u2019s leader, one should stand up out of courtesy. However, judging from Zhang Hanfu\u2019s attitude and their opposing relationship, Sun Mo couldn\u2019t care less and continued sitting down calmly.\u201cQualified of what?\u201dZhang Hanfu hadn\u2019t reacted fully.Some intern teachers looked at Sun Mo with a hint of surprise.\u201cHow could it be? Has he recruited five students?\u201d\u201cFive is a little hard, but one or two was possible. I heard that Xuanyuan Po has been recruited by him!\u201d\u201cAre students these days brainless? Why did they acknowledge some random intern teachers as their masters? Are they disregarding their future?\u201dListening to these comments, Zhang Hanfu recalled that Sun Mo had recruited Li Ziqi. Hence, his expression became even gloomier.If it was indeed Li Ziqi, how could a miscellaneous graduate from a D-Grade university coach her?Thinking of Li Ziqi\u2019s background, Zhang Hanfu wished he could bite Sun Mo to death and seize her over. Hence, his voice sounded even stricter now.\u201cSun Mo, in order to be employed officially, you have to recruit five students, and this condition remains unchanged. Stop hoping to cheat through it with your dishonest practices.\u201dAfter Zhang Hanfu finished his words, he waved his hand impatiently. \u201cGet out!\u201dZhang Hanfu thought that Sun Mo wanted to make use of Li Ziqi\u2019s background to pressurize them into employing him. Hence, Zhang Hanfu had said those words in advance to shut Sun Mo\u2019s mouth.Now, if Sun Mo wasn\u2019t afraid of being despised by everyone because of nepotism, he could continue talking.\u201cVice-headmaster Zhang, as a great teacher and a school leader, do you not even have the patience to listen to others?\u201dSun Mo asked in reply.Swish!Sun Mo\u2019s sentence caused a commotion in the audience.The intern teachers stared at Sun Mo in shock. Even though he was the fiance of An Xinhui, must he be so arrogant?Zhang Hanfu was well-known for his irritable temperament and was always spouting torrents of verbal abuse at others. Surprisingly, Sun Mo dared to question him?No, this wasn\u2019t just questioning. It was already words of sarcasm.As expected, Zhang Hanfu stared with eyes wide open and he roared, \u201cI never listen to rubbish.\u201dThe intern teachers around Sun Mo quickly got out of the way as they were scared of being implicated like fish in the same pond.\u201cI\u2019m qualified!\u201dSun Mo repeated.\u201cI\u2019ve already said it. Unless you have recruited five personal disciples, you cannot be employed. Do you think that just one Li Ziqi is enough to make up for five people?\u201dZhang Hanfu ridiculed him and illuminated the topic.\u201cNo, she can\u2019t!\u201dSun Mo smiled. \u201cBut other than her, I have another four students!\u201d\u201cIf she can\u2019t, then why are you still trying to\u2026\u201dZhang Hanfu was like an old rooster with fallen feathers that was choked by a big hand. The remaining words were stifled in his throat.An Xinhui, who had a tranquil expression all along, finally let out a smile.The entire lecture theater felt as though it had been swept by Medusa\u2019s petrification technique and was in absolute silence. Everyone looked at Sun Mo; their expressions were filled with surprise and a deep sense of questioning.Sun Mo was able to recruit five students?It was fake, right? Acknowledging a master was a major event. Even students whose aptitudes were below average would be extremely cautious when acknowledging a master.After all, Zhang Hanfu was holding a high position as vice-headmaster and had been accustomed to various situations. He had a response very quickly. \u201cSun Mo, this is not a laughing matter. If it\u2019s proven that you\u2019re lying, even if you\u2019re An Xinhui\u2019s fiance, I will fire you.\u201dThis old fella was very cunning.Sun Mo was cursing in his heart. Zhang Hanfu had intentionally brought up the name of \u2018fiance\u2019 to hint to everyone that Sun Mo was relying on An Xinhui to recruit his students and not based on his own strengths.\u201cWhat do you mean by this? Are you suspecting that I\u2019m lying?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven though Sun Mo spoke to Zhang Hanfu with an honorific tone, he didn\u2019t mean to respect the latter at all. His tone was ridiculously tough and forceful.This scene had caused many intern teachers to be in shock again. Then, they secretly glanced toward An Xinhui. If not for An Xinhui, Sun Mo wouldn\u2019t be so daring when speaking to Zhang Hanfu.\u201cSince you\u2019re not afraid, show me the proof.\u201dZhang Hanfu sneered at him. (If this guy wanted to baffle me like this, he was underestimating my contingency reaction abilities as a vice-headmaster.)\u201cOh, then why don\u2019t the three of them need to provide proof?\u201d Sun Mo focused his gaze and stared at Zhang Hanfu while baring his fangs. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you suspecting them for lying?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Gu Xiuxun might be a little weaker, but she graduated with top scores from the Myriad Daos Academy. What about you? You\u2019re a graduate from the Songyang Academy, and as for your ranking, wouldn\u2019t you feel embarrassed if I were to bring it up?\u201dZhang Hanfu taunted, bringing in Gu Xiuxun as well.[This fool Sun Mo can only rely on his handsome face to sponge off a woman. By saying this, aren\u2019t you just giving me a chance to look down on you?]\u201cOh, this means that you look down on graduates from ordinary schools like mine?\u201dSun Mo made an expression as if he was struck by a realization.Zhang Hanfu, who had been very proud, suddenly tensed up. Fury surged in him and his face turned grim.Damn it! This Sun Mo was digging a trap for him!The school\u2019s leaders all appeared unconcerned, not wanting to help either side. However, after Sun Mo said this, their gazes all turned over uncontrollably, assessing him.An Xinhui\u2019s big spirited eyes looked at Sun Mo. She didn\u2019t expect that the guy she had grown up with knew how to scheme against others now.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. I think you should just be called Black Doggy Sun [1]. You\u2019re really a wild dog, daring to bite anyone!\u201dGu Xiuxun was speechless.Sun Mo might look very foolish, feeling that he had been given differential treatment. That was why he asked why Gu Xiuxun and the other two didn\u2019t need to be checked.Of course, Zhang Hanfu would have to explain the reason.In fact, Zhang Hanfu\u2019s reply was accurate. How could a graduate from an ordinary school compete with graduates from Aristocratic Schools? Wasn\u2019t this overestimating himself? It was very normal for other people to doubt you!This was a fact that everyone recognized, but after Sun Mo asked the question, it became a problem.How was Zhang Hanfu supposed to reply?If he were to say yes, then it\u2019d mean that he looked down on graduates from ordinary schools. Other than Gao Ben and Zhang Lan, everyone else had graduated from ordinary schools. They might not be able to cause any commotion, but what about the other teachers from the Central Province Academy?Graduates from famous schools formed the minority. If Zhang Hanfu\u2019s words were to spread out, even if the other teachers might appear to treat him respectfully on the outside, there\u2019d definitely be dissension and discord amongst them.Showing respect to a leader who looked down on their background? How shameless must they be to do that? Therefore, if Zhang Hanfu dared to say yes, his reputation amongst the teachers would definitely plunge. If words were to spread out to a wider area, then Zhang Hanfu\u2019s character would be doubted as well.How would the great teachers who didn\u2019t graduate from Aristocratic Schools treat Zhang Hanfu? The consequences would be within expectations.If Zhang Hanfu were to say no, then why did he require verification from Sun Mo? Was he too bored?Therefore, Sun Mo had managed to use just one line to drive Zhang Hanfu to a corner.Some intern teachers had too little experience in the workforce and hadn\u2019t figured these things out yet. However, the gazes of the school\u2019s leaders when looking toward Sun Mo had become interesting.Gao Ben continued to look at the front. However, he didn\u2019t care for small tricks like these. He felt that a person\u2019s teaching capability was what made them a teacher.Zhang Lan started to assess Sun Mo.Gu Xiuxun frowned. She tried to put herself in his shoes. If it was her, she\u2019d call her students over to prove herself. She\u2019d definitely not challenge Zhang Hanfu head-on.How rash must a person be to do something like this?\u201cHmmm? The vice-headmaster is rendered speechless? Your capabilities to express yourself and to adapt to situations aren\u2019t good enough. Could it be that when you made a speech in the past, you had to memorize it in advance?\u201dSun Mo smiled and asked.\u201cOh my god, he has such a sharp tongue!\u201dEven Ludi was shocked. Sun Mo was not someone who was willing to lose out. He secretly threw a glance at Zhang Hanfu and discovered that the latter\u2019s face had turned darker than ink.The other intern teachers were all astonished as well. This person was really brave to dare to taunt the vice-headmaster! Tsk, as expected, someone who had backing could do whatever they wished.\u201cSun Mo, that\u2019s enough.\u201dA middle-aged man with a sharp chin spoke up. He was called Feng Zewen and was assigned by Zhang Hanfu to be the person-in-charge of the freshman teachers. Seeing that Zhang Hanfu was in a stump, he naturally had to step up to salvage the situation.\u201cThen am I still required to prove myself?\u201dSun Mo looked at the man, noting his name down in his heart. Since this man was going to be Zhang Hanfu\u2019s lackey, then Sun Mo wouldn\u2019t stand on ceremony next time.\u201cNo need. From today onward, you, as well as Gao Ben and the others, will be an official teacher.\u201dFeng Zewen paused for a moment before adding, \u201cBut if we were to discover that you didn\u2019t have five personal disciples, then not only would the school fire you, but we\u2019ll also report to the Saint Gate and get all the schools in the nine provinces to blacklist you.\u201dSssss!Hearing this threat, everyone drew in a cold gasp. This was cutting off all routes for Sun Mo. Once reported, he wouldn\u2019t be able to have a chance to become a teacher again.Sun Mo nodded. He then looked at Zhang Hanfu and smiled. \u201cTeacher Zhang, we\u2019ll be colleagues from today onward. Please provide me with your guidance!\u201dSssss!Everyone looked at Sun Mo in great shock. He was still adding fuel to the flame? Did he really think that Zhang Hanfu was a pushover and didn\u2019t have a temper?The teachers addressed each other by adding \u2018Teacher\u2019 before their surnames, so there wasn\u2019t any problem with Sun Mo calling Zhang Hanfu as Teacher Zhang.However, at this moment, this form of address had an intense taunt to it and even a hint of challenge.(Weren\u2019t you doubting me?)(Didn\u2019t you want me to prove myself?)(Didn\u2019t you look down on my background?)(I\u2019ve become an official teacher in the Central Province Academy now, sharing the same status as you, calling you \u2018Teacher Zhang\u2019. Are you angry?)Pffft!Gu Xiuxun couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. She covered her mouth with her hand and broke out laughing.What could Zhang Hanfu do?Even if he was so angry that he was spurting blood, he had to gulp it down. Could he possibly say that Sun Mo wasn\u2019t fitting to address him as \u2018Teacher Zhang\u2019? Then it\u2019d mean that he was using his status as a vice-headmaster to pressurize someone else. If he were to accept this, then his words of suspecting Sun Mo would all be crap!Sun Mo was really someone who would either not do anything, or choose to deal a strong blow.Zhang Hanfu fell silent. It was because no matter what reply he gave, they\u2019d be wrong. Sun Mo might even grasp some loopholes and continue to attack him.With nowhere to vent his frustration, Zhang Hanfu turned and glared at Feng Zewen. (It\u2019s all your fault! Why are you so meddlesome?)Feng Zewen smiled bitterly. (Do you think that I wanted to do that?)Such matters were very straightforward. Sun Mo really had five students. Otherwise, he\u2019d have been given a bad shock.Lian Zheng, who had remained silent all this while, frowned. He didn\u2019t like Sun Mo\u2019s character. He was too bent on getting revenge, not even showing the basic respect to others. Even if Zhang Hanfu was in the wrong, he was still the vice-headmaster after all, a two-star great teacher. Moreover, he was also a senior. In his view, Sun Mo should show some basic courtesy.\u201cHmmm? It seems that Teacher Zhang really looks down on me, to be ignoring my question completely. Sigh, that\u2019s true. You\u2019re the vice-headmaster after all, you can throw your weight around!\u201dSun Mo taunted.Pffft!This time around, even An Xinhui, who had been watching silently, couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore. (Sun Mo, you\u2019re still going on? Are you planning on driving Zhang Hanfu to his death?)(But why does this feel so exhilarating? That\u2019s right, it\u2019s really a good vent after having been targeted by Zhang Hanfu for so long.)Ding!+1 favorable impression point from An Xinhui.Prestige connection with An Xinhui initiated: Neutral (1/100)The intern teachers were all speechless. They were very certain that Sun Mo and Zhang Hanfu were considered archenemies now. Sun Mo\u2019s days in the school would definitely not be good from today onward.However, it seemed that this guy wasn\u2019t concerned at all.Sun Mo returned to his seat, acting nonchalantly.He wouldn\u2019t accept such treatment. If someone thought of slandering him, then they must be prepared to receive three consecutive slaps on their face.The entire hall was filled with a strange atmosphere, and it was so silent. No, there were sounds\u2014the sound of Zhang Hanfu\u2019s angry puffing.Ding!+1 favorable impression point from Gu Xiuxun.Prestige connection with Gu Xiuxun initiated: Neutral (1/100)After receiving two consecutive reminders, Sun Mo was a little surprised. He could see why An Xinhui would be impressed. After all, she was Zhang Hanfu\u2019s enemy. But what was it with Gu Xiuxun? After thinking for a bit, Sun Mo recalled the description that she\u2019d feel excited about pain. Now, he could understand somehow.One shouldn\u2019t judge a masochist like they would a normal person.Although Zhang Sheng had been rejected by Gu Xiuxun, he didn\u2019t give up on her. Right now, he was seated on the second row behind her. He would normally admire Gu Xiuxun\u2019s graceful and beautiful back view to the fullest. But right now, he looked at Sun Mo with a dazed expression.Sun Mo had recruited five students?Sun Mo was employed officially as a substitute teacher?Sun Mo could be called \u2018Teacher Sun\u2019 from toward onward? What kind of joke was this? When this guy was in Songyang Academy, he was like an invisible existence no one knew about.If Zhang Sheng didn\u2019t hold on to his last hint of rationality, he would have jumped up to question Sun Mo, asking him what rights did he have?As someone from the same dorm, he had always maintained an absolute sense of superiority. He was someone whom they\u2019d grovel and curry up to. How could he lose out to Sun Mo now?Zhang Sheng was unable to accept such differences.Ludi didn\u2019t think so much. He was just surprised over how Sun Mo wasn\u2019t beaten to death after sneering at Zhang Hanfu. Vice-headmaster Zhang was well-known to have a bad temper, and it was normal to see him beat up others. To think that he had chosen to hold it in this time around?\u201cWow, Sun Mo has become an official teacher? How many hairs must I pluck and how many pork trotters must I braise for Teacher Zhou to get a good review and therefore this position?\u201dLudi started calculating.Seeing that the atmosphere was awkward, Lian Zheng spoke up, \u201cThe four of you stay behind. The rest can leave.\u201dThe intern teachers found this fact a little hard to take, and all of them quickly left the classroom. However, before they left, some of them couldn\u2019t help but look back to assess Sun Mo.They hadn\u2019t expected that this guy who sponged off a woman would be able to hide himself so well. He was really a schemer.\u201cScheming dog!\u201d One of them who was ordinarily ugly cursed, \u201cHe definitely made use of Headmaster An\u2019s reputation to recruit the five students!\u201d\u201cFor sure!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAn uglier one went along. If he didn\u2019t think this way, he would be mentally unstable. It was one thing to lose out to Gu Xiuxun and the other two, but who was Sun Mo?After Sun Mo received the official employment letter from the Central Province Academy, he would be a teacher recognized by the Saint Gate. His status and salary would both receive a tremendous increment.Ordinary intern teachers would still have to wait for another year before they got the chance to enjoy the similar treatment. If they were to make any mistakes during this time, all their previous efforts would go down the drain. How could they not feel jealous at the thought of this?Zeng Jun\u2019s gaze flickered and he slowed down his footsteps. Given his capability, the chances of him being able to stay in school weren\u2019t high if left to normal competition. However, there was a chance placed right before him now.[1] A play on Sun Mo\u2019s name, breaking up the \u2018Mo\u2019 to form the words \u2018black dog\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63: Teacher Sun, I Look upon You Highly\uff01After the intern teachers departed, the lecture theater immediately became empty.Lian Zheng initially planned to let Gu Xiuxun and the other three sit on the first row as it would be more convenient to talk. But when he saw their guarded expressions, he decided to give up.The interactions between arrogant geniuses were similar to the logic whereby two apex predators couldn\u2019t exist within the same hunting ground. They would view each other with hostility.\u201cIt\u2019s good like this too. With hostility toward each other, they wouldn\u2019t be willing to admit defeat and would think of ways to suppress their opponents in other aspects. This can also be considered a form of encouragement instead.\u201dLian Zheng was very satisfied with the reactions of these four. He felt that improvements would only be possible with competition.The school leaders also surveyed the four of them. There was no need to mention Gao Ben, Zhang Lan, and Gu Xiuxun. Their horizons were broad, so it was understandable that they could be calm. However, what was going on with the toxic Sun Mo? Why was he able to be so composed when he sat there?The crucial thing was that Zhang Hanfu hadn\u2019t left yet. Also, his anger hasn\u2019t dissipated in the slightest.Ever since the old headmaster failed to break through to the saint level, there wasn\u2019t anyone here to suppress Zhang Hanfu. He gradually gained more and more authority, and it was unknown how many teachers and students had been driven to tears by his scolding. In these three years, Sun Mo was absolutely the only one who could \u2018deflate\u2019 him.\u201cEither he has a vast heart that can endure extreme pressure or he is an idiot!\u201dFeng Zewen mumbled.\u201cHeadmaster An, do you want to give them the admonition talk?\u201dLian Zheng inquired.\u201cI\u2019ll let vice-headmaster Zhang do it!\u201dAn Xinhui modestly declined.\u201cHmph!\u201dZhang Hanfu initially didn\u2019t want to speak. This was because he was afraid that the moment he opened his mouth, he wouldn\u2019t be able to control it and would lash out at Sun Mo. However, he wouldn\u2019t give An Xinhui a chance to perform either. Hence, he replied, \u201cZewen, you do it!\u201d\u201cCough, cough. I will do this in your place then.\u201dFeng Zewen didn\u2019t decline. He cleared his throat. \u201cFirstly, I want to congratulate the four of you for joining the Central Province Academy and becoming a part of us!\u201dFeng Zewen applauded. The school leaders also clapped along politely, with Zhang Hanfu being the only exception.\u201cGood composure!\u201dLian Zheng silently praised after glancing at the four.In this type of occasion, normal intern teachers would be extremely emotional and there would be looks of joy on their faces when they heard that they managed to join the faculty. But these four, they were as calm as ever. It was as though this was something natural.\u201cAfter becoming official teachers, you guys can substitute the other teachers and give lessons. Because this is your first year, to let you all gradually adapt, the teaching missions given to you would be comparatively more simple.\u201cOther than guiding your personal students, each of you has to give public lessons every day that last for four hours. As for the content, you guys can decide yourself. Study of spirit runes, herbology, alchemy, you can choose anything you like. A week later, report your choices to me and I will arrange a time table and a classroom for you.\u201dFeng Zewen paused and after the four new teachers digested the information, he continued, \u201cAlthough you have the freedom of choice, please pick the topics you are proficient in.\u201cWhen you first start to give lessons, the number of students would surely be very little. Hence, we won\u2019t make that a requirement. But half a year later, this aspect will be considered a reference as part of the criteria. One year later, if the number cannot meet the standard, your public lessons will be axed.\u201dAs Feng Zewen spoke, his tone became solemn.A huge wave of pressure immediately gushed toward the four.In the various countries of the nine provinces of Middle-Earth, public classes were actually the mainstream thing.The teachers had the choice and authority to choose their specialty and lessons, and the students similarly had the freedom to choose which lectures they wished to attend.If a teacher could give a good lecture, the number of students listening would be abundant. Otherwise, that teacher\u2019s classes would be completely deserted. Hence, the number of students was taken as a criterion. If the number declined to the point where they hit the bottom line designated by the school, the public lectures given by that teacher would be axed.If teachers wanted to become great teachers, they had to \u2018slaughter\u2019 their way out of the cruel competition. It was absolutely impossible if they wanted to earn their salary with ease and comfort, muddling through things.It was precisely because of this mechanism that teachers would give it their all to explain things clearly and increase the quality of their lectures in order to attract students. From this, the students could also gain the most benefits.As long as the students paid attention and put in their effort, they absolutely didn\u2019t need to worry about their teachers slacking off. Those teachers who couldn\u2019t meet the standards would already be eliminated by then.\u201cThe Central Province Academy is really awesome!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. Although he had just been a teacher in charge of modern physical education in the No.2 High School, he was still filled with admiration toward this teaching method.Whether the teachers were capable or not, whether they were qualified for their jobs, these things weren\u2019t something the school or the education bureau could determine. Not even family background or having many social connections would help. The only thing that determined one\u2019s worth as a teacher was their students. This was the only fair evaluation!\u201cSystem, by the way, am I not childhood sweethearts with An Xinhui? Why does our favorable impression index start from neutral?\u201dSun Mo had a question.\u201cThe original consciousness of this body is then the childhood sweetheart of An Xinhui and you are not,\u201d the system explained.That consciousness already died, and the one standing here was Sun Mo from another world. This was why the system wanted to recalculate the favorable impression index.When the actions of the host caused the targets to generate favorable impressions such as closeness, being impressed, being worshipped, the host would gain favorable impression points.The favorable impression index represented the change in a relationship between two people. However, the other more important function was that it could be used as a type of currency to purchase items from the merchant store.Hence, the favorable impression between Sun Mo and An Xinhui naturally had to start afresh.Gu Xiuxun raised her hand.\u201cTeacher Gu, please speak!\u201dFeng Zewen was very indulgent toward beauties.\u201cTeacher Feng, if we pick a specialty and find it to be unsuitable half-way, can we still change it?\u201dGu Xiuxun inquired.\u201cSure!\u201dFeng Zewen glanced at this beautiful campus queen and silently compared her with An Xinhui in his heart. \u201cBut I have to warn you that the reputation of a teacher is built up slowly through accumulation. If you change your lesson specialty, you might lose all the popularity you have worked hard to gain.\u201d\u201cThank you, Teacher Feng!\u201dGiven Gu Xiuxun\u2019s intelligence, she had long since thought of this point. By asking a question now, she only wanted to call out \u2018Teacher Feng\u2019 in such an official setting and hear other teachers calling her \u2018Teacher Gu\u2019.(This is the relationship between colleagues of equal status. This type of cool greeting is truly awesome. From now onward, I\u2019m also a teacher!)Gu Xiuxun\u2019s right hand, which was under the table, was clenched into a fist due to her excitement. She had achieved her first step. Next, she would try her best to become a leading character out of all the unranked teachers!Unranked teachers referred to teachers who couldn\u2019t become 1-star great teachers due to various reasons.\u201cNext, our Central Province Academy has a tradition that has been passed down for a thousand years.\u201d Feng Zewen laughed. \u201cEach newly joined teacher will share their teaching philosophy, their life goals, specialties, etc\u2026 for your first public lesson. You can say anything you want\u2026\u201dGu Xiuxun and the other three were originally indifferent. But as they listened to Feng Zewen\u2019s next sentence, their expressions were no longer as calm as before.\u201cFor the first public lesson, it will be conducted in a lecture theater, and we will inform the teachers and students of the entire school. You can almost be certain that in the lecture theater of 300 seats, it will be packed to the brim. However, the greatest test isn\u2019t this. Any students or teachers there would have the authority to ask you questions on anything. If you cannot answer them or if your adaptability is too weak, you will shame yourself, resulting in much embarrassment.\u201dThe gazes of the school leaders subconsciously drifted to Sun Mo. Other than Gao Ben who was sitting upright and still, Gu Xiuxun and Zhang Lan also couldn\u2019t help but survey Sun Mo.No matter what methods Sun Mo had used to recruit five students, it was meaningless. The first public lesson was the true battlefield.If one didn\u2019t have true capabilities, it would be very apparent once they were probed.\u201cTeacher Sun, I look upon you highly!\u201dFeng Zewen was praising him on the surface, but since he belonged to Zhang Hanfu\u2019s faction, everyone could tell the sarcastic intent in his words.Zhang Hanfu coldly smiled. Sun Mo was An Xinhui\u2019s fiance. With this identity, there would surely be many teachers interested in probing him at that time.Those teachers who hated him because of envy would surely use the opportunity to find trouble with him.\u201cTeacher Feng. Since this is the case, you have to prepare a few questions to test me. If you fail to trip me up, how about treating me to three months worth of meals?\u201d Sun Mo spoke.\u201cEh?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s sudden reply stunned everyone. No one expected him to respond, let alone responding in such an unyielding manner.(Don\u2019t you guys want to watch a good show? Bring it on then. I\u2019ll accept the challenge!)An Xinhui\u2019s beautiful eyes brightened. She felt like she no longer recognized this childhood sweetheart of hers. Regardless of his capability, just his aura alone was sufficient for her to praise him.Ding!Favorable impression points from An Xinhui +1Prestige connection with An Xinhui: Neutral (2/100).Feng Zewen startled. His smile froze and he felt a little unhappy. (Who do you think you are to dare to provoke me?)Given the current situation, it wasn\u2019t too good for him to vent his unhappiness. After all, he was the one who said that first. Hence, he could only put on a fake smile.\u201cSure. At that time, I will be sure to prepare some good meals for you. However, if you fail, you don\u2019t have to treat me to anything. Just buy three vats of grape brew for me from the Ruyi Bazaar.\u201d\u201cTeacher Feng, the grape brew from the Ruyi Bazaar costs a few thousand taels of silver per vat. Sun Mo has just joined the school, how would he have the money to buy them for you?\u201dAn Xinhui interjected.\u201cWouldn\u2019t there be no problem as long as he wins?\u201dZhang Hanfu interrupted.Feng Zewen felt somewhat depressed. Even if Sun Mo hadn\u2019t angered Zhang Hanfu today, the vice-headmaster would still get people to find trouble with him. But now, this task seemed to have fallen onto Feng Zewen shoulders.(No matter what, I\u2019m a 1-star great teacher. You are asking me to personally teach him a lesson? Zhang Hanfu, do you really have the face to do that?)It wasn\u2019t that Feng Zewen didn\u2019t dare to offend An Xinhui. Rather, he felt that he had been belittled. A 1-star teacher against a new teacher like Sun Mo?Truly, this was using the dragon-slaying saber to kill a weak chicken!\u201cSince this is the case, the bet is established. However, if Teacher Feng loses, he should also buy three vats of grape brew for Teacher Sun.\u201dGu Xiuxun commented, not feeling scared at all. She decided that at Sun Mo\u2019s public lecture, she had to be present for sure.At that time, when Sun Mo failed to answer the questions, she would step out and save the day. By doing so, she would definitely be able to win over all the students and teachers, letting them know how outstanding she, Gu Xiuxun, was.Even before Feng Zewen could say anything, Sun Mo already spoke, \u201cLet\u2019s do it like that then. Teacher Feng wouldn\u2019t be afraid, right?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s personality was one where he would never allow himself to suffer any losses. He just wanted to raise the stakes and Gu Xiuxun had already helped him.Their gazes then clashed in mid-air.(Sorry, you should just become my stepping stone!)Gu Xiuxun was thinking about her beautiful future, but she also had to admit that since Sun Mo was daring enough to provoke a 1-star great teacher, his courage was truly commendable.Ding!Favorable impression from Gu Xiuxun +1Prestige connection with Gu Xiuxun: Neutral (2/100)Upon hearing the notification, Sun Mo then glanced toward Zhang Lan and Gao Ben. As expected, the two of them had no reactions, completely ignoring him.Ding!\u201cNew mission issued. During your first public lesson, please perfectly handle all the students and teachers who intend on making things difficult for you and obtain a beautiful debut. If the results are good, you will be rewarded.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNote: If your performance is too bad, there will be a punishment!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still a punishment?\u201dSun Mo was speechless. He could imagine the scene where those male teachers were doing their best to make things difficult for him. All of them wanted to prove he was trash and not worthy of An Xinhui.One could say that the challenge he had to face had difficulty several times higher compared to Gu Xiuxun and the other two\u2019s.Just when Sun Mo was contemplating this, the system voice rang out once more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64: Sun Mo, First Level of Blood-ignition, Please Guide Me!Ding!\u201cMission issued. Please gain victory for the bet between you and Feng Zewen. Reward: 1x silver treasure chest!\u201dUpon seeing such a good reward, Sun Mo knew that it would be more difficult to win against Feng Zewen.Ding!\u201cMission issued. During the first public lecture, do your best to win against Gu Xiuxun, Gao Ben, and Zhang Lan. The more people you win, the better the reward will be.\u201d\u201cSo, it is either you don\u2019t give a mission or you give three at one go, huh?\u201dSun Mo mocked.\u201cIf you are not confident, I can take back the third mission.\u201dThis mission was a floating one. If Sun Mo couldn\u2019t even win against one of the new teachers, there wouldn\u2019t be any rewards.\u201cNo need, what\u2019s the point of life if there are no challenges?\u201d Sun Mo laughed lightly. \u201cJust clean the treasure chests properly and wait for me to claim them!\u201d\u201cAlright then! I\u2019ve said all that\u2019s needed to be said. We are filled with anticipation for your performances three days later. Headmaster An, and Vice-Headmaster Zhang, do you guys have anything else to add?\u201d Feng Zewen asked.\u201cPerform well and show us why you guys are elites. Alright, let the meeting disperse!\u201dAfter Zhang Hanfu finished speaking, he directly announced the meeting was over. He basically didn\u2019t want to give An Xinhui any chance to speak.Gao Ben stood up, Zhang Lan hesitated, while Gu Xiuxun remained seated. All of them turned their gaze onto An Xinhui. As for Sun Mo, he directly stood up and left from the backdoor.The school leaders all saw this scene clearly. They had heard about Gu Xiuxun\u2019s feeling of worship for An Xinhui. Now, it seemed that it was true. As for Zhang Lan, she was clearly neutral. Only Sun Mo\u2019s reactions astonished everyone. By logic, he should have remained seated and waited for An Xinhui.However, Sun Mo naturally wouldn\u2019t care much about An Xinhui.Although he melded with the original self\u2019s memories and feelings and would feel his heart stir when he saw An Xinhui, he knew that this wasn\u2019t his true feelings.There were two reasons why Sun Mo stayed in the Central Province Academy.Firstly, it was because of prudence. He had just arrived in this new world and wasn\u2019t familiar with the basic laws and rules of society yet. What would happen if he accidentally let the cat out from the bag that he was from another world?Flexing hard like some of the characters he read in novels? That wasn\u2019t his Sun Mo\u2019s style. Did they feel that they wouldn\u2019t die fast enough? Sun Mo\u2019s style was to slowly grow in a familiar environment before extending his feelers out to probe the world.If he didn\u2019t want others to discover something off about him, this should be the most correct method. He had to quickly get familiar with this world and truly integrate with it.Secondly, it was to complete the mission the system had issued and help the Central Province Academy rise.Sun Mo wanted to get the reward and return to his original world.It was one thing that he had no AV films to watch or games he could play, but he felt like dying when he thought of his expensive new computer that was waiting for him in his world. How could he endure this?As for his family, Sun Mo didn\u2019t dare to think about them. He was afraid he might cry.Naturally, Sun Mo also felt some anger. Everyone kept calling him the \u2018soft-rice guy\u2019 and shot looks of contempt at him while disdaining him privately as well.Given Sun Mo\u2019s personality, it would be a wonder if he could endure it.Sun Mo wouldn\u2019t rebut it using words, but he would use practical actions to shut these people up. He wanted to make them envy him even more.In that case, what should he do?Naturally, he had to do his best and become a great teacher as quickly as possible. He had to become the number one great teacher in Jinling!Sun Mo had the confidence due to him possessing the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art, Divine Sight, and Immemorial Vairocana.After leaving the classroom, Sun Mo was prepared to look for Lu Zhiruo to pat the papaya girl\u2019s head. It was to raise his luck before opening the treasure chest, which he had obtained as a reward from improving the prestige connection between him and Li Gong to the friendly level.After he walked a few steps, a male intern teacher stopped him.\u201cSun Mo, I\u2019ve long since admired your name. I wish to seek guidance from you!\u201dZeng Jun spoke while looking straight at Sun Mo. Although his words were humble, his expression was filled with provocation.At this moment, there were thirty other intern teachers milling around in the corridor. Some of them were here because they wanted the school leaders to remember their faces, while others had the same thoughts as Zeng Jun. They wanted to use Sun Mo as a stepping stone to climb up.\u201cDamn, the opportunity was snatched.\u201dAn ugly-looking intern teacher felt depressed. Earlier, during the meeting, Sun Mo publicly angered Zhang Hanfu, and the latter would surely be extremely offended by it.If one could use this opportunity to spar against Sun Mo and teach him a lesson by beating him up, that person would surely obtain a favorable impression of Zhang Hanfu.These intern teachers had ordinary capabilities. If they wanted to get a slot through normal competition, it would be somewhat difficult. Hence, they began to think of some other devious means.Zhang Hanfu walked out. Upon hearing this, he cast a glance at Feng Zewen who was standing behind him.\u201cMe again?\u201dFeng Zewen was very unhappy. (Stop asking me to do such things alright? I feel like a servant now.) But even so, he still spoke out.\u201cHow about competing in a sparring match? We can admire Teacher Sun\u2019s glory better in this manner,\u201d Feng Zewen spoke.Upon hearing this and seeing Zhang Hanfu\u2019s attention, Zeng Jun felt even more emboldened. His tone was no longer respectful. \u201cTeacher Sun, please guide me!\u201dAn Xinhui and a group of people just came out and coincidentally saw this scene.For a time, the gazes of everyone in the corridor turned to Sun Mo.Sun Mo stared at Zeng Jun as he activated Divine Sight.=====Zeng Jun, 21 years old. Someone at the second level of the blood-ignition realm.Strength 22, ordinary standard.Intellect 23, below average to ordinary standard.Agility 22, ordinary standard.Will 20, unable to suffer much hardship. He depended on his innate talent to achieve his current accomplishments, but he is destined not to achieve anything much in the future.Endurance 27, young and fit, able to last seven times per night.Potential: above averageNote: A fellow who is always thinking of taking shortcuts. There\u2019s no need to attach any value to him, f*** him!=====\u201cSystem, there\u2019s no need to belittle people so much, right? By evaluating him like this, I wouldn\u2019t feel any satisfaction even if I won against him!\u201dSun Mo was speechless. When he played games, the thing he hated most was to kill the cannon fodders.\u201cPlease note that this is only the evaluation with regards to Zeng Jun\u2019s talent. His true strength isn\u2019t weak. If you judged his combat strength based on these stats, you would definitely be the one suffering a disadvantage.\u201dThe system solemnly warned.How inferior could a teacher with a potential value of above average be?Above the body-refinement realm was the spirit-refinement realm. After opening up the 108 acupoints, they could then step into the blood-ignition realm.In this realm, one\u2019s blood would be ignited, and the flames would burn within one\u2019s body, cleansing it of impurities. Ultimately, one would end up shedding their old mortal body and bones, gain divine strength, and eventually step into the divine force realm.There were seven levels in the blood-ignition realm. Cultivators had to ignite their blood seven times and each time, they would undergo a qualitative transformation.\u201cUnderstood!\u201dRight now, Sun Mo had only ignited his blood once. He truly didn\u2019t have the capital to look down on others.\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t dare to fight now?\u201dSeeing that Sun Mo didn\u2019t reply, Zeng Jun took a step forward and pressed his face closer to Sun Mo while continuing to provoke the latter.Sun Mo took a step back. He stretched out his hand and fanned the area before his nose. \u201cPlease move further away from me. Your mouth is too smelly!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dZeng Jun was almost angered to death. If it wasn\u2019t for him maintaining his last bit of rationality, he would have smacked Sun Mo\u2019s mouth rotten.\u201cOi, stop your verbal attacks, come and fight me!\u201dIt was a simple case of reverse psychology.\u201cSun Mo, so many people are watching. You won\u2019t flee, right?Zhang Sheng sneered, wanting nothing more than to see Sun Mo embarrass himself.(When have I ever said that I wanted to flee?)Sun Mo replied, \u201cHis mouth is smelly, yet he doesn\u2019t allow others to speak. What is this?\u201d\u201cYou are the one whose mouth is smelly, your whole family has smelly mouths!\u201d Zeng Jun cursed loudly.\u201cZeng Jun, Sun Mo is trying to wage a psychological battle with his words. Don\u2019t be fooled,\u201d Feng Zewen reminded him.From the looks of how Sun Mo usually acted, he was someone with a strong personality. When facing a challenge, he would absolutely not retreat. Moreover, in a situation where An Xinhui was present, he would definitely not cower back, or where would his face be?Hence, seeing that he didn\u2019t agree even after some time, it was clear that he was playing a psychological battle.At this time, observing the opponent carefully while retaining one\u2019s rationale was the most correct method.After hearing Feng Zewen\u2019s words, the hearts of the intern teachers in the surroundings all thumped. Some of them who originally looked down on Sun Mo immediately corrected their attitude.\u201cIs it real or fake?\u201dZhang Sheng didn\u2019t feel that Sun Mo had such intelligence. However, Feng Zewen was a 1-star great teacher, so his judgment couldn\u2019t be wrong, right?An Xinhui also grew increasingly curious about this childhood sweetheart of hers.\u201cNo matter how many psychological battles you wage, it will be useless if your actual strength doesn\u2019t make the mark!\u201d Gu Xiuxun\u2019s lips curled.Zeng Jun started. After that, his gaze became serious when he looked at Sun Mo again. Also, his earlier impatient attitude changed.\u201cSun Mo, do you dare to fight or not? Just tell me the answer. There\u2019s no need to play any tricks!\u201dZeng Jun sneered.\u201cSure. But we don\u2019t need to walk too far. We can simply decide the victor at the public square in front of the teaching building!\u201dSun Mo calmly spoke. However, his eyes glanced toward Feng Zewen instead. This person could see through his purpose with a glance. His judgment wasn\u2019t bad.=====Feng Zewen, 31 years old. Sixth level of the blood-ignition realm.Strength 27, strength isn\u2019t your strong point, but there are no problems for you to kill a savage beast bare-handed.Intellect 26, insufficient. This is also the reason why you are stuck at the 1-star rank.Agility 29, you are pretty fast, able to chase the clouds and moon.Endurance 30, there are no problems even if you were to work every day continuously for an entire week.Potential value: above averageNote: Too many distractions in your mind. If your thoughts could be slightly purer, you might have broken through your bottleneck long ago.=====Sun Mo analyzed the data. Endurance was Feng Zewen\u2019s strong point. Hence, if he were to fight against Feng Zewen, he had to do his best to avoid a prolonged battle.\u201cSystem, this \u2018Intellect\u2019, it doesn\u2019t simply refer to the upgrade of one\u2019s intelligence quotient, right?\u201dSun Mo analyzed. If one\u2019s intelligence quotient kept going up due to breakthroughs in cultivation, wouldn\u2019t that person end up smarter than Einstein?\u201cThat\u2019s right, you can understand the \u2018Intellect\u2019 here as comprehension ability. It represents the amount of brain region one has developed. The more one\u2019s brain region is developed, the more their memory power, understanding power, comprehension ability, analysis speed, etc\u2026 would be upgraded. It doesn\u2019t refer to IQ,\u201d the system explained.\u201cIntellect is different from strength. You will be able to exert all your strength easily, but it won\u2019t be so easy for you to exert all your intellect. One needs talent for that.\u201dSun Mo understood. In history, there were people who reached einstein\u2019s level of IQ. But no matter who they were, their accomplishments weren\u2019t as high as his. This was because they weren\u2019t able to unleash the same level of their intellect.For some people, even if you maxed out their intellect, they might still be mediocre.Feng Zewen was at the sixth level of the blood-ignition realm. His cultivation base didn\u2019t seem to be high, but one must know that a great teacher wasn\u2019t the same as those cultivators who only pursued martial dao. It was fine as long as they concentrated on their cultivation, but they also had to study unceasingly and delve into their specialization. Just these alone would take up much of their time.However, the status of a great teacher was definitely more noble compared to cultivators. Leaving aside profound knowledge, just their act of imparting knowledge and educating others was enough for them to gain the respect and courtesy from others in the world.After all, even for emperors, kings, generals, ministers, sword heroes, and spear saints\u2026they would have descendants too. Their descendants would still need the guidance of great teachers. What? The sword heroes and spear saints could guide their descendants themselves? What if their descendants had no talent in the same field as them? What if their descendant wished to become a spirit rune master or a beast tamer?Ding!\u201cMission issued. Please defeat Zeng Jun. Reward: 1x black-iron treasure chest!\u201dThe system was encouraging Sun Mo to give it his all.Right now, there were already over 500 people gathered at the public square before the teaching building. Some students came over upon hearing the commotion.\u201cSun Mo, what weapon will you use?\u201dAs the year head, Lian Zheng took the initiative to be the referee.\u201cThis will do!\u201dSun Mo brandished the wooden blade in his hands.\u201cSun Mo, you better change your weapon. Later on, if I cripple you, don\u2019t blame me!\u201dZeng Jun took out a two-feet-long swift blade. Under the sunlight, it exuded a biting cold killing qi.\u201cNo need!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t care. In any case, he hadn\u2019t used any weapons before. Thus, he chose this wooden blade that had accompanied him for several days. It was quite handy.Oh yea, this was also a spirit weapon.An Xinhui wanted to say something to warn him, but she eventually bore the impulse. (Forget it, before he gets injured, I will step out to stop Zeng Jun.)\u201cAre the two of you ready? If you have no objections, you can start anytime!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter Lian Zheng finished speaking, he retreated out of the public square.\u201cZeng Jun, second level of blood-ignition realm. Please guide me!\u201dZeng Jun spoke with confidence. Because Zhang Hanfu was in the crowd, he felt extremely excited. As long as he defeated Sun Mo, he would definitely be able to gain Zhang Hanfu\u2019s appreciation.\u201cSun Mo, first-level of blood-ignition realm. Please guide me!\u201dThis was the first time Sun Mo said something like that. He felt a little strange and regretful. His first opponent was actually a man with many blackheads on his face. This wasn\u2019t worthy of remembrance at all!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65: Crushing, Divine SkillAfter hearing the two of them report their cultivation level, the spectators began to discuss softly, but they weren\u2019t too shocked.In the Middle-Earth Nine Provinces, sparring combat between two people could proceed as long as the difference in cultivation bases didn\u2019t surpass three minor levels.If it was any higher, the sparring combat wouldn\u2019t have any meaning because one of the combatants wouldn\u2019t need to show any technique. They could simply use brute force to suppress their opponent.Zeng Jun was already very confident. Now when he heard that Sun Mo was merely at the first level of blood-ignition, he felt even more so. He displayed the look of an expert and waggled the tip of his blade at Sun Mo.\u201cTeacher Sun, you can attack first!\u201dXuanyuan Po was extremely interested in combat. He pushed his way through the crowd upon seeing the situation and after hearing Sun Mo\u2019s name.\u201cYou can go first!\u201dSun Mo humbly declined. He silently praised Zeng Jun\u2019s posturing. Through Divine Sight, the data showed that Zeng Jun was cultivating the Shattered Soul Blade Art and was proficient in defense.This meant that Zeng Jun\u2019s battle technique lay in defending and counter-attacking. If Sun Mo attacked first, it would benefit Zeng Jun instead.\u201cSun Mo, my cultivation base is higher than yours, you can attack first.\u201dZeng Jun laughed, showing everyone his magnanimous attitude.\u201cAlright then. I won\u2019t tell anyone that you are proficient in defense,\u201d Sun Mo spoke bluntly.A clamor rang out.The smile on Zeng Jun\u2019s face stiffened as he felt shocked in his heart. How did this brat know what he was good at? No one could just tell by glancing at him, right?Sun Mo wasn\u2019t a great teacher, how could his judgment be so good?Just when Zeng Jun was thinking about how to rebut Sun Mo and whether he should take the initiative to attack first, Sun Mo already acted. Sun Mo\u2019s attack was like a sharp arrow shooting over!Ding!The black sandalwood wooden blade and swift blade collided.\u201cCunning!\u201dGu Xiuxun\u2019s lips twitched. From Zeng Jun\u2019s minute expressions, she could tell that Sun Mo was right. But evidently, Sun Mo didn\u2019t care about attacking first or second. In other words, it meant that his words earlier were to distract Zeng Jun and launch a sneak attack.\u201cChe, just a minor trick!\u201dGao Ben was filled with disdain.Zhang Lan\u2019s face was still devoid of expressions.Successfully taking the initiative, Sun Mo\u2019s wooden blade manifested a patch of blade shadows that enveloped Zeng Jun.Sun Mo\u2019s body had cultivated the Overflow Rain Sword for roughly seven years, and the sword technique had integrated into his instincts. This was why Sun Mo could casually unleash it.Zeng Jun had lost the first-mover advantage and was also a little nervous. In the end, after exchanging a few blows, he began to relax. Sun Mo\u2019s attack had no strength at all.(I can win easily!)Zeng Jun was instantly filled with confidence once more. He wasn\u2019t in a hurry to attack and was waiting for the best chance to insta-defeat Sun Mo in a single strike.Yes. He didn\u2019t want to simply win. He wanted to win beautifully so everyone would cheer for him.The majority of the students gathered over to watch a good show. However, given the judgment of the school leaders, they could already judge who would win or lose. So, their facial expressions were all different based on the faction they supported.\u201cHe is quite good with his words, but it turns out that he is nothing but trash!\u201dFeng Zewen didn\u2019t expect Sun Mo to be so weak. His Overflow Rain Sword wasn\u2019t bad. But if he wanted to win depending on that, it was far from sufficient.Zhang Hanfu crossed his arms before his chest, waiting for Sun Mo to be defeated. He understood Zeng Jun\u2019s intentions. However, winning Zhang Hanfu\u2019s appreciation was not an easy task. Unless of course, Zeng Jun decided to cripple Sun Mo\u2019s limbs.However, An Xinhui would definitely prevent that!Zhang Hanfu\u2019s attention was focused on An Xinhui. He would definitely stop her. In other words, it meant that Sun Mo would have to be crippled so he could vent his anger.During these three years, no one had dared to speak that way to him. Sun Mo had to pay the price for his arrogance.Lian Zheng shook his head imperceptibly. There was no way for Sun Mo to win.Honestly speaking, Xuanyuan Po felt a little disappointed when he saw the situation. No matter how imposing Sun Mo\u2019s manner was, if his strength was only this much, it was simply not enough.An Xinhui didn\u2019t say anything. No one knew what she was thinking about.The spectators also fell silent, and only the sounds of weapons clanging could be heard.\u201cIs this the feeling of combat?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s heart throbbed uncontrollably, and he felt a sense of excitement appearing in his heart. This sense of excitement spread throughout his body, making him feel like throwing his head back and roaring.As a man, how could he not love combat?In the past, Sun Mo had only experienced the pleasure of combat through games and movies. But now, he could personally enjoy it.The sharp edge of his opponent\u2019s blade slashed past his nose, emitting the sense of death. The metallic clean sounds of the weapons clashing were deafening, causing his adrenaline to surge like an erupting volcano.(Yes, it is this feeling exactly!)There was no need to care about schemes or put in the effort to maintain interpersonal relations. Everything could be solved by combat!Simple!Pure!One could live casually and freely.At this moment, Sun Mo experienced an unprecedented feeling of freedom.His wooden blade and his ultimate cultivation art were his capital. (What? Are you not convinced? I\u2019ll beat you till you do!)After a short daze, Sun Mo regained his focus. He stared at Zeng Jun\u2019s face that was full of blackheads as he began laughing.His pearly white teeth shone so brightly that they dazzled Zeng Jun\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhat the hell are you laughing at?\u201dZeng Jun was frustrated. (Given your strength, I can fight three of you at the same time with no problem at all!)Sun Mo\u2019s laughter provoked Zeng Jun, who decided not to wait anymore. But right when he was about to retaliate, Sun Mo\u2019s attacks abruptly changed.Beauty Yu! (movement technique)Water dragon roar!Swish! Swish! Swish!Sun Mo\u2019s movements suddenly became graceful and ethereal. When he slashed his wooden blade out, sounds of roaring could be heard from each of his attacks.Eighteen Words Order!Pak! Pak! Pak!The wooden blade\u2019s attacks grew swifter and swifter, slashing toward Zeng Jun.Zeng Jun felt the pressure on him increasingly greatly, and he couldn\u2019t retaliate at all.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe first to react was the school leaders. Feng Zewen and Liang Zheng widened their eyes in surprise as they stared at Sun Mo.\u201cWhat cultivation art is this?\u201d Zhang Hanfu frowned.An Xinhui also felt a sense of admiration and bewilderment. How could her childhood sweetheart know such a powerful art?Sun Mo was currently brandishing his blade and unleashing multiple attacks. He was like a scholar flicking his brush, elegantly writing out beautiful calligraphy with confidence and ease.His light blue robes fluttered gently in the wind, seemingly flowing with immortal qi.\u201cEh?\u201dBoth Gu Xiuxun and Zhang Lan let out sounds of exclamation. Why was Sun Mo suddenly so powerful?What the spectators saw was the scene of Sun Mo violently attacking Zeng Jun. But in Sun Mo\u2019s eyes, another scene was playing out.When his wooden blade came in contact with Zeng Jun\u2019s body, Zeng Jun\u2019s head would let out a thudding sound and emit a golden facula. At the same time, a golden page would be generated from his head.These golden pages seemed extremely delicate. They were as light as feathers and simply hung suspended in the air.\u201cMy divine skill is so awesome!\u201dSun Mo praised this greatly in his heart. This was none other than the Immemorial Vairocana, an ultimate unique art that only Sun Mo possessed.After being hit by this divine skill, the target\u2019s head would generate a page that listed the cultivation arts of the target.Because it was still at the elementary-grade, the content on each page was very little and they might not all belong to the same art. However, even if it was so, Sun Mo didn\u2019t care. Right now, he was purely enjoying the feeling of combat.Zeng Jun wanted to retaliate, but he basically couldn\u2019t find a chance. Sun Mo\u2019s attacks were too concentrated. Since there were no solutions to it, Zeng Jun could only continue to defend.\u201cHow do you feel now?\u201dAfter Sun Mo asked, his wrist moved. The wooden blade moved like a poisonous snake, coming at a strange arc. It suddenly stabbed toward Zeng Jun\u2019s lips.Swish!Upon seeing the tip of the blade shooting toward him like a flash, Zeng Jun was so alarmed that he perspired cold sweat. He could only retreat with haste to lengthen the distance between them.Sun Mo lunged forward like a savage beast. His movements caused the clods of earth and dust to be kicked up as the pressure on Zeng Jun mounted.Crows Crying at Night!Colors of Autumn!Swish!Sun Mo\u2019s wooden blade slashed out. In that instant, in Zeng Jun\u2019s vision, that black-colored wooden blade created a dark curtain that covered the entire sky, blotting out his vision of the world.And at the next instant, he felt himself being flung through the air. There was an immense pain from his chest.Bang!Zeng Jun fell onto the ground and coughed out a large mouthful of blood.Everyone fell completely silent. Let alone the students, even the teachers didn\u2019t expect Sun Mo to win so easily!\u201cHow is this possible?\u201dLudi was dumbfounded. Sun Mo actually won?\u201cWhat kind of cultivation art is that? It\u2019s so powerful!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it. Has Teacher Liu seen it before?\u201d\u201cNope!\u201dThe teachers didn\u2019t really care about who won or lost. Instead, they felt more curiosity toward Sun Mo\u2019s cultivation art. That was definitely the reason for his victory.\u201cWho is that teacher?\u201dThe students who came later didn\u2019t recognize Sun Mo.\u201cHe is Teacher Sun Mo!\u201dAfter someone replied, several gazes turned toward Sun Mo.An Xinhui applauded and a smile of surprise and gratification appeared on her face. This childhood sweetheart of hers caused her to see him in a new light once again.Ding!Favorable impression from An Xinhui +1.Prestige connection with An Xinhui: Neutral (3/100).Upon hearing the notification from the system, Sun Mo cast a glance at An Xinhui. Very good. Although she had no expression on her face and merely nodded at him, the system notification proved that she wasn\u2019t as cold as she appeared to be.\u201cCould An Xinhui be a tsundere?\u201dSun Mo speculated.\u201cI lost? I lost so easily?\u201dZeng Jun was on the ground, and his face was filled with disbelief. He hadn\u2019t unleashed his ultimate skill yet, why did he already lose? What did Sun Mo do? He completely couldn\u2019t see it clearly.Sun Mo spun the wooden blade and inserted it back on the belt beside his waist.\u201cThanks for letting me win!\u201dThese words caused Zeng Jun\u2019s face to turn pale immediately. Even his blackheads almost turned white.Zeng Jun\u2019s lips trembled. He glanced at Zhang Hanfu only to see the latter flicking his sleeves and leaving. After that, he felt nothing but despair.Because he knew that he was finished, he planned to cripple Sun Mo in an attempt to gain Zhang Hanfu\u2019s appreciation. However, he had lost the duel.\u201cI\u2019m clearly at the second level of blood-ignition and is a level higher than you. How could I have lost?\u201dZeng Jun bellowed in rage. He felt that he didn\u2019t even have time to display his ultimate skill, and he truly lost unjustly.Sun Mo naturally wouldn\u2019t bother replying. He casually made a gesture and those golden pages flew over to him as they compiled into a book.\u201cWhat does Sun Mo\u2019s gesture mean?\u201dZhang Lan didn\u2019t understand.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s some sort of ritual?\u201dGu Xiuxun guessed.\u201cMy teacher is awesome!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXuanyuan Po was amazed. As a man who loved combat, his instincts told him that the power of Sun Mo\u2019s ultimate skill was extremely great.Ding!Favorable impression from Xuanyuan Po +1.Prestige connection with Xuanyuan Po established. Current state: Neutral (1/100).Upon hearing this, Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help but incline his head to search for Xuanyuan Po\u2019s figure in the crowd. Excellent, the prestige connection with this combat addict was finally unlocked. It seemed that only by displaying talent in combat could he gain the admiration of Xuanyuan Po.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66: An Xinhui\u2019s Praise\u201cInteresting!\u201dGao Ben stroked his chin before turning to leave. Sun Mo\u2019s combat strength was ordinary, but his cultivation art seemed to be quite powerful. Nevertheless, he thought that Sun Mo was still far from sufficient to face him.To Gao Ben, he basically didn\u2019t have Sun Mo in his eyes. Liu Mubai was then his true opponent. As for Gu Xiuxun and Zhang Lan, they could only be considered half-opponents to him.Right now, all of Gao Ben\u2019s focus was placed on the first public lecture. He had to make his preparations and amaze everyone three days later.Gu Xiuxun had planned to leave. But when she saw An Xinhui walking toward Sun Mo, she also came over.\u201cWell done.\u201dAn Xinhui praised him with a smile in her eyes. Her voice had more gentleness and less pressure compared to before.\u201cMn!\u201dSun Mo casually responded. He didn\u2019t feel abnormally happy after getting the praise from his fiance.The people in the surroundings were slowly dispersing. But when those male teachers saw two great beauties standing beside Sun Mo, their eyes almost turned green from envy.Luckily, Sun Mo could only eat one at most. No, maybe he couldn\u2019t even eat any of them!\u201cSun Mo, I know you are prideful. However, you shouldn\u2019t clash head-on against Feng Zewen. No matter what, he is still a 1-star great teacher and is determined to make things difficult for you. You would suffer a disadvantage.\u201dGu Xiuxun had a relatively good impression of Sun Mo. Hence, she tried to persuade him in passing. Sometimes, one had to learn when to retreat.\u201cIf I don\u2019t call out Feng Zewen, would Zhang Hanfu spare me?\u201dSun Mo counter-asked.Gu Xiuxun\u2019s lips twitched. She silently mused \u2018I\u2019m warning you out of goodwill, what type of attitude is this?\u2019 However, when she saw the look of praise on An Xinhui\u2019s face, Gu Xiuxun\u2019s expression immediately turned to one of shock.\u201cDid I miss something out?\u201dGu Xiuxun pondered.\u201cI\u2019m leaving!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t wish to waste time talking nonsense here. Thus, he waved his hands and turned to depart.\u201cEh?\u201dGu Xiuxun started. In the past, males would always find chances to get near her. Yet, this man actually ignored her to this extent? \u201cHmph, he must be playing mind games!\u201dAn Xinhui had a puzzled look in her eyes. She found that she understood her childhood sweetheart lesser and lesser.\u201cHeadmaster An, do you feel that he should clash against Feng Zewen?\u201d Gu Xiuxun asked the question that was bewildering her.\u201cYes.\u201dAn Xinhui nodded.Gu Xiuxun furrowed her brows. Ultimately, she was the honor graduate of the Myriad Daos Academy, and her intelligence wasn\u2019t low. After thinking for a while, a look of understanding finally flashed on her face.\u201cI understand.\u201dGu Xiuxun clapped her hands. \u201cSun Mo offended Zhang Hanfu. Hence, Zhang Hanfu will surely arrange for someone to find trouble for Sun Mo during the first public lecture. To Sun Mo, that\u2019s an unknown enemy. He completely has no way to target the unknown opponent\u2019s weakness and prepare his own defense. But after he provoked Feng Zewen and set an arrangement with him, it is clear who his opponent is.\u201dWith Feng Zewen taking care of Sun Mo, Zhang Hanfu naturally wouldn\u2019t find someone else to make trouble for Sun Mo. After all, the presence of a 1-star great teacher was enough to crush Sun Mo.From Sun Mo\u2019s point of view, Feng Zewen would surely be the one making things difficult for him. In that case, he could collect Feng Zewen\u2019s information and understand his specialties until Sun Mo could launch his own \u2018attacks\u2019.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dAn Xinhui didn\u2019t expect Sun Mo to have such intellect.Ding!Favorable impression from An Xinhui +1.Prestige connection with An Xinhui: Neutral (4/100).Gu Xiuxun glanced at Sun Mo\u2019s departing back and no longer said anything. Her gaze was filled with shock. How could he calmly consider all of this when he provoked Zhang Hanfu? Wasn\u2019t his endurance to pressure a little too strong?An ordinary intern teacher would have been so frightened by Zhang Hanfu that their legs were trembling. Wrong, for ordinary intern teachers, even if they were full of guts, they would never dare to cross a vice-headmaster with such powerful authority.Ding!Favorable impression from Gu Xiuxun +3.Prestige connection with Gu Xiuxun: Neutral (5/100).Two systems notifications rang out continuously, causing Sun Mo to feel as though he had a windfall. However, just like with Yue Rongbo and Jin Mujie, it was truly very difficult to gain their admiration.In truth, the more talented someone was, the more prideful they would be. If he wanted to gain their admiration and praise, he had to use his capabilities and give them a stunning performance.\u2026Shade covered the school\u2019s flagstone pathway.Before Sun Mo, a golden book floated. With his will, the book flipped its pages automatically. Each of the pages was filled with robust yet beautiful and gentle words.\u2018Shatter Soul Blade Art, average-grade mid-tier, fragmented\u2019\u2018Tongbei Long Fist, average-grade mid-tier, fragmented\u2019\u2018Bodhidharma Staff Art, average-grade mid-tier, fragmented\u2019Because Sun Mo\u2019s Immemorial Vairocana was only at the elementary grade, he had to hit his target many times before a cultivation art could be revealed completely. Hence, all the arts he had now were fragmented.\u201cIt\u2019s useless even if they are the completed version!\u201dAfter glancing a few times at them, Sun Mo lost his interest. But then again after thinking about it, Zeng Jun was the descendant of an ordinary family, and he depended on his talent and hard work to reach his current point. If he had some powerful ultimate skills, he would have long since become famous.\u201cI remember Gao Ben has quite a high attainment in spear arts. His cultivation art is the Mystic Ice Spear Art passed down by his clan. Mn, I can find a chance and try to get that from him!\u201dSun Mo was considering it, but he wasn\u2019t in a rush to put his plan into action now.The Immemorial Vairocana was truly a divine skill. Its power was immense but he also had to use it properly. If Sun Mo randomly and recklessly challenged others, he would be beaten to a pulp sooner or later.\u201cSo, I still have to improve my cultivation and enhance my combat strength. As long as I can guarantee that, I will be in a situation where I won\u2019t die. Only then would I be able to gain the ultimate arts of my opponent while using Immemorial Vairocana.\u201dSun Mo touched the wooden blade as his eyes brightened.This wooden blade was as expected of a spirit weapon. Earlier, despite the many clashes against another weapon, there was no damage to it at all. Sun Mo had thought that the wooden blade might end up cracking. However, it seemed that he was worried for nothing.\u201cDo you want to collect these three fragmented cultivation arts?\u201d the system suddenly inquired.\u201cNo need!\u201dSun Mo shook his head. The cultivation manuals of these three arts could be easily found in any famous academies. There was no value in collecting them.Pak!The golden book immediately turned back into a golden facula before vanishing from sight completely.Ding!\u201cCongratulations on defeating Zeng Jun and completing the mission. Reward: 1x black-iron treasure chest.\u201dA black-colored metallic chest appeared before his eyes. Even before Sun Mo could smile, another system notification rang out.Ding!\u201cCongratulations. You defeated a teacher using martial might during your first actual battle and completed the hidden mission of the \u2018perfect first time\u2019. You have obtained 1x black-iron treasure chest as the reward!\u201dThis was definitely an unexpected surprise.Sun Mo was extremely happy. He couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cSystem, I didn\u2019t expect you to be so generous!\u201d\u201cIt was just a minor accomplishment. After you are done with the initial-phase rewards, you won\u2019t find it easy anymore.\u201dAfter pausing for a while, the system added, \u201cAlso, wasn\u2019t it just two black-iron treasure chests? Look at how happy you are. Can you have some ambitions and get an accomplishment that would net you a golden treasure chest?\u201d\u201cScram!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s words were concise and comprehensive.\u2026While the intern teachers had a meeting, the freshman students weren\u2019t idle. Those who were prepared to join the school had to finish all the administrative procedures within two days and pay the school fee.For those whose homes were further away and needed to stay in the school, they still needed to apply for the living essentials and register for a slot in the school\u2019s dormitory before getting the key from the administrator so they could move in as early as possible.If the bed or other items in the dorms had problems, the students had to report it to the administrator as quickly as possible. Either the damaged items were repaired or the student could change a dorm room. In any case, there were many administrative matters to settle.Sun Mo was now also a teacher of Central Province Academy. Hence, he went to the administration area and said a few sentences to gain the entry list of new students. He then searched for Lu Zhiruo\u2019s name.In the female dormitory building, block 12, level 5, room 508\u2026Lu Zhiruo just drew a pail of water and was currently wiping the floor clean.\u201cWhere are the others?\u201dSun Mo cast a glance. This dorm wasn\u2019t large, but there were eight bunk beds here. Three beds already had bedding spread out, but other than Lu Zhiruo, there was no one else here.\u201cTeacher Sun?\u201d Upon seeing Sun Mo, Lu Zhiruo\u2019s eyes became two crescent moons. \u201cThey went to tour the campus.\u201d\u201cMn!\u201dSun Mo walked in. Lu Zhiruo\u2019s clothing and other personal items were placed on a bottom bunk bed on the left side, which was by the window. That was her sleeping area. \u201cDo you have enough money to spend?\u201d asked Sun Mo.\u201cEno\u2026enough!\u201dHonestly, she didn\u2019t have enough. Luckily, Lu Zhiruo still had a dagger that was not too bad in terms of craftsmanship. She had to temporarily put that up as a loan collateral. But as long as she paid the school fees within three months, she would be able to get her dagger back.The Central Province Academy was still quite kind to students and didn\u2019t attach too high of a value on money.\u201cRemember to tell me if it\u2019s not enough.\u201dSun Mo stroked Lu Zhiruo\u2019s head. He could tell that this girl was too embarrassed to say anything. Although the Central Province Academy was a \u2018D\u2019 grade school, it used to be extremely famous. Hence, the school fees weren\u2019t cheap.From his judgment, Lu Zhiruo\u2019s clan shouldn\u2019t be a wealthy one.\u201cFather said that I have to learn to be self-reliant. I cannot always trouble you, sir!\u201dLu Zhiruo shook her head. She was too innocent. A single sentence from her had exposed her situation. \u201cI will go and work part-time while studying. I\u2019ve also asked around and learned that there are scholarships available in the school. As long as my performance is good enough and can get into the top ten of the year in terms of results, I would be able to get the scholarship.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSun Mo was speechless. Her potential value was extremely low, even more inferior than Qi Shengjia. It would already be not bad if she could sustain for three months and didn\u2019t quit school, yet she still wanted to think about getting a scholarship?It seemed like it was imminent for Sun Mo to think of a way to get a source of money.Sun Mo had a very good impression of Lu Zhiruo. Besides, she was his lucky mascot and could raise his luck stat, improving the odds whenever he opened a treasure chest. So no matter what, he had to think of a way to keep her by his side.Upon thinking of this, Sun Mo began to stroke her head just like how one would stroke a cat. After that, his left eye blinked twice as he opened up the storage cabinet and summoned the three black-iron treasure chests out.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cVery good, you are the one then. Open!\u201dMales on the left, females on the right. Sun Mo chose to open the first one on the left.A black-colored light flowed as a clicking sound rang out. The treasure chest opened and vanished, leaving behind a golden boat that quietly floated before his eyes.\u201cWoah!\u201dSun Mo couldn\u2019t help but whistle. It was actually a skill book!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67: Three Grand RewardsDing!\u201cCongratulations. You obtained the grandmaster-grade \u2018Character Painting Technique\u2019.\u201d\u201cNote: This is one of the three great branch techniques of Traditional Painting!\u201dUpon hearing the reminder of the system, Sun Mo had a dumbfounded look on his face. \u201cWhat? You feel that I have no future on the path of being a masseuse; hence, you want me to become a painter? When I cannot stay in school any longer, do you want me to peddle my art on the streets for a living?\u201dSun Mo understood that although great teachers in Middle-Earth encompassed many types of occupations, the occupations could be classified into different grades.There were great teachers proficient in painting, but they were considered mid to low tier. After all, painting was simply too non-mainstream.In the ancient eras of China, the best painter could become a court artist and create a portrait for the emperor.A few hundred years after the death of the emperor, that portrait might become popular and could be sold for millions or billions of dollars. However, this no longer had anything to do with the painter. Besides, it might not be because the artist had drawn the portrait well, the portrait might simply be a means for the wealthy merchants to launder their money.In the various countries of the nine provinces, due to spirit qi existing, the status of painters was slightly higher. The painting they created might occasionally have some extra effects that could influence the heart of those looking at it.Naturally, only an extremely rare few could achieve such a high level as a painter.The majority of the time, things such as appreciating art was the interest of the rich and powerful and also a method to display their \u2018elegance\u2019 and \u2018unique taste\u2019.\u201cIt isn\u2019t bad to have more skills. Even if you won\u2019t be able to use it in your entire life, there wouldn\u2019t be any negative points that come from learning it.\u201dThe system\u2019s words were correct. With an additional skill in hand, one wouldn\u2019t hunger to death regardless of how difficult life was. In addition, this was a grandmaster-grade \u2018Character Painting Technique\u2019.What was known as the grandmaster-grade?It meant that one had very deep and solid expertise in this domain and was worthy of being called a grandmaster by everyone.If Sun Mo mastered it, there would be no problems for him to set up a dojo and accept disciples. If someone came to challenge his drawing dojo, given his grandmaster-level of mastery, it should be sufficient to handle all sorts of challenges.\u201cWhat are the other two techniques?\u201dActually, Sun Mo was very satisfied. When he was younger, interest classes were very popular. His family was poor and he couldn\u2019t afford to join any, but he could still manage to buy some ink, paper, and brush. Hence, he practiced drawing on his own for a little while. Sadly, he didn\u2019t have much talent in this field and eventually chose to give it up.However, as for calligraphy, he did manage to persevere through, and his works could be considered not too bad. After he became a teacher in the No.2 High School, his beautiful works were deeply loved by the old headmaster as well as the students. His works helped him and deepened the impression of him in the eyes of others.Now, as long as he read the skill book, his painting skill would be at the grandmaster-level. This was just too wonderful.\u201cMountain and River Painting and the Flora and Fauna Painting Technique. Other than this, there\u2019s still western painting and traditional chinese painting,\u201d the system explained.\u201cOh.\u201dSun Mo nodded. The various countries of the Nine Provinces were still in feudal times. He would have to politely decline if the skill book was one pertaining to western painting. Even if he was Van Gogh or Picasso, the people in this world would most probably treat his painting as trash, and they wouldn\u2019t be worth even a copper coin.\u201cSo do you want to learn or not?\u201d the system asked. If Sun Mo declined, it would take back the skill book.\u201cLearn, why would I not learn?\u201dWhen Lu Zhiruo went out to throw trash, Sun Mo took out the skill book and crushed it with a smack.Pak!When the skill book shattered, a golden light akin to fireflies flew toward the center of Sun Mo\u2019s brows, entering deep into his mind.Some knowledge and comprehension of painting instantly spread through his brain. A few minutes later, when Sun Mo thought about \u2018painting\u2019, it felt like he had been painting for several tens of years and he gained many insights.Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help it anymore. He squatted beside the pail of water. His hand dipped into the pail and he began painting on the ground. Before the water dried, an extremely vivid and life-like painting appeared on the ground.It looked very real.\u201cWoah!\u201dSun Mo whistled. Sadly, there was no forum in the nine provinces. If not, if he was to take a photo and sent it on the internet, he would definitely be able to show off and win respect and admiration.Lu Zhiruo entered and glanced at Sun Mo in bewilderment. Did her teacher just pick up some money? Why was he suddenly so happy?\u201cTreasure chest on the right, open!\u201dSun Mo felt that it would be more symmetrical and was in line with his view of aesthetics. After speaking the word \u2018open\u2019, he felt like an emperor choosing which concubine to sleep with during the night. How awesome.The clicking sound rang out from the black-iron chest. When the glow disappeared, a fingernail-sized seed remained.Ding!\u201cCongratulations on obtaining an unknown seed!\u201dLooking at the dark and swarthy seed, Sun Mo was taken aback, \u201cYou don\u2019t know its name?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I say it\u2019s an unknown seed? Why is your verbal comprehension ability so bad?\u201d the system questioned.\u201cOf course, my verbal comprehension is good. I\u2019m saying that you, as the unmatched Absolute Great Teacher System, actually don\u2019t know what this is?\u201dSun Mo immediately shot back. At the same time, he was provoking the system, wanting to get an answer.\u201cHehe, I really have no idea what plant this seed belongs to. I won\u2019t be provoked by you.\u201dThe system laughed.\u201cIs it possible to plant it?\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t feel that the hopes were high. This seed was withered and dehydrated. There were even a few cracks on the surface. No matter how he looked at it, it seemed to be an inferior seedling.\u201cNo idea!\u201dThe system\u2019s answer was simple and concise.\u201cThen why did you issue it as a reward? Are you not swindling me?\u201dSun Mo was extremely dissatisfied. It was like he had spent a month\u2019s worth of salary and bought a beautiful s*x doll online. In the end, when he opened the wrapping, the doll was uglier than a slimeball. Would he still feel any joy or mood to play with it?\u201cThe rewards obtained from opening treasure chests are random. How can you resent me for having bad luck?\u201dThe system counter-asked.\u201cWhere are the human rights for unlucky people?\u201dSun Mo walked to Lu Zhiruo\u2019s side and stroked her head again. He purposely did it eight times for luck before opening the last chest.The black-iron chest shone with a brilliant light. After it disappeared, a thick white-colored cloth bag the size of a fist appeared.Ding!\u201cCongratulations, you obtained a \u2018giant medicine packet\u2019. The medicine packet is brewed using secret arts and 27 different types of herbs. It has body-strengthening, vitality-boosting, fatigue-dispelling effects, etc. If you use it often, you can raise your body quality, and just like the name of the item, your constitution could become as strong as a giant.\u201d\u201cNote: When bathing, put this packet into the tub full of bathwater. After five minutes, the medical effect would spread through and you can begin to soak yourself for 20 minutes or more to get the full benefits.\u201dSun Mo felt at ease after looking at the description. At the very least, this was much better than that stupid unknown seed. The usage method wasn\u2019t complicated either. He could use it when he was bathing, it was very convenient.\u201cIs it for sale in the merchant store?\u201dSun Mo asked. If the effects weren\u2019t bad, he could use it often.\u201cSince you obtained the giant medicine packet as a reward, from now on, it would be unlocked in the merchant store. It cost 100 favorable impression points per packet.\u201dThe system explained.\u201cThe price is still alright!\u201dSun Mo silently evaluated. If he accepted the honest Qi Shengjia as his disciple, he would be able to amass 100 favorable points in a short few days.Naturally, given Sun Mo\u2019s character, he would never recruit Qi Shengjia purely for the reason of gaining favorable impression points.After Sun Mo opened three treasure chests, Lu Zhiruo had also finished cleaning her dorm. Then, Sun Mo immediately brought the papaya girl to the Reading Veranda.Jinling City was large and flourishing. There were many carriages for rental on the road. Sun Mo casually flagged one down and rented it for a few copper coins. He could still afford this amount of money.Lu Zhiruo was carrying a book bag. She would occasionally cast a glance at Sun Mo and seemed as though she wanted to say something, but hesitation was holding her back.\u201cRead it if you want to.\u201dSun Mo leaned against the carriage window. He was admiring the scenery outside while thinking about how to handle Zheng Qingfang so he could maximize his profits.After getting the approval, the papaya girl\u2019s eyes became crescent moons as she hurriedly and carefully took out the draft paper.Although she read the front pages before, Lu Zhiruo couldn\u2019t control her urge and read it again as she soon grew completely immersed.\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s time to get off!\u201dSun Mo paid the carriage driver the money and called out.Lu Zhiruo didn\u2019t respond.Knock, knock!Sun Mo rapped the wall of the carriage.Lu Zhiruo still didn\u2019t realize it. Her entire person was hungrily reading the novel.\u201cLu Zhiruo, we are here!\u201dSun Mo raised his volume.\u201cAh?\u201dThe papaya girl jumped in fright. She inclined her head and stared at her surroundings blankly. Why did they reach so fast? Aiya, the [Journey to the West] was such a good read. Sun Wukong actually wreaked havoc in the celestial court, how tyrannical.Earlier, just when Lu Zhiruo had lowered her head and had been preparing to finish reading this segment, she heard Sun Mo\u2019s voice and she woke up from her reading daze. She then realized she had to accompany Teacher Sun to the bookstore.For a time, Lu Zhiruo hurriedly kept the draft paper as she got off the carriage.Sun Mo turned and entered the Reading Veranda. A faint fragrance of lavender immediately drifted into his nose.\u201cYou are here?\u201dZheng Qingfang, who was lying back on his wooden chair, sat up when he saw Sun Mo. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen you for many days. I thought what you said before was a joke.\u201dAs he spoke, Zheng Qingfang\u2019s eyes drifted to Sun Mo. When he saw that Sun Mo\u2019s hands were empty, a feeling of disappointment surged his chest.As expected, the Journey to the West, Dragon Ball, and some weird title named Transformers whose content he had no idea about, didn\u2019t appear.He knew that young people were unreliable.Zheng Qingfang was a person who treated books like his life. After retiring, his old friends had all died and he had no way to meet them ever again. Reading became his only pleasure in life. However, he had read so many books to the point where no books could match his interest.Ever since he had heard Sun Mo speaking about the Journey to the West, he hadn\u2019t been able to eat or sleep well and was wondering about the content.A good title was enough to fuel people\u2019s imagination about a good book.\u201cIs our previous agreement still in place?\u201dSun Mo laughed lightly.\u201cNaturally. As long as your book is good enough and can be sold out, I will give it my all and publish 1,000 books for you. All the income shall belong to you!\u201dZheng Qingfang silently grumbled. (What sort of man am I? Since I said it, I will do it.) However, he was also quite clever. Books that could be sold out were naturally popular ones. There would only be one or two of such books every year. The remaining books that were more unpopular would be stuck on the bookshelves and left there to gather dust.\u201cThat\u2019s good then!\u201dSun Mo nodded. \u201cZhiruo, pass him the script.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe carried the book bag in and felt some reluctance. Could she finish reading it first before passing it to this old man?\u201cOh? You really managed to write it? Quickly, let me take a look!\u201dSeeing Lu Zhiruo hesitating, Zheng Qingfang stood up and rushed in front of her as he took the bag.\u201cAiya, be careful. Don\u2019t damage it!\u201dUpon seeing Zheng Qingfang\u2019s actions, Lu Zhiruo felt her heart aching.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Subconsciously, his movements grew increasingly gentle, very different from his earlier absent-minded motions, like he was afraid to damage the manuscript.Honestly speaking, when he first read the manuscript, Zheng Qingfang was filled with disdain. He felt that Sun Mo was talking big.The paragraph was direct and accurate, but there wasn\u2019t any literary talent. To speak bluntly, it was written in vernacular.But as he continued reading, he felt the story growing more interesting.A divine rock that gathered and absorbed the spirit qi of heavens and earth, eventually having a spiritual fetus within it. When the spirit monkey broke out from the stone and flew up to the clouds, Zheng Qingfang was completely stunned into speechlessness.The main character was actually a monkey?No? The monkey should be the main character\u2019s pet, right?The emergence of the main character was actually so novel and wondrous. Appearing from a rock? Zheng Qingfang had read books for several tens of years and had never read something like this before.\u2026Zheng Qingfang could be considered as widely-read, but this opening passage alone made him give it 9 out of 10 points. He was very satisfied.It was lacking by one point because the writing style seemed a little too crude and simple.Thinking of this, he wanted nothing more than to modify the words himself. He felt that the literary style had messed up the opening to this piece of godly work. But as he read on, Zheng Qingfang couldn\u2019t care less about other things. He got completely immersed in the story.Heading to the west, the Monkey King was born!Trading to the edges of the oceans, looking for the art of longevity!Zheng Qingfang touched his beard with joy when he read that this monkey was playing around with the monkeys in the mountains. From entering the Water Curtain Cave, to subduing the other monkeys, to self-proclaiming he was the monkey king\u2026 After that, when the monkey king saw his subjects aging and dying, he was badly shocked. The monkey king then decided to travel to distant lands by crossing the oceans and seek out the secret of eternal life. When Zheng Qingfang read until here, he couldn\u2019t help but reveal sorrow in his eyes.Eternal life?How hard would it be to achieve that?On his path, the monkey king suffered a lot and was the butt of many jokes. He created many troubles as well. Zheng Qingfang couldn\u2019t help but smile when he read through its exploits.He finally heaved a sigh of relief after reading that the monkey managed to find the Slanted Moon Three Stars Cave on Fangcun Mountain after roaming around for many years.However, at this point, Zheng Qingfang began panting as he began to feel nervous. Because how could there be any cultivation art for eternal life in this world?Nevertheless, the plot didn\u2019t disappoint Zheng Qingfang. The wild monkey gained the name Sun Wukong and even learned the Seventy-Two Transformation. It also got a cloud that could travel 108,000 miles with a single somersault.At this moment, this 70-year-old elder, Zheng Qingfang, couldn\u2019t help but clap his hands and call out in excitement. He recalled his younger years.Lu Zhiruo squatted at the side, wanting to read it again after this old man finished it. However, the old man didn\u2019t even release his hold on the pages that he had finished reading. How infuriating!\u2026After that, Sun Wukong did all the unthinkable things. He was fighting the myriad of demons and seizing back the Water Curtain Cave, heading to the eastern sea and obtaining the Ruyi Golden Cudgel, invading the underworld and forcefully changing the contents of the life-and-death book, and even fighting against the generals and soldiers of the celestial court!He read that Sun Wukong was eventually captured and placed within the alchemy cauldron of the Supreme Elder Lord and Zheng Qinfang\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but be filled with worry. Yet, thanks to that, Sun Wukong managed to gain the golden eyes technique. In the end, Sun Wukong wreaked havoc through the celestial court and made so much trouble that the celestial court was turned topsy-turvy.This time around, Zheng Qingfang could no longer control himself. He stood up and forcefully smacked the table as he shouted, \u201cImposing!\u201d\u2026Time slowly passed. Zheng Qingfang was completely immersed in the story, accompanying Reverend Tang and his three disciples to the west to collect the holy scripture.Unsuitable writing style?Sorry, Zheng Qingfang had already forgotten about that. In his mind, there were only the four main characters and the 81 calamities!All of a sudden, Zheng Qingfang\u2019s hands were empty. (Where is the manuscript? It\u2019s finished? There\u2019s actually no more?) He turned his head and glanced at Sun Mo. His hoarse voice rang out.\u201cWhere\u2019s the latter part?\u201dLu Zhiruo, who was at the side, jumped in fright and retreated a few steps back in alarm.Sun Mo didn\u2019t reply.Zheng Qingfang hurried over toward Sun Mo before impatiently grabbing his hand. \u201cWhere\u2019s the latter part of the manuscript? Sun Wukong actually destroyed the Renshen Fruit Tree? He\u2019s most probably about to engage in a battle with the Zhenyuan Grand Immortal, right?Sun Mo smiled and pulled his hand away from Zheng Qingfang\u2019s grab.\u201cPlease say something!\u201dZheng Qingfang was so anxious that he almost died.\u201cWas it a nice read?\u201d Sun Mo counter-asked.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cVery good!\u201d\u201cToo damn good!\u201dZheng Qingfang affirmed it three times while stroking the draft paper with his right hand. It had truly been a very long time since he had read such a good story. It felt like drinking an excellent cup of wine.\u201cRight? Right?\u201dHalf of Lu Zhiruo\u2019s body was hidden behind the bookshelf. She smiled widely and was extremely excited. \u201cDidn\u2019t I say that Teacher Sun would surely be able to write a great work?\u201dThe papaya girl felt extremely honored now.\u201cTeacher Sun?\u201d Zheng Qingfang surveyed Sun Mo. \u201cWhich school are you from?\u201d\u201cCentral Province Academy!\u201dSun Mo formally introduced himself.Zheng Qingfang invited Sun Mo to sit down and personally brewed a cup of tea for him. Even Lu Zhiruo who accompanied Sun Mo managed to get a cup of tea too.\u201cI apologize. It has been a long time since I read such an amazing book and I have forgotten the time.\u201dSeeing that it was already quite late at night, Zheng Qingfang felt extremely awkward.\u201cIn that case, could you publish 1,000 books?\u201d Sun Mo asked with a smile.\u201cYes, absolutely yes!\u201dZheng Qingfang immediately nodded. After that, he shook his head. \u201cCould you polish this literary work a little more?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s answer was clean and concise. What a joke, he naturally wouldn\u2019t be able to polish this classical work with his standard.Actually, Sun Mo\u2019s literary talent wasn\u2019t too bad. He had published a few articles and poems a couple of years ago. However, in the eyes of the people of the ancient era, he was sorely lacking.\u201cAi, what a pity!\u201dZheng Qingfang sighed as he cast a deep glance at Sun Mo. His meaning was very simple. This was such a good story, how good would it be if the writing style could be polished even more?\u201cForgive me for being blunt, but why did you want to write this novel?\u201d asked Zheng Qinfang.Sun Mo didn\u2019t want to be looked down on; hence, he retaliated.\u201cWhat do you think my purpose is, by writing it using this style?\u201dZheng Qingfang smiled but he didn\u2019t reply.\u201cBy writing in vernacular, even the old aunties in the countryside can understand it. This is then the best style for this story.\u201dSun Mo shrugged.Zheng Qingfang was stunned. For a while, he didn\u2019t know how to rebut Sun Mo\u2019s words. That was right. This was a novel, and the purpose of a novel was to be read and enjoyed. It wasn\u2019t those classical articles written by the sages and saints, where only those who were learned could understand it.Sun Mo drank his tea.Lu Zhiruo also learned from him and lifted her cup. She felt very happy when she saw the bookstore\u2019s boss being stunned into speechlessness by her teacher!Ding!Favorable impression from Lu Zhiruo +5.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Friendly (183/1,000).\u201cUncle Zheng. Look, it is already quite late\u2026\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t say the latter part of the sentence, which was \u2018I want to sign the contract and leave with the money.\u2019\u201cOh, I was too careless!\u201dZheng Qingfang opened the drawer and took out a bell, shaking it.Very soon, an old servant walked in from the backyard.\u201cGo, prepare a sumptuous banquet.\u201dZheng Qingfang prepared to chat with Sun Mo through the night. He had to dig out the content of the story from the other party by hook or by crook. \u201cOh ya, also withdraw 1,000 taels of silver over!:The old servant was very well trained and capable at his job.Very soon, a table full of delicacies was set up.After coming to Jinling, Sun Mo hadn\u2019t even gone to a restaurant to eat a meal yet. Just from the looks of the dishes, he knew that the prices weren\u2019t cheap.There were also trays of silver ingot placed on the table. There were 50 taels of silver in a tray and a total of 20 trays. The ingots shone with luster under the glow of the candlelight.\u201cThis is the famous brew that has been stored for many years from Laohuai Lane. Give it a taste!\u201dZheng Qingfang poured a cup of wine.\u201cThank you Uncle Zheng for your hospitality.\u201dSun Mo drained the contents of the cup in a single gulp and also toasted Zheng Qingfang. After that, he placed the cup back on the table. \u201cI apologize, my tolerance for alcohol isn\u2019t great!\u201dZheng Qingfang was a generous person, and he didn\u2019t feel that Sun Mo was a sissy because of his actions. He said sure and began to enjoy the wine himself.It was extremely rare for him to see such a good book. If he didn\u2019t get thoroughly drunk, he felt that he would basically have let down [Journey to the West].\u201cDon\u2019t feel so restrained!\u201dSeeing that Lu Zhiruo was still very shy, Sun Mo passed a piece of beef to her plate.\u201cMn!\u201dThe papaya girl felt warmth in her heart. However, she was very obedient. When she saw that Zheng Qingfang\u2019s cup was empty, she hurriedly took the initiative to pour wine for him.Zheng Qingfang was very casual. At the banquet table, there was no need to follow too many rules. It was good if everyone could enjoy themselves.After he drank his third cup of wine, he placed the trays of ingots before Sun Mo. \u201cLook at my bad memory. From now onward, these silver taels belong to you.\u201d\u201cI said it before, I won\u2019t sell my manuscript.\u201dSun Mo rejected. This amount of money was quite a lot, but it was not enough to purchase the copyright of Journey to the West.\u201cLook at what you are saying. Even if I was blind, I wouldn\u2019t think that just 1,000 taels of silver would be enough to purchase the copyright of this book. This is the living expenses I\u2019m giving you. I hope you won\u2019t be troubled by the necessities of life and let them delay your writing.\u201dZheng Qingfang explained. \u201cAs for the cost of publishing, we will calculate that separately.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t take it all!\u201dSun Mo pushed the trays of ingots back as he ate a mouthful of food.\u201cSun Mo, let me bank on my seniority and call you little friend.\u201d Zheng Qingfang looked at Sun Mo as his emotions flowed forth. \u201cIt is simply too hard to get a good book. It is even tougher to get a book I like so much that I don\u2019t want to let it leave my hands. Little Friend Sun, please accept my goodwill, alright? I only hope that I\u2019ll be able to see the latter part of the story as soon as possible.\u201dDing!Favorable impression from Zheng Qingfang +10.Prestige connection with Zheng Qingfang unlocked. Current state: Neutral (10/100).Sun Mo was speechless. The system notification already rang out and this meant that Zheng Qingfang truly admired him. This wasn\u2019t a trick for him to get the manuscript of Journey to the West. However, wasn\u2019t the speed of him becoming a fan a little too quick?(It wouldn\u2019t be too late if you show your goodwill after finishing the entire story, right?)(By doing this now, I\u2019ll feel very proud!)Although there were no major changes to the plot, the words were written by him. Thus, some details and characters were slightly modified based on his thinking. It couldn\u2019t be considered plagiarism, right?Honestly speaking, as a teacher, Sun Mo had a very low tolerance for plagiarizing. If it wasn\u2019t for him needing money, he wouldn\u2019t have chosen to write Journey to the West.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, from another point of view, it was also considered a good thing to let the people of Middle-Earth Nine Provinces read a classic from his previous world.Zheng Qingfang pushed the trays over. After that, he took up the manuscript in his hands again and began to read. He couldn\u2019t help but give his praise once more. It was truly a very good read!But after that, his expression turned into one of disappointment. Sigh\u2026 if he couldn\u2019t find another work of this quality to read in the future, wouldn\u2019t life lose all its meaning?Actually, Zheng Qingfang had other intentions in his mind by giving Sun Mo money. Other than wanting to read the latter part of Journey to the West, he also wanted to read [Dragon Ball] and [Transformers]. From the quality of this book, the other two books most probably wouldn\u2019t be too bad either.By thinking of the books, Zheng Qingfang who treated books like his life suddenly felt extremely excited. He wanted nothing more than to grab Sun Mo and make him write out the books for him now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69: Wondrous Blossom\u201cUncle Zheng, there\u2019s no need to worry. I will complete writing the latter part of the story soon.\u201dSun Mo guaranteed.The other party had already called him \u2018little friend\u2019 and he was also so generous. Hence, Sun Mo also changed his terms of address and spoke to Zheng Qingfang more respectfully.\u201cAlright then!\u201dZheng Qingfang carefreely toasted and then continued to persuade, \u201cHowever, you have to accept the ingots. Don\u2019t worry, this sum of money won\u2019t be considered in the author\u2019s remuneration. I will also print out 1,000\u2026 no, 3,000 books. At that time, when the books are sold for money, I\u2019ll deduct the capital of printing and the remainder of the money will go all to you.\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t too good, right?\u201dSun Mo frowned. By doing this, Zheng Qingfang would be working for free for Sun Mo.\u201cWhat\u2019s not good about it? We must let everyone read such an amazing novel. If not, it would be the same as a bright pearl covered in dust, wasting heavenly materials.\u201dZheng Qingfang spoke logically. As for the ingots, he didn\u2019t mention anything about them.As a high official, Zheng Qingfang naturally didn\u2019t lack things like money. What he lacked were places to spend the ingots.After reading Journey to the West, Zheng Qingfang instantly grew fond of the monkey king and Reverend Sanzang. If he didn\u2019t give the ingots to Sun Mo, he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep well.Zheng Qingfang had decided that when the printing was done, he would first send the books to his friends. If not, they would surely blame him for monopolizing such a good thing and keeping it a secret.\u201cCongratulations on obtaining your first loyal-to-the-death fan!\u201dThe system teased.\u201cIn that case, why don\u2019t you give me a reward?\u201d Sun Mo mentally spoke. (For the next book, I\u2019m going to write my own stuff.)The system replied, \u201cheh heh.\u201d\u201cAlright, a man must be more direct and generous. We shouldn\u2019t be pushing a small thing like money around,\u201d said Zheng Qingfang, his tone unyielding.Upon seeing Zheng Qingfang grow impatient and because he was giving him the ingots out of goodwill, Sun Mo raised his cup and toasted. \u201cAlright then, thank you Uncle Zheng for your kind intentions. In that case, it would be impolite if I still refused!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t need to be so courteous and there\u2019s no need to mind your etiquette. It\u2019s too troublesome!\u201dZheng Qingfang furrowed his brows as he waved his hands. \u201cBe more free and at ease!\u201dWhat else could Sun Mo say? A loyal-to-the-death fan was simply so illogical and crazy!From the start to the end, their topic revolved around the Journey to the West. Zheng Qingfang had the intention of digging out all the plotlines from Sun Mo.Lu Zhiruo sat obediently at the side. She didn\u2019t interrupt and didn\u2019t even dare to breathe loudly. Only when she was pouring the wine would they be able to see her.\u201cOh yes, if you want to publish it, we need to illustrate the book. Do you have any ideas on that?\u201dZheng Qingfang asked.This was his first time seeing something like this. Given the character of the master and the three disciples in the story, Zheng Qingfang was worried that the hired artist would have no way to capture the essence of the characters.Sun Mo\u2019s mind stirred. \u201cHow many illustrations do you need?\u201d\u201cIt depends on the context. However, the portrait of each character is a must.\u201dZheng Qingfang had been an official for so many years and knew how to read people well. The moment he saw Sun Mo\u2019s expression, he already guessed his thoughts. \u201cLittle Friend Sun is a great teacher, you most probably are a man of many talents. Could it be that you are skilled in painting as well?\u201d\u201cStill passable!\u201dSun Mo silently mused that during the morning, he could only draw a picture of a chick eating grains that was understandable by him and no one else. But after obtaining the painting technique, in terms of \u2018character painting\u2019, he could already be considered a grandmaster.\u201cWhy do you need to be so humble? Do you think that the Absolute Great Teacher System doesn\u2019t want face?\u201d The system spoke unhappily. \u201cTell him loudly that you are a grandmaster painter!\u201d\u201cOh? When will you be able to hand the illustrations in?\u201dZheng Qingfang was impatient. If the author of the book were to do the illustrations, the essence of the characters would definitely be captured.\u201cHow about now?\u201dSun Mo had to prepare for his lessons later on. He had to make sure that he performed well during the first public lecture. Hence, he didn\u2019t have the time to keep running to the Reading Veranda.\u201cAh?\u201dZheng Qingfang revealed a puzzled expression and almost wanted to ask if Sun Mo was sure he could do it or not. Didn\u2019t he need time to draw the character?\u201cYou should have some ink, paper, and a brush here, right?\u201dSun Mo had seen too many adaptations on the Journey of the West, and he was the one writing it in this world as well. As for the image of the characters, there was no need for him to think at all. They had long since been imprinted in his mind.\u201cYou really don\u2019t need some time to conceptualize?\u201dZheng Qingfang gave a command to the old servant, which had been with him for tens of years, to prepare the necessary items. Forget it, he would just let Sun Mo draw what he wanted. No matter what, he still had to give Sun Mo some face as the author.Besides, if the paintings couldn\u2019t work out, it wouldn\u2019t be too late for him to search for a master-class painter.The long table was set; the ink, brush, and paper were also prepared. Meanwhile, the old servant didn\u2019t retreat. He merely stepped two steps back and remained at the side, ready to provide assistance if they needed it.Never look down on these two steps. They were perfect. He wouldn\u2019t be too near to disturb the guest and wouldn\u2019t be too far to let the guest feel slighted.If one wasn\u2019t from a major clan, it was hard for them to understand all these intricacies.From just a single detail, one could see the foundations of a major clan.Lu Zhiruo prepared the ink and became the little maid.Sun Mo took up the brush. He had thought that he would not be accustomed to it, but after a few breaths, a sense of familiarity rose in his heart. It was like he had been painting for over ten years, and each stroke he made came from his heart.He dipped the brush in ink as he began.For the first character, Sun Mo chose to draw Zhu Bajie.The grandmaster-level \u2018Character Painting Technique\u2019 allowed Sun Mo to draw out whatever he was thinking of. There were no discrepancies at all.The first character was Zhu Bajie, something Sun Mo intended to draw as practice. However, what came out was much better than his imagination.When Zheng Qingfang saw a pig-headed human wielding a nine-toothed rake, the scenes of Zhu Bajie he read about immediately floated in his mind.Vivid, the creative concept was a perfect match.\u201cNice!\u201dZheng Qingfang praised as he involuntarily surveyed Sun Mo.This youth looked only about 20 years old, but he had such high attainments in the field of painting.Did he want to become a famous artist?Upon thinking of this, Zheng Qingfang felt it was quite a pity. After all, the statuses of painters and artists were much inferior compared to a great teacher who focused on cultivation.Sun Mo didn\u2019t notice Zheng Qingfang\u2019s gaze. Right now, he was completely immersed in the feeling of satisfaction when he painted. If it wasn\u2019t for the current location not being suitable, he truly wanted to draw a \u2018Yui Hatano\u2019 out. The naked one.There were no solutions to it. Sun Mo had never seen a clothed Yui Hatano before!One painting, two paintings, three paintings!Sha Wujing! Patriarch Subhuti! Little white dragon!Sun Mo grew increasingly satisfied. It was like a new game he bought, a new movie he downloaded. If he didn\u2019t get a kick out of it first, how would he have the mood to eat a meal?Lu Zhiruo and Zheng Qingfang also got a kick from watching him. Their minds were completely filled with the story plot. Even the old servant at the side was standing on tiptoes, staring at the xuan papers on the table.These characters were truly life-like. It felt like they could leap out from the xuan paper!When the moon rose to its highest point, the ninth painting was the scene of the Great Sage Equal to Heavens with his fiery golden eyes kicking the alchemy cauldron as he flew into the sky.\u201cAWESOME!\u201dZheng Qingfang finally couldn\u2019t control his emotions and applauded while he praised.\u201cYeah!\u201dLu Zhiruo hurriedly nodded.\u201cI will rest after painting one more piece!\u201dSun Mo wriggled his wrists and neck. He felt a little tired.\u201cHow about Reverend Sanzang?\u201dLu Zhiruo requested in a small voice.\u201cSure!\u201dSun Mo moved his brush. This time, he chose to draw Reverend Sanzang who was in the midst of journeying to the west. His cassock was no longer clean, and his body was covered in dust.He was leading a white horse forward with a nine-ringed monk staff in his hand, bracing the desert wind while continuing forward with difficulty.As he drew, Sun Mo recalled his path of pursuing education back then. He thought of how he had managed to stand stably in the no. 2 high school after his graduation. He took step by step as he slowly revealed his talent. In the end, he became a star teacher in high school and obtained the recognition of the old headmaster.Now that he came to Tang Country of the Central Province, it was impossible for him not to miss home. But when he thought of Li Ziqi, Lu Zhiruo, and his newly recruited students, Sun Mo suddenly felt that he wasn\u2019t afraid of anything and would bravely overcome anything in his way.They believed in him. Since that was the case, he would do his best to teach them. He mustn\u2019t let them down.(Someone that ate soft rice?A graduate from a rubbish school?No talent? Just a salted fish that would lead an ordinary life?Just wait and see!Very soon, I\u2019ll become a great teacher of the school, before becoming the number one great teacher in Jinling and eventually the entire Jiangnan\u2026I\u2019m unworthy of An Xinhui?One day, I will make all of you change your words and say that An Xinhui is claiming connections with me who will be in a higher social class!)Sun Mo\u2019s brush was like dragons and snakes, painting out the details.Sanzang\u2019s picture was finally done.During this period, Sun Mo was sneered and snubbed by all the people. Everyone was calling him a soft-rice guy and rolled their eyes at him every single time. Although he appeared as if he wasn\u2019t too bothered, in truth, he was unhappy from the depths of his heart.Sun Mo was waiting for a chance, a chance to prove himself.\u201cSince this daddy arrived in this world and is also a teacher, I\u2019ll do my best to prove that this daddy is stronger, more elite, more outstanding than the country bumpkins of the Nine Provinces!\u201dSun Mo came to Middle-Earth, but his heart was still that of a youth.His hot-blood hadn\u2019t turned cold yet, his ambitions hadn\u2019t dissipated!If he encountered people looking down on him and vilifying him, just f*ck them! F*ck them ruthlessly until they knelt and searched for the bits of their broken teeth on the ground. F*ck them until they completely shut up.The spirit qi in the surroundings gathered over at the end of the brush. With each stroke Sun Mo made, they flowed into the picture scroll.\u201cThis\u2026this is\u2026the realm of Wondrous Blossom?\u201dZheng Qingfang exclaimed in shock.The so-called Wondrous Blossom was a realm that only an artist could reach. At the same time, it was also a type of marvel.It meant that the painting painted by the artist was the same as reality. One\u2019s point of view, minds, and spirits would also be swayed into intoxication when looking at it.There were three levels to Wondrous Blossom.The third level was the entire painting was as vivid as life. Due to spirit qi infusion, the painting would no longer be one of black and white. It would be filled with colors, brimming with a vibrant atmosphere within the painting.As long as someone saw it, they would involuntarily halt their steps and couldn\u2019t bear to shift their gaze away.The second level was that the admirers of the painting would be influenced by the creative concept of the painting. Their emotions would lose control, they might fall in a daze, they might become indecisive, they might feel full of love, pain, or suffering. They would be mesmerized by the painting and wish to possess it for themselves, treating it like a precious valuable.The first level was the highest level an artist could attain.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe admirers of the painting would find themselves completely immersed in it. It was like they had become characters living in the painting and would experience everything the character had experienced. They could gain comprehension from the characters in the painting.Those people would then completely neglect the flow of time, pausing what they were doing and staring at the painting for several days and nights. They would be immersed so deep that they wouldn\u2019t be able to extricate themselves.Zheng Qingfang heard that there were quite a few paintings on this level. Ordinary people basically mustn\u2019t look at them. Because, once they did so, they would no longer be able to shift their eyes away. It would be like their entire souls had been drawn into the painting. They would become something like an imbecile in real life and only want to accompany the painting forever.Note:Yui Hatano (popular JAV star)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The brilliance of their glow covered the glow of the candles.\u201cThis\u2026so this is Wondrous Blossom?\u201dLu Zhiruo covered her mouth with her tiny hands. Her face was filled with shock, and she didn\u2019t even dare to breathe too loudly like she was afraid of disturbing Sun Mo.\u201cFor sure, look at the colors of the painting.\u201dThe old servant also spoke in a very low voice. His voice was even lower than the buzzing of a mosquito. He was also afraid of disturbing Sun Mo.One must know that even for a famous artist, entering such a state couldn\u2019t be actively sought after and could only be encountered by chance. If Sun Mo was cut off half-way, this Sanzang\u2019s drawing would be destroyed.At that time, let alone the old master blaming him, even he would want nothing more than to slam his head to commit suicide.The Nine Provinces of Middle-Earth was the same as the ancient eras of China. Their production capability was extremely low. They lacked color pigments; hence, all their literary works and paintings were done on white xuan paper and using black ink. These were all considered mainstream.These characteristics were also that of traditional chinese paintings.When a painter entered the Wondrous Blossom state and began their creation, everything would be different.Spirit qi would gather at the end of the brush. As the painter waved their brush to draw their creation, the strokes they made would also be filled with beautiful colors.The famous painter would move the brush with their thoughts and will. They would control the spirit qi and draw out the colors they wished to paint. The painting would no longer be a painting of black and white.During the evening, the glow of the sunset cast its red shade downward.The towering mountains and precipitous ridges that were overflowing with greenery seemed a little gloomy under twilight. Reverend Sanzang, who was covered in dust, held a rope as he led his horse climbing over a giant piece of wood that was struck by lightning.Due to the Wondrous Blossom, each of the details like the soil on Reverend Sanzang\u2019s robes, the dirt-covered fur of the white dragon horse, the shiny nine-ringed monk staff despite being covered in dust, were filled with perfect colors.Zhang Qingfang and the other two no longer spoke. Despite them being so curious that they wanted to die, all chose to take a few steps back carefully rather than watching the painting closely.At this moment, none of them dared to disturb Sun Mo. They were afraid of preventing the birth of a famous painting.That was right, once a painting reached the Wondrous Blossom realm and was filled with colors, they could already be considered publicly acknowledged paintings. Even the strictest judges wouldn\u2019t be able to deny it.Even if there was a famous artist on the scene now, they could say that Sun Mo\u2019s painting techniques were not skilled enough and that the creative concept behind this painting was still lacking. But no matter what, they wouldn\u2019t dare to say that this painting was not considered a famous painting.Because Wondrous Blossom was the absolute criterion for a famous painting!If this painting was sold, it would definitely be able to fetch a high price. Even if those nobles and wealthy merchants, who were fond of traditional chinese paintings, didn\u2019t understand how to appreciate a painting, they would still want to collect this piece. They didn\u2019t need to be worried about being swindled because the vibrant colors of the painting could already prove its value.After a long time, Sun Mo retreated and put down the brush. He placed his hands before his chest as he stared at this painting.At this moment, the atmosphere in the bookstore suddenly lightened.Only then did Zheng Qingfang and the other two dare to breathe loudly. Only then did they dare to applaud and issue their own opinions.It was then the time to appreciate the painting.Clap, clap, clap!Zheng Qingfang excitedly applauded. As he walked over, he kept singing praises.\u201cGood painting!\u201d\u201cGood painting!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a really good painting!\u201dZheng Qingfang stared at the Sanzang\u2019s painting as he praised it thrice.The colors of this painting were not that vibrant since the hues of grey were needed to denote the dust. Hence, one would feel a sense of struggle when looking at it. The tense atmosphere in the painting would weigh heavily in one\u2019s heart, causing discomfort. But all the discomfort would melt like ice in summer the moment one turned their focus onto Reverend Sanzang.The gaze of Sanzang was determined and bright, staring into the distance!The steps of Sanzang were light, filled with force, capable of trudging through all calamities!The demeanor of Sanzang emanated determination and stubbornness that he would get the true scriptures no matter what. For this journey to the west, regardless of how tough or how far the roads ahead were, he would never step back!Already old and grey?No, when looking at this painting, Zhen Qingfang felt that as long as he continued trudging forward in determination, he could fight for another twenty years?Lu Zhiruo\u2019s fists were tightly clenched, and perspiration could be seen on her nose. The feelings of inferiority and cowardice in her heart vanished at this moment, being replaced by an intense feeling of persistence.\u201cI want to become a person that would make my father proud. I must definitely get his recognition one day!\u201dLu Zhiruo recalled the vow she made when she left home.\u201cOld master!\u201dThe old servant involuntarily called out. When he thought of him accompanying Zheng Qingfang as he sank and floated in the vast sea of officialdom for so many years, his tears couldn\u2019t help but fall. \u201cYou have not succeeded yet!\u201d\u201cYes, I haven\u2019t succeeded!\u201dZheng Qingfang shook his head. He blamed his body for being too weak. If he could break through his bottleneck and step into the Longevity Realm, even if the boost in his lifespan was just ten years, it was still better than nothing.\u201cThis is what I drew?\u201dGradually, a look of disbelief appeared on Sun Mo\u2019s face.\u201cYes!\u201dThe tone of the system was calm. But at this moment, it was also badly shocked.Although the grandmaster-level character painting technique was bestowed to this young man and it could be used effortlessly, if one wanted to reach the point of perfection when using it, they would definitely need time to temper themselves.Being able to paint something to this extent despite having just obtained the character painting technique, even managing to enter the realm of Wondrous Blossom, it was sufficient to say that Sun Mo had an outstanding talent in the field of painting.\u201cCould it be that Sun Mo was an artist in his previous life until he took an arrow to his knee?\u201dThe system guessed.\u201cThis is the Wondrous Blossom!\u201dZheng Qingfang exclaimed in admiration. After that, he turned to Sun Mo as he hesitated. \u201cLittle Friend Sun, may I be so bold as to ask you for a favor?\u201dDing!Favorable impression points from Zheng Qingfang +30.Prestige connection with Zheng Qingfang: Neutral (40/100)\u201cUncle Zheng is too serious. Please speak!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t dare to put on airs. He added another sentence in explanation, \u201cThis painting was able to reach such a height in terms of mastery due to chance. If you want me to draw another painting of the same level, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to do it.\u201dZheng Qingfang\u2019s eyes brightened as he laughed. \u201cHehe, due to chance? You are too humble!\u201d\u201cTeacher is so awesome!\u201dLu Zhiruo finally had a chance to praise her teacher.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +30.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Friendly (213/1,000).Ding!Favorable impression points from the old servant +30.Prestige connection with the old servant unlocked. Current state: Neutral (30/100)The old servant didn\u2019t speak, but the favorable impression points he gave already showed his admiration toward Sun Mo.\u201cLittle Friend Sun, I wonder if you are willing to part with this painting and give it to me?\u201dAfter Zheng Qingfang finished speaking, he hurriedly added, \u201cI won\u2019t let you suffer a disadvantage. As to how much money you want, Little Friend Sun can feel free to state it!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s forget about money. If Uncle Zheng likes it, just feel free to take it!\u201dSun Mo laughed lightly.Honestly speaking, this painting was wonderful and it was also the first painting he drew, which made it full of commemoration value. He was truly reluctant to give it away, but when facing his loyal-to-the-death fan, Sun Mo was absolutely willing to part with it.Who was Zheng Qingfang?As a retired high official, it was unknown how many talented youths he had met before. Being able to give 30 favorable impression points as gauged by the system indicated that he truly admired Sun Mo a lot.Also, as for the 1,000 ingots of silver earlier, he didn\u2019t say anything more and simply gifted it to Sun Mo to free him from worries and encourage him to finish writing [Journey to the West].What sort of person was this? This was the act of an intimate friend!Sun Mo wasn\u2019t someone petty. Now that he encountered such a situation, he definitely wouldn\u2019t want the other party\u2019s money.\u201cHow can we do that? This is a famous painting. Its value is worth tens of thousands of gold!\u201dZheng Qingfang shook his head. Given his status, he also had quite a few paintings as collectibles in his home. But for paintings that reached the level of Wondrous Blossoms, he only had three of them.There were no solutions for it. For paintings of this level, everyone would snatch it madly once one appeared in the market. It could truly influence the heart state of the admirers.For example, just like this Sanzang\u2019s painting, when one felt that their life was filled with difficulty or impatience due to work and had lost their ambitions, they would immediately burn with fighting spirit and fervor after glancing at the painting.This was the charm of a famous painting!\u201cUncle Zheng, if you regard me highly, don\u2019t say things like that anymore.\u201dSun Mo went back to his seat at the table. \u201cCome, let\u2019s drink up!\u201dZheng Qingfang hesitated for a moment before turning to give an order to the old servant. \u201cGo and take my chasing cloud dagger over!\u201d\u201cOld master!\u201dThe old servant evidently managed to guess Zheng Qingfang\u2019s thoughts. He hurriedly called out.\u201cGo and take it.\u201dZheng Qingfang berated. After that, he returned to the banquet table and drank a cup of wine. He couldn\u2019t control himself and stood up again to admire Sanzang\u2019s painting.The demeanor of Reverend Sanzang in this painting, who was heading to the west to obtain the true scriptures, was filled with an imposing spirit and immense determination. It would easily influence the heart of those who looked at it.Very soon, the old servant brought an old box over.\u201cLittle Friend Sun, this is just a small gift for you.\u201dZheng Qingfang took the box. He opened it and revealed a dagger within. \u201cThis a dagger bestowed to me by King Tang during my early years.\u201dKing Tang was the king of Tang Country.This dagger looked extremely gorgeous. Rather than a weapon that killed, it looked more like a work of art instead. Its hilt had many valuable gems embedded within. Its body was engraved with beautiful patterns and there was a string of pearls attached to the end of the hilt.After hearing Zheng Qingfang\u2019s introduction, Sun Mo glanced at the dagger as he activated Divine Sight.\u201cChasing Cloud Dagger. Length: 17 cm. It is a superior-grade spirit weapon. This dagger has the summoning effect. If you chant the spell words, you would be able to summon a soul beast.\u201dZheng Qingfang touched the dagger, and he was filled with a myriad of emotions.\u201cThis dagger once saved my life!\u201d Zheng Qingfang revealed a fond expression as he recalled his memories. \u201cBack then when I was surrounded by the army of Wu Country, I only managed to escape due to this dagger summoning a divine colt.\u201d\u201cUse this dagger to slice the skin on your finger and chant the spell words. You will then be able to summon a divine colt with the name \u2018Chasing Cloud\u2019. It can travel 1,000 miles per day without feeling fatigued,\u201d the old servant explained. He really felt a sense of reluctance seeing his old master want to give out this dagger, which had accompanied him for over thirty years.The so-called soul beast meant that it had already had its own intelligence. After the wild beasts died, those who had the spirit qi of heavens and earth in their bodies, in addition to their consciousness being firmly attached to this world, might be able to become soul beasts under a series of fortunate coincidences.The rate of a soul beast appearing was too low. Hence, the price for each one was invaluable. The value of Sun Mo\u2019s painting couldn\u2019t even compare with it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe divine colt Chasing Cloud was a Ferghana Horse. It was the mount of the previous generation King Tang and was heavily dotted on. After it died, because of its deep feelings for King Tang, it transformed into a soul beast and was willing to accompany him for as long as he lived.Because Chasing Cloud was now a soul beast, it wouldn\u2019t know fatigue. It didn\u2019t need to eat or drink. Its body was as light as a swallow and when it galloped, it could even catch up to the fleeting clouds in the sky. Hence, it has the name \u2018Chasing Cloud\u2019.\u201cThis dagger is a superior-grade spirit weapon. It hasn\u2019t reached the tier of a saint-weapon because its attack power is too low. But if you are talking about fleeing, this item is absolutely an item of the highest quality.\u201dZheng Qingfang passed the dagger to Sun Mo. \u201cAs long as you ride it, neither the white clouds in the sky and the gentle breeze on the ground will be able to catch up to you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No matter how much money you have, you can\u2019t buy a pleasant mood. Through these few years of retirement, today is undoubtedly my happiest day. I have read a masterpiece and seen the birth of a famous painting. How satisfying!\u201dAs Zheng Qingfang spoke, he emptied another cup and started coughing.\u201cOld Master, you\u2019ve drunk too much.\u201dThe old servant tried to advise him as he was worried about Zheng Qingfang\u2019s health.\u201cCough cough, it does no harm!\u201dZheng Qingfang indicated for the old servant to mind his own business.He had been a high-ranking official in the imperial court for so many years, so it was natural for him to have come across a few marveling sights of skillful painting. However, those few painters were old.After all, the skill of painting required valuable experience. But Sun Mo, how old was he? It was indeed too formidable for a twenty-year-old man to have reached such a state.As for his novel, even though his literature was not as superior, the story was extremely well-written. As Zheng Qingfang closed his eyes now, the arrogant and unyielding Monkey King, the determined and persistent Reverend Sanzang, the lecherous and greedy Zhu Bajie, and a Monk Sha[1] with no sense of existence but was still recallable, all remained vivid in his mind\u2026[2]Zheng Qingfang didn\u2019t dare to say that this novel was a masterpiece handed down from ancient times. However, in many years to come, there was no problem for it to become famous in Middle Earth Nine Provinces.Zheng Qingfang presented the chasing cloud dagger to Sun Mo out of admiration for his talent. This was because this teenager whose smile was as bright as sunshine had extraordinary skills in writing and painting.\u201cTake it, I\u2019m old anyway. I don\u2019t have a chance of riding a horse anymore.\u201dWhen Zheng Qingfang saw that Sun Mo declined, his expression became stiff. \u201cStop rejecting it, are you not treating me as a close friend?\u201dThe old servant was speechless. (Oh, Old Master, you can\u2019t ride a horse anymore, but your descendants still can, especially your grandson who has been eyeing after this dagger for a long time. Now that you have given it to Sun Mo, your grandson will surely find trouble for me.)\u201cIt\u2019s really too valuable!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cTeacher is so awesome!\u201dSeeing how Zheng Qingfang wanted to give such a precious spirit weapon to Sun Mo, Lu Zhiruo\u2019s entire heart was filled with admiration for her teacher.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +20.Prestige connection Lu Zhiruo: Friendly (233/1,000).\u201cTake it, if you\u2019re a man, then stop being wishy-washy!\u201dAfter Zheng Qingfang handed over the dagger to Sun Mo, he emptied another cup and started laughing uncontrollably.\u201cI have never expected to see the birth of a famous painting. Previously, I was still thinking if your painting was not too bad, then I would purchase one for ten taels of silver. Ridiculous, how ridiculous!\u201dZheng Qingfang thought that he was lucky he had not quoted a price, if not it would have been too embarrassing.Lu Zhiruo and the old servant laughed as well, ten taels of silver? Even if you multiplied it a hundred times, it wasn\u2019t enough to purchase the painting of Sanzang\u2019s journey.What could Sun Mo say? He passed the dagger to Lu Zhiruo and could only maintain his humble smile.Seeing how Sun Mo had restrained his curiosity and didn\u2019t immediately start to admire the dagger, the old servant was impressed with Sun Mo once again. It was a common sight that when people saw a treasure of this specific tier, they would start to fiddle with it without hesitation.Zheng Qingfang was drinking his wine while looking at Sun Mo. The more he looked, the more admiration he had for him. Sun Mo was not only good-looking, but he was also brimming with talent. Oh yes, should he marry his granddaughter to him? Then he could always be the first person to see his future works!The food and wine turned cold, and Zheng Qingfang asked the servant to leave. He switched to another table and continued to drink with Sun Mo. He was really over the moon today.After drinking for a moment, Zheng Qingfang couldn\u2019t help but look a few times at the script of [Journey to the West] again. Then, he got up to admire the painting of Sanzang.The portrait drawings of other characters were excellent as well. However, when compared to this piece, it was still somewhat inferior.\u201cEh? I keep feeling like it\u2019s lacking something?\u201dZheng Qingfang finally discovered the blind spot.Sun Mo was puzzled. On the contrary, Lu Zhiruo\u2019s small hand covered her mouth and reminded softly, \u201cIt\u2019s your name inscription!\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s name inscription. How can a famous piece of painting not have a name inscription?\u201dZheng Qingfang suddenly came to a realization and quickly asked Sun Mo to amend it.\u201cAh?\u201dSun Mo was a little embarrassed.\u201cQuickly write it. If you don\u2019t sign your name, how will anyone know it\u2019s your work?\u201d Zheng Qingfang urged him and suddenly responded, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you have never written a name inscription before? Hold on, could this be your first piece of creation?\u201dSun Mo nodded.\u201cThis is wonderful!\u201dZheng Qingfang was so excited he didn\u2019t use a wine cup anymore. He started pouring the wine into his mouth from the wine pot.\u201cOld Master!\u201dThe old servant jumped in shock.Zheng Qingfang burst into loud laughter. If Sun Mo were to become famous in the future, then his first piece of work would have such a high commemoration value. Hence, he quickly warned him again. \u201cYou must write down today\u2019s date and time!\u201dSun Mo was indifferent.\u201cAlso, if you wish to publish the book, you need a pseudonym usually. What do you intend to call yourself?\u201dZheng Qingfang indicated for Lu Zhiruo to eat more and not be too reserved.\u201cGoblin?\u201dSun Mo had wanted to name himself Wu Chengen to let people know who was the main author of [Journey to the West]. But he thought of how the book was written by him. Although the content was similar, the literature was different. Even the characters\u2019 impressions were somewhat edited by his own opinions. For example, Zhu Bajie was more annoying now and Sha Wujing was a two-faced person. Hence, he gave up that thought.\u201cGo\u2026\u2026Go what?\u201dHearing such a strange vocabulary, Zheng Qingfang wasn\u2019t able to form any inherent image in his brain.\u201cGoblin, it\u2019s a type of monster!\u201dSun Mo seemed to say it so carelessly, but he was actually trying to sound out Zheng Qingfang. For a high-ranking official like him, he must have come across many situations. If even he wasn\u2019t aware, then it was clear that such a thing didn\u2019t exist.\u201cHave you conceptualized it already? Is it a monster that\u2019s going to appear in the second half of [Journey to the West]?\u201dZheng Qingfang was curious.\u201cNo.\u201dSun Mo was someone with a vigorous desire for knowledge. He had wanted to find out if there were other places outside of Middle Earth Nine Provinces. For example, whether there were western countries, or whether there were dragons, swords, or magic.As of now, they didn\u2019t seem to exist.\u201cCould it be for another book then?\u201dZheng Qingfang stared at Sun Mo with a burning gaze. He couldn\u2019t wait for it.\u201cI\u2019ve decided, my pseudonym is Gandalf!\u201dSun Mo changed the topic. \u201cThere\u2019s no meaning to it, just a random name.\u201d\u201cThis is up to you!\u201dZheng Qingfang usually slept very early because of health reasons, but he couldn\u2019t stop chatting with Sun Mo today until very late at night.It was very late into the night and the school gate was already shut. Since Zheng Qingfang was being greatly hospitable, Sun Mo and Lu Zhiruo stayed for the night in the guest room.The next morning, Zheng Qingfang woke up early to have breakfast with Sun Mo despite still having a headache from the hangover. Then, he saw him off.\u201cOld Master, he isn\u2019t even a great teacher. He merely wrote an interesting novel and has pretty good painting skills. Must you be so nice to him?\u201dThe old servant couldn\u2019t understand why the Old Master had presented the chasing cloud dagger as a gift to Sun Mo.\u201cTo be able to hold my position in the imperial court for forty-seven years straight, it was all because I can spot talents with my eyes. That Sun Mo, he has the kind of temperament I can\u2019t describe!\u201dZheng Qingfang stood at the gate of the book store and gazed at the silhouette of the horse carriage in the distance.\u201cTemperament? I admit that he\u2019s quite good-looking!\u201dThe old servant didn\u2019t discover any impressive temperament.\u201cYou won\u2019t understand!\u201dZheng Qingfang didn\u2019t want to continue explaining. For Sun Mo to be able to draw like that, it was certain that he had endless knowledge in his mind. The concept of that painting was impossible to be feigned.\u201cThe next time Sun Mo comes, you must receive him as an important guest.\u201dZheng Qingfang instructed.\u2026After alighting from the horse carriage, Sun Mo paid for the ride and strolled in proudly.Lu Zhiruo carried a little wooden chest filled with a thousand taels of silver and followed behind Sun Mo like a little tail. Her gaze, filled with worship, looked toward Sun Mo from time to time.Teacher Sun was so awesome. Just by writing a novel, he had earned a thousand taels of silver. Additionally, there was a sum of author\u2019s remuneration awaiting. Not only that, but he also had excellent painting skills.She could never have expected that Teacher Sun was a painter capable of creating a famous painting of such standards. Those illustrations from yesterday were extremely god-like.\u201cAiya, I wish Teacher Sun would draw a portrait of me someday!\u201dLu Zhiruo pouted her lips and then she hurriedly touched the chasing cloud dagger that was tucked in her embrace.Fortunately, she didn\u2019t lose it. This was a spirit weapon. If it went missing, Lu Zhiruo might have to commit suicide in order to apologize for her offense.Recalling how Zheng Qingfang had given out such a precious gift, Lu Zhiruo still thought that it was unbelievable. If it were her, she wouldn\u2019t have given it out and would have left it for her own family instead.\u201cDiehard fans are so terrifying!\u201dLu Zhiruo sighed. \u201cBut Teacher Sun, who can conquer his diehard fans, is even more terrifying!\u201dDing!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +10.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Friendly (243/1,000).Hearing the notification sound, Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help but turn around. (I know your breasts are big, but you are not a milk cow, must you contribute favorable impression points so frequently, huh?)The papaya girl\u2019s eyes bent slightly, and she immediately let out a sweet smile. She carried the little wooden chest with one hand and grabbed Sun Mo\u2019s corner hem with the other.Seeing Sun Mo, Mister Qin, who had been guarding the gatehouse, walked over immediately to greet him.\u201cTeacher Sun, good morning!\u201d\u201cHello, Mister Qin!\u201dSun Mo nodded and handed over a packet of leaf tobacco. \u201cI bought this in the morning while passing by the street market!\u201d\u201cTeacher Sun, you are flattering me. I don\u2019t deserve it!\u201dMister Qin promptly gestured his hands without receiving the packet.As a guard, he had seen many people and heard a lot of gossip. Hence, Mister Qin already knew that Sun Mo had recruited five students. In fact, he had received the acknowledgment from the school\u2019s leaders. As for his official employment, it would likely be happening over these few days.When facing intern teachers, Mister Qin could still maintain some sense of superiority. After all, out of ten intern teachers, nine of them wouldn\u2019t be able to stay in the academy. However, he couldn\u2019t treat an official teacher that way.There was a very big difference between the status of a gatekeeper and a teacher. If not for Sun Mo\u2019s promotion, Mister Qin would never have put on his smiling face and taken the initiative to greet him. He wouldn\u2019t even have walked out from the gatehouse.\u201cJust take it, I don\u2019t know how to smoke tobacco with a pipe. It\u2019d be a waste to keep it with me.\u201dHow much money could a packet of tobacco cost? Even if Sun Mo didn\u2019t earn a big sum of money from his author\u2019s remuneration, he was still able to afford it. He was giving something to Mister Qin merely for the convenience of going in and out of the school gate in the future.Just in case he needed to return in the middle of the night next time, it would be easy for him to talk his way through the guarded entrance.Seeing how Sun Mo had indeed bought the tobacco for him, Mister Qin hurriedly rubbed both his hands against his trousers. After wiping off the sweat and dust, he bent over slightly and extended both hands to receive it.Sun Mo noticed the difference in Mister Qin\u2019s behavior. Last time, when he had given him the tobacco, Mister Qin had only received it with one hand. From these little movements, he could infer that Mister Qin had found out about his promotion.\u201cTeacher Sun, take care!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMister Qin waited until Sun Mo had walked off for about twenty meters before he returned to the gatehouse. After he kept the tobacco, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh with sorrow. (Look at that EQ of this guy. He indeed knows how to behave, so it\u2019s no wonder that he is able to live off Headmaster An.)Sun Mo put his stuff in place and went to the library to prepare for his lessons\u2019 materials. But not long after that, a young woman came to look for him.[1] Referring to Sha Wujing[2] Characters from Journey to the West (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Standing next to the desk, she was speaking with an ice-cold tone, cold enough to freeze a herd of hibernating rabbits to death.\u201cYou are?\u201dSun Mo frowned. Her attitude was not only cold. It was as if she had seen a rat that had been stealing her household\u2019s rice.\u201cZhou Lin, Headmaster An\u2019s female assistant!\u201d Zhou Lin urged, \u201cCome on, don\u2019t let Headmaster An wait for long.\u201dSun Mo packed his stuff and followed behind Zhou Lin.Under normal circumstances, one would try to maintain a good relationship with the female assistant of the Headmaster, as it would aid the development of one\u2019s career. However, Zhou Lin was so cold in her mannerisms that Sun Mo didn\u2019t want to be met with a cold rebuke after showing warm feelings.Of course, Sun Mo didn\u2019t care about maintaining a good relationship with An Xinhui either. He was depending on his talent to make a living, eh, actually according to his looks, it would be feasible to make a living out of his appearance too.Both persons didn\u2019t speak a word. Hence, on the way there, the awkward atmosphere didn\u2019t disperse.Zhou Lin was obviously unhappy with Sun Mo because of his status as An Xinhui\u2019s fiance.Zhou Lin was An Xinhui\u2019s junior, and she worshiped her so much. In Zhou Lin\u2019s eyes, all terrible men in the world were not fit to be with the perfect Eldest Miss.As for Sun Mo, Zhou Lin had naturally held prejudices against him without actual facts of how he was as a person; hence, she didn\u2019t want to find out more about him. She only wished Sun Mo would quickly rescind the engagement and get out of the school.Sun Mo fixed his eyes on Zhou Lin who was five meters ahead of him and activated his Divine Sight.Zhou Lin, female assistant, twenty-one years old, blood-ignition realm.Strength: 22, even though it isn\u2019t great, it is sufficient to hit a man\u2019s head till it explodes.Intellect: 25, her learning ability is very strong and her theoretical knowledge is solid. She has a developed memory and is a great material for an assistant.Agility: 27, running errands is her special strength.Endurance: 26, she once worked for five days straight without taking a rest.Will: 28, she is bigoted and self-centered. Once she has set her mind on something, she will be firm till the end and will never change her opinions easily.\u2026Potential value: above average.Remark: She has peculiar feelings toward An Xinhui and views men as extreme enemies.Sun Mo pouted.This data was very outstanding, except for her will that was intimidating at first glance. It was better not to marry such a woman; otherwise, there would be no peace at home in the future.He read on further. Her potential value was great, but what the hell was wrong with this remark?Sun Mo had a dumbfounded expression. He was looking at Zhou Lin while being utterly astonished. Was this grim-looking girl a lesbian? Sun Mo suddenly understood why Zhou Lin was so hostile toward him.(Oh f*ck, after analyzing for so long, is she treating me as her love rival?)All of a sudden, Zhou Lin turned her head around, looking at Sun Mo.And like a reflex, Sun Mo shifted his gaze away.Zhou Lin stared at Sun Mo in suspicion and snorted, knowing that there was nothing good about men. She felt so uncomfortable, as though a man had peeled off her clothes and was appreciating her naked body. This thought made her twist her body uncontrollably.Sun Mo must have been admiring her figure from behind, how disgusting!Zhou Lin bit her lips and quickened her footsteps.On the contrary, Sun Mo slowed down his pace. Facing a person with paranoia, he knew he had better remain at a respectful distance and should never come into contact with them. Otherwise, any of his unconcerned little movements might provoke that person and trigger a \u2018Ma-Jiajue-style'[1] murder case. If that happened, he could only blame his bad luck.They arrived at the Headmaster Office and coincidentally bumped into Gu Xiuxun who was leaving.\u201cTeacher Gu!\u201dZhou Lin took the initiative to greet Gu Xiuxun. A smile blossomed on her face.Actually, when this girl smiled, she was still considered good-looking. Similar to her potential value, it could be rated at seven points. If she was placed at No. 2 High School, there would easily be more than 10 guys trying to seek her attention even if she hadn\u2019t done anything to attract them.\u201cAssistant Zhou!\u201dAfter Gu Xiuxun greeted them, she waved her hand while facing Sun Mo. \u201cTeacher Sun, we\u2019re colleagues from now onward. Please remember to look after me!\u201d\u201cTeacher Gu must be joking. I should be the one being looked after by you!\u201dSun Mo laughed gently. After all, he had been a teacher-in-charge for six years and had equipped himself with some socializing abilities.\u201cHehe, I thought Teacher Sun will be going for an aloof teaching style.\u201dGu Xiuxun made fun of him.\u201cThen what style is Teacher Gu going for?\u201dSun Mo thought to himself that he must be on alert even if Gu Xiuxun was smiling at him like a flower. He had previously heard from a close friend that if a woman were to smile dazzlingly at you despite not loving you, then you had better be careful. She must be trying to lure you into a trap.This was his conclusion after having attended seventeen matchmaking sessions from an online dating website.\u201cTeacher Sun\u2019s words are a bit overbearing, but that\u2019s normal. You\u2019ve just recruited Xuanyuan Po and Li Ziqi. It\u2019s the best time to be proud of your success.\u201dGu Xiuxun sighed, revealing a look of unwillingness on her face.Sun Mo\u2019s keen observation detected how Zhou Lin, who was standing at the side, frowned after hearing these 2 names. She then glanced at Sun Mo and the loathing on her face disappeared instantly.\u201cAiya, how cunning is this masochist? Was she trying to incite Zhou Lin\u2019s unhappiness toward me? Would she talk bad about me in front of An Xinhui and create obstacles for me?\u201dSun Mo was still smiling but had marked Gu Xiuxun down in his mental booklet. Once there was an opportunity, he must let this masochist lick her own toes.If it wasn\u2019t for his experience, Sun Mo would have thought that Gu Xiuxun was trying to praise him.This was what office politics was. If you weren\u2019t paying attention, you would never know when you would be plotted against.\u201cIf you still have things to say, let\u2019s leave it until next time. Headmaster An is still waiting!\u201dZhou Lin interrupted.\u201cThen let\u2019s drink tea together one day!\u201dGu Xiuxun waved her hands and left. On the surface, her attitude remained friendly.If it were other men, they might have thought that Gu Xiuxun was interested in them. In that instant, they might have already planned for their children\u2019s names.Ding!\u201cMission announcement: please defeat Gu Xiuxun thoroughly in terms of teaching abilities within a year. You have to do it until she accepts her loss wholeheartedly. Your prize will be a silver treasure chest.\u201cRemark: if Gu Xiuxun is so impressed to the extent that she licks your toes, the system shall give you an additional reward of one mysterious treasure chest!\u201dSun Mo, who was just entering the door, got stunned. What the hell was this?He could understand the mission, as after all, it was an Absolute Great Teacher System. In the process of cultivating a great teacher, it was a common sight for the hosts to defeat other teachers. However, what was that remark all about?\u201cIt is what it is. If Gu Xiuxun willingly licks your toes, then it shows that she has accepted the fact that your teaching abilities are better. The system will naturally have to throw in additional rewards.\u201dThe system explained.\u201cAre you a sadist?\u201dSun Mo inquired.\u201cMake a guess?\u201dSometimes, the system had a very evil taste. \u201cOh yes, to encourage you, there will be a penalty as well. If you fail, you have to lick a big, burly man\u2019s sweaty feet that have been enclosed in sports shoes for a whole day.\u201d\u201cCan you be more unscrupulous than this?\u201dIn Sun Mo\u2019s heart, he was cursing the system\u2019s mom with vulgarities. \u201cI don\u2019t want such a great reward, can you just recall the penalty?\u201dThe system was silent and stopped entertaining Sun Mo.\u201cSun Mo?\u201dIn the office, An Xinhui\u2019s voice came through.Sun Mo could only suppress his anger and walked in.The office was huge but was furnished very simply. Other than a bookshelf that was filled with books, there were two rows of display cabinets. They were filled with all kinds of important trophies earned by Central Province Academy from the establishment day until now. There were a total of 62 trophies.These were all selected very carefully. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be enough space to display everything.In fact, before they were on the decline, it wasn\u2019t exaggerating to say that Central Province Academy was covered in glory.Seeing how Sun Mo\u2019s gaze landed on those trophies, An Xinhui revealed expressions of self-blame and self-mockery. \u201cThose were all in the past. For the last twenty years, the school has not received any important trophy.\u201d\u201cThere will be more in the future.\u201dSun Mo comforted her. On the first day when the intern teachers reported to the school, they had all been taken to the Honor Hall of the academy to take a look. The hall was filled with trophies, certificates, as well as banners!This was the reason why even though Central Province Academy had dropped to the bottom of D Grade schools and was about to be delisted, many students still came to register every year.An Xinhui stood up and extended her hand.\u201cAs the headmaster, I hope that you can put your talents into good use in this school. Please cultivate a few elite students and bring back one or two trophies for the school.\u201d\u201cHahaha, you must have said the same words to the others, right?\u201dSun Mo asked while laughing.Zhou Lin felt unhappy. Who did he think he was? Did he deserve any special treatment from Headmaster An?\u201cYes, I have said it many times over the last three years. But every time I say it, it\u2019s from the bottom of my heart.\u201dAn Xinhui looked straight into Sun Mo\u2019s eyes with a sincere gaze.Looking at this woman with sunken cheeks, Sun Mo knew that she had been overworking herself. Thus, Sun Mo grabbed her hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m employed here not because of you nor the school. A lot of people are saying that I am living off a woman, and I just want to prove them wrong!\u201d\u201cSun Mo!\u201dAfter hearing this reply, Zhou Lin was immediately filled with anger and berated him.An Xinhui raised her hand, indicating Zhou Lin to shut her mouth. Her gaze was still fixed on Sun Mo, but without any fluctuation of emotion. In her inner heart, she could feel an additional sense of surprise.The Little Momo, who had been tailing behind her butt during their childhood, had now become so masculine?\u201cWhere\u2019s the pen? I\u2019ll sign it!\u201dSun Mo had already seen an official employment letter on the work desk with his name on it.Suddenly, the atmosphere became silent. Only the sounds of a pen scribbling against paper could be heard in the office.Even though the system had announced a mission that within one year, he should help Central Province Academy achieve top 5 in the D Grade league tournament, Sun Mo wasn\u2019t interested in it at all.The reason why Sun Mo stayed here was just as he had explained, to prove himself.Leaving dejectedly after receiving contempt and hostility from people?Sorry, that was impossible for Sun Mo. He would wave his fists and punch his opponents so ferociously until all their teeth dropped.Sun Mo planned to guide a few top students in the school and become the most formidable and well-known great teacher! He wanted to shut all those annoying people up.An Xinhui looked at Sun Mo\u2019s pretty face. For the first time, her slightly furrowed brows smoothened out and she had a smile on her face.She was full of admiration for Sun Mo who had such a mentality. If their situation was better, she wouldn\u2019t even hesitate to marry him.\u201cSigh, grandfather, what a tough problem you have given me!\u201dAn Xinhui sighed with a myriad of sorrows!Ding!Favorable impression points from An Xinhui +5Prestige connection with An Xinhui, neutral (15/100).Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo didn\u2019t take note of An Xinhui\u2019s expression because just as he signed his name on the letter of employment, the system\u2019s notification rang.Ding!\u201cCongratulations, you have completed the mission. Within half a month, you have risen from a teaching assistant to become an official teacher. Your prize is a silver treasure chest!\u201d[1] A notorious murder case: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_JiajuePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 - Entering Official EmploymentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73: Entering Official EmploymentLordbluefireA treasure chest that was flashing with silvery light dropped down right before him.Sun Mo wanted to open it up immediately, but considering how there\u2019d be a high chance of him wasting this treasure chest given his unlucky physique, he could only suppress the urge.He\u2019d better open it after patting the papaya girl to increase his luck.\u201cHere are two sets of teacher attire. If they are torn, you can go to the logistics department to get new ones.\u201dAn Xinhui handed a stack of folded clothes to Sun Mo.The sky blue material didn\u2019t look extravagant, but it had a special meaning. Moreover, the school emblem on the left side of his chest represented the Central Province Academy\u2019s recognition of his status as a teacher.Right now, the Central Province Academy was in decline and the teachers\u2019 reputation also dropped a little. More than ten years ago, the Central Province Academy\u2019s teachers would be able to get their bills waived when they went out to eat or to buy things while wearing their uniforms.Of course, the teachers weren\u2019t short of this bit of money. It was just that this was a representation of their status and identity. It showed that they were respected and adored.\u201cHow\u2019s the salary?\u201dSun Mo recalled his pathetic salary back in No.2 High School. He wasn\u2019t even able to afford the down payment for a house. That was why he hadn\u2019t managed to get a girlfriend until now.He had no choice. Without a house, who\u2019d want to be in a relationship with him?An Xinhui didn\u2019t expect that Sun Mo would ask this so blatantly, and she was a little stunned. Zhou Lin, who was at the side, had her eyes and mouth wide open.(You are a teacher and should have your priorities on teaching and nurturing. You should be shy when talking about money. How can you take the initiative to ask about your salary? You were still saying earlier that you were going to prove yourself. How come you\u2019ve become so mercenary now?)If it wasn\u2019t because An Xinhui had glared at her, Zhou Lin would have wanted to speak sarcastically toward him.\u201c100 taels per month!\u201dAn Xinhui replied.\u201cAre there any other benefits?\u201dSun Mo was very satisfied. To a teacher who was just converted into a permanent position, this salary wasn\u2019t considered low. An ordinary family of three would only spend over 100 taels in a year.\u201cFood in the canteen and the residence is free. Moreover, there were the heatstroke prevention fee and warmth fee in summer and winter, as well as the gifts every festive. All of these add up to a lot of money.\u201dZhou Lin spoke up quickly, her tone filled with a sense of superiority.It was because she was very proud of this. After all, their school\u2019s benefits weren\u2019t bad compared to the Myriad Daos Academy.\u201cIt seems that a lean camel is still bigger than a horse. The Central Province Academy doesn\u2019t seem to be as dilapidated and poor as the rumors make it out to be?\u201dSun Mo immediately retorted.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dZhou Lin was so angry that she wanted to spew out blood. Could they have an enjoyable talk?\u201cEven if I have to have it hard, the teachers\u2019 benefits won\u2019t be reduced.\u201dAn Xinhui explained. This was how she had been doing this. Over the past two years, the Central Province Academy\u2019s funds had been reaching its end, but she had never reduced all these expenses.The scholarships were also given out as usual. It was because some poor students had to rely on scholarships to be able to continue their studies.Sun Mo looked at An Xinhui, not knowing what to say. Although her moon-white long robe had been washed cleanly, it was apparent that she had been wearing it for a few years based on the degree it was wearing out.To a 3-star great teacher, such clothes were too shabby.\u201cIs that so? Then I\u2019ll rest at ease and eat braised meat every meal. It\u2019s free anyway!\u201d After saying that, Sun Mo patted his clothes. \u201cIs there anything else? If not, then I\u2019ll be leaving!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all!\u201dAn Xinhui instructed, \u201cZhou Lin, bring Sun Mo to take a look at the office and to familiarize with the other teachers.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dZhou Lin had a strong urge to strangle Sun Mo to death. Eat meat for every meal? Eldest Miss hadn\u2019t eaten any meat for very long. The meals she had every day were all very simple.After Sun Mo left, An Xinhui had just sat down when she heard his voice ringing out from outside.\u201cWhich date is the salary paid out? There won\u2019t be any delays, right?\u201d\u201cIf I bring students to the canteen for meals, can their meals be waived? No? Then what about half price?\u201d\u201cThe free food can\u2019t be of a limited quantity, right?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s voice was very pleasant, sounding warm as if sunlight was shining down on one\u2019s body, giving off a sense of security. However, the things he was saying now were deserving of a beating.An Xinhui could imagine how angry Zhou Lin would be.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that Sun Mo would change so much after a few years. He has such a sharp tongue now!\u201dAn Xinhui couldn\u2019t help but smile. Even the fatigue she had been feeling over the past few days had suddenly lightened by a lot. She recalled the scene she saw the other day where the 4-star great teacher Yue Rongbo was trying to fight for Sun Mo.\u201cIt seems that you\u2019re something, to be able to recruit five students. Will you let me see you in a different light one more time?\u201dAn Xinhui mumbled then went back to her work. There were only six months left.The Central Province Academy\u2019s situation was very bad and they couldn\u2019t afford to lose anymore. If they still didn\u2019t manage to get a good ranking in this year\u2019s league tournament, they\u2019d be removed from their title as a famous school.If that were to happen, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get back up again.\u2026The Central Province Academy hoped that the teachers could have exchanges and learn from each other, helping each other to improve. Therefore, they had a big office concept.Within an office, there\u2019d be great teachers of different levels, ranging from 2-star great teachers to newly employed teachers.Of course, great teachers who were 3-star or above wouldn\u2019t be included. All of them had their own private offices.\u201cIt\u2019s over here. The table on the left is yours. If you have any problems, you can ask the other teachers.\u201dAfter saying that, Zhou Lin quickly left. She was afraid that if she continued to stay here, she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back and want to beat up Sun Mo. This guy\u2019s tongue was too sharp.The teachers knew that there\u2019d be a new guy joining today. So when they heard sounds, they couldn\u2019t help but look up.At the instant Sun Mo entered, he revealed his eight teeth and switched to his amicable mode, greeting everyone, \u201cHello teachers. Please give me your guidance.\u201dSun Mo had used a ruler to measure how many teeth would be shown according to the degree he smiled. He continued to practice every day for a few years when he brushed his teeth every morning and night.There were a total of ten desks in the office, with them being grouped in sets of two. Therefore, the teachers were all seated in a way where every two of them would be facing each other.Sun Mo immediately saw Lian Zheng, who had a rough face. The two of them had a quarrel before over Jiang Leng, so their relationship was a little sour.Lian Zheng was looking straight at Sun Mo with a head-strong disposition.Other than him, there were six other teachers present. An old man and a woman with short hair nodded at him. The other four teachers either threw a glance at him and went back to their work or were expressionless.\u201cThe workforce isn\u2019t easy!\u201dSun Mo exclaimed in his heart. But getting him to lower his stance and currying up to others just to improve his relationship with other colleagues? That was impossible. Therefore, he walked straight to his desk after greeting them.\u201cI thought that Teacher Gu would be the one assigned here!\u201dJiang Yongnian stroked his chin, looking disappointed. Although he didn\u2019t harbor any thoughts toward Gu Xiuxun, one\u2019s mood would be better to be able to work alongside a beautiful colleague.When a young man who was in his twenties and had a light birthmark on the corner of his forehead heard this, his expression became a lot more displeased when he looked at Sun Mo.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201dThe white-haired old man took the initiative to ask.\u201cSun Mo!\u201dSun Mo replied.\u201cHmm?\u201dThe old man\u2019s smile suddenly stiffened up and he looked around. It was easy to tell what his expression was saying. (Did I hear wrongly? Or were the school\u2019s leaders mistaken?)(Sun Mo? Isn\u2019t he the one who sponges off a woman?)\u201cTeacher Pan, you\u2019ve gone back home to see your grandson during the past few days so you might not be aware of this. There were only four intern teachers who had managed to recruit five students this time around.\u201dZhou Shanyi smiled and replied, making it very clear that Sun Mo had passed the test.\u201cFour?\u201dPan Yi counted with his fingers. \u201cThat isn\u2019t right. I remember that other than Gu Xiuxun, whom Headmaster An had headhunted from the Myriad Daos Academy, there are three other graduates from the Nine Greats, right?\u201dPan Yi then turned to take a glance at Sun Mo. There was no way this guy was able to get into the Nine Greats.\u201cQin Fen quit!\u201dJiang Yongnian had always been up to date with the latest news.\u201cHuh? Why? I remember that he had been headhunted by Headmaster An personally. Were there any accidents?\u201dPan Yi was very surprised.There were three factions in the school, led by the two vice-headmasters\u2014Zhang Hanfu and Wang Su, as well as the headmaster An Xinhui. An Xinhui\u2019s faction was the weakest amongst the three. That was why she had gone out personally to headhunt people, wanting to increase her faction\u2019s forces. He didn\u2019t expect that Qin Fen had quitted.\u201cHe lost in a competition and was too ashamed to stay on!\u201dJiang Yongnian was a talkative person.\u201cWho did he lose to?\u201dPan Yi was very curious. It was normal for there to be contradictions between teachers. So what could they do? They could just compete and not scold each other like shrews. That\u2019d be lacking class. What the teachers loved to do the most was to crush their opponents with their strength.\u201cThere, the person is right in front of you!\u201dJiang Yongnian teased.Pan Yi looked toward Sun Mo and couldn\u2019t help but cry out, \u201cHuh? Is that for real?\u201dTo speak the truth, his words were a little rude. However, Pan Yi was a 1-star great teacher so there was no way that he\u2019d care about what a newly employed teacher would think.Sun Mo had just found out that Qin Fen had quitted and was a little surprised.The lips of Yi Jiamin, who had a faint birthmark on his forehead, twitched when he heard this. Such trashy achievements were worth boasting about?\u201cSun Mo, your seat is over here!\u201d The short-haired woman who was in her thirties smiled and called out to Sun Mo. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t know or aren\u2019t sure of, you can ask me!\u201d\u201cThank you, sister!\u201dSun Mo had just wanted to ask for her name when the short-haired woman said it.\u201cI\u2019m called Xia Yuan. You can call me Sister Sia or Teacher Sia. Either is fine.\u201dXia Yuan had a friendly attitude.\u201cSister Xia!\u201dIn such times, this address was a lot more cordial. Sun Mo had just come to this place and didn\u2019t know about the complicated relationship between the different factions in the school. However, by the looks of it, Xia Yuan should belong to An Xinhui\u2019s faction.Sun Mo\u2019s guess was right. An Xinhui had specially picked out an office for him where the colleagues had a pretty amicable relationship. Also, she had instructed Xia Yuan to help him out more.After staying in the office for ten or more minutes and familiarizing himself with the environment, Sun Mo left.It wasn\u2019t a pleasant first meeting with his colleagues, but Sun Mo didn\u2019t mind that.This place was Middle-Earth\u2019s nine provinces. If the teachers wished to get other people\u2019s respect, what they relied on was how many great teacher halos they grasped, their own level, as well as how many students under them were able to get onto the Greencloud Rankings.If ordinary teachers were unable to pass the Saint Gate\u2019s great teacher test and get \u2018stars\u2019, they wouldn\u2019t get recognition and respect from other teachers with \u2018stars\u2019 even if they were able to do wonders with their teachings.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be angry even though you\u2019ve been treated so coldly?\u201dThe system was surprised.\u201cRespect is earned through one\u2019s capabilities and not begged for. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll let them see me in a different light sooner or later.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s mind was on that silver treasure chest, and thus he went to look for Lu Zhiruo to increase his luck. He wondered what good item he\u2019d be able to get.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Therefore, the places where she\u2019d go were very limited.Other than the dorm, canteen, and library\u2014places where she could be alone by herself\u2014there was only the warehouse.Li Gong\u2019s small space had become Lu Zhiruo\u2019s private base that she used for training and meditation.When Sun Mo came, she saw the papaya girl practicing her sword here.She was panting and her clothes were completely soaked. However, she still didn\u2019t show any intention of stopping.Sun Mo nodded. Although Lu Zhiruo\u2019s potential value was very low, her hard work and attitude were commendable.\u201cTeacher Sun?\u201dLu Zhiruo immediately stopped when she saw Sun Mo, and she came running over. Her big and beautiful eyes curved into two crescents.\u201cHow are you getting along with your dorm mates?\u201dSun Mo handed her a candy. After Lu Zhiruo took it, he rubbed her head.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s alright!\u201dLu Zhiruo took off the wrapper but didn\u2019t eat the candy. Instead, she fed it to Sun Mo.\u201cYou eat. I don\u2019t like sweet things.\u201dSun Mo said to her and thought the word \u2018open\u2019.The silver treasure chest appeared before him and released a brilliant glow. After the light dissipated, what was left behind was a book that was shrouded in a faint golden glow.\u201cSkill book?\u201dSun Mo was elated and wanted to cry out \u2018My prided papaya girl\u2019s luck is really the best in the world! To think that patting her head can bring another skill book!\u2019Ding!\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019ve obtained \u2018Spirit-Gathering Rune\u2019 Depiction Technique, grandmaster-grade!\u201dThe system\u2019s congratulation rang out.\u201cHaha!\u201dSun Mo broke out laughing. It was another grandmaster-grade skill. This was excellent!Lu Zhiruo sneaked looks at Sun Mo. (What\u2019s the matter with Teacher Sun? Why is he smiling so happily? Did he pick up money again? No, Teacher isn\u2019t such a low-class person. Even if he were to pick up money, he\u2019d return it to the owner.)\u201cAlthough it\u2019s not a bad thing to be hardworking, you must have enough rest as well. Don\u2019t overwork yourself.\u201dSun Mo instructed her and then went to the library to get some information. Although the owner of this body had some knowledge about \u2018spirit rune words\u2019, they were insufficient. He needed more detailed information.The Central Province Academy\u2019s learning atmosphere wasn\u2019t bad. There were almost no empty seats regardless of what time one headed to the library. Therefore, all the students just picked the book of their choice and sat on the ground, leaning against the bookshelves as they read.Sun Mo found the books of spirit runes and started to read from the foundational ones.Spirit runes were diagrams that were drawn out using unique ink that contained spirit qi. After they were activated, they would produce all sorts of different effects.For example, the Spirit-Gathering Rune was a diagram that could gather spirit qi. After the diagram was activated, the surrounding spirit qi would be sucked into it.Sun Mo flipped through the books for a while and understood.Spirit runes were like magic scrolls in the magic-themed games and movies. After activation, the magic that was on the scrolls would be released.It was like how after a fireball scroll was activated, one could release a big ball of fire.The ink used to draw spirit runes must contain spirit qi. Therefore, people often used fresh blood or ground bone powder from ferocious beasts, medicinal herbs, ores, and other things that had spirit qi in it.In Middle-Earth\u2019s nine provinces, the teachers must grasp one or many secondary occupations in order to become great teachers with \u2018stars\u2019. This was the requirement set by the Saint Gate.Alchemists, weaponsmiths, beast tamers, herbalists, spirit rune masters, and doctors were all relatively popular secondary occupations.Why did the teachers flock toward them?It was because not only would they be able to show off, but the demand for these occupations were also high, and most importantly, they\u2019d be able to earn money.Out of all of them, alchemy and weaponsmithing were the most popular. Even cultivators who weren\u2019t great teachers would study these two areas.It was because alchemical pills and weapons were things that would accompany a cultivator for life. Alchemical pills could help one advance levels, heal injuries, replenish spirit qi, and many others. If one could refine these themselves, even if the pills couldn\u2019t be sold and were left for themselves, it\u2019d at least be cheaper than to buy them from elsewhere!As for weapons, if one could forge a spirit weapon or even saint weapon, they\u2019d strike it rich.The owner of this body had previously chosen alchemy as his secondary occupation, and he was only at the elementary-grade. Other people would probably despise him even if he were to work as an apprentice.Spirit rune masters weren\u2019t as popular as alchemists and weaponsmiths. However, they weren\u2019t bad either.Sun Mo continued to read books to have a better understanding of spirit rune words.Three hours later, the system felt displeased. \u201cAre you going to learn it or not?\u201dTo the system, this was a humiliation.\u201cI must emphasize that no skills given by the system are trash. You should be appreciative!\u201dSun Mo ignored the system\u2019s nagging. Seeing that there wasn\u2019t anyone nearby, he took out the grandmaster-grade \u2018Spirit-Gathering Rune\u2019 Depiction Technique and shattered it with a slap from his palm.Pa!The skill book shattered into golden light spots like fireflies and then shot toward Sun Mo\u2019s forehead. Nothing was left behind.A massive amount of knowledge instantly gushed into Sun Mo, causing him some headache. He recalled the scene from his younger days in the countryside where the heartless traders would take a water pump and pumped in water into living pigs.However, this process wasn\u2019t long. About ten or more seconds, that knowledge was digested, and all sorts of professional jargon and concepts flashed past in his mind.Sun Mo didn\u2019t need to think and naturally knew what they were talking about.It was like looking at a question asking what 1+1 was. He\u2019d be able to write down the answer \u20182\u2019 without any hesitation. It was because it was too simple that it had become instinctive.Sun Mo thought about all the information about the \u2018Spirit-Gathering Rune\u2019 Depiction Technique, and his expression turned into that of a pleasant surprise. He couldn\u2019t help but praise.\u201cSystem, this is really amazing!\u201dThe Spirit-Gathering Rune was the most basic, common, and practical spirit runes in spirit rune words. It could be said that if a cultivator were to purchase spirit runes, then the first thing they\u2019d buy would be the Spirit-Gathering Rune.True to its name, the Spirit-Gathering Rune gathered spirit qi.Cultivations required spirit qi for their meditation, training, and attempts to break through levels. It could be said that spirit qi was the core of all cultivators in Middle-Earth\u2019s Nine Provinces.Cultivating was the process of absorbing spirit qi. If the spirit density around one was high, then things would naturally progress very easily.\u201cHmph, of course! I\u2019m the best!\u201dThe system was very proud.\u201cThen how amazing is my Depiction Technique?\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t done with his questions, so he allowed the system to be proud for a while.\u201cRanked third in Central Province Academy, seventh in Jinling City, and 26th in the entire Central Province,\u201d the system replied.\u201cIt isn\u2019t even top in the school, yet you dare say that you\u2019re the best?\u201dSun Mo teased. He was actually very pleased.\u201cThat\u2019s crap. You have just obtained the Spirit-Gathering Rune Depiction Technique, yet you\u2019re still not satisfied with this ranking? Those who are ranked in front of you specialize in spirit rune words. Which of them hadn\u2019t spent over ten, twenty years, or even half of their lifetime on this subject? What are you using to compare against them?\u201dSun Mo had long since guessed this possibility, but he still couldn\u2019t help but want to ask.\u201cWhat if we put an age limit? Let\u2019s say, amongst those 30 years old and below. What rank would my Depiction Technique be at?Sun Mo was 20 years old this year and his expectations weren\u2019t high. He just wanted to be better than people who were ten years older than him.\u201cRanked first in Central Province Academy, second in Jinling City, and fifth across the entire Central Province.\u201dThe system replied without hiding anything.\u201cOnly second in Jinling City?\u201dSun Mo smacked his lips.\u201cBe content. You haven\u2019t even drawn a single spirit rune yet!\u201dIf the system had eyes, it would really want to roll its eyes 100 times.\u201cHow do I raise my ranking?\u201dSun Mo was displeased. He wanted to be number one, at least in Jinling City.\u201cPractice makes perfect.\u201dThe system\u2019s reply was with the most pristine principle.\u201cIt seems that I\u2019ll have to work hard for a while!\u201dIn order to become a 1-star great teacher, he would need to be proficient in a secondary occupation.Given the original owner\u2019s pathetic alchemy standard, Sun Mo would have to spend a lot of time in order to become proficient in it. However, things were different from spirit rune words.Sun Mo had already grasped the grandmaster-grade \u2018Spirit-Gathering Rune\u2019. This in itself would become a valuable experience.Ordinary people would have to spend at least ten years in order to reach this level. Therefore, Sun Mo could be considered to be at the elementary-grade in spirit runes. He just needed to work a little harder and the learning would progress steadily.Of course, other than that, it was also very tempting to use the \u2018Spirit-Gathering Rune\u2019 to earn money.Sun Mo had a high level of mastery in painting. The art pieces he came up with were definitely of great quality. However, what was the use of that?In any era, only a minority would be able to admire these art pieces and were willing to spend money to collect them. Moreover, many artists tended to be poor while they were still alive, and their art pieces would only be treated as antiques, with their prices hiking up a few hundred years after the artists\u2019 death. But what would that have anything to do with the artist themselves?The Spirit-Gathering Rune was better. He could sell them for money after drawing them.\u201cAlright, I don\u2019t have any more questions. System, dismissed!\u201dSun Mo started humming as if he could already see a lot of money with wings flying into his pockets. He believed that it wouldn\u2019t be long before he could provide for Lu Zhiruo. Moreover, he could add two more eggs for breakfast every morning, eating one and throwing the other one!Ding!\u201cMission released. Please complete 1,000 spirit runes within a month. The reward will be one black-iron treasure chest. If the mission fails, the grade of the skill will drop.\u201d\u201cTo hell with you!\u201dSun Mo cursed. Did the system have to be so narrow-minded? Could they still be friends and get along happily?If he wasn\u2019t able to complete the mission and the Depiction Technique dropped directly to the elementary-grade, then wouldn\u2019t he cry to his death?Although he had received the punishing mission, Sun Mo didn\u2019t have the time to draw the spirit runes. It was because it was about time for the first public lecture. He needs to make preparations and get a great start for his first job.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo knew that given his identity as An Xinhui\u2019s fianc\u00e9, many people would be biased against him, not liking him.The first part of the public lecture had a Q&A segment. There\u2019d definitely be many people trying to make things difficult for him then. They\u2019d want to deal him blows until he scrammed out of the school.\u201cHmph, I\u2019ll definitely not let things go the way you guys want it to!\u201dSun Mo said firmly. Back in No.2 High School, he had the nickname \u2018Black Doggy Sun\u2019. If he was serious in wanting to shoot at a person, he\u2019d be like a wild dog that had broken off from its leash. Even he\u2019d be afraid of himself!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - First Public LecturePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75: First Public LectureLordbluefireIn the vice-headmaster\u2019s office.\u201cHow are the preparations?\u201dZhang Hanfu was drinking tea while casually flipping through a document.\u201cAfter tomorrow\u2019s public lecture, I guarantee that Sun Mo\u2019s teaching life in Central Province Academy will reach its end.\u201dFeng Zewen\u2019s lips curled up. Although Zhang Hanfu didn\u2019t point out a specific name, he knew that the reason the vice-headmaster had called him here was over this matter.However, vice-headmaster, weren\u2019t you being too insistent on revenge?\u201cVery good!\u201dZhang Hanfu nodded. \u201cAren\u2019t you stopping too long at being a 1-star great teacher? If you don\u2019t rise up by another star-level, it\u2019d be awkward for me to give you a promotion!\u201dHis words weren\u2019t absolute in the Central Province Academy yet. With An Xinhui and Wang Su around, he was really restricted when doing things. Sigh, when would he be able to kick them away?At the thought of this, Zhang Hanfu felt displeased. Therefore, he had an even stronger urge to get rid of that Sun Mo, who dared to challenge him. He wanted to let the other teachers know how horrible a plight they would have if they were to offend him.Knock knock!The sound of door knocks rang out and Gao Ben walked in.\u201cI\u2019ll take my leave then!\u201dFeng Zewen took this opportunity to get up and left.\u201cSit!\u201dZhang Hanfu was polite toward this teacher whom he had personally recruited. He wore a smile on his face and instructed his female assistant to quickly serve tea.\u201cWhy were you looking for me?\u201dGao Ben had his arrogance. It was because he felt that capability was equivalent to confidence, and thus he didn\u2019t feel restricted or uneasy at all. He also didn\u2019t smile or try to curry up to Zhang Hanfu.\u201cI hope that your first public lecture can be arranged at 9 a.m. the day after tomorrow!\u201dZhang Hanfu frowned.\u201cTo deal with Sun Mo?\u201dGao Ben was spot on. It was because the school had already put up the announcement for Sun Mo\u2019s first public lecture.As Sun Mo was An Xinhui\u2019s fianc\u00e9, he had a great reputation and the news spread very quickly. At the very least, all the teachers knew about it and there were even quite a number of them who planned on forming groups and attending his lecture.\u201cDeal with Sun Mo? Does he deserve to be your opponent?\u201dZhang Hanfu asked him back.\u201cHaha!\u201dGao Ben burst out laughing and took a sip of tea.\u201cThen what do you think?\u201dZhang Hanfu asked, grinning.(This old guy is threatening me again!)Gao Ben cursed in his heart. However he knew that relying on his backing meant that he wouldn\u2019t be able to go against his orders. Therefore, he nodded.In fact, Gao Ben had wanted to arrange his first public lecture to be at the same time as Gu Xiuxun\u2019s. He would then use the bursting number of attendees for his class to prove that he was superior to her.The number of participants in one\u2019s public lecture was also an indicator in between the teachers\u2019 competition. If all of their public lectures were full, then they\u2019d be the school\u2019s primary force and would be nurtured carefully.\u201cVery good. You must let the lecture theater that can accommodate 300 people be full.\u201dZhang Hanfu smiled.\u2026Three days passed by very quickly, like fine sand that slipped through one\u2019s fingers.When the morning light shone down into the dorm, Sun Mo got up. He washed up and changed into his azure long robe.\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful!\u201dLudi couldn\u2019t help but exclaim.The robe was made of cotton and had a simple design. It wasn\u2019t considered beautiful at all. However, it had a great significance as it represented one\u2019s status as an official teacher in the Central Province Academy.Ludi was moaning at his own fate when he looked at the school emblem on Sun Mo\u2019s chest. He had no idea when he\u2019d have the rights to put on the teacher\u2019s long robe.Zhang Sheng curled up under his blankets. When he heard Ludi\u2019s words, he couldn\u2019t help but open up a small gap and sneak a peek. He then felt very gloomy.He had thought that he\u2019d be the only teacher in this dorm who would be able to stay behind. He hadn\u2019t expected that Sun Mo managed to beat him to it. This difference between them made him felt extremely unbearable. It was as if he had thought of the name for the child between him and his goddess, but ended up finding out that his beloved goddess was being embraced and kissed by Sun Mo.Sun Mo tidied his collar and Zhang Sheng\u2019s eyes twitched.Sun Mo smoothen out the wrinkles in his clothes and Zhang Sheng\u2019s lips twitched.There was no other way around it. Sun Mo\u2019s actions made Zhang Sheng feel as if he was seeing Sun Mo\u2019s big tongue probing into his beloved goddess\u2019s mouth, and was stirring around without restraint.If it wasn\u2019t because Zhang Sheng still had a hint of rationality left in him, he really wanted to jump out and break Sun Mo\u2019s head.Ludi\u2019s expression seemed conflicted, as if he wanted to say something. It was only until he saw that Sun Mo was about to leave that he quickly spoke up, \u201cSun\u2026 Teacher Sun!\u201d\u201cIs something the matter?\u201dSun Mo frowned slightly.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ve braised pig trotters. Do you want to try one?\u201dLudi felt awkward after saying this. However, it was like after selling one\u2019s body for the first time, they\u2019d get used to the subsequent times, Ludi started to speak a lot more fluently after that.\u201cThey are cooked in seasoned soup stock and the flavors are well-infused. Even Teacher Zhou Shanyi said that they taste good!\u201d\u201cOh, thank you. I don\u2019t like to eat things that are too oily for breakfast!\u201dSun Mo rejected.Ludi heaved a sigh of relief after seeing the door closing. He had finally taken the first step in an attempt to fix their relationship. Thankfully he hadn\u2019t offended Sun Mo like Yuan Feng had did. Otherwise, he could only change to another dorm now.\u201cBootlicker!\u201dZhang Sheng silently cursed. His limbs then fell down weakly as he lay on the bed, looking up at the ceiling in a daze.The beautiful figure of the goddess in his heart appeared before him once again. However, right now, her face was covered in Sun Mo\u2019s disgusting saliva.\u2026After entering the teaching building, Qi Shengjia urged for the fifth time, \u201cHurry up. If we\u2019re late, then there might be no seats left!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? Sun Mo isn\u2019t famous anyway. I reckon that it\u2019d probably be great if there are 20 students who are here to listen to his public lecture.\u201dZhou Xu yawned. He wanted to experience the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands again and thus came to show support for Sun Mo.\u201cDid you guys see the announcement? Teacher Gao Ben\u2019s public lecture is today as well. Why don\u2019t we go over and listen to it first? If he takes a liking to us, we might be able to become his personal disciple.\u201dWang Hao suggested.Given his aptitude, it was impossible for him to become a great teacher\u2019s personal disciple. Therefore, he had to go for the second best. Moreover, Gao Ben was a graduate from the Liang Province\u2019s Westshore Military School\u2014a famous school that was part of the Nine Greats. He was very amazing.\u201cI\u2019m not going!\u201dQi Shengjia refused decisively. He was sure to support Sun Mo.\u201cI\u2019m fine with anything!\u201dZhou Xu didn\u2019t mind.Wang Hao\u2019s eyes rolled and he smiled. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go and find out information about Teacher Gao Ben.\u201dAfter saying that, Wang Hao ran off.\u201cOne can only succeed after grabbing onto opportunities. Although Sun Mo\u2019s reputation is great, his reputation is a negative one. Everyone is saying that he\u2019s someone who sponges off a woman.\u201dWang Hao mumbled. He felt that even if there were people who went to listen to Sun Mo\u2019s public lecture, it\u2019d be to watch him making a joke of himself.It was one thing for him to show support if it was any other time. However, Teacher Gao Ben was conducting a class today, so he was sure to go and try his luck over there.In the lecture theater in the northwest corner on the third level of the teaching building.When Qi Shengjia arrived, it was quite late. Therefore, he walked very quickly. However, he had just stepped into the classroom and took a look when his neck instantly shrank back. He subconsciously wanted to leave.Bang!Qi Shengjia knocked into Zhou Xu, who was behind him.\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 the matter?\u201dBefore Zhou Xu finished his words, his voice softened a lot. It was because there were several tens of teachers seated in the lecture theater.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201dZhou Xu was surprised. He looked at the last row and saw that even Headmaster An Xinhui was here. Two seats away from her was Jin Mujie, the most famous 3-star great teacher in the school.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why did so many teachers come?\u201dQi Shengjia mumbled softly.\u201cHow would I know.\u201dZhou Xu rolled his eyes. However, as he was born in a family of traders, in addition to the guidance his father had given him since young, he had a wider outlook toward things. He reckoned that these teachers were probably here to give Sun Mo trouble.It made sense. An Xinhui was the goddess for all the male teachers and students in the school. However, she suddenly became Sun Mo\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Of course everyone would be displeased.There was a segment for questions and answers on the first public lecture. This was an open chance for them to make things difficult for Sun Mo. There was no way that they\u2019d let this chance slip by.\u201cSun Mo is in for it!\u201dZhou Xu tugged at Qi Shengjia then found a seat for them.Qi Shengjia felt uneasy. When he saw a 16-year-old guy entering while being surrounded by over ten other students, he felt even more nervous.\u201cWhy is Zhou Yong here?\u201dQi Shengjia was very worried. This student was a well-known prick in the school. Just because his father was one of the top ten wealthiest merchants in Jinling City, giving him a very strong background, he thus usually acted arrogantly. He would find amusement in making fools of other students and intern teachers.He heard that there had been a teacher who had reprimanded Zhou Yong before, but was bullied so badly that the teacher ended up resigning.However, despite his bad character, Zhou Yong had a good aptitude. Xu Shaoyuan had taken a liking to him. Xu Shaoyuan was a 2-star great teacher.As it got nearer to the time for the class to start, the students entered in succession. Almost every student who came in were shocked to see so many teachers seated in the back rows. They would either choose to go out or sit down.Zhou Xu counted. There were over 100 of them.Out of which, a large majority of them were freshmen. They had no idea that Sun Mo was An Xinhui\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and only came to have an experience of what classes were like because they were bored.When Jiang Yongnian came in, he was given a big shock. Why were there so many people? After seeing that the teachers took up half of the participants, he burst out laughing.Sun Mo was probably going to have it tough.\u201cWhy are you standing here? Go on in.\u201dA voice suddenly rang out behind Jiang Yongnian, causing him to force back his smile and quickly move to the side. At the same time, he gave his greeting.\u201cGreetings Headmaster Zhang!\u201dJiang Yongnian was a smart person and took away the \u2018vice\u2019 from the address.\u201cEn!\u201dZhang Hanfu entered the lecture theater and the teachers immediately greeted him. Over ten of them even got up to offer their seats.Zhou Shanyi shook his head. He had heard of how Sun Mo went up against Zhou Shanyi at the meeting for intern teachers, and had agreed to a duel with Feng Zewen.The reason Zhang Hanfu came today was definitely not to observe Sun Mo\u2019s teaching capabilities.\u2026\u201cThere\u2019re so many people. Will things be alright?\u201dLu Zhiruo hid behind the door, exposing only half of an eye. She sneaked a look into the lecture theater and then quickly shrank back.\u201cCough cough. Seems like our teacher isn\u2019t in a good situation!\u201dTantai Yutang covered his mouth with a handkerchief, speaking in an amused tone.Xuanyuan Po was wiping his silver spear while his gaze landed on Jiang Leng. Amongst the four of them, he felt that this younger martial brother who had a tattoo on his face was the greatest threat to him.Jiang Leng was expressionless. He sat on the floor and was reading a [Spirit Rune Encyclopedia].Li Ziqi pinched her forehead, feeling a little helpless. What were all these people that Teacher had taken in?There was Lu Zhiruo, who was cowardly and hadn\u2019t successfully reached the body-refinement realm. There was Tantai Yutang, who looked so sickly that it seemed as if he was on the verge of death. There was Jiang Leng, whose body was covered in battered spirit runes and clearly didn\u2019t have a good growth potential. There was Xuanyuan Po, whose brain seemed to be filled with muscles, only thinking about fighting every day\u2026Teacher\u2019s teaching path was really long and arduous!\u201cTeacher Sun is here!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLu Zhiruo reminded.The five of them immediately stood in a row according to the order Sun Mo had taken them in as his disciple.Before the class, students had to stand in a row and greet the teacher. This was a rule that applied to every school.Of course, if the teacher didn\u2019t ask for it, it could be exempted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At this moment, as many as two hundred people were seated, and he couldn\u2019t help but flash an arrogant smile from the corner of his mouth.\u201cZhang Hanfu, can you see this? This is the power of a famous school graduate to rally supporters, what rights does Sun Mo have to compete with me?\u201dGao Ben felt some disdain in his heart.He was actually used as a tool to beat Sun Mo down, making him feel that his talent was wasted on an insignificant person. His opponent should have been Liu Mubai.Gu Xiuxun?Zhang Lan?Sorry, Gao Ben didn\u2019t regard them in his eyes.\u201cI reckon that not even halfway through the public lecture, those students in Sun Mo\u2019s class will be running over to watch me teach, right?\u201dGao Ben cleared his throat and was preparing to commence his first lesson after the bell rang.This was going to be his starting point of becoming well-known in the world.\u2026\u201cGreetings, Teacher!\u201dUnder the lead of Li Ziqi, 5 students bowed and greeted in unison, spreading their voices within the classroom.Some intern teachers, who saw this scene through the windows, couldn\u2019t help but feel envious. When would they start to have such treatment too?Sun Mo smiled and looked at the students one by one.Even if it was the sickly Tantai Yutang or the tattoo-faced Jiang Leng, Sun Mo still felt happy while looking at them because they were his own students.Sun Mo\u2019s character was as such, once a student was allocated to his class, he would teach them with his heart and soul. For this reason, Sun Mo never had the time to find a girlfriend.As No. 2 High School was a good senior high school, Sun Mo\u2019s occupation was considered pretty good. Therefore, many people had introduced some women to him, but they were all rejected because Sun Mo really had no time to meet them.Ding!\u201cCongratulations on recruiting 5 students at the student recruitment meet and completing the mission. Now, according to the students\u2019 aptitudes, you have won yourself a black-iron treasure chest. Please keep up the good work.\u201dThe system\u2019s voice sounded, and at the same time, a big black iron treasure chest fell in front of Sun Mo\u2019s eyes.\u201cHow can this be? I thought I could at least get a silver treasure chest!\u201dSun Mo was in shock. Was something wrong with this evaluation system?\u201cWhat kind of dream are you having? All your 5 students have a huge shortcoming each.\u201d\u201cLi Ziqi, Xuanyuan Po, and Tantai Yutang all have extremely high potential values, but Li Ziqi\u2019s athletic abilities are extremely bad. On the road of cultivation, she practically doesn\u2019t have any prospects. It would be lucky if she could step into the blood-ignition realm in her lifetime.\u201d\u201cIn the Nine Provinces where martial artists were honored the most, Li Ziqi can be considered a useless person. Even if she has rather good innate skills in other areas, she is unable to reach the Longevity Realm and will only live up to a hundred years at most, what use is there?\u201d\u201cThen why did you announce a mission for me to take her in as a disciple?\u201dSun Mo questioned.\u201cThat\u2019s a test for you!\u201dAfter the system explained, it continued to nag.\u201cXuanyuan Po is very suitable for combat, but his brain is filled with muscles. If he doesn\u2019t change this shortcoming, he will definitely die fast.\u201d\u201cTantai Yutang will have an early death as well.\u201dSystem spoke a huge pile of \u2018blah-blah\u2019, but as for useless people like Lu Zhiruo and Jiang Leng, their potential values were so low that it was disinclined to even give them a mention.\u201cI think they are all pretty good though?\u201dSun Mo questioned.\u201cYou\u2019re holding onto the Absolute Great Teacher System, yet you\u2019ve recruited 5 students of such standards, don\u2019t you feel ashamed?\u201dThe system rebutted violently.Since Sun Mo hadn\u2019t recruited at least 3 high-level talents, it was definitely a form of humiliation to the Absolute Great Teacher System.\u201cAlright! Alright! Aren\u2019t you annoying, quickly take your leave!\u201dSun Mo talked back to the system without a good mood. He walked over to the papaya girl and touched her head. \u201cLet\u2019s go in and prepare for the lesson!\u201d\u201cTeacher, you must be careful!\u201dLu Zhiruo looked at Sun Mo worriedly.\u201cTeacher, cheer up!\u201dLi Ziqi waved her little fist.As for the other 3, their attitudes were as though they were facing a passerby.Sun Mo had gotten used to this. After all, it was too impractical for students to start worshipping a teacher they were not familiar with.However, Sun Mo wasn\u2019t discouraged. He believed that they would approve of his teaching abilities one day or even worship him.\u201cOpen the treasure chest!\u201dThe treasure chest opened up after hearing the voice. After the brilliance flashed through, a giant medicine packet was left behind.\u201cA pity it isn\u2019t an ancient whale oil!\u201dSun Mo pouted.Dong! Dong! Dong!The melodious sound of the bell rang. It was 9 a.m.Sun Mo didn\u2019t go in immediately but waited outside the door. He closed his eyes and counted silently to thirty before he entered.Swoosh!When Sun Mo stepped into the classroom, all gazes suddenly became focused.There was neither a slight transition nor a pause in Sun Mo\u2019s footsteps. He maintained a calm appearance and stood on the rostrum.\u201cGood morning, students and teachers. I\u2019m Sun Mo. This is my first public lecture and I\u2019ll be elaborating on my teaching philosophy.\u201dSun Mo started to speak. His clear and candid voice sounded across the entire classroom.Jin Mujie, who was seated in the last row, scanned Sun Mo from head to toe with her beautiful eyes and praised him in her heart.Sun Mo\u2019s bearing was extremely flawless. It was unbelievable that he wasn\u2019t a little bit nervous at all.His ability to resist stress was extremely formidable.\u201cOur teacher\u2019s image and temperament are so good!\u201dLi Ziqi smiled.The azure robe on Sun Mo\u2019s body fitted him just right and gave him an even more sunny and fresh appearance. It felt as though he was in the warm breeze of a summer day.\u201cCheer up, teacher!\u201dQi Shengjia was encouraging Sun Mo. However, just as he finished calling out those words in his heart, a sharp voice interrupted Sun Mo\u2019s speech.\u201cTeacher Sun, you\u2019re late!\u201dSwoosh!Everyone\u2019s gaze looked toward the left side of the classroom.Zhou Yong was smiling and enjoying the attention on him and then added on again, \u201cTeacher, you\u2019re late!\u201d\u201cOh no! Oh no! This Zhou Yong was indeed creating trouble!\u201dQi Shengjia got anxious.A few intern teachers had expressions of rejoicing, especially Zhang Sheng who was hiding in the back row. He wished to jump and clap for Zhou Yong.Sun Mo turned his head slightly and looked over.Zhou Yong, a sixteen-year-old spirit-refinement cultivator. He has opened up 6 acupoints.Strength: 11, sufficient usage will do, there\u2019s no need for a bicycle!Intellect: 13, cunning and full of wisdom, but these aspects are not used on the right path and used to harm people instead.Agility: 13, even though speed is his forte, it is too lousy.Will: 10, horrible!Endurance: 8, young people who don\u2019t know moderation, excessively indulging in debauchery.\u2026Potential value: average!Remark: he is arrogant and prideful. He looks down on others and enjoys teasing people for fun. He is a little scumbag.Seeing the system\u2019s evaluation, Sun Mo could comprehend Zhou Yong\u2019s mentality now.In a school, there would always be a few bad students. For a student like Zhou Yong, he was just trying to seek a form of psychological thrill from bullying others.Swoosh!Everyone\u2019s gaze landed back on Sun Mo. They were waiting for his answer.\u201cThis is a talent\u2019s right!\u201dSun Mo spoke.Swoosh!This reply was like a hurricane in the tropics, blowing away the entire classroom and causing a widespread commotion instantly. Everyone was indescribably surprised and stunned.\u201cIs Sun Mo crazy?\u201dLudi was stunned. This sentence shouldn\u2019t have been said. As expected, he could hear some students start to mutter.\u201cHow arrogant is this teacher!?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so full of himself!\u201d\u201cHis reaction to contingencies is extremely terrible!\u201dThe classroom wasn\u2019t silent anymore.\u201cHmm?\u201dJin Mujie was very curious about Sun Mo\u2019s next reply.Feng Zewen let out a laugh. Was there even a need for him to put Sun Mo into trouble? Sun Mo had already exposed himself.\u201cThis fella is doing it on purpose!\u201d Qi Shengjia stared at Zhou Yong furiously.In Central Province Academy, some teachers preferred to arrive a few minutes before classes started, while some preferred to arrive right at the dot. Others preferred to wait for the bell to finish ringing and would continue standing at the door for another 1 to 2 minutes. They would only enter the classroom after the students were seated and had quietened down.Sun Mo was only late for ten seconds. It wasn\u2019t even considered late at all.This Zhou Yong was definitely trying to nitpick him.Even though the new students didn\u2019t understand, the teachers had understood the situation. However, they were not going to help Sun Mo because this was his stage.\u201cEldest Miss, you\u2019ve asked me here just to look at this?\u201dZhou Lin sat beside An Xinhui and scoffed lightly. If it wasn\u2019t for Eldest Miss who pulled her here, she would never have wasted her time to come.\u201cBe quiet!\u201dAn Xinhui instructed. She looked at Sun Mo and got increasingly curious. She wanted to know how Sun Mo was going to respond.In school, it wasn\u2019t a big deal if teachers were late for 2 to 3 minutes. However, since Zhou Yong had questioned him, Sun Mo had to explain himself.If he were to apologize during his first public lecture, that would be too detrimental to his value. If this were spread out in the future, his reputation would be severely affected. After all, a teacher who was late could not be a good teacher.Not apologizing? Then Zhou Yong could continue to question Sun Mo as though the latter was reluctant to admit his mistake and had a problem with his moral character. Zhou Yong could even question Sun Mo\u2019s work ethic.If this matter was spread out, students might start to feel that Sun Mo\u2019s work ethic was lacking. Then no one would attend his public lecture anymore.No student would like a teacher who was always late. This was a fact.An Xinhui didn\u2019t expect that Sun Mo\u2019s response would be like this. It was practically displaying his original self.\u201cAre you saying that you\u2019re a talent?\u201dZhou Yong inquired with an innocent expression and suppressed the commotion in the classroom.The teachers all looked at Sun Mo and wanted to see what response he was going to give next. If they were to put themselves in his shoes, this question from Zhou Yong was really very tricky.Li Ziqi could feel her heart wrench suddenly. If Sun Mo were to reply \u2018Yes I am\u2019, then his reputation would definitely suffer.That was because Zhou Yong could even question that if he was a talent, then why didn\u2019t he get into one of the Nine Great famous schools? The questions were so forceful that Sun Mo would vomit blood.If Sun Mo were to reply \u2018No I\u2019m not,\u2019 then it would go against his previous answer. Zhou Yong could also reply that since Sun Mo wasn\u2019t a talent, then what right did he have for being late?Just as Li Ziqi was racking her brain, thinking of how to resolve this for Sun Mo, she felt someone pulling her clothes. She turned her head and saw Lu Zhiruo\u2019s expression filled with worry.\u201cI\u2019m twenty years old now and I\u2019m a teacher in Central Province Academy!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s expression was different from what everyone else expected; there wasn\u2019t the slightest amount of anxiousness. He was so calm and collected as though he was sitting under the dusk on a summer day while enjoying a plate of delicious charcoal-grilled Pacific saury.\u201cHaha, that makes you a talent? When I\u2019m twenty years old, I\u2019d probably be a teacher from Jixia Learning Palace or Heavenly Mystery Academy. My accomplishments will definitely be higher than yours!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhou Yong mocked him. Even though he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it, no one would dare to question him. After all, that was a matter of the future and who could prove it?\u201cIs that so?\u201dSun Mo laughed. \u201cWhen I was your age, I had broken through the spirit-refinement realm, opened up 26 acupoints, and was already proficient in the Overflow Rain Sword. I had also gained the \u2018self-taught\u2019 halo and displayed my potential as a teacher. What about you?\u201dZhou Yong was speechless suddenly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - This Is My StagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77: This Is My StageLordbluefireThere was complete silence in the entire classroom and you could even hear the noise of summer cicadas crawling on the wutong trees outside the windows.Sun Mo stood on the rostrum and looked straight at Zhou Yong, giving him an expression that indicated for him to \u2018continue questioning him\u2019.Zhou Yong felt so awkward that he wanted to die. how could he continue questioning Sun Mo?That was because when they were both 16 years old, instead of other achievements, one should just look at the realms that they had attained. When you compared Zhou Yong with Sun Mo, Zhou Yong\u2019s achievement wasn\u2019t worth mentioning at all.\u201cHow awesome!\u201dJin Mujie wanted to applaud as Sun Mo\u2019s counterattack was sharp and overbearing, it was filled with a sense of crushing aura.As Jin Mujie was seated at the back, she couldn\u2019t see Zhou Yong\u2019s expressions. However, she could have guessed that this fella must\u2019ve felt as uncomfortable as though he was constipated.\u201cBut how did Sun Mo know that Zhou Yong was inferior to him? What if Zhou Yong\u2019s background was better than him? His counterattack would have been useless and people can use it to start attacking him instead.\u201dJin Mujie thought about it for a while and concluded that Zhou Yong was a student who liked to stir trouble and was definitely not a fan of cultivation. Hence, his achievements were terrible.However, this wasn\u2019t the fact. Sun Mo had used his Divine Sight and already had a panoramic view of Zhou Yong\u2019s data.A gang of scoundrels who were beside Zhou Yong had been smiling mischievously. They had already been prepared to watch Sun Mo make a fool of himself.Zhou Yong was the beloved son of a tycoon in Jinling and was used to being pampered from a young age Hence, he grew up to become a faultfinder and loved making people embarrassed.Even though he was a scoundrel, Zhou Yong had a great mind. The tricks that he used usually gave the teachers a hard time, so much so that they had unspeakable bitterness.Today was Sun Mo\u2019s first public lecture, and Zhou Yong had prepared to ruin his debut and gave him an unforgettable memory. However, he was met with defeat now.The gang of scoundrels couldn\u2019t laugh anymore.\u201cSit down!\u201dSun Mo instructed.\u201cHumph!\u201dZhou Yong sat down and crossed both his arms firmly in front of his chest, his right foot couldn\u2019t stop tapping on the floor. He was in such a bad mood as he had always been the one making fun of others. When was he at such a disadvantage before?This was actually the first time!Besides, Teacher Xu Shaoyuan had hinted for him to embarrass Sun Mo to no end. If this matter wasn\u2019t settled well, he would be implicated as well. No, this wouldn\u2019t do, he must continue to think of another strategy.\u201cTeacher Sun is so awesome!\u201dQi Shengjia was extremely excited, Teacher Sun had actually defeated that big faultfinder.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +15.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia: Friendly (428/1,000).\u201cTeacher has won!\u201dLu Zhiruo held onto Li Ziqi\u2019s clothing and her excitement made her cheeks flush in red.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +10.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Friendly (253/1,000).\u201cUnperturbed!\u201dLi Ziqi smiled slightly and had totally forgotten how she had been so anxious just now, racking her brain to help Sun Mo mediate the situation.The two notification sounds made Sun Mo a little speechless. (This honest lad and papaya girl must be too high yielding, huh? I have merely berated a punk. Why did they admire it so much?)Moreover, they gave quite a lot of favorable impression points. As expected, the more unsophisticated a person was, the easier they were at trusting people.Just when everyone thought it was time to return to the normal lesson, a teacher who was 30 years old or so started to provoke Sun Mo again.\u201cWhen I was your age, I had broken through the spirit-refinement realm and opened up 31 acupoints!\u201dSwoosh!Everyone\u2019s gaze looked over.Fang Chen looked at Sun Mo with arrogance. (What right did you have to be the fiance of Headmaster An Xinhui? I would be tearing down both your inner substance and reputation and trample on them ruthlessly.)Sun Mo still wasn\u2019t anxious nor impatient and activated the Divine Sight.Fang Chen, 35 years old, blood-ignition realm, very experienced teacher but has not obtained the star-level.Strength: 23, mediocre.\u2026Potential value: average.Remark: he is in self-denial. After he reached 25 years old, there was no more progress in his cultivation. He might not have any more accomplishments in the future.Sun Mo glanced at him and quickly retrieved the necessary data.\u201cOh yes, I was also cultivating the Overflow Rain Sword at that time, but my teacher mentioned that it wasn\u2019t worthy to be cultivated by me anymore. Hence, he found another earth-tier peerless-grade cultivation art for me.\u201dFang Chen tilted the corner of his mouth upward. The feeling of superiority within his tone was enough to drown a person.Sun Mo laughed. \u201cReally? Then how about when you were 20 years old?\u201d\u201cHaha, I was headhunted personally by Headmaster Zhang Hanfu.\u201dFang Chen\u2019s face was filled with complacency.\u201cThen have you been officially employed at that time?\u201dSun Mo continued to inquire.\u201cEr!\u201dThis time, Fang Chen\u2019s smile became frozen.Of course, he hadn\u2019t. All intern teachers had to go through one year of internship. Even though Fang Chen\u2019s aptitude was pretty good, he hadn\u2019t been so outstanding to the extent where the school had to make an exception for him.\u201cLooking at that appearance of yours, it means you hadn\u2019t?\u201dSun Mo laughed gently. \u201cWell, I\u2019m now an officially employed teacher in this academy. Do you want me to show you the employment letter?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dFang Chen was so angry that his chest was moving up and down. Luckily, he was still considered quick-witted and quickly found new phrases to continue arguing. \u201cYou guys are just lucky. If our batch of intern teachers could also recruit students, I would have passed the evaluation and gotten hold of the employment letter as well.\u201d\u201cLucky?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s tone became stricter.\u201cOur batch has a total of 200 intern teachers and only 4 people passed the evaluation in the end.\u201cTo win in a competition of over 200 people, is this an insignificant achievement? Then please open your eyes and look at Zhang Lan and Gao Ben who are in the same batch as me. They are both graduates of the Nine Great famous schools, while Gu Xiuxun is an honor graduate of Myriad Daos Academy. According to your theory, if I\u2019m mediocre, then aren\u2019t they the same? As for those 200 losers, won\u2019t they only fit to be called useless by your standard, huh?\u201cAlso, you may be questioning my ability. Let me tell you, in the competition of student recruitment meet, I\u2019ve also defeated Qin Fen.\u201cWho is Qin Fen? A graduate of Jixia Learning Palace! Headmaster An headhunted him over herself, do you think he\u2019s a useless person?\u201dSun Mo questioned this poor guy like a barrage of gunfire.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant!\u201dFang Chen tried to clarify but didn\u2019t know which aspect he should begin with. His mind was in confusion, and he couldn\u2019t find any reason to rebuke Sun Mo for the time being.\u201cThen what did you mean?\u201dSun Mo talked back at once, \u201cCould we have entered by giving presents through the back door? Could we have received the official employment letter by pulling relations and selling our butts?\u201dHearing Sun Mo\u2019s amusing words, many students and teachers started laughing. However, they only realized after laughing that in order for Sun Mo to become an official teacher, he indeed had certain capabilities.\u201cWhat terrible eloquence!\u201dAn Xinhui shook her head. It was no wonder that Fang Chen still didn\u2019t have many achievements despite his age. As a teacher, he didn\u2019t even have a strong eloquence. How could he even do a decent lecture?\u201cUseless!\u201dLooking at Fang Chen, Zhang Hanfu couldn\u2019t stop cursing and scolding in his heart. However, Sun Mo could talk really well with the gift of the gab.\u201cAlright, you can sit down now!\u201dThe color on Fang Chen\u2019s face disappeared as he sat his butt down on the stool.To speak the truth, he had just thrown such a big face away. Hearing the comments of the students around, which seemed to be sneering at him, he wanted to take his leave so badly.However, he couldn\u2019t. He must stay behind and look for an opportunity to strike back; otherwise, he was going to become a stepping stone for Sun Mo\u2019s career.The students were all whispering.The intern teachers, who were present, had expressions of embarrassment on their faces because they were all losers in this competition.Piak! Piak! Piak!Suddenly, there were sounds of applause.Fang Chen was indignant. (Are they trying to slap my face?) But when he turned his head and was prepared to glare at the one applauding, his expression became stiff.Because the one applauding was Jin Mujie, a three-stars great teacher. The moon-white long robe on her represented her position in the school and the great teachers world.When the teachers saw this scene, they were distracted for a moment before the sparse sounds of applause started echoing as well.Among the teachers who were here to watch Sun Mo\u2019s first public lecture, some belonged to the neutral clan and had only come here out of boredom. All they wanted was to see for themselves who An Xinhui\u2019s fiance was.This moment, their applause could be considered as acknowledgment of Sun Mo\u2019s performance.His quick-witted adaptability and nimble eloquence couldn\u2019t be feigned. Just by looking at those students\u2019 reactions, you would know that Sun Mo\u2019s opening was on the winning hand.(How formidable, huh?)Jiang Yongnian pouted and thought about it carefully. Everyone was saying that Sun Mo was living off a woman and that he was a graduate from Songyang Academy, so he wasn\u2019t worthy of being with An Xinhui.Who was An Xinhui?She was an honor graduate of Heavenly Mystery Academy, one of the Nine Great Aristocratic schools, and she had the reputation of a talent that you would only meet once in a hundred years. Moreover, she was a great beauty that was ranked 7th on the Devastating Beauty Rankings.If you were to seek such a talent in the various countries of Nine Provinces, you wouldn\u2019t even find more than three of them.This seemed like the situation of how a national female celebrity had gotten together with an ordinary person, how could everyone accept it?In everyone\u2019s eyes, the fiance of a national female celebrity should have been the son of a rich and powerful family. If not, he should at least be a national male celebrity to be an appropriate match for her in terms of social statuses.And what kind of person was Sun Mo?When everyone saw Sun Mo, they would naturally start to see him in another light. They would nitpick and find all sorts of fault with him. As long as Sun Mo had any single inadequacy, it would be magnified endlessly.In fact, Sun Mo was indeed not fit to be a match for An Xinhui. However, when you put him in comparison with other ordinary people, then he was considered pretty good. If he was really a useless person, he wouldn\u2019t even have entered Songyang Academy.\u201cWhat a formidable specious argument!\u201dGu Xiuxun pouted and somewhat admired Sun Mo\u2019s quick-witted adaptability. It could be said that Sun Mo had borrowed her reputation to raise his social value.\u201cEntirely useless!\u201dZhang Sheng looked at Fang Chen and was fuming with anger. (Did he spend the last few years of experience as a dog? How could he have lost to Sun Mo in this verbal battle!?)Sun Mo nodded toward Jin Mujie as a form of gratitude. His action was so minuscule that nobody had realized it. Following this, he immediately started to speak. \u201cThis brief interlude has ended, let\u2019s continue the self-introduction!\u201dSun Mo was really afraid that other great teachers would stand up to attack him verbally again. Xu Shaoyuan and Feng Zewen, who had had disputes with him previously, were both present as well.When compared to Fang Chen, these two persons were genuine elites.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSpeaking from conscience, his original self\u2019s aptitude was of above-average standard and not considered bad. However, it wasn\u2019t close to a talent\u2019s standard at all. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have only reached enlightenment for \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 halo just before he was about to drown.\u201cWhat use does good eloquence have? A teacher\u2019s best asset is still their teaching ability!\u201dFeng Zewen was frustrated. Even if Sun Mo was able to say his piece with extravagant embellishments, at the end of the day it was down to whether he could coach students or not. Whether the students improved or not was the genuine test of this first public lecture, and the test had only just begun.Li Ziqi observed her surroundings and realized that as compared to before, the students\u2019 interests had been evoked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - You Guys Don\u2019t Understand Teacher Sun\u2019s Excellence!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78: You Guys Don\u2019t Understand Teacher Sun\u2019s Excellence!LordbluefireThe lesson had started. When Gao Ben was doing his self-introduction and mentioned Jixia Learning Palace, which he graduated from, sounds of surprise echoed throughout the entire classroom.Looking at the envious and admiring gazes from those young and tender students, Gao Ben\u2019s expression remained unperturbed, but he could feel his ego swell.(Zhang Hanfu, have you seen that? This is the influence of a graduate of an Aristocratic School. To think you\u2019re comparing me with Sun Mo, you don\u2019t even understand my value.)Gao Ben had a vile character in his heart who couldn\u2019t stop sneering. His enemies were Liu Mubai and Gu Xiuxun from Myriad Daos Academy.No matter how it was calculated, his rival would never be Sun Mo.The 300 seats lecture theater was now filled with not less than 200 people. This was where Gao Ben got his arrogance and confidence from. Sun Mo had been working hard for 3 years, but the number of people in his public lecture perhaps couldn\u2019t reach this number.\u2026The other lecture theaters\u2019 atmosphere seemed quite harmonious.Some students were not interested in gossip and rumors; hence, they didn\u2019t know that Sun Mo was An Xinhui\u2019s fiance, nor did they know about those negative news.They only came here to listen to the lecture and look at Sun Mo\u2019s standards.During the lecture, Sun Mo had not only dealt with Zhou Yong\u2019s deliberate questioning but also left another teacher speechless with his verbal skill. He had also very naturally displayed his excellence.Putting his teaching ability aside, at least Sun Mo stood firm and steadily on the rostrum. This kind of confidence, calmness, and free-spiritedness was very infectious.After the students had quietened down, an arc appeared on the corner of An Xinhui\u2019s mouth. This was the charm that belonged to Sun Mo!His perfect performance had temporarily won over the students. It made them want to continue listening.\u201cI\u2019m good at 3 disciplines. Firstly, the study of spirit runes. Secondly, medical arts. And thirdly, traditional painting!\u201dRight after Sun Mo spoke, voices of comments were echoing.\u201cWhat is medical arts?\u201d\u201cThis vocabulary is so unfamiliar!\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of it before? Is it a new discipline?\u201dNot only the students, but even the teachers let out a perplexed expression and didn\u2019t know what trick Sun Mo was plotting.\u201cIt seems like everyone is puzzled by medical arts. Let me explain. This is the conclusion of some of my experiences and will be of great assistance toward cultivation.\u201dAfter Sun Mo finished explaining, everyone present went into a commotion.\u201cHe is just making things unnecessarily complicated!\u201dXu Shaoyuan ridiculed him. (A fella who isn\u2019t a great teacher wants to establish a new discipline? Is this a joke? If it was, then a boar could even give birth to a monkey.)\u201cTeacher Sun, this is your first public lecture. You must not mess around!\u201dA teacher from below shouted.\u201cEveryone, please remain patient and listen to my explanation.\u201dSun Mo moved his palms downward and indicated for everyone to keep quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s named medical arts, which means that it\u2019s a discipline that combines medical science and cultivation arts.\u201cEveryone is a cultivator. Do you all think that just by spending great efforts in cultivating, you\u2019ll be able to upgrade your realms?\u201dSun Mo inquired.\u201cYou don\u2019t say. We can\u2019t possibly be cultivating when we\u2019re eating or resting, right?\u201d Zhou Yong started to make fun of Sun Mo again.\u201cYes, during the period of cultivation, what you eat, how much you eat, the time you sleep, even your method of sleeping\u2014all of this will affect your health and your results of cultivation,\u201d Sun Mo explained.The students were astonished once again. On the contrary, those teachers with some experience started to frown and pondered over what Sun Mo had said.\u201cCultivation is not just attainable by meditation. The warm-up prior to cultivating, the maintenance after cultivating, and the intensity of cultivating\u2014all of this must be considered as well.\u201dSun Mo started to elaborate on his philosophy of medical arts.This was actually the spirit qi version of sports medicine. In the original world where Sun Mo had lived in, the study of sports medicine was an emerging discipline.In the past, athletes were all engrossed in training hard. But now, it was about the scientific knowledge of diet, training, as well as rehabilitation.Why did certain athletes rarely injure themselves? Why was the recovery process shorter? And why were certain athletes able to maintain their peak performance for over ten years?Sports were all about scientific knowledge.Those top-notch football clubs such as Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Barcelona\u2014they all had professional doctors, nutritionists, therapists, and fitness coaches. These people made up a training plan to ensure that the top-notch footballers always maintained their best state.\u201cCultivation is a serious matter that runs through a cultivator\u2019s entire lifetime; hence, the cultivator\u2019s state will always be fluctuating. And what medical arts pursue is to always maintain the cultivator\u2019s state at its optimal moment.\u201dSun Mo explained.The students were still dumbfounded, while some of the teachers had already revealed expressions of sudden realization.\u201cSo that\u2019s what it is.\u201dJiang Yongnian nodded. When he was training his students, prior to the start of certain yearly competitions, he would plan the students\u2019 diet and resting time.Many teachers were already doing that, but they were all relying on the inherited experience from the previous teacher. They only found it to be beneficial to the students, but as for the root cause of this strategy, most teachers didn\u2019t try to think about it.Now that Sun Mo had concluded it, they seemed as though they had achieved speedy enlightenment.Jin Mujie was flabbergasted. (This Sun Mo isn\u2019t that simple, huh?)An Xinhui\u2019s beautiful eyes brightened up. Sun Mo had once again given her another surprise.\u201cBe quiet, don\u2019t interrupt Teacher Sun.\u201dZhou Shanyi suddenly shouted with his voice.\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201dJiang Yongnian, who was beside him, jumped with fear. But very quickly, he realized that the classroom\u2019s noise had disappeared and the teachers were all looking at Sun Mo, waiting for him to continue his narration.\u201cTeacher Sun is so awesome!\u201dSeeing how even the teachers had become interested, Lu Zhiruo tugged at Li Ziqi\u2019s clothes excitedly.\u201cThat is indeed our teacher!\u201dLi Ziqi felt honored.Xuanyuan Po was relaxed with his eyes closed. Meanwhile, Jiang Leng was looking pensive, and Tantai Yutang was tossing around his ears and looked at Sun Mo with a ruminating expression.\u201cI shall use simpler words. A cultivator is like a weapon. A weapon needs to be frequently polished and maintained to ensure its sharpness. A human\u2019s body is an even more refined structure, so it naturally requires more maintenance. And medical arts is to teach everyone how to maintain your health and remain at the sharpest state at all times.\u201dIf Sun Mo hadn\u2019t gotten the ancient massage technique, he wouldn\u2019t even have dared to launch this discipline. Because the foundation of this discipline was the ability to achieve a detailed understanding of the human body.\u201cAlright, today is just the first public lecture, so I won\u2019t go into too much professional content. Everyone can come and attend my public lecture on medical arts.\u201dSun Mo kept everyone in suspense at the right timing.Ssss!Suddenly, there were teachers who let out hissing sounds of dissatisfaction. They had already removed their pants and he had already finished his lecture?Sun Mo continued to talk more about the study of spirit runes and traditional painting. Then, he drew a self-portrait on the blackboard with the charcoal pen, showing off his Character Painting Technique.A public lecture\u2019s essence was to let students become interested in the teacher, and it would then allow the teacher to pull in a sufficient supply of students for the courses in the future. Hence, they only needed to display their excellence.Half an hour had passed.Jin Mujie scanned the classroom and saw the students listening eagerly. She couldn\u2019t help but be astonished, Sun Mo\u2019s unconstrained appearance on the rostrum didn\u2019t seem like a newbie teacher who was lecturing for the first time at all.\u201cCould it be that he was of teacher material since birth?\u201dJin Mujie was suspicious and grew more interested in Sun Mo.Ding!Favorable impression points from Jin Mujie +1.Prestige connection with Jin Mujie: Neutral (4/100).\u201cHow is it?\u201dAn Xinhui asked her female assistant.Zhou Lin remained silent. She couldn\u2019t find any fault from Sun Mo\u2019s performance because this fella didn\u2019t seem anything like a newcomer. His lecture techniques seemed extremely experienced.\u201cHe must\u2019ve been practicing in private.\u201dAn Xinhui made a guess.Ding!Favorable impression points from An Xinhui +1.Prestige connection with An Xinhui: Neutral (5/100).Looking at the atmosphere in the whole classroom, Li Ziqi suddenly felt a little proud.\u201cHumph, you guys don\u2019t understand Teacher Sun\u2019s excellence!\u201dDing!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +5.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi: Friendly (131/1,000).Having heard the 3 notification sounds from the system, Sun Mo heaved a sigh of relief. For him to have received favorable impression points from them, it meant that he had given a pretty good lecture.But weren\u2019t these favorable impression points a bit too little?Sure enough, it wasn\u2019t an easy feat to conquer a woman.\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll leave the time for questions now. Anyone with questions, please raise your hand!\u201dSun Mo ended the topic at the right time and moved onto the second segment of the lecture.This was a required process stipulated by the school. He couldn\u2019t avoid it.Sun Mo reckoned that Feng Zewen\u2019s opportunity to raise difficult questions was right at this moment, but he didn\u2019t know what difficult questions he had prepared.Qi Shengjia had long since been waiting for this moment. He was afraid that no one would raise any question. If the classroom were to fall into an awkward silence, it would embarrass Teacher Sun. Hence, he raised his arm immediately.But who could have known that there was someone else quicker than him.Just as Sun Mo\u2019s voice ended, more than half of the students raised their arms. For a moment, the raised arms seemed to form a forest that was about to break through the ceiling of the classroom.\u201cOh my lord!\u201dLudi was so startled he almost bit his tongue. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he knew it was impossible, he would\u2019ve suspected that these students were dummy students hired by Sun Mo.\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal with so many people asking questions? He can only be called outstanding if he manages to answer every question; otherwise, it\u2019ll be even more humiliating.\u201dFeng Zewen was unperturbed. Perhaps there wasn\u2019t even a need for the students he arranged to enter the scene, Sun Mo would\u2019ve exposed himself by not being able to answer the questions.Those experienced teachers weren\u2019t surprised at all. They had already guessed that this situation would happen.Although everyone would only speak the righteous stuff such as education must not be discriminating, in actual fact, the better students were always being favored. Why was it that when everyone was recruiting students, they would voluntarily want those with great aptitudes?They were easy to teach and would attain achievements easily. If you recruited a mediocre student, you were only finding problems for yourself!Of course, there were also teachers who treated good and bad students equally, but the proportion wasn\u2019t big.This kind of prevalence had contributed to the situation where almost more than half of the students in any school were without any master. If they had wanted to acquire knowledge or obtain pointers, they could only attend the teachers\u2019 public lectures.Of course, they could also get their answers if they inquired with the teachers in private. But they wouldn\u2019t be able to successfully stop the teachers for questions every time, right?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe students with their arms raised all had questions in their minds that they weren\u2019t able to get their answers to. Now that they had the chance, they were desperately trying every way to get the answer.Sun Mo activated the Divine Sight and aside from browsing through the great amount of data, he pointed at a student named Wang Gang.\u201cWhat question do you have?\u201dWang Gang stood up and swallowed a mouth of saliva. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m at the sixth level of body-refinement realm but have been stuck for almost half a year, I wonder what\u2019s the reason?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - I Think I Should Learn How to Cook!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79: I Think I Should Learn How to Cook!LordbluefireThe lecture theater fell silent.The students listened seriously. Maybe, Sun Mo\u2019s answer might be of use to them.As for the teachers, they all had judging gazes as they stared at Sun Mo.From the looks of things now, the first half-hour of Sun Mo\u2019s lesson wasn\u2019t bad. However, this was insufficient to tell whether a teacher was outstanding or not. One still had to look at their practical ability to guide students.\u201cLet\u2019s hope he isn\u2019t an idiot that only knows theoretical discussion but is actually useless in practice!\u201dZhou Shanyi sighed.Sun Mo glanced at this skinny youth named Wang Gang. All sorts of data appeared from his body.=====Wang Gang, 15 years old. Sixth level of the Body-Refinement Realm.Strength 9, when stirring with the ladle during cooking, you gain immense strength!Intellect 5, sufficient for usage.Agility 3, rigid.Endurance 9, you have an endless source of energy!Potential value: AverageNote: Love to cook. Rather than being a cultivator, you are more suitable to be a chef.=====Sun Mo glanced over and felt a little speechless. The data was all quite standard and there were no highlights. But what the hell was that note?Sun Mo involuntarily glanced at Wang Gang\u2019s hands. As expected, the joints there were thicker and he was suitable to be a head cook.Wang Gang swallowed a mouthful of saliva, feeling a little uncomfortable from Sun Mo\u2019s stare.Sun Mo got down the rostrum and went to Wang Gang\u2019s side. He stretched out his hand and touched his shoulder. After that, his hand moved downward as he inspected Wang Gang\u2019s muscles.The grandmaster-grade \u2018Muscleforge Technique\u2019 allowed Sun Mo to understand the conditions of Wang Gang\u2019s muscles in a few seconds. However, in order to drag a little time, as well as to increase the value of his guidance in the eyes of the others, he remained in the same position for one minute.One must know when some leaders watched you doing stuff, they didn\u2019t care about the results. The first thing they looked at would be whether you have a serious attitude or not. If Sun Mo stopped after a few seconds, the other teachers would surely feel that he had a perfunctory attitude and was not serious enough.\u201cThe reason why you are stuck at the sixth level of the body-refinement realm for half-a-year is because you have not trained enough!\u201dSun Mo explained.\u201cAh?\u201dWang Gang and his roommate at the side both called out in surprise.The over ten teachers at the back of the lecture theater also frowned upon hearing that. As for the intern teachers, they couldn\u2019t help but begin discussing with each other in low voices.\u201cIs he for real?\u201d\u201cHe simply touched the muscles of the student for roughly about one minute and already knew the reason?\u201d\u201cEven a great teacher wouldn\u2019t dare to be so confident. Yet, this fellow didn\u2019t even inquire about the student\u2019s basic situation and already gave his answer.\u201dNo wonder the other teachers would be filled with suspicions. Sun Mo\u2019s earlier inspection and guidance seemed too negligent.\u201cQi!\u201d (whispering sounds)Feng Zewen was joyful. It seemed that there was no need for him to act.\u201cIncrease your cultivation time and increase the intensity of your training.\u201dSun Mo suggested.\u201cTeacher, he has already spent a great amount of time cultivating.\u201dWang Gang wanted to speak but was hesitating. However, because his dorm mate had a good relationship with him, his dorm mate couldn\u2019t bear it and decided to say something. \u201cIf he continues to lengthen his cultivation time, he might damage his body.\u201d\u201cCultivating seven hours per day might be considered a lot for students of your age. However, seven hours isn\u2019t sufficient for you. Your endurance is much stronger; hence, you need to lengthen the time and intensity of your cultivation.\u201dSun Mo explained.\u201cStronger endurance?\u201dAll the teachers and students here glanced at Wang Gang. Some people wanted to sneer. (This student is so skinny, which eyes of yours did you use to see?)But Wang Gang had a look of shock as though he had seen a ghost. He screamed.\u201cHow did you know?\u201dThe students with slower reactions still had no idea what was going on. As for those with fast reactions, all of them already turned their heads as they looked at Sun Mo. Their expressions were filled with shock.\u201cYou followed Wang Gang?\u201dHis dorm mate felt that he had discovered the crux.\u201cAm I so bored as to do something so \u2018pain-in-the-ass\u2019 like that?\u201dSun Mo was speechless. If it wasn\u2019t for the current location, he really wanted to call the other guy a pig brain.\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026you just inspected his muscles for such a short while, yet you already know the level of intensity of his training?\u201dThe dorm mate finally thought of the answer, but the answer was too incredible.That \u2018pain-in-the-ass\u2019 by Sun Mo was quite funny, but no one was laughing. All of them were shocked.\u201cI\u2019ll write a training plan for you, so just follow it. At most, it will take a month and you will be able to break through. At that time, if you still fail, come and look for me!\u201dSun Mo returned to the rostrum as he lifted a pen and began writing on a paper.The students seated on the front row immediately stood up as they craned their necks, staring at the rostrum.The teachers all fell into silence.\u201cSun Mo is so confident in himself!\u201dJiang Yongnian\u2019s lips twitched. If it were him, he absolutely wouldn\u2019t say such confident words. If that student failed to break through at the time, it would be highly damaging to his reputation.\u201cIt\u2019s good for the young to have confidence!\u201dZhou Shanyi actually admired Sun Mo\u2019s courage.\u201cI know that this is Sun Mo\u2019s first public lecture. He wishes to shoot to fame with a single shot, so this is why he brags so much now. But what if that student failed to break through to the seventh level of the body-refinement realm after following his plan a month later?\u201dZhou Lin questioned.Just when An Xinhui wanted to rebut, Jin Mujie who was seated a few seats away already spoke, \u201cHow do you know that the student cannot make it?\u201d\u201cDo you still need to ask? Sun Mo simply touched his muscles for a while and could already come out with a training plan? His frivolous attitude is clearly problematic.\u201dAfter Zhou Lin spoke, the nearby teachers involuntarily nodded. They felt that such a thing was pretty impossible to accomplish.Some teachers here were still squeezing their brain juice to think of a reason. There were some with overactive imaginations who thought of a possibility.Maybe Wang Gang was someone hired by Sun Mo to put up an act.Naturally, they also didn\u2019t dare to agree with Zhou Lin. After all, they were facing Jin Mujie, a 3-star great teacher. No one was willing to antagonize her.\u201cLittle Lin, don\u2019t look at others through colored glasses. Also, you must not judge others based on what you know alone. Maybe, you simply have no idea how outstanding Sun Mo is!\u201dJin Mujie spoke.If Zhou Lin wasn\u2019t An Xinhui\u2019s female assistant, Jin Mujie couldn\u2019t even be bothered to say all these.\u201cI know!\u201dZhou Lin didn\u2019t dare to talk back, but she felt very unconvinced in her heart. She prepared to look for Wang Gang a month later and use reality to smack Sun Mo\u2019s face so as to prove that she wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201cHired actor?\u201dZhang Sheng thought of the past incidents as he involuntarily let out a sneer. (Just you wait, Sun Mo. You won\u2019t be able to be complacent for a long time. A month later, your reputation shall be thoroughly discredited.)Feng Zewen shook his head. Fighting with such a person would only damage his own status.From Feng Zewen\u2019s point of view, were there teachers who could tell the intensity of a student\u2019s training just by inspecting their muscles for a short while? There were, but these teachers were extremely few, and all of them were great teachers with tens of years of experience and had seen at least thousands of students.What basis did Sun Mo have?He was so young. The number of students Sun Mo had seen most probably hadn\u2019t even exceeded one-tenth of what he had seen.\u201cTake it, cultivate according to this plan!\u201dSun Mo passed the paper to Wang Gang.Usually, everyone could judge whether a person was strong and fit based on their physical state. But in truth, they had to conduct scientific testing and inspection before they could know for sure.It was like those soccer players who could run constantly through the duration of an entire game. They needed high-intensity training in order to maintain their form.Sun Mo\u2019s ancient massage technique allowed him to understand the details of people\u2019s bodies thoroughly. With the support of his Divine Sight, he could guarantee that his plan would work.Wang Gang\u2019s aptitude was very good. In addition to hard-work, he only lacked a sufficient quantity of training. Once the quantity was met, it would trigger a qualitative transformation.The dorm mate by his side was now craning his neck for a look.\u201cThank you, teacher!\u201dThe others were suspecting Sun Mo of hiring an actor, but Wang Gang himself knew that this was not the case. He was truly emotional. He felt that Sun Mo was really awesome.Honestly speaking, although Wang Gang had cultivated for seven hours per day, he didn\u2019t feel tired at all. When he wanted to increase the amount of time spent in cultivation, he would recall the fixed number of hours given to him by a teacher he had asked in the past. Also, all the other students would at most cultivate for six hours per day. By cultivating more than seven hours, he was afraid he might damage his muscles and needed to be bed-ridden. Hence, he didn\u2019t dare to increase the quantity of training rashly.Wang Gang lowered his head. According to the plan on the paper, he was supposed to cultivate eight hours per day. He couldn\u2019t help but tremble because he once thought of lengthening his cultivation time to eight hours per day as well.\u201cSeems like Teacher Sun does have some capabilities!\u201dWang Gang mumbled.Ding!Favorable impression from Wang Gang +10.Prestige connection with Wang Gang unlocked: Neutral (10/100).\u201cActually, rather than being a cultivator, I feel you should be a chef instead. If there\u2019s a chance to, please let me have a taste of the dishes you cook personally!\u201dSun Mo patted Wang Gang on the shoulder, indicating that he could sit down. He then asked, \u201cIs there anyone else who has a question? Raise your hand!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dAfter Wang Gang sat down, he had a look of astonishment on his face. He stared at Sun Mo, how did Sun Mo know that he loved to cook?Wang Gang was from a family of cooks. He worshiped his father crazily and wished to inherit his father\u2019s legacy. However, his father hoped that he would cultivate and stand out among his peers.Wang Gang had never mentioned this matter to anyone before!Upon thinking of this, Wang Gang couldn\u2019t help but shiver. \u201cTeacher Sun\u2019s hands could even probe what my ambitions are just by inspecting my muscles?\u201dHence, Wang Gang felt even more impressed with Sun Mo.Ding!Favorable impression from Wang Gang +20.Prestige connection with Wang Gang: Neutral (30/100).The thoughts of many students were still very pure. They didn\u2019t think of the possibility that Wang Gang was a hired actor. When they saw how much gratitude he had toward Sun Mo, all of them began to raise their hands.\u201cThis student, what problems do you have?\u201dSun Mo pointed to a male student.\u201cMy name is Zhang Zhong, I\u2026I\u2019ve been stuck at the sixth level of the body-refinement realm for three months. Is it because my quantity of training isn\u2019t enough?\u201dZhang Zhong sniffed.\u201cI have to do an inspection before I know!\u201dSun Mo walked to Zhang Zhong\u2019s side and began to touch his muscles.\u201cYou are still using this?\u201dSeveral of the teachers were speechless.\u201cHeadmaster An, if Sun Mo still gives the same method of guidance as before, I will send someone to investigate him.\u201dZhang Hanfu suddenly spoke. His tone was extremely strict.Some of the surrounding teachers shrank their necks, and some rejoiced in Sun Mo\u2019s incoming calamity. Vice-headmaster Zhang was clearly suspicious that Sun Mo might be hiring students as actors.If this was true, Sun Mo would be finished. He would be suppressed by the Saint Gate and wouldn\u2019t be able to become a teacher forever.\u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201dAn Xinhui questioned.\u201cWhat do you think? How can he tell the student\u2019s condition by inspecting their muscles for a short while? Do you think he is a great teacher?\u201dZhang Hanfu bluntly spoke, wanting to deal a blow to An Xinhui\u2019s prestige in the public. He wanted everyone to know that the person she had chosen was trash.\u201cA straight foot is not afraid of a crooked shoe, I trust Sun Mo!\u201dAn Xinhui fully supported Sun Mo.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYour trust is worth nothing. What matters is everyone\u2019s trust. You must know that Sun Mo is now a teacher at our school. If he did something so scandalous, our Central Province Academy\u2019s reputation would be damaged!\u201dZhang Hanfu was overbearing to the extreme.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to fight about? Wouldn\u2019t we know the answer if we simply continue watching?\u201dJin Mujie interjected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - Harvesting Favorable Impression PointsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80: Harvesting Favorable Impression PointsLordbluefireAs a 3-star great teacher, Jin Mujie\u2019s words were still relatively weighty.Zhang Hanfu snorted while temporarily suppressing his temper. (Later on when Sun Mo screws up, just watch what I\u2019ll say to you all!)\u201cRelax!\u201dSun Mo exerted force as he pressed Zhang Zhong\u2019s biceps. The muscles of this brat were so stiff that he was like a frozen dead catfish. Evidently, he was way too nervous.There were no solutions to it. With so many teachers watching, how could Zhang Zhong not be nervous? He felt that this might very well be the highest peak of his life.Sun Mo activated Divine Sight and surveyed him.=====15 years old, sixth level of the body-refinement realm.Strength 7, strength has never been your strong point.Intellect 6, you are intelligent in small ways, but you love to think of yourself as clever when you are actually not.Agility 9, this is your capital. However, your tendons are recently injured, and you have no way to unleash your full potential.Endurance 6, trash.Potential value: Average.Note: A mediocre person, don\u2019t waste any time on him.=====Sun Mo rapidly read the data. After that, he used the ancient massage technique to do a check before discovering the reason.\u201cDid your body start to hurt three months ago?\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t move his hands away.\u201cCorrect!\u201dUpon hearing this, Zhang Zhong\u2019s expression that was originally one of heaviness and trepidation turned to one of joy instead.Teacher Sun was truly awesome. He actually knew his situation by just touching his muscles. It seemed like his problem had the possibility of being resolved.\u201cChange to another type of mediation method. Right now, the one you are using will cause you to absorb a large amount of spirit qi when you are meditating. Your energy channels are unable to withstand the load; hence, they are now damaged!\u201dSun Mo explained.\u201cAh?\u201dZhang Zhong was shocked. So, this was the reason? He recalled his past experiences and after that, he revealed a look of sudden realization.\u201cFour months ago, I obtained a peerless-grade earth-tier meditation art; hence, I started to use it. However, three months ago, I started to feel pain in my body, especially at my chest area and dantian. Those areas felt like they were being pricked by needles.\u201dZhang Zhong revealed his situation to allow Sun Mo to have a more detailed and accurate judgment.After all, this matter concerned his body. Zhang Zhong didn\u2019t dare to conceal anything.Upon hearing Zhang Zhong\u2019s words, the students were all completely stunned. Their gazes grew more passionate when they stared at Sun Mo. He was actually able to see this? How awesome.As for the teachers, they were bewildered. Was Sun Mo swindling them or did he have true capabilities?\u201cChange back to your previous method. It\u2019s quite good.\u201dSun Mo persuaded.\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026\u201dZhang Zhong scratched his hair while feeling reluctance in his heart. \u201cThat\u2019s a peak-grade earth-tier meditation art, and it has immense power. Could it be that there\u2019s no solution for me to use it?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t wish to be crippled, wait until you reach the spirit-refinement realm before you change to it!\u201dSun Mo seriously replied. For matters such as cultivation, one had to be overcautious. If there was a mistake, a life might be destroyed.The students and teachers at the scene could all understand Zhang Zhong\u2019s conflicted feelings. The better a cultivation art, the faster it would allow one\u2019s strength to grow. Naturally, it would also be able to raise their cultivation.However, the prerequisite was that one\u2019s body must be able to endure it.\u201cWould I be able to break through if I changed back to the meditation art I was using before?\u201dZhang Zhong solemnly asked.\u201cNope. Your energy channels are already damaged. You need to rest. For one entire month, don\u2019t even think about meditating.\u201dSun Mo repeatedly warned.\u201cSo long?\u201dZhang Zhong\u2019s expression grew dispirited. Cultivation was like a boat going against the currents. The influence of not cultivating for an entire month was simply too great. \u201cTeacher Sun, are there other methods to resolve this?\u201d\u201cMy Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands can resolve this, but are you willing to try?\u201dSun Mo asked. Actually, he could resolve it. But before obtaining the approval of the student, he wouldn\u2019t use his Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands without careful consideration.The moment the name \u2018Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands\u2019 rang out, everyone immediately began to whisper to each other.\u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s very capable!\u201dJiang Yongnian ridiculed.\u201cThe Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands is finally going to appear?\u201dQi Shengjia almost jumped up in agitation. As someone who had enjoyed the benefits of the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands before, he knew how powerful this technique was. Hence, his gaze was filled with envy when he looked at Zhang Zhong.\u201cI\u2019m willing!\u201dZhang Zhong decisively replied. He felt that on such an important occasion today, Sun Mo would definitely not dare to joke around with his future. Hence, since Sun Mo said he could resolve it, Sun Mo most probably had 90% confidence.From this point, one could see that the system\u2019s evaluation of Zhang Zhong\u2019s intellect wasn\u2019t randomly given with no basis. Zhang Zhong was pretty intelligent in small ways.Sun Mo placed his right hand on Zhang Zhong\u2019s shoulder. He then exerted force as he squeezed.\u201cArgh!\u201dZhang Zhong instantly screamed. The pain was so bad that he was perspiring cold sweat.The entire lecture theater once again fell silent. Everyone was staring at each of Sun Mo\u2019s actions.Even the cicadas on the chinese parasol tree outside the window were frightened away by Zhang Zhong\u2019s screams.\u201cTeacher, it\u2019s painful, so painful!\u201dZhang Zhong screamed. He was shaking profusely as he curled up involuntarily. The pain was so bad that it felt like someone was plucking his tendons out from his body.\u201cEndure it!\u201dSun Mo roared. His hands swiftly roamed around Zhang Zhong\u2019s body as he continued pressing.Ai!He surely looked very stupid now, right? Although his level was higher compared to a little sister working at a foot massage shop, it was truly embarrassing.He also didn\u2019t know whether a genie like the one in Aladdin would pop and help to massage his target like before.However, no one felt that Sun Mo looked stupid. This was especially so for some teachers who were also proficient in massaging. When they saw the novel massage technique used by Sun Mo, something that didn\u2019t belong to the three main factions and six branches of massage skills, they couldn\u2019t help but reveal an expression of excitement.\u201cHow long does Sun Mo have to massage him? He wouldn\u2019t let everyone wait until the lesson ended, right?\u201dA few minutes later, Zhang Sheng grumbled. But the moment his voice rang out, the spirit qi of the surroundings began to fluctuate as they surged over and gathered around Zhang Zhong.When the initial pain faded away, what remained was an indescribable feeling of comfort. Hence, Zhang Zhong was in a daze. He was intoxicated. At this moment, the sounds of two slaps rang out as a feeling of burning pain could be felt on his face. After that, Sun Mo started to berate him.\u201cFocus your attention, try to break through!\u201dSun Mo instructed.\u201cAh?\u201dZhang Zhong drooled from the corners of his mouth. He had a dumbfounded look on his face. (Breakthrough? What breakthrough? Teacher, you should continue your massage. Don\u2019t stop, it\u2019s simply too comfortable.)Sun Mo\u2019s circulation technique was very strong. Zhang Zhong\u2019s energy channels and meridians were cleared, allowing spirit qi to directly surge into his body.Suddenly!The spirit qi in Zhang Zhong\u2019s body exploded like a hurricane. With a boom, not only did the dust on the ground fly up, but the corner of the robes and the hair of the students in the surroundings fluttered wildly as well.The entire scene was completely silent; everyone was looking at Zhang Zhong.There were many thoughts in the hearts of everyone, but they didn\u2019t know what to say. Zhou Shanyi was still the boorish one, and he directly howled in disbelief.\u201cWhat the f*ck, he broke through just like that?\u201dDue to being overly shocked, Zhou Shanyi accidentally spewed vulgarities.\u201c\u2026\u201dJiang Yongnian\u2019s lips twitched. Based on lip reading, one could tell he was saying the three words \u2018f*** your mom\u2019.Zhang Zhong gradually regained his senses. \u201cEh? Who am I? Where am I?\u201d\u201cZhang Zhong, you just broke through. Why are you not thanking Teacher Sun yet?\u201dA student at the side silently reminded him. His gaze was filled with envy, and all the other students had similar expressions.Wasn\u2019t this Zhang Zhong too lucky? They should have seized the opportunity to ask Sun Mo earlier. What a pity.\u201cI broke through? How is this possible?\u201dZhang Zhong subconsciously mumbled, but after he spoke, he discovered something wrong. His condition was a lot better now. Not only was his sight and hearing very clear, but even his body felt much more comfortable.This was the feeling after a breakthrough.\u201cTea\u2026Teacher Sun!\u201dZhang Zhong stuttered, his face was filled with bewilderment. How did he manage to achieve a breakthrough?\u201cAlthough you have broken through, there are still some problems with your energy channels. You have to rest for at least a week before you start with your meditation again.\u201d After Sun Mo instructed, he patted Zhang Zhong\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou can sit down now!\u201dZhang Zhong sat down like a wooden puppet. His face was still filled with bewilderment.(Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands, awesome!)Qi Shengjia waved his clenched fist in the air and roared wildly in his heart.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +30.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia: Friendly (458/1,000).\u201cTeacher is so awesome!\u201d\u201cTeacher is so awesome!!\u201dLu Zhiruo grabbed Li Ziqi by her arm and jumped about happily.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +30.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Friendly (283/1,000).\u201cHmph, that\u2019s only natural.\u201dLi Ziqi swept her gaze across the entire lecture theater.

Are you all convinced now?)Ding!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +15.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi: Friendly (146/1,000)\u201cDo you think I would still have a chance if I begged Sun Mo to be my teacher now?\u201dZhou Xu prodded Qi Shengjia\u2019s arm as he asked in a low voice.\u201cI have no idea. But after this public lecture is over, you will definitely have many competitors.\u201dQi Shengjia was smiling so widely that his eyes couldn\u2019t be seen.Zhou Xu was startled before shaking his head dispiritedly.Ding!Favorable impression points from Zhou Xu +10.Prestige connection with Zhou Xu: Neutral (51/100).Four more system notifications rang out, making Sun Mo very satisfied. Through this, he could gauge the thoughts of his students.The papaya girl and honest guy Qi Shengjia had always admired him. Li Ziqi also admired him, but she was more rational. As for Zhou Xu, he was just someone who always followed the crowd. There was no need to care about him.As for his three other personal disciples, they remained indifferent.Sun Mo involuntarily glanced over.Xuanyuan Po had his eyes closed as he relaxed. Next to him, Tantai Yutang smiled and nodded upon seeing Sun Mo\u2019s gaze. Meanwhile, Jiang Leng was expressionless and had his head lowered.Ding!Favorable impression points from Jiang Leng +5.Prestige connection with Jiang Leng: Neutral (40/100).Sun Mo was speechless. Although the amount wasn\u2019t high, it was better than nothing.In the lecture theater, the sounds of commotion rang out, growing louder and louder. Both the students and the teachers were discussing Sun Mo\u2019s Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands.This was especially so for those students who already knew that there were problems with their energy channels. All of them already planned to consult Sun Mo after the lesson ended.\u201cVice-headmaster Zhang, how about now? Do you still want to investigate Sun Mo?\u201dAn Xinhui suddenly spoke up, retaliating.\u201cHmph!\u201dZhang Hanfu\u2019s expression turned ashen. This Sun Mo was so lucky. It was unknown where he had learned such a powerful massage technique. How infuriating.\u201cWhat does that snort mean?\u201dAn Xinhui shook her head as a puzzled look appeared on her face.\u201cHehe!\u201dJin Mujie did her best to hold back her laughter. So, Headmaster An also had such a naughty side to her.Zhang Hanfu pretended he didn\u2019t hear it. If it wasn\u2019t for him wanting to watch Sun Mo screwing up so he could regain some face, he would have left long ago. However, he couldn\u2019t afford to wait anymore. He cast a forceful glance at Feng Zewen and signaled for him to act.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIf this continued, Sun Mo\u2019s first public lecture would end perfectly.\u201cLittle Lin, I know you have always felt that Sun Mo is unworthy of me and that the circumstances are very unfair for me. This is why you always view Sun Mo with hostility. However, I hope that you will not continue looking at him with prejudice.\u201dAn Xinhui lowered her voice, \u201cTry to understand him a little!\u201dZhou Lin fell silent. Sun Mo\u2019s brilliance made her unable to rebut or find any excuses. He had just used a pair of hands to help that student achieve a breakthrough. Wasn\u2019t this matter a little too exaggerated?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No matter how much he didn\u2019t want to admit this, it was a fact that Sun Mo was truly stronger than him.Upon acknowledging this point, Zhang Sheng\u2019s sense of superiority was completely crushed. He pushed away Ludi at his side and staggered as he rushed out from the back door of the lecture theater.He could no longer continue watching on, or the amount of envy he felt would explode. He would be so jealous that he wouldn\u2019t be able to control himself and might rush up the rostrum to beat Sun Mo up.No one paid attention to Zhang Sheng because the gazes of all the teachers were on Sun Mo. Compared to the commotion created earlier when he treated Wang Gang, everything was silent now.As long as one wasn\u2019t stupid, they would know that Sun Mo had true capabilities.Taking a step back, even if Sun Mo did hire actors, he still managed to allow the student to break through after a few minutes of massage. This capability was something even the teachers proficient in massage wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve despite them having a few years of experience.\u201cWhat is that Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands exactly?\u201d\u201cCould it be a saint-grade cultivation art?\u201d\u201cAre you joking? Do you take saint-grade cultivation arts as cabbages?\u201dThe teachers started to discuss, but there were no more voices of doubt on Sun Mo.Sun Mo was very satisfied with this result. At the same time, he silently praised Divine Sight. It was truly powerful!It appeared as though Sun Mo had chosen students randomly. But in truth, he had already scanned the data of these students with Divine Sight.The students he had chosen had problems in their bodies, and they could be resolved with the skill he currently possessed.It was just that the teachers here, including Zhang Hanfu and Jin Mujie, didn\u2019t know Sun Mo\u2019s plans. They thought he had chosen the students randomly. This was why Sun Mo\u2019s success caused them to feel even more shocked.Zhang Zhong, who sat down, finally regained his senses and understood what happened to him.\u201cI actually broke through?\u201dSeeing the gazes of envy the surrounding students shot him, other than excitement in Zhang Zhong\u2019s heart, he also felt gratitude for Sun Mo.Originally, he simply came here out of boredom upon hearing a new teacher was giving his first public lecture. He didn\u2019t expect that he would actually benefit so much.\u201cI\u2019ve simply profited many times over!\u201dZhang Zhong smiled so widely that his teeth were revealed.Ding!Favorable impression from Zhang Zhong +40.Prestige connection with Zhang Zhong unlocked: Neutral (40/100).Seeing Zhang Zhong who was the same as him being able to break through his bottleneck, Wang Gang felt so depressed that he wanted to cry. Why couldn\u2019t the lucky one be him?\u201cHow good would it be if I can experience Teacher Sun\u2019s Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands?\u201dWang Gang decided to seek guidance from Sun Mo after the lecture ended. If he failed the first time, he would try a second time. If he failed the second time, he would try the third time. In any case, he had to experience the effects of the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands.\u201cQuickly look!\u201dLi Ziqi tugged on Lu Zhiruo\u2019s arm.The papaya girl turned and almost jumped in fright. Many students were gathering outside the lecture theater\u2019s window. They were like lizards and had their faces pressed on the windows, staring into the lecture theater.\u201cAiya, don\u2019t squeeze!\u201dThese students rushed over here after feeling the fluctuating spirit qi.\u201cNext question please!\u201dSun Mo spoke. But just when his voice rang out, a \u2018boom\u2019 rang out from the lecture theater\u2019s backdoor. The backdoor was pushed open as a bunch of students fell down.\u201cI said already, don\u2019t squeeze!\u201dA student grumbled.\u201cIf you guys want to listen to the lecture, go and find a seat!\u201dSun Mo instructed.The students were like ants scalded by boiling water. They immediately rushed to the seating area and began to snatch seats. After all, they had seen Sun Mo\u2019s earlier performance.In the blink of an eye, the empty seats were all filled up. There were even students standing in the lecture theater with depressed looks on their faces.Upon seeing this, all the intern teachers revealed looks of envy. This was Sun Mo\u2019s first public lecture, yet the seats were full?Truly awesome!Jiang Yongnian stealthily shot a glance at Zhang Hanfu. The expression of the vice headmaster didn\u2019t change, but he knew that this vice-headmaster was about to be angered to death.\u201cGo and stand behind!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s voice was calm, and no hints of arrogance could be heard. It was like the things happening now was something insignificant.This calmness caused Jin Mujie to nod in admiration.\u201cNext\u2026\u201dBefore Sun Mo could finish speaking, the students in front all raised their hands together. They were like towering trees in a forest, easily causing one to get lost.\u201cYou have already broken through, why are you raising your hand?\u201dThose seated around Zhang Zhong were filled with resentment when they saw him raising his hand.(There are already so many people competing for the chance to be chosen, yet you still raise your hand to drag down the probability? Can\u2019t you just stand aside?)Zhang Zhong pretended not to hear anything because he also saw Wang Gang raising his hand.Feng Zewen cast a glance at his student, Duan Wu, telling him to move into action.Duan Wu nodded. After that, he stood up and shouted loudly, \u201cTeacher Sun, I have a question I wish to consult you on. Can I ask what are the things that have a connection to spirit qi absorption?All the students stared at Duan Wu. They were extremely unhappy that he didn\u2019t follow the rules, but they were also helpless.Sun Mo didn\u2019t reply immediately. Instead, he simply stared at this youth.Duan Wu, 16 years old. A fourth-year student at the ninth level of body-refinement realm.Other than the data, a row of red words appeared in Sun Mo\u2019s vision.Note: Feng Zewen\u2019s personal disciple.\u201cAs expected, he has acted!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips curled up.\u201cTeacher Sun?\u201dDuan Wu called out. There was respect on his face, but in his heart, he was already planning on making things difficult for Sun Mo.This question was something Teacher Feng prepared. As long as Sun Mo answered, he would continue on with more questions, leading Sun Mo into the hook step by step before \u2018killing\u2019 him.Feng Zewen was a veteran with many years of experience. It was effortless for him to find some difficult questions and lay some traps within them.\u201cBefore I answer your question, I want to say a few things. I can understand your feelings of wanting to urgently resolve your problems. But can you please respect the other students? Why can you ignore the rules and stand up to shout your question, while the others have to raise their hands to wait for their turns?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s tone was unfriendly. \u201cBy doing so, have you considered the feelings of those students whose chance of asking a question was snatched by you?\u201dDuan Mu wanted to explain, but he was interrupted by Sun Mo.\u201cActually, I wanted to let this short-haired student ask a question. Now that you jumped the queue, he might have lost his chance of improving his strength.\u201dAfter Sun Mo finished speaking, the short-haired student immediately glared angrily at Duan Wu. It was like his chance of breaking through had been stolen.The other students also started to look at Duan Wu with hostility. (Yeah, why are you the only one that doesn\u2019t need to abide by the rules?)\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201dDuan Mo panicked. He stuttered and subconsciously glanced at Feng Zewen.\u201cFool!\u201dFeng Zewen cursed. (By looking at me, wouldn\u2019t everyone know that I was the one who told you to do this?)\u201cAlright, I will guide you now. Based on the strength of your muscles, you should be a fourth-year, right?\u201dIt was like Sun Mo didn\u2019t notice it as he continued to ask.\u201cYes!\u201dDuan Wu nodded.Only a small part of the teachers could tell that this student was indeed a fourth-year. Sun Mo\u2019s judgment was truly powerful.\u201cA fourth-year? Why would you ask me such a basic question even first-years would know? Are you stupid?\u201dSun Mo suddenly scolded. The other party was a personal disciple of Feng Zewen. In that case, this question definitely had a trap in it.His earlier outburst was laying the foundation, making the other students feel like their benefits were snatched and making them regard Duan Wu with hostility. Hence, Duan Wu now was like the target of a multitude of arrows. Not only wouldn\u2019t anyone feel that his scolding was too over-the-top, but they might also rejoice in the fact that Duan Wu was scolded.\u201cEh!\u201dDuan Wu, the other students, and the teachers were stunned. They suddenly felt like asking, Teacher Sun, why is your temper suddenly so bad?However, just like what Sun Mo had anticipated, no one felt that his behavior was over-the-top.\u201cI naturally am not stupid. I\u2019m at the ninth level of the body-refinement realm!\u201dHow could a young man endure someone underestimating him? Also, this was done in the view of the public, in front of so many teachers and students. Hence, he immediately rebutted.\u201cIn that case, you are intentionally asking this question to prank me?\u201dSun Mo questioned.\u201cAh? No, I\u2019m not!\u201dDuan Wu hurriedly tried to clear the air. Although he also viewed Sun Mo with hostility due to his relationship with Teacher Feng, he would never dare to bear such blame.In the countries of the nine provinces, respecting teachers was the tradition. If a student dared to prank a teacher, that student could just wait to be expelled.\u201cIn that case, you are stupid then? Scram. Copy [Introduction to Spirit Qi] 100 times and hand it to me next week!\u201dSun Mo was unhappy; hence, his tone wasn\u2019t nice to hear.\u201cAh?\u201dDuan Wu was stunned. He subconsciously cast another glance at Feng Zewen.There were no solutions to it. [Introduction to Spirit Qi] was an extremely thick book. If he was to copy the book out 100 times, his hands would definitely be crippled.\u201cDid you not hear what I say?\u201d Sun Mo berated. \u201cGet out, go and copy the book!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dSeeing that Feng Zewen wasn\u2019t speaking for him, Duan Wu could only lower his head and run out of the lecture theater.\u201cAh, our teacher is so smart.\u201dLi Ziqi also noticed Duan Wu shooting a glance at Feng Zewen, and she instantly understood what was going on. Hence, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh out.This time around, Tantai Yutang also revealed an amused smile.The majority of teachers and students still had no idea about the undercurrents of this matter, but quite a few with sharp eyes managed to see through everything.\u201cAwesome!\u201dJin Mujie silently mused. This Sun Mo was so smart, and the main point was that after his successful two cases of guidance, who would dare to say that he wasn\u2019t capable?Thus, even if Sun Mo tossed Duan Wu out of the lecture theater, no one would feel that he was escaping because he wasn\u2019t able to answer the question.Ding!Favorable impression from Jin Mujie +1.Prestige connection with Jun Mujie: Neutral (5/100).Upon hearing the system notification, Sun Mo silently mused at how great the sight of a 3-star great teacher was. His performance from earlier until now was already very good, but he only managed to obtain 1 favorable impression point from Jun Mujie. How stingy.An Xinhui looked at Sun Mo and sank into her memories. Was her childhood sweetheart so two-faced? He easily crushed Feng Zewen\u2019s first play.\u201c\u2026\u201dFeng Zewen was stunned. What should he do now? Never did he expect that Sun Mo basically wouldn\u2019t give Duan Wu a chance to make him answer the question.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo swept his gaze over the students and searched for another of Feng Zewen\u2019s personal disciples.Actually, Sun Mo had guessed that given Feng Zewen\u2019s status as a 1-star great teacher, he wouldn\u2019t enter the fray himself to test Sun Mo.If Feng Zewen lost, he would lose face. If he won, it was only to be expected. Hence, there was an 80% to 90% chance that Feng Zewen would ask his personal disciples to assist him in making things difficult for Sun Mo.Sun Mo swept his gaze around and his eyes finally landed on a student. His eyes suddenly brightened. (Very good. Feng Zewen, I\u2019m going to make you lose all your face next.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He began to stroll around in the lecture theater.The students raised their hands, and they were all looking at Sun Mo, hoping to be selected.\u201cThis student, what is your name?\u201dSun Mo pointed to a male student sitting in the third row. He was very handsome and had a pair of \u2018sword brows\u2019 that made him look extraordinary.\u201cHaha!\u201dFeng Zewen started. After that, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Wasn\u2019t Sun Mo\u2019s luck a little too bad? This student he had chosen was none other than another one of his personal disciples.\u201cWill you survive this time around?\u201dFeng Zewen coldly snorted as he waited to see a good show.\u201cFan Ding!\u201dThe male with the sword brows stood up and bowed.\u201cDo you have a personal teacher?\u201dSun Mo asked.Fan Ding\u2019s handsome sword brows furrowed. He was worried that if he said yes, Sun Mo would respond with a \u2018why don\u2019t you consult your teacher? You don\u2019t trust him or are you making things difficult for me?\u2019Earlier, his junior brother was tossed out of the lecture theater and even had to copy [Introduction to Spirit Qi] 100 times. He had no wish to follow the same disastrous path as his junior brother.But for this question, Fan Ding didn\u2019t dare to lie too. He could only brace himself and reply, \u201cYes.\u201dFeng Zewen\u2019s smile vanished. Why didn\u2019t this Sun Mo play his cards out according to logic? What was the purpose of him asking who was the student\u2019s teacher?Luckily, Fan Ding was smart enough to skip the important details. He didn\u2019t reveal Feng Zewen\u2019s name.\u201cOh? Who is it?\u201dSun Mo continued to ask.This time around, Fan Ding had no way to continue being perfunctory. His tone was filled with respect as he answered, \u201cIt\u2019s teacher Feng Zewen!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dSun Mo nodded.The teachers who sat at the back also turned to glance at Feng Zewen for a while before shifting their gaze back to Sun Mo.Quite a few people had heard about the \u2018arranged battle\u2019 between Sun Mo and Feng Zewen during the intern teachers\u2019 meeting. Hence, even by using their buttocks to think, they all understood that there must be something behind the fact that someone like Fan Ding, who was the personal disciple of a great teacher, actually came to listen to a public lecture by a new teacher. If someone said that he wasn\u2019t following the instructions of his personal teacher Feng Zewen, who would believe it?Now, the problem was that should Sun Mo accept the challenge or would he respond with a, \u2018so you are asking me this? Is it because you feel that your own teacher cannot make it?\u2019The atmosphere in the lecture theater grew heavy. Everyone was waiting for Sun Mo\u2019s next action.\u201cTeacher Feng, you wouldn\u2019t mind me answering his question right?\u201dSun Mo smiled and turned to look at Feng Zewen.Usually, if a student already had a personal teacher, the student wouldn\u2019t easily consult other teachers unless their question lay in a domain that their personal teachers weren\u2019t proficient in.If not, it would be a sign of disrespect.\u201cI don\u2019t mind!\u201dFeng Zewen also smiled, displaying his grace as a great teacher.\u201cIn that case, Student Fan, what question do you have for me?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s attitude was amiable.\u201cZe, how daring!\u201dEven for Jiang Yongnian, someone with a personality that made him hard to feel impressed, couldn\u2019t help but praise Sun Mo at this moment.Ding!Favorable impression from Jiang Yongnian +1.Prestige connection with Jiang Yongnian unlocked.

Current state: Neutral (1/100).Since Fan Ding was Feng Zewen\u2019s disciples, the question he was going to ask definitely wouldn\u2019t be too simple. Yet, Sun Mo still dared to accept the challenge. His courage was worthy of admiration.\u201cRecently, my state of mind is filled with distractions during meditation. I have no way to focus my thoughts and calm my heart. I also have no idea what the reason is.\u201dFan Ding consulted.(Isn\u2019t your massage technique very powerful? In that case, I\u2019ll ask you a question pertaining to the spirit-refinement realm. Your massage technique wouldn\u2019t possibly be effective toward one\u2019s mental state and psyche, right?)Sun Mo didn\u2019t reply directly. He stared at Fan Ding. (I already knew that your question would be tricky. But it\u2019s fine, I have no intention to answer it anyway.)\u201cTeacher?\u201dFan Ding felt a little scared upon being stared at like this. When Sun Mo\u2019s hand suddenly landed on his shoulder, he subconsciously evaded.\u201cHaha, could it be that he doesn\u2019t know the answer?\u201dThe teachers of Zhang Hanfu\u2019s factions all felt joy.\u201cThis student, as long as you don\u2019t visit brothels so often, you won\u2019t find it impossible to focus your thoughts and calm your heart.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s voice was calm, yet his words caused an uproar in the lecture theater.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s so funny that I could die. This is the first time I heard of such an answer.\u201d\u201cThis can work too?\u201dEveryone in the lecture theater didn\u2019t know what expressions they should make upon hearing this \u2018guidance\u2019 from Sun Mo.\u201cHe is too frivolous. This is a public lecture, how can Sun Mo say something like that?\u201dSome of the teachers criticized him, as a bitter and hateful look appeared in their eyes.Fan Ding\u2019s expression turned malevolent. His face turned red from his emotions as he explained, \u201cI\u2019ve never done such a thing. Stop talking nonsense, I would never visit a brothel!\u201dAlthough in the Nine Provinces of Middle-Earth, things were the same as the ancient eras of China, and there was nothing wrong with men visiting brothels to seek entertainment, such a thing was forbidden for students.If they did this, students who were in their growth period wouldn\u2019t only hurt their own body\u2019s essence and affect their cultivation, their wills would also become corrupt as they became mesmerized in the feeling of lovemaking.\u201cIs that so? How did you get a venereal disease then?\u201dSun Mo questioned.Besides Fan Ding, he could see various data floating out. There was a row of red-colored words saying that Fan Ding contracted a venereal disease five months ago. This caused his qi and blood to decline in vitality.This was a filthy disease that was highly infectious.Hua!It was like a hurricane blew through the lecture theater. A commotion immediately occurred.The students were astonished while the teachers were frowning.The nature of this question was a very serious one. If it was verified to be the truth, Fan Ding would definitely face expulsion.As Fan Ding\u2019s teacher, Feng Zewen naturally couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. He leaped from his seat.\u201cTeacher Sun, do you have any proof? How can you speak such nonsense?\u201dFeng Zewen glared at Sun Mo. If his actions earlier were because of Zhang Hanfu\u2019s orders, he was doing so now because he was truly very unhappy with Sun Mo.Fan Ding was handsome and had an extraordinary background. He was someone that respected Feng Zewen a lot too.Naturally, the most important thing was that Fan Ding had outstanding talent and was the most elite student under him. Now that Fan Ding was vilified by Sun Mo in this manner, Feng Zewen felt like he was seeing his own precious treasure being tainted. So, how could he endure it? He wanted nothing more than to break Sun Mo\u2019s head now.\u201cDo you know that among the entire cohort of fifth-years, regardless of strength or talent, Fan Ding ranks among the top. Even if the number of female students pursuing him doesn\u2019t reach 100, there must be several tens of them. Even if he couldn\u2019t endure the temptation of female charms, he wouldn\u2019t visit a brothel no matter what.\u201dFeng Zewen mocked.From Feng Zewen\u2019s point of view, if Fan Ding wanted it, he could change girlfriends faster than someone could change shirts. Why was there a need for him to visit a place like a brothel?\u201cTeacher Feng, whether he has contracted a venereal disease or not, wouldn\u2019t you know if you simply ask him?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips twitched.\u201cFan Ding, tell him the answer!\u201d Feng Zewen roared.\u201cTeacher Sun, you are the one with the venereal disease. Your whole family has a venereal disease!\u201dIt was like Fan Ding found his backbone in Feng Zewen. He immediately howled his reply.The atmosphere was suddenly filled with the smell of gunpowder.\u201cAi, Teacher Sun is too careless. Does he think that he has god hands and is able to tell what disease a student is suffering from with just a few touches? In that case, why would we still need doctors?\u201dZhou Xu shook his head. He thought that Sun Mo must have felt the earlier situations went too smoothly; hence, he had gotten careless.The majority of teachers had the same thoughts. After all, even if it was a doctor seeing a patient, that doctor would still have to practice the four ways of diagnosis\u2014look, listen, question, and feel the pulse of the patient.\u201cHehe, you don\u2019t want to admit it? Or maybe you yourself have no idea about it? Come, are there teachers proficient in the way of medicine here? Diagnose him!\u201dSun Mo swept his gaze toward the teachers in the back rows.A few teachers that were proficient in medicine didn\u2019t move. Because if they chose to examine Fan Ding, they would offend Feng Zewen. All of them wanted to steer clear of this pool of muddy water.\u201cSun Mo, don\u2019t go overboard.\u201dFeng Zewen roared in rage.\u201cSince he has a clear conscience, why is there a need to worry about an examination?\u201dSun Mo shrugged.\u201cWhat happens then after they checked and it\u2019s revealed that he doesn\u2019t have a venereal disease?\u201d Feng Zewen spoke overbearingly, \u201cI\u2019ll find a prostitute with a venereal disease and make you sleep with her!\u201d\u201cSure!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s answer was calm and collected.However, the teachers here weren\u2019t that calm. Wasn\u2019t Sun Mo too ruthless? Now, they were talking about venereal diseases. Venereal diseases could be considered as ineradicable diseases. And the most important thing was that contracting this disease was extremely shameful.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201dLu Zhiruo was very anxious. She grabbed Li Ziqi\u2019s arm tightly.Li Ziqi\u2019s expression was heavy. \u201cIn any case, I believe in teacher.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cTeacher Zhou, isn\u2019t your side occupation a doctor? Come and examine Fan Ding!\u201dAfter Feng Zewen spoke, he glanced at Fan Ding. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, for the humiliation you suffered, I will make sure he pays it back with interest!\u201dZhou Shanyi was old and had a good personality. He always had a smile on his face and preferred to remain neutral. Now that he was named, he couldn\u2019t help but hesitate. He had no wish to act.\u201cTeacher Zhou, there\u2019s no need to hesitate!\u201dZhang Hanfu urged.An Xinhui frowned as she glanced at Sun Mo. Just when she wanted to say something, she saw Sun Mo shaking his head slightly at her and mouthing some words.\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201dBecause they were childhood sweethearts, An Xinhui understood what he was trying to say. Also, given how confident Sun Mo looked, she decided to believe in him for this time around.Zhou Shanyi brought Fan Ding out of the lecture theater and went to the toilet. Two other teachers followed them to act as witnesses.Feng Zewen panted angrily as he glared at Sun Mo. He would wait for Zhou Shanyi\u2019s report before using his entire strength to deal with Sun Mo.\u201cI will definitely chase you out from school and make it so that you have no way to turn the situation over to save yourself.\u201dFeng Zewen vowed.The examination didn\u2019t take too long. About five minutes later, the four of them returned.\u201cTeacher Zhou, tell us about the results!\u201dFeng Zewen was impatient.Teacher Zhou swallowed a mouthful of saliva.\u201cSpeak!\u201dZhang Hanfu urged. \u201cNo matter what the situation is, just report it honestly. There\u2019s no need for you to worry about their reputation. Since they dared to say it, they should already be prepared to face the consequences.\u201dAlthough Zhang Hanfu used the term \u2018them\u2019, everyone knew he was referring to Sun Mo.\u201cThis\u2026this\u2026\u201dZhou Shanyi glanced at Feng Zewen. He wanted to say something but hesitated.\u201cTeacher Zhou, you mustn\u2019t lie to give face to your colleague. After all, the student in question is here. I can always request other doctors to examine him again!\u201dSun Mo warned.Sun Mo already stated everything so clearly, what else could Zhou Shanyi do? He sighed and stared at Fan Ding before speaking, \u201cThis youth has contracted a venereal disease. The timing should be roughly about three months ago.\u201dHua!Everyone was stunned. All of a sudden, over a hundred gazes, filled with disbelief, turned and fixed on Fan Ding. As for the latter part of \u2018roughly about three months ago\u2019, that was no longer important.The words \u2018venereal disease\u2019 was like a real hammer crashing down.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNo! Impossible!\u201d Feng Zewen grew anxious. His eyes became bloodshot as he shouted, \u201cFan Ding is my most outstanding student, how could he have contracted a venereal disease? You are speaking nonsense!\u201dAlthough Zhou Shanyi was a nice old man, he would also retaliate after being doubted like this in front of the public.\u201cTeacher Feng, if you don\u2019t believe me, you can get someone else to examine your student!\u201dZhou Shanyi snorted coldly. (Doubting my medical capabilities? Do you think I don\u2019t want my honor?)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - God HandsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83: God HandsLordbluefire\u201cNo, it\u2019s impossible. I can\u2019t possibly have contracted a venereal disease.\u201dThe originally calm Fan Ding had a look of astonishment on his face. After that, he began screaming. If this matter was verified as real, his future would be finished.Zhang Hanfu\u2019s expression instantly sank.\u201cIs this real or fake?\u201dUpon seeing Zhou Shanyi coming back, Jiang Yongnian inquired.\u201cIt\u2019s naturally real. However, Sun Mo is truly awesome. Could he really determine the condition of others just by touching them a few times?\u201dZhou Shanyi\u2019s gaze was filled with amazement as he looked at Sun Mo. He couldn\u2019t understand this. Could it be that Sun Mo had a pair of God Hands?The atmosphere in the lecture theater was very chaotic. The scene was a little out of control.\u201cSilence!\u201dJun Mujie spoke, activating her \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019.A moment later, golden-colored faculas filled the entire lecture theater. The motes of light instantly made the students unable to speak.This great teacher halo would cause the words spoken by a great teacher to be imbued with extreme influence.Ordinary teachers would use this to encourage their students. But at Jun Mujie\u2019s level, just a single word or action from her, even if she was \u2018berating\u2019 them, the effects produced from \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 would be overwhelmingly strong.Sun Mo was shocked. He came in contact with one of the motes of light as well. Now when he wanted to speak, his mouth moved but no sound came out. In his mind, the word \u2018silence\u2019 repeatedly appeared.\u201cHow impressive!\u201dSun Mo silently praised. This was the strength of a 3-star great teacher.\u201cFan Ding, have you gone to a brothel before?\u201d Jin Mujie asked.Putong!Fan Ding knelt down before he replied.This was Jin Mujie questioning him. When he saw her moon-white robes as well as the three golden threads at the side of her collar, he didn\u2019t dare to lie.If he lied to a great teacher, his sins would be even greater.\u201cSpeak!\u201dNo one was unconvinced by Jun Mujie\u2019s qualifications when she acted as the arbitrator.\u201cYe\u2026yes!\u201dFan Ding lowered his head and spoke weakly. However, how big was the lecture theater? Everyone could hear his words.Due to the effect of \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019, everyone else couldn\u2019t speak, but their expressions were fascinating. This was especially so for teachers. All of them were looking at Feng Zewen.\u201cFan Ding!\u2019Feng Zewen roared. He was so angered that he almost coughed out blood.Because he was a great teacher, he had some resistance toward Jin Mujie\u2019s \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019. The effect wouldn\u2019t be too great on him.At this moment, Feng Zewen was angry and disappointed. (Can\u2019t you be a little wiser? Given your capabilities, you could choose any girl you wanted to be your girlfriend. Why do you need to go to a brothel?)Jiang Yongnian couldn\u2019t help but shake his head when he looked at Feng Zewen.Why did men go to brothels? Because there was unimaginable happiness to be found there.The temptation of women had always been the grave of heroes. It was all too easy to bury a young man.\u201cTeacher, I was wrong! I was wrong!\u201dFan Ding cried. He began to kowtow on the ground because he didn\u2019t want to be expelled.The forbidden order for students to visit brothels was something decreed by the school.If one was discovered to have flouted the forbidden order, they would be expelled.\u201cFan Ding, you can head down. The school will announce your punishment tomorrow.\u201dJin Mujie no longer questioned him on anything else. She didn\u2019t care about Feng Zewen and Fan Ding\u2019s reputation, but she cared about the reputation of the Central Province Academy.A student contracting a venereal disease due to visiting a brothel. If this matter was to spread, the school\u2019s reputation would surely be affected.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dFeng Zewen didn\u2019t know what to say. As a great teacher, his intelligence wasn\u2019t too bad. There was also no need for Zhou Shanyi to lie. Hence, the student that he held in such high regard had really done such a thing that caused him to feel extremely disappointed.\u201cTeacher, I don\u2019t want to be expelled!\u201dFan Ding panicked. If he was expelled, that would be a black mark on his record. He would definitely be rejected if he wanted to join other schools. So, at the very least, he had to have a certificate saying that he quitted Central Province Academy due to an illness to ensure that his future wasn\u2019t destroyed.\u201cPlead for leniency, yes, please help me to plead for leniency!\u201dFan Ding glanced at his fellow students beside him.Swish!The students beside him immediately retreated. They weren\u2019t fools. Fan Ding was someone that had contracted an infectious venereal disease.This was especially so for the female student beside Fan Ding. Right now, her face was filled with terror. She was trembling and couldn\u2019t even say anything.\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t have an intimate relationship with Fan Ding, you won\u2019t be infected.\u201dSun Mo consoled.\u201cI didn\u2019t! I didn\u2019t!\u201dThe female student hurriedly made things clear.Fan Ding was so angry that his face became green.\u201cVice-headmaster Zhang, do you have any instructions?\u201dAn Xinhui asked.\u201cScram, you are expelled.\u201dCompared to the tactful Jin Mujie, Zhang Hanfu was much more ruthless. What was the use of keeping trash like this? Besides, with the fact that he had a venereal disease, there was no way for him to let that student remain in the school anymore.Fan Ding still wanted to struggle. But he was immediately dragged away by the school\u2019s security who rushed over.\u201cTeacher, help me!\u201dFan Ding\u2019s anguished screams drifted over from the corridor, causing many people to stretch their heads out to look.Feng Zewen endured his anger and went back to his seat. He told himself that he mustn\u2019t leave now. He had to find Sun Mo\u2019s flaw and give him a heavy blow. If not, how could he vent his anger?\u201cWhat an eye-opener Teacher Feng\u2019s student is!\u201dSun Mo ridiculed.\u201cThis fellow truly had no thoughts of going easy now that the situation is in his favor!\u201dJiang Yongnian was joyful. He glanced at Feng Zewen. Even if Feng Zewen was about to explode from anger, he had no choice but to endure this. There was no solution to it. Who told him to be so confident and say that his student had no problems? There was no way for him to turn the situation around and now, his face was heavily smacked.\u201cSun Mo, don\u2019t harp on such matters any longer. Continue with your lecture.\u201dZhang Hanfu spoke, helping Feng Zewen to change the topic.\u201cTeacher is so awesome!\u201dLu Zhiruo was extremely agitated.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +15.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Friendly (298/1,000).\u201cI already said it earlier. Since Teacher Sun dares to say it, he definitely has confidence.\u201dLi Ziqi was complacent.Ding!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +10.Prestige connection with Li Ziqi: Friendly (156/1,000).\u201cAwesome, what\u2019s going on with his hands? How did he know Fan Ding\u2019s situation just by touching him for a little while?\u201dZhou Xu was amazed.Ding!Favorable impression points from Zhou Xu +5.Prestige connection with Zhou Xu: Neutral (56/100).\u201cHis hands are simply the hands of gods, he\u2019s able to achieve anything!\u201dQi Shengjia sighed in admiration.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +20.Prestige connection with Qi Shengjia: Friendly (478/1,000).The system notifications rang out one after another, breaking Sun Mo\u2019s line of thought.\u201cSystem, in the future, can you not send out notifications like this so frequently?\u201dSun Mo touched his ears. In the future, there would be many times where he had to teach a class. If the system notifications kept ringing out, how could he focus?\u201cHarvesting favorable impression points is a type of joy and encouragement.\u201dThe system explained.\u201cI understand, but it is still too noisy!\u201dSun Mo persisted.\u201cAlright then, I will only make a special announcement if there are important favorable impression points. Those that are not so significant, I\u2019ll list them out in an announcement separately.\u201dThe system compromised.\u201cThat\u2019s the correct way. Not going against the host\u2019s will is the mark of a good system!\u201d Sun Mo returned to his rostrum and glanced at the crowd. \u201cNext, the questioning segment will continue. For those who have questions, feel free to raise your hand.\u201dThe students all thrust their hands into the air. The response was even more frenzied compared to earlier.The teachers were whispering to each other while occasionally shooting glances at Sun Mo\u2019s hands. Was the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands he possessed really so powerful?After the lesson ended, they resolved to go to the library and check what sort of cultivation art that was.\u201cInteresting!\u2019Jin Mujie\u2019s interest in Sun Mo grew even greater. She couldn\u2019t help but recall the moments when he had massaged her. It was truly comfortable.Zhou Yong raised his hand and stared at Sun Mo. The emotions of unhappiness gushed forth like the tides, wanting to devour him whole.(What trash are these people?)Leaving aside the fact that there wasn\u2019t a single person that could make things difficult for Sun Mo, the students who had asked questions actually allowed Sun Mo to display his skill and increase his reputation. If this continued, Sun Mo\u2019s first public lecture would conclude perfectly.(No way, this definitely must not happen.)(It has always been I, Zhou Yong, who plays with others. Since you have offended me, don\u2019t think about having an easy time.)Zhou Yong didn\u2019t forget the scene where he had been scolded terribly by Sun Mo. Hence, he squeezed out a smile and shouted with respect in his voice.\u201cTeacher, your performance is too perfect. I truly feel a sense of worship for you!\u201dZhou Yong stood up and applauded madly.The students were influenced and began to applaud as well.Sun Mo glanced at Zhou Yong. He knew that this person had no good intentions in his heart.\u201cTeacher, I have a few questions I wish to consult you on!\u201dCompared to the earlier Duan Wu who was too brash, Zhou Yong was much smarter. He first fawned on Sun Mo before raising a question. The whole process was naturally much smoother.After all, no matter which teacher it was, they wouldn\u2019t feel good about rejecting a question from an admirer under such circumstances.\u201cSpeak!\u2019Sun Mo knew that Zhou Yong had ill intentions, but he wasn\u2019t afraid. As long as Zhou Yong dared to look for trouble, he would let Zhou Yong know why the flowers were red.\u201cWe have already witnessed the splendor of your Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands, it\u2019s very powerful. I feel that it isn\u2019t an exaggeration to call your hands as God Hands.\u201dZhou Yong laughed.The students whispered to themselves. All of them felt that Sun Mo\u2019s ability to be familiarized with the situation of a student after touching their muscles was truly a little too powerful.They didn\u2019t know that Zhou Yong\u2019s words were putting Sun Mo at a disadvantage. The higher Sun Mo rose, the more painful it would be when he fell. Could an ordinary teacher handle such fame?\u201cWe all know that you are Headmaster An\u2019s fiance. In that case, other than God Hands, do you have any other outstanding points that caused Headmaster An to admire you?\u201dZhou Yong blinked and stared at Sun Mo with a look of admiration on his face. Yet, he was coldly laughing in his heart.(Hmph, I\u2019m giving you a chance to showcase your brilliance. I don\u2019t believe you won\u2019t be hooked.)In the school, An Xinhui could be said to be the goddess of all male teachers. They already found Sun Mo unpleasant to the eye due to this matter. If Sun Mo really fell for the trap and began to speak about his other plus points, the male teachers would definitely feel even angrier.At that time, if no one came to look for Sun Mo for trouble, Zhou Yong would change his surname to Sun.In the lecture theater, the students created a commotion upon hearing this.\u201cWhat? Teacher Sun is Headmaster An\u2019s fiance?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026doesn\u2019t it seem that he is a little unworthy?\u201d\u201cWhat points does Headmaster An like in him?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLet alone those of senior year, even the new students knew the intimidating background of An Xinhui. Now that they suddenly heard that Sun Mo was her fiance, all of them felt extremely shocked.\u201cThis Zhou Yong is indeed cunning!\u201dJiang Yongnian\u2019s lips twitched. Although Zhou Yong looked like he was praising Sun Mo, there was a needle hidden in between the silk floss of his words. No one knew how Sun Mo would handle this.If he couldn\u2019t give a proper answer, Sun Mo would then become the public enemy of all the male teachers in the school.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - Great Teacher Halo, Prestige Exploding Forth!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 84: Great Teacher Halo, Prestige Exploding Forth!Lordbluefire\u201cThere\u2019s no need for me to say anything. Just come for my lessons a few more times and you will know my outstanding points.\u201dSun Mo wouldn\u2019t fall for such a shallow trap.\u201cIs this not considered bragging? I know that the quantity of students in a lecture is one of the criteria to determine a teacher\u2019s teaching capability. It would also affect a teacher\u2019s salary. By asking me to come a few more times, are you planning on using me to boost your popularity?\u201d\u201cThe truth triumphs over all rhetorical discussion. You will know areas where you are insufficient in as long as you come and attend a few more of my classes.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s tone was calm.However, his words contained a different meaning in the ears of people like Jin Mujie and An Xinhui.Sun Mo was belittling Zhou Yong because the latter intentionally wanted to provoke him. He wanted Zhou Yong to be angry and lose his calm. After that, Zhou Yong would surely reveal his flaws.All young people were proud. When Zhou Yong heard Sun Mo saying that he had areas where he was \u2018insufficient\u2019 in, his anger immediately surged as he couldn\u2019t help but rebut.\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have time. My teacher is Teacher Xu Shaoyuan, a 2-star teacher. He has also praised me before, saying that I\u2019m a genius.\u201dAfter speaking, cries of admiration rang out from the surroundings.Upon seeing the looks of envy in the eyes of these students, Zhou Yong was complacent. \u201cAlso, my father hired a private tutor for me, and he is also a 2-star great teacher. So, I have no time to come and listen to your lessons.\u201dZhou Yong\u2019s words made his intention clear. (Can your teaching capabilities be compared to my two 2-star teachers?)In the lecture theater, the voices of envy grew louder.\u201cAs expected, Zhou Yong\u2019s clan is truly wealthy!\u201d\u201cIs there even a need to say? His father is a famous magnate of Jinling. I heard that even their bowls for dining are made of gold.\u201d\u201cZhou Yong is already a genius. He also has so many great teachers guiding him. Most probably, we didn\u2019t need to think about catching up to him in this lifetime.\u201dThe students discussed, feeling very depressed. Zhou Yong could enjoy countless educational resources. This was simply too luxurious.Upon hearing the whispers in the surroundings, Zhou Yong looked at Sun Mo as his sense of superiority erupted forth. (This is my true attitude, are you afraid now?)\u201cOh, you mean that you don\u2019t trust Teacher Xu Shaoyuan?\u201dSun Mo retaliated.\u201cAh? Don\u2019t talk nonsense. Teacher Xu Shaoyuan is my esteemed teacher.\u201dZhou Yong hurriedly clarified.What a joke. Xu Shaoyuan was currently seated at the back of this lecture theater. If Sun Mo\u2019s words were heard by him, Zhou Yong would definitely be out of luck.\u201cSince you already have Teacher Xu\u2019s guidance, why is there a need to hire a private tutor?\u201dSun Mo counter-asked.\u201cBe\u2026because\u2026\u201dFor a time, Zhou Yong didn\u2019t know what to reply. He knew that he mustn\u2019t reveal the true answer. If he did so, that would be disrespecting Teacher Xu.For descendants of wealthy clans like them, they would be the future successor of the clans. Hence, they had to be heavily nurtured. How could they only have a single teacher? After all, it was impossible for Xu Shaoyuan to answer Zhou Yong\u2019s questions anytime and anywhere every single day. He also couldn\u2019t focus all his attention on a single student. Hence, Zhou Yong needed a private tutor.After all, things would be much more convenient then.\u201cBecause what?\u201dSun Mo continued to ask, not giving Zhou Yong any time to think. He wanted to force Zhou Yong to say something wrong. \u201cThe fact that your father found a private tutor for you means that you don\u2019t trust Teacher Xu. Earlier, when you spoke about your private tutor being a 2-star great teacher, your tone was filled with arrogance. This was something that everyone heard.\u201dZhou Yong couldn\u2019t help but turn his head and snuck a glance at Xu Shaoyuan. As expected, Xu Shaoyan\u2019s expression was unsightly. Xu Shaoyan was determined not to look at him.Upon thinking of Xu Shaoyan\u2019s petty personality, Zhou Yong began to feel a little anxious.\u201cYou can\u2019t find any excuses any more, right? In truth, from the bottom of your heart, you basically don\u2019t trust Teacher Xu at all!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s tone grew overbearing.\u201cStop farting, it is not true!\u201dZhou Yong panicked. He only thought that his background would sound more impressive if he mentioned that he had two teachers. He wanted to suppress Sun Mo by making it seem that Sun Mo wasn\u2019t able to be compared to his teachers. Who knew that Sun Mo used this point to attack him instead.\u201cThis brat is finished!\u201dUpon hearing Zhou Yong saying the word \u2018farting\u2019, Li Ziqi knew that Sun Mo was going to start a \u2018massacre\u2019 soon.\u201cZhou Yong!\u201dSun Mo shouted, \u201cWho did you say was farting?\u201dIn the entire lecture theater, other than Sun Mo\u2019s roar, everyone else instantly fell silent.\u201cSo, is this your attitude when facing teachers? Apologize now.\u201dSun Mo berated.The gazes of the students in the surroundings landed on Zhou Yong, making him the center of the spotlight.\u201cStand up and apologize!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s tone was strict. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. As long as you committed a mistake, you have to accept the punishment!\u201d\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201dZhou Yong looked at Sun Mo. The other party\u2019s aloof and high-up appearance, as well as his intense tone, made Zhou Yong feel even unhappier. He lifted his head and shouted, \u201cI\u2019m not wrong!\u201dHua!A commotion broke out among the students. All of them stared at Zhou Yong in shock.\u201cHmph. What can you do to me? At most, you can only chase me out from this lecture theater. In any case, I\u2019m not your student. Even if you want to deal with me, you won\u2019t have a chance to.\u201dUpon thinking of this, Zhou Yong calmed down.(Apologizing? Don\u2019t even think about it. This daddy\u2019s face is much more valuable than your face.)Because he was the son of a magnate in addition to him having some talent, Zhou Yong could be considered a tyrant here. If the news of his apology was to spread, wouldn\u2019t he lose all his face?Moreover, if Sun Mo couldn\u2019t handle him, Sun Mo\u2019s prestige would be damaged. Everyone would know in the future that he had no way to handle a student.\u201cThis fellow is too loathsome!\u201dQi Shengjia was very angry, wanting to rush out to hit Zhou Yong.\u201cAh, I feel like killing him!\u201dLu Zhiruo was also extremely indignant.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Since he offended our teacher, he\u2019s definitely dead for sure.\u201dLi Ziqi consoled in a low voice.\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to apologize to me?\u201dSun Mo frowned. He appeared very angry but was actually laughing in his heart. (I was afraid that you would really apologize to me. If you did so, how could I still openly act against you?)\u201cStop talking nonsense!\u201dSince he had already offended Sun Mo, there was no need for him to remain polite. Zhou Yong stood up and prepared to leave the lecture theater. His own teacher was the 2-star great teacher Xu Shaoyuan, and his father was a huge magnate Zhou Yuanzhi. So what if he scolded Sun Mo? Would the school dare to expel him?His father would always give a large sum of money to assist the Central Province Academy every year. If they expelled him, they didn\u2019t even need to dream about getting a single copper coin.\u201cWhy are you guys still standing here in a daze? Let\u2019s go!\u201dZhou Yong called out to his bunch of friends.All these students took Zhou Yong as their leader. Their parents either worked at the workshop of the Zhou clan or they were loyal servants of the Zhou clan. No matter how much they knew that Zhou Yong was in the wrong, if they defied Zhou Yong, their families would all be implicated. Hence, all of them stood up and followed after Zhou Yong.\u201cHmph!\u201dZhou Yong glared at Sun Mo. (Come bite me if you are capable!)Sun Mo didn\u2019t stop Zhou Yong. Instead, the former merely raised his hand and pointed his finger at the latter.Pak!A large amount of golden light shot out from Sun Mo\u2019s finger. It looked like sparks that manifested from the striking of a flint. The golden light shone dazzling and swiftly took the form of a sharp golden arrow.Swish!After the arrow formed, it shot straight toward Zhou Yong.\u201cAh!\u201dJust when Zhou Yong\u2019s bunch of friends wanted to warn him, the golden arrow already shot into his mind. The immense might caused his head to involuntarily rollback.When his head was in its normal position once more, Zhou Yong\u2019s eyes already lost their luster and focus. They were as dim as dead ashes, and his throat also issued unintelligible noises as he simply stood like that at his original location.\u201cIt\u2019s a great teacher halo!\u201dQi Shengjia called out in excitement.\u201cIg\u2026Ignorant and Incompetent?\u201dThe bunch of friends subconsciously retreated a few steps back as they looked at Sun Mo. That was the great teacher halo \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019. After getting hit by it, one would temporarily become an idiot.Zhou Yong could be considered handsome and confident. But now, his mouth was drooling and his saliva made his clothes wet. He truly looked like a retarded fool now.\u201cDo you all still want to leave?\u201dSun Mo asked.The bunch of friends directly shivered. They didn\u2019t dare to match their gazes with Sun Mo and returned to their seats with their fastest speed.\u201cMy heavens, it\u2019s actually the \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019 halo.\u201d\u201cHaha, Zhou Yong was truly asking for it. This time around, he has rammed his toes into a steel board.\u201d\u201cJust based on the fact that he dares to teach Zhou Yong a lesson, I\u2019m going to be his die-hard fan from now on. As long as he is the one giving the lecture, I will definitely appear.\u201dThe students spoke to each other. Their faces were filled with excitement.This school tyrant, Zhou Yong, was extremely infamous in school. For the senior year students, even if they hadn\u2019t been bullied by him before, they had definitely seen him bullying others. Those that were bullied were truly tragic; hence, most students would actively avoid him as they were afraid that they might be targeted.After the teachers saw Zhou Yong cursing at Sun Mo, they knew that this brat was in for it. It was just that they didn\u2019t expect Sun Mo\u2019s punishment would be to use the effect of a great teacher halo.Honestly speaking, this was truly impressive.At this moment, all the intern teachers wanted nothing more than to be the one standing on the rostrum, casting a great teacher halo and stunning the entire crowd.\u201cTeacher is so awesome!\u201dLu Zhiruo applauded excitedly.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +20.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Friendly (318/1,000).\u201cDamn, Sun Mo has gotten into big trouble now.\u201dJiang Yongnian snuck a glance at Zhang Hanfu before turning to glance at An Xinhui. In the vast majority of schools, there would always be a few students with special privileges. These students couldn\u2019t be dealt with normal methods.Zhou Yong was coincidentally one of these students.\u201cHeadmaster An, this great teacher halo by Sun Mo was well-casted indeed.\u201dZhang Hanfu praised.An Xinhui didn\u2019t reply because she knew that Zhang Hanfu was being sarcastic.Jin Mujie surveyed Sun Mo. He should have been planning to use this from the time when Zhou Yong asked the first question.What a good schemer.Indeed, no matter what, Sun Mo was someone with six years of experience as a teacher-in-charge. He knew that young people like Zhou Yong valued their \u2018face\u2019 a lot. They were prideful and vain and were usually extremely arrogant. Now that he wanted Zhou Yong to apologize, this was even tougher compared to him willing to get beaten up. This was why Sun Mo would be so overbearing. He wanted to force Zhou Yong to curse so he could openly and justifiably teach Zhou Yong a lesson.\u201cWould it be bad since I just schemed against a student?\u201dSun Mo asked the system.\u201cFor trash like this, if he doesn\u2019t get expelled as soon as possible, should he be allowed to stay in school and harm the other students?\u201dThe system fully supported Sun Mo\u2019s actions.After activating Divine Sight, Sun Mo could see the various data of Zhou Yong.The note the system wrote was \u2018This guy is trash, quickly kick him out of school so others can have a comfortable environment to study once again.\u2019This was the first time Sun Mo had seen such a merciless evaluation. Since Zhou Yong kept targeting him deliberately, Sun Mo decided to teach him a lesson.Ding!Congratulations, you gained a total of +356 favorable impression points.All of a sudden, a system notification rang out, causing Sun Mo to jump in fright. This was especially so after he heard the terrifying number of points. He was incomparably shocked.\u201cSo many points?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere were a total of 77 people who dislike Zhou Yong. On average, each of them contributed 3 points. This can already be considered little.\u201dThe system explained.Because Sun Mo taught the school tyrant a lesson. He was a hero in the hearts of those students. This was why favorable impression points and admiration were generated.\u201cSpeaking of which, the number of favorable impression points I\u2019ve accumulated should have exceeded 1,000 already, right?\u201d Because Sun Mo had been too busy during these few days, he forgot to ask about it. \u201cWhere\u2019s my achievement reward? You wouldn\u2019t have embezzled it, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Best in the Central ProvincePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85: Best in the Central ProvinceLordbluefireGao Ben held onto a piece of chalk and wrote down words of wisdom on the blackboard. Each word he wrote was magnificent and elegant.\u201cHaha, putting aside what I\u2019ve written, just this beautiful calligraphy alone should be enough to shock the students, right?\u201dGao Ben was very satisfied.In order to achieve this effect, he had secretly practiced writing these words for over 1,000 times.It was true that the students were creating a ruckus, but it was because of the huge noise coming from outside the lecture theater.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI have no idea, but there\u2019s such a big ruckus!\u201d\u201cShould we go and take a look?\u201dThe youngsters were all brimming with curiosity. When this thought came up, they could no longer suppress it. Therefore, some of them started to hunch over and slip out from the back door.By the time Gao Ben finished filling up half the blackboard and turned around, he was stunned.There had been over 200 students at the beginning, but now there were just a little over 100 of them. Many of the seats were emptied.In that instant, Gao Ben started to doubt life. Had he not done well enough? However, he immediately calmed down.(No, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s because the students who left are unable to understand how outstanding I am.)\u201cAlright, let us continue!\u201dIt was fine. Even if only 100 students were coming for his lecture, it was enough. After the class, they could spread words of how good he was. Very soon, many more students would come to attend his classes.As for how many students had gone over to Sun Mo\u2019s side?Sorry, Gao Ben had never thought of Sun Mo as his opponent.\u201cHe won\u2019t have as many as I do!\u201dGao Ben was very confident.\u2026Ding!\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019ve completed \u2018reaching 1,000 favorable impression points\u2019 achievement. Rewarded with a black-iron treasure chest. Please keep up the good work.\u201dThe system\u2019s congratulation was monotone as usual. It was just going about with its job.A big treasure chest that was flashing in a black-iron glow appeared in front of Sun Mo.\u201cKeep it!\u201dSun Mo instructed the system like a master giving orders to his maid. He didn\u2019t despise it even if it was a black-iron treasure chest. Anyway, the chances of an item coming out from it were higher than a lucky treasure chest.However, the next achievement would be to accumulate 10,000 favorable impression points. This would probably need to take one to two months.\u201cHow many favorable impression points do I have now?\u201dSun Mo asked.\u201c1,780.\u201dThat wave earlier had increased quite a lot.If it wasn\u2019t because he was still in the midst of a class, Sun Mo would want to whistle to celebrate.The Starmoon Fruit, worth 1,000 points. After taking it, one\u2019s cultivation realm would increase.Remark, it has amazing effects especially on people in the spirit-refinement realm!Sun Mo\u2019s cultivation level could only be considered at the bottom of the mid-tier amongst the intern teachers. However, it was fine. He\u2019d be able to catch up after eating a few more Starmoon Fruits.\u201cHappy!\u201dSun Mo couldn\u2019t help but snap his fingers. This gave Zhou Yong\u2019s trashy friends a bad scare. Two of them subconsciously bent over and hid under the table. Three of them, who were more cowardly, immediately shot up to their feet and apologized loudly.\u201cTeacher, I was wrong!\u201dThere was no other way around it. They were really scared.They saw how Zhou Yong was drooling. Even though he had banged into the wall, he still continued to bang forward vigorously, not knowing that he should make a turn.\u201cTo be disciplined by \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019? I\u2019d rather die!\u201dYoungsters cared about their faces. There was no way they would want to become idiots and be watched on by the crowds.\u201cSit down!\u201dWhen Sun Mo spoke up, the entire classroom instantly fell silent.Compared to earlier, the students were instantly a lot more docile. All the students who had been sitting sluggishly were now sitting upright, being extremely docile.This was the deterrence of a great teacher halo. (You don\u2019t want to listen? Do you believe that the second \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019 would hit you on the head?)The intern teachers all looked very envious. With Sun Mo having grasped this great teacher halo, there\u2019d be no students who would dare to create trouble in his classes.\u201cAlright, if there are any other students who still have any doubts against me, you can continue to raise questions!\u201dSun Mo scanned the entire lecture theater.The students didn\u2019t dare to look into Sun Mo\u2019s eyes. Wherever his gaze landed, the students would either turn to avoid it or break into a smile.The intern teachers were so jealous that they were losing appetite for their dinner tonight.After Sun Mo\u2019s gaze brushed past these students, it landed on Zhang Hanfu\u2019s face.At the sight of this, Jin Mujie couldn\u2019t help but praise him. (This guy really has guts. You\u2019re just a newly employed teacher, but instead of currying up to Zhang Hanfu, who possesses great authority, you\u2019re challenging him instead?)He had guts!Ding!+1 favorable impression points from Jin Mujie.Prestige connection with Jin Mujie. Current state, neutral (6/100).Feng Zewen clutched his fists tightly, his countenance turning grim. There was a challenge between him and Sun Mo, so he was Sun Mo\u2019s target. However, Sun Mo didn\u2019t even throw a glance at him.What did this mean?Sun Mo felt that he was just Zhang Hanfu\u2019s lackey and wasn\u2019t worth being his opponent.\u201cThis is atrocious!\u201dNo matter how good-tempered Feng Zewen was, he couldn\u2019t stand to be neglected like this. He was just about to create trouble when Teacher Fang Chen, who had doubted Sun Mo earlier, stood up.\u201cTeacher Sun, I have a question.\u201dFang Chen\u2019s tone was cold. It looked as if Sun Mo\u2019s first public lecture was going to wrap up perfectly. How could he accept this? If Sun Mo were to gain fame from this class, Fang Chen would become Sun Mo\u2019s stepping stone. Therefore, he must give Sun Mo a blow.Fang Chen looked at Sun Mo, worried that the latter would shy away and avoid his question. Therefore, before Sun Mo said anything, he spoke out again in an attempt to spite him.\u201cWhy? You can\u2019t be scared, right?\u201dThe atmosphere in the classroom instantly tensed up.\u201cPlease go ahead!\u201dSun Mo raised his hand, gesturing for Fang Chen to continue.\u201cWhat do you think of your judgment in selecting students?\u201dThere was no way that Fang Chen was going to shy away from this.\u201cBest in the Central Province!\u201dSun Mo spoke very calmly.Hua!The moment Sun Mo finished saying this, the crowd rang out with a series of gasps. The teachers, especially, were all stunned. (This is only your first public lecture today, but you dare boast like this?)\u201cToo arrogant!\u201d\u201cSuch nerves!\u201d\u201cBut if a teacher doesn\u2019t even have this bit of confidence, how are they going to teach students?\u201d\u201cIs this \u2018this bit\u2019? Out of 100% worth of confidence in the Central Province Academy, I think Sun Mo alone takes up 99%.\u201dThe teachers spoke amongst themselves, but most of them gave negative ratings. Sun Mo had spoken too arrogantly. Even a secondary saint wouldn\u2019t dare to say something like this.How were a student\u2019s aptitude and growth potential? These would only be completely shown after several years. Who would dare to say that they wouldn\u2019t misjudge someone?\u201cHeh, Sun Mo, at least you know your limitations, not saying that you\u2019re the best in Jinling.\u201dFang Chen sneered, feeling overjoyed. Sun Mo was going to be a target of everyone\u2019s scorn.Sun Mo stared at Fang Chen, his lips curling up into a cold smile.\u201cThis teacher, your capability to understand things is too weak. You better go back and read more books. The \u2018Central Province\u2019 I\u2019m referring to isn\u2019t the Central Province Academy, but the entire Central Province!\u201dThis time around, there wasn\u2019t any commotion.It was as if a cold current from the frozen north had swept past. Instant silence!It turned out that Sun Mo was a lot more arrogant than they had thought. He wasn\u2019t referring to being the best in the Central Province Academy, but the best in Central Province\u2014the third largest province amongst the nine provinces, with the second greatest population!An Xinhui looked at Sun Mo as if she no longer recognized him. That tail that liked to follow behind her when they were young had now grown up to have such an air of dominance?\u201cTsk!\u201dJin Mujie looked at Sun Mo\u2019s gaze and noticed that he wasn\u2019t feeling uneasy nor did he have any hesitations. He was brimming with confidence.Of course, Sun Mo was confident. He possessed the grandmaster-grade \u2018Divine Sight\u2019, and he was able to see all sorts of concealed attributes, let alone one\u2019s potential value.(Gu Xiuxun, what are you looking at? I\u2019m talking about you, you masochist.)This was when it was only at the grandmaster-grade. If he were to open up a few more time emblems and bring it up to the ancestor-grade or even the legend-grade, then the Divine Sight would become a lot more amazing.Gu Xiuxun had graduated as the top scorer from the Myriad Daos Academy. She was a genius that everyone held anticipation for, and she was confident and arrogant. She subconsciously wanted to stand up and retort Sun Mo, but when she met his gaze, her body stiffened up.What kind of gaze was that?It was clear, deep, confident, arrogant, and looked as if it could see through everything.Oh my!When Sun Mo looked at her with this gaze as if he was looking at trash, Gu Xiuxun suddenly twisted her body, feeling as if all of her clothes had been removed. She felt completely exposed, as if she was unable to hide any secrets.\u201cThis guy is really detestable. No one had dared to look at me with such an arrogant gaze. What right do you have? I\u2019m not trash!\u201dGu Xiuxun was used to being revered and treated as a genius. She was bellowing in her heart. But why did she have a strange feeling after being looked at by Sun Mo with this kind of gaze?\u201cTeacher will get into big trouble for saying this.\u201dLi Ziqi was worried.Great teachers were all proud. Sun Mo would definitely attract challengers for being so arrogant.\u201cEn! En!\u201dLu Zhiruo nodded vigorously.Tantai Yutang, who had been completely unconcerned all this while, now wore an interesting expression.Ding!+1 favorable impression points from Tantai Yutang.Prestige connection with Tantai Yutang. Current state, neutral (2/100).The sudden notification took Sun Mo by surprise. Even the honest Qi Shengjia didn\u2019t show admiration for him after he had said this piece. However, this Tantai Yutang contributed a favorable impression point.\u201cHe really is a nutcase!\u201dSun Mo decided that he had to take more notice of this student in the future.As for the commotions from the surroundings, Sun Mo didn\u2019t pay them any heed. During this period, people kept calling him as someone who sponged off a woman, looking down on him, suspecting him, and treating him with disdain. Sun Mo had had enough.This was a good opportunity, so Sun Mo decided to vent out this frustration.(Not satisfied that I said this?)(Then come up and let\u2019s have a challenge of our judgment! Sun Mo, who possesses Divine Sight, can beat the hell out of any challenger.)Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2019re saying that you\u2019re the best in Central Province with your judgment? Then why did you choose that young man who has the word \u2018trash\u2019 on his forehead?\u201dFang Chen smiled. (Sun Mo, let\u2019s see how you\u2019re going to handle this.)No cultivator would draw spirit runes on their body before they came of age. It was because as their body grew, the spirit runes would change its form and become ineffective.Drawing runes was an irreversible process. Due to this, even if this young man who had the word \u2018trash\u2019 on him used to be someone with outstanding talent, he was now trash.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He subconsciously raised his hand to cover his forehead.Even freshmen knew better than to recklessly draw spirit runes on their bodies. Therefore, everyone was surprised when they saw Jiang Leng\u2019s appearance.Who on earth had been so heartless as to draw on a \u2018trash\u2019 on this disciple\u2019s forehead?Seeing Jiang Leng shrinking his shoulders, wanting to hide, Sun Mo was filled with fury. He glared fiercely at Fang Chen.\u201cMay I ask how many stars you have as a great teacher?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t polite at all. (If you have any problems, just come at me. Why are you bringing in my students into this?)He could imagine how upset Jiang Leng must be feeling, to be looked at by so many people with a strange gaze.\u201cUrgh!\u201dFang Chen was speechless. He had no \u2018stars\u2019.Of course, there were quite a number of teachers in the school without any stars. However, when he was asked in a situation where several hundred people had gathered together, he felt embarrassed.\u201cLooking at how you\u2019re stuttering, I guess you have no stars?\u201dSun Mo sneered.\u201cI\u2026 I was only short of ten points last year. I\u2019ll pass the Saint Gate\u2019s test this year and get the certification for a one-star great teacher.\u201dFang Chen explained.\u201cThen can I ask how many students you have?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s gaze was icy-cold.\u201cEleven!\u201dAt the mention of his student count, Fang Chen felt proud again. Over the past few years, he had taken in a few students with his reputation. Although their aptitude was ordinary, they were still his personal disciples.\u201cThat\u2019s quite a lot!\u201dSun Mo praised.\u201cIt\u2019s acceptable!\u201dFang Chen quickly took a peek, wanting to check out if anyone was looking at him with an envious gaze.\u201cOut of them, how many have gotten onto the Greencloud Rankings?\u201dSun Mo continued to ask.Hearing this question, Fang Chen\u2019s countenance changed, and he spoke harshly, \u201cSun Mo, are you a real fool or just acting like one? You think it\u2019s so easy to get into the Greencloud Rankings?\u201d\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it easy? Both Headmaster An Xinhui and Teacher Jin Mujie have students who have gotten into the Greencloud Rankings. Even Teacher Liu Mubai has one. Why can\u2019t your students do the same?\u201d Sun Mo asked.\u201cDon\u2019t try to shun the questions and make excuses. I\u2019m the one asking the questions now.\u201d Fang Chen\u2019s countenance was grim. How could his students\u2019 aptitude compare against them?\u201cIs it because their aptitude is too bad? Since their aptitude is bad, why did you take them in? Was it a misjudgment from your part?\u201dSun Mo spoke each word very clearly and kept shooting off, \u201cOr is it because your standard is too low and isn\u2019t able to teach them?\u201d\u201cSun Mo, other than saying unreasonable things with your glib tongue, what can you do?\u201d Fang Chen reprimanded. It was because he was unable to reply to Sun Mo\u2019s questions. Was he going to say that his students\u2019 aptitude was bad? That would create a distance between their teacher-student relationship in the future.To acknowledge that his guidance capability was too weak? Fang Chen wasn\u2019t that open-minded yet.\u201cYou\u2019re a 40-year-old teacher, but you aren\u2019t even a great teacher. What rights do you have to doubt my eye for picking students?\u201dSun Mo retorted.If it wasn\u2019t because Fang Chen had dragged Jiang Leng into this, Sun Mo\u2019s attitude wouldn\u2019t be as bad.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who is 40 years old. Everyone in your family is 40 years old. I\u2019m only 35 this year. To a teacher, I\u2019m still in my prime,\u201d Fang Chen retorted back.\u201cIf you round it off, wouldn\u2019t that be 40 years old? Aren\u2019t you ashamed that you still haven\u2019t gotten any achievements despite your age?\u201dSun Mo went all-out. \u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d definitely coop myself up at home and devote myself to my studies. By coming out to have a look at someone else\u2019s class? Are you too bored?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dFang Chen\u2019s face flushed up. He pointed at Sun Mo, feeling so angry that even his fingers were trembling.\u201cWhat the hell is with the rounding off?\u201d chuckled Jin Mujie.An Xinhui frowned, her impression toward Fang Chen plunging rapidly. It was normal for there to be competition between teachers, but why did he have to bring in the students?\u201cYou, you, you, you what? You\u2019re 40 years old, but you\u2019re not yet a one-star great teacher. You\u2019ve only taken in 11 students, and yet you\u2019re feeling so pleased with yourself. The most important thing is that you have no achievements to show for yourself. Where did your sense of superiority come from? On what basis do you dare to stand up and question me?\u201cMy heart aches for your students. To think that their teacher doesn\u2019t even strive to improve himself. If I were in their shoes and when others asked me what level my teacher is at, do you think I should lie or say the truth?\u201cIf I were to say the truth, others would laugh at me for being trash, unable to study under a great teacher. What do you think I should do? Beat the person up? Or to come back to you and cry?\u201dSun Mo reprimanded. \u201cStep down. I don\u2019t wish to answer your questions anymore.\u201dThe entire lecture theater was silent.All the students looked at Sun Mo with wide-open eyes and mouth agape. They couldn\u2019t believe that he had shot his mouth away at a senior teacher who had been teaching for over ten years.The most important thing was that all the things he shot off made sense!Students would be very proud if their teacher was a great teacher. When they went out, not only would they be proud to speak up, but their voices would also be louder than others.If it wasn\u2019t because they were too weak and knew that they\u2019d never be able to study under a great teacher, who wouldn\u2019t be willing to become the disciple of a great teacher? It didn\u2019t need to be much. Even a one-star great teacher would do!Pffft!Fang Chen wasn\u2019t able to retort. He spurted a mouthful of blood and his body swayed. His face was pale and his lips were twitching.A huge sense of disappointment and inferiority filled up his chest.Fang Chen had thought about these things before. Or rather, any teacher with a hint of pride and shame would have thought of them.There was a rule for the great teacher\u2019s qualification exam held by the Saint Gate. One would need to pay the examination fee.Fang Chen had taken the test nine consecutive times, and the examination fee he paid each time kept on increasing. Although his heart ached for the money he had to spend, he still didn\u2019t give up. This was because he wanted to get the title of a one-star great teacher. That way, his personal disciples could proudly say that when they went out.The scab on this wound was peeled open by Sun Mo, and it was bleeding profusely.Fang Chen no longer had any plans on keeping up with the argument. He pushed away the people next to him and walked out of the lecture theater, being unsteady in his footsteps. He hadn\u2019t walked far before he fell to the ground.\u201cOh my, a teacher has fainted!\u201dA student cried out. Thankfully, there was a great teacher here who had medical skills. The person quickly went out to give him treatment.The lecture theater was still quiet. However, everyone\u2019s heart was shaken up.Sun Mo really had a sharp tongue. Every word he said really pierced one in the heart.Fang Chen was so pitiful. He had probably been pricked into a sieve.\u201cTeacher is so amazing!\u201dLu Zhiruo mumbled softly.Ding!+20 favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo.Prestige connection with Lu Zhiruo: Neutral 338/100)Jiang Leng didn\u2019t wear any expression, but he supplied a lot of favorable impression points.Ding!+30 favorable impression points from Jiang Leng.Prestige connection with Jiang Leng: Neutral (70/100).\u201cI knew that things would turn out this way!\u201dLi Ziqi didn\u2019t find it strange. It would be surprising if Sun Mo was unable to win.After the matter with Fang Chen, many teachers, who had wanted to make things difficult for Sun Mo, backed off. His tongue was too sharp, and they were unable to win against him.\u201cSun Mo? He should be called Black Doggy Sun instead!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. He\u2019s simply a mad dog. There\u2019s no end to it once he starts biting someone.\u201d\u201cHe was really like a wild dog that had broken off from its leash. It\u2019s so scary!\u201dAll these teachers who were mumbling away belonged to Zhang Hanfu\u2019s faction. They knew that Sun Mo had offended Vice-headmaster Zhang and thus planned on making things difficult for Sun Mo. It was all so that they could get into Vice-headmaster Zhang\u2019s good books. However, no one dared to speak up now.Sun Mo calculated the time and knew that the class was going to end soon. What should he say next? Maybe he should try to win some popularity for his public lectures. However, before Sun Mo could say anything, a voice rang out.\u201cFang Chen doesn\u2019t have the right to ask, but I should have, right?\u201dFeng Zewen looked at Sun Mo. As a one-star great teacher, it would be below him to pose a question to Sun Mo, regardless if he ended up winning or not. However, he couldn\u2019t keep his rage in check.He had prepared a couple of ways to deal with Sun Mo. Duan Wu had been chased out, not even given a chance to ask any questions; Fan Ding was worse\u2014he was going to be expelled. Out of his students, he had admired Fan Ding the most. He had been hoping that Fan Ding would be able to get into the Greencloud Rankings, but now, everything was over.The reason why Feng Zewen was unable to become a two-star great teacher was because he didn\u2019t have any students on the Greencloud Rankings. Now that Sun Mo had destroyed Fan Ding who had the greatest chance of getting into the Greencloud Rankings, it had completely cut off Feng Zewen\u2019s path to \u2018gaining stars\u2019.To a teacher, this was a great feud comparable to that of killing one\u2019s parents.If he didn\u2019t stomp Sun Mo down today, then Feng Zewen wouldn\u2019t be able to vent the frustration in his heart.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Teacher Feng, a one-star great teacher. Of course, you have the right to. Please go ahead!\u201dSun Mo had been waiting for this.\u201cThe fact that you managed to recruit five students means that they believe in you. Then let me ask you, what specialty do you have to convince them to become your disciples?\u201dFeng Zewen spoke in a tone as if he was asking for Sun Mo\u2019s guidance.Gu Xiuxun, who wasn\u2019t seated far off, drew in a cold gasp. Although this question might appear to be him humbly asking Sun Mo for his strengths, it was in fact a question that had hidden malice.If Sun Mo were to give a reply, Feng Zewen would definitely target Sun Mo until he was left speechless. This would prove that Sun Mo\u2019s strength was actually useless.Never look down on one-star great teachers. They definitely had the capability to go to the extent.\u201cFeng Zewen is planning to deal Sun Mo a lethal blow in the area he specializes in!\u201dZhou Shanyi sighed. \u201cWe are all teachers. Do we have to be relentless toward each other?\u201d\u201cIf your best student was destroyed by someone else, would you be able to hold it in?\u201dJiang Yongnian felt that this was very normal.\u201cWhat do I excel in?\u201d Sun Mo smiled and glanced around the classroom. \u201cTeacher Feng\u2019s students are around as well, right? Why don\u2019t you get them to stand up for me to take a look?\u201d\u201cStand up!\u201dFeng Zewen gave the word.12 students immediately stood up, looking at Sun Mo with an unfriendly gaze.They knew of the arranged duel between Feng Zewen and Sun Mo. Therefore, they\u2019d definitely come to cheer on their teacher.Sun Mo walked up to a female student and laughed softly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cWhat is Sun Mo doing?\u201dGu Xiuxun frowned and then thought of a possibility. \u201cHe can\u2019t possibly be wanting to give these students guidance on the spot, right?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was the best way to prove his teaching capabilities. However, it was too difficult. These ten or more students were Feng Zewen\u2019s personal disciples. They\u2019d be hostile against Sun Mo.Zhang Hanfu smiled. Sun Mo was too arrogant. If he knew how to restrain himself, he might be able to stay in school for a few more days. Now that he had angered Feng Zewen and gotten him involved personally, the outcome was within expectations!Things were over for Sun Mo.The same thought appeared in the mind of all the teachers present. It was true that Sun Mo\u2019s performance had been quite good, but there was no way that he\u2019d win against a one-star great teacher.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why was it so noisy? It seemed like someone had shouted just now that a teacher had fainted?However, Gao Ben didn\u2019t have the mood to care about such things. He looked at the ten over students left in the classroom and felt so unhappy that he wanted to scold someone.\u201cAfter the lesson ends, I must go and give feedback to An Xinhui. During lessons, noise and commotion should be prohibited in the teaching building. Violators shall be punished severely!\u201dGao Ben felt depressed because these students were too unstable. They had gone to watch the commotion outside. (Didn\u2019t they know that they should be cherishing this opportunity and listen to my lecture?)However this time, Gao Ben was afraid that his first public lecture\u2019s attendance wouldn\u2019t beat Gu Xiuxun\u2019s, making him furious. To beat Sun Mo and Zhang Lan, what meaning did it serve?\u2026\u201cQin Rong!\u201d the girl replied. Her bearing was very natural and unrestrained.\u201cWhat\u2019s your cultivation level?\u201dSun Mo seemed to be inquiring, but he had already known the answer. From his Divine Sight, he already had a panoramic view of Qin Rong\u2019s data.Fifteen years old, ninth level of Body-Refinement Realm.Strength: 8, even though she isn\u2019t a violent girl, her punch can kill a cow.Intellect: 7, IQ has exceeded average statistics.Agility: 9, this is her advantage.Will: 3, she is extremely anxious recently.\u2026Potential value: high.Remark: She tried 3 times to break through to the spirit-refinement realm but failed all due to various reasons. As such, it left a huge phobia in her heart.If she wasn\u2019t coached to walk out of this plight in time, her whole future would be gone.\u201cBody-Refinement Realm, ninth level!\u201dAfter Qin Rong finished saying, she heard the sounds of exclamation coming from her surroundings. Through her peripheral vision, she could even see the gazes of envy cast by the students. However, she didn\u2019t feel proud at all because she had already been stuck in this realm for as long as half a year.This had already left a huge mental pressure on Qin Rong. What would she do if she were to fail again at breaking through?\u201cEn!\u201dSun Mo was asking the questions randomly; all were pertaining to cultivation.Qin Rong was indeed worthy to be the personal disciple chosen by Feng Zewen. Not only was her potential value high, but her way of answering Sun Mo\u2019s questions was also clear, orderly, and logical.\u201cHumph!\u201dFeng Zewen snorted proudly. (Trying to find loopholes on my student to attack me? Dream on!)\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you try to break through to the spirit-refinement realm? If you were to step into the spirit-refinement realm at fifteen years old, that will be a dazzling achievement!\u201dSun Mo purposely induced the topic.When he had been browsing through the students\u2019 data just now, he had been paying special attention to see if Feng Zewen\u2019s personal disciple was around.Since he knew that Feng Zewen would definitely raise difficult questions and his student would surely become his carriage runner, Sun Mo had been looking at the remarks of these ten over students. He had already started to ponder over how to make use of them to counterattack.Now, the opportunity had arrived.Qin Rong\u2019s expression became gloomy. Sun Mo\u2019s words made sense and she certainly understood. If she had succeeded, she would be highly regarded by Teacher Feng. Whether it was coaching or resources, it would all be inclined toward her. However, she had failed three times.This had consumed all of the teacher\u2019s patience.When she had failed to break through for the first time, her teacher had been worried and had comforted her. However, when she had failed for the second time, her teacher had felt more disappointment instead.As for the third time, Qin Rong simply didn\u2019t dare to tell her teacher as she couldn\u2019t bear the consequences.Even though they were all students from the same teacher, there was a difference between them. A good student would always receive some preferential treatment.However, Qin Rong\u2019s failures had proven that she was of an inferior standard.Even though Feng Zewen didn\u2019t chase Qin Rong away, the regard he had for her had naturally decreased.\u201cYou\u2019ve failed 3 times already, haven\u2019t you?\u201dSun Mo touched Qin Rong\u2019s shoulder.Upon hearing the words \u20183 times\u2019, Qin Rong was like a wild cat whose tail had been stepped on. The hair on her whole body stood up and she let out a scream.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201dQin Rong tried to deny it at all costs. \u201c2 times, only 2 times.\u201dWhen she was saying those, Qin Rong subconsciously looked at Feng Zewen secretly. Her gaze was filled with fear and anxiousness, and she was so scared that he would find out.Seeing how Qin Rong\u2019s reaction was so intense, some of the teachers guessed that Sun Mo had predicted correctly.\u201cThe first try was 7 months ago. The second try was 5 months ago, and the third try was 2 and a half months back,\u201d Sun Mo spoke bluntly.Qin Rong\u2019s mouth opened wide and she was dumbstruck. (How did he find out?) The timing that he had mentioned was not wrong at all, but she started to refute while quivering and trembling.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t, you\u2019re spouting nonsense!\u201dQin Rong\u2019s pleading gaze was set at Feng Zewen. \u201cTeacher, please don\u2019t believe his words.\u201d\u201cSun Mo, are you done?\u201d Feng Zewen frowned.Sun Mo didn\u2019t respond to Feng Zewen. Rather, he grabbed Qin Rong\u2019s shoulders violently. He stared into her eyes and shouted, \u201cLook at me!\u201dQin Rong subconsciously looked at Sun Mo, a deep sense of fear filling up her gaze. At the same time, there was a slight trace of admiration.There wasn\u2019t anything she could do about it. Since Sun Mo had predicted correctly, Qin Rong\u2019s heart was shaken.This was something even her own teacher couldn\u2019t have done!\u201cQin Rong, everyone\u2019s cultivation path will not be smooth-sailing. Even if that someone was a saint, they would fall as well and have to stand up to repeat the process incessantly.\u201cQin Rong, we as cultivators aren\u2019t afraid of falling. We\u2019re scared of not being able to stand up after it!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it just failing to break through? You should continue trying, so what if you fail for the fourth or fifth time? You\u2019re still young. A lot of people your age are still struggling with the fifth or sixth level of body-refinement.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s voice got louder as he spoke.Hearing this, the worry in Qin Rong\u2019s gaze disappeared eventually. She regained some vigor in her eyes. (Yes, my cultivation realm is already higher than those at my age. This permits myself to fail a few more times.)\u201cQin Rong, think of the times when you were still young and how you have come so far. Have you always been complimented by your parents and teachers? Have the students around you been envious of you?\u201cQin Rong, you\u2019re a talent, a talent without controversy! You must believe in yourself. You\u2019re just pausing temporarily, taking a rest. Once you\u2019ve finished resting, you\u2019ll continue on your journey. You\u2019ll continue to be the talented Qin Rong who\u2019s been praised by parents and teachers and envied by students!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s words were heartfelt. Looking at her potential value, she was definitely worthy of being titled as a talent.Being a teacher, what Sun Mo couldn\u2019t stand watching was the fall of a talent. Hence, even if Qin Rong was Feng Zewen\u2019s student, he was still genuinely hoping that the girl could pull herself together.Qin Rong\u2019s eyes became brighter and her gaze was overflowing with confidence and pride.(Yes, I\u2019ve been covered with praises throughout my own journey. Isn\u2019t it just failing to break through to the spirit-refinement realm? What am I afraid of?\u201d\u201cQin Rong, look behind you, those who are inferior to you are almost chasing you. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re willing to be overtaken by them?\u201dAs he was finishing his words, Sun Mo started yelling. The entire classroom was filled with his echoes.At the same time, there were golden rays of light shining on Sun Mo\u2019s body.The scattering brilliant rays engulfed the entire classroom.\u201cPriceless Advice?\u201dThe students and teachers who were present were all dumbstruck.This was the great teacher halo!Those faculae sprinkled onto Qin Rong\u2019s body, and the area surrounding her body was dense with golden light rays. However, she hadn\u2019t even noticed this.She looked at Sun Mo, and there was only passion and determination in her eyes.\u201cNo, I\u2019m a talent. I will not let anyone overtake me!\u201dBang!After she finished her sentence, a puff of spirit qi exploded from her body. Then, the spirit qi from all directions came converging frantically.\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d\u201cBreakthrough? That\u2019s right. This is a breakthrough!\u201d\u201cOh my god, she\u2019s actually breaking through at this time?\u201dThe students were all in extreme shock.\u201cHow awesome, my fiance.\u201dAn Xinhui was a little startled. She didn\u2019t expect that Sun Mo would\u2019ve chosen this way of striking back. (Has he been computing this all along? Or was he just lucky to have done this by chance?)Lu Zhiruo grabbed onto Li Ziqi\u2019s clothes firmly. She was so nervous that she shut her big eyes, not daring to watch anymore.Feng Zewen\u2019s brows furrowed tightly.His current feelings were complicated. He was hoping that his student would breakthrough successfully but also hoped that she wouldn\u2019t.Because once she stepped into the spirit-refinement realm, it would all be Sun Mo\u2019s credit.However, after a few seconds, Feng Zewen tossed this thought aside. His eyes were now left with only worry and regret. \u201cI should have shown more concern for Qin Rong.\u201dSun Mo stood at the side with an unperturbed expression. He had done what he needed to do. It was now time to see the outcome.Qin Rong was a talent with high potential value. Even though she had continuously failed to break through, it also meant that her accumulation was sufficient now. What she was missing was just the right mental state.Spirit-refinement realm was named as such because it was about the tempering of one\u2019s will. One shouldn\u2019t be confused by external things and should have tenacious willpower and a powerful soul.Qin Rong had failed because she had been excessively worried about personal gains and losses. Now, she had been encouraged by Sun Mo\u2019s speech and had the assistance of \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019.At this moment, her will was at a full 10 and there wasn\u2019t any apprehension anymore.Bang! Bang! Bang!The spirit qi from around Qin Rong\u2019s body exploded and scattered. It started to blow up the dust on the ground, as well as everyone\u2019s hair and clothes.The entire classroom was in absolute silence, and everyone\u2019s gazes were fixated on Qin Rong.This young lady was just like a fresh flower in the summertime. At the age of fifteen, she had stepped into the spirit-refinement realm!\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded!\u201dQin Rong looked at Sun Mo while crying tears of joys. Then, she stood firm on both feet and bent her back in a deep bow. \u201cTeacher Sun, thank you!\u201dThe girl\u2019s voice flew out the window. It seemed just like a bird soaring without restraint between the blue sky and white clouds.Anyone could tell that Qin Rong\u2019s \u2018thank you\u2019 was overflowing with gratitude, respect, and even a slight tinge of worship.Looking at this scene, Feng Zewen, who originally seemed like a bulldog wanting to tear Sun Mo into shreds any time, had become a deflated ball. Now, he was like a rather decrepit person.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu(I\u2019ve lost!)(I\u2019ve lost through and through!)Qi Shengjia couldn\u2019t control the excitement in his heart anymore. He stood up and shouted.\u201cTeacher Sun, how formidable!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You were able to succeed because you\u2019re indeed a talent.\u201d Sun Mo praised.The smile on his face, coupled with the sunshine\u2019s warmth, was filled with approachability. It gave people a warm feeling in their hearts.Hearing this sentence, the students immediately developed a higher favorable impression toward Sun Mo.This female student called Qin Rong was able to step into the spirit-refinement realm because of Sun Mo\u2019s encouragement. It was because of the powerful effect of his \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019, but he didn\u2019t claim the credit for himself. Instead, he was praising Qin Rong\u2019s aptitude.Such encouragement could allow Qin Rong\u2019s confidence to increase greatly.\u201cThank you!\u201dQin Rong choked with emotions as she recalled her experiences through the past half a year.Every time she failed to breakthrough, the mixture of panic, disappointment, fear, and self-doubt would be aggravated. It felt like a piece of dark cloud enveloping over her head and wouldn\u2019t go away for the entire day.How Qin Rong hoped to find someone to spill her feelings!Now, the dark cloud had disappeared.Looking at Sun Mo\u2019s face that had distinct protrusion and how he was looking at herself with a gaze that was admiring a talent, Qin Rong felt proud and shy at the same time.\u201cTeacher Sun, thank you!\u201dQin Rong wiped her tears and bowed down once again. Then, she turned toward Feng Zewen and kneeled immediately. \u201cTeacher, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cEh? Why was she apologizing?\u201dA lot of students didn\u2019t understand.However, many teachers let out expressions of envy. What a good student Feng Zewen had!Qin Rong apologized because she had stepped into the spirit-refinement realm under the great teacher halo of Sun Mo. Toward Feng Zewen, this was considered a huge humiliation.As a disciple, one must never allow her teacher to be humiliated, so Qin Rong kneeled for an apology.\u201cGet up!\u201dFeng Zewen helped Qin Rong up, patted her shoulders, and said with an ashamed expression, \u201cIt\u2019s me who has not been giving you ample care and concern. If I had found out this problem earlier, you would have entered the spirit-refinement realm 3 months ago.\u201d\u201cTeacher!\u201dQin Rong covered her mouth in shock. She hadn\u2019t expected that Teacher Feng who had always been strict would have said these words.\u201cTeacher Sun, I\u2019ve lost!\u201dFeng Zewen looked toward Sun Mo. \u201cThank you!\u201dHwa!Hearing Feng Zewen\u2019s declaration, the entire audience was stunned. Especially those intern teachers, their faces instantly revealed priceless expressions.One must know that Feng Zewen was a 1-star great teacher, and what about Sun Mo? He had just been employed recently, and this was only his first public lecture.He had unexpectedly made a great teacher personally admit defeat in such a public setting. What an awesome achievement this was. If this was spread out, he could flaunt about it for several years.This was unexpected for Sun Mo. He thought that he would suffer tougher and crazier counterattacks from Feng Zewen, but he didn\u2019t expect that Feng Zewen would admit defeat so efficiently. What a magnanimous heart he had!Suddenly, Sun Mo didn\u2019t hate Feng Zewen as much. Also, his earlier preparations to use \u2018Pregnancy Imprint'[1], no, \u2018Soul Imprint\u2019, was of no use now.That was very good. He could leave it until next time and use it for an overkill.\u201cI\u2019ve only done an insignificant thing.\u201dSun Mo knew that he had to be more humble at such times.\u201cTeacher Sun, I hereby congratulate you beforehand for your future achievements. The few of you, let\u2019s go.\u201dFeng Zewen finished saying his words and called out for his students to leave the classroom. However, just as he was stepping out the door, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll pay the price since I\u2019ve lost the bet. I\u2019ll be sending 3 buckets of Liang Province grape brew to your office later on.\u201dFeng Zewen left and the lecture theater, which was filled with more than three hundred people, had quietened down.All the gazes were now fixated on Sun Mo, the new teacher who had made a 1-star great teacher admit his defeat.\u201cWhy is it not me who was standing there?\u201dMany intern teachers looked at Sun Mo and developed this thought. They were extremely envious of him. But soon after, such feelings turned into disappointment and inferiority. Even if they could stand on that spot, it was impossible for them to reach Sun Mo\u2019s level.He wasn\u2019t someone living off a woman. He was genuinely brimming with talent.\u201cI\u2019ve already said, for a woman like Headmaster An Xinhui, how could she have taken a fancy for a moron?\u201dLudi laughed at himself. What a pity, as Sun Mo\u2019s roommate, he had many opportunities to develop a closer relationship with him, but Ludi had never made use of them.Sigh, he didn\u2019t know if there was still time to make up for it now.Piak!Piak piak!Piak piak piak!Sounds of applause started to echo. From scattered claps to passionate claps, the sounds of applause filled up the entire classroom in an instant.\u2026At Gao Ben\u2019s public lecture.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? It was a fluctuating spirit qi just now, and now it is such noisy applause!\u201d\u201cWhat a huge commotion. This won\u2019t do, I must go and take a look.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go too! We\u2019ll go too!\u201dThe students couldn\u2019t continue sitting anymore. They started to bend their lower backs and evacuated from the back door of the classroom.When Gao Ben finished writing on the blackboard and turned his head over, he was immediately stunned.The entire classroom was left with only 4 students, and they were all his personal students.Because of the violent fluctuation of the spirit qi, many students had run out of his class and there had not been many left. However, after this burst of applause, the rest of the students were gone as well.\u201cF*ck!\u201dGao Ben knew that he had to maintain a teacher\u2019s demeanor and shouldn\u2019t get angry, but he couldn\u2019t bear with it.It was all ruined!His first public lecture was ruined!\u201cJust what was going on outside? How can the class environment in Central Province Academy be so terrible?\u201dGao Ben grumbled and suddenly regretted his choice of coming to this school.The 4 students looked at each other in dismay.Finally, a male student asked courageously, \u201cTeacher, there seems to be some situation going on outside, why don\u2019t we go and take a look? Perhaps we can be of some help!\u201d\u201cYou just want to go where the crowd is, don\u2019t you?\u201dGao Ben was spot on about the male student\u2019s intentions. \u201cContinue with the lesson!\u201dEven though he said it like this, Gao Ben was just acting in a fit of pique. His entire mind was filled with indignance and unwillingness; thus, his train of thought for the lesson had long since been cut off.He had just taken his first step in his teacher\u2019s career and had already sprained his foot. What the f*ck! Hold on, didn\u2019t he have 5 personal disciples?Gao Ben raised his head and ran his eyes through the classroom. He realized that there were only 4 of them.\u201cF*ck, where did Fu Chao go?\u201dGao Ben couldn\u2019t bear with this anymore and exploded. (I\u2019m your teacher, how can you not listen to my lesson? I must peel your skin off later!)\u2026The applause lasted for a long while without breaking.At this moment, many students had gathered outside the lecture theater of Sun Mo to watch the scene. The continuous successful breakthroughs of 2 students had caused two eruptions of fluctuating spirit qi, attracting a large number of spectators.Some students were inquiring, and after knowing what had happened, their faces filled with regret. Why didn\u2019t they come earlier to snatch a seat in the class?\u201cTeacher is so awesome! Teacher is so awesome!\u201dLu Zhiruo clapped her little hands excitedly and couldn\u2019t stop repeating this sentence.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +30, Friendly (368/1,000).\u201cThat was natural, I\u2019ve already guessed this outcome!\u201dLi Ziqi looked at Sun Mo and felt prouder of herself for choosing the right teacher.Ding!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +20, Friendly (176/1,000).Hearing the system\u2019s notification, Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help but turn his head to look at his 5 students. They were now seated in the first row and looking at him.Taking notice of Sun Mo\u2019s gaze, Tantai Yutang let out a smile. Xuanyuan Po still looked bored and was clapping his hands restlessly. Seeing his appearance, it seemed that he wanted to leave earlier to cultivate.When Jiang Leng saw that Sun Mo was looking over, he squeezed out a smile as well.Ding!Favorable impression points from Jiang Leng +5, Neutral (75/100).Sun Mo\u2019s eyelids were twitching. These 3 students of his were not easy to deal with.Tantai Yutang, this mental person, even though he was only fourteen years old, an ordinary person would never be able to guess his way of thinking. As for Xuanyuan Po who didn\u2019t contribute any favorable impression points, Sun Mo had already predicted it.He was a combat addict. Except for cultivation, combat, and fighting, he wasn\u2019t concerned about other things. But Jiang Leng, why was he so weird?(Why did you contribute 5 favorable impression points just because I looked at you? Why was it not because you were impressed with my brilliant performance of how I carried the entire atmosphere?)\u201cVice-headmaster Zhang, what do you think of Sun Mo\u2019s performance?\u201dAn Xinhui inquired.\u201cHumph!\u201dZhang Hanfu snorted coldly with an extremely ugly expression. Also, this Feng Zewen was indeed useless. He was even unable to deal with a newly employed teacher?Looking at Zhang Hanfu\u2019s appearance, An Xinhui only felt a thrill in her heart. Having dealt with resentment for more than half a year, she finally had an outlet.Ding!Favorable impression points from An Xinhui +10, Neutral (15/100).Having received the favorable impression points from his fiancee, Sun Mo pouted. Finally it wasn\u2019t just +1.The public lecture had not ended, and just as Sun Mo was about to say something, the data of + favorable impression points flooded his left eye, like a waterfall with streams of water flowing downward.\u201cCongratulations host, you\u2019ve received a total of +526 favorable impression points.\u201d\u201cThese favorable impression points are mostly because you\u2019ve helped the 2 students to break through and have been acknowledged by the students for your ability. At the same time, a small portion of teachers admire you and yielded ten over favorable impression points,\u201d the system explained.\u201cI\u2019m so outstanding and they only contributed over ten favorable impression points?\u201dSun Mo felt astonished.\u201cYou should be content. Teachers are prideful creatures, especially great teachers. They basically will not be convinced by anyone. Just look at Feng Zewen, even though he admitted defeat, did he yield any favorable impression points? Absolutely none!\u201dThe system scoffed.\u201cSun Mo, remember, even if you defeat one hundred great teachers, you may not even receive admiration from one great teacher in your lifetime.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe this!\u201dSun Mo was unhappy and just as he spoke those 3 words, the system\u2019s notification rang.Ding!\u201cMission announcement: please obtain a teacher\u2019s admiration from the bottom of his heart within a year. You\u2019ll be rewarded with a diamond treasure chest. If you fail, you\u2019ll be given a cruel punishment.\u201d\u201cMust you be so ruthless?\u201dSun Mo was speechless. But seeing that the prize was a diamond treasure chest, he knew that the system wasn\u2019t lying. In order to receive admiration from a teacher, it was indeed difficult.Actually, Sun Mo knew that the system was not wrong. Gu Xiuxun didn\u2019t give any favorable impression points and neither did Jin Mujie.\u201cIf I\u2019m truly ruthless, I\u2019ll make you obtain the admiration of a great teacher.\u201dThe system snorted coldly. (I was already saving some face for you.)\u201cThis won\u2019t do. I need to think of some happy things, or else, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help but beat you up.\u201dSun Mo breathed in deeply.His favorable impression points had surpassed 2,000, how great! It felt as though he was a local wealthy man now. He planned to visit the shopping store to purchase a Starmoon Fruit later.However, before that, he still had something to say.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo returned to the rostrum and swept his gaze across everyone present.\u201cWho else still harbors suspicions toward me? You can now stand up and ask your question.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s voice caused the noisy classroom to quieten down instantly.[1] Raws for the two terms are \u4e00\u53d1\u5165\u5b55, \u4e00\u53d1\u5165\u9b42.

Only Gu Xiuxun and the other three would be able to compete against him.No, it was three of them and not four. It was because Qin Fen, who had graduated from Jixia Learning Palace, had already lost.Gu Xiuxun, being watched by everyone, frowned. She thought to herself, \u201cSun Mo, that\u2019s enough. Can\u2019t you save some face for the rest?\u201dSun Mo was now doing very well. Even people who weren\u2019t that clever should know that they should keep their distance from his attacks.Seeing that Gu Xiuxun didn\u2019t show any reaction, the intern teachers then looked toward the senior teachers.The senior teachers clapped, ignoring these people\u2019s gazes.Even though teachers from Zhang Hanfu\u2019s faction weren\u2019t pleased with Sun Mo, they understood that this wasn\u2019t a time for them to create trouble. Moreover, it seemed that Sun Mo had some capabilities. If they attempted to create trouble without any planning in advance, they might end up to be the ones suffering.Sun Mo smiled and looked toward Zhang Hanfu. \u201cVice-headmaster Zhang, you\u2019ve lowered your stance and came to my public lecture. Aren\u2019t you going to ask a few questions?\u201dThe students knew nothing about the conflict between the school\u2019s management, but the senior teachers did.Hearing Sun Mo\u2019s question, their eyes almost popped out. This was even more astonishing than the fact that Sun Mo had grasped two great teacher halos.\u201cHe is too arrogant!\u201dJiang Yongnian\u2019s lips twitched.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Zhang Hanfu is going to hate him to death. There won\u2019t be any way to salvage their relationship.\u201dZhou Shanyi sighed.He detested such conflicts the most. Couldn\u2019t everyone just focus on teaching and get along harmoniously?Even though Sun Mo looked as if he was asking for guidance, he was in fact openly sneering at Zhang Hanfu. (Weren\u2019t you here to see me make a fool of myself?)(You can\u2019t laugh now, right?)Kacha!Zhang Hanfu shattered the chair\u2019s handle. (How dare this bastard sneer at me?)\u201cYou don\u2019t have questions? I didn\u2019t expect that you\u2019d be so pleased with me!\u201dSun Mo teased.Zhou Lin couldn\u2019t help but smile after seeing Zhang Hanfu stumbled. However, at the thought of how this was caused by Sun Mo, he felt a little displeased.\u201cSun Mo, you\u2019re already so good when you\u2019ve just become an official teacher. I believe that within a year, you\u2019ll become the number one great teacher in Jinling. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201dAfter saying that, Zhang Hanfu brushed his sleeves to the side and left.Hearing Vice-headmaster Zhang\u2019s praise for Sun Mo, many naive intern teachers wore envious gazes.Only the senior teachers knew that Sun Mo had gotten into big trouble.Clank! Clank! Clank!The bell rang. It was time for the class to end.\u201cAlright, today\u2019s public lecture will end here. Thanks to all the teachers and students who have come to listen to my class.\u201dSun Mo displayed the smile he had practiced repeatedly, appearing very amicable.\u201cI\u2019ll start teaching officially from next Monday. Anyone interested can come to the class. Thank you!\u201dClap clap clap!A round of applause rang out, not out of courtesy, but because they were truly satisfied with this public lecture.\u201cAll the best, Teacher Sun!\u201d\u201cTeacher Sun, I have a question. Can I ask for your guidance?\u201d\u201cTeacher Sun, my learning condition hasn\u2019t been good lately. Can you use \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019 to give me some encouragement?\u201dTo the students who didn\u2019t have any teachers, if they wished to have their questions resolved and gain improvement, they\u2019d have to grab hold of all chances possible. Therefore, when Sun Mo announced that the class had ended, they immediately came crowding over.There was only a ten minutes break between classes, so Sun Mo could only answer three questions at most.\u201cDon\u2019t squeeze. Queue up over here. Otherwise, given how messy you guys are, no one will be able to get any answers.\u201dLi Ziqi immediately jumped out to maintain order.The students glanced at Li Ziqi and didn\u2019t pay her any heed.\u201cBattle freak\u2026 urgh.\u201dAfter Li Ziqi said that, she immediately said, \u201cXuanyuan Po, quickly come to help maintain the order!\u201d\u201cCan I beat people up?\u201dXuanyuan Po\u2019s eyes lit up, and he grabbed onto his spear.\u201cNo!\u201d Li Ziqi waved her hand helplessly. \u201cForget it, you don\u2019t have to come.\u201dLi Ziqi looked around.Forget about Tantai Yutang. He was holding onto a handkerchief and covering his mouth, coughing incessantly. He looked as if he was going to die at any moment. Jiang Leng emitted an icy-cold aura that seemed to say for all living humans to get lost. He gave off the feeling as if he was a corpse that had just been dug out from the snow.As for Lu Zhiruo, what use did she have other than having a big bust?\u201cAlright everyone, please leave the classroom and don\u2019t affect the next teacher\u2019s class. I\u2019m the Central Province Academy\u2019s teacher now, so you guys can come to ask me questions at any time.\u201dSun Mo was unable to move. Many students continued to speak up next to him. The situation was a mess, and he wasn\u2019t able to give anyone any guidance at all.The intern teachers were leaving the lecture theater when they saw this scene. They felt so envious that it was as if they were going to drool.\u201cI also want to be surrounded by so many students asking me for my guidance!\u201d\u201cBy the way, Ludi, I remember that you also graduated from Songyang Academy, right? You\u2019re Sun Mo\u2019s schoolmate. Do you know what is with his Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands?\u201dA slightly ugly person asked curiously. He had just asked this question when the intern teachers in the vicinity all turned their heads immediately, their eyes gleaming as they looked toward Ludi.Ludi was given a shock and quickly explained, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t hear about it in the past!\u201d\u201cHey, if you have any insider news, then share it with everyone! Don\u2019t keep it to yourself!\u201dThe ugly guy hooked his arm around Ludi\u2019s shoulder.\u201cI really don\u2019t know!\u201dLudi seemed to be on the verge of tearing up. He was worried that everyone would think of him as a selfish person. \u201cI\u2019m not close with Sun Mo!\u201dSeeing that Ludi really didn\u2019t know anything, the other intern teachers immediately ignored him as if he was a piece of used dish towel. However, the conversation continued in their smaller circles.\u201cSun Mo was able to find out how many times that Qin Rong had failed to break through to the next level just by touching her muscles. That\u2019s too amazing!\u201d\u201cHe was even able to accurately tell the time she had failed!\u201d\u201cThe Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands? This name has a dominant air to it!\u201d\u201cCan Sun Mo\u2019s hands be considered God Hands?\u201dIn the world of great teachers, most of them would rely on their experience and judgment to pick students. There\u2019d also be an observation period of several months. However, extremely few great teachers could rely on their hands to touch a student and find out their aptitude.In the world of great teachers, the hands of these rare number of great teachers had a public recognition of being called the \u2018God Hands\u2019.Thinking that Sun Mo could possibly possess the God Hands, everyone was immediately filled with envy.Zhou Lin saw An Xinhui standing in the corridors and asked, \u201cEldest Miss, you aren\u2019t leaving yet?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m waiting for Sun Mo!\u201dAn Xinhui looked at her female assistant, wanting to let her relationship with Sun Mo get better. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a meal together?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not hungry!\u201dZhou Lin rejected. \u201cI admit that Sun Mo\u2019s performance today is astonishing, but he is still far from being a good match for you or catching up to Liu Mubai. He can wait until he is steadily one notch above Gu Xiuxun, Gao Ben, and Zhang Lan!\u201dAfter saying that, Zhou Lin turned to leave.In her heart, she did recognize Sun Mo\u2019s performance. No teacher had displayed such an astonishing first showcase for the past ten years in the Central Province Academy.Liu Mubai\u2019s first public lecture had also been brilliant, but it was still not this spectacular.\u201cLittle Lin is too stubborn. There aren\u2019t many men in the entire Middle-Earth\u2019s nine provinces who can be a good match for you.\u201dJin Mujie shook her head.An Xinhui didn\u2019t wish to discuss this, so she diverted the conversation. \u201cHow many points do you give for Sun Mo\u2019s first showcase?\u201d\u201cFull marks, not a score less. I\u2019m not afraid that he\u2019d be proud!\u201dJin Mujie smiled.She was very satisfied with Sun Mo\u2019s performance. Whether it was his eloquence, adaptability, or skills, he had the full package. Hence, he was free and unconstrained on the rostrum.\u201cYou rate him really high!\u201dAn Xinhui was surprised. Being close friends with Jin Mujie, An Xinhui knew that she had high expectations when looking at other teachers.\u201cTo be honest, I feel that this isn\u2019t the first time he is on the rostrum. He seems to be familiar with it.\u201dJin Mujie couldn\u2019t understand. Even if a person had practiced multiple times in private, they wouldn\u2019t be able to produce such an effect. This meant that Sun Mo was born to be a teacher.Sun Mo left the lecture theater.Gu Xiuxun, who was answering a student\u2019s question, spoke quicker and after finishing up, she went and caught up to Sun Mo.\u201cTeacher Sun!\u201dGu Xiuxun called out. She was planning to treat Sun Mo to a meal.Sun Mo was An Xinhui\u2019s fianc\u00e9. This meant that they were allies from the same team and should work together to build up their relationship. Of course, it\u2019d be even better if they could have a talk about Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands.An Xinhui and Jin Mujie also walked over.\u201cHeadmaster An, Teacher Jin.\u201dGu Xiuxun greeted.\u201cHeadmaster An, Teacher Jin!\u201dSun Mo suddenly felt a little blinded. These three were all beautiful women, so he found it a little hard to take them on altogether!\u201cSun Mo, do you want to have a meal together?\u201dAs a 3-star great teacher, Jin Mujie was pressed for time and thus couldn\u2019t be bothered with the formalities. She went straight to the point.A hint of surprise flashed past Gu Xiuxun\u2019s eyes. To think that Jin Mujie would invite Sun Mo to a meal? How much admiration did she have for him?However, Gu Xiuxun was at a loss. It was a goner. Jin Mujie had beaten her to it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have time!\u201dSun Mo shrugged with his hands out.\u201cHuh?\u201dGu Xiuxun was stunned and almost shot out, \u2018Are you an idiot?\u2019 A 3-star great teacher had taken the initiative to invite him to a meal, but he had rejected it?Given Jin Mujie\u2019s status, she was the one who usually refused people\u2019s invitation. And these \u2018people\u2019 would tend to be influential characters.Jin Mujie was a little stunned as well.An Xinhui looked at Sun Mo in surprise. She suddenly felt like asking (What have you been through in Songyang Academy?)Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDo you guys have any other matters? If not then I\u2019ll be leaving!\u201dSun Mo was really busy. The petty system had given him a mission to draw 1,000 Spirit-Gathering Runes in a month. If he couldn\u2019t complete it, he would get punished and his skill\u2019s grade would drop. That was something that he relied on for a living, so how could he possibly have time to waste?The three beauties had met too many people who wanted to curry up to them. But now that they came across such a unique person like Sun Mo, they had no idea how they should react.\u201cOh my, this feeling is so strange!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - Generous RewardsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 90: Generous RewardsLordbluefire\u201cMy teacher is awesome!\u201dLi Ziqi, who was following behind, felt that Sun Mo was extremely impressive. He even dared to reject the invitation of a 3-star great teacher. One must know that if other teachers were in his place, even if they knew they had to eat dog shit, they would still accept the invitation. Moreover, they would be swallowing the dog shit with a smile on their faces.Ding!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +10. Current state: Friendly (186/1,000).Lu Zhiruo blinked. She didn\u2019t understand the ways of the world. Hence, she didn\u2019t feel that it was a problem that Sun Mo had rejected the invitation of another teacher for a meal.Jiang Leng lowered his head, not caring about this. Tantai Yutang placed his hands behind his head and was surveying the four people ahead with interest. He was speculating whether Sun Mo was using reverse-psychology or not.As for Xuanyuan Po?The combat addict had a brain full of muscles. Hence, he spoke very directly.\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m going to look for a fight!\u201dAfter speaking, Xuanyuan Po didn\u2019t wait for Sun Mo to reply and left directly.Upon hearing this, Li Ziqi couldn\u2019t help but rub her glabella. Out of Sun Mo\u2019s five personal disciples, Xuanyuan Po was the one with the highest publicly acknowledged talent. However, his IQ was clearly not too high.(Before a headmaster, a 3-star great teacher, and two teachers, you actually say that you are going to fight someone? Do you treat the school\u2019s rules as non-existent? Can\u2019t you be more tactful and say you are going for a spar instead?)\u201c\u2026\u201dSun Mo was speechless. (How do you want me to reply to this?)Given Sun Mo\u2019s understanding of Xuanyuan Po, if he told him not to fight, Xuanyuan Po wouldn\u2019t listen. And if he tried to convince him and was rejected before so many people, Sun Mo would only be embarrassed.However, if he didn\u2019t say anything, given that the headmaster and other teachers were present, others might doubt his teaching attitude. Could it be that when a student said he was going to fight, the teacher didn\u2019t even want to care about it?As expected, the gazes of the three beauties all landed on Sun Mo. They were waiting for his response.This was especially so for Gu Xiuxun. She had a look on her face like she was waiting to watch a good show.\u201cGo and find someone in the senior years to fight then.\u201d Sun Mo\u2019s expression was calm. \u201cAlso, I\u2019ll formally start my lesson tomorrow morning. Gather at the entrance of the teaching building by 8 a.m.\u201d\u201cI will definitely not find people from the lower years. I\u2019m afraid I might beat them to death.\u201dXuanyuan Po answered as though it was proper and a matter of course.A few senior students heard this when they passed by. They involuntarily frowned and turned their heads to look at Xuanyuan Po. There was no need to ask any questions. This young man must be a student that recently joined them. This was why he didn\u2019t know the immensity of the heavens and earth.There would always be genius students who thought very highly of themselves every year. These students would then challenge the seniors and after being taught a lesson, only then did they realize that they weren\u2019t geniuses. They were just cabbages.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more going on, you guys can take your leave!\u201dSun Mo instructed his other students.Li Ziqi and Lu Zhiruo didn\u2019t move, but Tantai Yutang and Jiang Leng immediately departed.\u201cIf you guys have nothing else to talk about, I\u2019m leaving now!\u201dSun Mo subconsciously raised his hand and looked at his watch. Sadly, his wrist was empty. He no longer had the mechanical watch he had bought using his monthly salary.\u201cTeacher!\u201dLi Ziqi quietly tugged on Sun Mo\u2019s sleeves. She then smiled as she praised, \u201cTeacher Jin Mujie is a 3-star teacher. She is very famous in Jinling City.\u201dLi Ziqi\u2019s meaning was very simple. Jin Mujie was one of the \u2018big bosses\u2019 in the Central Province Academy. If Sun Mo could forge a good relationship with her and she was willing to guide him, his teaching career would be much smoother.Upon seeing this scene, Gu Xiuxun felt somewhat envious. Li Ziqi truly had a pure heart and spirit. On the surface, she appeared to be praising Jin Mujie, but in actuality, she was reminding Sun Mo not to neglect or slight Jin Mujie.\u201cI wonder why Li Ziqi is so determined to take Sun Mo as her teacher?\u201dWhen she thought of Li Ziqi\u2019s background, the envy in Gu Xiuxun\u2019s heart became envy. However, she smiled shortly after. Li Ziqi was really good, but it wasn\u2019t so easy to be her teacher.At the very least, Li Ziqi\u2019s aunt wouldn\u2019t agree so easily.No man had ever rejected Jin Mujie before. Hence, she was a bit at a loss of what to do after the rejection. She decided to remain silent.She invited Sun Mo for a meal because other than admiring his performance today, she also planned to get him to massage her. She would definitely feel embarrassed to ask him directly; hence, she planned to ask in passing when they were having a meal. Sadly, there was no chance to do that now.An Xinhui wanted to warn Sun Mo to be careful of Zhang Hanfu. That fellow had a narrow heart. Now that he had suffered such a huge disadvantage today, Zhang Hanfu definitely wouldn\u2019t let things slide.However, she couldn\u2019t say this in front of the teachers and students present. Hence, she also chose to remain silent.Gu Xiuxun had waited for Feng Zewen to make things difficult for Sun Mo before she stepped out to showcase her brilliance. But she didn\u2019t expect Sun Mo\u2019s performance to be so fascinating. There was basically no chance for her to stand up.\u201cEven Jin Mujie was rejected. If I was the one who asked, I\u2019m afraid I would be rejected as well!\u201dGu Xiuxun decided to invite Sun Mo for a meal another time. However, she truly wished to know what sort of cultivation art the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands is.Each of these three women had different thoughts in their minds. Before they could think of what to reply, they already saw Sun Mo leaving directly. He really left with no hesitation at all.Lu Zhiruo immediately followed him.\u201cEh?\u201dGu Xiuxun was stunned. (Do you have to leave so directly? )\u201cTeacher!\u201dAfter Li Ziqi bowed to An Xinhui and the two others, she also followed after Sun Mo.\u201cXinhui, your fiance is truly quite capable!\u201dJin Mujie stared at Sun Mo\u2019s back. When she thought about his past performances, it seemed that the Central Province Academy would welcome a huge wave of impact this year.\u2026The gentle wind blew at the chinese parasol tree, causing the tree\u2019s shadow on the ground to sway a little.\u201cSystem, my performance is still acceptable, right?\u201dSun Mo asked from the bottom of his heart.\u201cExtremely well done!\u201dAfter the system replied, the sound of a system notification rang out.Ding!\u201cCongratulations, you have perfectly handled the students and teachers who tried to make things difficult for you during your first public lecture. Your debut is beautiful. Reward: 1x golden treasure chest.\u201dDing!\u201cCongratulations to you for obtaining victory against Feng Zewen. Reward: 1x silver treasure chest.\u201dFirstly, a radiant golden treasure chest appeared before him. After that, a glorious silver treasure chest followed. Their glow was so bright that it was sufficient to dazzle his eyes.The system notification was pleasing to the ear, but Sun Mo actually frowned instead.\u201cSomething is wrong. Since my debut is perfect, why am I not getting a diamond treasure chest?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m afraid you might be too proud after this!\u201d the system replied in a candid manner.Instantly, ten thousand f*** your mom galloped across Sun Mo\u2019s heart. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that two of his students were still following after him and that he was always a man that minded his image before his students, he would definitely unleash a string of curse words.In addition to the black-iron treasure chest that he had obtained from accumulating 1,000 favorable impression points, Sun Mo had three treasure chests now.Now that he had high-tier treasure chests, would top-tier prizes still be far away?Hence, Sun Mo lifted his hand and stroked Lu Zhiruo\u2019s hair before stating the word \u2018open!\u2019 in his heart.The golden treasure chest unlocked.\u201cDAMN!\u201dSun Mo truly couldn\u2019t endure it anymore. \u201cThe chest I wanted to open is the black-iron one!\u2019In the past, when Sun Mo played games, he would always open the treasure chest starting from the lowest-tier. He would only open the best treasure chests after all his bad luck was used up on the lousy treasure chests.Although this was quite superstitious, Sun Mo felt that it was pretty useful. Even if it wasn\u2019t really useful in reality, it was a comfort to him psychologically. But now, the system had directly opened up the most valuable golden treasure chest.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know mind reading!\u201d the system explained.Sun Mo\u2019s heart was instantly filled with a flood of curse words.\u201cPlease mind your attitude. The system is very strict. If you continue to curse at the system, you will be given a punishment!\u201d the system warned.\u201cSystem, didn\u2019t you say that you didn\u2019t know mind reading?\u201dNow, Sun Mo understood that this fellow was truly narrow-minded.The golden glow faded, leaving behind a tattered map. From the color of the map, Sun Mo could tell that it was an ancient map.Ding!\u201cCongratulations, you have obtained a fragmented map (\u2155). This map shows a certain terrain. If you want to see everything clearly, please piece together all five fragments.\u201dThe material of the map was beast skin, and it had a good tactile feel to it. But as for the contents of the map, it was blurry and unclear.\u201cDoes it take itself to be like dragon balls?\u201d (ref: anime Dragonball)Sun Mo was depressed.In the past, he had also drawn a fragmented map. Now, he had a total of two pieces. However, things like this that depended on chance weren\u2019t too reliable. Who knew when he would finally get the third piece?The main point was that even if he obtained all five pieces of the map, what if that map showed a location that was impossible for him to reach? Or if the danger level was too high? What should he do then?Honestly speaking, Sun Mo was somewhat disappointed that he had obtained a fragmented map piece from a golden treasure chest. Hence, this time around, he placed his hand fixedly on Lu Zhiruo\u2019s head.\u201cMn?\u201dThe papaya girl inclined her head as she stared at Sun Mo in puzzlement.(I want to open the black-iron treasure chest now, don\u2019t get it wrong!) Sun Mo warned the system.The black-iron treasure chest clicked open, revealing a dark glow. When the glow vanished, a fruit the size of a walnut remained.This fruit was silvery white on the surface. On the top half of it, there were pictures of stars, and on the other side, there was a picture of a bright crescent moon. The fruit silently floated before his eyes, shining brightly with light.Ding!\u201cCongratulations on obtaining 1x Starmoon Fruit. This fruit can draw in the essence of the stars and moon, and it only matures after 100 years. After consuming it, you can make use of astral lunar force to cleanse your body, purify your blood, and force out the impurities in them. After that, your blood will contain the pure energy of astral lunar force.\u201d\u201cThis fruit is a top-tier natural spirit medicine that cultivators at the blood-ignition realm need the most!\u201d the system explained.Natural spirit medicine referred to items with medicinal effects that grew naturally in the world instead of being grown by humans. For spirit medicine like this, not only was the effect strong, but the side effects it caused the body would be minimal as well.\u201cHow beautiful!\u201dSun Mo was happy. He recalled seeing the starmoon fruit being sold in the merchant store for 1,000 points per piece.He decided to try it. If the effect was good, he could buy one from the store again. In any case, right now he had a total of over 2,000 favorable impression points. He could afford to spend a little.When the host provided an act of guidance to a target and caused the target to generate goodwill, feelings of being impressed, awe, worship, or amiability, the host would be able to gain favorable impression points.Favorable impression points could be treated as a type of currency to be used in the system\u2019s merchant store to buy any item in there. This included but was not limited to skill books, various cultivation arts, maps, medicine, weapons, pets, etc.At the same time, as a host gained more and more favorable impression points from the same target, the relationship between them would gradually deepen.This relationship was known as the prestige connection and could be ranked like this from the lowest to the highest: indifferent, neutral, friendly, respect, reverence, and worship based on the number of favorable points.Sun Mo asked the system before about what would happen when the prestige connection between two people reached the worship level? The system didn\u2019t reply, but Sun Mo felt that there would surely be a huge benefit to it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMn?\u201dSeeing Sun Mo touch Lu Zhiruo\u2019s head again, Li Ziqi felt a little unhappy as her lips pursed up.Sun Mo naturally saw Li Ziqi\u2019s reaction. However, he couldn\u2019t stretch his hand out to pat her head now.There was no solution to this as he still had a silver treasure chest that had yet to be opened. (You are flat-chested, if I come in contact with you, my luck will suffer.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - An Upgrade in Combat StrengthPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 91: An Upgrade in Combat StrengthLordbluefireSun Mo felt that he had profited a little seeing that he had obtained a starmoon fruit from the black-iron treasure chest.Next, it would be the third chest.The silver treasure chest glowed brilliantly. After it was opened, even before the light faded away, Sun Mo could already see a bronze-colored object within the glow.That was a time emblem.Ding!\u201cCongratulations on obtaining 1x time emblem. After using it, it can allow one of your skills to gain 10 years of experience, swiftly upgrading your proficiency of the skill to another level.\u201dThe system congratulated him.The material of the time emblem was a type of jadestone. It glowed with a bronze light and looked extremely like a mahjong tile. The word \u2018ten\u2019 was carved into it.Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help but whistle. He then patted Lu Zhiruo\u2019s head again.Truly, majestic breasts could allow him to increase his luck.\u201cUndoubtedly, there\u2019s no one else but her that can be my lucky star.\u201dSun Mo was very happy. This was the item he wanted the most.Humans were afraid of being famous while pigs were afraid of being robust. This was a logic that was passed down since ancient times. Today, for his first public lecture, it could be said that Sun Mo was completely in the limelight. However, this also brought him huge concealed danger.Leaving aside Zhang Hanfu\u2019s hostility, those random intern teachers would also begin to treat him like an enemy due to their envy. There was an 80% to 90% chance that they might personally seek him out to challenge him.What should intern teachers do if they wished to move up the ladder? Naturally, they had to find a stepping stone!The current Sun Mo was the most famous and sturdy stepping stone. As long as they could step on him, not only would they be able to shoot to fame in a single battle, but they could gain Zhang Hanfu\u2019s admiration as well. This was killing two birds with one stone.Hence, Sun Mo reckoned that there would surely be intern teachers coming to find trouble for him. It was extremely urgent for him to raise his strength now.It was very tough if one wanted to be a teacher. However, it was even tougher if one wanted to be a great teacher!Other than possessing strong cultivation base and strength, they also had to spend a huge amount of time on their side occupations. From this, one could already know how much effort great teachers had to put in.Sun Mo\u2019s cultivation realm was considered below average among this batch of intern teachers. With regard to combat strength, he was sorely insufficient.One must know that the art he had cultivated in the past was the Overflow Rain Sword.This was an extremely wide-spread and general cultivation art. When facing against intern teachers of average standards, he could still persist for over ten moves or might occasionally win due to luck. But if he used the Overflow Rain Sword against the honor student of the Myriad Daos Academy, Gu Xiuxun, or Gao Ben of the Westshore Military School of Liang Province, he would definitely be defeated.The Grand Universe Formless Divine Art was a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art. Although its main purpose was for the user to imitate the various cultivation arts to train students, allowing them to learn the plus points and negative points of each cultivation art, it was still considered somewhat powerful with regards to combat prowess.After all, it could imitate all sorts of cultivation arts and achieve the form and spirit of them. These imitations couldn\u2019t be considered one\u2019s own strength, but it could allow the user to win via a surprise move. Hence, it was sufficient.Also, this was merely the basic ability of the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art. One could train the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art to an even higher level. For example, at the fifth-level, one could use the opponent\u2019s moves against them completely.This meant that all the attacks launched by the enemy would be countered perfectly with the exact same technique.Upon thinking of this, Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help but feel that this was very cool. He wanted nothing more than to immediately raise his Grand Universe Formless Divine Art to the fifth-level.However, he had a puzzling question. The father of \u2018Sun Mo\u2019 was a genius of the Central Province Academy and was put in high regard by the old headmaster. If not, the old headmaster wouldn\u2019t have betrothed his daughter An Xinhui to \u2018Sun Mo\u2019.By logic, such a genius would at the very least leave behind some ultimate techniques and skills for his own son, right? Even if the techniques and skills were not at the saint-tier, it would at least be at the heaven-tier, correct?Sun Mo couldn\u2019t understand it. Hence, he temporarily treated it as the father of his original-self in this world simply died too early and couldn\u2019t leave behind his will.When the Sorrowless Lake came into vision, Sun Mo\u2019s steps suddenly halted. He glanced at the two girls. \u201cYou girls can go and play. I have something on and I have to leave first.\u201cWhat thing?\u201dLi Ziqi blinked her large eyes, feeling curious.\u201cSecret!\u201dAfter Sun Mo finished speaking, he turned and walked away.\u201cAwu!\u201dLu Zhiruo subconsciously stretched out her hands to catch the front part of Sun Mo\u2019s shirt. She felt a little disappointed and scared.In this unfamiliar campus, the papaya girl would only feel a sense of security by following Sun Mo.\u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll bring you to tour the campus!\u201dLi Ziqi no longer disturbed Sun Mo. She went to hold Lu Zhiruo\u2019s hands instead.Everyone required a little personal time. As long as Teacher Sun didn\u2019t become a lackey, there wouldn\u2019t be any problems. If not, she herself would definitely stop him. After all, being a lackey of someone meant that there would be no future.\u201cYou are also a freshman, right?\u201d asked Lu ZhiruoShe gazed at Li Ziqi in puzzlement. The implicit assertion was very simple. (You are a freshman too, why would you be familiar with the campus? Don\u2019t treat me like a fool.)\u201cI came here quite a few times before!\u201dLi Ziqi casually weaved an excuse.\u201cEh?\u201dLu Zhiruo started. After that, she began nodding. \u201cI see!\u201d\u201cYou actually believed it?\u201dLi Ziqi was speechless. Staring at the innocent Lu Zhiruo that seemed like a harmless bunny, she felt that it was essential to properly teach her. If not, her junior martial sister, who didn\u2019t know how sinister the world could be, might easily be cheated away by a big grey wolf.After becoming a teacher, Sun Mo could then use many facilities in the school that were reserved for teachers.For example, the cultivation chambers. There were those constructed from stones, from metals, and even woods. Regardless of which type, they all boasted a certain quality \u2013 sturdiness.After Sun Mo flashed out his teacher\u2019s badge to the administrator, he entered a cultivation chamber that was constructed from granite. After doing a check, he took out his time emblem.He then crushed it immediately with no hesitation.Pak!A bronze light immediately shot forth. The light vanished unceasingly, appearing as though it was drawn in by a magnet as the light motes flew into Sun Mo\u2019s body. This caused him to be surrounded by a greenish glow.\u201cSystem, can you change the color settings?\u201dSun Mo asked. Although he had experienced it once before, he had no way to accept this happening again.The green color was a color that no men would endure. Even an absolute pretty boy wouldn\u2019t be able to!\u201cIf one wants to live life well, one has to wear a little green on the head! (being cuckold).\u201d the system candidly replied again.\u201cF*** your mom!\u201dSun Mo couldn\u2019t control it. However, his body began heating up a moment later as though he was soaked in the hot springs. Countless scenes flooded his mind.Time was like an arrow. It was like ten years had passed.Ding!\u201cCongratulations, your proficiency of the \u2018Invulnerable Golden Body\u2019 of the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art has been upgraded to the grandmaster level. The proficiency of \u2018Copy\u2019 of the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art has reached the expert level. Please continue to work hard.\u201dThe system\u2019s voice was as calm as ever.Sun Mo pulled out the wooden blade and brandished it casually as insights rose in his mind.This was the secret art gained from the third level of the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art.As to what \u2018copy\u2019 meant, it meant that even if Sun Mo didn\u2019t know the moves of his opponent, he would be able to perfectly copy them after seeing it once. However, the third level only allowed him to copy the \u2018form\u2019 of his opponent\u2019s moves.If he met some experienced opponents, the difference between them would be immediately showcased. The opponent would be able to tell that Sun Mo\u2019s moves were fake. However, if he reached the fourth level \u2018Divine Intent\u2019, his copied moves would have both the form and spirit within it.With both form and spirit combining together, even the original owner of the moves wouldn\u2019t be able to sense any difference.Although Sun Mo managed to learn the third level of the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art using the time emblem, Sun Mo didn\u2019t dare to feel complacent and underestimate others. Instead, he began to practice his cultivation art again and again.Through repeated practice, Sun Mo\u2019s proficiency with this cultivation art rose to another level.One couldn\u2019t help but say that the person who had created this cultivation art was truly a monstrous genius. And for those who wanted to learn this art, they must similarly be overflowing with talent.There was no need to mention anything much about the first two levels. However, for the third level, \u2018copy\u2019, one needed a high level of judgment. If one wasn\u2019t able to track and anticipate each detail of the opponent\u2019s move, they wouldn\u2019t be able to unleash it.When Sun Mo executed \u2018copy\u2019, he would feel a warm current in his eyes.\u00a0At this moment, the entire world seemed to slow down as things became clearer.Motes of dust would become larger, slowly floating in the air. If a mosquito flew past, Sun Mo would be able to see how many times it was flapping its wings.The world would only return to normal after he stopped using \u2018copy\u2019.\u201cWhat a novel feeling!\u201dSun Mo praised while feeling a myriad of emotions in his heart. If he didn\u2019t have the time emblem and wanted to reach the third level and learn \u2018copy\u2019, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it unless he devoted one or two years into cultivating.He shook his head and cast away these distracting thoughts. He then executed the Invulnerable Golden Body and some faint golden patterns appeared on his skin.These patterns caused him to appear holy and imposing. After that, he executed \u2018copy\u2019 again to be more proficient with the skill.Sun Mo wasn\u2019t in a hurry to eat the starmoon fruit. He was prepared to head back and do some research to find out what exactly did the blood-ignition realm encompass.After all, this was Sun Mo\u2019s first time trying to break through. As someone who liked to be prepared before taking any actions, he didn\u2019t want any accidents to occur.\u2026\u201cSun Mo, I definitely won\u2019t let you have an easy life!\u201dGao Ben had a sinister look on his face. He pushed open his dorm\u2019s door but was soon startled after that.His dorm, which was for four people to stay in, now suddenly had eight people in it. These people were chatting idly and when they saw that Gao Ben had returned, they immediately stood up.\u201cTeacher Gao, congratulations!\u201d\u201cHow do you feel after your first public lecture?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so envious of you. I wonder when we will be able to officially join the faculty?\u201dThey were all intern teachers, and they were speaking up one after another.Compared to Qin Fen who had his eyes in the sky and looked down on everyone, Gao Ben was more down to earth and had better social connections.Gao Ben would usually be able to joke around with these people. But today he truly had no mood to do so.\u201cTea\u2026teacher Gao, all of us pooled together some money and wished to invite you to the Drunken Immortal Inn for a meal to celebrate your first lecture,\u201d said a slightly ugly-looking intern teacher. He was a dorm mate of Gao Ben.After he finished speaking, envy rose in his heart. In the past, everyone could call each other by their names. Even if they added the word \u2018teacher\u2019 in front, it would just be a joke. It was because only official teachers had the qualifications to add the honorific to their names.Now, they couldn\u2019t refer to Gao Ben by his name directly. They either had to call him Brother Gao or Teacher Gao. However, as intern teachers, everyone would naturally prefer others calling them with the honorific \u2018teacher\u2019.\u201cI\u2019m not free!\u201dUpon hearing the words \u2018first lecture\u2019, Gao Ben\u2019s face turned black as he rejected it directly. He walked to his bed and lay down before covering his head with his blanket.Everyone felt somewhat awkward as all of them stared at the ugly-looking intern teacher.\u201cTeacher Gao, give us some face. Everyone only wishes to celebrate with you. Besides, we also pooled our money and prepared a huge gift to congratulate you on officially becoming a teacher. You will definitely like the gift!\u201dThe ugly intern teacher issued an invitation again.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTeacher Gao, how many students came today? Are the seats fully filled?\u201d\u201cFully filled? You are looking down on Teacher Gao, right? There are definitely students crowding outside the lecture theater as well!\u201d\u201cIn any case, there must be a lot of people. How many of the school leaders went? Did Headmaster An Xinhui show up?\u201dThe intern teachers continued rumbling as their words of congratulations flooded forth like the words didn\u2019t cost money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Moreover, because they had had to prepare to give Gao Ben a gift, none of them had gone to the teaching building to attend the lectures personally.In any case, from their points of view, Gao Ben who was from the Westshore Military School would definitely not screw things up.\u201cShut up!\u201dGao Ben\u2019s roar drifted out from underneath his blanket. His voice felt somewhat heavy and depressed.The intern teachers here were all stunned, and they cast mutual glances at each other. What was going on with Gao Ben? It seemed that he wasn\u2019t in a good mood?\u201cTeacher Gao, everyone only wants to celebrate for you. Our kind intentions\u2026\u201dThe ugly intern teacher couldn\u2019t even finish his sentence before he was interrupted by Gao Ben.\u201cI told you to shut up!\u201dGao Ben lifted the blanket and glared at the ugly intern teacher. \u201cScram!\u201dSilence descended in the dorm. All the intern teachers had stunned looks on their faces, not knowing what they had done wrong. After that, they could only leave the dorm with indignance rising in their hearts.\u201cEveryone, let\u2019s disperse!\u201dThe ugly intern teacher spoke in a low voice.Everyone didn\u2019t dare to stay for long and began to scatter like the birds and bees.Gao Ben\u2019s appearance was too terrifying. His eyes were bloodshot and his expression was malevolent like he wanted to tear them into pieces.Staring at his dorm that was emptied out, Gao Ben couldn\u2019t endure it anymore and chaotically smashed the things in the dorm.(It\u2019s finished!)(It\u2019s completely finished!)Originally, he had been wildly ambitious and wanted to achieve a good showing. However, the first step of his teaching career had caused him to trip and fall. No, this wasn\u2019t just a simple trip. It was more like his leg had been directly broken by Sun Mo.Out of the four new teachers\u2026He was the one with the lowest number of attendees. In fact, even one of his personal disciples had run off to Sun Mo\u2019s lecture. How preposterous.\u201cSun Mo, if I don\u2019t trample you underneath my feet within three months, I will follow your surname!\u201dGao Ben swore as a plan appeared in his mind.The ugly intern teacher and his group soon learned of the reason for Gao Ben\u2019s rage after they had left. So it turned out that Gao Ben\u2019s first lecture was a complete failure.Only four students had attended it. Although this number wasn\u2019t the lowest in the history of the school, there was no doubt it was ranked at the bottom.As for Sun Mo, his lecture had been packed to the brim. The capacity of the lecture theater was just 300. Not only was it full, but some students, who wanted to listen to Sun Mo\u2019s lecture, had even gathered in the corridor outside the lecture theater.This number had broken the hundred-year-record of the Central Province Academy. As for the real number of attendees?There was no way to keep count.\u2026On the way back to his dorm, Zhou Xu excitedly jabbered on and on.\u201cToo awesome! Teacher Sun\u2019s Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands is simply too awesome. Actually, I feel that it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to call his hands God Hands.\u201dIn Zhou Xu\u2019s heart, there was only endless regret.If Zhou Xu had immediately gotten his father to bring a gift and paid a visit to Sun Mo after Sun Mo had performed his massage technique on him, he would already be considered as having a good relationship with Sun Mo. But now, things were different. They couldn\u2019t even be considered acquaintances. At most, they had only met each other once.\u201cSigh, I\u2019m all to blame!\u201dZhou Xu was so depressed that he could cough out blood. In the end, it was still himself who had underestimated Sun Mo too much. He had felt that an intern teacher like Sun Mo wouldn\u2019t amount to anything.However, Sun Mo had officially joined the school during these few days, and his first public lecture was such a huge success!Zhou Xu believed that after this public lecture, the number of students who wanted to ask Sun Mo to use his Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands on them would surely explode. At that time, things would be extremely difficult if he wanted to experience it again.\u201cAi, this feels so unbearable!\u201dZhou Xu sighed again and felt so regretful that he wanted to die. Once, he had had a chance where he could have forged a good relationship with Sun Mo. Sadly, he couldn\u2019t grasp it.\u201cIs it really so exaggerated?\u201dWang Hao sniffed. He had gone to attend Gao Ben\u2019s lecture. This was why he had come late.After Wang Hao arrived, the corridor was already packed to the brim with people. He only saw Feng Zewen leading over ten students away.\u201cExaggerated? Teacher Sun helped two students to break through today. He also used the great teacher halo \u2018ignorant and incompetent\u2019 to teach Zhou Yong a lesson. Lastly, he even drove an experienced teacher away due to anger, making the teacher faint in the corridor. Tell me, how are my earlier words an exaggeration?\u201dZhou Xu rolled his eyes.\u201cZhou Yong? The tyrant of Central Province Academy, the direct descendant of the huge magnate of Jinling?\u201dWang Hao clicked his tongue. He didn\u2019t expect that Sun Mo had done so many things in just a public lecture.\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s the school tyrant I\u2019m referring to. You didn\u2019t see how Teacher Sun used \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019 on him and turned him into an idiot that drooled and walked around stupidly, banging into walls. It was really helpful to vent our resentment and anger.\u201dZhou Xu laughed loudly.He hadn\u2019t been bullied by Zhou Yong before, but many of his friends had suffered. Hence, he knew how arrogant and terrifying Zhou Yong was. He made it a point to avoid Zhou Yong every time, as he was afraid that he might be targeted.\u201cIt\u2019s already considered a profit just to be able to see Zhou Yong being taught a lesson.\u201d Qi Shengjia interjected.\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d After Zhou Yong spoke, he grew somewhat worried. \u201cHowever, Zhou Yong definitely wouldn\u2019t let things slide given his personality. I heard that he had chased away quite a few teachers before.\u201d\u201cHmph, Teacher Sun isn\u2019t an ordinary teacher. If Zhou Yong dares to look for trouble, Teacher Sun would dare to teach him how to be a human.\u201dRight now, Qi Shengjia was filled with boundless worship for Sun Mo.Ding!Favorable impression points from Qi Shengjia +15. Friendly (493/1,000).\u201cYeah, teach him how to behave properly like a human being with \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019!\u201dZhou Xu clenched his fist. A thought then arose in his mind. \u201cIn any case, your relationship with Teacher Sun isn\u2019t too bad, right? Why don\u2019t we treat him to a meal to help him celebrate?\u201d\u201cHow am I important enough to treat him to a meal?!\u201dQi Shengjia was depressed.\u201cIf there\u2019s no way, we should forget it then. He has God Hands, I really wished to personally witness it!\u201d Zhou Xu spoke. At the same time, he suddenly sighed. \u201cSpeaking of which, I\u2019m really very jealous of you. You being able to break through to the fifth level must be due to God Hands. I must think of a way to experience Teacher Sun\u2019s massage again!\u201dDing!Favorable impression points from Zhou Xu +25. Neutral (81/100),\u201cSigh, please stop talking about it guys. The more you guys speak of this, the more regretful I feel!\u201dWang Hao clutched his chest, feeling a little unhappy in his heart. (Gao Ben, you are really useless.) When he left Gao Ben\u2019s lecture, only around ten people were still there to listen to his lecture.When Wang Hao put himself in Gao Ben\u2019s shoes, he also felt extremely awkward.It was unknown how Gao Ben was feeling. He had chosen the same date and time as Sun Mo for his public lecture. Now, he had completely lost all his face.Students who had no idea what was going on would immediately determine that Sun Mo was a graduate from one of the Nine Greats based on the number of people attending his lecture. As for Gao Ben? Who knew who the hell this person was?Ding!Favorable impression points from Wang Hao +15. Neutral (88/100)\u2026While Sun Mo was cultivating the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art, he heard another three notifications and gained favorable impression points from three students.He could forget about Zhou Xu and Wang Hao, but Qi Shengjia was truly a good student. The number of favorable impression points generated from him per day placed him on the same level as the papaya girl.Sun Mo felt that if he brought these two students around with him wherever he went, he most probably would be able to gain several hundred favorable impression points every month. If he worked a little harder, he would be able to easily buy a starmoon fruit.However, Sun Mo was merely thinking about it. He had the pride of a teacher and wouldn\u2019t rashly accept disciples just to make use of them to obtain favorable impression points.Sun Mo cultivated until dusk and after he ate dinner at the canteen, he returned to his dorm.\u201cTeacher Sun!\u201dUpon seeing Sun Mo, Ludi who was plucking the fur from pig trotters immediately stood up and squeezed out a smile.\u201cTeacher Ludi!\u201dSince the other party was smiling, Sun Mo naturally wouldn\u2019t show a black face.\u201cDon\u2019t call me that, I\u2019m still not an official teacher!\u201dIf other intern teachers called him that, Ludi wouldn\u2019t mind it. But if Sun Mo who was already an official teacher called him that, he would feel embarrassed.Sun Mo had no concerns.\u201cTeacher Sun, have\u2026have you eaten dinner?\u201dAlthough Ludi had practiced this sentence many times before Sun Mo returned, he still found it a little hard to say it before Sun Mo.After all, he was behaving like a lackey now!\u201cI\u2019ve eaten!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s words were concise and comprehensive.\u201cAh?\u201dLudi started. He initially planned to ask Sun Mo out for a meal and if he didn\u2019t mind it, he would pass Sun Mo his braised pig trotters. He felt that the standard of his stewed meat would be able to gain Sun Mo\u2019s friendship.Sun Mo took his bag and put in the three books he had borrowed in it. Then, he was preparing to leave.\u201cAi? It\u2019s already so late. Do you still want to go out?\u201dLudi was anxious. He hadn\u2019t given Sun Mo the pig trotters yet. Hence, he hurriedly went to take an earthenware pot.\u201cI\u2019ll be heading to the library and might be back late at night. I might accidentally disturb your sleep; hence, I\u2019ll beg your pardon in advance.\u201dAfter Sun Mo finished speaking, he went out.Bang!The dorm\u2019s door closed.Ludi carried the pot and was struck dumb at his spot. For a time, his thoughts were in chaos.Sun Mo\u2019s attitude couldn\u2019t be considered friendly or bad. After all, they didn\u2019t speak too much with each other before.Actually, Ludi had predicted that Sun Mo would become extremely arrogant. After all, his lecture was a huge success today and it was very normal for him to be proud. However, Sun Mo wasn\u2019t arrogant at all.Besides, it was already so late, yet he still wanted to study at the library. Ludi couldn\u2019t see any hint of being complacent from Sun Mo\u2019s actions.\u201cHow ridiculous, Zhang Sheng actually looked down on this type of people.\u201dLudi shook his head and couldn\u2019t help but smile.\u201cIn the past when Sun Mo ignored Zhang Sheng, Zhang Sheng and Yuan Feng felt that it was because Sun Mo was scared and didn\u2019t dare to antagonize them. But now from the looks of things, it turns out that Sun Mo disdained fighting with Zhang Sheng. Even Qin Fen and Gao Ben suffered in his hands. What does a mere Zhang Sheng count for?\u201d\u201cThis can\u2019t do. Sun Mo has already become an official teacher, yet he is still so hard working. I need to put in more effort!\u201dDing!Favorable impression points from Ludi +10. Prestige connection unlocked: Neutral (10/100).Ludi placed the earthenware pot down and took out [Study of Spirit Runes]. When he saw the ten pig trotters on the table that he had already removed the fur from, he couldn\u2019t help but start. After that, he gritted his teeth and pushed all the pig trotters down to the ground.\u201cDamn, I\u2019m an intern teacher, and my ambition is to become a great teacher. I want students to love and respect me. I\u2019m not a meat stewer!\u201dLudi suddenly howled. Tears began falling from the corners of his eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDuring nightfall on the campus.Although Sun Mo had already integrated with his original-self\u2019s memories and obtained his knowledge, it wouldn\u2019t be a mistake to do more research and preparation.Tomorrow would be the first day where he officially taught his five personal disciples. Sun Mo wanted a good beginning.If a teacher wanted to obtain respect and adoration from their students, they couldn\u2019t depend on scolding the students. Rather, it was their teaching ability and whether the teachers were able to guide the students to improve themselves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Upon hearing the sound of a door shifting, she immediately opened her eyes. When she saw Sun Mo, her heart leaped in excitement.\u201cGood morning Teacher Sun!\u201dThe papaya girl greeted him.\u201cYou are already a student of the Central Province Academy. There\u2019s no need to wait for me every day.\u201d Sun Mo frowned. \u201cIf you have the time, why don\u2019t you do something else?\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dUpon hearing Sun Mo\u2019s unhappy tone when talking to her, Lu Zhiruo lowered her head. Her two fingers tugged on the front-side of her shirt as she felt a little disappointed.\u201cActually\u2026 I was not wasting time. I was meditating!\u201dSun Mo heard the papaya girl mumbling to herself, but he didn\u2019t care. \u201cBy taking the time to come over here, isn\u2019t that wasting time? Also, greetings such as this are meaningless.\u201dLu Zhiruo obediently followed behind Sun Mo.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t become a maid that only knows how to take care of others. Instead, I hope you can become the person you wish to become!\u201dSun Mo advised.He was very moved when he saw the amount of respect Lu Zhiruo had for him. If he was any other teacher, he might feel very proud that his student was waiting to greet him every morning outside his dorm. However, Sun Mo didn\u2019t need this.He truly wished for Lu Zhiruo to be good, to put more time into important things. Hence, he activated \u2018Priceless Advice\u2019.A golden halo shot out, and its light cascaded down on the papaya girl.\u201cBecoming the person I wish to be?\u201dLu Zhiruo repeated these words, and a radiant glow gradually appeared in her eyes. That was right. She didn\u2019t come to Central Province Academy because she wanted to play.\u201cTruly well said, Teacher Sun!\u201dLu Zhiruo\u2019s gaze was filled with respect.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +20. Friendly: (388/1,000).Upon hearing the notification, Sun Mo was speechless. (Did you give me favorable impression points just like that? I know that you have big breasts, but you cannot keep milking yourself like that every day!)(What if I\u2019m spoiled by the influx of points? I might be very disappointed if I won\u2019t get as many favorable points in the future.)The other intern teachers just went out as well, and they couldn\u2019t help but start when they coincidentally saw this.(Great teacher halo?)(Who is this?)After seeing Sun Mo, everyone understood. The deeds this person had done in his first public lecture had already been circulated around.\u2026In the canteen, the fragrance of food permeated the air.\u201cA bowl of porridge, four vegetarian buns, one egg, and one dish of salted veggies for me.\u201dAfter the instruction, Sun Mo passed the teacher badge to Lu Zhiruo and found an empty spot to sit down. \u201cChoose whatever you want to eat!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dLu Zhiruo nodded and went to get food.Although Lu Zhiruo was endearingly silly, she was quite on-the-ball when it came to chores. She returned shortly after while carrying two trays of food.Sun Mo took over the trays from her.\u201cWhy is there no egg on your plate?\u2019Sun Mo frowned. The papaya girl\u2019s breakfast was the same as him, but she only had two buns and didn\u2019t have an egg.\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m not hungry!\u201d Lu Zhiruo replied.\u201cGo buy two eggs and finish them.\u201d Sun Mo instructed.The papaya girl didn\u2019t move. She knew that Sun Mo would definitely pay for her.\u201cQuickly go!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s tone changed to one of command.\u201cOh!\u201dThe papaya girl who just sat down immediately jumped up. She then ran to the food stall.Sun Mo shook his head. Actually, he understood Lu Zhiruo\u2019s thoughts. Because he was paying for the meals every day, she definitely felt embarrassed.Honestly speaking, Sun Mo was still very fond of Lu Zhiruo. She was simply too understanding.The papaya girl came back after buying the eggs, but she didn\u2019t eat them immediately. She chose the larger egg and de-shelled it before placing it into Sun Mo\u2019s porridge.When Sun Mo was in the no. 2 high school, he didn\u2019t even dare to imagine such a life where he was being waited upon by others. His breakfast every day would be settled after buying fried pancakes or a bowl of soft bean curd from roadside stalls.Letting a beautiful big-chested student to de-shell eggs for him?That would only exist in his dreams!Sun Mo drank his porridge as he went through the topics he wanted to talk about in his lesson later. He was also deducing the unexpected situations that his students might face and was thinking up solutions for them.After a while, five other students also sat on the eating table across them. Clearly, they were a small group and were idly chatting. After a while, the topic of their discussion turned to Sun Mo.Since Lu Zhiruo heard her teacher\u2019s name, her tiny ears pricked up.\u201cHave you guys heard it? This year, our school has an extremely tough new teacher. During his first public lecture, he already taught a lesson to Zhou Yong and got into a dispute with a 1-star great teacher!\u201d commented a male student with small eyes.\u201cTeaching a lesson to Zhou Yong? If he merely scolded Zhou Yong a little, that cannot be considered tough!\u201dThe person who spoke this time was a big-mouth male student. He drank his porridge loudly.\u201cHe didn\u2019t merely scold Zhou Yong, but he also cast the \u2018Ignorant and Incompetent\u2019 halo!\u201d said the other male student. The three remaining students in the group who had just learned of this were stunned.\u201cIs this true?\u201dThe big-mouth student exclaimed in shock, \u201cThat new teacher most probably doesn\u2019t know the deeds that Zhou Yong did before, right?\u2019\u201cWho cares? In any case, I feel happy when I see Zhou Yong down on his luck!\u201dThe small-eyed male student smiled widely. It was precisely because of this matter that he was so happy. This was why he specially added an egg in his meal today.As a school tyrant, Zhou Yong was someone extremely notorious.Although these few students hadn\u2019t been bullied by him before, they all heard about the nasty things Zhou Yong had done. With Zhou Yong around, they felt like there was a mad dog on campus that might bite them at any given moment. Now that someone had stepped up and taken care of the mad dog, everyone naturally felt very happy.\u201cI\u2019m going to add an egg to celebrate!\u201dThe big-mouth student stood up. He had a female friend from the same hometown who was bullied by Zhou Yong a few times. He wanted to help her but didn\u2019t dare to.If he offended Zhou Yong, Zhou Yong would surely take revenge until he \u2018died\u2019.On another eating table, some students were also in discussion, but their topic was about Sun Mo\u2019s Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands.\u201cI heard that he only touched the muscles of that female student named Qin Rong, and after a few seconds, he could tell the number of times she had tried to break through, as well as her current cultivation level. Do you guys think he\u2019s awesome or not?\u201d\u201cAre you sure that Qin Rong wasn\u2019t a paid actress? How could he tell so many details just by touching her muscles?\u201dUpon hearing this discussion, Lu Zhiruo was immediately unhappy. Although she was afraid of strangers, she still placed her chopsticks down and was preparing to stand up to rebut.\u201cEat!\u201d Sun Mo berated.\u201cAwu!\u201d The papaya girl was unhappy. However, there was no need for her to say anything because a student that was seated at a further eating table spoke out when he heard this.\u201cIt\u2019s naturally real! I\u2019ve personally witnessed it. Qin Rong\u2019s teacher is someone that has a conflict with Teacher Sun. Do you think his student would become a paid actor for Teacher Sun?\u201d\u201cThis is why he is given the title \u2018God Hands\u2019. If every teacher could do what he did, how would he be given such a high recognition?\u201d\u201cThat Dragon Capturing Hands sounds so tyrannical. I really wish to see it for myself.\u201dThe students discussed.The majority of comments were positive. Lu Zhiruo grinned widely in joy and felt that the porridge in her mouth tasted even sweeter.\u201cYou guys will discover in the future that Teacher Sun has many more strong points.\u201dLu Zhiruo mumbled silently in her heart.\u201cTeacher Sun?\u201dA voice suddenly rang out, interrupting Sun Mo\u2019s line of thought. He turned and saw two students carrying their meal trays at the side.After confirming that the person in question was Sun Mo, the two students hurriedly bowed.\u201cGood morning, Teacher Sun!\u201dWhen greeting a teacher, their voices must be loud and confident. So, the nearby students could also hear it.\u201cMn, don\u2019t disturb the others when they are having their meals!\u201dSun Mo indicated that there was no need for the two students to be overly courteous.\u201cYesterday, we attended your public lecture and felt that we have really benefited a lot!\u201dZhang Zhao felt a little agitated.\u201cIt\u2019s good that my lecture can help you guys!\u201d Sun Mo smiled.Because Zhang Zhao\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t low, all the people in the surroundings glanced over.\u201cTeacher Sun, I\u2026\u201dZhang Zhao wanted to ask Sun Mo some questions, but it was breakfast time now. If he did so, wouldn\u2019t it be too presumptuous of him? But if he didn\u2019t ask, he was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t have such a good chance anymore in the future.\u201cSit!\u201dSun Mo was very understanding. He pointed Zhang Zhao to a seat at the side.As a teacher, Sun Mo deeply understood the importance of forming good relationships with students. Moreover, this was in a public place. If he didn\u2019t take the chance to earn some favorable impression points, he would truly have let down the opportunity that had sent itself to his doors.Zhang Zhao and his friend hurriedly sat down.Sun Mo put down his spoon and stretched out his hand to touch Zhang Zhao\u2019s shoulder. At the same time, he activated Divine Sight and looked at him.=====Zhang Zhao, 16 years old. Ninth level of the body-refinement realm.Strength: 7. Sufficient for usage. He\u2019s recently injured and has weakened.Intellect: 6. Sufficient for usage.Agility: 9. Absolutely sufficient for usage. Speed is his advantage.Potential value: AverageNote: This is a good and very hardworking student. He won\u2019t give up any opportunities to learn.=====Zhang Zhao didn\u2019t even dare to breathe loudly. In fact, even all his muscles tensed up.The surrounding students glanced over. For a time, this dining area was completely silent. It was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.\u201cRecently, you are too hardworking in cultivation, which leads to the injury in your muscles. You should cut down your daily cultivation period by half an hour. Moreover, your left hand was injured five months ago, right? It hasn\u2019t recovered yet, try not to use it too often.\u201dSun Mo gave his opinion.The grandmaster-grade muscleforge technique was simply so tyrannical.\u201cYou\u2026 how did you know that my arm was injured before?\u201dZhang Zhao was dumbfounded.When Sun Mo told him to cut down half-an-hour of his cultivation time, he was still feeling doubtful. After all, the intensity of his training didn\u2019t cause him to feel any fatigue. In fact, he was recently wondering whether he should increase the intensity or not. However, Sun Mo\u2019s latter sentence caused him to be shocked.His arm was indeed injured five months ago when he was sparring against another student. Sun Mo even knew this. As expected of God Hands!Ceng!Zhang Zhao hurriedly stood up and bowed deeply.\u201cI will remember this. Teacher Sun, thank you for your guidance!\u201dDing!Favorable impression points from Zhang Zhao +20.Prestige connection unlocked. Neutral: (20/100).Upon hearing this, exclamations of surprises could be heard from the surroundings. Numerous pairs of eyes stared at Sun Mo with shock. After that, all their gazes turned toward Sun Mo\u2019s hands without prior consultation with each other.His fingers were slender and fair; his nails were neatly cut and very clean. His hands looked like a work of art.\u201cDoes he really have a pair of God Hands?\u201dThis thought floated up in everyone\u2019s hearts.Sun Mo indicated Zhang Zhao to sit down. \u201cFrom your muscles, I could tell that you are very diligent. If you continue like this, you will be able to break through to the spirit-refinement realm in roughly three months.\u201d\u201cReally?\u2019Zhang Zhao was very surprised. From the body-refinement realm to the spirit-refinement realm, it was a major thing in cultivation. If he knew when he would breakthrough, he could be psychologically prepared in advance.One must know that for matters like breaking through, it usually occurred very suddenly.For some students, due to their heart states not being up to the mark, when they encountered a chance to breakthrough in their cultivation, they failed because they were not sufficiently prepared.\u201cWork hard!\u201dSun Mo stood up. He was afraid if he continued staying here, he would be late for his class.Regardless of the reasons, for the first guidance that he would be conducting for his personal students, he mustn\u2019t be late.Lu Zhiruo instantly put away the food trays in a hurry.\u201cTeacher Sun, take care!\u201dZhang Zhao and his friend hurriedly stood up.The surrounding students also stood up. Although they didn\u2019t ask any questions, their expressions were one of respect.Sun Mo started. He had never seen a situation like this before.In the various countries of the nine provinces, this was precisely the status of teachers. If there was a great teacher, even if the students in the canteen were seated very far away and couldn\u2019t see the great teacher personally, they would still stand up in respect when the great teacher departed after consuming his meal.\u201cEveryone, please sit down and enjoy your food!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s expression was casual and carefree, but he was emotionally moved in his heart. He grew increasingly aware of the importance of this occupation.(That\u2019s right. Teachers exist to sustain the lofty aspirations of students!)\u201cIs there a great teacher eating here?\u201dWhen a teacher who had just ordered his food heard the commotion, he couldn\u2019t help but incline his head for a look.\u201cSun Mo!\u201dYi Jiamin narrowed his eyes. He wasn\u2019t really very fond of Sun Mo, his colleague who was assigned to the same office as him. Now that he saw this scene, he felt even unhappier.(Everyone is a teacher, why are you showing off so much?)As for intern teachers, they didn\u2019t think too much. When they saw tens of students standing up and sending Sun Mo off respectfully, there was only intense envy in their eyes.Under the morning sun, the temperature of the atmosphere began to increase.Sun Mo exited the canteen, but before he could take a few steps, someone already called out his name.\u201cTeacher Sun, please wait!\u201dA moment later, a young man rushed over with large strides, only stopping before Sun Mo.\u201cYou are\u2026?Sun Mo frowned.\u201cTeacher Sun, my name is Mei Yi. I specially came to seek guidance from Teacher Sun!\u201dMei Yi clasped his hands and bowed.\u201cAs expected, someone came after all?\u201dAlthough Mei Yi\u2019s attitude appeared to be good, Sun Mo understood that Mei Yi wanted to use him as a stepping stone.Sun Mo knew that he had no way to avoid this matter. It was just that he didn\u2019t expect such a thing to happen so fast.\u201cTeacher, I went to your public lecture yesterday. After the lecture, I am incomparably impressed by your talent and learning. Most probably, your combat strength is outstanding as well, right? Hence, I wish to spar against you.\u201dMei Yi first made Sun Mo wear a tall hat before he suggested combat. By doing so, the chance of Sun Mo rejecting him would be much lower.\u201cSure!\u201dSun Mo was prepared to accept all challengers.Mei Yi\u2019s eyes brightened and immediately suggested, \u201cI think this space is pretty wide. There\u2019s no need to head to the training ground. What do you think?\u201dBefore the canteen, there was a small public square. If one was to head further ahead, that would be the main road that led to the dormitory and the classes.And now, it was breakfast time. There were many students heading to and fro. When they saw that some teachers were about to spar, they immediately came over to spectate.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOther than watching a good show, observing the combat of others could be considered a type of cultivation as well.\u201cSure!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t mind.[1] Iron-headed = A chinese gaming slang referring to a person that\u2019s unafraid of death and whose actions are a little brainless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - Defeating Enemies with a Single MovePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94: Defeating Enemies with a Single MoveLordbluefire=====Mei Yi, 20 years old. First level of blood-ignition.Strength: 22, newbie.Intellect: 24, normal standard.Agility: 23, a little thorny.Potential: averageNote: An average challenger, no strong points and no weak points. He is so ordinary to the extent that one can always find someone like this in a crowd of humans.=====Sun Mo activated Divine Sight and surveyed Mei Yi\u2019s stats. After scanning through rapidly, he felt a little disappointed.(Can\u2019t there be a genius challenger who comes to challenge me? I really don\u2019t feel keen on fighting an ordinary person.)\u201cPlease do not underestimate any challengers. His cultivation level is the same as yours!\u201d the system warned.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d Sun Mo shook his head.To Sun Mo who would always choose the highest difficulty setting when he bought a new game, only those tough challenges would cause him to feel delighted.\u201cTeacher Sun, are you done with your preparations?\u201dThe students already stepped back and gave them space for the spar. Mei Yi was eager to start. A few minutes later, he would become famous after this battle.\u201cMight I be so bold as to ask if you have any unique ultimate skills? Or some other cultivation arts that no one knows?\u201dSun Mo inquired.\u201cWhat? Are you looking down on me?\u201dMei Yi\u2019s expression sank. The cultivation art he trained in was the peak-grade earth-tier Golden Sun Sword Manual. Although it wasn\u2019t a common cultivation art, it wasn\u2019t that high-end.For teachers like them who didn\u2019t have any backgrounds, it was simply too difficult if they wanted to learn peak-grade cultivation arts. They had to spend a huge amount of money to purchase the cultivation arts from famous schools or aristocrat clans that existed for over a thousand years. Either that or they had to contribute immensely to the school and gain the recognition of the headmaster.There was another way and that was to explore the ruins and secret realms in the Darkness Continent. If they were fortunate, they might be able to find some cultivation art manuals that had been lost for many years.\u201cNo, I was merely curious.\u201dSun Mo smiled. It seemed like there was no need for him to use Immemorial Vairocana. In that case, he would simply use the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art to settle this. He could test out the might of \u2018Copy\u2019 as well.Clank~!Mei Yi pulled out his sword. He was using a long sword that was two fingers wide and one meter long. When he graduated, this was something his father had bought for him using two years of his savings.Sun Mo pulled out the sandalwood wooden blade attached to his waist.\u201cYou are using this?\u201d Mei Yi frowned.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If I lose, I won\u2019t use this as an excuse.\u201dSun Mo knew what Mei Yi was worried about; hence, he explained.\u201cSwords and sabers have no eyes, you should use a real weapon!\u201d Mei Yi warned.\u201cNo need!\u201dSun Mo stared at the longsword in Mei Yi\u2019s hands.It was of excellent quality, but it wasn\u2019t graded.After seeing its data, Sun Mo suddenly felt like he was bullying Mei Yi.In Middle-Earth Nine Provinces, the tiers of martial weapons from low to high could be classified as spirit weapons, saint weapons, and the extremely rare and valuable divine weapons.And for each tier, it could be further classified into inferior, average, superior, and the peerless grade!The wooden blade in Sun Mo\u2019s hand might not be made from metal, but it was something crafted from black sandalwood and polished with the meticulous efforts of a great weaponsmith from Liang Province for three years.This type of wood was extremely tough, equivalent to steel. Moreover, it would also emit a faint sandalwood fragrance and could last for several tens of years, having the effects of purging nightmares and calming one\u2019s heart and mind.This wooden blade was a spirit weapon.\u201cI won\u2019t be polite then.\u201dMei Yi had a feeling like he couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He caused a sword ripple to manifest in the air, \u201cMei Yi, first level of the blood-ignition realm. Please guide me!\u201d\u201cSun Mo, first level of the blood-ignition realm. Please guide me!\u201dEven before the voice of Sun Mo faded, Mei Yi already shot out like a sharp arrow, lunging toward Sun Mo.At this very moment, there was only Sun Mo in Mei Yi\u2019s eyes. He didn\u2019t even think about it and unleashed his strongest killing move.Golden Sun Annihilation!Bzz~Mei Yi\u2019s longsword trembled as it emitted a humming noise. At the same time, due to the spirit qi imbued into it, it unleashed a golden glow. For a time, the entire space grew incomparably bright.Mei Yi had to practice this move several hundred times every single day!This move was already integrated into Mei Yi\u2019s instincts. He was so familiar with it to the point where he could unleash it with no prior preparations. There was no need for him to even think.\u201cHa. Both our cultivation realms are similar. He would definitely try to probe me by steadily attacking for the sake of victory, right?\u201dMei Yi felt a little complacent. For this battle today, he had begun thinking about it since yesterday afternoon. This was because he wanted to pull off a surprise move and defeat his enemy in a single strike.Only then would his victory be gorgeous, capable of leaving behind a deep impression in the hearts of the spectating students.Wait a minute, why did Sun Mo\u2019s face not have any expression of fear or panic?Mei Yi\u2019s expression instantly turned heavy. According to his thoughts, Sun Mo would definitely panic when faced with his sudden attack. But what was this situation now?Why did he stand there with a calm look on his face?Given Mei Yi\u2019s intellect, he wouldn\u2019t be foolish enough to assume that Sun Mo was not moving because of being too frightened.Before Mei Yi pulled out his sword, Sun Mo already cast \u2018Copy\u2019. Hence, Mei Yi\u2019s sword, which was extremely fast in the eyes of others, was as slow as a sloth in Sun Mo\u2019s vision.The entire world seemed to slow down. Sun Mo could be more focused and could easily observe and track all the subtle changes.The Grand Universe Formless Divine Art was activated as Sun Mo brandished his wooden blade.Golden Sun Annihilation!Swish!When Mei Yi just arrived before Sun Mo, he already saw a wooden blade swiftly chopping down, aiming for his throat. This caused him to be badly shocked. He subconsciously changed his move, wanting to block it.Boom!When the wooden blade collided with the longsword, an immense might gushed over, causing Mei Yi to be unable to persist any longer. He coughed out blood and was flung back from the impact.Bang!Mei Yi fell onto the ground like a heavy sack; his entire body was covered in dirt and dust.Everyone was silent. The spectators glanced at Mei Yi before looking at Sun Mo. For a time, they didn\u2019t know how to react. Weren\u2019t the two combatants both at the first level of the blood-ignition realm?Why was this person named Mei Yi insta-defeated in a single move?Some students from the lower-years didn\u2019t have sufficient judgment and experience and couldn\u2019t see through the intricacies of the earlier combat, However, the higher-year students understood that Sun Mo used the same move as Mei Yi. It was just that Sun Mo\u2019s proficiency and strength, with regards to that move, was stronger compared to Mei Yi\u2019s.From this, one could tell that Sun Mo had definitely spent a very long time to practice the Golden Sun Sword Manual.Sun Mo lowered his head and glanced at his wooden blade, recalling the earlier process. (So, was that \u2018Copy\u2019? It\u2019s truly powerful. No wonder it is a peak-grade saint-tier cultivation art!)Mei Yi\u2019s face turned pale. He struggled and wanted to stand up. However, he had taken an attack head-on, and the impact caused his arm and chest to be injured. For a time, it felt extremely unbearable. He couldn\u2019t exert any force at all.But compared to the physical pain he was feeling, the mental and psychological injuries were even more serious.He was defeated. Not only so, but he was also defeated by Golden Sun Annihilation!One must know that this was the move he was most proficient in. However, he still couldn\u2019t defeat Sun Mo. Didn\u2019t this mean that his martial talent was inferior to Sun Mo\u2019s?Such an impact was too great!\u201cThanks for letting me win!\u201dAfter Sun Mo spoke, he glanced at the surroundings. \u201cI know there are still some intern teachers who wish to challenge me. You guys can step out now!\u201dSun Mo liked combat-type games. Now, he finally had the chance to fight for real, and this naturally caused him to feel very excited. Besides, using martial strength to defeat enemies was very cool.(There is no need to speak about logic. If both of us are in a bad mood with each other, we can directly engage in a physical fight. This feeling is simply too awesome.)Whispers rang out from the surroundings, but no one stood up temporarily.Sun Mo had defeated Mei Yi in a single move. Honestly speaking, everyone felt a little shocked.\u201cIs there no one else? If there aren\u2019t any more challengers, I\u2019m going to leave!\u201d Sun Mo spoke.After someone adjusted his mood, he stood up.\u201cTeacher Sun. I\u2019m Lu Kun, first level of the blood-ignition realm. Please guide me!\u201dA tall and strong young man reported his name. He was also an intern teacher.\u201cSun Mo, first level of the blood-ignition realm. Please guide me!\u201dSun Mo entered the \u2018Copy\u2019 state again.The world slowed down once again.Compared to Mei Yi, Lu Kun was much more cautious. He didn\u2019t launch a sudden attack. Instead, he brandished his sword and simply faced Sun Mo.Time flowed by. The spectating students waited to the point where they felt a little impatient. Everyone wanted to see hot-blooded combat, yet both of them simply stood there and looked at each other. What were they doing?(If you two are doing some sort of performance art, please do it at the school\u2019s entrance instead!)A droplet of sweat flowed from Lu Kun\u2019s forehead. He knew that he couldn\u2019t continue maintaining the status quo forever, but he couldn\u2019t find a chance to attack.He didn\u2019t know why, but Sun Mo stood there casually yet exuding a feeling of being one with nature. Sun Mo showed no flaws in his stance at all.The most troublesome thing was that when he matched his gaze with Sun Mo\u2019s, Lu Kun felt as though he was being seen through.Such a feeling was truly unbearable!The spectators grew increasingly unhappy as the sounds of their clamor gradually rose in volume. Some people were even starting to boo.As the challenger, Lu Kun was under greater pressure. If he still didn\u2019t attack, people would feel that he was afraid. Moreover, he would also lose out in terms of his aura.\u201cDAMN, I\u2019ll go all out!\u201dLu Kun gritted his teeth and rushed Sun Mo. At the instant he closed in, his left leg immediately shifted as he changed direction, attacking Sun Mo from the right instead. After that, he lifted his sword and pierced out ferociously.Gale Shooting Moon!Swish!The longsword was like a poisonous snake hunting prey. It created numerous after-images as it stabbed toward Sun Mo\u2019s throat. However, even before it could hit its target, Sun Mo\u2019s wooden blade already pierced over with rapid speed.Dang!The longsword was blocked. After that, the wooden blade shot toward Lu Kun\u2019s throat with lightning speed.\u201cWhat?\u201dLu Kun was so frightened that his soul almost flew out. There was no time for him to block the wooden blade. If the wooden blade pierced his throat, he would die for sure.Swish!The wooden blade stopped right before Lu Kun\u2019s throat.\u201cYou\u2019ve lost!\u201dSun Mo\u2019s clear voice was like a gust of gentle wind. It felt very comfortable listening to it.Lu Kun gulped down a mouthful of saliva. After that, he stared at the wooden blade an inch away from his throat as he involuntarily sighed. \u201cYou are really powerful!\u201dLu Kun was proficient in this move, Gale Shooting Moon, and felt that he had achieved minor completion in it. Hence, when he saw Sun Mo unleashing the same move and completely suppressing him, he could only sigh silently and be convinced in his heart.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Kun +5. Prestige connection unlocked: Neutral (5/100).\u201cYou are not bad either!\u201dSun Mo smiled. He put his blade away before glancing at the surroundings. \u201cAnyone else?\u201dAll the intern teachers in the crowd began to reevaluate their strength.If it was earlier, some people would have felt that Lu Kun had seized their chance of being famous because he had been half-a-step faster than them to challenge Sun Mo. But now, their intentions to challenge Sun Mo was no longer as intense.In fact, they even felt a little fortunate that they didn\u2019t step out.Sun Mo continuously defeated his opponents with a single move while being at the same cultivation level as them. This was his proof of strength.Maybe Mei Yi and Lu Kun took things easy on Sun Mo?Stop joking. There were so many students spectating. Could it be that the two of them didn\u2019t want their faces anymore?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSo, maybe Mei Yi and Lu Kun\u2019s martial skills were too rubbish?Everyone wasn\u2019t blind. These two intern teachers were decent and their execution was smooth. There had also been quite a huge amount of power in their attacks. Evidently, they had given it their all and even unleashed their ultimate technique. Yet, they were still inferior to Sun Mo.What did this mean?It meant that Sun Mo had the ability to crush all cultivators at the same cultivation level\u2014the first level of blood-ignition realm\u2014as him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As they chatted, their attitude toward Sun Mo became increasingly prudent. Sun Mo wasn\u2019t an easily-defeated opponent.If they weren\u2019t completely confident, it was best not to act or they would be used as stepping stones by Sun Mo instead. They might even be crippled.Lu Zhiruo stood among the crowds. When she saw no one else coming out to challenge Sun Mo, she happily clapped her hands.\u201cTeacher Sun is so awesome!\u201dDing!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +30. Friendly (418/1,000).Seeing that no one else stepped out, Sun Mo put away the wooden blade. His expression was calm as he announced, \u201cIn the future, cultivators at the first level of blood-ignition realm didn\u2019t need to look for me. I won\u2019t accept any challengers at this level!\u201dHua!A commotion instantly rang out from the crowd.Sun Mo\u2019s words were truly arrogant!Because the unspoken words were clear. (None of you are my opponent, so stop embarrassing yourselves, please?)Those intern teachers at the first level of blood-ignition felt depressed and unhappy in their hearts. They really felt like rushing out to break Sun Mo\u2019s head and roar a sentence, \u2018Who do you think you are? How do you know that you would win for sure?\u2019However, when they turned their heads and looked at Mei Yi and Lu Kun, the unhappiness in their hearts vanished and it turned into intense frustrations.Sun Mo was arrogant indeed, but he had the capabilities to be arrogant.\u201cAs for those at the second level of the blood-ignition realm, just bring it on!\u201dSun Mo took the initiative and challenged them. Other than wanting to try the power of \u2018Copy\u2019, the technique from the third-level of the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art, he had two other reasons.Firstly, this was a public venue and there were many spectators. If he won, his fame would spread swiftly.Fame was a type of proof for one\u2019s social status and position. The greater one\u2019s fame was, the lesser others would scorn or hold you in contempt.Sun Mo\u2019s first step was to make those people who always called him \u2018soft-rice guy\u2019 shut up.Secondly, it was to settle all of these random challenges once and for all, making those who wanted to use him as a stepping stone not dare to act recklessly. By doing so, he could filter out trash from elites.Sun Mo wasn\u2019t afraid of combat, but he didn\u2019t want to waste time. Fighting against these random nobodies wouldn\u2019t help him grow even if he won against them a hundred times.It was like someone killing a hundred \u2018white-name\u2019 monsters in a game. The experience gained was so little that it was negligible.Sun Mo\u2019s creed was that if he had to kill, he would rather kill elites!Those intern teachers at the second level of the blood-ignition realm had planned to challenge him. But after hearing his words, all of their faces turned green.That was right, they were a level higher. If they won, it was only to be expected. But if they lost, they would become Sun Mo\u2019s stepping stone instead.\u201cZhiruo, time to go.\u201dSun Mo called out. After that, he flicked away the non-existent dust on his clothes and departed.Seeing Sun Mo walk over, the surrounding students immediately opened up a path. Some were even bowing slightly.\u201cWho is that teacher?\u201d\u201cGod Hands!\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are God Hands?\u201d\u201cHave you not heard of the incident yesterday?\u201dAs expected, the students began to discuss. After that, Sun Mo\u2019s name began to sound out everywhere.Gao Ben was currently walking to the canteen and there was a relaxed smile on his face.He was at the third level of the blood-ignition realm and was two whole levels higher than Sun Mo. This disparity was so great that even if Sun Mo didn\u2019t do anything but cultivate for an entire year, he wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up to Gao Ben.For matters like cultivation, one had to unceasingly challenge themselves to break their limits. Hence, the higher one\u2019s cultivation level was, the tougher it was to advance.To teachers, because they had to guide students and even research into side occupations, the amount of time they had for cultivation was shorter compared to others. Hence, their cultivation speed was also slower when compared to pure cultivators.For the blood-ignition realm, according to the data published by Saint Gate, it would take a teacher roughly about a year to break through each level.The standard of the Saint Gate was that if a teacher could cultivate to the great circle (perfection) of blood-ignition realm and successfully break through to the divine force realm, it could already be considered a relatively amazing result.Teachers of this caliber would be heavily nurtured in each of the famous schools. They would be given heavy responsibilities as well.But very soon, Gao Ben stopped laughing. He recalled his humiliation yesterday. There were only four students who had attended his public lecture.That was his first public lecture! How preposterous!\u201cI have to execute my plan quickly and let the teachers and students of Central Province Academy know that I\u2019m the best. Sun Mo is just a dog fart!\u201dUpon thinking of this, Gao Ben decided not to eat breakfast and went to search for his personal disciples straight away.\u2026..Ding!\u201cCongratulations, you obtained a total of +127 favorable impression points.\u201d\u201cSo little?\u201dSun Mo was surprised. He thought that there would be more.\u201cThese were contributed by lower-year students. Their judgment is lower, and that\u2019s why they were shocked by your performance and became impressed. If you want to awe those high-year students, you have to work harder and perform even better,\u201d the system explained.Sun Mo reached the entrance to the teaching building five minutes before the meeting time.Li Ziqi, Xuanyuan Po, and Jiang Leng already arrived.Li Ziqi, whose physical ability was equivalent to zero yet was a good-talker, wanted to forge a better relationship with her two junior brothers. Hence, she did some checks on their current situations.However, one of them was a muscle-brain that was only interested in combat, and the other sat there in a daze and showed no signs of wanting to chat. He was like a cold corpse.Li Ziqi didn\u2019t wish to be snubbed. Hence, she didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cTeacher Sun!\u201dUpon seeing Sun Mo walk over, Li Ziqi prepared to run over. But when she was going down the stairs, her steps weren\u2019t stable, and she directly slipped and fell over.Boom!Li Ziqi\u2019s butt slammed onto the ground directly!How painful!She felt that her butt was about to shatter from the impact.\u201cBoohoo, my image as the eldest martial sister is completely destroyed!\u201dSparkling tears could be seen in Li Ziqi\u2019s eyes. Other than pain, she also felt embarrassed. Now that she had fallen over like this, where had the prestige of the eldest martial sister gone to?\u201cSenior sister!\u201dLu Zhiruo jumped in fright and hurriedly went to help her up.Xuanyuan Po was indifferent, not even glancing at Li Ziqi. Jiang Leng was slightly better. He cast a glance at Li Ziqi but had no intention to help her up.Sun Mo furrowed his brows. His students had their own personalities. It wouldn\u2019t be an easy thing to teach them!\u201cEh? You guys all arrived?\u201dTantai Yutang\u2019s voice rang out. Everyone turned their heads and saw this invalid calmly walking over.As he spoke, he even pointed to the sundial that lay before the entrance.\u201cI\u2019m not late, I\u2019m perfectly punctual!\u201dWhen Tantai Yutang walked over to the stairs, at the instant he halted, the majestic sound of the bell rang out. This indicated that it was 8 a.m. now, and class had officially started.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me this fellow has OCD?\u201dSun Mo guessed. However, in this era where there were no wristwatches, Tantai Yutang\u2019s sense of time was very strong.Everyone had arrived. Hence, Sun Mo brought his five students over and found a small classroom that could hold up to 30 people. He then began to give his first tutorial after he arrived in Jinling.\u201cMy name is Sun Mo. From today onward, I\u2019m your personal teacher. I will do my best and give my all to guide you all. If there\u2019s a question that I cannot answer, I will personally consult great teachers for it. Naturally, you guys can also seek guidance from other teachers, I won\u2019t blame you all for that.\u201dSun Mo went straight to the point and first informed them of his teaching philosophy.\u201cTeacher Sun, a teacher for a day, a father for a lifetime. We won\u2019t look for other teachers to answer our questions.\u201dLi Ziqi hurriedly guaranteed.Lu Zhiruo also nodded in haste.In Middle-Earth Nine Provinces, once a student took someone as their teacher, they wouldn\u2019t consult other teachers with their questions as a sign of respect toward their teacher.Naturally, even if they did so, they would do it privately. If they did it openly, that would be doubting the capabilities of their own teacher.This was why Qin Rong had apologized to Feng Zewen during the first public lecture that day.\u201cWait for me to finish speaking first!\u201dSun Mo gestured for Li Ziqi not to interrupt. \u201cNot only so, if there comes a day where you all discover more capable teachers and wish to take them as your teacher, you can leave me. I will not blame or stop you all.\u201dLi Ziqi and Lu Zhiruo were stunned. How could this be possible?\u201cTeacher, your words are too over!\u201dJiang Leng, who had the coldest expression and was like a block of ice, was actually the first to retort. \u201cAre you doubting my character? Since I\u2019ve taken you as my teacher, I would never regret it.\u201dTantai Yutang cast a glance at Jiang Leng while silently musing that even if Jiang Leng wanted to acknowledge another teacher, it was unknown whether that teacher would accept him or not. However, Sun Mo didn\u2019t seem to be joking!That was really impressive then!One couldn\u2019t help but say that in terms of his spirit alone, Sun Mo was truly very shocking.Indeed, Sun Mo wasn\u2019t joking. He wasn\u2019t born in Middle-Earth Nine Provinces, and he didn\u2019t regard these rules as important. In his heart, the most important thing was that students could grow and make something out of themselves, becoming a person worthy of respect.\u201cI will also not regret this!\u201d Li Ziqi guaranteed.\u201cMe too!\u201d Lu Zhiruo raised her dainty hand.\u201cCan you say something proper?\u201d Xuanyuan Po frowned. He felt that this topic was simply a waste of time.\u201cWhat can be considered proper?\u201dSun Mo knew that Xuanyuan Po\u2019s personality was like this. However, it was also a kind of challenge to convince such obstinate genius students.\u201cFighting!\u201dXuanyuan Po\u2019s reply was concise and comprehensive. He looked Sun Mo in the eyes and was already filled with the desire to fight. \u201cTeacher, how about fighting against me?\u201dFortunately, Xuanyuan Po still remembered that Sun Mo was his teacher. If not, his action now would be equal to him taking the initiative to provoke and challenge Sun Mo.\u201cYou are just at the body-refinement realm. How is it possible for you to defeat Teacher Sun?\u201dLi Ziqi felt Xuanyuan Po was a retard.\u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t fight because I cannot win?\u201dXuanyuan Po counter-asked.\u201cEh.\u201dThis strange logic made Li Ziqi not know how to reply. Truly, Xuanyuan Po was a combat addict with a muscle-bound brain!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe cultivation art I train in is the Prairie Blazing Fire Spear Technique. It is considered a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art!\u201dXuanyuan Po stared at Sun Mo, his tone was filled with arrogance. \u201cTeacher, do you dare to fight me under the premises that we both don\u2019t use our spirit qi and only compete with moves?\u201dSi!Upon hearing the grade and the tier of the cultivation art, even Jiang Leng who always had an aloof expression couldn\u2019t help but draw in a breath of cold air. By proposing such a method of combat, Xuanyuan Po might really have a chance to win.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I Know One Too!\uff09Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 96: Saint-Tier Cultivation Art? I Know One Too!\uff09Lordbluefire\u201cXuanyuan Po, mind your tone. Is this how you talk to your personal teacher?\u201dLi Ziqi\u2019s beautiful brows frowned. Her pretty melon face was filled with unhappiness.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my tone?\u201dXuanyuan Po was puzzled.\u201cEnough. Ziqi, there\u2019s no need to say anything any longer.\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t angry. Xuanyuan Po was someone with a mind fixated on combat. There was no room for things like emotional quotient (EQ) in his brain.\u201cTeacher, teach him a lesson!\u201dTantai Yutang seemed to be unhappy about Xuanyuan Po\u2019s actions. In truth, he was someone who wanted to watch the world burn.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s head to the training room then!\u201dSun Mo knew that if he didn\u2019t agree to this fight, the tutorial would not be able to start. Besides, Xuanyuan Po\u2019s cultivation art was a peerless-grade saint-tier one.Very well then, it seemed like Sun Mo\u2019s divine skill, the Immemorial Vairocana, could finally be put to good use.There was a gigantic training dojo in the Central Province Academy with a hundred training rooms. This was built for the sake of convenience, allowing teachers to give lessons to their students easier.After all, some cultivation arts and guidance had to be kept a secret. As long as the training room\u2019s door was closed, there was no need to worry about the cultivation art being leaked out.Right now, Sun Mo was an official teacher. He was able to obtain a key to one of the training rooms easily.\u201cCan we begin?\u201dThe moment they entered the training room, Xuanyuan Po immediately brandished his silver spear, urging impatiently.\u201cYou can attack any time!\u201dSun Mo pulled out his wooden blade.The training room was constructed from gigantic slabs of layered stone about 1 cubic meter each, and there were many weapon scratches on the surface. One could tell that this place was built a long time ago.\u201cTeacher, receive my move!\u201dAfter Xuanyuan Po spoke, his body lunged forward.BOOM!Xuanyuan Po was like an artillery shell. He shot toward Sun Mo and pierced his spear out, aiming for Sun Mo\u2019s throat. However, a moment before his spear struck its target, the trajectory shifted toward Sun Mo\u2019s face.Sun Mo brandished his blade!Dang!The silver spear was pushed to the side.Xuanyuan Po didn\u2019t succeed with a single move, but he wasn\u2019t discouraged. On the contrary, he grew even more excited. He moved to the side and unleashed a barrage of attacks. His silver spear was like a toxic mouth spewing words, stabbing toward Sun Mo unceasingly.Lu Zhiruo clutched Li Ziqi\u2019s clothes tightly in anxiousness.When Li Ziqi heard Xuanyuan Po saying that his spear art was a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art, she felt a little worried for Sun Mo. But after seeing her teacher handling Xuanyuan Po\u2019s attack skillfully and easily, as well as not moving from the original location despite the impact, she began to feel at ease.Dang! Dang! Dang!The sounds of weapons clashing rang out repeatedly in the training room.\u201cOur teacher is so awesome!\u201dLu Zhiruo was deeply moved.Li Ziqi and the others didn\u2019t reply, but they all agreed with this.In this sparring session, both of them would only use their moves and not their spirit qi. This meant that Sun Mo couldn\u2019t suppress Xuanyuan Po by using his vaster amount of spirit qi due to his higher cultivation level.This way, the advantage of a higher cultivation realm was greatly reduced. The determinant of victory became one\u2019s combat experience, judgment, body quality, and the strength of their moves.The moves of a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art were truly profound. And Xuanyuan Po\u2019s execution was indeed adept and exquisite. With just a single look, anyone could tell that Xuanyuan Po was someone who loved and was proficient in combat.However, he didn\u2019t even get the slightest advantage. In fact, he found it impossible to make Sun Mo shift a single step.The current Sun Mo was like Mt. Tai, solid and immovable.\u201cIs this your full strength?\u201d Sun Mo asked.\u201cNope!\u201d After Xuanyuan Po spoke, his silver spear suddenly trembled and stabbed toward Sun Mo. After that, at the instant it was about to pierce Sun Mo\u2019s eyes, ten rays of spear light instantly erupted forth.Chi! Chi! Chi!The air was torn by the imposing might as a shrill sound echoed out.Spear Rain Pearflower!\u201cAh?\u201dLi Ziqi covered her mouth in anxiousness. From her viewpoint, those rays of spear light were as concentrated as fine rain. There was basically no way to dodge them.\u201cIs Xuanyuan Po planning to force Sun Mo to reveal his trump card?\u201dTantai Yutang narrowed his eyes and stared at Sun Mo.Jiang Leng also couldn\u2019t help but lean forward slightly, not wanting to miss the slightest detail. One couldn\u2019t help but say that this move of Xuanyuan Po was extremely incisive.If it was himself, how would he break it?Lu Zhiruo already covered her eyes, not daring to look.However, Sun Mo didn\u2019t act like what Tantai Yutang expected. Instead, he was as calm as before and casually waved his hand in response.Pak!The wooden blade shuttled through the shiny rays of spear light and precisely hit the silver spear. After that, the several tens of rays was like being blown away by the force of a hurricane and vanished from sight.Sun Mo then lifted his feet and kicked Xuanyuan Po\u2019s lower abdomen.Bang!Xuanyuan Po lifted his leg and wanted to block. However, he was slower by half-a-beat and staggered backward from the impact.\u201cZe, you are the fifth person who could block my Spear Rain Pearflower ever since I embarked on the path of martial arts!\u201dXuanyuan Po stared at Sun Mo. There was a fanatical look on his face. \u201cCome again!\u201dAfter speaking, this combat addict lunged over once more.\u201cLook, everything is fine now. Teacher will win for sure!\u201dLi Ziqi felt relieved.Lu Zhiruo removed her hand and saw Sun Mo dealing with Xuanyuan Po\u2019s frenzied attacks. Sun Mo seemed exceptionally casual and at ease. He was completely unperturbed and exuded the air of a great teacher.\u201cXuanyuan Po, it\u2019s said that your talent is among the top three among this batch of freshmen. But I think you are merely so-so!\u201d Tantai Yutang jeered.What is he trying to do?(Sun Mo is standing there and not using any moves, yet you can\u2019t even harm a single hair in his body? Is your reputation as a genius true or false?)Puzzlement appeared on Jiang Leng\u2019s face. He felt that Sun Mo\u2019s actions were quite bizarre, but he couldn\u2019t see through them.Xuanyuan Po didn\u2019t hear what Tantai Yutang was saying. Because right now in his eyes, there was only Sun Mo.\u201cWhat a pure person!\u201dSeeing the focused look in Xuanyuan Po\u2019s eyes, Sun Mo couldn\u2019t help but praise. This was a man that had given everything to combat.After that, Sun Mo was deeply moved by how powerful the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art was.After he executed the third-level skill \u2018Copy\u2019, he could clearly grasp each of Xuanyuan Po\u2019s attacks regardless of the attack\u2019s strength, angle, or the hidden variations within. He could predict them all. Hence, it was simply too easy for him to deal with Xuanyuan Po.At the start, Sun Mo was still a little worried if he would screw things up and thus was hesitating on whether he should activate Divine Sight or not. In the end, the might of the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art was unexpectedly good.Yet, when he thought about it, it was obvious. After all, this was a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art. Compared to Xuanyuan Po\u2019s Prairie Blazing Fire Spear Technique, it was even more profound and wondrous.Who could tell that Sun Mo was executing the Grand Universe Formless Divine Art now given his current state? Sun Mo didn\u2019t retaliate. He wanted to see Xuanyuan Po\u2019s other moves. If he took the initiative to attack, he would have lost long ago.Xuanyuan Po suddenly roared. He turned and ran back, but he abruptly shifted directions mid-way as his silver spear pierced forth from the side of his rib area.Because he used his arm to block his opponent\u2019s vision, this move was a concealed one that was filled with the element of surprise.Yet, Sun Mo had seen through it. Like before, he calmly waved his blade. But before his wooden blade could collide with the spear, he saw Xuanyuan Po\u2019s lips curling up into a smile.Explode!At the instant before the collision, there seemed to be a bomb explosion. A ring of fire expanded out, instantly engulfing the nearby area.If Sun Mo didn\u2019t move back, he would be drawn in.\u201cAh?\u201dLi Ziqi and Lu Zhiruo screamed in alarm.\u201cTeacher, I apologize!\u201dXuanyuan Po also didn\u2019t wish to use this move because it had to be used with spirit qi. It could be considered that he had broken the rule that he had set.However, if he stopped like that, his prideful heart wasn\u2019t willing to accept it.Xuanyuan Po knew that he couldn\u2019t win against Sun Mo, and he could accept this. But if his attacks weren\u2019t able to make Sun Mo take half-a-step back? There was no way he could accept this.After the explosion, Xuanyuan Po prepared to take the chance and attack. However, at the next instant, he was stupefied.Because Sun Mo didn\u2019t move back at all, he allowed the ring of fire to engulf him.\u201cTeacher!\u201dLi Ziqi and Lu Zhiruo both turned pale with fright.\u201cDoesn\u2019t he want face too much?\u201dTantai Yutang was speechless. From his point of view, Sun Mo completely had the time to dodge it. But by not doing so, it was evident that Sun Mo didn\u2019t want to lose face. However, at the next moment, Tantai Yutang\u2019s expression grew even more dumbfounded.Swish!Sun Mo dashed through the ring of fire and initiated an attack for the first time.Beauty Yu!Water Dragon Roar!Sun Mo\u2019s silhouette flickered and his movements became erratic but graceful. It was as though he was a river goddess using water rippling steps, moving in an ethereal fashion. His wooden blade slashed out, emitting a shrill noise like the cries of birds.\u201cWhat?\u201dTantai Yutang\u2019s eyes narrowed violently. Why was Sun Mo completely uninjured? However, an instant later, his eyes were completely drawn in by Sun Mo\u2019s martial skill.\u201cWhat skill is this? It\u2019s too magnificent and gorgeous!\u201dTantai Yutang had seen plenty of cultivation arts before, but he completely had no idea what Sun Mo had just executed.Sun Mo\u2019s wooden blade slashed out repeatedly, colliding into the silver spear!Eighteen Words Order!Pak! Pak! Pak!Strike after strike, the intensity was like a storm. The attacks caused Xuanyuan Po to stagger backward. He couldn\u2019t even hold his spear properly. The immense impact spread from the spear to him, causing slight cracks to appear on the web between his forefingers and thumbs.However, Xuanyuan Po couldn\u2019t care about this. His eyes were widened to the maximum, hoping to track Sun Mo\u2019s attack. It was good even if he could manage to block a single strike!But\u2026He couldn\u2019t see clearly!He couldn\u2019t see clearly!He couldn\u2019t see clearly!He couldn\u2019t see clearly at all!All of a sudden, the wooden blade curved through the air in a bizarre-looking arc and moved toward Xuanyuan Po\u2019s larynx. However, before it hit, the force behind it dissipated as the direction shifted. Xuanyuan Po only felt a rap on his head.The force of this blow was as light as a chicken feather. It was like the touch of a sweetheart.However, Xuanyuan Po\u2019s face turned green. Because he knew that if Sun Mo had exerted force, he would have died twice.In the eyes of the four other students, Xuanyuan Po was completely crushed and forced to retreat again and again in defeat. But in Sun Mo\u2019s eyes, every time before his wooden blade hit the body of this combat addict, there would be golden motes of light shooting out from Xuanyuan Po\u2019s head, slowly forming into golden pages.These golden pages shone radiantly and simply floated in the air.Sun Mo attacked, unleashing Immemorial Vairocana. All sorts of dazzling attacks landed on Xuanyuan Po.However, he made sure to control his strength and didn\u2019t injure Xuanyuan Po. His intention was to beat the Prairie Blazing Fire Spear Technique out of Xuanyuan Po.As to the fact earlier where Xuanyuan Po had suddenly used spirit qi and caused an explosion that almost injured him, Sun Mo could understand Xuanyuan Po\u2019s feelings. Hence, he wasn\u2019t angry. However, the punishment that ought to be given out still had to be given out.For someone like Xuanyuan Po, it was useless to talk to him about rules. One had to defeat him into submission.\u201cThe Invulnerable Golden Body is extremely impressive!\u201dEarlier, Sun Mo had used that technique precisely and managed to face the explosion head-on without injuries.He felt rueful as well as curious. Who was the owner of this wooden blade exactly? Why would it be abandoned in an old storage room of the Central Province Academy?There ought to be some secrets within it!Xuanyuan Po looked incomparably miserable. He wanted to counter-attack but couldn\u2019t find any chance to do so at all. Every time he wanted to attack, Sun Mo would increase his force and continue to suppress him.Such judgment abilities caused Xuanyuan Po to gasp in amazement.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIs this still something a human can do?\u201dWhen this thought appeared in Xuanyuan Po\u2019s mind, Sun Mo also heard a notification.Ding!Favorable impression points from Xuanyuan Po +20.

Hence, Sun Mo wasn\u2019t worried that his trump card would be exposed to the public. He could give it his all and unleash his ultimate skill.This feeling was like constantly abusing a weaker opponent in a fighting game. It was simply too awesome!If his opponent was any other student, Sun Mo wouldn\u2019t dare to do this. Li Ziqi, Lu Zhiruo, and the sickly Tantai Yutang would be utterly crushed.Jiang Leng might be able to withstand a few moves, but the amount of time he could persist for would definitely not be as long as Xuanyuan Po.This muscle brain combat-addict had a single plus point, and that was that he wouldn\u2019t concede. He was already abused to such a state, but he was still gritting his teeth and trying to find an opportunity to counter-attack.In terms of the will, he was truly very strong.Hence, Sun Mo could be at ease and continue the spar. Immemorial Vairocana was something that would grow with the more he used it.Sun Mo estimated that in the future, his chances of fighting would surely not be less. Hence, he treated Xuanyuan Po as a wooden pile to practice his martial skill.Mn!This was a wooden pile that was capable of moving.Naturally, Sun Mo didn\u2019t use his spirit qi from the start to the end. He depended on his wondrous moves to subdue Xuanyuan Po, and he also intentionally held back part of his strength to avoid injuring his student.\u201cBeautiful!\u201d\u201cBeautiful!\u201d\u201cTruly beautiful!\u201dLi Ziqi involuntarily praised. Even Tantai Yutang and Jiang Leng were nodding subconsciously. Sun Mo\u2019s martial skill, leaving aside its power level, just its magnificence and gorgeousness was already enough to shock people.His fighting style was like a beautiful dance at the end of a banquet, bringing extreme enjoyment to the viewers!Ding!Favorable impression points from Li Ziqi +15. Friendly (201/1,000).There was no need to talk about Lu Zhiruo. Her beautiful face was blushed due to her excitement.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +25. Friendly (443/1,000).In a space that couldn\u2019t be seen by the four students, golden pages would form above Xuanyuan Po\u2019s head as the wooden blade hit Xuanyuan Po again and again.In the end, Xuanyuan Po\u2019s defense broke down after being continuously hit. Those golden pages were like money with huge denominations flying over while creating whistling sounds.After another strike, Sun Mo halted.Thud! Thud! Thud!Xuanyuan Po continuously retreated over ten steps before he regained his footing.\u201cSatisfying!\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t an aboriginal of Middle-Earth Nine Provinces. In the past world, he had never experienced combat in his twenty-plus years of life. Hence, he wanted to stop but couldn\u2019t do so because he was addicted to this feeling.He truly didn\u2019t want to stop.However, if he continued fighting, he was worried Xuanyuan Po\u2019s spirit would be crushed to the extent where he began to doubt life. From then on, Xuanyuan Po might never be able to recover from this setback.Xuanyuan Po was unconvinced in his heart, but he no longer had the strength to retaliate. His hands were trembling continuously. After he tried moving a few times, his silver spear fell onto the ground with a clang.Xuanyuan Po\u2019s expression instantly darkened.\u201cThis is the first time my Silver Paste fell on the ground ever since I embarked on my martial path.\u201dXuanyuan Po had a look of disappointment on his face.The atmosphere felt a little heavy, but Tantai Yutang couldn\u2019t help but mock, \u201cWhat the hell is silver paste? Is that the name of that silver spear?\u201d\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ve lost!\u201dXuanyuan Po bent his waist and bowed. After that, he picked up his spear and took out a cotton cloth before slowly wiping it. He gritted his teeth and wanted to control his emotions. However, tears still flowed unbidden down his face.\u201cYou actually fought very well.\u201dSun Mo walked over and patted Xuanyuan Po on his shoulder. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m in the blood-ignition realm and am seven years older than you. If you won, would I still have any face left?\u201dSun Mo consoled.\u201cA loss is a loss. Teacher, there\u2019s no need to console me!\u201dXuanyuan Po raised his arm to wipe off his tears.\u201cTeacher is so impressive!\u201dTantai Yutang congratulated.Ding!Favorable impression points from Tantai Yutang +5. Neutral (7/100).\u201cTsk, my judgment was right. This fellow is really a good bootlicker!\u201dLi Ziqi cast a stealthy glance at Tantai Yutang.Jiang Leng didn\u2019t speak, but the number of favorable impression points he contributed wasn\u2019t small. It was also 25, the same as Lu Zhiruo.\u201cTeacher, what\u2019s the cultivation art you are using?\u201dTantai Yutang smiled as he asked.The other four students glanced at Sun Mo immediately. This was especially so for Xuanyuan Po. Not only was he looking at Sun Mo, but his ears were pricked up as well. He looked like a mouse who was sneaking around for food and listening for the footsteps of the house cat.\u201cI will tell you guys once you all reached my standard.\u201dSun Mo kept them in suspense.\u201cTsk, Teacher, that is so loathsome!\u201dTantai Yutang acted like he was someone with an amiable personality. Regardless of his tone or expression, he could instantly cause others to let down their guards and feel a connection with him.However, Sun Mo wasn\u2019t fooled. This brat was the most scheming one out of his five students. Also, his acting skills were so good that he gave people the chills.\u201cIt should be a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art!\u201d Xuanyuan Po suddenly spoke.Tantai Yutang\u2019s lips twitched while silently musing in his heart. \u2018Do you feel that peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation arts are like cabbages that can be found everywhere?\u2019 He had already investigated Sun Mo\u2019s background.Sun Mo\u2019s father was a genius of the Central Province Academy and was the old headmaster\u2019s favorite pupil. However, after entering the Darkness Continent and exploring an abandoned ruin, his father disappeared.Generally speaking, Sun Mo\u2019s father should be dead.Because of this accident, Sun Mo\u2019s father didn\u2019t even pass down his ultimate skill to Sun Mo. Hence, where would Sun Mo have learned a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art from?The Central Province Academy had a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art, and it was the school\u2019s ultimate treasure. However, only the headmaster of each generation could learn it. Because An Xinhui\u2019s father didn\u2019t become the academy\u2019s headmaster, let alone learn it, he hadn\u2019t even seen it before.For this, An Xinhui\u2019s father had even quarreled with her grandfather before. A huge commotion was caused and this incident spread throughout the entire teaching industry.\u201cYes!\u201dThis time around, Sun Mo didn\u2019t deny it. After all, he was a little vain too. If he wasn\u2019t strong enough and didn\u2019t have a powerful trump card, how would his students be willing to follow him?\u201cAs expected. No wonder I couldn\u2019t see through your moves!\u201dXuanyuan Po felt relieved. There was nothing to be upset about. In the future, he would put in more effort in training and simply fight until he won.\u201cBy acknowledging him as my teacher, can I be considered as having picked up a treasure?\u201dLi Ziqi silently mused.Peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation arts were very limited in number. Hence, being able to meet a teacher who knew one was extremely fortunate for her.\u201cHehe!\u201dTantai Yutang laughed softly. He silently mused, \u2018Even if Sun Mo knows one, he won\u2019t teach us. For a cultivation art of such level, even if we are his personal disciples, we won\u2019t have a chance to learn it before we have major contributions.\u2019After all, it was too precious.\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201dSun Mo suddenly turned to Tantai Yutang. He recalled the system\u2019s evaluation of this youth, saying that Tantai Yutang was a time bomb. Also, the system had given him a mission to get Tantai Yutang to truly recognize and acknowledge him as a teacher from the bottom of his heart, instead of just acknowledging him on the surface.\u201cI feel happy because I have a chance to learn your cultivation art in the future.\u201dTantai Yutang explained.\u201cMn!\u201dSun Mo laughed in his heart. He naturally wouldn\u2019t believe even the slightest bit of Tantai Yutang\u2019s words.\u201cHeh, have you felt the power of the time bomb yet?\u201d the system mocked.\u201cIs there any meaning to issue such a mission?\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. Tantai Yutang\u2019s attitude reminded him of those trouble-making students he had met back in the no. 2 high school.\u201cYes, this is a tempering exercise for you. Do you think any ordinary teacher can become a great teacher? What is a great teacher? They are people who can turn the impossible into the possible, transform rotten wood into something magical, and subdue those lofty and arrogant geniuses\u2026\u201dThe system explained.\u201cMaking a genius like that to willingly bow and acknowledge you is truly something to be proud of even if you are a great teacher,\u201d the system added.\u201cAs long as you guys work hard, I will teach it to you guys.\u201dIt was as though Sun Mo had taken out a cake. No matter what, he had to find some rewards to encourage his students to take the initiative in cultivating.The eyes of his five students immediately brightened. This was especially so for Xuanyuan Po. He even had to gulp down his saliva.(In any case, I don\u2019t believe it!)Tantan Yutang didn\u2019t have the slightest shred of belief with regards to Sun Mo\u2019s words.\u201cAiya, I recalled it!\u201d Lu Zhiruo suddenly called out.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Li Ziqi was concerned about her little junior sister.\u201cTeacher, the cultivation art you were practicing before me that time\u2026 Wasn\u2019t it precisely this?\u201d Lu Zhiruo speculated.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dSun Mo counter-asked. Although that wasn\u2019t the Immemorial Vairocana, it was also a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art.\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201dLu Zhiruo was emotionally moved. Although she was not very clever, she could still remember some of it.\u201cThat is the first level, practice well!\u201dSun Mo patted Lu Zhiruo on her head. He was truly fond of this pure little girl.Upon hearing this, Tantai Yutang\u2019s expression changed. Could it be that he had guessed wrongly? Was Sun Mo truly a generous and magnanimous good teacher?Speaking from his heart, Tantai Yutang would definitely be reluctant to teach anyone else a cultivation art of this level.\u201cI\u2026I will!\u201dLu Zhiruo was extremely moved.Ding!Favorable impression points from Lu Zhiruo +30. Friendly (473/1,000).Indeed, Sun Mo didn\u2019t place too much importance on a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art. Leaving aside that he knew two, no, it should be three counting the Prairie Blazing Fire Spear Technique. Even if he only knew one, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to teach it to his students.(If I told them that I possess three peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation arts, would they jump in fright?)(Wait a minute!)(With Immemorial Vairocana, in the future, wouldn\u2019t I be able to challenge cultivators who know these pinnacle cultivation arts, and learn them after beating the arts out of them?)(So, how is it only three?!)Naturally, he had to increase his combat strength before this. If not, if he was beaten to death by others, that would truly be too much of a loss.Sun Mo glanced at the floating golden pages in the air. With an exertion of his will, they flew toward him like pigeons returning home. They then automatically compiled into a book.On the cover, there were five huge words in radiant gold.[Prairie Blazing Fire Spear Technique]!\u201cNote: The Prairie Blazing Fire Spear Technique is a peerless-grade saint-tier cultivation art. This is \u2153 of it, a fragmented version.\u201dSun Mo\u2019s lips twitched. The efficiency of Immemorial Vairocana was simply too low. It seemed like he had to quickly gain more contribution points to buy time emblems and use them to increase his proficiency of this divine skill.As for cultivating it himself the traditional way?Sorry, Sun Mo had never thought about this before.Li Ziqi noticed Tantai Yutang\u2019s expression. Although she didn\u2019t show her feelings on her face, she had some bad opinions about him.This sickly person was truly scheming. Besides, he seemed to be mocking their teacher. Should she think of an idea to chase him away?Li Ziqi and Lu Zhiruo were crazy fans of Sun Mo.And adding to the fact that Sun Mo had obtained a crushing victory in his battle against Xuanyuan Po, Jiang Leng and the combat addict himself also felt very impressed by it. This caused the atmosphere of the tutorial lesson to become much more harmonious.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euReality was like that. If a teacher was capable, the students would definitely be convinced.Sun Mo was very satisfied when he saw the situation. He then began teaching his lesson.Note:[1] Wooden piles are blocks of wood with sticks sticking out used for chinese martial arts training.

    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - A Small GoalPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98: A Small GoalLordbluefireSun Mo got everyone to gather around into a small circle and sat down.Li Ziqi snatched away the seat to the left of Sun Mo. The countries in the nine provinces were the same as Huaxia\u2019s ancient days where the ones on the left were revered.Of course, the eldest martial sister would have to be ranked first.Lu Zhiruo lowered her head and sat down on Sun Mo\u2019s right side, her hand clutching onto his sleeves.Although the papaya girl didn\u2019t say anything, everyone else, except for Xuanyuan Po whose brain was filled with nothing but muscles, understood what she meant. \u2018I\u2019m just going to be sitting next to Teacher. I won\u2019t budge no matter what.\u2019Both Jiang Leng and Xuanyuan Po casually found a seat. Tantai Yutang was left and his seat happened to be directly facing Sun Mo.\u201cIn the future, everyone will be studying together under me. We\u2019ll do a round of introduction to get to know each other!\u201dSun Mo looked around and quietly observed everyone\u2019s expression.Li Ziqi was also assessing the others.\u201cJust share your interests, specialties, as well as your future goals.\u201dSun Mo lowered the requirements. It would be asking for too much to get people who were meeting each other for the first time to talk without any restraints.\u201cI\u2019m the eldest martial sister, I\u2019ll go first!\u201dLi Ziqi raised her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Li Ziqi, 13 years old. I like everything and want to try everything. My specialty? It should be memorizing stuff!\u201d\u201cHmm? That\u2019s such a coincidence. I\u2019m good at memorizing stuff too!\u201dTantai Yutang blinked.\u201cHehe!\u201dLi Ziqi was thinking in her heart. (I can remember everything I\u2019ve taken a glance of. Can you do that? When I was six, I had already memorized close to one million books in the Hall of Worthies.)That was right, she hadn\u2019t just read them. She had completely memorized and remembered them.\u201cContinue!\u201dTantai Yutang understood the confidence in Li Ziqi\u2019s eyes, but he didn\u2019t rebut. They\u2019d be able to find out in the future.\u201cGoal?\u201dLi Ziqi frowned slightly. After taking a look at Sun Mo, she spoke up, \u201cI wish to build the biggest library in Middle-Earth. As long as they are books in the nine provinces, they could be found there!\u201dThis goal was very surprising to be honest. Putting aside Tantai Yutang and the other three, even the battle freak Xuanyuan Po couldn\u2019t help but assess Li Ziqi with a serious gaze for the first time.\u201cIt\u2019s a great goal!\u201dSun Mo clapped.A librarian was a legendary occupation!\u201cDon\u2019t you think that I don\u2019t have a serious goal?\u201d Li Ziqi asked doubtfully.To the people in the nine provinces, one should work hard in their cultivation and pursue the extremity of power, shattering space and attaining immortality. The other option was to become a saint of a generation. Only then would it mean that their life hadn\u2019t been wasted.Li Ziqi\u2019s goal had diverted from the values that the mainstream society had.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201dSun Mo smiled. \u201cCompared with following the crowd, I admire you for having your own goal!\u201dSun Mo could tell that Li Ziqi wasn\u2019t joking.\u201cHehe!\u201dLi Ziqi was very happy.This was the first time that someone had complimented her. She had shared her dream with her father and aunt in the past, but they were clearly dissatisfied with her even though they hadn\u2019t scolded her.\u201cZhiruo is next!\u201dSun Mo said.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201dLu Zhiruo mumbled with a soft mosquito-like voice. After raising her head to take a quick glance, she immediately lowered her head again, dawdling and wanting to hide behind Sun Mo.Sun Mo shook his head. The papaya girl was shy. Given her character, how was she going to survive in the future? Was she going to coop herself up at home all the time?(I know you have big busts, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you can do things as you wish to this degree.)\u201cIf you can\u2019t do a self-introduction, I\u2019ll chase you out of my wings!\u201dSun Mo threatened.\u201cNo!\u201dThe innocent papaya girl clearly believed his words and her expression appeared anxious. Her eyes had turned a little red and there were tears in them.\u201cThen do a self-introduction!\u201dSun Mo had met quite a number of students with such mental barriers. The way to overcome it was to take the first step.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m called\u2026 Lu Zhiruo.\u201dThe papaya girl mumbled.\u201cLouder!\u201dSun Mo frowned.\u201cMy interests are to feed cats, listen to birds singing, and talk to plants.\u201dLu Zhiruo\u2019s words caused everyone to be stunned. Even Jiang Leng, who seemed as cold as a corpse and didn\u2019t have any friends, started to pity her.\u201cAren\u2019t you too lonely? Even someone like me has two friends!\u201dXuanyuan Po was speechless. \u201cAre those considered interests? It just means that you have no friends and can only play with plants. If it gets worse, even cats and dogs might despise you.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t. Cats like to eat the food I feed them!\u201dLu Zhiruo retorted. After saying that, she quickly lowered her head again, tugging so hard at her sleeves that her joints seemed to be turning pale.\u201cWhat are your specialties?\u201dLi Ziqi tried to save the situation.\u201cTo\u2026 to speak with small animals!\u201d Lu Zhiruo replied.Jiang Leng raised his hand slightly, wanting to pat the papaya girl\u2019s shoulder to console her. However, at the thought that guys and girls should keep their distances, he put down his hand again.\u201cOh, I have good instincts, and\u2026 and, there are times when I can hear sounds that other people can\u2019t.\u201dLu Zhiruo was worried that she\u2019d be looked down upon and tried hard to think of things she was good at.\u201cWas it your invisible friends talking?\u201dTantai Yutang sneered.Li Ziqi immediately glared at the sickly guy, giving him a warning gaze to indicate him to shut up.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201dSun Mo patted the papaya girl\u2019s head.Lu Zhiruo, who had been encouraged, wore a hint of a smile. \u201cMy goal is\u2026 to become someone my father can be proud of.\u201dAfter saying this, Lu Zhiruo seemed to have expended all of her energy. Her shoulders sagged down and she lowered her head, secretly inching closer toward Sun Mo.Sun Mo clapped.It was Xuanyuan Po\u2019s turn. There wasn\u2019t a need for Sun Mo to remind him.\u201cXuanyuan Po, 14 years old, likes to fight, specializes in fighting. My future goal is to become the number one Spear Saint in the nine provinces!\u201dXuanyuan Po kept his words simple, not straying away from fighting.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t your future goal to be a king of fighting?\u201dTantai Yutang couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cIs there a difference? If I don\u2019t become a king of fighting, how am I going to become the number one Spear Saint?\u201d Xuanyuan Po asked.(Battle freaks with only muscles are so scary. They can\u2019t even tell that others are ridiculing them.)Li Ziqi pouted as she thought that if she were to tell Xuanyuan Po that Tantai Yutang was ridiculing him, she wondered if he would beat up this sickly guy until his head broke?After giving it some thought, Li Ziqi felt that it was very likely.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn!\u201dTantai Yutang looked at Jiang Leng and diverted the topic.\u201cJiang Leng, 12 years old.\u201dEveryone was waiting for Jiang Leng\u2019s self-introduction.To be honest, from just the scrawled out \u2018trash\u2019 word on his forehead and the battered spirit runes on his body, he was clearly a young man with a story.\u201cGo on!\u201d Li Ziqi urged.\u201cThat\u2019s all!\u201d Jiang Leng replied.\u201cHuh? That\u2019s all? What are your interests? Your specialties?\u201dTantai Yutang was speechless. (Don\u2019t you feel inferior for being so short despite being a guy?)Jiang Leng gave it some thought before saying, \u201cJiang Leng, 12 years old!\u201dLi Ziqi pinched her forehead. This fourth martial junior\u2019s brain couldn\u2019t have been spoiled because he had received too big of a blow, right?\u201cTantai, it\u2019s your turn now!\u201d Sun Mo said.\u201cTantai Yutang, 14 years old. No interests. Am good at everything except battling. As for my goal, it\u2019s currently to live until 15 years old.\u201dThis self-introduction was very simple, but when he said the last line, the entire atmosphere changed.\u201cHuh?\u201dLu Zhiruo counted and said, \u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re left with less than a year of lifespan?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dTantai Yutang nodded.No one knew how to continue the conversation from there. The atmosphere had also gotten a lot heavier.\u201cGood luck, you can do it!\u201d Xuanyuan Po encouraged.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I must live an extraordinarily happy life in these last few months!\u201d Tantai Yutang put up a thumb.\u201cSystem, is this guy joking?\u201dAs Sun Mo asked this, he also activated the Divine Sight.Tantai Yutang, level one body-refinement realm.Strength 3. As a sickly person, pale skin and weak body are the aesthetics.Intellect 10. I don\u2019t wish to play with monkeys.Agility 3. Only by moving slower on the journey in life would one be able to enjoy the beautiful scenery.Endurance 2. It\u2019s so tiring. I feel like turning into a moldy mushroom and growing on a bed.Will 9. I still can\u2019t die!\u2026Potential value: extremely high!Remark: life vitalities are continuously weakening.\u201cIt\u2019s a lie that he can only live for a few more months, but he definitely won\u2019t be able to live longer than one to two years,\u201d the system replied.\u201cCome over here!\u201d Sun Mo instructed.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dAlthough Tantai Yutang asked this, given his intellect, he immediately thought that Sun Mo was planning to use the Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands to give him a checkup. A small ripple uncontrollably rose in his heart.If it was possible, who would be willing to die early?Sun Mo placed his hand on Tantai Yutang\u2019s shoulder and then slid it down. His grandmaster-grade Muscleforge Technique and expert-grade Circulation Technique allowed him to obtain a lot of data very quickly.This body was really horrible, like a piece of moldy bread.\u201cYour body isn\u2019t suitable for cultivation nor mental work. If you lay down quietly every day, you\u2019ll be able to live slightly longer,\u201d Sun Mo suggested.\u201cLie down? Then what meaning would there be in life?\u201d Tantai Yutang said in self-ridicule.\u201cTeacher, aren\u2019t you able to do anything about this?\u201dLu Zhiruo felt that although Tantai Yutang was very scary, she couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for him at the thought that he\u2019d die.\u201cThere\u2019s no other way out. His problem is probably in his blood, and his body keeps giving me a strange feeling.\u201dSun Mo frowned. The ancient massage technique wouldn\u2019t be able to work this time around and couldn\u2019t be used to resolve Tantai Yutang\u2019s symptoms. The most that it could do was relieving a little of his pain.Although Tantai Yutang seemed very calm, Sun Mo knew that this kid was constantly withstanding pain at every moment.It was no wonder that his will was at 9. Being tortured by sickness every day in this manner, one\u2019s nerves would be steeled as long as they didn\u2019t collapse.Hearing Sun Mo\u2019s reply, a hint of surprise flashed on Tantai Yutang\u2019s face. He then looked toward Sun Mo\u2019s hands. They were long, slender, and clean.Of course, the most important thing was that they were mysterious!Tantai Yutang had sought treatment from many doctors, but all of them couldn\u2019t do anything. Most of them couldn\u2019t even find the root of his conditions and could only make guesses.However, Sun Mo had only touched him for a little before finding out. This was too much of an exaggeration!\u201cCould he really have God Hands?\u201dTantai Yutang felt curious.Ding!+1 favorable impression points from Tantai Yutang. Neutral (8/100).\u201cDon\u2019t give up yet. If you have a chance, you can look for that Medical Saint Sun. I heard that he\u2019s very interested in rare illnesses and doesn\u2019t charge anything. He\u2019ll offer medical advice for free.\u201dLi Ziqi consoled him.\u201cI did!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTantai Yutang\u2019s reply caused Li Ziqi to be stumped.(Are we able to have a pleasant chat? I\u2019m trying to console you here!)Li Ziqi felt upset and decided to not say anything.Sun Mo wasn\u2019t a doctor and couldn\u2019t help in such matters. He could only offer his pity. After consoling Tantai Yutang for a little, he planned on continuing the lesson. However, the system\u2019s notification suddenly rang out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The prize will be one silver treasure chest. If you fail, there will be an appropriate punishment given according to the degree of incompletion.\u201d\u201cOh f*ck!Sun Mo burst into vulgarities as this was something he couldn\u2019t tolerate. \u201cDo you think breaking through a level is like eating? Even if you\u2019re not hungry you can still stuff a few mouthfuls of food? This is breaking through cultivation level, and it requires incessant practices and quantitative changes to lead to qualitative changes.\u201d\u201cAs the words great teacher suggest, you have to change impossibilities to possibilities. If students were able to break through a cultivation level easily, what do they need a teacher for?\u201dThe system would never take back its mission.\u201cDon\u2019t play this trick with me!\u201dSun Mo was no longer that country bumpkin who had just arrived at Middle Earth Nine Provinces.After having spent a decent time in the library, he had gained some detailed understanding of cultivation.For a matter like breaking through, it couldn\u2019t be rushed. Only when you had persevered and cultivated persistently would success follow.Moreover, the timing wasn\u2019t like a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle, no one would be able to predict when it would arrive.\u201cI have to remind you. If you\u2019re thinking of letting them consume peak-grade medicine, etc\u2026 it will be considered cheating and it\u2019s prohibited by the system\u2019s order. Once you\u2019re discovered, you\u2019ll receive severe punishment,\u201d the system warned.Sun Mo rolled his eyes. Let\u2019s not talk about the fact that he was too poor to purchase peak-grade medicine, even if he could afford it, he wouldn\u2019t do such a thing either.Any kind of medicine would have some form of side effects. Even if one couldn\u2019t sense it now, when they reached a higher realm in the future, they would experience it in one way or another.After several tens of thousands of years, the aboriginals of Nine Provinces had already had a deep understanding of cultivation.If one didn\u2019t lay a solid foundation, after they reached a high cultivation level in the future, breaking through levels would become even harder.Certainly, those medicines that were grown naturally and could give huge supplementary effects had no side effects. For example, the Starmoon Fruit that Sun Mo had received previously.\u201cTeacher?\u201dSeeing how Sun Mo stopped talking suddenly, Li Ziqi was a little worried.\u201cLet\u2019s continue, Xuanyuan Po come over here.\u201dAfter Sun Mo had touched him with his hands, he didn\u2019t know what to say other than being surprised.This fella was so strong that he couldn\u2019t become any stronger.His blood surged like a powerful current and his bones were as solid as steel. Every cell in his body was filled with surging energy.\u201cHow\u2019s everything?\u201d Xuanyuan Po inquired.\u201cYour body, is it really a human\u2019s body?\u201dWhen compared to Tantai Yutang, who was like a flame about to be blown out by the breeze at any moment, Xuanyuan Po was like a volcano that was bursting with vitality.Xuanyuan Po\u2019s expression changed and he shouted, \u201cHow am I not a human?\u201dAs Xuanyuan Po was speaking, he even opened up Sun Mo\u2019s hands.\u201cXuanyuan Po, teacher was just making(beating) up an analogy, do you know what an analogy is?\u201dLi Ziqi explained, but she reckoned Xuanyuan Po wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201cWho is \u2018analogy\u2019?\u201dXuanyuan Po was indeed frowning. \u201cWhy must we beat him up?\u201dLi Ziqi held onto her forehead speechlessly. Among the personal disciples of Sun Mo\u2019s, Xuanyuan Po\u2019s aptitude should\u2019ve been the highest and even the strongest in combat. However, she was afraid that his brain was the stupidest.\u201cEh? Isn\u2019t analogy a form of rhetoric? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s a person?\u201dLu Zhiruo was stunned.\u201cAlright, it seems there\u2019s not much difference between him and the papaya girl!\u201dLi Ziqi shot a glance at Sun Mo. (Teacher\u2019s teaching path would surely be a difficult one.) She hoped that he wouldn\u2019t be stumbled until his teeth were knocked out.\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay to just continue cultivating according to your current cultivation intensity!\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t have anything else to add.Next was Jiang Leng. Even though Sun Mo already had a premonition that his health wasn\u2019t too good, after touching it, he couldn\u2019t help but feel astonished.How was this just not good? It simply couldn\u2019t be of any use.Because those shattered spirit runes had interfered with Jiang Leng\u2019s ability to absorb spirit qi, his body was like a piece of land that had been devastated by ten tornadoes, heavily damaged.If he wanted to break through his level now, he must be able to absorb spirit qi.After a normal cultivator had absorbed spirit qi, it would flow along the veins throughout the body. However, it was impossible for Jiang Leng.Once the spirit qi had entered his body, it would be interfered by those spirit runes and would flow backward.These spirit runes were like reefs and would hinder spirit qi from circulating normally, which in turn caused many turbulent qi currents.When spirit qi flowed in a random manner within the body, even a moron would know what terrifying effect it would cause.\u201cIf you wish to continue living, then stop cultivating for the time being!\u201dSun Mo warned solemnly.Even though he already knew the answer, hearing it from Sun Mo\u2019s mouth still made Jiang Leng feel very disappointed. He had indeed become a useless person.Thinking of this, Jiang Leng smiled with sorrow. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful that you have taken me in as your disciple, but a useless person like me will only bring disgrace to your fame. You had better expel me from your affiliation!\u201dLooking at Jiang Leng\u2019s disappointed mood and how his willpower had begun to drop, Sun Mo could only advise him with kind words to give him some confidence.\u201cDon\u2019t give up, maybe there\u2019s still a way!\u201dSun Mo thought in his heart. He was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be able to complete the mission this time around. He couldn\u2019t possibly be forcing Jiang Leng to cultivate, right? That would only harm him!Also, it was already exhausting for Tantai Yutang to stay alive, how could he have the energy to break through levels? As for Li Ziqi and Lu Zhiruo, one\u2019s athletic ability was nearly 0, while another\u2019s potential value was extremely low. Sun Mo could already expect what the result was going to be.\u201cThe punishment for this mission\u2019s failure, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019d be unavoidable.\u201dEven though Sun Mo was laughing at himself, he did not give up.For the following period, Sun Mo allowed the 5 students to ask questions regarding the difficulties they were currently facing during cultivation.Sun Mo had prepared himself for the humiliation of not being able to answer their questions, but Jiang Leng didn\u2019t even open his mouth to speak. Li Ziqi couldn\u2019t bear to be hard on Sun Mo, while Lu Zhiruo was like a little tail seating obediently next to Sun Mo.Tantai Yutang, who had the remark of a time bomb, no one knew what he was thinking. He was holding onto a handkerchief to cover his mouth. And other than occasionally coughing a few times, he didn\u2019t speak.Fortunately, Xuanyuan Po had a lot of questions, but they were all about fundamental knowledge.Any graduate, whose graduation certificate was real, would be able to give tell him the answers.\u201cSo that\u2019s what it was!\u201dXuanyuan Po let out expressions of sudden realization repeatedly.\u201cAre you a barbarian living in the deep mountains? These questions, just go to the main street and purchase a few cultivation books, and you\u2019d be able to find the answers.\u201dLi Ziqi was speechless.She already knew the answers to these questions when she was 5 years old.Dong! Dong! Dong!It was noon and the bell for classes to end rang.\u201cFinally, the class has ended!\u201dLi Ziqi cheered in her heart and jumped up immediately. \u201cToday is our first gathering, why don\u2019t we go and have a meal together?\u201dSun Mo didn\u2019t appear rich; hence, Li Ziqi had prepared to secretly get the bill while they were still eating.\u201cHow will the courses be arranged in the future?\u201dTantai Yutang looked toward Sun Mo.\u201cThis is the timetable that the school has prepared for me!\u201dSun Mo took out 5 pieces of timetable that he had prepared. He handed them over to his students.\u201cCome attend if you guys are interested. If not, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll not insist on it. As for the tutorials, once every 3 days, 10 sessions every month, I\u2019ve already written the timings.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care what reasons you guys have, but you must be there at the tutorials. Even if you\u2019re sick, you have to come crawling!\u201dWhen he was saying this sentence, Sun Mo\u2019s tone became stricter.Rules had to be set from the beginning so that it would become a habit. Otherwise, once the students had gotten used to being lazy, it would be harder to start disciplining them then.\u201cTeacher, do you have something against me?\u201dTantai Yutang laughed bitterly.\u201cDo you want me to give you special treatment?\u201d Sun Mo asked in reply.\u201cErrr!\u201dTantai Yutang was stumped by this question. Honestly, he had strong self-esteem and loathed being pitied by others. Sun Mo\u2019s words, on the contrary, made him feel happy.Ding!Favorable impression points from Tantai Yutang +5, Neutral (13/100).Hearing the system\u2019s notification, Sun Mo was speechless. This had earned him some favorable impression points? This Tantai Yutang was indeed crazy!\u201cIf you guys have any questions, you can come to look for me any time.\u201dSun Mo looked at his 5 students. \u201cWhether it is about cultivation, life, or even feelings, I\u2019ll try my best to give you an answer.\u201dIn the various countries of Nine Provinces, once a student had acknowledged a master, the latter would be like half a father to the former. Hence, it was a must for Sun Mo to say those words.If the students were thick-skinned enough to come and cadge meals daily, then Sun Mo had to tolerate it as well. If he dared to have any word of complaint, his reputation would be ruined.Hence, this was also the reason why teachers were so cautious in selecting disciples.In a teacher\u2019s heart, a good student didn\u2019t just mean having a good aptitude. They should also have good moral conduct. If a teacher were to recruit a rebellious disciple, the teacher would definitely be vexed for a lifetime.Li Ziqi stood up. \u201cAlright, we\u2019re done with the proper business, let\u2019s go have a meal now!\u201d\u201cSorry, I have something on later!\u201d Tantai Yutang took his leave.\u201cI\u2019ve gained much knowledge today, I\u2019ve to go fight now to digest it!\u201d Xuanyuan Po left.Ding!Favorable impression points from Xuanyuan Po +10, Neutral (31/100).Jiang Leng didn\u2019t say anything and left immediately.\u201cUgh!\u201dLi Ziqi\u2019s mouth started twitching and she was getting angry. (You guys are actually leaving just like that? Don\u2019t I, the eldest martial sister, need some face?)Ding!\u201cCongratulations, your performance was not bad for your first tutorial. I hereby give you an accomplishment prize of one mysterious treasure chest. Congratulations on your first milestone on your path, please continue to work hard!\u201dAlong with the notification from the system, a big treasure chest enshrouded with a purple halo fell in front of Sun Mo.Sun Mo seized the opportunity and touched the papaya girl\u2019s head. After counting to 8, he murmured \u2018Open!\u2019 in his heart.The mysterious treasure chest opened in response. After the elegant and luxurious brilliance had dispersed, a fruit the size of a walnut was left behind.The fruit emitted golden rays of light and had an uneven surface. Its texture appeared to be a combination of half metal and half colored glass.Ding!\u201cCongratulations on receiving a Diamond Fruit. This product is worth 3,000 favorable impression points in the system market. After consuming it, you can compact your body once again to upgrade its inner quality, allowing you to yield a qualitative leap.\u201d\u201cIn simple words, you will become even stronger!\u201d the system said.\u201cI won\u2019t become bald, will I?\u201dSun Mo made a joke.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIf not for the two female students present and an image to keep, Sun Mo would want to blow a whistle out of happiness!There wasn\u2019t even a need to read that huge chunk of explanation for Diamond Fruit. As long as he knew that it was worth 3,000 favorable impression points, that was a big earn for him!One must know that Sun Mo had been working hard for so long but had never earned as much as 3,000 favorable impression points!\u201cTeacher, I want to experience your Ancient Dragon Capturing Hands!\u201dSeeing that there wasn\u2019t any outsider around, Li Ziqi raised a tiny request.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Colleagues\u2019 ExclamationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: Colleagues\u2019 ExclamationLordbluefireIt was already a major event in life for an ordinary student to acknowledge master, let alone for students like Li Ziqi. For a genius, acknowledging a master was of utmost importance and must be cautiously selected.Li Ziqi\u2019s father had selected a secondary saint as a teacher for Li Ziqi, but it was a pity that her athletic ability was almost 0. On the road of cultivation, she practically didn\u2019t have any speakable prospects. Hence, she wasn\u2019t preferred by the secondary saint and had been rejected.From then on, Li Ziqi started to feel depressed and extremely against the matter of acknowledging a master. It was only until she went to the outskirts of Jinling for some relaxation and met Sun Mo at Yunting Lake that she was convinced by his words of \u2018if your heart is at peace, you\u2019ll not be afraid of trials and hardships\u2019.That priceless advice had immediately lit up Li Ziqi\u2019s gloomy life, causing her to reveal her smiling face once again.With Li Ziqi\u2019s status, even if she couldn\u2019t acknowledge a secondary saint as a master, acknowledging a 9-star great teacher was of no issue. If not, she could also select a 6-star or 7-star great teacher as she wished, yet she had chosen Sun Mo secretly.How many stars did Sun Mo hold?No star!Fortunately, he had been officially employed. If he were still holding onto the title of intern teacher, Li Ziqi reckoned that her older male cousin would break her leg apart.The matter of her acknowledging a master couldn\u2019t be covered up any longer. Hence, before that, she must quickly cultivate and gain some achievements.At that time, even if her paternal aunt were to question her, she could also answer with conviction that Sun Mo was an awesome teacher who was able to help her to grow.This way, perhaps Sun Mo could receive the acknowledgment from her paternal aunt.Hence, even though Li Ziqi didn\u2019t want to let that golden musculous figure, who was wearing a purple-cloth turban, knead and pinch her body, in order to deal with her paternal aunt, she had to bear with it.\u201cAlright!\u201dThis was absolutely a small matter. Moreover, Sun Mo had prepared to massage his students successively.\u201cHow about tomorrow afternoon?\u201dLi Ziqi set a time. After all, Sun Mo\u2019s massage was different from the kind of commonly seen massage. She needed to do some preparation as well.At least, a quiet and secluded location was necessary to have.\u201cSure!\u201dSun Mo looked up toward the sun. \u201cYou guys go eat. I won\u2019t be joining as I\u2019ve something to attend to. Zhiruo, take my teacher\u2019s badge with you and order whatever you want to eat. You don\u2019t have to save money for me.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201dLu Zhiruo nodded.Seeing how Sun Mo left with quick steps and didn\u2019t even give herself a chance to suggest something else, Li Ziqi let out a sigh. The first communal meal for all was declared a failure.\u2026Diamond Fruit, worth 3,000 favorable impression points.Because Sun Mo wanted to find out how many upgrades the fruit could give him, he went to the combat strength dojo to beat up a bronze man and test his combat strength.Since it was lunchtime, there wouldn\u2019t be many people. However, Sun Mo still ran into a \u2018colleague\u2019.\u201cHi, Teacher Sun!\u201dDu Xiao greeted.\u201cTeacher Du!\u201dSun Mo showed a smile meant for socializing purposes. As long as the one before him wasn\u2019t a colleague with difficult temperaments, Sun Mo would be alright.\u201cDo you also like to come at noon to test your strength when there are not many people around?\u201dDu Xiao walked over.\u201cI\u2019m scared of noise!\u201dSun Mo shrugged his shoulders.This woman, over twenty years old with an average look, was wearing a teacher\u2019s long robe in azure color. Sun Mo had seen her once when he had gone to the office to familiarize himself with the environment, but he hadn\u2019t managed to speak to her.\u201cI\u2019m scared of the noise too!\u201dDu Xiao laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not disturbing you, am I?\u201dSun Mo could only smile, what else could he have said?(You\u2019re disturbing me, please leave?) She would definitely bear grudges, and this colleague relationship would basically be done for.Du Xiao similarly responded with a smile.She had come to Central Province Academy and worked here for 3 years now. Even if she had poor EQ then, she must have learned something after all these years.Seeing Sun Mo\u2019s expression, Du Xiao knew that the most thoughtful way of handling things was to leave. However, she didn\u2019t, because she wanted to experience Sun Mo\u2019s \u2018God Hands\u2019.Du Xiao didn\u2019t go to Sun Mo\u2019s first public lecture, but Jiang Yongnian and Zhou Shanyi, who were in the same office as her, did.Jiang Yongnian was a chatter. Once he came back, he added so many details while telling them what had happened during the lecture that day.Regarding the matters of how Sun Mo had managed to put Zhou Yong, the campus tyrant, in his place and won the appointed battle with Feng Zewen, as well as having offended Vice-headmaster Zhang, Du Xiao was not concerned. She only wanted to find out if Sun Mo\u2019s \u2018God Hands\u2019 was indeed so formidable!Du Xiao had been employed for 3 years now and had comprehended 3 great teacher halos. She was also aware that her secondary occupation had reached a certain standard. Hence, she was preparing for the \u20181-star Great Teacher\u2019 examination.In this kind of examination, it was best if one was to succeed on the first try.Not to mention that it would boost one\u2019s self-confidence, even one\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 would become better-looking. For those teachers who had to retake the examination a few times, even if they were able to get a qualification certificate, they basically wouldn\u2019t be able to go to a famous school with better ranking.Without it, one\u2019s standards would be plummet.This situation was already an unspoken rule in the great teachers world. That was why Du Xiao wanted to let Sun Mo \u2018touch\u2019 her.For a matter like this, one must not ask for it immediately. If Du Xiao was rejected by any chance, how embarrassed would she be? Hence, she had planned to interact for a while to get a sense of Sun Mo\u2019s character and temperament first. After they had a good colleague relationship, it would be easier for her to ask him for a favor.After Sun Mo did a few rounds of deep breathing, he exerted all his force and attacked the chest of a combat bronze man with his fist.These bronze men were 3 meters tall and entirely made of bronze that was extracted from uncommon metal found in the Darkness Continent. They were forged according to a secret technique that was excavated from historical remains.Cultivators could get a sense of their own combat strength by attacking these bronze men. Even though there might be some inaccuracy, it wasn\u2019t huge.Bang!The bronze man produced a loud rumbling sound but didn\u2019t move a single inch.Du Xiao\u2019s vision landed on the abdomen of the bronze man. After a few seconds, the gold dust around the dantian formed a pattern and stabilized.\u201c310.\u201dDu Xiao had memorized the conversion table of patterns and numerical value. Seeing that it was 310, she felt calmness in her heart, along with a trace of superiority as though she was an excellent-grade student.\u201cBelow average standard!\u201dWhen Du Xiao was at the first level of the blood-ignition realm, her fist could exert much greater power than this.At the ninth level of the body-refinement realm, when the numerical value of combat strength gradually increased and broke through 100, it would signify that one had stepped into the spirit-refinement realm. At this level, there was no fixed standard for a realm. As long as all the 108 acupoints were opened up, one could then step into the blood-ignition realm.The combat strength of the spirit-refinement realm cultivators was between 100-300. After that, it would be the blood-ignition realm.The peak combat strength at the first level of the blood-ignition realm was at 400, second level at 500, so on and so forth. In the blood-ignition realm, cultivators needed to ignite their blood seven times to break through into the divine force realm.The peak combat strength in the blood-ignition realm was 1,000.Pffft!Even though Sun Mo knew that his combat strength wouldn\u2019t be too high, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh looking at this numerical value. What a miscellaneous level this was!However, Sun Mo wasn\u2019t surprised at all since this attack\u2019s numerical value was depending purely on brute force.Not to mention fist techniques, Sun Mo didn\u2019t even understand any simple technique for strength development.Swoosh!Sun Mo pulled his wooden blade out and thought about the battle in the morning against those 2 intern teachers. He then proceeded to duplicate those moves and perform them.Golden Sun Annihilation.Bang!The wooden blade slashed onto the chest of the bronze man.After ten over seconds, the pattern stabilized.\u201c330!\u201dDu Xiao curled her lips as she was familiar with this move. It was a peerless-grade earth-tier cultivation art, one of the masterstrokes in the Golden Sun Sword Manual, and its might was considerably good.In the first level of the blood-ignition realm, 330 combat strength was an average standard. If Sun Mo was using an ordinary move and got this numerical value, it was considered pretty good. But if he was using a masterstroke, then the value was really insufficient.After all, a masterstroke was a trump card that decided victory or defeat. To speak the truth, Sun Mo\u2019s combat strength wasn\u2019t sufficient at all.Sun Mo shook his head and flung his arm. He then moved forward and stabbed with his wooden blade.Gale Shooting Moon!Ding!The wooden blade stabbed onto the center of the bronze man.After the pattern stabilized, it represented a numerical value of 326, even lesser than the previous attack.\u201cTeacher Sun, both of these skills are pretty good, but you\u2019re still more suitable for those sword techniques in the Golden Sun Sword Manual that comprises big opening and closing actions. For a technique like Gale Sword Art, there\u2019s a requirement for both speed and reaction.\u201dDu Xiao raised a suggestion out of goodwill.She could see that during both times of attack, Sun Mo had exerted all his force. Since it meant that his main strength was the power of his force, he should be focusing on practicing these kinds of cultivation arts.Du Xiao wasn\u2019t aware that it was only the second time Sun Mo was using these 2 moves. If he were to continue practicing for a few more months, the destructive power would be even higher.Of course, Sun Mo would never practice it. It wasn\u2019t worth it.\u201cLet me try other moves!\u201dSun Mo wasn\u2019t angry because he had been criticized. He wasn\u2019t such a petty person. Moreover, this was a normal discussion between teachers.After Sun Mo had taken in a few more deep breaths and adjusted his state, he waved his blade.Eighteen Words Order!Pow Pow Pow!The wooden blade struck the bronze man intensively.For a moment, the exploding sounds were unceasing.When Sun Mo waved his blade, Du Xiao\u2019s expression changed. After all, she was a teacher and had a pretty good ability to make discerning judgments. She could see from Sun Mo\u2019s imposing manner and the proficiency index of his moves that he had immediately risen at least 2 tiers as compared to before.Also, this move was so exquisite!Du Xiao was dumbfounded. After watching, she started to ponder. If she fought against Sun Mo, how would she defend or unravel this move?Then, she realized that she couldn\u2019t understand the moves. In other words, she wanted to watch them one more time.The pattern gradually stabilized.\u201c360?\u201dSun Mo shook his head in dissatisfaction. This was the numerical value of a divine skill, how could it be so small?\u201cBe content, the main use of Immemorial Vairocana is to attack your opponent until you see his cultivation arts. It\u2019s not even for you to combat with.\u201dThe system was speechless. Sun Mo was actually looking down on a divine skill? How hateful!\u201cThen why don\u2019t you give me a set of cultivation art used for combat and fighting?\u201dSun Mo was even more speechless. Even if it was Grand Universe Formless Divine Art, the main usage was also to train his students; it wasn\u2019t suitable for combat!However, to use it against ordinary teachers, it would definitely be sufficient. When dealing with those talents such as Liu Mubai, Sun Mo still thought it would be better for him to learn a set of cultivation art that specialized in combat.\u201cPlease work harder to accumulate favorable impression points and purchase it from the system shopping store!\u201dThe system introduced, \u201cThere\u2019s everything that you want here. Also, I\u2019m conveniently telling you that any set of saint-tier cultivation art will cost at least 100,000 favorable impression points.\u201d\u201cThen why are you even saying this rubbish?\u201dSun Mo was unhappy as he couldn\u2019t even afford it.When Sun Mo was talking nonsense with the system, Du Xiao who was standing at the side was absolutely stunned. Just what kind of cultivation art was this? How could it let Sun Mo\u2019s combat strength rise to 360?The Golden Sun Sword Manual belonged to the peerless-grade earth-tier. Hence, this move certainly came from a heaven-tier cultivation art. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be able to bring about such a huge increase in his combat strength.If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that as a teacher, Du Xiao had to act reserved, she would want to inquire about the cultivation art\u2019s name from Sun Mo. In her inner heart, she could feel a trace of envy surfacing.A good cultivation art was indeed formidable. Not only was it able to fully trigger a cultivator\u2019s combat strength, but it could even double the growth rate.\u201cTeacher Du, I\u2019ll be taking my leave!\u201dSun Mo bade goodbye politely.\u201cOh, take care Teacher Sun!\u201dDu Xiao waited until Sun Mo had left before starting to make her moves and train. Sun Mo was already so formidable. If he rose to her cultivation level, wouldn\u2019t he surpass her?A wave of pressure suddenly attacked her.Du Xiao swore to herself. She must never be chased up by a newly employed teacher.\u2026Sun Mo borrowed a meditation room. After sitting down cross-legged, he blinked twice. He opened the black-colored cubic-shaped storage box and took the Diamond Fruit out.\u201cHow to eat this thing? Must it be cooked first?\u201dSun Mo had the Diamond Fruit in his hand and tried pressing it with much force. He felt a little dumbfounded.This fruit was the size of a walnut, and the surface was uneven and ugly. It looked like it was made of metal or glass, and it had a hard texture.As a single man with no girlfriend, Sun Mo\u2019s culinary skills were bad. His best dish was fish with pickled vegetables.\u201cJust swallow it raw!\u201d the system said concisely.\u201cAre you sure?\u201dSun Mo held onto the Diamond Fruit and gestured it in front of his mouth for a while. What a huge fruit. He could be choked to death!\u201cSure!\u201dThe system\u2019s tone was impatient. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for not reminding you. This fruit has an expiry date too. The earlier you eat it, the better the effect.\u201dSun Mo hesitated for a while and decided to trust the system. Hence, he forced the Diamond Fruit into his mouth, and then he was stunned.\u201cWu wu wu!\u201dSun Mo spoke, but all he could make was \u2018wu wu\u2019 sounds. Because his mouth was stuffed with something, he couldn\u2019t speak clearly.\u201cWait!\u201dThe system understood Sun Mo\u2019s question now. He was saying that this fruit couldn\u2019t be chewed.(What the f*ck!)Sun Mo cursed in his heart.In the past, he had come across a movie by chance. The lead actress in the movie had stuffed an indescribable ball-shaped object in her mouth and her saliva was overflowing.This couldn\u2019t be tolerated!Just when Sun Mo was about to vomit the Diamond Fruit out, it melted at lightning speed. It felt as though he had eaten a raw tomato; the fruit had turned into a pool of paste in his mouth.Gulp!Sun Mo swallowed it forcefully.After waiting for a few seconds, a gush of hot liquid was concentrated in his stomach and rapidly extended toward the bones of his limbs.Bang! Bang! Bang!The spirit qi from Sun Mo\u2019s body burst out, forming a huge malevolent skull of a giant creature in front of his body.It opened its big mouth that was filled with sharp teeth. Then like a whale that was drinking the ocean water, it started to swallow the spirit qi from the surroundings.Hu! Hu! Hu!The spirit qi surged violently and was engulfed by the giant creature\u2019s big mouth.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSun Mo looked at this skull, but he didn\u2019t even understand what was happening. Suddenly, the skull looked up into the sky and let out a long hissing sound. Next, it swallowed him in one bite.In front of Sun Mo\u2019s eyes was sudden darkness. It felt as though he had been thrown into a meat grinder. He could feel himself being squeezed, torn apart, and kneaded.It continued for about one minute, and the giant creature\u2019s skull burst open with a loud bang, revealing Sun Mo\u2019s figure.At this moment, Sun Mo\u2019s entire body was covered with a layer of golden light. He was looking like a God or Buddha!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
