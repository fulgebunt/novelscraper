With hundreds of years of inheritance, among entire Dragon Empire, it can only belong to the middle and lower faction. There are nearly a thousand disciples in Jade Palace, most of them are female disciples, each is beautiful like the flower.Many female disciples, even if there is heavy snow here, there are no plants, theyare like beautiful flowers, blooming in this heavy snow, forming a beautiful landscape.Although the Jade Palace is nothing out of ordinary, there are many womenhere, and it is a good place for many cultivator to choose a dao companion.At this time, in this heavy snow, many female disciples are training martial arts, holding a long sword to training, their practice sounded through entire Jade Palace, like a music to the ear. Under this rythmic and powerful sound, it seems that this winter is not so cold.At the same time, in a courtyard of Jade Palace, a pale teenager, thrusting a wooden spear in his hand, continually screamed forward. Each thrust is like taking time out of his strength and releasing all the power. When snow fell into his spear, a snowflake turned into countless white spots, and scattered down.After thrusting a few times, he stopped breathing and looked up at the sky.In the meantime, his thoughts shifted to the memory of his previous life.His name is Yi Tianyun. He is a game fan. On a night of thunderstorms, suddenly a lightning flashes down and he lost consciousness. At the last moment, he felt that he was going to die. He was hit by such a terrible thunder, and it was a strange thing that he survived.When he regained consciousness, he was already in this place and there was a strange memory in his head. The owner of the body died because the body was too weak yet he still train excessively and eventually died. And despite that fact, the current owner of the body still does this.Even though he knew that he couldn\u2019t train for too long, and his body was really weak, he nevertheless needs to strengthen himself\u201cDo i have no any other way?\u201dHis face was pale and his body was thin. He didn\u2019t look as burly as the cultivator. Instead, he was as fragile as a girl.\u201cHyaaahhh!\u201dHe shouted and strove forward with a spur, a cyclone running through the tip of the spear, and a pile of snow in front of him was washed away, re-splitting into countless snowflakes, falling slowly from the air, it looked so beautiful. However, the pale skin color of his body is not much worse than this snowflake.His skin is pale and horrible, and he doesnt possess blood qi. This is a taboo for the cultivator.Those who doesn\u2019t possess blood qi will be facing difficulties in life, and also it is impossible to cultivate. This is like blood is gone, how can we live? This is the case for this boy, his face is pale, there is no blood qi, and he will die young.To train martial arts in this state is to let yourself step into the coffin in advance. Therefore, he can only exercise at most, and can\u2019t train martial arts.\u201cCough and cough\u2026\u201dHis face suddenly redden, and it was rare to have a bit of blood qi, and a severe cough made him half-squatted. This is no longer a cultivator, it is a sick person. Cultivating was just too much, and his body was somewhat unbearable.\u201cAaaahh Young Master, how come you out here practicing, you are hurting yourself!\u201d At this time a maid ran out of the palace, watching the coughing teenager, she blames him for what he\u2019s doing, but more than that he is worrying about his well-being.She hurriedly took a piece of clothing and put it on the boy. Due to practicing martial arts, he did not wear any clothes on his body. In such cold weather, wearing such thin clothes is insane.\u201cSister Xiaolian, I am fine, I am just exercising\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun held back the cough, and from the pale face, squeezed a smile and expressed that he was fine.His other identity is Young Master of Jade Palace. The Lord of Jade Palace is his aunt, she feels responsible for Yi Tianyun, moreover his parent\u2019s whereabouts are still unknown.When he said that, he stood up on his own, without borrowing Xiaolian\u2019s help, which proved that he was fine.Xiaolian looked at him from the top of his head to the bottom of his toe, and confirmed that Yi Tianyun is finished with his training, felt a litttle relieved. Immediately said: \u201cPalace Lord asked me to take you to main hall. I\u2019ve been looking for you for quite a while and didn\u2019t find you, and here you are training martial arts\u2026 Young Master, I know that you want to train martial arts, but continuing to cultivate in your current situation, then\u2026\u201d she said reluctantly.Xiaolian couldn\u2019t finish what she said.\u201cIf i continue to cultivate, I\u2019ll die?\u201d Yi Tianyun smiled indifferently, then he said: \u201cI always know that this body doesn\u2019t possess blood qi, and i am not worth of cultivating, But I don\u2019t want to end it like this. I don\u2019t believe in fate, it\u2019s so pathetic!\u201dHis talent is not bad, but he doesn\u2019t possess blood qi, that\u2019s where the problem lies. Even though he is talented, without blood qi, what is the point of being talented?\u201cYoung Master\u2026\u201d Xiaolian\u2019s eye become teary. Her age is a few years older than Yi Tianyun. When she looks at Yi Tianyun, she is filled with sadness.\u201cDon\u2019t say anything else, let\u2019s just go to main hall, I wanna know why my aunt is looking for me.\u201d Yi Tianyun throws the spear to the side and falls accurately on the weapon frame on the side, then they step into the main hall.When he steps into main hall, he feels warmer. He notice gazes toward him, a female gazes, all of whom were female disciples here. It can be described as a man\u2019s paradise. Many outsider want to join in as a disciple, but not everyone is recruited. Only a small number of male outer disciples are recruited, the majority are female disciples.The female disciples outside main hall, watching him with eyes full of disgust, and dissatisfaction.They are disgusted and annoyed with Yi Tianyun. Apart from being a trash that could die at any time if he keeps training martial arts, the other point is that he is the son of former Palace Lord. There is a certain rule in the Jade Palace which states that Palace Lord is absolutely forbidden to marry and have children. Yi Tianyun\u2019s mother violated the regulations. After giving birth to him, she ran with a man!If it wasn\u2019t for his aunt\u2019s influence, Yi Tianyun had already been thrown out instead of staying here.Xiaolian address him a young master, but other people won\u2019t respect him, let alone address him as Young Master, and they call Yi Tianyun as trash or rotten eggs.Facing this situation, Yi Tianyun is showing indifferent expression, he\u2019s used to this, and he has already acknowledged this fact. Every time he felt their contemptuous eyes, he clenched his fists and felt extremely angry inside, but he was powerless to change this fact.He thought of leaving here countless times already, but when he thought of his aunt, he could not bear to leave.\u201cTianyun, you finally came over, did you secretly train martial arts?\u201d With a burst of complaints, a petite and beautiful girl walked over, about twenty years old, Not much older than him.When she came over, the surrounding female disciples bowed their heads and said respectfully: \u201cPalace Lord!\u201dThe girl who came in is Yi Tianyun\u2019s aunt, Shi Xueyun. Very young at age, but already became the Lord of Jade Palace. The reason why she can become Palace Lord is that her talent is amazing. At the age of twenty, her cultivation has reached Core Condensation Realm! Generally, at this age people only reach Spirit Refinement Realm.\u201cAunt.\u201d Yi Tianyun looked at Shi Xueyun that look frustrated and rushed over to her, and he smiled heartily. His aunt is the most concerned person about him in the entire Jade Palace.Seeing her, Yi Tianyun feels warm inside. A few years ago, when he came to this world, he felt very confused. In these years, Shi Xueyun has been accompanying him, taking care of him and letting him accept this fact. After all, accepting the previous memory does not mean that there is a sense of belonging. The sense of belonging is developed slowly. It is not something you earned in just a few days.Although he addressed her as aunt, they did not have a blood relationship. Since his mother entrusted Shi Xueyun, who is like her own sister to raise Yi Tianyun, it should be reasonable for her to call him Xiao Yi. But they do not have a substantial blood relationship, why should they call each other sister?Moreover, the aunt mentioned here is not only mean to address blood relatives, but also to address an older female! Not only applies to Shi Xueyun, but other older women as well, as long as they let you address them that way.No one cares more about him than she does, she is affectionate, kind and warm, and those feelings are genuine. Looking at her beautiful face, he remembered things from his childhood. Just like his mother, Shi Xueyun has been supporting him as he grow up. When she go to trains, she will bring him along with her so he won\u2019t be bullied by anyone. She will even go against the elders if it is for his sake.If it wasn\u2019t for Shi Xueyun\u2019s talent, those elders would have casted him away. Even if he want to stay in the palace, he can\u2019t cultivate. Then if he try to cultivate, he doesn\u2019t possess blood qi, and if he continues to cultivate, he will die. What is the difference between this and a trash?Shi Xueyun reached out and patted his head gently, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t blame you for trying to cultivate, but you can\u2019t overdo it!\u201dThen she took out a box from underneath her sleeve and opened it gently. A strong blood qi came from this jade box. After seeing it the disciples around them couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, they couldn\u2019t help but envied him.Who told this trash to be the loved by Palace Lord? Shi Xueyun herself specifically went outside to obtain it.\u201cThis, this is Dragon Blood Divine Pill\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun was shocked when he saw this Dragon Blood Divine pill. This thing is quite precious. It can add a lot of blood qi, since Shi Xueyun herself brought this. This definitely costs a lot.\u201cYes, this is Dragon Blood Divine Pill, take it! it should be able to greatly improve your body\u2019s blood qi.\u201d Shi Xueyun smiled softly, did not care about the value of this Dragon Blood Divine pill, just want to improve Yi Tianyun\u2019s condition.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun is touched and his eyes were teary. Over the years, his aunt has always found a lot of medicinal herbs to increase his blood qi, but the effect is not potent enough to increase his lifespan. For several years, Shi Xueying keep giving him medicinal pill with similar effect and now even giving him such valuable Dragon Blood Divine pill.\u201cThere is no better joy for me, other than improving your body\u2019s condition, understand? Don\u2019t think too much of it.\u201d Shi Xueyun stretched his hand and pinched his pale face, slightly pulled down, like a naughty girl.\u201cYeah!\u201d Yi Tianyun nodded. He knows what he need to do now. Regaining his body is the best reward!At this time a disciple hurriedly enter the palace and said \u201cPalace Lord, a person from Spirit Sect is coming!\u201d\u201cSomeone from Spirit Sect?\u201d Shi Xueyun frowned, and suddenly her attitude change drastically from just a moment ago when she was talking with Yi Tianyun. But then immediately, she smiled at Yi Tianyun: \u201cI will go deal with some things first, and you should take some rest.\u201dSister Xiaolian also nodded at him, and she also had to go along with her to deal with these things.\u201cWell, I understand.\u201d Yi Tianyun nodded and looked at Shi Xueyun\u2019s back as she faded from his sight. He clenched his fist and became frustrated because he can\u2019t help her.When Spirit Sect came over, they want their quota to enter ancient ruin. He knew all these things, but couldn\u2019t do anything to help.\u201cI have to take this Dragon Blood Divine Pill and I hope I can recover some blood qi\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun put away this Dragon Blood Divine Pill, then turned around and went to his room.When he walked out to the courtyard, three figures stopped and blocking his way.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYoung Master, can you give the Dragon Blood Divine Pill to us? We only need a little bit more push in our cultivation to reach the next level, give us the pill, it doesn\u2019t even have any effect on you anyway, it would be better to give it to us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s better to give it to us. If it works we will take you to see the world afterward!\u201d\u201cYes, it won\u2019t have any effect on you, nothing will happen even if you take it. It would be better for you to give it to us!\u201dThe three in front of him are recruited male disciples. Originally, they are not Heaven Jade Palace\u2019s disciple, they are from outside sect. Judging from their tone, they are just treating Yi Tianyun as a trash, even though it hasn\u2019t been that long they become disciple in Heaven Jade Palace, but they know that Yi Tianyun is a trash, a trash standing behind a great woman!\u201cOh, if I say no?\u201d Yi Tianyun\u2019s eyes are cold, this is what his aunt gave him, how can he give it to other people!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

These people are beginning to get nosey. Jade Palace is suppressed by the outside forces to accept more male disciples and therefore can only accept male disciples who have been forced into it.To put it bluntly, these three have bad intention, they are here just to find woman. According to the regulations, they are regarded as outer disciple since they originated from other sect to begin with, but can participate in training here. And the moment Shi Xueyun gave Yi Tianyun the Dragon Blood Divine Pill, their greedy nature emerged from within.Dragon Blood Divine Pill is among one of the best pill out there, it really is costly. If they take it, they will be able to make further breakthroughs and reach a higher level of cultivation.Fang Chen stepping forward: \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna give us that?\u201d looking at him and smiled contemptuously: \u201cSomeone like you who have to rely on palace lord\u2019s protection to survive still think you are safe now that your aunt is not here? We are member of Spirit Sect, our elders is just located outside of this sect, even if I do something to you right now, your aunt will not dare to do anything to us!\u201dSpirit Sect is relatively strong. In this continent, factions are divided into five levels.First Level is Palace, Second Level is Sect, Third Level is Mansion, Fourth Level is Empire, Fifth Level is Divine Nation! Jade Palace is naturally inferior to Spirit Sect. It is mainly for female disciples, so in terms of number of disciple will naturally be a fewer, but the overall strength is not weak.However, the overall strength is still weaker compared to Spirit Sect, so they are suppressed. In the case of being suppressed, they think that even if they are up against Palace Lord, she must give a few faces in front of disciple! Since their hierarchial position is superiorAs the saying goes, if you want to beat a dog you must know who the owner. Defying them is equal to defying the Spirit Sect. They are naturally very arrogant, They think that Shi Xueyun does not dare to confront Fang Chen, so taking the Dragon Blood Divine Pill from Yi Tianyun comes naturally.\u201cYeah, I just save you some dignity here. You are a trash, a cockroach, and you dare to defy us?\u201d Zhao Hao, standing next to Yi Tianyun, chastizing and laughed at Yi Tianyun. Zhao Hao really felt like standing next to garbage disposal.\u201cAre you courting death?\u201d Yi Tianyun said with dark voice, and killing cold eyes.Whenever someone calls him a trash, there is a sting in his chest, but hearing it from another trash from outer sect truly make him furious. His killing intent welled up from inside his chest provoking him to become angrier than he supposed to be.\u201cOh, so persistant are you? You think your aunt can save you every time? You thought that I am afraid of her? I am not some pushover, trash!\u201d Fang Chen laughed, taunting Yi Tianyun.This problem of Yi Tianyun was rumored outside Jade Palace, Palace Lord of Jade Palace, raising a trash!\u201cEither get out of my face, or die!\u201d Yi Tianyun flashed a cold eyes, his fists clenched, and his hands pale skin was pinched by his nails.He can ignore his own reputation, but his aunt\u2019s reputation, he must take good care of it!\u201cHaah, I see you already tired, you dare to talk shit to me, give me a slap in the face!\u201d Fang Chen screamed, quickly rushed over and connecting his punch to Yi Tianyun.The fierce boxing style is coming like the wind, very fast and accurate and Fang Chen is not even in upper tier in cultivation, he is at fourth level of Body Refinement Realm. Jade Palace is a low disciple, and it is generally at the third level. This fourth level is still in the middle and lower, and the fists that come from Fang Chen is not weak.This fist was quite slow in the eyes of Yi Tianyun. When he looked up, a cold glow burst out. The fist that Fang Chen waved seems to have become slower. There are countless kinds of evasive methods in his head, and even the method of counterattacking. The attack in front of his eyes is completely flawed! Although he can\u2019t train much, he has studied combat skills.\u201cHyaah!\u201dThe light flashed in his eyes, he is gently moving to the side to dodge Fang Chen\u2019s strike. Because of the trains earlier, he is exhausted, and only barely evaded the attack but he lost his footing, and he fell down.When he fell, everyone squatted and immediately laughed.\u201cTrash is trash, only moved a little, it will fall! Dragon Blood Divine Pill is in your hands, give it to us!\u201d Fang Chen laughed, and reached out and grabbed him in his arms.Yi Tianyun\u2019s eyes were cold. He knew that he couldn\u2019t escape. He quickly took Dragon Blood Divine Pill in his body, stuffed it into his mouth, chewed it, and swallowed it! This scene made them stunned, a Dragon Blood Divine Pill, were eaten by dogs?\u201cYou actually ate my Dragon Blood Divine Pill, courting death! I will kill you!\u201d Fang Chen was angry, he thought he could get this Dragon Blood Divine Pill, he did not expect to it to be eaten by Yi Tianyun.For a time, the three men rushed over and prepared to punch and kick him.In this moment, the flashing notification sound blinked in his mind!\u300eDing!

Dragon Blood Divine Pill, can let him rise five levels!\u201cCrazy Leveling System? This is the game system\u2026 This is simply a game!\u201d Yi Tianyun was shocked. As a player, how can he not know what this concept is!At the same time, their fists have already meet with Yi Tianyun, but at this moment, Yi Tianyun feels that he is so full of strength, no longer a state of powerlessness, but a state of extreme strength!\u201cGet lost!\u201dYi Tianyun\u2019s eyes glowing, his hands patted the ground, and began to spin up quickly. His leg sweeping the floor, it containing the strength of fifth level of Body Refining Stage, and a burst of power broke out!He quickly kicked the three man in front of him strike to their chest.The three men flew out directly by his leg, and they were posted on the wall. Their cultivation is weaker than him, and they vomited blood directly to the ground!\u201cThis, what is going on here? This is basically fifth level of Body Refinement Realm. Isn\u2019t he a trash?\u201d Fang Chen was dumbfounded. He climbed up hard and his eyes were full of shock. Tianyun\u2019s cultivation is higher than them, he is at middle level of Body Refining Stage right now.In this world, the level is quite clear and is divided into nine levels.They are Body Refinement Realm \u2013 Spirit Refinement Realm \u2013 Core Condensation Realm \u2013 Core Spirit Realm \u2013 Core Transformation Realm \u2013 Void Spirit Realm \u2013 Spirit King Realm \u2013 Saint King Realm \u2013 God King Realm!Each stage is divided into ten levels. The young Shi Xueyun is already in Core Condensation Realm.Yi Tianyun looked at Fang Chen, and the strong murderousness made Fang Chen\u2019s body weak. He hurriedly kneel on the ground and cried: \u201cPlease let me go, I am wrong, I will never dare to ask for your pill again!\u201d So far, if he still can\u2019t understand anything, then he is really a fool.He didn\u2019t think that Yi Tianyun was trash like rumored, but he was so powerful, especially the murderousness that came out, and he didn\u2019t know how to cultivate it. Moreover, Yi Tianyun has also reached fifth level of Body Refinement Realm. Although it is not heaven defying, Yi Tianyun at least stronger than them.He can only scream in his heart, and the rumors outside are fake! Who said that Yi Tianyun is a trash, Yi Tianyun stage is not very high, but at least higher than them!Yi Tianyun slowly came over to him and his eyes were cold.\u201cI said, either get out of my face or die, I have already given you a chance.\u201d Yi Tianyun looked cold, and in Fang Chen\u2019s horrified eyes, he picked up the long spear on the side and pointed at Fang Chen\u2019s head.Fang Chen panicked.He just wanted to make other party fainted, and did not mean to kill him, otherwise Spirit Sect would definitely find him for trouble.At this moment, Fang Chen screamed, \u201cYou will kill me!\u201d The other hand quickly took out a dagger from his arms, he aimed the dagger at Yi Tianyun\u2019s heart so that Yi Tianyun will die before he could kill Fang Chen.Yi Tianyun saw through Fang Chen move and quickly countered Fang Chen by taking his armed hand and slammed the dagger by Fang Chen hand strike into his chest consecutively slammed Fang Chen in to the ground. Fang Chen was heavily slammed on the ground, and slightly stunned by Yi Tianyun move. Yi Tianyun grabbed Fang Chen\u2019s hand and pressed it down to his own chest.The sound of blood clogging in Fang Chen throat fill the space around them\u201cYou still dare to attack me!\u201dYi Tianyun\u2019s eyes were cold, and he lifted his foot and slammed it up. Fang Chen was kicked out by his foot and slipped to the ground.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dFang Chen vomited blood in a big mouth, and immediately widened his eyes, his face became dark and inconspicuous, and it seemed obvious that it was a sign of poisoning. In this dagger, it is obvious that there are intense toxins, and the insertion into the heart accelerates the flow of venom.The next moment, Fang Chen\u2019s eyes become dimmer and he died.\u300eDing!

He keeps glaring at Yi Tiangyun .\u201cYes, he suddenly said that this is his territory, then attacked us . We didn\u2019t retaliate!\u201d Lin Yuan, who was lying next to him, painfully try to get back on his feet, knowing that their elder is here now, they are not afraid of anything .Fang Yun actually know the truth, Dragon Blood Divine Pill is definitely precious it can enhance blood qi by quite an amount, it\u2019s effect is in fact much more effective on someone with lower level of cultivation, it doesn\u2019t affect you that much when you are already in quite a high level, knowing Fang Chen\u2019s true nature, he definitely want to snatch this Dragon Blood Divine Pill .When your cultivation is Body Refinement Realm, all you need to do is increase the intensity of energy in your body, and you can breakthrough this realm! The key of Body Refinement Realm just as the name states is by refining the body, to be able to breakthrough this realm .But of course they won\u2019t admit that their disciples tried to snatch Yi Tiangyun\u2019s Dragon Blood Divine Pill! Especially Fang Chen is already dead, they definitely want their revenge .\u201cIt\u2019s impossible! Our disciple won\u2019t do such thing!\u201d Zhao Hualong, Second Elder of Spirit Sect, stood up and said: \u201cPalace Lord Shi, you need to give us an explanation! We let our excellent disciples join Jade Palace to train, originally we would like to improve the relationship between our factions . I can\u2019t believe this is what we get for trying to get along with your faction . Are you trying to destroy the relationship between our factions?\u201dYi Tianyun and Shi Xueyun try their best to hold their anger . Jade Palace\u2019s disciple are definitely blaming Yi Tianyun, not noticable by naked eye but judging from their expression, they definitely are . Everyone knows that the influence of Spirit Sect is not to be underestimeted . If we make enemies out of them, they won\u2019t let us get away with it .Shi Xueyun looked at them coldly, she knows everything about Yi Tianyun, he\u2019ll never lay a hand on them unless they provoke him . It\u2019s just as Yi Tianyun said, they want to snatch this Dragon Blood Divine Pill!It\u2019s just everyone else can\u2019t believe in Yi Tianyun the way she did, including other disciples of Jade Palace . Yi Tianyun never intended to destroy these two factions relationship . Because he know what it means to make enemies out of them .\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Second Elder of Spirit Sect, Zhao Hualong, simply want to take their revenge . He actually doesn\u2019t care about the means .\u201cI want to have a duel with him!\u201d Fang Yun stood up and looked at Yi Tianyun and said coldly: \u201cYou killed my little brother, I want to fight with you for life and death!\u201dZhao Hualong said in the side: \u201cYes, we have cooperated for quite a while . And as we said earlier . Since we didn\u2019t lay hand on him first, we should not be punished! Now you have injured our disciples and killed Fang Chen . It is impossible to let this go . We will choose a fair duel, and of course Yi Tiangyun will be your representative for the duel . Fight in the duel fair and square, regardless of the outcome!\u201dThey said fair but, they all know the predicament Yi Tianyun is in, even if his level of cultivation is not bad, due to blood qi shortage he\u2019ll end up losing, representing Jade Palace to participate in a duel to death, isn\u2019t it the same as suicide?Shi Xueyun wrinkled Liu Mei and said: \u201cHe is not a proper opponent, please choose other disciples . \u201dObviously, she can\u2019t let Yi Tianyun duel . His blood qi is really bad, especially just a while ago he trains martial arts for quite a while additionally he fight those three troublemaker, he will definitely collapse . How can she send Yi Tianyun to a duel just to die?Zhao Hualong sneered: \u201cPalace Lord Shi, he is indeed not a proper opponent, but he has challenged the authority of our Spirit Sect! Are you want to make this matter even worse?\u201d he threatened\u201cNo! Anyone other than him will do!\u201d Shi Xueyun sternly said .The people of Spirit Sect saw Yi Tianyun standing near them, their eyes showing a bit of disdain, ridiculing him deep down in their heart . No matter how Shu Xueyun covers it up, such information still spreaded outside Jade Palace . That Yi Tianyun is a waste . If he fights, he will definitely die, and thus Jade Palace\u2019s defeat as well .It\u2019s like everyone here other than Shi Xueyun is Yi Tianyun\u2019s enemy, even the disciple of Jade Palace .\u201cI kind of know what is going on . If I remember correctly, he should be the son of the former Palace Lord . Rumor said that he has low blood qi and could die at any time . No wonder that Palace Lord Shi does not want him to participate . I also don\u2019t think that winning against a blood-deficient trash like him will prove anything, but now that he is defying the authority of our Spirit Sect . Even if he is trash, We must make an example out of him . Otherwise, everyone else will disrespect us in the future!\u201dHe doesn\u2019t lend an ear to any of Shi Xueyun\u2019s reasoning, Yi Tianyun must participate in the duel no matter what, Snow outside rivaling their level of shamelessness .Suddenly, a strong aura enveloped Shi Xueyun\u2019s whole body . The surrounding snow was hurled up, and then fell to the ground . Everyone feel an immense pressure coming from her .The strength of Core Condensation Realm cultivator is nothing to sneer at!At the next moment, Shi Xueyun quickly flashed in front of Zhao Hualong . Before the latter reacted, she waved and flashed . The sound of slap sounded crisp and mellow, and it was so loud in this courtyard .After that slap in the face, Shi Xueyun returned to her original position and immediately stand in front of Yi Tianyun . The white dress she wear was slightly afloat, and there was nothing that make her apparel look dirty . The faint fragrance broke into the nose of Yi Tianyun, and it felt very peacefull . And Zhao Hualong has a five-finger print on his face, which is also shaping on his heart .Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNo one thought that Shi Xueyun would do this and gave Zhao Hualong a slap .

Although the comprehensive strength of Jade Palace is weaker than Spirit Sect, with connection from others, Jade Palace can be much stronger than Spirit Sect .There are a lot of disciples in Jade Palace who are married with outsider, while Jade Palace status is not particularly high outside, but they have no problem to bring some support from outside .Zhao Hualong knew that his words were a bit mean, but he was slapped . How can he bow down like this, and immediately sneered: \u201cLord Palace Shi gave me a slap, this is undoubtedly a physical confrontation, this is not a simple matter . If he really didn\u2019t make a mistake, why didn\u2019t you let him go? Not because I want to embarrass him, but because he injured our disciples, not only that, he even accused us to snatch Dragon Blood Divine Pill, he think that we can\u2019t afford Dragon Blood Divine Pill by ourself!\u201dHe is furious that Shi Xueyun slap him in front of so many people .

That is not the only reason, the main reason is that his body is too weak, which make the consequences of losing worse . If he is smashed out, even if he is not dead, he will be disabled for life .In any case, Shi Xueyun will not give in, this is her bottom line!Although her aura is strong enough, but Yi Tianyun standing on one side is suffering from the judgemental eyes watching around them .

As long as he can complete it, the reward he received will be worth his trouble, especially the exp .Just the treasures that are obtained, looks like the level is too low?Whether it is a weapon or a treasure, it is divided into several levels: Common, Spirit, Holy, Relic, and Artifact!Yi Tianyun\u2019s words attracted all the attention around him . Among them, Zhao Hualong squatted and sneered at the corner of his mouth . This was a sly smile and finally he got what he wanted . If Shi Xueyun did not agree, he really couldn\u2019t help it, but Yi Tianyun himself agreed, and that\u2019s really fits his convenience .Well for Spirit Sect itself, Fang Chen is just a low level disciple, they didn\u2019t really care about Fang Chen\u2019s life .

After he opened it, there was a huge turntable picture in front of it . There are several types, respectively is: Weapons Category, Defensive Equipment Category, Consumables Category, Martial Arts Category, Cultivation Techniques Category and Divine Ability Category!Among them, Consumables has the most pool, almost half of all the item are consumables, and Abilities and Cultivation Techniques are much fewer . Divine Ability is the fewest . If you look at it in proportion, it can be regarded as a ratio of one in ten thousand .\u300eBecause you have successfully opened the lottery function, you will be given a free lottery . Will you start the lottery now?\u300fThe system sound asked .\u201cPull out!\u201d Yi Tianyun without hesitating . Immediately after the \u201cbeep\u201d the lottery roulette spinned wildly . After a while, the turntable gradually slowed down, and he saw that the contents of the pointer were constantly changing . He\u2019s waiting excitedly, what treasure will he get?Finally, the lottery wheel stopped, and the pointer pointed to weapon, which made Yi Tianyun relieved, because it was not stopped at consumables .Then, afterward a gauntlet popped up in the inventory .

Let me teach them a lesson and let them know that our Jade Palace is amazing!\u201dHis voice is low, he won\u2019t let Spirit Sect do whatever they please!\u201cYoung Master, are you really ok?\u201d\u201cYeah, we thought you\u2019re a weakling . We didn\u2019t expect that Palace Lord actually conceal your true strength . Young Master, you really got us!\u201dYi Tianyun\u2019s prowess captivated many female disciples, they\u2019re really confused . At least most of them if not all have changed Yi Tianyun views .Former Palace Lord\u2019s behaviour was very irresponsible, but it did not cause a serious impact to Jade Palace . When she was Palace Lord of Jade Palace, she contributed quite a lot to Jade Palace, so she can still be forgiven .Of course, everything is because of Yi Tianyun\u2019s capabilities, and the most important thing is he won, not just for himself but also for Jade Palace . If it\u2019s not for this factor, probably he will still be looked down upon even if his strength is mediocre . In the end, without power, you can\u2019t change others\u2019 opinion about you!Shi Xueyun saw the situation around her and couldn\u2019t help but shook her head . They all thought that she deliberately concealed Yi Tianyun\u2019s strength . As a relative who often takes care of Yi Tianyun, she obviously know that\u2019s not true, even if Yi Tianyun have normal blood qi like everyone else it\u2019s impossible to suddenly be this strong .This is what bothers her and Xiaolian .\u201cAlright then, can you still fight in that condition?\u201d Shi Xueyun worried: \u201cDon\u2019t be stubborn, if you can\u2019t, then come down . \u201dYi Tianyun just wants to say something, Zhao Hualong on the audience said coldly: \u201cHe has promised to fight, last fight, we must continue!\u201dEveryone shift their attention and saw that Zhao Hualong eyes were red, and killing intent is spread to his surrounding . Even the disciples of Spirit Sect glared at Yi Tianyun who killed their two brothers in succession . Not only their expression drastically changed compared to when they come here, but they also lost two talented fellow disciples!At this time, Zhao Hualong can\u2019t hold his anger any longer . With Mo Cheng talent, in the future he can definitely become a core disciple, but now he is dead! He will be held responsible later after returning to Spirit Sect .Now, he only wants to kill Yi Tianyun, avenge his disciples, and saving his dignity in front of Spirit Sect .\u201cElder Zhao, Tianyun already fought twice, in this last fight let other disciple participate, it is not against the rule!\u201d Shi Xueyun looked at Zhao Hualong with cold eyes, and the powerful aura around him seemed to be turned into weak spark in the face of Shi Xueyun . The killing intent released by Zhao Hualong was washed away .\u201cHe just said that he would continue to fight, and of course we will respect his wish!\u201d Of course, Zhao Hualong is not willing to let Yi Tianyun leave . If he leave, he will miss the chance for a revenge .\u201cNow I said on his behalf . I don\u2019t know what elder is Zhao talking about?\u201d Shi Xueyun already knew that Zhao Hualong wanted to take revenge .Everyone couldn\u2019t help but despise Zhao Hualong . Shi Xueyun just spoke up and said that he was not going to let Yi Tianyun participate .\u201cPalace Lord Shi, this is his own choice!\u201d Zhao Hualong raised two fingers and said: \u201cIf he choose to participate in this round as well, and win then I will give him Spirit Breakthrough Pill . \u201dIt takes everyone\u2019s breath upon hearing Zhao Hualong\u2019s statement . Spirit Breakthrough Pill, as the name suggests, it can help the user to breakthrough from Body Refinement Stage to Spirit Refinement Stage .If user already reach peak of Body Refinement Stage . As long as they take it, they can basically breakthrough to Spirit Refinement Stage!What Zhao Hualong put as a bet is definitely something tempting, and the price of Spirit Breakthrough Pill is not low . If he loses, not only losing two disciples, but also Spirit Breakthrough Pill .Originally, he didn\u2019t want to bet using something as precious as Spirit Breakthrough Pill, but in order to tempt Yi Tianyun to remain on stage, he could only use this pill as a bet . Originally, this pill was going to be given to Mo Cheng .Without anyone expectation Shi Xueyun sneered and said: \u201cIs this Spirit Breakthrough Pill very precious? despite being an elder you are so shameless to use it as a bet . Take it back and eat it yourself!\u201dJade Palace can still get their hands on Spirit Breakthrough Pill . For the time being, no matter how precious this thing is, Yi Tianyun is more important to her . Looking at Zhao Hualong attitude, he is definitely planning something, Yi Tianyun will be in danger!Zhao Hualong is getting desperate, this Spirit Breakthrough Pill is precious to the disciples of Body Refinement Stage, but it has no effect for Spirit Refinement Stage .\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d Zhao Hualong clenched his teeth .\u201cGet out! I don\u2019t need anything from you!\u201d Shi Xueyun said, no hesitation at all on that sentence, Yi Tianyun is more important!Zhao Hualong face became darker, he wanted to take revenge but he\u2019s at his wits end\u201cA Spirit Breakthrough Pill? I will fight!\u201d Yi Tianyun smiled lightly . He planned to fight till the end anyway from the beginning . He didn\u2019t expect them to continue discussing about it, regardless of his opinions .From the very beginning, he had already said that he would fight . He didn\u2019t expect them to be arguing, even made a bet . This bet makes thing even more interesting, he likes it!Like earlier, he still chose to fight . But, this time no one dared to laugh at him . The strength that he just been shown has already shocked everyone .Zhao Hualong eyes showed joy and hurriedly said: \u201cIn that case, then get ready!\u201d He didn\u2019t want to miss this opportunity, his heart was cold, and as long as Yi Tianyun agreed, he would have a chance at revenge!Shi Xueyun was anxious . When she wanted to stop Yi Tianyun from fighting, she saw Yi Tinyun eyes exerting overbearing confident . She let \u00a0her mouth open, just to be closed second after, she can\u2019t bring herself to stop Yi Tianyun .\u201cLast fight, Zhao Feng go!\u201dZhao Hualong pointed out a disciple who was seventh level of Body Refinement Stage . His level even worse than Fang Yun . Sending him to fight, can he win?However, since it is Zhao Hualong the one who sent him, he must have his reason . \u00a0Zhao Hualong have reached an elder position, he is not a fool .After letting Zhao Feng come over, he whispered: \u201cDon\u2019t spare any effort, abolish him!, I will help solve sour problem, as long as you can win!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNo problem!\u201d Zhao Feng cold eyes stared at Yi Tianyun, his cold eyes were like a poisonous snake, reflected in his eyes .Zhao Hualong was so furious and mercilessly said: \u201cYou still want this Spirit Breakthrough Pill? You must be a fool, you won\u2019t be able to win, let alone get your hands on this Spirit Breakthrough Pill, you will pay the price for killing our people!\u201dThe anger in his heart has shown up in his face . Not only has he been slapped, but the outstanding disciples who have been brought by him was dead . If he doesn\u2019t take revenge, he surely will lose his dignity .Meanwhile What Yi Tianyun is thinking right now was completing his mission and getting the juicy reward .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It caused quite an impact upon his landing!, followed by a loud bang.Something wrapped in black cloth at his back piqued everyone\u2019s attention. Then Zhao Feng reached out something from his back and pulled it out, that turns out to be a heavy black spear!Zhao Feng waved it a few times in the air, and ending it with a slam to the ground, causes a loud noise and even a small hole on the ground!\u201cBang!\u201dThis situation rendered the female disciple of Jade Palace speechless. It is no wonder that he leped to the stage confidently. he turned out to be carrying such weapon. Even just a random strike from it could cause a huge damage.\u201cThis spear, weigh at least six or seven hundred pounds\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is an innate power. Even if you have seventh level of Body Refinement \u00a0Realm, can you easily wield such a heavy weapon?\u201dEveryone around the stage chatter among themselves, Yi Tianyun\u2019s technique is certainly dangerous, but that weapon length and reach is not normal. The length is almost equal to two people, how do you even close the gap, let alone attack.Shi Xueyun panics: \u201cIt seems that Elder Zhao has observed Tianyun\u2019s movement, and decide that simply compete using cultivation realm is insufficient against Tianyun so he send someone with extraordinary power wielding such heavy weapon!\u201dAs expected of him, sending someone like Zhao Feng to deal with Yi Tianyun, he really is a scum. Nevertheless, it\u2019s not against the rules to use weapons. Weapons are necessary. Good weapons can enhance the wielder strengths and levels!Now that Zhao Feng decided to use a weapon, Yi Tianyun may also choose any weapon he wish. There are many weapons in Jade Palace, Shi Xueyun doesn\u2019t know which weapon can Yi Tianyun use.Zhao Hualong smiled and said: \u201cThere is no rule that forbid using weapons, you also may choose your weapons\u201d.Yi Tianyun cultivation level is higher, but what about the weapon? The difference in realm does not mean absolute victory. Especially in this case, he knows Yi Tianyun\u2019s movement is not that good, because in the previous battle it\u2019s not like he managed to dodge all the attack.But something bothers him, but he can\u2019t understand it. But there is no point to keep thinking about it, he focuses only on winning!\u201cThis spear looks very powerful.\u201dYi Tianyun looked at the long spear in Zhao Feng hand, now that he thinks about it he has a weapon of his own.\u201cTianyun, what weapon do you need?\u201d Shi Xueyun mention all kind of weapons by order from the lower level one to the higher one.Yi Tianyun smiled and said: \u201cI have my own weapon\u2026\u201d as he said that he took out the Frost Fist and equip it. The blue gauntlet covers his fist and it has a faint blue light. It looks pretty.But everyone is confused when they saw this gauntlet. How Is this different from bare hand? Meanwhile Zhao Feng has a weapon with such absurd reach, even if it\u2019s a powerful gauntlet what can he do facing such weapon?.\u201cOh\u2026 what is the difference between this and bare hands? And what is this thing? It \u00a0looks like a glove, does it have some kind of effect!?\u201d Zhao Hualong laughed and thought it was funny. How is it a weapon? It\u2019s just some kind of glove!The female disciples of Jade Palace sighed, they\u2019re convinced this round will result in a loss!Shi Xueyun anxiously said: \u201cTianyun, how do you fight him with this weapon?\u201dShe notices, Yi Tianyun is struggling, and even evading the attack is already a hard task for him. How does he even attack? Not to mention with such weapon.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I wil be able to land a hit.\u201d Yi Tianyun smiled and walked toward the platform.There is actually somebody using this kind of weapon?Both Jade Palace and Spirit Sect questions Yi Tianyun\u2019s sanity for picking such weapon. If the cultivation level\u2019s gap between them is really huge it will be easy to defeat Zhao Feng with bare hands. But that\u2019s not the case,their level gap is not that big.Due to weapon advantage, Yi Tianyun chance to win is below 50%!This is not an exaggeration. Zhao Feng waves such heavy spear like it\u2019s nothing it doesn\u2019t even reduce his reaction speed . In this condition can Yi Tianyun even close the gap? Unless he is faster that Zhao Feng\u2019s swing.\u201cIf you want to die that much, i won\u2019t stop you.\u201d Zhao Feng pointed the long spear at Yi Tianyun. It\u2019s as if the tip of the spear holds an enormous power, and with this he can avenge his fallen comrades.\u201cAfter you.\u201dYi Tianyun indicated that Zhao Feng could attack any time with his casual expression.\u201cHyaah!\u201dZhao Feng did not hesitate, he shouted, grabbed the spear and rush toward Yi Tianyun, a fierce aura is emitted from his body, and his killing intent is exposed in front of everyone, this kind of strength is not possible for someone on seventh level of Body Refinement Realm.\u201cCould it be? He took a power pill? Someone saw Zhao Feng took a power pill before attacking.\u201cBam!\u201dA loud sound is heard upon the impact of his spear hitting the ground. He marks Yi Tianyun and won\u2019t let him go. Zhao Feng held a long spear in midair and rush toward Yi Tianyun.\u201cSpear Downstream Dragon!\u201dHe used Spirit Sect martial arts, combined with the effect of power pill his power increased even further! Yi Tianyun can\u2019t escape from this strike.Suddenly Yi Tiangyun disappear, and as if his figure was distorted somehow, this familiar scene, is this Floating Cloud Steps that Mo Cheng use earlier? But this time it\u2019s Yi Tianyun the one who use it. But the thing is, it\u2019s a secret technique used by Spirit Sect, how on earth can Yi Tianyun master it?\u201cThis, this is Floating Cloud Steps, how is it possible?!\u201dZhao Hualong was shocked. To begin with, not even all disciples of Spirit Sect is capable to learn this Floating Cloud Steps. Yet now Yi Tianyun use it like it\u2019s nothing, and of course everyone is dumbfounded not only disciple of Spirit Sect but also Jade Palace.In an instant he disappear from Zhao Feng\u2019 sight and reappeared behind Zhao Feng! He punched him and Frost Fist immediately shone with blue light, and the cold aura is quickly dissipated, and suddenly it covered Zhao Feng entire body. In an instant, his movements became very slow, \u00a0he wanted to turn around and fight back, but his speed was greatly reduced, and he couldn\u2019t keep up with Yi Tianyun\u2019s movement.\u201cBang!\u201dIncapable of countering and defending Zhao Feng once again suffered another punch from Yi Tianyun , Zhao Feng was tossed away, and the ultimate cold air continued to cripple his body. And because he took the power pill earlier his body is currently in extreme heat. But due to both extreme heat and cold air raging in his body, slowly his body is destroyed from within.\u201cAh!\u201dHe vomits blood then fell to the ground, and he died! It\u2019s like his blood vessel is punctured! What a painful death..\u201cDing!

I got quite a lot of things from accomplishing this task. I get a divine armor and 200 gold. This is enough for a while.\u201dYi Tianyun is very satisfied with these rewards, although he feels kind of dissapointed as well due to the amount of the rewards, although he is well aware that the one he just fought against is a basic mob level not the boss level.\u201cLook at my cultivation level. I break through to Spirit Refinement Realm already, this cultivation speed is crazy.\u201d Yi Tianyun once again being reminded of the awesomeness of this Crazy Leveling System, if somebody else finds out about this, surely he will be in a lot of trouble.The initial practice is really killing him, but with this crazy system, in just half a month he can breakthrough Spirit Refinement Realm, which is truly at genius level if not insane.Host: Yi TianyunLevel: 11 (First Level of Spirit Refinement Realm)EXP: 1573/30000Crazy Point: 698Cultivation Technique: Dark North Divine Art (Human Grade, Mastery 378/1000)Martial Arts: Absorbing Stars Great Technique (Human Grade, Mastery 378/1000), Eagle Claw Art, Falling Feather Sword Technique, Floating Cloud StepsWeapon: Frost Fist (Common Grade, Mastery 329/1000)Armor: Snow Wolf BootsDivine Ability: Crazy Mode Level 1Eagle Claw Art and Falling Feather Sword Technique cannot be leveled up, human level is it\u2019s max level. This is a low-level skill to begin with, and there is no room for improvement. To put it bluntly, there\u2019s no merit from repeatedly using it because it can\u2019t be leveled up anyway.However, because his martial arts are relatively limited, he had no choice but to utilize it whenever necessary. he is satisfied upon seeing the vast improvement of his martial art\u2019s mastery, however the rate is just slow. There are too few monster in snowy mountain, otherwise he would have level up.If exp card can be used to improve mastery as well, he wouldn\u2019t have a hard time. However, exp is different from mastery, so that makes the exp card unusable for this matter.In addition, now that he reaches level 11, he is eligible for Gift Pack Lv11.While he was viewing the status, Zhao Hualong, who sits on the audience seat, was completely stupefied.\u201cThis, this is impossible\u2026\u201d Zhao Hualong felt very frustrated and irritated about the outcome.Tianyun won three out of three duel, leaving all his opponent\u2019s corpse too to boot. Only using a gauntlet, and his martial arts is not particularly strong. How can this be?He lost not only three disciples, entry permit to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, and also Spirit Breakthrough Pill! This really pisses him off. If this was not Jade Palace He probably would\u2019ve behead Yi Tianyun.\u201cBut something\u2019s off. He used Floating Cloud Steps just now, how can he master that technique, a secret technique belong to us Spirit Sect? and his speed is faster too\u201dEveryone\u2019s reaction is almost the same. Because this battle is even more shocking than the two previous battles! and How can the disciples of Jade Palace know the martial arts of Spirit Sect?Yi Tianyun is showing faster speed than that of Mo Cheng. The reason is that he is equipped with snow wolf boots. He himself didn\u2019t realize it at first, but when he runs, the speed will be greatly improved, at least twice. The speed is naturally far beyond that of Mo Cheng.\u201cElder Zhao, this duel ended with Spirit Sect\u2019s lost!\u201d Shi Xueyun looked at them with cold eyes.The disciple of Spirit Sect came here full of confidence, but they used an underhand tactic and lost. Just imagine how disgraceful it is and how can they bear it..\u201cHe, he is not a disciple of Jade Palace! Jade Palace never accepts male disciples. This win is not counted at all!\u201d\u201cYeah! Jade Palace\u2019s disciple has always been woman, this man can\u2019t be considered a disciples at all, at most can only be considered as an outer disciple!\u201dThe disciples of Spirit Sect believe that this contest is not counted. Jade Palace has always been for woman, But Tianyun is a man and there goes Spirit Sect point of view to not partake on their lost.These sly disciples, Yi Tianyun could not help but despise them at this point. If his battles doesn\u2019t count, why did they let him participate in the first place? These people are so shamelessYi Tianyun screamed at Zhao Hualong: \u201cElder Zhao, is your disciple denying your own words?\u201d\u201cHow can you use our Spirit Sect secret art!\u201d Zhao Hualong avoided the topic at hand, and his eyes stared at Yi Tianyun coldly.\u201cI learned with a few glances. You think i steal that technique from you?\u201d Yi Tianyun said indifferently.\u201cIf it is really stolen, it\u2019s also too bad for you Spirit Sect! that means it\u2019s not particularly an amazing technique or anything\u201d Shi Xueyun added a cold comment and cold glare: \u201cElder Zhao, now you lose, that is fact!\u201dZhao Hualong face is constrained with fury, and no matter what he said this matter is already decided. It\u2019s just a shame that not only three disciples have died but they also lost entry permit to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins. How can they not feel bad?Zhao Hualong stared coldly at Yi Tianyun: \u201cNo matter how you learn it, you are forbidden use our martial arts in the future!\u201dThis is Spirit Sect\u2019s technique. Of course, he can\u2019t just let other people use it even if they managed to master it somehow, but it is impossible to make Yi Tianyun forget about the techniqe he already learned.\u201cI have learned this myself, and I don\u2019t steal it, so you have nothing to say in this.\u201d Yi Tianyun said indifferently: \u201cAs for this martial arts, I don\u2019t care if I don\u2019t use it. And i already used it anyway, is it against the rules? Now as promised, hand me my reward and entry permit\u201dZhao Hualong stared at Yi Tianyun, his eyes filled with killing intent!Immediately, he took the pill and a metal token, and throw it. it fell into the hands of Shi Xueyun, his face turned gloomy: \u201cReturn to the sect!\u201d He has no more energy to stay, and not wanting more shame directed to his sectLooking at the figure of Zhao Hualong from far away, Yi Tianyun eyes flashed with realization, and Yi Tianyun succesfully made himself as their enemies. However, he looked at Zhao Hualong\u2019s name bar is flashing indicating a boss character. He really wanted to punch him and kill him. He wonder what kind of treasure would he get for successing such a feat.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter the disciples of Spirit Sect left, the disciples of Jade Palace cheered, and the duel between the two factions has finally ended with their victory!

This is not impossible. Anything in this world is possible. \u201cIs he sent by your father?\u201dYi Tianyun\u2019s parents ran away, but they weren\u2019t dead. Their whereabouts is unknown even until now, but Shi Xueyun knew that the reason why the previous palace lord left was definitely to go after Yi Tianyun\u2019s father whom was a super genius. If he wasn\u2019t one, Yi Tianyun\u2019s mother won\u2019t be so head over heels for him.Yi Tianyun smiled and said: \u201cThat is very likely. The mysterious expert did not disclose any information. In any case it\u2019s thanks to him I can cultivate this far, otherwise, I won\u2019t have enough strength to win this fight.\u201dShi Xueyun thought about it, and then continued: \u201cThat mysterious expert didn\u2019t say anything?\u201dYi Tianyun shook his head and said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything. After the explanation, he left, let me focus on my practice, and I didn\u2019t say anything else.\u201d\u201cThere should be something, something\u2026 but I thought you are lacking blood qi, you lie even to me.\u201d Shi Xueyun looks a little angry, but the expression on her face is not as angry.Yi Tianyun scratched his head and was embarrassed: \u201cThis is also to give aunt a surprise\u2026\u201dHe is relieved that his aunt somehow believes his random reason.\u201cThis is really a big surprise!\u201d Shi Xueyun reached out and knocked his head and whispered: \u201cI will give you a lesson later. I am about to go to meeting now, you should go back to rest.\u201dYi Tianyun smiled and went back to the house, and Shi Xueyun went to take care of her own business. This matter has just ended, Xiaolian quickly approached Yi Tianyun, excitedly held his hand and said: \u201cYoung Master, you have shown that you are actually really strong!\u201dYi Tianyun has been underestimated for almost his whole life.

He didn\u2019t expect to get these basic level profession. These will be very useful, and he learned not only one but three at once, which means that he suddenly became quite versatile!Although it is a basic level, it is already equal to the existence of third level in this world. In this world, no matter what profession, it is divided into first level, second level, third level, fourth level, fifth level, Master, Grandmaster and Creator.The existence of third level, no matter which profession, it is a good standard, at least \u00a0it is not the lowest level.For example, third level alchemist is enough to refine many middle level pill., There is no alchemist in Heavenly Jade PalaceThat pretty much explains how rare an alchemist is. This is related to their internal attributes as well. Because\u00a0if one\u2019s attribute is ice, they will be having difficulty in alchemy because it uses fire attribute.Therefore, Heavenly Jade Palace requesting help from outside for alchemy, forging weapons, etc.Now that he possesses these ability, he can help forge weapon and conduct alchemy here.Although they are all at the basic level, but as he raise the mastery he can level it up as well just like some of his martial arts.These abilities will naturally level up, and the mastery will start with \u201c0/1000\u201d, which requires more time and material to cultivate. But as long as he keeps practicing he can level it up.\u201cBut now there is more lucky draw opportunities, so let\u2019s get into it.\u201dYi Tianyun is more concerned about this, last time he got the Frost Fist, he doesn\u2019t know what he will get this time!\u201cOpen the lottery system!\u201dA lottery roulette came out immediately, everyone around him couldn\u2019t see it, he\u2019s the only one who could see it. Immediately, he pulled the handle, and the wheel began to spin quickly, pointing the pointer to various categories.\u201cPlease stop at divine ability, please!\u201dHe screamed wildly, the most precious prize was the divine ability. For example is his crazy mode. Every effect is doubled, he was so excited.This roulette seemed to hear his shouting and began to slowly stop, and eventually the pointer slowly stopped on the magical skill!\u201cI really got divine ability!\u201dYi Tianyun exclaimed, he himself is so surprised, a gift bag fell, and he quickly picked it up in. After he opened, the description of the magical skill is displayed.\u300eLuck Aura: Enhance luck by five times and consume a Crazy Point per second.\u300f\u201cLuck Aura?\u201dYi Tianyun certainly knows this, but when it comes to consumption, it really is insane. Consume one every second, this is even more than Crazy Mode! It really is a divine, even the consumption rate is so divine.\u201cIt\u2019s consumption rate is so awful, but it\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s five times more luck. Is it possible to stumble on cash when i randomly walk outside?\u201dHe frowned and immediately went outside the yard, using Luck Aura, and Crazy Point was quickly consumed, every second! This makes Yi Tianyun feel distressed, but he just wants to see how lucky can he be using this skill!He looked around and saw if there would be any random treasures dropping, even watching the sky, if there would be any treasures falling.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYoung Master, what are you doing?\u201d At this time, Xiaolian came over and looked at Yi Tianyun curiously.When she came over, she suddenly slipped and fell in Yi Tianyun\u2019s arms. Fortunately, Yi Tianyun react in time and hold her in his arms swiftly, but when he wanted to say something, Xiaolian raised her head not knowing their face was so close.\u201cAh\u2026 yes, sorry young master, I didn\u2019t mean it\u2026\u201dXiaolian shyly trying to stand back up, and her face was flushed. He didn\u2019t expect to encounter such situation. After she managed to stand back up, she quickly ran away. Although it was an accident, it was really embarrassing!\u201cThis is also another kind of luck i guess\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun reached out and touched his cheek, stopped Luck Aura, and snorted: \u201cBut seems like the effect is not bad after all\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The result was disappointing. He found a broken silver in the corner of his room! No improvement to his martial arts, or finding any spirit fruit anywhere, and so on, there is just not enough reward for this pricey skill.There is no such thing here, unless luck is really heaven defying, he thought that maybe something truly worth it will fall down from the sky.\u201cIf I use it outside, maybe the effect will be much better.\u201dHe wants to try this Lucky Aura on the forest. If he is lucky, he can really find a burried treasures. For the time being, he deactivated the Lucky Aura. It consumes a Crazy Point every second. This consumption rate is very distressing. He only get 5 Crazy Points for killing a snow wolf, that\u2019s it, it can only last for five seconds, and it is very pitiful situation.When he was going to go out for his experimentation, Xiaolian blushes and walks in, not daring to look him in the eye.\u201cYoung Master, Palace Lord called you to attend elder meeting\u2026\u201d\u201cElder meeting?\u201dYi Tianyun immediately guessed that it was about his own affairs. His situation here has been very controversial. This time it is no exception.\u201cThen I am going now, sister Xiaolian, are you going too?\u201d Yi Tianyun asked carefully, not wanting to create an awkward situation again.\u201cNo, the elder meeting is for you to go, I am not qualified to go in.\u201d At least she can look at him in the eye now, so it should be fine.Xiaolian\u2019s cultivation level is not high, she just an attendant in Jade Palace, specializing in serving, so her status is not high among other disciples.Yi Tianyun didn\u2019t say anything else. He began walking toward the meeting. Not long after he arrived in Elder Hall, sitting in front of Shi Xueyun and the other side is three elders, the rest of the elite disciples sitting in Jade Palace are Spirit Refinement Realm, these three elders are all Core Condensation Realm, but they are much older than Shi Xueyun.Yi Tianyun walks in and everyone\u2019s eyes were on him, but it\u2019s different from the usual disgust and dissatisfaction eyes.\u201cWe have already discussed it earlier. In general, there are two problems. The first one is to let Tianyun become a disciple of Jade Palace; the second is that to give him the permission to enter the Heavens Immersing Ancient ruins.\u201d Shi Xueyun solemnly replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the problems here elders?\u201d\u201cIt is undeniable that his performance is surprising, but ever since the establishment of the Jade Palace, we have never approved a male disciple. The rules cannot be broken, and his realm is not that high. If he enters the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, he will suffer! He is the son of a criminal. Giving him shelter is the greatest tolerance!\u201d The first to speak is the Second Elder Jian Yuping, looking at Yi Tianyun eyes with unfriendly gaze.Her arguments are sound, the rules cannot be broken, his cultivation realm are not up to standard, naturally it is impossible to get to where he wants with this achievement. Even with his win in the tournament it still not enough, the rules is not what is wrong here!Yi Tianyun felt uncomfortable. This elder throw sound argument one after another even though he never provoke this Jian Yuping, but since his mother does something that broke the rule, it seems he is the one who must bear the consequences!\u201cI agree with the opinions of Second Elder. The rules are absolute. The male disciples have never received the permission to become inner disciples. If this time we break the rules, it will definitely cause many men from outside to come here and cause great trouble to Jade Palace.\u201d Third Elder Lu Sibing said.\u201cShe is right, we can\u2019t break the rules. However we can compensate other things for this. For example, martial arts, you can let him train what he wants.\u201d The attitude of Great Elder Mo Yu is much better than the others, at least he only complaints about the fact that they got rules that can\u2019t be broken, so nothing personal, and in exchange she gave him compensation, it\u2019s much better.Three elders chose to deny him, which is not surprising at all. It\u2019s just that he has worked hard for the sake of Jade Palace, and it\u2019s really cruel to be treated this way.\u201cOther disciples, do you have any opinions?\u201d Shi Xueyun\u2019s surprisingly calm.The disciples around him looked at each other and choose to remain silent. The elders already said their opinion. Next step for their plan is to drive Yi Tianyun out of the Jade Palace.Shi Xueyun solemnly said: \u201cIt seems that everyone chooses to deny and kick him out, then I also have my own idea about this. Tianyun will become a formal disciple, and he will get entry permit for Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins.\u201d\u201cThis is bad\u201d Yi Tianyun thought, his aunt is completely making a decision based on her own bias, that\u2019s not a good perspective from a leader position.\u201cPalace Lord, that must not happen! This is not in accordance with the rules, it will stain our Jade Palace\u2019s reputation!\u201d Second Elder immediately defend her opinion.\u201cYeah, we cannot allow this, even though just this once, it will definitely be a problem later! For so many years, Jade Palace has not admitted any male disciple!\u201d said Third Elder.Shi Xueyun eyes are cold, solemnly said: \u201cIf I remember correctly, the official disciple recuited long ago was a male, but was changed later on. Is it not possible to change it back now? I\u2019m not saying we will recruit male disciples in the future as well. We only need to recruit one male disciple and only for now!\u201dAnd it\u2019s true though. In the past, Jade Palace had male disciples, he is one of the Ancestor. But because he ran away from his duties, and abandoned other ancestors who had created the palace together, it leads to the revolution of only recruiting women disciples.\u201cTo be honest, according to the performance of Spirit Sect tournament before, if it is not for Tianyun\u2019s effort, not only we will lose an entry permit for Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, but also lose the honor of Jade Palace! Which one is more important to you our reputation or rules?\u201dIn other words, everyone is just being stubborn about the rules and didn\u2019t think what would happen in case they lost the tournament earlier, and aura of Shi Xueyun emitted is so intense, so much that the three elders can\u2019t even compare to her. This is the aura that Palace Lord should have.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dBefore Jian Yuping finished her sentence, Shi Xueyun interrupted: \u201cSecond Elder, i know what\u2019s your intention, you want to give the entry permit Tianyun won for your own disciples. But this is Yi Tianyun\u2019s victory. I don\u2019t give him this entry permit because i treat him specially. If he is still a powerless person, can\u2019t cultivate, and didn\u2019t contribute in any way for this victory then i will back off! But this is what he himself won. He earn that permit himself, by winning the tournament and keeping the reputation of Jade Palace, he deserves this!Yi Tianyun listened to all his aunt word, as expected of the Palace Lord, she is really convincing is what he thought.If it wasn\u2019t for him, let alone the entry permit, Jade Palace will lose its reputation as well, if that were the case, that entry permit itself will no longer be in our handsJian Yuping was so angry that Shi Xueyun saw right through her. She just wanted to let her own disciples to go to this Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins. This is a huge opportunities, how can she let this chance go.\u201cHis realm is too low, I disagree! Even if you go in, you can\u2019t harness Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins full potential, and you might lose your life as well!\u201d Jian Yuping must try to deny Yi Tianyun\u2019s entry no matter what.\u201cHe still has half a year before entering Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins. I think Tianyun can brokethrough to the minimum standard second level of Spirit Refinement Realm in this time, there should be no problem, is there anymore problems that bothers you?\u201d Shi Xueyun smiled lightly.\u201cHe brokethrough to Spirit Refinement Realm?!\u201dThey\u2019re all stunned, they thought that Yi Tianyun cultivation is Body Refinement Realm, they did not expect him to have broken through to Spirit Refinement Realm, it seems that he is even ready to breakthrough to second level of Spirit Refinement Realm!Yi Tianyun smiled lightly, this is just too easy, not to mention that he brokethrough into Spirit Refinement Realm in half a year, even reaching fourth level of Spirit Refinement Realm should be no problem. However, staying here is definitely a problem, there is no more monster that suit his need for exp.\u201cW\u2026 Well, even if that is the case, he can\u2019t be a formal disciple. This is not in accordance with the rules, and at most he can only become outer disciple.\u201d They are still deadset to their ancient rule and stick to that.\u201cThat\u2019s right, he will become outer disciple.\u201d Shi Xueyun very refreshedly agreed, let them all wonder, they thought that Shi Xueyun won\u2019t budge, they didn\u2019t expect her to agree immediately. She accepted it just like that. Anyway, outer disciple or official disciple makes no difference for her, it\u2019s just a name, a mere formalities in the palace.\u201cTianyun, you have to work hard to cultivate, and when you enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, it will become a big opportunity for you to further accelereate your training!\u201d Shi Xueyun said with a heavy heart.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI will do my best!\u201dYi Tianyun looked at her serious expression and nodded.\u300eMain Quest: \u00a0Seize Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins.\u300f\u300eReward: Control of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, 100.000 exp, 10.000 Crazy Points, Sword of Endlessness!\u300fAfter seeing the reward of this main quest, he was shocked, it\u2019s like the reward is just too good to be true!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shi Xueyun just said that second level of Spirit Refinement Realm is actually the minimum qualifications to enter, which means higher level of cultivation is necessary to actually hold your ground in there .He was immersed seeing the reward, but the elders\u2019 faces clearly showing signs of dissatisfaction, especially Second Elder .The quota for entering Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins for his disciples is now gone . Since Shi Xueyun saw through her she can only yield . It\u2019s OK to be outer disciple, but this is an exception . Being an outer disciple at Spirit Refinement Realm, that is really rare .In these ages, someone in such cultivation is definitely a core disciple . Even in the future, he could become a candidate for Palace Lord, but since he is a man, so it is unlikely that he will become Palace Lord .\u201cAnything else?\u201d Shi Xueyun looked at the three elders and asked again .\u201cThat will be all\u2026\u201d looking so bitter these are the only words coming out of their mouth .Too many elements are against Yi Tianyun, his gender, his family background and even his cultivation realm, so at best he could only become outer disciples . As unwilling as they are, they could only agree with Palace Lord in this case .\u201cIf that\u2019s all then, moving on to the next matter, forging weapons . I don\u2019t know who is the blacksmith who supposed to come here today . Has he arrived?\u201d Shi Xueyun asked .\u201cHe is resting in the palace, are we going now?\u201d the elder asked .\u201cNow that the meeting is over, we shall go at once . \u201d Shi Xueyun turned and said to Yi Tianyun: \u201cLet\u2019s go, Master Kong will help you forge a new weapon, it\u2019s not that your gauntlet is a bad weapon, but having a sword, or a spear, will definitely help you fight . \u201dMost people here believe that the longer the reach your weapon, the better, and close range weapon is just like rushing to your death . If you use close range weapon it will take your all just to block or dodge, so it\u2019s better to use weapon like long sword .\u201cThis ah\u2026 that\u2019s OK, considering what happened . \u201d Yi Tianyun certainly does not think that Master Kong can create a good weapon, his Frost Fist, on the other hand although it is common level, but the effect is amazing, the special effect is what makes this weapon amazing .As for the weapons Master Kong forge, can it use Crazy Point? Obviously not, it\u2019s a different story if he\u2019s the one who forge it though .Immediately they came to the palace . This palace is mainly used to receive distinguished guests . Undoubtedly Master Kong is a distinguished guest . He has just arrived, Yi Tianyun saw the middle-aged man sitting in the hall and drinking tea leisurely . He looks rough and looks very burly . His realm is quite high, reaching fourth or fifth level of Spirit Refinement Realm .Although he is weaker than elders here, he can be called a master! The reason is very simple . He belongs to third level Blacksmith and is capable of creating a Spirit Tool . In this world, cultivator is everywhere . But posessing such special skills and reach quite high level to boot, they can be called master!Because even if \u00a0your cultivation realm is high, doesn\u2019t guarantee possessing this special abilities, but with special abilities, it will help in cultivation realm as well in the future . In other words just possessing this profession can heighten your status and fame .\u201cMaster Kong, we need your help to forge three spirit tools this time, you don\u2019t need to worry regarding the price . \u201d Shi Xueyun walked over with a smile, the attitude is very decent, even if she is a Palace Lord, Master Kong\u2019s standing must be respected .The other three elders are smiling .Instead, Master Kong, said to them indifferently: \u201cSpirit tool are not so easy to forge, and the cost is not low either . I have several conditions for this, if you don\u2019t comply the deal is off . \u201d\u201cWhat conditions?\u201d Shi Xueyun asked: \u201cAs long as it is within our power, no problem . \u201d\u201cActually, my conditions are very simple . The first condition is to let my disciples join Jade Palace and become outer disciple . \u201d Master Kong said .\u201cUmm\u2026 ok, no problem . \u201d Shi Xueyun thought quite hard about it, but considering Spirit Sect also have outer disciple here, she agreed in the end . Outer disciple and other disciple will train separately anyway . And different areas usually do not interfere with each other .\u201cThe second condition, the price of the three pieces of the material is expensive, since you agreed to my first condition, we can continue the negotiation . As for the materials for forging the spirit tools, after giving me the money necessary for the materials, i will purchase it myself .\u201cNo problem on that as well, the price of spirit tool is obviously expensive, but I do not know how much you need?\u201d Shi Xueyun asked .\u201cNot high, 10 . 000 gold it is enough . \u201d Master Kong nonchalantly requesting an astonishing price .After they heard it, they are stunned, 10 . 000 gold, this is too expensive! This is really a lot for a small organization like Jade Palace, 10 . 000 gold, which means even one of them cost more than 3 . 000 gold! .Under normal circumstances, People mainly used silver . This means 100,000 silver! And one costs more than 30 . 000, the price is nothing to laugh at .\u201cThis price\u2026 Can you lower it a little?\u201d Shi Xueyun said embarrassedly .Jade Palace is not a big organization . It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t have that much money, but using that much at once will inhibit the functional operation .\u201cThis is the lowest price i can offer, Palace Lord Shi, I believe you should understand the price of Spirit Tools . Buying outside will at least cost you 50 . 000 per spirit tool, compared to the price i offer it\u2019s way cheaper . \u201dThey are all well aware of the price, and it\u2019s just as Master Kong said, that\u2019s why all they can\u2019t do is just smile helplessly at each other .\u201cWell, then, if that is the price you want\u2026 . \u201d Shi Xueyun can only compromise .\u201cThe last condition is actually related to myself . \u201d Master Kong smiled indifferently .\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shi Xueyun\u2019s eyebrow wrinkled, this guy really gives a lot of conditions .\u201cit is not difficult . I fell in love with a disciple here . I wonder if she can become my dao companion . If you allow it, I will give all three Spirit Tools to you for free!\u201d Their expression changed drastically upon hearin his last condition, this is obviously a sweet deal .After hearing his two hard condtions, I did not expect Master Kong to make this request, but Jade Palace does not object to marriage, as long as the two loves each other .Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere is no problem with this, but who is your choice?\u201d Shi Xueyun asked with patience\u201cA disciple named Xiaolian, as long as she promised to be my dao companion, three spirit tools is yours!\u201d Master Kong said with a smile .\u201cLittle Xiaolian!?\u201d Yi Tianyun stunned, did not expect to be Xiaolian!He\u2019s surprised to hear this, it would be fine if Xiaolian is okay with it, but if she is forced to do it, she will never be happy!TN: I am going abroad for 3 days from 24 april to 26 april, so next update will be 27 april .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I wonder if you are willing?\u201d Second Elder asked with a smile, Xiao Lian is considered to have a bad talent, so marrying out, in exchange for three spirit tools is undoubtedly a very good trade .\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry but i can\u2019t comply with your wish\u2026\u201d Xiao Lian looked at Master Kong and immediately shook her head and refused .After this refusal, Master Kong face was contorted to a frown . He is a master, a promising blacksmith . The future achievements are limitless! He did not expect that she \u00a0did not even consider his proposal and straight up refuse him .\u201cI am a third level blacksmith . After you marry me, you will have a better live . I will be fourth or fifth \u00a0level blacksmith in the future, even so, you still refuse to marry me?\u201d Master Kong eyes are full of discontent .\u201cThank you for your kindness Master Kong, but i don\u2019t want to be anyone dao companion for the time being . I hope you can understand that there are other sisters in Jade Palace you can choose from . \u201d Xiao Lian refused Master Kong and she seems didn\u2019t care about Kong feelings at all .\u201cDamn, you are just maidservant, yet you dare to reject me!\u201d Master Kong felt a humiliation and looked at Xiao Lian with cold voice: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be my dao companion, then forget this spirit tool, you must find other master who is willing to forge you one!\u201d\u201cXiao Lian, what are you thinking!\u201d Second Elder hurriedly said: \u201cThis is Master Kong . If you marry him, a mere plebeian like you will be treated like a noble, stop disrespecting him! Your family is not rich people, if you marry him . He will do what you want!\u201dSecond Elder do not want to lose this opportunity . It\u2019s three spirit tools for free? How can she let go of such a sweet deal?Master Kong expression on the high side, coldly watching Xiao Lian, the previous smile disappeared, revealing a cold expression .\u201cLeave at once! Shi Xueyun glared at him coldly \u201cI adress you master as a form of respect! I didn\u2019t expect you to be this arrogant, I\u2019ve had enough! I will ask others to forge the spirit tools for us, I no longer need nor appreciate your help for us any longer!\u201dAs the title suggests a palace lord sure have an intimidating aura, domineering the entire room, who dares to oppose her now that it comes to this? If she gladly accepts then she surely won\u2019t have anything to say, but it will be different when she is being forced, she surely would not be happy .\u201cPlebeian? sister Xiao Lian has always been a noble, what is this you are talking about?\u201d Yi Tianyun was also uncomfortable at this time . He sees Master Kong and laughed: \u201cMaster Kong, it seems that you are not needed anymore . if it\u2019s just a spirit tool, even I can forge it myself!\u201dHe stood up and looked at Master Kong with a smirk .The moment he finished his sentence, they all froze and stare at Yi Tianyun, even Shi Xueyun looked at him with disbelief at first . Being a blacksmith is not something you can do overnight . It takes a long time to be able to forge weapon, not to mention a Spirit Tools . And out of the blue Yi Tianyun boasted that he can create a spirit tool . Isn\u2019t this questionable?She can only think that Yi Tianyun said it out of desperation to stop Master Kong .\u201cYou want to forge spirit tool?\u201d Master Kong sneered and said: \u201cI heard that you are a trash without blood qi, and it seems you have won against Spirit Sect, didn\u2019t expect that you are an idiot as well . \u201dWhen Shi Xueyun heard this, her eyes were cold and murderous . Obviously, his words is out of the line, inciting her anger .Yi Tianyun immediately hold her little hand and stood up and sneered at Master Kong: \u201cThen what if i can forge one?\u201d\u201cIf you can forge a spirit tool, then I will give you this spirit weapon, and I will walk with my head later!\u201d Master Kong took out a long sword, it is indeed a good spirit weapon, but this weapon only belongs at low level spirit grade . But it\u2019s already worth the price, which is 50 . 000 gold . At his level, he can only forge lower level .His eyes were full of disdain, and he felt that he was being provoked . He did not expect to be humiliated too after being rejected by a servant!\u201cIf you can\u2019t, what then? She\u2019ll marry me, how is that?\u201d Master Kong sneered, and even if Xiao Lian married to him, he definitely wouldn\u2019t treat her as a wife, she will be treated as a maidservant, no maybe even worse .He had a high standing and held by a high regard by people, and with this humiliation, it is naturally impossible to treat this Xiao Lian as a wife anymore .\u201cSister Xiao Lian is not a tool, nor a bet!\u201d Yi Tianyun said coldly: \u201cIf I can\u2019t forge a spirit tool, then I will cut an arm, how is that?\u201d\u201cCut one of your arm?\u201d Master Kong smirked and said with a smile: \u201cAlright! If you are willing to go that far . It\u2019s a deal! Begin immediately . If you fail, then cut an arm! If you can\u2019t do it, you can give me an authority of Jade Palace, don\u2019t blame me!\u201dMaster Kong\u2019s realm is not high, but he has good backings . At the very least knowing a few big families and giving some pressure to Jade Palace is not a problem .\u201cNo problem\u201d Yi Tianyun turned to look at Shi Xueyun and then said: \u201cPalace Lord, please give me material of spirit tool, I will forge a spirit tool now . \u201d\u201cDing! get side mission to forge spirit weapon . Mission reward is 5,000 experience, immortal fire . \u201d\u300eQuest: Forge a spirit weapon . \u300f\u300eReward: 5 . 000 exp and Immortal Fire . \u300f\u300eImmortal Fire: Can\u2019t be extinguished, can be used to forge high level tool, or alchemy, can also be used to attack . \u300fHe discovered a new task, and the reward is Immortal Fire! This thing is the best, although it is a low level item, it can be leveled up, this is incredible!They all looked dumbfounded in this scene, especially the three elders, who all thought that Yi Tianyun was stupid . And make a bet too to boot . Does he really know how to forge a spirit tool? Being able to forge a spirit tool at such a young age, is simply genius .Obviously this is just plain impossible . Master Kong is thirty years old and he is still at this level, it is almost unbelievable if Yi Tianyun can actually do this!\u201cAre you crazy, you even dare to say such a things, quickly apologize to Master Kong!\u201d Second Elder snapped .\u201cApologize? why should i apologize to him? It\u2019s just a spirit tool, I can also forge it!\u201d Yi Tianyun sneered: \u201cSister Xiao Lian, everyone can marry whoever they want . You are not a tool!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYoung Master\u2026\u201d Xiao Lian\u2019s eyes reddened . She look guilty and thought this happened because of her .

Considering there will be more people helping to forge weapon here, it would be better to build a new forging room that is bigger .Since this room is relatively new, there is not that much equipment here, that being said, it is enough to forge spirit tool .\u201cThese are the materials originally prepared for Master Kong to forge spirit tool, but we only prepared five sets of materials, in other words only two failure at most for him . \u201d But now that it becomes a challenge for Yi Tianyun, he only needs to successfully forge one Spirit Tool which means he can fail 4 times .\u201cI won\u2019t fail, not even once . \u201d Yi Tianyun said indifferently .He is well aware of the level of the blacksmith skill he obtained earlier, and he\u2019s convinced that he can forge a good spirit tool, but due to the level of his blacksmith skill, he can only forge a low level spirit tool, but that\u2019s good enough, what matters is to prove that he can forge a spirit tool .\u201cYou won\u2019t fail? Not even once?, that\u2019s big coming from you, unless you reach have reached fifth level blacksmith . Your blacksmith level is already that high or what?\u201dIt\u2019s as if Yi Tianyun made fun of him, because even at his age and level he can\u2019t guarantee 100% success to forge a spirit tool, at most he can guarantee 50% . So when Yi Tianyun said he won\u2019t fail, he was so irritated .\u201cI am indeed not a fifth level blacksmith , but who said to forge a successful spirit tool, you must be at least fifth level blacksmith?\u201d Yi Tianyun said a faint sentence, then immediately looked at Shi Xueyun and said: \u201cWhat kind of weapon should I forge?\u201d\u201cA long sword, we mostly use long swords here . \u201d Shi Xueyun said .Yi Tianyun nodded and picked some materials, then he approached the furnace . This furnace is full of ordinary flames, so the process will take a while .However, this won\u2019t be a hindrance, this is just enough to forge a spirit tool .\u201cI want to see how long you can keep this farce up!\u201d Kong master thought that Yi Tianyun was bluffing, he wanted to see his expression when everyone knows he just pretend to be able to forge a spirit tool as revenge for declining his offer .Yi Tianyun is after all an infamous trash who doesn\u2019t possess blood qi and can\u2019t cultivate, now that trash thinks he can forge a spirit tool?Yi Tianyun completely ignored him and was getting ready to put in the materials into the furnace .The three elders chatters inconspicuously, they are so skeptical toward Yi Tianyun . They thought that Palace lord treats Yi Tianyun specially . If he fails, not only we will suffer a great financial loss, but also attract Master Kong\u2019s hostility . It\u2019s like rubbing salt on your wound .\u201cPalace Lord, if he fail\u2026\u201d Third Elder couldn\u2019t help but say .\u201cYou can hold me responsible for that . \u201d Shi Xueyun faintly replied .\u201cPalace Lord, you can\u2019t act on a whim like this, I know that you are pampering him, but you must make decisions logically! What shall we do if he fails? How do we enter the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, if we have no suitable weapon!\u201d She kept worrying about the worst possibilities . She is already unable to get the quota to enter ancient ruins for her disciple . Now, if he fails, even the weapons to enter the ruins are gone .The price of these materials is not cheap, so every failure is extremely distressing .\u201cI will bear any consequences regarding this matter . \u201d Shi Xueyun responded so faintly .Third Elder filled with doubt and dissatisfaction, but since their position and authority is below palace lord, all they can do is retreat to the corner .Third Elder \u00a0did not intervene with the forging, but Second Elder is getting impatient and she keeps jabbering nonsense .\u201cIf he fails, we will report this matter to the ancestors, and leave the decision to them!\u201d Second Elder suddenly added another sentence .In an organization, the oldest is not the elders, but ancestors who have retired, their realms are unfathomable, as the most powerful backing .\u201cFeel free to do so . \u201d Shi Xueyun said faintly .This makes her even more infuriated, because she thinks this is all for for Jade Palace .\u201cPalace Lord, I can\u2026\u201d Xiao Lian felt that things have gone too far, and she felt responsible, then \u00a0whispered to Shi Xueyun .Before she managed to finish her sentence, Shi Xueyun said indifferently: \u201cI believe in him . \u201dXiao Lian glanced up and looked up at Yi Tianyun, she felt a deep admiration toward him for standing up for her .During the conversation, Yi Tianyun put in all the materials into the furnace, and began the process .\u201cHaha, How long are you going to make fool out of yourself? Throwing all the materials at once, you really are dumb! Even if you want to pretend, at least make make it believable!\u201d Kong master pointed at Yi Tianyun\u2019s behavior and laughed .Yi Tianyun ignored him, he channels his spiritual power to the weapon at his own pace, and continuing to temper the weapon .The other elders can only watch from afar now since whatever they say to Shi Xueyun is meaningless now .\u201cIt\u2019s a pity, those good material have become scap now . If only you are not so stubborn and insist to forge the spirit tools without fail, even i can only forge it at 50% chance . But still it\u2019s better than seeing the materials become scrap like this\u2026\u201d Master Kong laughed and thought that Yi Tianyun is only making fun of himself at this rate .Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYi Tianyun remain calm, letting Master Kong say whatever he wants .As time went by, the furnace did not explode, and the material inside gradually began to take shape . Formed a long sword, with the constant tempering, keep shrinking, it looks more and more like a long sword .At this time, Master Kong\u2019s laughter ended abruptly, and his face glared at the sword in the furnace . If he failed, it wouldn\u2019t shape like that, it would instantly become scrap .\u201cThis, this is impossible\u2026 To refine all the materials at once you need absolutely strong control . This is absolutely impossible!\u201d Master Kong began to panic . He thought Yi Tianyun would fail . But that\u2019s not the case .Yi Tianyun showed him he won\u2019t fail, and will keep shaping his future toward success the way he is now .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In his head, he kept swearing at Yi Tianyun, hoping that Yi Tianyun somehow failed to forge that weapon . Otherwise not only he would be humiliated once again he will also lose a spirit tool .At this time, Master Kong and the three elders succumbed to silent . Although they don\u2019t understand all the process of forging, at the very least they know that Yi Tianyun is doing a rather remarkable job In front of them, there is no sign of failure .The elders start to murmur behind him: \u201cWill he actually succeed?\u201dThey are stunned to disbelief . If that is the case, then Yi Tianyun really is a super genius . He can reach this level at a young age . Which means he can reach even higher level in the future? Not only his realm is not low, but he can also forge! How did he learn all this?They couldn\u2019t help but look at Shi Xueyun . They thought Shi Xueyun somehow allowed Yi Tianyun to learn how to forge? They have no other idea how can Yi Tianyun forge .In fact, it is not only them, but even Shi Xueyun are completely stunned . The forging is not easy, and that is completely different challenge than a simple cultivation . The mysterious powerhouse who taught him is so powerful that he knows how to forging right away .Despite the chattering, Yi Tianyun maintains his concentration and continue to temper the long sword inside the furnace, as time goes by . The material slowly but surely shaped into a bright sword .\u201cForging completed!\u201dYi Tianyun shouted, and immediately a long sword was tossed out of the furnace .This long sword flew out, after a spinning in the air, the sword fell down and pierced the ground . The surface of the ground become icy, representing the effect of its ice properties .Some of the materials creating the sword is having a cold properties, so the effect will be amazing .\u300eDing, Congratulations to completed the mission . Get 5 . 000 exp, Immortal Fire!\u300fHe got 5 . 000 exp . Immortal Fire fell into his ability bar and became a unique ability!Not only that, His Forging Mastery is also increased by 10 point, it\u2019s good but he must forge at least a hundred in order to level up . However, if he can forge high level spirit tool, the mastery he earned will certainly be higher, but will undoubtedly increase his chance of failure .If he is forging a low level spirit tool, there will be no chance of failure, because from the system point of view, the success rate is 100%, so he can boast to Master Kong that he won\u2019t fail .\u201cMaster Kong, can you confirm is this a spirit tool?\u201d Yi Tianyun said with a smirk never leaving his face .This does not need to be confirmed at all, as long as that person is not blind, everyone can see the sword sparkling icy attribute, confirming anyone that sees it as a spirit weapon . Although it is low level, he successfully forged it is a fact .Master Kong panicked, and the three elders are stunned! this way, they don\u2019t need to use master Kong service any longer . Yi Tianyun can be his replacement, and of course he won\u2019t charge for his service thus reduce the cost they needed to forge a low level spirit weapon for the disciples . Jade Palace finally has a blacksmith, this is just too good to be true .Shi Xueyun pulled the sword out, she immediately channel the sword with her spiritual power, and the icy blue aura of the sword flashes . After a little wave of the sword, Shi Xueyun looked at Master Kong faintly and said: \u201cThis is indeed a spirit sword . Would you care to try it yourself?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d master Kong was furious, looking at Yi Tianyun and full of malice he said : \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to really forge a spirit tool, you deceived me by deliberately pretend you can\u2019t forge a spirit weapon!\u201d\u201cWhen did I tell you that I can\u2019t forge a spirit weapon?\u201d Yi Tianyun sneered: \u201cI am willing to gamble and you lose, hand over your spirit weapon, and walk out with your head!\u201dMaster Kong action earlier can\u2019t be forgiven easily in Yi Tianyun eyes, he completely insult Xiao Lian who doesn\u2019t do him wrong .\u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself! This gamble is my loss, but all of you conspire to frame me up, you are not interested in asking me to forge weapons, you want my weapon! Master kong shouted his words rebelliously .\u201cYou are joking right? If you didn\u2019t provoke me by insulting sister Xiao Lian, i will just stand still and leave the negotiation to you and the elders . \u201d Yi Tianyun sneered: \u201cNever belittle our Jade Palace again, you better remember that! Although they are all women, but here, women are the real masters, not you!\u201dIn this world, not only in terms of realm, male completely dominates everything in every aspect, so they all look down on female cultivator .Yi Tianyun\u2019s words immediately changed the three elders view of him, they expect him to have the final says regarding his win over Master Kong, but completely out of everyone\u2019s expectation, he compels his rights to everybody else in Jade Palace, this is completely absurd in the eyes of the elders, how can this young man so trustful and respectful despite our treatment toward him?\u201cSister Xiao Lian has her own choice, she\u2019s not a tool . I hope you can respect that . \u201d Yi Tianyun added: \u201cNow you can scram from Jade Palace, of course, walk out with your head!\u201d\u201cTelling me to walk out with my head, who do you think you are?\u201d Master Kong said with cold eyes .\u201cThen perhaps you will comply when i\u2019m the one telling you to?\u201d Shi Xueyun took over the attention and looked at him coldly: \u201cMaster Kong, you promised, be a man and accept the consequences!\u201dYi Tianyun even goes as far as betting his own arm, and Master Kong bets his spirit tool, this is already decided beforehand\u201cOkay, fine!\u201d Master Kong was so angry that he bite his lips, turned around and went out, and said: \u201cI will remember you, don\u2019t think this is the end!\u201d\u201cGo away!\u201dYi Tianyun rushed, and kicked Master Kong out . Master Kong screamed, startled by the suddenness of the attack . It\u2019s not fatal but the power he put into the kick is quite strong . Unexpectedly, Yi Tianyun was so bold that he dare to actually kick master Kong out .Yi Tianyun is not that forgiving, by provoking him, that person should be ready to experience Yi Tianyun\u2019s retaliation, Master Kong not only forced Xiao Lian to marry him, but also insult Jade Palace, Yi Tianyun can\u2019t just let Master Kong get off easily .\u201cYou kid, just you wait!\u201d Master Kong yelled: \u201ctake my advice, don\u2019t ever leave Jade Palace if you want to live a long life!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter threatening Yi Tianyun, he ran straight out . He was alone, meanwhile Yi Tianyun has Shi Xueyun on his side . Rather than fighting a disadvantaged battle he immediately leave, saving himself from more humiliation .\u201cPalace Lord, is this really worth it? Master Kong have a good status in Moon City . If he really find someone to put pressure on us, what should we do?\u201d Second elder still unable to justify Yi Tianyun\u2019s deed .\u201cThis problem is mine alone, I am an outer disciple, what I have done, has nothing to do with Jade Palace!\u201d Yi Tianyun took all the responsibilities, this problem started because of him, if in the future Master Kong retaliates, it will be fine as long as he is the target, and not Jade Palace he is fine with it .The three elders once again was moved by Yi Tianyun words, Yi Tianyun really had the courage!\u201cThis is problems of the entire of our Jade Palace . This Master Kong looks down on our Jade Palace . This is something that elders have witnessed themselves!

Even Yi Tianyun sensed the aura his aunt emitted, he just tried to calm himself down knowing full well that anger is not aimed to him .This is all because she is too timid and tend to keep everything low-profile so Jade Palace doesn\u2019t attract additional threat from outside, instead it encourages other faction to suppress them!\u201cPalace Lord, please don\u2019t make such a rash decision, if this results in a conflict, it will be extremely unfavorable for Jade Palace!\u201d Third Elder could not help but stand up and speak .\u201cIt seems that you worry too much . Do you think Master Kong have that much influence? He\u2019s just a third level blacksmith, Yi Tianyun\u2019s level is higher than him . Do you think there is anyone else beside us here who knows what actually happened?\u201d Shi Xueyun said solemnly .If Yi Tianyun\u2019s level is higher than Master Kong, those clans that usually request help from him will eventually realize, and they are sure to be inclined to come here instead of favoring Master Kong .What\u2019s necessary is the strong, not the weak!\u201cYi Tianyun\u2019s level is a little higher, but the gap between them is not that big, so it \u2018s not like we have big advantage or anything, plus nobody else actually knows about Yi Tianyun\u2019s capabilities in forging, so compared to Master Kong who has been a blacksmith his whole life, obviously he is more renowned . \u201d Second Elder retorted .\u201cSo there is no problem if my level is much higher than him?\u201d Yi Tianyun said indifferently: \u201cIf that is the case, then I will show you once again . I will forge several spirit tools . After seeing the result, you will know the difference . \u201dAlthough these three elders kept pointing out his flaw, it is undeniably for the sake of Jade Palace . In order to reduce Shi Xueyun\u2019s burden, what he can do for now is stand up and help .Immediately Yi Tianyun once again put in the material into the furnace and began to forge spirit tool . He was doing the exact same steps as before except for one, after he put all the material into the furnace he put in the Immortal Fire he obtained earlier, and quickly tempered the materials .The combustion process is a lot faster, and the extraction rate of impurities is improved!\u201cThis, what kind of fire is this?\u201d everyone is looking at it intensely . Blacksmith usually have some kind of special flame . They are all born with a strong fire within them, or they can absorb a special flame later on .They didn\u2019t expect Yi Tianyun to have this special flame!Of course, Shi Xueyun is not an exception either, She genuinely thought it is incredible, so incredible she almost didn\u2019t believe her eyes . They are all speculating, how is it possible for Yi Tianyun to be capable of forging weapons, not to mention spirit tools, they also did not expect him to have a special flame, which means when he challenged Master Kong earlier, he\u2019s not even serious?Although that\u2019s not the case . Yi Tianyun was definitely trying his best earlier, and he obtain Immortal Fire after he finish the quest, if he obtain Immortal Fire prior to it, obviously he would use it in the challenge earlier .And finally he finished it, he firmly held it in his own hand to confirm its quality . This sword is better than the previous one, and it is cold . At the very least it belongs to middle level!\u201cMiddle level spirit tool?!\u201d After they saw it, they were shocked . The price difference between lower and middle level was huge .For the time being, regardless of the power, the price difference is about two or three times . For example, lower level spirit tool costs 30 . 000, and middle level spirit tool to at the very least will cost 60 . 000 or higher .\u300eDing, congratulations to got 50 blacksmith mastery . \u300fAfter successfully forging middle level spirit tool, mastery increased by fifty points, five times the amount compared to earlier . At this rate, leveling up the blacksmith skill won\u2019t be as difficult . It\u2019s all thanks to Immortal Fire, not to mention when he forges using Immortal Fire, its mastery also increased just like his martial arts .Immortal Fire also increases the success rate, success rate of forging middle level Spirit Tool at Yi Tianyun\u2019s level originally is only 30%, due to Immortal Fire it increases the success rate to 80%, it is not 100% so fortunately, he didn\u2019t fail this one, otherwise it would be really embarrassing .\u201cIt\u2019s really a middle level spirit tool, you can forge middle level spirit tool too?\u201d They were all shocked, even though Yi Tianyun himself is as surprised as everyone else .This is the best proof he can show everyone for now .This time they have nothing to say, what else can you say? This strength is much more powerful than that Master Kong . To the side of the family there, a group of people have invited him to be a guest .\u201cElders, how is this compared to Master Kong\u2019s goods?\u201d Yi Tianyun said indifferently .\u201cI will prepare the materials at once\u2026\u201d Great Elder is convinced of Yi Tianyun\u2019s capabilities . In the end, Shi Xueyun is absolutely right, she has faith in him, which we don\u2019t have .\u201cPalace Lord, if there\u2019s nothing else, I will excuse myself for now\u2026 I will heed your instructions later . \u201d Second Elder sighed deeply, she can\u2019t look down on him anymore . He managed to reach this level, her disciples are no longer qualified to compete with him .This is the benefit of possessing additional skill like blacksmith, it gives you advantage, additional option, etc .Third Elder also excuses herself, she has no choice but to acknowledge Yi Tianyun . However, this matter has a great impact on them . Shi Xueyun will undoubtedly be even more respected in the future . Just like what she said, Jade Palace cannot keep their heads down and remained suppressed any longer .Because this is the case regarding Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins . Spirit Sect is trying to forcefully snatch their entry permit . They think we are weak because we kept giving in to their conditions to the point where they challenged us to a duel and the one losing have to give the entry permit to the one winning! Obviously the challenge us because they don\u2019t even see us as a threat .Every faction has a different amount of entry permit granted to them . Jade Palace only got two . If we ended up losing in the duel against Spirit Sect earlier, there will be only one permit remaining, and it will be even more embarrassing for us .After they left, Yi Tianyun handed the spirit sword left by Master Kong to Xiao Lian: \u201cSister Xiao Lian, this sword is for you . \u201d\u201cThis, this\u2026 Young master i can\u2019t accept this, this is a spirit sword!\u201d Xiao Lian hurriedly refused .Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSpirit sword is still a sword, Master Kong harasses you earlier, at the very least take this to relieve yourself from anger toward him!\u201d Yi Tianyun laughed .\u201cYi Tianyun said it is yours . This is only lower level spirit sword . As you can see he can forge middle level spirit tool . This sword is nothing for him . \u201d Shi Xueyun persuaded Xiao Lian to take the sword .\u201cWell, then i\u2019ll take you up on it, thank you young master, thank you Palace Lord!\u201d Xiao Lian was so excited that she could get a sword . It will help her a lot . Most disciples in the palace had no spirit tool, yet she has one .\u201cThen I will continue to forge the rest of the materials, so when the time comes we\u2019ll be ready . \u201d Yi Tianyun said with a smile: \u201cIt is better to bring out all the materials, i\u2019ll keep forging several spirit swords for my sisters here, so no one will look down on us anymore!\u201dBeing able to forge spirit tool is just so awesome, other benefits is he can increase the mastery for his blacksmith skill, when it leveled up later on he\u2019ll be able to forge something even better that spirit tool .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jade Palace usually doesn\u2019t have enough money to hire a third level blacksmith . Their service is quite expensive and The material fee was nothing to sneer at as well so they are struggling to make Spirit Tools .Now that they discovered Yi Tianyun\u2019s capability in forging, undoubtedly they can make more Spirit Tools with less money . This is enough to strengthen the entire Jade Palace, absolutely cost-effective!\u300eQuest: Completed Mission From Shi Xueyun . \u300f\u300eReward: 5 . 000 exp and 10 favorability . \u300f\u201cAh, I acquired a task\u2026 there is favorability this time?\u201dYi Tianyun squatted, he did not expect this kind of favorability to improve, thinking back, his previous tasks, are all to collect stuffs or defeat enemies, none of them is to help someone . Defeating enemies obviously only increases the value of hatred, and does not increase the favorability whatsoever .This special point is Shi Xueyun\u2019s affection for him .\u201cCan i see my aunt favorability though?\u201d Yi Tianyun immediately saw favorability of Shi Xueyun on him is 330 points .He didn\u2019t know what how the measurement works, but the system quickly categorize it .0 favorability \u2013 passerby .10 favorability \u2013 acquaintance .100 favorability \u2013 good friends .200 favorability \u2013 loved ones .300 favorability or more \u2013 life and death .Generally it categorizes into these stages, and the same amount for negative favorability is applied, but he realized about this explanation a tad too late, if he realized sooner and have a look at Master Kong\u2019s favorability it\u2019s definitely a negative amount .\u201cIt turns out that my aunt favorability for me is so high\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun didn\u2019t expect it to be already at the level of life and death\u2026 he wonders whether increasing Shi Xueyun\u2019s favorability any further will have any effect?\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?, you\u2019re looking at me so intensely, is there something on my face?\u201d Shi Xueyun blinked and wondered why Yi Tianyun stared at her .\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just that my aunt is so beautiful . \u201d Yi Tianyun smiled .\u201cFlattery will get you nowhere young man!\u201d Shi Xueyun gently hit him, while blushing, and immediately shouted: \u201cI will prepare the materials beforehand, you get ready!\u201dSoon a bunch of materials is ready to be forged, Yi Tianyun began his mass forging .\u300eDing, Congratulations successfully forge a middle level spirit tool, mastery increased by 50, and earned 1 . 000 exp!\u300fHe got middle level spirit and at the same time, earn get 1 . 000 exp .

Then a brilliant idea struck him, he immediately activated Crazy Mode when he is almost done forging, and the experience bonus doubled!Although it consumes a Crazy Point, it is still worthwhile . It gives twice the amount of experience, but unfortunately the mastery is not doubled as well .So he continue this, activating Crazy Mode when he\u2019s about to finish forging, and deactivate it again repeatedly until he used up all the materials, otherwise he won\u2019t have enough \u00a0Crazy Point if he activate it the whole time .\u300eDing, Congratulations succesfully forge a middle level spirit tool, mastery increased by 50, and earned 2 . 000 exp!\u300fHe got a bunch of exp, meanwhile average blacksmith just get Spirit Tool after forging, he got exp, and Blacksmith mastery as well .Not long after he used up all the materials and forged a total of eight spirit tools .

Now that he has immortal fire, it would be much easier to refine pill .\u201cReally?\u201d Shi Xueyun hugged him and ecstatically said: \u201cGreat, if that is the case, we don\u2019t need to beg anyone\u2019s help anymore!\u201dYi Tianyun touched his nose, feels the warm fragrance, this warmth really puts him at ease\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have any herb here, we have no choice but to go outside and buy it . \u201d Shi Xueyun didn\u2019t care too much, and immediately said: \u201cI have a better idea, I will order someone to purchase some herbs and materials for Spirit Tools as well!\u201d\u201cPurchase\u2026outside\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun\u2019s eyes lit up .

So, I will send An Ling and Qin Xue with you, they are both companions who will enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins . With this opportunity, you can get to know them, so it will be easier to cooperate with them later on . \u201d\u201cNo problem, i\u2019ll do as you say . \u201d Yi Tianyun smiled, this is not bad, they will enter the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins together later, if he doesn\u2019t get on their good sides how will they cooperate later?\u201cThat\u2019s good, I will arrange it now!\u201d Shi Xueyun happily walk out to talk to the elders .Looking at Shi Xueyun, Yi Tianyun felt warmth from her .

She was discussing something with two young girls. When he approached, Shi Xueyun turned her head and smiled at him: \u201cCome here, this is An Ling and Qin Xue. They are going to purchase materials with you this time. If you don\u2019t understand anything you can ask them on the way.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m counting on you my sisters, even though i\u2019m experienced please bear with me\u201dYi Tianyun looked at them. They look pretty cute in white dress. They doesn\u2019t seem to be interested in normal human anyway. These two are at the 5th Level of Spirit Refinement Realm. On this cultivation usually people are pretty rational.Yi Tianyun appeals them with his attitude, he greets them very politely hopefully increase favorability from them.Afterwards, he immediately checked their favorability: 35 and 32. It definitely increased even though only slightly. Using this opportunity he had to increase their favorability. Because even if you add 10 points from quest, it is not enough.It is totally undersandable that their favorability toward him was extremely low, and even negative favorability is possible. Later on it will definitely improve. To improve favorability doesn\u2019t have to complete quest, even normal conversation and interaction can definitely improve favorability.\u201cJunior brother, you won an entry permit for the Jade Palace, and you have earned a lot of respect from eveyone by then, now you can forge spirit tools as well!. This time we are appointed by Palace Lord to be your escort\u201d they said.\u201cIt is my honor to have two beautiful sisters as guards!\u201d Yi Tianyun smiled.They smiled, they are flattered to hear such compliment. They gave off a vibe of a beautiful sister. They barely interact with men. But they didn\u2019t hate competent men. Especially now that Yi Tianyun is young master, and the only blacksmith in the entire Jade Palace, not to mention he can forge spirit tool!\u201cOkay, okay, that\u2019s enough small talk now, before it gets dark.\u201d Shi Xueyun realized Yi Tianyun kept praising these two and urge him to quickly depart.Yi Tianyun smiled and walked out together.Outside the gate of the Jade Palace, a carriage has been prepared for their departure. The coachman is an ordinary person who will take them to Wind City.\u201cUse This storage ring, there is some gold inside, and the spirit sword that you forged earlier as well, sell the extra spirit sword, buy materials, and then return here, and you can forge it again.\u201d Shi Xueyun handed over a ring to him.Yi Tianyun receive it, toy with it in his hand before finally put it on his finger, he could channel spiritual power into it and see what\u2019s inside it. The size of the space is about tens of square meters, not too big, and there are many gold and spirit swords inside.This thing is really awesome, it can store a lot of things, because they have a lot of swords to bring, it will be inconvenient to transport it to the carriage.\u201cWe will bring a lot of profit when we get back!\u201d Yi Tianyun smiled.\u201cDing, take the next task: purchase materials back to Jade Palace. Complete the reward for 10.000 exp, 1.000 gold, one lucky draw opportunity, and improve the overall favorablity of 20 points.\u201d\u300eQuest: Purchase material back to Jade Palace.\u300f\u300eReward: \u00a010.000 exp, 1.000 gold, one lucky draw opportunity, and improve the overall favorablity of 20 points.\u300fThis makes it even better since Shi Xueyun requested it anyway, so completing the task means even more reward, not to mention additional 20 points of favorability, would be a waste not to do it considering such a lot of rewards waiting for him!After they got in the carriage, Yi Tianyun asked: \u201cSenior sister An Ling, we are going to Wind City to purchase material, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, we are heading to Wind City.\u201d An Ling nodded.\u201cHmmmm\u201d Yi Tianyun squinted, this will be the first time he come to Wind City,But he knows somebody else who might be there, and that is Master Kong.Before going back to Moon City, Master Kong seems to have some business with a clan he is acquaintanced with in Wind City. \u201cI wonder if i will bump into them somewhere later\u201d.\u201cHe definitely won\u2019t involve himself with me anymore\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun squinted. Because he is definitely still frustrated. Yet if he would like to make trouble he would\u2019ve done it back then.After two days of rushing, they finally came to Wind City, and they were safe along the way.\u201cIs this Wind City?\u201dYi Tianyun looked around. The huge city gate looks quite awesome. People come and go, and you can see lively streets filled with people. The guards at the entrance are in quite high level of Spirit Refinement Realm and the expression is serious. No one dares to cause a ruckus.When they were about to enter the city, there was somebody shouting: \u201cMake way, don\u2019t block the road!\u201dYi Tianyun looked around curious about what happened from the carriage, saw a carriage ran across the road, completely ignoring any passers-by. A lot of civilians run away from them, they don\u2019t want to be hit by that carriage, the coachman riding that carriage is so arrogant, he doesn\u2019t give a damn about other people on the street!The guards wanted to stop them. But when they saw the emblem on the carriage, they quickly retreated to the side: \u201cMake way, if you don\u2019t want to die!\u201dIn the end they helped the coachman to drive people away. Even though he\u2019s not proud of himself for doing this, all he could do is only watch the carriage passed by and head into the city gate.The people around are speculating about who is sitting inside.\u201cNo wonder he is so arrogant, it is the carriage of Wing Sect, even if they have quite an influence here, isn\u2019t that too much?\u201d Qin Xue shook his head.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cit\u2019s not like i understand where they\u2019re coming from, Wing Sect is even more famous and respected than Spirit Sect, and They also have permit to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, not to mention they have four entry permits!\u201d An Ling sighed, they can\u2019t mess around with them.\u201cWing Sect?\u201dSo they are a blacksmith sect. Wing Sect consists of a large number of blacksmith, exclusively train to master the art of forging. Even that carriage was one of their own product. Even If it is not a super strong one, he won\u2019t be able to destroy it easily.It can be said that the people inside are undoubtedly quite safe. You can immediately grasp how high the level of Wing Sect only from seeing this carriage. This carriage is equal to upper level spirit tool, which costs really expensive.It\u2019s just that even though they\u2019re so wealthy, they\u2019re also arrogant, savage and don\u2019t care about other\u2019s lives.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Show these people the exit please, they don\u2019t belong here!\u201d Master Kong shouted to the guard next to him: \u201cAnd how can a resident of the slums casually come in here like it\u2019s nothing, how outrageous!, this\u2019ll just stain Wind Pavilion\u2019s reputation!\u201d\u201cSorry, Master Kong, I will drive them out right away!\u201d The guard\u2019s expression suddenly changed, then he coldly said : \u201cWe have rules here, people in the slums can\u2019t enter, please take your leave!\u201dAnd even though Yi Tianyun is a guest here as well, of course they will favor Master Kong instead of Yi Tianyun . .Yi Tianyun was angry in his heart: \u201cWhy can\u2019t resident from slum enter? My dress code is just fine, can\u2019t you let this slide?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pointless for her to be here anyway since she doesn\u2019t have money, please leave . \u201d The guards insisted .Next to him Jiu Lingyun bite her lips, what she worried the most is not being driven out by others, but to involve Yi Tianyun in this matter as well, she\u2019s afraid Yi Tianyun will be humiliated because he brought her here .\u201cI, I will leave right n\u2026\u201d before Jiu Lingyun finished her sentence, a few pieces of gold fell in her hands, it worth ten of thousand silver .\u201cSo how about now?\u201d Yi Tianyun said, trying to hold back his anger .\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d When the guard saw those pieces of gold, he was speechless and turned to look at Master Kong .\u201cWe don\u2019t welcome you here . I don\u2019t care how much gold you have . Once a plebeian will always be plebeian . \u201d Master Kong keep throwing insult .Hearing that, Jiu Lingyun\u2018s body went limp as if strength has left her body, and her eyes were red and teary . She wanted to say something, but she is afraid of Master Kong\u2019s status, so she chose to remain silent .\u201cYes, she certainly is a plebeian, but there\u2019s still something else lower, a beast-like human, compared to that I\u2019d say she is way much better . \u201d Yi Tianyun smiled at the side, reached out and patted her shoulder, indicating that she should not worry so much .\u201cWho is a beast you say?\u201d Master Kong was angry and pointed at Yi Tianyun\u2019s face with anger .\u201cI never said it\u2019s you though, but to think it rubs you the wrong way, maybe you are one then . \u201d Yi Tianyun turned to look at the guard, said solemnly: \u201cYes he is a guest, but we are a guest as well, you think you can treat us like this?\u201d\u201cI am an honorable guest here, I can drive you out easily!\u201d Master Kong said coldly: \u201cSend them out!\u201dHe ordered the guards to capture them . Although he wanted to settle this with Yi Tianyun, but if he told Shi Xueyun about it he would be in trouble . Yes he is an honorable guest, with quite high status too, but that does not mean he can mess around with Jade Palace!\u201cIt\u2019s not just a guest, but where is the one in charge here, I have something to tell him!\u201d Yi Tianyun said indifferently .\u201cWho died and make you the boss? Wanted to meet Pavilion Lord you say?\u201d Master Kong sneered, and he was very disdainful .\u201cWhat\u2019s with the ruckus?\u201d At this time a middle-aged man came forward, he moved so elegantly easily earn everyone\u2019s respect .\u201cPavilion Lord Liang, you came just right . This kid, not only he has framed me before, and now as if to purposefully spit on my face he brought a resident from the slums here . It makes me uncomfortable, i also feel bad for Wind Pavilion, bringing her here only cause anxiety to the guests!\u201d Master Kong said coldly: \u201cPlease drive this kid out along with that girl from the slum!\u201d\u201cWell?\u201d Pavilion Lord Liang looked at Yi Tianyun and his companions, his brow wrinkled, just wanted to say something, when he saw An Ling and Qin Xue, he was a bit surprised .\u201cPavilion Lord Liang, Don\u2019t you think your guest is too rude? We are from Jade Palace . We are coming here to do business, aren\u2019t we considered guests?\u201d Qin Xue couldn\u2019t help but stand up and give him a piece of her mind .Master Kong\u2019s words are just too harsh, they don\u2019t mind it too much, they know that\u2019s just how Master Kong is .\u201cIt turns out that you are the people of Jade Palace . It is no wonder that the two of you are so temperamental . \u201d Pavilion Lord Liang smiled and immediately said to Master Kong, \u201cWherever they are from, they are a customer nonetheless, as long as they\u2019re here to just to do business it\u2019s all fine right? Money has no fault right?\u201dHe can\u2019t afford to offend either side . Granted, Master Kong is their honorable guest, but Jade Palace although their influence is not that big, they\u2019re pretty strong . He can\u2019t afford to provoke them .Wind Pavilion has quite an influence as well, but it\u2019s neutral they specialize in trading, so they can\u2019t cause unnecessary troubles .\u201cPavilion Lord Liang, mark my words . If you insist on welcoming them, then I will be the one leaving!\u201d Master Kong was furious, making him choose either one of them .Pavilion Lord Liang face changed, this is indeed troublesome, but he did not think twice, and immediately said to Yi Tianyun: \u201ci\u2019m really sorry, but i\u2019ll have to ask you to leave\u2026\u201dHe speaks politely trying not to provoke them, but the fact that he chose Master Kong over the name Jade Palace infuriated Qin Xue and An Ling, so much that they\u2019re about to withdraw their sword .In fact, the name of Jade Palace must be louder than Master Kong . That is only a Master Kong is a guest, can help them create a spirit, the meaning is different .\u201cThis is unbelievable\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright whatever, I don\u2019t give a damn anymore, you better remember your choice today Pavilion Lord Liang!\u201d Yi Tianyun reached out and stopped Qin Xue, indicated that they should act impulsive . Then they immediately leave .\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong? Where did all your confidence earlier go? Wind Pavilion is my turf don\u2019t you dare come back here!\u201d Master Kong sense a victory over Tianyun and he can\u2019t hide his satisfaction .Pavilion Lord Liang frowned, and immediately shook his head and said nothing .When they left, Jiu Lingyun cried, and apologized: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s all because of me\u2026\u201d\u201cI am not blaming you, in fact, Master Kong has a grudge against us, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong . \u201d Yi Tianyun looked around, there is another Pavilion across Wind Pavilion, it\u2019s not as luxurious as Wind Pavilion, but It ran the same business it\u2019s called \u201cRain Pavilion\u201d .Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe two have been in a competitive relationship, but now it is clear that Wind Pavilion is slightly better . They couldn\u2019t enter Wind Pavilion, so they went into Rain Pavilion instead .\u201cLet\u2019s go to this Pavilion instead, I will make them regret their choice!\u201dQin Xue and An Ling face each other, do not know what Yi Tianyun plan to do, all they can do is follow him .When they arrived at the Rain Pavilion, when the shopkeeper welcome them, he instantly took out ten Spirit Tools and said: \u201cI will sell these to you, and I need your help!

But it turns out more and more people came to Rain Pavilion to buy Spirit tools including the regulars at Wind Pavilion .Although it\u2019s not that cheap, but it\u2019s clearly cheaper than Wind Pavilion\u2019s spirit tool! Why bother buying the more expensive one when there\u2019s a cheaper one right?Rain Pavilion is flooded by customers, and Zi Yuwei has been giggling non stop, this result has greatly exceeded her expectations . Yi Tianyun is like a god who descended from the heaven . He helped them to attract a lot of customers and improved their sales .\u201cPavilion Lord Zi, headquarters will definitely acknowledge your position!\u201d The elders next to her are also smiling .Zi Yuwei nodded with a smile and looked at Yi Tianyun, who was constantly forging spirit tool in the distance . He sighed: \u201cThanks to Young Master Yi, who came to help me in this difficult time, even though you simply use us to suppress Wind Pavilion, but this is exactly what we need! Now all we need to do is constantly prepare materials for Young Master Yi, our leftover material is useful too, killing two birds with one stone!\u201d\u201cThe most important thing is that this Young Master Yi has never failed, not even once . This is really surprising . The average blacksmith fail at least a couple of times by now . \u201d The elders next to him agreed .Then, after successfully forged another spirit tool .\u300eDing! Congratulations, Blacksmith mastery level up!\u300fHis Blacksmith skill leveled up! Which means that he can forge upper level Spirit tool now, and possibly the true spirit tool . Now he reached Intermediate level for Blacksmith, increase the success rate of forging spirit tool, able to forge upper level spirit tool, and there is a chance to forge true spirit tool!Even though using the same material, spirit tools forged by a higher level Blacksmith will be more expensive as well .\u201cToo bad It\u2019s not a true spirit tool . The probability of failure suddenly increases to 50% . The probability of true spirit tool is only 10%\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun shook his head, but this is still better .

    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27After Rain Pavilion managed to sell a lot of Spirit Tools, Wind Pavilion finally made their move .\u201cReporting to Pavilion Lord Zi, Wind Pavilion is selling the spirit tools with a price 10 . 000 lower than us!\u201dAnd that\u2019s how the vie begin with both sides trying to sell their Spirit Tools cheaper than each other . Yi Tianyun honestly thought that Wind Pavilion would just sit and watch and let Rain Pavilion exhaust their materials, but clearly they can\u2019t hold still any longer .This is because usually, Rain Pavilion can\u2019t compete against Wind Pavilion due to limited amount of resources both their funds and materials . Now, thanks to Yi Tianyun, Rain Pavilion can make up for their lack of funding to hire a Blacksmith, and because of their cheap spirit tools it attracts customers to buy other stuff too because they think it might be cheaper there as well, this will make Rain Pavilion more preferable than Wind Pavilion .This fact made Wind Pavilion unable to sit and watch anymore thus they tried to compete in terms of price as well .\u201cThey finally make their move?\u201d Yi Tianyun smiled and said: \u201cBut i think we don\u2019t have that many spirit tools left right?\u201dHe has refined dozens of spirit weapons, this number is not really that much . However, in Wind City, the demand of the spirit weapon is not that high, so now that they sold quite a lot there shouldn\u2019t be that many customers here left to begin with . This is known trough the statistic from wind pavilion customers who bought spirit tools in the past . The quantity is already dropped, not as crazy as before .\u201cAlmost, this time because of the price cuts, the stock is already depleted . \u201d Zi Yuwei nodded, she thought this is their limit, they can\u2019t suppress Wind Pavilion any further .\u201cWhat if we also lower the price of upper level weapons?\u201d Yi Tianyun said faintly .\u201cIf the price of upper level spirit tool is lowered, it will certainly be able to attract even more customers, it does make sense . \u201d Zi Yuwei analyzed .The price of the upper level spirit tools is very high, basically, the price for forging the weapon is around 200 . 000 silver, if someone want to buy it from the market, the price easily reach 300 . 000 to 400 . 000 silver, it is close to the price of 3 low level spirit weapon .If they will only make it cheaper by 1 . 000 or 2 . 000 silver it really is not a problem, because upper level spirit weapon sure is expensive .\u201cThen we will make it cheaper by 50 . 000 silver?\u201d Yi Tianyun said indifferently .Zi Yuwei just smile at Yi Tianyun and said: \u201cThis, this is not impossible, the price of materials is almost the same as the lower spirit weapon, just \u00a0a little more material needed for the upper level spirit weapon, so we don\u2019t need to worry about the material cost . The only problem here is the success rate of upper level is so low . If it fails too often, it is not worth the cost . \u201d\u201cNot a problem, we need to keep our momentum, we need to keep on overwhelming Wind Pavilion! Keep pulling their customers, but we need to make our market more preferable in the future too . \u201d Yi Tianyun blinked .\u201cThis, this\u2026 hold on boy, you are saying you will forge the spirit tools yourself?\u201d Zi Yuwei is dumbfounded by Yi Tianyun statement, the same can be said to An Ling and Qin Xue that heard Yi Tianyun .\u201cYes, is there any problem?\u201d Yi Tianyun smirked, although the success rate is not 100%, but with the lucky aura, there is no need to worry about the success rate, and even if he doesn\u2019t rely on the lucky aura, the success rate is still more than 50% .\u201cBrother, you really will refine an upper level spirit weapon?\u201d An Ling said still shocked by Yi Tianyun words, Yi Tianyun is too young to be capable of forging upper level spirit tool, everyone under 30 years old is considered young, and normally nobody around that age can forge upper level spirit tools .He seems to be younger than twenty years old, and it will be an incredible feat to be able to refine high level spirit weapons .\u201cWill I bother to say it If i can\u2019t forge it myself?\u201d Yi Tianyun looked at the stunned Zi Yuwei and smiled: \u201d Rain Pavilion only need to prepare the materials, and we only take 30% out of the profits you make . \u201dThe materials are provided by Rain Pavilion, then the sales share is definitely only 30% . But this is entirely different than lower level spirit weapon deal, Rain Pavilion definitely will earn more money with the sales of high level spirit weapon .\u201cAs long as Young Master Yi can maintain a certain success rate, we can provide 40%, no\u2026 50% of the sale profits!\u201d Zi Yuwei feels really excited about this deal . If this is really successful Rain Pavilion can attract more customers and ensure their market\u2019s popularity in the future .Even if Wind City have many Blacksmith, but the amount that can make upper level spirit weapon is not that many, and even those who can, still have a really low success rate .\u201cI\u2019ll definitely live up to your expectations, you only need to provide materials, leave the rest to me!\u201dYi Tianyun\u2019s approach seems like fool\u2019s behaviour at first glance . But, because he is the one who come up with this idea, he obviously knows the loophole \u2013 he breakthrough to Third Level Spirit Refinement! There will be no pressure of failing if he can breakthrough to the Fourth or Fifth Level Spirit Refinement .The conditions is that Rain Pavilion need to provide more materials for him to forge, the selling prices is already agreed to be lowered therefore he only needs to successfully forge the upper level spirit tools .\u201cMaterials are definitely not a problem, as long as Young Master Yi can really provide the higher spirit weapons, I\u2019ll definitely give you more shares on the profit!\u201d Zi Yuwei is not a fool, even if she divided more profit with Yi Tianyun she still got a large profit .Yi Tianyun smiled and said nothing . He began to forge a upper level spirit tool . The success rate is only 55%, but using lucky aura, it instantly increased to 100%!Because the lucky aura consumes Crazy Point per second, Looking at his Crazy Point he only had 100 point, he laughed at the fact he can only use lucky aura around 100 seconds . The consume rate is just insane, but it\u2019s okay as long as he doesn\u2019t excessively use it .The most difficult step is adjusting the forging power, and so he only needs to use lucky aura at that point .Although for that period he will need to spend at least 10 \u00a0Crazy Point .\u201cSuccessful!\u201dFor the first time, he successfully created an upper level weapon .Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u300eDing!

If Master Kong didn\u2019t provoke Yi Tianyun earlier , will there be such an opportunity in Rain Pavilion? Now let alone making profit, they are losing their precious customer .Master Kong was stunned . At this point how can he think Yi Tianyun is a trash? Even though he saw Yi Tianyun forge a spirit tool firsthand, he still didn\u2019t believe it, and now he found himself speechless after Yi Tianyun forge so many spirit tools .\u201cPavilion Lord Liang, I suspect that they are here to spy on us, yes! They\u2019re definitely spies sent by Rain Pavilion!\u201d Master Kong began to talk nonsense, and shifting the blame to Yi Tianyun .Pavilion Lord Liang already got a glum expression on his face, and now Master Kong still dared to talk his way out of this . Yi Tianyun is clearly from Jade Palace, How could he be a spy from Rain Pavilion? Because real spies won\u2019t associate themselves with any faction . Associating themselves with any faction means becoming enemy of that faction\u2019s enemy as well, it\u2019s not a wise move .Suddenly, a guard hastily run upstairs in from the outside, panting . The moment he saw Pavilion Lord Liang he shouted: \u201cBad news!\u2026 Rain Pavilion starts selling upper level spirit tool at the price, the price\u2026 50 . 000 silver lower than ours!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dThey\u2019re all stunned, because upper level spirit tool is very rare, so there is no need to lower the price that much . There are only a few possible reason Rain Pavilion reduce the price that much . The first is there are too many upper level spirit tool, and the second is because the demand is too low, causing the price to plummet! And if they don\u2019t reduce it as well they\u2019ll lose more customers .Because the reputation of Rain Pavilion has skyrocketed, more more people will prefer doing business with Rain Pavilion than Wind Pavilion . The only solution they have is for Palace Lord Liang to negotiate with Rain Pavilion hoping they would stop their tactics to reduce the price .Even though Rain Pavilion managed to sell a lot of spirit tools, that\u2019s not necessarily the case in the future, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is Wind Pavilion and it has tarnished their name .If this is considered a fight, this is already a lost for Wind Pavilion, even though there is a possibility to recover in the future a lost is a lost . Moreover, if this keeps up, they won\u2019t even have that chance to recover .\u201cThey reduce the price again, moreover it\u2019s upper level spirit tool this time, the owner of Rain Pavilion is crazy!\u201d it\u2019s getting on Pavilion Lord Liang\u2019s nerve, this situation is far worse than before, it\u2019s not a problem if they only have one or two upper level spirit tool, because Rain Pavilion also had their own stock, but if somehow they have around seven, or even worse a dozen! then this is absolutely bad news for Wind Pavilion\u2026\u201cWho forges it?\u201d Pavilion Lord Liang hurriedly asked .\u201cAccording to our spies over there, the name is Yi Tianyun, disciple of Jade Palace . \u201d The guards reported .\u201cThat guy again!\u201d Pavilion Lord Liang who was holding a cup of tea can\u2019t contain his anger any longer, he screamed and slam the cup to the ground, clank!Master Kong is so bitter, he didn\u2019t see this coming at all . And all of a sudden the situation is very grave .\u201cHe is also able to forge upper level spirit tool . At that age?\u201d Master Kong is even more frustrated, he didn\u2019t expect to provoke someone so talented .It\u2019s still a long way to go for Master Kong to reach 4th grade Blacksmith, heck he might never reach it . \u00a0And even if he became a fourth level blacksmith, the success rate of creating an upper level spirit tool is still quite low . The most he can do now is forge a middle level spirit tool, and even then he only has 30% success rate!He is nothing compared to Yi Tianyun!However, Pavilion Lord Liang did not get angry with Master Kong, and waited for further report .Not long after the spy hurried back with an astonished face : \u201cHe forges three, no, four upper level spirit tools, and they don\u2019t plan to stop just yet, I heard that they will forge more than ten upper level spirit tools\u2026\u201dThey are Wind Pavilion, and from time to time there are several upper level spirit tools, which are already showing off the capital . Those who can create upper level spirit tools are exclusively associated with famous faction!And at this rate Rain Pavilion\u2019s reputation will skyrocket leaving Wind Pavilion in the dust .As a faction which specializes in trading, their product\u2019s quality is the priority . Because their product\u2019s quality define their strength as well . Whoever the customer whether a family or a cultivator obviously will buy from a better faction . No wonder Zi Yuwei is very excited .

He knew that Yi Tianyun was specifically targeting Kong Shengfeng . If the one he favored at that time is Yi Tianyun, none of this would happen and his business will be as smooth as ever .Kong Shengfeng is even more bitter now .

He has been forging non stop . Even though spiritual power can be replenished using recovery pill, he still needs a good rest to recover .\u201cYoung Master Yi, you need to rest . The customers can wait until you recover . you have been forging \u00a0\u00a0spirit tools non stop without resting . \u201d Zi Yuwei persuaded .Yi Tianyun nodded and asked: \u201chow are things with Wind Pavilion going? Have they made a move?\u201d\u201cThere is no significant movement for the time being . They don\u2019t have that many upper level spirit tools \u00a0to begin with .

After saying hello to the guests, he planned to go back to the room to rest .

However, he also discovered that he was unable to upgrade the weapons he had acquired so far, but the grade is not bad so it could be used for quite a while .Basically, it\u2019s all about grade, at least these three rewards are definitely the assassin set, which is definitely enough for him to use for a while .The shadow cloak is the most amazing among these, invulnerability for five seconds, which means this item could save the user at clutch situations . No matter how strong the opponent is, you can be invulnerable for five seconds!

He\u2019s either hired by Wind Pavilion, or Master Kong!\u201dHe thought about it, and finally searches whatever left of that assasin, all he saw is icy dust . Well he was shattered into pieces after turning into solid ice . Back when he fought the snow wolf he was really struggling to use the fist, now he already mastered it like it\u2019s nothing . In Crazy Mode, his punch broke the assassin .However, he was able to procure a storage ring belonged to the assassin . After rummaging through the things inside, he found that there are not many things in the assassin possession . They are all some kind of medicinal herbs, but he found two spirit tools .There is no specified mark on the spirit weapons, but considering the quality, it should be created by Kong Shengfeng .\u201cI\u2019ll go to Wind Pavilion first to find who is behind this!\u201dYi Tianyun activated his stealth skill, and instantly merged with his surroundings . Immediately, he jumped from the window and thanks to stealth skill whatever he does is completely inaudible .

It\u2019s not that Kong Shengfeng is too weak or anything, but his luck this time is not that great, so there are no more good things .Immediately, he looked down to Kong Shengfeng\u2019s lifeless body, he took out a bottle of liquid and drip it on Kong Shengfeng\u2019s body, and then Kong Shengfeng\u2019s body completely turned into a pool of blood, leaving no trace of the body once there .This is what he got from the assassin\u2019s storage ring . It is definitely an artifact used to get rid of the evidence and a must-have item for an assasin . Using assasin\u2019s item to his client, such an irony .\u201cLeaving this body in such a place, will only give unnecessary work for innocent people!\u201d Yi Tianyun eyes cold, thankfully the assasin go after him, if the assassin target An Ling instead, the results may be different .He realize that he could be dead anytime in this kind of environment, or worse he could make the people he love suffer from his own mistake .

Although she kind of had a feeling this is going to happen, she didn\u2019t expect it to be this soon .\u201cI don\u2019t know who send him . \u201d Yi Tianyun said faintly .He deliberately concealed about the rest, so there won\u2019t be too much trouble .\u201cPavilion Lord Zi, your security here is too lax, how could you allow an assassin sneak up on your guest\u2019s room! If something happened to my junior brother, how are you gonna take responsibility for this incident!\u201d An Ling burst out from her shock . Seeing the horror in front of her, she can\u2019t help but imagining the worst case scenario .If Yi Tianyun is dead here, how can she explain it to Shi Xueyun? Shi Xueyun let them out to be Yi Tianyun\u2019s guard . Sending both of them to guard Yi Tianyun simply shows how much love Shi Xueyun have for him . Their cultivation is stronger than Yi Tianyun, so it\u2019s only natural for them to be Yi Tianyun guards out here .There are only a few guards here and they both know it, she just didn\u2019t expect this to happen, fortunately their junior brother wasn\u2019t injured, the thought of his brother being assassinated brought them out into a cold sweat .Zi Yuwei\u2019s face is gloomy, she realized this is a life or death situation .\u201cI am very sorry about this . All I can say is that the guards here are not strong enough . I will immediately dispatch more people to strengthen the security!\u201d Zi Yuwei sincerely apologized: \u201cAs compensation, I am willing to give up 10%, of my share, You get 60%, we will settle with 40%!\u201dThis is the easiest and most polite way to apologize . If she gave them a pill or a weapon surely that compensation is rather meek because as long as you have enough money, you can buy it here, so it is more reasonable if she just compensated by giving up her share .\u201cNo, even if you sent a few more guards, it won\u2019t make a difference, still won\u2019t stop him\u201d .That is the truth . This assassin\u2019s cultivation is not that high, but he is really skilled in stealth move . considering the strength of Rain Pavilion right now, there is no stopping it, unless they have at least Ninth Level Spirit Refinement, or a person who have a very good revealing skill .This is obviously impossible . Because usually Ninth Level Spirit Refinement belong to the deacon level . It is simply impossible to place them as a guard here .Zi Yuwei felt really guilty . If she doesn\u2019t give a compensation to Yi Tianyun, it would leave a bad impression and the opportunity provided by Tianyun in the future will be gone .Yi Tianyun glanced at her and smiled lightly: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to blame yourself . This is not your fault . If he really was sent by Wind Pavilion, it\u2019s all because of me . This has nothing to do with you . \u201dWell, he did forge that many spirit tools and sell them at a very low price, so he realized that he brought this on himself .\u201cyou are right, but as our guest, failing to protect you is our fault! the profit already being calculated according to agreement, by changing it to 60 \u2013 40 is the biggest compensation that I could give to you right now!\u201dAlthough they only raise it by 10%, that was already quite a sum, because all material is provided by Rain Pavilion, so if they reduce their share, considering the material cost, they won\u2019t have that much profit for themselves .This shows just how sincere she was .Yi Tianyun didn\u2019t understand why she is doing this, it\u2019s to leave a good impression to Tianyun and hopefully will make him stay here longer . Profit is the only way to do so, but more importantly, it can help her grow the Rain Pavilion to rival other, so the profit should have been a vital point to her .\u201cPavilion Lord Zi, I appreciate your kindness, but it is not necessary .

Although he managed to kill the deacon, reinforcement will eventually come and they are bound to be stronger . If Core Condensation cultivator come, things may get difficult for him .Reward from killing them sure is tempting, but in his current condition, he won\u2019t win against Core Condensation cultivator .\u201cI need to retreat first!\u201dYi Tianyun quickly withdrew, and after rushing out of the city, he quickly summon the snow wolf king . After the huge snow wolf was summoned, he quickly rides it up and flee to the forest in the distance .Looking at the snow wolf under him, unfortunately this snow wolf is only Eighth Level Body Refinements, otherwise it can become a powerful helper . In fact, this snow wolf can still be leveled up, but to level it up what\u2019s necessary is not experience, nor is it to feed the medicinal herbs, but to feed it Crazy Point!As long as he fed a certain amount of Crazy Point, it can be leveled up and become a powerful helper . Crazy point used to be hard to obtain, but that\u2019s now the case no . He can get a lot of Crazy Point by killing a strong cultivator, or a monster .Soon he found a cave to hide in . After hiding the cave entrance a little, Yi Tianyun sat down and exhaled: \u201cFinally i can take a breather\u2026 let take a look at the overall situation . \u201dPlayer: Yi TianyunLevel: 18 (Eighth Level Spirit Refinement)Experience Point: 17580 / 130000Crazy Point: 3698Prestige Point: 15Cultivation Technique: Dark North DivineMartial Arts: Absorbing Stars Great Technique, Eagle Claw, Falling Feather Sword, Floating Cloud Steps, Sky Cloud Step, Ten Thousand Swords SlashDivine Ability: Crazy Mode and Luck AuraWeapon: Frost Fist and Scarlet DaggerArmor: Snow Wolf Battle Boots, Divine Armor and Shadow CapeAccessories: Forging God Hammer, Power Bracelet, Power Ring, and Power BeltProfession: Basic Level Runemaster, Middle Level Blacksmith, Basic Level Alchemist and Basic Level Formation MasterAll item: 5 Times Experience Card, 4 Recovery Medicinal Pill, Gift Pack Lv15, Lottery Ticket, Torrential Pear Blossom Needle .\u201cI was too cautious after I was chased . I have forgotten to open the gift pack . \u201dEvery time he open a gift pack, he will be more excited . In these upgrade packages, there is nothing that is not useful . It definitely will not be a something low level, so how can he not be excited?He immediately opened the Gift Pack Lv15, and soon enough the random gift inside showing itself .\u300eDing, congratulations on getting Appraisal Eye, Special Lottery Mode, Ten Times EXP Card, Gift Pack Lv20!\u300fSure enough, there are still a lot of things he got, but it is unlikely that there will be something worth mentioning . This is similar to Novice Gift Pack, it is impossible to get some game changing reward . If he wants to get such item, he hast to grind his way through the quest or killing monsters .Gift Pack provides tools to help him according to his current level . For example, this time there is an additional Appraisal Eye, and there is one more chance to use lottery mode .\u201cAppraisal Eye, hmm lest\u2019s see\u2026\u201dYi Tianyun investigated the item, but the information about the item is not thorough like he wanted it to be .Appraisal Eye: Ability to detect detailed data of anyone and assess the current combat power .\u201cWell, it\u2019s a relatively a basic tool for observing other people\u2019s data, to knows how good you can fare against an opponent, which is a very good skill to have . \u201d\u201cOpen!\u201dAfter the Appraisal Eye is activated, it will not use any energy, nor will it consume Crazy Point, which is a good thing . When he looked up at the snow wolf, he immediately see a detailed data .Snow Wolf: at 8th Level Body Refinement . The fur is equal to common level armor . The claw is the strength of the common level weapon . HP is 1 . 000, the potential is second-class, and combat power is 1 . 300 .The data is fairly detailed, without Appraisal Eye the data shown is only basic data like HP .\u201cSnow wolf combat power is 1 . 300, then how much combat power do I have?\u201dYi Tianyun investigated his own property panel, and sure enough, a combat power \u2013 18 . 570!This is the gap, and the snow wolf is not that weak, but it is estimated that Yi Tianyun\u2019s combat power is related to his equipment . When he try to see his combat power with his equipment removed, his combat power only at over 9,000 points . After all, according to the attributes of his equipment, the power accesory set can enhance his strength 100% .Being able to fight in this level is completely dependent on these equipment, or a usage of the power pill . He can imagine that taking power pill at that time and having his strength multiplied 6 times, the amount of combat power he had back then must be amazing .\u201cThis use is quite useful, at least you can have the information on how much the opponent\u2019s combat power is . \u201dYi Tianyun valued this data highly . For example, if he sees that the opponent\u2019s combat power is more than 100 . 000, what can he do against such opponent, he needs to get away from that fight!\u201cNow i need to try this special lottery thing, come on give me a lucky draw . \u201dHe opened the lottery roulette, and sure enough a special module pops up, but it seems to be a lot smaller, compared to the usual roulette .

What is the use of this for him now? Not very useful! He is now at high level, and he needs more than 100 . 000 exp . 5 . 000 exp is nothing . He would rather have one more Recovery Pill, which is better than getting 5 . 000 exp .\u201cThis system rate is too bad, only giving me a 5 . 000 Exp Pill . \u201d Yi Tianyun sighed, and immediately, he realized, \u201cI almost forgot, I have Luck Aura!\u201dCan it increase system rate? It can increase luck by five times . There\u2019s no reason to make this an exception\u201cI don\u2019t know, will this be effective?\u201d Yi Tianyun thought about it, and immediately activated the lucky aura, which consumed a little bit crazy point per second . He clenched his fist and grinded his teeth and said: \u201cLottery!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u300eDing, consume 1 . 000 Crazy Point, start the lottery!\u300fNot a lot of Crazy Point left after the consumption, the roulette once again spins rapidly .

The reward is really normal, and the difficulty is also moderate, so he can\u2019t really abandon them . Yi Tianyun at the time is not anxious about accepting this quest, in addition the Prestige that he can obtain, he definitely got to accept this .Killing monsters doesn\u2019t give Prestige, only completing a quest does .Immediately, he quickly unsummon the snow wolf to avoid being seen . Because Beast Master is also a profession, but it is extremely rare .In order not to reduce suspicion or hostility, he doesn\u2019t want to show it .Sure enough, there were several footsteps heard . Several people rushed from the outside of the forest . When they saw Yi Tianyun, they became wary, and quickly draw their sword, ready to defend themselves .\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dA brave man approached Yi Tianyun vigilantly, his cultivation is not high . It was only Second Level Spirit Refinement, but in this group of guards, it was a relatively high standard . There are a total of four guards, and a beautiful girl, Yan Lingxue .The four guards\u2019 cultivation is lower than Spirit Refinement, about Seventh or Eighth Level Body Refinement, which is still an acceptable level of escort . Yi Tianyun observe all of them orderly using Appraisal Eye, confirming their combat power .What surprised him was the old man who sticks close to Yan Lingxue was not the highest, but he was at a First Level Spirit Refinement . He seems to be the closest one to Yan Lingxue and seemed to be a butler of some sort .It seems that she hired those guards to collect some spirit herbs to ensure her safety .\u201cNo need to be alarmed, I\u2019m just here to hunt . \u201d Yi Tianyun smiled .The crooked old man, immediately straightened up when he saw Yi Tianyun, and obviously prepared for a skirmish .

It seems that they are quite close to a bear\u2019s den . In here if he isn\u2019t careful of his surrounding it won\u2019t be surprising if he\u2019s surrounded by the beasts around here all of a sudden .In a blink of an eye, the bear already surrounded them, completely blocked their escape route .\u201cAll guards, draw your sword!\u201d The guard\u2019s leader screamed and pulled out his own sword, which is a low level spirit tool . Not everyone can make upper level Spirit Tool like Yi Tianyun obviously .\u201cYoung Master, I am sorry, I involve you in this trouble . \u201d Yan Lingxue apologized, but the others did not say a word, completely disregarding him .Yi Tianyun observe her thoroughly, and it seems that Yan Lingxue is quite well-mannered, at least not like these guards who does not even bother to spoke a word with him .\u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is bound to happen anyway, I will help you break through!\u201d Yi Tianyun laughed, and advanced to take a stand, but did not stick too close for comfort .\u201cKid, go away!\u201d the leader yelled at him, he was afraid that Yi Tianyun would rob them .\u201cBig Brother Tan, don\u2019t be too anxious, I think this Young Master really wants to help us . \u201d Yan Lingxue said: \u201cMoreover at this time, it\u2019s better to have more manpower right?\u201dTan Yongsheng tried to regain composure . Nodding, at that moment one bear is charging at them . Tan Yongsheng rushes over and slashing down the bear with his sword . He slashed the giant bear into two pieces and easily kills it .Tan Yongsheng was originally better than these giant bears, so this outcome is not surprising .The other guards are also currently fighting to defeat the giant bears next to them . Only the old man did not move from his spot, he stayed at Yan Lingxue side . As long as it is not threatening Yan Lingxue, he will not do anything . Otherwise, why would they hire these guards for?\u201cRoar!\u201d At the moment, a giant bear suddenly rushed up from the forest and charging at Yan Lingxue . The bloody smell from its mouth was extremely pungent .When the old man was ready to kill the giant bear, Yi Tianyun rushed over and punches the bear with his bare fist . The giant bear was thrown out and disappeared into the forest .Everyone looked at Yi Tianyun with shock, and they were all shocked by his power . They didn\u2019t expect him to easily hit a giant bear with bare hands . This is really a natural brute force!\u300eSuccessfully kill the giant bear, get 700 exp, Bear Skin, 70 Crazy Point!\u300fThe notification came out that he successfully killed the giant bear, but didn\u2019t give him anything valuable .Yan Lingxue eyes sparked with interest, this power is not bad, and he is really strong . But he isn\u2019t giving out any strong aura, and his appearance is not like a strong man at all . It\u2019s as if the bear is just flying on its own .Tan Yongsheng blinked and said nothing . He continued to clear a path forward and quickly broke out . In the process, all the giant bears that came in their way are all killed .Yi Tianyun also blew out the giant bears on the other side, and his movements seemed to be random . They\u2019re all killing the giant bears, he doesn\u2019t want to draw unnecessary attention, to avoid trouble . The punch itself doesn\u2019t seem like instantly killing the bear instantly, it\u2019s as if he punched just to send them flying, although obviously afterwards the bear\u2019s guts are shattered .Since Yi Tianyun is helping them, they haven\u2019t said anything, but they don\u2019t give him any reward either .Soon with the leadership of Tan Yongsheng, they successfully broke through and escaped the siege of giant bears . When everyone saw that no more giant bears chase them, they finally breathed a sigh of relief . It is not an easy task to clear those giant bears up .\u201cAt last they are not after us, let\u2019s take a break . \u201d Tan Yongsheng gasped and motioned them to rest .Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYi Tianyun is fine, he isn\u2019t fatigued at all, but when he stops, there is a voice coming from his ear .\u300eRandom Quest Completed . \u300f\u300eReward: 5 . 000 exp, 100 Yan Ling Xue\u2019s favorability, 10 Prestige . \u300f\u201cWell that was easy, an easy 10 Prestige . \u201d Yi Tianyun is smiling at his triumphs, this small quest is still very cost-effective .When the times come, he hopes to get another of this random quest .

Dragon Aura is emanating from them .This sculpture is really lifelike . It\u2019s as if it will start raising their weapons and attacking him in any moment .Dragon Clan belongs to Divine Beast Race, a formidable race . There is no dragon exist around here, but looking at this palace, presumably this palace was a home for some dragons many years ago, but because of human cultivators expanded their territory and increasing in population, the dragons were forced to leave this palace .Human as the year progressed have an impeccable advantage in number, completely outnumbering the other races . Therefore, they are all married to each other . Dragonoids in front of Yi Tianyun are one of the mix breed, half-man and half-dragon .\u201cWhat kind of test is waiting for me?\u201d Yi Tianyun frowned and start to look around the room, he didn\u2019t see anything out of ordinary in the room . When he continued to move forward, suddenly one of the stone statues began to shake and move, it blocked Yi Tianyun path with a long spear in its hand .\u201cIf you want to pass through, you must defeat me first\u2026\u201d He instantly charged toward Yi Tianyun even though he hasn\u2019t finished his sentence, it charged toward Yi Tianyun and strike him with its palm, Yi Tianyun try to counter with his Absorbing Star Great Technique .The stone statue spiritual power was immediately absorbed . However, this stone statue didn\u2019t falter .

As another statue was beginning to move .\u201cRumble\u2026\u201dThese statues were maintaining its life by an array, a kind of sealing techniques, as long as the array was destroyed they will collapse .Yi Tianyun looks at the statue with the Appraisal Eye: Stone Statue, Fifth Level Spirit Refinement, HP 5000, equipped with a common high level weapon, a common high level armor, combat power 4700 .This value compared to Yi Tianyun\u2019s current combat power of 20 . 000, is literally meaningless so he doesn\u2019t need to plan anything, he just rushed over to the statue to attack .After easily avoiding the attack of the stone statue, he uses his Absorbing Star Great Technique to absorb its spiritual energy . The excessive usage of the absorbing star great technique gives him mastery for the technique on top of the exp that he gets . With the amount of mastery he has now it will definitely take a while before he can level it up again .However, when this technique leveled up, it will be worth the effort, simply because the effect is just amazing . He feels a little excited when he thinks about it . Its only on earth level now, he wondered if it reach heaven level how much exp can he absorb . He estimated that it will be ten times or more absorption rate of the current level . It will absorb ten thousands of exp in the blink of the eyes .\u201cRumble\u2026\u201dAfter defeating one stone statue, another stone statue is reanimated .\u201cSo this one is stronger than the previous one, Sixth Level Spirit Refinement huh?\u201dYi Tianyun looked at the detailed data, the new stone statue is stronger than the previous one, but to him it\u2019s not changing anything at that level .At the moment, he rushed over the status and broke the statue\u2019s arms and legs . After the stone statue was unable to move, he proceeded to absorb the exp from its body .After the statue was destroyed, the last stone statue was reanimated and its cultivation is at Seventh Level Spirit Refinement . This level is not really a problem for him either .\u201cEven if I activated the Luck Aura, it gives nothing . \u201d Yi Tianyun shook his head and felt quite helpless . He expected some treasure will be dropped from this guards .Of course, it is also possible that his luck is too low to begin with .\u201cAppraisal Eye can be leveled up too . I don\u2019t know what effect it will have after leveling up\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun looked at the Appraisal Eye data . Level up requiring 50 . 000 Crazy Points, he shook his head helplessly . At this moment, he doesn\u2019t have that much .However, he believes that as his cultivation is improved, Crazy Points he gained later will be higher as well, and it will be cost-effective to level up the Appraisal Eye .\u201cRumble\u2026 . \u201dWhen he defeated the last statue, the distant gates slowly opened . It seems that he really cannot pass before defeating all the stone statues . From his point of view, it is indeed a test . If he didn\u2019t beat it, he can\u2019t pass .Yi Tianyun proceeded to go inside . He was careful along the way and he did not stay in the same spot for too long .When he walked into this passage way, he didn\u2019t see nor detect any traps .\u201cIt seems that I am just a paranoid, there are no traps laid in the passageway . \u201d Yi Tianyun nodded and quickly passed through the passageway . After leaving the passage, his eyes suddenly became clear .Right in front of him is a throne, a golden skeleton dragon with an immense dragon aura sat on it and the dragon seems to looked down on him .Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat a powerful pressure\u2026\u201dYi Tianyun became saddened by this facts, this is the legendary Dragon God?

He try to observe the dragon\u2019s bones using the Appraisal Eye, but he couldn\u2019t see any information at all, the data was unknown .\u201cMy people, finally came\u2026\u201d suddenly a golden flame emerged from the dragon\u2019s eyes, and the pressure he felt from the aura before was increased .\u201cMy people? When did I become his people?\u201d Yi Tianyun was stunned, he suddenly became his people, he quite sure that himself is indeed from the human race .Did Dragon God mistakenly think that he is a dragon?

The actual Dragon God is already dead, this is just his will to pass on his heritage .Therefore, even if Yi Tianyun is a human, Dragon God isn\u2019t aware of it and pass his heritage to him .\u201cTake out the Dragon God Grass, swallow it and accept my heritage!\u201d After Dragon God finished his sentence, the bones of his whole body turned into dust and liquid of gold, wrapped the entire throne .\u201cThis thing is called Dragon God Grass?\u201dYi Tianyun took out the Dragon God Grass, which looks like a Dragon Tail Grass, there is only a slight difference with ordinary Dragon Tail Grass . Perhaps this difference is what makes it called Dragon God Grass .Immediately, he swallowed Dragon God Grass . It doesn\u2019t taste so bad, and there was a sweet smell faintly entering his body . Immediately, enormous power welling inside him and and filled his entire body in an instant! His veins began to bulge one by one .\u201cThis Dragon God Grass\u2019 power is too strong\u2026\u201dYi Tianyun realize the effect of Dragon Tail Grass and Dragon God Grass is not the same, Dragon Tail grass is used for healing purposes especially psychedelic meanwhile this Dragon God Gras\u2026 .Power surging through his body!

It was obvious that after taking this Dragon God Grass, the energy source was constantly transformed to exp!\u201cI actually become a Dragonoid\u2026\u201dYi Tianyun stunned . He remembered about his parents . Although he didn\u2019t know much, he heard that his father was a super strong expert . It is very likely that he inherited the dormant power from his father . And Dragon God Grass completely awakens it .Perhaps that\u2019s the reason Dragon God thought that he is a dragon descendant!\u201cNow the most important thing is to quickly accept the heritage!\u201dYi Tianyun did not think too much . These parents\u2019 things have nothing to do with him . After all, he has no memories of them anyway, the closest person to him is his aunt Shi Xueyun! All he wants now is to level up, then return to Jade Palace to avoid any problem arise in Jade Palace!After approaching the throne, the golden light suddenly completely shrouded him .

In addition, there is no major difficulty too . Fortunately, there is no strong palace guardian with cultivation Core Condensation or above .\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201dImmediately, Yi Tianyun opened his status and looked at how far he got .Host: Yi TianyunLevel: 19 (Ninth Level Spirit Refinement)Exp: 86892 / 130000Crazy Points: 8728Prestige: 50Cultivation Techniques: Dark North Divine Art and Dragon God Secret ArtMartial Arts: Absorbing Stars Great Technique, Sky Cloud Step, Ten Thousand Swords Return to OriginWeapon: Frost Fist, Scarlet Dagger and Wind Chasing SwordArmor: Snow Wolf Battle Boots, Divine Armor and Shadow CloakDivine Ability: Crazy Mode and Luck AuraBloodline: Dragon GodAccessories: Forging God Hammer, Power Bracelet and Power Ring and Power BeltAll items: Five Times Experience Card, 5 Recovery Medicinal Pill, Gift Pack Lv21 and Torrential Pear Blossom NeedleYi Tianyun nodded and quite satisfied with what he got . Just a little bit more hunting and he will level up to the peak of Spirit Refinement Realm . He has accumulated Crazy Point sufficient for six lotteries, but he wanted to reserve it for now .Even if he do lottery, there is no guarantee that he will get something good . At present, his equipment is OK . Of course he won\u2019t complain if he managed to get something good, but most of the item in the pool are not so good .

It is estimated that this Dragon God was seriously injured, or the end of his lifespan is approaching and there is no choice for him other than stay here, and find someone to accept his heritage .He didn\u2019t know the specific situation, that\u2019s just his speculation .

I have no reason to stay here . \u201dYi Tianyun headed to the door but suddenly there was a loud sound coming from outside, it seems that someone is try to open the door forcefully and even attack it, but no matter what they do, they can\u2019t open it . This is Dragon God Palace, it won\u2019t easy to break the door .As for the strength needed to forcefully open the door, he doesn\u2019t have a clue, at least it must be above the Core Condensation level .\u201cWell obviously people will swarm this place after seeing the shining light . \u201d Yi Tianyun frowned, this is not good, there will be many people outside, if he goes out now, he will be surrounded .But there is just no option left for Tianyun, he can\u2019t hide in here forever, he has to get out any other way .\u201cIt seems that there is no option left, now or never\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun\u2019s eyes flashed in the cold!Immediately, he pushed the door hard . The entire door immediately shook and the light in the palace dimmed with the rumbling sound of the door, slowly opened .\u201cThe door! it opened!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really weird, it suddenly opened, I wonder know what kind of monster will come out!\u201d\u201cWill the palace owner come out as well? We should escape immediately!\u201dThe people that are trying to enter the palace earlier is began to murmur between them self . After the door is fully opened, the shocked expression is clearly visible from their eyes, its not a monster that is in front of their eyes, nor a super expert, but just a teenager!They were stunned . How could a teenager come out from such a place? Judging from appearance it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s a strong cultivator eitherThey looked at Yi Tianyun, Yi Tianyun also looked at them, he observed everyone, and conclude that the lowest cultivator is at Fifth Level Spirit Refinement, the highest is also still in Spirit Refinement . It seems that they\u2019re here on adventure to hone their skills by defeating the beast around the mountain, or just a passerby that by chance saw the light from the palace .No one at Core Condensation is here at the moment, although Illusory Beast Mountain is a good place for cultivation, but that\u2019s not the case for Core Condensation cultivator . The strongest cultivator here at the moment is only at Ninth Level Spirit Refinement .He kind of knew this is gonna happen . He can\u2019t act surprised now, after seeing such shining light obviously anyone who see it will gather here .Yi Tianyun ignored their gaze and walked outside . When he barely set his foot outside the palace, the door was slammed shut, slowly and steadily as if the door was never opened before, he immediately realize that he is the only one that can open it because of Dragon God Grass .Everyone looked at him slyly . When he walked through the crowd, the cultivator at Ninth Level Spirit Refinement tried to stop him, \u201cHey kid, Stop!\u201dYi Tianyun paid him no heed . He continues to walk forward, but the crowd in front of him began to surround him, blocking his path . He can\u2019t walk away like he intended to do, unless he can fly then it would be a different story .Stealth is useless . After all, there are too many people here, and getting too close to someone, can expose his position .\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Yi Tianyun said indifferently .\u201cHow do you get out?\u201d One of the cultivators is asking quite fiercely .\u201cby opening the door obviously, how else would I get out?\u201dYi Tianyun said: \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, the door that you want to open so badly still standing strong there, continue your effort because I didn\u2019t get anything in there, so please step aside, I\u2019m in a hurry!\u201dWhen he finished his words, even more people surround him, making it harder for him to breakthrough them .\u201cYou must be joking, do you think we will believe you?\u201d One of the big men sneered: \u201cHurry up and hand over the treasure, otherwise don\u2019t blame us for what will happen to you!\u201d\u201cYeah, give it up now, or open the door . Otherwise we will do anything we can to force you!\u201d\u201cDo you think that you can escape from this many people, and keep the treasures for yourself? Do you think we are stupid?\u201dThey all looked at Yi Tianyun fiercely . They knew that Yi Tianyun is still young, they thought that because of that he is weak mentally and can force him to hand over everything he has?\u201cIf you want to open the door, go ahead, knock yourselves out . Why do you need my help? \u00a0And even if I really get the treasures, why should I give it to you?\u201d Yi Tianyun looked cold .\u201cWe have been waiting here for so long, you must give us some compensations!\u201d\u201cYes, hand over the treasure, or you will die today!\u201dTheir faces are fierce, who would believe someone that coming out from such a big palace didn\u2019t get any treasures whatsoever .\u201cI will say this for the last time, please let me leave, otherwise don\u2019t blame me for what ever happened to you!\u201d Yi Tianyun\u2019s eyes completely showing no emotions, why would he give anything to these people? It\u2019s not like he asked them to wait up for him here . What a complete utter bullshit!However, his words gave a little to no threat, the looks in their eyes is even more fierce and keep approaching him .\u201cBeing polite is fine too, but we want to see how hard you can hit!\u201d After the practitioner finished, he immediately charged at Yi Tianyun, grabbing him .Yi Tianyun remained calm, he quickly draws his sword the Wind Chasing Blade and slashed it forward, like a lightning bolt . The next moment the cultivator\u2019s arm that touch Yi Tianyun is completely cut off .\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe cultivator screamed at severe pain caused by the loss of his arm, the electric shock effect of Wind Chasing Blade cause him to convulsing .

Hurry and hand it over, don\u2019t think you can escape from here!\u201dThey quickly surrounded him, Yi Tianyun is clearly shocked by how greedy someone can get . Yi Tianyun just cut off an arm and that didn\u2019t scare them away . They think that because the first cultivator is weak that Yi Tianyun is also weak?Yi Tianyun looked really furious .

Soon the roulette wheel turned wildly, and the pointer continued to jump between the various areas, after some times passed the pointer slowed down indicating it soon will stop .\u201cDivine Ability, Divine Ability\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun kept chanting, wishing that the pointer will follow his wishes .Finally the wheel stopped, and the pointer was landed on the consumables\u2026 Even if he using the Luck Aura, he still couldn\u2019t get a good things . Which is why he was not willing to spend his crazy points on lottery . Often neglecting it for the next time he gets the free ticket again, sure its possible getting a high price item but in the end, his chance for getting more common item is much larger .\u300eDing\u2026 Congratulations on getting a Third Level Spirit Core . \u300fThird Level Spirit Core is much better than a Recovery Pill obtained by killing demon beasts . It is a rare item . Still this item is not worth the thousand points he would spent without the free lottery ticket .\u201cThird Level Spirit Core, I will stop doing this lottery now, even though I still can do this for many more times, but its not worth the price . \u201d30 . 000 Crazy Point is enough for him to draw 30 times more . It is still not certain that he would get a divine ability or a heavenly weapon from it, so he thinks better of it to uses it for leveling up his arsenal than lottery!\u201cI almost forgot, there is a Gift Pack Lv21 that is not opened yet . \u201d When Yi Tianyun saw the package on his inventory, he felt really excited . This is due to the fact that a gift packs, up until this point never disappoints him . And now, he doesn\u2019t know what will come out now .\u201cOpen Gift Pack Lv21!\u201dAfter Yi Tianyun issued the order, Gift Pack Lv21 was opened, voicing the content inside .\u300eOpen Gift Pack Lv21, Ten Times Exp Card (one hour), Double Crazy Point Card (one hour), Double Mastery Card (one hour), open Shop Mode, Gift Pack Lv31\u300fHe baffled by the content inside . Finally, there was a Double Crazy Point Card, and there was a Double Mastery Card . On top of that he got a ten times exp card . After opening Gift Pack Lv21, he feels his excitement increased even more .However, if you think about it carefully, the double crazy point and the double mastery card are for the best now . If the system gave it in the early stage, it will be a waste . 100 Crazy Point he got on early levels are doubled only to 200, now if he kill advanced level demon beast, he can successfully get more than 800, after doubling it, 1600 will be the bare minimum of crazy point he received . this will be the item that surely make his climb on cultivations easier .\u201cIf there was such a thing before I kill all of this trash, it would be so much better . \u201d Yi Tianyun shook his head and felt quite saddened for this fact . He already kill a bunch load of cultivators earlier, under this Double Crazy Point Card, the amount he got would be not more than 30 . 000, but more than 60 . 000!\u201cWhat is this Shop Mode?\u201dAfter Yi Tianyun opened the Shop Mode, many classifications listed in order . There is a Weapons Category, Defensive Equipment Category, Martial Arts Category, Cultivation Techniques Category, Consumables and Treasures Category .The classification is very complete, but after he opens it, his excitement fell, all of these items are not new to him, and the prices are quite high too! To put it bluntly, he can get all of them by lottery, killing demon beast or killing cultivator, this item is that common for him .\u201cNo new goods, what does this mean?\u201d Yi Tianyun shook his head, he looked at it, the Frost Fist is also in it, the price is purchased with Crazy Point .The price of the Frost Fist is 5000 Crazy Point . He felt a little bit relieve, he spent a thousand crazy point for this frost fist with the lottery draw, he feels that he is not wasting any crazy point . Among them, Double Exp Card, Ten Times Exp Card, and Double Crazy Point Card are all in it too .This fact makes Yi Tianyun somewhat feels gratified, but at a glance, the price is too expensive . Ten Times Exp Card require 50 . 000 Crazy Point . Double Crazy Point Card also requires 50 . 000 Crazy Point, the price is obnoxiously high .\u201cIt seems that this shops are made for urgent matter, so the item would be directly used\u201d Yi Tianyun shook his head, and immediately he realize he still got time from his exp buff cards: \u201cThere is still a little time left, I should continue to kill all demon beasts I can see, earn exp and continue to level up!\u201dWith his earlier usage of exp card surely killing a demon beast will worth his time . But he need to find and hunt them fast!\u201cPartner, let\u2019s go!\u201dHe rode the snow wolf immediately . At this time, the cultivation of the snow wolf has already risen to First Level Core Condensation! Under crazy exp he got from killing all those cultivators earlier, the snow wolf seems to get the effect too . The level rose quite high, and also the wolf itself terrifying the passerby they passed through .Immediately he invests his time to killing all demon beast he could find, no matter how strong the beast is, he fights it . He didn\u2019t have the luxury to choose the demon beasts he wants to fight because clearly that would be wasting time .\u300eDing, your Five Times Exp Card time has ended\u2026\u300f\u300eDing, your Ten Times Exp Card time has ended\u2026\u300fThe time limit is very short, after searching everywhere he could, he only found three demon beasts and that amount is really too few . The higher the demon beast cultivation levels, the more likely that they would be alone, so it is impossible to kill a lot on a short amount of time .\u201cUnfortunately, the amount of demon beasts in this area is too few for my liking . \u201dThe current exp needed to level up is 500 . 000 . This amount is sure not so easy to obtain . If there is more demon beast in this vicinity surely that will help him get the extra exp that he needs .\u201cTime\u2019s up, I need to get back to Jade Palace to assess the situation, there is not much time left to enter the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins . \u201dYi Tianyun already though about staying here on the mountains, but there is no more profits that he could make staying out on this mountains . Riding his snow wolf to get to Wind City, and go back to Jade Palace, naturally it is a necessity to go through Wind City . The city itself is in his path towards the Jade Palace, and he wants to see the situation in the city too .Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh\u2026\u201dThe speed of the snow wolf has been greatly improved . It run out of the forest in matter of minutes and rushes to get into the city .In a moment, he arrived near the city gate, and he unsummons his snow wolf, for he doesn\u2019t want to attract many attentions in this city .In the city, near the wanted board, there is a teenager standing on the edge of the wanted posters and looking at the posters above .

How about teaming up with me and split the reward by half?\u201d At this time a man pat his shoulder, but Yi Tianyun evade it, well the man didn\u2019t think much of it . He continued to look at the wanted poster, and the reward make everybody exited .Yi Tianyun looked at him, his cultivation just First Level Spirit Refinement . Moreover, that\u2019s only recently . And he dare to capture him?\u201cNot interested . \u201d Yi Tianyun ignored him, turned away and left him .The man glanced at him and shrugged his shoulders . He immediately asked another person next to him: \u201cMan, do you want to catch this kid? How about teaming up with me and split the reward by half, this is 10 . 000 gold we\u2019re talking about, you can live the rest of your life without worry!\u201d\u201cGo by yourself, I heard that Yi Tianyun is not weak, I don\u2019t want to die yet . \u201d\u201cYes, I heard that he has slaughtered the entire Wind Pavilion . At that time, the blood flowed into the river and he robbed all of their treasure!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating, If you catch him, you\u2019ll get the reward along with the treasure he stole right?\u201d\u201cLike hell it will be that easy! Without Core Condensation cultivator how can you capture him? I don\u2019t want to die\u2026 \u201cThere are a lot of people around, hearing their chattering he remained silent, not only killing people from Wind Pavilion but also Deacon from Wing Sect . This is really exaggerating and the news spread really fast!These words become more and more exaggerated, which makes him feel helpless .However, he completely ignored it . This is nothing unusual . Anyway, he needs to gather information anyway despite these exagerated news .Then he passed through Wind Pavilion and Rain Pavilion . Things here are as usual as well no notable changes . Although Wind Pavilion lost several deacons and Pavilion Lord, they have replacement, so they are slowly recover their business .Although Rain Pavilion is not as good as Wind Pavilion, ever since their cooperation with Yi Tianyun they make a name for themselves . Therefore, Wind Pavilion don\u2019t mind Rain Pavilion this time . They directed their anger to Yi Tianyun .Coincidentally Zi Yuwei came out, she looked sad and worried . She didn\u2019t recognize Yi Tianyun because he used Hundred Transformation Mask, but she looked toward Wind Pavilion with eyes full of anger before finally get back inside .\u201cSeems like nothing else will happen . it is time to go back . \u201dWhen Yi Tianyun was about to leave, a familiar face approach him with an old man . They looked at each other, he didn\u2019t expect to meet an acquaintance here .\u201cYoung Master Yi?\u201d The nature that came over was Yan Lingxue .\u201cYoung Master Yi?\u201d The old man suddenly looked up .

How about the Dragon Tail Grass the other day?\u201d Yi Tianyun is quite polite toward her . At least she is really honest, and her attitude towards him is really polite .\u201cThe effect is good enough, but it still can\u2019t completely cure the illness\u2026 The pharmacist said Dragon Tail Grass alone is not enough . \u201d Yan Lingxue smiled but obviously she is helpless .\u201cBut even knowing that is quite a progress so it\u2019s okay for the time being .

The patient\u2019s mind is quite unstable now, right?\u201dHe is a Third Level Alchemist, he still has no problem with this medicine .\u201cActually, the one who receive the treatment is my father . Recently, he has been cultivating excessively, which led to cultivation deviation . Now he is still in coma .

There is no way he already become a pharmacist at this young age, Kong Liang thought to himself .The most shocking thing that happened is that Yan Lingxue listened to Yi Tianyun\u2019s words, and willingly take him back with her . Kong Liang can\u2019t stand the fact that Yan Lingxue would listen to Yi Tianyun\u2019s words, whom doesn\u2019t seem like an alchemist at all .\u201cIf you really are an alchemist, in what level are you?\u201d Kong Liang was mad, a teenager who just came out of nowhere claiming to be a pharmacist, this kid must be lying!\u201cThird Level Alchemist, is there a problem?\u201d Yi Tianyun said indifferently .\u201cYou? A Third Level Alchemist? If you are Third Level Alchemist, then I am Fifth Level Alchemist!\u201d Kong Liang doesn\u2019t believe Yi Tianyun\u2019s words .Yan Lingxue is so excited to hear this truth, if Yi Tianyun really is a Third Level Alchemist, then Yi Tianyun have a totally limitless potential in the future .\u201cMiss Yan, are you sure to ask this kid to cure Yan Family\u2019s head?\u201d Kong Liang immediately angered, blowing fumes and said: \u201cIf he makes a mistake and the family head never wake up again, how will he take responsibility?\u201dYan Lingxue hesitated, if something went wrong, Yan Family will be in trouble . Yan Family is not a big family, if the Family Head is dead, no one else in the family can maintain the family to survive .\u201cAre you joking? What i\u2019m about to do wouldn\u2019t cause any negative effect . Did you forgot that I will use only the Dragon Tail Grass? I will not give him anything else other than that, even if he eats it raw, it would cause him no side effect . \u201d Yi Tianyun said wisely .\u201cYoung Master Yi, if you only use the Dragon Tail Grass, can he recover completely?\u201d she pondered after listening to Yi Tianyun\u2019s words, she thinks that it\u2019s okay for Yi Tianyun to try, in the end if it still not enough she could add the Soul Returning Grass later .\u201cThere should be no problem, as long as the condition is not worse than what we think it is . \u201d Yi Tianyun said .\u201cLet\u2019s go back to my place now, then . \u201d Yan Lingxue start to head back to her household, and immediately said to Kong Liang: \u201cMaster Kong Liang, you can rest for now, we are going to try Master Yi\u2019s way . If it doesn\u2019t work, we will try your method . \u201dAfter Yi Tianyun explained the effect of soul returning grass earlier, she becomes more cautious, that the effect had a great side effect . If Yi Tianyun is really saying the truth, then Dragon Tail Grass alone would be enough . She is not a fool to swallow anyone words without considering the effect she will have later .Kong Liang is furious by this turn of event . He said: \u201cI will say this again, i dare him to cure the family\u2019s head, I doubt that he can do it anyway . I would like to see this kid try to cure the family head, after insulting my treatment method, but if the treatment failed, I will still treat family\u2019s head but the payment would be doubled than what we agreed before .\u201cRest assured, if the treatment failed, I\u2019ll pay you double myself!\u201d Yi Tianyun looked at him coldly .Kong Liang said: \u201cOkay, good! I want to see if you really have the ability of a Third Level Alchemist!\u201dWith Yan Lingxue leading the way back to Yan Family household, they arrived immediately . Yan Family\u2019s background is good, the guards respected them when they arrive, this would have been an indication the family is loved by their own people . When he entered the room that family head located, he immediately smells a strong medicinal smell .Yan Family\u2019s Head was laid down in bed, unconscious and really pale . Yi Tianyun knew immediately that this is not something caused by injury, this is surely what cultivation deviation would cause and that surely would cause a trauma to his soul .Family\u2019s head paleness is different than the averave paleness caused by some injury or normal sickness . This is the paleness caused by a damaged soul . The soul is the most fundamental thing, once it is damaged, it could render a cultivator powerless for their whole life . A broken arm could regenerate but a broken soul would be irreparable .But as anything else in cultivation world, something irreparable such as soul, could be healed by someone that has a power to do so, someone that defy the heaven itself .Yi Tianyun observed the family head condition, and he affirmed: \u201cWell, cultivation tempering indeed would cause this effect . Forcefully breaking through the cultivation, if you are not careful and hasty this would happen . But this is not a big problem as long as we have the Dragon Tail Grass . How did you treat him before? How come he is still unconscious after you treat him with Dragon tail grass?\u201dHe glanced at Kong Liang and assessed his behavior .\u201cAre you really a third level alchemist? You don\u2019t even know how to use this and you call yourself one?\u201d Kong Liang dismissed: \u201cThe Dragon Tail Grass is indeed the medicine for this sickness but there is another way to make it more effective, it is to use the Soul Returning Grass!\u201d\u201cYou do it just like what I\u2019m doing right now?\u201d Yi Tianyun said indifferently while continued to make the medicine .\u201cIs there other way to make a medicine using Dragon Tail Grass?\u201d Kong Liang frowned .\u201cNo, but your approach is wrong . No wonder he was not cured, you don\u2019t even know how to use the Dragon Tail Grass!\u201d Yi Tianyun snorted: \u201cIf we actually do it your way by adding Soul Returning Grass, the family\u2019s head surely would be dead by now\u201d\u201cWhat a joke! If you insist on saying i don\u2019t know how to make the medicine why don\u2019t you show me how you make one\u201d Kong Liang became furious of Yi Tianyun mockery of his knowledge .Yi Tianyun has lost interest to exchange another insult with him, instead he said to Yan Lingxue: \u201cMiss Yan, forgive me for being a little bit rude . \u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Yan Lingxue wondered .She saw Yi Tianyun lifted the arm of Yan Family Head and poking the fingertip a little, and a few drop of blood fell into the empty jade bottle . This move make the two of the observer confused, what will he do with a few drop of blood?\u201cIf you want to cure Yan Family\u2019s head in this situation, you must first use the patient\u2019s blood to refine this pill, which is the most correct methods, this is the only way to completely cure the patients . Many alchemists didn\u2019t know this method, not that they are stupid, but they rarely encounter this situation, and they don\u2019t know how to adapt with the situations at hand\u201dYi Tianyun said: \u201cThe most terrible thing an alchemist would do is despite their lack of knowledge on how to solve the situation, they act like they know how to solve it, making everything else worse . \u201d\u201cWho are you talking crap about now!\u201d Kong Liang ready to blow up, his pride is cracked by Yi Tianyun\u2019s words .\u201cDid I even mention your name? I am going to do my alchemy now, please refrain yourself from ruining my focus, if something happen to the family\u2019s head because you ruin my concentration, how will you take responsibilities . \u201d Yi Tianyun\u2019s words completely stun Kong Liang .When Kong Liang wanted to say something, Yi Tianyun took out a pill shell that he already made before and throws it in to the air .The sound of wind immediately resounded in the room, and Immortal Fire immediately wrapped around the pill and the dragon tail grass .

Instead, you need to exchange it with other high quality materials, or exchange precious spirit herbs instead of gold .\u201cYes, this alchemy furnace is low level holy tool .

If he sell it, undoubtedly he\u2019ll receive abundant amount of gold . As the price itself is considered to be around 2 million gold .Of course that\u2019s just an estimation, considering the furnace of this level can\u2019t be sold by gold, it\u2019s really hard to determine its value .Yan Family\u2019s Head gave it to him might be because Yi Tianyun doesn\u2019t have an alchemy furnace he could personally use . The effect and the success rate for his refinement would increase tremendously .He can refine without the use of one, like he did a moment ago, but to refine high quality pill, it is necessary to use alchemy furnaces . Not only it can provide a better success rate, but also assisting to control the fire . Without alchemy furnace, refining high quality pills will fail unless he has a skill to back-up his confidence .\u201cThis is a holy spirit tool, it\u2019s too expensive for me . \u201d Yi Tianyun frowned . Although he felt honored to receive such a great reward, he feels that he doesn\u2019t deserve such reward . Today is his first time using alchemy, although he did a good job at that too .However, with the system he had, Yi Tianyun was very sure he would not fail .\u201cIt\u2019s not expensive at all, this is the only reward we can give to you . Our family doesn\u2019t have an alchemist . This Purple Fire Holy Furnace is wasted here, it\u2019s only natural to give it to a talented young man like you . \u201d Yan Family Head insisted .\u201cYeah, Young Master Yi, it\u2019s for you . We Yan Family is not a family of alchemist . I wanted to search for an alchemist in the future, to whom we can entrust this tool . I didn\u2019t expect to meet you . \u201d Yan Lingxue sighed, Yan Family has a small background, limited resources, and no high level cultivator, it\u2019s hard to raise a young alchemist on their own .\u201cBut this is a holy level tool, with this alone I can buy a city! To be honest, I am surprised that you can keep an item like this for so long . If somebody else knows about this, it could be disastrous . \u201d Yi Tianyun said with an honest opinion .Yan Family can\u2019t keep this holy tool by themselves, this only will lead to a disaster for them . Yan Family\u2019s strongest cultivation is Yan Family\u2019s Head, but his cultivation is only at Tenth Level Spirit Refinement, not even in a Core Condensation . In order to breakthrough toCore Condensation, he forces himself and finally fell victim to cultivation deviation .\u201cYeah, so I think Brother Yi is very suitable to receive this, I will give this to you as you surely can put it to a good use . \u201d Yan Family Head smiled .Yi Tianyun was silent for a while and said: \u201cI will accept this alchemy furnace, but, as this thing is very expensive, I can\u2019t just accept it, I will surely return the favors . \u201dHe said that and he brings out all the gold that he has, and the room they are on, is full with gold . Looking at the mountain of gold in front of them, the Yan Family member is all stunned .This is all the gold he gets along his journey, especially when he got surrounded by all the cultivator at the entrance of the Dragon God Palace and killing all the mountain beasts after that .\u201cYoung Master Yi, I didn\u2019t expect you to have this much money\u2026\u201d Yan Lingxue took a sigh of relief . She thought that she can reward Yi Tianyun with gold, turned out she was wrong all along .\u201cThis is for your family\u2019s growth . I will be staying here for a while if you don\u2019t mind . You can buy alchemy materials and forging materials with this gold,then I will refine all the materials into pills and some spirit tools to strengthen Yan Family . This is all I can do in exchange of this tool\u201dDue to Yan Family\u2019s head generosity he intend to stay here for a while and help them with refinement . Of course, it\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t gain anything in return, not only he\u2019ll gain experience and mastery but also a place to stay .\u201cYoung Master Yi, you even helped us refining?\u201d Yan Lingxue is shocked by Yi Tianyun\u2019s generosity, in fact, they were all shocked, they thought they misheard him .\u201cYes, I can refine top quality spirit pill for you . Use this gold to buy materials . \u201d Yi Tianyun smiled and said: \u201ccan you prepare a room as soon as possible? Because I can\u2019t stay for too long . \u201d\u201cNo, no problems at all!\u201d Yan Lingxue immediately react, this is a big opportunity for her family .They can\u2019t use the Purple Fire Holy Furnace, they can only give it to Yi Tianyun, they don\u2019t expect that Yi Tianyun would refine pills for them, but it\u2019s an undeniable fact that they need it . They don\u2019t need the alchemy furnace as they are in dire need of resources to grow their family .After arranging the room for Yi Tianyun, Yan Lingxue returned to the room they all gathered before and becomes excited: \u201cFather, that is a wise move you have done there . He is a genius!\u201d\u201cYou figured out that I fancy him don\u2019t you?\u201d Yan Family Lord smiled lightly: \u201cI observed him carefully, he already becomes an alchemist in such a young age, that is maybe because of his background status or his talent is extremely high . In any case, it is most important to befriend such talented individual . He doesn\u2019t ask anything in return, already proving that he is not a greedy person and that is a quality a good person has, that makes it worthwhile to befriends such person! He is worth more than the holy tools we gave him, if we becomes a good friend with him, surely he can help us again in the future if we need him\u201dIf they sell the Purple Fire Holy Furnace, they could receive a great amount of money too, but then again the money surely would diminish over time, but to make acquaintance of a genius surely would worth more!What he is looking at is Yi Tianyun\u2019s empathy and righteousness . He even thought to marry Yi Tianyun to his daughter .\u201cFather, are you worried about Wang Family and Zeng Family?\u201d Yan Lingxue asked with a bit of hatred in her voice\u201cYes, I will definitely do so until the end of my life, but sooner or later they would force us to submit to them . But now that Brother Yi is here, I hope he can help us refine pills and weapons, so that we can strengthen our Yan Family and hold our ground against them . \u201d Yan Family\u2019s Head sighed, because he didn\u2019t manage to breakthrough to Core Condensation Realm, it will be more difficult to protect his family .Yan Lingxue nod lightly to her father\u2019s words and immediately goes out to buy materials . Since Yi Tianyun already said he would do it, it wouldn\u2019t be polite to make him wait for so long .Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSoon she purchased a variety of materials and brought them back to Yi Tianyun .

If he has not level up recently, he could just die here .He never mistreats someone for no reason, but the moment someone pick a fight with him, they better prepare themselves as Yi Tianyun won\u2019t let them escape no matter what .Seeing Zeng Family\u2019s Head had been burned into ash in front of his eyes, Wang Family\u2019s head quickly begged for mercy on his knees: \u201cplease spare my life, I, I will do whatever you want, my family will will do whatever you want!\u201dWang Family Head is obviously not as strong as Zeng Family Head . He keeps begging for mercy . He does not want to die . As Weng Family Head, he can\u2019t die here just yet .\u201cSomeone like you will just stab me in the back . I don\u2019t have any interest in people like you!\u201dThen he did the same thing as Zeng Family\u2019s head, Wang Family\u2019s head screamed like crazy and rampaging on the ground trying to extinguish the fire . But just like Zeng Family\u2019s Head, with almost no spiritual power left, he also fell victim to Immortal Fire .It\u2019s not that they\u2019re weak in terms of cultivation . It\u2019s just Immortal Fire is very powerful .[Ding, killing Wang Family Head, got 40 . 000 exp, Hegemony (human level martial arts), and 1000 Crazy Point . ]He gained a lot of exp and human level martial arts, but this martial arts is nothing special, their level is too low, he is not interested at all . But since he got it for free anyway, there\u2019s no reason to throw it away\u201cI haven\u2019t leveled up yet . It seems that i need quite a lot of exp to level up now\u2026\u201dYi Tianyun opened his status bar .Host: Yi TianyunLevel: 24 (Fourth Level of Core Condensation Realm)Exp: 457281 / 600000Crazy Point: 28728Prestige: 70Cultivation Techniques: Dark North Divine Art and Dragon God Secret ArtMartial Arts: Absorbing Stars Great Technique, Sky Cloud Step, Ten Thousand Swords Return to OriginWeapon: Frost Fist, Scarlet Dagger, Wind Chasing Blade, Heavenly Wind BladeArmor: Snow Wolf Battle Boots, Divine Armor and Shadow CloakDivine Ability: Crazy Mode and Luck AuraBloodline: Dragon God BloodlineAccessories: Forging God Hammer, Power Bracelet, Power Ring and Power BeltAll item: 20 Recovery Medicinal Pill, 8 Double Exp Pill, Gift Pack Lv31\u201cStill need another 600 . 000 exp to level up, no wonder i haven\u2019t leveled up yet even after sucking them dry\u2026\u201dYi Tianyun shook his head, but realized that he can gain more exp by absorbing his opponent spiritual power first then kill them . Of course that is the ideal situation and he\u2019d like to do so to any opponent he encounter . But If there are too many enemies, then he can\u2019t do that easily .Absorption Star Great Technique is more suitable for dealing with a small number of enemies . If there are too many enemies obviously they will get in the way, maybe Yi Tianyun will be able to accelerate the absorption rate real fast later on if the level of the technique is really high .After finishing these two off very easily, he turned around and saw the two people who were dumbfounded . he smiled and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, of course not, I don\u2019t know Little Brother Yi is this strong . Are you a Core Condensation cultivator?\u201d Yan\u2019s family asked him not believing his eyes .\u201cI am at Fourth Level Core Condensation . \u201d Yi Tianyun smiled and took out the storage ring and handed it to Yan Lingxue . He said: \u201cThere are pills and weapons inside to strengthen your family . You can either leave Wind City or remain here . Made your choice . Anyway, i killed those two . Do you have any other enemies left?\u201d\u201cNo,we never provoke anybody to begin with, those two are just too greedy, their obsession toward Purple Fire Alchemy Furnace leads to this situation . \u201d Yan Family\u2019s Head felt guilty .\u201cYou decide what to do from here on out . I already cleared our escape route, I should leave as well . \u201d Yi Tianyun laughed .Before he came here, he had already defeated the guards outside, otherwise Yan Lingxue won\u2019t be able to follow him safely . It\u2019s just that Yan Lingxue didn\u2019t think that Yi Tianyun would be stronger than those two .\u201cYoung Master Yi, Are you really leaving\u2026?\u201d Yan Lingxue wants to stop him but can\u2019t think of any good reason .Yi Tianyun\u2019s strength, talent and his manner is just extraordinary, they believe that Yi Tianyun must have a strong faction as a backer, they don\u2019t think they can stop Yi Tianyun from leaving .Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYes, I still have something\u2026\u201dWhen Yi Tianyun was about to say something, there was a footstep outside the door, and a group of people came in from the outside . He saw a familiar face among them, that is Kong Liang!In addition to Kong Liang, there are two powerful expert, their fierce aura enveloped the whole room .Yi Tianyun observe them using Appraisal Eye . Immediately, information of the leader was described: Fourth Level of Core Condensation Realm, and wearing golden leather which could easily resist attack from Spirit Refinement Realm cultivator and can resist half of attack from lower level Core Condensation, combat power is 230 . 000!Judging from their appearance, it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re here for a cup of tea .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Pleased to make your acquaintance \u201dKong Liang, standing on the sideline, looked at the two bodies that already turned into charcoal was felt chill down his spine . He is relieved that he didn\u2019t provoke Yi Tianyun any further earlier, otherwise he could have met the same fate as these two .\u201cWind Pavilion\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun feels uncomfortable, not a single good memory when the word \u201cWind Pavilion\u201d comes into his mind .When he sees Kong Liang standing there, he realized this is not good, probably he returned to Wind Pavilion and telling them everything he sees . Yuan Ping probably have sent spy beforehand to monitor Yi Tianyun, otherwise he will not be coming this prepared .\u201cI am not interested . \u201d Yi Tianyun\u2019s said straightforwardly, they caused many conflicts, and they want him to join them? What a joke!\u201cLittle brother, why don\u2019t we have a talk before you decide hastily? Holy level alchemy furnace is a very good item to have . \u201d Yuan Ping\u2019s eyes suddenly become sharper, receiving the news on why those two came, there\u2019s only one reason .Now even his tone changed, he said \u201cYou can hold on to this item under one condition, you have to join Wind Pavilion!\u201d\u201cListening to you just now, makes me wonder, who exactly is the owner of this item? Is it you? Or me? How come you get to decide anything about it and not me?\u201d Yi Tianyun mocked him with sarcasm .\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid boy! I am giving you a chance here! Either you join us and you can hold on into that furnace or you can die here like those two\u201d Yuan Ping said, clearly aggravated by Yi Tianyun, \u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself just because you managed to kill those two, unlike new born Core Condensation like them, I\u2019m already far above them, with your third level core condensation, its futile fighting me boy!\u201dYuan Ping immediately released his Fourth level Core Condensation\u2019s aura . The aura is much thicker and stronger than those of Wang and Zeng Family Head released earlier . It\u2019s not shocking at the least to Yi Tianyun, after all Yuan Ping is a Vice Chief Pavilion Lord .\u201cYou Wind Pavilion, has always stoop so low, not only using dirty ways, you also try to control others by force, and now you want to put your hands on other person\u2019s treasures?\u201d Yi Tianyun shook his head, he thought that his problems with Wind Pavilion is already over the moment he escaped Wind City, he never expect that he has to confront them again, not this fast at least .\u201cBoy, I will give you one last chance! Give in now, or die!\u201d Yuan Ping\u2019s eyes filled with killing intent .He also brings another elder that has a similar cultivation as him . These two is far stronger than the those two family\u2019s head before . Because of this furnace, they couldn\u2019t control the greed in their heart, preparing to attack to take it by force if necessary .As long as he joins Wind Pavilion everything will be okay, but if he didn\u2019t want to, they will take the furnace by force!With eyes like a dead fish Yi Tianyun said \u201cAnd I also give you a last chance, either you fuck off or die!\u201dYan Lingxue and Yan Family Head both took a sigh of relief, they already entrusted the furnace to Yi Tianyun, and they clearly don\u2019t want it to fall to someone like Yuan Ping . They understand that holding to something as valuable like that is the same as inviting death! But they really are feeling grateful for Yi Tianyun to come to help them .\u201cKid, I give you some leeway to save your face, but it seems like you\u2019re too stubborn\u201d Yuan Ping clearly had enough of Yi Tianyun\u2019s arrogances \u201cIf that is what you want, then goodbye!\u201dWhen he finished speaking, Yuan Ping charged to attack Yi Tianyun . The storage ring on his hand is flashing with bright lights, revealing an upper spirit sword that he instantly grabs . He immediately took a stance to slash the sword into Yi Tianyun\u2019s body . With his fierce swordsmanship he released all his killing intent into the tip of his sword, trying to kill Yi Tianyun in an instant .\u201cFrost Fist, activate!\u201dYi Tianyun immediately uses the special effect of the frost fist, and the group of people in front of him, is already encased in ice . They are stuck to their place, clearly can\u2019t move and can\u2019t speak .Yi Tianyun walked over and smirked .\u201cCrazy Mode, activate!\u201d\u201cDouble Exp Pill!\u201dHe grabs Yuan Ping\u2019s frozen arm and align him with the other people that comes with him and activated his Absorbing Star Great Technique and began to absorb their spiritual power all at once .

He got to level up his weapons and his technique . And he also thinks that the frost fist is starting to become an overpowered item .Frost Fist (Low level Spirit weapon) . Effect: Ice attributes attack, slow down enemy movement speed attacked by the fist . Special skill: completely freeze an area within 200 meters from the user, causing super freeze, can last up to five minutes, and consume Crazy Points per usage .There is no details on the how high of a level of cultivation that can be frozen by the fist, just an indication on how long they would freeze . Based on this information alone already shows how overpowered this item is, seeing that no matter what he can freeze an opponent as long as he has enough Crazy Point for it .Yan Family Head and Yan Lingxue were gawking at the side, all they can feel is a chilling cold, and after that Yuan Ping and the others that comes with him is stopped in their track at the same time .Yuan Ping\u2019s eyes were shocked by this outcome, he was eager to talk to Yi Tianyun, he wanted to speak, but he couldn\u2019t move his mouth to produce a word . But in a way, how can he talk, as in this moment, he is frozen solid .After five horrifying minutes, the spiritual power in their bodies was completely drained leaving nothing at all!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter the freezing effect is ended, they began falling to the floor, completely weakened, as they have no spiritual power left on their bodies .\u201cYou, what kind of demon are you!\u201d Yuan Ping was shocked . In the end, it all the same, everyone that try to fight him, were left speechless!They have never seen anything like this before . Martial arts that can absorb the spiritual power from other persons and seeing someone that have such skill are standing in front of you! They all were terrified, and shocked .\u201cAm I a demon now?

Yuan Ping finally realized what kind of person he was facing . No wonder that Wang and Zeng Family Head were killed . It\u2019s not that they are too weak, but Yi Tianyun is just too strong!\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be this strong, but I can\u2019t die here just yet . Yuan Ping looked at him coldly and said: \u201cAs long as you let me go, then we can consider this never happen, we will never meet again in the future . If you kill me, Wind Pavilion will never let you go! Chief Pavilion Lord will avenge me, you think you can escape? Of course you can\u2019t boy!\u201dLet alone give up Yuan Ping even threatened Yi Tianyun . If he kill him, he will endure endless pursuits and never escape .\u201cIf you really think so, then you got to see this!\u201d Yi Tianyun looked at him with a sneer, raised his hand to his face, and gently removed the Hundred Transformation Mask, revealing his real face .After Yuan Ping and everyone else saw it, he was dumbfounded on the spot, he can\u2019t believe his eyes .They have seen this face on the wanted list . It\u2019s the wanted list distributed by Wind Pavilion . Anyone who can capture Yi Tianyun can become Vice Pavilion Lord of any Wind Pavilion branch! In addition to Vice Pavilion Lord, there are so many tempting rewards .Now that person is in front of himself, not only he\u2019s so strong, he can even create a perfect disguise .\u201cYou, you\u2026\u201d Yuan Ping is really shocked by this fact, he kept pointing his finger to Yi Tianyun but no words came out from his mouth .\u201cChase after me? you think I am still the same old Yi Tianyun?\u201d Yi Tianyun sneered, Yi Tianyun immediately unleash a heavy punch, Yuan Ping tried to block, but it\u2019s pointless .\u201cBoom!\u201dThe punch instantly killed them, turning them into exp for Yi Tianyun .[Ding, successful killing Yuan Ping, obtains 60 . 000 exp, Double Exp Pill, Heaven Feather Sword Technique, 1400 Crazy Point!][Ding, successfully killed Deacon Liu, obtains 50 . 000 exp, Double Exp Pill, 800 Crazy Point!]He got a bunch of exp, Crazy Point and some items from killing these two .[Ding, congratulations to the host, successfully breakthrough to Fifth Level Core Condensation!]Finally, he leveled up once again, successfully breakthrough to Fifth Level Core Condensation . This level up is very fast nonetheless, but this is not enough to satisfy him . Other cultivator will do anything to get this kind of system, but this isn\u2019t even enough for Yi Tianyun .Is this too slow? Those who are in their 30s and 40s are still at Third Level of Core Condensation . How old is Yi Tianyun now? Seventeen! Yet he\u2019s already at Fifth level of Core Condensation .Afterwards he turned around and face Yan Lingxue with his real face .\u201cYou, you are Yi Tianyun\u2026 Yi Yuntian, Yi Tianyun\u2026 You are the one Wind Pavilion have been looking for!\u201d Yan Ling Xue was shocked .\u201cYes, I am the one Wind Pavilion have been looking for . \u201d Yi Tianyun did not bother to explain anything to these two, he just said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that you can\u2019t stay here any longer, you better escape as soon as possible before Wind Pavilion or maybe Wang and Zeng Family come . \u201dVice-Chief Pavilion Lord of Wind Pavilion died here, there\u2019s no way this is not going to be a big news right?\u201cNo problem, little brother, we will leave tomorrow . \u201d Yan Family\u2019s Head nodded and said: \u201cyou must be careful as well, don\u2019t get yourself caught by Wind Pavilion\u2019s people . \u201d\u201cYan Family Head, don\u2019t worry, do I look that weak?\u201d Yi Tianyun laughed .\u201cIf you are weak, you won\u2019t be able to save me, and my daughter . \u201d Yan Family\u2019s Head smiled gently, not worried .Yi Tianyun shook his head, chuckled, but didn\u2019t say anything .\u201cYoung Master Yi, are you really leaving\u2026\u201d Yan Lingxue wants to stop him but can\u2019t think of any good reason .Yi Tianyun\u2019s strength, talent and his manner is just extraordinary, they believe that Yi Tianyun must have a strong faction as a backer, they don\u2019t think they can stop Yi Tianyun from leaving .Yi Tianyun smiled slightly and immediately turned back to wear the mask and said: \u201cYes, I still have something to do, goodbye!\u201dYan Lingxue wanted to say something, but refrain herself from doing so, she just sighed and bury everything in her heart .\u201cYan\u2019er, do you like him?\u201d Yan Jiazhu smiled .Yan Lingxue blushed, she nodded, but then shook his head, but did not say a word .\u201cHey, don\u2019t be too depressed .

Ever since she heard that Yi Tianyun is being pursued and escaped, she has been having this expression . So whoever saw her cold expression trembled in fear, and they can\u2019t help but ask her really carefully .It\u2019s been less than a week since the opening of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins . Yi Tianyun\u2019s quota has been empty, and she doesn\u2019t know how to fill this hole left by Yi Tianyun, Great elder has been cautious too ever since, that\u2019s why she ask her carefully .Shi Xueyun is normally cheerful, but when it comes to personal matter like this, she\u2019s just so scary to approach .\u201cLeave it empty , wait for Yi Tianyun . \u201d Shi Xueyun\u2019s voice was cold, even the elders felt chill down their spine .\u201cBut\u2026 what if he\u2019s still not here when Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins begin?\u201d Great Elder asked cautiously .\u201cI said empty it, waiting for Tianyun to come back, didn\u2019t you understand?\u201d Shi Xueyun glare at the Great Elder .They shuddered and immediately shook their heads . Palace Lord is like an empty shell . They don\u2019t know what to say to her .\u201cPalace Lord, I know that you are worried about Yi Tianyun, but we don\u2019t have a choice . When Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins began, can you let this quota be empty, and you are not willing to let other outstanding disciples enter? Besides, he clearly said that he has severed the ties with Jade Palace . Moreover, both Wing Sect and Wind Pavilion are involved . If we let Yi Tianyun participate or help him, it is like declaring war to them . Aren\u2019t we looking for unnecessary troubles here?\u201dOf course, the one speaking is Second Elder . Although she had a change of heart, she is very dissatisfied with such a big problem . She did not expect Yi Tianyun to dump this big trouble to Jade Palace .\u201cSecond Elder, do you think Tianyun brought trouble to our Jade Palace, instead of they provoked Yi Tianyun and at the end was defeated by him?\u201d Shi Xueyun was as sharp as ever, and Qin Xue told her what happened without missing any detail .At first, it was Kong Shengfeng, then Liang Tiancheng threatened to attack Jade Palace, and finally angered Yi Tianyun . how could it be Yi Tianyun\u2019s fault?\u201cEven if that is the case, we need to be indulgent for now . This is such a big event too, how can we mess this up?\u201d Second Elder was dissatisfied .\u201cIt\u2019s not something I can forgive! Our Jade Palace is too indulgent, causing them to look down on us . You think we haven\u2019t been indulgent enough over the years?\u201d Very sharp, Shi Xueyun\u2019s argument is really sound .It is a fine to endure, but that\u2019s not the case when they get over their heads like this .For example, this quota, if they were indulgent back then, they wouldn\u2019t be able to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins to begin with!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSecond Elder showed her helpless expressions . It\u2019s because their lack of strength, she thought that all they can do is to endure .\u201cPalace Lord\u2026\u201d At this time, the guards hurried in from the outside, and looked nervous: \u201cPalace Lord, people from Wing Sect and Spirit Sect is here\u2026\u201d\u201cHmmm? Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins are not open yet, aren\u2019t they too early\u2026 There must be some conspiracy!\u201d Shi Xueyun stood up and her face was cold . \u201cIf something happens to Yi Tianyun, I will bury the whole Wing Sect!\u201dHer voice is cold, no one doubted her words\u2026 because she really could do it, even though maybe not now, it is possible to do it .Shi Xueyun doesn\u2019t care about indulgent or appearances .

When they got outside, Wing Sect and Spirit Sect strode in with an imposing manner . Their cultivation is 6th Level of Core Condensation, and they are all in their thirties, compared with Shi Xueyun, the gap is just so obvious .Shi Xueyun is only in her early twenties . In term of cultivation she is much better than them as she is in Seventh Level Core Condensation . She is expected to be a Spirit Core in a few years with no troubles . This is a form of talent that rarely existed in this cultivation era . This is why that she can maintain her position as a palace lord so firmly .Throughout the history of Jade Palace, there has never been any strong cultivator in spirit core . This is why she has a very strong hold of the Jade Palace Lord, as cultivation and talent is all that matters in this world .\u201cWhat is the purpose of two masters come to my palace?\u201d Shi Xueyun is releasing her aura to show these two her strength . \u201cIf I remember correctly, there is still one week away before Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins begin, besides, it\u2019s just weird for you to come here instead of heading directly to Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins . \u201dStanding in front Shi Xueyun is Sect Master of Wing Sect, Qing Yuncheng and Sect Master of Spirit Sect, Jia Zhiyun . There are a few elders from each sect as well, following their Sect Master walking in arrogantly . This spells more and more like troubles .\u201cPalace Lord Shi, our purpose for coming here is actually quite simple . We demand that you give up your share of quota for Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins . We expected a compensation for the damage your disciple caused . \u201dThey come just for this share of quota, if not for this, they will surely come to Jade Palace demanding responsibility of Yi Tianyun actions much faster .\u201cYi Tianyun has already made a statement that he is no longer our disciple, and he is only our outer disciple to begin with . In that regard we can\u2019t take responsibility for his actions outside the palace!\u201d second elder immediately refuted this accusation as she is not willing to take any responsibility whatsoever .\u201cBullshit! Then if we send someone to kill you, and then make our own statement that they are not from our place, what would you do then?\u201d Qing Yuncheng countered the second elder argument immediately .This argument by Qing Yuncheng is really sound, making it hard to justify Yi Tianyun\u2019s actions .\u201cWhat a joke! This is what you\u2019ve always done, again and again . Your disciple is the one who provoke Yi Tianyun . Your disciple is too arrogant to recognize his own weakness, he slander Yi Tianyun by saying that the weapons he forged is fake and inferior . And he even dare to do a sneak attack when he already lose in a duel . There is no one to blame for his death!\u201dShi Xueyun said with a cold face, \u201cIf you do the same act as your disciple to me, i will definitely do the same thing! Slander and sneak attack, even your death can\u2019t pay for your act!\u201dHer words is really harsh . She is known for a lord who\u2019s not afraid to cause any troubles . That is proven now as she is not afraid to face pressure given by two sect masters . Although that she is sure that neither Jade Palace nor Yi Tianyun have ever crossed path with Spirit Sect, but since they also come here along with Wing Sect, that fact alone already proved they\u2019re up to no good .A few elders is shocked by Shi Xueyun\u2019s arrogant behavior . She sure is powerful enough to make Jade Palace stronger, but at this rate she could cause a disaster too .\u201cWho can prove your words?\u201d QingYuncheng sneered: \u201cAs the matter of fact, we want to bring him back for questioning, but he killed people that comes after him peacefully . This is unexpected from Jade Palace to act like this . Its so unreasonable . \u201dQing Yuncheng quickly twist his words, distorting the fact to his benefits .\u201cDo I look like a three years old to you? Do you think I believe that you just want to bring him in for questioning? What a joke!\u201d Shi Xueyun waves her hands in dismissal \u201cDon\u2019t even think about getting hold on my share of quota, I want you all to leave my place, we are going to prepare to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins!\u201dShi Xueyun is assertive as usual and she didn\u2019t have a second thought on people like them . However, she knows that the people she argue with here have a strong influence, if that\u2019s not the case she would\u2019ve attacked them as they speak .Although she is only on her early twenties, she is definitely a force to be reckoned with . Mistreatment that she received is far more cruel than what she faced now, but she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill is she has to, that is just how she was taught, to never be a pushover, never give up, and let no one stop her .Qing Yuncheng\u2019s face becomes much more enraged than before . He didn\u2019t expect Shi Xueyun to be so hard to talk to . It\u2019s a form of humiliation to mistreat not one but two sect master so casually at a time .\u201cPalace Lord Shi, seems like we don\u2019t get the respect that we deserve, now don\u2019t blame any of us if this becomes a terrible situation for you . \u201d Qing Yuncheng made a gesture to the elders that comes with him, and they began to surround Shi Xueyun and also block the escape route .The two sect join up together and get ready to fight the Lord of Jade Palace .This scene immediately worried the disciples of Jade Palace .

She is happy that Yi Tianyun is becoming a force to be reckoned with, and sad that Tiayun \u00a0no longer needed her.\u201cWing Sect\u2026 will not let you get away\u2026\u201d with his remaining power, he uttered a single sentence to Yi Tianyun.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, be it Wing Sect, Wind Pavilion, Spirit Sect, I will eradicate it one by one!\u201d Yi Tianyun answered coldly \u201cuntil none of you remain!\u201dAfter he finished his sentence, Yi Tianyun slammed Qing Tianlong with his foot. Finishing Qing Tianlong once and for all![Ding, successfully killed Qing Tianlong, obtains 500.000 Exp, Martial Arts Blood Fiend Soaring Heaven, Blood Fiend Divine Spear, Blood Fiend Bracelet, 1000 Blacksmith Mastery, 1000 Crazy Point!][Ding, killing enemy with huge power differences, get 10 Lottery Ticket, 10.000 Crazy Point!][Random Quest Completed.][Reward: 100.000 Exp, 2000 Gold, Lottery Ticket, 100 Overall Favorability.]The reward is granted immediately, giving him two pieces of holy level tools, he didn\u2019t expect this kind of development at all. While everyone is trying very hard to obtain these kind of items, he easily got two of them, although it\u2019s a low level one, but it still amazing to obtain 2 holy level tools at a same time.In addition to this, he got 10 Lottery Ticket for killing enemy far above his level. This is equal to spending 10.000 points worth of crazy point, but he still feel a little disheartened, that he didn\u2019t instantly level up after killing boss level enemy.However, since he got a pretty great reward, he doesn\u2019t sulk too much. He can\u2019t be greedy with the reward, the reward itself is pretty good anyway.\u201cHe is at a super-elite level, and the rewards are really good for this kind of miscellaneous quest.\u201d Yi Tianyun is still very satisfied, he succeeded in defending the Jade Palace, that is more important for him than a simple quest reward.After killing Qing Tianlong and receiving his reward, Shi Xueyun ran toward him, and gently tapping his head: \u201cYou really are a show off, don\u2019t think I would forgive you for running away!\u201dYi Tianyun become embarrassed for his actions and scratched his head, with a smirk he said: \u201cAuntie, I\u2019m doing this solely for the sake of Jade Palace safety!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou can\u2019t decide things like that on your own, and you didn\u2019t even bother to give me information regarding your well being, I thought you were dead\u2026\u201d Shi Xueyun\u2019s eyes are red she remembered the fear she felt before, shedding tears again in her eyes.Yi Tianyun hugged Shi Xueyun and comforted her: \u201ccalm down aunt, how can I be dead? You don\u2019t know how powerful I\u2019ve became, the more people attacking me, the more they\u2019ll regret their decision! I am just too strong as you can see, I will definitely protect you in the future. So no harm will come your way!\u201dHe sincerely said this from the bottom of his heart. It was always Shi Xueyun who protected him. Now it\u2019s time for him to return the favor.\u201cCih! Now you are boasting, are you for real?\u201d After Shi Xueyun came out of his arms, she snorted with a sigh of relief, and immediately smiled like a beautiful flower she is. \u201cit\u2019s weird feeling, But it is definitely not bad.\u201dYi Tianyun feels very happy to see his aunt to smile so beautifully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - Palace TreasurePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71: Palace\u00a0TreasureThe invasion has come to an end. The news quickly spread throughout the faction in the area, of course all of them react the same, shocked! Jade Palace\u2019s strength is considered below average, yet they successfully drive away these three factions and even kill their respective lord.What\u2019s left of these factions? They lost their respective lord, leaving everything to their youngster, obviously this will affect the power balance in the area. Despite losing their lords, of course their overall strength can\u2019t be taken lightly.In the conference hall of Jade Palace.\u201cI\u2019m appointing Tianyun as an elder, is there anyone against my decision?\u201dShi Xueyun looked at everyone, all the elders and deacons. They are all sitting here, with a dignified expression on their face.\u201cNo one?\u201dEveryone nodded confirming that they didn\u2019t object about this decision. Yi Tianyun did save the entire Jade Palace from such grave situation, no wonder Shi Xueyun went as far as making an exception for Tianyun\u2019s sake, and no one is against her decision.\u201cI have something to say.\u201dIt\u2019s none other than Yi Tianyun himself!\u201cPalace Lord, I think it would be better if i remain as an outer disciple for everyone and my sake as well, besides you shouldn\u2019t make exceptions like this. And I\u2019m not good at managing things in the palace.\u201d Yi Tianyun didn\u2019t expect this outcome, he came here thinking they would discuss something else.He needs to do a lot of things to level up, but as an elder he won\u2019t have time for that. He doesn\u2019t want to be shackled by this kind of thing.\u201cYou have to. The rules can be changed, you don\u2019t need to do anything as an elder, besides, by declaring you are the elder of Jade Palace will make other faction reluctant to attack us. If it is not because of you, there would be no Jade Palace now!\u201d Shi Xueyun glared at him and make sure that Yi Tianyun couldn\u2019t reject her offer.The other elders nodded, accepting Yi Tianyun as an elder, as Shi Xueyun wants. But they still have some doubts about the continuation of Shi Xueyun\u2019s speech.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun saw Shi Xueyun glaring at himself. He suddenly sighed and said helplessly: \u201cOk, I accept the elder position.\u201dThe disciples couldn\u2019t help but smile seeing this situation. Most disciples would instantly agree if they\u2019re offered this position, yet Yi Tianyun clearly want nothing to do with it.\u201cOkay, that settles it, now onto the next problem. As you all know, we have defeated three major faction lords. It would be fine if this is the end of it, but of course things won\u2019t go that easily, most probably they\u2019ll be back for revenge. Be ready because they could attack anytime, as their goal is to obtain our treasures.\u201d Shi Xueyun said with confidence.What is Jade Palace\u2019s treasure? Yi Tianyun wondered, he doesn\u2019t know anything about it, but he can\u2019t just ask it blatantly, as he doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201cThe third problem that we need to discuss is the treasure itself. I intend to hand it over to Tianyun for safekeeping, any thought on this matter from everyone else?\u201d Shi Xueyun said all of a sudden.Yi Tianyun is stunned, everyone turned their eyes toward him spontaneously, as he was granted the ownership of the treasure out of the blue.\u201cPalace Lord, i can\u2019t agree on this one, because no one should keep the treasures other than Palace Lord itself.\u201d Great Elder voiced her regarding this matter.Although Yi Tianyun already became an elder for Jade Palace. The only person fit to use the treasure is none other than the palace lord.\u201cI have my own reason for this, it\u2019s because he is much stronger than me, there is no doubt that he could use it better than me, and if those three major factions attack us again, he can use the treasure to defeat them with ease.\u201d Shi Xueyun stated her reason to hand the treasure to Yi Tianyun.The elders can\u2019t say anything, as Shi Xueyun definitely stated the truth. They have seen what Yi Tianyun is capable of, they can\u2019t object if Shi Xueyun put it that way.\u201cWait, I don\u2019t know even know what the treasure is\u201d Yi Tianyun raised his hand and finally got the chance to ask.\u201cThis is the treasure.\u201d Shi Xueyun took out a piece of jade, a slight cold is emitted from the jade, everyone in the room could sense this slight cold.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dYi Tianyun observed the piece of jade and detailed information about it appeared in front of him immediately.Ice Soul Jade: Passive effect soothe the soul and improve the cultivation pace. Active effect, create a freezing field, freeze everything in a certain radius. Middle level holy tool.\u201cMiddle level holy tool, it does deserve to be called the treasure of the Jade palace.\u201dYi Tianyun nodded, but he clearly didn\u2019t have much interest. Shi Xueyun said that he could use it better than her, it\u2019s true that he can produce the effect of frozen field better, but since the effect overlaps with Frost Fist, he lost his interest.\u201cThis is Ice Soul Jade, it\u2019s very good to improve your cultivation pace, and it has freezing effect as well. Combined with your freezing martial arts earlier surely will enhance the effect dramatically.\u201d Shi Xueyun smiled at Yi Tianyun, she clearly remember Yi Tianyun\u2019s fight earlier.She gave the treasure to to Yi Tianyun so he can cultivate even faster and become stronger.\u201cPalace Lord, I can\u2019t accept this item, to tell you the truth, this item is wasted on me, you should keep it, as in term of attribute, you are much more in sync than me, you have an ice affinity, and i don\u2019t so it will be more suitable if you use it rather than me.\u201d Yi Tianyun said his reasoning with confidence.\u201cYou keep it!\u201d Shi Xueyun is still stubborn about it.\u201cNo, you would be more suitable!\u201d Yi Tianyun is also being stubborn.Shi Xueyun clearly is not happy about Yi Tianyun\u2019s decision, but as she looks into Tianyun\u2019s eye filled with conviction, she couldn\u2019t help but sighed \u201cOk, I will keep the treasure.\u201dThe elders are all relieved, they are kind of vexed if someone other than Palace Lord keep the treasure.Yi Tianyun himself doesn\u2019t really need the treasure, as he already has three holy tools in his possession, even if the treasure he possessed is not a middle level holy tool but he prefer having holy tools with various effect.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cProceeding to the next problem. About the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, as you all know we killed two sect masters, so their quota belong to us now, so we have an additional seven quota to enter the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins. We still have a week to find the candidates. Regarding that matter, I require your cooperation to re-elect eight disciples to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins test!\u201d Shi Xueyun smiles, as the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is a very good place to cultivate, there is no doubt that clearing it will help the disciples to breakthrough.\u201cRe-electing eight?\u201d Yi Tianyun said, \u201cWhat about me?\u201dSeveral elders looked at him in a funny way, and immediately Shi Xueyun smiled and said: \u201cYou can\u2019t get in, you\u2019re already in Core Condensation realm. The highest realm to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is a spirit refinement realm.\u201d\u201cI already outlevel Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins? How can I complete the main quest now? This is frustrating!\u201dYi Tianyun can\u2019t believe what he just heard, he didn\u2019t expect Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins to have a level restriction, now how could he get in there to complete his main quest?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is the one and only Main Quest line that he got, but he knows that a main quest must be completed no matter what. He knows that if he doesn\u2019t complete the main quest, he can\u2019t progress further, all he can do is randomly hunt monster or utilize his craftmanship.\u201cBecause my level is too high, I can\u2019t complete my main quest. How is this possible?\u201dYi Tianyun thinks that the situation that he is in right now is very unreasonable. If the level is higher, wouldn\u2019t it be easier to complete quest? However, he knows the fact that Shi Xueyun will not tell him a lie. He can\u2019t enter the ruins if he is higher than Spirit Refinement Realm.Yi Tianyun is trying to think the way to solve the situation that he is in right now, as he knows that no one else know about his quest to clear Heaven Immersing Ancient Ruins. Shi Xueyun keeps on consoling him \u201cYour realm is already too high to enter the Ruins, doing trials won\u2019t do you any good, your cultivation won\u2019t improve that much.\u201d\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun forcing a smile for Shi Xueyun sake, he still wants to argue more to force himself into the ruins, but he doesn\u2019t want to trouble Shi Xueyun any further.Still, he keeps on thinking the way to complete his main quest.The next discussion is to choose the disciple that worthy enough to be the representative of Jade Palace to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, eight of them. This discussion surely is one most of the exciting discussion that they have, because the Jade Palace never got their hands on this much quota, of course this will improve their overall strength, as the Ruins promises a lot of treasures.If Yi Tianyun wasn\u2019t sidetracked by side quest and he didn\u2019t level up as much as he is now, all the loots from the ruins surely would be his.After all of the discussions has come to an end, Yi Tianyun quietly returns to his room still depressed and anxious, he still can\u2019t find a way to finish his main quest. He surely thinks that if he can\u2019t finish this quest, he can\u2019t continue his progress, as a main quest is like a life goal for him.\u201cI\u2019ll stop thinking about it for now, I should use all this free lottery tickets first!\u201dYi Tianyun realized that he can\u2019t make any progress, but if he keeps on overthinking things without a clear answer, what he needs now is a change of pace, he still has time anyway, still a week remain to enter Heaven Immersing Ancient Ruins. Immediately he shift his focus onto the lotteries, he has a total of 11 free lottery tickets. This is the first time he has a chance on so many free lotteries.He quickly activates the lottery system with his thought. Suddenly a big roulette appeared in front of him, which of course can\u2019t be seen by anyone else but him.\u201cLuck Aura, activate!\u201dTo draw a lottery, he must activate the Luck Aura to increase his chance on getting a good draw.\u201cStart the lottery!\u201dThe roulette began to spin steadily and became much faster overtime, and soon the pointer abruptly stopped, and pointed on \u2018consumables\u2019 tile.\u201cWhat the hell, a consumable item?!?\u201dYi Tianyun feels a little bit helpless, despite using his Luck Aura, he still got a bad draw.[Ding, get 10.000 Exp Pill.]\u201d10.000 Experience Pill? This is too small! Start again!\u201dThis amount of exp is worthless for him. 10.000 of exp will just slightly increase his exp bar, definitely not what he wanted. He starts to draw the lottery again, as he thinks that surely his bad luck would eventually runs out.[Ding, get 50.000 Exp Pill!]\u201cStart again!\u201dHe immediately retries his attempt with a slight irritation on his face.[Ding, get a Life!]\u201cStart\u2026. A what?!\u201dYi Tianyun was startled for a moment, he quickly reads the information that popped up when he sees the recent item that he get from the draw.Life: When host dies, it is automatically activated and instantly revived.As he investigate on this item so called \u2018life\u2019 he quickly became overwhelmed, how can he get a life as a reward? On top of that it\u2019s automatically used when he died, which means he doesn\u2019t need to worry about the timing to use it.\u201cGood stuff!\u201dYi Tianyun slams his own thigh in excitement. He thought that, \u201cThis is it! This is definitely a top quality consumable from the draw!\u201d He knows that life is the most important thing that a person can have.\u201cIt seems that not all consumables were worthless after all.\u201dYi Tianyun shift his eyes at the roulette again and feels a little bad for it, \u201cI feel bad for keep on blaming my luck onto this thing, I\u2019m sorry. I hope that I can continue to receive an item like the last one!\u201dWith this \u2018life\u2019 as an item that he gets from the lottery, his disappointment is completely gone, as in his mind, he already got such a good item to expect.\u201cStart Again!\u201dSoon the Lottery Roulette spins again, and unexpectedly the pointer stopped at the Divine Ability Tiles.Yi Tianyun hold his breath in anticipation, this time he got a divine ability!\u201cDing\u2013\u201d something rolled down from the roulette and opened a treasure chest in front of it. Yi Tianyun rushed over to the chest with excitement and see that the treasure chest contains a luck aura!\u201cWhat? A Luck Aura? How can I get this again?\u201d Yi Tianyun is dumbfounded. He can\u2019t seem to get the point on having two of the same ability.\u201cDing, successfully get Luck Aura, because Luck Aura is already integrated, automatically converting Luck Aura into 10.000 Crazy Point.\u201d\u201cPitiful! At least give me enough Crazy Point to level it up!\u201d Yi Tianyun feels cheated, he gets his high up when the pointer stopped at divine ability, but instead he got 10.000 Crazy Points, which is not enough to level up his crazy mode, nor it can level up his luck aura.He quickly rushed his lottery, after such a disappointment. He gets a lot of good items, but they fail to excite him like before. There were Life, 10.000 Exp Pill, 50.000 Exp Pill x3, Frost Fist, Phoenix Silver Spear, Luck Aura, Tyrant Armor, Bad Luck Potion, and Strengthening Pill!That is all the items he gets from the roulette. The most useless one are 10.000 exp pill and Frost Fist. Unlike the luck aura, Frost Fist isn\u2019t converted into crazy points, simply waste another slot on his inventory.But he still got quite a lot of good item.\u201cTyrant Armor, the effect is keep enemy under pressure for 1 minute. Suppressing them\u2026 Useless.\u201d\u201cPhoenix Silver Spear is an upper level spirit tool with no effect. So useless, what a garbage!\u201d\u201cBad Luck Potion, can be thrown into enemy, or taken by self, the bad luck effect enhances the chance for having a bad luck 10 Times. How am i supposed to use this?\u201d\u201cStrengthening Pill, permanently enhances power. This one is good. It gives a permanent enhancement of power.\u201dYi Tianyun checked the item he gets one by one, some items have decent effect such as \u2018life\u2019 and Strengthening Pill, but the rest were not very useful for him.He immediately took the Strengthening Pill, and his combat power increased by a few hundred. The slight increase of combat power is understandable, although it\u2019s a rare item, it still is a small pill, he can\u2019t keep his hope too high on it, but his physique surely got slightly toned than before.\u201cJust what is the point for having 2 of these Frost Fists? The grade is still on common iron level weapon!\u201d Yi Tianyun clearly confused of what to do, this is awkward, what he got is mostly a garbage.Tianyun decides to just store the Frost Fist to the storage first. The mechanism of Yi Tianyun\u2019s storage is equally the same as the storage ring, it\u2019s possible to store any equipment and materials in it.While he store the Frost Fist, two additional option than usual popped in the menu. That is a \u2018Fusion\u2019 and \u2018sell\u2019 options.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cA\u2018Fusion\u2019 and a \u2018Sell\u2019 option? I never saw these options before.\u201dYi Tianyun immediately presses the \u2018Sell\u2019 button and a message suddenly popped up \u201cSell for 500 Crazy Point?\u201d\u201cProfit oriented fuck!\u201d Yi Tianyun curses the system quietly. He feels cheated again and again by this system. He needs 10.000 Crazy Points to buy Frost Fist, but he only gets 500 Crazy Points for selling it? What a fraud!\u201cI\u2019ll use the fusion effect.\u201dYi Tianyun pushes the \u2018Fusion\u2019 button, and immediately the new Frost Fist synthesized into his original Frost Fist, increasing his mastery on the original Frost Fist by a hundred! After he look at the data again, he notices that only the mastery is increasing, the level is not improved at all. Still it\u2019s so much more worth to increase mastery than to sell it for a meager price.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I wonder if this is applicable to other weapons as well?\u201d But, before that he makes sure to check the price, because if the price is quite high it would be better to sell it rather than improve mastery slightly.[Phoenix Silver Spear, the price is 500 Crazy Point, sell?]\u201cSell your ass!\u201dYi Tianyun rolled his eyes and didn\u2019t expect it to be an upper level spirit tool. It\u2019s only worth 500 Crazy Point here. However, it actually makes sense, if he can sell it for quite a high price, he can abuse the system to do another lottery and sell again, forming a loop.\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll use it for Fusion.\u201dYi Tianyun click on Phoenix Silver Spear. There\u2019s fusion and sell option as well. He clicked fusion. A different pop up message appeared: \u201cSelect the main and secondary weapon!\u201d\u201cFrost Fist as main, and Phoenix Silver as secondary.\u201dImmediately after clicking, Phoenix Silver Spear turned into energy, and absorbed into Frost Fist increasing 500 mastery to the current 1100 mastery, which became 1600 mastery.\u201cGood!\u201dYi Tianyun is quite satisfied, this feature really helps. In addition, he also used the Tyrant Armor for fusion. Although it\u2019s an armor, it can be used to increase a weapon\u2019s mastery, adding 300 mastery. Not so bad.\u201cHow about the rest of my items, I guess I\u2019ll check everything while i\u2019m at it\u201dYi Tianyun has a lot of unnecessary items, be it martial arts, or common level weapons.Then he checked Blood Glow Sword, which is a true spirit tool. He clicked sell to check its price and turns out it\u2019s worth 500 Crazy Point.\u201cNot bad!\u201d Yi Tianyun said, \u201cnow let\u2019s have a look on martial arts\u2026\u201dHe checked those low level martial arts as well, the price varies, but because it\u2019s low level martial arts, the price is around 1000 to 2000 Crazy Points. There are also low level weapons, with lower price, which is understandable.But in addition to this, there is fusion feature, which makes him really excited.\u201cMartial arts can be used for fusion as well?\u201d Yi Tianyun\u2019s eyes sparkle, he quickly used these martial arts as fodder for Absorbing Stars Great Technique, but when he clicked Fusion\u2026[Insufficient Level.]\u201cWhat?\u201d Yi Tianyun is startled, the level is too low?Seems like things are not going as smooth as he expected. Then he switched the main with Frost Fist and the secondary with low level weapon.[Insufficient Level.]When he selected those common level weapon for fusion, this message popped up again.\u201cWeird, how could it fail? Was the Frost Fist not a common level before?\u201dYi Tianyun think real hard and finally figure out what\u2019s going on. The reason why Frost Fist can be fusion is because it is the same variety, as for different variety requires both items to be on the same grade.For example, Frost Fist is now a spirit tool, which means the material for the fusion must be spirit tool as well. That applies for martial arts as well.\u201cIt seems there\u2019s no choice but to sell these.\u201dYi Tianyun shook his head, since there\u2019s nothing else he can do, that being said he still managed to accumulate quite a lot of Crazy Points.He cleared quite a lot of items from his inventory.Afterwards Yi Tianyun open his status bar.Host: Yi TianyunLevel: 27 (Seventh Level Core Condensation)Exp:617281/1500000Crazy Point: 43728Prestige: 70Cultivation Techniques: Dark North Divine Art, Dragon God Secret ArtMartial Arts: Absorbing Stars Great Technique, Sky Cloud Step, Blood Fiend Soaring HeavenWeapon: Frost Fist, Scarlet Dagger, Wind Chasing Blade, Blood Fiend SpearArmor: Snow Wolf Battle Boots, Divine Armor, Shadow CloakDivine Ability: Crazy Mode, Luck AuraBloodline: Dragon God BloodlineAccessories: Forging God Hammer, Power Bracelet, Power Ring, Power Belt, Blood Fiend BraceletAll items: 18 Recovery Medicinal Pill, 5 Double Experience Pill, Gift Pack Lv31, Life, Bad Luck PillHe didn\u2019t sell the Blood Fiend Spear, but sell all of the Blood Glow Sword. He managed to acquite a few thousand of Crazy Point without using Crazy Point card and increase mastery here and there.\u201cI finally figure out how to use this shop. Basically I buy stuff to increase mastery\u2026\u201dYi Tianyun shook his head then looked at the unbelievable price of the items listed in shop, and can\u2019t help but shocked when he imagined buying these items in a huge amount to upgrade mastery.For example, earth level Absorbing Stars Great Technique, which costs 200.000 Crazy Point, it\u2019s not that expensive, but who knows how many mastery can it contribute? if it only adds 10.000 points, it is not worth it.After all, to level up, ten Fusion material is required, so the total is 2.000.000 Crazy Point, how can he get that much to begin with?He\u2019s curious about how much Life cost and he quickly search it, but when he found out about the cost, he regretted trying to find it \u2013 1.000.000.000 Crazy Point.\u201cWhat the hell, how can it be this expensive!\u201d but he can\u2019t do anything about it, instead he checked the selling priceYi Tianyun clicked sell on the Life in his inventory, he didn\u2019t expect much but this is just too irrational, it\u2019s only worth 300 Crazy Point.\u201cFuck you!\u201dIt\u2019s as if Yi Tianyun has gone mad, talking to himself in the room. 1.000.000.000 Crazy Point is worth 300 Crazy Point? At the very least it should be worth 100.000.000! With 100.000.000 Crazy Point, he can get whatever he wanted even heaven level martial arts, with that amount of Crazy Point, it will be even easier to be stronger.It\u2019s a pity that his dreams are shattered. He decided to go out and kill some monsters to vent his frustration.\u201cSeems like there\u2019s nothing I can do untill Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins open, I guess i\u2019ll wait, maybe there\u2019s some kind of way to enter.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter drawing lottery there\u2019s nothing else to do, all he can do is hunt some monsters in the area untill Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is open.At this time someone knocked on his door. He wonders who it is.Immediately, he opened the door and saw Jiu Lingyun. She said: \u201cSenior Brother Yi, I will take the test tomorrow, can you take a look?\u201d while blushing.\u201cI almost forgot, tomorrow is outer disciple assessment, when will you participate? Then I will be cheering for you tomorrow!\u201d Yi Tianyun said with a smile.Tomorrow is outer disciple assessment to see who will eventually be selected as inner disciple. When Jiu Lingyun was accepted here, she had been working hard to become outer disciple, and Yi Tianyun doesn\u2019t know how she\u2019s doing now because it\u2019s been quite hectic ever since he arrived at Jade Palace. He will definitely go see it tomorrow, after all, he\u2019s the one who asked Jiu Lingyun to come here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: Spiritual Impact ArrayPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74: Spiritual Impact\u00a0ArrayFinally the assesment day came!The original assessment for the disciple of Jade Palace is not really strict so to speak, but because the influence of Jade Palace expanded from the encounter before, it\u2019s a necessity for Jade Palace to increase the amount of key disciple they have. They need to constantly rejuvenate the generations of disciple they have to make Jade Palace still be a relevant place to cultivate.Jiu Lingyun stands beside Yi Tianyun, in an anxious manner \u201cBig Brother Yi, I am nervous\u2026\u201dThe two of them is already on their way to the assessment site. She always feels that she is not good enough, she thinks that her level is way below average. She has no confidence at all, that is almost a certainty that she got that lack of confidence from the treatment she got growing up, or it still may because of the sudden change of environment she get from the Jade Palace.\u201cRest assured, I will watch over you, try your best, and believe in yourself.\u201d Yi Tianyun tries to encourage Jiu Lingyun.He didn\u2019t see Jiu Lingyun\u2019s practice and performance that often but he thinks that Jiu Lingyun would be doing just fine on her own, he believes than Jiu Lingyun surely had many practices on her own. He believes that she will deliver.Jiu Lingyun is relieved, hearing Yi Tianyun\u2019s words reassured her a little bit.The venue is already crowded with disciples. The assessment involve quite a lot of outer disciples, and not to mention that most of them have a quite good innate power too.\u201cLook, Elder Yi come with a woman, who is she? How could she become close with Elder Yi?\u201d\u201cShe must be after something from Elder Yi, she must have been begging to learn some kind of innate ability from the elder, there is no way some woman from the slums have the innate ability to climb the rank! On top of that her appearance is really ugly!\u201d\u201cI heard she brought her younger brother here for safety, many of us do too, but its not fair that she gets an unfair treatment, all of us need so much effort to climb the rank!\u201dLots of the outer disciples are feeling disdain toward the relationship between Jiu Lingyun and Yi Tianyun that they thought she received special treatment, and began to spread false rumors about her. Yi Tianyun sighed from this negative stare toward Jiu Lingyun, this is embarrassing, how come they become so jealous of her.Jiu Lingyun joined Jade Palace by Yi Tianyun\u2019s recommendation. Most of the disciples already heard about this and they think Yi Tianyun is being unfair to the other rest of the disciple. Some finds that it just the kind hearted person that Yi Tianyun is, and some other thinks that a people from the slum should not dirtied the Jade Palace ground!As they passed the disciple, Jiu Lingyun can\u2019t help but hear this false rumor about her and Yi Tianyun. She was shocked and sad hearing this false rumor, and began to feel inferior and more nervous than before.\u201cDon\u2019t listen to them, you just have to prove them wrong with your own strength. Use their negativity as a fuel to push you forward!\u201d Yi Tianyun give Jiu Lingyun a smile to comfort her.\u201cI know, Young Master Yi\u2026\u201d Jiu Lingyun still didn\u2019t have the courage to lift her head, scared from the glare she might receive from the other disciple around her.Looking at this development, Yi Tianyun immediately took Jiu Lingyun to the examination site, with about a dozen candidates waiting, this little amount of candidates is actually normal, because Jade Palace only recruit female, considering the fact that female itself already so scarce in the cultivations world, it just so ordinary to have this small number of recruit for Jade Palace.However, as Jiu Lingyun keep her stride toward the site, the rumors don\u2019t stop, in fact it gets even worse.\u201cShe really is making everyone envy of her, if you seduce Elder Yi, even you could pass the assesment easily\u201d\u201cWhat to envy of her? If I was in Elder Yi\u2019s shoes, I would do the same thing, I would ask my mother to come here, she was a mere farmer after all.\u201d\u201cClearly Elder Yi just took pity of her, how can he look at her other than pity? She is so dirty, all her clothes are worn out, but she still wants to join Jade Palace!\u201dThe outer disciple around them keeps whispering back and forth, clearly if they are not afraid of Yi Tianyun, they would talk louder it\u2019s not even surprising if they drive Jiu Lingyun out simply by yelling at her.While they merely whispered in almost inaudible voice to a regular person, Yi Tianyun can hear them loud and clear. His cultivation is at the level that he can hear a small voice from afar, making him more difficult to be ambushed from afar.Yi Tianyun glimpsed to all of his surrounding, checking the outer disciple one by one, and come to conclusion that they\u2019re way out of line, they thought just because Jiu Lingyun is here by Yi Tianyun\u2019s recommendation, she\u2019ll get special treatment and pass the exam easily regardless the result she achieved.They can\u2019t be more wrong. He won\u2019t treat anyone specially, he won\u2019t be biased. If Jiu Lingyun is not reaching the standard to become an inner disciple, than she has to make do being the outer disciple.\u201cYou can badmouth me all you want, but don\u2019t you dare say anything bad to Big Brother Yi!\u201d Suddenly Jiu Lingyun screamed at them with a red eye \u201cI will prove it to you, that I can become the inner disciple with my own strength, Big Brother Yi don\u2019t need to do anything! I will silence you all, just you wait!\u201dYi Tianyun didn\u2019t expect Jiu Lingyun to stand up for herself, he smiled, clearly being a timid girl is not going to solve her problem, so this is good for her improvement.When they saw that Yi Tianyun is looking over to their directions, they are all stopped talking, but the expression they have is still that of disdain and disgusted.They clearly don\u2019t care about Jiu Lingyun\u2019s words. They didn\u2019t belive anything Jiu Lingyun has just said.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay any attention to them, in fact you need this kind of negativity and use it to channel your own power. There\u2019s no better way to silence them other than proving your strength.\u201d Yi Tianyun smiles at Jiu Lingyun.\u201cYeah!\u201d Jiu Lingyun clenched her fists. Without saying anything else, she makes a resolution to prove her own worth, she need to show her power, to shut their mouth.Not long after, Deacon Liang comes. Deacon Liang is the Deacon who manages the outer disciple here in Jade Palace.She respects Yi Tianyun deeply because Yi Tianyun\u2019s status is much higher than her.She turns her head to look at Jiu Lingyun at Yi Tianyun\u2019s side, she looks at Yi Tianyun, clearly wanted to say something regarding Jiu Lingyun, before she could speak however.\u201cThere\u2019s no special treatments, conduct the assesment with the usual standard, and follow a strict supervision!\u201d Yi Tianyun look at Deacon Liang with a serious face.Deacon Liang smiled at Yi Tianyun and nodded lightly. She also disliked a special treatment because of relationship, she thinks that kind of conditioning is disgusting, for her the kind of people to use relationship as a base to join is basically stating that person has no talent whatsoever. She is the living proof, she wasn\u2019t given any kind of special treatment but she still managed to become an inner disciple easily. She doesn\u2019t want to be a burden to Jade Palace for her own weakness if the time comes for Jade Palace\u2019s defences.After the quick exchange with Yi Tianyun, Deacon Liang began her brief explanation. \u201cThis is Spiritual Impact Array, it will constantly use an attack called soul strike, all you need to do is withstand the soul strike from this tool, withstanding ninth wave will grant you the status of official disciple and withstanding up to eleventh wave will grant you the status of inner disciple!\u201dFortunately, the candidates only need to withstand two more wave to be considered an inner disciple. He considers it as some kind of convenience, but he does think that not everyone have what it takes to withstand atleast up to the sixth wave.This test is to divide the disciple into official disciple and inner disciple based on their innate ability. The Inner Disciple having a better potential and innate ability than the outer disciple, is focused in a better training environment.\u201cOnly nine waves this time? I thought they would insist on thirteenth or fourteenth wave!\u201d\u201cThirteenth or fourteenth wave impacts? Don\u2019t be stupid, you barely able to do ten wave!\u201d\u201cYes, a spiritual cultivation is much harder than body cultivation.\u201d\u201cI remember a long time ago someone someone managed to hold on until the thirteenth wave\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe disciple talks about the previous assessment and some rumor about it, and can\u2019t really believe they got such a convenience to become an inner disciple.\u201cYes, there was indeed a relatively high-level identification of innate ability for this assessment. I, myself managed to hold untill thirteenth wave. Now I have joined the inner court, Inner court standard is much more advanced than this.\u201d Deacon Liang said patiently: \u201cAlthough the inner disciple standard for now is eleventh wave, if you could hold on for more than thirteenth wave impacts, it would be good for your future, and you\u2019ll definitely earn elder\u2019s attention for that.\u201dWhen she finished her explanation, the whole candidates became amazed. They can attract the elder attention if they could withstand fourteenth wave of impacts? This is really tempting.Yi Tianyun smiles, this test is to assess the disciple\u2019s spiritual power. If the disciple can hold on until the fourteenth wave of impacts, it means they have a high spiritual power, therefore they have a high potential in all aspects for their future!Now, after a while, he becomes a little bit excited. He doesn\u2019t know Jiu Lingyun\u2019s potential as he never accompany Jiu Lingyun in training, how far can she go?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She can\u2019t embarrass Yi Tianyun who has helped her this much. She has been working real hard to repay his favor.Then, she proceeded to the venue for the assessment. Yi Tianyun looked at her back and nodded lightly.The test is conducted with several disciples undertake the test at once, some other disciples are still waiting outside.\u201cAfter one or two wave at most she will fall down, to become an official disciple one needs to withstand up to the ninth wave, seem like a long way for her hahahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019ll be accepted as official disiple anyway since she\u2019s close to Elder Yi, we\u2019ll see!\u201d\u201cYes, should we talk our way to Elder Yi as well?\u201d\u201cForget it, I will rely on my own skills to join Jade Palace!\u201dThey thought this is some kind of cinderella story, they thought just because Jiu Lingyun is close to Yi Tianyun she\u2019ll get special treatment and her life here in Jade Palace will be like cinderella meeting a prince on a castle.Soon the assessment began, after the signal from Deacon Liang, the spiritual waves are blasted off toward the disciples one after another. No disciples fell down in the first wave, well being knocked out in the first wave is just way too shameful.Following the second wave, same as first wave no one fell down, including Jiu Lingyun.Nothing particular happened untill fourth wave, many outer disciples began to fall, and Jiu Lingyun is still \u00a0standing firm!Following the fifth and sixth wave even more disciples fell down, she is still standing, this shocked everyone especially those who already fell and those who mocked her, how can Jiu Lingyun be this strong even though she\u2019s from the slum?After seventh and eigth wave, Jiu Lingyun still persisted.And now Jiu Lingyun is already at the ninth wave, which is the standard of official disciple!\u201cShe definitely won\u2019t get through ninth wave!\u201dBut of course once again they\u2019re wrong!Jiu Lingyun easily cleared ninth wave, and there are only three other disciples remained who managed to stand their ground! This means that she passed the assessment and became one of the four. But the assessment is still in progress.Those who mocked her can\u2019t say anyhthing anymore, they thought her appearance is the standard of her skill, they couldn\u2019t be more wrong!But this has yet come to an end. After the end of the ninth wave, the tenth wave began, and she still persisted like a big tree in the face of incoming storm. By the eleventh wave, she\u2019s the only one remaining disciple!It goes without saying that the overall level of outer disciple is not high, that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard become official and inner disciple because their spiritual power is not that high to begin with, so it\u2019s up to them to train real hard for the assesment like this.\u201cNot bad!\u201d Yi Tianyun is impressed.The audience, and other outer disciple was stunned by her strength. After getting back on their feet, they looked at Jiu Lingyun still standing firm, and they can\u2019t believe their eyes.Is this the strength of someone who merely rely on relationships to climb the rank? Of course not, her strength is the real deal!Reaching eleventh wave is no small feat, the chattering in the audiences seat is gone, that\u2019s to be expected, they can\u2019t question her strength now that she got this far.But it\u2019s not over yet. Jiu Lingyun is near her limit but she still persisted. However, at twelfth wave she finally fell down.Withstand eleven waves!This impressive results silence the audiences. She did not create a new record, but she proved her own strength and absolutely crushed others!\u201cAfter seeing this if there\u2019s still anyone mocking her, maybe their eyes are blind\u201d Yi Tianyun said, and the result was quite surprising, even for Yi Tianyun He didn\u2019t expect Jiu Lingyun\u2019s soul is this strong.Her soul is definitely strong although the difference with her cultivation is quite far. But too many people only focuses on cultivation. Jiu Lingyun\u2019s cultivation base is only the Third Body Refinement, but that does not necessarily mean that her spiritual power level is low.It\u2019s a fact that he joined Jade Palace by Yi Tianyun\u2019s recommendation. It seems unfair. But that doesn\u2019t mean she has no strength to back her up, with the strength she possesed it\u2019s actually a good thing Yi Tianyun recommended her in Jade Palace!Basically as long as they have enough skill, it doesn\u2019t matter if they join Jade Palace with recommendation, it would be profitable in long run for Jade Palace anyway.\u201cYeah, who said that she is weak and seduce elder Yi to climb her way? She is really talented!\u201d\u201cShe is definitely talented\u201d\u201cIs she really from the slums? I don\u2019t think someone from slums is this strong\u201dThe booing turned into cheering now that Jiu Lingyun is qualified to become inner disciple.At this time, Jiu Lingyun already left the field, she quickly rushed and jump into Yi Tianyun\u2019s arms without thinking. She cried: \u201cBig Brother Yi, I did it, I did it!\u201dShe cried, releasing all her emotion she held in. She didn\u2019t let Yi Tianyun down, she even become the best out of the disciples taking the assesment!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI knew you can do it if you try\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun reached out and patted her back. He could relate to this, when everyone underestimated him, he managed to grasp victory and prove they\u2019re wrong!When she realized she was in Yi Tianyun\u2019s arm, she blushed and she gets flustered .Yi Tianyun didn\u2019t mind, she patted her in the head, said with a smile: \u201cCongratulations on joining Jade Palace, this time you officially become one of us with your own strength.\u201dJiu Lingyun nodded and said: \u201cBig Brother Yi, thank you!\u201d\u201cNo need to thank me, this is the result of your own efforts.\u201d Yi Tianyun said with a smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now she can directly join the inner disciple and she\u2019s the only one capable to join inner disciple in this assessment. Everyone that talking shit about her earlier has their face looking down the ground. They\u2019re clearly embarrassed for harassing her, and cannot perform as good as her.This performance prove it to everyone that she didn\u2019t join Jade Palace because of her relation with Yi Tianyun, but she join Jade Palace by her own strength.Yi Tianyun is just as surprised everyone else. He didn\u2019t expect Jiu Lingyun to enter Inner Disciple so easily.[Hidden Quest Completed: Saintess Initial Training][Reward: 50.000 Exp, 50 Jiu Lingyun\u2019s Favorability, 30 Prestige]System notification suddenly appeared, startled Yi Tianyun a little bit. He reads the notification and become confused. He doesn\u2019t know anything about a Saintess, let alone a quest about training one.\u201cIs Jiu Lingyun a Saintess?\u201dYi Tianyun looks at Jiu Lingyun and straightforwardly ask, \u201cLingyun, are you a Saintess?\u201d\u201cHa? What is a Saintess?\u201d Jiu Lingyun is confused by Yi Tianyun questions, she doesn\u2019t understand his question.\u201cMay I know about your parents?\u201d Yi Tianyun asked.\u201cI have never known my parents my entire life, I live with my little brother in the slum ever since i was little and that\u2019s all I know.\u201d Jiu Lingyun talk about her past a little bit with still a little confusion in her face, but she doesn\u2019t express any sadness, or anger, like she doesn\u2019t really care for having a parent or not.\u201cThen your little brother\u2026 is he not your biological brother?\u201d Yi Tianyun asked.\u201cMy little brother is not my biological brother, yes. How do you know that he is not my biological younger brother?\u201d Jiu Lingyun wondered.\u201cJust a guess, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Yi Tianyun tried not to pry any further, and stop asking her question, but he has a theory in his mind.So, Jiu Lingyun may be a Saintess but which sect would abandon a Saintess? from the looks of things, Jiu Lingyun innate ability has developed already, she didn\u2019t break a new record in this assesment, but judging from her cultivation, her progress is definitely off the chart.For a start this assessment need the disciple that wanted to participate to be at least a Ninth Level Body Refinement or above. Which mean that Jiu Lingyun is already at this level, and she arrived at Jade Palace just recently. So she just started her cultivation recently too. It\u2019s amazing that she already reach this level.\u201cYou could\u2019ve entered the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, if your cultivation is a bit higher.\u201d Yi Tianyun becomes very interested, if he can help Jiu Lingyun to cultivate faster, there is no doubt that she can become a Saintess. If he got this as a quest, amazing rewards are waiting for him, he\u2019s sure of it.This is certainly a special kind of Quest!\u201cNo, I am very happy just to join Jade Palace. I just become a disciple recently, If I took my chance to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins surely there will be more rumors spreading around.\u201d Jiu Lingyun shook her head and she surely felt that it\u2019s not her place to participate in this Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, even if she qualified in terms of cultivation level, she would probably still reject the offer, she doesn\u2019t want to trouble Yi Tianyun.\u201cThis is not the place to be humble, your innate ability is very good. You have already proved yourself, but your cultivation isn\u2019t there yet. Don\u2019t worry, there are plenty of opportunities in the future for you to enter the ruins, keep working hard in cultivation and make me proud.\u201d Yi Tianyun smiled at Jiu Lingyun. He has to help Jiu Lingyun cultivate, he got excited by the title Saintess!The system definitely will not deceive him, this is definitely a Hidden Quest!After explaining a few things to Jiu Lingyun, he let her tend to other things she needs. Obviously she needs to clear some formal stuff first, for her to formally become an inner disciple.Not long after, the time to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is finally here. Jade Palace already selected and organizes eight excellent disciple to enter, and Qin Xue, the on who accompanied Yi Tianyun to Wind City is also among them.\u201cHeavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is about to open?\u201d Yi Tianyun asked Shi Xueyun at the palace.\u201cYes, this time you will accompany the participants with Great Elder in charge. This time I don\u2019t have to go, I\u2019ll stay here in Jade Palace.\u201d Shi Xueyun said.If Yi Tianyun and Shi Xueyun leave at the same time, the palace would be very vulnerable, it will be troublesome if by some chance Wing Sect choose to attack at that time. Jade Palace also need to accompany their participant for entering the ruins. It would be not good, if the participant got ambushed by some greedy group of people that wants to enter too.\u201cNo problem, but in case Wing Sect is coming to attack, be careful.\u201d Yi Tianyun worried.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if it comes to it, we will rely on supreme elder, they will have no problem Wing sect. We still got some trick up our sleeve.\u201d Shi Xueyun tries to ease Yi Tianyun\u2019s worry.Yi Tianyun is a little relieved. He really settle this with Wing Sect and just eradicate all of them, so they couldn\u2019t lay a hand to Jade Palace any longer, but it would be difficult and time consuming, because Wing Sect\u2019s territory is so far from here, and entering their territory won\u2019t so easy too.Yi Tianyun\u2019s cultivation is pretty high, but it doesn\u2019t mean that he can get in and out of enemy territory so easily. Sure he can get exp along the way, but it won\u2019t be enough, because their territory only has ordinary demon beast, meaning that the beast itself would not drop a good amount of exp for him.\u201cWell, if there is any problem arise, you have to let me know immediately!\u201d Yi Tianyun voices his concern \u201cWhoever dare to lay a hand on you, will never live to see the next day!\u201d\u201cWhat do you expect, they surely would come in any given opportunity, there is no way those old man will keep their heads down.\u201d Shi Xueyun talk with a light smiles \u201cYou should go already, we don\u2019t want to be late on this important day. Don\u2019t worry about me now.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll go now, too bad I can\u2019t go in, haha. .\u201d Yi Tianyun says with a little laughter.\u201cYour cultivation is already too high to enter. There is nothing you could do about it.\u201d Shi Xueyun looks at Yi Tianyun and say \u201cDon\u2019t be disappointed about the ruins, there is no special things inside anyway.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know that the thing Yi Tianyun really worried about is his own Main Quest.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll go now, aunt. See you later.\u201dWhen he reach the palace gate, the elder already waiting on him. the second elder is there too, looking proud at her proud disciple, because of the increased amount of quota, she can finally rest easy now that she can grant her disciple the opportunity to enter the ruins.With nothing else to talk about, they got into their designated carrier and made their way to the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter a few days on the road, they finally got close to the ruins entrance. Yi Tianyun can see the mountain range is very long in line, as far as the eyes can see. In the side of the mountain, he can see there is already many carriages bringing people from another sect already arrived, and they all gathered together in small group, they seems to be in deep of discussion.As Yi Tianyun and his group got closer, he can see the majestic gate of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins. This Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins was built in to the mountain range. The gate itself placed in the middle of mountain range. The structure itself seems like very ancient, and Yi Tianyun can feel a very powerful aura comes from inside the gate.The vibe he got from the powerful aura emanated from the ruins is like that of ancient dragons, old and very powerful, almost primordial. He reaches his conclusion that the ruin is already been there for a long time. This ruins itself has a special way of entry, beside it requited a certain level of cultivation, it also needs a special token to enter. The token has a fixed amount every time the gate is open, and that is also the reason behind the quota that each faction competes against.Because without this token, ones couldn\u2019t enter the ruins even if they have the required cultivations.\u201cThis is Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins? Now how can i get in?\u201d Yi Tianyun wondered, he never gave up on the idea to finish his main quest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - GoingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77:\u00a0GoingWhen Yi Tianyun got off the carriage, he saw a few figures who just came.They\u2019re all influential individual, but they\u2019re from Second Level Faction, Third Level Faction or above won\u2019t participate because this is not beneficial for them. They don\u2019t see this as something extraordinary as they have better alternatives.For Second Level Faction, this is very tempting.Their arrival immediately become the center of attention. Jade Palace, the faction capable of driving away three great faction invading them. The factions\u2019 representative around Yi Tianyun react differently regarding their arrival, some of them is shocked, some of them is amazed.Jade Palace is only First Level Faction, but they can do such a feat, did their secluded elder help them?What they don\u2019t know is the one that drive these three factions and kill their sect leader is none other than Yi Tianyun. That\u2019s to be expected since Shi Xueyun kept this information a secret. The one who knows about it is only several people from Jade Palace, so none of these second level faction knows Yi Tianyun\u2019s strength.Being low profile is much better in this situation, so they don\u2019t know anything about Yi Tianyun. After the news about Jade Palace\u2019s victory was spread, these factions respected Jade Palace a little bit, at the very least they recognized their true strength now.Which is why other factions is reluctant to intervene. And after their loss Wing Sect won\u2019t attack in the near future as they knew how strong Yi Tianyun is.\u201cBasically only Second Level Faction is here, there\u2019s no First Level Faction\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun glanced at the number, the number is quite a number of them, and the amount of quota each faction is determined by the influence of sect. The greater the influence, the more quota they get.Therefore, the number of people combined has at least 30 \u2013 40 people, so it\u2019s quite crowded there. However, Jade Palace has eight quota, this is definitely an advantage for them. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say Jade Palace is the most influential sect here even though they\u2019re only First Level Faction.Judging from cultivation, most of them are around the Fifth Level of Spirit Refinement, and the higher ones reach 8th Level of Spirit Refinement. None of them is at Ninth level or above, maybe they purposely wait for Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins to open to breakthrough.Gaining experience in Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins before breaking through to Core Condensation Stage is very ideal. The most important thing is that they happen to meet this Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, then come over to Smelting Trial.\u201cOur Jade Palace IS a special case, most of the time only Second Level Faction is eligible to come here.\u201d Great Elder explained next: \u201cWe are First Level Faction, but in terms of strength we already exceeded the average Second Level Faction. It\u2019s only because our total disciple is not that much, otherwise we would\u2019ve become Second Level Faction.\u201dYi Tianyun nodded, Jade Palace is a special case because it only accepts female cultivators that\u2019s the reason they don\u2019t have that many disciple.\u201cPalace Lord Shi isn\u2019t coming this time?\u201d somebody asked, it was Sect Master Huan. When he couldn\u2019t find Shi Xueyun among the crowds, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh in his heart. He\u2019s a good looking man and from the looks of it his cultivation is not to be underestimated.\u201cTurns out that Palace Lord Shi has something to do, so she can\u2019t come here. I am the one in charge this time.\u201d Great elder said, because Shi Xueyun did entrust things to her.\u201cI heard the three great factions attacked the Jade Palace, but ended up with a huge loss. Your Old Ancestor is really something else!\u201d Sect Master Huan said.\u201cWell, our Old Ancestor is definitely a force to be reckoned with.\u201d Great Elder said with a light smile: \u201cEven if Jade Palace only First Level Faction, but the foundation is unwavered.\u201dShe purposely said that Jade Palace\u2019s elder is invincible out loud so everyone here thought Jade Palace is really strong if they got serious. And it really piqued everyone\u2019s interest.\u201cSeems like those three factions is really out of luck when they made enemies out of Jade Palace.\u201d Sect Master Huan smiled trying to break the ice.But seems like their little talk have to end here because Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is about to open.\u201cBang!\u201dSuddenly the entire mountain range is shaking like there\u2019s an earthquake. Even though they want to talk a bit longer, seems like this is no time for a small talk.The door slowly opened, showing everyone an enormous power from from within leaving them speechless.\u201cThe door is almost opened!\u201dEveryone packed themselves in front of the gate, the moment the gate is open everyone will instantly rush inside.There\u2019s a certain time for Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins to open, in July once every three years. If you miss it, you have to wait for another three years, that\u2019s why everyone is already here before it opened.Looking at the scene in front of him, Yi Tianyun is vexed. He couldn\u2019t enter just because his cultivation is too high!When the door is fully open, a bright light is covering their eyes.\u201cGO!\u201dSomeone immediately rushed inside with a token, and he went through the layer of light serving as the entrance inside.Jade Palace is ready to go in as well.Yi Tianyun suddenly thought of an idea. He immediately said to Great Elder: \u201cCan you give me one of the token, let me try going in?\u201dAs usual Yi Tianyun never listen to other even though he\u2019s the Elder of Jade Palace now.\u201cSeems like you still haven\u2019t given up, here, knock yourself out.\u201d Great Elder handed one of the token to him.Yi Tianyun took it with a smile: \u201cThank you, I will give it a try then.\u201dImmediately after he took the token, he walked through the entrance. Great Elder thought he wouldn\u2019t be able to enter, but turns out he walked in just fine!\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Great Elder is shocked after seeing Yi Tianyun go through the multiple layer of light.Yi Tianyun\u2019s cultivation didn\u2019t fit the requirement, how is it possible?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euImmediately, Great Elder stretched his hand through the entrance, but even his hand can\u2019t go through.\u201cStrange, the restrictions work just fine\u2026\u201d Great Elder frowns, immediately said to the disciples on the side: \u201cGive me your token, let me try.\u201dThe discipline immediately handed the token to her.After the Great Elder took it, she tried to get in once again but still no luck!\u201cWeird\u2026\u201d Great Elder was shocked.

    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - Fault FindingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78: Fault\u00a0FindingGreat elder was flinched upon seeing this scene, she even tried to go in and failed, but Yi Tianyun just leisurely walked in without any difficulties.\u201cWhat? What\u2019s going on? This is so strange!\u201d Great Elder wonders with shock all over her face.\u201cElder Yu, don\u2019t you know, that you can\u2019t go in with your level of cultivation?\u201d Sect Master Huan looks at great elder, clearly confused. Other people that saw the great elder\u2019s action also looks at him weirdly. Clearly they thought that the great elder also tries to get in, as if she doesn\u2019t know about the rule of the ruin.Many people thinks that Great Elder Yu, has somewhat forgotten about the rules, but that\u2019s just not possible.\u201cDon\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m just experimenting on some theory.\u201dGreat Elder is still confused, but she tries to hide it, she doesn\u2019t want to say anything about Yi Tianyun\u2019s circumstance. She doesn\u2019t want to make a fuzz about it. It\u2019s clearly a good thing for Jade Palace, but it would be kind of unfair for other faction. But in reality, it doesn\u2019t matter even if Yi Tianyun enter the ruins, because in Great Elder Yu\u2019s mind, Yi Tianyun\u2019s cultivation is already too high, there is not much he can do in there.After she collected herself, she glanced at the other disciple and says \u201cYou all should go in, follow Yi Tianyun, understand?\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dThey all walked in one by one, a little shocked too, because they saw it as well. As a core disciple they already know about how high Yi Tianyun\u2019s cultivation was. So they\u2019re a little bit excited as well, with Yi Tianyun\u2019s help inside, surely would be an advantage for them, and no one will mess with them.One disciple who gave her token to Yi Tianyun feels a little bit discouraged. She missed her chance to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins.Great elder Yu saw her and said \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, the palace would compensate you for this when we got back.\u201d Great Elder reached out and patted her shoulder, consoling her.The disciple nodded, clearly understanding that even if she didn\u2019t get compensation she probably couldn\u2019t say anything about it, because it\u2019s not her rights to begin with. In her mind Yi Tianyun deserves this chance more than her, he repelled three great factions by himself.Inside Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins.When Yi Tianyun successfully enter the ruins, he got confused himself. What is going on?\u201cIs this a bug? Or my main quest makes it possible override the rules?\u201d Yi Tianyun wonders, he thinks that, this two reasons is probably the only reason why he could enter the ruins.After all, Main Quest is as the name suggest, a very important quest. There is no way he couldn\u2019t enter to finish it.No matter what the reason is, now that he\u2019s already inside, all he needs to do is finish his quest.\u201cGreat, now I can finish my main quest!\u201d Yi Tianyun becomes excited for the prospect of finishing his main quest.[Main Quest: Occupy Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins][Reward: 100.000 Exp, 10.000 Crazy Point, Sword of Endlessness (Holy Tool), Control of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins]The reward he could get by finishing this quest is really tempting, especially the weapon and the right to control Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins. Exp and the crazy point doesn\u2019t really matter at this point.After regaining composure. He shifted his attention to his surroundings, and began to observe the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins.Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is, as its name suggests, a place with such heavy atmosphere like the ceiling is about to fall down on his head. There is a high pressure that comes from above ready to crush him. The surrounding buildings around him have dense cracks on them, and several stone columns already collapsed. It\u2019s clear that this place has already corroded by time. No matter how powerful one\u2019s ability is, clearly no one could stop the interference of time.From the looks of things in here, he\u2019s pretty sure there is no treasure that worth spending time finding it. The ruins have a pillaged looks written on them.A long time ago, this Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins does have many treasures, but as time passes, surely people who came here have found the treasure and took it for themselves one by one. But from the beginning his Yi Tianyun\u2019s objective here is not to find a treasure.The spiritual power in this place is clearly concentrated, at least several times stronger than the outside. It\u2019s no wonder that this place becomes a perfect place for cultivation. The place must have some kind of mechanism to concentrate the spiritual power in this place.\u201cThis place has a very strong spiritual power compared to outside. One day of cultivation here is equal to one week of cultivation outside.\u201d Yi Tianyun nodded excitedly, he wonders the creator of this place surely would be very powerful to be able to create this kind of mechanism as well.\u201cElder Yi, how can you come in?\u201d Qin Xue asked Yi Tianyun as she enters the ruins, in fact, the other disciple comes in one by one, and after they saw Yi Tianyun, they couldn\u2019t help but looked at him weirdly.Yi Tianyun shrugged his shoulders and say \u201cI don\u2019t know how myself, I just tried to walk in and here I am\u201dHe didn\u2019t say the real reason, and decided to make this look like a big coincidence.\u201cYou are Yi Tianyun?\u201d A man suddenly comes in and looks at Yi Tianyun curiously.\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are talking about?\u201d Yi Tianyun also gave him a look. His cultivation is already very strong compared to other disciples, he already at the peak of Spirit Refinement realm. It\u2019s clear that with this kind of level, he should already be a deacon in his sect. it was not fair for him to also enter the ruins, but that is also applies to himself, so he choose to not spoke his mind.Looking at his outfit, he should be from the same sect as Sect Master Huan, which is Magnificent Sect.\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve seen you somewhere.\u201d Liang Feng observed Yi Tianyun a little bit more and was intrigued the moment he saw Yi Tianyun\u2019s chin.\u201cI knew it, you\u2019re Yi Tianyun. I saw you from afar but i\u2019m not sure. After closer looks there is no doubt that you\u2019re Yi Tianyun. That guy from the wanted list!\u201d There comes another cultivator that recognizes Yi Tianyun. This time a Ninth Level Spirit Refinement cultivator came over and he is Yong Cheng from Approaching Sect.No wonder they recognized him immediately. They\u2019ve seen Yi Tianyun\u2019s wanted list with a great reward that comes with it. But after Wind Pavilion suffered defeat, who will give the reward in their place? So that wanted poster is basically irrelevant now.The Chief Pavilion Lord of Wind Pavilion is already killed too.\u201cEven if I am, what do you want?\u201d Yi Tianyun looked at them disinterested.\u201cI\u2019m just curious that\u2019s all. I just heard that you are very powerful. You made a big uproar in Wind Pavilion by killing Liang Tiancheng. It caused a lot of trouble, but it seems that finally Jade Palace helped you solve it.\u201d Liang Feng shook his head and returns his gaze to Yi Tianyun smirking \u201cYou should rely on your own strength next time, stop standing behind a bunch of women to save your ass.\u201dLiang Feng has always looked down on Yi Tianyun with disgust, he had a good relationship with Wind Pavilion\u2019s Liang Tiancheng. He didn\u2019t expect Yi Tianyun could kill Liang Tiancheng, he would\u2019ve slain Yi Tianyun right there if he Jade Palace\u2019s disciple is not around.After Liang Feng harsh words at Yi Tianyun, Qin Xue can\u2019t help but getting angry in Yi Tianyun\u2019s place\u201cWhat are you talking about? Yi Tianyun is already\u2026 He didn\u2019t rely on women to solve his problems, stop talking nonsense! And Liang Tiancheng is dead because none other than his own stupidity, not only he is stupid, but also a disgusting pig as well!\u201d Qin Xue almost revealed Yi Tianyun\u2019s status. If people know that Yi Tianyun have become an elder in Jade Palace, things will get even more complicated.With his favorability on Jade Palace\u2019s disciple is reasonably high, if someone badmouth him they would stand up for him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHey, you just let the woman spoke up for you, are you okay with that? you can\u2019t even speak for yourself? \u00a0Liang Feng speak to Yi Tianyun with disdain, trying to provoke him even more.It\u2019s not that Yi Tianyun doesn\u2019t want to respond to him, but more like he doesn\u2019t care about him.In his opinion, Liang Feng is like a monkey, jumping around trying to get his attention. He clearly doesn\u2019t want to dirty his hands by stooping into Liang Feng\u2019s level. He just wants to explore this ruins and clear his main quest to begin with, so if he could, he wanted to finish it fast, and to do that he wants to avoid any kind of trouble, and especially not the trouble from this idiot.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in you that\u2019s all\u201d Yi Tianyun didn\u2019t even look at Liang Feng as he speaks and continue to walk inside.Hearing Yi Tianyun\u2019s statement Liang Feng is so humiliated, he didn\u2019t expect Yi Tianyun to not take his bait, Yi Tianyun doesn\u2019t even bat an eye for him. He looks at Yi Tianyun with a killing intent, but he doesn\u2019t want to confront Yi Tianyun with Jade palace all over him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now you shrug it off by saying not interested? Coward!\u201d Liang Feng said coldly.\u201cThe coward here is none other than you!\u201d Qin Xue shouted at him: \u201cStop talking like you know what happened in Wind Pavilion!\u201d\u201cYeah, how dare you say our Elder is a coward, to begin with those scoundrels from Wind Building are the one who brought about their own destruction!\u201dThe other discipline is also glaring at Liang Feng. He\u2019s way out of the line, they wouldn\u2019t mind to fight here and now.\u201cShut the fuck up!\u201d Liang Feng yelled at them, at the same time unleash a powerful aura and that flinched them. \u201cI\u2019m asking him, not you! If you really are as strong as the rumors say. I challenge you to a duel for life and death.\u201dHe can\u2019t afford to attack him carelessly because Jade Palace is really a force to be reckoned with , but he wanted to avenge Liang Tiancheng, so he challenged him to a duel so other disciple won\u2019t be able to help Yi Tianyun.Yi Tianyun frowns, even though Liang Feng sincerely he asked for it, he doesn\u2019t have time for this.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me earlier? I said not interested.\u201d Yi Tianyun didn\u2019t want to pay attention to him, he turned and wanted to leave.\u201cJust admit it already! You are a coward! Everything is just a rumor. You single handedly slaughtered the entire Wind Pavilion? What happened is Jade Palace come to help you, probably something like that. You are nothing, you simply hide behind the women from Jade Palace. Coward, spineless bastard! At least the other rumor is correct. You have been relying on Shi Xueyun\u2019s influence as a Palace Lord to remain in Jade Palace, that must be reason you can come here as well! Even though you\u2019re powerless at least you have someone backing you up, if it\u2019s me i could\u2019ve died from embarrassment!\u201d Liang Feng is so furious, he constantly provokes Yi Tianyun.The other sects just watch from distance. This piqued their interest. They wanted to see how Yi Tianyun responds. Liang Feng\u2019s cultivation is considerably high. He\u2019s ranked in top three in his sect.\u201cOk then, i\u2019ll take your bait on purpose for your sake as well. You want a life or death duel? Then let\u2019s do it!\u201d Yi Tianyun coldly said.After all these insults from him, if he doesn\u2019t fight, everyone will think he really is a coward.\u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s gotta be! Then without further ado\u201d Liang Feng was ecstatic, and quickly pulled out the sword. Killing intent filled his eyes: \u201cThe battle of life and death, one on one, without any interference\u2026 die!\u201dHe rushed toward Yi Tianyun with his sword ready to pierce through. Yi Tianyun didn\u2019t expect the moment he just came in, he\u2019s already in a life and death duel.\u201cDie!\u201d Yi Tianyun\u2019s eyes were cold, he buried his feet to build momentum and wait for Liang Feng to get closer, when Liang Feng is within his attack range he released his foot and kick him on the face. it\u2019s a really fast kick, like a lightning, Liang Feng couldn\u2019t even see it.\u201cBang!\u201dLiang Feng was smashed into the wall, shaking the wall, and thick dust fell on him, ant that\u2019s the end of it, just one kick.[Killed Liang Fend. Obtains 9000 Exp, Jade Heaven Sword, 900 Crazy Point.]Everyone else looked at Liang Feng lying down on the ground, and a disciple of Magnificent Sect quickly checked his condition. After checking Liang Feng he exclaimed: \u201cDead, he\u2019s dead\u2026 Senior Brother Liang Feng is dead!\u201dEveryone else was stunned, because they barely saw the kick too, and he\u2019s dead with just one kick too! Liang Feng\u2019s cultivation is quite strong, he\u2019s at the Peak of Spirit Refinement, but he\u2019s dead from one kick!\u201cYou\u2026 you actually killed Senior Brother Liang Feng, our Sect Master will not let you get away with this!\u201d The disciples of Magnificent Sect glared at Yi Tianyun.\u201cYou heard what he said right? He said it\u2019s a duel of life and death. You\u2019re gonna blame me for that?\u201dYi Tianyun gave them a cold look : \u201cIf you want to challenge me, or insult Jade Palace, I don\u2019t mind doing a life and death duel with you!\u201dAfter saying this, Yi Tianyun turned and keep walking, he said to Qin Xue: \u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019re just wasting our time here.\u201dQin Xue follow him with her eyes sparkling, this is Yi Tianyun\u2019s Power, the strength of their Elder!There are time limits to stay in Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruin. The gate will be closed if the time limit is up. And it will take three years before it opened again.Everyone else just stare at each other without saying anything. Is this Yi Tianyun\u2019s real strength?Who said that Yi Tianyun is a coward, or a weakling that rely on Jade Palace? Just how strong is he to be capable of killing a Peak of Spirit Refinement cultivator with one kick ? is he at Core Condensation?They\u2019re confused because cultivators within Core Condensation or above can\u2019t enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins. But it\u2019s just not possible to kill Liang Feng with one kick if Yi Tianyun is only at Peak of Spirit Refinement? This confused them all, but at the very least they know one thing, that Yi Tianyun is not a weakling who\u2019s hiding behind a woman\u2026When he\u2019s about to leave, Qin Xue immediately said: \u201cElder Yi, where are you going?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do i guess i\u2019ll walk around,\u201d Yi Tianyun said.\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to say that there\u2019s nothing here except for the previous Smelting Trial Stone Tablet, all the treasure is already taken.\u201d Qin Xue said with a sorry tone.Yi Tianyun knew there is nothing here. He just wanted to confirm if there was anything out of ordinary here. After all, his objective is to complete his main quest.\u201cI know, but let\u2019s just take a look around first.\u201dYi Tianyun proceeded further followed by Jade Palace\u2019s disciples. Further inside, he saw a huge Stone Tablet standing in the center, with a faint luster enveloping it. And someone was meditating next to it, shrouded in a light similar to the Stone Tablet, as if he\u2019s at the verge of grasping something improtant.This is what they call the Smelting Trial Stone Tablet. One of the reasons people coming here is to learn martial art through meditation here.They begin their meditation here, through Smelting Trial Stone Tablet they can learn a new Martial Art, according to their level of cultivation varies from Human Level Martial Arts to Earth Level Martial Arts!Learning earth level Martial Arts here is equal to obtain a treasyre. Because second level faction didn\u2019t have that many earth level martial arts to begin with. Imagine how much you can contribute to your faction if you learn earth level martial arts here.\u201cGo ahead and meditate, i\u2019ll take a look around first\u201d Yi Tianyun said toward the disciples of Jade Palace.They nodded and immediately sit down near the Smelting Trial Stone Tablet and meditated. While meditating, Smelting Trial Stone Tablet grant them protection from any damage.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cEarth level martial arts\u2026 perhaps it won\u2019t be completely useless, i can use it to increase mastery at the very least.\u201d Yi Tianyun faintly smiled, he decided to meditate later on and take a look around first.When he was wandering through the ruin, the Magnificent Sect disciple, who followed him, looked at Yi Tianyun in horror, and they even avoided eye contact. If Yi Tianyun decided to make a move here, there\u2019s no doubt all of them will end up dead.But, even though they\u2019re afraid of him, they can\u2019t waste this opportunity, it\u2019s once every three years Smelting Trial.Yi Tianyun just glanced at them and went to other places. As long as they didn\u2019t provoke him, he won\u2019t cause any trouble. Although he can level up by killing them, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll kill anyone he saw, he\u2019s not a demon.This is how Yi Tianyun is, as long as they don\u2019t poke their nose where it doesn\u2019t belong, Yi Tianyun won\u2019t do anything to them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - ExplainingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80: ExplainingAfter Yi Tianyun going on full circle around the room, he didn\u2019t find anything. It just as Qin Xue says, \u201cThere is nothing on the ruins beside the smelting trial stone tablet in the middle of the ruins.\u201dIt\u2019s pretty much a waste of time to look around, he thought to himself.He proceed to return to the Smelting Trial Stone Tablet, when he reaches the hall, he sees a beam of light coming from the sky, along with a spark of light that falls into the hand of the disciples.With much enthusiasm the disciple reached out his hands and quickly grasp the spark of light that come down ever so slowly. When the disciple received it and checked what it was, he shows a little bit of disappointment \u201cMiddle human level martial arts?\u201d He shows his disappointment a little bit more with a sadness in his eyes.A middle human level martial arts is actually a very good level of martial arts, but their objective in this ruins is to get their hands on an earth level martial arts, if they don\u2019t, it goes without saying that they would be a little bit disappointed.The disciple look up and notice that Yi Tianyun is looking at him, and frantically tries to hide the martial arts that he just got. After finishing the meditation the beam of light is slowly fading away which means he\u2019s no longer protected from damage and susceptible from getting robbed or attacked inside the ruins.There are many of the disciples of a great factions use this kind of advantage they have for getting a better martial arts than the one they got for them self. Their victims can only bite their nails as they can\u2019t do anything and coming back empty-handed because Smelting Trial Stone Tablet only grant them martial arts once per entry.This fact can be proved by the existence of the token, the token will lose its energy when it is used as a key. The energy would regenerate over time, and would take one or two years for it to replenish its energy.The token is the only thing that preventing everyone to abuse Heaven Immersing Ancient Ruins power. There can only one person for one token in any opening day of the ruins, you can\u2019t enter and exit the ruins anytime you like.Its either you take the chance to get a martial arts and start cultivating those martial arts here, or tries to cultivate your base cultivation. The concentration of spiritual power in here is making it a one time opportunity to improve cultivation level as fast as possible.Yi Tianyun stops looking at the disciple and walks to find his own place to meditate. Once he began meditating, the disciple breath a sigh of relief, for he knows that Yi Tianyun doesn\u2019t seem to be interested on him.After starting his meditation, Yi Tianyun was immediately covered by a beam of light. He felt that his consciousness is being drawn into the Smelting Trial Stone Tablet!After a while, he entered an illusion realm surrounded by stone tablets, the floor around the stone tablets itself is yellowish colored sand. The yellow sand is very suspicious looking for him. when he took a look at the stone tablets, he noticed that each tablet has different content from each other.\u201cTransforming Heaven Palm\u2026\u201d\u201cHeaven Cloud Palm\u2026\u201d\u201cFantasy Light Palm\u2026\u201dThe stone tablet only provides the name of martial arts, there is no explanation about what kind of martial art it is. There is nothing to indicate what the martial arts is about, there is no way anybody could guess what the martial arts\u2019 level is, or what effect it would have.Would he leave everything to luck and randomly picked one of the martial art in front of him? He understands that he he only has one chance.After a quick stroll around the tablets, Yi Tianyun notices that he couldn\u2019t find any earth level martial arts that he knew. From the looks of it once a martial arts is granted to someone, it completely disappeared from this realmHowever, Yi Tianyun doesn\u2019t think of it too much, he reminded himself about his main quest. He understands that there\u2019s nothing else other than the smelting trials stone tablet in the middle, seems to be relevant to finish his quest. There must be something inside here to finish his quest.\u201cWhat do I do to finish this quest now?\u201dYi Tianyun frowned while thinking for a solution. After circling around the tablets, he believes that most of the martial engraved in there is the human level martial arts. It\u2019s not surprising since the expert who create this Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins possess that many human level martial arts.For First Level Faction, human level martial art is considered to be strong and good martial arts, but for a high level faction, human level martial arts will not bring you anywhere.After a while he give up on circling around the tablets. He couldn\u2019t find any clue on what he got to do to finish his quest.\u201cIt seems that there is only one way that I have yet to try.\u201dYi Tianyun steadied his breath and activated the Luck Aura.He really doesn\u2019t know what to do anymore and decide to rely on his luck. With the amount of prestige he has combined with his Luck Aura, if his math is correct, his luck should be 500 times greater than before.He also knows that luck doesn\u2019t work mathematically like that, because luck is so bizarre that he could always fail even if his luck is enhanced to the brink of infinity. There are so many factors that could make the luck insignificant.Even with that fact on mind, he couldn\u2019t help but rely on it in this situation. He couldn\u2019t find other way to progress his quest.After activating his luck aura, he still didn\u2019t touch any of the stone tablets, instead he continues walking around the tablets to see if there\u2019s some kind of change with his extra amount of luck. After some time passes, he still can\u2019t spot any differences at all. The tablets still arranged neatly like it was before he activates his luck aura.\u201cStrange, so it has nothing to do with luck?\u201d Yi Tianyun frowned, \u201cOr is this amount of luck still not enough?\u201dAfter trying many things in here with his lucky aura activated, like running off to the end of his vision only to return here to the tablets area short after. It seems that he can\u2019t go out from this place.When he decide that he needs to choose a stone tablets to end it, he quickly looks for one that he thinks has a nice ring on the name. When he found one, and about to touch it suddenly as it was, he comes to a revelation. Like being shocked, he quickly pull his hands away from the stone before he even touch it.\u201cSince it\u2019s like a maze in here, it should be nothing wrong to try to solve it like one.\u201d Yi Tianyun stood up, glanced around to all the stone tablets in the room. He quickly envisioned this room with all the stone tablets inside, and soon he realize that one stone tablet, is slightly apart from another one, and that stone tablet is right in front of him.Yi Tianyun became somewhat frustrated from his own revelations, and shouted \u201cSon of a bitch! I completely do something useless this entire time, moreover I wasted many Crazy Point just to find something right on my face this entire time!\u201d He\u2019s so frustrated, he can\u2019t help but swear.\u201cFuck this stupid stone tablet!\u201d He destroys the stone tablets in front of him out of frustrations, completely smashed it to pieces.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter the Stone Tablet was destroyed, his surroundings is changing into another environment. This time it seems like he is in the beach by an island with blue sea and blue sky.\u201cSeems like Luck Aura does have some effect after all, without solving the puzzle of the stone table i wouldn\u2019t be able to come here.\u201d Yi Tianyun shake his head in disbelief, and if by some chance he touched the stone tablet instead of destroying it, he probably would get the martial arts engraved in that stone, but that\u2019s all, he won\u2019t have any other clue leading to his main quest.It seems that it\u2019s really one luck after another.If it was anyone else, surely they will not give in to their inner emotions, and destroys the stone tablets. They surely would touch it and get the martial arts engraved in there, but he surely think that the stone tablet he destroyed contained highest grade martial art in that room, probably would have to be a high tier earth level martial arts.But Yi Tianyun doesn\u2019t want any martial arts to begin with.

However, a path opened in front of him. He followed the path and walked for quite a while until he saw a plain courtyard.He knew this is an illusion, basically there\u2019s nothing else here.Despite being the only thing out of the ordinary in this realm, it\u2019s such a plain courtyard with a small house inside standing in front of Yi Tianyun.But that\u2019s exactly why Yi Tianyun is really cautious here, if this place is somehow luxurious, he can conclude this place\u2019s owner is definitely nothing special.He walked to the front door and knock. \u201cDong Dong Dong\u201d sounded a few times, and it was particularly loud in this quiet courtyard.\u201cCome in.\u201d The low voice came from inside.Yi Tianyun was shocked. He didn\u2019t expect there\u2019s actually someone inside, he knocked the door thinking there wouldn\u2019t be anyone inside.He gently opened the door, and it was a courtyard full of flowers and plants. An old man sat leisurely in the middle of the courtyard.\u201cPleased to meet you!\u201d Yi Tianyun walked in and bow to the old man.An expert capable of creating something as grand as Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is definitely not just an average cultivator, so he Yi Tianyun must show some respect.\u201cNo need to be so formal, I am not the owner here.\u201d The old man smiled and stood up.\u201cYou are not the owner here?\u201d Yi Tianyun is startled, even though he\u2019s living here, he\u2019s not the owner?\u201cYes, this old man is just a keeper of this place, call me Old Xuan. Fated person, please come with me.\u201d Old Xuan signaled him to go inside.Yi Tianyun nodded, and walked into the house with Old Xuan. There was no treasure in the house. Instead, there was a tombstone inside, which clearly read \u201cSpirit King Xuan Tian\u201d. The owner is Spirit King Xuan Tian!\u201cThe owner is a Spirit King!\u201dYi Tianyun is shocked, and Spirit King is a really high cultivation realm, it\u2019s a cultivation realm before Saint King. That\u2019s the highest level of cultivation in this continent. No wonder he can create such a large ancient ruins .\u201cThis is the master\u2019s spiritual position.\u201d Old Xuan sighed.\u201cSpirit King Xuan Tian, he\u2019s already\u2026\u201d Yi Tianyun startled, Spirit King has passed away?\u201cYes, even if he is Spirit King, he still cannot escape from fate.\u201d Old Xuan sighed.Yi Tianyun\u2019s expression is solemn and respectful: \u201cLet me pay my respect, i\u2019ll burn an incense.\u201dOld Xuan waved his hand and an incense appeared in his hand and handed it to Yi Tianyun.Yi Tianyun took the incense and came to the front of this spiritual position. He bowed three times, and paid his respect. Deep in his heart he thought how unfortunate to lose such talented cultivator.After three bows, he took the incense stick and walked over and inserted it on the incense burner.Old Xuan watch Yi Tianyun and nodded with satisfaction, and immediately said: \u201cI see you\u2019re quite well-mannered, and your attitudes\u2026, i\u2019d say you qualified to be the owner\u2019s inheritance disciple!\u201dYi Tianyun startled, all he did is just burn an incense stick, suddenly he qualified to become an inheritance disciple?\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so surprised, qualified means you\u2019re eligible to participate in a test but not just anyone can even qualify.\u201d Old Xuan coldly said: \u201cThey\u2019re polite but they\u2019re not sincere, they had ulterior motives! Untrusted cultivators that simply wanted an inheritance!\u201d\u201cSo there are other people coming here prior to this, but in the end, because of attitude problem, they didn\u2019t get this inheritance?\u201d Yi Tianyun wondered.\u201cNot only they didn\u2019t get the inheritance, I also punished them!\u201d Old Xuan said solemnly: \u201cI\u2019m the keeper of this place, i can tell anyone who\u2019s sincere and respectful to the owner. If that\u2019s not the case, then they\u2019re not qualified!\u201dImmediately, Old Xuan rushed him with a smile: \u201cNo need to worry, i can tell you\u2019re a good person, the master always welcomes people like you to take our test.\u201dYi Tianyun couldn\u2019t help but breathe a sigh of relief, he corrected his attitude the moment he entered this place fortunately, or he could\u2019ve just ended up dying here. Although he doesn\u2019t know what punishment Old Xuan talked about, he\u2019s too afraid to imagine anyway.The soul of people entering this place is connected to the Smelting Trial Stone Tablet, if something happened to the soul here, even if they don\u2019t die, their inner soul will be affected, they could\u2019ve become disabled for life.It seems that sometimes paying attention to etiquette is very important. A lot of cultivators came here thinking they could just waltz in and bring back a treasure, little do they know they\u2019re being tested the moment they enter\u201cA test? May i know what test?\u201d Yi Tianyun asked.\u201cNext is the test of strength, there\u2019s no point to inherit Spirit King\u2019s treasure if you lack strength.\u201d Old Xuan smiled. Despite what he said, he believes Yi Tianyun\u2019s abilities: \u201cThe test is pretty straightforward, defeat the master!\u201d\u201cDefeat the owner?\u201d Yi Tianyun said: \u201cBut Spirit King Xuan Tian is already\u2026 Is it possible to fight him?\u201d\u201cThe one you will fight is not the real master, but the Divine Sense left by the master. You can qualify for inheritance by defeating this Divine Sense!\u201d Old Xuan said solemnly: \u201cIf you fail, I will alter your memory for a little bit, just removing about you memories here and i\u2019ll send your conciousness back.\u201dAlthough Old Xuan welcomed cultivators to earn this inheritance, everything depends on their strength.\u201cNo problem.\u201d Yi Tianyun nodded. He had complete confindence for this, if he can\u2019t do this who else can?Because the limit to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is Spirit Refinement Realm meanwhile he is a Core Condensation. That\u2019s why Yi Tianyun is so confident.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat\u2019s good, are you ready now?\u201d Old Xuan asked.\u201cYes,\u201d said Yi Tianyun.Old Xuan nodded, after waving his hand, the courtyard disappeared, it turned into an arena.Along with a boy who appeared out of nowhere in front of Yi Tianyun!The moment Yi Tianyun lay his eyes on this young boy, he felt as if this boy has seen through him. This young boy in front of him is undoubtedly the Spirit King in his youth. He even used Appraisal eye to make sure. Even if it seems to be the Spirit King in his youth, he is still looks formidable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So the higher your cultivations, master\u2019s cultivation will match yours. If you manage to defeat the master here, you will be qualified to be the successor.\u201dSpirit King Xuan Tian, even in his younger days is not to be underestimated, that\u2019s for sure.\u201cNow I will proceed to assess your cultivation so you can begin the fight immediately.\u201d Old Xuan raised his hand gently, and a ray of light shrouded Yi Tianyun, checking Yi Tianyun\u2019s cultivation.After a while, old Xuan was shocked by the revelations in front of him \u201cCore Condensation cultivation, and at Seventh Level!?\u201dAlthough Old Xuan is only a keeper of this place, the Great Array to control the entrance is still hosted by him, that fact alone would be a sign that this old man has a very good skill in his arsenal. It is well known that the array wouldn\u2019t let anyone higher than spirit refinement cultivations to get through, as he is the one that reinforce that rules.\u201cYes, i\u2019m at Seventh Level Core Condensation. I \u2018m not exactly sure why I can come into the Heaven Immersing Ancient Ruins, I\u2019m just trying my luck and somehow I can get in, but doesn\u2019t this mean I completely break the rules?\u201d Yi Tianyun is feeling a little awkward, he doesn\u2019t want to be disqualified now by Old Xuan because he already too high leveled, but at the same time, he completely understands if Old Xuan decided to disqualify him.\u201cWeird, I clearly limit the cultivators to enter up to Spirit Refinement, but you somehow could enter\u201d Old Xuan becomes a little bit sad from this revelations, maybe he already became too old for this job he thinks. \u201cIt seems that something is wrong to the array, but since you\u2019ve come this far, it would not be fair to just disqualify you. But because your cultivation is so much higher than this version of the master, we need to make a few adjustment to make it fair. There is no way master in this form could win against a Core Condensation cultivator.\u201d\u201cOld Xuan, you don\u2019t have to worry about this problem, I personally don\u2019t think that highly of myself. I would gladly accept any kind of adjustment you have in mind.\u201d Yi Tianyun doesn\u2019t really care that much with the adjustment that he would encounter, as long as he has his crazy system, he\u2019s confident he can pull through anything.\u201cWell then, you have two choices, one is to give up this challenge and you will be back to him outside without the memory of this place and the second is to readjust master\u2019s cultivation. Currently he is in his spirit refinement period, if you still want to proceed, I will readjust his cultivations to that of his core condensation period. But surely I need to remind you that fight would be a lot harder than his form on spirit refinement period.\u201d Old Xuan talks solemnly to Yi Tianyun.This is the will of his master, he can\u2019t make exceptions especially this is a rare case where the challenger is not within the restrictions he set.\u201cNo problem.\u201d Yi Tianyun said with a smile \u201cI would gladly accept that conditions.\u201d\u201cSince you are at Seventh Level Core Condensation, then the master would have the same cultivation level as you are, so he also will be at Seventh Level Core Condensation.\u201d Old Xuan talks to Yi Tianyun while waving his hand. Suddenly a ray of light shrouded Spirit King Xuan Tian.Spirit King Xuan Tian began to change from young boy to a teenager about the same age as Yi Tianyun. His cultivations also increased exponentially. Yi Tianyun saw with the Appraisal Eye as Spirit King Xuan Tian continue to increase from the beginning of the readjustment.10.000, 20.000, 30.000\u2026 the combat power stops when it reaches 50.000.This value is already terrifying. The normal Seventh Level Core Condensation cultivator would have up to 40.000 combat power, and Spirit King Xuan Tian already reached this level of cultivation and battle power at such a young age.Spirit King Xuan Tian (teenager): Seventh Level Core Condensation, combat power is equal to wielding Upper Level Spirit Tool even though he\u2019s just using bare hands, battle power is 50.000!\u201cThis Spirit King Xuan Tian is really strong\u201d Yi Tianyun\u2019s eyes are sparkled with excitement, when appraisal eye has fully analyzed Spirit King Xuan Tian, he can see just how much power the Spirit King Xuan Tian has .However, Yi Tianyun doesn\u2019t feel intimidated by this numbers, Yi Tianyun\u2019s battle power already reached 60.000 with the effect of his power accessories set alone. He\u2019s confident enough that he could win this fight.Even without the effect of Power accesories set, his combat power is already around 50.000, basically the same as Spirit King Xuan Tian. This is of course because of the effect he got from Dragon God Bloodline, he got tremendous physique from it. Because of his enhanced physique he got extra combat power when he strengthened his physique with item such like power suit.With this much extra stuff Yi Tianyun understand how amazing Spirit King Xuan Tian when he was alive.The Power accesories set\u2019s effect is to enhance his power for 100%, that doesn\u2019t mean that his power got doubled, the effect itself only enhance his base power, so everything he equipped, or activated for additional combat power like dragon god bloodline is not multiplied.In the end Power Suit is not a Divine Tool, so it can\u2019t have such heaven defying effect on it.\u201cYou can choose your weapon whether it\u2019s your own or the ones we have here, what do you say?\u201d Old Xuan also add information for Yi Tianyun \u201cOh yeah, the owner does not need any weapon, he will rely only on his fist.\u201d\u201cIf the master is only using his fist, then I should be fair and use only my fist too.\u201d Yi Tianyun decided to use his bare hands as well.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Old Xuan calmly ask \u201cThis is not an easy fight. The owner has strong physique and he is stronger than any average cultivator. I know that you want to show your respect, but it\u2019s not necessary at this point, you should use everthing you have to fight him!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about me. I will stick to my fist.\u201d Yi Tianyun said to old Xuan with a light smile \u201cBelieve it or not i\u2019m pretty confident in my fist.\u201dOld Xuan become silent for a while and then said \u201cWell, as you wish. If you fail, you can\u2019t make any reason and your memory of this place would be gone.\u201d\u201cOf course, I understand.\u201d Yi Tianyun still smilesOld Xuan Sees the determination in Yi Tianyun\u2019s eyes and he couldn\u2019t help but to give some advice in advance. After a while, Old Xuan let Yi Tianyun knows that the challenge would start by shouting, \u201cThe fight starts!\u201dWhen he said it, surely Spirit King Xuan Tian began to move. he started struggling to move at first but after a while Spirit King Xuan Tian rushes at Yi Tianyun with an amazing speed. When he start his rush at Yi Tianyun, Yi Tianyun can feels the ground shakes a little, proving just how immense strength he possesed.Yi Tianyun\u2019s expression was indifferent about this. He keeps smiling to the Spirit King Xuan Tian and as the Spirit King come closer, he raised his hand and catch Spirit King\u2019s fists. Yi Tianyun doesn\u2019t feel any fear at all against such strong adversaries.Old Xuan shook his head at Yi Tianyun. That is not a good idea to receive Spirit King fist head on like that, with his strong physique the Spirit King can break through with an explosive power. He doesn\u2019t even need his martial arts to do that.\u201cBang!\u201dAfter receiving the second punch Yi Tianyun grabbed both of the Spirit King Xuan Tian\u2019s fists and activated his Absorbing Stars Great Technique. The moment he activates his technique, he can feel \u00a0spiritual power surging into his body from his palm. The absorbing stars great technique combined with dark north divine art, greatly absorbs the spiritual power from his opponent.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[1000 exp, 1300 exp, 1200 exp\u2026]In the beginning he just want to check whether this martial art is effective in here.

The amount of experiences he received after that is multiplied 4 to 5 times than before.[4000 exp, 4400 exp, 4800 exp\u2026]The constant exp flows steadily into his body.Spirit King Xuan Tian is struggling to escape Yi Tianyun\u2019s grasp, but Yi Tianyun keeps on holding tight not letting the Spirit King escapes from him and continues to absorb the Spirit King spiritual power until its dry.

But this technique, even if it\u2019s a little bit destructive is not considered to be illegal, there is no such regulations that bans a certain technique to be used.This is a good thing, because the stronger the inheritor the better, only the strong is worthy of this inheritance.The surrounding area changed after a while, and this time showing the scenery from the room of Smelting Trial Stone Tablets. There is no one there but the two of them, clearly Yi Tianyun is still not back to his physical body. This time when he inspected the Stone Tablet, he noticed something different. He can\u2019t read anything from the tablet before, but now he can clearly see what is written on the tablet.\u201cMysterious Heaven Divine Secret Art?\u201dYi Tianyun reads the content of the tablet and he was a little bit surprised, he didn\u2019t think that it\u2019s gonna be this easy to become a spirit king. He didn\u2019t expect that in order to become a Spirit King all you need is rely on some Divine Arts.\u201cI believe you are a little bit surprised. This is a divine art that has been developed by master for many, many years. As long as the inheritor has a strong innate ability, this Divine Art can help them cultivate into Spirit King!\u201d Old Xuan also informed \u201cThis is a Heaven Level Martial Art or to be precise Middle Grade Heaven Level Martial Art, but unfortunately it\u2019s impossible to upgrade it any further into High Grade Heavens Level Martial Art.\u201dHe sighed deeply and thought it was a pity that this Divine Art can\u2019t improve any further. If this Divine Art can be improved into a High Grade Heavens Level Martial Art, it could help him reach a Saint King Level!\u201cIt\u2019s already a great achievement to be able to create a martial art that can greatly help cultivator to reach Spirit King Level.\u201dYi Tianyun already knows the difficulty to improve a martial arts, a martial arts suitable for cultivation is rarely the same from person to person, if that person doesn\u2019t know about his own ability, cultivation deviation could happen..Heaven level martial arts in its own way is already amazing enough. There is not that many poeple capable of mastering this level of martial arts. This level of martial arts only can be found fourth level factions or above.\u201cYes, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to cultivate this Divine Art. You have to inherit master\u2019 legacy, with your strength, I think you can do it, and you have to fulfill master\u2019s last wish to perfect the XuanTian Divine Art as an Inheritor.\u201d Old Xuansolemnly said.Yi Tianyun nodded \u201cI hereby accepted.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019ve made your resolve, let me remind you that this martial art not only require high Innate Ability, but also demanding another condition.\u201d Old Xuan adds.\u201cWhatkind of conditions?\u201d Yi Tianyun asked.\u201cBlood Qi have to be strong enough and the Divine art requires the user\u2019s physical prowess to be strong enough as well!\u201d Old Xuan explained \u201cXuan Tian Divine Art can be said to be some kind of a door that allows the user to reach an ultimate defense power. It needs a strong Blood Qi and Physique to support it.\u201dImmediately, Yi Tianyun activated his Dragon God Bloodline in front of Old Xuan, his Blood Qi rises and his physical prowess is enhanced, making Old Xuan lost for words.\u201cIs this good enough?\u201d Yi Tianyun indifferently asked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026\u201d Old Xuan who was surprised by Yi Tianyun\u2019s power silently said \u201cRascal!\u201dIf the inheritor didn\u2019t have the standard, he will have to strengthen himself until he is able to cultivate the Divine Art, but Yi Tianyun is not only up to standard, but he is even beyond that standard.\u201cThen you may begin learning the Divine Art now. Your comprehension will be tested. if it doesn\u2019t match with your spiritual power, then there is nothing we could do about it. And you\u2019re obliged to cultivate this divine art up to the second level.\u201d Old Xuan said solemnly.Every Martial Art has affinity. If it doesn\u2019t match the user affinity, it will be extremely hard for them to cultivate it.For example, if the user originally has the fire affinity, it would be almost impossible for them to cultivate an ice attributed martial art. If that person still insisted to cultivate it, they would be in a high risk of injuries, with a chance of dying from the backlash. It is normal for cultivator to abandon a martial arts after cultivating it for half a day because incompatibility.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Besides learning new martial arts, they can cultivate in maximum potential here.Some cultivators manage to breakthrough while they\u2019re here, it\u2019s all thanks to Spirit Gathering Array for concentrating the spiritual energy inside Ancient Ruin.But there\u2019s someone who hasn\u2019t woken up from his meditation, it\u2019s none other than Yi Tianyun!It\u2019s a shock for everyone. Yi Tianyun hasn\u2019t woken up from his meditation and is still shrouded in this light. It\u2019s been so long, it\u2019s been a whole week, and most disciples here finished their meditation in about 15 minutes then proceed to cultivate.The realm within Smelting Trial Stone Tablet filled with nothing but Stone Tablets containing one martial art, and all they need to do is only pick one of them, it shouldn\u2019t take that long.But Yi Tianyun has been at it for a week, it really makes them wonder!\u201cEveryone is about to wrap this up and leave already\u2026 Did he spend too much time picking martial arts or what?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s possible, but why waste so much time in just picking one martial arts?\u201d\u201cWhat a fool, by the time he\u2019s finished, this place won\u2019t be open untill another 3 years!\u201dOther Cultivators laughed and thought that Yi Tianyun was a fool for wasting time picking one martial art instead of cultivating.This is what they thought, including Qin Xue. Little do they know that there\u2019s an additional test await for those who figured out the puzzle.They all failed to figure it out after all, that\u2019s why they don\u2019t know why Yi Tianyun takes so long.\u201cIt\u2019s time!! Everyone inside prepare to leave because Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruin is about to shut!\u201d Somebody shout from outside, their voice reach even into the depth of the ruin even though he can\u2019t come in .Yi Tianyun is in dire situation, but they can\u2019t afford to stay here, if they miss their timing to get out, no other choice but to wait untill 3 years, they won\u2019t even be able to survive here for one year let alone 3 years.Since there\u2019s no food or drink, all they did to survive is absorb spiritual energy from the surrounding, but if one\u2019s cultivation is not high enough, they can\u2019t keep this up for long, so doing this for 3 years is out of question.\u201cSenior Sister, we \u2018re leaving, is there something wrong with Elder Yi? How come he hasn\u2019t woken up yet?\u201d An Ling was in a hurry, yet their Elder hasn\u2019t woken up.Qin Xue frowns and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but perhaps Elder Yi has entered a peculiar state, or he is somehow stuck inside, and it\u2019s not possible to disperse this light shrouding him\u2026 There is no other way but report this to Great Elder, we must leave for now.\u201dThe light from the Smelting Trial Stone Tablet is not something they can disperse that easily.All they can do is leave Yi Tianyun for now, it would be even more problematic if they can\u2019t get out as well, causing even greater loss to Jade Palace. Seven disciples with pretty good innate ability looked at Yi Tianyun for the last time before they get out.They made sure not to let their guard down as they\u2019re surrounded by other sect that may attack them anytime.But as it turns out there\u2019s no point in being cautious, as they\u2019re afraid of Jade Palace for the time being. Because of Jade Palace\u2019s recent reputation they can\u2019t carelessly make enemies out of them.The moment they came out, one of Magnificent Sect\u2019s disciple immediately reported to Sect Master Huan: \u201cSect Master, Liang Feng \u00a0was killed by Yi Tianyun!\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201d Sect Master Huan is startled, and immediately killing intent filled his eyes: \u201cWhat do you mean? explain!\u201dGreat Elder quickly approach to find out, she\u2019s not surprised anymore at this point it\u2019s Yi Tianyun after all.\u201cSect Master Huan, let me explain, your disciple Liang Feng provoke our junior brother and challenge him on a duel, resulting in his death.\u201d Qin Xue explained the chronology of what actually happened.Sect Master Huan raised his eyebrow, Liang Feng is one of his precious disciple. He has done a lot to help Liang Feng become stronger.\u201cIs that the truth?\u201d Sect Master Huan looked at his disciple and confirming the truth.\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLouder!\u201d said Sect Master Huan, staring coldly at his disciple.\u201cYes!\u201d The disciple shouted.\u201cTrash! If Liang Feng lost in a duel of life and death, then that\u2019s all he\u2019s worth.\u201d Sect Master Huan slaps the the disciple, and said coldly: \u201cApologize to Great Elder of Jade Palace!\u201d\u201cYes, Sect Master\u2026\u201d The disciple hurriedly stood up, and said to Great Elder with his swollen face: \u201cSorry for the trouble our Senior Brother caused\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for my lack of supervision, Great Elder Mo Yu.\u201d Sect Master Huan apologized.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Great Elder replied faintly. She knew that Sect Master Huan just didn\u2019t want to provoke Jade Palace. They\u2019re afraid of Jade Palace because Jade Palace just drive away three great faction.Afterwards he checked the martial arts his disciple learned while enduring his anger. No matter whose fault was that, his disciple which he spent quite a lot of resources on was killed. How can he remain calm?\u201cNow where\u2019s Elder Yi?\u201d Great Elder looked around and didn\u2019t see the source of trouble among the crowd.\u201cElder Yi\u2026he\u2019s still meditating at the Smelting Trial Stone Tablet.

There is no other way but exits at given time.This gate has been opening for almost a week now, the gate will soon closed without warning. Everyone thought if Yi Tianyun continue to immerse himself like this, he would be trapped inside. Sect Master Huan is very much eager to see Yi Tianyun trapped and died inside the Ruins.The time limits keep on approaching, but Yi Tianyun is still nowhere to be seen. Everybody else who is not from Jade Palace keeps thinking what a fool Yi Tianyun is, they only know that the stone tablet only give one martial art and that\u2019s all. Everyone thinks that all he needs to do is choose one and then finish his meditation. It would be an embarrassment for Jade Palace if Yi Tianyun really end up trapped inside the ruins. Jade Palace would be titled the house of the greedy fools.Meanwhile inside the ruins, Yi Tianyun isn\u2019t aware of all the commotion happening outside, and he\u2019s still on his quest to improve the Xuan Tian Divine Art into the second level and finish his quest. The Crazy System he has making the procedure for comprehending the Divine Art much easier and faster. He notices the amount of time he took and immediately realize that the Divine Art is much more complicated than what he thought in the beginning.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Appraisal Eye to have this effect as well, but the problem is it\u2019s too slow\u201dOne of the Appraisal Eye effect is if the input a martial art, Appraisal Eye will process that martial art and when it\u2019s done, the user can use the martial art. Yi Tianyun can speed up this process but he needs to level up Appraisal Eye first which requires 50.000 Crazy Point and he doesn\u2019t have that much right now, so there\u2019s no choice but to bear with the current speed.[Ding, successful learn Xuan Tian Divine Art (missing version).]After a long period of processing, finally he managed to learn the divine art. He quickly checks his status for any abnormal status problems, and also checked his cultivation technique bar. He breathed a sigh of relief once he notices that Xuan Tian Divine Art is properly listed in his cultivation technique and there\u2019s no problem regarding that.\u201cOld Xuan, I\u2019ve successfully cultivated the Divine Art.\u201d Yi Tianyun reported to Old Xuan with a light smile on his face.\u201cYou\u2019ve learned the Divine Art in this short period of time?\u201d Old Xuan is clearly perplexed out of his mind, the time that Yi Tianyun take to learn the divine art is too short, one could say that Yi Tianyun breaks the record of learning speed for such a complicated divine art.Xuan Tian Divine Art is one of the most complicated martial art that exist in this era, and moreover the martial arts is created so that every level of progress is made for different phase of cultivations.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve mastered the second level of the divine art.\u201d Yi Tianyun says proudly.\u201cYou reached Second Level so quickly?\u201d Old Xuan is really surprised by Yi Tianyun\u2019s development on the Divine Art. he couldn\u2019t believe Yi Tianyun only take 1 week to get to second level, while he himself took 1 month to cultivates it.\u201cYes, I have learned Second Level.\u201d Yi Tianyun said undeterredOld Xuan was silenced for a while and said \u201cVery well then. Show it to me!\u201dYi Tianyun nodded and quickly released the aura that proves his mastery of the first level, and then he began to compress the aura and covers it all around his body, producing crystal like armor around his body. This is proving that he has mastery in second level of the divine art.The crystal like armor around his body is very subtle and transparent, anyone who doesn\u2019t know would think lightly of this, but once they tries to attack, their attack will not have any effect at all, except the attack is way stronger than the current level of the armor. This shield also gives advantage for hand to hand combat fighters as the armor wraps itself around the user, that is also includes the fist, if the user attack the enemies with his fist, surely strongly condensed spiritual power that make up the armor would greatly harm the opponent.\u201cYou are one unpredicted boy, hahaha! You really mastered the second level with only just one week!\u201d Old Xuan pleasantly laughed and congratulates Yi Tianyun for his achievement.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing that amazing really, i\u2019m just being cautious not to make any mistakes.\u201d Yi Tianyun humbly replied.\u201cDon\u2019t be so modest, you already possess the power stronger than the master on his youth. So it\u2019s pretty much a given you can learn the Divine Art in just a week. Since there is no problem in your cultivations, this Xuan Tian Divine Art is finally yours, I will proceed to implant the complete version of the divine art in your memory and pass you the full version of the divine art, so that you can continue to cultivate it in the future.\u201dOld Xuan produces a little ball of light that travels slowly into Yi Tianyun\u2019s head, and immediately after the ball of light entered his head, and he somehow feels as if a spark of inspiration struck his head, completing another half of Xuan Tian Divine Art. He doesn\u2019t really need Old Xuan to do this for him, but he doesn\u2019t want to complain. There is nobody that knows the range of Yi Tianyun\u2019s ability afterall.\u201cYou officially become the inheritor of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, and rightfully take over the owner\u2019s legacy!

His crit chance is so low, but that can be solved with prestige points and Luck Aura combined, if he gets a new accesories or equipment to increase the crit chance it would be even better, there\u2019s no need to add critical damage now as Sword of Endlessness got that covered.\u201cIs there anything else I need to do now?\u201d Yi Tianyun snaps out of his thought and asked Old Xuan regarding if there anything he needs to do with his position as the controller of the ruins now.\u201cYes, the former owner\u2019s greatest wish is to return back to his sect to assess the situation in there, but he no longer able to do that considering that he died during his meditations here. The former owner hopes that the successor can return to his sect in his place and join the sect and become a disciple there.\u201d Old Xuan informed Yi Tianyun with sad smile and a sigh.\u201cIf I may, what sect is it?\u201d Yi Tianyun already very eager to receive his next Main Quest, and surely a sect where a Spirit King is originated is not some average Sect either.\u201cHeaven\u2019s Top Mansion!\u201d Old Xuan solemnly spoken.\u201cHeaven\u2019s Top Mansion?\u201dYi Tianyun heard clearly, but never heard of such faction.

    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - Appraisal Eye Level Up!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88: Appraisal Eye Level\u00a0Up!With Old Xuan leading the way, Yi Tianyun arrived at the weapons storage. After examining the weapons in this room however, Yi Tianyun feels somewhat disappointed. The weapon is all in common iron or in spirit tool level, which is not useful enough. And since the weapons here aren\u2019t even used or properly maintained, most of them was already corroded, even some of the common iron level weapon is already reduced to scrap iron. The spirit tools are not an exception either, there is no helping it in this point, the weapons is already too damaged to be repaired again. It will be so much better to just make a new one.\u201cIs this all the weapon in the ruins?\u201d Yi Tianyun asked Old Xuan. \u201cYes, I am sorry about the state of the weapon in here. It\u2019s just that no one succeeded in becoming successor for such a long time that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to come here. But still, I didn\u2019t expect them to be extremely damaged like this.\u201d Old Xuan said to Yi Tianyun with a little bit of sadness in his eyes. He certainly wants to please Yi Tianyun as a new successor but things are not going his way.\u201cI understand, there is nothing we can do about this.\u201d Yi Tianyun sighed, but he realized that he need to clean this pile of scraps away, after all there is no good thing left among these pile of trash in his place.Yi Tianyun quickly gathered all the damaged weapons and sold it all in one go. Old Xuan couldn\u2019t help but gasp seeing the way Yi Tianyun deal with this, but he choose to not say anything, for he doesn\u2019t know the extent of Yi Tianyun\u2019s power.After selling all the trash, Yi Tianyun frowns at the Crazy Point he acquired from the sale. It just too little for the amount of weapons he sold, the damaged Spirit Tools only worth around a few dozen Crazy Point, and the Common Iron one is even worse, only worth around a few Crazy Point. But this is not deterring him much, after all, all he wants to do is just clean the place up.\u201cPhew, finally the pile of trash is gone.\u201d Yi Tianyun looks at the empty room in front of him and feels somewhat satisfied. Afterwards, he opened his Status Window and inspects it to see any changes.Player Name: Yi TianyunLevel: 28 (Eighth Level Core Condensation)Experience: 754322/2500000Crazy Point: 58728Prestige: 130Cultivation Techniques: Dark North Divine Art, Dragon God Secret Art, Xuan Tian Divine ArtAbility: Absorbing Stars Great Technique, Sky Cloud Step, Blood Fiend Soaring HeavenWeapon: Frost Fist, Scarlet Dagger, Wind Chasing Blade, Blood Fiend Divine Spear, Sword of EndlessnessArmor: Snow Wolf Battle Boots, Divine Armor, Shadow CloakDivine Ability: Crazy Mode, Lucky AuraBloodline: Dragon God BloodlineAdornments: Forging God Hammer, Power bracelet, Power ring, Power Belt, Blood Fiend BraceletAll items: Recovery Pill x18, Double Experience Pill x5, Gift Pack Lv31, Life, Bad Luck PillWith his Crazy Point steadily increasing, and now it\u2019s already around 58.000 points, he can upgrade the Appraisal Eye with this amount. But he hesitated on doing so, from his perspective, Appraisal Eye is not that important, thus leveling it up isn\u2019t that necessary just yet.\u201cForget it, leveling this thing up now is useless!\u201d He said to himself, he\u2019s really torn between this decisions. But after a while, he bites his lips in frustration and immediately level up the Appraisal Eye.\u201cDing, consumes 50.000 Crazy Points, Leveling up Appraisal Eye!\u201d\u201cDing, successfully levels up Appraisal Eye! Adding new features: Double memory speed, double reading speed, and more detailed data. The next level requires 500.000 Crazy Point.\u201dYi Tianyun huffed immediately after hearing the new features he gets, even though these effects are within his expectations. After re-reading the effect one more time, he wants to know what kind of new information that he can get with this more detailed data that he has. Immediately he uses his Appraisal Eye on himself to test the effect.Yi Tianyun: Eighth Level Core Condensation, wearing Divine Armor, has an overall Combat Power of 61.000 Points. With Martial Art Dragon God Secret Art, Xuan Tian Divine Art. . . . Weakness: No Weakness.After the martial arts line, he just skin through his own status to see what information is new with this new Appraisal Eye features. At the end of his status, he sees that one extra line was added, a Weakness! He clearly surprised, a weakness is the most critical aspect in martial arts, this is already become a great infestation in his head.Immediately, he tries it on Old Xuan, to see if the feature appears to other things too.Old Xuan: Peak Core Condensation, not materialized, Damage Nullification, Combat Power is 83.000 points, with Martial Art Xuan Tian Divine Art, Flying Thunder Palm . . . Weakness: Destroy Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins Great Array In order to kill, otherwise target is immune to any type of damage. Success on termination grants 20.000 Exp, 3000 Crazy Points. Chance on dropping: Xuan Tian Divine Art (Heavens Level), Flying Thunder Palm, Primordial Palm. . .There is so much information listed in Old Xuan data that Yi Tianyun couldn\u2019t help but to skim it through. \u201cTurns out this upgrade is so good!\u201d He says to himselfYi Tianyun slaps his own thigh due to excitement, he didn\u2019t expect the leveled up Appraisal Eye would give him this many information. He only expects it to give him double reading speed and that\u2019s it. But now he can abuse this Appraisal eye to get a nicer drops and an easier victory. He already thinking on using Appraisal Eye combined with the Lucky Aura, he will not waste anymore Crazy Point on using his Luck Aura, he can assess the enemy drops chance first, if he sees something he wants, than he activates his Luck Aura, if they don\u2019t possess anything he wants he simply kill them without activating the Luck Aura. Old Xuan that stands next to Yi Tianyun look at him weirdly, he only sees Yi Tianyun laughing and keeps on talking to himself like a madman, he can\u2019t help but thought that Yi Tianyun is deeply upset by the state of weapons in the ruins.\u201cYoung Master, something wrong? I know that the weapons are an embarrassment but I can assure you that the cultivation room will even things up\u201d Old Xuan tries to comfort Yi Tianyun.\u201cNo, there is nothing wrong, of course, take me to the cultivation room.\u201d Yi Tianyun tries to put away his smiles, he still feels overwhelming satisfaction on leveling up the Appraisal Eye. He now learns that it so much better to just level up stuff he owns, than tried his luck on a lottery.Immediately, Old Xuan leads him to Cultivation Room. The room itself still in a great condition, because of the Spirit Gathering Array, the concentrations of Spiritual Power in the room is extremely high. This room surely would be really useful later.Yi Tianyun now can clearly see that Spirit King Xuan Tian didn\u2019t just choose a random place to build his sanctuary. This place clearly is already been thoroughly investigated and checked before this place even built. The amount of Spiritual Power collected by the Spirit Gathering Array is enormous, but it\u2019s true there\u2019s no way to intervene time itself, he realized that the Spirit Gathering Array has deteriorated, and needs an immediate maintenance.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere will be no problems as long as I fixed this.\u201d Yi Tianyun says to himself, but he\u2019s still unsure if he could restore it back to its prime state. If he can enhance the effect of Spirit Gathering Array, this place can become a better cultivation environment than Jade Palace.\u201cWell, this place is great. Is there any other place you can show me?\u201d Yi Tianyun asked.This place is a hidden place. So he can\u2019t help but thinks that there is so many more room than the one he already sees.\u201cNo, those are the only rooms in this ruins, Young Master\u201d Old Xuan said.\u201cOkay, I understand this place layout already\u201d Yi Tianyun nodded. He already mapped all the rooms in the ruins, surely he doesn\u2019t have any more problems inside here. Now comes the time to prepare to leave and look at the situations outside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked at it carefully. He was surprised and mumbled \u201cIsn\u2019t this Great Elder\u2019s\u2026\u201dHe immediately realized what\u2019s going on, they thought he was trapped inside, so she threw in the Storage Ring as emergency ration for him. Having nothing to eat for three years in here, there\u2019s no way he can survive.But even throwing a Storage Ring here will not of any use because Old Xuan patrolled around the ruin periodically and dispose anything that doesn\u2019t belong here, in other words there really is no other way Yi Tianyun can survive from here other than completing his Main Quest and earn the control of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins.Staying here will only drain the Spiritual Power here, so even with a lot of food, with the lack of Spiritual Power they won\u2019t be able to survive anyway.Holding this Storage Ring, Yi Tianyun is very touched, at least they cared about him and do something within their power to help.\u201cIt is time to go back\u2026\u201dThen Yi Tianyun opened the gate, the gate made a \u201crumbling\u201d sound, slowly open and make way for Yi Tianyun.It\u2019s fairly easy to do this since all Yi Tianyun needs to do is imagine it on his mind, there\u2019s no need to say anything.He didn\u2019t see anyone when he got out, it would be troublesome if someone saw him leaving a few days after the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins closed, which is unnatural.The gate was completely closed causing a loud noise. When Yi Tianyun nodded with satisfaction, suddenly he felt somene\u2019s presence, he looked around and said: \u201cWho\u2019s there!\u201dHe felt that presence from the forest. It was hundreds of meters away from his position. But there\u2019s not even one person can be seen from where he stood.Immediately, he felt a killing intent that send shivers down one\u2019s spine, and he sank in his heart. This is really unexpected for Yi Tianyun. He didn\u2019t expect there would someone observing outside the ruins waiting him.\u201cIt seems that my hunch is correct after all. I stay here for a few days just in case. I can\u2019t believe you just opened the gates of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins and go out just like that! Besides, no one spent more than a week just to choose a martial art from Smelting Trial Stone Tablet, so there must be something else, but i really didn\u2019t expect it\u2019s because you can come and leave at will.\u201d As the voice gets louder, a familiar figure show himself from the forest.\u201cSect Master Huan!\u201d Yi Tianyun did not expect it was Sect Master Huan of Magnificent Sect. How can he think this through. Others thought Yi Tianyun was a fool for taking too long to choose a Martial Art as a result he was trapped inside.He waited here for two days and when he was about to leave and thought this is just him overthinking things, he saw Yi Tianyun coming out of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins. Which means that he can control Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins at will, which also means everything inside belonged to him!\u201cIs it that surprising? I think seeing you come out of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is even more surprising!\u201d Sect Master Huan said with a grin: \u201cYou may be able to fool others, but not me, besides someone who defeated my disciple won\u2019t make a blunder like taking too long in choosing a Martial Art and ended up trapped inside? I know you\u2019re not that stupid. My luck hasn\u2019t run out too, if you haven\u2019t come out in another minute, i would\u2019ve left\u201d\u201cNow let me give you an offer, give me the control of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, then at the very least i\u2019ll only cut your limbs!\u201dSuddenly his tone changed, and murderous aura becomes even more intense. Obvously his objectives is not only the control of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins!\u201cSo even if i hand the control of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins i\u2019m only left with my head intact to my body? You\u2019re really bad at making a deal!\u201d Yi Tianyun doesn\u2019t look worried nor afraid at all.\u201cWell this deal doesn\u2019t require your consent. There\u2019s alwasy the option to kill you, then i\u2019ll search your Storage Ring.\u201d Sect Master Huan thought the control of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is something that can be obtained from Yi Tianyun or his Storage Ring.He didn\u2019t know that the one that who actually controled Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins was Old Xuan. Even if he killed Yi Tianyun that doesn\u2019t mean he can get the cotrol of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins.\u201cSeems like i can\u2019t talk my way out this time.\u201d Yi Tianyun said with a light smile.\u201cAt least you catch on quick, so what\u2019s your answer? I can at least grant you a quick and painless death. Even after killing my disciple, i would even go this far for you, don\u2019t you think i\u2019m so merciful? To be honest, your Innate Ability is still very good, being Peak Spirit Refinement cultivator at such a young age, but too bad you won\u2019t even able to withstand a single blow from me!\u201d Sect Master Huan said it while slowly approaching Yi Tianyun and gradually increase the intensity of his aura.Sect Master Huan thought that Yi Tianyun is only at the Peak Spirit Refinement because it\u2019s impossible to enter Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins beyond that level.\u201cGo ahead and try\u2026\u201dYi Tianyun observe Sect Master Huan with Appraisal Eye.Huan: Sixth Level of Core Condensation, wearing High Grade Holy Tool armor, Combat Power 40,000.

He didn\u2019t expect Yi Tianyun to be more powerful than him, and not by a small margin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me!\u201d Sect Master Huan said in disbelief. Sect Master Huan quickly get up and immediately use his martial art \u2013 Heavenly Dragon Palm \u2013 creating a twister to attack Yi Tianyun. Yi Tianyun already anticipated this, quickly dodge everything Sect Master Huan throws at him, and quickly counter with his own punch.Yi Tianyun\u2019s punch easily knokcked down Sect Master Huan to the ground, and another teeth of his is broken again. Yi Tianyun sneers at Sect Master Huan, and he immediately realize that Yi Tianyun is not even using his full power in that punch. The gap between the two of them is too big as Yi Tianyun has almost 70.000 combat power meanwhile Sect Master Huan only has merely 40.000.Yi Tianyun slowly walks over to Sect Master Huan and said \u201cWhat now?\u201d Master Huan that still tries to recover from Yi Tianyun\u2019s punch earlier, he\u2019s having light concussion and having problem with his vision but said \u201cH \u2013 how can your cultivation be much h-higher than mine? This is i-impossible!\u201d Sect Master Huan clearly had trouble to even speak normally.\u201cYou clearly didn\u2019t know anything yet you leave me the option of only having my body without my limbs? Delusional old man! Now I am not gonna be that merciful for you am i?\u201d Yi Tianyun speaks while grinning to Sect Master Huan and seeing this demon\u2019s smile just send chill down his spine. He immediately lift his hand when Yi Tianyun got closer and screamed \u201cDie!!\u201d as a black smoke and liquid comes out from the storage ring in his palm.Yi Tianyun quickly rushes over and slams Sect Master Huan Palm to his own body, and jumps back, Sect Master Huan palm suddenly goes \u201cBOOM!\u201d blowing off Sect Master Huan. Sect Master Huan\u2019s armor cant handle the impact and was destroyed, along with his hand. He tries to turn around to faces Yi Tianyun, but his body convulsed signing that he no longer be able to move, and start to cough up blood.Yi Tianyun walks over to Sect Master Huan slowly again while saying \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you off all people try to use a hidden weapon, that bomb ertainly is a bad news, but you\u2019re just way too obvious.\u201d Yi Tianyun has been watching his movement from the beginning, of course he noticed Sect Master Huan was preparing to do an underhanded tactics like this. After Sect Master Huan cough up some more blood he immediately pleaded \u201cI beg of you to spare my life, I will not bother you anymore! And I will make sure that my Magnificent Sect would be under your command!\u201dSect Master Huan doesn\u2019t have any other means to fight Yi Tianyun, so he choose to bow his head down and beg for mercy. He doesn\u2019t want to die just yet, he is a Sect Master of Magnificent Sect. He still have a bright future in front of him.Yi Tianyun\u2019s expression quickly change and his voice turned cold while saying \u201cDo you think you can just beg for mercy and then return to your sect like nothing happened? If our position is reversed would you spare my life and let me go?\u201d Yi Tianyun laughs and says \u201cSeems like you\u2019re not dead yet so, let\u2019s try this one\u2026.\u201dYi Tianyun took out his Immortal Fire and throws it immediately to Sect Master Huan. The fire envelope Sect Master Huan almost immediately and Sect Master Huan screams so loud that anyone seeing this clearly will have goosebumps. Soon enough Sect Master Huan stops struggling and \u00a0was completely burned on the ground.[Ding ,successfully killed Sect Master Huan, gained 54.000 Experience, Heavenly Dragon Palm (Earth Level Martial Art), 100.000 Experience Pill, 3200 Crazy Point.]Yi Tianyun is frowning when he saw this notification, he only got one Heavenly Dragon Palm and 100.000 Experience Pill. \u201cThis is too little\u201d he said to himself. He thinks that he really need to activates the Lucky Aura to be able to get more drops from the enemy he kills, otherwise the items dropped are really bad. After a while he thought that Heavenly Dragon Palm is good enough for now, an Earth Level Martial Art, and easy fight too, he barely even do anything in this fight.He walks to the corpse of Master Huan and checks the content of the Storage Ring, the ring contained a lot of wealth, many Medicinal Pill, Gold, and some good quality Spirit Tools. This is good enough in his mind, because there is no way a sect master brought the his sect\u2019s properties with him at all time.He Examines the Heavenly Dragon Palm after storing the Sect Master Huan\u2019s Storage Ring in his pocket. Immediately the book of Heavenly Dragon Palm appears on his hand. He\u2019s immediately filled with joy. He can give this book to Jade Palace to quickly increase their strength, but the downside is that he can\u2019t cultivate it himself, because once a book of martial art is cultivated thebook itself would disappear. \u201dI guess I would leave this martial art to Jade Palace. . . No! what am I thinking! If this martial art exposed to the outside, it would become evidence that Sect Master huan is already dead and Jade Palace have something to do with his dead.\u201d He quickly put the book in his inventory and choose to sell it.\u201c8.000 Crazy Points just for this? It sure is an Earth level Martial art.\u201d Yi Tianyun feels better, he already spent a whopping 50.000 Crazy Point to level up his Appraisal Eye, and getting 8.00 Crazy Point for now is good enough.After he is done checking all the new item he got from Sect Master Huan, he waves his hand and the ground around the corpse turn to mud and proceed to swallow the corpse of Sect Master Huan. Yi Tianyun does this for his own convenience. \u201cFortunately only Sect Master Huan, it would be troublesome if there\u2019s someone else seeing me come out of Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins.\u201d He said to himself. He doesn\u2019t want anyone to know he can control the Heaven Immersing Ancient Ruins, he want to rush to Jade Palace and let Shi Xueyun be the first one to know and make the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins become the second stronghold for Jade Palace.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe knows that the defenses of the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins is much better than the current Jade Palace defenses. \u201cI need to get to Jade Palace as fast as possible.\u201d He said to himself. \u201cI need to be careful not to cause any more trouble along the way as it could delay his arrival.\u201d He quickly rushes to Jade Palace while looking around and detect his surroundings.He wants to quickly promote Jade Palace into Jade Sect, so he needs to improve Jade Palace\u2019s comprehensive strength to be able to promote it. He needs to forge many weapons, armor, and trinkets. He wants his main quest to be done at the shortest amount of time possible.At the same time, in Jade Palace.The Skies went darker and darker in a short amount of time, the clouds began to darken and gather on the Jade Palace, and the people inside Jade Palace has their senses becomes duller in any passing seconds.Shi Xueyun notices this strange atmosphere almost immediately, and she quickly rushes to the outside gate to see what is happening. In no time she felt the pressure from afar and she notices the terrifying aura that comes with it. She understood immediately that the revenge is coming to Jade Palace, she need to prepare, to prepare for another war!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They immediately noticed something\u2019s wrong and immediately arranged to evacuate from the Jade Palace toward the snowy mountain. They would be able to evacuate smoothly unless they were completely surrounded.After the evacuation began, someone came to report the situation.\u201cPalace Lord\u2026 There is an Expert guarding the snowy mountain, he blocked our evacuation route!\u201d Deacon, who hurried back.\u201cThis is getting out of hand\u2026\u201dShi Xueyun frowned, to think that this day actually came, although she\u2019s really confused at first because the one leading these masses are a group of old men. And it\u2019s really old men, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if a month from now they would be dead.A total of six men leading the attack, although there\u2019s no sign of youth left from them, the aura they emitted doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the case, even from the aura, everyone already knows they\u2019re not just an average old men.The six of them are the three faction of Old Ancestor. They are at the Peak Core Condensation. Only a step away from the Spirit Core, but this step is proving to be the ultimate wall, as they can\u2019t breakthrough to Spirit Core.Normally, even if their Sect Lord is killed they wouldn\u2019t care. Because they don\u2019t have that long anymore, it would be better for them to remain in slumber to prolong their life even if only a little bit. But since this is a somewhat special case, their Sect took a heavy blow, losing so many improtant figure including the Sect Lord to a faction full of woman, their pride can\u2019t allow that, that\u2019s why they march here for revengeEven though they can\u2019t reach Spirit Core, it\u2019s still amazing that they can reach the Peak of Core Condensation, At Core Condensation, one\u2019s life expectancy is up to four or five hundred years old. And from the looks of it they don\u2019t have that long. The most efficient way to prolong their life right now is breakthrough to Spirit Core Realm.Spirit Core can live up to thousands of years, but even if they breakthrough to Spirit Core, at their age right now they won\u2019t be so formidable.\u201cPalace Lord, what should we do now?\u201d Great Elder Mo Yu has returned, despite their dire situation and Yi Tianyun, Jade Palace\u2019s powerhouse right now is missing she tried to maintain his dignity.\u201cI want to go to Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins to see whether i can do something to free Tianyun, but I didn\u2019t expect them to come so soon\u2026\u201d Shi Xueyun was very anxious when she found out Yi Tianyun was trapped inside Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, she was going to go to the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins. But Jade Palace is in danger right now so she can\u2019t afford to do so.Somehow as if they know Yi Tianyun is trapped inside the ruins, these Old Ancestors choose this exact moment to attack Jade Palace.If Yi Tianyun is around, even those Old Ancestors will be having a hard time dealing with him as they don\u2019t know his real strength. Although they\u2019re at Peak Core Condensation, they\u2019re already so old that their strength is nowhere near in their prime, but it\u2019s a fact that they\u2019re at Peak Core Condensation so they can\u2019t be underestimated that\u2019s for sure.\u201cPalace Lord, this is the worst timing they pick to attack\u2026\u201d Great Elder Mo Yu felt guilty.\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, i\u2019m pretty sure that brat will figure something out anyway\u2026\u201d Shi Xueyun said solemnly: \u201cNow let\u2019s focus fighting these Old Ancestors!\u201dThese six Old Ancestors walked toward Jade Palace, each of their step is really heavy, six Peak Core Condensation Expert along with their deacons, the aura enveloping these people combined is just crazy.Jade Palace, could only watch from afar as these monsters getting even closer.\u201cBeen a while since i breathe some fresh air, so this is your sect\u2026\u201d at the Peak Core Condensation, it is Wing Sect\u2019s Old Ancestor, Old Ancestor Wen Tian!\u201cKilling so many of our disciple, there\u2019s no running away from us!\u201d at 9th Level of Core Condensation, it is Spirit Sect\u2019s Old Ancestor, Old Ancestor Tian Feng!\u201cYes, just because we haven\u2019t been actively involved you thought we\u2019re already dead?\u201d Old Ancestor of Wind Pavilion is Old Ancestor Feng Yun, he is also at 9th Level of Core Condensation.Among these six the lowest cultivation is at 9th level of Core Condensation, it really isn\u2019t an exaggeration to call them monsters. Those three are the representatives of their respective sects and are the oldest Old Ancestor.As they get closer the aura they emitted is even more intense that it becomes so suffocating to breathe normally.\u201cYes, seems like you haven\u2019t kicked the bucket yet, our Jade Palace is First Level Faction, but that doesn\u2019t mean we will yield to the likes of you!\u201dIt\u2019s the three Old Ancestor of Jade Palace. They are pretty much already an old hag, but they\u2019re not the slightest bit fliched by this scene. They are the Old Ancestor who have been secluding themselves to cultivate. They are definitely needed now that Jade Palace is backed into a corner like this.Their cultivation base is high but not as high as those six Old Ancestors, they\u2019re only at 8th Level of Core Condensation. But even 8th level of Core Condensation is already considered formidable enough in this continent.\u201cSeems like you haven\u2019t kicked the bucked either, you really desperately hold on to that thin lifeline huh?\u201d Old Ancestor Wen Tian said with a sneer: \u201cI will say it now, since you killed so many of our people, i\u2019ll give you two choices. Either form Dao Companion with our sect respectively, or drop like flies under our might!\u201dBoth choice ended in tragedy. Especially the first one, they keep their life but dead on the inside.Normally to become Dao Companion both men and women need to love each other, but the first choice is more like slavery!\u201cWe\u2019d rather perish here than become your slaves!\u201d Old Ancestor Bing Xin looked cold and absolutely disapprove their offer.\u201cAlright then, as you wish you can die here with the whole Jade Palace, that is the price you have to pay!\u201d Old Ancestor Wen Tian said with a sneer: \u201cDo it!\u201dBut strangely none of them do anything just yet, but something happened at Jade Palace\u2019s crowd.\u201cpuff\u2026\u201d blood splattered from one of the disciple\u2019s body, the same thing happened to another disciple, and then another one\u2026The disciples were stabbed and died instantly, but the culprit is not from these three factions, it\u2019s the traitors from Jade Palace!\u201cYou traitors!\u201d Shi Xueyun\u2019s eyes were cold, when Shi Xueyun is about to attack these traitors a figure jumped and intercept Shi Xueyun\u2019s attack, it is one of the enemy\u2019s Old Ancestor.\u201cBang\u201d, he fended off Shi Xueyun\u2019s attack and send her flying.There are only a few traitors, around 5 disciples! Their cultivation is not low, some even reach the Spirit Refinement, and even among them are the ones who entered Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins!The disciple they helped to develop even further, turned out to be a traitor, that\u2019s unacceptable.\u201cHaha, now that your precious brat is not here what can you do? I heard that brat\u2019s cultivation has reached the level of Core Condensation, he really is something else.\u201d Old Ancestor Wen Tian said with a sneer : \u201ctrapped inside Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins.

His cultivation couldn\u2019t be much apart from themselves, if Yi Tianyun\u2019s cultivation really is the same as them, Yi Tianyun would become a big problem, as even if the cultivation is the same it can\u2019t be said the same for the physical prowess. Yi Tianyun is stil young therefore he obviously has the advantage on that aspect.They choose to attack Jade Palace now too is not a mere coincidence. They already got info that Yi Tianyun is trapped inside the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins. They know that Jade Palace\u2019s morale would be down right now providing a perfect opportunity for them to attack.\u201cUnfortunately, that genius brat of yours is trapped inside the Heavens Immersing Ancient Ruins, I don\u2019t know what methods did he use to enter that place considering his level of cultivation but now he is trapped inside, he should be dead by the time the door opens again. If by some miracle he doesn\u2019t die, the Jade Palace would be long gone! Many people think that you still have unknown forces to help you in dire needs, but I knew better.

The disciples of Jade Palace become uneasy and many start to whisper among themselves in the back. They know that if Yi Tianyun is not here, Jade Palace would have a hard time against these monsters.Shi Xueyun saw this coming, so she gently close her eyes and says \u201cWhoever wants to surrender, I will not stop you, as your life is your own, so you can make your own choice.\u201d These words from Xueyun make anybody who\u2019s already doubting their survival in Jade Palace convinced and change side. Many of them who surrender are from the outer disciple as they didn\u2019t feel attached to Jade Palace like the inner disciple. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all inner disciple is loyal to Jade Palace, as some of them is defecting too.The elder that sees the inner disciple defecting from them only shook their heads. They understand that the will to live is different from amongst every individual because it\u2019s their own life at stake here.\u201cWhat are you doing, don\u2019t you believe in the Palace Lord?\u201d At this time, a voice resound from the crowd. This person is Jiu Lingyun who was brought to Jade Palace by Yi Tianyun!Everybody in Jade Palace was quite shocked by this development, they didn\u2019t expect Jiu Lingyun to be the one who stands up for Jade Palace, she is just a commoner who was accepted to Jade Palace because of Yi Tianyun\u2019s generosity, they didn\u2019t expect her to be so brave.In the other end, Old Ancestor Wen Tian shook his head, \u201cwho is this stupid little girl?\u201d he asked someone behind him. After a while someone comes up to him and say 'she is a girl that Yi Tianyun found in Wind City, she is from the slum.\u201d Old Ancestor Wen Tian sneers \u201chooo, a girl brought by the problematic brat, that explains everything.\u201dJiu Lingyun is still high on adrenalin, she\u2019s determined to fight for Jade Palace until Yi Tianyun shows up. \u201cYoung Master Yi has gone through so much trouble for me, the least I can do is die protecting what he love\u201d she whispered to herself and after a quick breathe she began to shout \u201cJade Palace is not some place that you can trample all you want! We will fight till our death to defend Jade Palace!\u201dJiu Lingyun\u2019s bravery rises Jade Palace\u2019s morale, more of them decided to defend Jade Palace and rally along with Jiu Lingyun.\u201cYeah, Jade Palace is our home, not some place you can enter all you like, we would defend it till we die!\u201d\u201cI am an orphan who doesn\u2019t even know my parent, I was raised here since I was a child. That alone is already a valid reason to stand my ground here defending my home!\u201dAs if driven by something, these disciples are brimming with fighting spirit. There would be no more swaying words from the enemy would break their will, they would not surrender. Shi Xueyun was surprised by this circumstances, she didn\u2019t expect Jiu Lingyun to have such leadership skills on her.\u201cHaha, group of idiots, I already showed you enough mercy as it is, now let me show you hell! Attack them!! Give me that girl! Let\u2019s see whether she really isn\u2019t afraid of death or not!\u201d Old Ancestor Wen Tian orders his men to attack Jade Palace while pointing at Jiu Lingyun.Immediately everyone charge toward Jade Palace, Six Old Ancestors didn\u2019t hold back and advanced at the same time.

You look plain for a girl, but hey I don\u2019t mind.\u201d The disciple laugh a bit, and tries to lick Lingyun on her face.Jiu Lingyun\u2019s face becomes pale, she looks at him with disgust and she\u2019s ready to bite his tongue off. At the same time, a silver light passed through the sky, and landed near Jiu Lingyun. The enemy\u2019s disciple around Jiu Lingyun is blown away. After the smoke is all cleared up, a big snow wolf appears. This snow wolf is already specifically ordered by Yi Tianyun to protect both Shi Xueyun and Jiu Lingyun.Many people was shocked when they saw the wolf, \u201cwhat is a demon beast doing in here?\u201d they thought to themselves.

At the same time, Yi Tianyun who\u2019s already running back at high speed to the Jade Palace heard the system.[Ding , successfully killed Wing Sect disciple, 2800 Experience, 600 Crazy Point, Blacksmith Mastery 50 points.]Yi Tianyun smirked, although he\u2019s far apart from Snow Wolf, he still gets exp when it killed something.

After he leveled up his Appraisal Eye, he didn\u2019t have enough Crazy Point to buy a double crazy point card, if he has that card he sure is gonna reap a hefty amount of Crazy Points right now.He is thinking in the right direction for leaving the snow wolf here to protect Jade Palace. These Old Ancestors will not give up on destroying the Jade Palace. At the very least the Snow Wolf is able to defend the ground until Yi Tianyun comes. Now, all he needs to do is kill all this enemies and get as much treasures and exp as he can get.On the side, Snow Wolf is also killing many cultivators at spirit refinement realm and body refinement realm like crazy.

We will never show our face in front of you again, we will leave this place never to return, please just let me go!\u201dAfter seeing this situation, Old Ancestor Bing Xin from Jade Palace makes her own remarks, \u201cAre you for real now? After all you have done to us, you want to leave Jade Palace unscathed? When we are at our backs before have you considered giving us mercy?\u201d Old Ancestor Bing Xin makes her way into the last enemy old ancestor. Yi Tianyun saw what Old Ancestor Bing Xin would do and makes his move before Bing Xin arrive to their spot.He trusts his spear against the poor old man\u2019s chest. The old man eyes was taken by disbelief, he screams as he clutches his chest.After he falls completely Yi Tianyun can see a little aura leaving the old man\u2019s body, giving him a proof that the old man already dead. He doesn\u2019t want anybody else to take down his opponent, as he will not gain anything from it.[Ding, successfully killed Old Ancestor Tian Tang, earned 100,000 Experience, 2500 Crazy Point, Burning The Heavens Secret Art (Lower Grade Earth Level Martial Art), Wind and Fire Palm (Earth Level Lower Grade Martial Art )!][Ding, congratulations to Player \u2018Yi Tianyun\u2018, successfully breakthrough to Ninth Level of Core Condensation!]He sighed in relief, knowing that he finally levels up after killing six old ancestors, many elders and deacons. Now it will be a gruesome experience point grinding to achieve level up and he knows that too. The experience point cap also increase as you leveled up is a fact, there is nothing he could do about it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAll he needs to do now is try his best. He turns his attention to his surrounding and see the enemies all scattered throughout the battlefield, he smirked to himself and stored his Blood Fiend Divine Spear and take out the Frost Fist. He couldn\u2019t use this before because the old ancestor level is too high for it effect to be effective, but to face this level of remaining enemies this is enough.He immediately activates its effect and froze the remaining enemies. He started to walks into the nearby frozen sculpture and activates his Absorbing Stars Great Technique.He gets exp like flowing water, it didn\u2019t stop there, as he can no longer absorb the exp from the dried up enemy, he shattered them, giving him additional exp for killing his opponent.After a while, everything\u2019s over. He completely eliminated all the elites brought by the three factions. All that\u2019s left here in the palace is their own and the disciple that defecting to the enemy side at the beginning of the fight.He now needs to clear this matters, as he already know that there is nothing wrong for them to surrender to the enemy to protect their lives, but at this rate, they\u2019ll be a bad example for others.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Many of them didn\u2019t have an experience about such event. The amount of blood that covers the ground and the stench that burns the noses is something that they just find gut wrenching. There are those who likely have seen this kind of event beforehand and doesn\u2019t look like it bothers them much.Yi Tianyun looks at this pile of body and he can\u2019t find it in him to feel pity for any of them. He just can\u2019t feel pity to enemy that wants to rip his happiness from him.Jade Palace disciple immediately took it for themselves to clean up after the pile of dead bodies in front of them. But there is still a problem that wasn\u2019t quite solved just yet. The disciple of Jade Palace that defected to the enemy side before the war happens is still here, they didn\u2019t expect Jade Palace could win in that situation, they feel ashamed of their action and remorseful about it.Yi Tianyun thinks about the problem for himself, and he can\u2019t quite decide about either to kill them for treachery or to let them go. At the very least the one who defected that include themselves to attack Jade Palace are already dead, so the ones that left is just people that really wants to survive.The elders of the palace is confused too, they don\u2019t know how to approach the situation because they also think these people didn\u2019t do anything extremely treacherous.\u201cPalace Lord, what do we do about this problem?\u201d Great Elder Yu asks to Shi Xueyun. Shi Xueyun looks at them and sighed \u201cJust let them go, all they wanted to do is survive after all, and I even encouraged them to do so, but they can\u2019t stay any longer in Jade Palace, as they didn\u2019t have enough devotion to Jade Palace.\u201dThe defected disciples looks at Shi Xueyun with relief \u201cThank you so much Palace Lord!\u201dAfter they were pardoned by Shi Xueyun, they\u2019re immediately on their knees conveying their thanks, and soon leave the Palace with a heavy heart. They still want to dedicate them self to Jade Palace but they can\u2019t do that anymore, they have done something that can be sentenced to dead, but the Lord of the Palace still let them go, and they are forever thankful for that.Shi Xueyun turns her attention to Yi Tianyun, and Yi Tianyun senses the dagger glare coming from Xueyun.\u201cTianyun, You really\u2026\u201dShi Xueyun wants to talk, but Yi Tianyun cut her before she finished her sentence.\u201cAunt, the previous action I have done is clearly for you but the actions I do right now is not only for you but also for the safety of Jade Palace. You made me an elder for Jade Palace and now I shall do my duty to protect it.\u201dYi Tianyun saying these thing with such emotions that make the people hearing him feels moved. Many of them complimenting Tianyun immediately, \u201cElder Yi you are so amazing, we will follow your command in the future.\u201d\u201dYes, you are too good to be true Elder Yi, its amazing to have you as our elder.\u201d\u201cWhatever Elder Yi told us to do later, we will do just that!\u201dAll the disciple shows their adoration to Tianyun, making him a little flushed.[Ding, completed \u2018Protection Achievement\u2019. acquired a permanent Title \u2018Guardian\u2019, twice base Defense Power!]Yi Tianyun startled to have this notification that randomly popped up in front of him. He immediately inspects this information, and he realizes he must have cleared a hidden quest. The reward for this is great too, he got double defense power. He still didn\u2019t have information about the range of this reward and how to activate it, but it\u2019s still one hell of an effect.He inspects the \u2018Guardian\u2019 title once more, and saw the information regarding the requirement for completion of the title which is to have protected more than 500 people with 100 favorability points. He immediately realizes that for the first one he repel the attacks from the three faction he didn\u2019t have the conditions to triggers this title, he didn\u2019t have that much people with that high favorability point.But now that\u2019s not the case anymore, he already earned respect of everybody from the Jade Palace, so their favorability points automatically rose above 100. The condition for completion is already there when he finished this achievement.\u201cI didn\u2019t have any information about the quest for the title, hmmm, this hidden quest must have some crazy condition to complete.\u201d He imagines himself completing another title in the future with some crazy effects.On another side, the Old Ancestor of Jade Palace is feeling a little bit embarrassed, Yi Tianyun clearly have a better cultivation than them, and he is more popular among Jade Palace\u2019s disciple. They feels a little bit sorry about the circumstances, because at first, all they wanted is to drive out Yi Tianyun from the Jade Palace.The three old ancestor look at each other and Old Ancestor Bing Xin sighed and with a little hesitation she said: \u201cElder Yi, we are very sorry about the way we threat you in the past, I hope you can find forgiveness for our previous mistake.\u201d The three of the old ancestor bow their head to Tianyun willingly, and Yi Tianyun know that its not easy to bow head at their position.Tianyun sincerely said \u201cI don\u2019t really care about the previous matter, I never think of something that\u2019s already in the past. Its not like you did something unforgivable before, but know this, in the past, present and the future the only one i will listen to is only my aunt, no matter how high your position here i won\u2019t listen to you. If we can agree with that, I am sure we will not have any problems.\u201d Even if one can say that Yi Tianyun\u2019s words is quite harsh but there is no helping that. It is already an incredible feat to have Yi Tianyun protects them after treating him so bad in the past.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe most important thing for him right now is to protect Shi Xueyun and JiuLingyun as best as he can. He can order the Snow Wolf to separately protect the Jade Palace for him. The old ancestor clearly embarrassed but they are glad Tianyun doesn\u2019t turn his back from them.Shi Xueyun smacks Yi Tianyun in the back of his head \u201cThat is not how you talks to your elders! But I don\u2019t dislike it.\u201dShe gave Tianyun a toothy smile. the three old ancestor thought that Shi Xueyun would reprimand Yi Tianyun for talking in such manner to them but clearly they were wrong, Shi Xueyun would do anything for her loved ones, she\u2019s even ready to leave Jade Palace for Tianyun. All they could do is show a bitter smile to Yi Tianyun and Shi Xueyun, they can\u2019t reprimand them as Yi Tianyun is more powerful than them right now, and Shi Xueyun is a Palace Lord.Shi Xueyun turns her attention to the entire Jade Palace disciple standing there looking at them and said \u201cWell, what are you waiting for? Chop chop! Clean this place up! We need to clear the three great faction after this!\u201d Shi Xueyun coldly smiles, showing her murderous intent.There is nothing left in the three great factions, they lost almost all of their high ranking members, and with that, they lost their capability to send help. This is proving more and more to the surrounding faction that Jade Palace is not to be disturbed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The land owned by the three great palace would be either closed or becomes part of the Jade Palace, in the end it is the spoil of war for Jade Palace.In the Jade Palace, Tianyun took his long overdue rest and tries to organize his inventory. Because of the recent war, he gets a lot of loots and not to mention the loot he got from the old ancestor he killed are mostly high quality item, like an earth level martial arts and soul tool. After he inspected the effect of each individual loots he sighed \u201call of this sure is high leveled items, but none of them is something i really need. It\u2019s completely useless for me, it would be better to sell these things and earn some points or fuse it to frost fist to increase its mastery.\u201d The loots didn\u2019t have the basic need of the items he wanted, the most basic thing an item he wants to keep is that the item need to be growing as he grows too which mean it can level up as he is, otherwise it would be losing its worth eventually. It is better to sell it now when its worth is at it highest than wait for it.The same thing can be said to the martial arts he get, none of them have the effect that he needs. \u201cThis martial arts didn\u2019t have any good effect on them, but at least the selling price is not bad, but what if I use this thing to level up Dark North Divine Art? Would it be better? That martial arts is the only one that never get to level up in my arsenal.\u201d\u201cOh whatever I guess, better do things I\u2019m sure of first. This frost fist needs to level up!\u201d Yi Tianyun tried to fuse all the weapon he got from the loot into the frost fist.[Would you like to fuse Cold Ice Blade into Frost Fist?]\u201cYes!\u201d[Ding, Fusion succeeded, adding 3,000 Mastery.]\u201cWow, it increased so much mastery in one go, but this item is at the High Grade Spirit level, maybe its normal to have it like this? Hmmm. Better try another one!\u201d Yi Tianyun keeps trying different level of item to combine with Frost Fist, until finally he level it up![Ding, successfully level up Frost Fist to Middle Grade Spirit Tool, next level requires Mastery to be 30.000 points; attack range is increased to 500 meters!]Yi Tianyun is surprised by the increased effect range he got from leveling up the frost fist, encouraging him to use all weapons loot he gpt into mastery point for Frost Fist! Suddenly he remembers something that flared his anger a bit. \u201cI am so stupid! I should have think of something like this for a long time ago. I could have used my own crafted weapon to increase this stupid mastery!\u201d he sighed and proceed to test his theory. \u201cHow much would I get for selling one of them to the system?\u201dHe pulls out one of the weapon he forged in the wind city long time ago and tries to sell it. \u201cSelling High Grade Spirit Sword, obtain 1.000 Crazy Points.\u201d The system sounded in his ears. This announcement proves his theory that the system doesn\u2019t care about how the weapon is obtained. \u201cThis is just the same amount of point as using the roulette to draw a prize, most of the time the prize from the roulette s just a small prize anyway. Well then, more mastery point for me!\u201dHe quickly fuses it into the frost fist.[Would you like to fuse \u2018High Grade Spirit Sword\u2019 into Frost Fist?]\u201cYes!\u201d[Ding, Fusion Succeed into Frost Fist, adding 1.000 Mastery.]Since Frost Fist successfully leveled up into the Middle Grade Spirit level, the amount of mastery received is far less than before but now that he got the cheap way to obtain combine them with, he doesn\u2019t seems to care about the lack of points he get.[Ding, successfully level up Frost Fist to High Grade Spirit Tool, the freezing effect duration, and effectivity doubled! Plus range increased to 600 meters! The next level requires Mastery 50.000 points.]Yi Tianyun keeps combining any weapons he didn\u2019t use with frost fist. He wants to at least make frost fist into soul tool level. He doesn\u2019t even care about the weapon he use for combining anymore. He even uses soul tool grade weapons for fusing material.[Ding, successfully level up Frost Fist to the Lower Grade Soul Tool, the frozen effect enhanced 4 Times, the freezing range is enhanced to one kilometer, attacks within the frozen field, greatly decelerate the movement of any enemies within 2 meters! Next level, requires 200.000 Mastery points!]Yi Tianyun is stunned by this enhanced effect. The effect is just insane, he even got a few extra effect than before.Now after he got what he wanted, he turns his attention into his martial art. \u201cNow, martial arts would be hard to level up obviously, the required amount of mastery is just too much. But still leveling up is much more worth it than to sell the material for just so little amount of crazy points.\u201dHe immediately uses any martial arts he possess that he will never use and fuse it with Dark North Divine Art.[Ding, successfully integrated Soul Suppression Secret Art into Dark North Divine Art increases 20,000 Mastery points!]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[Ding, successfully integrated\u2026]Yi Tianyun keeps combining every martial art that doesn\u2019t have any use to him, even if that martial arts is a high grade martial arts, any martial arts he deemed unnecessary, will be fused into the Dark North Divine Art.[Successfully level up Dark North Divine Art into Middle Grade Earth Level Cultivation Technique doubling the effectiveness of the user skill and ability!

He thinks that this number is just too much, he need to kill many cultivator to level up earlier, now that the war is resolved he doesn\u2019t know how to find huge amount of exp in one go like before.When he look at the armor section, he stops for a while and becomes excited about the armor that he got from the old ancestor he fought before, it\u2019s not just an armor but a whole set. He immediately equips it to see what will happens.[Successfully Equip Chaotic Heaven Divine Armor, Chaotic Heaven Battle Boots, two-piece set bonus: double the Defense Power and double the movement speed.]Yi Tianyun is surprised by the effect given by the set, he quickly combine his Snow Wolf Battle Boots he owned to his Froze Fist. he proceeds to see what else he got, and turns out that he has an axe with the same name as the set. He immediately equips it.The axe suddenly appears in his hand, the axe itself is beautifully made, a reddish axe covered in defensive runes and exerting a primal chaos aura.[Ding, successful Equip Chaotic Heaven Sacred Axe, three-piece set bonus: 2x Defense Power, 3x Movement Speed, 2x Attack Power!]Yi Tianyun gasp after seeing the effects. Not only he gets more speed, but also his defense and attack power is increased significantly. \u201cAmazing!\u201d Yi Tianyun\u2019s eyes sparkled, with this set alone he got 60.000 combat power, he immediately equips his other item, and immediately check his status again.Again, he got surprised, his combat power jumps into a whooping 110.000 points. This is without the buff from Crazy Mode and Dragon God Secret Art, if he used Crazy Mode and Dragon God Secret Art, he possibly could reach around 400.000 or 500.000 at least.\u201cWith this kind of power, even if i fight against Spirit Core expert, I don\u2019t feel like i\u2019ll lose against them. I am sure I can handle them.\u201d He said with confidence.After he is done checking his status, he gets up and walks out of his room to stretch up a bit. Immediately after leaving his room, a disciple quickly approaches him, \u201cElder Yi, you are finally out of your room. I\u2018m here to relay message to you, Palace Lord wants to see you immediately.\u201dThe disciple quickly said. Yi Tianyun is amused by this disciple, she must have been waiting outside of Yi Tianyun\u2019s room untill he comes out.\u201cOk, I\u2019ll immediately go there myself, thanks.\u201d Yi Tianyun smiles to the disciple and walks away to find his aunt. He went to the main hall, where Shi Xueyun usually does her job, and sure enough he sees her there talking to several elders.Shi Xueyun immediately aware of Yi Tianyun presence and says \u201cTianyun, you\u2019ve come!\u201d Yi Tianyun smiles to Shi Xueyun and asks \u201cOf course, since you summon me Palace Lord.\u201d Shi Xueyun is happy to see Yi Tianyun and she immediately informed Yi Tianyun.\u201cWe have finished cleaning after the three great factions, there is nothing left for them, they didn\u2019t have guard to defend their factions as they brought out their best cultivator to attack us. We collected some weapons and pill from all three, and Wing Sect have many materials you can use for forging, and I intend to leave it to you.\u201d\u201cI am okay with that, but it\u2019s better to leave the pills to me too. I\u2019ll help refines them.\u201d Yi Tianyun says to Shi Xueyun. Shi Xueyun is puzzled by Yi Tianyun words and she asks \u201cDid you know Alchemy too? You can refine pill and stuff?\u201dYi Tianyun can\u2019t help but chuckle and says \u201cI am sorry aunt, I forgot to mention it, but I can do alchemy too. I have this treasure to help me refine the pills\u201d he immediately brings out his Purple Fire Divine Furnace and shows it to Shi Xueyun and the elders.They all had a shocked expression in their face. Not only Yi Tianyun have the talent to refine a pill, but he also posseses a very valuable divine tool.\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to ask for my help aunt, I know that after a war, we lose some resources, we obviously need more weapons and pills to strengthen our force.

But now as Yi Tianyun can refine them, they don\u2019t have to face this problem anymore.After thinking for a while Yi Tianyun said: \u201cThe next step we have to take is to help our disciple cultivate faster and try to upgrade Jade Palace to the Second Level Faction.

For now let us focus on refining pill and cultivate the disciple, yes?\u201d Yi Tianyun didn\u2019t want to talk about his circumstances in front of the elders as he doesn\u2019t exactly trust them that much.Shi Xueyun just nods her head as she understand she will be talking to Yi Tianyun later on, and the elders fell silence because they know that they wouldn\u2019t get the answer they want to hear from Yi Tianyun now.Yi Tianyun then excuse himself to start on refining the pills and forging weapons in the workshop. As his level of blacksmithing and alchemy is now good enough, Blacksmith at middle level and Alchemy at basic level, but he is sure that his alchemy would be leveled up into middle level eventually later.He immediately starts by refining all material he gets to make Body Refinement Pills, which is the best pill to have to accelerate the cultivation progress of Body Refinement Cultivator.Yi Tianyun is greatly absorbed is his refining works causing him to lose track of time, and he doesn\u2019t even realize how much pills he already refined.[Ding, successfully refining Body Refinement Pill, earning 3.000 experience, Alchemy Mastery increased by 50 points.][Ding, congratulations to Player \u2018Yi Tianyun \u2018, Basic Level Alchemy successfully Leveled Up to Middle Level Alchemy!]Yi Tianyun is overcome with joy hearing this information \u201cIt finally leveled up!\u201d this middle level alchemy is equal to Fourth Grade Alchemist in this world rank system, which is relatively high by the standard of his age, as very few people are able to achieve this stage at early age.However, he didn\u2019t stop there as he becomes more determined to refines as much pills as he could, his refining speed and success rate already improved with the level up so he could refine at much pace than before.
