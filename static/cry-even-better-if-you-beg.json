The child swallowed when his tanned face, hidden in the shadow of the broad brim, was revealed.For Bill, the child\u2019s reaction was nothing out of the ordinary. Anyone who first saw Bill Remmer usually reacted the same way because of his rugged appearance.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Bill\u2019s face appeared more frightening as he frowned upon the child.\u201cHello, Uncle Bill. I am Leyla Lewellin. I came from Lovita.\u201dThe child spoke clearly and slowly.Lovita\u2026 Bill soon realized why her accent had sounded a little different.\u201cDid you cross the border to the Berg Empire and come here all by yourself?\u201d\u201cYes. I came by train.\u201dThe child smiled awkwardly, as she unnaturally straightened her posture. At that moment, the postman who had brought the child approached them from behind.\u201cAh. This child finally met you, Mr. Remmer.\u201d\u201cGood timing. Why did you bring her here?\u201d\u201cShe was walking all alone with her luggage in front of the station. So, when I asked her where she was going, she said she was on her way to find Bill Remmer, the gardener of the Herhardt family. I brought her here because I was on my way to deliver some letters.\u201dThe postman explained with a smile and handed over an envelope to Bill Remmer. It was a letter from a distant relative living in the neighboring country of Lovita.Bill immediately ripped the envelope open. The letter contained the story of an orphaned child who had previously been taken in by relatives who were now no longer able to foster her because of their \u201cpoor\u201d circumstances.The child\u2019s name was Leyla Lewellin. The little girl standing in front of Bill was the orphan mentioned in the letter.\u201cDamned people. They sure are telling me this news fast.\u201dAstonished, Bill lost his breath. No one in Lovita could foster this little orphan. Bill Remmer was the last among those who had a direct connection with the child. So they had delivered the child to him.According to the letter, Bill could leave the child in the orphanage if his situation was not favorable enough for raising her.Bill grumbled and tossed the crumpled paper to the floor. \u201cThese people should go to hell. I don\u2019t understand how they could send this little girl here all by herself.\u201dAs he understood the full extent of the situation, Bill\u2019s face turned red with outrage. The child was treated like a mere toy, passed from one relative to another, and doomed to be dumped when no one else desired her. Eventually, she was sent off to a foreign country and given the address of a distant relative she had never met.\u201cExcuse me, Uncle Bill. I am not that young.\u201dThe little girl who had been observing Bill quietly suddenly spoke up.\u201cI\u2019ll be twelve in a couple of weeks.\u201dBill chuckled with delight as he listened to her rather mature manner of speech. He felt reassured when he learned that she was older than expected, considering the girl looked smaller than her age.After the postman who had delivered the troublesome girl left, the two were left alone in the garden. Bill covered his head with his hands and prayed to God for help.Although they were distant relatives, from afar, they seemed more like a father and his daughter. Bill had not seen his distant relatives in over 20 years, but now he was trapped with a child he had never known existed until today.Even though it was chilly outside, the child wore only a thin layer of clothing. She looked as skinny as an iron-skewer. Her lime green eyes and gold-threaded hair were all Bill could see of her.Bill came to a conclusion; He couldn\u2019t take care of her.However, the only choice then was to place her in an orphanage, which drove him crazy. Bill cursed the relatives a second time for dragging him into this mess. The little girl flinched and began chewing her red lips.\u201cFollow me.\u201d Bill led the way as he shook his head in frustration. \u201cLet us get some food first before I make a decision.\u201dHis blunt words were carried away by the evening breeze. The child\u2019s timid steps gradually became light and joyful as the two walked closer to Bill\u2019s quarters.***\u201cIs that all you\u2019re eating?\u201dThe child was carrying a small plate, which Bill frowned at.\u201cYes. I only eat a little.\u201dThe child smiled politely.\u201cChild, I hate children who eat very little.\u201dThe light from the table lamp shone down on the child\u2019s slender wrist, which was revealed under the sleeve that had been carelessly folded up.\u201cYou should eat everything like a cow.\u201dBill\u2019s face became more stern. Slowly blinking her eyes, the troubled Leyla put another loaf of meat and bread onto her plate and hurriedly started gobbling up her food.\u201cI can\u2019t eat like a cow, but uncle, I can eat quite well.\u201d Leyla showed a broad smile with bread crumbs strewn over her dainty lips.\u201cYes. I can definitely see that.\u201d Bill laughed and poured the whiskey into his tall glass. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of me?\u201d Bill\u2019s face was scrunched up as he attempted to frighten her.But Leyla just simply stared at him, not daring to look away. \u201cNot at all.\u201d She said. \u201cYou don\u2019t yell at me. You gave me lots of delicious food. So I believe you to be a good person.\u201d\u2018What kind of life has this child been living?\u2019Bill pondered as he refilled his beer glass. The letter had stated that the child\u2019s mother had abandoned her husband and child to elope with another man. The child\u2019s father, who had been devastated by the betrayal, became an alcoholic and died of alcohol poisoning. Following that, the girl was raised in the homes of other relatives, only to be abandoned by them in the end.Although the child had lived a tragic life, Bill still thought it was a ridiculous idea for him to be the one to raise her.Bill Remmer sipped his beer and decided that he would make his decision by next week.***\u201cDid everyone hear? Bill Remmer, the gardener, has started taking care of a young girl.\u201dA young maid dashed into the lounge where the servants spent their leisure time. The servants who had been taking a break turned their attention to the young maid.\u201cA girl? Mr. Remmer? It\u2019d be more reasonable if he chose to raise a lion or elephant instead.\u201dOne of the servants made a snorting noise.Bill Remmer, the Herhardt household\u2019s gardener, was a man who possessed a natural talent for growing flowers. Despite his brusque temper, he had been able to keep his job as a gardener for the past 20 years, all thanks to his talent.He was deeply trusted by the Herhardt family. Especially Norma, the duchess. Because of her unique love of flowers, she understood and accepted Bill\u2019s gardening as well as tantrums. She also decided to give the gardener a cottage in the woods behind the manor house of Herhardt.Life was easy for Bill Remmer.He worked in the garden and returned to the cottage for a rest. Despite his time drinking with his fellow workers, he spent most of his time surrounded by flowers and trees. Even after his wife died of an illness decades earlier, he never got attached to another woman.That Bill Remmer was raising a little girl?The servants who were relaxing in the lounge came to an agreement that the rumor was utter nonsense.Until one of the maids sitting by the window shouted,\u201cOh my. It must be true! Look over there.\u201dThe maid pointed over the glass window with her eyes wide open. The servants all rushed to the window at the same time and their faces lit up with surprise. Bill Remmer was planting with his body hunched down on the other side of the garden, and the rumored petite girl was following in his footsteps.As she churned along, the girl\u2019s golden hair, braided in a single strand, shook back and forth like a pendulum.\u201cI\u2019ve still not decided.\u201dBill repeatedly gave the same answer to any questions about the child.\u201cI can\u2019t leave her here, so I\u2019ll have to think about it.\u201dWhile Bill\u2019s thoughts went on through the spring and into the summer, Leyla Lewellin slowly became a permanent resident of the Herhardt estate.The child\u2019s diligent stroll through the gardens and forests had already become a familiar scene for the Herhardt servants.\u201cI think she\u2019s grown a bit.\u201d The Herhardt\u2019s chef, Madam Mona, laughed as she stared out the window. Leyla was staring at the grass and flowers behind the forest cottage that were just starting to bloom.\u201cShe still has a long way to go. She\u2019s still smaller than average girls.\u201d\u201cBill Remmer, take a look at her. Kids are not the same as your plants. They aren\u2019t going to grow in a day or two.\u201d Madam Mona lowered her basket onto the table with a shake of her head.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cCookies and cake. There was a tea party at the manor yesterday.\u201d\u201cI hate sweets.\u201d\u201cReally? This is for Leyla\u201dBill Remmer\u2019s dark brows furrowed at Madam Mona\u2019s abrupt response. That child was not supposed to be here, but the Duke\u2019s servants had started to look after Leyla daily.They would greet her, bring her food, and sometimes pay her a visit, and Bill Remmer was having a tough time dealing with it.\u201cYou should buy some clothes for her. The young lady\u2019s skirt seems to be about to go up her knees now.\u201d Madam Mona asked him as she watched Leyla chasing a bird. Bill was unable to refute. Even in his eyes, it seemed as if Leyla was wearing unfitted clothes.\u201cOh my! Oh my! Look at her!\u201dMadam Mona was about to leave when she quickly pointed to Leyla and shouted in dismay.Bill cast a queer glance in the direction Madam Mona was pointing. As the bird she had been chasing landed on a tree branch, Leyla began climbing up the tree swiftly, with athletic and light movements like a squirrel.\u201cShe sure has a talent for climbing trees.\u201dBill\u2019s unconcerned response drew a scowl from Madam Mona. \u201cBill Remmer! You were aware of her habit of climbing trees and yet you chose to overlook it? How the hell are you raising your child?\u201d\u201cAs you can see, she\u2019s growing strong and well.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re raising that girl like a wild beast! My God.\u201d Madam Mona raised her voice and made a fuss. But Bill just snooped around the window deafeningly. He watched Leyla sit on a thin branch in the thicket, looking at the little birds playing around.After watching over her for a few months, Leyla Lewellin had proven to be a curious girl who wanted to learn more about the world. Flowers and grass, birds and insects. Anything that caught her attention amazed her and piqued her curiosity.One night when Leyla hadn\u2019t returned for dinner, Bill had gone deep into the forest to find her sitting by the river staring at a flock of water birds. She had been so engrossed in her observation that she hadn\u2019t even noticed Bill calling her name over and over.Madam Mona had returned home after giving him a couple of more scathing lectures. After that, Bill took a leisurely stroll and went back to his cottage.\u201cUncle!\u201d Leyla welcomed him with a friendly wave.The child came down the tree as quickly as she had climbed it and hurriedly approached Bill. Leyla was dressed in a ragged, dull gray one-piece dress with short sleeves. Since she was going to meet the duke later, her hand-me-down dresses seemed inappropriate, so Bill decided to buy her new clothes.\u201cGet ready and come out.\u201d Bill said impulsively when they arrived in front of the back door cottage.\u201cAh. Uncle?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look so puzzled. We\u2019re going downtown to buy you some clothes.\u201d Bill coughed and uncomfortably rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cDuke Herhardt will be here soon, so welcoming him in your current appearance would be a little weird.\u201d\u201cThe duke? You mean the owner of this estate, right?\u201d\u201cYes. Since it\u2019s his break, he\u2019ll be back.\u201d\u201cBreak? Does the duke attend school?\u201d Leyla tilted her head, frowning. Bill smiled as he stroked the child\u2019s unruly hair.\u201cThe duke is only 18 years old so he has no choice but to attend school.\u201d\u201cWhat?!! 18 years old? The duke?\u201dBill\u2019s guffaw grew louder in reaction to the child\u2019s shocked expression. He brushed the child\u2019s fluffy hair with his rough fingertips. It felt as soft as cotton.***At the Carlsbar station, a train from the capital had arrived on the platform.The waiting servants made their way to the station\u2019s private section. A tall, slender boy descended onto the platform by the time they lined up in a straight line.\u201cHello, Master.\u201dAll the other servants quickly bowed their heads towards the boy, starting with the butler Hessen\u2019s friendly greeting. Matthias replied to their greetings with a light yet silent gesture in a straight and elegant manner. His rosy lips were curved into a smile that was neither too wide nor too stiff.The Herhardt\u2019s servants didn\u2019t start moving until Matthias took a couple of moves. The people in the crowd stood back quickly, allowing the young master to pass through. Matthias walked past the platform at a quick pace, showing no signs of slowing down.\u201cA carriage?\u201d Matthias smirked as he left the station and spotted a carriage waiting for him.\u201cAh\u2026.. Yes, master. Madam doesn\u2019t believe cars are trustworthy.\u201d\u201cI know. For grandmother, cars are nothing more than a hunk of iron that is unbearably vulgar and dangerous.\u201d\u201cMy apologies. Next time\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. \u2018Classic\u2019 things are not bad. Once in a while.\u201dMatthias boarded the carriage in a composed manner. Slow but steady movements flowed from his long arms and legs.As it passed through the busy shopping streets and the square, the carriage consistently picked up speed.Matthias\u2019 luggage was transported in a separate wagon, which trailed behind the carriage engraved with a golden crest off into the distance.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a social gathering meant to discuss insurance issues for the trade ship sailing next month.Matthias sat in the back of the carriage, staring out of the window. His butler, Hessen, briefed him about the pending problems of his family. He responded to Hessen\u2019s words with just quick nods or brief replies.The business was run by the directors, and although Matthias\u2019 mother and grandmother were in charge of the family affairs, it was up to him as the Duke of Herhardt to make the final decision. Matthias had been playing that role since he was a child of twelve.Hessen\u2019s report had ended by the time Matthias arrived on the Platanus road leading to the Herhardt estate.Matthias was seated with his head tilted at an angle, gazing at the familiar scenery. Both sides of the roadway were lined with tall trees that were arched as if they were holding hands. The path was embroidered with an exquisite pattern designed by the shattered sunlight leaping through the fluttering leaves.A white mansion with a blue-coloured rooftop revealed itself after passing through the road into the estate. Outside the front entrance, the mother and grandmother were waiting for their family patriarch. The door to the wagon opened as Matthias straightened the position of his already linear tie.\u201cWelcome home, Matthias.\u201dNorma Catharina von Herhardt, Dowager Duchess of Arvis, smiled brightly when she welcomed her grandson.Matthias bowed his head and accepted a kiss from his grandmother.He was approached with a much more straightforward attitude by Elysee von Herhardt, his mother, who stood behind them.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown taller.\u201d She chuckled as she embraced him warmly. Her dark black hair gleamed in the early summer light, much like her son\u2019s.Matthias responded to his mother with the same smile. He shared similar greetings with the other servants in line. His polished manner and proper courtesy towards the servants showed that he was the perfect owner of this family,\u2014He was Duke Herhardt.Matthias took the lead and crossed the lobby area, standing between his two beloved women. He suddenly lifted his head and stared up at the huge chandelier that was lit up in the middle of the day before climbing the stairs.Matthias looked at the Herhardt family\u2019s crest that was imprinted on the ceiling just below the chandelier.He was a Herhardt.Herhardt, a euphemism for intellect, grace, and unflappable character. Matthias had never had any complaints or concerns regarding his own life. He was well aware of the kind of life he would have to live and accepted it. Handling his own life was as easy as breathing for him.Matthias ascended the stairwell with long strides with his eyes fixed on the ground. The servants were finally able to breathe properly after the owner of the household entered the mansion safely.The residents of Arvis had been preparing for days to meet Duke Herhardt in person. On his arrival, everything and everyone, including the people who lived in his estate, had to be flawless. The servants needed to present themselves in the best light possible.Leyla Lewellin, the Arvis\u2019 uninvited guest, wasn\u2019t any different.***\u201cDid the duke already arrive?\u201dStanding at the edge of the group of servants, Leyla murmured something in a disappointed tone. The creamy-white colour dress Bill had purchased for her flapped in sync with her movements.\u201cYou\u2019ll see Duke Herhardt in the woods. But I have to ask for permission first.\u201d Bill Remmer spoke bluntly and began walking towards the woods. Leyla followed him at the back with zeal.\u201cDoes the duke enjoy the woods as much as I do?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah sure. Hunting is one of his favorite activities.\u201d\u201cHunting? In the woods?\u201d Leyla\u2019s pupils dilated, and her eyes widened. As he looked down at the child, Bill snorted.\u201cIsn\u2019t it natural for the forest to be the hunting ground for this family?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 does he hunt birds too?\u201d\u201cUpland hunting is the Duke\u2019s favorite pastime.\u201dHis irrelevant comment caused Leyla to halt in her stride. Bill coughed reflexively after realizing what he had said. He tried lying to her to convince her, but Duke Herhardt was due to arrive on the hunting grounds in a few days. He was concerned that if he tried to comfort the child with his white lies, he would cause Leyla even more distress.\u201cWhen you see the Duke\u2019s shooting skills, you\u2019ll be astonished. He\u2019s only a teenager, but he\u2019s a fantastic sharpshooter.\u201d Bill started to babble because he felt compelled to say something to comfort the young girl. But Leyla, on the other hand, was on the verge of crying.\u201cWhy does he like killing birds? There\u2019s lots of food in the mansion\u2026\u201d\u201cHunting is merely a means of recreation for the nobles. The most entertaining targets to shoot are birds, and\u2026\u201d Bill turned around to face Leyla after realizing what he had said, and Leyla\u2019s upset expression came into his gaze.\u2018Why do you like birds so much?!\u2019Bill was on the verge of yelling something at the top of his lungs. He didn\u2019t understand why he was bothering to explain something to her while still having to be sensitive to the child\u2019s feelings. Bill eventually chose to remain silent because Leyla seemed to be about to cry if he said even one more word.The sobbing Leyla.He hated seeing children crying.Bill continued to walk again after a brief pause. Leyla\u2019s shoulders were limp as she followed in his footsteps. The same child who had been excited to wear her new ivory-coloured dress was gone. It had been quite a sight to see her feeling so agitated about the dress she just received.\u201cI\u2019m hoping the duke shows a dislike for hunting.\u201dAfter a long period of silence, she spoke up cautiously.\u201cOr maybe he\u2019ll get tired of hunting?\u201d Leyla looked up at Bill, her eyes sparkling with hope. But Bill could only scratch the back of his neck sheepishly as a response.Leyla was optimistic that her prayers would be fulfilled.***Matthias was nowhere to be found near the hunting grounds a week after his return. He was busy tending to the guests who had flocked to the mansion to see him, so it was understandable.The mansion was filled with clamorous parties every day, but the woods were deafeningly quiet. As the summer had come to an end, the eggs hatched, and the wild roses, which had been in the early stages of flowering, were now wholly bloomed. Leyla was enthralled by the minor changes taking place in the woods.\u201cLeyla, don\u2019t go too far!\u201d Bill raised his voice when Leyla excitedly left the cottage.\u201cAlright! I\u2019m just going for a stroll along the river! Uncle, I\u2019ll see you later!\u201dAs she turned around, Leyla swung her arms frantically above her head. Her old leather bag, which she slung over her shoulder, shook along with her as she jumped.Leyla was the first person to discover the newly hatched birds on a tree branch. The hairless baby birds were eagerly awaiting their mother\u2019s arrival with their food. She scampered down from the tree and drew the picture of the baby birds on a scrap of paper which she pulled from her leather bag. Although her sketches were a little messy, she tried her hardest to portray the tiny birds in her drawings.In her little diary, Leyla drew and wrote about everything she had seen in the woods. The land was more majestic than any other location she had ever seen. Leyla decided to jot down everything she saw. This was because she wanted to look back on her memories from the woods in her diary, after her departure from this mansion. She was saddened by the thought of leaving the place one day.Leyla kept a steady record of the forest as she walked along the path leading to the river. She strewed pastel-coloured flower petals between the pages of her notebook and picked some strawberries along the way.The sun was just starting to settle when she arrived at the glistening riverbank. Leyla climbed to the peak of a giant tree that stood at the forest\u2019s edge, overlooking the river. Her favourite spot was a thick, long branch of the tree because it was as comfortable as a chair.A faint clink of horseshoes could be heard from afar when Leyla was about to open her notebook. She stuffed her journal into her pocket as quickly as she could. In the meantime, the horse\u2019s galloping sound became louder. Leyla held her breath while hugging the tree branch she was lying down on, terrified of the approaching intruder.A horse with smooth dark hazel fur appeared not long after that. On its back, there was a man. He chose to rest his horse right under the tree, where Leyla was lying among all the places in the woods. From the moment that man had stepped off the horse, his movements had been smooth and light.She thought it best to climb down, but the mysterious man was already leaning against the tree.Leyla couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say, so she just looked at the man who was lifting his hand to remove his hat. But at that moment, Leyla\u2019s leather bag fell off her shoulders and slammed into the branch. For the next few seconds, her memory became hazy. The man reflectively turned his head towards the tree branch and met eyes with Leyla.Leyla locked her gaze with his. His blue eyes were like clear glass beads, visible through the thick black hair that flowed over his forehead. By the time she tried to gather herself together, the man was already pointing his gun at her face.The thought of being shot by the long, menacing gun made Leyla\u2019s face turn pale. She remained motionless, hugging the tree as though it were her only friend. Her entire body was trembling with sweat.Slowly, the man lowered his pistol and let out a silent sigh.\u201cWho are you\u2026..?\u201dHis twisted lips emitted a low, resonant voice.\u201c\u2026..Leyla.\u201dAs her golden hair fluttered in the wind, Leyla managed to keep her voice from breaking, even though she was on the verge of tears.\u201cWhat?\u201d His pupils dilated even further, and Leyla hugged the tree so tightly that it hurt her fingertips.\u201cLeyla. I\u2019m Leyla Lewellin.\u201d***\u201cUncle! Uncle Bill!\u201dThe sound of Leyla\u2019s cry echoed through the woods.Bill sat in front of his cottage warehouse, watching the sun setting down. At Leyla\u2019s frantic call, he turned his head in bewilderment and looked at Leyla, who ran towards him with a crimson red face.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cTh-there\u2019s a man in the woods! He was very tall!\u201d Despite her abdominal pain, Leyla was excited to narrate her encounter with the mysterious man.\u201cYou must\u2019ve met the duke who came out for hunting.\u201dBill replied while picking up the tools from the warehouse.\u201cHis hair was jet black, and his eyes were a deep shade of blue. His voice sounded as light as a feather.\u201dBill smirked with a snarl, \u201cWithout a doubt, it\u2019s Duke Herhardt.\u201dLeyla stood in front of Bill, trying to catch her breath.For a while, the stunning yet scary man in the distance had stared at Leyla and then turned away without saying anything. When he mounted his horse again, two more men appeared in the dense forest. The man turned his horse and followed the other two men further into the woods. When they were no longer visible, Leyla climbed down from the trees and fled to the cottage.\u201cThen the Duke\u2026..\u201dBang!Just as Leyla was about to say something, a cold shot suddenly rang out, shaking the stillness of the forest.Startled, Leyla turned her head towards the source of the noise. She soon witnessed surprised birds arising from the far side of the woods. One of the birds fell from the trees, with its wings drooped helplessly. The shots went on for a couple more rounds. So Bill patted Leyla on her shoulder to comfort the frightened child.\u201cLeyla.\u201dLeyla lifted her head with a long, deliberate motion. Bill unknowingly held his breath once their eyes met.The little one was sobbing.***The beautiful bird slayer.Leyla Lewellin decided to give him that title.Everyone in the estate, including Bill Remmer, praised him for being the epitome of royalty. Matthias von Herhardt, who had exceptional qualities as the owner of this duchy, seemed to be loved and cared for by the people.But not Leyla.The mother bird had been missing since the day the Duke went out hunting. The newly hatched baby birds were separated from their mother, who fed them with food. Moreover, countless birds were no longer to be seen in the woods.Why did the duke only hunt the tiny, beautiful birds instead of big, edible ones?Leyla, who had been watching and agonizing over this for the past month, seemed to have figured out why.For Duke Herhardt, the birds had become his moving target.The smaller they were, the more challenging and fascinating it was to shoot them. The Duke didn\u2019t even try to glance at the prey he had just killed.On the days he went out hunting, after hitting his target, he would simply turn away, and Leyla would always bury the dead birds that were soaked in blood.Bang-Another round of gunfire could be heard in the distance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leyla sat down bundled in a blanket with her arms wrapped around her knees. Meanwhile, Bill and the other gardeners were busy digging up the wilting rose tree.The roses in the garden behind the mansion seemed to be of varying kinds. The rose was said to be the Berg Empire\u2019s national flower, as well as a favorite of the Duke\u2019s mother and grandmother.The little Leyla wandered around the cottage nervously after hearing another sound of a gunshot from the woods.\u00a0 Uncle Bill had noticed her nervousness and wanted to take her to the garden with him. Only when the sound of gunfire faded away did her mind finally calm down.\u2018Is it really okay for me to take a nap as Uncle Bill toils away in the hot sun?\u2019Bill drew an uneasy stare from Leyla. She let out a slight sigh as she slowly closed her eyes. But Bill had threatened her that he\u2019d become angry if she helped him. He also told her that he despised children who refused to listen. So, she opted to wait for him until he finished his work, even though Leyla\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t at ease.When she opened her eyes again with reluctance, Leyla was suddenly startled by an unfamiliar figure. In front of her stood a well-dressed teenage boy who seemed to be about Leyla\u2019s age.\u201cHello.\u201dAs their gazes met, the good-looking boy with platinum blonde hair greeted her with a lovely smile.\u201cDo you live here?\u201dThe fellow boy surveyed his surroundings and asked humbly.\u201cYes. I live with uncle Bill.\u201dLeyla replied with her eyes squinted.\u201cMr. Bill? Do you mean the scary gardener guy?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not scary.\u201d\u201cReally? He seems like a scary person to me.\u201dThe boy sat down next to Leyla with a tilted head.\u201cAnd you? Do you live here too?\u201dThe boy chuckled and shook his head when Leyla asked him cautiously.\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0He said.\u00a0\u201cI just followed my father. He\u2019s the family doctor at the Herhardt household. He\u2019s come to see Madam Norma for a medical checkup. I sometimes come here with my father. Madam Norma said she was okay.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cTwelve.\u201d\u201cSame. But you\u2019re kinda tiny.\u201dThe boy who was looking at Leyla started laughing and Leyla\u2019s cheeks began to blush bright red with anger.\u201cYou\u2019re tiny too.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m the tallest student in my class.\u201dTo show his tall stature, the boy stretched out his body. Certainly, he seemed to be a couple of inches taller than his actual age.\u201cHowever\u2026 You\u2019re still not as tall as uncle Bill.\u201dLeyla muttered to herself, causing the boy to giggle once more. He seemed to be a cheerful kid.\u201cHey, finding a child or even an adult taller than Mr. Bill is impossible.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201dFor no apparent reason, Leyla plucked at the grass growing near her blanket and her tiny fingers became soiled with a bluish-green color. She wished the boy would get up and leave immediately, but he showed no signs of doing so.Leyla then shifted her attention to the peach poised on the blanket\u2019s edge and asked the boy at the spur of the moment.\u201cDo you want some?\u201dAs the boy smiled and nodded happily, Leyla dug into her leather pocket and took out a small knife. The sight of Leyla carefully cutting the peach made the boy chuckle.\u201cYou\u2019re funny. Why is a knife coming out of a girl\u2019s bag?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me. Uncle Bill gave it to me.\u201dAs she handed the half-cut peach to the boy, Leyla drooped her nose slightly in annoyance. But the two children\u2019s noses were tingling with the delicious smell of the peach fruit.\u201cHow come you have such a sad look on your face? Has something happened?\u201dAfter gulping down his peach, the boy asked her gently.\u201cThe Duke and his friends keep hunting down the birds in the woods.\u201dLeyla answered solemnly. The young boy cocked his head, perplexed by her words..\u201cSo, what\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\u201cThey are killing birds for their own pleasure.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t hunting like that?\u201d\u201cDo you think so too?\u201dLeyla stared at the boy with her grim green pupils. In her eyes, the boy seemed to have difficulty holding the big, long hunting rifle.\u201cUh\u2026.. No.\u201dThe boy quickly shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t. It\u2019s cruel.\u201dHearing his positive reply, Leyla\u2019s face started to light up with a smile.\u201cDo you want another peach?\u201dLeyla asked with a more bright tone. The boy then smiled and nodded. Leyla halved another peach and gave the larger half to him. The boy\u2019s cheeks appeared to blush as he tried to fix his tight collar.\u201cKyle! Kyle!\u201dThe sound of a faint voice could be heard. The boy, who had been fiddling with a peach seed, hurriedly leapt to his feet.\u201cI have to go now.\u201d\u201cOkay. Bye then.\u201d\u201cKyle Etman.\u201dHe raised his hands.\u201cIt\u2019s my name. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cLeyla. I\u2019m Leyla Lewellin.\u201dLeyla gave him a clumsy handshake. The two shook hands with their tiny hands soaked in sticky peach honey, as if they were making a truce.\u201cBye, Leyla. See ya. Next time, I\u2019ll get you something more tasty!\u201dThe boy shouted aloud as he ran away into the distance. Leyla just gave a slight wave because she wasn\u2019t sure whether she\u2019d see him again if she moved out of the estate.***Leyla\u2019s world was once again at peace after Kyle had left. She sat patiently waiting for Uncle Bill to finish his job while smelling the rose-scented fragrance. However, she had dozed off at some point and only woke up when Uncle Bill called her name at sunset.Leyla jumped out of her seat, packed her bag, and picked up the blanket from the ground.\u201cUncle Bill. I saw a kid\u2026.\u201dLeyla was about to tell the story of her meeting with the boy with whom she had shared her peaches. However, at that moment, she was interrupted by silhouettes of people coming out of the forest on the other side, who turned out to be Duke Herhardt and his friends.Matthias came to a halt in the middle of the rose garden. Bill Remmer, the brusque gardener who was nearby, bowed his head towards his master. Matthias didn\u2019t take long to notice that the gardener was hiding a small child behind him.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen each other, Mr. Remmer.\u201dMatthias gave a slight nod. His friends who had accompanied him in the hunting expedition ground came to a standstill behind the duke and maintained their distance.\u201cAh, for the time being, she\u2019ll be staying here at Arvis.\u201dBill Remmer told the Duke with a somewhat uneasy look on his face. Leyla took a hesitant step towards the Duke after Bill tapped her on the back and ordered her to come forward.Matthias was able to recognize her because of her glimmering blond hair. It was the little girl he had almost shot. The weird little girl who was almost killed because she had been mistaken for a bird.\u201cI already have Madam Norma and Madam Elysse\u2019s permission, but I think I should also ask for your approval.\u201dBill Remmer bowed his head once more, and Leyla, who stood beside him, followed suit.Matthias took a long, good look at the girl. The child scowled at him when they exchanged glances. Lips clenched combined with sneered green eyes. Her expression was the same as when they had first met in the woods.\u201cAh, you\u2019re that girl, right?\u201d\u00a0He asked,\u00a0\u201cThe little girl who lives in the woods.\u201dLelya\u2019s face blushed with embarrassment and she hid behind her uncle\u2019s back. Riette, Matthias\u2019 cousin, guffawed from behind, recalling the girl they occasionally met in the forest was always like that.That girl would always hide behind a tree as soon as she gazed at the duke\u2019s eyes in wonder. She would always come out of nowhere and bury the dead birds after Matthias would finish hunting.\u201cSure. If that\u2019s what you want, Mr. Remmer.\u201dWith a grin on his face, Matthias gave a quick answer since it was none of his business what the gardener raised in the woods.\u201cThank you, my Lord.\u201dBill expressed his gratitude to him. Matthias started walking again after giving Bill a small nod with his chin.After the Duke passed them, Leyla flinched when she saw Matthias\u2019 servants following him with their hands full of hunted animals. Her shoulders hunched and she drew her eyes close at the moment when her tiny nose was filled with a strong, distasteful smell of blood.Standing beside her, uncle Bill only could pat Leyla\u2019s frail shoulders with his big-warm hands.***With her chin resting on the palm of her hand, Claudine let out a long, deep sigh. Her curly brown hair danced along in sync with her endless sighs.\u201cClaudine, behave like a lady please.\u201dRaising her thin eyebrows, Countess Brandt cast a look at her daughter. Her inarticulate voice became increasingly impatient.Claudine was about to become the Duchess of Arvis, despite the fact that she was much too young to be called a lady. Countess Brandt could only let out a heavy sigh, looking at her daughter\u2019s childish attitude.\u201cBut I\u2019m so lonely and bored.\u201dClaudine muttered something under her breath. The other noblewomen at the tea table who were drinking tea turned their focus to the depressed brown-haired girl.\u201cThen go play with your cousins.\u201dCountess Brandt wheezed with her face reddened. Claudine, on the other hand, paid no attention to her angry mother.\u201cThey treat me as if I\u2019m not here. They say things I don\u2019t understand.\u201dClaudine\u2019s annoyed expression elicited a soft smile from other ladies.\u201cWell, it can be boring. Claudine doesn\u2019t have any friends her age.\u201dElysse von Herhardt nodded her head while stroking the white dog on her lap.\u201cSee? Madam Herhardt is the only one who understands me.\u201dA bright smile rose on Claudine\u2019s lips, when she met someone who understood her distress.\u201cAnyways, who\u2019s that child?\u201dClaudine abruptly pointed her finger towards the garden after catching a quick glimpse of a young girl. Claudine gestured to the ladies to turn their heads in the direction she was pointing.To a young girl who was taking a stroll with a gardener.\u201cDo you mind if I play with her? I think she\u2019s about the same age as me.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Isn\u2019t she an orphan from another country? A girl like that isn\u2019t suited to be friends with you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine\u2014-\u201d\u00a0Claudine said,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019ll be more fun playing with her rather than a puppy.\u201dShe spoke with a calm and confident tone. Her mother\u2019s red face, which was about to burst with embarrassment, went unnoticed by her.Elysse von Herhardt smiled and rang the doorbell cheerfully.\u201cBring that child here.\u201dA maid came to the room at the call of her master\u2019s bell.\u201cThe child who\u2019s being raised by our gardener.\u201d***Leyla was taken to an unknown world by the maid. To the place where glamorous people sat under the shade of the white mansion, dressed in bright-colored clothing.\u201cOh, she\u2019s so cute.\u201dLeyla earned a compliment from one of the ladies.\u201cCan you tell me what you think? Claudine, do you like her?\u201dAfter questioning Leyla, the black-haired woman turned over to the chestnut-haired girl sitting beside her. Claudine smiled and nodded happily.\u201cThank you, Madam Herhardt.\u201dLeyla looked at the people in front of her with a blank stare on her face. She couldn\u2019t figure out what the ladies were talking about. She just wanted to return to Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage, but no one seemed to understand her dilemma.The maid took Leyla\u2019s hand and walked her into a room after one of the ladies murmured an order.For the first time in her life, Leyla was washed in a luxurious bathroom, and to her surprise, she was clothed in soft, white dresses. Leyla sensed the pain as the maid combed her frizzy hair roughly. But she endured it, because she was afraid she would hinder Uncle Bill\u2019s job if she said anything wrong.\u201cLady Claudine is Count Brandt\u2019s daughter. So don\u2019t act rashly in front of her. Do you understand?\u201dLeyla gave a befuddled nod when she was sternly alerted by the maid who dragged her up to the second floor of the mansion. After that, the parlor\u2019s door was carefully opened by the maid. There, Claudine welcomed them with a refined manner.\u201cHello. What\u2019s your name? And your Age?\u201dClaudine lowered her head and tried to look Leyla in the eyes.\u201cMy name is Leyla Lewellin. I\u2019m twelve years old.\u201d\u201cReally? Because you\u2019re so tiny, I thought you were younger.\u201dAlthough Leyla disliked being called \u2018tiny\u2019, she decided to keep her annoyance to herself.\u2018For uncle Bill.\u2019She was able to calm down as she chanted those words over and over again, almost as if they were a ritual.Flower arrangement, Piano, and Music.Claudine suggested this and that, but Leyla couldn\u2019t do anything.Dice game. Word game. Chess.Claudine\u2019s other ideas for alternative games were the same.Claudine\u2019s mouth curved into a vague smile as she alternated between looking at the toy table and at Leyla.\u201cPoor you.\u201dShe slowly rose from her chair with a disappointed sigh in her voice.\u201cYou don\u2019t know a thing.\u201dLeyla felt helpless as she looked at the jumbled up toys on the table. Claudine murmured in frustration as she walked over to Leyla\u2019s chair. But Leyla was humiliated even more by her gentle voice, which seemed to be trying hard to not convey even the slightest hint of disappointment or irritation.Leyla felt compelled to say something, but she couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s because her mouth was shut tight. It was difficult to say something polite in this situation. But fortunately, Claudine turned away without waiting for Leyla to say anything.\u201cGeez\u2026 She\u2019s no better than a dog.\u201dShe whispered a sigh to herself before closing the door.Leyla was left alone in the beautiful parlor after Claudine had left. She was tempted to leave as soon as possible as well, but Leyla decided to wait because she thought Claudine would come back.But Claudine didn\u2019t return until the afternoon sun began turning into a golden hue. The maid who had brought Leyla only showed up later in the evening.\u201cYou may go back.\u201dShe spoke in a softer tone than before.\u201cThe lady said you can keep the dress. And this as well.\u201dLeyla froze in place when the maid gave a glittering gold coin to her. So the maid shoved the coin into Leyla\u2019s hands.\u201cJust take it. You should be thankful for what your master gives you. Do you understand?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2727After a Long Time\u2727Leyla stepped out of the mansion just as the sky began turning a rose-tinted colour and was welcomed by a soothing wind as she exited the rose garden entrance.Leyla walked confidently, clutching a gold coin in her right hand. Her bold steps, however, didn\u2019t last too long when she saw Claudine sitting under the pergola near the full-bloom flower roses.\u00a0 The brunette-haired girl was having a fun conversation with her cousins, and she gave a vague smile when her gaze fell on Leyla\u2019s.\u201cGoodbye, Leyla.\u201dClaudine was the one who greeted her first. The young men sitting next to Claudine all looked at Leyla with their gazes drawn to her. But thankfully, Duke Herhardt wasn\u2019t among them. So Leyla quickly replied with a single bow to her farewell, but Claudine remained silent.After she was out of their sight, Leyla began to run. She couldn\u2019t wait to escape from the weird and unknown world and get back to Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage as soon as she could. But it seemed her worst misfortune came at the very last moment.Leyla tripped at the crosswalk of the garden and the forest path. Her gold coin mockingly rolled down the paving stone and landed on the tip of a man\u2019s shoe. She frowned at the spinning gold coin, and the man lightly stepped on the coin with the tip of his shoe to quell its tinkling sounds.Leyla moved her eyes slowly to the well-polished shoes, up to the long legs, and finally to the man\u2019s face that loomed upon her.It was Duke Herhardt.Leyla startled and immediately sprang to her feet. Her white dress had blood and dust stains from her scratched knee. With a composed expression on his face, the Duke clearly stared at Leyla with his red lips, which seemed to be slightly curved to one side.Leyla pressed her lips together and brushed the dust from her clothes. Meanwhile, Duke Herhardt took a leisurely step back, then the coin under his foot shone brightly, reflecting the sunshine.Leyla hunkered down her body in front of the Duke, even though she wanted to leave the place right away.\u00a0 Just as she was about to stretch out her arms to take the coin, She remembered what she had been told by Claudine.\u2018No better than a dog.\u2019Those words had scratched a deep wound in Leyla\u2019s heart. She took the coin and politely bowed to Duke Herhardt.Leyla didn\u2019t dare to lift her head. So all she could do was stoop her head as low as she could and hold her breath. As she bowed, surprisingly, the pain she felt when she fell was no longer there.Leyla left the Duke and continued her run. Because of her injured knee, she couldn\u2019t run as fast as she could before. At the same time, she kept pushing her bloodied legs; she felt something sprouting from the bottom of her heart to the tip of her throat.Leyla realized what it was after passing through the forest path and facing the light from the cottage.It was sadness.***\u201cI\u2019ll give this for you, uncle.\u201dBill\u2019s hairy brows grew to wrinkle when Leyla put out the gold coin to Bill in a hushed way, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cA gold coin.\u201d\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d\u201cLady Claudine gave it to me.\u201d\u201cClaudine? Ah, that little noble lady.\u201d Bill showed her a friendly nod as if he recognized her.Leyla had been feeling down for the next two days, ever since she was invited to the mansion. She didn\u2019t talk to anyone or go for a walk in the woods or the garden. Bill realized he missed the good old days, especially that child\u2019s upbeat attitude. Since the child was silent, the world became quiet. And he wasn\u2019t a fan of the quiet world.\u201cCan you tell me why you want to give me that money?\u201dLeyla sat in a straight pose, facing her dear uncle, while Bill leaned a little towards the table. \u201cBecause I think it\u2019s worth a lot.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s worth a lot?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Even though receiving this coin made me sad at first, I couldn\u2019t possibly throw it away because of its high value. So I thought that if I gave you this coin, I might at least start repaying you after being indebted to you for so long.\u201d\u201cDamn it.\u201dLeyla flinched mildly at Bill\u2019s harsh mutter, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind his curse.Bill had been concerned about the nobles hurting Leyla\u2019s tender heart ever since she arrived in Arvis. Since all the aristocrats were the same to Bill, he had expected that they would bully the child because of her low status.The majority of them were arrogant, rude, and insulting.Bill was afraid of making the child shed tears if he asked what had happened at the mansion, but he had a good idea of how badly the child was treated there.\u201cLeyla.\u201dWhen he called her name, Leyla gave a childish grinning, despite her best efforts to act mature for her age.\u201cSince you earned the money, take it.\u201d\u201cThe money I earned?\u201d\u201cYep, it\u2019s the money you made while working. It\u2019s a pain in the neck to deal with a bored aristocrat, but you pulled it off. So you can confidently claim your prize.\u201dLeyla\u2019s brows furrowed in bewilderment. Bill gulped down the thick glass of beer in front of him while gazing at the pondering child. \u201cReally?\u201d Leyla tapped on the gold coin with her head tilted.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Bill cleaned the beer from his beard with the back of his sleeve.\u2018The money I earned.\u2019Leyla\u2019s expression became noticeably brighter. Bill cut up a large piece of meat and set it on her plate, \u201cWelcome to the adult world, Leyla.\u201d\u201cAdult? Me?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re considered an adult if you can make money on your own. That\u2019s exactly what you did.\u201d\u201cBut I just made one gold coin\u2026.\u201d\u201cIn this world, there are plenty of adults who can\u2019t even make a buck. So far, you\u2019ve had a good start. You\u2019re going to be a pretty good adult because you\u2019re off to such a good start.\u201dHe started piling bread and baked vegetables onto Leyla\u2019s plate. A large amount of food caused Leyla\u2019s eyes to widen. \u201cUncle, it\u2019s too much.\u201d\u201cEat a lot, because you\u2019ve been chewing at your food like a bird for days.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou know right? I like kids who eat like a cow.\u201dLeyla erupted in laughter. \u201cUncle, if I eat well, I\u2019ll grow a lot right?\u201d\u201cI suppose so. Why? Did anyone make fun of you because you\u2019re too short?\u201d\u201cNot really, but I think I look too young. So it upsets me.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s because you are still a child.\u2019\u00a0But Bill refrained from saying what everybody already knew.Leyla enjoyed chopping up her meat with ease. Bill thought she had grown a lot in the last few months. Her body no longer resembled an iron skewer, and she had a lovely face.Her natural frame was small and slim, similar to that of a bird. So it seemed that she would not be able to mature and grow a large physique. There was no doubt in his mind that Leyla would blossom into a beautiful lady.Bill was taken aback when he found himself complimenting Leyla\u2019s beauty and shook his head to gather himself. For impoverished women, beauty was poison and would bound them to run into trouble.That\u2019s why Bill was adamant about sending the girl somewhere he could trust. He didn\u2019t trust the orphanage because he believed it was the perfect place for ruining a child\u2019s life.\u2018The world is a terrible place. Humans are wretched.\u2019Bill drank the remaining portion of his beer while cursing the people who had abandoned the child in his care.It was hard to explain why the life of Bill Remmer was loaded with such anxiety. He yearned for the days when his life was filled with nothing but flowers and trees.\u201cUncle. If I earn money, I\u2019m free to spend it, right?\u201d Leyla wondered as she chewed her food properly.\u201cOf course. Do you have something you want?\u201d\u201cI ran out of pages in my notebook. I want to buy a new one.\u201d\u201cOf course, go ahead.\u201d\u201cCan I buy colored pencils as well?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cUncle, is there anything you need?\u201d\u201cWhy? Do you want to buy something for me as well?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat if I asked you to buy something outrageously expensive for me?\u201dThe expression on Leyla\u2019s face had changed to one of solemnity. When the girl became more serious, her eyes darkened and widened, giving her a cuter look.Bill cracked up, laughing as he poured Leyla\u2019s glass with apple juice.Leyla took the glass in her hand and gestured to Bill to clink his glass against hers. Bill happily slammed his glass toward the one that the child had reached out for. But he began to be worried that the child would imitate his drinking habits after he saw Leyla drink all of her juice in one go.Bill shook his head in disbelief at the thought of Leyla being a guzzler.\u00a0 \u2018\u00a0 I\u2019m only allowing her just for today.\u2019 He assured himself.***The long days had passed, and it had been during those long days that Bill mused the reasons why he couldn\u2019t raise Leyla and where he could send Leyla, the lovely but troublesome young girl who came out of nowhere in his life.Leyla grew a lot during those days of Bill\u2019s relentless wondering. The new clothes he had bought for Layla were getting shorter, and her smooth white calves were starting to show.The warehouse-like room that Leyla was supposed to use as a temporary residence became a lady\u2019s room at one point. The troublesome child who used to hop around the woods trail grew into a finely matured lady who now crossed the same track with gentle steps as if gliding on water.Bill was seated\u00a0on a chair underneath the porch with a puzzled look on his face when a young lady with a willow basket full of raspberries was waving at him. \u201cUncle! You\u2019re back early today.\u201dLeyla lightly ran towards him as if she were dancing. Her pretty blonde hair, which was braided into a single hairdo, swayed under the wide brim of the straw hat.\u00a0 Her two red cheeks were as fresh as the roses Bill had recently planted.\u201cYou must have gone to the woods again.\u201d\u201cYes. Look, it\u2019s a great harvest, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Leyla proudly held up her willow basket. \u201cI\u2019m going to pick some more tomorrow. I\u2019m planning to make a lot of raspberry jam.\u201d\u201cAre you planning on starting a business or something?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201dLeyla sat beside him in a chair with a bright smile on her face. Bill came to realize that there were two chairs on the porch. It wasn\u2019t just the two chairs. Even though Bill still hadn\u2019t made up his mind on what to do with Leyla, all of the furniture in the cottage was arranged for the two of them before he knew it.Leyla dropped the basket on the floor and started digging through it until she found a wild peach that she picked in the woods.\u00a0 Bill took the peach she was giving out to him, then he cut\u00a0it in half\u00a0and handed the half-sliced peach to Leyla.While eating their peaches, the two sat next to each other and watched the forest. The birds chirping from afar sounded as clear as Leyla\u2019s voice, and the noise of leaves blowing through the clear blue sky charmed their ears.\u201cIt\u2019s summertime again.\u201dBill muttered unknowingly. Leyla\u2019s face lit up with a silent smile. She removed her hat, and daintily raised her arms.Bill cracked up laughing when he discovered the old leather bag that ran below Leyla\u2019s knee, recognizing that it was the first item he gave her the year she arrived.\u201cAre you going to carry on with this old thing until it\u2019s worn out?\u201d\u201cI like it because it is comfortable to wear. It\u2019s still useful. \u201cHer bag shook with care as Leyla lifted it. Bill was able to pinpoint the source of the rattling noise. Tin pencil case. Pocket knife. Old notes. Some beautiful feathers and flower petals. She didn\u2019t change much in certain aspects.It was an ordinary evening when Bill was splitting firewood, and Leyla was sorting and organizing the dry laundry.She didn\u2019t forget to feed the chicken and the goat while she was adeptly preparing their dinner. The sun had already set by the time they faced each other across the table from opposite sides.\u201cKyle will be here the next day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have dinner and study together. Are you fine with that?\u201d Leyla asked while placing her delectable-smelling plate on the table.\u201cWhy does that rascal keep coming to my house to eat when he has a rich father who provides him with enough food?\u201d\u201cI know you like him, even though you speak of him in that way.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately.\u201dLeyla casually chuckled as Bill expressed his dissatisfaction, then she put the half-filled beer glass in front of him.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Why don\u2019t you fill it to the brim?\u201d\u201cFor your health\u2019s sake, you should drink less.\u201d\u201cDid Etmon, the glutton, tell you that?\u201d\u201cUncle!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a jackass.\u201d Bill grumbled under his breath. But he didn\u2019t go against Leyla\u2019s words.***At the end of a lovely meal, the night grew deeper. After cleaning dishes, Leyla returned to her room and took a warm shower. She was sleepy, but she chose to sit at her desk and switch on the lamp. An exam loomed in the coming days and her summer vacation joy hinged on the result of that exam.The sound of her pencil making marks on the paper was mixed in along with the sound of nighttime birds chirping, which was carried down from the night breeze.Leyla, who had been focusing on her studies for quite some time, finally let go of her pencil, unable to handle the eye pressure and faint headache that came over. She had to squint her eyes to see clearly ever since she was a kid. And now, her eyesight, which had never been very good, to begin with, seemed to have worsened.Leyla switched off the light and lay down on her bed.Twenty bottles of raspberry jam. No, should it be thirty bottles?Anyways, a bit more, she was almost on her goal of buying a pair of glasses.And though her problem should have gotten settled by telling Uncle Bill, she was afraid of burdening him. He was already giving her too many things, and she wasn\u2019t willing to repay him back with just money.The majority of people laughed at Bill when he said he\u2019d send Leyla to school. They told him there was no point in schooling an orphan child and sneered that when she got older, a kid like her would wind up being the maid of the Herhardt family.Bill, on the other hand, was adamant in his decision. Every day, he spoke with Leyla, telling her that she would be a pretty smart woman.After Leyla closed her eyes, her headache subsided a little. She desperately needed to sleep, but the more she attempted, the busier her mind became. Strange thoughts began to fill her hollow head on a night like this, as she often had.The return of the birds in the woods.Her summer\u2019s plans.The mastermind behind the series of a famous mystery novel published in the daily newspaper.And Duke Herhardt.Leyla slowly opened her eyes as soon as the name came to mind. Beyond the familiar darkness, she could see the scenery out of the window.Fluttering branches, the moon and stars, and the night sky sparkling above those trees.Leyla caught her breath silently as she blinked at the dim white light from afar.After\u00a0completing the Royal Military School, the Duke, who had graduated from college, was commissioned as an army officer in keeping with family tradition. He hadn\u2019t visited the estate in many years due to his assignment to the frontier overseas. So it had been a peaceful time for both Leyla and the birds in the forest.But, he was scheduled to return this summer.Master of Arvis, Duke Herhardt.That marked the end of 12-year-old Leyla.The Duke was back, and Leyla was an adult.And the real story would begin now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could see a young lady dragging her bicycle from afar.The lady\u2019s elegant and gentlemanly walk helped him to recognize her.But it wasn\u2019t just her walking style that made him notice the girl; it was also her face, which was always full of rich expressions and her gentle and delicate body gestures.Kyle cherished her whole existence dearly.After their encounter in the summer, under the shade of the willow tree-he had realized that there was no other girl just like her.\u201cLeyla!\u201dWhen she heard someone call her name loudly, Leyla stalled her steps and squinted her eyes in the direction of the boy approaching her.Kyle relished those moments.The moment her steps became faster after she discovered who he was.The moment she came up to him and smiled at him sweetly.\u201cWhy did you come here again? It would\u2019ve been more convenient for you to meet me at the cottage.\u201d\u201cWell, I had plenty of time anyway.\u201dThat was a lie, to speak the truth. He had left his tennis club mates behind to return home from school with her.~Tomorrow\u2019s problems must be resolved tomorrow. It will all be resolved.~So\u00a0Kyle was not worried at all. Even if his seniors might be waiting for him the next day with a racket in their hands.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*On a busy street, Kyle and Leyla walked side by side.\u00a0They bought some ice cream when they arrived at the shopping area, then stopped in front of a dusty bookstore.Leyla was always laughing. Kyle Etman believed that, aside from Uncle Bill, he was the only one in this world who knew how often Leyla laughed and how radiant her smile was.The wind became colder as they entered the Arvis territory road.After their conversation turned to the latest school exam, Leyla\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u00a0 When the topic of geometry was mentioned, her eyes swiftly glowed with a hint of despair.Kyle paid close attention to the subtle changes in her facial gestures.Not yet.He swallowed the heart-fluttering words that were about to escape his lips. Kyle didn\u2019t want his flippant confession to make their friendship become awkward.He then wondered, whether it was necessary to ask her out when he was already planning to marry her.\u2018Leyla Etman. That sounds nice.\u2019\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d\u00a0Leyla asked him as she frowned.She was grumbling about her low geometry grades until she looked dazedly at Kyle giggling by himself.\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026 Oh! I heard Duke Herhardt is coming back?\u201d Kyle abruptly changed the conversation\u2019s topic to something else. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. When is he returning?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cEveryone has been talking about Duke Herhardt coming back, but you don\u2019t seem to care.\u201dLeyla tightened her grip on the handlebars of her bicycle. She and Duke Herhardt had never had any contact in the last few years. They just exchanged greetings when they ran into each other in the woods or when Claudine called her to the mansion.Just passing by the Duke made her feel nervous, so Leyla tried to stay away from him at all costs.To put it bluntly, she didn\u2019t want to see him.Since the day Duke Herhardt stopped her spinning gold coin with his foot that summer evening, she had never wanted to see him again.Claudine invited her then abandoned her, but it was the Duke who made her know; how worthless Leyla Lewellin was in that strange, colorful world.That encounter left a scar that was different from the mistreatment she had received at Lovita.It was a recollection she desperately tried to erase. But whenever she came face to face with the Duke, he always caused her to remember that awful day.Leyla despised him.The Duke\u2019s appearance always reminded her how meaningless she was in that beautiful estate.Leyla sought to keep her unsteady breathing, at the same timing as a black car drove by.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Duchess Norma, the Duke\u2019s grandmother, never rode a car. So Leyla believed it was Duchess Elysse, who had returned from a social gathering.\u201cArvis must be busy for a while now that the Duke has returned.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cOh yes, Leyla. Should I try pursuing a career as an officer too?\u201d Kyle started walking backward while facing Leyla. \u201cLike Duke Herhardt, I\u2019d like to be awarded a medal. Captain Etman, a genius sniper capable of taking out any foe with a single shot.\u201d He pretended to fire an imaginary gun and grinning like a naughty kid.\u201cGeez, look at yourself, Mr. Etman. You can\u2019t even kill a chicken.\u201dWith a smirk, Leyla walked forward. Kyle was unable to counter her, although his pride had taken a hit.He boldly insisted last year that he would pay for his meals in the cottage by helping out.\u00a0Uncle Bill then told him to catch a chicken for dinner, but he couldn\u2019t even get a single feather out when he got inside the hencoop.And after that, Kyle Etman earned the unflattering moniker of \u201cthe gluttonous herbivore.\u201d\u201cKyle Etman, my sweet friend. That\u2019s why I like you.\u201dKyle\u2019s upset face brought a smile from Leyla.\u201cI hope, instead of killing others, you use your hands to save them.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 Of course. I\u2019m\u00a0planning to become a doctor.\u201d Kyle placed his hand on his cheek in an awkward pose. \u201cThen should I be a military doctor? Military doctors receive awards, too, right?\u201cWouldn\u2019t they give you one if you save a ton of people? It\u2019s a more great achievement than murder.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dDuring their chat, the two finally came to a fork in the street.\u00a0Etman\u2019s house was located at the end of the left-hand lane.Suddenly, Kyle\u2019s brow furrowed as he realized something,\u00a0\u201cAh! I forgot to bring you the geometry notes I promised to lend you.\u201d\u201cThen come back later for dinner. Make sure you bring your notes with you.\u201d\u201cHey, will you wait for me or for the notes?\u201d\u201cThe notes.\u201dLeyla boldly responded, then burst out laughing mischievously, so Kyle began rushing back to his house.\u201cKyle, there\u2019s no need to rush! Preparing dinner takes time!\u201d Leyla loudly shouted towards his back.\u201cDon\u2019t bother! After picking up my notes, I\u2019m heading straight to your house!\u201d But Kyle\u2019s retort was far more vehement.Leyla only shook her head at his stubbornness and began riding her bike towards the Platanus road leading to the Arvis mansion.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The butler and the driver were both startled by their master\u2019s sudden return when the black car came to a complete stop in front of the mansion driveway.Duke Herhardt\u2019s arrival was unexpected.The Arvis servants and tenants were busy desperately rushing around to brace for his early arrival. As a result, the Duke\u2019s scheduled social meetings with the nobility were all pushed up.Butler Hessen with his dried mouth gulped out of nervousness. \u201cMaster, we still haven\u2019t\u2026..\u201d\u201cI want to take a walk.\u201dMatthias cut off the butler\u2019s words with his calm tone. The driver hesitantly got off his seat and opened the back seat door.\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He briefly shook his head towards Hessen, who was about to follow him out. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the mansion,\u201d Matthias smiled as he turned his back.At his order, Hessen returned to the car while the driver quickly got back to his seat. After they drove away, the road became silent again.Matthias took a leisurely stroll under the tree shade, holding his officer\u2019s hat in one hand.\u00a0The sound of his boots coupled with the swaying leaves in the breeze created a unique yet thrilling melody.Matthias von Herhardt was the image of perfection as a child, a student, and an officer.And now, he was about to marry a perfect woman and become a perfect father.All of these facets of his life were so perfect that he began to feel a little bored.Matthias slowed the tempo of his steps. The bright stream of ray poured through the gaps in the tree leaves illuminated the edge of his slightly slanted eyes. His golden belt buckle,\u00a0 and the gleaming insignia decorated his blue-gray uniform were then softly bathed in the light.\u2018You will get engaged this summer.\u2019Matthias had happily listened to his mother\u2019s wishes. Merely, because it was his rightful duty to marry and give birth to a successor at the proper time.\u2018I believe Claudine is the most suitable candidate for the role of Duchess of Arvis.\u2019He had even graciously welcomed his grandmother\u2019s consent, precisely because Claudine von Brandt was a well-qualified bride with a reputable pedigree.But, nothing had ever sparked Matthias\u2019 desire.Since everything had already been put in his grasp before he even knew it, the desire was a far-off feeling that he discarded as fictitious.So was his marriage.Matthias wished for a perfect union. Marriage was nothing more than a stepping stone for him to strengthen his world. So,\u00a0there was no reason to waste all needless feelings in a bond called marriage.He believed Claudine von Brandt was his most fair companion. She was adequate for him, so he didn\u2019t care for anything else, and he didn\u2019t feel obligated to do so.The shattered sunshine pierced his vision as he lifted his head.Matthias paused in the middle of the road the moment he felt the mysterious appearance of a girl.His attention was attracted to a girl on a bicycle who was heading in his direction. Her fine golden cotton hair fluttered across the breeze like a gentle wave.He slowly backed away when the woman passed by his left.\u201cLeyla Lewellin?\u201dThat girl flicked her head towards him as soon as Matthias remembered her name.When she met his gaze, her green eyes widened.\u201cAahhh!\u201dThat girl lost her balance and fell from her bicycle. Her cries could be heard when the bike clashed with the pavement.The bicycle\u2019s wheels continued to spin wildly long after she collapsed.\u00a0Matthias marched quickly up to her, who had fallen on the ground.Under his looming shadow, that girl lifted her head.Without a doubt, she was Leyla Lewellin.The bird-lover maniac little girl.*\u201c\u2026\u2026Oh, I\u2019m sorry, my lord.\u201dLeyla hurriedly bent her head in apologies and waited for him to pass on by her.Matthias was about to leave when he got distracted by Leyla\u2019s outfit.Blood was seeping from her ripped stockings, and her school uniform was caked with dust.Silence fell over the two when the spinning bicycle wheel stilled.Leyla raised her finely frowned eyebrows and sent Matthias a sidelong look. Her face rendered an oddly soft image, even though she was showing an insolent expression.\u2018Seems this girl grew as well.\u2019Although it was natural for the child to grow as time went by, her change in appearance had somehow made him feel like scratching his nerves.Leyla Lewellin was nothing more than a little child to Matthias.The girl who tried everything she could to stay away from him at all costs. The girl he regarded as meaningless.But now, he couldn\u2019t correlate that meaningless girl he remembered with the Leyla Lewellin who was standing in front of him right now.Her rosy cheeks, soft hair, and sweet body scent was borne by the wind.Her slender lines of her body that were visible under the tight, summer school uniform, were no longer those of a skinny child.Matthias sensed a curious discomfort as Leyla struggled to get up. She took a step back and braided her shoelaces before dusting off her school dress.Although Leyla was now an adult, she was still too short of reaching the tip of his chin.\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dMatthias called her name on the spur of the moment. The tone of his accent made Leyla\u2019s shoulders flinch.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lord.\u201dLeyla crouched beneath his feet, uttering the same lines repeatedly while she started gathering up her dropped belongings; the bag, books, notes.Matthias\u2019 focus was drawn to the delicate, pale hands, which were coated with dust and blood. When he watched Leyla collecting her things, his gaze was lured to a pen that she softly nudged.Slowly, Matthias walked forward and stepped on her pen on purpose.Leyla glanced up and saw Matthias was staring at her with irritation in his eyes.\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dHe called her name once more.\u201cI\u2019m talking to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Yes, my lord.\u201d Leyla answered, as she shut her eyes tightly.Matthias didn\u2019t budge when she tried to get the pen out of his stepping shoes.\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201dLeyla said quite confidently even though her body trembled. Her green eyes, which had resembled the vibrant summer forest, twinkled with anger and humiliation.Her memory flashed back to the moment the duke stepped on her gold coin. He looked down at her with the same expression and gaze on that day as he was now.Matthias finally lifted his foot and casually passed by her after letting out a short laugh.As if nothing had happened, he put on his officer\u2019s hat and began sauntering down the road.Leyla could only stare at the back of Duke Herhardt from afar while the pen in her hands quivered.She wondered.\u00a0Why would the Duke do something like that if he wasn\u2019t planning on saying anything?Would the people of Arvis believe that Duke Herhardt, the perfect aristocrat, would act in such a way?She was willing to stake her entire savings that no one would believe her.Everyone would have thought she was insane.Leyla pulled her bicycle up and closed her lips tightly. She made sure to wipe her pen clean before putting it in her bag and began following the duke, who was walking ahead slowly.Leyla was sure the duke wouldn\u2019t look back. Still, she tried to walk properly even though her skin that had got rubbed off was in horrible pain and flexed her leg muscles to keep herself from limping.\u2018It will be great if he uses those long legs to walk faster.\u2019Leyla was about to sigh with annoyance, when Duke Herhardt suddenly turned around towards her.The sudden gust of wind rattled the tree leaves, and the pattern of sunshine dripping through the leaves danced in a slow rhythm over the road.Startled, Leyla stood still like a statue. But, Matthias\u2019 gaze was already drawn to her beautiful features.His eyes moved downwards.First to her long, wavy hair, then to her enthralled body.To her upright chest which was panting up and down unevenly. And, to her pasty hand gripping the pedals of the bicycle.The sylph-like ankle and her petite feet.And then to her alluring eyes.For a long time, Matthias stood in grim silence, peering into Leyla\u2019s emerald-colored eyes.She was an orphan residing in his estate\u2019s lodge, but one crucial fact seemed to have changed everything.That little girl grew older as time went by.Matthias noticed her as he acknowledged the fact.She was no longer a child.She was a woman, Leyla Lewellin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But Claudine von Brandt had another reason to visit Arvis this year, as everybody knew.Before revealing the engagement to the public, a meeting was planned for the two families to pre-negotiate and foster friendship between them.The meeting\u2019s intent was obvious to both families, and neither party, particularly Claudine, had tried to conceal it.\u201cHello, Duke Herhardt.\u201dMatthias was received politely by Claudine. His cousin in front of him had matured into a refined lady, and he couldn\u2019t make out the outlines of that short, whiny girl from her anymore.\u201cWelcome, Lady Brandt.\u201dHe returned Claudine\u2019s formal greeting, and the two exchanged graceful smiles.Between the two, there was nothing new to speak about.\u00a0They were not very close or intimate, but they had known each other for a long time.They both knew, how aristocratic Matthias von Herhardt and Claudine von Brandt were to the marrow. This was the most important and apparent reason why they chose each other.Matthias escorted Claudine expertly. His mother, Elysse von Herhardt, instructed the servants to prepare their afternoon tea in the glass greenhouse attached to the mansion\u2019s rear.\u00a0Elysse adored the greenhouse, so in a way, it was also a form of expressing her affection for Claudine.\u201cEvery time I visit this greenhouse, it never ceases to amaze me. It\u2019s as if Duchess Elysse has migrated heaven into this place.\u201dClaudine sipped her tea quietly and gratefully complimented her. She talked in a pleasant yet excellent manner, as one might expect from a noblewoman.\u201cI\u2019ve put a lot of effort into decorating this place. I\u2019m looking forward to give it to a hostess who understands its worth.\u201dIn hushed voices, Elysse spoke up. When Countess Brandt heard of it, she gave her daughter a proud and emotional glance, but Claudine just smiled shyly.\u201cMatthias, take Claudine on a tour of Arvis\u2019s heaven.\u201dElysse\u2019s whisper to her son at the end of their tea break, marking the start of larger-scale deals between two-families.Claudine smoothly laid her transparent lace-gloved hands over Matthias\u2019s as he extended his hand.Her fair-skinned image regained his memory of someone\u2019s hand covered with dust and blood for a fleeting moment until it disappeared in the blink of an eye.They talked about a mild topic as they walked along the road.The clear chirping of birds melted away the languid mood of the afternoon in that place, where a stream of water gently flowed from the marble fountain that embellished the center of the greenhouse.Matthias captured Claudine\u2019s eye in a stealthy glimpse. It was difficult to interpret his inner emotions and his mindset toward the world, despite him often smiling peacefully.For Claudine, he was an interesting object to look at.Matthias was a gentleman, but he was also a haughty person who never had bowed down to anybody in his life.\u201cThis greenhouse has many lovely birds.\u201dClaudine was mesmerized by the brightly colored birds perched on the tree branches, and Matthias had only seen those birds in the glass greenhouse now.Elysse, the Arvis\u2019 present hostess, was as fond of birds as she was of flowers.The zookeepers were in charge of caring for the birds in the greenhouse, much as the gardeners were in charge of growing the roses.And her job? It was to simply take in the scenery.Elysse von Herhardt viewed her beautiful world in this light. \u2013Take pride in the job that others have done for her-\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. This little one is exceptionally well-behaved. What\u2019s your secret?\u201d Claudine asked; a tiny bird landed on her palm and made her smile.Matthias took a long, restful glance around him, realizing the birds in this greenhouse were surprisingly docile.The birds didn\u2019t dare to fly out, even if the window was wide open; instead, they continued to sing melodiously in this tranquil, beautiful prison.His attention turned to the gray-haired zookeeper after seeing the parrot trundled over the windowsill, and the\u00a0Bengalese finch warbled on Claudine\u2019s hand.The zookeeper then approached them,\u201cI clipped their wings, Miss. They are thus unwilling to fly or escape, and they become obedient. If I leave their wings uncut, they would be difficult to tame.\u201dThe old man answered her question.\u201cTheir wings? Wouldn\u2019t that hurt them?\u201d\u201cI just cut their feathers, so they don\u2019t feel pain,\u201d He continued to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s also beneficial to the birds because it keeps them from going into dangerous places and being wounded. Would you like me to show it? \u201c\u201cWould you mind it, Lord Herhardt, if I see that?\u201d Claudine asked with her eyes twinkling.\u201cAs you wish, my Lady.\u201dThe zookeeper led them to a big cage at the end of the greenhouse after Matthias gladly granted his permission. There were birds inside whose wings hadn\u2019t been trimmed yet.\u201cWhat kind of bird is it?\u201d Matthias asked as he watched the bird.\u201cIt\u2019s a canary, my Lord. A lovely singing bird.\u201dThe zookeeper stretched out the bird\u2019s wings and covered its eyes with a small handkerchief. On his other hand, he quickly grabbed a pair of trimmer scissors.Without hesitation, the elderly man moved the scissors\u2019 blade. The cut canary\u2019s fine feathers were scattered around the worktable.He finished his task by trimming the other side of the wing and then releasing the bird.The canary flailed its wings desperately, but it was unable to go far and fell slowly.As if the bird couldn\u2019t believe that it couldn\u2019t fly anymore, it attempted to flap several times more, but the result remained the same the whole time.Matthias, who leaned there watching, reached over and scooped up the shivering yellow bird at the end of the flower bed.\u201cMaster, a canary is not easily tamed. The bird must get used to the clipping over time.\u201dThe canary that had been stuck in his hands began to struggle and chirp. But it sounded more like a cry than a melody. So Matthias handed the bird back to the zookeeper.\u201cWould you like to try cutting one, Miss?\u201d\u00a0The zookeeper stroked the bird gently to make it calm.\u201cI like to observe animals rather than tame them. Thank you for bringing an end to my inquisitiveness.\u201dClaudine respectfully declined and walked away.\u201cLet us go back to the tea-table right now.\u201dClaudine took the initiative this time and offered her hand first. Matthias\u2019s memory once again flashed back to the beautiful, sculpture-like hand that had been soiled with dust and blood and then faded away.\u201cBring that to my bedroom.\u201dMatthias made a spontaneous order to the old man before leaving the area with Claudine.The zookeeper\u2019s eyes narrowed in surprise as he heard the sudden request. \u201c\u2026.. Yes, my Lord?\u201d\u201cThat bird.\u201dMatthias pointed to the bird with his thinly opened eyes.\u201cMy canary.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla made a single ponytail out of her combed blonde hair. She then put on an apron and didn\u2019t forget to pick up her huge basket.\u201cI have to finish it soon.\u201dLeyla\u2019s expression was grave as she muttered to herself. Lady Brandt had paid a visit to Arvis a few days before Duke Herhardt\u2019s arrival.As a consequence, Leyla was pressed for time. Before she ran into the Duke again. Or was summoned by Lady Brandt, she had to pick all the raspberries in the woods.However, those two people were fortunately occupied as they seemed to be preparing to announce their marriage.Leyla took a short walk into the woods while wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat. She found a bush of overgrown raspberries there.There were always lots of fruits dropping on the ground and rotting away, no matter how much the people of Arvis and the forest animals picked and ate it.Before midday, Leyla tirelessly trekked the forest and loaded her big basket. She felt rollicking, although her arms felt like they were going to crumble down owing to the heavyweight of the basket.She placed her basket under the shadow of a tree and dashed for the water to rinse the fierce raspberry smell and color from her hands and face.The garden of Herhardt and its valleys was encircled by the Schulter River.The river\u2019s curve looked beautiful from the central city, but the Arvis cemetery had the best view of that river.Leyla dug into her apron for a handkerchief and wiped the water droplets off her face.Over the season, that refreshing river contributed a lot to mitigate the scorching weather. She thought of dipping her feet into the river, but she quickly discarded the notion.In her aunt\u2019s house, where she first lived before being shipped out, Leyla had five older cousins who were always rough and rude to her.One day, she had been dragged and thrown into a river by her cousins.\u00a0Leyla might have been taken by the water spirit if her neighbor didn\u2019t hear her scream and rescued her from drowning.However, her cousins defended their behavior by claiming it was her initiative as a ritual ceremony stepped into their household.Even though her cousins were at fault, Leyla was the one who was beaten by her drunk uncle that night. She was driven out and relocated to her next relative\u2019s house in the next few weeks, with an excuse that they couldn\u2019t take care of a child who took their kindness for granted.Although it was unfair, Leyla wanted to see it as a positive because she thought her next relative\u2019s house would be better for her.The following house.The next house after that.Leyla wished for better care any time she was transferred from one place to another.And when she eventually settled down at Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage, she felt her sincere dreams had been granted.So far, it has gone well.Leyla turned around and walked under the shade of the tree. She stuffed the newspaper pinned to the basket\u2019s corner into her apron pocket and started climbing it.Uncle Bill had taught her that. So she knew how to, even though she wasn\u2019t as fast and flexible as she used to be.Leyla perched like a well-fitted chair on the tree branch.Looking down, she was confident that the Schulter River was the most beautiful river on the earth.Kyle, who had traveled to a variety of cities before, also agreed with her. So Leyla believed her point of view had been validated by credible evidence.Summer was, without a doubt, one of the most paradisal seasons of the year.As the fresh scent of the river permeated through her nose, she watched the water birds hunting for food from the high tree.Leyla took the newspaper from her apron pocket. She flipped to the mystery serial novel section with a focused look on her eyes. In this episode, the main detective was about to reveal the murderer by his brilliant analysis.Leyla began to read the novel with zeal\u00a0when Matthias suddenly raised his face from under the water\u2019s surface.His fit, naked body was displayed over the river water.\u00a0His distinctive Adam\u2019s apple went up and down to the beat of his rapid breathing.Matthias had changed his mind and started swimming in the reverse direction of the stream just as he was about to return to his mansion.Matthias enjoyed the Schulter River and the Arvis forest so much.\u00a0He moved to the building next to the dock, where he could have a panoramic view of the whole scene from his small annex.Matthias\u2019s grandmother and mother never walked by the riverside. That\u2019s why that place was like Matthias\u2019s private world.When there were no guests at the mansion, Matthias often visited the annex. Just to blankly stare at the landscape beyond the window, read a book, or even take a nap if he was bored.It\u2019s the most enjoyable place to do things.Of course, his favorite thing to do, just as now, was to sink his body into the river.Matthias looked up at the horizon obscured by the green branches when floating in the water.The sound of swaying leaves and rippling water, as well as the birds\u2019 chirp, they were both roiled by the gentle breeze.The mansion had been noisy over the previous few days, so it was only today that he could deeply feel the river\u2019s calmness.The negotiation process for the marriage deal that Herhardt and the Brandt family were about to sign had gone smoothly.His engagement to Claudine was scheduled to be confirmed by the end of the summer if nothing surprising happened.Matthias agreed to a year-long engagement. He didn\u2019t have to keep his job as an officer if he earned enough honor as the Duke of Arvis.Moreover, he was at the most suitable time to discharge from the military and marry after serving about one or two years in the military division. So, after the wedding, he planned to devote his whole attention to his family\u2019s business.It was a life where he would glide along like a steady, calm stream.With his eyes closed, Matthias surrendered his body to the river. Bright sunlight, melting water, and the sound of swirls breaking down in his ears seemed to be all that existed in his world.But his utter peace was broken the second he opened his eyes again.There\u2019s a woman sitting on the limbs of the sturdy tree by the river.Matthias recognized the woman\u2019s features before he had a chance to blink his eyes.At that exact moment, the woman who folded up her newspaper she was reading turned her head towards him.It was that annoying woman.Leyla Lewellin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was often frightened when she thought of a tree branch floating in the water as a person.However, the visible silhouette that appeared from the water this time was unmistakably a human.And it was a man.A tall, bare-chested man.Leyla couldn\u2019t stick to her self-justification that it was all a trick of the light as his wet, black hair emerged into her view.Right now, afloat on the river undoubtedly, was the Duke Matthias von Herhardt.The flabbergasted Leyla threw down the newspaper she was holding.She might have slumped to the ground along with her newspaper if she hadn\u2019t immediately grabbed the tree branch.Her intuition had taught her everything.\u00a0-Close your eyes for the time being. No, get off the tree as quickly as you can and get out of this forest. -Or, at the very least, just shout in surprise-But all Leyla could do was stare at the guy in his underwear, dumbstruck.Beyond a doubt, it was Duke Herhardt. The man clearly returned Leyla\u2019s stare, with no intention of hiding his nude body while still afloat in the river.I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll drift away!By the time the breeze began to rage with gusto, the Duke had started to swim for the river\u2019s edge, to the place where Leyla was.\u201cAh, no!\u201dThe cry of Leyla echoed up into the cloudless sky.\u201cNo! Don\u2019t come here! You can\u2019t come!\u201dLeyla quickly climbed down from the oak, shrieking in panic. She couldn\u2019t think of anything, so she didn\u2019t even bother to greet the Duke with courtesy.Leyla dropped her basket as well as her hat and bolted quickly. She raced through the forest without noticing how fast her legs ran.\u201cLeyla!\u201dLeyla bumped into Kyle around halfway up the path leading to the cottage.\u00a0Kyle was flummoxed when he saw her and immediately caught Leyla, who almost fell.\u201cWhere have you been? I was looking for you because you weren\u2019t at home.\u201d\u201cKyle, Kyle, what should I do?\u201dLeyla muttered hoarsely; she gasped for breath like a half-crazed person.\u201cWhy? What\u2019s going on? Did you come across a wild animal?\u201dKyle moved his gaze beyond the road as Leyla shook her head vehemently. There was little to be found. In front of them, all he saw was just an ordinary forest.\u201cThen what is it? What is it that has shocked you so much?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 What should I do?\u201dLeyla sobbed and fell to the ground, veiling her face with the hem of her apron and shook her head a couple of times.She didn\u2019t want to remember, but the image of the Duke\u2019s muscular body kept flickering through her mind.Leyla ruffled her hair with her fingers. \u201cWhat should I do? What should I do, Kyle?\u201d\u201cIf you could tell me what your problem is, I\u2019ll answer you. What the heck is it?\u201d\u00a0Kyle sighed as he kneeled in front of her.In no time, Leyla\u2019s face had rendered as crimson as a freshly-picked raspberry.Kyle started giggling, \u201cHey, what things did you see? Did you see a ghost?\u201dNo.Leyla had everything she wanted to say, but her lips couldn\u2019t open.It\u2019s something scarier than that \u2026.Her hot gasps split out the phrases she softly whispered.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Water dripped down his nose from the tip of his wet hair. Matthias was still bemused by the incredible scene that had happened in front of him.He swam to his annex\u2019s dock and wore his clothes. After that, Matthias approached the tree where Leyla had dumped all her belongings before she ran away.Matthias looked through the traces left by Leyla. Near the tree, there was a big basket and a hat\u2014a newspaper on the ground and a wet handkerchief.After checking the basket full of raspberries, he let out a fake chuckle.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t believe that girl was carrying such a large basket with her slender arms.Did she want to get rid of all the raspberries in the Arvis forest?Matthies glanced up to the beautiful oak tree and realized that it was the same tree where he had almost shot that little girl a few years ago.When he remembered the moment when her little face, sitting on the branch, looked at him vacantly, Matthias cracked out laughing.Don\u2019t tell me she still plays around climbing trees.At first, he was thinking of chasing after her.Matthias, however, changed his mind and returned to the mansion because this afternoon, he had a meeting with the board of directors of his family company.Matthias wasn\u2019t directly involved with the company\u2019s management, but it was his responsibility to review their proposals.He was, therefore, in charge of managing the overall structure of the organization and the efficiency of his subordinates\u2019 jobs.Based on their land and property assets, the Herhardt family broadened their trade and natural resources scope. Matthias\u2019 grandfather, who had amassed a vast amount of wealth for the family, had taken the ambitious decision to invest in the emerging Empire\u2019s oil fields.Matthias now owned much of the Herhardt household\u2019s honour and authority, which had been established over the years by the previous owners.Matthias was fully conscious of this.He understood that it was his most important duty to uphold the honour and authority of the Herhardt family and hand them onto the next Herhardt.He\u2019d never questioned his own abilities. So Matthias had great confidence that he would perform his duties better than anyone else.Once Matthias finally arrived at the mansion, he went straight to his bedroom, and changed his attire then straightened his messy hair.After all the preparation, the time before his next appointment was still an hour out. Matthias leaned against the chair by the window on the west side of his bedroom.He was about to rise from his chair, thinking that sitting and waiting was a waste of time until he heard the sound of the chirping bird.Matthias turned his eyes to the source of the noise. On the table, he found the canary inside the birdcage was humming.He used to think it didn\u2019t know how to sing because the bird was so quiet. So he was surprised when the canary was singing beautifully, enough to drown out his previous thoughts.Matthias sauntered to the birdcage and unlocked its door. The canary inside stopped humming, and flailed its clipped wings and escaped from the cage.He was about to leave the room when he changed his mind and leaned against the window frame to watch the bird.That tiny creature was very diligent. It flew, fell, and then hovered around the room without pausing.After a while, the canary grew tired and perched down peacefully on the armrest of the chair.Matthias took the bird and put it back in the cage. The canary obediently entrusted itself to its owner rather than struggling and giving out a deafening chirp.Matthias was intrigued by the bird\u2019s personality change, so he tried putting it on his forefinger.He wanted the bird to fly, but it surprisingly stayed still and kept looking at him.\u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve found a new world.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Looking at Leyla muttering something incomprehensible in shock. The grey-haired optician just let out a robust chuckle.\u201cI understand. Your eyesight is bad. You must be having a hard time.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that bad. Except when I have to read books. \u201cLeyla cheerfully answered while putting down her glasses on the table after she had adjusted them.Her smoggy world miraculously became visible, and the clear view in front of her enthralled her once more.Leyla\u2019s fingertips had turned the harvest of raspberries produced by the forest into jam.After saving up enough money to buy a pair of glasses, she rode her bike downtown. She quickly drove to the optometrist\u2019s shop, where she used to visit frequently.Leyla headed out of the shop after consulting with the optician for a few minutes longer. Through her glasses, the scenery on the outside now became so crystal-clear.It seemed strange yet mesmerizing.Leyla conveyed her gratitude and love for the Arvis forest\u2019s wild fruits, which shone brilliantly in the warm sun. She also praised herself for the long hours she had spent stirring raspberry jam in front of the stove in the sweltering weather.But why? Why did she still have those terrible memories on such joyous occasions?Leyla sighed as she remembered the day she accidentally saw the Duke\u2019s body nearly naked.She was both ashamed and frightened, so Leyla had to wait until the sun had fallen before leaving to collect her basket and hat.The forest when she returned was so placid, and the river glistened peacefully. Leyla felt relieved and hurriedly headed away from the river, with her basket and hat in hand.However, her cheeks were still boiling hot. She was so flustered that she didn\u2019t even realize how heavy the basket she was carrying was.After that day, Leyla became embarrassed every time she saw guys, even to look at Uncle Bill and Kyle.How could he swim naked in the river, even though it\u2019s his estate? More so in broad daylight?Leyla shook her head, trying to remove the traumatic memory from her mind.I shouldn\u2019t go to the riverside until the duke leaves this estate.Leyla committed to herself and was preparing to return to the estate until she heard a voice she recognized.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Leyla?\u201dWell, it\u2019s her.Unmistakably, that loud-high voice belonged to Claudine von Brandt.Leyla stopped to catch her breath before finally turning around.Her face was lit up with a polite smile. But her body froze as she unexpectedly locked eyes with Duke Herhardt, the person who had just disturbed her mind just a few moments ago.Leyla had a clear view of the man in front of her. She abruptly shifted her gaze to Claudine, who was standing alongside him.Claudine didn\u2019t visit Arvis as much as she used to when Duke Herhardt was away serving as an officer on the battlefield\u2019s front lines.It had been a long time since Leyla had seen her, and Claudine had grown into a gorgeous woman.The two gracefully nodded to accept Leyla\u2019s greeting after she courteously paid her respects to them.\u201cWhen did you start wearing glasses? I almost mistook you for someone else.\u201dLeyla hoped for her to leave, but Claudine spoke again. So, having no other choice, Leyla faced her with a prepared smile and tried hard not to look Duke Herhardt in the eyes.\u201cHave you been doing well?\u201dThrough her slightly opened eyes, Claudine meticulously analyzed Leyla.\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d\u201cWe were on our way to have some tea.\u201dClaudine used her eyes to guide Leyla\u2019s attention to the hotel across the street.Yes, Miss. Or\u00a0I see, Miss.Leyla was debating which response to give when Claudine generously said, \u201cLet\u2019s go together, Leyla.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen each other, so I\u2019d like to have a cup of tea with you. Is that fine with you, Duke Herhardt?\u201dMatthias conveyed his approval with a thin smile on the tip of his lips after Claudine asked him.As usual, they seemed uninterested in what Leyla had to say.Leyla sighed and began to follow them from behind as the two continued their stroll.\u00a0The servants who were accompanying them also followed suit quietly.The sound of footsteps was mingled with the clunking sound of the old wheel when Leyla dragged her bicycle behind them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Safe World \u2727The doorman looked flustered when the three of them arrived at the entrance.Leyla showed him a friendly smile as though she understood why the doorman was staring at her in wonder as no one had ever brought a lousy bicycle to the city\u2019s finest hotel.Her bicycle was taken away after the doorman checked her and Claudine for several minutes. Leyla entered the hotel after voicing her thanks with a simple greeting.The tea lounge was located on the right side of the main lobby. The manager led them in quick steps to the terrace that faced out across the riverside.The last one to take a seat at the table was Leyla.Not sure if she had bad luck today, but it so happened that his chair was right across from Duke Herhardt.\u00a0To avoid his cold stare, Leyla hurriedly fixed her eyes on her thighs.The summer sun reflected brilliantly on her thin, gold-frame glasses.\u00a0The Duke continued to look at her casually as if nothing had happened at the river, absolutely amazing Leyla.Shouldn\u2019t the person who was caught naked should feel more ashamed than the person who saw it?It was hard to deny that commoners and servants were nothing more than furniture or paintings to the aristocratic people.They weren\u2019t embarrassed to be naked in front of a piece of furniture. And there wasn\u2019t a single piece of furniture that was shocked at the sight of a nude person.The tea table had already been set up by the time Leyla came to her conclusion.Even though Duke Herhardt hadn\u2019t given an order, a cup of strongly scented coffee was placed in front of him. Then, he held the teacup handle with his smooth-tapering fingers and took a sip.Like they\u2019d forgotten about Leyla\u2019s existence, Claudine and Matthias were engrossed in continuing their own discussion.From the exhibition they saw today, the news about their relatives, till the plan about a weekend party at the mansion their conversation covered all these fleeting topics.Matthias\u2019s gentle-baritone voice and Claudine\u2019s soprano high note overlapped at regular intervals.Leyla was confused as to why they had taken her along if they were going to chat between themselves.The acts of Lady Brandt were entirely beyond her understanding. Leyla had always failed to understand Claudine ever since their first meeting in that summer.\u201cSo, Leyla. How\u2019s your school? Are you having fun?\u201dClaudine\u2019s voice and the sound of the cup being placed on the saucer both could be heard at the exact same moment. Although she was just a year above her age, she always talked to Leyla as if she were speaking to a child in an adult-like manner.\u201cYes, Miss.\u201dFor Uncle Bill.Leyla chanted in her head when she was answering Claudine. She repeatedly answered with a constant smile every time Claudine posed a couple more questions about her school life and gave a nod out of satisfaction.Claudine wanted Leyla\u2019s answers to be a resounding\u00a0\u2018Yes, Miss.\u2019\u00a0And Leyla also had grown accustomed to responding in that way.\u201cYou\u2019ll be graduating next year right?\u201dClaudine\u2019s tone still sounded friendly, even though Leyla only gave a cursory answer.\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d\u201cAfter graduation, what do you want to do?\u201d\u201cI will enroll into a program for a teaching certificate.\u201d\u201cOh, a teacher\u2026?\u201dClaudine raised the corners of her lips while grabbing her teacup. Her nods rattled the ribbon and corsage that adorned her little hat.\u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, Leyla. That\u2019s a wonderful goal. I believe that will be suitable for you.\u201d Claudine smiled once more, praising Leyla for her admirable dream. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Duke Herhardt?\u201dUnintentionally, Leyla moved her focus onto Matthias. His blue-colored eyes were more lucid as she wore her glasses.Leyla hurriedly lowered her eyes as she realized she had been looking at the Duke for way too long.\u201cI see.\u201dIn a calm manner, Matthias agreed.Leyla\u2019s presence then faded away again.\u00a0She was relieved because she wanted this uncomfortable teatime to be over with as quickly as possible.Kyle had gone out to play tennis, and she was supposed to meet him in town. So Leyla was worried that she was going to be late for her appointment.Leyla, who was anxious, lifted her head. At the same moment, Matthias turned his head and looked at her.\u00a0Leyla didn\u2019t avoid his eye contact as she had done before and returned his stare in silence.When she was young, Matthias\u2019 blue eyes reminded her of a round mazarine-colored crystal candy that tasted sweet like sugar. Leyla shook her head in disbelief at her youth\u2019s stupidity.\u201cWell, Duke Herhardt and Lady Claudine, please excuse me.\u201dLeyla had enough of sitting quietly and opened her tender lips.\u201cDo you mind if I excuse myself?\u201dShe felt as if she could breathe again after moving her eyes from Matthias\u2019s eyes to Claudine\u2019s.\u201cI promised my friend that I\u2019ll meet him this afternoon.\u201dLeyla chattered with an anxious look on her face. But soon, her nervous expression dissipated and she heaved a sigh of relief after Claudine smiled, nodded, and granted her permission.She dashed out of the hotel and immediately pedaled her bicycle through the crowded streets after politely bidding her goodbye to the two.Yet there was something strange about it; the more Leyla pedaled further from the Duke, the more unforgettable his face became in her mind.Is it because of the glasses?With a deep sigh, Leyla pondered. The biggest explanation she was hypnotized by the Duke, she believed, was because of her glasses. With her enhanced eyesight, it was normal for her breath to be halted when she saw him.Leyla arrived at the meeting point right as she was going to faint from the tiredness of all the pedaling she had done.Kyle, who first arrived before her, was flashing a broad smile and as he waved his hand.Finally, she\u2019d made her way into her safe place.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cShe has grown up, right? She looks like a lady now.\u201dClaudine shifted her eyes in the direction Leyla had left just a while ago. She sounded like a mother looking at her daughter even though she was just a year older than her.Matthias flashed a proper smile, \u201cBecause she\u2019s a lady.\u201dHe gave a moderate, impassive answer.\u201cYes. She is.\u201dClaudine then paused for a second, lost in thought, before showing her smile that was as bright as the summer sunshine.\u201cOh. Did you hear? Riette has just purchased a brand-new car.\u201d She deftly changed the conversation\u2019s topic.In the world they shared, the two continued their talk. It was as if Leyla Lewellin, who used to sit across from them at the table, had never been there at all.But Leyla and Matthias strangely had met each other again in an unexpected place.Matthias was on his return trip to his mansion after enjoying a relaxing tea break. He casually glanced out of the car passenger window as his car came to a halt due to the overcrowded road.On the sidewalk, he observed at a glimpse, Leyla who was dragging her bicycle.She was walking down the busy street with a boy. That familiar young man he had seen before in the past seemed to be the friend she had promised to meet.Matthias then recalled the name of the familiar-looking boy.The son of Herhardt\u2019s doctor. Kyle Etman.Leyla Lewellin yelled at the boy who kept tapping on his glasses, but the boy looked like he had said something even more mischievous, prompting Leyla to sigh in annoyance, followed by a chuckle.The two stalled in front of the library stairwell after spending a long time laughing and kidding around.Leyla sat at the bottom of the stairs after parking her bike. The boy was following her with a paper bag in his hand and took out two bottles of soda and a sandwich from inside it.Leyla Lewellin and the boy were sitting next to each other at the stairs and sharing their food. She burst out laughing every time the boy said something. When Leyla chuckled, the boy joined in her laughter.Meanwhile, traffic on the busy road began to disperse, and the car started moving again.Matthias turned his eyes away from the window and looked at Claudine who was sitting across the car window on the opposite side.After a brief exchange of smiles and then some, the two resumed their nice little chat.Matthias unintentionally remembered his memories from their teatime at that moment -Leyla Lewellin sat still in an upright position with her hands on her knees and then left quietly without touching the teacup in front of her.-\u2018Hmm, she left me for that boy.\u2019That painful truth evoked his recollection of Leyla\u2019s nervous and agonized expression.\u2018So she chose to see that boy\u2026.\u2019As his thoughts reached this point, Matthias recalled her back as she walked away from the hotel terrace, rushing as if she were running away from him.\u2018So, she left me just to go to meet that boy.\u2019While he was engrossed in his thoughts, their car had already passed the Platanus road leading to the Arvis estate.As the car drove along the road where Leyla fell off her bicycle, Matthias emphasized to himself that the girl.Leyla Lewellin was nothing to him.However, for some reason, he wasn\u2019t too pleased with the unsettling feeling that had lingered in him at that moment.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI\u2019ll buy you ice cream since I ate your sandwich.\u201dWith a light smile, Leyla stood up from the library stairwell. She packed the empty paper bag, along with the bottled beverages, into her bicycle basket with care.\u201cNo thanks. You don\u2019t have to buy me anything.\u201dKyle hopped on her bike with a mildly awkward grin. Leyla sat in the bike\u2019s back seat, which was her usual position.Even in the midday summer sun, Kyle could distinctly sense her body temperature being transferred to his back.Kyle began pedaling to lessen the heat on his cheeks.\u2018Gezz, she could hold me a little tighter.\u2019He muttered to himself as Leyla gently grasped the brim of his shirt as if to tease him.Kyle was delighted with her grip, even though he was a little hopeful.Truthfully, he had deliberately left his bike at home to ride Leyla\u2019s with her.Leyla, of course, was utterly clueless about his intentions.\u201cYou know what, Kyle.\u201dLeyla\u2019s soothing voice suddenly seeped through the swirling wind.\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll still buy you ice cream.\u201dKyle chuckled at her abrupt offer because he was already curious about what she had to say.\u00a0\u201cBe honest; you just want to eat ice cream, don\u2019t you?\u201c\u2026.. That\u2019s not it.\u201dIt was like that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

An orphan raised by the gardener?\u201dWrinkles appeared on Countess Brandt\u2019s forehead when she looked out at the garden from the window, mentioning a lady with glasses who was helping the gardener organize the rose garden.\u201cYes, mother, it\u2019s her\u2026. it\u2019s Leyla.\u201dClaudine gave a straightforward answer.\u00a0She threaded her needle through the fabric gently while her mother was distracted by Leyla who was working in the garden.As Claudine meticulously completed her embroidery, beautiful roses bloomed from her skillful fingertips.\u201cShe\u2019s a pretty young lady. As she grows older, I think she will become much more beautiful.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t that bother you?\u201d\u201cI understand your worry, mother,\u201dClaudine put her embroidered cloth on the table. Countess Brandt had a concerned smile on her face with her eyes wide open.Her frail mother only had one child.\u00a0Claudine, the Brandt family\u2019s only daughter, was the child she had after suffering from several miscarriages.The countess suffered from an inferiority complex. She always lived in fear that she might lose her husband\u2019s love because of her inability to produce a successor for him.Countess Brandt was still worried even though her husband\u2019s mistress was also unable to provide him with a son. She was scared that one day some young, pretty woman would show up and give birth to his son, then take everything away from her.Claudine felt sad for her mother about that. On the other hand, though, she was fed up with her mother\u2019s over-anxiety.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in dwelling on those matters.\u201dThrough a futile sigh, the countess expressed her dissatisfaction at Claudine\u2019s solemn words,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re too young to know about men\u2019s thoughts. Claudine, if I were you\u2026..\u201d\u201cWould you get rid of all the beautiful women in the world so Duke Herhardt wouldn\u2019t see them?\u201d Claudine grimaced at her mother. \u201cAs you said, I\u2019m still young and don\u2019t have a lot of experience with men. Yet I am aware that men with an excellent image normally have one or two mistresses.\u201d\u201cOh, my goodness, Claudine!\u201d\u201cOf course, I hope anything like this never happens, but even if it does, it won\u2019t bother me.\u201dClaudine shrugged her shoulders lightly.Truthfully, she, who was usually chill, was taken aback when she ran into Leyla by chance.Even though it was natural for a sweet little girl to develop into a beautiful lady, Leyla\u2019s mature beauty was more stunning than she had ever expected.Leyla resembled a fairy with her small, slender body and exquisite facial features.The resemblance to that mystical creature was enhanced by the combination of her enigmatic green eyes and her flawless white skin.Claudine had invited Leyla to join her for tea for this very reason. Her curiosity was piqued.\u00a0She was intrigued to see how the Duke would react to a woman such as her.And Matthias acted up to Claudine\u2019s expectation to a tee.\u00a0He showed proper interest and indifference, as well as impeccable decency and moderation.For Claudine, it was enough.\u201cEven so, Claudine, keeping that girl too close to Matthias isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201dCountess Brant was still agitated.\u201cDo you think I should talk with the Herhardt\u2019s?\u201d\u201cMother.\u201dClaudine\u2019s tone became muffled. She was adamant about not following in her mother\u2019s footsteps, who cried out of love while having everything. That was one of the reasons why she agreed to accept Matthias\u2019 proposal.Claudine was well aware that her life would not have a happy ending as in a fairy tale.Matthias von Herhardt was a nobleman who was both wealthy and attractive. That kind of guy, she believed, would never only love his wife, whom he wed in an arranged marriage.\u2018Perhaps he, too, would be carried away with his lust for a beautiful woman, just like my father. Like a lot of other guys.\u2019Men who merely looked at their mistress as a mistress were perfectly safe. But men who didn\u2019t treat their mistress as a mistress were the ones who caused trouble.Claudine was sure Matthias was, without a doubt, the first league type of man.\u2018Do I love him?\u2019Claudine simply smiled and tilted her head in answer to this question.\u2018Maybe or Maybe not.\u2019It wasn\u2019t, though, a big concern. Matthias also fully knew about this.What actually mattered most to her was whether Matthias, as Duke of Arvis, could play both the role of a wonderful husband and a great father.That was everything Claudine needed.\u00a0A marriage that would protect her dignity and preserve her elegance.\u201cIs it such a big deal if Duke Herhardt is interested in that humble, beautiful girl?\u201dCountess Brandt was gobsmacked by Claudine\u2019s words, which she had delivered calmly. \u201cOh my God, Claudine! What the hell are you talking about?\u201d\u201cAt the very least, she\u2019ll only end up as a mistress.\u201dClaudine made a noise as if it was a joke.\u201cFor a girl like that to become a mistress, it would really be convenient for me. A woman who wouldn\u2019t dare to invade my turf, who I can control within my palms.\u201d\u201cClaudine, my daughter. You\u2026\u2026 you really don\u2019t know anything about love.\u201dCountess Brandt\u2019s laments for her daughter became louder.Claudine stared into her mother\u2019s bright blue eyes before turning aside and smiling strangely.She gazed out the window at Leyla. Staring at that girl who rose off the flower field and started massaging her back while laughing.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The cottage was empty when Kyle arrived.Uncle Bill and Leyla seemed to be enjoying time together in the garden.Kyle sat on the porch in a chair, waiting for the two to come back. He grinned as he remembered Leyla\u2019s countenance with her glasses on.Even with her face covered with glasses, the future-Madam Etman still looked attractive.His heart fluttered at the thought of her face, notwithstanding the fact that he initially felt odd staring at her new appearance.Kyle coughed purposefully in a way to prevent his cheeks from turning flushed. At the same time, Leyla and Uncle Bill had returned from their work.\u201cGosh, what kind of hat is that?\u201dHis eyebrows suddenly furrowed as he saw a\u00a0bucolic\u00a0hat shielding Leyla\u2019s lovely face.\u201cDid you spend money on that \u201ctacky\u201d thing?\u201dAfter Kyle threw his teasing words around, both Leyla and Bill all turned their gaze towards him fiercely.\u201cUncle bought it for me!\u201dLeyla shouted, putting a scowled face towards Kyle. Bill joined in retaliating by taking up the shovel he\u2019d stowed in the cart.Kyle quickly changed his opinion. \u201cAfter seeing it again, I can\u2019t help but say, wow, how pretty it is! Uncle Bill has great eyes!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of it. It\u2019s really precious to me.\u201dThe sulking Leyla removed her flashy woodsy hat, which was lavishly decorated with artificial flowers and colourful ribbons.Bill was busy storing his cart while Leyla started preparing lunch. The problematic hat was positioned at the far end of the table.\u201cLeyla, are you mad?\u201dKyle took a seat in front of the hat, trying to decipher Leyla\u2019s mood.\u201cYeah.\u201d Leyla slammed Kyle\u2019s plate onto the table.\u2018At least she\u2019s still giving me food.\u2019\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You know I wouldn\u2019t say that if I knew?\u201d\u201cOh, whatever.\u201d\u201cBut why did Uncle Bill buy you a hat?\u201d\u201cBecause I asked him for it.\u201d\u201cYou? You know how to ask for stuff?\u201dKyle asked in surprise since all this time, he knew Leyla as a girl who barely requested something.\u201cHe\u2019s pissed off about my glasses\u201dLeyla\u2019s voice weakened as she said that.\u201cDid he get upset because your sight worsened?\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s not it. He was upset because I never told him that I purchased costly glasses from my own money.\u201dAfter she finished setting the table, Leyla took a seat across from Kyle.Bill was stupefied when she returned to the cottage with glasses on. He looked as if he had been shot in the back of the head.\u00a0His face became as cold as an ice block after listening to her explanation of how she could get her glasses installed.And it was the first time Uncle Bill had become so angry with her.\u2018Leyla. Am I unreliable to you?\u2019Uncle Bill sighed and sat back in his chair.Looking at his sad eyes made Leyla feel suffocated. When she clarified that she didn\u2019t want to burden him because she was already very grateful for what he had done for her, his eyes became sadder.Ever since that day, their relationship had become a little awkward.Bill was sulky and refused to speak, and Leyla felt stumped for words not knowing what to do.\u00a0The hat was the solution she had found in the end.\u2018Uncle, please buy me a hat.\u2019Until a few days ago, Leyla said something at the dinner table.\u2018I want a very pretty hat, please.\u2019Bill cracked up at her solemn tone. But the following evening, he went to the downtown shopping district to buy a pair of mechanical scissors.\u00a0He returned home with a straw hat adorned with flowers and ribbons.\u2018I bought it at Lindsay\u2019s, so if you don\u2019t like it, just return it.\u2019Uncle Bill carelessly added while giving out the hat.\u2018Did you choose this yourself?\u2019\u2018Well, yeah.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s so pretty.\u2019Leyla wore the hat with a bright smile on her lips.Bill had personally purchased several items for Leyla. Still, in most situations, he either requested Madam Mona to buy stuff for her or took Leyla to the store to pick on her own so she could pick what she wanted.Leyla knew very well that her uncle must have struggled to find a suitable hat feminine enough for her.She was aware of how big his love for her was.Flowers were the most exquisite thing in the world to Bill Remmer.He believed the prettiest hat was one with a lot of flowers.\u00a0So he felt sure that he had chosen the most beautiful hat for Leyla.\u201cHey! You should\u2019ve told me that before.\u201d\u00a0Kyle\u2019s face was rinsed with embarrassment as he listened closely.\u00a0\u201cNow I\u2019m feeling like a jerk for mocking that gift!\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a chance to talk. When you saw it, you teased me right away.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou sneaky gluttonous omnivore, you- You\u2019re eating all of my food again. Someday I will ask Dr. Etman to pay for all that food you ate here!\u201dBill roared loudly as he broke through the door. But his expression softened, and the tone of his voice was lighthearted, in contrast to his blunt language.Bill awkwardly chuckled as he saw the flower hat on the table. Kyle was almost pathetically jealous when Leyla flashed a to Bill sweetly.Every man who loved Leyla Lewellin had no option but to embrace his fate as second best in Leyla\u2019s heart.Because the number one person in her life would always be Uncle Bill.Kyle snatched up the fork to console himself. Uncle Bill\u2019s nagging didn\u2019t bother him at all.Bill\u2019s stern lectures sounded tolerable as long as he could have Leyla\u2019s tasty cooking.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Since Uncle Bill returned to work after lunch, Kyle and Leyla were the only ones staying in the cottage.Leyla sat on the patio, as usual, reading her book. Kyle pretended that he was reading while sneaking a peek at her in secret.She was wholly absorbed in her book, except for a brief moment where she had to put it down to enjoy some biscuits.\u2018Damn, I shouldn\u2019t have lent you that novel.\u2019Kyle grinned, despite his deep regret. Leyla might not have known, but he did. How charming her face was when she was concentrating on her book.With those luscious lips, she looked really pretty as she munched on her biscuits.\u2018Should I tell her today?\u2019Kyle placed his book on the floor and fixed a hard gaze on her face. He had planned to wait a little bit longer, but he was beginning to doubt himself.His heart felt like it was going to pop at the very brush of Leyla\u2019s fingertips. Kyle sensed his body heat up as he had a lot of\u00a0guilty\u00a0dreams about her.Moreover, he had lately been concerned about his anxiety. He was afraid that one day, someone would appear to steal her away from him.\u2018So wouldn\u2019t it be better to make a hasty confession?\u2019But the moment Kyle was ready to open his warm mouth, the sound of sluggish horseshoes could be heard from afar. Kyle twisted his head in the direction of the sound and saw Duke Herhardt in his\u00a0equestrian\u00a0uniform coming towards them.Leyla was about to take another bite of her biscuit when she was startled by the unexpected visitor.The Duke stopped his horse in front of the porch\u2019s fence.His glance brushed past Kyle and stuck on Leyla\u2019s flushed face of bewilderment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is there something that matters?\u201dLeyla was quick to answer after cleaning the biscuit crumbs from her lips.With a brief nod, Duke Herhardt turned his gaze towards Kyle.As he looked Kyle in the eyes, his lips curved into a courteous smile. Kyle soon relaxed, letting go of the tension in his shoulders.After expressing his appreciation and regards to Kyle\u2019s father for taking such good care of his grandmother\u2019s health, the duke looked back again at Leyla, \u201cMiss. Lewellin, you can bring the roses in on behalf of Mr. Bill, right?\u201dHe spoke softly. The smile on his lips disappeared.\u201cRoses? Do you mean the roses in the garden?\u201d\u201cJust cut a few roses moderately and bring them to my annex.\u201dThe duke turned away with a slight nod without even giving Leyla a chance to answer.Leyla frowned helplessly as she checked her blouse and skirt, all of which were littered with biscuit crumbs.Although she could clean off the dirt on it, Leyla couldn\u2019t get the shame out of her mind. Only Kyle giggled, watching Leyla rubbing her lips over and over.\u201cStop it. There aren\u2019t any crumbs left on your clothes anymore.\u201d\u201cWhy did he suddenly appear just like that?\u201d\u201cWhy are you so embarrassed? Do you think the duke has never eaten a snack in his life?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Leyla unwittingly rubbed her mouth again.\u201cWhy do you care so much when you always eat messily in front of me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re my friend.\u201d\u201cAnd Duke Herhardt is a stranger. So you don\u2019t need to care about him more than your friend.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true but\u2026. I don\u2019t know. I just felt uncomfortable.\u201d Leyla wrinkled her brows.\u201cWhy? Did something happen?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it, but\u2026 Every time I get close to him it feels very uncomfortable and suffocating. I really don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cThen, how do you feel about me? I\u2019m comfortable and nice right?\u201dHis voice tinged with anticipation.Leyla grinned and tucked her hat onto her head. \u201cOf course, Sir Etman.\u201dKyle\u2019s face brightened after he received a satisfactory answer.\u201cAs expected. I knew it. Ah, should I help you with your errand?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a big deal. You should go home now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wait here, then.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, your father will be very upset if he finds out you were hanging out here again. I don\u2019t want to get scolded alongside you. You should focus on your studies.\u201dKyle squirmed hearing Leyla\u2019s logical argument. He wished he could refute, but he couldn\u2019t. He then took a careful look in the direction where the Duke had disappeared.\u2018I\u2019m probably being too sensitive these days.\u2019Duke Herhardt was the only one there. The flawless aristocrat who would make his engagement announcement to the public.\u2018But\u2026..\u2019\u201cLeyla!\u201dKyle called, trying to stop her. Somehow, he was a little worried about Duke Herhardt and Leyla being alone together.Leyla was about to step off the porch, clutching a pair of scissors and a basket in her hands, before she said her goodbyes.\u201cSee you tomorrow, Kyle!\u201d\u2018Please, don\u2019t go.\u2019Swallowing the words he wanted to convey, Kyle just waved his hands.\u2018It\u2019s Duke Herhardt. Nothing bad would happen.\u2019Kyle was repeating those words like a spell, gazing at Leyla, who had crossed the path on the other side.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cDo it again.\u201dMatthias suddenly broke the silence.After a few moments of blinking, Leyla did realize that his words were directed at her.Leyla turned her body to face him with her breath feeling as if it was trapped in her lungs.Matthias sat on the couch near the window, opposite the butler. He was busy reviewing the documents that had stacked up on the table.\u201cWith non-flashy colours.\u201dMatthias spoke slowly with his eyes fixed on the papers he was holding in his hands.\u201cAgain.\u201dHis\u00a0lips cracked into a ridiculously tender smile when he stared at Leyla.Leyla clenched her fists tightly to cope with her accumulated frustration. The roses, which he instructed her to cut down \u2018moderately,\u2019 turned out to be the crux of the problem.Matthias\u2019 eyes became emotionless when Leyla arranged back the flowers.Hessen, the butler, continued his report, and Matthias, who had been listening, replied with some short instructions.The annoyed errand girl\u2019s presence in the room was totally obliterated.\u2018For Uncle Bill.\u2019While chanting the magic words, Leyla quietly left the annex near the river and headed to the garden.\u2018That guy, who torments a person at 2 p.m. in the middle of summer, is well-known as a gentleman.\u2019She was very vocal, expressing her dissatisfaction with his utterly unsuitable reputation.Despite her lack of interest in the mansion\u2019s affairs, Leyla was well aware that the separated annex, as well as the river, belonged to Duke Herhardt.He didn\u2019t have many visitors in his private annex\u2014the number of servants who came and out was also restricted to a few.Leyla first assumed it was because of Claudine that he wanted to display the flowers in his annex.Claudine was going to marry him, so there was a possibility she might have started using the annex as well.Knowing Claudine\u2019s love for colorful flowers, Leyla had cut down the flashy colored roses and brought them to the annex, only to get rejected by him.The shadowless garden appeared in sight when Leyla came out from the woods. She took a bold step and cut the roses with great care once more.\u00a0To meet the Duke\u2019s stressful demands, she decided to pick soft-colored roses this time, the color of roses that she favored.She returned to the annex under the sweltering summer afternoon heat, carrying a basket full of roses.\u2018Damn it, why didn\u2019t he tell me what color he wanted from the beginning?\u2019Instead of spitting out the words she had in mind, Leyla vented her anger at the duke by kicking the stones on the ground.\u2018I hate him.\u2019The cursing words, something that Leyla could never direct at him explicitly, were left behind, along with the stones she deliberately kicked.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla arrived in front of the detached building just when she started to get dizzy from the scorching sun.The idyllic annex next to the dock was designed to appear as if it were half-floating on the river.On the first floor, there was a boat cabin and a kitchen with simple snacks and drinks. While the living space, a bedroom, and a dining hall where he could rest and dine were all situated on the second level.Leyla climbed the outer stairs that led straight to the second floor with the basket of roses in her hands. She ran into the butler and a middle-aged cleaner who were making their way out of the annex.After voicing her farewells to them, Leyla headed to the reception room. Matthias was still sitting in his chair with his eyes closed and his head cocked back.\u2018Should I wait him to wake up?\u2019In the middle of her reverie, Matthias spontaneously opened his eyes.\u00a0 His matted hair framed his forehead, gently covering it.\u201cMy lord, I\u2019ve brought you new roses.\u201dLeyla slightly lifted her flower-filled basket.Matthias didn\u2019t open his mouth and just stared at the cup of whiskey placed in front of him. He\u2019d stripped his horse riding jacket and undone a few buttons on his shirt. His current getup made him look much more defenseless and languorous than usual.\u201cShould I\u2026\u2026 go back again?\u201dLeyla asked carefully with her quivering voice. She really wanted to slap the Duke with the roses if he ordered her back to the garden again.\u201cAre you going to go if I tell you to?\u201dMatthias asked her back. His voice carried a slight drowsiness.\u201cIf I made another mistake, I\u2019d go, but please let me know what color roses you want this time.\u201dYes, my lord.-\u00a0That was the answer she had intended to say, yet her mouth said something else.Matthias, who had been leaning deep against the chair\u2019s back, straightened his stance and sat upright.\u201cSit down.\u201dMatthias gestured to the chair placed on the opposite side of the table with his eyes.\u201cNo, if my lord is satisfied, now I\u2019d\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be your job to arrange the flowers in a vase if you brought them, Miss Lewellin?\u201d\u201cBut my lord, I\u2019m not very good at arranging flowers.\u201d\u201cThen, do you expect me to do it?\u201dMatthias took a brief glance around the room before turning his eyes back to her.Leyla had no trouble figuring out what his slight gesture meant. They were the only ones left in this detached building. That\u2019s why she had no choice but to do something in which she lacked confidence.Leyla took a step forward, a little hesitantly. She carefully sat on the wooden stool in front of the window that faced the river because the seat opposite the Duke was too arduous for her.Matthias moved to his stacks of documents littered around the table when she started trimming the roses.The noise of the scissor blade slashing through the fresh flower stem and the flapping of the document paper was drowned out by the milieu of the silent room.After he finished signing the last document he had reviewed, Matthias suddenly remembered the bird living in his mansion bedroom.The zookeeper\u2019s words- that canary birds were difficult to tame were proven false. The canary in his bedroom was docile towards him and avowedly sang while perching on his finger.The flapping bird on his finger chirped a little as if it were telling about its day. He kept looking at it for a long time, stunned by the fact that such a little bird could sing so beautifully.When Matthias was busily sorting his papers, Leyla quietly went to the bathroom and filled the vase with water.*\u201cDo you like it?\u201dLeyla hesitantly asked as she brought up the roses-filled vase to him.Her words earlier were quickly proven to be true after her one look at the flower arrangement which was showing up to be a total failure.\u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201dMatthias\u2019 tone was not condescending, but it was a little flat.Leyla blinked her eyes in shock, and her face blushed red with embarrassment.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll bring in a skilled maid.\u201d\u201cSit.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cSit, Leyla.\u201dAs Matthias lowered his voice, the atmosphere of the room grew more uncomfortable.\u00a0His fingers were aiming in the precise direction of the sofa across from him.Leyla sat stiffly where he had suggested after putting the disastrous rose vase on a console table near her.Matthias then shifted his focus to the dish covered by the silver dome on the coffee table next to the sofa.\u201cEat.\u201dLeyla opened the dome-shaped cover awkwardly, and she found sandwiches and a glass of lemonade prepared for one person.Matthias kept his eyes on the puzzled Leyla. He planned to give her enough money to pay her work fee after she filled her stomach with those refreshments.Her work result was poor at best, but she had placed a huge amount of time and effort on making it.\u201cThank you, my lord. But I\u2019m fine.\u201dWith shaky hands, Leyla placed the dome dish shut. Her expression, which had previously sparked a brilliant smile in front of Kyle, now seemed disturbed.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to do anything else, I\u2019ll take my leave\u2026.\u201d\u201cLeyla.\u201dLeyla\u00a0was\u00a0stupefied, her\u00a0eyes flickered in slow motion.Matthias\u2019s voice had dwindled to almost a whisper.He took a sip of the icy whisky in front of him. The droplets on the crystal glass\u2019s surface gently trickled down his long-gracile fingers.\u201cDo my words sound like I\u2019m begging you?\u201dMatthias scoffed with his lips reddened, wetting with the cold whiskey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11\u2727 Deep Water \u2727The annex was surrounded by large windows attached on all sides. It presented a magnificent view of the forest and the Schulter river.The good wind circulation in the place also contributed to the coolness of its environment.Today\u2019s weather was much hotter than yesterday, making it difficult to feel any cold shivers.Leyla, however, felt as if chills were running through her spine.She was eager to eat faster and leave, but the food in front of her didn\u2019t seem to lessen in proportion.Leyla couldn\u2019t ingest anything because she had already eaten lunch and a snack. To make it worse, doing an errand in the sweltering sun had made her lose her appetite.Leaning back in his chair, Matthias focused on his task, but she was still having trouble breathing properly.\u2018Damn it, Is he punishing me for my failed errand and flower arrangement?\u2019Leyla couldn\u2019t quit thinking about this as she took another slice of her\u00a0serving-sandwich. If that\u2019s the case, Duke Herhardt had attained his mission.Leyla had the impression that she was being punished.She drank the lemonade swiftly to help her swallow her sandwich before vomiting it out. After wiping the water droplets from her hands with her apron she picked up another slice.Leyla then lowered the edge of her hat to hide her horrified face. But at that precise moment, someone\u2019s long finger suddenly touched the tip of her chin.\u201cLeyla, if you\u2019re a lady\u2026.\u201d\u00a0With his finger, Matthias untied the hat\u2019s ribbon that had been knotted under her chin.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to take off this hat when you\u2019re inside the house.\u201dMatthias removed her straw hat.Leyla was taken aback at his sudden action and scampered from the sofa.\u00a0Her half-eaten sandwich fell and rolled onto the floor.Matthias squinted his eyes, but Leyla\u2019s gaze was solely on her hat.\u201cGi- give it back.\u201dNo longer was Leyla\u2019s voice shaking in fear, but rather, it had turned into rage.\u201cGive it back, please. I\u2019m going to leave now. I want to go home. Return it to me.\u201dMatthias tightly clutched the stolen hat as he had no intention of returning it. Leyla reacted as if she he had been stripped naked even though he had taken only her hat.The rosy flush on her cheeks, spreading down to her neck mesmerized him.Her sensitive skin had reacted easily to her angry emotions.\u201cEat.\u201dMatthias pointed to the plate, which still had two uneaten slices of sandwiches.\u201cEat your food, get your hat, and go home. It\u2019s simple.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d Leyla shook her head and got closer to him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat anything. I can\u2019t eat anymore. I hate it.\u201dLeyla\u2019s terrified eyes were trembling. She couldn\u2019t believe the words were coming out of her mouth.Matthias sat up from his chair, tightening his grip on the hat.\u201c\u2026\u2026You hate it?\u201dThe petrified shadow from his towering figure had cast a pall over her.\u201cI was wrong, so please give it back.\u201dLeyla reached out her hand. She was about to cry.Matthias stared at her eyes that followed his every move, and slowly raised the hat over his head.And, when their eyes confronted each other\u2026Matthias threw it loosely over the window.The wind swept up the hat, and it lightly flew into the river.Leyla was dumbfounded.She gave him a scathing glare and furiously hurried out of the room.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias made his way to the front window, which overlooked the river\u2019s dock.Leyla had arrived there.She began stamping her foot in panic after seeing her hat floating in the water and abruptly took off her apron and glasses, throwing them on the pier.\u2018Is she going to jump into the river just to get that stupid hat?\u2019There\u2019s a look of great delight on Matthias\u2019s face as he was standing behind the window, observing her.Leyla looked to be shaking from her knees down, and she seemed afraid of the water.\u2018Pfft..Is she serious?\u2019Leyla plunged into the river. She took a moment before heading towards her hat.Matthias found Leyla Lewellin interesting as she kept walking even though the water level had now reached her feet, then waist, and chest.He stood still and watched her with his arms folded.Leyla extended her hand to the utmost, but the river stream had driven her hat farther away.When Matthias thought she was about to give up, Leyla\u00a0once again took a broader step closer to the hat.Her hand successfully grabbed its ribbon.\u2018By now, the water level should be higher than her head.\u2019Matthias slowly tilted his head at the same time when Leyla suddenly disappear from the river surface.\u201cAs expected.\u201dMatthias sighed and muttered lightly.That girl drowned precisely at the spot he had predicted.Leyla struggled desperately to raise her head after she was shocked by the sudden, drastic depthening of the water. She was clutching onto her hat, hanging on for her dear life. But the more she struggled, the deeper she was drawn into the river.Matthias took quick strides toward the dock.His other prediction turned out to be true. Leyla Lewellin had jumped into the water despite not knowing how to swim.Matthias stopped at the end of the pier and looked at the floundering Leyla. Her scream gradually faded as she repeatedly emerged-submerged from the surface of the water.\u2018Silly girl, she just needs to eat, get the hat, and go home.\u00a0What a ruckus she caused when she could have done that simple task\u2019Matthias clenched his lips, then dove into the river.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Under the sun, the wooden panels on the dock that touched her cheek were hot.Leyla realized she had safely come out of the water after she felt the vividness of the heat. But the relief was short-lived when pain and fear took its place.Leyla shivered. A deluge of coughs came out of her lips. Even in her current state, still, she refused to let go of the hat she was holding onto.While gasping for air, Matthias stared at Leyla\u2019s blowsy appearance in front of him. The droplets of water from her soaking body had left a dark stain on the wooden panel.Shortly after, Matthias spat out a mixture of shallow breaths and laughed in a low voice.Leyla glared at him.\u201cHow\u2026.. could you\u2026do something like this\u2026.?\u201dED/N: It\u2019s because he\u2019s a total scumbag. Run dear Leyla! >.<She asked with a panting voice and gave Matthias a look seeming to say how nasty he was.But it was the tears in her eyes that attracted his attention.Matthias swept his wet hair away from his forehead and chuckled at her as if she were something entertaining.His laughter even grew louder when Leyla could finally catch her breath.Droplets of water poured down from her wet hair like rain. Leyla raised her upper body off the boiling hardwood floor with her shaking hands.Her eyes were red, but she didn\u2019t cry. Instead, she kept her gaze fixed on Matthias\u2014 the evil man with a friendly smile.Leyla changed her mind after failing to think about what to say, and stood up.Her body lines were strikingly exposed behind the thin, wet clothing. Matthias then looked up at her, as he rested on the wooden floor, posing like he was having a sunbath.He still focused on her trembling shoulders when Leyla wagged her soaked hat at him.The water droplets splashed on his face. Leyla flinched a bit, but she didn\u2019t let it deter her from exacting her revenge.After wearing a hat that was still dripping with water, Leyla flicked back her skirt. She glared at Matthias with provocative eyes.\u201cIs it fun?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m starting to get a little bored.\u201dMatthias said, as he dried his damp face with his hand. His laughter faded soon and returned to his stony look.\u201cHow\u2026 What\u2026 Why\u2026 Are you doing this to me?\u201dDespite being gripped with fear, Leyla didn\u2019t divert her gaze from him.\u201cLeyla, your gratitude.\u201dMatthias slowly rolled his wet shirt\u2019s sleeves up.\u201cYour gratitude to your lifesaver.\u201dHe teased Leyla at random, who was astonished and looked at him in disbelief.\u201cI don\u2019t think any of this would have happened if you hadn\u2019t thrown my hat into the river.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0Matthias furrowed his eyebrows.\u00a0\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened if you had patiently eaten the sandwich and then left.\u201dLeyla frowned as he talked in a far too calm voice to be taken as a joke.\u201cAnd also, if you hadn\u2019t made the foolish decision to jump into the water even though you don\u2019t know how to swim.\u201dMatthias lightly wiped the dripping water from his forehead with the tip of his finger.Uncle Bill. Uncle Bill. Uncle Bill.\u2013 silently recited the incantation many times,\u00a0 Leyla clenched her teeth and hunched her back.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Thank you for saving me, Your Grace.\u201d\u201cAgain.\u201dMatthias scoffed as though he wanted to be certain of her sincerity.\u201cOnce again. Like a lady.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even break into a smile or laugh.\u201cPlease accept my sincere apologies, Your Grace; I\u2019m not like the other aristocratic ladies. I am not even a lady.\u201dMatthias, without expression, quietly looked at Leyla,\u00a0 who leaked out her words of frustration.The water drops on his fingertips fell on her foot.\u201cWhoever you are, I\u2019m still the Duke.\u201dMatthias grinned at her.Leyla grasped her soaked skirt and her body stiffened. Droplets of water from the straw hat\u2019s brim landed on the dock\u2019s wooden floor.\u201cThank you very much for saving my life, Your Grace.\u201dLeyla lowered her head, articulating every word accurately, amid her body trembling to the extent that her teeth clashed against each other. She delivered a courteous bow, much like the graceful lady Matthias had wanted her to be.With a nod of his chin, Matthias gave a pass to her ladylike gratitude.\u2018Leyla Lewellin\u2026. don\u2019t cry.\u2019Leyla tightened her fist.\u2018Don\u2019t cry because of someone like that, please.\u2019After comforting herself, Leyla straightened her waist.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll go back now. I wish you farewell, Your Grace.\u201dFirmly, Leyla turned around, leaving Matthias standing still on the dock.The water droplets dripped from her skirt made a long trail following her footsteps for quite a distance.Her legs were lax, and she was on the verge of falling several times, but Leyla fought tirelessly to not relax her leg muscles.She gritted her teeth and vowed that she wouldn\u2019t fall today. That she\u2019d never been his toy anymore.\u2018Never.\u2019Leyla took to running once she was out of Matthias\u2019 sight.The shade of her hat couldn\u2019t hide her sad eyes because they were too red.\u00a0Leyla ran harder and faster, steadily increasing her speed.One day, she happened to see it by chance.\u00a0How Matthias and Claudine were taking a stroll through the forest.The elegant gentleman was escorting the alluring lady.That scene was like something out of a fairy tale or a courting novel.The wind suddenly blew Claudine\u2019s hat off as they reached the end of the road.Matthias approached the hat slowly, taking it and giving it back to her.His gesture was so composed and elegant.By the time Leyla wondered how he could always move with such elegance, they had already disappeared from her sight.That gentleman had humiliated her today with the same\u00a0graceful gesture he had made that day.Leyla stopped running as she realized the drastic contrast in his attitude towards her and Claudine.Her complexion had turned a whitish color. She stumbled to the grass to vomit up the food she had crammed down her stomach.Her eyes welled up with tears, but she refused to cry.Once her nausea had receded, Leyla went to the shallow stream that flowed through the forest to wash her mouth . She looked much better after resting for a while in the shade of the trees.Leyla headed to the road leading to the cottage while rubbing her lips again with the back of her hand.\u00a0She didn\u2019t have much more energy to sprint, so she trudged along with her legs dragging.Her stockings and skirt were dirtied. But she ignored it as her appearance was already messyWhen the cottage in sight, she summoned all of her remaining strength and kicked the hazel tree fruit off the side of the road.But that roll-down fruit on the ground suddenly realizing her the fatal mistake she had made,\u201cMy glasses\u2026\u201dLeyla\u2019s face crumpled up in a flash.She felt as if the road she was looking back on was so long and winding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His long fingers gently grazed the armrest, slowly tapping along to the beat.Matthias momentarily focused on the shabbily arranged rose vase next to the mantel before turning his gaze out the window.The weather became colder as evening approached. The wind from the river swayed his robe before making its way out into the forest.He reached out and opened the lid of a small silver box that had been placed at his working table.The waltz song ended when he took a cigarette from the box and lit it.The mid-evening of a summer day was monotonous and unexciting.Matthias smoked whilst listening to the following lively string music.\u00a0When the second song stopped, he picked up Leyla\u2019s glasses, which he had carelessly dumped in the tray next to him, and put them on his face.The world he viewed through the lenses made him dizzy. Her vision seemed to be pretty bad.Is that why she frowned all the time?Matthias was suddenly reminded of the little girl who was always looking at him with a grumpy face.Despite her frail look, the scrawny-humble young lady\u2019s eyes were gleaming brightly.The child who was supposed to stay for a brief time in Matthias\u2019 world had grown and matured into a woman.Her skinny features got hidden by the attention her slender face attracted, which was framed by thin gold-rimmed glasses.A fresh and sweet fragrance always seemed to linger on the girl with those shimmering eyes.The scent of a rose.The flower that filled Arvis\u2019s summer garden.Matthias went out to the balcony that stretched out towards the riverside.He let out a long stream of his cigarette smoke while loosely clutching Leyla\u2019s glasses.His shadow lengthened as he casually played throw-catch with her glasses several times.\u201cLeyla.\u201dHe whispered in the humid summer evening.\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dMatthias had to tickle the tip of his tongue to say her annoying name without stuttering.After returning to the reception room, Matthias put her glasses in the console table drawer.The memory of the emerald eyes he had seen through her glasses vanished as soon as he closed the drawer.Matthias then went to the bathroom and took a warm shower. He changed his clothes and waxed his hair.He was back to being the model Duke of Arvis by the time he left the annex to attend dinner.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cWhat if the raven stole it again?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u2026 I hope not.\u201d Leyla shrugged as she sat on the table with a grim face when Bill asked her with some jest.\u201cJust saying. They\u2019re the type of birds that would go nuts if they see something sparkling. Your hairpin, remember?\u201dBill guffawed. The nostalgia he brought up made Leyla\u2019s face stiff; she soon joined him in laughter.Leyla\u2019s thirteenth birthday gift from Uncle Bill was a gleaming hairpin.Chef Mona chose it after researching the types of hairpins that were popular among girls her age.Leyla tried to keep the pin in carefully. It would have remained in her closet forever if Bill hadn\u2019t threatened to throw it out if she didn\u2019t wear it right away.The pin, however, met its inevitable fate on the first day she wore it.The raven took away the pin Leyla had put on the fence while working in the garden.It was an incident that caused Leyla, who adored all birds, to now have a hatred towards ravens.\u201cIf you can\u2019t find it, tell me.\u201dBill strained his voice as if he were requesting.\u201cDon\u2019t make such a face; I can buy you a new one. Okay?\u201d\u201cOkay, uncle.\u201d Leyla flashed a smile. \u201cI will.\u201dShe could answer back because she was sure her glasses were at the dock.\u00a0 She had dropped them there before jumping into the river.Leyla was distraught the following day when she came back to the riverbank. Her glasses were nowhere to be found although she had checked the dock as well as the annex\u2019s surrounding area carefully.Her unfolded apron was still there, but not with her glasses.She suspected the wind had blown it away, but she discarded her assumption because the apron was still on the dock.Leyla was sure she removed her glasses first, followed by her apron. It seemed impossible for her glasses to disappear on their own.No way\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me?Leyla snooped around in front of the annex. But then, she scratched her head as though it was just nonsense.The duke has no reason to take it.With her drooping shoulders, Leyla turned back.She was cursing herself for not returning sooner to pick up her glasses just because she was scared of running into the duke.\u201cIs it him?\u201dLeyla muttered beneath her breath, her gaze fixed on the raven perched on a branch. The bird cocked its head multiple times before flying away into the forest.Leyla clenched her fist and took big strides as she frowned. She would return to her cottage first, have breakfast, then rethink what she would do with a clearer mind.The suspect who stole her glasses seemed to be one of the two.The raven, or the duke.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Kyle smiled and slid the window open when he saw a snow-white pigeon sitting in front of the trellis.\u201cHey, Phoebe.\u201dThe pigeon didn\u2019t flee even though Kyle had reached out his hand and took the letter from its leg.The mountain pigeon named Phoebe was Leyla Lewellin\u2019s personal messenger.Leyla, who had been fascinated by birds since childhood, read a book about the mailing pigeons that could deliver letters. From that moment, she had a great desire to have such a pigeon for herself.\u2018Sure. Go ahead.\u2019Kyle, who had sneered at her dream, never imagined that the day would come until an ancient-like legendary letter carrier suddenly flew through his bedroom window.That tenacious girl, Leyla Lewellin, pulled it off.Despite many failures, Leyla never gave up and eventually could train the bird.It was late spring when Phoebe-a lovely bird with gleaming white feathers and black eyes- first flew into his window two years ago.Kyle opened the window, and the pigeon that had brought Leyla\u2019s letter was staring at him.[Hello, Mr. Etman]Leyla\u2019s letter, delivered by the pigeon that day, only contained one short line long.But Kyle was able to read many other things -Leyla\u2019s excitement celebrating her achievement with her eyes sparkling with joy.\u2013Leyla.My dear friend, Leyla.Delivering-pigeon in a world like today?Kyle chuckled at the absurdity, but he fully understood. Phoebe was, in a way, a telephone for her.The letter-carrying pigeons were very effective in a cottage where there was no telephone.However, Leyla\u2019s messenger delivered heartbreaking news in today\u2019s letter.Kyle, I\u2019ve lost my glasses. I have to look for it, so I can\u2019t go to the library with you. I\u2019m so sorry.Phoebe flew away from the window after finishing her job.Kyle read the letter with a grim expression on his face. He dashed out of his place after sandwiching the folded letter between two thick books on his desk.\u201cKyle Etman! Are you going to Leyla\u2019s place again?\u201dKyle only smiled when his father frowned at the sight of him going down the stairs.\u201cYou need to study, Kyle!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll study at Leyla\u2019s place!\u201dKyle walked out the front door, leaving only a cheerful answer behind.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The shiny chrome bicycle slid off Etman\u2019s house.Kyle frantically peddled his bicycle as he grew more impatient as he passed Arvis territory.He wasn\u2019t interested in visiting the library because he had made that promise purely only to be with her.And now, Kyle was really worried.Those were the glasses she bought with her diligent work.His heart ached as he thought of Leyla, the foolish girl who saved and earned money by making jam and selling it solely because she was afraid of becoming a burden to Uncle Bill.\u201cUh, Kyle?\u201dLeyla, who was hanging the laundry, seemed shocked when the silver bicycle yelped to a stop.\u201cHey, did you find your glasses?\u201d\u201cNo. Not yet.\u201dLeyla\u2019s face went glum.\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a new one!\u201dKyle blurted out because he didn\u2019t want to see the unhappy Leyla.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Kyle. You? Why?\u201dLeyla responded with a quizzical look in her eyes.Kyle had just remembered what he\u2019d said. He\u2019d let his emotions get the better of him, and he\u2019d forgotten what kind of person she was.\u201cThank you, Kyle, but I can\u2019t.\u201dLeyla smiled softly to camouflage his shame.\u201cI want to find my glasses.\u201dHer eyes were firm, in contrast to her smiling lips.Kyle was cognizant of those eyes.It was the eyes of Leyla Lewellin, the tenacious woman who refused to give up no matter what.\u201cI\u2019ll find it for sure.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla had been rummaging through the forest for days. Kyle, the doctor\u2019s son, also helped her.Matthias pretended not to notice their admirable endeavors. Otherwise, it was pretty interesting for him to watch them sift through the innocent bird nests.Does she really don\u2019t know, or is she pretending not to know?Matthias halted in his steps as he ascended the annex stairs and eyed the vast forest\u2019s landscape along the river.He was about to get bored of their folly. He was also growing tired of coming to this place over the past few days, only to chortle at their futile questing efforts amid his packed schedule.Matthias went up the stairs, sweeping his hair back, which had become messy thanks to the heavy wind. Hessen, who followed him behind, cautiously opened the door and took a step back after.Matthias walked into the reception room. He leaned against the window, viewing the forest instead of sitting on the couch.\u201cMarquis Lindman will arrive today around noon.\u201d\u201cRiette? His arrival is sooner than planned.\u201d\u201cThe Duchess has instructed me to pay careful attention to the luncheon. She invited you to come if you didn\u2019t have any other appointments.\u201d\u201cSure. I will.\u201dThe chiffon curtains that enclosed half the window slowly inflated when a gust of wind blew in.Matthias\u2019 eyes narrowed when the curtain flattened, and he saw the road lit up by the lucid sunshine.Leyla stood at the road\u2019s edge, under the shade of a tree. She wandered around there with her hands clenched together.Perhaps she isn\u2019t a knucklehead.Matthias silently grinned and returned his attention to Hessen\u2019s reports while that middle-aged maid poured him a glass of cool lemon water.The sound of ice clattering in the glass was satisfying to hear.The maid and the butler left the room after finishing their job. Matthias watched the scenery again outside the window with the long-necked glass cup in his hand.Leyla began walking towards the river after the maid and butler were fully out of sight.The tranquil annex\u2019s doorbell rang not long after.And Matthias slowly rose from his seat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13\u2727 A Night Under the Moonlit \u2727Unlike the day she left the annex with anger, the Leyla right now was looking like a gentle and naive young lady.Matthias eyed the \u2018gentle\u2019 Leyla while daintily leaning on the couch.\u201cI sincerely apologise for this sudden discourtesy, your grace.\u201dLeyla hesitated before speaking and kept her head down to avoid his eyes. Her long, thick eyelashes seemed to be the reason why she left a gentle impression when she lowered her eyes.\u201cPardon me, but I\u2019d like to ask you something.\u201dLeyla finally managed to open her lips after spending several seconds wetting them. But the phone started ringing at that precise moment.Matthias slowly rose to his feet, passing by her to pick up the phone. It seemed to be a business call about a complex deal he needed to check up on.Leyla looked a bit surprised when she saw him speaking on the phone. Matthias steered the conversation with finesse. Even with his fleeting smiles and courteous way of talking, she could tell that he held an aura of power and dignity that overwhelmed the person on the other end of the line. He appeared to be the perfect Duke of Arvis, whom everybody admired.\u2018No way.\u2019She sighed. Her suspicion that a man like him had stolen her glasses sounded ludicrous right now.\u2018I feel like I\u2019m doing something useless\u2026.. Then was the culprit the raven?\u2019While counting how many ravens\u2019 nests there might be in the forest, Leyla politely excused herself to the duke, who was on the phone and was about to leave.\u201cWait.\u201dMatthias unexpectedly turned to her while still holding the phone\u2019s mouthpiece. His short order sounded like it was someone else\u2019s. His voice was nothing like that of the great Duke of Arvis she had heard while he was on the phone.Leyla froze. Matthias then refocused on his vocation again as if nothing had happened.She found another trait in Matthias von Herhardt while watching him.His eyes remained calm even though he was having a professional talk. His smile was relaxed as well. His stance, on the other hand, was uniformly graceful and straight.\u00a0Even if the phone caller couldn\u2019t see him, Matthias maintained his posture as though it were a natural trait of his body and Leyla felt a twinge of admiration.Matthias headed to the front of the table after keeping the call on hold a few more minutes and scribbled something down.Leyla grasped her wriggling hands behind her back nervously. By the time she thought he had forgotten about her presence, Matthias\u2019s attention finally turned to her.\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to ask.\u201dMatthias\u2019s gaze made her anxious, so Leyla slowly lowered her eyes.\u201cAh\u2026.. The thing is, my glasses. I was wondering, if you saw my glasses at the dock\u2026..on the day I jumped into the river.\u201d\u201cWell. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen it\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Matthias rose slowly from his seat and began approaching her.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s likely I hid it.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026.. What?\u201dLeyla\u2019s head shot up in shock.\u201cMy glasses. Did you really hide it?\u201d\u201cWhat are your thoughts?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve done something like that.\u201dLeyla answered with a slight frown.\u201cWhy?\u201dMatthias cocked his head, amusement clear on his face. His black hair, which swayed gently on his forehead, resembled a raven\u2019s feather.\u201cBecause\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s rude.\u201dLeyla curled up her feet, trying not to take a step back. She summoned the courage to come here after days of digging the ravens\u2019 nests with Kyle.Despite her dislike for the duke, she could at least communicate with him, unlike the ravens. Leyla felt like it would be better to quickly eliminate either one of the two suspects, the crow or the duke.\u00a0But she wasn\u2019t sure now.Leyla wasn\u2019t sure whether the duke, whose enigmatic remarks only added to her confusion, was really a person she could communicate with.For a lengthy moment, they stared into each other\u2019s eyes without saying a word. The moment would have lasted a little longer if the butler hadn\u2019t returned to the annex with an urgent telegram and letter.With a flush on her cheeks, Leyla made her way towards the window.Matthias cast an abstruse glance her way after a low-key talk with the butler. Leyla couldn\u2019t tell for sure because her glasses were missing, but his red lips seemed to be subtly curved.\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201dLeyla opened her mouth with all the bravery she could muster, but Matthias quickly cut her off by lifting his chin towards the door.It was a succinct yet icy gesture, indicating he left no room for Leyla Lewellin.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cA bird. Why has your hobby become so odd all of a sudden?\u201dRiette, Matthias\u2019 cousin, had a confused smile as he looked at the yellow bird inside the beautiful golden cage.\u201cAre you going to raise a bird and shoot it yourself?\u201dThe people gathered in the mansion suite reception room laughed at Riette\u2019s jokes. Matthias let out a brief chuckle too, but his responses went unheard. Riette then inserted a couple more comedic phrases, along with the servants who came in with the champagne in their hands.A grand dinner was being served at the Herhardts\u2019 residence to celebrate the reunion of all the families who had spent the summer together.\u00a0Matthias, Claudine, Riette, and other aristocrats of similar ages had moved to the reception area after finishing their meal.They could rest in the master suite room, which Matthias only used, thanks to Claudine\u2019s special request. Matthias, who never shared his private space, tended to be very accommodating to his fiance as he granted her his godly permission.The relatives almost unanimously confirmed Matthias and Claudine\u2019s marriage. It was plain why Countess Brandt came to Arvis every year with her only daughter and why the Herhardt family presented such a warm welcome to them whenever they visited their house.None of the relatives were shocked by their marriage announcement.It was as though one of nature\u2019s dreams had come true. They would have been much more taken aback if Matthias had selected a different woman.\u201cThat bird doesn\u2019t seem to know Duke Herhardt\u2019s real personality.\u201dThe canary bird flew out of the open cage and landed on Matthias\u2019 shoulder, causing Riette to crack up laughing.\u201cA bird in love with the master of bird hunting. Should I describe this as calvish or pitiful?\u201dMatthias reached out his hand, and the bird hopped over his finger.\u201cClaudine, what do you think?\u201dFollowing Riette\u2019s question, everyone\u2019s eyes were drawn to Claudine.\u201cWell. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0Claudine cast a look at Matthias\u2019s finger, which was decorated with a singing yellow bird.\u00a0\u201cYou could call it a calvish but pitiful bird.\u201dHer compromise elicited yet another explosion of laughter.The mood in the reception room was warm and friendly since they hadn\u2019t seen each other in many years.The names everyone knew, the world everyone shared, the same interests everyone had. It was an elite society where only they were permitted to join.\u201cThat bird, what\u2019s its name?\u201d\u00a0Claudine asked, wanting to know, in a pleasant tone.\u00a0\u201cWould you like me to name it for you if you don\u2019t have one for it yet?\u201dMatthias turned his eyes to Claudine and smiled at her.\u201cIt\u2019s not worth your effort, my lady.\u201dHis expression seemed to be the same as before, but it somehow had a subtle difference about it.\u201cA bird is just a bird.\u201dIn contrast to his tender gaze to the singing bird on his fingers, his answer was cold and unfeeling.\u201cSuch a stupid poor bird.\u201d Riette sighed audibly, voicing his sympathy for the bird.\u201cThat bird loves a hunter who doesn\u2019t allow it to have its own name!\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The group of people who had been laughing and joking over the champagne resided in the suite until late at night.Matthias left the mansion for a night stroll alone, passing by the servants who had come in to tidy up the reception room.\u00a0\u00a0No more smiles on his lips; his face was as quiet as the night sky.It was time to check the trap he laid.She wasn\u2019t a fool and must have noticed, but Matthias knew she wouldn\u2019t give up.That\u2019s why he was confident she\u2019d be caught.Matthias walked through the rose garden. The wind grew colder as he got closer to the river and then through the forest. His steps came to a halt in front of the riverside annex.The full moon shone a pure white light.Matthias entered the annex\u2019s reception room and approached the console table, opening the drawer.\u00a0The neatly placed glasses glinted in the light of the moon.He laid his sleepy body on the couch, holding the glasses as though it were his canary.What do I want from the bait I\u2019ve set up?As he looked at the glasses, Matthias pondered something. He was having trouble coming up with an answer but he wasn\u2019t impatient.He believed he would find out once he apprehended her.The night grew deeper as he repeatedly threw the glasses up and down.It was a moonlit night.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was no less than a crazy act.Leyla was really conscious. No one in their right state of mind would dare to sneak into the duke\u2019s annex.\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s just sleep.\u201dLeyla flung herself into the bunk after circling the room. She swaddled herself in a thin blanket and squeezed her eyes firmly.\u201cMy glasses\u2026\u201dYet, she didn\u2019t get to sleep. Leyla felt certain in her action. Whereas she realized she was silly, she nevertheless kept on doing so.She needed to get her glasses.Leyla sprang to her feet. She speculated that Matthias could not have taken it to his mansion, so she believed her glasses were likely in the annex.\u201cYes. It\u2019s all right.\u201dWith a compelling murmur to no one but her own self, Leyla opened the door.\u00a0The cottage was shrouded with inky blackness. No other noise could be heard but for Uncle Bill\u2019s snoring.She took up a lace shawl that dangled on the wall and rushed out of the cabin.\u00a0\u00a0Whenever she had second thoughts, Leyla recalled all the fruits she had picked and all the jam she had cooked to afford the purchase of those glasses.\u201cAfter all, it\u2019s my glasses.\u201dLeyla eased her fear by talking to herself as she saw the glittering Schulter River in the distance. Her light blonde hair, which hung down to her waist, wafted along with the fast-paced movement of her steps.But the more she learned about it, the more she realized Duke Herhardt was a strange person.Somehow, Leyla had an epiphany as she walked down the dock walkway linking to the annex.\u2018Is he a lover of sparkly stuff like the raven?\u2019Amidst her questioning mixed with vexation, Leyla finally arrived in front of the annex, where her glasses were hidden.She noticed she was still in her pajamas, but she brushed it off since it was the middle of the night and nobody was around to see her.Lelya inhaled deeply as she took a step forward.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Exactly as he had expected.Once again, the actions of Leyla Lewellin didn\u2019t deviate from Matthias\u2019 expectations.Matthias\u2019s breath became more pronounced and deliberate when he heard the footsteps ascending the stairs get closer.Leyla had climbed in through the hallway window after wandering outside for a long time, even though he had left the door remaining open for easier entry.She was a girl who never diverged from his expectations, but she always left him an impression.\u00a0Matthias lay still on the sofa, letting her feet move closer.Leyla\u2019s sigh of relief came after she heard the hardwood floor creak smoothly.Matthias scoffed silently and lowered his gaze from the ceiling.It didn\u2019t take long until Leyla entered the reception room. She eyed her surroundings stiffly, then she took a careful step forward and began to inspect places near the window.Matthias\u2019s eyes, already accustomed to the darkness, instantly captured her petite figure. The moonlight that flowed in through the window shone upon her, who stood in front of the table.By the time Matthias narrowed his eyes, Leyla had moved to her following location, the cabinet.The skirt wrapped around her slender calves shook along with her footsteps. The sheer white dress made of a see-through fabric exposed her torso line and made her seem like she was in her nightgown.\u2018What do I want from the bait I\u2019ve set up?\u2019Matthias caressed the glasses\u2019 delicate frame with his fingertips. His consciousness was rendered clear by its cold, smooth texture. Meanwhile, Leyla had shifted to the front of the console table, which was angled opposite his sofa.Matthias glanced over her moonlight-illuminated back.\u2018That woman\u2019.He now got the answers he was searching for.The reason for his unending patience in waiting when setting up this ridiculous trap.To be able to have that woman.That woman, Leyla Lewellin, who was no longer a little girl.\u201cAre you looking for this?\u201dMatthias broke the silence and shook the glasses in his hand slowly.Leyla immediately turned around when she was about to open the console table\u2019s drawer. She seemed to be on the brink of fainting.She stumbled backward, with her shaking hands covering her mouth.Matthias gradually lifted himself.\u00a0The moonlight glistened across his profile, which was hidden in the shadows all along, as he sat, leaning against the sofa.The two people\u2019s gazes collided in the moonlit night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14\u2727 Desirable Woman \u2727Matthias sighted Leyla, who was shaking all over in fear.Since she was a little girl, nothing had changed about her. Though she often pretended to put on a show of bravery, she was a lily-livered who was always easily frightened.Matthias kept walking towards her while his mind was running over the memories of the young girl he remembered.He stopped before her with a few paces left in between when he noticed Leyla\u2019s eyes locking on his outstretched hand. To the glasses clutched in his hand.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026.. sorry.\u201dLeyla opened her mouth just somewhat. She apologized politely enough though her eyes were overflowing with indignation.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be here. I am so sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t have it? Did you think it was okay to sneak in?\u201dMatthias cocked his head to confront her. Leyla\u2019s eyes grew redder with each blink, but she stood still and unwavering, whereas she seemed to be about to tear up.\u201cLike\u2026 a thief?\u201dHe sneered lowly, rendering Leyla\u2019s beetroot-red cheeks plainly visible even in the dark.\u201cI only tried to get what was rightfully mine.\u201d\u201cAh. This?\u201dLeyla\u2019s face flushed even more as Matthias lifted her glasses. Her ears were flaming red as well, as he looked at her face more closely.\u201cYes.\u201dShe fearlessly answered his question without flinching.\u201cMy glasses that you hid.\u201d\u2018Even though you\u2019re trembling that much.\u2019Matthias sauntered towards the window. It was the same window where he had thrown her hat over, but this time he had her glasses in his grip.\u201cD-Don\u2019t\u2026 !\u201dStupefied. Leyla\u2019s face started to get paler and she chased after him.\u201cGive it back! Please!\u201dThe lace shawl that had been draped over her shoulder fell to the floor. Leyla heaved her arms to cover her cleavage, which was revealed beneath her v-neck pajamas.\u201cIsn\u2019t it hilarious that you\u2019re making a fuss over your sleepwear when you\u2019ve already seen my whole body?\u201dLeyla\u2019s blush flushed down to the nape of her neck at his flout.\u201c\u2026That. That couldn\u2019t be helped!\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I wanted, but I had no choi-\u201c\u201cDid you think I wanted it?\u201d\u201cWhat? No\u2026.. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201dLeyla quickly grabbed the shawl and wrapped it around her shoulders and chest. At that sight, Matthias softly chuckled, finding her half-kayoed expression was somewhat comedic-gold.\u201cWhy are you now behaving like a lady? You said that you weren\u2019t a lady.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Regardless of who I am, you\u2019re still a nobleman.\u201dMatthias chuckled some more, looking at her arrogant yet respectful refusal to succumb to his words.\u201cWell.\u201d\u00a0Matthias dropped his tone a little lower as his laughter subsided,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know, Leyla. Maybe I\u2019m not a nobleman.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026No!\u201d Leyla exclaimed urgently as she tightly bound the end of her shawl. \u201cYou\u2019re a nobleman!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes! You\u2019re the greatest nobleman in the Berg Empire!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re quite generous in appraising me.\u201d\u201cEveryone who knows you would think that.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that different from your thoughts?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 No.\u201dYes!Although Leyla wanted, to be frank, she kept her innermost thoughts secret by vigorously shaking her head.\u201cI don\u2019t think that way\u2026\u201dOnly for tonight, Leyla decided to sell her soul for her glasses.\u201cSo, your grace, please give it back to me.\u201dShe was about to cry because she was too upset, but Leyla persuaded herself not to.\u201cIt\u2019s very important and precious to me.\u201dShe begged him again, bowing her head and suffering the humiliation.Leyla wanted to stomp on all the stones in the forest to vent her anger. But she was mindful of how much she was actually at a disadvantage in this situation.If the duke courted the matter further, he could\u2019ve turned her into a criminal or he could\u2019ve thrown her glasses out the window into the river.His simple acts, no matter which one, were both fatal to her.So, Leyla had to put up with it.Matthias marched up to her. He began throwing the glasses up, and the gap between them closed.\u00a0Soon, they were at a near enough distance, where they could sense each other\u2019s body temperature.Leyla batted her eyes in surprise when Matthias glanced down at her with his deep and placid eyes.His eyes resembled a bottomless river.A vast and icy river that had devoured her on that sunny afternoon when all her misfortune began.Leyla was deep in thoughts as her previously blurry vision became crystal-clear all of a sudden. Matthias had put her glasses on her face. His palms that were covering her cheeks were so smooth and warm, like sand that had been steamed by the sun.Just his face could be seen in contrast with the rest of his surroundings that were veiled in the darkness.Leyla was restless. She attempted to shun his eyes, but Matthias held her face by giving some strength into his caressing hands.Why\u2026..?She wanted to ask him that, before a peculiar and terrifying feeling suddenly surged through her when his long fingers started to fondle the tip of her lips.Calmly, Matthias\u2019 fingers come to rest between the crease of Leyla\u2019s lip. His thrilling sigh tickled her forehead.Leyla could feel his breath tasted hot and had a sweet scent, same as the touch of his fingers.Matthias locked his raven\u2019s blue eyes on her.Slowly but surely, he started to nuzzle the delicate skin of her wet bottom lip. In a sensual motion, he moved his finger in and out of her mouth until the tips of his trim nails were nearly touching her lower white teeth.Leyla seemed to have long forgotten how to flee. Innocently froze, enduring both his gaze and touch.Matthias tardily closed his eyes. His insane, illogical conduct almost brought Leyla to tears. The hands that had embraced her cheeks tenderly strengthened, but then, Matthias loosened his hold and let her go.Eventually, his hands freed her.Leyla lost her footing and staggered backward.\u00a0Her body trembled violently as she struggled to breathe.Matthias opened his crystalline-azure eyes; a pair of stunning eyes that had caused her shame and dread.He looked at Leyla for quite some time, then gave a silent order.\u201cGet out\u2026.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla had no recollection of what had happened after she left the annex.After saying her goodbyes, she turned around and walked out. All of her memories of that time seemed hazy.Only after she heard the grass bugs sing, felt the cold breeze blowing against her body, and saw her silhouette walking under the moonlight, Leyla did realize she had reached the end of the forest path.Still bewildered, Leyla made her way to the cottage.\u00a0She didn\u2019t lash out at the stones and tree branches, nor did she run away.She literally walked.With her slower-than-usual stride, as light as a ghost on a stroll.Leyla pumped the water from a spigot in the corner of her yard and washed her face. She unconsciously rubbed her lips until they were swollen and reddish. And though her skin had already peeled off, the water couldn\u2019t clean the unpleasant feeling that still lingered on her mouth.Leyla\u2019s face, shawl, and the front of her nightgown were all soaked with cold water when she returned to her room. Without thinking of drying them, she sat on her bed, perched up on edge.Leyla didn\u2019t know what she had been through, but she was sure of one thing.That she didn\u2019t want to see him ever again.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The canary that had been sitting peacefully in its cage flew towards Matthias when he clicked his fingertips.Matthias leaned back against the windowsill and extended his hands towards the bird.\u00a0The canary perched naturally on his finger.It\u2019s wings needed to be trimmed a bit as it had grown long enough to be able to fly a little distance. But Matthias didn\u2019t feel the need to cut it as short as he did before.As he listened to the canary singing, Matthias lowered his gaze and peered out the window.The gardener, Bill Remmer, was in the thick of his job of weeding the garden. But for several days, he didn\u2019t see Leyla Lewellin, which was strange, since she was usually there to help him out.She had been absent and nowhere to be seen after the night she went looking for her glasses.But, Matthias was conscious that Leyla began to avoid him like the plague.After returning the canary to its cage, Matthias clothed himself in a carmine red hunting jacket.He desired her.Matthias came to realize what this feeling was called.That woman, Leyla Lewellin. He craved her.There was no longer any need to deny that she had grown up to be a beautiful woman.\u00a0Beautiful enough to pique a man\u2019s interest.But Matthias knew, this form of desire was supposed to fade quickly.So, he wondered.Did she need to leave a stain on his life just to satisfy that desire?Matthias replayed the events of that night in his mind. About the woman in front of him, Leyla. And he concluded.No.Leyla Lewellin wasn\u2019t a woman worth his desire to be kept in his palm.Then why.That night, he let Leyla go.Still, if she were to behave in this way after he had set her free, then he would have no choice.\u201cI\u2019ve prepared for your hunting session, master.\u201dHessen approached politely. Matthias nodded, took the gun Hessen had given him, and exited the room.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cDid something happen?\u201dKyle asked, a little concernedly.Leyla, who was affixing the well-dried flower into her diary with glue, lifted her head and faced him calmly.\u201cNo.\u201d She said, with a lively voice as usual. \u201cDo I seem that way?\u201dLeyla dropped her voice and whispered, narrowing her eyes.Kyle was mystified to see her face was red as if something hot had been put on her neck and burnt her skin.\u201cYou\u2019ve been cooped up in the cottage for a few days now. That\u2019s strange.\u201dKyle shrugged.Leyla blinked in a daze a couple of times before showing her usual cheerful smile. Her lips curved into a faint grin and her eyes twinkled brightly.\u201cYou should go out more now that you\u2019ve found your glasses. But what you\u2019re doing right now is the polar opposite.\u201dKyle rested his chin on his hand while staring at Leyla. But she only laughed a little and began carefully writing down the locations and characteristics of the flower petals she had found in her diary.Leyla would usually sketch and paste unknown flower petals onto her notebook before going to the library to look up their names.Kyle often accompanied her simply to watch her expression when she discovered the names of the flowers.She was a young woman who was intrigued by the names of all the birds and flowers in the world and Kyle was a huge lover of her geekiness.Her face looked small in the gleam of the reading glasses she had recently gotten back. Leyla made sure that she didn\u2019t press the notebook hard with a blotter because she didn\u2019t want the ink to smudge.\u201cDo you want to take a walk? Let\u2019s go to that tree you like, the one right in front of the river.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201dLeyla replied immediately right after Kyle ended his sentence.\u201cDidn\u2019t you used to go there all the time?\u00a0 What happened? Did you see something scary in the woods again?\u201d\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t like that. I can\u2019t go into the forest today anyways.\u201d\u201cHow come? Ah, is it the duke\u2019s hunting day today?\u201dAfter moving the book to the far end of the table, Leyla nodded. Soon after, she could hear a distant thunderous sound of horses\u2019 footsteps coming from a distance.\u201cWow. That\u2019s cool.\u201dKyle dashed in front of the window, admiring Duke Herhardt and his group of men as they headed to enter the forest through a road beside the cottage.The five young men were riding their horses with the greyhounds at the lead.Kyle and Leyla both looked out the window. The duke was mounted on a lustrous horse today, with fur that was the color of a pitch-soaked wood barrel. His red jacket and shining shotgun also attracted her eyes.Kyle suddenly changed his expression after admiring the duke.\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, Leyla. I\u2019m not an animal hunter. I\u2019m not going to hunt for the remainder of my life.\u201dAt that moment, Duke Herhadt also turned his head towards the cottage. Leyla quickly jumped away from the window even though she was already hidden behind the curtains.She had spent the past ten days trying to evade him. She didn\u2019t go by the river, and she didn\u2019t even go for a walk in the woods.Leyla felt sorry for uncle Bill, who had recently gone out to handle the garden by himself. She only helped him while the duke was away from the estate and quickly left the garden when he returned.Leyla planned to endure this discomfort until the end of summer. By the time autumn would land, Matthias would have already been engaged and would be moving to the capital. Then Arvis would regain his previous state of tranquility.\u201cLayla, are you feeling under the weather? Do you want to come over to my place?\u201d Kyle asked while looking at Leyla\u2019s pallid countenance.\u201cNo, Kyle. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u00a0Leyla leaned back in her chair which faced the dinner table and shook her head. \u201cThe hunt will end tonight, anyways.\u201dBang!Another gunshots rang out the moment she thoughtlessly opened her journal.\u00a0The sound was then followed by the dogs barking and the horses bolting.Leyla flipped her book\u2019s pages, which she couldn\u2019t read properly with her fist clenched.She felt compelled to go to the woods this evening.Some unfortunate birds had to be buried.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15\u2727 Friendly Hunting \u2727The forest, which had been swept through by a bloody activity, had a calmer atmosphere than usual.Matthias stopped his horse in the middle of a wide road that ran between the woods after dispatching his group first.Tangled bangs draped down his forehead when he removed his hat. The hunt today was a lot of fun. Matthias was able to hit every target he set out for and each moment was as thrilling as ever. But one bird that had desperately attempted to fly away made him unsatisfied.Matthias slowly pulled the reins and spun the horse in the direction of the cottage. When the hunt was over, the little girl who lived by the hunting grounds would come out into the forest crying and bury all the dead birds. It was her ridiculous habit that he still remembered very clearly.So, what about that woman now, who\u2019s no longer a child?The curious Matthias pointed his rifle at a tiny bird sitting on the branch\u2019s rim, and\u2026Bang!With\u00a0his aimed shot hitting the target, the little bird fell to the ground.Matthias left behind the prey he had killed and slowly motioned his horse to advance.Once.And then once again.He was pointing and shooting.The birds fell one by one covered in blood, adorning the long path Matthias walked through into the deep evening forest.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u2018I hate him!\u2019Leyla dug a hole and said those words over and over as she buried the dead bird.\u2018I hate his heinous pastime. I really hate it.\u2019Leyla swallowed her sadness while wiping her sweaty forehead. She felt she was almost there until she spotted another bloody bird lying down only a few meters away.Leyla picked up her shovel again and stepped closer to that poor bird. She didn\u2019t want to blame the act of killing an animal. Uncle Bill hunted for food as well and she also bred livestock.\u00a0 But she\u00a0didn\u2019t understand why the duke killed just for entertainment and then abandoned his hunt behind.When is this summer going to end?As she buried another bird-a beautiful ruby-crowned kinglet with a pretty feather\u2019s pattern-Leyla sighed deeply, hoping that her favorite season would soon come to an end.Leyla had already entered deep into the evening forest when she suddenly sensed something strange.Duke Herhardt loved hunting. And every time, Leyla buried the birds he had killed. But she\u00a0had no memory of making the tomb of birds in a row the way she did now, as if she was setting down a path made up of bird carcasses.Should I go back now?Leyla\u2019s face winced as she sensed something ominous. The sheltering sky above her head was painted in a crimson color. She turned her eyes away from the setting sun and gazed down behind a clump of shrubs.And, she saw him.Duke Herhardt was sitting on the trump of the chopped oak. He was silently watching her.Leyla\u2019s mind turned blank, and she almost stumbled.With a laid-back attitude, he greeted her.\u201cHello, Leyla.\u201dMatthias\u2019s voice sounded luscious.As velvety as the birds\u2019 feathers he had shot and killed.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cBy the way, Matthias is quite late. I think those who went with him are already back. \u201cElysee von Herhardt squinted her eyes while putting her card on the table. She was getting bored with the card game she was playing. She wanted to start dinner early, but her son, Matthias, hadn\u2019t returned from the hunting grounds yet.\u201cHe had said he\u2019d go for a walk in the forest before.\u201dClaudine, who didn\u2019t have the look of someone who had just lost a game, answered her with a friendly smile.The ladies, very much aware that she\u2019d lost the card game on purpose, looked at Claudine with admiring smiles, seeing the next Duchess of Arvis was a well-educated lady with classy manners. Claudine also knew very well that she was well-liked and highly praised among those aristocratic ladies.\u201cMatthias surely has a thing for that forest.\u201dElysee lightly rang the bell the maids rushed over and started setting the table.The idle ladies clustered around the reception table to chat and enjoy simple snacks. They talked about various stories, of course, with all its formalities that entailed.\u201cOh, Claudine. Why don\u2019t you invite your friends over and throw a party?\u201d\u201cMe? In the Arvis manor?\u201dClaudine\u2019s eyes widened as she heard Elysee\u2019s suggestion.\u201cYou will get bored if you deal with us every day. Don\u2019t you need to change your pattern a little?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m not bored. Really.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so startled? I was just kidding, Claudine.\u201dIt was tough to fathom that Elysee was the mother of an engaged son because her relaxed, smiling face was so youthful yet beautiful. Matthias, her only son, was endowed with her loveliness.The people of the empire admired Duchess Elysee von Herhardt for her timeless beauty. Yet, she was still unable to capture her husband\u2019s affection.Claudine believed that women obsessed with love were ridiculous as she learned of Elysee\u2019s tragic love life.Matthias\u2019s father, like every other man in his position, had a mistress. However, he didn\u2019t make life difficult for his successor by taking in an illegitimate child.Even though they didn\u2019t love each other, the Duke and Duchess of Arvis respected each other and carried out their responsibilities faithfully. They acted their part in the household perfectly. They remained calm and untainted by selfish greed or desire.So Claudine aspired to live a similar life like them with Matthias.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Claudine; you\u2019re never under any pressure. Consider it as a rehearsal. If the mansion is filled with young people, we\u2019ll have much more fun.\u201dElysee\u2019s smile had brightened vastly. \u201cDon\u2019t you think the same as well, ladies?\u201dBut, all in the room were aware that her question was not intended for soliciting their feedback.\u201cThe duchess is very generous and thoughtful.\u201dCountess Brandt complimented the soon-to-be-mother-in-law of her daughter. Other ladies soon joined in, making praising noises with some exaggeration sprinkled on top.Claudine sheepishly smiled as she bowed her head softly. She was thinking about the names of people she had liked to invite until now when her eyes drew her attention to the window.The moment she saw the forest beyond the dusk garden, she instantly thought of that girl: Leyla Lewellin. The poor orphan girl who lived in that forest.She was well-mannered and knew where she belonged even though she was a little arrogant at times.\u201cDo you mind if I invite Leyla?\u201dThe brow of every lady in the room was raised upon hearing Claudine\u2019s cheerful question.\u201cDo you mean the gardener\u2019s orphan girl?\u201d\u201cYes. That girl, Leyla Lewellin.\u201d\u201cClaudine, wait.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure that poor girl had never been to a formal party before.\u201d Claudine seemed unaffected by Countess Brandt\u2019s embarrassment-filled glare. \u201cI want Leyla to have an experience she will never forget.\u201dShe said those intimidating words without losing her ladylike courtesy and dignity.\u201cCome to think of it, what\u2019ve you said makes sense.\u201dDuchess Norma Catarina von Herhardt, who had been watching Claudine the whole time, smiled contentedly.\u201cThen, do as you please, Claudine.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Looking back to the path of buried birds Leyla shifted her eyes. There was only one answer she could come to as she turned her head and watched the duke.-A psycho.There were no other words to describe him.The sweat was spilling from her muddy gloves. Her heart began to pound with anger and fear.\u2018Let\u2019s get out of here.\u2019Leyla was about to run to the cottage the moment she heard his voice.\u201cLeyla.\u201dMatthias\u2019 face remained impassive as he pronounced her name slowly.\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dAfter he called her name like a song\u2019s lyrics,\u00a0Leyla straightened her back by using the shovel in her hand as a cane. She squeezed her lips closed and tight, flexing both of her legs\u2019 muscles.She realized, it was useless to run. The duke could quickly catch her if he set his mind to it.The sound of woodland leaves swaying in the wind surfaced, but there was nothing but silence for them. Leyla raised her twitching eyes and glared at him.\u201cKeep going.\u201dMatthias was the first person who breached the silence.\u201cYou should get on with your job.\u201dOn the side of the bushes that he pointed to with his eyes, a bird that seemed to be the game of his last chase, lay dead.Leyla trudged up to the bird and saw red thread tied to the bird\u2019s bleeding ankle.\u00a0 It was the same thread she had tied to the baby birds who had hatched near the Schulter River last year.Without saying a word, Leyla buried the bird in a pit she dug herself. Because of that beautiful bird\u2019s slayer, she had become used to doing all of this.\u201cThat thread. Did you tie it?\u201dMatthias asked as he sat there watching.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy.\u201d\u201cThe birds that leave their nests to migrate \u2026 I wanted to know when they will come back.\u201d Answered Leyla while patting the soil. \u201cThis is not the kind of reunion I was hoping for.\u201dShe watched Matthias\u2019s apathetic face and experienced lightheadedness.\u201cSo, do you want to blame me?\u201d\u00a0Matthias crossed his leg. A mocking smile bloom on his lips.Leyla\u2019s patience had officially expired.\u201cI can\u2019t help myself not to say no.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly is the problem?\u201d Matthias scowled. \u201cI only hunted my birds, in my territory, on my hunting grounds.\u201d\u201cBut the birds don\u2019t know.\u201dLeyla dared to retort, repeating \u2013for uncle Bill\u2013 words in her head.\u201cFor the birds, it\u2019s just a forest. A place where they were born and raised. It\u2019s also a home to which they\u2019d want to return after their migration.\u201d\u201cIs it necessary for me to understand them?\u201d\u201cNot really, but\u2026..\u201d Leyla removed her bloodstained gardening gloves and took a deep breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so ruthless in hunting them.\u201dShe\u2019d have to summon a heck of a lot of courage to utter those sentences. A very delayed feeling of regret washed over her after that, but the duke showed no signs of displeasure or anger.\u00a0\u00a0Leyla felt even more suffocated because of his odd stillness.\u201cLeyla Lewellin, the bird-loving girl.\u201dMatthias spoke up after a long moment of silence.\u201cWhat in the world do you think hunting is?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cDo you want me to go for a friendly hunt?\u201dHis scorn surely clawed at her heart. Leyla could only endure his insult by clutching her skirt.\u201c\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for my mistake. I\u2019ve said something rude. Please forgive my impoliteness.\u201d\u201cWhat makes you so fond of birds?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be a compelling story for you.\u201d Leyla lowered her head, signaling that she didn\u2019t want to see him any longer.Matthias was deafeningly silent.\u201cNow that I\u2019ve finished my work, I\u2019m leaving.\u201dLeyla bowed profoundly and turned her body while Matthias still stayed muffled.Bang!Right as she was about to take a step forward, a rabid shot unexpectedly rang out, reverberating throughout the wilderness sky.Leyla quickly circled back with a horrid face.Click\u2026Matthias eyed her with a rifle in his hand after fired his gun towards the tree branch.A bloodied bird then fell on the ground between them.\u201cWhat will you do, Leyla?\u201dHe then sat back on the tree trunk as if nothing had happened.\u201cI don\u2019t think your job is over yet.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16\u2727 Something That Is Nothing \u2727Arvis\u2019s forest was soon becoming dark after its sun began to sink.Matthias was staring at Leyla, who looked at the dead bird with blurry eyes. There was a period of silence between them. He was still patiently waiting, because he believed Leyla wouldn\u2019t be able to run away for a while.\u201cJust\u2026\u2026\u201dLeyla lifted her head. Her pupils were brimming with anger that even the dark couldn\u2019t mask. Her eyes were arrogant and brazen but Matthias thought that was far better than her avoiding his gaze.\u201cJust tell me. What did I do wrong?\u201d\u201cWrong?\u201d\u201cYes. What wrongdoing have I committed against you\u2026.. why should I be punished like this?\u201d\u201cI never punished you,\u201d Matthias laughed. \u201cI did my job, and you, Leyla, did yours.\u201dAfter a brief moment of wondering, Matthias looked at Leyla again with a subdued glance.\u201cWrongdoing\u2026Huh?\u2026.Why do you like birds so much?\u201dHe repeated the same question.Leyla looked up to the sky, towards the dead bird, and then back to Matthias. Her shoulders trembled, but her eyes staring at him remained wide open.It irritated Matthias but at the same time amusing as well.\u201cThey\u2019re always by my side,\u201dLeyla answered aloud to his question. There was a wave of slight anger in her voice, but it didn\u2019t sound rude or offensive.\u201cEver since I was a child, I\u2019ve been traveling around a lot of different places, but the birds were always there wherever I went. They were always in my vicinity. As the seasons changed, some of the birds who had gone away would still return as I waited for them. The birds always came back to me.\u201dLeyla\u2019s voice became softer as she spoke. Perhaps, the tenderness had been caused by her smooth articulation.\u201cThe birds are there in every season. I can find them in every place. I love living around these lovely and free creatures.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. But it might be meaningless to you, duke.\u201dPfftt\u2026.Matthias giggled low, looking at Leyla, who blustered with a teary-eyed expression and rose to his feet. It seemed the time of the dinner party had approached before he realized it.\u201cAre you going to hunt like this again?\u201d Leyla stopped him when he was preparing to leave.\u201cIf it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Matthias answered without skipping a second.He was pleased. Leyla\u2019s eyes, which were filled with despair, fear, and frustration after that, really satisfied him.After briefly altering his mind, Matthias stood in front of her.\u201cLeyla, everything in my life has to be in its place. Where there\u2019s no need for someone to run or hide.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cSimply stay in your place.\u201d\u201cPlace\u2026? I\u2026. I don\u2019t understand what you mean by that.\u201d\u201cThink it through thoroughly.\u201d\u201cDuke.\u201d\u201cWho knows? I might consider a \u2018friendly\u2019 hunting session if you find the answer.\u201dMatthias walked away leaving behind a dazed Leyla.He didn\u2019t want to hold high hopes towards her. But, he wanted Leyla Lewellin to stay in her place.As an orphan living in the forest.As a studious schoolgirl.And soon, as a female teacher in the place where she should be.Sitting on the back of his horse, Matthias turned his head and looked towards the bush. There, Leyla was still curled up before the dead bird. Matthias believed she was crying as he noticed a sparkle on her cheeks.There was a sense of contentment blooming in his eyes when Matthias saw her tears.He was born into a world where perfect order reigned supreme and now he was on his way to being its master.Underneath that principle, everything in his world stayed simple and clear. Living up to a specific role or meeting a set of expectations wasn\u2019t at all problematic.He was his grandmother\u2019s and mother\u2019s proud successor.\u00a0The gracious master of Arvis\u2019s people. The brilliant commander on the battlefield. Not to mention even the director of a successful business.He was always somebody\u2019s \u201csomething,\u201d and Matthias willingly played that role.The people around him also viewed him in the same light. He polished their designated roles, actions, and feelings in a structured manner. Those were the emotions that he always saw, heard, and learned.But that poor orphan who lives in my forest?Matthias\u2019s eyes narrowed as he looked at Leyla.She\u2019s nothing.Matthias smiled when he realized how easy the conclusion had been.It was the first time something that was \u201cnothing\u201d had invaded his world.Duke of Herhardt didn\u2019t need any extra stains in his life. Nevertheless, it was queer to have something that he didn\u2019t need in his life.And yet, Matthias thought it wasn\u2019t too bad. That woman whose value was equivalent to \u2018nothing\u2019, her sentiments displayed before him amused him a little, much as seeing a flying bird plummet to its death.Especially her tears.He enjoyed seeing Leyla cry. She was such a lovely weeper. Attractive enough to him to make her cry over and over again.Matthias made his way out of the forest with a content heart.In the mansion where he returned, he went through the same routine\u2014a dinner with a raucous crowd\u2014the ornate but empty conversations adorned with the ice-cold champagne and artificial laughter.After the brief summer night had passed and the morning came again, Matthias thought that doing \u2018friendly\u2019 hunting wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea next time.When he looked out the window, Leyla was there. She worked in the rose garden, quietly helping the gardener with his job.See?Matthias chuckled as he turned away from the window.It\u2019s that easy, Leyla.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThank you, Leyla.\u201dClaudine graciously conveyed her thanks. Her sitting-friend also thanked Leyla with a slight smile.\u201cNo problem, Miss.\u201dLeyla bent respectfully and clasped her white palms together. The grass had stained her fingers as she plucked the flowers. Furthermore, the rose thorns had pierced her fingers, leaving several bloodstained bruises too.\u201cNow I will\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you cut off that red rose as well? A bouquet is enough.\u201dClaudine cut her off mid-sentence. She gestured to Leyla to turn around and looked at the garden\u2019s flower field, brimming with vibrantly colored red roses in full bloom.\u201cYes, Miss.\u201dLeyla retook her basket and scissors, obediently carried out her orders as always.Claudine silently watched her distant back. She found Leyla while strolling through the garden with a friend who had paid a visit to the Arvis manor. That orphan girl was working hard today to help the gardener after being gone for several days.Claudine then canceled their tea date and suggested to her friend, Emily, to arrange the flowers instead.Emily enthusiastically agreed and under the vine rose-covered pergola the maids prepared the flower arrangements for the two ladies.After that, Claudine dispatched a maid to call Leyla. They had been like this since they were children. Whenever Claudine made a flower arrangement under the pergola, Leyla Lewellin\u2019s job was to get the roses she needed.Leyla wasn\u2019t good enough to be Claudine\u2019s playmate, but she was very good at doing errands.Claudine would sometimes call her on days when she was bored, only to say a few words.\u201cThat girl behaves very politely, but she has an arrogant air,\u201d Emily said, pouting her lips while watching Leyla. \u201cHow should I put it \u2026. She doesn\u2019t seem to know where she belongs.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Emily. Leyla is a pitiful child.\u201d Claudine frowned slightly and cut off the rose branches with the scissors Leyla had given her. \u201cFor sure, she has shortcomings, but let\u2019s still be tolerant of her.\u201dClaudine\u2019s words made Emily laugh, \u201cWell. Aren\u2019t you overly kind to your attendant?\u201d\u201cAn attendee who diligently performs their roles should be respected.\u201dClaudine\u2019s voice became lower and softer. She placed the flowers one by one in the blue porcelain vase after trimming them.Leyla returned shortly after with a bouquet of red roses. She bowed politely to them once again and put the roses on the table.Claudine stopped her hands and looked at her. Emily\u2019s criticism of Leyla seemed accurate. She had interacted with the child for a long time now and somehow she agreed with Emily\u2019s words.Claudine honestly didn\u2019t get why Emily could give such a critique about Leyla.Leyla Lewellin\u2019s docile manner seemed to be derived from her indifferent attitude. Many famous noble daughters wished to be friends with Claudine, whereas\u00a0 Leyla lacked enthusiasm and wasn\u2019t happy whenever Claudine was around her.\u00a0She never bothered to make herself presentable in front of Claudine and she never flattered her either.In a nutshell, Leyla was the type of person who endured and obediently followed orders.Claudine wasn\u2019t used to being overlooked by anyone. She felt belittled that an orphan had treated her with such indifference.\u201cGood job, Leyla.\u201dClaudine smiled kindly. Leyla took a step back as she bent, and the maid approached her from a short distance away.Claudine had been looking forward to this moment the most. The moment when Leyla\u2019s true feelings were seen through her eyes, in the same way, she did when she was awarded a gold coin.Even after all these years, Leyla couldn\u2019t keep her cool when given the gold coin. Claudine was pleased when Leyla\u2019s hand, which held the gold coin, trembled like grasping a hot potato.To top it off, Claudine was planning to give her another present. A party invitation, which would give a wonderful experience for that poor girl.\u201cAre you giving this to me?\u201d Leyla looked flustered; her eyes grew wider when she received an invitation from the same maid who had given her the gold coin.\u201cYes. I had asked the two duchesses for permission and they allowed it.\u201d\u201cBut, Miss\u2026..\u201d\u201cI really want you to come, Leyla.\u201dClaudine smiled as he interrupted Leyla\u2019s words a second time. But her bright smile made Leyla\u2019s complexion look even paler.\u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t turn down my invitation.\u201dAfter talking with Leyla as if she were a long-time childhood friend, Claudine took her eyes away from her.\u2018I have to tame that obstinate child before I become Duchess of Arvis.\u2019Claudine made up her mind as she trimmed the bunch of red roses on the table and skillfully decorated the floral vase with exquisite beauty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Word of the party circulated quickly to the rest of the residents.Everyone initially was mystified before turning to sympathize with her upon finding out the whole story.Every soul in that place could see how badly Lady Brandt treated the pitiful Leyla like she was her dog.\u201cI fail to see why all the aristocrats are so nasty.\u201dBill Remmer had been resting in the shade from the midday heat when madam Mona, the chef, visited him in the afternoon. The surprising news rooted him to the spot.\u201cThe aristocrats claim to be considerate, but how intimidated would Leyla be in such a place?\u201d\u201cLeyla isn\u2019t the type of child who is easily intimidated by things like that. She would only briefly show her face and come back.\u201d\u201cUgh. Men don\u2019t know anything!\u201dBill just scratched his neck when she grumbled. He took out his cigarette and flicked the ashes.\u201cLet\u2019s show them what they deserve!\u201d\u201cHuh, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand what I mean? With Leyla\u2019s pretty looks, let\u2019s take the wind out of those aristocrat\u2019s sails.\u201d\u201cNo, why are you so\u2026\u2026.?\u201d\u201cI knew it! Do you want to send Leyla to the party in her uniform?\u201d\u2018What\u2019s wrong with school uniforms?\u2019Bill looked at a loss and Madam Mona sighed, \u201cLook here, Bill Remmer. After all these years, don\u2019t you think you should know how to raise a daughter?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean a daughter? I\u2019m still thinking about where to send her\u2026.\u201d\u201cSure. You have to think about that. You\u2019ll think when you send Leyla on her wedding day, think when you\u2019ll hold her children, and think even when you\u2019re in your coffin.\u201d\u201cNo! How could I send that little girl off to marry? You\u2019re talking gibberish.\u201dSeeing Bill heat up with anger, Madam Mona\u2019s lips softened, \u201cAnd you still say she\u2019s not your daughter. You\u2019re a man I really don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cJust leave if you\u2019re going to keep talking nonsense.\u201d\u201cCome on, let\u2019s buy her a new dress, Mr. Remmer. She\u2019s a girl. How happy will she be when she gets a surprise gift?\u201d Madam Mona suggested him with a commanding tone. \u201cLeyla isn\u2019t the type of child who would ask for a dress, and you\u2019re not the type of person who would care, so I have no choice but to meddle. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 How?\u201d\u201cYou pay for the dress and I\u2019m going to get it ready for her.\u201d\u201cDo it, then.\u201dBill went inside the house with a grouse and brought his bag out. He used to save his money in the cottage due to his skepticism of the bank.Leyla had previously gone to the goat pen. She returned to the cottage when Madam Mona was collecting money from Bill to purchase dresses and shoes. The two hurriedly concealed the proof of their deal and put on an innocent act.Madam Mona refused Leyla\u2019s offer of a cup of tea. After she exited the cottage, Bill silently tucked his purse into his back pocket.\u201cDid madam Mona nag you talking about me again? I haven\u2019t been climbing trees lately.\u201d Leyla anxiously asked after sitting on a chair next to Bill.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that; no need to worry about it.\u201d Bill cleared his throat and ignited the cigarette he had extinguished a moment ago.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d Leyla smiled and leaned into her chair after taking off her hat.Every day, Bill was delighted to see Leyla sporting the straw hat he had given her this summer. He no longer regretted giving madam Mona his money as he thought it would be multiple times more fulfilling to see Leyla dressed up in an elegant dress.\u201cLeyla.\u201dLeyla turned after Bill abruptly called her.\u201cWhat are you planning to do? I mean, about the duke\u2019s party.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just stopping by to say hello. Since the Etmans have also been invited, I will go with Kyle.\u201d\u201cReally? That herbivorous glutton is finally paying off for all the food he has eaten at my house.\u201dBill felt a rush of relief wash over him when he heard Kyle\u2019s name. That boy was someone he fully trusted.\u201cBut, don\u2019t you need anything? A dress to wear, things like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, uncle.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re fine. Are you planning to wear your school uniform?\u201d\u201cWell, that isn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201dLeyla giggled with delight. Seeing her look so carefree, Bill was absent-minded.Is it true that I\u2019m clueless about raising a daughter?\u201cNo.\u201dMy daughter? What nonsense.Bill muttered in a dazed dismay and quickly retracted the idea. He felt awkward\u00a0 when he met Leyla\u2019s puzzled gaze which was framed with sparkling glasses.Bill tasted her efforts to avoid causing him any trouble and avoid being indebted to him if possible. He fully understood. He simply hid it beneath his bluntness, unable to find the right words to comfort her.Bill admitted that. Despite her extreme means, madam Mona had made a great decision to surprise Leyla with a dress and shoes.\u201cLeyla.\u201dBill called her once again and mustered his guts.\u201c\u2026.. There\u2019s a scorcher outside.\u201dAgain, he failed to express the words he wished.Leyla chuckled at Bill, who cleared his throat after saying useless things and gently grasped his hand on the chair\u2019s armrest.\u2018I\u2019m the one who should comfort you instead.\u2019Bill\u2019s expression got sour, but he couldn\u2019t shake off her little hand. Leyla smiled at him; she was a girl with a charming smile.Evening had fallen when Leyla rose from her seat. The chamber was bathed in inky darkness.She lay motionless on her bed, taking in everything around.A Familiar ceiling. Creamy curtains that hung over the window. An old desk with a few books on it. A soft duvet cover with a light scent of sunshine.\u2018I\u2019m in my room.\u2019Leyla let out a relieved sigh when she realized where she was.The nightmares persisted to torment her. She had a flashback to the time she was abandoned in this world. She was without a family, and forced to travel around her relatives\u2019 houses.Every day, Leyla had been having the same dreams. Until she met Uncle Bill. Even so, her recollection of the place that had instilled in her the fear of water stayed vivid in her mind.\u2018It\u2019s all because of you!\u2019Her uncle always wrecked his anger on her whenever he was drunk.He was a shy and quiet guy when he was sober, but the uncle Leyla remembered was a man who was drunk five days a week. He got more aggressive when he lost money at the casino and never failed to swear and slap her.Leyla resented him.He was someone she detested. All she could do was endure it, as an orphan with nowhere else to go.Given that, Leyla made every effort she could. She never took a rest from helping with the housework and only ate a little. She rarely moved around, just like an object placed in the corner of the house.On the day she was officially kicked out of the house, her aunt was kind enough to give her a paper bag with cookies. Leyla took the paper bag from her aunt and said her last goodbyes.Leyla took out the cookie before going to the place of the next relative\u00a0 and ate it in the carriage. The chocolate\u2019s deliciousness was tearing her heart but she refused to cry.On the ride to her destination, Leyla practiced smiling. No one in this world liked crying orphans. So, the more she wanted to weep, the more she tried to make her smile bright. Her dainty lips bloomed even wider after being booted out repeatedly.When she had to cross the border into Berg, though, she hardly smiled. Leyla did believe that the single address she had in her hand was her last hope; she would be forced to go to an orphanage if she was abandoned again.Leyla couldn\u2019t forget. The day she had the best smile she\u2019d ever had, was the day she met Uncle Bill\u2019s warm, compassionate eyes.It was an unforgettable day when she truly had a family and a home to which she longed to return to.\u2018Everything is going to be well.\u2019Leyla comforted herself and awoke from her slumber. She seemed unconcerned and didn\u2019t want to dwell on the duke\u2019s party, which was to be hosted this evening. She planned to attend the party with confidence and then quietly leave.Claudine Brandt surely didn\u2019t know how much Uncle Bill and this warm cottage meant to her. And how Leyla was willing to do anything to protect them.Leyla flung open the window and let the fresh air in. She washed her face and quickly changed her dress. After she slammed the door shut, she was greeted by Uncle Bill, who was getting ready to go gardening.\u201cUncle, Let\u2019s go together!\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The manor was poised to welcome guests as the afternoon arrived. The large-scale party was an everyday thing for Arvisans.They carried out their responsibilities for their respective roles. All that remained was for the sunset to herald the commencement of this glitzy celebration.Nobody in Arvis\u2019 manor expressed worry about the party\u2019s success today. Tonight\u2019s party, like anything else that lay in the Herhardt name, would be perfect as always.Matthias dressed up and exited the fitting room in his evening suit. He exuded a chillier impression whenever he had his hair slicked back, exposing his forehead and brows. His piercing gaze and razor-sharp facial features couldn\u2019t be melted by the faint smile on the tip of his lips.\u201cIt went well and as you had ordered, master,\u201d Hessen reported.Matthias lifted his brow slightly and turned with a cigarette in his hand.\u201cThey left about an hour ago, so the items must have been delivered by now.\u201d\u201cFine, then.\u201dMatthias nodded, kindling his cigar which he snuffed between his lips.\u201cGood job.\u201dHessen bowed his head gladly in response to his master\u2019s compliment.Matthias found that Claudine had invited Leyla Lewellin to the party through his mother. His mother impressed and lauded Claudine for her kindness and charity towards the deprived orphan.Matthias made no objections, believing that : The view of Claudine showing her fullest sympathy and compassion when Leyla arrived at the party in her shabby outfit would be a cringe-worthy sight to see.Matthias seemed to know which part of Leyla Lewellin did pique Claudine\u2019s attention.The girl named Leyla was an annoying little child. Trampling on her pride was kind of an enjoyment.That\u2019s why Matthias was determined about not handing her off to Claudine. He had no intention of sharing his things with anyone.Only he could have all that fun and pleasure. Only he could bully her.Her only owner was Matthias von Herhardt.\u201cWhat shall I do with this, master?\u201dHessen mentioned the box by the fireplace. It was Madam Mona\u2019s prepared present package. The gift was supposed to be delivered to Bill Remmer\u2019s cottage today, but Hessen took it and brought it here instead. The butler had replaced the chef\u2019s box with another one he had acquired on Matthias\u2019 request.Matthias smoked his cigar as he stared at the gift box. Without opening it, it\u2019s easy for him to figure out what was inside.\u201cThrow it away.\u201dHis calm directives floated by, along with the soaring tobacco smoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18\u2727 Emerald \u2727\u201cUncle, this looks expensive,\u201dLeyla was shocked as she looked into the box with bulging eyes. Bill, too, was amazed at the present and couldn\u2019t come up with a good excuse.Leyla sneered at Bill,\u00a0 \u201cUncle, did you spend a lot of money?\u201d\u201cNo. Not really \u2026. it was not as costly as you think! You\u2019re too worried about everything.\u201dBill stuttered a bit. On the day of the party, the dress Madam Mona had prepared arrived at their cottage.He had believed the courier would send the dress. But who would have thought the dress was delivered by a young guy who claimed to be a store employee. So Bill assumed that maybe Madam Mona had bought a very special dress for Leyla until the clerk handed it off to them directly.The dress was far beyond his expectations after Leyla unboxed it.Even for Bill, who knew little about women\u2019s fashion and accessories, his eyes could tell that the white dress stitched with golden threads appeared luxurious and heavenly. Likewise with the shoes, gloves, and the necklace.\u2018Wait, how much money did I give Madam Mona before?\u2019Bill started counting with his fingers.\u2018But did she also buy the necklace with the money I gave her?\u2019He was perplexed and recalculated once more, but Leyla quickly put the lid back.\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cHow can I not like it?\u201d\u201cThen why?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s return it. I don\u2019t want you to waste this much money just for a one-night event.\u201dLeyla seemed to be worried. Her reaction was contrary to Madam Mona\u2019s guesses that the gift would make her thrilled.\u201cLeyla, if you don\u2019t wear this to the party. I don\u2019t want to see you again.\u201dBill\u2019s expression becomes upset all of a sudden.\u201cYou never want to be indebted to me. I understand your reasoning, but I don\u2019t like it if you draw a straight line between me and you, Leyla.\u201d\u201cUncle\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll throw it into the fireplace if you don\u2019t take it. And I won\u2019t see you again.\u201dThe angry-looking Bill stepped to the front door and fled outside the cottage.He strolled through the flower garden with his cigarette, yet his mind was loaded with late regrets for saying such hurtful things to the child. He didn\u2019t mean it when he said he\u2019d never see her again.Bill was pondering whether or not to return when Kyle suddenly appeared in his tailcoat from the other side of the road.\u201cMr. Remmer. Is Leyla ready?\u201d asked Kyle with a sunny visage.Bill mulled for a moment at his arrival. Kyle Etman, who he had thought was just a child who was always pretending to be an adult, now looked like a grown-ass man in his formal suit.\u201cWell. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhat? Leyla isn\u2019t home? The party is about to start.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s home, but\u2026\u2026\u201dBill sighed. He didn\u2019t know how to explain it. But suddenly, the front door creaked open and Leyla came out.The two-waiting men outside turned their heads and were nonplussed at the breathtaking view before their eyes.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cKyle, do I look weird?\u201d Leyla asked with her smirky little meerkat face. \u201cI feel so awkward wearing this dress\u2026..\u201d\u201cNo, you look pretty.\u201dKyle, who was tight-lipped for a fleeting moment, cut her words. Once again, he complimented her expressly.\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, Leyla. I mean it.\u201dKyle\u2019s blushing face melted his adolescent smile.\u00a0He knew that Uncle Bill was preparing a gift for Leyla, but he hadn\u2019t expected it would be as posh as this.He was initially apprehensive about entrusting Bill\u2019s eyes, which were prone to picking tacky stuff.But for this one\u2026\u2026\u201cHey, Kyle Etman! Wake up!\u201dBill chided him and patted his flustered back.\u201cYou\u2019re going in my place to escort her today.\u201d He eyed Kyle sternly. \u201cThat means you have to take responsibility to protect her. You can do it, right?\u201d\u201cOf course, Mr. Remmer,\u201d Kyle answered with much confidence. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to protect her!\u201dBill couldn\u2019t hold back his guffaw once Kyle vowed with a beet-red face.Kyle took some deep breaths to calm his throbbing heart when Leyla gingerly sauntered towards him. He reached out his hand in a polite gesture.\u201cHey\u2026what are you doing?\u201dLeyla questioned the meaning of his outstretched hand. But Kyle seemed unfazed by her wonderment.\u201cWe\u2019re partners at today\u2019s party.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSo.\u201dKyle mustered up his courage to take Leyla\u2019s hand and place it over his arm.\u201cWe should walk like this since I\u2019m your party\u2019s partner.\u201dHis voice trembled and he stammered a little because of nervousness.Leyla hesitated for a moment, lost in thought, before nodding and linking her arms around his. She smiled.\u201cFine, let\u2019s go, Kyle.\u201dGazing at her gaily smile that was brighter than the sun, Kyle murmured to himself.\u2018This is a moment I won\u2019t forget for the rest of my life.\u2019*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*In a nutshell, Leyla Lewellin showed up at the party hand in hand with the doctor\u2019s son.Matthias had been busy welcoming the guests when he turned his back to see Leyla entering the hall, escorted by Kyle Etman.Leyla\u2019s appearance was Hessen\u2019s proving ground that he was Arvis\u2019s most capable butler. His choice of dress for Leyla Lewellin was gorgeous. But Matthias believed Leyla would still be attractive even if she wore the shabby dress bought by the chef.Matthias locked his eyes on her, keeping a watchful glance on her things.From her shoes.Her dress.Then, to the viridescent necklace that embellished her white, svelte neck.The green necklace, which was pieced together by pearls and emeralds, was absolutely stunning.The dress and shoes had been prepared by Hessen, but it was Matthias who chose the necklace.It was just by chance. He was on his way to the hotel for an appointment when he happened to see that necklace.The finely crafted emerald\u2019s luminous green color gleaming in a display window by the hotel was captivating. Hence, Matthias instructed Hessen to buy the necklace on their way back to the estate that day.Leyla abruptly turned her head and she realized someone had cast their eyes on her. Her green eyes, which resembled a lush summer woodland, came to a halt right in front of Matthias\u2019s face.Leyla slightly narrowed her gaze. But, her face shied away in surprise after she recognized who the person was.She clutched Kyle\u2019s arm and hid behind his back, drawing her gaze away from Matthias, who only looked at her immovably.\u201cLong time no see, Duke Herhardt.\u201dMatthias only quit staring at her after someone greeted him.He warmly welcomed the familiar guest with a modest smile and exchanged brief pleasantries. Matthias was capable of completing his job flawlessly although his mind now was in a different place.When Matthias shifted his gaze back to her, Leyla had already been walking away with Kyle to the other side of the hall.Kyle Etman seemed to be proudly puffing out his chest when he was escorting Leyla. He acted as if she were his and led her around.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThis is Leyla. She\u2019s my friend.\u201dClaudine took Leyla and introduced her to another group of ladies.\u201cHello. I\u2019m Leyla Lewellin.\u201dLeyla played her part well with a polite greeting behaving like a doll with no will or feeling as she always did.Claudine grinned satisfiedly looking at her. She was pleased with Leyla\u2019s obedient and kind conduct then continued presenting her to other people.\u201cLeyla\u2019s pursuing a teaching career. Isn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201dThe ladies soon replicated Claudine\u2019s ecstatic praising manner, and they began complimenting Leyla in droves. But underneath all the praises, it was undoubtedly a tribute to Lady Claudine who regarded the poor orphan as her friend.Those aristocratic ladies were fully aware that the two could never be real friends. Still, those empty compliments wouldn\u2019t smudge Claudine\u2019s reputation.\u201cOh, Claudine. I heard you\u2019re getting engaged.\u201dOne of the ladies smoothly dropped the topic, as if their talk about an orphan who aspired to become a teacher was over. The topic of Claudine Brandt\u2019s engagement now had sparked everyone\u2019s interest.Claudine adopted a shy and humble demeanor right away. It wasn\u2019t very sensible to behave as if she had become Duchess Herhardt when they hadn\u2019t officially announced their engagement yet.\u201cOh, look! Duke Herhardt is coming here!\u201dA burst of admiration from one of the ladies on the other side of the hall drew everyone\u2019s focus to one place.Leyla, who kept wearing an apathetic expression the whole time, also widened her eyes in tandem with them.Matthias passed by her, and as might be expected, he stood neatly beside his future bride-to-be.Claudine then wrapped her arms around Matthias\u2019.\u00a0But it wasn\u2019t the same with Leyla. Her face was noticeably paler than before as she saw them being together.\u201cDuke Herhardt, they\u2019re my friends.\u201dMatthias greeted them with grace as Claudine began introducing them. He moved his eyes from one person to the next before stopping in front of Leyla\u2019s face, who stood at the far end of the group.\u201cShe\u2019s Leyla,\u201d Claudine introduced her while holding Matthias\u2019s arm tightly. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t recognize her, right? She\u2019s so different from usual that I almost didn\u2019t recognize her either.\u201dLeyla flushed with shame at Claudine\u2019s veiled sarcasm.\u00a0She seemed to be deliberately provoking her.As Claudine noticed it. No matter how many slurs she spat at Leyla, that emotionless girl would always react differently whenever Matthias was there.Suddenly, a warm voice broke the brief silence.\u201cSorry, excuse me.\u201dKyle Etman, the boy who had been loitering around with a disapproving look ever since Claudine took Leyla away.\u201cI apologize for interrupting your talk, but may I take my partner now?\u201dKyle reached out and pulled Leyla\u2019s hand without hesitation.Leyla seemed a little startled, but she complied. Instead, she looked relieved, like a missing kid who had found her parents after being separated from them.\u201cMy friends are also looking forward to meeting her.\u201dKyle eyed Claudine coldly, which contrasted with his gentlemanly manner.\u201cThen I have to give permission. We can\u2019t hold Leyla for much longer.\u201dClaudine happily nodded her head and glanced at Matthias, who seemed to pay no heed to them.\u201cThank you, Lady Brandt. And also\u2026. Duke Herhardt.\u201dKyle bowed courteously.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Leyla.\u201dWatching their backs, which were drawing further away, Claudine soon realized something after witnessing Kyle\u2019s tender smile when he stared at Leyla\u2019s face.She could tell as his mellow smile reflected his feelings clearly.That boy loved Leyla.That boy seemed to cherish her-who looked smaller and thinner beside him, who was the same height as Matthias- like his precious treasure.\u2018But, what about Leyla?\u2019Through her slightly opened eyes, Claudine studied Leyla closely. That girl was smiling back at that doctor\u2019s son.Claudine had seen Leyla Lewellin smile in front of her before. Yet, this was the first time she saw her bright and pleasurable smiley face, like a girl who was smitten.\u2018So, it\u2019s the doctor\u2019s son, not Duke Herhardt?\u2019\u2018Then was he the one who turned Leyla Lewellin into a princess?\u2019When Claudine was still ruminating in her daydream, Leyla and Kyle turned around.\u201cAh, Leyla!\u201dWithout realizing it, Claudine called her name.Leyla stood still, bathing in the light from the ceiling chandelier.\u201cYou\u2019re looking pretty lovely today. Especially your necklace.\u201d\u201cPardon? Ah\u2026.. yes. Thank you, miss.\u201dBewildered, Leyla fumbled for her necklace.The long emerald necklace dangling on her chest was finely crafted in the flower petal shape and matched the iris color of her eyes.That piece of jewelry suited her perfectly as if it had been made just for her.\u00a0The green gemstones also looked authentic, similarly to the white pearls that decorated the edges.The jewel necklace that adorned her slender neck was too lavish and enticing to be branded as a knockoff.\u2018Kyle Etman is just a doctor\u2019s son; could he afford to buy a necklace like that for her?\u2019\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Duke Herhardt?\u201dClaudine grinned as she looked at Matthias.\u201cYes. She is.\u201dUnbothered by it, Matthias answered her question as if he didn\u2019t care.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After putting up with a less-than-pleasant festive environment, Leyla could finally breathe a sigh of relief. She thanked him while leaning against the marble balustrade.\u201cThanks, Kyle. Thank you so much.\u201dLeyla thought Kyle would make a wisecrack, but his face looked pissed off instead.\u201cKyle?\u201d\u201cWhy are you holding it in?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re like a kitten on a string, they treated you like a circus animal. Why did you say nothing? You\u2019re not like the prideful and smart Leyla Lewellin that I know.\u201d\u201cAh, who cares.\u201dUnlike Kyle, who was overtly annoyed, Leyla just giggled. \u201cAnything about what they said, there\u2019s nothing wrong. I\u2019m an orphan, I\u2019m indebted to Uncle Bill, and I plan to become a teacher.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t understand your logic.\u201d\u201cDuplicity is human nature Mr. Etman.\u201dKyle laughed at her sarcastic reply, \u201cYou\u2019re only good at saying useless things.\u201d\u201cYou can go now Kyle. I\u2019m really fine.\u201d\u201cGo where?\u201d\u201cThere are still many people you have to meet there. Some of your friends have also been waiting for you.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Kyle waved his hand with a peeved look and rested his back against the fence alongside Leyla.\u201cKyle, don\u2019t be like that\u2026..\u201dKyle turned to her,\u201d I\u2019m here as your partner today.\u201dAs he said, his pair of brownish hue eyes gleamed warmly in the ashen night.\u201cSo I\u2019ll stay with you.\u201dA smile gradually crept over his lips like a butterfly blooming its wings.\u201cBecause I want to.\u201dA gentle wind blew through the rose garden, carrying the sweet scent with it. Leyla tried to answer him back, yet, her lips were sealed tight. So all she could do was grasp the handrail on the terrace in both of her hands.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering?\u201d Kyle asked her.Leyla dropped her head and gazed at the tip of her shoes awkwardly. Her face\u00a0blushed with shyness,\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\u201cAre you being shy in front of me?\u201d\u201cGeez\u2026No way.\u201d\u201cBut your face is blushing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201dLeyla touched her rosy cheeks.\u201cJust kidding.\u201dLeyla laughed after seeing Kyle\u2019s playful giggling. It was then when Mrs. Etman, who had been searching the party hall for her son, showed up on the terrace and found both of them.\u201cKyle. What the hell are you doing here?\u201d She sighed deeply and walked up to them.Leyla hurriedly straightened her stance and bent her head. Mrs. Etman accepted her greeting in passing and turned back to her son.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people waiting to see you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my father, not me.\u201dSeeing her son\u2019s response, Mrs. Etman\u2019s eyes glowered more sternly, \u201cKyle Etman. Do my words sound like a joke to you?\u201d\u201cMom, you know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. Madam Norma\u2019s waiting for you. You\u2019re not thinking of making her wait, are you?\u201dMrs. Etman showed her obstinate demeanor as if she didn\u2019t want to give an opening for Kyle to come up with any further counter-arguments.\u201cSee you later, Kyle.\u201dLeyla cautiously spoke after watching the tension between the mother and son.The duke\u2019s grandmother, Duchess Norma, adored the only son of their family doctor. And Leyla knew very well how proud Mrs. Etman was about it.\u201cI\u2019ll wait here.\u201dLeyla smiled to reassure Kyle.\u201cThank you, Leyla.\u201dOnly then, was Mrs. Etman able to smile at Leyla. That woman\u2019s brown-hued eyes, which were a replica of Kyle\u2019s, always looked bitterly towards her. Leyla knew that as well.Kyle reluctantly dragged his heavy steps as Leyla bid a goodbye, waving a little to him, who kept looking back.\u201cWait for me!\u201d Kyle cried as he grimaced.\u00a0 \u201cYou have to wait for me, Leyla!\u201d\u2018I will.\u2019Leyla wished to reply to his outcry, but she dunno why her lips remain sealed till the end. So, all she could do was laugh and vigorously wave her hand towards Kyle even more.The terrace was back to its peacefulness after their departure.The beautiful luminescence of the chandeliers mingled in harmony with the music and sound of laughter from the hall, creating an oasis of calm beneath night\u2019s moon.Leyla had left her glasses at home, so the flickering lights in the distance were nebulous. But, the dim night world became more dreamy and romantic within her blurry vision.Now, Leyla Lewellin\u2019s time in the spotlight was over.Leyla was able to wind down. She chuckled in awe in a happy mood as she looked closely at her unusual appearance tonight.Whenever she moved her legs a bit, the decorated ribbon on her waist and the skirt rattled slightly. Leyla became so jolly as she tiptoed up and down while her eyes fell on the swirling hem of her lavish dress.The white dress embroidered with the gold lace she wore was as enchanting as the dreamy night. The silky fabric of her dress fiddled across her skin and tickled her entire body softly.And the necklace.Leyla gently fondled her necklace and her sheepish smile perished like a fume.\u2018Why did Lady Brandt say that?\u2019She guessed that probably it was Claudine\u2019s avant-garde way of expressing her disdain and sympathy towards her.Yet, Leyla didn\u2019t mind it. The gift from Uncle Bill was breathtakingly lovely. Regardless of what some said the dress was meant for her and she was thrilled with it.Leyla smiled again but once she lifted her head she saw a fine figure of a tall man stepping out onto the terrace.Her face, which had blossomed with delight when she thought it was Kyle, turned frozen in a split second.Leyla\u2019s feet were glued to the ground after she realized who the guy was.It was Duke Herhardt.Along with Lady Brandt.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThe weather tonight is so clear, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Asked Claudine as she took a few deep breaths.As shown by her behavior, it seemed like she had taken the liberty of leading Matthias to the terrace to get some fresh air and enjoy the night breeze.\u201cSummer is my favourite season because its nights are so beautiful. What about you, Duke Herhardt?\u201dClaudine flashed her dazzling smile as she stood in front of the marble railing. She then tilted her head and eyed someone in the distance who was the reason they had come here in the first place.Leyla Lewellin, who was standing on the far side of the terrace. She was the key reason why Claudine brought Matthias here.\u201cI don\u2019t really like summer, my lady.\u201dMatthias cast his glance around the garden, beautifully framed by the sea of roses. Then his eyes momentarily passed over Leyla\u2019s face, which was flushed with embarrassment and nervousness at the unexpected guests\u2019 appearance.\u201cIs that so? I thought you liked summer.\u201dClaudine looked back to Matthias with her back against Leyla.\u201cNow that I think about it, Duke Herhardt seems to be a callous man. Of course, you know it\u2019s not a reproach, right?\u201dClaudine, with her hands held together behind her back, drew a step closer. The gulf between them now had narrowed to the point where they could taste the warmth of each other\u2019s breath.\u201cBut actually, I like that insensitivity of yours. I think it\u2019s very aristocratic, emphasizing your nobility and elegant manner, which no one else will match.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you like it.\u201dMatthias didn\u2019t back down and faced her calmly with a smirk adorning his lips.\u201cThen, kiss me, please.\u201dClaudine demanded boldly with her eyes fixed on him.\u00a0\u00a0Matthias just stared at her quietly for a fleeting moment before falling into a solemn silence.\u201cI like the heartless Duke Herhardt, but don\u2019t we still need to season our relationship with some passion or enthusiasm?\u201d said Claudine.As she tilted her head, her thickly wavy brown hair fluttered elastically.\u201cI mean, we will get engaged, get married, and will live together for the rest of our lives. So \u2026. a little passion \u2026\u201dMatthias narrowed his eyes for a moment before nodding as he agreed.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dWithout a grain of hesitation, Matthias reached out and embraced her cheek with both of his hands. Claudine jolted a little at his sudden move, but she soon closed her eyes naturally.Staring at the shadows cast by Claudine\u2019s eyelashes, Matthias\u2019 eyes unintentionally wandered to the other end of the terrace.He glanced at Leyla-who had been hovering around agitatedly-just in time.While constantly keeping his eyes on her, Matthias slowly lowered his face and bussed Claudine\u2019s lips.Leyla Lewellin stayed true to her role as Claudine\u2019s sole onlooker. With her body frozen like a doll, she watched the two with a blank expression. The darkness and great distance wasn\u2019t able to conceal the rosy-tint on his two cheeks.Throughout their very restrained kiss, Matthias\u2019s eyes had continued to be on her. Her emerald eyes helplessly looked at him in a paralyzed state. The luminous moon\u00a0 couldn\u2019t enliven her eyes, which were dull like the night sky.The moment Leyla avoided his eyes, the canoodle between the two was over as well. She hurriedly raced down the stairwell leading to the garden before Claudine slowly opened her eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dMatthias politely reached out his hand, and Claudine held it as if nothing had happened.\u201cI\u2019m sure, Duke Herhardt\u2026\u201dClaudine grinned as they entered the party hall.\u201cI\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll become a pretty good couple.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla dashed down the stairwell at a frenzied pace. She wasn\u2019t being chased, but she couldn\u2019t stop her feet from running harder and faster.The sound of her heels slamming against the gravel on the promenade shattered the serenity of the night garden.\u00a0Leyla only came to a halt after she arrived at the huge fountain in the middle of the garden.As she calmed her panting breath, her leg\u2019s long-forgotten pain reappeared. She was just noticing that her feet were hurting because all she had in mind before was simply escaping from the terrace.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dLeyla loosened the lace of her shoes a little and winced in pain. There were raw scratches all over her feet. Her heel\u2019s skin had been peeled off and was bleeding, due to her new stiletto heels.What she wanted to do now was to go back to her cottage but Leyla changed her mind and chose to stay in the garden instead.She had promised Kyle that she\u2019ll be waiting for him. At least, she had to let him know if she was going to take her leave first.Even so, she feared returning to that frenzied mansion, to that strange and unsettling world.Lumbered, Leyla walked in a grimace along the right side of the promenade and sheltered under the pergola in which rose vines were trained.She planned to wait in the garden first, then headed to the mansion to wait for Kyle\u2019s return.But, can I sit down here?Leyla was perplexed as she looked at the bench. The exquisite pergola was created out of the rose foliage cultivated and pruned by Uncle Bill\u2019s green hand. Yet, she had never sat underneath it because it was a seat that no other workers or servants were allowed to use.\u2018But tonight, I\u2019m here as the Arvis\u2019s guest, so wouldn\u2019t it be okay?\u2019After having more of such thoughts, Leyla decided to sit comfortably at the bench. She needed a little more time and courage before she could take off her shoes.She relaxed her exhausted body against the bench\u2019s armrests and wrapped her arms around her knees. Once her throbbing feet collided with the cold marble, the pain started to subside a little.Her beautiful shoes damaged her feet, to the point that she couldn\u2019t put them on again.\u2018My feet would not be hurting like this if I didn\u2019t run.\u2019She gently grazed the inflamed wound with her fingertips, before shaking her head when a sudden memory flashed in her mind.Leyla wrinkled her brow as she recalled Duke Herhardt\u2019s face glaring at her while he was kissing his fianc\u00e9.She just couldn\u2019t help wondering why Claudine took his kiss for granted even though she knew someone else was there.\u201cWhy did they do that?\u201dMumbling to herself, Leyla unwittingly rubbed her lips.\u201c\u2026.. So shameless.\u201dThis time, she caressed it hard with the back of her hand till the inside of her lips.She wished to forget about tonight\u2019s memories and the strange feeling she had when looking at his figure under the dim luminance of the moon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2727 Cry, Even Better If You Beg \u2727\u201cThat\u2019s so kind of you, ma\u2019am.\u201dMrs. Etman regarded Duchess Norma with a look of adoration in her eyes.\u201cHow can you be so generous?\u201dThe more tangible the joy spread on Mrs. Etman\u2019s face, the more troubled Kyle Etman\u2019s expression, who was standing by her side, became.Matthias had a keen eye on the two. Dr. Etman was, without a doubt, a talented doctor. He was well-rounded and had a pleasant personality, and so it was easy to see why the duchess admired him and adored his son.Kyle Etman, who resembled his father, would lead a similar life in the future. Maybe. As long as nothing else would change. His grandmother pretty much ensured that and Matthias saw things the same way.But that\u2019s it.There was no need for him to pay any more attention to such blatant and humdrum brass-tacks. Especially seeing Linda Etman, the very ambitious lady of the house, who had very different mannerisms from the two men of the Etman\u2019s family.\u201cMay I greet them now?\u201dMrs. Etman became a little agitated. She badgered Madam Norma, fearing the duchess might change her mind.\u201cDear.\u201dDr. Etman, who had been calmly watching his wife, tried to dissuade her. Even so, she appeared adamant.Matthias turned his attention back to Kyle Etman. His dear grandmother had offered to introduce the Etmans to Baron Arundt\u2019s family. When the duchess stated,\u00a0\u2018The two families would get along swimmingly, and could be good acquaintances,\u2019\u00a0there was no one who didn\u2019t understand the hidden flavor in her phrase.Baron Arundt had a daughter who was around the same age as Kyle Etman. A pretty daughter who had reached a good age to marry.Even though the Etman family didn\u2019t have any peerage, their wealth outweighed that of the Arundt\u2019s and they had greater clout. Thus, Baron Arundt was the one who would benefit the most if the two families became in-laws\u201cSure, Mrs. Etman. That would be nice.\u201dWith a generous smile, Norma Catharina von Herhardt called her servant. After receiving orders to bring Baron Arundt and his wife in, the servant soon vanished among the crowds.Kyle couldn\u2019t conceal the ire printed on his face. He kept glancing towards the patio linked to the garden as if he\u2019d left something precious there.Sure of that, Matthias\u2019s lips soon curved into a smile.A mother who cherished and expected the best from her son.A son who didn\u2019t want to disappoint his mother.Matthias almost chuckled out loud when he pictured Leyla Lewellin sandwiched between the two.Meanwhile, the Arundt\u2019s couples, led by the servant, came along with their daughter.Based on his countenance, Kyle Etman seemed to be aware of the meaning of this acquaintance. He seemed wanting to get out of there post-haste, but that boy couldn\u2019t unleash himself from the role of being a kind and polite doctor\u2019s son.If so, then\u2026Matthias scurried away, leaving the stage of the tedious matchmaking scene.\u00a0His stride over the terrace and down the stairwell was leisurely one and at his own pace.How did the dutiful son\u2019s puppy love story end up so predictably?Leyla Lewellin would be left abandoned in Arvis\u2019 forest at the end of this story.By the time he reached that obvious conclusion, Matthias had found Leyla. That girl was staying underneath the rose pergola in the corner of the garden.\u00a0As foreseen, Leyla didn\u2019t bother to go far because she had promised to wait for the doctor\u2019s son.Lightly trodding, Matthias walked over to her. He wondered why she didn\u2019t get flustered when he approached her. Soon he realized; she was in deep slumber.The small, crouching girl glinted in the glow-worm moonlight that filtered through the rose shrubbery.Matthias stopped a few feet away from the bench. And he took a long, thoughtful look at her.First, at her neatly taken-off shoes.At her swollen feet.At the slender arms wrapped around her knees.Lastly, his eyes were drawn to her innocent sleeping face.Her long drooping wavy golden locks wrapped around her slender neck and shoulders. Matthias slouched his waist and gently picked up her shoes while wondering about the softness of her golden tresses.It was that moment when Leyla slowly opened her eyes.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u2018I\u2019ve got to be dreaming.\u2019Vaguely, drowsiness was still rooted in Leyla\u2019s eyes. Matthias stood leaning against the pergola pillar that faced the bench and held what appeared to be women\u2019s shoes in his hand.\u2018Even if it\u2019s only a dream? Isn\u2019t it too weird?\u2019When the question came to mind, her lingering feeling of sleep dissipated.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Duke?\u201d Leyla whispered his name softly because she couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing.Instead of responding, Matthias fished out a cigar from his pocket and tucked it into his mouth.\u00a0The white cigarette smoke wafting off his lips in a single puff proved that this moment could never be a dream.Leyla was so startled. She almost blacked out when she found the shoe in his hand was hers. As she didn\u2019t know what to do, Leyla only could curl down her body to the edge of the bench.Matthias shot an amusing look at her as if she were a sideshow of a sideshow and waved her shoes slowly.\u201cShall I give it back?\u201dHis voice mixed along with the murky tobacco haze.\u201cYes, please.\u201d\u201cThen cry\u2026\u201dStunned. His ludicrous words gave Leyla the creeps and\u00a0left her speechless.She prayed silently that Kyle would come quickly, but the pathway leading to the pergola was deserted.\u201cHe\u2019s not coming.\u201d said Matthias calmly as if he had read her thoughts.\u201cKyle Etman.\u201dHe talked again after he saw Leyla doubting him.\u201cThe one you\u2019re waiting for.\u201dMatthias dropped his half-smoked cigarette butts to the ground. Behind the column of wispy smoke that gradually disappeared, he found Leyla\u2019s face looking up at him in tears.\u201cNo.\u201dNot wanting to show her wounded feet, Leyla rose from her seat and took a confident stance in front of Matthias. Her bare feet were firmly planted on the cold ground. She was still afraid of him, yet, she wasn\u2019t willing to become his laughingstock anymore.\u201cKyle always keeps his words.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou look pretty confident.\u201d\u201cI know more about Kyle than you do.\u201dA grin crept over Matthias\u2019 lips as he watched her muster all of her courage to challenge him.\u201cConfidence is not an arbitrary matter, Leyla.\u201dAlong with his gliding words, Matthias walked a step closer. Leyla\u2019s shoulders cowered in fear, but she refused to back off.\u201cI\u2026. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cWhy do you hate me so much?\u201dUnlike her trembling voice, Leyla looked straight at him with abundantly lucid eyes.\u201cHating you makes me feel good.\u201dMatthias answered calmly, raising one corner of his lips.\u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling when I see you cry, and it\u2019s fun to see you beg.\u201d\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just answering your question.\u201dMatthias seemed blase even though her expression, who stood before him, was already all at sea. Her eyes glazed over due to his insult, but Leyla managed to keep her tears from falling.\u201cYou don\u2019t act like this to anyone other than me.\u201dMatthias willingly nodded, \u201cRight.\u201d\u201cThen why is it only me\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s you, Leyla. Because you\u2019re nobody.\u201d said Matthias nonchalantly. His calm yet dry voice made Leyla feel even more as if she was a deplorable person.\u201cMy apologies, your grace.\u201dLeyla fought back the tears as she stared at him. She began to miss her relatives, who had evicted her for a variety of reasons. Even his alcoholic uncle had never oppressed her like this.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, because a \u2018nobody\u2019 like me dared to stay in your estate.\u201dNow, not only her voice but also her clenched hands started to quiver.\u201cIf you hated me so much, why did you let me stay on your estate from the beginning?\u201d Leyla demanded to know.\u201cIsn\u2019t that too heartless if I didn\u2019t let you?\u201d\u201cYou are indeed a heartless person.\u201dHer voice continued to whimper, no matter how desperately she attempted to suppress it.\u201cAre you going to rout me out now?\u201d she managed to ask.\u201cNo.\u201d Matthias\u2019s eyes grew darker as he watched her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. You\u2019re doing great in your place.\u201d\u201cYou said I was a nobody.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s your use.\u201dMatthias opened his eyes slowly. The scorny grin on the corner of his lips had rubbed off and his expressionless face now became suffocatingly cold and still.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, let\u2019s cut to the chase.\u201dMatthias raised his head and straightened his back, which had been leaning against the vine-rose pillar.\u201cThe Kyle Etman you\u2019ve been waiting for won\u2019t come.\u201dHe pointed his hand to the empty path behind the pergola. Leyla flinched in fear when his finger unwittingly touched her flowing hair over her shoulder. She took a step back, but the bench blocked her and she couldn\u2019t go any farther.\u201cSo Leyla\u2026..\u201dMatthias reached out his hand. He squeezed and caressed Leyla\u2019s blonde hair soft and took a deeper look at her.\u201cCry.\u201dMatthias gave a callous order calmly.\u201cEven better if you beg.\u201dAlong with his additional suggestion, a faint grin sprouted on Matthias\u2019 lips.\u2018He\u2019s crazy.\u2019Leyla had been debating it for a long time, but she was certain now.The duke was completely insane.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*After Matthias returned to his mansion, Kyle Etman was still being held by his mother.The Baron and Baroness Arundt seemed to like the idea of marrying her daughter into the Etman family. They were very much in favor of becoming in-laws, and Mrs. Etman\u2019s response was not significantly different.Unlike both the pair of parents,\u00a0 Kyle\u2019s demeanor was now noticeably rigid. But his mother didn\u2019t seem to give a damn about how he felt.For whatever reason, Matthias\u2019s interest was drawn back to their tedious family affair. Mixed among recognizable faces, he began playing the role of Arvis master, Duke Herhardt.Leyla cried.A sense of contentment percolated him when he reflected on that moment.That teenage girl trembled. Her face was littered with teardrops as she could no longer contain her indignation. Nevertheless, as the corners of her eyes turned crimson, her moist eyes became prettier and brighter.Leyla Lewellin\u2019s eyes gleamed like an emerald jewel dangling from her neck at those moments.She cried so beautifully, and Matthias loved it.He gladly returned Leyla\u2019s shoes after seeing her beautiful cry.When he was about to leave the garden, Matthias looked back and saw Leyla still standing there crying.That girl cried because of him. So the falling tears from her eyes belonged to him.Thinking of it, Matthias\u2019s steps became lighter.\u00a0\u00a0Tears of Leyla had washed away the displeasure swelling inside him at seeing Kyle Etman escorting her into the mansion. Together with the ineffable feeling, he had the moment he kissed Claudine while staring at Leyla.Tonight, in his world, Leyla looked exceptionally beautiful. And the beautiful, flawless her had cried because of him.\u2018What a perfect summer night.\u2019Matthias encapsulated that satisfactory sensation, just before Leyla had appeared suddenly on the grounds of the mansion.Alone, she loitered on the edge of the aisle that attached the hall to the terrace, carefully looking for someone.\u201cKyle Etman.\u201dMatthias muttered his name.Leyla seemed to have found Kyle among the partygoers. Nonetheless, she didn\u2019t approach him as she had grasped the meaning of the scene where Kyle Etman was surrounded by the Arundt household. Especially, with the presence of Baron Arundt\u2019s youngest daughter.Leyla had been hiding behind the marble pillar for quite some time. Before leaving the terrace, she approached a passing servant and relayed a message to him.The servant nodded his head and headed towards Kyle Etman, whose face had already turned cold as he had reached his limit of patience.But, just as the servant was about to deliver Leyla\u2019s message, Matthias suddenly waylaid him,\u201cPlease call Count Klein.\u201dThe servant widened his eyes at Matthias\u2019s sudden order. For a quick moment, he glanced across to Kyle Etman\u2019s side thoughtfully. But soon, he gave the exact answer Matthias had expected.\u201cYes, master.\u201dTurning his steps, the servant hurried through the crowd to run his master\u2019s errand.Matthias went out onto the terrace and leaned against the pillar where Leyla had been hidden a while ago.In the distance, Leyla was drifting along the promenade that led to the garden\u2019s center in the distance. She walked with a limp; her feet seemed to be in a lot of pain. She later took off her shoes and began wandering barefoot from the middle of the path.Matthias stood quietly, watching her while waiting for his servant.The guy in question-Count Klein was never going to show up. The count was suffering from a neurotic headache and he had already returned home after greeting him briefly earlier in the evening.Concurrently with Leyla disappearing deep into the forest road, the servant he had previously ordered had approached him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, master. Count Klein has already returned home.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dMatthias smiled, nodding his head.\u201cGood job.\u201dAfter acknowledging the servant\u2019s bow, Matthias strolled away from the terrace at a leisurely pace.The servant went back to his previous task, approaching Kyle Etman to deliver Leyla\u2019s message.In two shakes, Kyle\u2019s face was afflicted with a sense of dismay. He rushed out to the terrace after asking for understanding for his urgent need to excuse himself first, but Matthias didn\u2019t mind him.Despite her petite stature, Leyla Lewellin walked pretty fast.\u00a0 It was too late for Kyle to catch up to her.Matthias then went on a binge and joyfully took the glass of champagne presented by Riette.The nightfall was approaching.It was a perfect party on the glitzy night of midsummer.The party was perfect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bill\u2019s brother had passed away. Though the two brothers weren\u2019t close and hadn\u2019t seen each other in years, Bill couldn\u2019t overlook the fact that his brother was one of the only remaining family members he had in this world.Bill decided to take a short break from his job and travel to his hometown for a few days. He had no problem with going there, but his heart was as heavy as steel at the thought of leaving Leyla home all alone.\u201cDon\u2019t forget to lock the door. Don\u2019t leave the windows open, even if it\u2019s hot outside.\u201d Numerous times since last night he had lectured Leyla with the same words of advice.\u201cThe shotgun is hanging in my room\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make sure the door and windows are locked, and I\u2019ll put your shotgun next to my sleeping bed. If a bad person turns up, I\u2019m going to shoot them.\u201dLeyla calmly recited the lines that she had repeatedly heard.\u201cI\u2019ll eat well, sleep well, and I\u2019ll be doing well.\u201dBill was only going to be away for three days at most, but his excessive worry made it look like he would be gone for months. Bill reluctantly took his leave, though he still had a concerned look as Leyla followed him to the mansion\u2019s entrance to see him off.\u201cLeyla, did something happen at the party that day?\u201d Bill carefully posed a question after catching a glimpse of the stately mansion building.\u201cNo, there were no problems; I had a great time. Really.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good then, because you seem to be distancing yourself from Kyle after the party.\u201d\u201cMe? From Kyle?\u201d Leyla giggled at his nonsensical words. \u201cAh, we get along fine.\u2026 it\u2019s just, we\u2019ve been busy lately.\u201d\u201cCan I trust what you\u2019re saying?\u201d\u201cYes. Why would I lie?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. There\u2019s no way your friendship with Kyle would get awkward. Then Leyla, if you\u2019re afraid of being alone, you can bring Kyl\u2026. No, no. Pretend you didn\u2019t hear that.\u201d Bill flicked his hand fast. \u201cThat boy is the most dangerous.\u201d\u201cOh, Uncleee !!!.\u201d\u201cGet this through your head, if he comes over to play, make sure he returns before sunset.\u201d\u201cOh c\u2019mon, stop saying strange things, just go right now.\u201d Leyla lovingly swatted him on the back as they arrived in front of the entrance door of the mansion.Bill looked back several times. He kept reiterating his advice before he walked further, crossing the Platanus road.Leyla stood there, on the mansion\u2019s front steps, until Bill was no longer in sight. Every time he turned around Leyla flashed him a smile and happy-trails waves at him.The next three days were going to be a long for her.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cLeyla is avoiding me.\u201dThis time, Kyle was sure.\u201cI think it\u2019s because of the last party.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t difficult to figure out why.\u201cRight Phoebe, that you\u2019re also thinking the same thing?\u201dKyle asked seriously, but Phoebe simply sat on the window frame, pecking at the oats, pretending not to hear. He then sighed deeply as he sounded like a moron babbling to a pigeon.Another disappointing news came in the form of the content of Leyla\u2019s letter, which Phoebe brought back today.Buried within the note wrote that Uncle Bill would be in his hometown for a few days, and Leyla planned to spend the day in the library so that the cottage would be empty.Lately, the type of message he had got had been relatively consistent. She was either going to another friend\u2019s place, or she had an appointment downtown or was helping out in the garden.Kyle first thought she was notifying him rather than making him come into the vacant cottage in vain. But it just seemed like a bunch of excuses at this point\u2014a slew of clumsy reasons to avoid Kyle Etman.\u201cI don\u2019t blame her. If that had happened to me, I would do the same.\u201d Sighed Kyle, ruffling his hair.Before attending the party, he proudly stated that he was her partner and promised to protect her. Yet, the truth was quite the opposite. He\u2019d forgotten about her. After hearing the servant saying that Leyla had left the party, he dashed out of the hall, but alas, she had already gone.Kyle bemoaned to himself why he hadn\u2019t been able to leave the party hall sooner. He was the one that told her to wait first though. But he was the one who didn\u2019t follow through with his own promise.Phoebe flew away after finishing its meal, leaving Kyle, who was nervously wandering around his room, alone.Behind the window bar, Kyle stared in the direction the pigeon was heading in and impulsively stormed out of the room.He didn\u2019t remember how he got on the bike and started pedalling. All he could think of on the way there until he was out of breath was Leyla.Kyle arrived at Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage just as his heart was about to burst with thoughts full of her. His shoulders swayed up and down as he grappled to quieten the rhythm of his gasping breath in the sweltering heat.In the backyard, there were still dripping white sheets and pillowcases hanging on the clothesline. And beyond it, he could see a shadow of a woman with a delicate yet slender body shape.The sense of relief and compunction both melted away.Kyle savoured every taste of the moment while gently brushing his sweaty hair behind his forehead.Leyla slowly revealed her face behind the sheet just then, as though she sensed his presence, and her green eyes grew round with astonishment when she met eyes with him.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Kyle.\u201dThe tender voice which flowed through her dainty lips was sweet enough to make him forget about the embarrassing situation.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cSorry.\u201dAfter a long silence in front of the table facing Leyla, Kyle then opened his mouth and apologized profusely first. Leyla, who had been staring at her fingertips with her head down, abruptly lifted her eyes.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d\u201cNo. Don\u2019t say that.\u201d Leyla shook her head. She felt bad having heard his heartfelt apology. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. I\u2019m sorry I lied to you.\u201d\u201cNo Leyla, it\u2019s because of me. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I\u2019m not upset or mad at you. I\u2019m serious, Kyle.\u201d\u201cThen is there another reason? Why\u2026. You\u2019re avoiding me\u2026 something you don\u2019t want to tell me?\u201d\u201cYou know, Kyle, you\u2019re like my family and a brother to me, and I like you that way. So\u2026..so I think we should distance ourselves now.\u201dLeyla tugged the corners of her lips, trying to smile casually, yet it wasn\u2019t what she had expected after looking at Kyle\u2019s expression.She was pretty sincere when she said that she was not angry or upset with him. But that night, at that dreamlike party, Leyla noticed the wall between their world.Between Kyle and herself, there was a boundary line that she couldn\u2019t go across just because they were friends.Leyla had already realized that she wasn\u2019t deserving of being seen with the son of a prominent family. But she would\u2019ve never thought the chasm between her vague thoughts and the sight of the reality that splashed across before her was too painfully ruthless.An heir of a well-known family of doctors who could easily blend in with upper-class nobility. Kyle Etman, the man Leyla saw that day in the duke\u2019s opulent banquet hall, was a man who resided in a world beyond that dividing line.That Kyle Etman was no longer a child who used to play with her.Why should a child grow up and become an adult?That night, Leyla pondered the transparent and sad question as she walked along the dark forest path with her shoes in her hand.After that, she made up her mind.To accept the time she had passed through.And even in that passing time, she decided to accept it as the only way to protect her precious friend.\u201cDo you know that you\u2019re spouting nonsense now?\u201dKyle, who had been deafeningly still until that moment spoke up in a lowered and calmed tone.\u201cNo. I mean it.\u201d\u201cWhy do we have to be apart when we like each other?\u201d\u201cBecause only in this way will we be able to remain good friends for a long time. Kyle, I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d\u201cYou think I also want to lose you?\u201dKyle\u2019s eyes shook as he looked at her.\u201cHow can we be apart? That can\u2019t be, Leyla.\u201d\u201cKyle.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll never lose you. I won\u2019t even stay away from you. How can you say that?\u201d Kyle slammed the glass cup down on the table and clenched his fist tightly.You can\u2019t do that, Kyle.Leyla was just smiling\u2019 instead of revealing what she meant to say.\u2018It\u2019s time to become an adult.\u2019Leyla gulped down the thorny words and sprung from her chair.\u201cLet\u2019s have lunch, Kyle.\u201dShe hurriedly reattached the apron she had taken off earlier ago.\u201cAs an apology for lying, \u2014I\u2019ll make you a very delicious lunch.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cMatthias, can\u2019t you just discharge from the military already and focus on your family\u2019s business now?\u201dRiette lay down on the sofa as he put down the newspaper he had just read. He tilted his head while yawning, and saw Matthias sitting on the wing chair reading a book.\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad spending a year or two in the military division.\u201dMatthias gave a smooth reply while flipping the book\u2019s page. Even in this sweltering summer afternoon, he stayed dressed in his suit and tie in his bedroom.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a Herhardt family tradition, after all.\u201dRiette muttered to himself as he stretched listlessly.\u201cMatthias von Herhardt will be the most perfect Duke of Arvis, surpassing any of his forefathers.\u201dWhile Riette chuckled, the canary, who had been happily playing in the cage, suddenly spread its wings. The bird soared lightly and landed on the book that Matthias was reading.Matthias\u2019s face lit up as he looked at the chirping bird. It seemed that the bird was having a chat with him.It was quite an astounding scene for Riette, who had watched Matthias shoot and kill birds without even batting an eye on the hunting grounds for years.\u201cI hope that bird is a she, Matthias.\u201d Riette laughed as he shook his head. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, it would gross me out.\u201dMatthias reached his hand out to the bird without answering. The little bird tilted its head from side to side and softly rubbed its beak against the tip of his finger.\u201cDon\u2019t you think so, Claudine?\u201dRiette shifted his focus to Claudine, who was busy embroidering on the sofa across from them. She looked at Matthias, and his bird with an embroidery hoop on her hands and a faint grin crept over her expressionless face.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that birds with beautiful voices are usually male.\u201d\u201cUgh. Please, Claudine. Let\u2019s just believe it\u2019s a female.\u201d Riette jokingly shuddered. \u201cIt creeps me out to think of them interacting like that if they\u2019re both male.\u201dClaudine chuckled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? It\u2019s just a bird.\u201d She picked up the needle to continue her stitching.Matthias only turned the page after the bird bounced away from his book. He looked unconcerned even when the bird flew around bothering him, hopping on his hands, shoulders, and head.\u201cYou should wear a light yellow dress at the engagement party, Claudine. Duke Herhardt might adore you as much as that bird.\u201d\u201cNever.\u201d Claudine riposted on a dime. \u201cI hate yellow.\u201dAfter taking a deep breath, she went back to her needlework. \u201cThat color, it looks vulgar.\u201d She added with a bit of scoff.A strange smile bloomed on Riette\u2019s lips, who was pretending as if he had not heard that. Later on, he quit talking about the bird and began to rattle on about Matthias\u2019s military service and the upcoming engagement ceremony instead.\u201cOur little lady Claudine will soon be the lady who beat the royal princess.\u201d\u201cYour excessive flattery embarrasses me, Riette.\u201dClaudine smiled brightly even though her eyebrows were frowning.It was an open truth that the Berg Emperor coveted Duke Herhardt as his son-in-law.The emperor had a special affection for his youngest daughter. Moreover, the princess was a beautiful lady known as the \u201cFlower of the Socialites.\u201d Claudine, who was considered the next Duchess of Arvis for granted since childhood, felt a sense of crisis because of the princess.But Claudine triumphed in the end. Though she didn\u2019t win because of love.\u2018Matthias doesn\u2019t have to.\u2019That brief remark summed up the reasons for not becoming in-laws with the imperial family.Herhardt was a household with history, wealth, and honour that were no less than the emperor\u2019s.\u00a0It was reasonable to state that the hassle of serving the princess was greater than the benefit of having her as a duchess.It sounded so arrogant. But such arrogance was pardoned when it was placed before Herhardt\u2019s name.Thanks to that, Claudine Brandt was regarded as the lady who outshone the emperor\u2019s daughter.It was easy to see why the Herhardts chose her. She was the only daughter of an illustrious count who lacked a successor. The Herhardt\u2019s must have viewed Claudine as a bride-in-law with a fine pedigree and dowry comparable to that of the princess, but one who didn\u2019t have to be served like a royal.Regardless of the substance, Claudine Brandt\u2019s name would be positioned higher than Berg\u2019s royal princess when the engagement ceremony took place. The thought made Claudine feel like she could love everything in this world. Including that vulgar little bird.\u201cI can\u2019t believe the engagement of two people right in front of me is just around the corner. It gives me a strange feeling.\u201dRiette sat up straight and gently extended his arms in a shrug.Claudine looked at him serenely before returning to her unfinished embroidery work.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In hindsight, nothing had changed in his plan. At least until he left the annex.Matters were thrown into disarray after he twisted his body to look behind and found himself standing on the road leading to the gardener\u2019s cottage.Matthias halted, pausing in his footsteps with a pensive look on his face.The days had marched on as they should. Everything went off without a hitch and in an orderly fashion.Her tears on that night had also been washed away and cleaned off all traces of his foreign feeling.Matthias expanded his stride and strolled through the shady forest path. He tugged at his tie and loosened it, then pushed open a few buttons on his tight-fitting shirt. His gestures were a bit rougher, and he wasn\u2019t as calm as he always was.It was sickening.He loathed these emotions that were out of his track.It was aggravating for him to be plagued with feelings he couldn\u2019t curb.Mathias wanted everything in his world to be in its place. So did his own feelings. That\u2019s the reason why he had never been enamored of a creature called a woman.In his orbit, the lust for sex was simply an instinct. He had never dwelled on it or been swayed by it.Rather, it was cumbersome-nothing more than a need to be adequately satisfied and dried away. Such desires, to begin with, didn\u2019t rule the roost in his mind.That\u2019s how the annoyance and discomfort he felt because of Leyla grew and wreaked havoc on his stable world.Only she now could be in his world.His whole five senses were fixed on her and blinding passion welled up deep inside him uncontrollably.\u00a0There were oftentimes when his gluttonous desire and lustful thoughts to possess her became too much for him to handle.Matthias was displeased as he learned he was obsessed with such trivial things. He couldn\u2019t even put it on his list of priorities.Leyla Lewellin was a good-for-nothing who belonged to that league.Still, he needed to make sure.The long line of the forest trees gradually petered out as the cottage building grew closer.Pondering, Matthias walked into the blanket of light. The jolly beam of summer sunlight was drifting down, permeating his eyes through the slats of twigs.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla had found a baby bird sprawled on the ground.She was traveling home after sending Kyle off when she suddenly heard the sound of a helpless squeal.Leyla spotted a fallen baby bird under a tree in the backyard. A tiny, fragile nestling that had just recently had it\u2019s feathers begin to grow.\u201cOh, did you fall?\u201dLeyla wrapped the baby bird with a careful touch and raised her eyes, looking up at the tree.Precisely as she had thought, there was a bird\u2019s nest sited in one of the tree\u2019s limbs. The tree loomed quite high, but thankfully, the baby bird wasn\u2019t severely injured.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201dLeyla petted the baby bird gently and tucked it into her apron\u2019s pocket. She hurried back to the cottage to take the ladder stashing in the warehouse.She securely leaned the ladder against the tree and started climbing up.The nest was nestled between branches higher than the ladder, so she had no choice but to clamber further.Climbing that high usually had never been a problem for her. But with the baby bird in her pocket, Leyla became more circumspect in her movements and couldn\u2019t be as nimble as usual.After ascending the closest bough to the bird\u2019s nest, Leyla snatched the branch with one hand and thrust the other into her pocket.She painstakingly stretched her arms as far as she could and safely handed back the baby bird to its nest.Too bad, just as she breathed a sigh of relief, her foot suddenly slipped off, and she lost her grip on the branch.The world spun upside down in a split second as her body bounced and lost its balance. She had managed to grab the branch\u2019s end and hold it tight, but the ladder had dropped to the ground. Alas, the branch that was too weak to support her body weight, started making a crackling sound.\u201cUncleeee! Uncle Billlll!\u201dThe terrified Leyla reflexively screamed aloud. But her shout was met by the silence that she realized Uncle Bill wasn\u2019t at home.\u201cKyleee!\u201dThough she knew Kyle had walked too far and couldn\u2019t hear it, Leyla kept crying and calling out to him. Kyle was her only hope when Uncle Bill wasn\u2019t here. Because they were the only ones who would come to help her when she was in trouble.\u201cLeyla.\u201dSuddenly, a familiar voice appeared out of nowhere.The mellow voice called out her name softly as if singing a song.Her mind had turned white with fear, but Leyla could still recognize the owner of the voice. She lowered her frightened gaze, and someone she knew was standing right below her.Duke Herhardt.With an unbothered state\u2013his eyes strayed at the fallen ladder and calmly watched her hanging precariously on the half-broken tree branch.He laughed, asking her.\u201cShall I save you?\u201d\u2018That crazy person, why does he \u2026?\u2019\u201cNo need!\u201dEven amidst her fear, Leyla flatly refused his offer of help. She persisted in holding onto the tree branch though she knew her tries were fruitless.The branch began to shake even more showing how rickety it was quickly becoming as the crack became deeper.\u201cKyle! Kyleeee!\u201dHer cries mingled with fright, calling for Kyle reverberated through the Arvis\u2019 forest.Matthias giggled at a peek. He turned to look down the path that the young man had gone.\u201cHe\u2019s not coming.\u201dHe said and relaxedly folded his arms.\u2018No matter how heartless he is, doesn\u2019t he feel the least bit concerned when he sees people in danger?\u2019Leyla soon understood that astounding fact about the person standing before her. He was Duke of Herhardt. That insane duke wouldn\u2019t be able to have a reasonable mind like a normal person.\u201cGo away!\u201dShe snapped at him in annoyance and shooed him away.\u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to help, just go! Why are you still standing there!\u201d\u201cIt seems you\u2019re gonna fall, I\u2019ll call someone to save you.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not such a heartless person, Leyla.\u201d Matthias\u2019s lips curved into a drowsy grin. \u201cI\u2019ll call Mr. Etman, whom you were calling desperately.\u201d\u2018You dipshit.\u2019His voice could no longer be heard as the noise of her panting breath had drowned it out.\u201cWell, let me see, what am I gonna do? Looking at the height, I think It\u2019s better to call Dr. Etman instead.\u201d\u2018Goddammit.\u2019Leyla felt she had every reason for mowing him down with a hail of the most virulent cusses, if only her position right now didn\u2019t hinder her from doing so.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Sa, save me!\u201dLeyla wailed in despair.Rather than begging the man in front of her, she would rather crumble to the ground and be wounded.That\u2019s all she thought before her fear compelled her to forego her principles.\u201cAre you sure?\u201dMatthias asked, leisurely taking off his coat.\u201cCall me, then.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCall me.\u201dHe took a few steps closer to the tree before coming to a stop and staring longingly at her.As if he were waiting.Waiting for the moment of her fall if his demand\u00a0 would not be met. Leyla freaking knew it, that he was a man capable of those deeds.\u201cDuke, please!\u201dLeyla begged him with teary eyes and her voice miserably sobbing.\u201cDukeeee!\u201dHer plea grew more despondent as the moment for her fall drew nearer.After she hailed him for the millionth time, the branch ended up broken.She fell.Leyla\u2019s mind went blank. Her vision became hazy as her body floated down from the tree.Then he cometh.Matthias ran hell for leather towards the tree and embraced her deeply in his arms. Their bodies bumped onto the ground but Matthias refused to let go, and kept hugging her with all his might.The dirt and dust brume clouding them colliding on the soil gradually dissipated. Leyla\u2019s head was buzzing, but slowly she got her consciousness back.Soft.It felt pillowy and unbelievably cozy even though she had fallen from a elevated place.Leyla opened her eyes. The warmth she felt belonged to a man, whom she had unknowingly hugged tightly.Duke Herhardt lay underneath her. And she was blanketed safe and sound in the his arms.She could feel the sound of his beating heart transmitted to her chest that were intimately in touch with each other.His arm muscles wounded around her waist and the back of her head stoutly, were incredibly strong.As she slowly raised her head, a faint minty scent of water could be smelled from the nape of his neck. His skin was smooth and warm, and mantled with a wonderful fragrance.The heat, which had started from her cheek, quickly dispersed throughout her body in no time.It gave Leyla a startled shudder when her body started to reheat. She wrestled her hardest to escape from him.Glossing over the shame as their bodies were entwined in a close knot.\u00a0 He was too big and too hefty. Matthias\u2019 bondage had only gottem stronger the harder she tried to secede.\u201cSsst..Stay still.\u201dMatthias ordered her with a low sigh.\u00a0 But Leyla\u2019s resistance grew fiercer.\u2018No.\u2019She was fed up. Her blood was boiling.\u2018What a jerk. I don\u2019t want to.\u2019Leyla tried to scream, but she didn\u2019t get a single word in.Matthias\u2019s choking embrace which was trapping her, meanwhile became growingly hot. His head and waist hugging her were ever mightier. All of those strange yet unfamiliar sensations were getting awol to her and Leyla couldn\u2019t take it any longer.She was scared shitless and desperately tried to break free. But the more she wanted to resist, the more helpless she felt. Whatever she did, Leyla couldn\u2019t push herself off of him.The moment her delusion soon coalesced with her worst dread, without heed of, she blindly bit the duke\u2019s ear.\u201cAckh!\u201dMatthias grimaced in pain and straight off shoved her backward. He was dumbfounded, but soon, his mouth twisted in a pucker of amusement.Matthias found it hilarious watching her trembling so badly when she was the one who had savagely assaulted him.Leyla\u2019s vivid green eyes glared at him ferociously, acting as she wanted to rip him into pieces. Matthias stopped laughing.\u201cBe a lady, Leyla.\u201dMatthias lightly caressed his bitten ear\u2014 immediately grabbed Leyla by the hair without batting an eye.Without reflexes, she had been pushed to the ground. Matthias\u2019 visage loomed above her, glowering at her with his void-slitted eyes.\u201cSo this is what I get in return after saving your life? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too unladylike?\u201d\u201cWhy should I be ladylike when you\u2019re not even a gentleman?\u201dLeyla turned her face aside. Embarrassment was splotching her cheeks with red color as she tried to push his body one more time. But Matthias had snatched her chin with his scorching-hot hand and dragged her face to his.\u201cDidn\u2019t your mouth just say I was a gentleman?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 No! I misspoke!\u201d\u201cDid you?\u201d\u201cA gentleman, huh. It\u2019s hogwash. If you\u2019re a gentleman\u2026.H-How can you d-do \u2026this?\u201dLeyla stammered with a face that was going to break into tears and struggled to get away from him.Matthias\u2019s eyes narrowed. A small furrow formed between his eyebrows as he looked at Leyla rubbing her lips as if they had been polluted with something filthy.\u201cPlease step aside.\u201dLeyla glared at him with a sullen look invading her face.\u201cSomething like this, I\u2026\u2026Argh!\u201dA shrill scream came out,\u00a0 letting the last syllable hang in the air. Matthias had lowered his head and bit back her ear.All happened in a snap, almost unexpectedly.With a relentless thud, Matthias slammed her onto the earth. He gripped her clawing little hand, hindered her move, and roughed up her ear.\u201cAckhhh!\u201dHer shrieking breath fell when Matthias began to suck and nibble on her lobe.Matthias initially planned to repay what she had granted him, but he had changed his mind and pushed her with a tenacious force.Leyla groaned and twisted her body when he bit her clammy earlobe hard. The sound of sobbing and gasping was muggy and ovenlike. Matthias weight-pressed her flailing limbs and branded his teeth\u2019 mark all over her reddish ears.A satisfied smile presented on his face after he saw Leyla\u2019s messy countenance.Her innocent eyes were soggy, transparently swollen with tears. Her slightly open lips, which were even darker than its hackneyed shade, gulped in a lungful of heavy air.Matthias tightly clutched her crumbly intertwined fingers and sensuously devoured her moist lips.Astonished by his sudden kiss, Leyla firmly clenched her lips, but Matthias had easily dispatched her resistance.This sweltering summer would end by soon enough.Matthias perfectly got the picture. Still, it didn\u2019t stop him.He kept shoving his hasty tongue in, sucked it up, and swallowed it as if he meant to engulf her.Pellucid saliva, moaning voice, and rough breathing began to flow through their overlapping lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2727 Tore It Out, Crushed It Up, and Threw It \u2727Whenever Leila struggled, Matthias increased the strength of his hold and Leyla desperately resisted as he did so.What was plastered over her sight every time she opened her tightly closed eyes was only a fickle scene.The shaking leaves\u2026The unfolding sky\u2026and Matthias\u2026.The dirty floor, wherein the leaves\u2019 silhouettes flickered over it, and him again.The yellowish dust clumped onto and canopied them in a sandy shroud. Their passionate kissing came perilously close to a brawl.At some point, Leyla didn\u2019t even know what she was up to. The fear of not breathing and the necessity of needing to do so were grouped into one.On the flip side, the duke\u2019s attempt to suck her lips and tangle her tongue with his only seemed to flare more. Leyla had no choice but to resigned herself defeatedly as if she were a living prey that was being had been consumed by a predator.Her breath became weak and thready at the brachial. She cried out in heartbreak when Matthias\u2019 desirous lips started to travel her scruff quickly and strongly.A flurry of buttons scattered as he tore off her blouse, revealing her slender clavicle. His lips persistently provoked one specific spot on her neck where her pulse was beating.His hand that had fondled her thighs and waist, tardily made its way up and grappled her luscious bosoms.\u201cAh\u2026 !\u201dLeyla shook her head hard and yanked on Matthias\u2019 shirt. The ripped button on his shirt bounced on the ground. She scratched his skin with her sharp nails, stamping red streaks on his neck several times.The red hickey engraved by Matthias\u2019 lips one by one began to garnish her clavicle. Tears sprung to her eyes as his lips began to trail down her collarbone.Leyla\u2019s mind went numb.Matthias\u2019s body heat, which came into contact with hers, did give her a discombobulation and novel feeling.She was afraid and baffled as to why she had to go through this nightmare.Matthias, thankfully, was able to put a stop to his deeds. He bowed his head and glanced down at her, one arm supporting his body.Leyla opened her eyes; Matthias\u2019 gasp was still erratically rough, but his eyes didn\u2019t seem to be those of a man engrossed in lust.His eyes were deep and serene. Akin to the day he stomped on a coin or the moment he calmly shot a bird to death. The way he looked at her made Leyla\u2019s face flush in indignation.Matthias placed his stare on her for a few seconds. He drew his eyes closed and slowly opened them. The wriggling of his Adam\u2019s apple had ceased as he got a grip on his breathing a little.The forest wind randomly fluttered Leyla\u2019s hair into a complete mess. The smooth golden waves hovered in front of him as he lowered his gaze.Matthias wiped off the dirt from his hands, then twisted his body to the side.He carefully took in his surroundings.A woman who was lying under the shade of a tree and sobbing.A yard with a clothesline loaded with freshly dried laundry.The old cottage that stood alone.And he who was seated in this ludicrous world with a screwed-up appearance.Matthias scoffed faintly and swept his drooping hair off his forehead. Beside him, Leyla curled up her body in a circle, trying to suck in more air.\u201d Pfft..Ha..ha..ha\u2026\u201dThe moment he saw her battered figure riddled with dust, Matthias\u2019s laughter, became more and more devastating to her ears.\u2018You.\u2019Drawing in a long breath, Matthias wiped his damp lips with the back of his hand. There was a splotch of blood.\u2018Just because of a nobody like you.\u2019When he turned to look behind him, Leyla had already bolted to the bottom of the tree. She glared at him vehemently and scrunched the picked-up tree branch with her quivering hands.Tears were still dripping from her gleaming eyes.Matthias lifted himself from the ground after receiving such a menacing glare from a woman who was doing the same thing to him. He gazed down, hushedly, at his hand, which had recently grabbed a handful of toasty soil.\u2018You may not know. I truly wanted to wring your little neck with this hand.\u2019Mathias turned around unhesitatingly after having grabbed his coat.Summer in Berg was brief.When the time was ripe, a cold breeze would blow, and the seasons would change in a jiffy.Mathias was no stranger to it.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla was only able to get up after Duke Herhardt was no longer in sight.She picked up her glasses and put them on. Both of her legs seemed to rumble. She walked stumbling, trembling, tripping, and had to take several break before she finally reached the cottage.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have fallen to the ground.\u2019The tears beaded down her cheeks with great regrets. The unpleasant taste was still there, no matter how many times she cleaned her lips with her hand or her apron.Leyla strolled over to the water tap and pumped it hard. The cold water spilled out of the bucket because of the pressure, soaking her clothes but she didn\u2019t care.\u201c\u2026No.\u201dShe muttered, unsure about what exactly she was trying to deny.\u2018No. No. No.\u2019Leyla shook her head. The bucket was full as her irregular breathing mingled with those repetitive sentences.She covered her shaking hands and looked around nervously as if she were being hunted by something.But, everything was the same.It was Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage. The homiest place in the world. The place she endlessly loved.The wind ruffled the leaves, and birds sang while perched on the tree\u2019s slats. The backdrop of the forest looked beautifully dazzling and still as the time neared the sunset, bathing everything in a golden shaft of light.But Leyla\u2019s heart kept throbbing uneasily. She was mystified with what she denied but also didn\u2019t know what she was afraid of.One thing was clear though. She had to get away from all this.Leyla took off her glasses and washed her face repeatedly with the water-filled bucket. She wiped the nape of her neck which was mottled with red marks. She continued to clean her ears, yet the finer traces that he left behind were still vivid.The overcast sky appeared so buff, Leyla stared at it with a blank look on her face.She suddenly clenched her teeth, lifted the bucket, and submerged herself with cold water. Her body trembled with a chill as the water washed her down from the head to toe.Leyla drew water from the tap again, shaking, as she was fed up with the unpleasant memory of her persistent survival. This time, she thoroughly rinsed all over her mouth with her palms full of water.Cough!Splashing water, she thought, would flush away those memories. But it was no use. She still recalled that nasty and absurd things.Cough! Cough!Leyla stopped washing. Her throat choked as she had accidentally swallowed the water.She crouched, crying, before pumping more water from the tap.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias took a leisurely walk around the garden before stopping at the periphery where the rose flower bed garden and the marble stairwell leading to the manor were assembled.Though he had brushed the dust off his clothing, the remnants of it still could be seen in every place. For it was of no account to him. The problem was his memory. Those memories only became more clear whenever he took a step at a time.When Leyla huddled in his arms, any semblance of his rationality evanesced. There was nothing but a hunger-like thirstiness to have her; as if he had morphed into a wild beast.Matthias licked his lips and batted his bangs aside from his forehead. He sought to see how and where this lascivious desire would stop.If that nobody woman, Leyla, hadn\u2019t cried, it would have been meaningless, vain, and ultimately insignificant.If only he could restrain himself. If only he could refrain from hurling abuse at such a woman.\u00a0Perhaps\u2026..Rearing his head, Matthias saw the mansion sitting in the tawny sun of the afternoon. Behind him, the forest across the garden seemed to be a desolate world cloaked in stillness.It was quiet.Something stood by itself in a place of nothingness.A hankering interest and ruling passion for a beautiful woman. Matthias haltingly closed his eyes as if erasing something silly that was bothering him.He opened them again and plucked a cluster of roses in full bloom which resembled her tears.From his grasp, the pungent scent of crushed roses spread thickly, poking the nose. It had a pleasing redolence that reminded him of that woman\u2019s body odor.He tore it, crushed it, and threw it.The torn and broken rose petals fell scattered strand by strand at his feet in a lumbering pace.The memory of a girl passing through this garden came to his mind one after another along with the fallen petals.Every time he returned home to the Arvis manor, that child always grew up more hearty.A full-blooming rose meadow had become a familiar sight in the neighborhood where the child resided.As the winter months came, the flower bed was peacefully carpeted with snow. Seasons continued to be repeated, the time elapsed, and the girl did grow up and turned into woman like a sequence of scenes.By the end of the day, however, it was all for naught.Matthias fondled his lips with the rose-scented hand and strode over the flake of petals.As the sun began to set, a cool breeze blew clemently, foretelling the end of the summer.Matthias never looked back as he climbed the stairwell and entered the blinding artificial light of the mansion.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The sky on the western horizon, where the sun had returned to its nest like the doves was now tinged with deep purple hues.The darkness ploddingly inked across the room, but Kyle didn\u2019t switch the lamplights on. He leaned deeply on a chair by the window, his gaze reared at the sky, which was continuously shifting its radiant shade.Ever since coming back from the Arvis\u2019 cottage, Kyle had been confined to his room. Without a playful grin teased on his lips, his grayish eyes gave a shady cold nuance.He ate lunch with Leyla in a friendly setting. Kyle didn\u2019t say no because she was trying to act as usual.But he knew. Their time together wasn\u2019t the same as before.If he can\u2019t find a solution any sooner, he\u2019d have to let her go.Kyle wiped down his dry face with his hand as if washing it.Leyla said that she wished for them to remain good friends for a long time. And to stay as friends, they should keep their distance.He finally grasped the meaning of it. Yet, Kyle had a very different plan. Surely, he wanted to spend a long time with her, but not as a good friend in disguise.Thereby, he was unable to wait for long.Kyle took a hard stance after he came to that conclusion. He didn\u2019t want to squander those happy days with Leyla, so it was time to let go of his unseeable feelings.Taking a deep breath, Kyle opened the door and stomped down through the corridor.A dim light glinted, seeping beyond the door of his father\u2019s study. Kyle reassured himself in front of the door before drawing yet another breath.At the duke\u2019s party, Kyle got the gist of his mother\u2019s reason for presenting him to the aristocracy. He didn\u2019t have the faintest notion of what was going through his mother\u2019s mind when she was considering engagement or marriage at the time, but today, he was rather grateful for that, somehow.\u2018I can\u2019t lose you. Or be apart from each other. How can we do that?\u2019Mulling on the words he said to Leyla, Kyle knocked on the door vigorously.\u201cFather, it\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cCome on in, Kyle.\u201dHe heard his father\u2019s warm and loving voice beyond the door. Encouraged by his sweetness, Kyle slowly opened the door to the study. Dr. Etman, who sat in front of the desk, smiled as he welcomed his son.Instead of slumping in the chair across his father\u2019s desk like he usually did, Kyle stood upright in front of his father.\u201cI have something to tell you, father,\u201d he said.\u201cThis isn\u2019t something you usually do. It\u2019s quite a serious thing to say, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKyle clenched his fists tightly to muster up his courage.When push came to shove, he was going to say this anyway.He heartened himself and swallowed.Next year, he will enroll in the college and leave for the capital. And Leyla, on the other hand, had planned on staying in this city and pursuing a career as a teacher.Distance would separate them for a long time.Kyle, however, wasn\u2019t quite convinced with just that. The fact that there would come a day when Kyle Etman wouldn\u2019t be standing next to Leyla Lewellin.He pondered upon this.What if they both went to college together? How about they studied as medical and ornithology students at the same time? And what if they lived together for the rest of their lives as they had been? As friends, lovers, and family.\u201cMother seems to be thinking about my marriage nowdays.\u201dDr. Etman soon let loose a short lived barking yet delightful laugh at what Kyle said.\u201cThat day, your mother went a little ahead of herself. Don\u2019t let it bother you too much, Kyle. I understand your mother\u2019s feelings, but I disagree with her. There\u2019s no need to hurry.\u201d\u201cNo, father.\u201dKyle looked at his father with a determined glance.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of getting married.\u201d\u201cMarriage? Kyle? You?\u201d Dr. Etman\u2019s eyes creased slowly as he faced his son.\u201cYes.\u201dKyle replied with a nervous but laid-back voice.\u201cI want to marry Leyla and go to college with her.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She jolted by\u00a0the owls hooting\u00a0and suffered from the suddenly-flashing nightmares. The duke\u2019s countenance often dawned between dreams of her being beaten or thrown away. The memory of their kiss littered along tirelessly, and deepened in her dreams like a glutinous swamp.The first blush of the morning rose and each passing day seemed so long and eternally lasting. Leyla occupied herself and kept moving without taking a single break.She took care of the livestock, tended to the lawn, and swept and polished everywhere in the already spotless cottage. She washed all the curtains and bedding and even organized the warehouse. Reading a book or studying was the only chore she gave something a miss: as her eyes, strangely, couldn\u2019t draw a bead on the book\u2019s prose.Leyla had spent the whole day alone, pacing until the nightfall brought upon her another nightmare.On the morning of the fourth day, she went out to take care of the backyard, tightly knotting the apron\u2019s string behind her.Everything was so mind-numbing.Bill Remmer regularly spent most of his day at work. Apart from helping him with his job, Leyla went through her everyday chores and studies.Living together didn\u2019t mean that everything could be done together. They just sat at the same table, returned to the same warm house in the evening, shared stories from their days, and so on\u2026\u201cThis is the first time.\u201dLeyla murmured pensively at\u00a0the flash of realization.Ever since she was driven to Berg, she hadn\u2019t led a single day apart from Uncle Bill. He had always been by her side, and there was never a day that she was alone. Bill Remmer was always there with her, at both day-peep and eventide, like a clockwork.But now, she was on her own.The realization that\u00a0Leyla Lewellin had realized over the span of four days\u00a0brought her another realization. It enlightened her: how lonely, sad, and afraid she was when she wandered in this world, all alone.Leyla plodded a step back after momentarily standing idly. While feeding the chickens and milking the goats, she kept taking a glance across the yard.Her fondest wish for Uncle Bill\u2019s return had grown into a sincere prayer. She was pretty sure much of her perplexity and frustration would wither away once he returned. Her loneliness, her teen sadness, the loathsome memory of her first kiss could be forgotten with someone to keep her company.Everything was going to be okay, and things would go\u00a0back to the way they were before.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cKyle Etman.\u201dKyle looked back, startled after someone suddenly hailed his name from behind. His father had already loomed behind his chair.\u201cYes, father.\u201dKyle hurried to his feet. A book remained open on the same page for several days on his desk. The page hadn\u2019t been flipped since the evening when he\u00a0announced he would marry Leyla to his father.\u201cYou\u2019re home early.\u201dKyle alternated between staring out the still-bright window and at his father\u2019s face. Dr. Etman\u2019s lips bent into a gentle smile when he saw his son\u2019s darting eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a weekend, Kyle.\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, already?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t ask what you\u2019re thinking. I think I know even if you don\u2019t tell me.\u201dDr. Etman mumbled a laugh and leaned in the chair where Kyle was flumping a while ago. It was his quirk whenever his father had something to tell. Kyle pulled a chair in front of the table and sat facing his father, a little nervous.His father hadn\u2019t answered and was silent on that very day. After giving Kyle a long stare, all he said was\u00a0to give him a few days to think about it.. Kyle was mindful that there was no use of daring to talk when his father had expressed himself in such a manner and tone.Hence, he did nothing but wait. Though his desire tempted him to sprint towards her in that split second. So Kyle endured it and wasted his days living in a slow-moving damn clock. Because he didn\u2019t want to hurt Leyla by giving her ambiguous promises.\u201cI completely understand how you feel. I know how much you love Leyla. But Kyle, you and her are still too young to talk about marriage.\u201d\u201cBut father, you married mother when you entered medical school, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThat was already 20 years ago.\u201d\u201cLady Brandt is only a year older than Leyla, and she\u2019s getting engaged next week.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cLady Arundt, who was introduced by mother, is also the same age as Leyla.\u201dSeeing Kyle refute every single one of his words with a stiff face, Dr. Etman\u2019s laughter eventually burst out, \u201cIt seems, you\u2019re more serious than I thought.\u201d\u201cFather, I know I\u2019m still young. I also understand what worries you.\u201d\u201cDo you love Leyla so much that you\u2019re willing to sacrifice anything for her?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Kyle\u00a0answered with no hesitation. For him, loving her was as natural as breathing. And so, it wasn\u2019t even necessary to take it for granted.\u201cI can help Leyla go to college by becoming her sponsor.\u201dWith a stern yet loving gaze, Dr. Etman looked at his beloved son dearly,\u201cLeyla is a good child. She\u2019s good-minded and smart. I know her well, Kyle, and I\u2019m willing to sponsor her to go to college if she wants to.\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m really hoping Leyla can continue in her favorite field of study. But father, what I want the most is to marry her.\u201d\u201cIt takes more than two people to make a marriage happen.\u201d\u201cHousehold, dignity and prestige. I\u2019m not saying that those things are unimportant.\u201d\u201cSo, how come you\u2019re so obstinate?\u201d\u201cNo matter how important those things are, Father, there can\u2019t be something more important than the person who will be with you for the rest of your life.\u201d\u201cKyle.\u201d\u201cI want to be a great doctor, as well as a good husband and father. As much as you. But, Father, everything starts with Leyla for me.\u201d Kyle said. His heart started to pound, almost as if it wanted to ball out of his chest. But he suppressed it and began to broach about all the things he had kept under his hat for years.\u201cI want to live with Leyla, by her side, as Leyla\u2019s good person, her good husband, the good father of her child.\u201dHis heart now felt like it would burst open,\u00a0but Kyle went on to say.\u201cIf I have Leyla by my side, I firmly believe that I can make all of that happen, but father, without her, those things are just a pie in the sky.\u201dHe spelled back to his father in a firm, unwavering tone.\u201cWithout her, I don\u2019t have the confidence to live as such a person.\u201dKyle raised his head to see his father; his hands clamped together on his lap.\u201cI believe Leyla is a woman who meets both her father\u2019s and mother\u2019s expectations. She\u2019s perhaps the most wonderful thing I\u2019ve ever had.\u201dDr. Etman gave the eye to his son with a solemn face.\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose her.\u201dKyle\u2019s eyes glistened with a determined light.\u201cPlease help me protect Leyla, father.\u201d(\u00a0ED: I don\u2019t love him but good luck Kyle! At least you\u2019re better than that a**hole Mathias.)*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The night was getting longer, but Bill Remmer hadn\u2019t returned yet.Leyla sat drowsily on a porch chair, waiting for him since she couldn\u2019t think of any more domestic chores to focus on. Uncle Bill\u2019s vacant chair felt so big today in a strange kind of way.Was there a mishap of any sort?The alarming notion that passed Leyla\u2019s mind made her spring to her feet. One day, she recalled reading an article in the newspaper about a rail accident. Trains, in addition to carriages and cars, often engaged in a variety of incidents.Which train was it?Leyla circled around the yard\u00a0and plucked up her courage to head towards the mansion\u2019s gate by the time the sun plummeted. It had become a path she couldn\u2019t cross in the last few days due to her fear of encountering the Duke.For every step she took, Leyla kept thinking of Uncle Bill. She did have a propensity of assuming the worst since she was a little girl. The unhappiness of a like-a-clay-pigeon person was harrowing. So she believed, if she had just the barest of preparations, at least, she would be able to accept the ill-fortune\u00a0without becoming too overwhelmed.Leyla braced herself for the unhappiness that would follow after her relatives stared at her with displeasure in their eyes.Don\u2019t cry even if you get hit.You\u2019ll hear harsh words, but don\u2019t get hurt.I should be polite and brave even when I\u2019m getting kicked out.I\u2019ll try to smile brighter on my way to another house next time.Her efforts had been fruitful. Leyla was less hurt and able to smile a little better. The misfortunes seemed to follow her like straw in the wind, but she was able to bear them with ease, because she had steeled herself, ready for everything.But, she was having qualms when it came to Uncle Bill.\u201cUncle\u2026.\u201dCalling his name, she passed the entrance to the mansion.Uncle Bill was not the type of person to leave her behind.\u00a0Undoubtedly, he would return.But if he didn\u2019t, then\u2026\u201cPlease come back\u2026.\u201dLeyla put her hands together like she was praying.\u201cDon\u2019t leave me alone\u2026\u201dThe picture of her from yesterday, which had calmly soothed the man who had been frightened about leaving her for four days, now had dissipated, replaced by her own worry.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u2018Mom, where are you going?\u2019Leyla innocently inquired of her mother when she gave her candy in a pretty glass jar for the first time in her life. That day, her mother was as lovely as the sweets she was holding.\u2018Far away.\u2019Her mother had been looking at her for quite some time, as she replied in a word.\u2018Then, are you coming home late?\u2019Leyla asked again, impatiently, since she was eager to taste the candy.\u2018Yes.\u2019\u2018How late?\u2019\u2018Very late.\u2019\u2018You\u2019re coming home before I finish eating this, right?\u2019Leyla shook the glass jar full of colorful candies and her mother languidly nodded\u2018Yes\u2019Again, she gave a short reply.\u2018I will.\u2019*\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have left me such an answer if you\u2019re going to forsake me.\u201dHer mother was reputed to be too beautiful to exist as the wife of a poor man. She had eventually fled, leaving behind her husband and daughter as if she were discarding her ill-fitting clothes.In keeping with the grapevines, she had become a high nobility\u2019s mistress or married a silk-stocking merchant, and emigrated to another country.People enjoyed overblown and twisted rumors like these which often soon withered. The only thing left was a man abandoned by his beautiful wife and a neglected young daughter, let alone such a cruel reality.Thenceforth, her loving father became an alcoholic and bedrinked every day. He didn\u2019t want to see Leyla\u2019s face any longer, because it was hard for him to look at someone who reminded him of his truant-wife.Leyla cherished her candies as she awaited her mother\u2019s homecoming. By the time the bottom of the pretty glass bottle was exposed, she realized that her mother would never return. But she didn\u2019t want to accept that painful truth. That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t eat the last piece of her candy.She ate that last candy for dinner only after she was left all alone in the world.Her father, whose health was ruined by alcohol, at a later time passed away due to sickness.\u2018Was it a foreshadowing of his departure and last farewell? \u2018Her father, who had ignored his daughter for years, smiled at her on\u00a0the day he died.\u2018Let\u2019s go to the park together when the flowers bloom, Leyla.\u2019Her father whispered in a lifeless voice.\u00a0But, after he departed that evening, his words only became a vain will.\u201cDon\u2019t leave any promises if you\u2019re leaving.\u201dLeyla was orphaned in an empty house. Her relatives couldn\u2019t figure out what to do with the troublesome child, so they deserted her for a time. It seemed as if they were gawking at her. There was nothing left for her save the empty words of a worthless promise and a solitary piece of candy that provided little comfort.Even after all these years, Leyla still remembered the color of that candy. A glossy blue luster of confectionery that glistened much like crystal.A few days later, on the day when there was nothing else left to eat, Leyla ended up eating the last candy. When she nibbled on it hard, some of the shattered candy shards scraped her fragile gum and the tender skin of her taste buds.Her mouth was bleeding, but Leyla went on munching on the crunchy candy. Tears streamed down her eyes as she ate it. Her sadness tasted so sweet, like biting into a luscious candy but with a fishy aftertaste.There was a shower of blooms outside the window, ornamenting the scene with spots of dappled sunlight. It was an afternoon in early spring when the wafting pale pink flower petals in the breeze looked like falling flakes of snow on a fresh layer of grass.*\u201c\u2026 Uncle?!\u201dLeyla\u2019s eyes went wide with surprise on her walk along Platanus Road.\u201cUncle!\u201dA dazzling smile flourished over her face.\u201cUncle! Uncle Bill!\u201dLeyla ran toward Bill Remmer, who was crossing the road from the opposite side.At the same time when a black limousine transporting the duke entered the Platanus roadway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She let her long, loose blonde hair whip around by the wind following her springing footsteps.Matthias clenched his hand slightly. He was about to tell the driver to slow down the car, but eventually, he changed his mind and merely scoped a glance at her running towards a middle-aged man who was none other than Bill Remmer.Leyla leapt with light steps into the gardener\u2019s arms like a winged bird, and the gardener caught her in a bear hug. She appeared like a little girl in his big arms and smiled so widely as if it were the brightest smile in the world and seeing that the gardener burst into laughter.At that moment, the car whizzed past them. Matthias left his gaze from the window and peered down onto his hands. From that slightly raised hand, he still could feel her touch and the lingering smell of her body on that day.The engagement was soon, around the corner.By the time Matthias felt alleviated by that verity, the car had passed through the gate of the Arvis mansion.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla\u2019s wish came true.Everything was back to being fine after Uncle Bill\u2019s return.Her adolescent sadness, the unpleasant memories of her horrible first kiss, all of her bewilderment and despair wound down as she was no longer alone.In the meantime, the morning and evening weather grew chillier. The days wore down, and the Arvis manor began to have a more stately jubilant atmosphere than it ever had in the past.\u201cOh, don\u2019t even mention it, I\u2019ll serve all the greatest cuisine in the world.\u201d Madam Mona, who had barely made it to the forest, kicked up a rumpus with a straight face. She leaned leisurely on a chair next to Bill Remmer and began to bleat in earnest. \u201cI\u2019m already scared to think how grand their wedding would be if their engagement ceremony is so ritzy like this.\u201dLeyla had just returned from milking the goats and greeted her with a cheerful smile.\u201cWait a little longer, Leyla. Tomorrow I will make your mouth water until you\u2019re sick of it. Regardless of how many guests are invited, they won\u2019t be able to finish half of the food I will cook.\u201dLeyla unconsciously clutched the tip of her blouse at Madam Mona\u2019s hearty laugh. The hickeys sowed by the duke on her neck were still painfully obvious even after a few days. The red marks which showed in the mirror every time she looked in it made her feel ashamed and disgusted.\u201cIs the engagement ceremony already tomorrow?\u201d\u201cPlease, don\u2019t use the word \u2018already\u2019 Leyla. I hope that\u2026..no, I\u2019m simply hoping for a quick ending to this engagement ceremony.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s tomorrow\u2026\u201d Leyla muttered quietly, then smiled again. \u201cYes, auntie. I will wait for it.\u201dShe sought to grin more brightly as if to erase her nightmare-like memory. Ever since that day, the duke had never once set his foot in the forest. Pleased to state, it was a glee for Leyla to know that.\u201cI like chocolate cookies. And raspberry cake too!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bring you a bulk of chocolate or raspberries.\u201d\u201cHow can I repay you?\u201d asked Leyla.\u201cRepay? Just eat a lot and grow up well.\u201d\u201cDo I have to grow up to be as big as Uncle Bill?\u201d\u201cOh my God, Leyla. You\u2019ll be single for life if you grow up to his size.\u201dMadam Mona giggled as she rose from her seat and waved goodbye. Bill Remmer furrowed his brows, but later he tardily joined in the mirth.Not long after she left, the usual night dawned at the cottage.After having supper with her uncle, Leyla tidied the house and reopened the textbook she had overlooked till now. She opted to sleep for a little while as drowsiness engulfed her. But by the time she awoke, the sunup had already begun to appear; and the Duke\u2019s engagement day was already here.Leyla put on her glasses from the desk and rubbed her sleepy eyes before strolling up to the window. She flung the window wide, letting the cold morning air flood in.The wee hours of the morning drew near and the sky was dyed with a clear, transparent tint of blue. Leyla reared up her eyes-the hue of the azure sky today reminded her of the colour of her last piece of candy.The duke\u2019s eyes were also blue, similar to the shade of that candy\u2019s.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Claudine picked a pastel pink dress for her red-letter day. Donned in a gown garlanded with chiffon on top of the silk, her figure was so graceful and stunning as the event\u2019s protagonist.\u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous, Claudine!\u201d Countess Brandt cheered in jollies as she watched her daughter. Her face was etched with awed looks, akin to those of the Brandt\u2019s maid, who stood in the rear of the room.Claudine smiled sweetly to show her gratitude for the honeyed flattery that had been bestowed upon her. Even at this moment, the spark of pride and satisfaction in her eyes didn\u2019t wear off after seeing her reflection in the mirror.It was Claudine\u2019s idea, holding the engagement ceremony at the Arvis manor. Aside from wanting to show respect for the Herhardt family, Claudine wanted to assure through dint of her presence that she was gonna be the Arvis\u2019s next duchess.\u201cMarie, is she still not here?\u201d Claudine turned slightly and asked the maid as she wondered.\u201cShe should have arrived by this time\u2026 Oh, look over there! She\u2019s coming from the garden!\u201dThe maid hurriedly exclaimed and\u00a0Countess Brandt creased her brows as she looked out of the window.Leyla Lewellin was seen ascending the marble staircase bridging the rose garden to the mansion, carrying a basket of flowers in her hands.\u201cGoodness me, Claudine! Did you bring her in again?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mom.\u201d Claudine calmly lulled her mother. \u201cI merely need flower ornaments in my hair to make them look nice.\u201d\u201cIs there a reason why it had to be her?\u201d\u201cWell, there is no specific reason.\u201dClaudine shrugged her shoulders, then stepped in front of the mirror once again.\u00a0Her face reflected in the mirror was no longer smiling.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to get flowers and congrats from an old friend.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The Arvis house was wrapped up in a festive excitement as the Duke Herhardt\u2019s residence readied to greet the guests who would be in attendance for the engagement party later in the afternoon.Leyla plodded\u00a0\u00a0the passageway behind the mansion designed for servants to enter.\u00a0Her feet shook nervously numerous times as she was treading on a floor that sparkled like a clear mirror.Claudine had sent a maid to the cottage to call her in. Leyla immediately knew the moment she was told to pick roses to decorate her hair.It wasn\u2019t a matter of flowers that Lady Brandt wanted to meet her for.Leyla began to slow her pace down as she neared the east side of the fourth floor. It was a guest bedroom where Claudine was staying in. Her hand, which was holding the basket, stood out pallid. Her heart felt as if it would pound out of her chest and her lips were feeling parched.\u2018No.\u2019Leyla mumbled, convincing herself.\u2018It\u2019s merely an unfortunate accident.\u00a0\u00a0The duke would also think the same. So it\u2019s fine.\u00a0There\u2019s nothing to be scared of.\u2019While she was hesitating, trying to make up her mind, Leyla had already set her foot in front of Claudine\u2019s bedroom. She knocked on the door and it began to slide open slowly.\u201cHello, miss. I\u2019ve brought you the roses you had asked for.\u201dLeyla greeted her with politeness like she usually did. She had brought Claudine a bouquet of roses in the colour pink, which matched the shade of the dress she was attiring for today\u2019s occasion.Claudine approached Leyla with a wide smile. \u201cHow do I look? Do I look good?\u201d\u201cYes, miss. You look beautiful.\u201dLeyla answered wholeheartedly. She would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t. Claudine\u2019s beauty today was undeniably as beautiful as a blooming rose.\u201cBefore, I was very anxious, but now that you have said so, I feel relieved. Do you think Duke Herhardt will think the same too ?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dThe duke\u2019s name that came out suddenly from Claudine\u2019s mouth made her flinch..\u201cI\u2019m sure, he will.\u201dA faint tremor was noticeable in her voice.Leyla felt woefully pathetic, as if she were a child who had done something wrong. Their\u00a0kiss was an unpleasant incident, but\u00a0she couldn\u2019t rule out her feeling of guilt as if\u00a0she had become a shameless thief who stole Claudine\u2019s fiance.Leyla he could see that her pride she had puffed up and toiled for in front of Claudine for so many years had been shattered, making her look shabby at this given time.Claudine gave a sideways glimpse at a maid to accept the rose basket. And, as if it were a natural thing, she gave out a handful of gold coins to Leyla. The amount of money she gifted to her today was more than usual. Unknowing it just served to wound Leyla\u2019s heart even more gravely.\u201cWhat are you doing? Why aren\u2019t you showing your gratitude?\u201dThe frowning maid rebuked her.Leyla quickly bowed her head while tightly gripping the money in her hand. She\u00a0didn\u2019t feel insulted bowing down to Claudine\u00a0as she had repeated this stance countless times since she was a child and had been used to it.\u201cThank you, miss.\u201dThankfully, Leyla was able to convey her thanks calmly. Claudine, who had been staring at her with a deadpan face, soon regained her bright smile. \u201cNo problem. Instead, I should be the one to say thanks, Leyla. Thanks to you, this engagement ceremony will turn out to be perfect.\u201dClaudine turned around as she was done with the talk.Leyla gasped a big sigh and rushed out of the room in a headlong dash. What was buzzing around inside her head right now was the urge to get out of this uncomfortable and unfamiliar place as quickly as possible but she couldn\u2019t act in a reckless manner inside the mansion.She neatened her clothes and organized her flower basket first before walking down the corridor meant for workers at the quickest possible speed.She was about to walk through the passageway\u2019s entry door when a surprise caught her. Just as she was about to turn the corner, she crossed the path with the duke who had come up the stairs.\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve been doing Lady Brandt\u2019s errands, Leyla.\u201dButler Hessen, who stood behind the duke, spoke with a gracious smile.Leyla greeted him back politely and scurried back to the side of the corridor. She only wanted to go ahead, but the duke stopped still and lowered his gaze on her.Her cheek blushed. She bent her head even deeper as she dared not to make eye contact with him.\u00a0It was just eye contact, but her heart was erratically pounding.\u00a0While the duke looked fine, as if he couldn\u2019t care any less. It seemed he had forgotten everything that had happened between them.\u2018How foolish of me. How could my heart throb in snatches of a man like him?\u2019The duke walked past her just as she wanted to run away unmannerly. Only after she could no longer hear the stomping of his shoe-steps did Leyla dare to move her feet and leave the mansion.After completing her errands, Leyla returned to her daily routine.As the evening drew near, the guests invited to the engagement party began to flock to manor. In contrast with the rollicking mansion, the little cottage loomed peacefully deep in the forest as if it had been sojourned in another world.There, Leyla lived her life diligently.She weeded the garden and cleaned the goat pen. Continued by cooking a stew for dinner and folded up the sun-dried laundry stocked in the hamper.After all of her house chores were finished,\u00a0 Leyla took a leisurely walk in the forest to get a thrill of nature. She was enjoying her stroll before long she realized she had arrived at the riverside.Leyla clambered her favourite beautiful tree to watch the evening scenery laid bare on a windless summer day. The awe-inspiring view surrounded her; birds were soaring above the sky, the red-tinged Schulter river drenched in light by the setting sun, and a white swan-like annex floating on it, all of which led to greater beauty of the scene.It was a millions worth sight to see. Her eyes were drawn to all of those beautiful things.As the sun set, a few thin strips of the cloud on the horizon turned shimmering gold. The clear darkness of early nightfall settled over the sky like the blue candy she remembered from her childhood.The thought came to her.The Duke\u2019s eyes were likewise the same as those colours.\u201cYour blue eyes are the same as the color of my sadness.\u201dLeyla laughed a little as she somehow was feeling\u00a0dejected. Then suddenly, she sensed someone\u2019s presence approaching her.\u201cKyle!\u201dLeyla shouted with delight when\u00a0a familiar face standing underneath the tree.\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d\u201cYou like taking a stroll on a summer evening, when you go out for evening walks you always go to this river.\u201dKyle\u2019s playfulness had disappeared, and his eyes were deeper and gentler than they had ever been. Leyla observed him quietly,\u00a0his gaze towards her felt a little strange.The wind was sighing through the river. The sound of the leaves rustling in the treetops and the boughs moaning breached the silence that had been created between them.\u201cLeyla.\u201dKyle opened his lips after a while.Leyla replied by tilting her head a little as she waited for him to speak.\u201cLet\u2019s get married.\u201dThose overly unrealistic words were torn asunder on a gentle evening breeze. Leyla was dreamingly dazed in disbelief, but now Kyle said it once again. This time with a more serious tone.\u201cLet\u2019s get married, Leyla.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2727 Let\u2019s Get Married \u2727The spring season came a little earlier in Ratz, the capital of the Berg Empire, which was located in the southernmost province of Carlsbar. Arvis estate was starting to bear buds as May came, but the whole city of Ratz was already awash with the sweet scent of roses.Matthias had a sudden glimpse of thought over the changing of the season while passing through the gardens of the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace. He suddenly halted in his steps, and the other officers who were trailing from behind stopped as well.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Matthias answered short, \u201cNothing.\u201d He smiled a little, the tip of his lips lifting.The brief silence broke after Matthias got his stride back. The young aristocratic guard officers continued to converse playfully. Their faces and voices glowed with excitement while discussing how to spend this fine spring weekend and roughly met with a very similar conclusion altogether.Party. Horse racing. Alternatively, having a spring date with a lover.\u201cOur Captain will leave his fiance\u00e9 and spend a lonely spring.\u201dThe horde of officers giggled in a bunch when one of their peers cracked a joke. Matthias just casually grinned and gave a faint chuckle in response to his men\u2019s jesting.The engagement ceremony between Duke Herhardt and Lady Brandt, which was hosted at the end of last summer, took place successfully. Over several weeks, the couple who had been officially betrothed had become a hot topic of buzz within the society.However, Matthias didn\u2019t feel much of a change from his everyday life. A week after his engagement, he was assigned to the Berg\u2019s army garrison and had to leave for the capital the day after. Meanwhile, Claudine, who had been staying in Arvis estate, returned to the Brandt\u2019s estate, which was situated in the center of Carlsbar, a metropolis that was a long distance away from the capital city of Ratz.So, nothing had changed from their previous mode of living, except for the fact that their engagement had been made public. During the social season, Claudine stayed at the mansion the Brandt\u2019s had in Ratz for a while. It was nothing new for her, however, since she had been a regular visitor to the estate on a seasonal basis for quite some time before then. Aside from that, they also attended the social events together, as they always did in the past.Everything else basically remained the same, except that they now had a definite official status as each other\u2019s fianc\u00e9es, which was the only thing that had altered in their life.\u201cI\u2019m about to finish my military service soon. What about you, Matthias?\u201dA fellow officer who was strolling alongside him posed a question that drew everyone\u2019s attention to Matthias.\u201cCurrently, I\u2019m thinking about extending it for another year.\u201dAs soon as he said that, those around him seemed to be taken aback by his surprising answer.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to get married and focus on the family business?\u201d\u201cThe wedding? Maybe next year.\u201d\u201cIs it because the hot dish over Duke Herhardt\u2019s marriage has eased in social circles? So you want to postpone the wedding?\u201dMatthias flicked his chin instead of answering. Rather than calling it a postponement, things went that way naturally like it was supposed to. He intended to stay in the capital for another year. At the same time, the Brandt\u2019s wished for their daughter to spend her honeymoon in Arvis with her husband.When the Brandt\u2019s first requested for the engagement to be tabled for one more year, the Herhardt family consented without hesitation.Given her young age, there was no pressing need for Claudine to get betrothed so soon. And more than anything else, both families yearned for this marriage to be perfect from the beginning.After leaving the Imperial Palace, Matthias didn\u2019t waste any time returning to his home.In terms of age, the old brick mansion, which was located in the heart of Ratz, was the second-oldest building among the Herhardt family\u2019s properties after the Arvis mansion on their estate. That mansion served as the family\u2019s headquarters for generations, during the time they were responsible for the capital\u2019s work. The architecture of the house was more modest and classic compared to the Arvis manor, which epitomized the aesthetic tastes of the hostesses.\u201cThe two madams are here,\u201d reported the servant as he approached Matthias, who had just got out of the car.\u201cMy mother and grandmother?\u201d\u201cYes, the madams arrived this morning. They said, \u201cthey came here to attend the forthcoming wedding of Her Majesty the Crown Princess.\u201dMatthias nodded his head and slowly entered the mansion.The princess, whose pride had been crushed after being pushed out and losing the seat of the Duchess Herhardt\u2019s, was eager to find another running mate so that she could proceed with the wedding ceremony as she planned. Thereafter, the title of her spouse fell to the Grand Duke of a nearby duchy with the same social standing as the Herhardt\u2019s.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Matthias!\u201dCatharina von Herhardt, waiting for Matthias to enter the foyer, greeted him with a bright smile and wide opened arms.\u201cSon, we can see your face only when we come here like this.\u201dWhile his mother Elysee, stayed the same as always; her approach towards her only son was more straightforward.Matthias approached the two with a warm smile on his face. It was another Saturday afternoon, as much as every other day. Just like the brimming garden of blossoming roses during the early season of spring.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThe weather this evening is so nice, Leyla.\u201dKyle walked up to her with a jolly face after parking his bike. Leyla, who was busy helping Bill clean his cart in the garden, quickly turned her head towards the voice, so did Bill, who was holding a shovel.\u201cLet\u2019s get married.\u201dKyle shouted.After hearing it over and over again, his marriage proposal no longer came as a surprise and it sounded more like a daily morning greeting these days. After having taken a slight pause for a moment, Leyla and Bill nonchalantly returned to their work.\u201cHello, Kyle.\u201dLeyla greeted him brightly as she carried whatever was leftover of the planted seedlings.\u201cI\u2019m not getting married.\u201dLeyla spoke in a friendly tone afterward, emphasizing her firm rejection of his proposal.Sigh.Bill heaved a sigh. He seemed to be feeling the pain of Kyle\u2019s broken heart. But in contrast, Kyle appeared unfazed by Leyla\u2019s constant rejection. He just smiled gently and volunteered to help her without being asked.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll accept your rejection today. I\u2019ll ask you again tomorrow, then.\u201d\u201cEnough. Don\u2019t ask anymore.\u201d\u201cNo, I will keep asking. A person\u2019s minds is bound to change.\u201dWith the way he was behaving, it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that Kyle\u2019s shameless and stubborn spirit was maybe the toughest in the whole Berg empire.Bill tried to maintain a straight face as he looked at Kyle and Leyla while struggling to stifle his laughter.***Kyle Etman began to propose in the late summer, and stuck to his guns until the seasons changed several times.When Bill first found out that Kyle had proposed to Leyla, he believed it was most likely due to one of the two possible causes. Either that kid was drunk, considering he couldn\u2019t drink well, or he was insane. That\u2019s why Bill didn\u2019t smack him in the head with the shovel after all. But the following day, Kyle showed up again with a very sane face and repeated the same thing.\u2018How many times has it been since then?\u2019Kyle stopped by the cottage without missing a day throughout fall, winter, and even this spring, saying the same thing every time. Only to be rejected on every one of those visits.At first, Bill was cheering for Leyla since she was so staunch, but he began to feel sorry for Kyle and his plight as time went on. If it weren\u2019t for his father, Bill would have been excessively vocal with Kyle to get him to stop his doing. Bill, however, opted not to speak more since Dr. Etman had granted his son a green-light.\u2018How about sending Leyla off to college?\u2019Said Dr. Etman when he paid a visit to Bill at his cottage last fall.Bill\u2019s heart suddenly slumped like a dreary chimney pot. Even if he wished Leyla could pursue her study to a higher level, his current circumstances, in which he was forced to live from hand to mouth, prevented him from doing so. When he replied hesitatingly, \u2018I can\u2019t afford it.\u2019 Dr. Etman\u2019s face was lit up with a smile. He continued.\u2018If our children have feelings for each other and want to become a couple, it would be good to get them married and send them to college together.\u2019Bill stared blankly at the doctor in stupefaction. He couldn\u2019t believe what he had heard, though he was thrilled with the offer.To him, Leyla was the most wonderful child in the world. Yet, he soon realized that the rest of the world had its own set of standards that he couldn\u2019t grasp. One of those was regarding the Etman family\u2019s social standing in Carlsbar society, something about which he had been entirely clueless up until today.Dr. Etman seemed to understand his befuddlement, so therefore, he spoke first.\u2018Kyle said that Leyla is the one person who could bring out the best in him, so he wants to live by her side as a decent person for her.\u2019Bill was reasonably surprised, as he learned that the young boy who spent most of his time lounging lazily in his cottage and stuffing his stomach with free food had said something like that to his father.\u2018It was a very sincere thought that came from youngsters who are still in their adolescence.\u2019\u2018But Doctor, Leyla is\u2026.\u2019Bill clammed up, but Dr. Etman\u2019s expression grew kinder.\u2018I don\u2019t require his future bride to come from a wealthy family or have a perfect upbringing, because I know that Leyla is a good child even if she doesn\u2019t have such privileges.\u2019He said so with a smiling face that resembled that of his son.\u2018If Kyle doesn\u2019t change his mind till he decides on his career path next year, I\u2019d like to allow them to be together. How about you, Mr. Remmer?\u2019Deep down in his heart, Bill Remmer was on a cloud nine and felt grateful that he was willing to carry Dr. Etman-whom he regarded to be an angel in human form- on his back and run across the Carlsbar or even the whole Berg Empire. It didn\u2019t matter how tired his physical state was; Bill would be able to endure it every time he pictured Leyla\u2019s happy face in front of him.Those were his true feelings.Kyle\u2019s stupid proposal may have ended up being a blessing in disguise for Leyla.Bill tossed the shovel into the warehouse as he had made up his mind to do something about this matter.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cOh, Matthias. You know Dr. Etman\u2019s son, don\u2019t you?Elysee von Herhardt lowered her voice a smidgeon amid a boring talk on the princess\u2019s nuptials. It was just the two of them at the spacious dining table, savoring their blue-plate dinner since Catharina had gone to bed early that night.\u201cYes, mother.\u201d Matthias nodded calmly, putting down the glass of water from which he had taken a sip on the table. \u201cKyle Etman. Dr. Etman\u2019s only son.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. That kid, Kyle, he\u2019s getting married.\u201dHer voice sounded keen. It was a hint that the woman who became Kyle\u2019s Etman\u2019s companion was an unwelcome figure. But Matthias remained quiet, patiently waiting for his mother to finish her story.\u201cShe\u2019s an orphan raised by our gardener, if I\u2019m not mistaken, her name is Leyla.\u201d\u2018Leyla.\u2019Matthias muttered, with no sound flowing from his lips.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me that she will satisfy the criteria of the Etmans as their prospective daughter-in-law.\u201dHis throat felt a little tight when he heard his mother mention her name.\u201cIt\u2019s amusing, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Matthias then came up with a bland retort. \u201cSadly, all of Grandmother\u2019s efforts to find him a good mate have been in vain.\u201dHis voice was a bit taut for some reason.Matthias didn\u2019t give a further response, but Elysee enthusiastically recounted Kyle Etman\u2019s marriage story, which had been garnering a lot of snooping in the Arvis estate these days.Mrs. Etman was teed off with Kyle\u2019s decision to marry Leyla since she had been striving for years to get a title from her in-law\u2019s family, which now she was unable to get because of her son\u2019s choice. However, it seemed that she was actually put on the spot in the face of her husband and son\u2019s wishes.If all went according to plan, rumors said that Leyla would marry the doctor\u2019s son and continue her education. After they went for their honeymoon in Ratz, they would attend college together.After the upcoming summer passed. Shortly after the season of roses.\u201cGrandmother must be heartbroken. She eally adores Dr. Etman\u2019s son.\u201d\u201cYeah. She must be.\u201d Matthias put down his cutlery and grabbed a napery on the table with his alabaster hand.\u201cI feel so sorry for Mrs. Etman. She was a respectable doctor\u2019s wife, much more so than them, who were nobles in status. But she lost her hard-earned social standing because of a ridiculous daughter-in-law.\u201d Elysee took a sip of wine to moisten her lips. \u201cWhat kind of noble would want to befriend a wife who takes a lowlife orphan as her daughter-in-law?\u201d\u201cThe situation may change.\u201dMatthias straightened his posture and turned to face his mother.\u201cBecause they\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\u201cWell, Matthias, if things could be changed, Mrs. Etman wouldn\u2019t have been so depressed like this. As you know, Dr. Etman is a persistent person and above all, Kyle is completely smitten with that orphan child.\u201dElysee flicked her tongue, expressing her sympathies for the doctor\u2019s wife, who was about to-be-shunned by society as of now.\u201cShe\u2019s a remarkably pretty girl. It was a troublesome reason why her son couldn\u2019t get away from her.\u201dWhen she rang the bell, the waiting maids started to serve the dessert on the table.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that girl was able to take over Mrs. Etman\u2019s position in such a blatant way. She\u2019s a real freak. No, should I say she\u2019s smart?\u201d Elysee shrugged her shoulders lightly and slid her dessert fork into her mouth. \u201cActually, it\u2019s absurd to place the blame on her alone. The most foolish is Mrs. Etman\u2019s son, who got blinded by a girl and brought disgrace upon his whole family.\u201dAfter she was satisfied with schmoozing and reaching her desired conclusion, Elysee von Herhardt finally changed the topic of her talk.Now, she was back to bring up the topic of her social life, which included a slew of well-known and uninteresting names.Matthias, on the other hand, stayed deafeningly quiet while listening to her drone on.\u2018Leyla.\u2019That name lingered on the tip of his tongue, like the sip\u2019s taste of wine that had left a sweet mark on him.Leyla.Leyla Lewellin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For that reason, the Ratz garden was landscaped modestly to add-on to the mansion\u2019s austere style of architecture.Once the spring season arrived and the roses of different varieties imported from Arvis were in full bloom, the flower beds transformed the drab gardens into a site that was well worth seeing.When the scent of flowers\u00a0began to linger in\u00a0the blowing wind, Matthias had a passing thought about returning to the estate for the summer break.Before suddenly, the shadow of a girl who had been diligently wandering about the garden, helping the gardener, snapped him out of his reverie.Leyla.Matthias unwittingly frowned.That girl smelled like a rose.A gardener with a natural aptitude for growing roses had painstakingly succeeded in blossoming one of the most beautiful roses in the world.But he never thought\u00a0the precious rose the gardener raised in the woods would soon become his misfortune.Leyla, the nobody girl.That was the name that had been embedded in her.Matthias closed the window and turned around.\u00a0\u00a0Droplets of water\u00a0from his wet hair\u00a0sprinkled over his feet.\u2018Still, didn\u2019t fortune favour her now?\u2019Someone like Leyla Lewellin could only dream of having a companion like a doctor\u2019s son.She was blessed with once-in-a-lifetime great luck. Thanks to Kyle Etman\u2019s foolish naivety, she could become the future Mrs Etman and attend college in the nation\u2019s capital.\u201c\u2026Leyla.\u201dMatthias made a hushed mention of her name beneath his breath. He mused for a beat.Perhaps, if that beautiful thing disappeared from his sight, things might turn out better for him as well.Assuming this was true, he should give her a bigger round of applause for the marriage more than anyone else.Even when he closed the window, the smell of roses still lingered on the tip of his nose.Matthias spotted a vase of roses that had been put on the console table. Someone seemed to have plucked the roses that had bloomed in the garden and placed them in his bedroom.After passing by the vase,\u00a0his gaze was rested on the golden cage he had brought along with him to Ratz\u00a0\u00a0and then turned towards the vase again.\u201cLeyla.\u201dHer name sounded even sweeter when he said it with more clarity.\u201cThe roses have bloomed but you\u2019re not here.\u201dMeanwhile, he was lost in his musings; Matthias suddenly snatched the coveted roses from the vase and clasped them firmly with his hand.The memories of Leyla, who had tears pouring down her face, flooded back into his mind. The pale pink roses reminded him of her sobbing cheeks, which were dripping wet with tears.Matthias\u2019 grip on the rose gradually became tighter and tighter until the flower was crushed to a jumble of petals in his palms.\u2018It\u2019s a good thing.\u2019He conscientiously believed so.\u2018But\u2026\u2019Matthias\u2019 eyes narrowed slowly.\u2018Can there be a season where the roses bloom without you there?\u2019\u2018The flowers will blossom, and I will return, but why aren\u2019t you there with me?\u2019In those questions, Matthias revived a memory that he wasn\u2019t even aware he had.That the child was always there.In the rose-filled summer garden, as if she had become an inseparable part of Arvis itself.Which means she was also a part of him.His little yellow bird chirped when it couldn\u2019t fly after he cut its wing off. Matthias now felt a strong urge to kill a person for the first time in his life at this point.It was unclear which one of them, whether it was the doctor\u2019s son?\u2026.or that woman.It wasn\u2019t until the night had gotten dim when Matthias released the petals that became a hard lump.\u00a0His rose-scented hand reached out and took one of the papers on the table and tore it into shreds.It was a document required to be submitted by the end of the following week.An eligibility document to extent one year service as a military officer.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI wholeheartedly give my approval.\u201dBill strenuously broached his long hesitated words.Sitting across the table, Leyla was gazing at him with a perplexed face.\u201cThat glutton, Kyle.\u00a0I agree. You have my blessing.\u201d\u201cHey, uncle\u2026\u201dLeyla frowned. But Bill kept running his mouth off.\u201cStop rejecting him now.\u00a0Marry him and go to college. I really want you to do that, Leyla.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you like Kyle, too?\u201d\u201cI do, it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to marry him.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by it makes no sense? What\u2019s so strange about two people liking each other and getting married.\u201dBill choked up, but Leyla\u2019s eyes were fixed on him and didn\u2019t budge.\u201cKyle and his family will become everybody\u2019s fool because of me.\u201d\u201cDr. Etman has allowed it, too.\u201d\u201cBut \u2026.\u201d\u201cLeyla, stop thinking about this and that and just look into your heart.\u201d Bill raised the tone of his voice.\u00a0\u201cIf you like Kyle, get married, but if you don\u2019t like him, then don\u2019t. You don\u2019t need to think about anything else.\u201dLeyla blinked her eyes shut at his words and took a big gulp of the beer before her.Bill quietly watched her. The child he had nurtured had now grown into a great drinker. Now, they were each other\u2019s best drinking buddies. Ones who could share their woes while sipping a pint of beer together.\u201cI like Kyle. There\u2019s no other friend in the world who is as comfortable, warm and kind as him.\u201dLeyla wiped the beer\u2019s froth from the corner of her lips as she eyed Bill even more sternly.\u201cSo, I don\u2019t want to bring shame on him.\u201d\u201cNo, what\u2019s wrong with you, Leyla? Why are you looking down on yourself?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. Uncle, I like the person I\u2019ve become. No matter what other people think of me, I\u2019ve never been embarrassed of who I am. All I want to do is be a good and responsible adult, much like you wish for.\u201dLeyla knitted her brows. Her eyes clouded over with somberness\u00a0beyond her glasses.\u201cBut, uncle, I\u2019m completely clueless when it comes to marriage. If I were to get married right now, it would mean that all of my efforts have been in vain.\u201d\u201cHa. I hope you\u2019re not possibly thinking of spending all your life stuck in this cabin\u00a0old widower for the rest of your life, Leyla.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d love to. I don\u2019t want to leave this Arvis forest, uncle. And neither do you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible thing to say.\u201d\u201cNow that I have a teaching certification, I\u2019m going to get a job at a school nearby. And I want to live like this forever. Living here, together with you, uncle. Maybe I can help you, too.\u201d\u201cIs this forest going to run?\u00a0It\u2019s going nowhere.\u00a0\u00a0And I\u2019m always going to be here in this forest.\u00a0Well, maybe someday when I\u2019m getting older and don\u2019t have the stamina to continue working as a gardener, I\u2019ll resign and leave this place. However, I\u2019m still healthy, and I\u2019ll still be in good shape for the next ten years as well.\u201dBill gulped down his beer.\u201cLeyla, whether you leave here, go to college, get married, wherever you are, whatever you do, you will always be my little Leyla.\u201dBill reached out and gently squeezed Leyla\u2019s tiny hand on the table.The college entrance exam was just around the corner, but Leyla still had no signs of changing her mind. Bill was so frustrated, that he had decided to arrange this talk with her today.\u201cIf you get married to the Etman household, you\u2019ll be living in the neighborhood, there\u2019s nothing better than that.\u201d\u201cUncle.\u201d\u201cLeyla, there\u2019s a very rare kind of man in the world. A man who assured me that he would be a good husband and a good father. And Kyle is the kind of man who fits that bill.\u201dAs he smiled, Bill patted the back of Leyla\u2019s hand with his palm.\u201cThink about this. I hope you get married to a nice guy and build a real family. Make your home a hive of life, filled with the sound of children laughing. I believe Kyle will never let you be lonely.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 We\u2019re an actual family too.\u201dLeyla, who was fiddling with Bill\u2019s fingers, raised her head.The corners of her eyes were red\u201cUncle, we are also a family. A real one.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What\u2019s that\u2026 \u2026 ?\u201dSince she came from Lovita, this hapless child had carried tear sacs full of sadness with her. Bill\u2019s eyes would sometimes heat up and get teary when he looked at her.\u201cIf you think we\u2019re a real family, you should listen to me even more!\u201dBill yelled and dropped an envelope he had prepared in advance in front of Leyla.Immediately upon receiving and opening the envelope, Leyla\u2019s eyes widened. Inside the envelope was a train ticket to Ratz with a sum of money to cover travel costs.\u201cThe test is next week. Study hard from tomorrow. \u00a0You always work hard, but you still have to work harder to pass. If you don\u2019t go to Latz, then I\u2019ll consider us as a fake family.\u201d\u201cUncle!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t take the entrance exam, I won\u2019t see you again, Leyla.\u201dBill had let go of her hand and sat with his shoulders straight.\u00a0He stared down at her with a severe look. Albeit, his eyes were endlessly warm, with no hint of a threatening expression in them at all.Leyla was lost in thought with the envelope in her hand.Bill looked at her deeply, wholeheartedly, at the figure of a bright and lovely child before his eyes, things that for him hadn\u2019t changed and had remained the same since she was a little kid.After contemplating for quite some time, Leyla ultimately made a difficult choice.She stuck her sparkling glass of beer in front of Bill with a still severe expression on her face.As she had done in the old days, drawing on her pupilage when she tried\u00a0tried to bump her glass of apple juice into Bill\u2019s glass of beer.Bill gladly bumped his glass against hers.Leyla downed the beer all in one go and drained the glass entirely of its contents. Her cheeks quickly began to flush, but she remained steadfast in her pretence of being a good drinker.\u201cEven though we\u2019re apart, we\u2019re still a real family, right?\u201dThat smothering question came close to bringing tears to Bill\u2019s eyes all over again.\u201cDon\u2019t be worried about that.\u201dUnlike his blunt way of speaking,\u00a0\u00a0Bill smiled so warmly at her.Leyla smiled as she watched him still.They were like a genuine family.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYou will definitely like it the most. The museum of natural history.\u201dKyle once again spoke excitedly.\u201cIt\u2019ll probably be like heaven for you.\u201dHe was listing out the must-see places in Ratz and was most excited when he began to talk about the Natural History Museum.Outside the window of the rattling train they were riding, a breathtakingly beautiful sight of springtime landscapes with flowers in full bloom greeted them everywhere.This was Leyla\u2019s first visit to Ratz, and she couldn\u2019t have been thrilled.But for Kyle, it was the umpteenth time since he often visited his relatives in the capital and thus was quite familiar with the city.Kyle had meant for Leyla to stay at\u00a0his relative\u2019s house, but she politely refused his offer and opted to stay at a small hotel nearby.\u201cYou must be tired right now. Shall we go tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI have to study for the exam.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to studying, what is the difference between studying now and studying later before the exam day? You just need to make sure you memorize what you\u2019ve learned.\u201d\u201cWow. You look very confident, Mr. Etman.\u201d\u201cOf course I am, Miss Lewellin.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cSo then, let\u2019s get married.\u201dInstead of hurling her rejection at him like in the past, Leyla set her gaze intensely on Kyle\u2019s face. Her sudden shift in reaction made Kyle startled a bit.\u201cW-why, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cYou know, Kyle. Can you imagine it?\u201d\u201cImagine what?\u201d\u201cWe are married to each other and become husband and wife.\u201dThe moment Leyla stated it with a serious expression, Kyle\u2019s cheeks began to burn crimson.\u201cOf course! You can imagine it! Go ahead, do whatever you want!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It strikes me as a bit weird.\u00a0Us getting married, having children\u2026 You know, getting into that type of relationship.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying now? It\u2019s not weird at all.\u201d\u201cReally? We\u2019ve learned about the act of reproduction, haven\u2019t we? How to make and give birth to a baby, are we really going to do that?\u201d\u201cMake\u2026 Birth, what?\u201dKyle doubted his ears.\u00a0He felt like he had misheard something improper,\u00a0\u00a0but Leyla, the person who threw the bomb words, precisely had an innocent face with not a trace of shamelessness on it.\u201cAct of reproduction.\u201dLeyla hurled a bomb for the second time without even batting an eye.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of, Kyle. Birds, flowers, and all other living things do it to preserve their species.\u201d\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re saying right now?\u201cYeah. I\u2019m only a little weak in geometry, but I am pretty good at other subjects.\u201dKyle\u2019s throat tightened, and he turned head sideways to avoid staring straight ahead. He was embarrassed when Leyla seemed so proud of herself after uttering all that saucy stuff.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit weird for us that we\u2019re going to do that, and\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cuh\u2026 \u2026 Leyla, come on, eat this.\u201d Kyle quickly slipped a slice of sandwich between Leyla\u2019s talkative lips to cease her babbling.Though it wasn\u2019t yet summer, the temperature within the train, for some reason, was as scorching as if he were inside a kiln.Leyla munched on the sandwich with relish. In between bites of the sandwich, she mumbled and opened her lips again.\u201cEat this too.\u201dBefore she could say anything, Kyle had already shoved another cookie into her mouth, clamming her up from speaking further.\u2018Please, don\u2019t say that stuff anymore.\u2019Kyle sucked in everything he wanted to say and just shook his head.( \u2018When you start thinking of shit, think about my shovel.\u2019 )Uncle Bill\u2019s voice suddenly rang out in his ears.He greeted Kyle with a very kind and creepy smile when he came to the cottage to pick up Leyla this morning.\u2018Yes, shovel.\u2019Kyle\u2019s thoughts wandered back to Uncle Bill\u2019s giant dirt shovel, which looked close to a weapon.\u201cSo Kyle, I mean\u2026..\u201dLeyla\u2019s lips began to twitch open once again as soon as she finished all the cookies. Her look was a mess yet lovely, with cookie crumbs smeared all over her dainty red lips.\u201cLeyla, if you say one more word.\u201dKyle sighed and scratched the back of his head.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIf you say one more word\u2026\u201dHe gulped.After digesting his feelings that had been stifled by the shovel, Kyle made a tragic confession.\u201cI\u2019m going to jump off the train.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Matthias remained still. His countenance was quite ample.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m losing a capable officer. Well, it would be a greater loss for this Empire if Duke Herhardt were to continue serving in the army with his competencies. However, speaking from the standpoint of a soldier, I\u2019m a little upset.\u201dHe said. The sense of disappointment and loss in his eyes was earnest, given that they were in a formal military relationship as superior and subordinate.Captain Herhardt, his most trusted underling, who was due to remain in the service for another year, had unexpectedly changed his mind. Imagined his surprise when a paper was delivered to his desk. Instead of the document to extend his service period, a letter of resignation was sent to him. It was his wish that Matthias would stay, but Colonel Farrell had no reason to detain him since the grounds for his appeal, as stated in the letter, was none other than his grandmother, the Duchess of Herhardt.\u201cThank you for all this time.\u201dMatthias thanked him politely.He always showed due respect for his superiors even though the Duke of Herhardt was a considerably higher-ranking nobleman based on social status.His attitude was markedly different from that of other aristocratic officials, who were often unable to differentiate between public and private affairs.Colonel Farrell admired Matthias for that.Secondly, if considering his meritorious service to the empire, his first task by selecting the frontline, a problematic area of the outpost, was noteworthy.\u201cMake sure to visit me when you come to Ratz.\u201dMatthias was more than glad to comply with the colonel\u2019s request for a farewell handshake.\u201cYes, Colonel.\u201dHe shook his superior\u2019s hand firmly and exited through the colonel\u2019s office door, having been entirely freed of his duties.The outpouring of the spring sunshine drifted across a clear blue sky welcoming his steps once he walked out onto the street.Matthias got into his car and drove toward Ratz\u2019s downtown. He had to go to several places to meet with some of his other superiors. It was only after then, the farewell activities for his retirement, which had been rolling on for several days, were finally brought to an end.When he was about to walk up to his waiting vehicle, something went by and halted him in his tracks. Matthias turned his eyes towards the end of the road across the street. Over there, came to his sight a figure he used to know.Leyla.A woman who turned out to be none other than Leyla Lewellin was walking the road leisurely along the promenade at the downtown area.\u201cMaster.\u201dThe driver approached him as he stood still and didn\u2019t get into the car.\u201cGo back first.\u201dMatthias ordered him while keeping his gaze fixed on the opposite side of the road.\u2018It\u2019s Leyla. No way, she couldn\u2019t possibly be here. \u2018Straightaway, with broad strides, he got across the road.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The museum she visited was huge.Leyla looked around in amazement at the magnificent building of the Berg Empire Natural History Museum, the same way she did on her first day setting foot in this place.The day after arriving at Ratz city, Kyle took Leyla on her first visit to this place. The Art History Museum and the Natural History Museum, which sat across the street, opposite to each other, and were said to be places of Ratz\u2019s greatest pride.Leyla had grown used to the grandeur of Carlsbar city, which was reputed to be on par with the splendor of the capital. But she remained so mesmerized by the architectural wonders that lined the streets of Ratz every time she passed through them.The girls at her school who toured the capital often gushed about how beautiful the Art History Museum was. Still, Leyla unhesitatingly chose the Natural History Museum to be named the owner of the most beautiful architecture.As Kyle described it, the museum was like a piece of heaven on earth for her. All she could think about was how vast the museum was and how impossible it seemed to be for her to explore every corner of the building in just a single day.Leyla was eager to devote her entire day exploring this place to the fullest extent possible. She also had planned to empty her schedule on the last day to come here once again before leaving Ratz city. Hopefully, she would be able to view the whole of the museum\u2019s collection and accomplish her mission.Having finally made up her mind, Leyla was raring to go and walked into the museum foyer with a spring in her step.Literally, Kyle wished to accompany her today, but Leyla shunned his goodwill. Unlike her, who had completed her exam the day before, he was just getting started with his exam tomorrow morning.Though Kyle was full of confidence in his brains and had studied in advance, Leyla didn\u2019t want to bring him here for sightseeing just one day before the exam.Before entering the exhibition hall, Leyla once again double-checked her outfit, making sure there was not a single hair out of place.\u2018Comfortable shoes, checked.\u2019\u2018Notebook and pen, checked.\u2019\u2018Stamina in full, I\u2019m ready to go.\u2019After drawing out a notebook and pen from her bag, Leyla stepped into the viewing gallery, which she hadn\u2019t had a chance to see on the first day of her arrival.***Leyla Lewellin today was just like a child at a picnic.Matthias stood at a safe distance away, quietly watching her as she strode through several spacious exhibit galleries without a trace of tiredness devouring her.Matthias was already convinced that the woman\u2019s back he saw going inside the Natural History Museum belonged to Leyla, so he quietly followed her while keeping his distance.Curiosity got the better of him, leaving him wondering what the hell she was up to.?But soon after seeing what she was doing, Matthias was willing to wait and keep a closer eye on her.As he waited, Matthias suddenly remainded about the college entrance exam that took place\u00a0 in the capital around this time. Seeing that she had traveled to the capital city to take the test, Matthias concluded that she had decided to continue her study at the college. So was her marriage to Kyle Etman as well.Leyla was standing in front of a glass display case containing various plant specimens, diligently penning things down in her notebook. Sometimes, her lips were tinged with a smile, and her face took on a jolly beam as if she was looking at a precious jewel. Matthias was hard to believe that a mere plant sample could elicit such a giggle from her face.In the end, Matthias decided to stalk her a bit further, but he didn\u2019t go any closer since he knew her joy would perish whenever she saw him.Matthias folded his hands behind his back and slowly trailed in her footsteps at the same pace.He hadn\u2019t seen her since last summer, and Leyla didn\u2019t seem to have changed much since then. Even yet, there was only a slight changeover in her delicate appearance from before.Her face had become slimmer, her expression looked more gentle, and every movement of her body appeared more graceful as time went on. Donning a lace-embellished white dress, Leyla seemed more mature than she was before.After she had been there long enough, Leyla left the herbarium exhibition room and abruptly stopped for a while in front of the passage leading to the next gallery.Matthias was able to figure out what had piqued her attention.The passageway that ran between the two exhibition rooms was conjured up in such a way and incarnated like a heavenly place. The branches, painted with silvery hue, were decorated with white feathers and garland hanging like leaves.As the light trickled in through the window glass, the colorful bird-shaped crystal ornaments draping all over the branches reflected its rays. They created a dreamlike atmosphere to the eye, reminiscent of a fairy tale realm, enhancing the magical beauty of the space even more.\u201cGosh\u2014.\u201dLeyla\u2019s naive admiration came to his attention.Matthias couldn\u2019t keep a smile off his face as he watched her run about with such abandon. Her wavy blonde hair and the hem of her dress bounced with her as she sprinted excitedly inside the area like a little girl at a playground.In the middle of that beautiful passage, Leyla halted her steps.She stretched out her hand towards the branches, but her fingertips were unable to grasp the bird-shaped ornament.Leyla was still staring up at the ceiling gazing in awe, when Matthias sauntered and walked straight off to her side.Before she had a chance to realize his presence, Matthias already grabbed her by the waist and lifted her body off the ground.Leyla jolted in surprise when she floated into the air. She turned her head, and a crystal bird, which had previously been beyond her reach, was now right in front of her eyes.She felt like she could fly like a bird in the spring and go anywhere. As if she were dreaming with her eyes open.It was strange, but breathaking moment.Matthias dropped her down to the floor and acted as if nothing had happened.The hem of her voluminous, puffy white dress slid down her calves and caressed her skin softly on the inside.Leyla raised her head and hid her hand that had touched the crystal bird behind her back.Matthias slowly took off his officer\u2019s hat. His pairs of blue eyes, bluer than the sky at the end of the summer, were fixed on her with a dazzling vividity.***Below the museum\u2019s dome was a little cafe selling refreshments where visitors could rest and refuel their stomachs. Leyla and Kyle had already had lunch at that place when they came on the first day of their visit.Matthias took the lead in heading there. Knowing the meaning, Leyla stood still, a scowl on her face.\u201cIt was nice to meet you, duke. I\u2019m going to take my leave now.\u201dAt her words, Matthias turned around. Leyla steeled herself, bowed her head in greeting, and began to walk to the other way.\u201cThere.\u201dHe commanded.She refused to comply and took a few more steps, but at the end she failed to escape.Matthias had passed by her and blocked her way.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dLeyla looked around her and asked sharply. Some passersby narrowed their eyes, staring at them in a bit of wonder.\u201cI hate it.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Someone like you, I hate it.\u201dMatthias\u2019 arrogant attitude suddenly drove her up a wall.\u201cYou can\u2019t be like this to me.\u201d Leyla clasped the straps of her bag, which she was carrying over her shoulders. Her hands trembling nervously,\u201cI-I mean\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want to do something that we shouldn\u2019t do?\u201dA smile teased the corner of his lips as he stated it in a somewhat sarcastic tone. For a short moment, a maddening rush swept through Leyla\u2019s body and knitted her brows in disbelief.\u201cNo!\u201dBoth of her hands began to shake fiercely after Matthias made such offensive remarks,\u201cNever!\u201dA sharp feeling of heat seared Leyla\u2019s cheeks. Her face became blazing red as she seethed with rage. The humiliation Matthias piled on her had trodden on her toes. Mainly because how aloof and arrogant he was when he said so.After a few moments of looking around his surroundings, Matthias returned his gaze to her.\u201cI want to buy a cup of tea for an orphan who lives on my estate I happened to meet while in the capital city. What\u2019s wrong with me being kindness?\u201dHis attitude consistently unabashed even when he said something disrespectful.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201dMatthias spoke coldly. His face lost its grin.\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Leyla?\u201dEnding his question that he had answered himself, Matthias slithered his way to the cafe.Leyla let out a long, weak sigh as she looked at his back.Though she didn\u2019t know Duke Herhard very well, she now knew one crucial aspect about him:achieving everything he desired at whatever cost. The more challenging something was to get, the more valuable it was to own.That man always had to get what he wanted.Giving up, Leyla walked behind the duke with heaviness in her stride.***They were sitting across from each other.Shortly after the take-out order was made, the waiter brought two cups of steaming hot coffee to their table. The teacup billowed a cloud of white smoke, which rose into the air; had been laid between the two people who were appearing to be silent.\u201cI never thought I\u2019d meet you by coincidence in a place like this.\u201dLayla opened the conversation with some trepidation. She was feeling awkward with the stillness between them, so she decided to speak up first.\u201cIn the natural history museum\u2026do you\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201dMatthias cut her words, taking a sip of his coffee.\u201cYou already know it, Leyla.\u201dA smirk hung on the corner of his lips. \u201cI have absolutely no interest in these kinds of things.\u201d\u201cThen why you\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou already know it\u2019s not a coincidence.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dLeyla replied reflexively. Her whole body grew tense, and her heart began to beat in a blue funk. She would rather be an impoverished orphan who would get pity from him. She didn\u2019t want to be seen as \u2018something\u2019 else by this man in any way.\u201cAll I know is\u2026\u201dThe sound of her voice was a bundle in nerves, and Leyla gulped back her agitation for a moment.\u201cAll I know is just that, you hate me.\u201dLeyla closed her eyes as if she were trying to erase the horrifying memories of their first kiss that suddenly dawned on her. But it was to no avail. Once she blinked her eyes to see, Matthias\u2019 blue eyes were still fixed on her, and those memories flooded back in, anchoring her to the nightmare once again.\u201cRight, I hate you.\u201dMatthias assented her words with ease. A smile bloomed on his face.\u201cNow, I terribly hate you, Leyla.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he looked at her with a cold glint in his eyes, Leyla felt her heart leap into her mouth.\u201cI\u2019ll leave then.\u201dAs she spoke, Leyla dipped her gaze into the teacup in front of her, utterly disregarding his presence.\u201c\u2026 Pardon?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be staying there anymore. I\u2019ll leave and won\u2019t be a bother in your estate.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cAnywhere.\u201dShe clenched her fist which began to shiver, together with the chill she felt. Don\u2019t be scared\u2013 Leyla reassured herself, though she knew it was a fool\u2019s errand.\u201cArvis isn\u2019t the only place in this world where I can make a home for myself.\u201dHer words lost none of their venoms, spewing a thorn as sharp as the blow he spat to her. But Matthias simply gave her the cold shoulder, taking her grumbling as a passing whim.Leyla wanted to flee from her seat and get out of there as soon as possible, but what happened last summer\u2014the day she lost her hat and fell into a freezing river because she refused to eat what he offered her, had presented itself in her mind and pinned her feet firmly in place.She didn\u2019t want to go through that trauma all over again.As she set her sight on the teacup, Leyla sipped her hot coffee in a hurry. She almost choked, but Leyla managed to finish it in one gulp, until the teacup revealed its bottom. Then, she sucked in a long breath to calm herself.\u201cLeyla.\u201d sibilated Matthias, pointing at her.Lelya stiffened and hurriedly took out the money from her purse and put it on the table\u2019s edge.Matthias scoffed, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s money to pay for the coffee I drank.\u201d Leyla opened her lips and struggled to get the words out. Her gaze remained affixed on his finger.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m the kind of person who needs someone like you to pay for a cup of coffee?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but I don\u2019t want to receive anything from you.\u201dWith that phrase, Leyla felt a chill run down her spine. The trembling began anew as her hands became soaked with cold sweat, and her fingers turned a paler hue. Still, her inquisitiveness won against her, in the end.Because this place wasn\u2019t Arvis, where Leyla Lewellin used to live the life of a poor orphan under his world.\u201cLift your head.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cLift your head, Leyla.\u201d\u201cStop bossing me around.\u201dThe mounting exasperation tightened her throat. She looked daggers at Matthias with a blaze of indignation burning furiously in her eyes.\u201cI am not your maid.\u201dA sudden rush of reckless courage had obliterated the ripples of dread that had been roiling within her for some time, heating her response.\u201cMaid?\u201d\u201cI was obviously raised by Uncle Bill in Arvis, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m your maid.\u201d\u201cIs that so? What are you, then?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m a nobody.\u201dThe corner of her eyes faintly flushed\u201cI have been and will always be.\u201dA sharp pain seared through her feelings right at the moment. Her emerald eyes were moist with tears as she glowered at Matthias. But even so, she still got a hold of him and even ventured to confront him.Matthias just held his coffee cup\u2019s handle wordlessly. He mused about the day he wished to strangle Leyla Lewellin, and he longed to do so again right now.The sweltering heat of a late summer day afternoon; when he felt as filthy as his messed-up clothes after rolling around on the dirt ground. When he went ballistic at the acts of a mere worthless woman.What if I had strangled you then\u2026In his mind, Matthias concluded that what he felt at the time wasn\u2019t quite as bad as what he was presently feeling. Right now, he felt like a freak. The feeling of being carried away by an inexplicable desire and compulsive obsession over a no-name woman disgusted him the most.Matthias took the money that she had left on the table and rose from his seat. Then, he dropped it one by one onto her lap.\u201cTake it.\u201dLeyla glowered at him. Taking in her eyes, which turned a livid red, Matthias threw some of his gold coins down her skirt. \u201cAnd this, too.\u201d\u201cW-what are you\u2026\u201d\u201cThank-you; is what you should say, Leyla.\u201dMatthias scoffed in ridicule.\u201cSimilar to how you receive Claudine\u2019s money. With gratitude. With courtesy.Leyla\u2019s eyes blurred as he snickered, but she wouldn\u2019t let her tears fall. She twitched her lips to counter his severity, yet words slinked and slid off her tongue.\u201cI\u2019ve taken away your time, even though you\u2019re not my maid, so I\u2019ll pay you your labor fee.\u201dA great tremor now overtook her. Leyla gritted her teeth, but hot torrents of grief already coursed down her face.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, simply think of it as my sympathy for the poor orphan.\u201dTears began to tickle her cheek. Deep emotions stirred with no other outlet but through her long-lasting sobs dripping down like a piece of jewelry.\u201cHow silly, you bootlick a guy who wants to marry you out of pity and it\u2019s amusing to watch how you build your self-esteem so high just for a few little coins.\u201d / You bootlick a guy who wants to marry you out of pity, yet you wish to sustain your pride for a few coins. How amusing.Matthias\u2019 sneer was like an invisible thread that pulled her over. Leyla gallantly scowled at him, but her total disgruntlement had already converted into tears that continued to rain down her cheeks like a river leaving a dam.Matthias walked out of the cafe with a satisfied smile plastered on his face.Leyla Lewellin was a woman who never once smiled in his presence, but she was also the woman who, whenever he came into contact with her, would break down and cry uncontrollably.If I can\u2019t make you smile, then I will make you cry.Her laughter or tears, Matthias loved her in all of her manifestations. If he only could give her pain, he would hurt her as deeply as he could.At the very least, you wouldn\u2019t see me as a tiny blot in your life.Before leaving the cafe, Matthias turned around and gave her face a good stare. Leyla wiped her cheek every few second as she cried; her glasses laid on the table\u2019s edge.Matthias made a wish as his long strides slowly brought him to leave the Natural History Museum.May Leyla soon marry the doctor\u2019s son, and disappear from my world.And may the tears and wounds I had sculpted, last forever in her memory.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The sun had already drowned itself on the west skysill, but Leyla hadn\u2019t returned to her hotel yet.Kyle, looking for Leyla at her hotel to have dinner with her, exited the lobby with a worried face. Though she was a little kid no longer, this city was a stranger to her; bad people might be clustered everywhere.\u201cWell, she has no fear, but still\u2026..\u201dKyle took a hesitant stride along the street. His mind was racing faster than his feet. He had assumed she would be at the museum, but it had already closed by the time he had arrived. The search for her had taken him all across town, but Leyla was nowhere to be seen.Is she lost?Kyle darted past people, buildings, and trees.If not, has she met a bad guy?Kyle wanted to bury all of the negative thoughts that had crossed his head; he didn\u2019t even want to consider the possibility.It was then that he found her.Leyla stood before a fountain in the park square at the end of the museum street and dubiously threw a coin towards the statue of the water fountain.\u201cLeyla!\u201dHer eyes naturally moved towards the direction of the voice that was calling her name.\u201cUh, Kyle?\u201dLeyla seemed befuddled as if she had no idea that she had scared someone out of his wits.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dKyle approached her, brushing the sweat-drenched hair from his forehead.\u201cKyle, why are you here? How about your exam preparations?\u201d\u201cDoes it matter right now? You really\u2026 Seriously, you\u2026.\u201dKyle grabbed her shoulder. He slowly drew a breath and let it back out with a loud sigh. It wasn\u2019t long before his daunting gasps calmed down a little.\u201cAre you alright? Would you like to have a seat?\u201d Leyla asked; her eyes were drawn to his face with worry.\u2018Who cares about who now?\u2019Kyle clasped his heated palms over Leyla\u2019s face and heaved a long sigh that sounded more like a mournful laugh. It was then that he noticed that her eyes had swelled and reddened a bit.\u201cLeyla, are you crying?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201dLeyla answered his question in such a hurry as if she had run out of words, which only made Kyle even more sure that she had been crying.\u201cWhy did you cry?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWho made you cry?\u201d\u201cNo one, it\u2019s nothing like that,\u201d Leyla smiled and gently pushed his hand away. \u201cI just, uh, looked around the museum. Took a walk in the park and made a wish.\u201d\u201cWish?\u201d\u201cYeah. I saw everyone doing it.\u201dLeyla gestured with her finger toward the fountain in the middle of the park. People with bright smiles on their faces were throwing their coins into the fountain and making wishes.\u201cI also made a wish for you to get into medical school.\u201d\u201cAre you sure you threw it accurately?\u201dKyle began to chuckle as he pointed to the water bowl the statue was holding. The disappointed moans of those who failed to throw their coins into the pot resounded across the throng.\u201cOf course I made it,\u201d said Leyla with a proud smile on her face, \u201cI\u2019m really good at this thing.\u201d\u201cI know, I can already imagine it.\u201d\u201cIt is already dinner time. Are you hungry? Let\u2019s make one more wish before we go.\u201dLeyla made a beeline for the fountain, holding a shiny gold coin in her hand. Kyle, to her surprise, obediently trod on his heels from behind.\u201cLeyla! Do you seriously want to throw your gold coins there? To that fountain? A penny-pincher like you?\u201dIn lieu of responding, Leyla pitched the coin with all her might. Unluckily for her, the gold coin hit the edge of the bowl and bounced off towards another side. She gasped and frowned, dismay enveloping her face.\u201cLeyla, are you really good at this?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you believe me? I successfully threw all of my coins in one fell swoop just now!\u201d\u201cJust how many gold coins did you throw, huh?\u201d Kyle asked in a giggle at her slipshod feat that wasn\u2019t like her at all.\u201cOkay. Since I\u2019ve already given a big donation to the Ratz\u2019s fountain today, I\u2019ll toss in one more coin.\u201d\u201cAre you going to throw another one? That\u2019s enough! Don\u2019t do it!\u201dKyle snatched the coin from Leyla\u2019s grasp, leaving her to scowl and lunge for his hand in annoyance. \u201cIt must be spent!\u201d\u201cYou may say that, but how many gold coins have you already thrown in there?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the value of money.\u201d\u201cIs there money that needs to be wasted for nothing like this?\u201d\u201cThere is!\u201d Layla shrieked.\u201cEnough! Don\u2019t throw any more money. It\u2019s a waste. If you want to squander money, let\u2019s go and get some ice cream.\u201d\u201cYou really do look like Leyla Lewellin when you say that.\u201d\u201cWhatever.\u201d Kyle shrugged his shoulders and put the coin back into his pocket. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe knew Leyla would reject his hand, but Kyle still extended his to her. Leyla lightly clapped his hand and seized the lead by taking a small step ahead of him.Kyle was moving quickly to catch up with her\u201cHey, what did you wish for?\u201d\u201cI wished for Uncle Bill\u2019s well-being and happiness. Then for you to get into college and become a good doctor. And I wished to be a decent grownup. That\u2019s all of the wishes I had for us.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s the last one?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cThe last wish of your failed attempt.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dLeyla\u2019s face suddenly grew sour.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d She abruptly shook her head in disgust and widened her stride.Kyle just chuckled cheerfully, his face lighted up with interest.\u201cLet\u2019s get something delicious to eat, shall we? I\u2019ve been frantically running around searching for you, and now I\u2019m starving to death.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Dr. Etman heaved a sigh before he opened the bedroom door.When he switched on the light, he saw that his wife was already lying on the bed. She had been like this ever since Kyle and Leyla had left for Ratz to take their exams.\u201cDear, dinner is ready. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mind me.\u201dHer voice sounded icy, which contrasted with her lackluster appearance.\u201cI understand how you feel, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo. You don\u2019t. The generous and benevolent Dr. Etman would never understand.\u201dHer eyes were ablaze with anger.\u201cBut dear, you also like Leyla, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes. I know. Leyla is a good girl. If it weren\u2019t for you and Kyle, I would have continued to like her.\u201d\u201cMarrying Kyle won\u2019t change Leyla, dear. It\u2019s just that Kyle will marry that good girl that he truly loves.\u201d\u201cYou might think of me as an exorbitant snob, but marriage is a reality. This marriage is degrading our son, and you\u2019re allowing it to happen!\u201d\u201cDear, the world will keep changing. Someone\u2019s social status will soon become an outmoded value.\u201dMrs. Etman arranged her long, flowing hair into a bun and pulled it up neatly before getting out of bed. She stared at her husband with an upset face; she didn\u2019t exactly look like someone who had been starving for days.\u201cIn a world where people live, social status won\u2019t disappear. Even if the title is no longer in use, something else will separate society\u2019s social classes in the future.\u201d\u201cDear\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd whatever the standards are, the fact that Leyla is not a good fit for our Kyle will never change. Ever.\u201dRounding off the talk with those bitter words, Mrs. Etman walked past her husband.Dr. Etman watched his wife\u2019s back, who had left towards the garden, and smiled faintly to the maid, who was standing there looking confused.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Becker. Please clean the dinner table.\u201dWith a sigh, Dr. Etman followed his wife into the unlit garden at this hour of the night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kyle was keen on staying with her though she had told him to hurry back and prepare for tomorrow\u2019s exam.\u201cI need to digest the food first so I can properly prepare for tomorrow\u2019s test.\u201dLeyla belted up, unable to come up with a retort to his confident reasoning.\u201cLet\u2019s walk for a bit then,\u201d she said, \u201cbut Kyle\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to marry me?\u201dLeyla asked cautiously. The aftertaste of cold, sweet ice cream smeared on her lips.\u201cIf you\u2019re just doing it out of pity\u2026.\u201d\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dKyle cut her off, calling her name firmly, and stepped in front of Leyla, who was a little startled by his frigid voice.\u201cDo you see me as the kind of crazy guy who marries someone out of sympathy?\u201dHis unfamiliar expression made Leyla freeze in her tracks, and she fell silent.\u201cWell, the world is wide. There might be a lot of crazy people who marry for such reasons, but I\u2019m not one of them.\u201dKyle eased the air out of his lungs slowly, letting his temper settle.\u201cDo you know why? It\u2019s because I love you.\u201d\u201cKyle\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my only reason. Because I love Leyla Lewellin.\u201dAs he looked down at Leyla\u2019s cocked eyebrow, Kyle sighed and then chuckled. \u201cWho do you think is more pitiful? Me, who\u2019s been rejected hundreds of times or you? I\u2019m the sadder one, Leyla.\u201dKyle said as he began to ruffle Leyla\u2019s hair and moved a step ahead. He didn\u2019t want Leyla to see what expression he was making right now, which must have been pretty silly.As if she knew what he was going through, Leyla followed him from behind, creating some distance between them.After travelling home shackled in deafening silence, the two finally arrived in front of the hotel.\u201cGo in,\u201d Kyle told her. With a smile on his face, he added, \u201cOh, I forgot, I haven\u2019t done it today.\u201dHe slowly lifted his eyes after staring down at the cup of melting ice cream in his hand. He had remembered something.\u201cLeyla, let\u2019s get married.\u201dThe turndown was already flashing before his very eyes, though. Yet Kyle felt a little weird skipping it now since Leyla\u2019s rejection had become something of a daily routine for him.For some reason, today, Leyla, who was accustomed to rejecting his proposal with a nonchalant shrug, was unusually quiet.Kyle looked at her with his eyes narrowed as he studied her attentively. \u201cI\u2019m not getting married,\u201d He readied to hear such a sweet but heartless response that was supposed to come from her slowly parted lips. But instead, her response was something beyond his wildest dreams.\u201cMm.\u201d\u201c\u2026Leyla?\u201dKyle jolted in surprise. The ice cream cup he was holding fell to the ground, soiling the tip of his shoe.The words failed him. He was in a conundrum at her straightforward reply.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026 So, do you agree to marry me?\u201dAs he made sure, Leyla lowered her head and nodded.\u201cYou want to marry, right? Me?\u201dHe repeated the question in a shaky voice. Leyla glimpsed at him sheepishly and nodded her head slightly once more.She was momentarily at a loss for words. But Kyle was already screaming in delight as he held her by the shoulders.\u201cWoohooooooo!\u201dTheir shindig floored guests at the hotel who happened to pass by stared at them. Kyle didn\u2019t seem to care even though Leyla let out her scream when he spun her around.It was a beautiful spring night.A gentle wind was lulling the city back to its slumber.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*That night Kyle had a dream.He dreamed of marrying Leyla and living their everyday life in complete bliss as an Etman couple.Leyla once said to him; having her own house with a small flower bed was her long-held dream. She smiled shyly and voiced her happiness. She wished the roses she had planted in the garden were all blooming beautifully.In his dream, he saw Leyla diligently tending to that very flower garden. The little child who was running alongside her was more lovely than a blossoming rose.The sun shone brilliantly, and the child\u2019s laughter was brimming with glee.\u2018Daddy\u2014!\u2019The child who saw him quickly came running. She was a pretty little girl who looked a lot like Leyla with her blonde hair. The child, still a toddler, jumped on his feet and welcomed him with her eyes sparkling.The whiff of air caressed him as he walked to her with their lovely daughter in his arms. The scent of sweet roses borne by the fluttering wind faintly tickled the tip of his nose in a pleasant way.Leyla laughed as her eyes held his a moment longer. Her smile was so beautiful, perhaps even more beautiful than his beautiful dream had been.In the fading remnants of his dream, Kyle awakened with the phosphenes still in his eyes. Thanks to that feeling of happiness, he performed much better than he expected on the exam.He couldn\u2019t believe it.Will his dream soon come true?Is there such a thing as a beautiful blessing in this world greater than that?Once he stepped out of the exam hall, Kyle had the feeling that he could leap to great heights in the sky. His footfall seemed to have wings, he felt free like a bird just leaving its nest the moment he spotted Leyla sitting on a bench outside, waiting for him.\u201cLeyla!\u201dLeyla raised her head at his shout. She folded the small notebook she was reading and put it back into her sling bag.\u201cHow was the test?\u201d She approached him blithely. \u201cWas it hard? Did you do well?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re always worried about everything.\u201d Kyle tucked his chin up as though he were flaunting. \u201cI\u2019m Kyle Etman. I don\u2019t know how to get second place in studies.\u201d\u201cOh, hahaha. You did great, then.\u201dLeyla hooted with laughter.\u201cI forgot how smart Mr. Etman was for a moment.\u201d\u201cWow. That makes me very sad to hear. Make sure you keep it in your mind from now on.\u201dKyle suddenly grabbed her hand. Leyla didn\u2019t wave his hand away though his touch took her by surprise.While she was looking at him, the late afternoon spring sunlight in dazzling crimson gold glowed on the corner of his lips as he gave a gentle smile back to her.\u201cAre you sure you did well on the exam?\u201d asked Leyla carefully, as she looked like she couldn\u2019t shake off her trepidation.Kyle grinned at her after seeing how adorable she was. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t fail the exam, so there won\u2019t be anything bad that may prevent us from attending college together.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2026.\u201dLeyla\u2019s cheeks were flushed with rosy pink. The moment he caught the sight of her adorable, sweet ripe-peach face, Kyle\u2019s heart began to skip a beat erratically. He regretted that they were at the exam location presently. If they had been on an empty street, Kyle would have mustered up his guts to kiss her right at this moment.\u2018No.\u2019\u2018If I do that for no reason, Leyla will get scared, so I\u2019d better wait for a little bit longer.\u2019One of his thoughts wandered back to the shovel, which he had forgotten about. The giant shovel full of dirt, and Uncle Bill\u2019s alarming smile.The two slowly hiked around the campus, with hands intertwined tightly. Walking from the medical facility where Kyle would study as a doctor, then to the biology hall where Leyla would be enrolling in the future. They laughed and chatted excitedly and had a great time along the way.\u201cYou will definitely pass, but it may be a bit difficult for me.\u201dLeyla muttered with a serious face as she reached the biology faculty building.\u201cWhy are you worried about that? Didn\u2019t you do well on your exams?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but only a few female students took the exam earlier.\u201dHer countenance became more gloomy as the talk continued.Kyle nodded his head, \u201cAh\u2026 that\u2019s right.\u201d He momentarily sighed a little.It had only been a few years ago since women were allowed to pursue higher education at the same level as the men in the Empire\u2019s universities. Due to the rigorous selection process, only a few students could pass since the threshold for college admission test scores was much higher for female students.\u201cStill, I\u2019m sure you will pass.\u201dKyle spoke with confidence.\u201cIf you don\u2019t pass, who else will?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re being overconfident?\u201d\u201cNot in the least. This is my opinion based on your grades during your eight years of school.\u201d\u201cEight years\u2026 So much time has passed already.\u201dLeyla could still vividly remember the road she had ridden to Arvis by a mail wagon. Time had passed by in a flash. The well-grown Kyle who was standing before her eyes suddenly felt like a new person.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dKyle, who was a little embarrassed from the deep gaze fixated on him, asked awkwardly.\u201cYou have grown so much.\u201dAmazement reigned in Leyla\u2019s eyes as she stared at him for a moment. Stunned, Kyle was utterly at a loss for what to do as though fluffy feathers were popping from his chest. Leyla Lewellin\u2019s attractiveness didn\u2019t appear to diminish even when she uttered such ridiculous things, leaving him speechless.\u201cUh-huh.\u201dKyle gave a false smile. He took a deep breath and continued,\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve grown up well to be a decent husband. Do you like it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201dLeyla stiffly hastened her stride. Kyle couldn\u2019t stop himself from grinning from ear to ear when he saw her face was daubed with shyness.On their way back, Kyle talked about his pleasant dreams, which would soon become a reality.About the house\u2014how they would live together. Their daily life as husband and wife. And also, their soon-to-be-born, beautiful child in the future.He was keen to write a fresh chapter in the history of the Etman family, along with their offspring.Kyle cherished the look of cautious eagerness that graced her face when he talked about that dream. He was ecstatic to see those hopes and dreams were on the cusp of becoming a reality.It was a rather funny and sentimental thought. But he believed it was the reason why he was born into this world\u2014to make her expectation come true.\u201cHow many children do you want to have?\u201d Kyle asked her, \u201cI wish I had a daughter and a son.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 maybe five?\u201d she answered.\u2018Fi\u2026Five?\u2019\u00a0Kyle stood gaping. The number she said was in contrast to her timid attitude.\u201cWe won\u2019t be lonely if we have so many kids,\u201d Leyla chuckled and continued, \u201cWe can depend on one another. I think it would be great if the house were full of people who resembled one another.\u201dFor some reason, Kyle felt bitter when he saw Leyla say those things with a radiant look. He could tell by gazing at Leyla\u2019s bittersweet smile how long she had lived in loneliness.\u201cFive\u2026 okay, Leyla. I\u2019ll do my best!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dLeyla\u2019s eyes grew round at Kyle\u2019s loud pledge. They looked at each other with blank expressions for a spilt second, then their cheeks blushed nearly at the exact moment.\u201cHey, that\u2019s not what I meant!\u201dKyle took a step back, he had a redder complexion than hers.\u201cI\u2019m not thinking only about that.\u201d\u201cNeither am I!\u201d Leyla snapped back, ashamed by his words.The two quickly released their grip and walked a step apart, not daring to make eye contact. Kyle gave Leyla a sideways look, and the peals of laughter he\u2019d been holding in eventually burst from deep within.\u201cBy the way, Leyla, did you feel ashamed after deciding to have five children?\u201dGasp.\u00a0Leyla turned away. Her brows knitted.\u201cYou didn\u2019t think a stork would give you five babies, did you? Our Miss Lewellin, who is well-versed in all subjects except geometry.\u201dLeyla kept walking, a scowl on her face, disregarding his mischievous teasing. Kyle\u2019s jolly laughter grew louder along with the clacking of her heeled shoes.\u201cOh wait for me, Mrs Etman!\u201dHis jovial cry reverberated across the campus on a sunny spring day.Leyla started to run. Her braided ponytail on the back of her head swung in rhythm with her stomping shoes on the asphalt.Kyle was smitten with the look of her back. Her statuette gave him the feeling of returning to that pleasant dream once again.And he didn\u2019t want to ever wake up.Forever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Duke seemed to take it into account as he couldn\u2019t rule out his grandmother\u2019s request.Oh, whatever.Leyla stretched her apron and laced it tightly around her waist. The matter had nothing to do with her, though. She merely lamented that her bouncing gold coin had hindered her wish from coming true.\u2018Please don\u2019t let me run into Duke Herhardt again.\u2019Leyla fervently prayed as she threw the last gold coin he had given her onto the fountain.Since last summer, after he left Arvis Estate, Matthias hadn\u2019t returned for a single day visit till the end of the year. Leyla thought her prayer had been granted by all means; the peaceful days of her life would last until his military service was over, and she would have already left Arvis by the time he returned home.Leyla fell into a daze for a moment, but soon, she shook her head and walked out towards the backyard. Besides, her wish would likely come true since she would have already left the Arvis forest by the time the Duke arrived back from his trip.With a lighter heart, Leyla started caring for the livestock and tended to the garden diligently. The moment her morning routine was winding down, Phoebe, the mountain pigeon, returned from the Etmans\u2019 house, bringing a letter from Kyle that was attached to its ankle.\u2018My mom wants to invite you to dinner tonight.\u2019\u2018See, Leyla. I was right, huh?\u2019She could hear Kyle\u2019s voice in the letter.After seeing her anxiety, Kyle had reassured her a million times that his mother would like her and that she would be accepted in his family.\u2018Everything will be fine.\u2019 He soothed her. When the autumn dawned, they would become a campus couple and enjoy their college years together happily, very happily.\u201cUncle, I\u2019ll have dinner at Etmans\u2019 house tonight.\u201d Leyla approached Uncle Bill, who had just gotten home from work. \u201cMrs. Etman invited me.\u201d\u201cLook, what did I say before,\u201d said Bill in a raspy voice, reiterating the same thing Kyle had said in the letter. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that everything would be all right?\u201dLooking upon his gleeful face, Leyla also gave a soft smile of her own. Her heart was pounding. She put her faith in his words and was looking forward for tonight\u2019s dinner.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The evening sun had cast long shadows on the ground when Matthias arrived in Arvis manor. The tension didn\u2019t escape the faces of the waiting staff in line when the car transporting him appeared in front of the lobby.Everything was in the groove. He was welcomed with loving arms with courtesies and was given some joyful smiles from the two Duchesses, who were standing next to him.Every time he passed in front of the gardener, Matthias tended to lower his gaze. A little girl in neat brown shoes always stood in line next to the gardener\u2019s big feet, ready to greet him whenever he came home. But Leyla Lewellin, who had always been by Bill Remmer\u2019s side, would no longer be here after the summer season ended.Matthias walked past the gardener without even bothering to look at him. His sight turned back towards the front entrance, where he could see the stairwell in the lobby leading to the manor\u2019s main hall.\u201cOh my, that bird also returned with you.\u201dElysee von Herhardt chuckled the moment she gazed upon the gilded cage that a servant was holding. Inside the cage, there was a little canary that Matthias had brought with him when he departed the Estate last summer.\u201cWhat a very strange thing. How could Matthias, who has never even had a pet dog, take care of a bird?\u201d\u201cIf you have a hobby with birds, why don\u2019t you expand the greenhouse a bit more and bring in different kinds of birds?\u201d suggested Norma with a smile on her face.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Grandma.\u201d Matthias grinned as he said. \u201cOne is enough.\u201dAfter giving a prudent answer, Matthias entered the mansion.Before going up the stairwell, Matthias reared his head and gazed at the huge chandelier for a long, thoughtful moment. Right above it, the insignia of the Herhardt family was emblazoned on its distantly high ceiling.He was born under that crest. He lived beneath that crest, and he would close his eyes under that crest. It was a natural cycle\u2014just as breathing in, just as easy as he was living.Matthias lowered his gaze and started ascending a flight of steps.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cIf he had retired this year, why would he still want to put it off another year?\u201dCountess Brandt grumbled beneath her breath. Her voice was laced with annoyance that she couldn\u2019t keep hidden.The reason she had agreed in the first place to extend her daughter\u2019s engagement period for another year was solely out of respect for Duke Herhard\u2019s choice to serve the Empire. Nonetheless, if she had known what was going to happen, she would have insisted on having the wedding by the end of this summer, no matter what.\u201cI had no idea Matthias was such a fickle guy.\u201d\u201cOur wedding has been postponed,\u201d Claudine passively said, \u201cbut I think it would be better if Duke Herhardt returned to the Estate earlier, mother.\u201d Nothing on her face indicated that she was upset.\u201cYou seem so relaxed. This mother of yours is very worried to see her daughter unable to marry this year.\u201d\u201cIs there any reason to be concerned? It is better to take the time to properly prepare rather than have a wedding that is less than perfect due to hastiness.\u201d\u201cOne year is a long period of time, Claudine. How do you know what might happen within a year?\u201d\u201cThink about last year, mother. A year passed in a flash\u2014and peacefully. We just have to wait one more year. Wedding preparations will also be easier if Duke Herhardt stays on the estate.\u201d\u201cClaudine, men aren\u2019t to be trusted, and engagement isn\u2019t a binding commitment like marriage.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s Matthias von Herhardt, mother.\u201d With a nonchalant face, Claudine added \u201cHe is Duke Herhardt, a man who will never love anyone but himself.\u201dClaudine might as well have been feeling uneasy about her wedding if she hadn\u2019t heard the news that Leyla and the doctor\u2019s son were getting married. But now that Leyla Lewellin was a fly in the ointment no longer, her mother\u2019s worries were nothing more than the elderly\u2019s fuddy-duddy fears.\u201cFor him, this engagement is also a symbol of pride for the Herhardts. There\u2019s no one who can get in the way.\u201dClaudine spoke her thoughts with confidence as she cut and neatened the embroidery thread.The kind yet heartless man.Since childhood, that\u2019s how Matthias was nicknamed. While her other cousins often made fun of Claudine with their snarky jokes, only Matthias remained polite and kind to her. Whereas, his good samaritan attitude also built a barrier between them and made him a difficult man to attract.\u2018Does he even have feelings?\u2019Claudine sometimes wondered about it.It was difficult for her to envision Matthias being angry, sad, or happy.From the beginning of his life to this day, he seemed to look down on the world with his arrogant yet elegant smile. And this Matthias von Herhardt was something Claudine wanted to own.\u201cI should visit Arvis sometime next week.\u201dClaudine rose from the sofa, her mood became a bit lighter.\u201cI want to meet Duke Herhardt and congratulate my friend who is getting married soon. It\u2019s for both of these reasons.\u201d\u201cA friend who\u2019s getting married? Oh my goodness. By \u2018friend\u2019 did you mean the gardener\u2019s orphan?\u201dCountess Brandt gave a fretful moue. Claudine smiled without a hitch to her mother and said,\u201cLeyla is my friend. Of course, I have to give my old friend a wedding present.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla wrapped herself in a white dress she had bought in Ratz after so much consideration when she travelled there to take the exam. Her golden hair was nicely braided, and she adorned the end of her hair with her favourite ribbon.This was not her first visit to the Etman household, but Leyla felt uneasy for some reason. Her insides felt queasy as if this was her first.The thought of her upcoming marriage to Kyle exacerbated her nerves, and the fact that the person who personally invited her was Kyle\u2019s mother further added to her concerns.\u201cUncle, how do I look?\u201dLeyla walked out of her room. She stood in front of Bill and asked with a solemn expression. Bill, who was mellowing out by the opened window with his mouth smoking his cigarette, looked at Leyla and grinned widely.\u201cWooho\u2026 Since you\u2019re going to get married soon, it seems you\u2019re going all-out in dressing up unlike before.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, I\u2019m just really nervous about meeting Mrs. Etman.\u201d\u201cGoodness me! Haven\u2019t you already met Mrs. Etman once or twice before?\u201d\u201cBut today is a special event.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. It won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Bill gave a gentle smile as he stubbed out his cigarette and got up from his seat. \u201cYou just have to be yourself, Leyla. That\u2019s enough.\u201dBill gently patted Leyla\u2019s shoulder. His smiling face felt warm, so did his hand.Leyla smiled. She willingly nodded, even though she knew it was simply his subjective point of view. After a whole day of fretting, she was finally able to relax a little bit. Kyle arrived in the cottage at that moment.\u201cKyle, I\u2026.\u201d\u201cPerfect.\u201dKyle lauded her before Leyla could raise a question.\u201cJust be yourself.\u201d He cracked a smile. His gaze was warm, identical to Uncle Bill\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s all you need, Leyla.\u201d Kyle reassured her.\u201cWell. Someone else had said precisely the same thing as you did.\u201d Leyla giggled as she witnessed two people with the same expression and said say very similar the exact same things.\u201cWhat? Who? What kind of person?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk crap and get going, you little prick.\u201d Bill smacked Kyle on the back with all his might. Kyle staggered back and turned around, his face scrunched up.\u201cBut, uncle, some jerk is hitting on her\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat jerk is me!\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 uh, what!?\u201d\u201cYou spoiled gluttonous brat, you! I\u2019ll seriously consider whether or not I can entrust Leyla to you.\u201dContrary to his scathing tone, Bill Remmer kindly patted Kyle on the shoulder. Leyla stood aside and quietly watched the pair\u2019s bickering.Her two most beloved people in the world. Her two precious people. Two people she wanted to protect by all means.Her heart began to warm, a smile blossomed on her face. Uncle Bill and Kyle were her everything, and Leyla couldn\u2019t fathom living her life without those two by her side.That\u2019s why Leyla decided to get married after a long shilly-shallying.As Kyle proposed to her and she turned him down, the strain in their relationship grew bigger. If she couldn\u2019t accept his feelings, it would be right for her to walk away. Kyle tried hard to narrow the distance between them, but since he had already revealed his feelings, they were faced with two choices.Get married or become strangers.It would crush her innermost hope for them to stick as dear friends forever if they grew up by keeping their distance from one another.Leyla could feel her heart breaking every time she thought of them, from the fall through the winter, and into the spring living as strangers.For Leyla, the marriage and the future that Kyle had proffered to her, was a vague picture in the distance. She was cowed into indulging her avarice to a line that was beyond her reach. But if it was the only way for her not to lose Kyle,Leyla wanted to be brave.It was late spring; after Duke Herhardt had insulted her until she cried her eyes out, Leyla finally made up her mind. On that night, she dumped his gold coins into a fountain because she didn\u2019t desire anything he had given to her, then she saw Kyle\u2019s face, who had come searching for her soon after that.The moment she met Kyle, all of the sadness and grief in her heart were wholly forgotten. He stood out like a beacon of light amidst a dark forest. Like the warm light from Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage, which always awaited her return, and belighted her voyage through the dark forest trail. That glint of light became her solace and comforted all of her wounds that the world beyond the forest had given to her.Wontedly, Kyle and Bill\u2019s futile argument ended with a jolly laugh. With a lingering peal of a smile still hardened on his face, Kyle walked up to her.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Leyla.\u201dKyle reached out his hand to her. With some reluctance, Leyla grabbed the tip of his. Kyle held his gaze at her for a long moment. He grinned and then gently took her hand. So intimate and in such a tight hold.Though the changing of their relationship was still very awkward and embarrassing, Leyla didn\u2019t brush-off his hand.Because he was Kyle.The person she didn\u2019t want to lose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leyla, as well as Dr. Etman and Kyle, were dazed by the warm hospitality presented by the Lady of the House, which was something above their expectation.\u201cThank you for the invitation, Mrs. Etman.\u201dLeyla delivered a greeting which she had rehearsed dozens of times during the day and politely handed over the gift she had prepared: a bouquet of roses and pickled peaches parcelled nicely in a beautiful mason jar.\u201cThank you.\u201dMrs. Etman gladly accepted the gift. As a heave of sigh washed over her, Leyla\u2019s face lit up and Kyle\u2019s lips twitched like a grin. Mrs. Etman\u2019s eyes grew icily cold as she watched her son, yet she deftly set her expression like a Mother who was full of tenderness.Dr. Etman alluded that they\u2019d tie the knot after the College\u2019s enrollment announcement was released. However, since Kyle and Leyla were both unquestionably accepted, it could be said that their marriage had been officially confirmed.\u2018My son is together with such a girl.\u2019Mrs Etman slowly clenched her hand beneath the table. She was disenchanted, yet she had stalled voicing her disapproval. She clearly knew what kind of people her son and husband were. Her intransigent opposition had only served to backfire back on her in the end.\u201cEat a lot, Leyla.\u201d Mrs. Etman\u2019s expression softened after taking a deep breath. \u201cI specially prepared the food to your taste.\u201d She looked at Leyla with a more pleasant countenance.Leyla blinked her eyes in surprise and smiled back at Mrs Etman, though she felt strange slits of fury flickered on her beautiful face.\u2018Bitch, you must have seduced my son with that face and smile.\u2019Mrs. Etman quickly snatched a glass of water from the table. She could feel the slightest drip of ice-cold water drained down her esophagus.\u201cThank you very much, Ma\u2019am.\u201d Dimples appeared on Leyla\u2019s cheeks as she said, expressing her heartfelt gratitude.\u2018Leyla was a good girl, a really nice girl. \u2018Mrs. Etman acknowledged that fact. And it was for that reason, above all others, why she never wanted Leyla to become her daughter-in-law.It\u2019s probably a lot better if she was a troublesome child. That way, she could loathe her for the proper reason instead of hating her because she was poor.. At the very least, she wouldn\u2019t be ashamed of herself for being such an terrible mother.But now,She hated everything about Leyla Lewellin.She detested all of her: her kindness, her brilliance, and her impoverishment.\u201cLeyla, do you know? Dr. Lorentz, a professor at Ratz University is an avian biologist?\u201dDr. Etman abruptly changed the topic after witnessing his wife\u2019s unpleasant expression.\u201cOnce you enter, be sure to take Dr. Lorentz\u2019s classes. It would be very beneficial to you if you can get direct lessons from an expert such as him.\u201d\u201cDear, you\u2019re talking as if Leyla has already entered college.\u201dMrs. Etman, who had been quietly watching Leyla for some time, sprang into reaction with an unexpected retort. Dr. Etman and Kyle both had their eyes on her. Their expressions were befuddled.\u201cThere\u2019s no way she\u2019ll fail, dear.\u201d\u201cRight, Mother, there\u2019s no way Leyla will fail.\u201dThey were ready to debate her with identical facial expressions and tone of speech. Both of her husband and son were like two peas in the pod whenever they paid attention to Leyla.Mrs. Etman was compelled to swallow back the words that had been pushed to her throat. \u201c\u2026..That\u2019s true\u2026\u2026 Leyla is such a smart girl.\u201d She curved the corners of her lips upwards with slight coercion.Sitting across from her, Leyla was a little embarrassed and slightly blushed at her praise.Whenever Leyla\u2019s past story at Lovita came up, Bill Remmer always kept his lips shut. Everyone at Arvis manor knew about Leyla: she had lost her parents overnight and had travelled to Berg after moving from one relative\u2019s household to another.And Linda Etman detested this truth of Leyla Lewellin beyond all else. A child with no proper relatives to care for and nurture her. A child who had travelled across the border, and was repeatedly kicked out. She was on the verge of getting chills whenever thinking about how lousy her foundation for starting a family would be.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t she be getting something too big?\u2019Even if Leyla came from a ordinary well-off family, she would still hinder that girl from being together with her son. Linda Etman believed: a girl who grew up without a good background won\u2019t become an excellent spouse. Moreover, seeing a \u2018skint\u2019 girl like her who was so eager to study at College, was very irksome to see.Despite her lesser means, watching how Leyla had lofty ambitions that were out of her league, and considering her poor circumstances led Linda Etman to label her as a greedy person. She thought for sure: Kyle would never be able to live happily if such a child would become his wife.\u2018That\u2019s why I have to stop it.\u2019Mrs. Etman tightened her grip under the table.She had to stop this marriage by all means possible.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla Lewellin\u2019s acceptance note to university arrived in the mail from the very same postman who had delivered little Leyla to Arvis in the past.Bill Remmer, who received the letter while Leyla was out and in the forest, stood still for a long while.\u201cMr. Remmer?\u201dThe Mailman glanced at him with a worried face after Bill didn\u2019t give a response after he said his congratulations. His expression that was carefree a moment ago, suddenly became a blazing bright crimson.\u201cAre you okay, Mr. Remmer?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, there\u2019s nothing to fuss about.\u201d Bill rubbed his eyes with his rough hand. \u201cI was just thinking for a moment.\u201dHe raised his voice as he spoke. His eyes glistened. The postman, who had known the gardener of Arvis was \u2018The bruiser with a soft center\u2019, nodded quietly, pretending not to notice a tear which was forming on the corner of his eyes.\u201cAnyway, congratulations. I\u2019m thrilled to know that Leyla is going to be a student at the best university in the Empire.\u201dAfter congratulating Bill for a second time, the postman departed from the cottage.Bill glided back to the terrace holding the acceptance letter and sat on his chair. He reread the letter many times and softly stroked the letter typing with his fingers. After taking a deep breath, his face gradually returned to normal, which was getting redder with compassion. That was when Leyla came back.\u201cUncle!\u201dLeyla waved her arms up in the air while running as she saw Bill sitting on the terrace. Her old leather bag that was draped over her shoulder swung slightly.\u201cThat damned bag.\u201dBill chortled as he hissed faintly. It was his tool bag that he had given to her when she first arrived at the cottage over the summer. Leyla had a few nicer bags than that one, but still, she relied on that old, battered bag every time she went for a stroll in the forest.\u201cWhen are you going to throw away that trash bag?\u201dBill began to ask Leyla, who was sitting next to him.\u201cThrow it?\u201d She yapped. \u201cWhy?! It\u2019s still usable.\u201d\u201cNow, please throw that bag into the trash! That grody thing could bring you bad luck!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll use it a little more.\u201d Leila giggled softly as her finger fiddled with the tattered leather bag strap. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little empty without it.\u201d\u2018Well, I know it sounds like a fool\u2019s talk.\u2019She murmured. Without saying a word, Bill quietly held out the letter in front of her eyes.\u201cUncle, what\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you read it.\u201dLeyla blinked at the letter with her eye-popping. Bill thought that she would burst out into cheers of joy, but Leyla\u2019s face just grew more composed as she continued reading the letter of acceptance.\u201c\u2026Leyla?\u201dBill spoke first, and he did so with some trepidation after he saw her overly muted reaction. Only then did Leyla lift her head and turned to face him. A faint smile appeared on her lips.\u2018It would be nice if you were jolly like a little girl in a moment like this.\u2019Bill scratched the back of his neck at her silent slant, which was mature enough to make him feel ill at ease. Leyla momentarily smirked at him, who was standing still for a brief moment.Suddenly, she hugged him tightly.\u201cHey, it\u2019s stuffy!\u201dAt odds with his prickly words, Bill tepidly patted her back.Later on, Leyla raised her head, \u201cThank you.\u201d She whispered in a hushed tone. \u201cThank you so much, Uncle.\u201dWith every glance he gave her, Leyla\u2019s eyes welled up with tears and her lips melted into a wide grin.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying nonsense.\u201dBill gulped for air and started counting in his head. He reflected on the chores he needed to do one by one before the sunset, but the heat in her eyes showed no signs of abating.Now Bill was sure: \u2018This little child must have brought her tear bag from Lovita.\u2019\u201cYou were the one who studied hard and earned a passing grade on the exam. What did I do, huh?\u201d\u201cNo. No, Uncle.\u201d Leyla shook her head and reached out to take Bill\u2019s hand in hers. Her tiny hands had a tough time holding his hand.\u201cI\u2026\u201dShe stuttered. The hand she was grasping had flowed a warm feeling that was akin to the tepidness she had after sipping a shot of vodka.\u201cUncle, if it weren\u2019t for you, I\u2019d have been\u2026.\u201dOn this happy day, Leyla looked like she\u2019s about to cry. Bill didn\u2019t like it, and he dreaded the sight of her sobbing face the most. He didn\u2019t want to witness Leyla\u2019s tears, even if they were tears of happiness.His fondness for this child was far greater beyond all the love and care he had devoted to the flowers and trees that he had planted throughout his life. Bill was perplexed knowing he cherished this child more than his precious flowers and trees.It just happened naturally before he knew it and he was more than happy to accept that fact.\u201cShall we go to the Capital together next weekend?\u201d asked Bill in a cheerful tone after coughing a little bit to calm his emotions.\u201cBoth of us?\u201d Leyla\u2019s pupils dilated. \u201cGoing to the Ratz?\u201d it left her bewildered.\u201cI have to pay your tuition fee since you\u2019ve been accepted into college. Besides, I haven\u2019t brought you to any place yet, so let\u2019s go sightseeing around the capital city.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Leyla\u2019s tear-stained face glowed with zest. \u201cUncle, are you serious? We\u2019re going on a vacation together?\u201d\u201cWhat vacation?\u201d He jested. \u201cI\u2019m just going to pay your tuition.\u201d\u201cAh, whatever it is. All that matters is we\u2019re going together.\u201dA tinge of regret lingered in his eyes when he looked at Leyla, who was such a happy camper at the moment.He wanted to take her for a walk to a nearby place, show her something interesting, and buy something delicious to eat.But why?Bill questioned himself, lamenting. Why did all of these thoughts occur to him only now? As the day when he would have to let her go from, his arms drew nearer?\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money, even though the two of you are getting married, I\u2019m still worried about letting you go alone with Kyle carrying that much money, so I can\u2019t help it, but\u2026..\u201dThe babbling Bill eventually hooted with laughter. Leyla flung herself once again onto his hug.\u201cLook, Leyla.\u201d Bill gave her a lovely smile. \u201c Am I right?\u201d He gently combed her hair with his fingers. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019ll be a good adult?\u201dIn the end, he couldn\u2019t put it into words, and Bill was at a loss for what to say as well, so he just stroked Leyla\u2019s head again over and over again.Bill Remmer needed to count more than ever than before to keep his ugly crying face on hold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since it had been widely expected, nobody was surprised to hear that Dr. Etman\u2019s lone son had been accepted into a prestigious medical school with outstanding grades.It was Leyla who topped the talk. In these past few days, she had become the talk of the town wherever people gathered. Even the Duke\u2019s greenhouse listened regarding this kind of talk.\u201cI just can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Norma gasped. \u201cBill Remmer made a great choice by sending an orphan, and moreover, a girl, to a College.\u201dNorma Catharina von Herhardt, who wouldn\u2019t usually say anything on the street about low-income youngsters, tuned in on today\u2019s chatter about Leyla with great interest, just like others.\u201cI supposed she was born under a lucky star.\u201d Elysee von Herhardt added a pinch of salt to the table talk. \u201cShe met her daddy-long-legs and was even now engaged to Dr. Etman\u2019s son.\u201dClaudine was quietly sipping her tea next to the Duchess, nodding graciously in accordance, then a radiant smirk appeared on her face, \u201cI\u2019m so glad that a poor kid like her has such good luck.\u201dShe praised Leyla more sincerely than she had previously done. As luck would have it, the maid who had gone to pick up the kid on Norma\u2019s orders returned to the greenhouse just in time. She was with Leyla who was neatly dressed.\u201cCome here and sit down.\u201dDuchess Norma calmly instructed her to take a seat. Elysee and Claudine both stared at her, their brows slanted, so as Leyla\u2019s.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with serving this special child a cup of tea, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Norma flashed a smile as she said.Like many of Herhardt\u2019s, Catharina von Herhardt was noble to the bone to say that the blood coursing through her veins must have had a deep blue tint on it. Hence, everyone was astonished with wonder by her willingness to share a tea table with the orphaned child raised by her gardener.Ushered by the maid, Leyla sat on her chair, her cheeks flushed with nervousness.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that getting into Imperial University is very hard, even for the sons of the most illustrious families.\u201dDuchess Norma opened the conversation first after the maid placed the cup of tea in front of Leyla.\u201cIt was all thanks to Uncle Bill,\u201d Leyla responded, as she politely lowered her gaze.\u201cYes. You must not forget the kindness of your benefactor, Bill Remmer.\u201d\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cAre you from Lovita?\u201d\u201cMy mother was from Lovita, but my father was a Berg.\u201d\u201cSame as me.\u201dElysee and Claudine both dilated their eyes simultaneously in response to Norma\u2019s peculiar words that sounded like a veiled innuendo.People knew Duchess Norma von Herhardt was a Marquise of repute and the sole cousin of Emperor Berg. Her mother was a progeniture of Lovita\u2019s aristocratic line; no one would dare to draw a parallel line between her to an orphan who was raised from a humble background.\u201cTell me what you want.\u201dThe abrupt request from the elderly Duchess, who just laid her teacup down, caught Leyla jerking her head up, startled.\u201cBill Remmer is my favourite employee.\u201d She stated it quietly, \u201cAnd you\u2019re a child he raised like his own daughter, so I should give you a congratulatory gift.\u201dEmbarrassment immediately rose up to Leyla\u2019s cheeks. Just in time, she stared at the Duchess; instead of concealing her eyes, the greenhouse received the arrival of another visitor. Claudine spotted him as he neared them and blurted out,\u201cDuke Herhardt!\u201dClaudine\u2019s cheery voice got everyone\u2019s attention, and their eyes fled to a distinguished man.Leyla swiftly turned her head and saw Matthias von Herhardt standing haughtily near the table. Their eyes met, faces frowned on one another for a host of reasons. The tension persisted between them until Leyla averted her gaze from him.\u201cThis child had been successfully accepted into Ratz University. So we took her out for tea together because it was something to celebrate,\u201d Elysee explained in a voice laced with hilarity.After a brief nod, Matthias sat down on a chair beside Claudine, which happened to be the seat facing Leyla.\u201cYou\u2019re back early today.\u201d Claudine gave a warm welcome to her fianc\u00e9.Matthias always departed the mansion right after the clock hit the dawn of the day and would always return late at night after he had taken charge of the family\u2019s business for good. It had already been a week since Claudine stayed at Arvis, but this was the first time she had seen Matthias come home before gloam.\u201cThe meeting came to a close earlier than planned, My Lady.\u201d\u201cWhat a relief. I was worried you might be overdoing it these days.\u201d\u201cClaudine\u2019s right, Matthias,\u201d Elysee added. \u201cTake your time and avoid rushing. If you end up ruining your health, it would be a real concern.\u201dFollowing that, the conversation drifted to Matthias\u2019s current situation, with the family-run business and Leyla Lewellin\u2019s presence seemed to have been wiped out in a blink of an eye.But thanks to it, Leyla had a moment to catch her breath and take a sip of her already cooled tea. She wished she could escape this unpleasant situation, but she knew it would be rude to do so in front of the two Duchesses who were keeping a keen eye on her every move.Leyla put her teacup down onto the saucer, cautious not to create any noise within her gestures.When she elevated her sight, she flinched slightly, and her back banged against the chair.Matthias sat quietly between his chattering fianc\u00e9e and his mother; his callous eyes fixed on her in the same gaze he had on the day he ruthlessly trampled her heart and abandoned her behind.Leyla, who was trying to grab the teacup again, hurriedly slid her hands beneath the table. Matthias was seen speaking to Claudine for a while before turning his attention to his Mother and then back to her.She lowered her head, daring not to look at him in the eyes, but Leyla could still feel his menacing glare piercing through her body.That gaze served as a constant reminder of her last summer\u2019s memories. In the face of Claudine, those memories grew even more humiliating, and Leyla had enough of it. Although the Duke committed wrongdoings, it was always her who felt guilty.\u201cSo, have you thought about what you want?\u201dNorma\u2019s questions brought the table\u2019s spotlight back to Leyla Lewellin.Leyla clenched her jaw hearing Norma and bit her lip involuntarily as she witnessed Matthias\u2019 blue eyes remain glued on her. She immediately switched her look to Norma, attempting to conceal her reddened face.\u201cYou\u2019ve already given me a wonderful gift, Ma\u2019am. That was more than enough.\u201d\u201cYou already got it?\u201d\u201cYes. Just allowing me to stay here in Arvis, in Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage, is already a gift I cannot repay. It was the biggest and most precious gift I\u2019ve ever received and I\u2019ll be forever grateful for it my whole life.\u201d\u201cWe just granted Bill Remmer\u2019s request.\u201d\u201cThat permission was a gift that changed my life,\u201d said Leyla, her lips curved in a faint smile. \u201cI am also very grateful to you, Ma\u2019am,\u201d she also didn\u2019t forget to express her polite gratitude towards Elysee.\u201d\u2026. Also to the Duke and Lady Claudine.\u201dSomehow, Leyla was more than delighted to express her gratitude to everyone, including those she disliked, rather than asking for permission to leave the place.\u201cI won\u2019t forget the kindness you have given me, even when the time comes for me to leave Arvis.\u201d With a deep bow, she took Norma\u2019s question into appreciation.Duchess Norma scrutinized her thoroughly before giving a slight nod. It would be impolite to turn down Herhardt\u2019s favour; nevertheless, Leyla\u2019s courteous attitude seemed to astound her, which she found to be quite commendable for a plebeian young girl.\u201cHave you already said goodbye?\u201dClaudine asked sadly.\u201cYou must be sad, Leyla.\u201d She kept a silent gaze on her and offered something to her, \u201cI understand how you feel, but I still want to give you a present. Oh, how about if I pay for your college tuition?\u201d\u201cNo, Miss. The kindness you have shown me has already made me feel very grateful.\u201dLeyla looked at Claudine; a smile tightened on her face.\u201cUncle Bill has already saved the tuition money aside. He wants to cover the cost of my first semester of college.\u201d\u201cReally? I\u2019ll have to think of something else to give as a present then,\u201d she declared, \u201cI can\u2019t let my old friend leave empty-handed who had been accepted into College and is about to marry. . Isn\u2019t that right, Duke Herhardt?\u201d Claudine said. Her lips curving into a brilliant grin, and her voice calling his name sounded as sweet as a honey.Matthias took a moment glancing at Leyla before he gently gestured his head in agreement with his fianc\u00e9e.Leyla was eventually allowed to leave that unsettling tea table after many more formal talks and niceties.She was standing with her back to the Herhardt family at the time when her eyes were drawn to the scenic view of the greenhouse.Eden of Arvis.That\u2019s what everyone called it.The opulent greenhouse, where people say lavished grandiose praises on one another, left her feeling uneasy and out of breath.The stifling feeling that engulfed her was analogous to the one she had when she saw lovely crippled winged bird or mixed flowers of colours, its scents stinging her nose. From the gurgling water that was flowing from the marble fountain to the sunshine that was cast in through the surrounding glass windows, the whole nine yards echoed that sentiment precisely.Leyla strode out of the greenhouse without giving a second glance behind. Only when she clapped her eyes on the glimmer of light outside and smelt the wind blowing over her body did she expel her sigh.Long shadows trailed her footsteps beneath the twilight gloom as she walked into the heart of the forest.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cSister, do you know what you are talking about?\u201dDaniel Rayner was stunned and therefore asked in disbelief. The crepuscular light cascading in through the uncurtained window blinded him and his cousin, Linda Etman, who sat calmly opposite from him.\u201cSister!\u201d\u201cTone down your voice, Daniel!\u201dMrs. Etman sternly chastised him as she cast a quick peek through the closed door. Daniel heaved in shock.Daniel Rayner, who had just regained his business\u2019s impetus after the failure of his overseas mining venture, had frequently sought help from Linda Etman, his cousin\u2019s-sister and his wealthiest relative. She, who had consistently rebuffed his appeals graciously but heartlessly, this time came to visit him first.It went without saying that the promised help won\u2019t be returned back. However, Daniel\u2019s excitement for taking her helping hand soon turned to hesitation upon hearing Mrs. Etman\u2019s improper words.\u201cIt\u2019s stealing, Sister. How\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Mrs. Etman abruptly cut-off his words and narrowed her eyes onto crinkled slits. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of hiding it for a while and returning it.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you care about Kyle too?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d\u201cAnd you, too, need my help,\u201d Mrs. Etman said as she lifted her hand from her lap and caressed her heated temple. As foreseen, Daniel Rayner was unable to counter and could only bend his head in shame.\u201cI\u2019m going to keep the money for a while and return it at the right time\u201d, she reasoned. \u201cIf you can do that simple task, you will be able to safeguard your family, and I will be able to protect my son.\u201dMrs. Etman straightened her sitting posture and looked at Daniel Rayner with a satisfied expression on her face.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a bad deal. What do you think?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leyla, who was walking with her gaze down staring at the ground, promptly lifted her head in eyes widened.Kyle couldn\u2019t keep the grin off his face from adoring that moment. The moment Leyla quickened her stride whenever she got a hold of his presence was always very adorable.Leyla flashed a beaming smile as she neared closer to him.\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d\u201cI went to your cottage a while ago and they told me that you had been summoned to the Duke\u2019s manor, so I was on my way to save you.\u201d\u201cSave me?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious why Lady Brandt called you?\u201d\u201cNot today,\u201d said Leyla as she took a step forward. Kyle trailed behind, his stride was perfectly timed with her.\u201cIt was Grand Duchess Norma, not Lady Brandt.\u201d\u201cGrand Duchess? She did?\u201d\u201cYeah, she congratulated me on passing the exam and asked if there was anything I wanted as a gift.\u201d\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d\u201cI said nothing. I just conveyed my gratitude for letting me stay here.\u201d\u201cWow, it was so Leyla Lewellin-Esque answer.\u201dKyle just smirked at what he had guessed. He gently scooped her hand, and Leyla seemed to be less nervous compared to the past. This small change brought his level of happiness climbed by one or two notches.They strolled along the familiar road, hand in hand, as they shared stories. It began by their everyday routines, mystery novels published in today\u2019s newspapers, and their meagre summer plans for this year. As always, the intimate atmosphere snippet mingled with their rhythmic footfall, who was walking alongside one another.Before long, the afternoon sky was broken, and jolted the twilight from its light slumber.When the nightfall dawned, the sea of trees was soon blanketed in its beauty. Kyle yanked Leyla\u2019s hand and dragged her into the darkness with him.He leaned her body against the tall tree on the side of the road as she reeled, then stepped in front of her. Everything happened in the blink of an eye, yet Kyle felt as if time had halted still for eternity throughout that moment.Leyla glanced at him, bewildered.\u201cKyle?\u201dHer voice was trembling a tad as she spoke. Her bonnie pink delicate lips glowed attractively even in the pitch blackness of the nite.Kyle summoned all his courage and bent his head towards her; his eyes slammed shut. The warm skin soon reached his lips, but he wasn\u2019t pleased with the touch he was getting.Kyle opened his eyes and laughed out loud. He found out that his lips had kissed Leyla\u2019s hand rather than what he planned.\u201cI felt weird doing this, Kyle.\u201d Leyla was gazing at him with her blushing face while her other hand was firmly covering her lips.As Kyle slowly raised his head, once again she spoke,\u201cIt seems like we\u2019re doing something bad if we do this, and I\u2026.\u201dLeyla dropped her gaze quietly, unable to bring herself to finish her words. Her pale, long eyelashes were likewise heading down.\u2018Don\u2019t you think this is wrong?\u2019When Leyla struggled to swallow the words she so wished to talk, Kyle flashed a grin. The hue of his cheeks now had matched hers in colour.\u201cHey, Miss Lewellin. An innocent person who doesn\u2019t know how to kiss like you knows what?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThough you were chattering really loudly in the train back then as if you were an expert.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026Oh, gosh!\u201d Leyla hunched over to look shorter after recalling the day Kyle wanted to leap off a speeding train after she gave him a lecture about the act of reproduction.\u201cT-that\u2019s\u2026.\u201d Leyla\u2019s eyes rolled skyward, and she gulped, finding she lacked the right words to debate him. \u201cI-I\u2019m also not sure about that\u2026..\u201d she softly whispered.Her habit of muttering low when she was in a position of disadvantage had remained unaltered since their childhood, to which Kyle let out a faint sigh.His heartbeat went loose; it was pathetic that he couldn\u2019t kiss the woman he would marry, but Kyle didn\u2019t abhor it either. His deepest wish was to win Leyla\u2019s heart, so he refused to shatter her heart merely because of his fleeting lust.Softly, Kyle fondled her cheeks, wrapping his hands around them. And then, he kissed her. His heated lips found their way to her forehead. He tried his best not to be greedy anymore, and with that, Kyle had kept his promise.As he drew in a steadying breath, the pleasing scent littered his lungs.The sweet scent of roses.It was the scent of Leyla.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias gingerly walked towards the window on the west side of his bedroom after taking a shower.His routine went on wontedly. Though he slept off after midnight, he would usually be awake pretty early in the morning. He made his way to the bathroom without losing a beat and took a quick shower before getting ready for the day ahead. It had already evolved into a sort of habit, which he could do effortlessly since it had been ingrained into his bones.Perhaps, even right now.Matthias looked over the open window. In his garden surrounded by blossoming rose fields, Leyla was there, hard at work.Perhaps as the day of her departure drew nearer, she had been seen following the gardener much more often recently. The two of them didn\u2019t separate for a single second and kept conversing without the slightest pause.He once described Leyla Lewellin as a \u2018very reticent child\u2019 who seldom opened her padlocked lips in front of Claudine.\u201cMaster, this is Hessen.\u201dHe heard the familiar sound of a door-knocking at the scheduled hour.\u201cCome on in.\u201dStanding with his back against the windows, Matthias gave a succinct response. The chiffon drapes were rattling in the wind that wafted through the open stile.While reading the newspaper Hessen had brought, Matthias overheard the reports about his to-do list for the day. He seemed to be having a laid-back schedule before the luncheon.\u201cIt seems that Arvis was completely filled upon the return of its Master,\u201d Hessen added a word rather than retreating silently as he usually did.Matthias turned to face him, setting down his teacup on the table. \u201cMy grandmother and mother would probably be sad if they heard that.\u201d\u201cPardon? Oh no, master. I didn\u2019t mean that \u2026.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d A smile crept across Matthias\u2019s lips. \u201cI know what you meant.\u201dHis momentary grin soon melted away, but his eyes stayed riveted on the middle-aged butler calmly; it was placid like a windless night. Hessen hurried off the room, after noticing the look of displeasure in his master\u2019s eyes.Even after the bedroom door was closed, Matthias continued reading the newspaper while leaning on the windowsill. His bluish eyes, exposed through the loose strands of his hair, sparkled even brighter when the sunlight hit them.After thoroughly reading the article about Count Klein\u2019s business-someone he would have luncheon with, Matthias put down the newspaper.He slowly turned his head and saw Leyla walking into the flowerbed near the manor. Her braided hair beneath the straw hat was swinging as she hopped around.The gardener appeared to be shouting something at her, and Leyla answered excitedly. She burst out laughing. Even with the hat shade obscuring her face, Matthias nonetheless could tell she was laughing with a bubbly voice.Matthias\u2019 brows furrowed in a scowl. He ruffled his hair and slowly swept it back.\u2018Should I not come back?\u2019The thought was running rampant in his head from the second he set foot on the manor ground.His entire life had been meticulously orchestrated. It was analogous to the stairwell leading to a perfect life and he needed just to tread on it.But, the stairwell was twisted, which muddled his steps.And Matthias still couldn\u2019t understand why he had taken a choice that broke his life\u2019s cycle.\u2018No.\u2018He may have already broken it long before the night when he tore up the letter extending his military service.It all began from the day he decided to serve an additional year in the military and postponed his wedding\u2014 the day when petty desires blindsided him.The day when he approached her, after she fell from her bicycle.Or maybe from the day, he didn\u2019t even remember.He still desired her\u2026Matthias was keenly aware of the amplitude of his feelings.As such, he desired that she would disappear. And he believed that his desire was something right.His state of shambles was sparked by the inner conflict between his raging emotions and guileless desires. Matthias was unable to provide a definitive answer, but he trusted the passage of time would eventually remedy the matter.The window was slammed shut, and Matthias changed his outfit into a different one. The trellis shade slid over his face as he strode along the hallway.Luring by his discernment, Matthias left the manor alone and followed the forest trail leading to the river. On the underside of the dazzling moonlight, the dancing shadows loomed sombrer.Matthias stalled for quite a while beneath the thick shadow cast by the surrounding trees to get sucked up onto reverie.His world had no concept of longing since he had never had a desire of his own. There was a raw feeling that he had discovered when he was unable to get what he desired and it was a pretty odd frisson that had seized possession of his body.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Daniel Rayner\u2019s countenance grew paler as a ghost as he got closer to the gardener\u2019s cottage. The sun wasn\u2019t yet scorching, but the sweat was already dampening his forehead.\u201cThis is nuts.\u201dDaniel mumbled frantic words as the cottage\u2019s roof had shown itself from the distance. Mrs. Etman told him that she wanted to temporarily withhold the tuition money the gardener had prepared,\u2014which amounted to nothing more than a stealing act if her discourse was condensed.\u2018The noble and graceful Linda Etman beguiled her cousin into committing a sin in the hope of severing the poor girl\u2019s relationship with her son.\u2019Daniel Rayner heaved a sigh and entered the cottage\u2019s front yard. He took out the handkerchief from his pocket and again wiped his face. His grip on the briefcase stretched tightly.He also felt sorry for Kyle, who had fallen in love with and chosen to marry a girl who wasn\u2019t a suitable fit for him. Despite their low social standing, everyone expected that the Etman family would have a daughter-in-law who was nonetheless a silk-stocking.However, it was something Kyle sincerely wanted, and Dr. Etman supported it. He believed that Leyla Lewellin deserved to be their son\u2019s companion. Mrs. Etman, too, acquiesced in her husband\u2019s decision. But, who knows?\u00a0A hidden dagger may be lurking behind her benign smile.\u201cMoney is your foe.\u201dAfter a moment of despondence, and making up his mind, Daniel gallantly strode towards the cottage. Linda Etman said that the cottage would be vacant in the morning. So if Leyla happened to be there, Daniel only needed to reason that he had just returned from Etman\u2019s home and dropped by to congratulate her on getting into college. It wasn\u2019t a suspicious excuse, given that they had met and known each other before.With cautious, Daniel knocked on the front door. Guilt seeped into his veins as he prayed Leyla was inside, and this scheme would fail. Yet, the thing that greeted him inside the house was all quietness.Daniel then pulled on the doorknob, and feelings of despair and hopelessness started to blend into one. As his sister had assured him, the door was unlocked.\u2018But, sis, didn\u2019t you mention that even if the money was stolen, someone would undoubtedly help her in paying her tuition? Even Dr. Etman was willing to pay for her tuition fees.\u2019Linda Etman stiffened her cheeks with a bitter smile when Daniel questioned her in bewilderment.\u2018I know my husband better than you.\u2019\u2018But why\u2026.\u2019\u2018The missing tuition was just an excuse.\u2019\u2018Huh?\u2019\u2018An excuse to break her heart.\u2019\u2018\u2026.\u2019A sigh punctuated his silent reply.Daniel refused to comment and could only blink slowly. He had no interest to become involved in their household matters and this shameful deed just made him feel more guilty and disappointed in himself. But he kept grasping at straws, although it made him feel like a despicable person.He was only helping his cousin sister to keep the gardener\u2019s money for the time being; Daniel recited that rationalization thought a thousand times in his head before summoning the courage to enter the house.He completed the job quickly. Daniel breathed a sigh of relief after successfully leaving the cottage with a bag of money. He had rolled the dice and succeeded in his role on the game board. He just has to hand over the scruffy cash to Linda Etman and then go home, content in the knowledge that his laborious efforts to protect his family would be repaid in full in the near future.Daniel opted for a loop along the riverside to avoid a situation where he might encounter the gardener. Worse luck, his prudent choice landed him in a pickle when he met paths with a young man near the river.Seeing Daniel Rayner, the young man stopped his sluggish steps. Without even a speck of suspicion or surprise in his face, the young man stood still and regarded him stoically.\u2018Is he one of Arvis\u2019s employees?\u2019It was not long after his momentarily nonchalant attitude soothed him; Daniel\u2019s complexion soon grew like a death warmed up.Wearing a comfy shirt, that young man didn\u2019t look like a servant as he strolled down the riverside at the busy time to start the day. Moreover, his princely face had all the hallmarks of the familiar figure he recognized.The very face that was featured countless times in newspapers and which he could only see on many occasions from a distance.The young owner of a heaven-like place called Arvis.It was Duke Herhardt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This time, with a radically different narrative.Now, the outline was;\u00a0\u2018The gardener\u2019s cottage had been burgled.\u2019The news traveled fast around the Manor like a wildfire. The incident was met with people\u2019s doubts. Few believed a thief had the nerve to steal from Duke Herhardt\u2019s estate. Only until they saw a half-dazed Bill Remmer looking for the culprit did they believe the robbery really happened.Matthias departed the Mansion at the peak of the clamor. The scheduled time had come, and he must leave now to avoid being late for lunch.He wasn\u2019t the kind to chime in on gossipy talks, sensing something different upon passing the Arvis\u2019s driveway flanked by Platanus trees.From the opposite side of the road, police officers on horseback were making their way toward the scene. Matthias didn\u2019t even have to make logical assumptions of where they were going since the route would lead them to the Arvis forest.\u201cThey said a thief broke into the gardener\u2019s house.\u201dThe quick-witted aide answered first before Matthias could open his mouth to ask.\u201cAt Bill Remmer\u2019s house?\u201d\u201cYes, he was in a big pickle since the funds he\u2019d set aside for his daughter\u2019s College tuition were stolen.\u201dThief.Tuition.Leyla.Matthias tilted his head to one side, elatedly repeating those three syllables.Just as his vehicle exited the Platanus\u2019 shade, he recalled his unpleasant encounter with a strange man on the Schulter River this morning.The guy introduced himself as Daniel Rayner, Mrs. Etman\u2019s cousin. He was in the neighborhood paying a visit to Etman\u2019s house and stopped by the Estate to congratulate Leyla.His following few speeches were full of baloney; the investment firm he ran, the mining rights of overseas mines, the stock market, and other business-related matters. But most of them had been spilled and were now just a blot on Matthias\u2019 mind.Matthias did, nevertheless, remembered a few details about the event. His wristwatch read nine o\u2019clock in the morning when he met a middle-aged man drenched in sweat by the riverside.It seemed strange for a well-heeled middle-class businessman to bother coming just to congratulate his cousin\u2019s future daughter-in-law at such an early hour.Matthias, however, didn\u2019t mind it since it was irrelevant to him. He treated the thought as a passing interest until he overheard a ludicrous report of a burglar sneaking into the gardener\u2019s cottage.But why?As a civilized business person, sneaking into Arvis to steal the gardener\u2019s money seemed so wrong no matter how dire his financial circumstance was. If he were him, Matthias would instead steal from the house of his wealthy cousin sister.\u201cLinda Etman.\u201dHe was ready to quit on thinking such a nonsensical idea when he muttered that name without knowing.After he inserted Linda Etman\u2019s name between that guy and Leyla, Matthias was able to draw a very plausible relationship line between the three of them.He was just guessing. Yet, it was fascinating, how perfectly fit the jigsaw pieces were in place together.The car finally reached their stop in front of the Hotel, where his appointment for the luncheon will take place. Before stepping out, Matthias issued a short order to his assistant.\u201cEvers\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d\u201cFind out about Daniel Rayner. ASAP.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The food on the dinner table was left nearly untouched, but it was hard to get up from the table where Bill and Kyle used to dine together.Leyla, who was well aware of the cause, quietly cleaned the table.Leaving his half-eaten plate, Bill Remmer went straight to the porch and lit up a cigarette. Since the thief broke in, the mood in their cottage had lost its thrill.\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Leyla.\u201dKyle spoke cautiously as he helped her. Leyla\u2019s hardworking hands screeched to a pause, and she lifted her emerald eyes to meet his.\u201cThat thief, I\u2019m sure we can catch him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if we are unable to arrest him, don\u2019t fret about the tuition. My father said that he will also pay yours.\u201d\u201cKyle.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try to say no. My father wanted to pay for it from the very beginning. But Uncle Bill was so stubborn that my father caved.\u201d Kyle firmly argued, \u201cTo get married means being family, Leyla. It\u2019s not about being in debt, it\u2019s about helping each other\u2026 Isn\u2019t that how families should be?\u201dLeyla lowered her gaze, stood still and finally nodded her head slowly. Her face had grown so gaunt in a matter of days, fueling Kyle with hatred for the robber who had despoiled the woodland\u2019s peacefulness.\u201cAnyway, just in case, let\u2019s just think about how to catch the thief first.\u201dKyle expressed his optimism by saying, even though he knew that the odds of catching the thief were very slim. Leyla gave a sliver smile.\u201c\u2026Thanks, Kyle.\u201d\u201cThank you? What did I do?\u201d\u201cFor everything\u2026\u201dOnce again, a grin crept on her lips, yet her smiling face caused Kyle\u2019s heart to feel heavy.Kyle clearly remembered the tinge of happiness plastered on Leyla\u2019s face at the idea of coming to the Capital with Uncle Bill. Though Uncle Bill downplayed his trip by claiming it was to pay for her tuition, in truth, it was their very first Family Vacation.Uncle Bill couldn\u2019t express his elation well, owing to his blunt personality, but undoubtedly, he was thrilled to go on a trip with Leyla, to the point that he teased her, and claimed that she would make an excellent guide for him since this would be her second visit to Ratz.Places to visit, foods to try, and activities to do together were all must to do. Kyle almost got jealous at Uncle Bill witnessing how endearing was Leyla when she was talking with passion bad giddily with him.But, the thief ruined everything.Even if they could get the money back, Leyla and Uncle Bill couldn\u2019t go on a trip with such pleasure, and Kyle couldn\u2019t do anything about it.Kyle shook off his boundless helplessness as he caught his breath and approached Bill who was sitting suddenly on the porch.He cast a look at Kyle, who was seated next to him before he resumed heaving the cigar. Depression had been consuming him for the recent days. Inside him, a boiling hatred against the thief was brewing, to the point he devised hundreds of different methods to kill people.After some silence, he spoke.\u201cIt was all my fault.\u201dHis voice was choking.\u201cI left a lot of money at home, but didn\u2019t properly lock the door.\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t at fault. Who would have thought someone would dare to steal in the Arvis Estate?\u201d\u201cThe payment deadline is next week, and I\u2019m not sure if the thief will be caught before then.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. If there\u2019s no progress in catching the thief before then, my father said that he would pay Leyla\u2019s tuition as well. I\u2019ve told Leyla about this.\u201dKyle\u2019s beaming face drove Bill Remmer\u2019s eyes to sink beyond a deep well.\u201cI will call the Police tomorrow. I will ask our Officer acquaintance to properly investigate this case.\u201d\u201cThank you Kyle, I owe it all to your family.\u201d\u201cI feel bad to hear that, I haven\u2019t even paid half the price of the food I ate all this time.\u201dAt his witty, Bill could smile a bit, albeit, it was a weak smile.\u201cPlease convey my gratitude to your parents. Ah no, please tell them I will pay them a visit once this matter is settled?\u201d He squeezed Kyle\u2019s shoulder as he said so.Kyle nodded, dissuading him from saying,\u00a0\u2018You shouldn\u2019t.\u2019\u00a0He couldn\u2019t pinpoint why, but he had that unexplained feeling about Bill Remmer.Kyle also didn\u2019t want to offend him in any way.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The Duke\u2019s manor had two study rooms.The study on the second floor was a spacious, book-filled space that rivaled the scale of a public library. The second one, that was located at the end of the third floor next to the master bedroom, was less in size.The library, that was loaded chiefly with history, politics, and economics books, had been used by Duke of Herhardt for generations as a place for receiving guests and conducting business meetings.Similarly, Duke Matthias von Herhardt did.Mark Evers, the Duke\u2019s aide, rushed off his feet to the third-floor office. He seemed in demand.He had been Matthias\u2019s Assistant since he was fully fledged. But never once did the Duke give him orders in such haste like now.All along, Matthias always presented him the image of an easy-going Master with an innately laid-back attitude. But soon, he realized. Perhaps, that was because nothing existed under the skies of the Berg Empire that could make Duke Herhardt champ at the bit.*\u00a0(To\u00a0be\u00a0very\u00a0eager\u00a0or\u00a0impatient\u00a0to\u00a0do\u00a0something)Matthias von Herhardt was a man of influence.He had it all.And everything he did went as slick as a whistle.Mark Evers deemed that his Master\u2019s generosity and kindness stemmed from there.His calm-wolfish-predator persona led him to feel the air move slowly whenever he was around Matthias. It was Duke Herhardt, whom he was familiar with.Hence, when Matthias added the term \u2018ASAP\u2019 to his order, Mark Evers briefly questioned his ears. After his brain processed hard, he quickly grew impatient and frantically began investigating Daniel Rayner.\u201cMaster, this is Evers.\u201dMark Evers galloped to the Duke\u2019s Office on the third floor and knocked on the door. A light source glinted through the door plate, but no answer came from behind the closed jamb.In other words, it meant\u00a0\u2018Yes.\u2019He slowly threw open the door and entered the office. Matthias was sloping on the spacious leather sofa. It was a brisk night, yet he was still clad in formal attire from his previous meeting with a business partner.\u201cIt\u2019s about Daniel Rayner, as you asked.\u201dMark Evers politely placed the file folder he was carrying on the table.Matthias dropped his hand from his temple and took the document; he then started flipping the pages. His stance, attentively scanning the papers in his hands, was definitely that of the Duke Herhardt Mark Evers knew.But the peace was short-lived, and Mark Evers was soon thrust into a direful scene.Matthias busted a gut as he reached the last page of reading. He had no clue why misfortune was playing such a cruel joke on Daniel Rayner; enticed by foreign mining investment but duped, then detained and forced to give up his house as collateral, he invested a huge sum of money and ended up in Queer Street*.\u00a0(T/N: In difficulty, typically by being in debt)What a gut-wrenching loss!\u201cDaniel Rayner, it seems he has paid off all of his bank debt recently.\u201dMatthias folded the document in his hand. One of his lips curled upward. His expressionless face was quite gentle, but when he giggled like it was entertaining, he portrayed an image of himself as a cold-hearted person.\u201cYes, Master. I\u2019d like to report it to you. He didn\u2019t pay off the whole balance, but it was big enough to save his house from being seized. It happened this afternoon, and therefore, I am unable to include it in the report.\u201d\u201cThe amount of cash must come from Etman.\u201d said Matthias. He continued,\u201cLinda Etman.\u201dMatthias spoke the name slowly and gave a Bronx cheer.\u201cSo, what should I \u2026 .\u201d\u201cGood job. Call Hessen.\u201dInstead of responding, Matthias gave another command.Although he looked puzzled, Mark Evers followed the call, and he didn\u2019t ask anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And I think Dr. Etman was equally willing as well.\u201dNothing in his report seemed surprising.Jutting his chin, Matthias giggled and put down the file.Linda Etman was the scheme\u2019s brain.Matthias fixed on based from information he got about the stupid stranger he had met that morning.Mrs. Etman seemed to be pleased with his son\u2019s marriage at first glance. But who would have expected that her revealing-true-stripes would be much more toxic and menacing?Though it\u2019s unrelated to him, but Matthias didn\u2019t want to miss the spectacle of their household\u2019s intriguing drama.The look on Leyla\u2019s face gave an impression that she was all-knowing. Yet, in reality, she was completely clueless about how the world went about its job.Should he now refer to her as a fool?As he took Matthias\u2019 silence as a kind of opposition, Hessen braved to ask,\u201cMaster, if the your will is different\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Matthias cut him short. A sneer surfaced on his lips. \u201cI respect grandmother\u2019s wishes. I\u2019m not against it.\u201dFrom the time he said it, Matthias was inwardly in no doubt. Linda Etman must have planned the plot wisely without a lapse in her forethought.The chess piece she had bought with her cash was a kind of a moron, but not with her very precise and bold scheme. She wasn\u2019t na\u00efve enough to be ignorant that many people would gladly pay for Leyla Lewellin\u2019s lost tuition. She must already be aware of it just by looking at her husband.So what\u2019s her true purpose?Matthias touched the tip of his chin, having her inside his brain.Why would Linda Etman create such a fuss when she knew it\u2019s hardly possible to hinder Leyla from going to college with Kyle Etman even if her money was stolen?Matthias pursed his lips as if faced with an enticing riddle.\u201cPut someone on Mrs. Etman.\u201dAnnounced Matthias as he elegantly crossed his legs. His unamused visage was gentler than the recent command that escaped from him.\u201cMrs. Etman? Are we talking about Dr. Etman\u2019s wife, our family doctor?\u201d\u201cYes. Linda Etman. The doctor\u2019s wife.\u201dHis plainspoken reply made Hessen stagger somehow.\u201cThere\u2019s just one thing you need to report.\u201dMatthias rested his tired back against the sofa, a grin was tightly plastered around his face.He said,\u201cDoes Mrs. Etman meet with Leyla Lewellin separately? And what she talks about if she does.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The next day at dawn, the police officers returned to Arvis. They visited the Duke\u2019s manor and came upon Matthias by chance when he was descending from the stairway to the grand lobby.\u201cGood morning, Duke.\u201d A man with silver hair who was the commander of the police officers gallantly greeted him. \u201cWell, I felt ashamed by the theft incident.\u201dMatthias paused his steps in the middle of the hall, followed by Claudine and his attendants.Hessen made a subtle approach and said, \u201cThey want to ask permission to do another investigation to find eyewitnesses.\u201dMatthias nodded approvingly, \u201cSure, as much as you want.\u201d\u201cThank you, Duke.\u201dUpon the salute from their commander in the front row, the young officers at the rear dipped their heads quickly.Matthias was about to continue his stride when the silver-haired officer lifted his head and suddenly addressed him.\u201cSo, Duke.\u201dMatthias turned his gaze back, his face had a calm demeanor.\u201cDid you see anyone suspicious in the estate that morning?\u201dThe hesitant officer posed the question cautiously. Matthias took a second then made his way slowly up to him.\u2018I saw it.\u2019That was a simple answer he should have given, however, Matthias just smiled gracefully instead. He mulled his thoughts regarding Leyla Lewellin for a while;\u2018What should I do?\u2019What if he exposed Mrs. Etman and her early-bankrupt cousin\u2019s conspiracy to thwart her son\u2019s marriage now?Though the dire situation was on her hand, Linda Etman could still settle things as long as she wouldn\u2019t show her real fangs in front of Leyla. There would likely be some uproar, but Matthias believed that it would be for a brief moment; Dr. Etman and his son would strive to make sure the marriage will happen.However, Linda Etman was not the kind of person to give up.\u2018Then.\u2019Matthias looked up to the ceiling, and his gaze was drawn to the chandelier\u2019s light.Leyla Lewellin had gained a once-in-a-lifetime windfall; she would live happily ever after.Mrs. Etman wouldn\u2019t be able to meddle after the two of them moved into their newlywed residence in Ratz. Kyle Etman would be a devoted husband who loved and cherished his wife. With the spillage of his love, Leyla would be able to study as much as she wished and perhaps pursue her dream of becoming a scholar.Matthias raised his gaze to the ornate inscription chiseled on the ceiling, high above the chandelier lampshade.He surely could help Leyla if he were willing to trouble himself a bit. Before Linda Etman met her, Matthias had the privilege of meeting Kyle\u2019s mother ahead. Linda Etman would likely withdraw quietly without fanfare if she knew Duke Herhardt had discovered all her schemes, and at least to save her face.It seemed to be a viable way to lessen Leyla\u2019s wounds.Matthias gave the officer a once-over without a word being spoken. The senior officer stood in the state, interpreting that the Duke\u2019s silence was a reprimand for his rudeness.Matthias knew what makes Leyla happy And he could save her source of happiness just with a single flick of his fingers.\u2018So then\u2026?\u2019Matthias\u2019s lips were drawn onto another smirk.\u2018What pleasure can he gain from helping Leyla in finding her happiness?\u2019All that remained in him was the dreary roses season in the absence of her, which would be a fissure in his idyllic world.\u201c\u2026I saw no one.\u201dMatthias replied curtly, as his eyes narrowed while staring at the officer. The faces of people watching them were a mixture of worry and soon-relief.\u201cAh, yes. Well, thanks for your understanding, Duke. My apologies for all of my rudeness.\u201dMatthias accepted his apologies with a kind nod.\u201cHave you ever seen a stranger?\u201dThe officer\u2019s cooperative attitude had prompted him to pose the same question to Claudine, who stood behind Matthias.\u201cNo.\u201d Claudine answered without a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have any information that can help your investigation.\u201d She gave Matthias a passing glimpse before turning to look at the officer with a smiling face.After the case was closed, Matthias then resumed walking. The officers were left to question the employees, and Matthias got into the car which was parked outside the front door.\u201cYou didn\u2019t forget your promise, did you?\u201dClaudine kindly reminded him about their afternoon appointment; to join Riette for dinner after drinking tea together.\u201cOf course I remember, My Lady.\u201dClaudine\u2019s face lit up at Matthias\u2019 answer.The car sped away from the Estate\u2019s main gate, and soon departed the Estate. Matthias averted his gaze out of the window as the car drove down the road passing through the Doctor\u2019s residence.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Linda Etman wished for an amount of fun beyond her wildest dreams as a reward for her wait-and-see hard work.She donned a stylish lilac dress. Her face had some light y makeup, and her chosen hat was both classy and modest in style. Her appearance wasn\u2019t supposed to be showy. However, her elegance barely made her appear shabby in her attire today.Mrs. Etman admired her reflection in the mirror for the second before stepping out of the bedroom.Today she chose to walk rather than take the carriage.The place she was going to wasn\u2019t a crowded one. She would go unnoticed from all eyes, so she purposely cherry-picked a location distant from the cottage as she needed a quiet place to meet Leyla.Mrs. Etman was a million miles away as she waited for the carriage at the stop. She had started everything, and with no way to turn back, she was left with no choice but to go ahead.For her son, Kyle.The carriage came shortly when she sought to gather her wits. Mrs. Etman climbed into the carriage, and from her mouth came out a slight sigh within her breath.She was willing to go to any length for Kyle even if she were to become a villainess.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The tea shop that Mrs. Etman told was located a couple of miles away from the downtown area. Leyla arrived earlier than their appointment time, so she sat at the table near the sunny window, waiting for Mrs. Etman\u2019s arrival.Rows of brick houses draped in ivy were lined the opposite side of the narrow road, it was barely wide enough for a wagon to pass. Stores with rustic and plain signage padded the left and right sides of the alley.Likewise, the tea shop. The fading paint, worn furniture, and antique windows, as well as the tea-stained tablecloths, to name a few things. It was a place that didn\u2019t seem to be to Mrs. Etman\u2019s liking.\u2018Why did she choose this place?\u2019Leyla decided not to be biased despite her cryptic feelings. The more she thought about it, the more anxious she became. She was averse to adding more to her already overburdened mind\u2019s about the thievery.So, Leyla didn\u2019t want to continue assuming the worst that may happen.\u00a0 Mrs. Etman may need a private talk with her in a less crowded place. There was undoubtedly plenty of things to discuss, and\u2026Layla\u2019s thoughts that were trapped by the paralysis of analysis, were shortly disturbed by the clatter of a chime. She sprang to her feet, thinking it was Mrs. Etman who was coming. Instead, a young man walked into the shop. He was dressed conservatively in a suit complete with a fedora hat. He took a seat at a corner table and then opened a newspaper.Leyla slumped on her chair, her eyes were fixed on the tea stains on the tablecloth.She went to the police station today, but the case made no significant progress thus far. The lack of witnesses and evidence made it difficult for them to catch the thief. A policeman who took pity on her kindly advised; it\u2019s better not to cling to a shaky hope and find someone else to lend her money urgently.\u2018Should I?\u2019Dr. Etman, together with Duchess Norma and Lady Claudine, said that they would instead pay for her tuition. This morning, Madam Mona also visited her. She sweetly consoled Leyla and Bill by telling them if the thief wasn\u2019t caught, Arvis\u2019s workers had committed to fundraising for her college.Their kindness weighed heavily on her heart.When her deep sorrow was expressing itself through a sigh, the bell sounded again. Leyla jumped up from her chair reflexively and turned around.\u201cHello, Mrs. Etman.\u201dLeyla faintly smiled and bowed her head. The real Mrs. Etman was now standing in front of the opened door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She straightened her posture and put her hat on the other chair.Different nuances presented by Mrs. Etman when she saw her today left Leyla feeling uneasy.\u201cYou\u2019ve probably just returned from the police station.\u201d Mrs. Etman spoke first, \u201cHow\u2019s the investigation going on?\u201d\u201cThey haven\u2019t found any clues yet,\u201d Leyla said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not over yet, so I don\u2019t want to give up.\u201d\u201cWell, Leyla. I don\u2019t think it is a wise choice.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dTaken aback, Leyla asked once again when the tea she had ordered came. An awkward silence prevailed between the two until the waiter left after carelessly dropping the cup on the table.\u201cMay I ask what you mean, Ma\u2019am?\u201dLeyla breached the stillness first.\u201cYour money, I have it.\u201dMrs. Etman uttered those without a trace of guilt; her sight dipped to the clouded boiling steam of the teacup.Leyla\u2019s face was soon obscured by fluster. The words she had clearly heard sounded just like a delusion.Mrs. Etman lifted her gaze to Leyla and again firmly said, \u201cI was the one who stole your tuition.\u201d\u201cNo, that can\u2019t be. How could someone like you do that?\u201dHer stiff lips tried to smile. Leyla was unable to understand how Mrs. Ethman could make such a bad joke. Yet, Mrs. Etman\u2019s eyes were chilling.\u201cI hid it. I knew it was wrong, but I wanted to prevent you from going to college with Kyle.\u201d\u201cNo, that can\u2019t be-\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s stealing\u2014a pathetic and cruel theft. Nevertheless I did it. I want to keep you away from Kyle.\u201dLeyla\u2019s mind went completely blank. The gruesomely obvious truth said by Mrs. Etman jolted her awake, and she decided that she could no longer keep on living in denial.\u201cLeyla, I hate you.\u201dMrs. Etman stared at Leyla. Her disappointment and fatigue were epitomized in her greyish eyes.\u201cI really hate you to the point that I believe it would be better for me to be a criminal than to accept you as Kyle\u2019s wife.\u201d\u201cM-Mrs. Etman\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought you were a good girl who knew her place. I never thought that you were trying to use Kyle as a launching pad for your greed.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Ma\u2019am?\u201d Leyla fiercely shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not like that. How could I think like that about Kyle? I-I could never\u2026\u201dShe got the shock of her life and failed to notice her hands trembling at the edge of the table as well as her entire body starting to shudder.\u201cAre you friends with Kyle for this purpose? Using Kyle to go to college and marrying Kyle to improve your humble status in life?\u201dMrs. Etman chastised and cornered the wordless Leyla even more harshly. Though she knew that Leyla\u2019s feelings for Kyle stayed within the bounds of brotherhood or friendship in the past.Rather it was her son, Kyle, who fell head over heels in love with her, instead of Leyla. Leyla would not be caught up in this presumptuous affair if it weren\u2019t for her bumbling son. It was always this truth that wounded her self-esteem, and now it became the reason why she loathed Leyla even more.\u201cMy hatred for you has turned me into a thief. I resent you enough to do this, and that will never change. Do you think we can become a family like this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to tell me, Ma\u2019am?\u201dLeyla\u2019s voice trembled, but she kept a straight face before Mrs. Etman.\u201cYou must already know. You are a smart girl.\u201d Mrs. Etman stated briefly. Her eyes shone as cold as the untouched cup of cheap tea, while looking at her.\u201cIf you have something to say, just tell me,\u201d said Leyla. Her glassy, round eyes glimmered in the rays of sunshine that fell upon her despondent face. The ugly face she wished to conceal at the moment.\u201cYou can tell Kyle and the rest of the world that I did such despicable acts to stop you two from getting married.\u201dYou\u2019ll never be able to do that\u2013 Mrs. Etman looked confident through her words as she knew Leyla\u2019s personality.\u201cKyle will be very disappointed with me if you tell him regarding this,\u201d She recited. \u201cOur relationship will all but be broken, and maybe even our whole family\u2019s harmony.\u201dMrs. Etman\u2019s expression became colder as she saw Leyla stiffening.\u201cSince all of this has happened, it makes no difference whether you keep this a secret or tell Kyle everything. You and Kyle won\u2019t be able to get married. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d\u201cDo you hate me so much that you have to do this\u2026?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I already tell you? I really hate you.\u201dMrs. Etman rose from her seat and walked away.\u201cI hate you terribly. You pushed me to take such an extreme choice; I really despise you, Leyla.\u201dMrs. Etman stared at her with a steely gaze. Her eyes could not hide her contempt.\u201cI will refund your money after the registration date.\u201dShe swallowed the curse words that were already on the tip of her tongue, knowing Leyla would have understood; that she should leave Kyle without wasting time or making a scene out of it.Mrs. Etman was about to turn around when she groaned and lowered her eyes down.\u201cToday, I\u2019m very resentful of Mr. Remmer.\u201dShe said,\u201cWhy did he have to take you in and create such a tragedy in Arvis ?\u201dThose last words\u2026\u2026. hit Leyla the hardest.Her eyes froze and then turned glassy in a blink.Mrs. Etman strolled out of the tea parlor leisurely, leaving the poor little girl behind, who didn\u2019t weep till the very end.In her wake a tinge of pleasure and guilt was clinging like a shadow on the tips of her toes as she went.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*He saw Leyla.Her petite frame was crouched down beneath the blooming dry cottonwood tree on the roadside leading to the manor.Matthias, who was peering out the car window, did recognize her figure. All he could see was her back, but he felt confident that it was her.\u201cDoesn\u2019t that girl under that tree look like Leyla?\u201dThe driver frowned as he kept an eye on a girl he seemed to know.\u201cIs she sick?\u201dMark Evers, the Duke\u2019s aide, wondered as well so his voice was filled with concern.Meanwhile, their car edged closer to Leyla, who was curled up on the ground. Leyla quickly stumbled up and straightened stiffly when she sensed their upcoming approach. She bent her head so deep that they couldn\u2019t see her swollen face, but it was noticeable that she wasn\u2019t fine.Following that, Mark Evers continued to look out the car window before turning his gaze to the rear seat. He was reluctant to ask his Master, but his eyes were filled with hope that they could stop the car for a moment and help Leyla.The driver\u2019s thinking seemed to be in tune and he steadily slowed down the car\u2019s speed.Matthias glanced outside the car window at the slow-moving scenery beyond. Leyla was leaning against the trunk of the tree with her head down.She was crying.Matthias was sure of what he had seen on her face. Nobody else in this world had a better understanding of Leyla Lewellin\u2019s tears than he did.Matthias clammed up. He turned his gaze away from the car window in place of his answer.His assistant couldn\u2019t add any more words, with only a sad expression on his face. The driver, likewise, accelerated the car\u2019s speed to comply with his Master\u2019s wishes.Matthias immensely enjoyed Leyla\u2019s tears, as he always did.It entertained him. But, he wanted to monopolize her tears for his own pleasure.The idea of someone else having to step in to create those kinds of entertainment wasn\u2019t pleasurable.The car fled the scene, leaving Leyla alone with her tears, and soon stopped at the Mansion\u2019s entrance.Matthias stepped out of the limousine, with a face that appeared more relaxed.\u2018Linda Etman, has she taken action?\u2019That was the only explanation he could think of for Leyla to cry until her shoulders sagged. And his guess seemed to be right. It was proven by Hessen, who approached him with a concerned face.\u201cMaster, I have something to report.\u201dHe spoke secretly in a hushed voice as he walked beside Matthias.\u201cIt is an unbelievable story; I\u2019m at a loss for words\u2026\u201dWhen the voice of his capable butler, who seldom panicked, shook a little, Matthias knew that Mrs. Etman had lived up to his expectations.\u201cI\u2019m going to the office.\u201dMatthias said so in matter-of-factly, gentle voice.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cGot cold during summer, huh? It\u2019s all because of that damn thief that you\u2019re sick like this.\u201dBill who strutted around Leyla\u2019s bed said.He became concerned when Leyla said that she was ailing and after he saw her going to bed early last night.Leyla said she had a cold and would recover with a bit of rest, but in Bill\u2019s opinion, her condition did not seem to be getting any better.\u201cYou can\u2019t be like this. Mr. Etman\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dLeyla struggled to rise from the bed when Bill was about to turn around. She was shivering even with her thick pajamas, even though the weather had been relatively warm since it was still the wee hours of the morning, she looked as if she had gotten ill overnight.\u201cNo, Uncle. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cI just wanted to call the Doctor because you\u2019re sick? Why? Did you have a fight with Kyle?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cEven though you fought with Kyle, but Dr. Etman\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle, please.\u201d Leyla\u2019s clammy hand, drenched in a cold sweat, groped Bill\u2019s clothes. \u201cI just need a little rest. That\u2019s it. Please let me be.\u201d\u201cLeyla\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ll get better soon. Please?\u201dBill could no longer stay stubborn in the face of her desperate begging. He had a hunch it had to be related to Kyle, but he wasn\u2019t in a place to unearth it.He grudgingly nodded, and Leyla seemed relieved just then. Bill could feel a searing pain in his heart when he saw her lying limp on the bed as if she\u2019d fainted.\u201cRight, eat well! Sleep well! I should\u2019ve said that!\u201d Bill yelled aloud, \u201cI\u2019m going to sort it all out. I was on the verge of bursting within now!\u201d He pulled up the blanket\u2019s seam with careful gestures that contrasted with his rough hand and then put a wet towel on her feverish forehead.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart. Even if I can\u2019t catch and kill the thief, I will pay your tuition in some way\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle.\u201dLeyla\u2019s frail voice blended with her heated breaths.\u201cPlease stay here. Don\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d\u201cYou are thinking negatively again.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Uncle.\u201d\u201cWhat gibberish are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIt was because of me.\u201d\u201cIf you keep saying that, I\u2019ll get angry. I\u2019ll come back for sure.\u201dBill regarded Leyla as lying and babbling, and then heaved a deep sigh that silenced her. \u201cFirst, take a rest, Leyla. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dBill shut the window in Leyla\u2019s room and draped the curtains to cover it.\u201cI\u2019m stuffy\u2026 Please open it up a bit.\u201dLeyla, who was shivering from the cold, asked him once again to open it. Her stubbornness persisted even as she lay weak on the bed.Bill had to yield to her pigheadedness for the nth time. Again he rolled up the curtains a bit and partly opened the window, and finally, Leyla closed her eyes.\u201cIf your fever\u2019s not coming down by the evening, whatever you say, I\u2019ll call Mr. Etman. Got it?\u201dHe threatened her, but Leyla stayed quiet as if she hadn\u2019t heard him.Bill then reluctantly left the house, leaving Leyla, who was already dozing off like a log.He hastened off, determined to complete today\u2019s job as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Matthias suddenly realized that this morning, when he was gazing down at the rose garden without Leyla Lewellin.He had his doubts if she would show herself up for now, after being such a downer. Matthias had guessed it at the moment he heard Hessen\u2019s report in his office last night. Nevertheless, witnessing Leyla\u2019s absence with his own two eyes had given him some annoyance.\u2018She\u2019s pretty damn stupid.\u2019While laughing, Matthias rolled down the thin curtain then turned around.Linda Etman\u2019s heist was a ruse.Breaking Leyla Lewellin\u2019s heart and tarnishing her pride was her true purpose. She devised another plan after her failure to stop his son;\u00a0It would be Leyla who needed to be stopped.Matthias delightedly applauded and gave a hats off to Mrs. Etman\u2019s great approach. She had a superb hold on her opponent and stabbed her blade precisely on the target.Her hostility towards Leyla bestowed him with a lot more entertainment than he had expected. Matthias couldn\u2019t keep the laughter from escaping his lips as he listened to Hessen\u2019s report yesterday night.His leisurely weekend morning felt particularly lengthy and stodgy. After changing his clothes, Matthias was once again gazing out of his window while drinking his coffee. Only Bill Remmer and the garden\u2019s employees were there, but Leyla was nowhere to be seen.Was he too greedy in his desire for someone as pathetic as her?Matthias took a little morning stroll while mocking her sorry state of affairs. Usually, he would stop by the annex to swim in his spare time. The servants who were well acquainted with their Master\u2019s routines would flee as soon as they saw him approaching.He wished to see Leyla cry so he could have some good time today.As he was taking pleasure as the wind blew in, Matthias happened to arrive at the gardener\u2019s cottage. The house without Leyla lounging on the porch while reading a book or doing chores diligently in the yard, was much too quiet.Matthias\u2019 annoyance rose a little. It was when a white pigeon suddenly flew into the house.The bird flew straight towards the window at the back of the cottage as if it had a specified destination. Without a second\u2019s hesitation Matthias made a beeline to where the bird had passed. It perched calmly in the half-opened window, and he noticed a note attached to the bird\u2019s leg.Beyond the window was Leyla\u2019s room.The pigeon didn\u2019t flee as Matthias approached it.\u2018Carrier pigeon?\u2019Matthias looked at the bird with a scowl before gently catching it.Although being in human hands, the pigeon was very docile. Matthias stared carefully at the note the bird brought before a sudden cry from the window jarred him out from his muse.Matthias lifted his head, and he found Leyla sniveling and laying in bed like a dead person in her room that he had previously thought was empty.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla opened her eyes and laid still, her gaze was glued to the ceiling for some time.The room was lathered in blinding light. The sound of birds chirping in the tree outside the window was clear and lively , like the summer sunshine in the morning.As her dreamlike senses reawakened one by one, the bitter truth that she had forgotten due to her sickness slowly revived.\u2018How strange\u2026\u2019Leyla felt more at ease when the reality before her eyes grew clearer. The plethora of emotions that had filled a gap in her breath melted away in the guise of cold sweat and tears that broke out without her realizing it.It had been about two\u2026 No, three days had passed.Leyla was counting how much time she had spent laying on bed before slowly raising her body and sitting down. She momentarily felt a little bit groggy but soon regained her composure.She took a look at her bed sheet and thought that it needed to be laundered. The window sills should be wiped as they have become dusty. The dish that Uncle Bill had washed before wasn\u2019t clean enough, so she had to polish it again to get rid of any residual stains, and\u2026For a short spell, Leyla was stunned and closed her eyes, thinking of the many tasks she needed to do. When she reopened her eyes, she calmly decided that one thing should take priority above all else.She has to meet Kyle.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYou can\u2019t go around like this yet, Leyla. You should rest!\u201dKyle speeded up his steps when he spotted Leyla sitting by the stream.Leyla was looking down at her reflection in the water, slowly raising her head to face him. She was pale-faced, with visible symptoms of sickness.\u201cWhy did you come all the way here?\u201d Kyle hurriedly walked over to her side.\u201d I can meet you at home.\u201dWith her knees clasped together, Leyla was sitting on a wide, flat rock by the river. Her wavy, silky golden hair, which draped naturally over her slender shoulders, was like a part of the gleaming afternoon sun.\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dLeyla spoke as she stared at him solemnly, without her usual smile.\u201cSo, what amazing thing are you going to say?\u201dKyle laughed on behalf of her, who showed no sign of mirth. Leyla gazed at him without a word, turning up her nose to join in the laughter. Without the slightest hint of a bad feeling, Kyle broadened his grin.\u201cMeeting somewhere else like this is nice at times, but you\u2019re still unwell. That\u2019s what concerns me.\u201d\u201cKyle.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I had something to convey as well. How fortunate we are to be able to talk here.\u201d\u201cKyle.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the stolen money, Leyla. Tomorrow my father is going to Ratz. Your tuition will\u2013\u201d\u201cKyle, I\u2019m not going to college.\u201dKyle\u2019s words were cut off by Leyla.\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dKyle, who was sitting beside her and watching the river flow, tilted his head. Both exchanged glances. A heavy silence rang between them in a moment as their trapped gazes were locked on each other.\u201cI\u2019m not going to College.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? You passed that difficult exam! Don\u2019t worry about the tuition fees. Leyla please, don\u2019t be so stubborn like th-\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t marry you either.\u201dLayla straightened her knees and re-wrapped her fallen scarf around her neck.\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here with Uncle Bill, and live the life I\u2019ve always dreamt of. I\u2019m sorry, Kyle. I should have told you this from the beginning\u2026.but I\u2026 \u2026 I was blinded by greed for a moment.\u201d\u201cGreed?\u201d\u201cYes, even though I always pretended I didn\u2019t want to, deep down I really wanted to go to College and continue studying. So I decided to get married with the belief that it was possible. In simpler words, to use you on the way.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll believe such a lie?\u201dKyle scoffed coldly, but Leyla didn\u2019t seem to be shaken.It would be great if everything was a lie.A bitter smile stole over her trembling lips. For a small span of time, Leyla believed it was just sympathy or pity, but she soon got an understanding otherwise.Kyle Etman viewed Leyla Lewellin as a romantic partner.He proposed to her with the heart of a lover. But she accepted him with the heart of a friend.It was a pack of lies if she said that she was not greedy on the inside. It was precisely that fact which sank Leyla\u2019s heart even deeper.\u201cI know you, Leyla. You\u2019re not that kind of person.\u201dKyle leaped to his feet, his towering shadow looming over her.\u201cYou love me. Do I look like an idiot who doesn\u2019t even know that?\u201d\u201cI love you.\u201dLeyla said; she made no denials.\u2018Is Kyle someone I love?\u2019\u2018Yes, she does love him.\u2019\u00a0Leyla would nod her head repeatedly to answer that question. Even if she was asked 1,000 times, she was willing to nod every time with the same answer.\u201cAs my best friend, as an older brother, or sometimes as a younger brother. I love you so much, Kyle.\u201dLeyla remained unflinching even as she beheld Kyle\u2019s growing hardened face.She had to.\u201cBut I know this is not the kind of love you want. I\u2019m sorry Kyle, but I can\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can love you like that. I cannot marry you with this kind of heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t care.\u201dKyle\u2019s throat cramped as he swallowed his spit.\u201cWhatever kind of love it is, as long as it is love, I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s okay even if it isn\u2019t the kind of love I\u2019m looking for, Leyla.\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201dLeyla slowly lifted herself up. Their gazes were riveted between the howl of the forest wind. As she looked at the water that had been blown away by the wind, shaping small ripples on its surface, Leyla caught her breath.Not far from the cottage, this wooded creek was the playground for little Kyle and Leyla. Amidst her fear of water, she was able to dip her feet in the stream that barely reached her knees. Rather than the Schulter River, Leyla enjoyed visiting this place more.She used to read her book on a boulder shaded by a tree, and Kyle would explore the brook, catching crayfish or small fish. He would collect lovely freshwater clams or pebbles, both of which were her favorites.They laughed a lot. Those were always fun and heartwarming moments.The time when she loved him was like that.There were so many pristine memories that were more glorious than playing in the water\u2019s ripples. But still, that time of love was irreplaceable; it would stay within her forevermore.\u2018Even so, I still have to lose you.\u2019\u201cI can\u2019t do it. I want to stop.\u201d Leyla dropped her head to hide her reddened eyes. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Kyle. I should\u2019ve told you from the beginning.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s your only reason, don\u2019t even say that. This world is teeming with people who marry without love. Still, you love me. That\u2019s enough.\u201dKyle approached her and wrapped her shoulders in his grip.\u201cYou use me? Fine. Using me doesn\u2019t matter either.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like this.\u201d\u201cAs long as it\u2019s you, I\u2019m fine. If I can be of any help, feel free to use me.\u201d\u201cKyle!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alright as long as you don\u2019t desert me.\u201d Kyle\u2019s eyes began to flush.Leyla clenched her fists, attempting to fortify her wounded heart.\u201cI hate that. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\u201cIf you really want to go to College. If you\u2019re so desperate enough to use me, then you shouldn\u2019t let me go.\u201d\u201cKyle\u2026 I want to marry someone I love as a man and a lover. The thought of marrying you and going to Ratz made me realize that.\u201dThe vilest things she had been struggling to keep from saying eventually slipped out of her lips. Kyle\u2019s pupils dilated at her reply.\u201cI want to marry such a person and live without shame. My dream to feel that, that kind of love outweighs my ambition to attend college with you.\u201d\u201cLeyla.\u201d\u201cI had thought about using you, and pretending it was alright until the end, but then I felt like I would be ashamed of this choice for the rest of my life. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll regret it. I\u2019m not happy about living in a guilt fantasy.\u201d\u201cLeyla Lewellin!\u201d\u201cIf I make such a choice, I fear it would taint my time and my heart, which loves you as a friend and a family member. I hate it the most and am scared of its occurrence.\u201dHer heartfelt voice was faintly shaking.When the time came for her to become a grownup, she made the most childish decision she could imagine.Leyla ballooned her dream of attending college together for fear of losing him. But, in the end, this marriage turned out to be a genuine mistake that garnered her much regret.Mrs. Etman was entirely right. The moment she accepted Kyle\u2019s proposal, her relationship with him had already crossed the line of no return.Mrs. Etman\u2019s resentment towards her was too much for her to endure. Leyla couldn\u2019t separate Kyle from his beloved mother; moreover, she didn\u2019t want Uncle Bill to get hurt.The trigger had already been pulled; the only thing that can be gained by revealing the truth would be a gash in everyone\u2019s heart. Leyla felt her body had been drained out of all the water after shedding so many tears, and there was no turning back at the end of the road.So she had to turn around at this point, in silence.It was the only way to save her last semblance of pride, Kyle\u2019s family, and Uncle Bill\u2019s heart.\u201cLet me have that dream, Kyle.\u201dLeyla whispered as she looked at Kyle.\u201cWe\u2026 Let\u2019s do that\u201d.\u2018So, let us bid farewell to those precious sparkling days and become adults.\u2019Leyla let out a quiet sigh against voicing what she intended to say. Her faintly heated breath flowed through her parched lips.\u2018Don\u2019t cry.\u2019Tears didn\u2019t spring up in her eyes, fortunately. The spell she had learned along the way somehow had shown its worth.\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201dKyle, who was standing still, grabbed Leyla by the wrist as she passed him. His big, hot hands were shaking.No answer.Leyla opened her tightly-closed eyes and pushed his hand away.Kyle\u2019s hand fell off so easily. His grip on her wrists had lost its strength.Leyla walked away with weightless steps, leaving Kyle behind , who was standing stiffly staring at the stream.Her misty-eyed gleamed a shade of red, but they were held back until the moment she arrived at the cottage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mrs. Etman could foresee the ending of the two of them based on her son\u2019s condition, who was confined to his room with his lips clamped shut.\u201cMadam, the Young Master skipped lunch today as well.\u201d With a worried face, the housekeeper reported to Mrs. Etman, who had just come down from the second floor.\u201cLeave him alone. He will also have a hard time swallowing food when having a breakdown.\u201dMrs. Becker\u2019s eyes widened at Mrs. Etman\u2019s unexpected response regarding her son. She seemed overjoyed, even though her son had skipped every meal since yesterday. But Mrs. Becker decided not to ask further, knowing that her milady would seldom reveal the actual reason, so she just bowed her head and walked away instead.Mrs. Etman visited the garden after a long absence to tend to the flowerbed. The garden at Etman\u2019s house was brimming with exquisite and different kinds of roses which were imported from Arvis\u2019s shrubbery. She received several roses from Elysee von Herhardt, who exclusively gifted the flowers to her closest wives.She was the only woman without a title in Carlsbar who had fellowship with the two Duchesses of the Herhardt household and several people didn\u2019t know how proud she was of it. She believed that Kyle\u2019s marriage to the lower-noble-lady that was introduced by Norma von Herhardt would enhance the Etman family\u2019s social standing.How hard she toiled to get here, now her husband and son tried to thwart her efforts, only for the sake of one girl named Leyla.Linda Etman readily admitted that she had done a great wrong towards that poor girl. But she had no regrets. For Kyle\u2019s sake, she could have performed far more gruesome acts than that. Leyla would be wise to seek a husband who was on par with her.Mrs. Etman entered the living room, carrying a bouquet of roses that blended harmoniously in hues. She was delicately arranging the flowers in the vase when Dr. Etman came in.\u201cKyle? Is he still doing that?\u201d\u201cYes. Sounds like he went through a lot of trouble.\u201d\u201cI think something happened between him and Leyla.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to see Leyla.\u201dMrs. Etman spoke calmly as she centered the vase on the table.\u201cYou?\u201d\u201cDid you forget? Kyle is my son as well.\u201dShe smiled as she stood.\u201cHe is the son I love much more than you.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla was sitting in the corner of the yard washing a big pot when Mrs. Etman visited her. Her appearance was soaked; the splashing jet of pump water drenched her apron, sleeves, and the crown of her head.\u201cHello, Mrs. Etman.\u201dLeyla got up and greeted her without expressing surprise.\u201cPlease come i-\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo. You don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d Mrs. Etman shook her head after thoroughly scrutinizing Leyla from head to toe and handing her the leather bag she had brought.Leyla could tell what was within without even looking at it. She came close to expressing her gratitude, as she always did after receiving something. But Leyla decided to swallow her words and accept the money bag quietly.Seeing Leyla shut her lips after receiving it, Mrs. Etman furrowed her brow in annoyance.\u201cJudging from the expression on your face, you seem to have a lot to say.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Leyla answered her without a grain of hesitation. She refused to bow her head, which she did the last time at the teahouse.Mrs. Etman erupted in laughter, \u201cWell, go ahead. I\u2019ll understand.\u201d She flashed a kind smile through her lips which were stiff from the bitterness. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re done talking to Kyle.\u201d\u201cYou already know, and that is why you returned our money, right?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mrs. Etman\u2019s eyes fluttered at Leyla\u2019s bold tone, which contrasted markedly with her usual self.\u201cDon\u2019t worry; I made no mention of you.\u201d\u201cWorry?\u201d\u201cYes. You appear worried that I will tell Kyle of what you really did that day.\u201d\u201cHuh. I had no idea you were such a daring child.\u201d\u201cMy apologies if I sounded rude. I just wanted to tell you that Kyle doesn\u2019t know what happened that day.\u201dLeyla bowed her head to express her apology.\u201cI didn\u2019t tell Kyle,\u201d she said. As her gaze returned to Mrs. Etman again, her eyes grew fiercer. \u201cI won\u2019t ever tell him in the future as well.\u201dEven mentioning Kyle\u2019s name made Leyla\u2019s heart ache. The memory of Kyle\u2019s back, which she had abandoned by the river that day, would forever change her life. It would undoubtedly stay as a pain inside that will last for the remaining of her days.\u201cI\u2019m going to do it for Kyle, not for anyone else.\u201d\u201cFor Kyle?\u201dMrs. Etman was snide, but Leyla didn\u2019t seem to mind.\u201cYes. I know. I know that Kyle loves his mother very much. Whatever you do to me, you are Kyle\u2019s precious mother. So I want to protect the mother he loves.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help but marvel how a brat like you has lived this long wearing the mask of a sweet and kind faced child.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I offended you.\u201dLeyla again dipped her head politely. Mrs. Etman blanched in response to what she perceived to be a sign of ridicule.\u201cBut, I meant that sincerely. I just wanted to let you know that you have nothing to worry about.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a ballsy promise, so I\u2019ll try to believe it.\u201dMrs. Etman felt relieved but scrunched her eyes to disguise it.\u201cSince you said that you did it for Kyle, I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll explain to Kyle why you called off the wedding in a way that doesn\u2019t cause him undue pain.\u201d\u201cYes. I will do that. Instead, Mrs. Etman\u2026\u201dLeyla looked down at her money bag, then slowly lifted her gaze.\u201cI want you to apologize for one thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What? Apologize?\u201d\u201cYes. I can accept whatever you tell me, even if it\u2019s false, I will still accept it. But I want you to apologize for what you said about Uncle Bill.\u201dLeyla raged. Her hand holding the bag became pallid, but she did not attempt to revert.\u201cYou said that you hated Uncle Bill for bringing about such a tragedy into your life by raising me.\u201dMrs. Etman snorted as if she couldn\u2019t comprehend what she was saying. Again, Leyla badgered her into apologizing.\u201cPlease apologize for that.\u201dHer voice was soft yet insistent, borne on the wind of a beautiful summer evening.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias\u2019s lips broke in a grin as he leaned against the wall, having to eavesdrop on their interesting conversation.He just finished swimming when he suddenly stepped foot towards the gardener\u2019s cottage while on his way back home, expecting to see Leyla crying there. And Matthias had no regrets about making such a snap choice after witnessing a spectacle that was even more enthralling than her tears.He was eager to see what look Mrs. Etman would put on her face, but Matthias decided to be patient, knowing that his entrance would merely bring their fascinating play to an end.Matthias took a seat on the window frame leaning against Leyla\u2019s room window facing the backyard. He enjoyed watching the white pigeon pecking on its food as he awaited Linda Etman\u2019s answer.\u201cWhat people say is true; One\u2019s roots cannot be deceived\u201dAfter some silence, Linda Etman\u2019s voice became strained with a maddening rush that she couldn\u2019t hide.\u201cApologize? I\u2019d rather feel sorry for Mr. Remmer, that poor man who reared a child like you.\u201d\u2018Linda Etman, as one would expect.\u2019Pleased that his second prediction came true, Matthias petted the docile pigeon. He recalled seeing Leyla\u2019s figure through the window of his car a few days ago. It was all still fresh in his mind; she sobbed piteously, and her body was soaked in a cold sweat. She had difficulty breathing properly, and her shaking body appeared scruffy.\u201cVery pathetic.\u201dMatthias gave a mocking smirk. His twitching lips gleamed in crimson red.\u201cIf she has something to say, tell her, say it aloud. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dAfter he gently spoke to the pigeon, Matthias left the cabin, dumping the drudgery spectacle behind.Then, he decided.If Leyla couldn\u2019t provide him with some fun, he would simply\u00a0create his own.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The hearsay started from Mrs. Mona.\u201cHave you guys heard? The reason why Leyla and Kyle broke up.\u201dWhenever she encountered the other employees of the duchy, Mrs. Mona would return in her furious tone to tell the marvelous story she had overheard previously.\u201cIt was Mrs. Etman who stole Leyla\u2019s tuition from Mr. Remmer! The Postman just told me. She sent someone else to steal their money. She wanted to make Leyla drop out of College and cancel her marriage with Kyle!\u201dMrs. Mona held her breath momentarily as she spoke to add a dramatic effect, just like a popping firecracker.Everyone laughed in tandem, they were all blown away. Mrs. Mona was well-known as a chatterbox. She eschewed idle gossip and never failed to give a solid grounding for every one of her storylines.\u201cI know. You can\u2019t believe it. Because I was like that too at first. However, the police had arrested the person who acted as Mrs Etman\u2019s lapdog in stealing the money. The Postman, Mr. Berger saw the thief in person when he was delivering the letter to the police station. He heard what had happened from the policemen. I bet you would all be shocked to know who he is.\u201dMrs. Mona deliberately dropped her voice as she reached the story\u2019s most intriguing part.\u201cDo you all know Mr. Rayner? The businessman, who is also Mrs. Etman\u2019s cousin? Oh, my God, he was the thief!\u201d\u201cWhat, Mr. Rayner? That Daniel Rayner?\u201d\u201cYes! That Mr. Rayner!\u201dMrs. Mona\u2019s tone grew more spiteful as they all noisily parroted the question in disbelief.\u201cAnd after she stole the money, Mrs. Etman asked for a face-to-face meeting with Leyla, at some point she confronted her and said, \u2018How dare you marry my son?\u2019 A stranger who happened to overhear their quarrel became suspicious and reported it to the police, which led to his arrest.\u201dFollowing that, the story rolled about like fireworks dotting upwards the night sky.\u201cIndeed, she was a wicked woman. How could she do such a cruel thing to that poor child?!\u201dThe stunned looks on her audience\u2019s faces grew wider when Mrs. Mona raised her voice as she struggled to suppress her emotions.\u201cI knew it! There is no way that Leyla would ever give up on college or marriage without doing anything.\u201d\u201cHow could she have done such a horrible act? That noble Mrs. Etman.\u201dThe excited crowd flocked over to lend their voices. They all quickly developed into enthusiastic orators with the same veins as Mrs. Mona and began spreading the truth at the same speed.The word quickly traveled throughout Arvis\u2019s Mansion, needing less than half a day, to be precise.It was late afternoon when Mrs. Mona, who seemed to have subdued her fury, saw Bill Remmer who was calmly working in the garden.\u2018It seems, the dim-witted guy still doesn\u2019t know.\u2019Regardless of how excited Mrs. Mona was about relaying the story, she was unhappy since this matter concerned someone close to her.\u2018But Bill Remmer is like Leyla\u2019s father. He is someone who needs to know this better than anyone else.\u2019In her inner battle, Mrs. Mona made up her mind,\u201cYes. I have to tell him.\u201dFinalizing her decision, she began waddling towards the garden.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Come out now! Right now!\u201dKyle slowly raised his tired body. The man\u2019s thunderous yelling and whale-like voice was not a stranger to his ears.\u201c\u2026Uncle Bill?\u201dKyle sprang out of his bed in surprise. He hastily walked to the window and witnessed a quarrel between Bill Remmer and a housekeeper at the front door.\u201cWhat kind of commotion is this?\u201d Mrs. Etman appeared with a haughty yell.\u201cMrs. Etman, are you the damned thief? Is this an act that can be committed by someone who has been revered as a noble? No matter how much you hate Leyla, how could you do this?!\u201dKyle, who was rushing towards them to break up the brawl, suddenly stopped like a dead person in his tracks.Thief?Why did Uncle Bill mention the thief?To my mother?Kyle stood frozen in a conundrum as Bill spewed forth an implausible gruesome story in a fit of anger. His body suddenly became like a stiff board as he listened to those unbelievable utterances.\u201cNo-Nonsense\u2026 How could he accuse my mother of such a heinous crime\u2026\u201dMumbling blankly, Kyle lurched out of the room. He made his way down the stairwell in stumbling steps.He couldn\u2019t take Uncle Bill\u2019s persecution towards his mother, no matter how angry he was about the theft incident.\u201cDid Leyla say that?\u201dMrs. Etman asked sharply after Bill stopped screaming.\u201cGood grief, how could she slander me like that\u2026..\u201d\u201cDoes Leyla look like a child capable of telling such things?\u201dBill shouted out in tears when Kyle was about to step out to the front door.\u201cIf Leyla told me, my heart would not have been ripped asunder like this!\u201d\u201cIf you want to create a scene by uttering nonsense, go back now! Before I call the police!\u201d\u201cDo you dare to call the police?! Do you think you can bring the police when the postman saw your cousin being taken to the police station?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Wh-what?\u201dMrs. Etman staggered. She took a step back.\u2018Please, mother.\u2019Kyle prayed as he looked at his mother\u2019s back.\u2018Please say no, you\u2019re not the culprit, say that it was just a slander\u2019.Mrs. Etman kept mum, but her breathing was labored. Due to fear, her grip on the railing started to tremble.Kyle waddled towards his mother.\u201cMother.\u201dMrs. Etman was stupefied. Only after hearing his pained voice, she noticed her son\u2019s presence standing behind her.\u201cThat was not true, right?\u201d Kyle grabbed her arm. \u201cIt was just a misunderstanding, right? Tell me. ?\u201dKyle tried to laugh but failed. It was painfully obvious that this moment was real, yet a dense fog seemed to shroud his head.For him, the last couple of days were hellish. He visited, coaxed, and begged many times, but Leyla refused to change her mind. In his profound sadness, time was slipping away.Kyle had nonetheless pinned his vague hopes. His father, who went to Ratz, had already paid Leyla\u2019s portion of the tuition. He believed everything would be fine as long as he could persuade Leyla and assure her. So he planned to visit Leyla this evening and cajole her once again;\u2018If marriage was too much of a burden, then how about an engagement? Let\u2019s go to college together while we\u2019re engaged.\u2019Engaged\u2026That was enough for him.As time passed by, he believed that Leyla\u2019s feelings would grow into that of a lover. Thus, they would live happily ever after.But now\u2026.\u201cMother!\u201dKyle gasped as his voice was stymied by tears.Mrs. Etman froze and gazed down at the railing. Her face was pale and her lips were zipped tightly.That moment, Dr. Etman arrived at the scene. He got out of the car alongside two police officers. Mrs. Etman\u2019s legs buckled when she saw them and collapsed on the floor.Dr. Etman begged the police to allow him to approach his wife alone. Strained expressions were plastered on his face.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Remmer.\u201d He went towards Bill Remmer first and took off his hat. \u201cEven if I had ten mouths, I have nothing to say. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dKyle\u2019s eyes welled up with despair as he watched his father apologizing repeatedly.\u201cAs you can see, the situation is dire now, and it seems difficult to have a proper talk. Can I meet you and apologize again after things have calmed down?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s do that.\u201dBill Remmer furiously wiped his tears and nodded his head. As he stepped back, the officers came forward.\u201cWhy did you do that, dear?\u201d Dr. Etman\u2019s gaze fell coldly on her crouched wife.\u201cNo. It\u2019s not what you think\u2026..\u201d\u201cDaniel is at the police station. He confessed everything. You bribed him.\u201dAs soon as that name escaped from her husband\u2019s lips, Mrs. Etman\u2019s lips clamped shut. She had nothing to say to defend herself.\u201cSo don\u2019t try to lie to me, Linda.\u201d\u201cDear!\u201d\u201cAre you going to pretend that you accept Leyla and do things like that in the future? You are not just my wife, but also Kyle\u2019s mother!\u201dDr. Etman eventually lost his temper. An uncontrollable surge of fury he couldn\u2019t suppress anymore distorted his face.\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault!\u201dMrs. Etman lashed out irately as she cried.\u201cWhy? Why the hell did you allow Leyla to wreak destruction on my life?!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of rubbish are you spewing now that you\u2019ve committed such a crime?\u201d\u201cNo. It was all your fault! As I had already said, I disliked her from the beginning! I would not have come this far if you had just listened to me back then! If it was not for you, I, I\u2026\u2026.\u201dA loud sob escaped her mouth, and the hands covering her face soon became doused with tears.With a sigh, Dr. Etman roused his sobbing wife. The officers showed their respect for the notable doctor by letting him bring his wife inside the car.Kyle stood motionless, watching the nightmarish scene with his eyes wide open.Before long, a thick layer of dusk began to cloak the blue yonder, and he had not yet awoken from that hellish dream.Kyle shut his eyes in the dazzling dusk of the twilight.He wished the entire world would be buried in a blanket of darkness.It was his only hope at the moment.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cUncle, please don\u2019t cry.\u201dLeyla gently placed her handkerchief on the table. Bill, who had been staring at his beer glass sternly as if it was his enemy, lifted his head in bewilderment.\u201cCrying?! Who is crying?\u201dAlthough he vehemently denied it, Bill wiped the wet corners of his eyes with Leyla\u2019s handkerchief.His untouched food had cooled on the plate, but no one was urging him to have the meal. Both Bill and Leyla were mindful; they couldn\u2019t eat.While Bill gulped and emptied his glass, Leyla leaned her gaze at the table\u2019s edge. Her face looked drained.Leyla was unaware of what had occurred until she heard the words of comfort from Arvis\u2019 employees, who came to the cottage. Mrs. Etman was unlikely to divulge the incident on her own, and she also kept her mouth sealed. Nevertheless, everything about that day was eventually disclosed.Leyla had no clue who had informed the police about their private talks. That day, the old tea shop on the outskirts of town had no other visitor except for her, Mrs. Etman, and a stranger.\u2018Who leaked the rumors then? Who the hell is he?\u2019Leyla could not even make a hazy guesstimate, no matter how hard she thought about it.Whatever the case, one thing\u2019s for sure; she had inflicted an irreversible wound on Kyle. She had broken his heart which she wanted to protect. Mrs. Etman was taken to the police station by several officers accompanied by Dr. Etman. And Kyle was there witnessing it all.\u201cLeyla, don\u2019t cry.\u201d Bill put down his glass and handed a handkerchief to her.\u201cCrying, who\u2019s crying?\u201dAs Bill did a while ago, Leyla stubbornly denied and wiped the corners of her reddened eyes.\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t know about the world out there, but I encouraged and pushed you till you suffered painful things like this.\u201d\u201cIf you say that, Uncle, you\u2019re going to make me upset.\u201d\u201cMarriage is\u2026 Yes. I\u2019d rather not let you marry. Right, it\u2019s better like this.\u201dLeyla stayed quiet, but she nodded her head deeply. Her lips glistened faintly as she smiled, dampened by her tears.\u201cBut, I want you to attend College, Leyla. Dr. Etman had already paid for your tuition, and returning the money to them is the same as me paying for your tuition. College has nothing to do with Kyle.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIf you need something like a house or boarding house, I\u2019ll give you more money. My finances might be a bit tight, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll work harder to cover all of your living costs\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle, I will go to college, \u201d said Leyla. \u201cI am not giving up. But, not now.\u201dShe reached out and held Bill\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a teacher.\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m going to save money and retake the exam once I\u2019m able to afford to study in the Capital. That was my original goal and dream. It was just that the shortcut blinded me for a while, but now I\u2019m back on my track.\u201d\u201cBut you can\u2019t just give up after what you\u2019ve been through. You have already been accepted into College.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you believe me?\u201d Leyla smiled peacefully, \u201cEven if I take the exam again, I believe I will still pass it. At that time, I will be accepted with a higher grade to qualify for the scholarship. You will see.\u201d\u201cLeyla, my dear\u2026.\u201d\u201cUncle, didn\u2019t you tell me? I\u2019ll become a good adult. So please trust me one more time.\u201d\u2018This good child, what should I do with her?\u2019Bill opined that it would have been better if she had cried, rather Leyla laughed merrily. She seemed to have no idea that her smile had ripped a hole in Bill Remmer\u2019s heart.\u2018And Kyle, what should I do with you?\u2019Bill\u2019s shoulders began to shake as he couldn\u2019t control his overwhelming mixed feelings. He hurriedly dropped his head, not wanting to show his pitiful state. His thick, hot tears streamed down his face and dropped over the table.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Uncle.\u201dLeyla rose from her chair and approached him.\u201cI\u2019m really fine.\u201d She hugged him with her petite arms. \u201cReally. I don\u2019t want to punish Mrs. Etman. It\u2019s fine now that we\u2019ve got our money back.\u201d Leyla comforted him with a gentle voice and patted him on the back.\u2018What should I do with you?\u2019Tears threatened to spill from his eyes as his hard-strangled words seared from his throat.Bill nodded as he wiped away the tears.He judged what she did to be unpardonable. Bill, however, felt uneasy the whole time after he saw Mrs. Etman collapsing in front of him and Kyle looking so pale. Linda Etman was Kyle\u2019s mother, regardless of how wicked she was. To Leyla, she was like a second mother, as she was the mother of Leyla\u2019s precious Kyle.\u201cLet\u2019s do that. If that\u2019s how you feel, then I\u2019m fine, Leyla.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m curious as to what kind of nonsense this is.\u201dAfter taking a sip of wine, she wiped her lips together in disgust at the vulgar story.\u201cI have to wrap up my relationship with Mrs. Etman.\u201dElysee von Herhardt responded similarly to her mother-in-law.Linda Etman was locked at the police station yesterday night and just got released this noon after Bill and Leyla visited the station, stating they didn\u2019t want to prolong the case since they had already got their money back.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Dr. Etman was greatly disgraced by this event. He\u2019s a good person, but should we change our doctor?\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s not Dr. Etman\u2019s fault, I suppose we don\u2019t need to. This kind of scandal will quieten down after a while.\u201d Duchess Norma resolutely voiced her unwavering faith in Dr. Etman.\u201cI hope Kyle doesn\u2019t get hurt by this.\u201dShe showed some sympathy while speaking about Kyle Etman.\u201cNow that things have turned into such a mess, I regret allowing the child to stay at Arvis.\u201dElysee von Herhardt blurted out at the end of her meal.\u201cLeyla created this whole situation. .\u201dShe looked at Claudine as if seeking an accord.\u201cRight, I think so too.\u201d Claudine gladly nodded her head. \u201cAlthough unintentionally, Leyla has ruined the Etman\u2019s household.\u201dAs she said it firmly, Claudine glanced across the table. Although he was a soft-spoken guy by nature, Matthias was unusually quiet during dinner tonight. Nevertheless, he showed no signs of being strange, rather he seemed to be as gentle as ever.Like the dinner that came to an end, the scandal that had ensnared Arvis manor would soon be forgotten.Mathias went right to his bedroom instead of going to his study.He had instructed Hessen to send the spy who tailed Linda Etman to the police station that day. Matthias wanted him to testify against the theft when the postman was scheduled to deliver the documents to the station.Given the postman\u2019s closeness to Arvis\u2019s employees, he expected the rumors were sure to spread like wildfire.Everything went smoothly according to his plan.And the Arvis\u2019s Chef, a well-known newsmonger, played the last key part in helping the postman with his whistleblower tasks.It was a clich\u00e9 ending, but Matthias had great fun.\u2018Did Linda Etman cry?\u2019Matthias\u2019s thoughts rummaged for that idea as he turned on the lamp near the window.\u2018Probably she did, like Leyla.\u2019That simple climax added another layer of excitement to his stage play.The marriage of Leyla Lewellin and Kyle Etman had now crossed the line of no return. Even if there was such a thing as love, their marriage has undoubtedly been ruled out. To keep it short, Leyla Lewellin had forfeited whatever luck she may have had.Matthias left the window and sauntered to the drink\u2019s cabinet. All of the beverages stored there were still unopened as he wasn\u2019t fond of alcohol.He took out the bottle of wine closest to him and poured the clear amber-colored liquor into his crystal glass.\u2018Leyla\u2019s wings have been cut off.\u2019Matthias pondered calmly as he turned around, with a glass of wine in his hand.\u2018So Leyla will stay inside the cage called Arvis.\u2019His satisfaction at knowing this fact had outweighed his rude awakening.Matthias spent a long time staring at his sleeping canary, snoozing in \u2018her\u2019 comfy cage. His gaze then wandered to the garden outside the window before returning to the golden liquor in his hand.His mood right now wasn\u2019t as bad as the one he had on the late spring night when he heard of Leyla\u2019s upcoming marriage to the doctor\u2019s son.That night was terrible as he remembered when the desire to kill someone took over his head for the first time in his life.Leyla and Kyle\u2019s love story had a better ending than the death of a person.Matthias put the drink he hadn\u2019t sipped on the table quietly.Even without having to borrow the effects of liquor, he was already aware of the way to erase the lump in his heart and his beautiful blues.He just needed to\u00a0own\u00a0her.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The case of stolen tuition, which made Arvis manor fall into a buzz, came to an end at the peak of summer.The matter was flawlessly settled, with Bill Remmer getting his money and Mrs. Etman avoiding punishment thanks to his goodwill. Even so, it wasn\u2019t enough to eradicate the consequences and her ruined afterimage from the public\u2019s mind.\u201cKyle.\u201dDr. Etman slowly opened the door of his son\u2019s room, who didn\u2019t respond to his knocking.Kyle was sitting quietly in front of the desk. He kept looking out the window even though his father approachied him.\u201cKyle.\u201d Dr. Etman called out his name for the second time and tapped him on the shoulder.Surprised, Kyle turned around. His face was worn to a frazzle.Dr. Etman slid his hand away from Kyle\u2019s shoulder and leaned on the edge of his desk.\u201cYour mother is a little better now.\u201d He said.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dKyle answered tersely.Mrs. Etman, who was bedridden from shock after being taken to the police station, drank and ate almost nothing. He was worried as his mother had been suffering from a high fever for several days, but fortunately, her illness had not worsened to a critical stage.\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for a house for you to stay in Ratz.\u201dDr. Etman calmly informed him and Kyle looked stumped.\u201cWhat do you mean by\u2026. house?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a house that\u2019s suitable for living alone, and it\u2019s furnished\u2026\u201d\u201cAm I going to College alone?\u201d Kyle asked with a peal of scornful laughter. \u201cWithout Leyla? After I hurt her like that\u2026 Am I going to College alone as if nothing happened?\u201d\u201cI understand how you feel, Kyle, but your stubbornness on this matter will only hurt Leyla more.\u201d\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s accept it, Kyle, that your relationship with Leyla is over. This is the best option for you and Leyla and also for everyone else. Both of you must live your own lives.\u201dDr. Etman sounded firm, even bordering on cold, ignoring Kyle\u2019s heartbreaking gaze. The situation itself was suffocating for his son, but precisely for that reason, he needed to address his son level-headedly.Nothing mattered more than protecting Kyle. He believed that Kyle\u2019s wounds would gradually fade away after leaving Carlsbar, distancing himself from Leyla, and getting acquainted with a new environment at the university.That was the sole hope Dr. Etman could have for the time being.\u201cYour mother was at fault, but it doesn\u2019t relieve us of responsibility either. We chose to overlook the fact that your mother\u2019s heart could never accept Leyla. You and I , we were the ones who drove her into that corner.\u201d\u201cBecause Leyla is an orphan and doesn\u2019t have a glamorous background, she cannot satisfy mother\u2019s snobbery, that was why Mother can\u2019t accept her? Is that what you meant?\u201d\u201cKyle, enough! Even if she\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s unacceptable to talk badly about your mother!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know anymore. Is she my Mother that I\u2019ve known and loved for so long? And I don\u2019t know why I have to go to college\u2026?\u201d\u201cAre you going to give up your life because of your failed first love?\u201d\u201cLeyla\u2026 Do you think she only means that much to me?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s not the case, you should strive to be more level-headed. The more you act like an idiot, the more painful it gets for Leyla!\u201d\u201cBut, I\u2019m unable to go alone without her.\u201d\u201cYou, and Leyla, are now past hope.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Kyle howled. \u201cThere must be a way. Somehow\u2026 If I beg, if I apologize, if I convince her otherwise\u2026\u201d\u201cWake up, Kyle Etman! Don\u2019t you already know that\u2019s impossible?!\u201dDr. Etman violently quaked his son\u2019s shoulder, his voice rose.Kyle shook his head in denial. He yanked his father\u2019s hand from his shoulder and fled from the room.Dr. Etman, who knew where he was going, decided not to chase after him.Even if it hurts him, he believed, that Kyle had to face reality beyond his hope.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The weather today was sweltering, but Leyla\u2019s attire was orderly groomed, bordering on stuffy.Her blouse\u2019s collar was neatly ironed, the buttons clicked to the neck, and her skirt was faultless, without even a single pleat. Not to mention the pantyhose that cocooned her slender legs.Her appearance didn\u2019t seem to be unkempt at the slightest; even the afternoon sun was diligently bathing the road in its scorching heat.Her cheeks were flushed crimson and out of breath due to the heat. However, Leyla walked gallantly, keeping her posture upright even after reaching a deserted street devoid of people.Leyla Lewellin these days earned sympathy from everyone wherever she went. People openly consoled her and spoke ill of Mrs. Etman. They kicked their tongue in the spleen, and few shed tears after hearing her heart-wrenching story.Similarly, today was no exception. The teacher at Gillis Girls\u2019 High School, whom Leyla met when seeking a teaching job, was the first person to express her pity with a heavy sigh.\u2018Indeed, Leyla. You have to cheer up and think realistically for the solution. It\u2019s sad, but what else can you do? Everything had already happened.\u2019She grabbed Leyla\u2019s hand and said words of comfort repeatedly. Likewise, the familiar faces she encountered in the city did the same.Her gratitude for them was tempered with some shame. Leyla was at a loss for words and just greeted them cordially with a faint smile on her face.Every time she did, Leyla tried not to assume things about the vague smiles that flickered on people\u2019s lips. It was fortunate that she didn\u2019t have to dwell on anything else since she was too busy maintaining her straight-grin mask.\u2018I wish I could cut you off some slack, but this is the best thing I could do right now.\u2019Gillis\u2019s teacher gave a sighing answer after consoling Leyla for a long time.All teaching positions at Carlsbar Primary School had already been occupied. Her last remaining option was to work in a small town about an hour away by train.Leyla eventually accepted the job after much deliberation. Given that commuting would be too exhausting, she needed to find a boarding house near the school. However, she would be able to return to Arvis on weekends. Perhaps after a year of teaching there, she would be offered the opportunity to relocate to a school in Carlsbar.Leyla took off her hat for a moment to recover her breath after arriving in front of the Arvis Estate\u2019s magnificent gateway.She had a harder time dealing with Uncle Bill than anyone else. Uncle Bill always gave her a somber gaze whenever she smiled in front of him. Hence, she couldn\u2019t shed a tear in his presence.\u2018Well, this is good news, so I suppose it\u2019s fine.\u2019Leyla strode along the path in a blue funk. Even if it didn\u2019t mean like she would be saying goodbye to Uncle Bill for good, she felt upset whenever she thought about attending a school that was too far away from home.As she walked, Leyla tried to make her smile a little brighter. She made her way to the garden, eager to tell Uncle Bill the news as quickly as possible.The moment she passed under the arching arbor of the rose garden, Kyle was already standing there, waiting for her.\u201c\u2026 Kyle?\u201dLeyla\u2019s pupils dilated. Kyle rushed up to her as if he were being chased by something and grabbed her wrist. He seemed to be a completely different person right now.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Leyla.\u201d\u201cGo where? Let go of my hand first and then we can talk!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s run away from here, just the two of us.\u201dKyle\u2019s grip, holding Leila\u2019s wrist, grew stronger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her eyes shook the moment she stared at Kyle\u2019s peaky face with his tousled hair and wrinkly clothes.\u201cDon\u2019t be like this, Kyle. We\u2019re now\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go anywhere. Let\u2019s go somewhere where just the two of us can become happy. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d Kyle harshly grabbed her hand and dragged her while mumbling like a lost person, closing his ears.Leyla\u2019s fierce resistance only made Kyle widen his stride ahead without budging.\u201cMr. Remmer! Mr. Remmer! Look over there! Leyla is being dragged away!\u201dA gardener who happened to be nearby witnessed the scene and exclaimed. Bill shifted his gaze to the direction he pointed at.Straightway, his face heated up.Bill threw his pruning shears and frantically chased after Kyle. The baffled employees in tandem quickly joined the bandwagon.\u201cKyle Etman! Let go of her hand right now!?\u201dBill shouted, as anger rose to the crown of his head, struck a chord like thunder. He slammed a punch in Kyle\u2019s face without delay. Kyle slumped and fell, but he dared not release his grip on Leyla\u2019s wrist.In the gusts of wind, Leyla\u2019s body also hit the dirt of the rose bed.\u201cLeyla!\u201dBill screamed in shock and hurried to assist Leyla in getting up. She had scratches on both of her cheeks and the back of her hands from thorny roses.Kyle\u2019s spaced-out eyes began to gradually regain their focus. He got to his feet, ghastly-faced, after seeing Leyla\u2019s face smeared with blood in his sightline.\u201cLe-Leyla! Are you okay? Blood\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dLeyla pushed Kyle\u2019s hand away from her face.\u201cYou look more hurt.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m not \u2026.\u201dKyle then looked at his shirt and bleeding hands. He felt a throbbing pain in his cheek and the back of his neck, but he ignored it.\u201cUncle. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine.\u201dLeyla hurried to stop Bill before he approached Kyle again.\u201cKyle.\u201dShe carefully spoke. Her swollen, glassy eyes captured his face.\u201cThere is no such place.\u201dLeyla\u2019s smiling lips quivered slightly at the corners. Her soothing tone of voice concealed her crimson eyes and heated cheeks.\u201cThere is no such place in the world, Kyle. There\u2019s nowhere in this world where just the two of us can be happy.\u201d\u201cLeyla\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too hard for me if you insist like this. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can stand it.\u201d\u201cPlease, Leyla\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo take care of yourself. Don\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019ll be fine too.\u201d\u201cHow could I be fine without you?\u201d\u201cGo to college as planned\u2026..study hard, and stay healthy. Then, become a good doctor.\u201dLeyla gave Kyle\u2019s wounded eyes a good stare. Bitter tears that trickled down her cheeks had glistened her face in sadness.\u201cMy Kyle. My good friend, Kyle Etman. I want to see you in that light.\u201dA single drop of grief welled up from the corner of his eyes. Kyle swallowed the sobbing with his teeth gritted and stared at her with reddened eyes.\u201cIf you\u2019re doing well, I will be fine too. We might be able to greet each other with a smile as time passes by.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sorry. I\u2019m sorry, Leyla\u2026\u201dKyle\u2019s gut-wrenching sobs that tore apart his chest escaped from between his lips.\u201cI, it was all my fault. Because of me, you\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry.\u201dThe sun\u2019s piercing light descended on him like shards of broken glass. Kyle collapsed to his knees like crushed rose petals strewn over the ground.Leyla shook her head and crouched before him.\u201cNo, Kyle. Don\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t resent you. How can I hate you?\u201d\u201cLeyla.\u201d\u201cSo, take care. You will, right?\u201dKyle gasped as if he was being strangled and hugged her tightly.His dread erupted in a torrent of uncontrolled sobs. Blood and tears dripping from his wounds marred Leyla\u2019s white blouse.Bill let out a long sigh. He withdrew his gaze, unable to bear the sight of the two youngsters hugging. The workers a few feet away also did the same.With resentful eyes, Bill glanced at the sun blazing down on him in the blistering heat. He longed more than ever fqor this bitter summer to elapse ere long.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Kyle Etman left for the capital sooner than scheduled.The Etman household put forward a flimsy reason that they had to prepare for college entrance, but no one believed it.On the morning of Kyle\u2019s departure, Leyla woke up earlier than usual.Kukukukuku\u2026.A bird chirping could be heard from the outside. Leyla turned her head to follow the cries and saw Phoebe sitting on her window ledge.She put her glasses on, ambled up to the window and flung it open.The bird\u2019s ankle was tied along with a scrap of paper. Phoebe was trained as a homey pigeon to fly between her window and Kyle\u2019s room. Leyla didn\u2019t have to candle who the letter was addressed to.She hesitated a while before carefully opening the letter.Leyla, I\u2019m leaving for the capital today.I\u2019m travelling to where I was supposed to go with you. But like a coward I\u2019m leaving alone.I won\u2019t say this is better for us by telling you a plausible lie. Eventually, I\u2019m running away.I\u2019m turning a blind eye to the messed up reality and leaving you behind. I lack the courage to assure you that everything is fine.I\u2019m sorry.I know very well that my apology can\u2019t wash away your wounds. Still, I want to convey these words.I\u2019m sorry for all the pains my mother foisted on you and for my inability to stop her. I was too naive to think that everything could be sorted easily, deaf to your feelings, I ended up hurting you.I\u2019m sorry\u2026.I realized my mistake.But Leyla, I\u2019ll be back.I won\u2019t be too late. I\u2019ll make sure to return to you soon.You may be right when you said that there\u2019s nowhere in this world where only the two of us can be happy.But Leyla, if there is no such place, I\u2019ll ensure that I create one on my own. And I\u2019ll bring you there.Until that day, I will be doing good, just like you\u2019ve asked of me.So take care of yourself too.My beloved Leyla, Goodbye.\u2026.Leyla read through Kyle\u2019s handwritten letter slowly. The dawning wind ruffled her bushy blonde hair, which draped politely over her cheeks.After a long pause, Leyla turned away from the window. She stowed the letter inside her desk drawer and hurriedly started her morning rounds.***It was an insanely hectic day. Leyla meticulously cleaned the entire house as if a single speck of dust wouldn\u2019t be tolerated to stay on the surface of any place. Her kitchen was brimming with delectable food that she had cooked herself.Before long, Bill returned to work after lunchtime, and a couple of Arvis\u2019 workers who were close to them came to the cottage.\u201cLeyla, are you alright?\u201dMrs. Mona worriedly asked as she handed out a basket full of luscious cookies and pastries.\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Leyla flashed a smile and gladly embraced the gift. \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am. Kindly go in and have a cup of tea.\u201d\u201cTea? Oh.. there\u2019s no need to bother really.\u201dMrs. Mona shook her head. Other coworkers nodded in tandem with her.\u201cThat\u2019s right! We just wanted to know whether you\u2019re fine.\u201d\u201cYes Leyla, don\u2019t be sad. First love doesn\u2019t always come true. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a better man than Kyle\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHey, it\u2019s almost time! Let\u2019s go back soon. I have to prepare for the duchess\u2019 tea time.\u201dMrs. Mona swiftly cut her off as she glared at the maid whose words were about to cross the line.Leyla saw them off and went back to the kitchen with a heavy basket. She carefully took out the cookies and cakes from the basket one by one and arranged them nicely on the table.Suddenly her hand stopped. She momentarily froze upon seeing a toasted cracker with a peach jam filling.It was\u00a0Kyle\u2019s favourite cake.Leyla vacantly looked across the table to the chair where Kyle was usually seated. The day when the three of them dined together at this table would never return.That lone chair evoked pleasant memories in her thoughts. The time of their delicious good feasts, warm dim lights and loud chatter on the table. All of it had now gradually perished into a gulf of silence.Leyla blinked and rushed to tidy up the basket before leaving the cottage. She grabbed her well-used sling bag and the hat hanging in front of the rear door and made her way to the forest trail.**Fennel. Yorkshire Fog. Buddleia.Katydid. Green Linnet. Swallowtail.Layla went along the path, whispering the names of the flowers that were blooming. The clinking sound of the stuff in her bag chimed along with the mumbled names of mother earth as a cradle song.After a long trek, Leyla stopped at the foot of an idyllic tree standing on the banks of the Schulter River. She immediately began climbing it to the summit and perched between the thick branches of the wooden trunks.Leyla stared at the bend of the blue Schulter River through her empty gaze.The sparkles of the water scales made her eyes feel cold.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cAs you said, master, it has been handled well.\u201dHessen, who turned back after a short phone call, said. Matthias gave the nod as he had grasped the meaning of the word without the butler\u2019s explanation. His gaze remained patched on the river beyond the colossal window.\u201cThey will notify us by telegram today.\u201dAfter concluding the report, Hessen moved on to the next agenda; the dinner scheduled for the following week and the guest list. The visit of Count Brandt. The issue of workforce expansion. Daily reports and Matthias\u2019 pithy answers were sequentially layered on top of one another.\u201cThen sir, I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201dHessen left the annex after everything was done.Once alone, Matthias descended the stairs connecting to the bottom floor.The pavilion was built in the shape of a floating house on stilts. Half of the ground level was devoted to a boat hangar, designed to be openly attached to the river. Matthias could simply cross the river anytime he pleased by untying their ropes and rowing over.Matthias stripped off his clothes on the hangar\u2019s floor and dived into the water. As he swam across the arched foyer, the dazzling sun soon devoured his nude body bathed under its light.Matthias let the gentle stream of the river cling to his flesh. Through his flexible stroke, he looked like a part of the river at first glance.The lingering attachment that he couldn\u2019t have was bound to grow into a bigger and tougher desire beyond his control, even if he believed, he would soon become tired of it once he had it. And Leyla was no exception.Breathing hard, Matthias reached that conclusion. He felt silly for getting carried away by the ephemeral hankering. Still, he graciously accepted the desire to have her.And now, nothing could stand in his way.He was free to do anything he pleased.The male lead who failed to protect their puppy love had eventually left, and Leyla was abandoned in the forest at the end of their fairytale.Everything in his world had been back to its proper place, in a perfect line, just as he wished.By the time he turned around and began swimming back to the annex, the slanting rays of the setting sun had tinted the sky a warm orange.Matthias\u2019 eyes narrowed at the river\u2019s edge when he saw the familiar, beautiful tree. Ridiculously, there was a woman present, where he casually cast his gaze.Leyla Lewellin.He chanted her name silently like a spell, sending ripples over the water\u2019s surface.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sky was darkening as the sunset descended from its zenith. But Leyla was still there, crying on top of the tree, oblivious of his arrival.Matthias eased to his feet under the tree. The hose wasn\u2019t long before Leyla turned her head and looked at him from the top.She didn\u2019t seem surprised, nor did she try to escape his gaze. She also exhibited no signs of fear or worry either.\u2018why\u2019Matthias soon found the reason: she wasn\u2019t exactly looking at him. Her dim eyes seemed to wander somewhere far away, probably toward the place where the doctor\u2019s son had left.By the time Matthias slanted his lips, Leyla\u2019s eyes had returned to focus. Her green eyes soon filled with a sense of shame. Her shoulders sucked in, and her face became stiff. She was back to the Leyla Lewellin that he knew.Matthias casually peered at her teary eyes with his arms folded. He had a leisurely evening and wasn\u2019t bound by any schedule, so Matthias had plenty of time to wait for her to stop weeping.He saw Leyla\u2019s eyes flashed with contempt when he had no intention of leaving, but her scathing arrogance only made him giggle.\u201cYou know, Leyla. That boy is not coming.\u201dMatthias took a step closer to the tree in which she was sitting.\u201cKyle Etman. The boy you\u2019re waiting for. Ah! Should I now call him\u00a0the one who left you?\u201dHis lips smiled up at her. His tone was gentle and calm, though the sting in his words hadn\u2019t dimmed in the slightest.Leyla teared up at hearing those words. The twilight sky above her revealed itself\u2014devoid of the birds that had returned to their nests. Her vision of the gradually swelling landscape soon turned into steamy tears and flowed down her cheeks.Leyla bit her lower lip, she kept silent until the darkness slowly snuffed out her surroundings. She patiently awaited his leave but the wicked Duke was still standing beneath the tree. So Leyla decided to climb down the back of the tree, which was unreachable from his sight. Her head was slightly dizzy from all the crying. It\u2019s fortunate that she didn\u2019t stumble and was able to step on the ground safely.Leaning against the tree, Leyla wiped her tear-stained face with her apron. She spruced up her tangled hair and straightened her posture. Only after that, she looked back, and the duke was still blocking the path to the cottage.After building up some nerve, Leyla approached him one step at a time. She couldn\u2019t care less about her scruffy face as her untamed tears were still sticking on it. As she couldn\u2019t keep her tears hidden, Leyla chose to show it off with confidence.This time she was determined to never again be his plaything.\u201cI apologize for my disrespect. Goodbye then, Duke.\u201dLeyla bowed her back with the greatest politeness from a distance of two steps away. At this point, giving the nobility the courtesy they wanted, has become as easy to her as breathing.\u201cLeyla.\u201dMatthias called out her name the moment she was about to pass by him. Leyla flinched, but her stride went undisturbed.\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dMatthias laughed and turned. But Leyla ignored him and continued ahead as if she were deaf.His brows wrinkled into a scowl at her rudeness that had crossed the line. He was about to stop her when Leyla suddenly collapsed.\u201cArghh..\u201dShe sat slumped on the ground, unable to get up. Her tiny hunched shoulders and frail back trembled intermittently.Matthias scoffed and slowly approached her. Leyla Lewellin, the upright girl whose eyes never lost their boldness despite her tears, was now wailing terribly after taking her nasty fall.Matthias squatted in front of her, bending one knee and picked up her dropped glasses.Still, Leyla didn\u2019t raise her head.The tears that had always entertained him this time no longer did. Matthias now learned what to name this feeling after seeing her crying over the boy named Kyle Etman.Hate\u2026A feeling of emotion he never had.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201dMatthias grabbed her chin. Leyla tried to dodge but was unable to escape his grip.\u201cLet me go!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201dMatthias overlooked her protests and repeated his demand. With just one hand, he was able to tame her fully.Layla threw a flout at him.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be happy to see me cry?\u201dThe dewdrops in her eyes became thicker and hotter as she endured his grip\u2019s humiliation.\u201cSince when did you take an interest in my pleasure?\u201d Matthias sneered at her, who sniffled frantically in front of his nose. \u201cWhy? You don\u2019t like me having fun?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dLeyla shook her gripped face, stubbornly trying to contain her sobs.\u201cWhether or not the Duke likes it, it has nothing to do with me. My tears are not related to you.\u201d\u201cWhat is that Leyla?\u201d Matthias tilted his head. \u201cIt does have something to do with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo, don\u2019t cry.\u201dOver again. Matthias\u2019s gentle look held her a moment longer. Leyla was stunned, and she groused.\u201cDo I need your permission to cry?\u201d\u201cPerhaps?\u201d\u201cWhy should I? You have no right to do so.\u201d\u201cI have no right\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t own me just because you\u2019re the owner of Arvis!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dAfter a quick frown, Matthias\u2019 face soon lit up with excitement.\u201cThen\u2026.shall I have\u00a0you\u00a0now?\u201dEmotion fled his face when his smile disappeared. Leyla cowered at the sight of the face that reminded her of the water\u2019s still, windless surface.\u201cSo that I can be\u00a0your owner.\u201dMatthias fondled her lips with the tip of his finger. Leyla shuddered with dread when his touch rekindled the memories of her odious last summer. Her burning heart, which had been aflutter in sorrow at losing Kyle, seemed to freeze suddenly.\u201c\u2026N-no, I-I don\u2019t want to.\u201dLeyla heaved her body with all her might. She was sick to her core at the sight of herself groveling at the his feet. Matthias then let her go, much like a child who had become bored with his toy and threw it away.Matthias rose first and stood there watching her crawl to her feet under his shadow. Soil dust and tears marred her shape, but not her eyes\u2014the flame had not yet burned out in her irises.\u201cDuke, I really don\u2019t understand you\u2026You already have a fianc\u00e9e but you always do such inexplicable acts\u2026 I hate all of this.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201dMatthias asked back, fiddling with her loose glasses.\u201cWhat does your heart have to do with me?\u201dHis tone was devoid of hostility.\u201cI just want to have you.\u201dHe wanted it; then he had it. His principle was that simple.Matthias von Herhardt wanted Leyla Lewellin. He wanted her, and he would have her. He believed; something could be thrown away only after having that\u00a0\u2018something.\u2019\u00a0And he had to leave her after he had her so that his life would be complete again.Matthias gently put the glasses on Leyla\u2019s dejected face.\u201cGo on.\u201dHe released his hand, and Leyla lost her balance and fell back on the spot.Matthias stood peering down on her for a while before he left the riverside to continue his stroll.Leyla stayed there alone for a long time, even after he was no longer seen.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cLeyla! Leyla! Come here and look at this!\u201dBill Remmer greeted Leyla excitedly after she returned to the cabin.Leyla approached Bill merrily as he sat on the porch. She knew she couldn\u2019t deceive her uncle with such a sloppy laugh, but she didn\u2019t want to show him her stupid weeping face.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, uncle?\u201d\u201cA telegram arrived. It\u2019s for you.\u201d\u201cTelegram?\u201dLeyla was puzzled when Bill gave her the telegram. It was a letter of notice about job openings for teaching positions at a rural school not far from Arvis estate. Beginning from the next semester, she would be able to work at the school rather than commute to a neighboring city.\u201cIt\u2019s weird. They said that there were no more openings at Carlsbar\u2026\u201dThe good news left her confused. Bill raised his hands and softly patted her head.\u201cIt\u2019s so hard for me to send you far away, Leyla, but I\u2019m glad this kind of luck came in.\u201dLooking at Bill\u2019s relief-filled gaze, Leyla giggled as she nodded. She could come every weekend to visit her beloved uncle despite her work in a nearby city. However, her heart was uneasy whenever she left Uncle Bill at the cottage alone.But\u2026Leyla was unable to savor her bliss once the Duke\u2019s visage loomed in her thoughts. She was grateful she didn\u2019t have to part from Uncle Bill. But on the other hand, she loathed living under the same roof as the Duke.What a stupid thought.\u201cLeyla, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dBill seemed worried, and Leyla realized her face appeared glum.\u201cNo. It\u2019s nothing.\u201dA rim of brilliant moonlight shone over her smiling face.\u201cIt\u2019s like a fluke, so I\u2019m a bit shocked.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe twinkled, and her smile lit up a little more.\u201cUncle, aren\u2019t you hungry? Let\u2019s have a nice dinner.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The draping curtains in the bedroom, which partially obscured the open window, swelled up in the night air before repeatedly sinking.Inside the room, the tinkling piano tune played the transition of a music piece. The tapping chords flowed mellifluously, creating an extremely delicate and flashy symphony yet, to some extent, sounding depressed.Matthias reclined on a chair near the window, tin scissors and a handkerchief in his hands. when he clicked his finger, the canary swooped down and perched on his hand. He learned that canaries, like people, could improve their singing by being trained often.His lips rose into a smile when the bird was humming in tune with the piano being played. The canary wiggled its little body covered in soft feathers and cocked its head as if in deep study.Matthias gently wrapped the bird with the handkerchief he had brought after the singing had stopped.Knowing that the bird would be frightened of the person who cut its wings, the zookeeper always covered the birds\u2019 eyes before trimming their wings. After entrusting the job to the zookeeper for so long, Matthias could now easily trim it overgrown feathers.The first few times he cut its wing too short, the bird bled. It wasn\u2019t severely injured, but seeing its golden wings splattered with blood wasn\u2019t a pleasant sight. Matthias disliked it, so he grew more circumspect.Matthias skillfully spread out and clasped the branches of the bird that trusted him. He grabbed the scissors from his lap after deciding which feathers were to be clipped. Strand by strand, the feathers were strewn along the slashed area. The plumages fluttered in accord and fell on his perfectly polished shoes.Matthias then rolled up the handkerchief that had been shielding the bird\u2019s eyes after he had done cutting off the last wings. The canary flapped its wing several times before sitting on his finger.The canary began to sing again as if nothing had happened.It was a beautiful song.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leyla! what are you doing up there!\u201dA high-pitched screech from below the tree nearly made Leyla drop her half-bitten apple.She snatched the fruit before it fell. Mrs. Mona appeared in her sight as she lowered her gaze. She was glaring at Leyla with her arms firmly crossed.\u201cHello, Mrs. Mona. Isn\u2019t the weather really nice today?\u201d.After a simple greeting, Leyla hurriedly stuffed the apples and books into her bag. Mrs. Mona\u2019s brow knitted as she watched Leyla fluidly glide down the tree trunk. At the same time, Bill Remmer returned to the cottage.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of you, Mr. Remmer!\u201dMrs. Mona growled at Bill Remmer moments after he ditched his cart.\u201cI warned you to raise her like a modest lady! I\u2019ve advised you many times, with my experience of raising three daughters, and yet you consistently ignore what I say! Take a look at her now!? A grown lady and a teacher who\u2019s supposed to educate children, climbed a tree like that!\u201d\u201cIs there a rule that school teachers can\u2019t climb trees? A good teacher should be capable of doing everything!\u201dBewildered by the matter, Bill raised his voice and was ready to debate her. Ever since Leyla\u2019s stay in Arvis, the pair\u2019s parenting styles had never been in agreement.Leyla wanted to say that she was now a grownup, instead, she wittily approached her uncle.\u201cLook at her! It\u2019s all your fault! You should\u2019ve gotten rid of her bad tomboy habits by at least spanking her ass when she was a child!\u201dMrs. Mona\u2019s ghoulish grumble made Leyla gasp and impulsively caressed her bottom. Bill and Leyla both had their feet freeze in place, as if they were being punished for making a mistake.After a few minutes of nagging, Mrs. Mona suddenly remembered her original reason for being there and handed a basket of food to them before leaving. Bill and Leyla met eyes and exchanged guffaws.\u201cI feel like her scold has smacked me in the butt.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t handle this anymore, Leyla. You\u2019ll have to climb trees secretly from now on. Don\u2019t get caught by her. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll become deaf if I hear her blaring voice.\u201d\u201cOkay uncle, I\u2019ll do that for you.\u201dAfter nodding, Leyla picked up the heavy basket and sauntered into the home. The old sling bag on her shoulder shook, making a clattering sound as it moved in time with her steps.\u201cAnyway, that junk bag needs to be burned soon.\u201dBill tutted as he gazed at the crap bag, which she refused to throw away.His worries didn\u2019t seem to have a bearing on Leyla\u2019s everyday life; she lived gallantly. After the new school semester started, she began teaching the children as a new primary school teacher. She was sometimes careless and couldn\u2019t avoid making a mistake, but she quickly overcame them.School seemed to have gotten pretty interesting for her lately. Bill, who had been worried if she could do well in teaching the child, could now relax. But he was keenly aware of Leyla\u2019s pain and sadness that she was hiding in the depths of her heart.She was a child who could hardly throw away the worn bag because of her attachment to it. He knew what Kyle meant to her better than anybody else. It was hard for her to mend her wounds from losing Kyle. He was her closest friend, before he became an innocent lover so fast. She was much too frail to be able to heal herself.\u2018It\u2019s not time yet.\u2019After a long thought, Bill shoved Kyle\u2019s letter back into his pocket.Even after moving to Ratz, Kyle sent a letter to Leyla once a week. Bill had explicitly asked to deliver the letter to only him. The postman had understood his intentions, and willingly complied with his request.Bill knew he was cruel, and his cowardice didn\u2019t represent an adult\u2019s attitude. But, his need to protect Leyla trumped his regret and guilt over that boy.\u201cUncle!\u201dLeyla waved at him, and Bill came to her.They sat next to each other on the porch and shared an apple while enjoying the cool weather as the forest was resplendent in the colors of autumn.\u201cOh, I forgot. I have something to say to the butler. Uncle, would you please relay my message to him?\u201d\u201cButler? Do you mean, Mr.Hessen?\u201d\u201cYes. Because of school work.\u201dLeyla wiped the juice drop on her fingers with the handkerchief she took out from her apron.\u201cI\u2019d like to ask the Duke if the children can have an autumn picnic in the Arvis forest.\u201d\u201cAh that\u2019s right, you must tell Hessen first, since you cannot directly approach the Duke. Sure. I\u2019ll ask instead of you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a bit worried if it\u2019s a discourteous request.\u201d\u201cDiscourteous? Don\u2019t worry; the Duke is notoriously generous with such things, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll gladly allow it. Besides, Duke Herhardt is a sponsor of the school.\u201d\u201cSponsor?\u201d Leyla\u2019s eyes grew three sizes. \u201cDuke Herhardt is the sponsor of my school?\u201d A look of shock crossed her face.Bill nodded, \u201cDid you not know that yet? Duke Herhardt funds virtually almost all schools in this district.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dLeyla muttered a little. She clamped her eyes shut, wanting to block off the Duke\u2019s face from her thoughts.Duke Herhardt\u2019s name followed her wherever she went in Carlsbar, and Leyla was bound to accept that unavoidable reality.The King of Carlsbar.That was the moniker bestowed to Duke Herhardt by the citizens of this city. An imperial nobility on a par with the emperor\u2019s family in terms of wealth and power. He served both as a symbol and a source of pride for Carlsbar society.\u201cWhy? Is there a problem with the Duke? Did his haughty fiancee bother you again?\u201dLayla shook her head, taken aback by Bill\u2019s question. \u201cNo. How could that be?\u201dOnce again, the Duke\u2019s face, his stare, and their suffocating moments sequentially seared into her memory, robbing her of her speech.\u201cLet\u2019s have a cup of tea, uncle.\u201dLeyla stood up and fled to the kitchen before Bill could answer. She poured the tea into the cup and placed the cake from Mrs. Mona on the serving plate after slicing it.The daytime was winding down, and the night was creeping into the house. But Leyla hesitated to switch on the light as if she wanted to conceal her wariness in the dark.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*There was no need to rush.Matthias\u2019 opinion of Leyla Lewellin was as follows. He had a burning urge to have her, but he didn\u2019t want to jump the gun.\u201cOh, Miss Lewellin is over there.\u201dMark Evers giggled when he spotted Leyla marching down the Platanus road with her students. After Leyla established herself as a decent grownup and schoolteacher, Arvis residents started addressing her as \u2018Miss Lewellin.\u2019The driver chipped in. \u201cToday must be their picnic day.\u201dHis grandmother granted the children from the local school to have an autumn picnic in Arvis forest. His mother gave a cool nod to the idea as well. In essence, such consent came under the hostess\u2019s purview, which explained why Matthias raised no objections and respected their decision.The excited students surrounding her reminded Matthias of the first time Leyla came to Arvis. She was still a child at heart who loved roaming the forest, who knew she could act so maturely in front of her students.A smile crept on Matthias\u2019 lips as he gazed from the car window. In the following moments, his car passed by Leyla and the children. But her afterimage clung onto his thoughts for quite some time after that.These days, toying around with Leyla Lewellin had been his favorite pastime.The more severe he bullied her, the more vivid her reactions became. Her emotions didn\u2019t stray from embarrassment, anger, shame, and fear, but he savored every change in her emotions. Watching her flinch, get enraged, and speak back to him was much more entertaining than seeing her docile face with a polite smile.Last weekend, they bump into each other in the mansion\u2019s glasshouse. She was helping her uncle in tidying up the flowerbed when she saw him. The color quickly drained from her face. Leyla dropped her garden basket, and the soil-stained tubers were strewn over the paving stone. Bill Remmer, a few feet away, was busy tending to another flowerbed and didn\u2019t seem to notice the fuss.He calmly approached and stood in front of her. When he stomped on the tubers with his shoes, Leyla raised her head in a fit of fury. She looked nervous if anybody saw them, but her eyes were filled with an uncontrollable hatred.Matthias chuckled, remembering how the people regarded Leyla Lewellin as a kind and gentle lady who never spoke ill of anybody. However, it didn\u2019t stop him from being satisfied. As he had never learned to share his things with others, he was elated when Leyla acted sharp-tempered just to him.The majestic birds living in the Arvis\u2019 heavenly greenhouse made a loud chirp. Leyla quickly scooped up the tubers as if she didn\u2019t want him to touch them, and then stood up.As she bowed and was about to run, he tripped over her leg. The basket in her hands toppled, and the tubers were scattered again on the paving stones. Leyla stumbled, but he had already hugged her waist to save her from falling.Matthias recalled how frightened Leyla was and how she quickly covered her mouth to prevent a scream. Even though the flowering season had withered away, he could still taste the faint scent of roses wafting from her skin.After letting her go, he took a step back and pointed to the falling tubers with his gaze. Leyla scowled, loathing visible in her eyes, but she had no option but to follow with his demand.Gnashing her teeth, she knelt to collect the tubers. When he kicked some tubers with the tip of his shoe towards her, a blush of heat bloomed on her cheeks.Its crimson color beautified her skin tone perfectly.Matthias wondered how beautiful it would be if he could paint her whole body with that hue. A lovely shade of red.\u00a0The color of him.\u201cWhat\u2019s my afternoon schedule?\u201dMatthias queried when their car moved closer to the city center.\u201cToday\u2019s last schedule is to attend the board of directors meeting.\u201dMatthias gave a satisfied nod and checked his wristwatch. He\u2019d be able to return home earlier this afternoon.After getting out of the car, he took a moment to admire the cloudless high blue sky. The late-afternoon sun bathed the buildings in its warm light and the wind kept everything crisp.The weather was perfect to enjoy autumn picnic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s not like our teacher at all!\u201dA little girl\u2014smaller than the boy whimpered and other children who huddled behind Leyla, reacted identically: their eyes opened wide with fear as soon as Bill Remmer appeared in front of them.Bill was quite blas\u00e9 at their not-so-extraordinary reaction. He disliked rowdy children, but Leyla had especially begged him to spare his time to guide the children who came for a picnic in the Arvis\u2019 forest for a day. But he already felt that this wasn\u2019t an easy job.\u201cKids, Uncle Bill is a good person.\u201dLeyla smiled as she comforted her students. The timid little girl from a while ago again burst into tears after Bill showed his toothy grin.\u201cFuck! I don\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle!\u201dLeyla quickly hushed up Bill\u2019s violent cursing and knelt in front of the sobbing child. Unable to smile or frown, Bill could only stare at the tiny creatures with a quizzical face.\u201cUncle Bill is a very nice man and he will take us around the forest today.\u201dThe sniffling child in her arms stopped weeping, and Leyla continued her praiseworthy explanation.\u201cWe\u2019re going to study flowers and trees in the forest with Uncle Bill. Won\u2019t it be fun?\u201dThe children seemed to disagree with their teacher\u2019s words, but they grudgingly nodded in tandem.\u2018What a bunch of whiny!\u2019Bill scratched his head and began to lead the way. Leyla and the children were quick to follow his suit.\u201cCome to think of it, I think you were around the same age as those children when I first met you.\u201dBill\u2019s stiff lips softened when a flashback of memory flooded his thoughts.\u201cUh, Uncle. These kids are all under the age of ten.\u201d countered Leyla, with a frown on her face. \u201cI was 11 years old at the time, about to become 12.\u201dBill was joking when he said that, but Leyla took it seriously and she retorted by telling her age like the way she did the first time she came to Arvis.\u201cHe.. he.. he..\u201dBill chuckled, remembering that day. Leyla, his little girl who had always disliked being labelled \u2018small\u2019, now had grown up into a beautiful lady.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was a little past 1 o\u2019clock when Matthias returned to the Estate.The car made its way through the mansion and headed to the riverfront annex. The driver and his aide were baffled at first by his surprising order, but soon understood when they recalled that it was a picnic day for the rural school children. This kind of charity event was primarily the duty of the hostess, but there was no reason to exclude the Duke from participating.A gleam of bright sunlight bounced off the tree and caught the shrubs in its beams as the car drove through the forest to the riverside. The splendour of the forest coloured with reds and oranges and the pristine river sparkling with luminous water scales became a natural fence that encircled both sides of the road.Arvis was a place that offered picturesque vistas all year round, but the period with the most splendid beauty by far was the autumn season.Matthias stared at the scenic view which passed like a movie scene with an odd feeling.Arvis, as he knew it, was either a verdant summer or a placid snowy winter. In the spring of his twelfth year, he inherited the title of Duke after the death of his father. And the next summer, he enrolled at a school in the capital. From then on, he spent the spring and autumn in Ratz and the summer and winter in Carlsbar, leading a life divided between the two cities.\u201cDuke, it\u2019s been a while since you spent the autumn at Carlsbar, hasn\u2019t it?\u201dThe driver who was watching Matthias as he gazed out the window, carefully asked.\u201cYes, that\u2019s true.\u201dMatthias nodded with an autumnal smile as he recalled his eleven-year-old autumn memory. A very long time had passed, but his life seemed scarcely different between then, and now.He was reared as the family\u2019s heir from his birth and was groomed to succeed his father as the Duke of Herhardt. It was a life mapped out in advance; only his turn had come sooner than planned. And the same circle would apply to Herhardt\u2019s future heir, whom he and Claudine would have. As was his life, which paralleled his father\u2019s.Matthias drew his gaze from the car window where the unfamiliar autumn landscape was unfolding. The car shortly came to a stop at the annex\u2019s pier. When the driver opened the backseat door, he was greeted by the children\u2019s laughter and chit-chat.After getting out of the car, Matthias looked in the direction of the sound. The little children he had seen this morning were merrily strolling along the riverbank. The gardener was following them, and\u2026.. Leyla. Her radiant smile resembled the fall sunshine.They met each other\u2019s eyes the moment she turned her head away from the children. She was dressed in a wide lace collared top and a maple-red skirt. Her teacher outfit looked great, but everything else about her was clunky.Matthias buttoned up his suit and walked into the autumn sun.\u201cOh. Is that Duke Herhardt?\u201dMrs. Grever asked, taken aback while staring at Matthias approaching them. She was a mother of two and the upper class\u2019s homeroom teacher.\u201cOh my god, this is my first time seeing him this close! He\u2019s even more handsome in person than the picture in the newspaper!\u201dShe muttered in a lively tone, not giving Leyla a chance to answer.Mrs. Grever\u2019s jovial reaction made Leyla realize Duke Herhardt\u2019s notable reputation. The citizens admired and respected him, whose face was often featured in publications. But in her eyes, Matthias Von Herhardt was nothing more than a psychopath.\u201cBy the way, Miss Lewellin\u2026.\u201dMrs. Grever was about to speak when Matthias stood in front of them.\u201cHello, Duke.\u201dBill, who was busy bickering with the children, hurriedly approached them and greeted him which also made Mrs. Grever join in. Still soured by his jerk behaviour last weekend, Leyla belatedly bowed her head.\u2018Damn it! I should have thrown those tubers at him!\u201dShe walked home from the greenhouse that day with terrible feelings. Even if she could rewind time, she wouldn\u2019t dare to commit such impudence~ That\u2019s what she had to tell herself to quell her frustration\u201cWould you like to introduce this person to me, Miss Lewellin?\u201dMatthias asked her nicely as Leyla had lifted her head. His gentlemanly regal and courteous manners astounded her. He seemed to be a totally different person.\u2018Others\u2019 impressions of Duke Herhardt will always be like this.\u2019That insight amazed her.\u201cLe\u2026 Leyla?\u201dThe confused Bill patted her on the back.\u201cHmm? Ah\u2026 Yes, Duke.\u201dLeyla apace came to her senses and took a perfect stance, clasping her hands beneath her navel. She decided not to lose her temper because she failed to throw the tubers at him. She set out to prove to the Duke that she had polished herself into a decent adult, no longer like a forest child he could just pester around at whim.Leyla introduced Mrs. Grever to him in a professional manner. She also patiently explained to the wondering children who Duke of Herhardt was. Leyla decided to go along with her children\u2019s adoration of him, even if she couldn\u2019t agree with most of what they said. If she had to tell the truth about what a terrible person he was, she would have to use offensive words that no child should ever hear.\u201cThank you so much for allowing us to have an autumn picnic, Duke.\u201dLeyla stood confidently before him, with her shoulders straightened and chin slightly up, proud of her performance.\u201cThanks to you, the children are having a great time.\u201dShe also gave a soft emphasis on the term \u2018children\u2019 to underline her position as a teacher.\u201cReally?\u201dMatthias\u2019 lips rose slightly as she spoke.\u201cThe one who is having a good time seems to be Miss Lewellin.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Pardon?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dMatthias stayed quiet at her question. He did little more than snicker at her boggling expression and greeted Mrs. Grever and the kids\u2019 goodbye with his gentlemanly persona that was able to mask his twisted personality.Matthias, his aide, and the driver then reversed and left the scene. Leyla stood silently watching their backs as they approached the riverfront annex. She did lose her understanding of his words until Mrs. Grever gave her the answer.\u201cUm\u2026 Miss Lewellin\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYour head\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dA little coy, Mrs. Grever pointed over her head.\u201cHead? What\u2019s wrong with my head\u2026.\u201dLeyla\u2019s bewildered face creased in a tick as she felt the soft touch of flowers and grass leaves on her head.Flower crown!There was a flower crown adorning her head. Monica, her youngest and closest student, had put the wildflower wreath she\u2019d fashioned as Uncle Bill had taught her.Mrs. Grever felt awful for not telling her. \u201cI was about to tell you, but Duke Herhardt suddenly came.\u201dLeyla was stone-faced. She was unable to speak and just blinked.\u2018So I pretended to act like an adult while wearing this.\u2019A rush of shame overtook her. She almost yelled out the curse words Uncle Bill often used if it weren\u2019t for the children.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, teacher.\u201dMonica, the child who gave Leyla the flower crown, cheered her on lovingly.\u201cYou look pretty! Like a princess.\u201dThe other children agreed with Monica and nodded their heads together.Ha.. Ha.. HaLeyla seemed to know too well why Uncle Bill was laughing so wildly. If one could die of shame, she was willing to fall deeply asleep on this beautiful autumn day.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d Bill delightedly patted her back. \u201cIt was just a little embarrassing, but it\u2019s not like you committed a crime or anything like that.\u201dAt his words that weren\u2019t comforting at all, Leyla\u2019s cheeks bloomed crimson as a ripened apple. Then, out of the blue, an even more shockingly bad ordeal befell her.\u201cMr. Remmer! Miss Lewellin!\u201dMark Evers, who had left with the Duke earlier, returned with a sprightly smile.\u201cThe Duke has invited the picnicking children to his annex. He wants to have tea with everyone. Of course, together with the two teachers and you too, Mr. Remmer.\u201d\u201cWoaaaaaaaa!\u201dThe frenzied child\u2019s cheering could be heard echoing through the forest. Mrs. Grever\u2019s jaw hung open, and Bill didn\u2019t seem to dislike the Duke\u2019s invitation.In everyone\u2019s thrills, Leyla looked blankly up into the sky, grabbing the flower that crowned her head.She knew shame couldn\u2019t kill a person, but she prayed at least it could knock her out.Leyla earnestly begged, yet her mind was as clear as the dazzling blue of an autumn\u2019s sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their eyes twinkled with delight as they looked around the house but couldn\u2019t dare to make jokes and fool around like before.Leyla had to appease the frightened Monica first, so she was the last to enter the annex, and the servants welcomed the Duke\u2019s young guest with the same servility they gave to the VIP guests.\u201cThis way, please.\u201dOne of the servants promptly escorted the waiting children from the guest lounge to the living room. Inside, Matthias was sitting there with his back against the window overlooking the river\u2014he had been waiting for them to arrive.Leyla held her breath as she walked into the place riddled with horrible, embarrassing, and humiliating memories.\u201cThank you so much for your kindness in allowing us to visit Arvis, Duke.\u201dMrs. Grever was effusive in her thanks, and her vivacity put Leyla at ease. She hoped her-teacher-friend would take the role as the Duke\u2019s converser, so she could sit quietly like the room\u2019s furniture and leave the place when the pleasantries were over.\u201cRather, I should be thankful to all of you for accepting my sudden invitation.\u201dMatthias welcomed them as he rose from his seat. The window\u2019s backlight cast a shadow over his face, but it amplified the sense of his presence.\u201cTeacher\u2026 it hurts.\u201dMonica\u2019s whispers startled Leyla, who was staring blankly at his silhouette.\u201cMy hand hurts.\u201dMonica moaned in pain. Leyla\u2019s eyes widened as she realized she was gripping the child\u2019s hand too tightly.\u201cAh, sorry. I\u2019m so sorry, Monica.\u201dShe massaged Monica\u2019s wrist in a panic, and at the time, the door flew open to the balcony facing the riverside.The scent of fresh water was wafting from the opened door. Leyla swiveled\u00a0to face the view. A sumptuous tea table which was set up in the sun-drenched terrace and the white tablecloth that gently swayed along with the wind, captured her eyes in a blink.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dMatthias\u2019 gaze flew from Leyla to Mrs. Grever. The teacher accepted his escort by lightly placing her hand on his arm with her blushing cheeks.The astonished children who had never had a tea-time of this kind, happily followed the Duke with a zealous expression on their face. Leyla walked with Monica in tow and was the last to head to the balcony.\u201cWoah, Teacher! I feel like I\u2019m becoming a princess!\u201dAs she walked onto the balcony, Monica rolled her eyes, and her innocent face glowed with adoration. Leyla couldn\u2019t debate the child\u2019s praises, as the vibrantly colored assortment of bites that was served on the balcony\u2019s table looked quite appetizing. It was amazing to think about how promptly they had everything ready.She caught sight of the bouquet of Baby breath flowers, and red asters gracing the table\u2019s centrepiece. There were teacups and exquisite silverware on the table, much too many for the rural schoolchildren. And the scenic beauty of Schulter River beyond the railing was the perfect setting for their afternoon meals.A beam of sunlight hit her slender glasses frame and shattered like shrapnel. Matthias\u2019s eyes wandered throughout those shards of light\u2026The jewel-blue flowing river\u2026.the daughter of the sky\u2014Bright white sun\u2026And\u2026.The sea of trees,\u00a0 beneath a garland of scarlets and golds.In the autumn moment of Arvis, where all the beautiful colors of nature were at their most vivid,Their eyes met\u2026.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Monica was delighted over the moon. She roistered endlessly at how pretty the annex was, of how handsome the duke was, and the tasty cake she had eaten. That child couldn\u2019t stop herself from extolling everything.\u201cWoaaa!\u201dThis time, that child was hooked on by the scoop of ice cream. Her eyes sparkled at the ice cream dish, and she hurriedly reached out her hand to Leyla sitting beside her.Leyla gave a surprised look, and Monica whispered,\u201cTeacher, it tastes like clouds.\u201dLeyla blinked a few times before catching on to what the child was trying to say. With a smile, she took a napkin and gently wiped Monica\u2019s lips to clean the ice cream smudge on her lips.Monica had just started school this year. She was physically smaller than her peers, a scaredy-cat, and still a shy girl. Her introverted nature made it difficult for her to socialize with other children. She used to cry, wanting to go back home every day. And for the first few weeks, Leyla had an uphill struggle to cope with that child.But now, she was Leyla\u2019s best disciple among her classmates. After learning that Monica\u2019s mother died from an illness last spring, Leyla had a deeper understanding of the child\u2019s heart.\u201cTeacher, you should try it too.\u201d\u201cNo, Monica. Teacher is fine.\u201dLeyla scrupled for a moment. But she maturely refused. Albeit, there was no law prohibiting adults from eating ice cream, she didn\u2019t want to seem childish in front of the Duke by eating the ice cream that was prepared for the children only.Leyla took another sip of the half-cold tea as she eavesdropped on the ongoing table talk. Mrs. Grever was leading the conversation with a bubbly attitude, just as she wished.Meanwhile, ridding her mind of its load, Leyla threw a glance at Matthias, who sat at the head chair. He was listening attentively to Mrs. Grever. His brief replies and smile presented impeccable courtesy. Strangely enough, by displaying such a perfect turn, the other people could sense his dominance and classiness in the relationship. All of his gestures were haughty but graceful at the same time.Like a researcher, she observed Matthias intently when Monica suddenly stood up and approached her with a bowl of ice cream.\u201cTeacher\u2026 teacher! This ice cream is so delicious. Please try it?\u201dWhen her tiny hand was tugging her sleeve, Leyla flinched and pulled back. Monica dropped the ice cream bowl and it splattered all over her skirt. The loud fuss drew the attention of everyone seated at the table to her.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry teacher!\u201dMonica blanched when the bowl fell to the hardwood floor, covering her teacher\u2019s skirt with ice cream. Tears slowly crept out of her eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t cry, teacher is fine.\u201dLeyla smiled and quickly wiped the ice cream with the napkin to soothe the child. Meanwhile, the maids reached them quickly and rushed to wipe the wet floor.Leyla was flustered after taking a look at her sticky hands and stained skirt. Seeing that, Matthias gestured at the maid standing close to her and she hurriedly ushered Leyla into the powder room.Monica was about to burst into tears when Leyla left the terrace, but luckily Bill Remmer calmed her down. At the same time, Mark Evers discreetly approached.\u201cDuke, Count Klein wants to have a call with you.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The more she rubbed it, the larger and more stubborn the ice cream stain became on her skirt.Leyla gave up and just washed her hands and face. By luck, she was wearing a dark-colored kilt, which helped a lot in hiding the stain.She carefully turned off the sink\u2019s gold faucet and checked her reflection in the mirror. Her cheeks were blushing red from a fruitless effort to remove ice cream stains off her skirt.She tidied her droopy hair and took a breath before leaving the powder room. It wasn\u2019t long before she tensed up again, a heavy feeling in her stomach as she saw the Duke leaning against the hallway wall leading to the living room. Matthias looked at her, smiling when she gasped.\u2018Damn.\u2019A frown appeared on her face, and she looked around. There was no one else here, and her mind whirled, alarmed of what could happen next.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s been waiting for me\u2026.\u2019After several minutes had passed, he remained standing there, nonchalantly staring at her. A sneer sneaked out the corner of his lips, a satirical grin that those who lauded him as a faultless aristocrat would never know. And every time he cracked a smile like that, Leyla knew something bad was going to happen to her.Ominous hunch overwhelmed her. She gulped, her shaking hands clenched, waiting for him to get out of the way. But Leyla decided not to waste time that would cause an unnecessary misunderstanding.Without letting go of her guard, she took a watchful stride forward. Matthias, still leaning against the wall, kept his eyes intact on her. And once she got closer, he blatantly stood in the middle of the corridor.Seeing her flinch in fear and step back from him, Matthias\u2019 chuckle grew louder.After a short phone call from Count Klein, without a particular reason, he went in the opposite direction instead of going back to the balcony. He simply had the urge to wait for her since she hadn\u2019t yet returned. Just in case something interesting happened to her. Exactly just like right now.Leyla approached him with a straight face, as if marching to a battlefield. She intended to avoid him, but the hallway was incapacious.As she walked right next to him, Matthias slightly stuck out his leg. Leyla reflexively backed off.\u2018Dodged it!\u2019But her joy soon turned into shame when he just pretended to move to change his posture. She now looked like an idiot-jumping rabbit in front of the upright and elegant Duke.Matthias snickered and took a spin around as if nothing had happened. Alone in the hall, Leyla stayed still until he entered the living room and was no longer in her sight.A liar\u2014She would undoubtedly be labelled as such if she told everyone about Duke Herhardt\u2019s absurd personality.\u2018No.\u2019Leyla tossed aside the thought and walked into the living room. Upon reaching the balcony, she saw him acting normal, like a model gentleman. He had a warm conversation with Mrs. Grever, and a smile never left his face.\u201cOh, welcome back, Miss Lewellin!\u201dMrs. Grever was pleased when she came back.\u201cLet\u2019s go boating!\u201d\u201cBoating?\u201d\u201cThe Duke said he\u2019d lend our kids his yacht. Isn\u2019t it wonderful to have a boat ride in that beautiful river?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026 But I\u2026.\u201dLeyla shot her uncle a worried gaze, and Bill stepped forward.\u201cMy apologies, Duke, but Leyla is very afraid of water. It\u2019ll be hard for her to get on the boat.\u201d\u201cAh. I see.\u201dMatthias pretended to be saddened by the story, although he had seen her drowning in the same river a year ago.\u201cThen Ms. Lewellin, you can take a rest here.\u201d\u2018He\u2026 Why is he showing such consideration now?\u2019While his unexpected concern perplexed her, the children bolted off the balcony, accompanied by the Duke\u2019s servant.\u201cYes, Miss Lewellin. I\u2019ll go, so you can stay here.\u201d\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry Leyla. I\u2019ll take care of those little ones.\u201dBill smiled and took Monica\u2019s hand from Leyla\u2019s. That child was scared and wanted to weep every time she saw Bill, but she was willing to follow him out of the blue.\u201cThank you, Mr. Grever and Uncle Bill too.\u201dLeyla felt embarrassed but thanked them for their kindness. They were nice people, unlike the enigmatic Duke. Apart from that, she also felt lucky to be able to stay away from the Duke.However, as she waited, Matthias didn\u2019t get up from his chair.She gave him a confused look.Matthias remained in his seat even after everyone had left. She then realized that the Duke canoeing with the village kids would be odder.Realizing that she had made a grave choice, Leyla leapt from her seat. The two boats carrying the children had already departed the bottom floor\u2019s boat hangar and headed towards the river. The servants were tirelessly rowing while Uncle Bill and Mrs. Grever kept an eye on the children in separate boats.\u201cTeacher! Teacher! Teacher!\u201dThe children laughed and waved their hand at her, who was standing beyond the railing.\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll be back!\u201dEven the timid Monica grinned with excitement.She could no longer catch up with the children. She was engrossed in her despair when a voice as cold as a river wind, suddenly broke the silence.\u201cSit down.\u201dLeyla jerked back. Matthias was looking at her with his legs crossed.\u201cLeyla.\u201dHe smiled, calling her name as if he was humming along to the tune.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One of its legs was tied with a red thread. It was unmistakably her carrier bird, Phoebe.\u201cWhy did you fly here?\u201dShe went up to the railing where Phoebe was resting.Phoebe\u2019s role as a letter-deliverer came to an end with Kyle\u2019s departure. These days, the bird has become her cherished pet. When the Duke went out for upland hunting, she always confined Phoebe in a cage. But, on the other days, that pigeon roamed freely around the Arvis forest.\u201cYou can\u2019t come here. Here is\u2026 .\u201dLeyla darted a wary look towards the Duke. They met eyes as his gaze swiveled from the children\u2019s boat to her.\u201cPhoebe?\u201dHis mention of Phoebe made her flinch.\u201cSo the bird\u2019s name is Phoebe?\u201d\u201cDo you know Phoebe?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Matthias tilted his head. \u201cJust ask the pigeon.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you claim you understood the bird\u2019s mind.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dLeyla was tight-lipped, unable to say anything more than a grimace. Matthias felt quite satisfied upon seeing her bite her lips because she couldn\u2019t debate him.With her back fully turned, Leyla whispered a few more words to her bird as if they could communicate with each other, but Matthias was certain she was mocking him without needing to hear her mutter.Phoebe began gliding towards the other bank of the river. After the bird was out of her sight, Leyla returned to her chair with a sense of alertness. She looked at Matthias with some trepidation before deciding to speak.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Duke.\u201dShe abruptly uttered words out of context.\u201cI apologize in Phoebe\u2019s stead for recklessly entering your annex and leaving.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll apologize in the bird\u2019s stead?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Leyla gravely replied to his scoff. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it came here, but I\u2019ll train it to make sure that this never happens again. So\u2026 so\u2026 Duke.\u201dShe began to sweat; her fear was audible.\u201cPlease \u2026..Please don\u2019t shoot Phoebe.\u201dOnly fear remained deep in her eyes as all her bewilderment and curiosity dwindled. Matthias kept mum, his crooked smirk on his lips seeming to fade as he stared into hers.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026\u201dAs his silence prolonged, her tone was heavily laden with desperation.\u201cOf course, I know you are Arvis\u2019s owner, but Phoebe\u2026.\u201dLeyla kept pleading though her pride was in pain. She was ready to beg once again but a servant appeared in front of them, pushing her to clamp her trembling lips.Matthias left the balcony after the servant informed him he got a phone call from the company\u2019s lawyer. Leyla hardly took her eyes off of him through the window. Her mind was imprinted with the horrors of his countless bird-killings. She couldn\u2019t relax unless he promised that he wouldn\u2019t shoot Phoebe.Matthias returned shortly after.Leyla no longer avoided his eyes like she used to; instead, she stared at him with persistence.\u201cDuke, Phoebe\u2026 .\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested in your bird.\u201dMatthias flatly cut off her vexing pleas. She heaved,\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cA target that doesn\u2019t run away. It\u2019s boring.\u201d\u201cThen are you not going to shoot?\u201dLeyla\u2019s eyes sparkled brighter, revealing hope and optimism. Her piercing gaze put Matthias in exasperation. Ever since Leyla Lewellin set her foot in Arvis, this was the first time they had eye contact that lasted this long.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dMatthias asked back without averting his gaze.He had no intention of hunting the carrier bird in the first place, but he was unwilling to give her a straightforward answer. For the first time he saw her like that: willingly clinging to him in order to beg for something.\u201cI don\u2019t think you will shoot.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because.. You\u2019re a gentleman.\u201d\u2018Pfft\u2026You only call me a gentleman when you\u2019re at a disadvantage.\u2019Matthias let out a vexed laugh at her hasty and brash answer. Leyla hurriedly added onto her words in anxiety.\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the type of person to hunt boring targets.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Leyla nodded along with her praise. \u201cYou\u2019re titled as the greatest marksman and gentleman in Carlsbar, I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t shoot Phoebe.\u201dSeeing her squirming as she talked, Matthias\u2019s laughter suddenly cracked up. The servants behind him exchanged conundrum glances, especially Mark Evers, his long-time assistant\u2014he was the most stunned of the others at the balcony.Not because Duke Herhardt didn\u2019t laugh much. But those in his \u2018immediate vicinity\u2019 knew that his courteous laughs were mostly a display of civility towards others. Even as a little boy, if Mark Evers\u2019 memory served him right, the Duke seldom laughed in a pleasant way.The boats heading downstream now had turned their bows back to the annex. The children\u2019s excited laughter and chatter mingled with his chortle.Leyla seemed eager for a definite answer, but Matthias continued to stay silent. He did nothing more than spectate her as she repeatedly wetted her lips in a panic. And she spoke up first.\u201cUh\u2026.. Duke?\u201dBoth her voice and eyes wavered, but not in a fearful way. Matthias did think her rosy cheeks, flushed with anticipation, were very attractive. Her eyes and delicate poise stated she wasn\u2019t trying to miss even the slightest of his facial expressions and body language.Matthias changed his mind about answering and instead rang the bell. One of the house staff rushed into the living room at his errand and brought out an ashtray and a pack of cigarettes.\u201cDuke\u2026?\u201dLeyla urged him on. She needed an answer.Phoebe was a bird she had been raising from its fledgling age. Beyond everything, that bird was like a symbol of her and Kyle\u2019s beautiful time they had spent together. She didn\u2019t ever want to lose Phoebe, even if those days would never return.Matthias took out a cigarette from the silver case and lighted it up. The thin layer of smoke slowly floated between their deliberate silence. The white puff played in her face. Matthias didn\u2019t dislike her outlook, who only looked at him and begged him. It would be great if this moment could continue to last forever, he thought, quite pathetically.\u2018Well, I should stop here for now.\u2019As he soon nodded his chin, Leyla\u2019s eyes glistened.\u201d Phoebe\u2026.You\u2019re really not going to shoot Phoebe, are you?\u201dHer questioning was very persistent.Matthias turned aside and flickered his cigarette ash. After attentively watching his gesture, Leyla grasped his meaning and retreated without pestering him further.She hardly believed his promise, but there were other servants on the balcony listening, so she felt positive Matthias would keep the promise he made with a lot of eyes watching him. She didn\u2019t know or care about Matthias von Herhardt, yet she had that feeling of trust in him.Leyla finally could sigh with relief and glance out of the railing, to the river beyond. The tranquility of the flowing river reflected the shadow of the forest with its autumnal leaves.Her lips draped in a smile. She had managed to protect Phoebe, as well as her precious memories.Her smile lit up as her relief grew.Matthias\u2019s eyes narrowed at her odd expression.\u00a0\u2018What good is it to guarantee the safety of a pigeon?\u2019He was unable to understand her, yet he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of her face.The cigarette he was holding between his long fingers burned slowly. A sense of unidentifiable annoyance and anxiety rose within the smoke. Both satiety and hunger battled each other to overtake him. The uncomfortable and queer feeling he had was as vivid as the vibrant colours of the season, which dyed the entire world. And as vague as the dream of last night when he opened his eyes.Matthias threw the cigarette in his hand into the ashtray. He was thirsty, perhaps from smoking a cigarette he didn\u2019t enjoy, but instead of taking a glass of water, he took out a new one. The unlit cigarette\u2019s tip loosely wrapped between his fingers slightly shook along with the wind.Leyla turned her head when she felt his stare on her. A smile still lingered on her beaming face, an emotion that shined more vividly than anger and fear, shame and tears could ever have.Matthias was pondering about what that emotion was when Leyla ripped away her smile with haste. She avoided his gaze and bowed deeply. She was only looking down at her fingertips, but Matthias felt quite humiliated at her actions.Humiliation.Leyla Lewellin had taught him the emotion that he now knew for sure.\u2018Look at you now, Leyla\u2019Matthias unknowingly laughed in vain.\u2018Now that you\u2019ve reached your goal, you\u2019re ignoring me again?\u2019He never knew Leyla Lewellin could act this sly. Her attitude was daft, yet it was also pretty cute. But her abrupt mood swings really displeased him.Matthias squeezed his unlit cigarette and tossed it again into the ashtray.After the sunshine-like mirth had disappeared, the terrace was just left in a dark shade.The gloomy place\u2026.he didn\u2019t like it.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The autumn picnic ended when the children were taken to school and safely returned to their homes.Leyla noticed tiredness had strained over her body the entire day. Her muscles were drained which made her sleepy, but she was happy with her first picnic with the children. Ironically, the person she was most worried about, was the key factor to the success of their autumn picnic, Duke Herhardt.\u201cFor the time being, I think Lady Brandt will be the most envied woman in the world.\u201d Mrs. Grever sighed while walking beside Leyla. \u201cShe will have both that handsome gentleman and the whole of Arvis. The world is so unfair at times like this. Do you know when they are getting married?\u201d\u201cI heard it\u2019s around next summer.\u201d\u201cIt will be a grandiose wedding that will stir the whole empire. Ah. I really envy her.\u201dLeyla just gave a moderate smile at Mr. Grever\u2019s overblown admiration.They split ways at a downtown junction. Leyla returned to Arvis after buying an armful of groceries. She was going to cook a delicious dinner for Uncle Bill, who had provided her a great help.\u2018I\u2019m going to make lots of my Uncle\u2019s favourite food.\u2019Impatience drove her steps faster. She started speed walking after entering the road leading to Arvis. But suddenly, her feet froze in the middle of the road when a middle-aged lady came from the opposite side. That woman also simultaneously stopped as she saw Leyla.That person\u2019s eyes was evocative of Kyle, Mrs. Etman..Her hands, holding the grocery bag, turned pale.\u2018What should I do?\u2019Leyla stood frozen in front of her eyes regardless of how hard she thought. It felt weird passing by her like a stranger but even weirder to greet her.After much hesitation, Leyla dipped her head in greeting without uttering a word, and Mrs. Etman accepted it with a silent nod.But as the stifling moment was about to end, Mrs. Etman opened her mouth.\u201cLeyla.\u201dLeyla swiveled in shock.\u201cIt ended up like this, but I really don\u2019t regret it.\u201dMrs. Etman sighed as she stood in front of Leyla. Neither hostility nor guilt contained in her eyes\u2014they were as lifeless as a clump of leaves.\u201cEven if my reputation fell to the ground and my relationship with Kyle turned sour, I still hindered your marriage. That\u2019s all I need.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dPerhaps, Leyla would feel much better if Mrs. Etman\u2019s tone was hostile.Each word Mrs. Etman uttered calmly in a tired voice pierced her heart like a shard of glass.After finishing what she had to say, Mrs. Etman started walking and passed her. The housekeeper, standing at a distance with a flustered face, followed her suit.Leyla hurried her way after giving a silent salute to the housekeeper, who threw a look of consolation and compassion towards her.She walked boldly and with a broad stride, then stopped like a toy with a loose spring.She peered down at her two feet on the ground, stretched her hand, and took a deep breath.\u2018Am I really a human?\u2019A sense of shame entered her thoughts.Leyla slowly opened her closed eyes and started walking towards the cabin where Uncle Bill was waiting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA white dove landed gently on the balcony\u2019s railing.Folding its wing, the bird naturally approached the bird feeder and pecked its food deliciously, doused in the golden light of the fading sun that seeped in between its white feathers.\u201cPhoebe.\u201dMatthias blurted out its name after seeing that bird perched on his window.\u2018Phoebe\u2019\u2014\u2018What a grand name for such a bird.\u2019His sneer at that bird-crazed woman flowed softly like a sigh.Matthias rose from his sofa and opened the balcony door. The river wind near the sunset felt cold and humid, playing in both up tempo gusts and gentle lulls.When he went close, the pigeon continued to eat its feed, undisturbed. That docile bird\u2019s personality contrasted sharply with that of its owner.Softly, the evening came with the sunset while he was leaning against the railing. Matthias closed his eyes so he could hear the wind whispering. Their dulcet tones became a feast for his ears. The gentle rustling sound of the autumn leaves, falling and dancing in the quiet, beautiful forest bloomed like a soothing lullaby.Everywhere he looked, he could only see Leyla in Arvis\u2019s autumn.He watched her diligently go to work by pedalling her bike and returning home with a tired face. In her spare time, she volunteered to do the gardener\u2019s work and sometimes scoured the forest with her big basket to collect mushrooms and wild berries.In his beautiful cage of Arvis, everything he had in this world stayed in its proper place.That perfect world satisfied him. More than enough to erase the disillusionment he tasted last summer after helping Linda Etman stop Kyle and Leyla\u2019s marriage.\u2018Leyla\u2026.she should be where she deserved to be.\u2019As he opened his eyes, Matthias could feel a semblance of satisfaction spreading over his system like a pleasurable intoxication.The stuffed pigeon soon left the balcony and flitted to the cottage, going back to its owner.He believed that the bird would come here again tomorrow and the day after. He had no interest in the bird\u2019s feelings, but he knew well how to tame it.To earn that carrier bird\u2019s heart, he just needed to provide the bird a safe place and let it eat to the fullest.It was a trick he had honed while serving in the military. Soldiers often used carrier pigeons to deliver messages when communication devices were poor, or there was a risk of information being leaked to the enemy. He was currently using the same method the military bird trainers used to tame Phoebe.Leyla\u2019s carrier bird, Phoebe, realized there was no use in flying to Kyle Etman\u2019s tightly shut window. A new food source had appeared, and the place was safe, so unhesitatingly, Phoebe would fly to his annex from now on. That bird was quite clever, unlike its foolish and clumsy owner.Matthias looked at the flying bird and suddenly frowned. His memory slithered back to the autumn picnic day\u2014 when her smile faded to nothingness the moment their eyes met.\u201cBut it\u2019s probably a smile you\u2019ve countlessly shown to the doctor\u2019s son.\u201dThe annex shade that shrouded the balcony became darker when his train of thoughts jumped to that conclusion.Ever since Leyla was a child, never once had she smiled in front of him, nor could she hold back her tears.So \u2026.he made her cry.If he couldn\u2019t make her laugh, he would have made her cry.Whether it was her smile or her tears, he was satisfied with everything about her.If all he could give her were tears, then he would make her shed them.He was also willing to break her heart.\u2018But what if you could give me something else?\u2019These days, Matthias often falls into such a reverie. He no longer wanted to see her being scared or angry at him.He simply wanted her to look only at him. Sometimes humoring him and smiling at him full of overwhelming bliss after he granted her wish.Now\u2026.he knew his desire\u2026Leyla Lewellin\u2026.He lusted for her\u2026All of her\u2026Everything about her\u2026.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYou\u2019ve gained weight, Phoebe.\u201dLeyla tutted as she peered at Phoebe snuggling in her hands. She mistook it for a puff of thick feathers preparing for the winter, but as she got a closer look, it was apparent that Phoebe had gained some weight.\u201cIs it because it\u2019s fall?\u201dCuckoo\u2026 Cuckoo\u2026. CuckooLeyla kept questioning Phoebe, but the bird seemed to ignore her.\u201cWhere are you eating now? You don\u2019t even have Kyle now\u2026\u201dHer last words, she unintentionally said, left her stunned. Tears welled up in her eyes, whenever his name came out.\u2018No, it\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t cry.\u2019Leyla tried to keep her tears from spilling out of her eyes. They had promised to take care of themselves, and she would do her best to keep that promise.She calmed herself down by taking a deep breath and then released her chubby Phoebe. That bird roamed around the yard for a while before flying to the far side of the forest.It was an ordinary day.She diligently finished her morning routine and went to work after seeing off Uncle Bill.The sound of her winding bicycle chain clicking along the Arvis\u2019 road, splendidly carpeted with autumnal leaves creating a noisy tune.\u201cTeacher!\u201dStudents who recognized her waved their hands as she entered the road in front of the school.Leyla dismounted her bike, greeted the children, and walked into the school.It was an ordinary day, but she felt a bunch of happiness.The children were much more obedient than usual, and they scored well on their mathematics and spelling tests. The languid warmth of the classroom she loved, the lunchtime chatter with Mrs. Grever she enjoyed, and the cloudless, high, bright blue sky beyond the window.She smiled.Leyla steeled her heart and smiled brightly every time she was reminded of Kyle at waking or on her way home from work.But, as she got closer to Arvis, she could no longer ignore the memories she shared with him as they walked through the streets together.Loneliness suddenly swallowed her up, taking what was once her inner light and replacing it with a darkness that overshadows each moment.Layla stopped her bike on the sideroad. She felt helpless.The myriad of memories gliding above the road snowballed into a deep regret.They couldn\u2019t live like brother and sister for the rest of their lives, as they weren\u2019t related by blood. Nor could they live as best friends as man and woman. But they never knew their relationship was meant to end in separation from the very beginning.They never once expected that they would love, get hurt, and become like this in the end\u2026As her vision began to blur, Leyla squirmed and bit her lip. She encouraged herself, closing her eyes as if she was enchanting a spell.\u2018I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll be fine for sure, so please take care of yourself, Kyle.\u2019Fortunately, she was able to contain her sobs and continue pedalling her bike.A black car approached from afar and eventually brushed past her.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias made the driver pull over the car at the entrance of Platanus road. After telling his aide to go back first, he was then left alone on the road, just like the day when last summer had begun.He took a leisurely walk, waiting for the approaching figure. The fallen leaves rustled underneath his shoes.When the sound of a bicycle running through the road was faintly heard, Matthias naturally slowed down his pace.He turned around at the same time Leyla stopped her bike at an appropriate distance from him.The expected scene unfolded before his still eyes; Leyla was in front of him, along with her bicycle.\u201cHello, Duke \u2026Herhardt.\u201dLeyla awkwardly greeted him after glancing around. Her braided, curled hair was half loose and fluttered in the wind. She didn\u2019t seem to have a knack for dressing up as her hair was always tied too neatly or too loosely like today.Still, he quite liked her clumsy appearance.Matthias nodded his head in a straight posture, one hand behind his back. Leyla blinked her emerald eyes while holding tight her bike\u2019s handlebars. Whatever she did, she always looked uptight whenever she encountered him.\u201cWell then\u2026. Excuse me.\u201dAfter bowing, Leyla dragged her bicycle past him and kept walking.\u201cYou have to act like a proper lady, Leyla.\u201dMatthias warned, staring at her back.Leyla had just hopped on the saddle when she flinched and pulled back the bike she was about to pedal.\u201cYou know that. If you want me to be a gentleman, you need to behave like a lady.\u201dMatthias slowly approached her, who could neither get off the bike nor step on the pedal. He continued,\u201cAnd I need to be a gentleman for your bird to be safe.\u201dLeyla immediately turned her head. She frowned and stepped off her bike. Matthias smirked as he tilted his head and peered down at her. Her moist eyes looked petrified, but her dainty twisted lips voiced displeasure and defiance.\u2018What a cranky woman.\u2019After a long stare at her, who pathetically trembled at his joke, Matthias walked forward as if nothing had happened. Having no other choice, Leyla dragged her bicycle and followed him from behind with a heavy stride.Matthias sighed and turned around. \u201cI never asked for you to act as my maid.\u201dLeyla, who grimly looked down at her toes and followed him like a shadow, suddenly raised her head, taken aback.\u201cYes? Ah\u2026 .\u201dDespite her stubbornness, she was smart enough to understand what he meant. She quickly took a couple more steps towards him. Her gloomy expression conveyed her displeasure, but they were still one step apart.Matthias scoffed as he got his wish and stepped back.As he began to walk again, Leyla carefully matched his pace. With a bicycle between them, they strolled side by side on the Platanus road.There were no words spoken between them. The refreshing evening breeze was filled with only the sound of bicycle wheels spinning and falling leaves being tramped.He was a man who walked very slowly with those long legs of his.Leyla meekly glanced at him after turning her eyes at the road that seemed to be fading away. He was a languid man, but his pace was especially slow today.She wasn\u2019t sure whether she was feeling that way because of the awkward situation.He was a man of similar height as Kyle, but he gave off a bigger, and domineering presence. She reasoned, it might\u2019ve been because of his straight, elegant posture and distinctive eyes. His physical appearance also looked firmer and broader than Kyle.\u2018Maybe that\u2019s why he seems so different.\u2019Leyla made her own findings and deliberately moved her gaze upward. She observed his white, smooth hands, his dark grey suit, his delicately shaped tie, expressionless lips and his\u2026 eyes.His sapphire eyes noticed her gaze and beheld her.Leyla suddenly was seized with instinctive fear. She meant to bend her head, but her mind wandered elsewhere.As he thoroughly looked into her eyes as if he was captivated, Matthias opened his lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His choice of words left Leyla befuddled when she grasped his gybe after a moment of startlement.\u2018This man! Is he trying to pick a fight again?\u2019\u201cI know. My hair\u2019s a little\u2026. blowsy.\u201dLeyla\u2019s tone sharpened at his unforeseen criticism.\u201cA little?\u201dScoffingly, Matthias asked while his scrutinizing eyes traced her top to bottom.Under his watchful gaze, Leyla squeezed the bike\u2019s handles, battling to suppress her urge to run away. Her incapability of restraining the weird emotions stirring in her body has already made her upset as stood opposite to him. She doesn\u2019t want to look like an easy target by blushing at the very sight of a man.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just untie your hair?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to, but they said I won\u2019t look like a proper teacher.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d He asked, the lines on his fair forehead creasing together in suspicion.\u201cThe headmistress.\u201dLeyla replied and quickly averted her gaze when she felt her cheeks getting warmer as his eyes lingered on her.\u201cShe said that if I look too young, I won\u2019t seem like a teacher with authority.\u201d She hesitantly continued to speak, fearing that the profound silence between them would make things even more awkward. \u201cSo the headmistress advised me not to have a \u2018student-like\u2019 hairstyle.\u201dAs soon as she concluded, his faint laughter that resembled a soothing breeze flew out, quickly turning her earlobes into a deep shade of burning red.She felt like a fool and dreaded looking at him, once again.With a scoff adorning his face, Matthias peered down at the petite woman before him. \u201cSo, that blowy, tied-up hair is the symbol of a teacher\u2019s authority\u2026\u201d His eyes still brimmed with sarcasm as he witnessed the look of hurt pride on her face- coyer but cute.\u201cI\u2019m practising a lot, so I\u2019ll get better at styling my hair soon.\u201d She retaliated in the same tone, leaving him spellbound for a moment.\u2018This woman never wants to give in, even if it kills her, doesn\u2019t she?\u2019Her persistence caused Matthias to smirk once again.\u201cWell, Let\u2019s see then.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m damn sure that I can do it. In case my skill doesn\u2019t get any better\u2026I\u2019ll just cut it short.\u201d\u201cCut it?\u201dAt her casual reply, the beaming smile on Matthias face faded all at once and the very next instant, when he saw Leyla nodding thoughtfully, his eyes narrowed as if he witnessed something terrible.\u201cYes. Then I\u2019d look a lot more mature and\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cut it.\u201dEven though his command sounded oddly soft and calm, Leyla couldn\u2019t help but look at him in puzzlement. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I need your permission to grow or cut my hair?\u201d She retorted in a surprisingly annoyed tone.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful\u2026, your hair.\u201dHer irate question was answered with a stupefying reply that was nearly impossible to believe.Above all\u2026. that sounded ridiculous.Doubting her ears, Leyla frowned at him, but unlike her agitated self, Mathias remained calm as he beheld her state passively.\u201cIt\u2019s like a wing.\u201dHis wintry voice echoed the same as he insulted and hurt her with a single statement.Leyla recalled how his voice remained unchanged and calm, even though he kept throwing her terrible slurs.As she stood fuming in anger, her memory took a walk to that old summer day of their first meeting. That day, when she first saw the Duke Herhardt from the treetop, his cold voice remained tranquil and serene, even when he came perilously close to shooting a child. His soothing voice imprinted itself in her mind ever since.Leyla clearly remembered jumping down from the tree and running towards Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage, exclaiming at the existence of such a human being.\u2018The- There\u2019s a man in the forest! A tall man!\u2019She poured out a bunch of random words doused in admiration as she struggled to catch her breathing.\u2018 He has black hair, and his eyes were blue. And his voice was light as a feather .\u2019At that moment, only the feathers of the water birds came into her mind as she struggled to explain the texture of the voice that left her smitten. Little Leyla, who regarded those soft feathers as her precious possession, couldn\u2019t compare his voice with anything else but to the feathers that she gathered while ambling along the banks of the Schulter River.Flustered by his blatant words, Leyla hurriedly avoided his gaze. The Duke\u2019s cruel words would rather hurt her so he could remain as the person she disliked and the most feared one in her heart. After all, it was the Duke Herhardt whom she knew of.However, no matter how long she waited Matthias spoke no word nor a familiar insult escaped from his lips.As the leaves from the autumn trees fell one at a time, he simply walked away from a confused Leyla who was fretting whether his odd compliment was her own hallucination or not.Snapping out of her thoughts, Leyla neatened her hair that cascaded down her shoulders, only to flutter by the autumn wind. The sudden gush of cold wind shook her a little, prompting her hand holding the steering handle to slip. Leyla, who made a vague effort to grab the handle, crashed to the ground along with her bicycle.\u201cAckhh!\u201dThe thud of the bicycle colliding with the pavement echoed over the quiet road, as well as her scream.Matthias spectated the comedy scene unfolding before his eyes with a faint grimace. He unknowingly let out a sneer when he watched the hilarious sight of Leyla\u2019s struggle to stop her own bicycle from crushing her to the dusty road.\u201cYou always seem to trip and fall.\u201dLeyla bit her lip in shame as he laughed. However, she felt relieved.\u2018Just laugh, harass me, and leave.\u2019She hopefully waited for him to do so. But Matthias quietly pulled up her bike, picked up her bag that had bounced off far away, came back to her, and knelt.\u201cNnn..no-no, It\u2019s mine!\u201d Leyla panickingly snatched the bag from Matthias when he was about to pick her scattered belongings, \u201cI-I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201dHer blatant hostility made Matthias\u2019s brows scrunched.\u201cI..I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Leyla mumbled as she lowered her eyes and began to collect her stuff with trembling hands, even though Matthias had done nothing to frighten her.Though her actions and shaky voice agitated him, Matthias decided to watch her patiently. When his eyes caught her flushed cheeks and neck, his ire toned down when he figured out that Leyla was just too embarrassed and shy to stay next to him.Matthias stood up in front of her, watching her scramble to gather her dropped items under the shadow of his looming figure. She seemed very distraught, as she even stuffed the roadside leaves and stones into her bag. Her quirkiness somehow had quelled Matthias\u2019 annoyance.After she finished packing her bag, Leyla quickly got up to her feet. She looked at him, oblivious to the dust that was all over her clothes and hands.\u201cI know it\u2019s rude, but Duke\u2026.\u201dHer perplexed eyes drifted between Matthias and the mansion entrance on the opposite side of the road, wondering what to do next.\u201cIf it\u2019s rude of me to go ahead of you, I\u2019ll wait until you leave first.\u201dShe spoke so boldly as she no longer wanted to walk together with him. Yet, Matthias could see the anxiety in her eyes. Her attitude was very invasive, but he tolerated it, for now, knowing that he also couldn\u2019t walk alongside her after passing the entrance.\u201cGo on.\u201dHis permission surprised her.\u201cMe first?\u201d She confusingly asked to confirm,Matthias clicked his chin instead of answering. Leyla\u2019s face eventually lit up, and quickly lowered her head,\u201cThank you, Duke.\u201dMatthias seemed to take offence with her excessive politeness; it was rather like an affront to him.Leyla made her way to the entrance first, but she halted in her tracks to look back before getting onto her bike. It was evident that Matthias was oddly kind towards her, but Leyla\u2019s eyes remained wide with mistrust as she frowned at the man.After a quick glance, she tilted her head and rode off on her back.\u2018Should I have made her cry instead?\u2019Matthias\u2019 regret belatedly came, but he kept on walking with an expression that didn\u2019t seem to look unpleasant until the shiny pen on the ground suddenly caught his attention.Agilely, Matthias picked up the pen of a woman who easily fell and lost her things.His blue eyes followed the girl while his grip on the pen turned tighter as he took a moment to contemplate whether to stop her or not.Leyla was near enough that she could hear him if he called, but Matthias kept mum.He strolled the road while spinning the pen with his long fingers. While Leyla, who diligently cycled her bike, soon disappeared beyond the Arvis gate.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThat bird came again.\u201dMark Evers smilingly informed the man who sat facing away from the window. Even without much explanation, Matthias understood his words and didn\u2019t bother to take a look at the window as it has become a part of his daily routine.It was the time for the visit of \u2018Phoebe\u2019, the pigeon much gentler and smarter than its owner.Leaning against a chair by the fireplace, Matthias had finished today\u2019s work by signing the last document. After his aide took the paper and retreated he was left to his own devices in the living room.Matthias shut the lid of his fountain pen and glanced out of the window. Phoebe, as always, was sitting on the railing, preoccupied with gulping down its food.He turned his gaze away from the bird to the thin pen in his hand and began to examine it carefully. The pen owner\u2019s name was engraved in gold on the cap.\u2018Leyla Lewellin.\u2019It seemed to be a brand-new pen and didn\u2019t look like she bought it with her own money, so it was likely a gift from the gardener.Matthias hoped so. He was sure that Leyla would do everything to get it back if it was Bill Remmer\u2019s gift.\u2018Would she have noticed by now?\u2019Matthias stared at the pen with a crooked grin and re-opened the pen cap. Acting like a gentleman towards a woman who had praised him didn\u2019t seem like a bad idea. Besides, it was time for the pigeon to pay for its own meal.Matthias paced up to the balcony, folding a letter with a single short sentence. He chuckled at the thought of the bird\u2019s owner fleeing on her bicycle while tying the letter to the bird\u2019s ankle, which dociely leaned its body towards him.After tying the note, Matthias flew Phoebe into the sky.And the carrier pigeon began to wing towards the gardener\u2019s cottage eagerly.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Once the coppery sun settled behind the horizon, Phoebe returned along with the night.Leyla was sitting and staring mindlessly at the empty desk when the pecking sound from the window startled her. She turned her head and called the bird in a chiding tone\u201cPhoebe!\u201dLeyla hurriedly wrapped the shawl over her shoulders as she stood from her chair. The chilly wind blew into the room when she threw open the window.\u201cAre you hungry? Wait a minute\u2026 uh?\u201dThe letter tied to Phoebe\u2019s leg made her pupils widen in astonishment. She even rubbed her eyes because she thought she was mistaken, but a letter was tied there.\u201c\u2026 Kyle?\u201dShe unconsciously called his name, even though she knew it wasn\u2019t him.\u2018No, Kyle already left. There\u2019s no way anyone would tie a letter to Phoebe\u2019s feet.\u2019Leyla stared blankly at Phoebe before tremblingly opening the letter. As she skimmed through the brief sentence written in the letter, her countenance quickly changed from curiosity to dismay.She gasped and unwittingly stepped back while the letter slipped from her fingers. It gently fluttered onto the floor beneath the window.Leyla took a step back, then another. She stared at the letter, blinking her eyes repeatedly. Her mind had snapped back into reality when her back slammed against the closet.\u201cI-It can\u2019t be!\u201dMumbling in a quivering voice, Leyla hurriedly rummaged through her bag, but the pen she was searching for was nowhere to be found. She was even more baffled by the stones and leaves coming out of her bag since she had no idea how those things had gotten into her bag.Leyla frowned and staggered back to the window. Her letter-holding hand had lost its colour and was now as pale as the ring of moonlight.\u2018[Where\u2019s your pen, Leyla?]\u2019Once again, she read the note Phoebe had brought in and wrapped her arms around her head.She sighed.\u2018No way.\u2019Leyla muttered the words a few more times, but she knew nothing would change.Guu\u2026 Guuu\u2026 Guu\u2026.In the white moonlight of an autumn night, Phoebe, the pigeon that the Duke fattened, calmly cried.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayArvis was bustling with the preparations for Herhardt\u2019s dinner party.As Leyla walked home from school, the roads were swarming with carriages and vehicles. Uncle Bill had been extremely busy these past few days, engrossed in arranging flowers for the mansion\u2019s interior. It was that time of the year when flowers start wilting, so he had to gather some from greenhouses and procure the rest from local flower gardens.Leyla helped her uncle out by making frequent trips downtown to buy flowers. Her hectic days made her feel lucky; at the very least, she could forget about her missing pen and her unanswered letter from the Duke. But now that her work was done, she had to return to Arvis.As the entrance to the mansion loomed closer, Leyla slowed her pace.Fortunately, Duke Herhardt seemed to have brushed the matter aside. Or more likely, he didn\u2019t have a chance to ponder over it. He, too, had been swamped with work lately, and Phoebe, who had been secretly communicating with him, was confined within a cage in the backyard.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201dShe had uttered these very words at least a hundred times since Phoebe brought in the Duke\u2019s letter.\u201cHow did he come up with the idea of taming Phoebe and using it as his carrier bird?\u201dShe hadn\u2019t lived a long life, nor was she acquainted with many people. However, within her lifetime, Duke Matthias von Herhardt was by far the most strange and yet enigmatic man Leyla Lewellin had ever come across.\u201cWhy does he keep taking other people\u2019s things? Is he a kleptomaniac?\u201d Leyla kicked an innocent stone on the path as she grumbled.She didn\u2019t want to meet the duke, even though she needed to get her pen back. She didn\u2019t really know why she was determined to avoid him even more now, but Leyla felt like she had to.Just as Leyla was about to enter the mansion from a side entrance, a blaring honk startled her. She swivelled to see the Brandt family\u2019s car park right in front of her.As the back seat window slowly rolled down, Leyla approached the car with stiff steps.\u201cLeyla, long time no see.\u201dSitting inside was the familiar face of Claudine Brandt.\u201cHow have you been?\u201d Claudine beamed, scanning Leyla from head to toe.Leyla froze for a moment. A familiar sense of guilt, like that of a child who had made a grave mistake, gripped her tight. It was the same emotion she had felt last summer, on the day of Duke Herhardt and the Lady\u2019s engagement ceremony. The memory of her first kiss being stolen by Claudine\u2019s fianc\u00e9 never failed to make her feel pathetic.The Duke\u2019s gentle voice, his soft laughter, and the touch of his firm, fervent hands flitted across her mind, but Claudine\u2019s gaze brought her back to the present.Clasping her frozen hands together, Leyla, as she\u2019d always done, greeted Claudine with a polite bow.\u201cHello, Lady Claudine.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was a surprise to no one that Herhardt\u2019s dinner party had ended on a perfect note. Always the epitome of grace and elegance, the two hostesses of the party were consistent throughout. In the Berg Empire, the name Herhardt had earned the epithet \u2018perfection\u2019. A mishap in Herhardt\u2019s dinner party would merely heighten everyone\u2019s unbridled curiosity.\u201cWould it be alright if we took a walk in the greenhouse for a while?\u201dClaudine politely asked Elysee after everyone had moved on to chat in the living room. Standing on the other side of the room were the people Claudine had referred to \u2013 her fianc\u00e9 and her cousin.\u201cOf course, go ahead.\u201d Elysee von Herhardt readily consented. \u201cYou young people do need to spend some time together.\u201dWith her subtle tone, the ladies surrounding Elysee burst into laughter in tandem, as if they were dancing in rhythm.Claudine exited the living room and Matthias together with Riette followed suit, leaving behind the ladies who began gossiping about the youngsters\u2019 love affairs.\u201cOh, Duke Herhardt, Madam Norma granted me permission to expand this greenhouse when I become the Duchess of Arvis,\u201d said Claudine, her radiant voice permeating the tranquil greenhouse in the dark.\u201cI see.\u201dMatthias\u2019s lips twitched with a faint smile.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go along with whatever my Lady wishes.\u201dClaudine already knew what Matthias would answer, but she still nodded with a pleasant smile. \u201cYou can look forward to it. I\u2019m confident that I can truly love this magnificent greenhouse, Arvis\u2019 Heaven.\u201dClaudine walked along the pathway with a spring in her step. Although she was being escorted by her fianc\u00e9, most of her conversations ended up revolving around Riette.\u201cMaster.\u201dClaudine had just begun talking about what tropical plants to grow in the expanded greenhouse when a servant arrived to see Matthias. Someone had sought him out to discuss business-related matters.\u201cCome back quickly.\u201d Claudine smiled as she let go of her fianc\u00e9\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll continue my walk with Riette.\u201d\u201cI always end up as the Duke\u2019s substitute for my dear Lady Brandt.\u201dDespite his grumbling, Riette willingly lent his arm to Claudine.After Matthias and his servant departed, Claudine and Riette were the only ones left in the greenhouse, surrounded by the soft lull of the flowing fountain.They resumed their prior discussion as well as their stroll. Claudine\u2019s visualization of expanding the greenhouse was quite specific; she had already made up her mind about which particular plants to import and how to landscape them.\u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve already become Duchess Herhardt. Your love for Arvis exceeds your love for your fianc\u00e9,\u201d Riette surmised as he turned to look at her after listening to her ideas.Claudine nodded without a hint of shame. \u201cEither way, I\u2019m still showing love for Herhardt.\u201d\u201cYou two really are something.\u201dRiette\u2019s laugh was one of defeat.\u201cMatthias is pretty cold, are you okay with that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cDuke Herhardt doesn\u2019t love anyone. He never loved you before, doesn\u2019t love you now, and will never love you in the future.\u201d\u201cWhich prestigious nobleman marries for love?\u201d\u201cSome do! It would surely happen if Lady Brandt would simply become my wife.\u201dAs usual, Riette kept his expression and tone light and casual. Claudine just flashed a smile in response.\u201cRiette, I\u2019ve been going in and out of Arvis with my mother for ten years.\u201dClaudine turned to look at Riette.\u201cDo you know what that means?\u201d\u201cIt means, for ten years now, the aristocrats of this empire have already fancied you as Duchess Herhardt.\u201d\u201cRight, Riette, this is why I like you.\u201dClaudine laughed softly and placed her hand back on Riette\u2019s arm.Riette calmly escorted his cousin. The subtle tension between them soon disappeared as their casual conversation and laughter flowed back in.\u201cI also want to raise a peacock after I expand this place.\u201dClaudine changed the topic while observing the birds in the greenhouse.\u201cIs this the birth of a bird-loving couple?\u201d Riette asked sarcastically.\u201cRiette!\u201d\u201cThe bird is still there, by the way. That pretty little bird who dwells in the Duke\u2019s bedroom.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Duke Herhardt ought to have at least some small pleasures. We should respect his wishes.\u201d\u201cI hope it stays just at that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not worth your worries. No matter how pretty it is, you can\u2019t bestow the title of Duchess to a bird, Riette.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true.\u201d Riette failed to refute. No matter how much Matthias adored the canary, a bird was just a bird. \u201cDo you know how long a canary lives? Does it have a long life?\u201d He asked.Claudine tilted her head, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I hope that noisy bird doesn\u2019t live too long.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say that we should respect the Duke\u2019s small pleasures?\u201d\u201cYes, but if that bird dies, there will be another bird who\u2019ll entertain Duke Herhardt.\u201d\u201cClaudine, I truly want to give my blessings to you and Matthias.\u201d Riette laughed absent-mindedly as he gazed at Claudine\u2019s face, \u201cYou two are such a perfect match.\u201dRiette felt a brief pang of pity for Matthias\u2019s little bird. The poor bird was bound to hover around the well-matched couple helplessly.Claudine\u2019s lips lifted to a natural smile. Seeing her cruel, yet beautiful face, Riette blurted out, \u201cShould I become acquainted with that bird for my precious cousin?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had that kind of hobby.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not my cup of tea, but she\u2019s still pretty.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy.\u201d Claudine giggled as if she were having a lot of fun. \u201cThat bird may look pretty, but she has the pride of a princess.\u201d\u201cHah. Do I look like the type to easily fail?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 but I\u2019m indeed curious. Will you be able to become friends with that haughty bird?\u201dClaudine was no longer smiling, her features as cold as the window panes reflecting the moonlight.\u201cIf you succeed, I\u2019d be happy to send you a congratulatory gift.\u201d\u201cWhat gift?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t gratitude and love enough?\u201dTheir ostentatious smiles dissipated as the pair\u2019s intense stare-down grew profound.\u201cNot bad.\u201dAs the door to the greenhouse opened, Riette let out a low sigh and the pair made their way forward. Matthias had returned.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Neither the carrier bird nor Leyla had returned. Everything was exactly the same as it had been prior to him sending the letter.Matthias scoffed as he looked up at the sky, where the white dove used to flit about. He laughed coldly, bitter and borderline angry.\u201cYou can go back now.\u201dMatthias declared to the servant waiting in front of his balcony door.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be waiting in front of the annex when it\u2019s time for departure.\u201dMark Evers left a polite greeting and returned with the rest of the staff.Left to his own devices, Matthias let his mind wander as he looked down at the tranquil river below his balcony. He believed that Leyla had been too preoccupied with assisting the gardener recently. But now\u2026 that was no longer the case.After lifting his cuff to check his watch, Matthias paced up and down his balcony. There was still some time left before his afternoon appointment. Also, it was the weekend, so Leyla Lewellin would probably be in her cabin.Thus, he deduced a fair conclusion and decided to follow through with his plan without hesitation.Matthias walked down the riverside and entered a forest path carpeted with fallen leaves.He was filled with regret.It flooded through him hot and thick, darker than the colour of autumn leaves.\u2018I should\u2019ve hurt her until she cried.\u2019However, he soon found Leyla Lewellin. She was hanging laundry near the cottage\u2019s fences. She looked very calm and relaxed, enough to make Matthias seem foolish for restlessly waiting around for the past week.Matthias stood still and watched her with discretion. Leyla continued hanging the clean bedding, her attention entirely focused on her task. She pulled left and right, pulled once again, and then twisted the sheet tight until it was dry enough to hang.Her proud smile added to Matthias\u2019 bewilderment.\u2018Ha\u2026 Would you look at that?\u2019Lately, he\u2019d been thinking about those words often. She was annoyingly cute yet ferocious, and she always amused him with her quirky attitude. Matthias felt frustrated with himself for being so disarmed by her.Leyla turned around just as Matthias took a step forward. Her body stiffened like a pole as soon as she saw him. So far, he had thought her actions were very adorable, but Matthias now decided to change his outlook.Leyla swivelled and started running. When she disappeared beyond the yard, Matthias realized that she was running away from him.\u201cThat woman\u2026\u201dThe sight of her running away as if she had seen a ghost made Matthias scoff. It was amusing to watch and more amusing to think that she believed she could dare run away from him.He withheld his sentiments for now. After he stopped laughing, Matthias began to chase her.Leyla ran out of the yard and towards the harvesting fields on the opposite end of the Schulter river. Matthias\u2019 strides grew longer, and the gap between the pair narrowed. Leyla looked back in fear, and then\u2026 she stumbled.She finally got caught under a willow tree near the river. Leyla struggled against him, but Matthias had grasped onto her shoulders tight and caged her between the tree trunk and his body. His hands were blazing as he aggressively grabbed her matted hair.When he looked down, Matthias was greeted by the sight of a tearful Leyla.He smiled.\u201cWhere are you going, Leyla?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
