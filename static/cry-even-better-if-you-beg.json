The child swallowed when his tanned face, hidden in the shadow of the broad brim, was revealed.For Bill, the child\u2019s reaction was nothing out of the ordinary. Anyone who first saw Bill Remmer usually reacted the same way because of his rugged appearance.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Bill\u2019s face appeared more frightening as he frowned upon the child.\u201cHello, Uncle Bill. I am Leyla Lewellin. I came from Lovita.\u201dThe child spoke clearly and slowly.Lovita\u2026 Bill soon realized why her accent had sounded a little different.\u201cDid you cross the border to the Berg Empire and come here all by yourself?\u201d\u201cYes. I came by train.\u201dThe child smiled awkwardly, as she unnaturally straightened her posture. At that moment, the postman who had brought the child approached them from behind.\u201cAh. This child finally met you, Mr. Remmer.\u201d\u201cGood timing. Why did you bring her here?\u201d\u201cShe was walking all alone with her luggage in front of the station. So, when I asked her where she was going, she said she was on her way to find Bill Remmer, the gardener of the Herhardt family. I brought her here because I was on my way to deliver some letters.\u201dThe postman explained with a smile and handed over an envelope to Bill Remmer. It was a letter from a distant relative living in the neighboring country of Lovita.Bill immediately ripped the envelope open. The letter contained the story of an orphaned child who had previously been taken in by relatives who were now no longer able to foster her because of their \u201cpoor\u201d circumstances.The child\u2019s name was Leyla Lewellin. The little girl standing in front of Bill was the orphan mentioned in the letter.\u201cDamned people. They sure are telling me this news fast.\u201dAstonished, Bill lost his breath. No one in Lovita could foster this little orphan. Bill Remmer was the last among those who had a direct connection with the child. So they had delivered the child to him.According to the letter, Bill could leave the child in the orphanage if his situation was not favorable enough for raising her.Bill grumbled and tossed the crumpled paper to the floor. \u201cThese people should go to hell. I don\u2019t understand how they could send this little girl here all by herself.\u201dAs he understood the full extent of the situation, Bill\u2019s face turned red with outrage. The child was treated like a mere toy, passed from one relative to another, and doomed to be dumped when no one else desired her. Eventually, she was sent off to a foreign country and given the address of a distant relative she had never met.\u201cExcuse me, Uncle Bill. I am not that young.\u201dThe little girl who had been observing Bill quietly suddenly spoke up.\u201cI\u2019ll be twelve in a couple of weeks.\u201dBill chuckled with delight as he listened to her rather mature manner of speech. He felt reassured when he learned that she was older than expected, considering the girl looked smaller than her age.After the postman who had delivered the troublesome girl left, the two were left alone in the garden. Bill covered his head with his hands and prayed to God for help.Although they were distant relatives, from afar, they seemed more like a father and his daughter. Bill had not seen his distant relatives in over 20 years, but now he was trapped with a child he had never known existed until today.Even though it was chilly outside, the child wore only a thin layer of clothing. She looked as skinny as an iron-skewer. Her lime green eyes and gold-threaded hair were all Bill could see of her.Bill came to a conclusion; He couldn\u2019t take care of her.However, the only choice then was to place her in an orphanage, which drove him crazy. Bill cursed the relatives a second time for dragging him into this mess. The little girl flinched and began chewing her red lips.\u201cFollow me.\u201d Bill led the way as he shook his head in frustration. \u201cLet us get some food first before I make a decision.\u201dHis blunt words were carried away by the evening breeze. The child\u2019s timid steps gradually became light and joyful as the two walked closer to Bill\u2019s quarters.***\u201cIs that all you\u2019re eating?\u201dThe child was carrying a small plate, which Bill frowned at.\u201cYes. I only eat a little.\u201dThe child smiled politely.\u201cChild, I hate children who eat very little.\u201dThe light from the table lamp shone down on the child\u2019s slender wrist, which was revealed under the sleeve that had been carelessly folded up.\u201cYou should eat everything like a cow.\u201dBill\u2019s face became more stern. Slowly blinking her eyes, the troubled Leyla put another loaf of meat and bread onto her plate and hurriedly started gobbling up her food.\u201cI can\u2019t eat like a cow, but uncle, I can eat quite well.\u201d Leyla showed a broad smile with bread crumbs strewn over her dainty lips.\u201cYes. I can definitely see that.\u201d Bill laughed and poured the whiskey into his tall glass. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of me?\u201d Bill\u2019s face was scrunched up as he attempted to frighten her.But Leyla just simply stared at him, not daring to look away. \u201cNot at all.\u201d She said. \u201cYou don\u2019t yell at me. You gave me lots of delicious food. So I believe you to be a good person.\u201d\u2018What kind of life has this child been living?\u2019Bill pondered as he refilled his beer glass. The letter had stated that the child\u2019s mother had abandoned her husband and child to elope with another man. The child\u2019s father, who had been devastated by the betrayal, became an alcoholic and died of alcohol poisoning. Following that, the girl was raised in the homes of other relatives, only to be abandoned by them in the end.Although the child had lived a tragic life, Bill still thought it was a ridiculous idea for him to be the one to raise her.Bill Remmer sipped his beer and decided that he would make his decision by next week.***\u201cDid everyone hear? Bill Remmer, the gardener, has started taking care of a young girl.\u201dA young maid dashed into the lounge where the servants spent their leisure time. The servants who had been taking a break turned their attention to the young maid.\u201cA girl? Mr. Remmer? It\u2019d be more reasonable if he chose to raise a lion or elephant instead.\u201dOne of the servants made a snorting noise.Bill Remmer, the Herhardt household\u2019s gardener, was a man who possessed a natural talent for growing flowers. Despite his brusque temper, he had been able to keep his job as a gardener for the past 20 years, all thanks to his talent.He was deeply trusted by the Herhardt family. Especially Norma, the duchess. Because of her unique love of flowers, she understood and accepted Bill\u2019s gardening as well as tantrums. She also decided to give the gardener a cottage in the woods behind the manor house of Herhardt.Life was easy for Bill Remmer.He worked in the garden and returned to the cottage for a rest. Despite his time drinking with his fellow workers, he spent most of his time surrounded by flowers and trees. Even after his wife died of an illness decades earlier, he never got attached to another woman.That Bill Remmer was raising a little girl?The servants who were relaxing in the lounge came to an agreement that the rumor was utter nonsense.Until one of the maids sitting by the window shouted,\u201cOh my. It must be true! Look over there.\u201dThe maid pointed over the glass window with her eyes wide open. The servants all rushed to the window at the same time and their faces lit up with surprise. Bill Remmer was planting with his body hunched down on the other side of the garden, and the rumored petite girl was following in his footsteps.As she churned along, the girl\u2019s golden hair, braided in a single strand, shook back and forth like a pendulum.\u201cI\u2019ve still not decided.\u201dBill repeatedly gave the same answer to any questions about the child.\u201cI can\u2019t leave her here, so I\u2019ll have to think about it.\u201dWhile Bill\u2019s thoughts went on through the spring and into the summer, Leyla Lewellin slowly became a permanent resident of the Herhardt estate.The child\u2019s diligent stroll through the gardens and forests had already become a familiar scene for the Herhardt servants.\u201cI think she\u2019s grown a bit.\u201d The Herhardt\u2019s chef, Madam Mona, laughed as she stared out the window. Leyla was staring at the grass and flowers behind the forest cottage that were just starting to bloom.\u201cShe still has a long way to go. She\u2019s still smaller than average girls.\u201d\u201cBill Remmer, take a look at her. Kids are not the same as your plants. They aren\u2019t going to grow in a day or two.\u201d Madam Mona lowered her basket onto the table with a shake of her head.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cCookies and cake. There was a tea party at the manor yesterday.\u201d\u201cI hate sweets.\u201d\u201cReally? This is for Leyla\u201dBill Remmer\u2019s dark brows furrowed at Madam Mona\u2019s abrupt response. That child was not supposed to be here, but the Duke\u2019s servants had started to look after Leyla daily.They would greet her, bring her food, and sometimes pay her a visit, and Bill Remmer was having a tough time dealing with it.\u201cYou should buy some clothes for her. The young lady\u2019s skirt seems to be about to go up her knees now.\u201d Madam Mona asked him as she watched Leyla chasing a bird. Bill was unable to refute. Even in his eyes, it seemed as if Leyla was wearing unfitted clothes.\u201cOh my! Oh my! Look at her!\u201dMadam Mona was about to leave when she quickly pointed to Leyla and shouted in dismay.Bill cast a queer glance in the direction Madam Mona was pointing. As the bird she had been chasing landed on a tree branch, Leyla began climbing up the tree swiftly, with athletic and light movements like a squirrel.\u201cShe sure has a talent for climbing trees.\u201dBill\u2019s unconcerned response drew a scowl from Madam Mona. \u201cBill Remmer! You were aware of her habit of climbing trees and yet you chose to overlook it? How the hell are you raising your child?\u201d\u201cAs you can see, she\u2019s growing strong and well.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re raising that girl like a wild beast! My God.\u201d Madam Mona raised her voice and made a fuss. But Bill just snooped around the window deafeningly. He watched Leyla sit on a thin branch in the thicket, looking at the little birds playing around.After watching over her for a few months, Leyla Lewellin had proven to be a curious girl who wanted to learn more about the world. Flowers and grass, birds and insects. Anything that caught her attention amazed her and piqued her curiosity.One night when Leyla hadn\u2019t returned for dinner, Bill had gone deep into the forest to find her sitting by the river staring at a flock of water birds. She had been so engrossed in her observation that she hadn\u2019t even noticed Bill calling her name over and over.Madam Mona had returned home after giving him a couple of more scathing lectures. After that, Bill took a leisurely stroll and went back to his cottage.\u201cUncle!\u201d Leyla welcomed him with a friendly wave.The child came down the tree as quickly as she had climbed it and hurriedly approached Bill. Leyla was dressed in a ragged, dull gray one-piece dress with short sleeves. Since she was going to meet the duke later, her hand-me-down dresses seemed inappropriate, so Bill decided to buy her new clothes.\u201cGet ready and come out.\u201d Bill said impulsively when they arrived in front of the back door cottage.\u201cAh. Uncle?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look so puzzled. We\u2019re going downtown to buy you some clothes.\u201d Bill coughed and uncomfortably rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cDuke Herhardt will be here soon, so welcoming him in your current appearance would be a little weird.\u201d\u201cThe duke? You mean the owner of this estate, right?\u201d\u201cYes. Since it\u2019s his break, he\u2019ll be back.\u201d\u201cBreak? Does the duke attend school?\u201d Leyla tilted her head, frowning. Bill smiled as he stroked the child\u2019s unruly hair.\u201cThe duke is only 18 years old so he has no choice but to attend school.\u201d\u201cWhat?!! 18 years old? The duke?\u201dBill\u2019s guffaw grew louder in reaction to the child\u2019s shocked expression. He brushed the child\u2019s fluffy hair with his rough fingertips. It felt as soft as cotton.***At the Carlsbar station, a train from the capital had arrived on the platform.The waiting servants made their way to the station\u2019s private section. A tall, slender boy descended onto the platform by the time they lined up in a straight line.\u201cHello, Master.\u201dAll the other servants quickly bowed their heads towards the boy, starting with the butler Hessen\u2019s friendly greeting. Matthias replied to their greetings with a light yet silent gesture in a straight and elegant manner. His rosy lips were curved into a smile that was neither too wide nor too stiff.The Herhardt\u2019s servants didn\u2019t start moving until Matthias took a couple of moves. The people in the crowd stood back quickly, allowing the young master to pass through. Matthias walked past the platform at a quick pace, showing no signs of slowing down.\u201cA carriage?\u201d Matthias smirked as he left the station and spotted a carriage waiting for him.\u201cAh\u2026.. Yes, master. Madam doesn\u2019t believe cars are trustworthy.\u201d\u201cI know. For grandmother, cars are nothing more than a hunk of iron that is unbearably vulgar and dangerous.\u201d\u201cMy apologies. Next time\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. \u2018Classic\u2019 things are not bad. Once in a while.\u201dMatthias boarded the carriage in a composed manner. Slow but steady movements flowed from his long arms and legs.As it passed through the busy shopping streets and the square, the carriage consistently picked up speed.Matthias\u2019 luggage was transported in a separate wagon, which trailed behind the carriage engraved with a golden crest off into the distance.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a social gathering meant to discuss insurance issues for the trade ship sailing next month.Matthias sat in the back of the carriage, staring out of the window. His butler, Hessen, briefed him about the pending problems of his family. He responded to Hessen\u2019s words with just quick nods or brief replies.The business was run by the directors, and although Matthias\u2019 mother and grandmother were in charge of the family affairs, it was up to him as the Duke of Herhardt to make the final decision. Matthias had been playing that role since he was a child of twelve.Hessen\u2019s report had ended by the time Matthias arrived on the Platanus road leading to the Herhardt estate.Matthias was seated with his head tilted at an angle, gazing at the familiar scenery. Both sides of the roadway were lined with tall trees that were arched as if they were holding hands. The path was embroidered with an exquisite pattern designed by the shattered sunlight leaping through the fluttering leaves.A white mansion with a blue-coloured rooftop revealed itself after passing through the road into the estate. Outside the front entrance, the mother and grandmother were waiting for their family patriarch. The door to the wagon opened as Matthias straightened the position of his already linear tie.\u201cWelcome home, Matthias.\u201dNorma Catharina von Herhardt, Dowager Duchess of Arvis, smiled brightly when she welcomed her grandson.Matthias bowed his head and accepted a kiss from his grandmother.He was approached with a much more straightforward attitude by Elysee von Herhardt, his mother, who stood behind them.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown taller.\u201d She chuckled as she embraced him warmly. Her dark black hair gleamed in the early summer light, much like her son\u2019s.Matthias responded to his mother with the same smile. He shared similar greetings with the other servants in line. His polished manner and proper courtesy towards the servants showed that he was the perfect owner of this family,\u2014He was Duke Herhardt.Matthias took the lead and crossed the lobby area, standing between his two beloved women. He suddenly lifted his head and stared up at the huge chandelier that was lit up in the middle of the day before climbing the stairs.Matthias looked at the Herhardt family\u2019s crest that was imprinted on the ceiling just below the chandelier.He was a Herhardt.Herhardt, a euphemism for intellect, grace, and unflappable character. Matthias had never had any complaints or concerns regarding his own life. He was well aware of the kind of life he would have to live and accepted it. Handling his own life was as easy as breathing for him.Matthias ascended the stairwell with long strides with his eyes fixed on the ground. The servants were finally able to breathe properly after the owner of the household entered the mansion safely.The residents of Arvis had been preparing for days to meet Duke Herhardt in person. On his arrival, everything and everyone, including the people who lived in his estate, had to be flawless. The servants needed to present themselves in the best light possible.Leyla Lewellin, the Arvis\u2019 uninvited guest, wasn\u2019t any different.***\u201cDid the duke already arrive?\u201dStanding at the edge of the group of servants, Leyla murmured something in a disappointed tone. The creamy-white colour dress Bill had purchased for her flapped in sync with her movements.\u201cYou\u2019ll see Duke Herhardt in the woods. But I have to ask for permission first.\u201d Bill Remmer spoke bluntly and began walking towards the woods. Leyla followed him at the back with zeal.\u201cDoes the duke enjoy the woods as much as I do?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah sure. Hunting is one of his favorite activities.\u201d\u201cHunting? In the woods?\u201d Leyla\u2019s pupils dilated, and her eyes widened. As he looked down at the child, Bill snorted.\u201cIsn\u2019t it natural for the forest to be the hunting ground for this family?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 does he hunt birds too?\u201d\u201cUpland hunting is the Duke\u2019s favorite pastime.\u201dHis irrelevant comment caused Leyla to halt in her stride. Bill coughed reflexively after realizing what he had said. He tried lying to her to convince her, but Duke Herhardt was due to arrive on the hunting grounds in a few days. He was concerned that if he tried to comfort the child with his white lies, he would cause Leyla even more distress.\u201cWhen you see the Duke\u2019s shooting skills, you\u2019ll be astonished. He\u2019s only a teenager, but he\u2019s a fantastic sharpshooter.\u201d Bill started to babble because he felt compelled to say something to comfort the young girl. But Leyla, on the other hand, was on the verge of crying.\u201cWhy does he like killing birds? There\u2019s lots of food in the mansion\u2026\u201d\u201cHunting is merely a means of recreation for the nobles. The most entertaining targets to shoot are birds, and\u2026\u201d Bill turned around to face Leyla after realizing what he had said, and Leyla\u2019s upset expression came into his gaze.\u2018Why do you like birds so much?!\u2019Bill was on the verge of yelling something at the top of his lungs. He didn\u2019t understand why he was bothering to explain something to her while still having to be sensitive to the child\u2019s feelings. Bill eventually chose to remain silent because Leyla seemed to be about to cry if he said even one more word.The sobbing Leyla.He hated seeing children crying.Bill continued to walk again after a brief pause. Leyla\u2019s shoulders were limp as she followed in his footsteps. The same child who had been excited to wear her new ivory-coloured dress was gone. It had been quite a sight to see her feeling so agitated about the dress she just received.\u201cI\u2019m hoping the duke shows a dislike for hunting.\u201dAfter a long period of silence, she spoke up cautiously.\u201cOr maybe he\u2019ll get tired of hunting?\u201d Leyla looked up at Bill, her eyes sparkling with hope. But Bill could only scratch the back of his neck sheepishly as a response.Leyla was optimistic that her prayers would be fulfilled.***Matthias was nowhere to be found near the hunting grounds a week after his return. He was busy tending to the guests who had flocked to the mansion to see him, so it was understandable.The mansion was filled with clamorous parties every day, but the woods were deafeningly quiet. As the summer had come to an end, the eggs hatched, and the wild roses, which had been in the early stages of flowering, were now wholly bloomed. Leyla was enthralled by the minor changes taking place in the woods.\u201cLeyla, don\u2019t go too far!\u201d Bill raised his voice when Leyla excitedly left the cottage.\u201cAlright! I\u2019m just going for a stroll along the river! Uncle, I\u2019ll see you later!\u201dAs she turned around, Leyla swung her arms frantically above her head. Her old leather bag, which she slung over her shoulder, shook along with her as she jumped.Leyla was the first person to discover the newly hatched birds on a tree branch. The hairless baby birds were eagerly awaiting their mother\u2019s arrival with their food. She scampered down from the tree and drew the picture of the baby birds on a scrap of paper which she pulled from her leather bag. Although her sketches were a little messy, she tried her hardest to portray the tiny birds in her drawings.In her little diary, Leyla drew and wrote about everything she had seen in the woods. The land was more majestic than any other location she had ever seen. Leyla decided to jot down everything she saw. This was because she wanted to look back on her memories from the woods in her diary, after her departure from this mansion. She was saddened by the thought of leaving the place one day.Leyla kept a steady record of the forest as she walked along the path leading to the river. She strewed pastel-coloured flower petals between the pages of her notebook and picked some strawberries along the way.The sun was just starting to settle when she arrived at the glistening riverbank. Leyla climbed to the peak of a giant tree that stood at the forest\u2019s edge, overlooking the river. Her favourite spot was a thick, long branch of the tree because it was as comfortable as a chair.A faint clink of horseshoes could be heard from afar when Leyla was about to open her notebook. She stuffed her journal into her pocket as quickly as she could. In the meantime, the horse\u2019s galloping sound became louder. Leyla held her breath while hugging the tree branch she was lying down on, terrified of the approaching intruder.A horse with smooth dark hazel fur appeared not long after that. On its back, there was a man. He chose to rest his horse right under the tree, where Leyla was lying among all the places in the woods. From the moment that man had stepped off the horse, his movements had been smooth and light.She thought it best to climb down, but the mysterious man was already leaning against the tree.Leyla couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say, so she just looked at the man who was lifting his hand to remove his hat. But at that moment, Leyla\u2019s leather bag fell off her shoulders and slammed into the branch. For the next few seconds, her memory became hazy. The man reflectively turned his head towards the tree branch and met eyes with Leyla.Leyla locked her gaze with his. His blue eyes were like clear glass beads, visible through the thick black hair that flowed over his forehead. By the time she tried to gather herself together, the man was already pointing his gun at her face.The thought of being shot by the long, menacing gun made Leyla\u2019s face turn pale. She remained motionless, hugging the tree as though it were her only friend. Her entire body was trembling with sweat.Slowly, the man lowered his pistol and let out a silent sigh.\u201cWho are you\u2026..?\u201dHis twisted lips emitted a low, resonant voice.\u201c\u2026..Leyla.\u201dAs her golden hair fluttered in the wind, Leyla managed to keep her voice from breaking, even though she was on the verge of tears.\u201cWhat?\u201d His pupils dilated even further, and Leyla hugged the tree so tightly that it hurt her fingertips.\u201cLeyla. I\u2019m Leyla Lewellin.\u201d***\u201cUncle! Uncle Bill!\u201dThe sound of Leyla\u2019s cry echoed through the woods.Bill sat in front of his cottage warehouse, watching the sun setting down. At Leyla\u2019s frantic call, he turned his head in bewilderment and looked at Leyla, who ran towards him with a crimson red face.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cTh-there\u2019s a man in the woods! He was very tall!\u201d Despite her abdominal pain, Leyla was excited to narrate her encounter with the mysterious man.\u201cYou must\u2019ve met the duke who came out for hunting.\u201dBill replied while picking up the tools from the warehouse.\u201cHis hair was jet black, and his eyes were a deep shade of blue. His voice sounded as light as a feather.\u201dBill smirked with a snarl, \u201cWithout a doubt, it\u2019s Duke Herhardt.\u201dLeyla stood in front of Bill, trying to catch her breath.For a while, the stunning yet scary man in the distance had stared at Leyla and then turned away without saying anything. When he mounted his horse again, two more men appeared in the dense forest. The man turned his horse and followed the other two men further into the woods. When they were no longer visible, Leyla climbed down from the trees and fled to the cottage.\u201cThen the Duke\u2026..\u201dBang!Just as Leyla was about to say something, a cold shot suddenly rang out, shaking the stillness of the forest.Startled, Leyla turned her head towards the source of the noise. She soon witnessed surprised birds arising from the far side of the woods. One of the birds fell from the trees, with its wings drooped helplessly. The shots went on for a couple more rounds. So Bill patted Leyla on her shoulder to comfort the frightened child.\u201cLeyla.\u201dLeyla lifted her head with a long, deliberate motion. Bill unknowingly held his breath once their eyes met.The little one was sobbing.***The beautiful bird slayer.Leyla Lewellin decided to give him that title.Everyone in the estate, including Bill Remmer, praised him for being the epitome of royalty. Matthias von Herhardt, who had exceptional qualities as the owner of this duchy, seemed to be loved and cared for by the people.But not Leyla.The mother bird had been missing since the day the Duke went out hunting. The newly hatched baby birds were separated from their mother, who fed them with food. Moreover, countless birds were no longer to be seen in the woods.Why did the duke only hunt the tiny, beautiful birds instead of big, edible ones?Leyla, who had been watching and agonizing over this for the past month, seemed to have figured out why.For Duke Herhardt, the birds had become his moving target.The smaller they were, the more challenging and fascinating it was to shoot them. The Duke didn\u2019t even try to glance at the prey he had just killed.On the days he went out hunting, after hitting his target, he would simply turn away, and Leyla would always bury the dead birds that were soaked in blood.Bang-Another round of gunfire could be heard in the distance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leyla sat down bundled in a blanket with her arms wrapped around her knees. Meanwhile, Bill and the other gardeners were busy digging up the wilting rose tree.The roses in the garden behind the mansion seemed to be of varying kinds. The rose was said to be the Berg Empire\u2019s national flower, as well as a favorite of the Duke\u2019s mother and grandmother.The little Leyla wandered around the cottage nervously after hearing another sound of a gunshot from the woods.\u00a0 Uncle Bill had noticed her nervousness and wanted to take her to the garden with him. Only when the sound of gunfire faded away did her mind finally calm down.\u2018Is it really okay for me to take a nap as Uncle Bill toils away in the hot sun?\u2019Bill drew an uneasy stare from Leyla. She let out a slight sigh as she slowly closed her eyes. But Bill had threatened her that he\u2019d become angry if she helped him. He also told her that he despised children who refused to listen. So, she opted to wait for him until he finished his work, even though Leyla\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t at ease.When she opened her eyes again with reluctance, Leyla was suddenly startled by an unfamiliar figure. In front of her stood a well-dressed teenage boy who seemed to be about Leyla\u2019s age.\u201cHello.\u201dAs their gazes met, the good-looking boy with platinum blonde hair greeted her with a lovely smile.\u201cDo you live here?\u201dThe fellow boy surveyed his surroundings and asked humbly.\u201cYes. I live with uncle Bill.\u201dLeyla replied with her eyes squinted.\u201cMr. Bill? Do you mean the scary gardener guy?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not scary.\u201d\u201cReally? He seems like a scary person to me.\u201dThe boy sat down next to Leyla with a tilted head.\u201cAnd you? Do you live here too?\u201dThe boy chuckled and shook his head when Leyla asked him cautiously.\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0He said.\u00a0\u201cI just followed my father. He\u2019s the family doctor at the Herhardt household. He\u2019s come to see Madam Norma for a medical checkup. I sometimes come here with my father. Madam Norma said she was okay.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cTwelve.\u201d\u201cSame. But you\u2019re kinda tiny.\u201dThe boy who was looking at Leyla started laughing and Leyla\u2019s cheeks began to blush bright red with anger.\u201cYou\u2019re tiny too.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m the tallest student in my class.\u201dTo show his tall stature, the boy stretched out his body. Certainly, he seemed to be a couple of inches taller than his actual age.\u201cHowever\u2026 You\u2019re still not as tall as uncle Bill.\u201dLeyla muttered to herself, causing the boy to giggle once more. He seemed to be a cheerful kid.\u201cHey, finding a child or even an adult taller than Mr. Bill is impossible.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201dFor no apparent reason, Leyla plucked at the grass growing near her blanket and her tiny fingers became soiled with a bluish-green color. She wished the boy would get up and leave immediately, but he showed no signs of doing so.Leyla then shifted her attention to the peach poised on the blanket\u2019s edge and asked the boy at the spur of the moment.\u201cDo you want some?\u201dAs the boy smiled and nodded happily, Leyla dug into her leather pocket and took out a small knife. The sight of Leyla carefully cutting the peach made the boy chuckle.\u201cYou\u2019re funny. Why is a knife coming out of a girl\u2019s bag?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me. Uncle Bill gave it to me.\u201dAs she handed the half-cut peach to the boy, Leyla drooped her nose slightly in annoyance. But the two children\u2019s noses were tingling with the delicious smell of the peach fruit.\u201cHow come you have such a sad look on your face? Has something happened?\u201dAfter gulping down his peach, the boy asked her gently.\u201cThe Duke and his friends keep hunting down the birds in the woods.\u201dLeyla answered solemnly. The young boy cocked his head, perplexed by her words..\u201cSo, what\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\u201cThey are killing birds for their own pleasure.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t hunting like that?\u201d\u201cDo you think so too?\u201dLeyla stared at the boy with her grim green pupils. In her eyes, the boy seemed to have difficulty holding the big, long hunting rifle.\u201cUh\u2026.. No.\u201dThe boy quickly shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t. It\u2019s cruel.\u201dHearing his positive reply, Leyla\u2019s face started to light up with a smile.\u201cDo you want another peach?\u201dLeyla asked with a more bright tone. The boy then smiled and nodded. Leyla halved another peach and gave the larger half to him. The boy\u2019s cheeks appeared to blush as he tried to fix his tight collar.\u201cKyle! Kyle!\u201dThe sound of a faint voice could be heard. The boy, who had been fiddling with a peach seed, hurriedly leapt to his feet.\u201cI have to go now.\u201d\u201cOkay. Bye then.\u201d\u201cKyle Etman.\u201dHe raised his hands.\u201cIt\u2019s my name. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cLeyla. I\u2019m Leyla Lewellin.\u201dLeyla gave him a clumsy handshake. The two shook hands with their tiny hands soaked in sticky peach honey, as if they were making a truce.\u201cBye, Leyla. See ya. Next time, I\u2019ll get you something more tasty!\u201dThe boy shouted aloud as he ran away into the distance. Leyla just gave a slight wave because she wasn\u2019t sure whether she\u2019d see him again if she moved out of the estate.***Leyla\u2019s world was once again at peace after Kyle had left. She sat patiently waiting for Uncle Bill to finish his job while smelling the rose-scented fragrance. However, she had dozed off at some point and only woke up when Uncle Bill called her name at sunset.Leyla jumped out of her seat, packed her bag, and picked up the blanket from the ground.\u201cUncle Bill. I saw a kid\u2026.\u201dLeyla was about to tell the story of her meeting with the boy with whom she had shared her peaches. However, at that moment, she was interrupted by silhouettes of people coming out of the forest on the other side, who turned out to be Duke Herhardt and his friends.Matthias came to a halt in the middle of the rose garden. Bill Remmer, the brusque gardener who was nearby, bowed his head towards his master. Matthias didn\u2019t take long to notice that the gardener was hiding a small child behind him.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen each other, Mr. Remmer.\u201dMatthias gave a slight nod. His friends who had accompanied him in the hunting expedition ground came to a standstill behind the duke and maintained their distance.\u201cAh, for the time being, she\u2019ll be staying here at Arvis.\u201dBill Remmer told the Duke with a somewhat uneasy look on his face. Leyla took a hesitant step towards the Duke after Bill tapped her on the back and ordered her to come forward.Matthias was able to recognize her because of her glimmering blond hair. It was the little girl he had almost shot. The weird little girl who was almost killed because she had been mistaken for a bird.\u201cI already have Madam Norma and Madam Elysse\u2019s permission, but I think I should also ask for your approval.\u201dBill Remmer bowed his head once more, and Leyla, who stood beside him, followed suit.Matthias took a long, good look at the girl. The child scowled at him when they exchanged glances. Lips clenched combined with sneered green eyes. Her expression was the same as when they had first met in the woods.\u201cAh, you\u2019re that girl, right?\u201d\u00a0He asked,\u00a0\u201cThe little girl who lives in the woods.\u201dLelya\u2019s face blushed with embarrassment and she hid behind her uncle\u2019s back. Riette, Matthias\u2019 cousin, guffawed from behind, recalling the girl they occasionally met in the forest was always like that.That girl would always hide behind a tree as soon as she gazed at the duke\u2019s eyes in wonder. She would always come out of nowhere and bury the dead birds after Matthias would finish hunting.\u201cSure. If that\u2019s what you want, Mr. Remmer.\u201dWith a grin on his face, Matthias gave a quick answer since it was none of his business what the gardener raised in the woods.\u201cThank you, my Lord.\u201dBill expressed his gratitude to him. Matthias started walking again after giving Bill a small nod with his chin.After the Duke passed them, Leyla flinched when she saw Matthias\u2019 servants following him with their hands full of hunted animals. Her shoulders hunched and she drew her eyes close at the moment when her tiny nose was filled with a strong, distasteful smell of blood.Standing beside her, uncle Bill only could pat Leyla\u2019s frail shoulders with his big-warm hands.***With her chin resting on the palm of her hand, Claudine let out a long, deep sigh. Her curly brown hair danced along in sync with her endless sighs.\u201cClaudine, behave like a lady please.\u201dRaising her thin eyebrows, Countess Brandt cast a look at her daughter. Her inarticulate voice became increasingly impatient.Claudine was about to become the Duchess of Arvis, despite the fact that she was much too young to be called a lady. Countess Brandt could only let out a heavy sigh, looking at her daughter\u2019s childish attitude.\u201cBut I\u2019m so lonely and bored.\u201dClaudine muttered something under her breath. The other noblewomen at the tea table who were drinking tea turned their focus to the depressed brown-haired girl.\u201cThen go play with your cousins.\u201dCountess Brandt wheezed with her face reddened. Claudine, on the other hand, paid no attention to her angry mother.\u201cThey treat me as if I\u2019m not here. They say things I don\u2019t understand.\u201dClaudine\u2019s annoyed expression elicited a soft smile from other ladies.\u201cWell, it can be boring. Claudine doesn\u2019t have any friends her age.\u201dElysse von Herhardt nodded her head while stroking the white dog on her lap.\u201cSee? Madam Herhardt is the only one who understands me.\u201dA bright smile rose on Claudine\u2019s lips, when she met someone who understood her distress.\u201cAnyways, who\u2019s that child?\u201dClaudine abruptly pointed her finger towards the garden after catching a quick glimpse of a young girl. Claudine gestured to the ladies to turn their heads in the direction she was pointing.To a young girl who was taking a stroll with a gardener.\u201cDo you mind if I play with her? I think she\u2019s about the same age as me.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Isn\u2019t she an orphan from another country? A girl like that isn\u2019t suited to be friends with you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine\u2014-\u201d\u00a0Claudine said,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019ll be more fun playing with her rather than a puppy.\u201dShe spoke with a calm and confident tone. Her mother\u2019s red face, which was about to burst with embarrassment, went unnoticed by her.Elysse von Herhardt smiled and rang the doorbell cheerfully.\u201cBring that child here.\u201dA maid came to the room at the call of her master\u2019s bell.\u201cThe child who\u2019s being raised by our gardener.\u201d***Leyla was taken to an unknown world by the maid. To the place where glamorous people sat under the shade of the white mansion, dressed in bright-colored clothing.\u201cOh, she\u2019s so cute.\u201dLeyla earned a compliment from one of the ladies.\u201cCan you tell me what you think? Claudine, do you like her?\u201dAfter questioning Leyla, the black-haired woman turned over to the chestnut-haired girl sitting beside her. Claudine smiled and nodded happily.\u201cThank you, Madam Herhardt.\u201dLeyla looked at the people in front of her with a blank stare on her face. She couldn\u2019t figure out what the ladies were talking about. She just wanted to return to Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage, but no one seemed to understand her dilemma.The maid took Leyla\u2019s hand and walked her into a room after one of the ladies murmured an order.For the first time in her life, Leyla was washed in a luxurious bathroom, and to her surprise, she was clothed in soft, white dresses. Leyla sensed the pain as the maid combed her frizzy hair roughly. But she endured it, because she was afraid she would hinder Uncle Bill\u2019s job if she said anything wrong.\u201cLady Claudine is Count Brandt\u2019s daughter. So don\u2019t act rashly in front of her. Do you understand?\u201dLeyla gave a befuddled nod when she was sternly alerted by the maid who dragged her up to the second floor of the mansion. After that, the parlor\u2019s door was carefully opened by the maid. There, Claudine welcomed them with a refined manner.\u201cHello. What\u2019s your name? And your Age?\u201dClaudine lowered her head and tried to look Leyla in the eyes.\u201cMy name is Leyla Lewellin. I\u2019m twelve years old.\u201d\u201cReally? Because you\u2019re so tiny, I thought you were younger.\u201dAlthough Leyla disliked being called \u2018tiny\u2019, she decided to keep her annoyance to herself.\u2018For uncle Bill.\u2019She was able to calm down as she chanted those words over and over again, almost as if they were a ritual.Flower arrangement, Piano, and Music.Claudine suggested this and that, but Leyla couldn\u2019t do anything.Dice game. Word game. Chess.Claudine\u2019s other ideas for alternative games were the same.Claudine\u2019s mouth curved into a vague smile as she alternated between looking at the toy table and at Leyla.\u201cPoor you.\u201dShe slowly rose from her chair with a disappointed sigh in her voice.\u201cYou don\u2019t know a thing.\u201dLeyla felt helpless as she looked at the jumbled up toys on the table. Claudine murmured in frustration as she walked over to Leyla\u2019s chair. But Leyla was humiliated even more by her gentle voice, which seemed to be trying hard to not convey even the slightest hint of disappointment or irritation.Leyla felt compelled to say something, but she couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s because her mouth was shut tight. It was difficult to say something polite in this situation. But fortunately, Claudine turned away without waiting for Leyla to say anything.\u201cGeez\u2026 She\u2019s no better than a dog.\u201dShe whispered a sigh to herself before closing the door.Leyla was left alone in the beautiful parlor after Claudine had left. She was tempted to leave as soon as possible as well, but Leyla decided to wait because she thought Claudine would come back.But Claudine didn\u2019t return until the afternoon sun began turning into a golden hue. The maid who had brought Leyla only showed up later in the evening.\u201cYou may go back.\u201dShe spoke in a softer tone than before.\u201cThe lady said you can keep the dress. And this as well.\u201dLeyla froze in place when the maid gave a glittering gold coin to her. So the maid shoved the coin into Leyla\u2019s hands.\u201cJust take it. You should be thankful for what your master gives you. Do you understand?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2727After a Long Time\u2727Leyla stepped out of the mansion just as the sky began turning a rose-tinted colour and was welcomed by a soothing wind as she exited the rose garden entrance.Leyla walked confidently, clutching a gold coin in her right hand. Her bold steps, however, didn\u2019t last too long when she saw Claudine sitting under the pergola near the full-bloom flower roses.\u00a0 The brunette-haired girl was having a fun conversation with her cousins, and she gave a vague smile when her gaze fell on Leyla\u2019s.\u201cGoodbye, Leyla.\u201dClaudine was the one who greeted her first. The young men sitting next to Claudine all looked at Leyla with their gazes drawn to her. But thankfully, Duke Herhardt wasn\u2019t among them. So Leyla quickly replied with a single bow to her farewell, but Claudine remained silent.After she was out of their sight, Leyla began to run. She couldn\u2019t wait to escape from the weird and unknown world and get back to Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage as soon as she could. But it seemed her worst misfortune came at the very last moment.Leyla tripped at the crosswalk of the garden and the forest path. Her gold coin mockingly rolled down the paving stone and landed on the tip of a man\u2019s shoe. She frowned at the spinning gold coin, and the man lightly stepped on the coin with the tip of his shoe to quell its tinkling sounds.Leyla moved her eyes slowly to the well-polished shoes, up to the long legs, and finally to the man\u2019s face that loomed upon her.It was Duke Herhardt.Leyla startled and immediately sprang to her feet. Her white dress had blood and dust stains from her scratched knee. With a composed expression on his face, the Duke clearly stared at Leyla with his red lips, which seemed to be slightly curved to one side.Leyla pressed her lips together and brushed the dust from her clothes. Meanwhile, Duke Herhardt took a leisurely step back, then the coin under his foot shone brightly, reflecting the sunshine.Leyla hunkered down her body in front of the Duke, even though she wanted to leave the place right away.\u00a0 Just as she was about to stretch out her arms to take the coin, She remembered what she had been told by Claudine.\u2018No better than a dog.\u2019Those words had scratched a deep wound in Leyla\u2019s heart. She took the coin and politely bowed to Duke Herhardt.Leyla didn\u2019t dare to lift her head. So all she could do was stoop her head as low as she could and hold her breath. As she bowed, surprisingly, the pain she felt when she fell was no longer there.Leyla left the Duke and continued her run. Because of her injured knee, she couldn\u2019t run as fast as she could before. At the same time, she kept pushing her bloodied legs; she felt something sprouting from the bottom of her heart to the tip of her throat.Leyla realized what it was after passing through the forest path and facing the light from the cottage.It was sadness.***\u201cI\u2019ll give this for you, uncle.\u201dBill\u2019s hairy brows grew to wrinkle when Leyla put out the gold coin to Bill in a hushed way, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cA gold coin.\u201d\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d\u201cLady Claudine gave it to me.\u201d\u201cClaudine? Ah, that little noble lady.\u201d Bill showed her a friendly nod as if he recognized her.Leyla had been feeling down for the next two days, ever since she was invited to the mansion. She didn\u2019t talk to anyone or go for a walk in the woods or the garden. Bill realized he missed the good old days, especially that child\u2019s upbeat attitude. Since the child was silent, the world became quiet. And he wasn\u2019t a fan of the quiet world.\u201cCan you tell me why you want to give me that money?\u201dLeyla sat in a straight pose, facing her dear uncle, while Bill leaned a little towards the table. \u201cBecause I think it\u2019s worth a lot.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s worth a lot?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Even though receiving this coin made me sad at first, I couldn\u2019t possibly throw it away because of its high value. So I thought that if I gave you this coin, I might at least start repaying you after being indebted to you for so long.\u201d\u201cDamn it.\u201dLeyla flinched mildly at Bill\u2019s harsh mutter, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind his curse.Bill had been concerned about the nobles hurting Leyla\u2019s tender heart ever since she arrived in Arvis. Since all the aristocrats were the same to Bill, he had expected that they would bully the child because of her low status.The majority of them were arrogant, rude, and insulting.Bill was afraid of making the child shed tears if he asked what had happened at the mansion, but he had a good idea of how badly the child was treated there.\u201cLeyla.\u201dWhen he called her name, Leyla gave a childish grinning, despite her best efforts to act mature for her age.\u201cSince you earned the money, take it.\u201d\u201cThe money I earned?\u201d\u201cYep, it\u2019s the money you made while working. It\u2019s a pain in the neck to deal with a bored aristocrat, but you pulled it off. So you can confidently claim your prize.\u201dLeyla\u2019s brows furrowed in bewilderment. Bill gulped down the thick glass of beer in front of him while gazing at the pondering child. \u201cReally?\u201d Leyla tapped on the gold coin with her head tilted.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Bill cleaned the beer from his beard with the back of his sleeve.\u2018The money I earned.\u2019Leyla\u2019s expression became noticeably brighter. Bill cut up a large piece of meat and set it on her plate, \u201cWelcome to the adult world, Leyla.\u201d\u201cAdult? Me?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re considered an adult if you can make money on your own. That\u2019s exactly what you did.\u201d\u201cBut I just made one gold coin\u2026.\u201d\u201cIn this world, there are plenty of adults who can\u2019t even make a buck. So far, you\u2019ve had a good start. You\u2019re going to be a pretty good adult because you\u2019re off to such a good start.\u201dHe started piling bread and baked vegetables onto Leyla\u2019s plate. A large amount of food caused Leyla\u2019s eyes to widen. \u201cUncle, it\u2019s too much.\u201d\u201cEat a lot, because you\u2019ve been chewing at your food like a bird for days.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou know right? I like kids who eat like a cow.\u201dLeyla erupted in laughter. \u201cUncle, if I eat well, I\u2019ll grow a lot right?\u201d\u201cI suppose so. Why? Did anyone make fun of you because you\u2019re too short?\u201d\u201cNot really, but I think I look too young. So it upsets me.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s because you are still a child.\u2019\u00a0But Bill refrained from saying what everybody already knew.Leyla enjoyed chopping up her meat with ease. Bill thought she had grown a lot in the last few months. Her body no longer resembled an iron skewer, and she had a lovely face.Her natural frame was small and slim, similar to that of a bird. So it seemed that she would not be able to mature and grow a large physique. There was no doubt in his mind that Leyla would blossom into a beautiful lady.Bill was taken aback when he found himself complimenting Leyla\u2019s beauty and shook his head to gather himself. For impoverished women, beauty was poison and would bound them to run into trouble.That\u2019s why Bill was adamant about sending the girl somewhere he could trust. He didn\u2019t trust the orphanage because he believed it was the perfect place for ruining a child\u2019s life.\u2018The world is a terrible place. Humans are wretched.\u2019Bill drank the remaining portion of his beer while cursing the people who had abandoned the child in his care.It was hard to explain why the life of Bill Remmer was loaded with such anxiety. He yearned for the days when his life was filled with nothing but flowers and trees.\u201cUncle. If I earn money, I\u2019m free to spend it, right?\u201d Leyla wondered as she chewed her food properly.\u201cOf course. Do you have something you want?\u201d\u201cI ran out of pages in my notebook. I want to buy a new one.\u201d\u201cOf course, go ahead.\u201d\u201cCan I buy colored pencils as well?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cUncle, is there anything you need?\u201d\u201cWhy? Do you want to buy something for me as well?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat if I asked you to buy something outrageously expensive for me?\u201dThe expression on Leyla\u2019s face had changed to one of solemnity. When the girl became more serious, her eyes darkened and widened, giving her a cuter look.Bill cracked up, laughing as he poured Leyla\u2019s glass with apple juice.Leyla took the glass in her hand and gestured to Bill to clink his glass against hers. Bill happily slammed his glass toward the one that the child had reached out for. But he began to be worried that the child would imitate his drinking habits after he saw Leyla drink all of her juice in one go.Bill shook his head in disbelief at the thought of Leyla being a guzzler.\u00a0 \u2018\u00a0 I\u2019m only allowing her just for today.\u2019 He assured himself.***The long days had passed, and it had been during those long days that Bill mused the reasons why he couldn\u2019t raise Leyla and where he could send Leyla, the lovely but troublesome young girl who came out of nowhere in his life.Leyla grew a lot during those days of Bill\u2019s relentless wondering. The new clothes he had bought for Layla were getting shorter, and her smooth white calves were starting to show.The warehouse-like room that Leyla was supposed to use as a temporary residence became a lady\u2019s room at one point. The troublesome child who used to hop around the woods trail grew into a finely matured lady who now crossed the same track with gentle steps as if gliding on water.Bill was seated\u00a0on a chair underneath the porch with a puzzled look on his face when a young lady with a willow basket full of raspberries was waving at him. \u201cUncle! You\u2019re back early today.\u201dLeyla lightly ran towards him as if she were dancing. Her pretty blonde hair, which was braided into a single hairdo, swayed under the wide brim of the straw hat.\u00a0 Her two red cheeks were as fresh as the roses Bill had recently planted.\u201cYou must have gone to the woods again.\u201d\u201cYes. Look, it\u2019s a great harvest, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Leyla proudly held up her willow basket. \u201cI\u2019m going to pick some more tomorrow. I\u2019m planning to make a lot of raspberry jam.\u201d\u201cAre you planning on starting a business or something?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201dLeyla sat beside him in a chair with a bright smile on her face. Bill came to realize that there were two chairs on the porch. It wasn\u2019t just the two chairs. Even though Bill still hadn\u2019t made up his mind on what to do with Leyla, all of the furniture in the cottage was arranged for the two of them before he knew it.Leyla dropped the basket on the floor and started digging through it until she found a wild peach that she picked in the woods.\u00a0 Bill took the peach she was giving out to him, then he cut\u00a0it in half\u00a0and handed the half-sliced peach to Leyla.While eating their peaches, the two sat next to each other and watched the forest. The birds chirping from afar sounded as clear as Leyla\u2019s voice, and the noise of leaves blowing through the clear blue sky charmed their ears.\u201cIt\u2019s summertime again.\u201dBill muttered unknowingly. Leyla\u2019s face lit up with a silent smile. She removed her hat, and daintily raised her arms.Bill cracked up laughing when he discovered the old leather bag that ran below Leyla\u2019s knee, recognizing that it was the first item he gave her the year she arrived.\u201cAre you going to carry on with this old thing until it\u2019s worn out?\u201d\u201cI like it because it is comfortable to wear. It\u2019s still useful. \u201cHer bag shook with care as Leyla lifted it. Bill was able to pinpoint the source of the rattling noise. Tin pencil case. Pocket knife. Old notes. Some beautiful feathers and flower petals. She didn\u2019t change much in certain aspects.It was an ordinary evening when Bill was splitting firewood, and Leyla was sorting and organizing the dry laundry.She didn\u2019t forget to feed the chicken and the goat while she was adeptly preparing their dinner. The sun had already set by the time they faced each other across the table from opposite sides.\u201cKyle will be here the next day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have dinner and study together. Are you fine with that?\u201d Leyla asked while placing her delectable-smelling plate on the table.\u201cWhy does that rascal keep coming to my house to eat when he has a rich father who provides him with enough food?\u201d\u201cI know you like him, even though you speak of him in that way.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately.\u201dLeyla casually chuckled as Bill expressed his dissatisfaction, then she put the half-filled beer glass in front of him.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Why don\u2019t you fill it to the brim?\u201d\u201cFor your health\u2019s sake, you should drink less.\u201d\u201cDid Etmon, the glutton, tell you that?\u201d\u201cUncle!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a jackass.\u201d Bill grumbled under his breath. But he didn\u2019t go against Leyla\u2019s words.***At the end of a lovely meal, the night grew deeper. After cleaning dishes, Leyla returned to her room and took a warm shower. She was sleepy, but she chose to sit at her desk and switch on the lamp. An exam loomed in the coming days and her summer vacation joy hinged on the result of that exam.The sound of her pencil making marks on the paper was mixed in along with the sound of nighttime birds chirping, which was carried down from the night breeze.Leyla, who had been focusing on her studies for quite some time, finally let go of her pencil, unable to handle the eye pressure and faint headache that came over. She had to squint her eyes to see clearly ever since she was a kid. And now, her eyesight, which had never been very good, to begin with, seemed to have worsened.Leyla switched off the light and lay down on her bed.Twenty bottles of raspberry jam. No, should it be thirty bottles?Anyways, a bit more, she was almost on her goal of buying a pair of glasses.And though her problem should have gotten settled by telling Uncle Bill, she was afraid of burdening him. He was already giving her too many things, and she wasn\u2019t willing to repay him back with just money.The majority of people laughed at Bill when he said he\u2019d send Leyla to school. They told him there was no point in schooling an orphan child and sneered that when she got older, a kid like her would wind up being the maid of the Herhardt family.Bill, on the other hand, was adamant in his decision. Every day, he spoke with Leyla, telling her that she would be a pretty smart woman.After Leyla closed her eyes, her headache subsided a little. She desperately needed to sleep, but the more she attempted, the busier her mind became. Strange thoughts began to fill her hollow head on a night like this, as she often had.The return of the birds in the woods.Her summer\u2019s plans.The mastermind behind the series of a famous mystery novel published in the daily newspaper.And Duke Herhardt.Leyla slowly opened her eyes as soon as the name came to mind. Beyond the familiar darkness, she could see the scenery out of the window.Fluttering branches, the moon and stars, and the night sky sparkling above those trees.Leyla caught her breath silently as she blinked at the dim white light from afar.After\u00a0completing the Royal Military School, the Duke, who had graduated from college, was commissioned as an army officer in keeping with family tradition. He hadn\u2019t visited the estate in many years due to his assignment to the frontier overseas. So it had been a peaceful time for both Leyla and the birds in the forest.But, he was scheduled to return this summer.Master of Arvis, Duke Herhardt.That marked the end of 12-year-old Leyla.The Duke was back, and Leyla was an adult.And the real story would begin now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could see a young lady dragging her bicycle from afar.The lady\u2019s elegant and gentlemanly walk helped him to recognize her.But it wasn\u2019t just her walking style that made him notice the girl; it was also her face, which was always full of rich expressions and her gentle and delicate body gestures.Kyle cherished her whole existence dearly.After their encounter in the summer, under the shade of the willow tree-he had realized that there was no other girl just like her.\u201cLeyla!\u201dWhen she heard someone call her name loudly, Leyla stalled her steps and squinted her eyes in the direction of the boy approaching her.Kyle relished those moments.The moment her steps became faster after she discovered who he was.The moment she came up to him and smiled at him sweetly.\u201cWhy did you come here again? It would\u2019ve been more convenient for you to meet me at the cottage.\u201d\u201cWell, I had plenty of time anyway.\u201dThat was a lie, to speak the truth. He had left his tennis club mates behind to return home from school with her.~Tomorrow\u2019s problems must be resolved tomorrow. It will all be resolved.~So\u00a0Kyle was not worried at all. Even if his seniors might be waiting for him the next day with a racket in their hands.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*On a busy street, Kyle and Leyla walked side by side.\u00a0They bought some ice cream when they arrived at the shopping area, then stopped in front of a dusty bookstore.Leyla was always laughing. Kyle Etman believed that, aside from Uncle Bill, he was the only one in this world who knew how often Leyla laughed and how radiant her smile was.The wind became colder as they entered the Arvis territory road.After their conversation turned to the latest school exam, Leyla\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u00a0 When the topic of geometry was mentioned, her eyes swiftly glowed with a hint of despair.Kyle paid close attention to the subtle changes in her facial gestures.Not yet.He swallowed the heart-fluttering words that were about to escape his lips. Kyle didn\u2019t want his flippant confession to make their friendship become awkward.He then wondered, whether it was necessary to ask her out when he was already planning to marry her.\u2018Leyla Etman. That sounds nice.\u2019\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d\u00a0Leyla asked him as she frowned.She was grumbling about her low geometry grades until she looked dazedly at Kyle giggling by himself.\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026 Oh! I heard Duke Herhardt is coming back?\u201d Kyle abruptly changed the conversation\u2019s topic to something else. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. When is he returning?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cEveryone has been talking about Duke Herhardt coming back, but you don\u2019t seem to care.\u201dLeyla tightened her grip on the handlebars of her bicycle. She and Duke Herhardt had never had any contact in the last few years. They just exchanged greetings when they ran into each other in the woods or when Claudine called her to the mansion.Just passing by the Duke made her feel nervous, so Leyla tried to stay away from him at all costs.To put it bluntly, she didn\u2019t want to see him.Since the day Duke Herhardt stopped her spinning gold coin with his foot that summer evening, she had never wanted to see him again.Claudine invited her then abandoned her, but it was the Duke who made her know; how worthless Leyla Lewellin was in that strange, colorful world.That encounter left a scar that was different from the mistreatment she had received at Lovita.It was a recollection she desperately tried to erase. But whenever she came face to face with the Duke, he always caused her to remember that awful day.Leyla despised him.The Duke\u2019s appearance always reminded her how meaningless she was in that beautiful estate.Leyla sought to keep her unsteady breathing, at the same timing as a black car drove by.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Duchess Norma, the Duke\u2019s grandmother, never rode a car. So Leyla believed it was Duchess Elysse, who had returned from a social gathering.\u201cArvis must be busy for a while now that the Duke has returned.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cOh yes, Leyla. Should I try pursuing a career as an officer too?\u201d Kyle started walking backward while facing Leyla. \u201cLike Duke Herhardt, I\u2019d like to be awarded a medal. Captain Etman, a genius sniper capable of taking out any foe with a single shot.\u201d He pretended to fire an imaginary gun and grinning like a naughty kid.\u201cGeez, look at yourself, Mr. Etman. You can\u2019t even kill a chicken.\u201dWith a smirk, Leyla walked forward. Kyle was unable to counter her, although his pride had taken a hit.He boldly insisted last year that he would pay for his meals in the cottage by helping out.\u00a0Uncle Bill then told him to catch a chicken for dinner, but he couldn\u2019t even get a single feather out when he got inside the hencoop.And after that, Kyle Etman earned the unflattering moniker of \u201cthe gluttonous herbivore.\u201d\u201cKyle Etman, my sweet friend. That\u2019s why I like you.\u201dKyle\u2019s upset face brought a smile from Leyla.\u201cI hope, instead of killing others, you use your hands to save them.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026 Of course. I\u2019m\u00a0planning to become a doctor.\u201d Kyle placed his hand on his cheek in an awkward pose. \u201cThen should I be a military doctor? Military doctors receive awards, too, right?\u201cWouldn\u2019t they give you one if you save a ton of people? It\u2019s a more great achievement than murder.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dDuring their chat, the two finally came to a fork in the street.\u00a0Etman\u2019s house was located at the end of the left-hand lane.Suddenly, Kyle\u2019s brow furrowed as he realized something,\u00a0\u201cAh! I forgot to bring you the geometry notes I promised to lend you.\u201d\u201cThen come back later for dinner. Make sure you bring your notes with you.\u201d\u201cHey, will you wait for me or for the notes?\u201d\u201cThe notes.\u201dLeyla boldly responded, then burst out laughing mischievously, so Kyle began rushing back to his house.\u201cKyle, there\u2019s no need to rush! Preparing dinner takes time!\u201d Leyla loudly shouted towards his back.\u201cDon\u2019t bother! After picking up my notes, I\u2019m heading straight to your house!\u201d But Kyle\u2019s retort was far more vehement.Leyla only shook her head at his stubbornness and began riding her bike towards the Platanus road leading to the Arvis mansion.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The butler and the driver were both startled by their master\u2019s sudden return when the black car came to a complete stop in front of the mansion driveway.Duke Herhardt\u2019s arrival was unexpected.The Arvis servants and tenants were busy desperately rushing around to brace for his early arrival. As a result, the Duke\u2019s scheduled social meetings with the nobility were all pushed up.Butler Hessen with his dried mouth gulped out of nervousness. \u201cMaster, we still haven\u2019t\u2026..\u201d\u201cI want to take a walk.\u201dMatthias cut off the butler\u2019s words with his calm tone. The driver hesitantly got off his seat and opened the back seat door.\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He briefly shook his head towards Hessen, who was about to follow him out. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the mansion,\u201d Matthias smiled as he turned his back.At his order, Hessen returned to the car while the driver quickly got back to his seat. After they drove away, the road became silent again.Matthias took a leisurely stroll under the tree shade, holding his officer\u2019s hat in one hand.\u00a0The sound of his boots coupled with the swaying leaves in the breeze created a unique yet thrilling melody.Matthias von Herhardt was the image of perfection as a child, a student, and an officer.And now, he was about to marry a perfect woman and become a perfect father.All of these facets of his life were so perfect that he began to feel a little bored.Matthias slowed the tempo of his steps. The bright stream of ray poured through the gaps in the tree leaves illuminated the edge of his slightly slanted eyes. His golden belt buckle,\u00a0 and the gleaming insignia decorated his blue-gray uniform were then softly bathed in the light.\u2018You will get engaged this summer.\u2019Matthias had happily listened to his mother\u2019s wishes. Merely, because it was his rightful duty to marry and give birth to a successor at the proper time.\u2018I believe Claudine is the most suitable candidate for the role of Duchess of Arvis.\u2019He had even graciously welcomed his grandmother\u2019s consent, precisely because Claudine von Brandt was a well-qualified bride with a reputable pedigree.But, nothing had ever sparked Matthias\u2019 desire.Since everything had already been put in his grasp before he even knew it, the desire was a far-off feeling that he discarded as fictitious.So was his marriage.Matthias wished for a perfect union. Marriage was nothing more than a stepping stone for him to strengthen his world. So,\u00a0there was no reason to waste all needless feelings in a bond called marriage.He believed Claudine von Brandt was his most fair companion. She was adequate for him, so he didn\u2019t care for anything else, and he didn\u2019t feel obligated to do so.The shattered sunshine pierced his vision as he lifted his head.Matthias paused in the middle of the road the moment he felt the mysterious appearance of a girl.His attention was attracted to a girl on a bicycle who was heading in his direction. Her fine golden cotton hair fluttered across the breeze like a gentle wave.He slowly backed away when the woman passed by his left.\u201cLeyla Lewellin?\u201dThat girl flicked her head towards him as soon as Matthias remembered her name.When she met his gaze, her green eyes widened.\u201cAahhh!\u201dThat girl lost her balance and fell from her bicycle. Her cries could be heard when the bike clashed with the pavement.The bicycle\u2019s wheels continued to spin wildly long after she collapsed.\u00a0Matthias marched quickly up to her, who had fallen on the ground.Under his looming shadow, that girl lifted her head.Without a doubt, she was Leyla Lewellin.The bird-lover maniac little girl.*\u201c\u2026\u2026Oh, I\u2019m sorry, my lord.\u201dLeyla hurriedly bent her head in apologies and waited for him to pass on by her.Matthias was about to leave when he got distracted by Leyla\u2019s outfit.Blood was seeping from her ripped stockings, and her school uniform was caked with dust.Silence fell over the two when the spinning bicycle wheel stilled.Leyla raised her finely frowned eyebrows and sent Matthias a sidelong look. Her face rendered an oddly soft image, even though she was showing an insolent expression.\u2018Seems this girl grew as well.\u2019Although it was natural for the child to grow as time went by, her change in appearance had somehow made him feel like scratching his nerves.Leyla Lewellin was nothing more than a little child to Matthias.The girl who tried everything she could to stay away from him at all costs. The girl he regarded as meaningless.But now, he couldn\u2019t correlate that meaningless girl he remembered with the Leyla Lewellin who was standing in front of him right now.Her rosy cheeks, soft hair, and sweet body scent was borne by the wind.Her slender lines of her body that were visible under the tight, summer school uniform, were no longer those of a skinny child.Matthias sensed a curious discomfort as Leyla struggled to get up. She took a step back and braided her shoelaces before dusting off her school dress.Although Leyla was now an adult, she was still too short of reaching the tip of his chin.\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dMatthias called her name on the spur of the moment. The tone of his accent made Leyla\u2019s shoulders flinch.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lord.\u201dLeyla crouched beneath his feet, uttering the same lines repeatedly while she started gathering up her dropped belongings; the bag, books, notes.Matthias\u2019 focus was drawn to the delicate, pale hands, which were coated with dust and blood. When he watched Leyla collecting her things, his gaze was lured to a pen that she softly nudged.Slowly, Matthias walked forward and stepped on her pen on purpose.Leyla glanced up and saw Matthias was staring at her with irritation in his eyes.\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dHe called her name once more.\u201cI\u2019m talking to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Yes, my lord.\u201d Leyla answered, as she shut her eyes tightly.Matthias didn\u2019t budge when she tried to get the pen out of his stepping shoes.\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201dLeyla said quite confidently even though her body trembled. Her green eyes, which had resembled the vibrant summer forest, twinkled with anger and humiliation.Her memory flashed back to the moment the duke stepped on her gold coin. He looked down at her with the same expression and gaze on that day as he was now.Matthias finally lifted his foot and casually passed by her after letting out a short laugh.As if nothing had happened, he put on his officer\u2019s hat and began sauntering down the road.Leyla could only stare at the back of Duke Herhardt from afar while the pen in her hands quivered.She wondered.\u00a0Why would the Duke do something like that if he wasn\u2019t planning on saying anything?Would the people of Arvis believe that Duke Herhardt, the perfect aristocrat, would act in such a way?She was willing to stake her entire savings that no one would believe her.Everyone would have thought she was insane.Leyla pulled her bicycle up and closed her lips tightly. She made sure to wipe her pen clean before putting it in her bag and began following the duke, who was walking ahead slowly.Leyla was sure the duke wouldn\u2019t look back. Still, she tried to walk properly even though her skin that had got rubbed off was in horrible pain and flexed her leg muscles to keep herself from limping.\u2018It will be great if he uses those long legs to walk faster.\u2019Leyla was about to sigh with annoyance, when Duke Herhardt suddenly turned around towards her.The sudden gust of wind rattled the tree leaves, and the pattern of sunshine dripping through the leaves danced in a slow rhythm over the road.Startled, Leyla stood still like a statue. But, Matthias\u2019 gaze was already drawn to her beautiful features.His eyes moved downwards.First to her long, wavy hair, then to her enthralled body.To her upright chest which was panting up and down unevenly. And, to her pasty hand gripping the pedals of the bicycle.The sylph-like ankle and her petite feet.And then to her alluring eyes.For a long time, Matthias stood in grim silence, peering into Leyla\u2019s emerald-colored eyes.She was an orphan residing in his estate\u2019s lodge, but one crucial fact seemed to have changed everything.That little girl grew older as time went by.Matthias noticed her as he acknowledged the fact.She was no longer a child.She was a woman, Leyla Lewellin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But Claudine von Brandt had another reason to visit Arvis this year, as everybody knew.Before revealing the engagement to the public, a meeting was planned for the two families to pre-negotiate and foster friendship between them.The meeting\u2019s intent was obvious to both families, and neither party, particularly Claudine, had tried to conceal it.\u201cHello, Duke Herhardt.\u201dMatthias was received politely by Claudine. His cousin in front of him had matured into a refined lady, and he couldn\u2019t make out the outlines of that short, whiny girl from her anymore.\u201cWelcome, Lady Brandt.\u201dHe returned Claudine\u2019s formal greeting, and the two exchanged graceful smiles.Between the two, there was nothing new to speak about.\u00a0They were not very close or intimate, but they had known each other for a long time.They both knew, how aristocratic Matthias von Herhardt and Claudine von Brandt were to the marrow. This was the most important and apparent reason why they chose each other.Matthias escorted Claudine expertly. His mother, Elysse von Herhardt, instructed the servants to prepare their afternoon tea in the glass greenhouse attached to the mansion\u2019s rear.\u00a0Elysse adored the greenhouse, so in a way, it was also a form of expressing her affection for Claudine.\u201cEvery time I visit this greenhouse, it never ceases to amaze me. It\u2019s as if Duchess Elysse has migrated heaven into this place.\u201dClaudine sipped her tea quietly and gratefully complimented her. She talked in a pleasant yet excellent manner, as one might expect from a noblewoman.\u201cI\u2019ve put a lot of effort into decorating this place. I\u2019m looking forward to give it to a hostess who understands its worth.\u201dIn hushed voices, Elysse spoke up. When Countess Brandt heard of it, she gave her daughter a proud and emotional glance, but Claudine just smiled shyly.\u201cMatthias, take Claudine on a tour of Arvis\u2019s heaven.\u201dElysse\u2019s whisper to her son at the end of their tea break, marking the start of larger-scale deals between two-families.Claudine smoothly laid her transparent lace-gloved hands over Matthias\u2019s as he extended his hand.Her fair-skinned image regained his memory of someone\u2019s hand covered with dust and blood for a fleeting moment until it disappeared in the blink of an eye.They talked about a mild topic as they walked along the road.The clear chirping of birds melted away the languid mood of the afternoon in that place, where a stream of water gently flowed from the marble fountain that embellished the center of the greenhouse.Matthias captured Claudine\u2019s eye in a stealthy glimpse. It was difficult to interpret his inner emotions and his mindset toward the world, despite him often smiling peacefully.For Claudine, he was an interesting object to look at.Matthias was a gentleman, but he was also a haughty person who never had bowed down to anybody in his life.\u201cThis greenhouse has many lovely birds.\u201dClaudine was mesmerized by the brightly colored birds perched on the tree branches, and Matthias had only seen those birds in the glass greenhouse now.Elysse, the Arvis\u2019 present hostess, was as fond of birds as she was of flowers.The zookeepers were in charge of caring for the birds in the greenhouse, much as the gardeners were in charge of growing the roses.And her job? It was to simply take in the scenery.Elysse von Herhardt viewed her beautiful world in this light. \u2013Take pride in the job that others have done for her-\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. This little one is exceptionally well-behaved. What\u2019s your secret?\u201d Claudine asked; a tiny bird landed on her palm and made her smile.Matthias took a long, restful glance around him, realizing the birds in this greenhouse were surprisingly docile.The birds didn\u2019t dare to fly out, even if the window was wide open; instead, they continued to sing melodiously in this tranquil, beautiful prison.His attention turned to the gray-haired zookeeper after seeing the parrot trundled over the windowsill, and the\u00a0Bengalese finch warbled on Claudine\u2019s hand.The zookeeper then approached them,\u201cI clipped their wings, Miss. They are thus unwilling to fly or escape, and they become obedient. If I leave their wings uncut, they would be difficult to tame.\u201dThe old man answered her question.\u201cTheir wings? Wouldn\u2019t that hurt them?\u201d\u201cI just cut their feathers, so they don\u2019t feel pain,\u201d He continued to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s also beneficial to the birds because it keeps them from going into dangerous places and being wounded. Would you like me to show it? \u201c\u201cWould you mind it, Lord Herhardt, if I see that?\u201d Claudine asked with her eyes twinkling.\u201cAs you wish, my Lady.\u201dThe zookeeper led them to a big cage at the end of the greenhouse after Matthias gladly granted his permission. There were birds inside whose wings hadn\u2019t been trimmed yet.\u201cWhat kind of bird is it?\u201d Matthias asked as he watched the bird.\u201cIt\u2019s a canary, my Lord. A lovely singing bird.\u201dThe zookeeper stretched out the bird\u2019s wings and covered its eyes with a small handkerchief. On his other hand, he quickly grabbed a pair of trimmer scissors.Without hesitation, the elderly man moved the scissors\u2019 blade. The cut canary\u2019s fine feathers were scattered around the worktable.He finished his task by trimming the other side of the wing and then releasing the bird.The canary flailed its wings desperately, but it was unable to go far and fell slowly.As if the bird couldn\u2019t believe that it couldn\u2019t fly anymore, it attempted to flap several times more, but the result remained the same the whole time.Matthias, who leaned there watching, reached over and scooped up the shivering yellow bird at the end of the flower bed.\u201cMaster, a canary is not easily tamed. The bird must get used to the clipping over time.\u201dThe canary that had been stuck in his hands began to struggle and chirp. But it sounded more like a cry than a melody. So Matthias handed the bird back to the zookeeper.\u201cWould you like to try cutting one, Miss?\u201d\u00a0The zookeeper stroked the bird gently to make it calm.\u201cI like to observe animals rather than tame them. Thank you for bringing an end to my inquisitiveness.\u201dClaudine respectfully declined and walked away.\u201cLet us go back to the tea-table right now.\u201dClaudine took the initiative this time and offered her hand first. Matthias\u2019s memory once again flashed back to the beautiful, sculpture-like hand that had been soiled with dust and blood and then faded away.\u201cBring that to my bedroom.\u201dMatthias made a spontaneous order to the old man before leaving the area with Claudine.The zookeeper\u2019s eyes narrowed in surprise as he heard the sudden request. \u201c\u2026.. Yes, my Lord?\u201d\u201cThat bird.\u201dMatthias pointed to the bird with his thinly opened eyes.\u201cMy canary.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla made a single ponytail out of her combed blonde hair. She then put on an apron and didn\u2019t forget to pick up her huge basket.\u201cI have to finish it soon.\u201dLeyla\u2019s expression was grave as she muttered to herself. Lady Brandt had paid a visit to Arvis a few days before Duke Herhardt\u2019s arrival.As a consequence, Leyla was pressed for time. Before she ran into the Duke again. Or was summoned by Lady Brandt, she had to pick all the raspberries in the woods.However, those two people were fortunately occupied as they seemed to be preparing to announce their marriage.Leyla took a short walk into the woods while wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat. She found a bush of overgrown raspberries there.There were always lots of fruits dropping on the ground and rotting away, no matter how much the people of Arvis and the forest animals picked and ate it.Before midday, Leyla tirelessly trekked the forest and loaded her big basket. She felt rollicking, although her arms felt like they were going to crumble down owing to the heavyweight of the basket.She placed her basket under the shadow of a tree and dashed for the water to rinse the fierce raspberry smell and color from her hands and face.The garden of Herhardt and its valleys was encircled by the Schulter River.The river\u2019s curve looked beautiful from the central city, but the Arvis cemetery had the best view of that river.Leyla dug into her apron for a handkerchief and wiped the water droplets off her face.Over the season, that refreshing river contributed a lot to mitigate the scorching weather. She thought of dipping her feet into the river, but she quickly discarded the notion.In her aunt\u2019s house, where she first lived before being shipped out, Leyla had five older cousins who were always rough and rude to her.One day, she had been dragged and thrown into a river by her cousins.\u00a0Leyla might have been taken by the water spirit if her neighbor didn\u2019t hear her scream and rescued her from drowning.However, her cousins defended their behavior by claiming it was her initiative as a ritual ceremony stepped into their household.Even though her cousins were at fault, Leyla was the one who was beaten by her drunk uncle that night. She was driven out and relocated to her next relative\u2019s house in the next few weeks, with an excuse that they couldn\u2019t take care of a child who took their kindness for granted.Although it was unfair, Leyla wanted to see it as a positive because she thought her next relative\u2019s house would be better for her.The following house.The next house after that.Leyla wished for better care any time she was transferred from one place to another.And when she eventually settled down at Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage, she felt her sincere dreams had been granted.So far, it has gone well.Leyla turned around and walked under the shade of the tree. She stuffed the newspaper pinned to the basket\u2019s corner into her apron pocket and started climbing it.Uncle Bill had taught her that. So she knew how to, even though she wasn\u2019t as fast and flexible as she used to be.Leyla perched like a well-fitted chair on the tree branch.Looking down, she was confident that the Schulter River was the most beautiful river on the earth.Kyle, who had traveled to a variety of cities before, also agreed with her. So Leyla believed her point of view had been validated by credible evidence.Summer was, without a doubt, one of the most paradisal seasons of the year.As the fresh scent of the river permeated through her nose, she watched the water birds hunting for food from the high tree.Leyla took the newspaper from her apron pocket. She flipped to the mystery serial novel section with a focused look on her eyes. In this episode, the main detective was about to reveal the murderer by his brilliant analysis.Leyla began to read the novel with zeal\u00a0when Matthias suddenly raised his face from under the water\u2019s surface.His fit, naked body was displayed over the river water.\u00a0His distinctive Adam\u2019s apple went up and down to the beat of his rapid breathing.Matthias had changed his mind and started swimming in the reverse direction of the stream just as he was about to return to his mansion.Matthias enjoyed the Schulter River and the Arvis forest so much.\u00a0He moved to the building next to the dock, where he could have a panoramic view of the whole scene from his small annex.Matthias\u2019s grandmother and mother never walked by the riverside. That\u2019s why that place was like Matthias\u2019s private world.When there were no guests at the mansion, Matthias often visited the annex. Just to blankly stare at the landscape beyond the window, read a book, or even take a nap if he was bored.It\u2019s the most enjoyable place to do things.Of course, his favorite thing to do, just as now, was to sink his body into the river.Matthias looked up at the horizon obscured by the green branches when floating in the water.The sound of swaying leaves and rippling water, as well as the birds\u2019 chirp, they were both roiled by the gentle breeze.The mansion had been noisy over the previous few days, so it was only today that he could deeply feel the river\u2019s calmness.The negotiation process for the marriage deal that Herhardt and the Brandt family were about to sign had gone smoothly.His engagement to Claudine was scheduled to be confirmed by the end of the summer if nothing surprising happened.Matthias agreed to a year-long engagement. He didn\u2019t have to keep his job as an officer if he earned enough honor as the Duke of Arvis.Moreover, he was at the most suitable time to discharge from the military and marry after serving about one or two years in the military division. So, after the wedding, he planned to devote his whole attention to his family\u2019s business.It was a life where he would glide along like a steady, calm stream.With his eyes closed, Matthias surrendered his body to the river. Bright sunlight, melting water, and the sound of swirls breaking down in his ears seemed to be all that existed in his world.But his utter peace was broken the second he opened his eyes again.There\u2019s a woman sitting on the limbs of the sturdy tree by the river.Matthias recognized the woman\u2019s features before he had a chance to blink his eyes.At that exact moment, the woman who folded up her newspaper she was reading turned her head towards him.It was that annoying woman.Leyla Lewellin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was often frightened when she thought of a tree branch floating in the water as a person.However, the visible silhouette that appeared from the water this time was unmistakably a human.And it was a man.A tall, bare-chested man.Leyla couldn\u2019t stick to her self-justification that it was all a trick of the light as his wet, black hair emerged into her view.Right now, afloat on the river undoubtedly, was the Duke Matthias von Herhardt.The flabbergasted Leyla threw down the newspaper she was holding.She might have slumped to the ground along with her newspaper if she hadn\u2019t immediately grabbed the tree branch.Her intuition had taught her everything.\u00a0-Close your eyes for the time being. No, get off the tree as quickly as you can and get out of this forest. -Or, at the very least, just shout in surprise-But all Leyla could do was stare at the guy in his underwear, dumbstruck.Beyond a doubt, it was Duke Herhardt. The man clearly returned Leyla\u2019s stare, with no intention of hiding his nude body while still afloat in the river.I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll drift away!By the time the breeze began to rage with gusto, the Duke had started to swim for the river\u2019s edge, to the place where Leyla was.\u201cAh, no!\u201dThe cry of Leyla echoed up into the cloudless sky.\u201cNo! Don\u2019t come here! You can\u2019t come!\u201dLeyla quickly climbed down from the oak, shrieking in panic. She couldn\u2019t think of anything, so she didn\u2019t even bother to greet the Duke with courtesy.Leyla dropped her basket as well as her hat and bolted quickly. She raced through the forest without noticing how fast her legs ran.\u201cLeyla!\u201dLeyla bumped into Kyle around halfway up the path leading to the cottage.\u00a0Kyle was flummoxed when he saw her and immediately caught Leyla, who almost fell.\u201cWhere have you been? I was looking for you because you weren\u2019t at home.\u201d\u201cKyle, Kyle, what should I do?\u201dLeyla muttered hoarsely; she gasped for breath like a half-crazed person.\u201cWhy? What\u2019s going on? Did you come across a wild animal?\u201dKyle moved his gaze beyond the road as Leyla shook her head vehemently. There was little to be found. In front of them, all he saw was just an ordinary forest.\u201cThen what is it? What is it that has shocked you so much?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 What should I do?\u201dLeyla sobbed and fell to the ground, veiling her face with the hem of her apron and shook her head a couple of times.She didn\u2019t want to remember, but the image of the Duke\u2019s muscular body kept flickering through her mind.Leyla ruffled her hair with her fingers. \u201cWhat should I do? What should I do, Kyle?\u201d\u201cIf you could tell me what your problem is, I\u2019ll answer you. What the heck is it?\u201d\u00a0Kyle sighed as he kneeled in front of her.In no time, Leyla\u2019s face had rendered as crimson as a freshly-picked raspberry.Kyle started giggling, \u201cHey, what things did you see? Did you see a ghost?\u201dNo.Leyla had everything she wanted to say, but her lips couldn\u2019t open.It\u2019s something scarier than that \u2026.Her hot gasps split out the phrases she softly whispered.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Water dripped down his nose from the tip of his wet hair. Matthias was still bemused by the incredible scene that had happened in front of him.He swam to his annex\u2019s dock and wore his clothes. After that, Matthias approached the tree where Leyla had dumped all her belongings before she ran away.Matthias looked through the traces left by Leyla. Near the tree, there was a big basket and a hat\u2014a newspaper on the ground and a wet handkerchief.After checking the basket full of raspberries, he let out a fake chuckle.\u00a0He couldn\u2019t believe that girl was carrying such a large basket with her slender arms.Did she want to get rid of all the raspberries in the Arvis forest?Matthies glanced up to the beautiful oak tree and realized that it was the same tree where he had almost shot that little girl a few years ago.When he remembered the moment when her little face, sitting on the branch, looked at him vacantly, Matthias cracked out laughing.Don\u2019t tell me she still plays around climbing trees.At first, he was thinking of chasing after her.Matthias, however, changed his mind and returned to the mansion because this afternoon, he had a meeting with the board of directors of his family company.Matthias wasn\u2019t directly involved with the company\u2019s management, but it was his responsibility to review their proposals.He was, therefore, in charge of managing the overall structure of the organization and the efficiency of his subordinates\u2019 jobs.Based on their land and property assets, the Herhardt family broadened their trade and natural resources scope. Matthias\u2019 grandfather, who had amassed a vast amount of wealth for the family, had taken the ambitious decision to invest in the emerging Empire\u2019s oil fields.Matthias now owned much of the Herhardt household\u2019s honour and authority, which had been established over the years by the previous owners.Matthias was fully conscious of this.He understood that it was his most important duty to uphold the honour and authority of the Herhardt family and hand them onto the next Herhardt.He\u2019d never questioned his own abilities. So Matthias had great confidence that he would perform his duties better than anyone else.Once Matthias finally arrived at the mansion, he went straight to his bedroom, and changed his attire then straightened his messy hair.After all the preparation, the time before his next appointment was still an hour out. Matthias leaned against the chair by the window on the west side of his bedroom.He was about to rise from his chair, thinking that sitting and waiting was a waste of time until he heard the sound of the chirping bird.Matthias turned his eyes to the source of the noise. On the table, he found the canary inside the birdcage was humming.He used to think it didn\u2019t know how to sing because the bird was so quiet. So he was surprised when the canary was singing beautifully, enough to drown out his previous thoughts.Matthias sauntered to the birdcage and unlocked its door. The canary inside stopped humming, and flailed its clipped wings and escaped from the cage.He was about to leave the room when he changed his mind and leaned against the window frame to watch the bird.That tiny creature was very diligent. It flew, fell, and then hovered around the room without pausing.After a while, the canary grew tired and perched down peacefully on the armrest of the chair.Matthias took the bird and put it back in the cage. The canary obediently entrusted itself to its owner rather than struggling and giving out a deafening chirp.Matthias was intrigued by the bird\u2019s personality change, so he tried putting it on his forefinger.He wanted the bird to fly, but it surprisingly stayed still and kept looking at him.\u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve found a new world.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Looking at Leyla muttering something incomprehensible in shock. The grey-haired optician just let out a robust chuckle.\u201cI understand. Your eyesight is bad. You must be having a hard time.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that bad. Except when I have to read books. \u201cLeyla cheerfully answered while putting down her glasses on the table after she had adjusted them.Her smoggy world miraculously became visible, and the clear view in front of her enthralled her once more.Leyla\u2019s fingertips had turned the harvest of raspberries produced by the forest into jam.After saving up enough money to buy a pair of glasses, she rode her bike downtown. She quickly drove to the optometrist\u2019s shop, where she used to visit frequently.Leyla headed out of the shop after consulting with the optician for a few minutes longer. Through her glasses, the scenery on the outside now became so crystal-clear.It seemed strange yet mesmerizing.Leyla conveyed her gratitude and love for the Arvis forest\u2019s wild fruits, which shone brilliantly in the warm sun. She also praised herself for the long hours she had spent stirring raspberry jam in front of the stove in the sweltering weather.But why? Why did she still have those terrible memories on such joyous occasions?Leyla sighed as she remembered the day she accidentally saw the Duke\u2019s body nearly naked.She was both ashamed and frightened, so Leyla had to wait until the sun had fallen before leaving to collect her basket and hat.The forest when she returned was so placid, and the river glistened peacefully. Leyla felt relieved and hurriedly headed away from the river, with her basket and hat in hand.However, her cheeks were still boiling hot. She was so flustered that she didn\u2019t even realize how heavy the basket she was carrying was.After that day, Leyla became embarrassed every time she saw guys, even to look at Uncle Bill and Kyle.How could he swim naked in the river, even though it\u2019s his estate? More so in broad daylight?Leyla shook her head, trying to remove the traumatic memory from her mind.I shouldn\u2019t go to the riverside until the duke leaves this estate.Leyla committed to herself and was preparing to return to the estate until she heard a voice she recognized.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Leyla?\u201dWell, it\u2019s her.Unmistakably, that loud-high voice belonged to Claudine von Brandt.Leyla stopped to catch her breath before finally turning around.Her face was lit up with a polite smile. But her body froze as she unexpectedly locked eyes with Duke Herhardt, the person who had just disturbed her mind just a few moments ago.Leyla had a clear view of the man in front of her. She abruptly shifted her gaze to Claudine, who was standing alongside him.Claudine didn\u2019t visit Arvis as much as she used to when Duke Herhardt was away serving as an officer on the battlefield\u2019s front lines.It had been a long time since Leyla had seen her, and Claudine had grown into a gorgeous woman.The two gracefully nodded to accept Leyla\u2019s greeting after she courteously paid her respects to them.\u201cWhen did you start wearing glasses? I almost mistook you for someone else.\u201dLeyla hoped for her to leave, but Claudine spoke again. So, having no other choice, Leyla faced her with a prepared smile and tried hard not to look Duke Herhardt in the eyes.\u201cHave you been doing well?\u201dThrough her slightly opened eyes, Claudine meticulously analyzed Leyla.\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d\u201cWe were on our way to have some tea.\u201dClaudine used her eyes to guide Leyla\u2019s attention to the hotel across the street.Yes, Miss. Or\u00a0I see, Miss.Leyla was debating which response to give when Claudine generously said, \u201cLet\u2019s go together, Leyla.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen each other, so I\u2019d like to have a cup of tea with you. Is that fine with you, Duke Herhardt?\u201dMatthias conveyed his approval with a thin smile on the tip of his lips after Claudine asked him.As usual, they seemed uninterested in what Leyla had to say.Leyla sighed and began to follow them from behind as the two continued their stroll.\u00a0The servants who were accompanying them also followed suit quietly.The sound of footsteps was mingled with the clunking sound of the old wheel when Leyla dragged her bicycle behind them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Safe World \u2727The doorman looked flustered when the three of them arrived at the entrance.Leyla showed him a friendly smile as though she understood why the doorman was staring at her in wonder as no one had ever brought a lousy bicycle to the city\u2019s finest hotel.Her bicycle was taken away after the doorman checked her and Claudine for several minutes. Leyla entered the hotel after voicing her thanks with a simple greeting.The tea lounge was located on the right side of the main lobby. The manager led them in quick steps to the terrace that faced out across the riverside.The last one to take a seat at the table was Leyla.Not sure if she had bad luck today, but it so happened that his chair was right across from Duke Herhardt.\u00a0To avoid his cold stare, Leyla hurriedly fixed her eyes on her thighs.The summer sun reflected brilliantly on her thin, gold-frame glasses.\u00a0The Duke continued to look at her casually as if nothing had happened at the river, absolutely amazing Leyla.Shouldn\u2019t the person who was caught naked should feel more ashamed than the person who saw it?It was hard to deny that commoners and servants were nothing more than furniture or paintings to the aristocratic people.They weren\u2019t embarrassed to be naked in front of a piece of furniture. And there wasn\u2019t a single piece of furniture that was shocked at the sight of a nude person.The tea table had already been set up by the time Leyla came to her conclusion.Even though Duke Herhardt hadn\u2019t given an order, a cup of strongly scented coffee was placed in front of him. Then, he held the teacup handle with his smooth-tapering fingers and took a sip.Like they\u2019d forgotten about Leyla\u2019s existence, Claudine and Matthias were engrossed in continuing their own discussion.From the exhibition they saw today, the news about their relatives, till the plan about a weekend party at the mansion their conversation covered all these fleeting topics.Matthias\u2019s gentle-baritone voice and Claudine\u2019s soprano high note overlapped at regular intervals.Leyla was confused as to why they had taken her along if they were going to chat between themselves.The acts of Lady Brandt were entirely beyond her understanding. Leyla had always failed to understand Claudine ever since their first meeting in that summer.\u201cSo, Leyla. How\u2019s your school? Are you having fun?\u201dClaudine\u2019s voice and the sound of the cup being placed on the saucer both could be heard at the exact same moment. Although she was just a year above her age, she always talked to Leyla as if she were speaking to a child in an adult-like manner.\u201cYes, Miss.\u201dFor Uncle Bill.Leyla chanted in her head when she was answering Claudine. She repeatedly answered with a constant smile every time Claudine posed a couple more questions about her school life and gave a nod out of satisfaction.Claudine wanted Leyla\u2019s answers to be a resounding\u00a0\u2018Yes, Miss.\u2019\u00a0And Leyla also had grown accustomed to responding in that way.\u201cYou\u2019ll be graduating next year right?\u201dClaudine\u2019s tone still sounded friendly, even though Leyla only gave a cursory answer.\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d\u201cAfter graduation, what do you want to do?\u201d\u201cI will enroll into a program for a teaching certificate.\u201d\u201cOh, a teacher\u2026?\u201dClaudine raised the corners of her lips while grabbing her teacup. Her nods rattled the ribbon and corsage that adorned her little hat.\u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, Leyla. That\u2019s a wonderful goal. I believe that will be suitable for you.\u201d Claudine smiled once more, praising Leyla for her admirable dream. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Duke Herhardt?\u201dUnintentionally, Leyla moved her focus onto Matthias. His blue-colored eyes were more lucid as she wore her glasses.Leyla hurriedly lowered her eyes as she realized she had been looking at the Duke for way too long.\u201cI see.\u201dIn a calm manner, Matthias agreed.Leyla\u2019s presence then faded away again.\u00a0She was relieved because she wanted this uncomfortable teatime to be over with as quickly as possible.Kyle had gone out to play tennis, and she was supposed to meet him in town. So Leyla was worried that she was going to be late for her appointment.Leyla, who was anxious, lifted her head. At the same moment, Matthias turned his head and looked at her.\u00a0Leyla didn\u2019t avoid his eye contact as she had done before and returned his stare in silence.When she was young, Matthias\u2019 blue eyes reminded her of a round mazarine-colored crystal candy that tasted sweet like sugar. Leyla shook her head in disbelief at her youth\u2019s stupidity.\u201cWell, Duke Herhardt and Lady Claudine, please excuse me.\u201dLeyla had enough of sitting quietly and opened her tender lips.\u201cDo you mind if I excuse myself?\u201dShe felt as if she could breathe again after moving her eyes from Matthias\u2019s eyes to Claudine\u2019s.\u201cI promised my friend that I\u2019ll meet him this afternoon.\u201dLeyla chattered with an anxious look on her face. But soon, her nervous expression dissipated and she heaved a sigh of relief after Claudine smiled, nodded, and granted her permission.She dashed out of the hotel and immediately pedaled her bicycle through the crowded streets after politely bidding her goodbye to the two.Yet there was something strange about it; the more Leyla pedaled further from the Duke, the more unforgettable his face became in her mind.Is it because of the glasses?With a deep sigh, Leyla pondered. The biggest explanation she was hypnotized by the Duke, she believed, was because of her glasses. With her enhanced eyesight, it was normal for her breath to be halted when she saw him.Leyla arrived at the meeting point right as she was going to faint from the tiredness of all the pedaling she had done.Kyle, who first arrived before her, was flashing a broad smile and as he waved his hand.Finally, she\u2019d made her way into her safe place.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cShe has grown up, right? She looks like a lady now.\u201dClaudine shifted her eyes in the direction Leyla had left just a while ago. She sounded like a mother looking at her daughter even though she was just a year older than her.Matthias flashed a proper smile, \u201cBecause she\u2019s a lady.\u201dHe gave a moderate, impassive answer.\u201cYes. She is.\u201dClaudine then paused for a second, lost in thought, before showing her smile that was as bright as the summer sunshine.\u201cOh. Did you hear? Riette has just purchased a brand-new car.\u201d She deftly changed the conversation\u2019s topic.In the world they shared, the two continued their talk. It was as if Leyla Lewellin, who used to sit across from them at the table, had never been there at all.But Leyla and Matthias strangely had met each other again in an unexpected place.Matthias was on his return trip to his mansion after enjoying a relaxing tea break. He casually glanced out of the car passenger window as his car came to a halt due to the overcrowded road.On the sidewalk, he observed at a glimpse, Leyla who was dragging her bicycle.She was walking down the busy street with a boy. That familiar young man he had seen before in the past seemed to be the friend she had promised to meet.Matthias then recalled the name of the familiar-looking boy.The son of Herhardt\u2019s doctor. Kyle Etman.Leyla Lewellin yelled at the boy who kept tapping on his glasses, but the boy looked like he had said something even more mischievous, prompting Leyla to sigh in annoyance, followed by a chuckle.The two stalled in front of the library stairwell after spending a long time laughing and kidding around.Leyla sat at the bottom of the stairs after parking her bike. The boy was following her with a paper bag in his hand and took out two bottles of soda and a sandwich from inside it.Leyla Lewellin and the boy were sitting next to each other at the stairs and sharing their food. She burst out laughing every time the boy said something. When Leyla chuckled, the boy joined in her laughter.Meanwhile, traffic on the busy road began to disperse, and the car started moving again.Matthias turned his eyes away from the window and looked at Claudine who was sitting across the car window on the opposite side.After a brief exchange of smiles and then some, the two resumed their nice little chat.Matthias unintentionally remembered his memories from their teatime at that moment -Leyla Lewellin sat still in an upright position with her hands on her knees and then left quietly without touching the teacup in front of her.-\u2018Hmm, she left me for that boy.\u2019That painful truth evoked his recollection of Leyla\u2019s nervous and agonized expression.\u2018So she chose to see that boy\u2026.\u2019As his thoughts reached this point, Matthias recalled her back as she walked away from the hotel terrace, rushing as if she were running away from him.\u2018So, she left me just to go to meet that boy.\u2019While he was engrossed in his thoughts, their car had already passed the Platanus road leading to the Arvis estate.As the car drove along the road where Leyla fell off her bicycle, Matthias emphasized to himself that the girl.Leyla Lewellin was nothing to him.However, for some reason, he wasn\u2019t too pleased with the unsettling feeling that had lingered in him at that moment.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI\u2019ll buy you ice cream since I ate your sandwich.\u201dWith a light smile, Leyla stood up from the library stairwell. She packed the empty paper bag, along with the bottled beverages, into her bicycle basket with care.\u201cNo thanks. You don\u2019t have to buy me anything.\u201dKyle hopped on her bike with a mildly awkward grin. Leyla sat in the bike\u2019s back seat, which was her usual position.Even in the midday summer sun, Kyle could distinctly sense her body temperature being transferred to his back.Kyle began pedaling to lessen the heat on his cheeks.\u2018Gezz, she could hold me a little tighter.\u2019He muttered to himself as Leyla gently grasped the brim of his shirt as if to tease him.Kyle was delighted with her grip, even though he was a little hopeful.Truthfully, he had deliberately left his bike at home to ride Leyla\u2019s with her.Leyla, of course, was utterly clueless about his intentions.\u201cYou know what, Kyle.\u201dLeyla\u2019s soothing voice suddenly seeped through the swirling wind.\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll still buy you ice cream.\u201dKyle chuckled at her abrupt offer because he was already curious about what she had to say.\u00a0\u201cBe honest; you just want to eat ice cream, don\u2019t you?\u201c\u2026.. That\u2019s not it.\u201dIt was like that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

An orphan raised by the gardener?\u201dWrinkles appeared on Countess Brandt\u2019s forehead when she looked out at the garden from the window, mentioning a lady with glasses who was helping the gardener organize the rose garden.\u201cYes, mother, it\u2019s her\u2026. it\u2019s Leyla.\u201dClaudine gave a straightforward answer.\u00a0She threaded her needle through the fabric gently while her mother was distracted by Leyla who was working in the garden.As Claudine meticulously completed her embroidery, beautiful roses bloomed from her skillful fingertips.\u201cShe\u2019s a pretty young lady. As she grows older, I think she will become much more beautiful.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t that bother you?\u201d\u201cI understand your worry, mother,\u201dClaudine put her embroidered cloth on the table. Countess Brandt had a concerned smile on her face with her eyes wide open.Her frail mother only had one child.\u00a0Claudine, the Brandt family\u2019s only daughter, was the child she had after suffering from several miscarriages.The countess suffered from an inferiority complex. She always lived in fear that she might lose her husband\u2019s love because of her inability to produce a successor for him.Countess Brandt was still worried even though her husband\u2019s mistress was also unable to provide him with a son. She was scared that one day some young, pretty woman would show up and give birth to his son, then take everything away from her.Claudine felt sad for her mother about that. On the other hand, though, she was fed up with her mother\u2019s over-anxiety.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in dwelling on those matters.\u201dThrough a futile sigh, the countess expressed her dissatisfaction at Claudine\u2019s solemn words,\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re too young to know about men\u2019s thoughts. Claudine, if I were you\u2026..\u201d\u201cWould you get rid of all the beautiful women in the world so Duke Herhardt wouldn\u2019t see them?\u201d Claudine grimaced at her mother. \u201cAs you said, I\u2019m still young and don\u2019t have a lot of experience with men. Yet I am aware that men with an excellent image normally have one or two mistresses.\u201d\u201cOh, my goodness, Claudine!\u201d\u201cOf course, I hope anything like this never happens, but even if it does, it won\u2019t bother me.\u201dClaudine shrugged her shoulders lightly.Truthfully, she, who was usually chill, was taken aback when she ran into Leyla by chance.Even though it was natural for a sweet little girl to develop into a beautiful lady, Leyla\u2019s mature beauty was more stunning than she had ever expected.Leyla resembled a fairy with her small, slender body and exquisite facial features.The resemblance to that mystical creature was enhanced by the combination of her enigmatic green eyes and her flawless white skin.Claudine had invited Leyla to join her for tea for this very reason. Her curiosity was piqued.\u00a0She was intrigued to see how the Duke would react to a woman such as her.And Matthias acted up to Claudine\u2019s expectation to a tee.\u00a0He showed proper interest and indifference, as well as impeccable decency and moderation.For Claudine, it was enough.\u201cEven so, Claudine, keeping that girl too close to Matthias isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201dCountess Brant was still agitated.\u201cDo you think I should talk with the Herhardt\u2019s?\u201d\u201cMother.\u201dClaudine\u2019s tone became muffled. She was adamant about not following in her mother\u2019s footsteps, who cried out of love while having everything. That was one of the reasons why she agreed to accept Matthias\u2019 proposal.Claudine was well aware that her life would not have a happy ending as in a fairy tale.Matthias von Herhardt was a nobleman who was both wealthy and attractive. That kind of guy, she believed, would never only love his wife, whom he wed in an arranged marriage.\u2018Perhaps he, too, would be carried away with his lust for a beautiful woman, just like my father. Like a lot of other guys.\u2019Men who merely looked at their mistress as a mistress were perfectly safe. But men who didn\u2019t treat their mistress as a mistress were the ones who caused trouble.Claudine was sure Matthias was, without a doubt, the first league type of man.\u2018Do I love him?\u2019Claudine simply smiled and tilted her head in answer to this question.\u2018Maybe or Maybe not.\u2019It wasn\u2019t, though, a big concern. Matthias also fully knew about this.What actually mattered most to her was whether Matthias, as Duke of Arvis, could play both the role of a wonderful husband and a great father.That was everything Claudine needed.\u00a0A marriage that would protect her dignity and preserve her elegance.\u201cIs it such a big deal if Duke Herhardt is interested in that humble, beautiful girl?\u201dCountess Brandt was gobsmacked by Claudine\u2019s words, which she had delivered calmly. \u201cOh my God, Claudine! What the hell are you talking about?\u201d\u201cAt the very least, she\u2019ll only end up as a mistress.\u201dClaudine made a noise as if it was a joke.\u201cFor a girl like that to become a mistress, it would really be convenient for me. A woman who wouldn\u2019t dare to invade my turf, who I can control within my palms.\u201d\u201cClaudine, my daughter. You\u2026\u2026 you really don\u2019t know anything about love.\u201dCountess Brandt\u2019s laments for her daughter became louder.Claudine stared into her mother\u2019s bright blue eyes before turning aside and smiling strangely.She gazed out the window at Leyla. Staring at that girl who rose off the flower field and started massaging her back while laughing.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The cottage was empty when Kyle arrived.Uncle Bill and Leyla seemed to be enjoying time together in the garden.Kyle sat on the porch in a chair, waiting for the two to come back. He grinned as he remembered Leyla\u2019s countenance with her glasses on.Even with her face covered with glasses, the future-Madam Etman still looked attractive.His heart fluttered at the thought of her face, notwithstanding the fact that he initially felt odd staring at her new appearance.Kyle coughed purposefully in a way to prevent his cheeks from turning flushed. At the same time, Leyla and Uncle Bill had returned from their work.\u201cGosh, what kind of hat is that?\u201dHis eyebrows suddenly furrowed as he saw a\u00a0bucolic\u00a0hat shielding Leyla\u2019s lovely face.\u201cDid you spend money on that \u201ctacky\u201d thing?\u201dAfter Kyle threw his teasing words around, both Leyla and Bill all turned their gaze towards him fiercely.\u201cUncle bought it for me!\u201dLeyla shouted, putting a scowled face towards Kyle. Bill joined in retaliating by taking up the shovel he\u2019d stowed in the cart.Kyle quickly changed his opinion. \u201cAfter seeing it again, I can\u2019t help but say, wow, how pretty it is! Uncle Bill has great eyes!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of it. It\u2019s really precious to me.\u201dThe sulking Leyla removed her flashy woodsy hat, which was lavishly decorated with artificial flowers and colourful ribbons.Bill was busy storing his cart while Leyla started preparing lunch. The problematic hat was positioned at the far end of the table.\u201cLeyla, are you mad?\u201dKyle took a seat in front of the hat, trying to decipher Leyla\u2019s mood.\u201cYeah.\u201d Leyla slammed Kyle\u2019s plate onto the table.\u2018At least she\u2019s still giving me food.\u2019\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You know I wouldn\u2019t say that if I knew?\u201d\u201cOh, whatever.\u201d\u201cBut why did Uncle Bill buy you a hat?\u201d\u201cBecause I asked him for it.\u201d\u201cYou? You know how to ask for stuff?\u201dKyle asked in surprise since all this time, he knew Leyla as a girl who barely requested something.\u201cHe\u2019s pissed off about my glasses\u201dLeyla\u2019s voice weakened as she said that.\u201cDid he get upset because your sight worsened?\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s not it. He was upset because I never told him that I purchased costly glasses from my own money.\u201dAfter she finished setting the table, Leyla took a seat across from Kyle.Bill was stupefied when she returned to the cottage with glasses on. He looked as if he had been shot in the back of the head.\u00a0His face became as cold as an ice block after listening to her explanation of how she could get her glasses installed.And it was the first time Uncle Bill had become so angry with her.\u2018Leyla. Am I unreliable to you?\u2019Uncle Bill sighed and sat back in his chair.Looking at his sad eyes made Leyla feel suffocated. When she clarified that she didn\u2019t want to burden him because she was already very grateful for what he had done for her, his eyes became sadder.Ever since that day, their relationship had become a little awkward.Bill was sulky and refused to speak, and Leyla felt stumped for words not knowing what to do.\u00a0The hat was the solution she had found in the end.\u2018Uncle, please buy me a hat.\u2019Until a few days ago, Leyla said something at the dinner table.\u2018I want a very pretty hat, please.\u2019Bill cracked up at her solemn tone. But the following evening, he went to the downtown shopping district to buy a pair of mechanical scissors.\u00a0He returned home with a straw hat adorned with flowers and ribbons.\u2018I bought it at Lindsay\u2019s, so if you don\u2019t like it, just return it.\u2019Uncle Bill carelessly added while giving out the hat.\u2018Did you choose this yourself?\u2019\u2018Well, yeah.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s so pretty.\u2019Leyla wore the hat with a bright smile on her lips.Bill had personally purchased several items for Leyla. Still, in most situations, he either requested Madam Mona to buy stuff for her or took Leyla to the store to pick on her own so she could pick what she wanted.Leyla knew very well that her uncle must have struggled to find a suitable hat feminine enough for her.She was aware of how big his love for her was.Flowers were the most exquisite thing in the world to Bill Remmer.He believed the prettiest hat was one with a lot of flowers.\u00a0So he felt sure that he had chosen the most beautiful hat for Leyla.\u201cHey! You should\u2019ve told me that before.\u201d\u00a0Kyle\u2019s face was rinsed with embarrassment as he listened closely.\u00a0\u201cNow I\u2019m feeling like a jerk for mocking that gift!\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a chance to talk. When you saw it, you teased me right away.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou sneaky gluttonous omnivore, you- You\u2019re eating all of my food again. Someday I will ask Dr. Etman to pay for all that food you ate here!\u201dBill roared loudly as he broke through the door. But his expression softened, and the tone of his voice was lighthearted, in contrast to his blunt language.Bill awkwardly chuckled as he saw the flower hat on the table. Kyle was almost pathetically jealous when Leyla flashed a to Bill sweetly.Every man who loved Leyla Lewellin had no option but to embrace his fate as second best in Leyla\u2019s heart.Because the number one person in her life would always be Uncle Bill.Kyle snatched up the fork to console himself. Uncle Bill\u2019s nagging didn\u2019t bother him at all.Bill\u2019s stern lectures sounded tolerable as long as he could have Leyla\u2019s tasty cooking.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Since Uncle Bill returned to work after lunch, Kyle and Leyla were the only ones staying in the cottage.Leyla sat on the patio, as usual, reading her book. Kyle pretended that he was reading while sneaking a peek at her in secret.She was wholly absorbed in her book, except for a brief moment where she had to put it down to enjoy some biscuits.\u2018Damn, I shouldn\u2019t have lent you that novel.\u2019Kyle grinned, despite his deep regret. Leyla might not have known, but he did. How charming her face was when she was concentrating on her book.With those luscious lips, she looked really pretty as she munched on her biscuits.\u2018Should I tell her today?\u2019Kyle placed his book on the floor and fixed a hard gaze on her face. He had planned to wait a little bit longer, but he was beginning to doubt himself.His heart felt like it was going to pop at the very brush of Leyla\u2019s fingertips. Kyle sensed his body heat up as he had a lot of\u00a0guilty\u00a0dreams about her.Moreover, he had lately been concerned about his anxiety. He was afraid that one day, someone would appear to steal her away from him.\u2018So wouldn\u2019t it be better to make a hasty confession?\u2019But the moment Kyle was ready to open his warm mouth, the sound of sluggish horseshoes could be heard from afar. Kyle twisted his head in the direction of the sound and saw Duke Herhardt in his\u00a0equestrian\u00a0uniform coming towards them.Leyla was about to take another bite of her biscuit when she was startled by the unexpected visitor.The Duke stopped his horse in front of the porch\u2019s fence.His glance brushed past Kyle and stuck on Leyla\u2019s flushed face of bewilderment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is there something that matters?\u201dLeyla was quick to answer after cleaning the biscuit crumbs from her lips.With a brief nod, Duke Herhardt turned his gaze towards Kyle.As he looked Kyle in the eyes, his lips curved into a courteous smile. Kyle soon relaxed, letting go of the tension in his shoulders.After expressing his appreciation and regards to Kyle\u2019s father for taking such good care of his grandmother\u2019s health, the duke looked back again at Leyla, \u201cMiss. Lewellin, you can bring the roses in on behalf of Mr. Bill, right?\u201dHe spoke softly. The smile on his lips disappeared.\u201cRoses? Do you mean the roses in the garden?\u201d\u201cJust cut a few roses moderately and bring them to my annex.\u201dThe duke turned away with a slight nod without even giving Leyla a chance to answer.Leyla frowned helplessly as she checked her blouse and skirt, all of which were littered with biscuit crumbs.Although she could clean off the dirt on it, Leyla couldn\u2019t get the shame out of her mind. Only Kyle giggled, watching Leyla rubbing her lips over and over.\u201cStop it. There aren\u2019t any crumbs left on your clothes anymore.\u201d\u201cWhy did he suddenly appear just like that?\u201d\u201cWhy are you so embarrassed? Do you think the duke has never eaten a snack in his life?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Leyla unwittingly rubbed her mouth again.\u201cWhy do you care so much when you always eat messily in front of me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re my friend.\u201d\u201cAnd Duke Herhardt is a stranger. So you don\u2019t need to care about him more than your friend.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true but\u2026. I don\u2019t know. I just felt uncomfortable.\u201d Leyla wrinkled her brows.\u201cWhy? Did something happen?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it, but\u2026 Every time I get close to him it feels very uncomfortable and suffocating. I really don\u2019t like it.\u201d\u201cThen, how do you feel about me? I\u2019m comfortable and nice right?\u201dHis voice tinged with anticipation.Leyla grinned and tucked her hat onto her head. \u201cOf course, Sir Etman.\u201dKyle\u2019s face brightened after he received a satisfactory answer.\u201cAs expected. I knew it. Ah, should I help you with your errand?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a big deal. You should go home now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wait here, then.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, your father will be very upset if he finds out you were hanging out here again. I don\u2019t want to get scolded alongside you. You should focus on your studies.\u201dKyle squirmed hearing Leyla\u2019s logical argument. He wished he could refute, but he couldn\u2019t. He then took a careful look in the direction where the Duke had disappeared.\u2018I\u2019m probably being too sensitive these days.\u2019Duke Herhardt was the only one there. The flawless aristocrat who would make his engagement announcement to the public.\u2018But\u2026..\u2019\u201cLeyla!\u201dKyle called, trying to stop her. Somehow, he was a little worried about Duke Herhardt and Leyla being alone together.Leyla was about to step off the porch, clutching a pair of scissors and a basket in her hands, before she said her goodbyes.\u201cSee you tomorrow, Kyle!\u201d\u2018Please, don\u2019t go.\u2019Swallowing the words he wanted to convey, Kyle just waved his hands.\u2018It\u2019s Duke Herhardt. Nothing bad would happen.\u2019Kyle was repeating those words like a spell, gazing at Leyla, who had crossed the path on the other side.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cDo it again.\u201dMatthias suddenly broke the silence.After a few moments of blinking, Leyla did realize that his words were directed at her.Leyla turned her body to face him with her breath feeling as if it was trapped in her lungs.Matthias sat on the couch near the window, opposite the butler. He was busy reviewing the documents that had stacked up on the table.\u201cWith non-flashy colours.\u201dMatthias spoke slowly with his eyes fixed on the papers he was holding in his hands.\u201cAgain.\u201dHis\u00a0lips cracked into a ridiculously tender smile when he stared at Leyla.Leyla clenched her fists tightly to cope with her accumulated frustration. The roses, which he instructed her to cut down \u2018moderately,\u2019 turned out to be the crux of the problem.Matthias\u2019 eyes became emotionless when Leyla arranged back the flowers.Hessen, the butler, continued his report, and Matthias, who had been listening, replied with some short instructions.The annoyed errand girl\u2019s presence in the room was totally obliterated.\u2018For Uncle Bill.\u2019While chanting the magic words, Leyla quietly left the annex near the river and headed to the garden.\u2018That guy, who torments a person at 2 p.m. in the middle of summer, is well-known as a gentleman.\u2019She was very vocal, expressing her dissatisfaction with his utterly unsuitable reputation.Despite her lack of interest in the mansion\u2019s affairs, Leyla was well aware that the separated annex, as well as the river, belonged to Duke Herhardt.He didn\u2019t have many visitors in his private annex\u2014the number of servants who came and out was also restricted to a few.Leyla first assumed it was because of Claudine that he wanted to display the flowers in his annex.Claudine was going to marry him, so there was a possibility she might have started using the annex as well.Knowing Claudine\u2019s love for colorful flowers, Leyla had cut down the flashy colored roses and brought them to the annex, only to get rejected by him.The shadowless garden appeared in sight when Leyla came out from the woods. She took a bold step and cut the roses with great care once more.\u00a0To meet the Duke\u2019s stressful demands, she decided to pick soft-colored roses this time, the color of roses that she favored.She returned to the annex under the sweltering summer afternoon heat, carrying a basket full of roses.\u2018Damn it, why didn\u2019t he tell me what color he wanted from the beginning?\u2019Instead of spitting out the words she had in mind, Leyla vented her anger at the duke by kicking the stones on the ground.\u2018I hate him.\u2019The cursing words, something that Leyla could never direct at him explicitly, were left behind, along with the stones she deliberately kicked.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla arrived in front of the detached building just when she started to get dizzy from the scorching sun.The idyllic annex next to the dock was designed to appear as if it were half-floating on the river.On the first floor, there was a boat cabin and a kitchen with simple snacks and drinks. While the living space, a bedroom, and a dining hall where he could rest and dine were all situated on the second level.Leyla climbed the outer stairs that led straight to the second floor with the basket of roses in her hands. She ran into the butler and a middle-aged cleaner who were making their way out of the annex.After voicing her farewells to them, Leyla headed to the reception room. Matthias was still sitting in his chair with his eyes closed and his head cocked back.\u2018Should I wait him to wake up?\u2019In the middle of her reverie, Matthias spontaneously opened his eyes.\u00a0 His matted hair framed his forehead, gently covering it.\u201cMy lord, I\u2019ve brought you new roses.\u201dLeyla slightly lifted her flower-filled basket.Matthias didn\u2019t open his mouth and just stared at the cup of whiskey placed in front of him. He\u2019d stripped his horse riding jacket and undone a few buttons on his shirt. His current getup made him look much more defenseless and languorous than usual.\u201cShould I\u2026\u2026 go back again?\u201dLeyla asked carefully with her quivering voice. She really wanted to slap the Duke with the roses if he ordered her back to the garden again.\u201cAre you going to go if I tell you to?\u201dMatthias asked her back. His voice carried a slight drowsiness.\u201cIf I made another mistake, I\u2019d go, but please let me know what color roses you want this time.\u201dYes, my lord.-\u00a0That was the answer she had intended to say, yet her mouth said something else.Matthias, who had been leaning deep against the chair\u2019s back, straightened his stance and sat upright.\u201cSit down.\u201dMatthias gestured to the chair placed on the opposite side of the table with his eyes.\u201cNo, if my lord is satisfied, now I\u2019d\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be your job to arrange the flowers in a vase if you brought them, Miss Lewellin?\u201d\u201cBut my lord, I\u2019m not very good at arranging flowers.\u201d\u201cThen, do you expect me to do it?\u201dMatthias took a brief glance around the room before turning his eyes back to her.Leyla had no trouble figuring out what his slight gesture meant. They were the only ones left in this detached building. That\u2019s why she had no choice but to do something in which she lacked confidence.Leyla took a step forward, a little hesitantly. She carefully sat on the wooden stool in front of the window that faced the river because the seat opposite the Duke was too arduous for her.Matthias moved to his stacks of documents littered around the table when she started trimming the roses.The noise of the scissor blade slashing through the fresh flower stem and the flapping of the document paper was drowned out by the milieu of the silent room.After he finished signing the last document he had reviewed, Matthias suddenly remembered the bird living in his mansion bedroom.The zookeeper\u2019s words- that canary birds were difficult to tame were proven false. The canary in his bedroom was docile towards him and avowedly sang while perching on his finger.The flapping bird on his finger chirped a little as if it were telling about its day. He kept looking at it for a long time, stunned by the fact that such a little bird could sing so beautifully.When Matthias was busily sorting his papers, Leyla quietly went to the bathroom and filled the vase with water.*\u201cDo you like it?\u201dLeyla hesitantly asked as she brought up the roses-filled vase to him.Her words earlier were quickly proven to be true after her one look at the flower arrangement which was showing up to be a total failure.\u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201dMatthias\u2019 tone was not condescending, but it was a little flat.Leyla blinked her eyes in shock, and her face blushed red with embarrassment.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll bring in a skilled maid.\u201d\u201cSit.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cSit, Leyla.\u201dAs Matthias lowered his voice, the atmosphere of the room grew more uncomfortable.\u00a0His fingers were aiming in the precise direction of the sofa across from him.Leyla sat stiffly where he had suggested after putting the disastrous rose vase on a console table near her.Matthias then shifted his focus to the dish covered by the silver dome on the coffee table next to the sofa.\u201cEat.\u201dLeyla opened the dome-shaped cover awkwardly, and she found sandwiches and a glass of lemonade prepared for one person.Matthias kept his eyes on the puzzled Leyla. He planned to give her enough money to pay her work fee after she filled her stomach with those refreshments.Her work result was poor at best, but she had placed a huge amount of time and effort on making it.\u201cThank you, my lord. But I\u2019m fine.\u201dWith shaky hands, Leyla placed the dome dish shut. Her expression, which had previously sparked a brilliant smile in front of Kyle, now seemed disturbed.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to do anything else, I\u2019ll take my leave\u2026.\u201d\u201cLeyla.\u201dLeyla\u00a0was\u00a0stupefied, her\u00a0eyes flickered in slow motion.Matthias\u2019s voice had dwindled to almost a whisper.He took a sip of the icy whisky in front of him. The droplets on the crystal glass\u2019s surface gently trickled down his long-gracile fingers.\u201cDo my words sound like I\u2019m begging you?\u201dMatthias scoffed with his lips reddened, wetting with the cold whiskey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11\u2727 Deep Water \u2727The annex was surrounded by large windows attached on all sides. It presented a magnificent view of the forest and the Schulter river.The good wind circulation in the place also contributed to the coolness of its environment.Today\u2019s weather was much hotter than yesterday, making it difficult to feel any cold shivers.Leyla, however, felt as if chills were running through her spine.She was eager to eat faster and leave, but the food in front of her didn\u2019t seem to lessen in proportion.Leyla couldn\u2019t ingest anything because she had already eaten lunch and a snack. To make it worse, doing an errand in the sweltering sun had made her lose her appetite.Leaning back in his chair, Matthias focused on his task, but she was still having trouble breathing properly.\u2018Damn it, Is he punishing me for my failed errand and flower arrangement?\u2019Leyla couldn\u2019t quit thinking about this as she took another slice of her\u00a0serving-sandwich. If that\u2019s the case, Duke Herhardt had attained his mission.Leyla had the impression that she was being punished.She drank the lemonade swiftly to help her swallow her sandwich before vomiting it out. After wiping the water droplets from her hands with her apron she picked up another slice.Leyla then lowered the edge of her hat to hide her horrified face. But at that precise moment, someone\u2019s long finger suddenly touched the tip of her chin.\u201cLeyla, if you\u2019re a lady\u2026.\u201d\u00a0With his finger, Matthias untied the hat\u2019s ribbon that had been knotted under her chin.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to take off this hat when you\u2019re inside the house.\u201dMatthias removed her straw hat.Leyla was taken aback at his sudden action and scampered from the sofa.\u00a0Her half-eaten sandwich fell and rolled onto the floor.Matthias squinted his eyes, but Leyla\u2019s gaze was solely on her hat.\u201cGi- give it back.\u201dNo longer was Leyla\u2019s voice shaking in fear, but rather, it had turned into rage.\u201cGive it back, please. I\u2019m going to leave now. I want to go home. Return it to me.\u201dMatthias tightly clutched the stolen hat as he had no intention of returning it. Leyla reacted as if she he had been stripped naked even though he had taken only her hat.The rosy flush on her cheeks, spreading down to her neck mesmerized him.Her sensitive skin had reacted easily to her angry emotions.\u201cEat.\u201dMatthias pointed to the plate, which still had two uneaten slices of sandwiches.\u201cEat your food, get your hat, and go home. It\u2019s simple.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d Leyla shook her head and got closer to him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat anything. I can\u2019t eat anymore. I hate it.\u201dLeyla\u2019s terrified eyes were trembling. She couldn\u2019t believe the words were coming out of her mouth.Matthias sat up from his chair, tightening his grip on the hat.\u201c\u2026\u2026You hate it?\u201dThe petrified shadow from his towering figure had cast a pall over her.\u201cI was wrong, so please give it back.\u201dLeyla reached out her hand. She was about to cry.Matthias stared at her eyes that followed his every move, and slowly raised the hat over his head.And, when their eyes confronted each other\u2026Matthias threw it loosely over the window.The wind swept up the hat, and it lightly flew into the river.Leyla was dumbfounded.She gave him a scathing glare and furiously hurried out of the room.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias made his way to the front window, which overlooked the river\u2019s dock.Leyla had arrived there.She began stamping her foot in panic after seeing her hat floating in the water and abruptly took off her apron and glasses, throwing them on the pier.\u2018Is she going to jump into the river just to get that stupid hat?\u2019There\u2019s a look of great delight on Matthias\u2019s face as he was standing behind the window, observing her.Leyla looked to be shaking from her knees down, and she seemed afraid of the water.\u2018Pfft..Is she serious?\u2019Leyla plunged into the river. She took a moment before heading towards her hat.Matthias found Leyla Lewellin interesting as she kept walking even though the water level had now reached her feet, then waist, and chest.He stood still and watched her with his arms folded.Leyla extended her hand to the utmost, but the river stream had driven her hat farther away.When Matthias thought she was about to give up, Leyla\u00a0once again took a broader step closer to the hat.Her hand successfully grabbed its ribbon.\u2018By now, the water level should be higher than her head.\u2019Matthias slowly tilted his head at the same time when Leyla suddenly disappear from the river surface.\u201cAs expected.\u201dMatthias sighed and muttered lightly.That girl drowned precisely at the spot he had predicted.Leyla struggled desperately to raise her head after she was shocked by the sudden, drastic depthening of the water. She was clutching onto her hat, hanging on for her dear life. But the more she struggled, the deeper she was drawn into the river.Matthias took quick strides toward the dock.His other prediction turned out to be true. Leyla Lewellin had jumped into the water despite not knowing how to swim.Matthias stopped at the end of the pier and looked at the floundering Leyla. Her scream gradually faded as she repeatedly emerged-submerged from the surface of the water.\u2018Silly girl, she just needs to eat, get the hat, and go home.\u00a0What a ruckus she caused when she could have done that simple task\u2019Matthias clenched his lips, then dove into the river.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Under the sun, the wooden panels on the dock that touched her cheek were hot.Leyla realized she had safely come out of the water after she felt the vividness of the heat. But the relief was short-lived when pain and fear took its place.Leyla shivered. A deluge of coughs came out of her lips. Even in her current state, still, she refused to let go of the hat she was holding onto.While gasping for air, Matthias stared at Leyla\u2019s blowsy appearance in front of him. The droplets of water from her soaking body had left a dark stain on the wooden panel.Shortly after, Matthias spat out a mixture of shallow breaths and laughed in a low voice.Leyla glared at him.\u201cHow\u2026.. could you\u2026do something like this\u2026.?\u201dED/N: It\u2019s because he\u2019s a total scumbag. Run dear Leyla! >.<She asked with a panting voice and gave Matthias a look seeming to say how nasty he was.But it was the tears in her eyes that attracted his attention.Matthias swept his wet hair away from his forehead and chuckled at her as if she were something entertaining.His laughter even grew louder when Leyla could finally catch her breath.Droplets of water poured down from her wet hair like rain. Leyla raised her upper body off the boiling hardwood floor with her shaking hands.Her eyes were red, but she didn\u2019t cry. Instead, she kept her gaze fixed on Matthias\u2014 the evil man with a friendly smile.Leyla changed her mind after failing to think about what to say, and stood up.Her body lines were strikingly exposed behind the thin, wet clothing. Matthias then looked up at her, as he rested on the wooden floor, posing like he was having a sunbath.He still focused on her trembling shoulders when Leyla wagged her soaked hat at him.The water droplets splashed on his face. Leyla flinched a bit, but she didn\u2019t let it deter her from exacting her revenge.After wearing a hat that was still dripping with water, Leyla flicked back her skirt. She glared at Matthias with provocative eyes.\u201cIs it fun?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m starting to get a little bored.\u201dMatthias said, as he dried his damp face with his hand. His laughter faded soon and returned to his stony look.\u201cHow\u2026 What\u2026 Why\u2026 Are you doing this to me?\u201dDespite being gripped with fear, Leyla didn\u2019t divert her gaze from him.\u201cLeyla, your gratitude.\u201dMatthias slowly rolled his wet shirt\u2019s sleeves up.\u201cYour gratitude to your lifesaver.\u201dHe teased Leyla at random, who was astonished and looked at him in disbelief.\u201cI don\u2019t think any of this would have happened if you hadn\u2019t thrown my hat into the river.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0Matthias furrowed his eyebrows.\u00a0\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened if you had patiently eaten the sandwich and then left.\u201dLeyla frowned as he talked in a far too calm voice to be taken as a joke.\u201cAnd also, if you hadn\u2019t made the foolish decision to jump into the water even though you don\u2019t know how to swim.\u201dMatthias lightly wiped the dripping water from his forehead with the tip of his finger.Uncle Bill. Uncle Bill. Uncle Bill.\u2013 silently recited the incantation many times,\u00a0 Leyla clenched her teeth and hunched her back.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Thank you for saving me, Your Grace.\u201d\u201cAgain.\u201dMatthias scoffed as though he wanted to be certain of her sincerity.\u201cOnce again. Like a lady.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even break into a smile or laugh.\u201cPlease accept my sincere apologies, Your Grace; I\u2019m not like the other aristocratic ladies. I am not even a lady.\u201dMatthias, without expression, quietly looked at Leyla,\u00a0 who leaked out her words of frustration.The water drops on his fingertips fell on her foot.\u201cWhoever you are, I\u2019m still the Duke.\u201dMatthias grinned at her.Leyla grasped her soaked skirt and her body stiffened. Droplets of water from the straw hat\u2019s brim landed on the dock\u2019s wooden floor.\u201cThank you very much for saving my life, Your Grace.\u201dLeyla lowered her head, articulating every word accurately, amid her body trembling to the extent that her teeth clashed against each other. She delivered a courteous bow, much like the graceful lady Matthias had wanted her to be.With a nod of his chin, Matthias gave a pass to her ladylike gratitude.\u2018Leyla Lewellin\u2026. don\u2019t cry.\u2019Leyla tightened her fist.\u2018Don\u2019t cry because of someone like that, please.\u2019After comforting herself, Leyla straightened her waist.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll go back now. I wish you farewell, Your Grace.\u201dFirmly, Leyla turned around, leaving Matthias standing still on the dock.The water droplets dripped from her skirt made a long trail following her footsteps for quite a distance.Her legs were lax, and she was on the verge of falling several times, but Leyla fought tirelessly to not relax her leg muscles.She gritted her teeth and vowed that she wouldn\u2019t fall today. That she\u2019d never been his toy anymore.\u2018Never.\u2019Leyla took to running once she was out of Matthias\u2019 sight.The shade of her hat couldn\u2019t hide her sad eyes because they were too red.\u00a0Leyla ran harder and faster, steadily increasing her speed.One day, she happened to see it by chance.\u00a0How Matthias and Claudine were taking a stroll through the forest.The elegant gentleman was escorting the alluring lady.That scene was like something out of a fairy tale or a courting novel.The wind suddenly blew Claudine\u2019s hat off as they reached the end of the road.Matthias approached the hat slowly, taking it and giving it back to her.His gesture was so composed and elegant.By the time Leyla wondered how he could always move with such elegance, they had already disappeared from her sight.That gentleman had humiliated her today with the same\u00a0graceful gesture he had made that day.Leyla stopped running as she realized the drastic contrast in his attitude towards her and Claudine.Her complexion had turned a whitish color. She stumbled to the grass to vomit up the food she had crammed down her stomach.Her eyes welled up with tears, but she refused to cry.Once her nausea had receded, Leyla went to the shallow stream that flowed through the forest to wash her mouth . She looked much better after resting for a while in the shade of the trees.Leyla headed to the road leading to the cottage while rubbing her lips again with the back of her hand.\u00a0She didn\u2019t have much more energy to sprint, so she trudged along with her legs dragging.Her stockings and skirt were dirtied. But she ignored it as her appearance was already messyWhen the cottage in sight, she summoned all of her remaining strength and kicked the hazel tree fruit off the side of the road.But that roll-down fruit on the ground suddenly realizing her the fatal mistake she had made,\u201cMy glasses\u2026\u201dLeyla\u2019s face crumpled up in a flash.She felt as if the road she was looking back on was so long and winding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His long fingers gently grazed the armrest, slowly tapping along to the beat.Matthias momentarily focused on the shabbily arranged rose vase next to the mantel before turning his gaze out the window.The weather became colder as evening approached. The wind from the river swayed his robe before making its way out into the forest.He reached out and opened the lid of a small silver box that had been placed at his working table.The waltz song ended when he took a cigarette from the box and lit it.The mid-evening of a summer day was monotonous and unexciting.Matthias smoked whilst listening to the following lively string music.\u00a0When the second song stopped, he picked up Leyla\u2019s glasses, which he had carelessly dumped in the tray next to him, and put them on his face.The world he viewed through the lenses made him dizzy. Her vision seemed to be pretty bad.Is that why she frowned all the time?Matthias was suddenly reminded of the little girl who was always looking at him with a grumpy face.Despite her frail look, the scrawny-humble young lady\u2019s eyes were gleaming brightly.The child who was supposed to stay for a brief time in Matthias\u2019 world had grown and matured into a woman.Her skinny features got hidden by the attention her slender face attracted, which was framed by thin gold-rimmed glasses.A fresh and sweet fragrance always seemed to linger on the girl with those shimmering eyes.The scent of a rose.The flower that filled Arvis\u2019s summer garden.Matthias went out to the balcony that stretched out towards the riverside.He let out a long stream of his cigarette smoke while loosely clutching Leyla\u2019s glasses.His shadow lengthened as he casually played throw-catch with her glasses several times.\u201cLeyla.\u201dHe whispered in the humid summer evening.\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dMatthias had to tickle the tip of his tongue to say her annoying name without stuttering.After returning to the reception room, Matthias put her glasses in the console table drawer.The memory of the emerald eyes he had seen through her glasses vanished as soon as he closed the drawer.Matthias then went to the bathroom and took a warm shower. He changed his clothes and waxed his hair.He was back to being the model Duke of Arvis by the time he left the annex to attend dinner.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cWhat if the raven stole it again?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u2026 I hope not.\u201d Leyla shrugged as she sat on the table with a grim face when Bill asked her with some jest.\u201cJust saying. They\u2019re the type of birds that would go nuts if they see something sparkling. Your hairpin, remember?\u201dBill guffawed. The nostalgia he brought up made Leyla\u2019s face stiff; she soon joined him in laughter.Leyla\u2019s thirteenth birthday gift from Uncle Bill was a gleaming hairpin.Chef Mona chose it after researching the types of hairpins that were popular among girls her age.Leyla tried to keep the pin in carefully. It would have remained in her closet forever if Bill hadn\u2019t threatened to throw it out if she didn\u2019t wear it right away.The pin, however, met its inevitable fate on the first day she wore it.The raven took away the pin Leyla had put on the fence while working in the garden.It was an incident that caused Leyla, who adored all birds, to now have a hatred towards ravens.\u201cIf you can\u2019t find it, tell me.\u201dBill strained his voice as if he were requesting.\u201cDon\u2019t make such a face; I can buy you a new one. Okay?\u201d\u201cOkay, uncle.\u201d Leyla flashed a smile. \u201cI will.\u201dShe could answer back because she was sure her glasses were at the dock.\u00a0 She had dropped them there before jumping into the river.Leyla was distraught the following day when she came back to the riverbank. Her glasses were nowhere to be found although she had checked the dock as well as the annex\u2019s surrounding area carefully.Her unfolded apron was still there, but not with her glasses.She suspected the wind had blown it away, but she discarded her assumption because the apron was still on the dock.Leyla was sure she removed her glasses first, followed by her apron. It seemed impossible for her glasses to disappear on their own.No way\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me?Leyla snooped around in front of the annex. But then, she scratched her head as though it was just nonsense.The duke has no reason to take it.With her drooping shoulders, Leyla turned back.She was cursing herself for not returning sooner to pick up her glasses just because she was scared of running into the duke.\u201cIs it him?\u201dLeyla muttered beneath her breath, her gaze fixed on the raven perched on a branch. The bird cocked its head multiple times before flying away into the forest.Leyla clenched her fist and took big strides as she frowned. She would return to her cottage first, have breakfast, then rethink what she would do with a clearer mind.The suspect who stole her glasses seemed to be one of the two.The raven, or the duke.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Kyle smiled and slid the window open when he saw a snow-white pigeon sitting in front of the trellis.\u201cHey, Phoebe.\u201dThe pigeon didn\u2019t flee even though Kyle had reached out his hand and took the letter from its leg.The mountain pigeon named Phoebe was Leyla Lewellin\u2019s personal messenger.Leyla, who had been fascinated by birds since childhood, read a book about the mailing pigeons that could deliver letters. From that moment, she had a great desire to have such a pigeon for herself.\u2018Sure. Go ahead.\u2019Kyle, who had sneered at her dream, never imagined that the day would come until an ancient-like legendary letter carrier suddenly flew through his bedroom window.That tenacious girl, Leyla Lewellin, pulled it off.Despite many failures, Leyla never gave up and eventually could train the bird.It was late spring when Phoebe-a lovely bird with gleaming white feathers and black eyes- first flew into his window two years ago.Kyle opened the window, and the pigeon that had brought Leyla\u2019s letter was staring at him.[Hello, Mr. Etman]Leyla\u2019s letter, delivered by the pigeon that day, only contained one short line long.But Kyle was able to read many other things -Leyla\u2019s excitement celebrating her achievement with her eyes sparkling with joy.\u2013Leyla.My dear friend, Leyla.Delivering-pigeon in a world like today?Kyle chuckled at the absurdity, but he fully understood. Phoebe was, in a way, a telephone for her.The letter-carrying pigeons were very effective in a cottage where there was no telephone.However, Leyla\u2019s messenger delivered heartbreaking news in today\u2019s letter.Kyle, I\u2019ve lost my glasses. I have to look for it, so I can\u2019t go to the library with you. I\u2019m so sorry.Phoebe flew away from the window after finishing her job.Kyle read the letter with a grim expression on his face. He dashed out of his place after sandwiching the folded letter between two thick books on his desk.\u201cKyle Etman! Are you going to Leyla\u2019s place again?\u201dKyle only smiled when his father frowned at the sight of him going down the stairs.\u201cYou need to study, Kyle!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll study at Leyla\u2019s place!\u201dKyle walked out the front door, leaving only a cheerful answer behind.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The shiny chrome bicycle slid off Etman\u2019s house.Kyle frantically peddled his bicycle as he grew more impatient as he passed Arvis territory.He wasn\u2019t interested in visiting the library because he had made that promise purely only to be with her.And now, Kyle was really worried.Those were the glasses she bought with her diligent work.His heart ached as he thought of Leyla, the foolish girl who saved and earned money by making jam and selling it solely because she was afraid of becoming a burden to Uncle Bill.\u201cUh, Kyle?\u201dLeyla, who was hanging the laundry, seemed shocked when the silver bicycle yelped to a stop.\u201cHey, did you find your glasses?\u201d\u201cNo. Not yet.\u201dLeyla\u2019s face went glum.\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a new one!\u201dKyle blurted out because he didn\u2019t want to see the unhappy Leyla.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Kyle. You? Why?\u201dLeyla responded with a quizzical look in her eyes.Kyle had just remembered what he\u2019d said. He\u2019d let his emotions get the better of him, and he\u2019d forgotten what kind of person she was.\u201cThank you, Kyle, but I can\u2019t.\u201dLeyla smiled softly to camouflage his shame.\u201cI want to find my glasses.\u201dHer eyes were firm, in contrast to her smiling lips.Kyle was cognizant of those eyes.It was the eyes of Leyla Lewellin, the tenacious woman who refused to give up no matter what.\u201cI\u2019ll find it for sure.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla had been rummaging through the forest for days. Kyle, the doctor\u2019s son, also helped her.Matthias pretended not to notice their admirable endeavors. Otherwise, it was pretty interesting for him to watch them sift through the innocent bird nests.Does she really don\u2019t know, or is she pretending not to know?Matthias halted in his steps as he ascended the annex stairs and eyed the vast forest\u2019s landscape along the river.He was about to get bored of their folly. He was also growing tired of coming to this place over the past few days, only to chortle at their futile questing efforts amid his packed schedule.Matthias went up the stairs, sweeping his hair back, which had become messy thanks to the heavy wind. Hessen, who followed him behind, cautiously opened the door and took a step back after.Matthias walked into the reception room. He leaned against the window, viewing the forest instead of sitting on the couch.\u201cMarquis Lindman will arrive today around noon.\u201d\u201cRiette? His arrival is sooner than planned.\u201d\u201cThe Duchess has instructed me to pay careful attention to the luncheon. She invited you to come if you didn\u2019t have any other appointments.\u201d\u201cSure. I will.\u201dThe chiffon curtains that enclosed half the window slowly inflated when a gust of wind blew in.Matthias\u2019 eyes narrowed when the curtain flattened, and he saw the road lit up by the lucid sunshine.Leyla stood at the road\u2019s edge, under the shade of a tree. She wandered around there with her hands clenched together.Perhaps she isn\u2019t a knucklehead.Matthias silently grinned and returned his attention to Hessen\u2019s reports while that middle-aged maid poured him a glass of cool lemon water.The sound of ice clattering in the glass was satisfying to hear.The maid and the butler left the room after finishing their job. Matthias watched the scenery again outside the window with the long-necked glass cup in his hand.Leyla began walking towards the river after the maid and butler were fully out of sight.The tranquil annex\u2019s doorbell rang not long after.And Matthias slowly rose from his seat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13\u2727 A Night Under the Moonlit \u2727Unlike the day she left the annex with anger, the Leyla right now was looking like a gentle and naive young lady.Matthias eyed the \u2018gentle\u2019 Leyla while daintily leaning on the couch.\u201cI sincerely apologise for this sudden discourtesy, your grace.\u201dLeyla hesitated before speaking and kept her head down to avoid his eyes. Her long, thick eyelashes seemed to be the reason why she left a gentle impression when she lowered her eyes.\u201cPardon me, but I\u2019d like to ask you something.\u201dLeyla finally managed to open her lips after spending several seconds wetting them. But the phone started ringing at that precise moment.Matthias slowly rose to his feet, passing by her to pick up the phone. It seemed to be a business call about a complex deal he needed to check up on.Leyla looked a bit surprised when she saw him speaking on the phone. Matthias steered the conversation with finesse. Even with his fleeting smiles and courteous way of talking, she could tell that he held an aura of power and dignity that overwhelmed the person on the other end of the line. He appeared to be the perfect Duke of Arvis, whom everybody admired.\u2018No way.\u2019She sighed. Her suspicion that a man like him had stolen her glasses sounded ludicrous right now.\u2018I feel like I\u2019m doing something useless\u2026.. Then was the culprit the raven?\u2019While counting how many ravens\u2019 nests there might be in the forest, Leyla politely excused herself to the duke, who was on the phone and was about to leave.\u201cWait.\u201dMatthias unexpectedly turned to her while still holding the phone\u2019s mouthpiece. His short order sounded like it was someone else\u2019s. His voice was nothing like that of the great Duke of Arvis she had heard while he was on the phone.Leyla froze. Matthias then refocused on his vocation again as if nothing had happened.She found another trait in Matthias von Herhardt while watching him.His eyes remained calm even though he was having a professional talk. His smile was relaxed as well. His stance, on the other hand, was uniformly graceful and straight.\u00a0Even if the phone caller couldn\u2019t see him, Matthias maintained his posture as though it were a natural trait of his body and Leyla felt a twinge of admiration.Matthias headed to the front of the table after keeping the call on hold a few more minutes and scribbled something down.Leyla grasped her wriggling hands behind her back nervously. By the time she thought he had forgotten about her presence, Matthias\u2019s attention finally turned to her.\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to ask.\u201dMatthias\u2019s gaze made her anxious, so Leyla slowly lowered her eyes.\u201cAh\u2026.. The thing is, my glasses. I was wondering, if you saw my glasses at the dock\u2026..on the day I jumped into the river.\u201d\u201cWell. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen it\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Matthias rose slowly from his seat and began approaching her.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s likely I hid it.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026.. What?\u201dLeyla\u2019s head shot up in shock.\u201cMy glasses. Did you really hide it?\u201d\u201cWhat are your thoughts?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve done something like that.\u201dLeyla answered with a slight frown.\u201cWhy?\u201dMatthias cocked his head, amusement clear on his face. His black hair, which swayed gently on his forehead, resembled a raven\u2019s feather.\u201cBecause\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s rude.\u201dLeyla curled up her feet, trying not to take a step back. She summoned the courage to come here after days of digging the ravens\u2019 nests with Kyle.Despite her dislike for the duke, she could at least communicate with him, unlike the ravens. Leyla felt like it would be better to quickly eliminate either one of the two suspects, the crow or the duke.\u00a0But she wasn\u2019t sure now.Leyla wasn\u2019t sure whether the duke, whose enigmatic remarks only added to her confusion, was really a person she could communicate with.For a lengthy moment, they stared into each other\u2019s eyes without saying a word. The moment would have lasted a little longer if the butler hadn\u2019t returned to the annex with an urgent telegram and letter.With a flush on her cheeks, Leyla made her way towards the window.Matthias cast an abstruse glance her way after a low-key talk with the butler. Leyla couldn\u2019t tell for sure because her glasses were missing, but his red lips seemed to be subtly curved.\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201dLeyla opened her mouth with all the bravery she could muster, but Matthias quickly cut her off by lifting his chin towards the door.It was a succinct yet icy gesture, indicating he left no room for Leyla Lewellin.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cA bird. Why has your hobby become so odd all of a sudden?\u201dRiette, Matthias\u2019 cousin, had a confused smile as he looked at the yellow bird inside the beautiful golden cage.\u201cAre you going to raise a bird and shoot it yourself?\u201dThe people gathered in the mansion suite reception room laughed at Riette\u2019s jokes. Matthias let out a brief chuckle too, but his responses went unheard. Riette then inserted a couple more comedic phrases, along with the servants who came in with the champagne in their hands.A grand dinner was being served at the Herhardts\u2019 residence to celebrate the reunion of all the families who had spent the summer together.\u00a0Matthias, Claudine, Riette, and other aristocrats of similar ages had moved to the reception area after finishing their meal.They could rest in the master suite room, which Matthias only used, thanks to Claudine\u2019s special request. Matthias, who never shared his private space, tended to be very accommodating to his fiance as he granted her his godly permission.The relatives almost unanimously confirmed Matthias and Claudine\u2019s marriage. It was plain why Countess Brandt came to Arvis every year with her only daughter and why the Herhardt family presented such a warm welcome to them whenever they visited their house.None of the relatives were shocked by their marriage announcement.It was as though one of nature\u2019s dreams had come true. They would have been much more taken aback if Matthias had selected a different woman.\u201cThat bird doesn\u2019t seem to know Duke Herhardt\u2019s real personality.\u201dThe canary bird flew out of the open cage and landed on Matthias\u2019 shoulder, causing Riette to crack up laughing.\u201cA bird in love with the master of bird hunting. Should I describe this as calvish or pitiful?\u201dMatthias reached out his hand, and the bird hopped over his finger.\u201cClaudine, what do you think?\u201dFollowing Riette\u2019s question, everyone\u2019s eyes were drawn to Claudine.\u201cWell. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0Claudine cast a look at Matthias\u2019s finger, which was decorated with a singing yellow bird.\u00a0\u201cYou could call it a calvish but pitiful bird.\u201dHer compromise elicited yet another explosion of laughter.The mood in the reception room was warm and friendly since they hadn\u2019t seen each other in many years.The names everyone knew, the world everyone shared, the same interests everyone had. It was an elite society where only they were permitted to join.\u201cThat bird, what\u2019s its name?\u201d\u00a0Claudine asked, wanting to know, in a pleasant tone.\u00a0\u201cWould you like me to name it for you if you don\u2019t have one for it yet?\u201dMatthias turned his eyes to Claudine and smiled at her.\u201cIt\u2019s not worth your effort, my lady.\u201dHis expression seemed to be the same as before, but it somehow had a subtle difference about it.\u201cA bird is just a bird.\u201dIn contrast to his tender gaze to the singing bird on his fingers, his answer was cold and unfeeling.\u201cSuch a stupid poor bird.\u201d Riette sighed audibly, voicing his sympathy for the bird.\u201cThat bird loves a hunter who doesn\u2019t allow it to have its own name!\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The group of people who had been laughing and joking over the champagne resided in the suite until late at night.Matthias left the mansion for a night stroll alone, passing by the servants who had come in to tidy up the reception room.\u00a0\u00a0No more smiles on his lips; his face was as quiet as the night sky.It was time to check the trap he laid.She wasn\u2019t a fool and must have noticed, but Matthias knew she wouldn\u2019t give up.That\u2019s why he was confident she\u2019d be caught.Matthias walked through the rose garden. The wind grew colder as he got closer to the river and then through the forest. His steps came to a halt in front of the riverside annex.The full moon shone a pure white light.Matthias entered the annex\u2019s reception room and approached the console table, opening the drawer.\u00a0The neatly placed glasses glinted in the light of the moon.He laid his sleepy body on the couch, holding the glasses as though it were his canary.What do I want from the bait I\u2019ve set up?As he looked at the glasses, Matthias pondered something. He was having trouble coming up with an answer but he wasn\u2019t impatient.He believed he would find out once he apprehended her.The night grew deeper as he repeatedly threw the glasses up and down.It was a moonlit night.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was no less than a crazy act.Leyla was really conscious. No one in their right state of mind would dare to sneak into the duke\u2019s annex.\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s just sleep.\u201dLeyla flung herself into the bunk after circling the room. She swaddled herself in a thin blanket and squeezed her eyes firmly.\u201cMy glasses\u2026\u201dYet, she didn\u2019t get to sleep. Leyla felt certain in her action. Whereas she realized she was silly, she nevertheless kept on doing so.She needed to get her glasses.Leyla sprang to her feet. She speculated that Matthias could not have taken it to his mansion, so she believed her glasses were likely in the annex.\u201cYes. It\u2019s all right.\u201dWith a compelling murmur to no one but her own self, Leyla opened the door.\u00a0The cottage was shrouded with inky blackness. No other noise could be heard but for Uncle Bill\u2019s snoring.She took up a lace shawl that dangled on the wall and rushed out of the cabin.\u00a0\u00a0Whenever she had second thoughts, Leyla recalled all the fruits she had picked and all the jam she had cooked to afford the purchase of those glasses.\u201cAfter all, it\u2019s my glasses.\u201dLeyla eased her fear by talking to herself as she saw the glittering Schulter River in the distance. Her light blonde hair, which hung down to her waist, wafted along with the fast-paced movement of her steps.But the more she learned about it, the more she realized Duke Herhardt was a strange person.Somehow, Leyla had an epiphany as she walked down the dock walkway linking to the annex.\u2018Is he a lover of sparkly stuff like the raven?\u2019Amidst her questioning mixed with vexation, Leyla finally arrived in front of the annex, where her glasses were hidden.She noticed she was still in her pajamas, but she brushed it off since it was the middle of the night and nobody was around to see her.Lelya inhaled deeply as she took a step forward.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Exactly as he had expected.Once again, the actions of Leyla Lewellin didn\u2019t deviate from Matthias\u2019 expectations.Matthias\u2019s breath became more pronounced and deliberate when he heard the footsteps ascending the stairs get closer.Leyla had climbed in through the hallway window after wandering outside for a long time, even though he had left the door remaining open for easier entry.She was a girl who never diverged from his expectations, but she always left him an impression.\u00a0Matthias lay still on the sofa, letting her feet move closer.Leyla\u2019s sigh of relief came after she heard the hardwood floor creak smoothly.Matthias scoffed silently and lowered his gaze from the ceiling.It didn\u2019t take long until Leyla entered the reception room. She eyed her surroundings stiffly, then she took a careful step forward and began to inspect places near the window.Matthias\u2019s eyes, already accustomed to the darkness, instantly captured her petite figure. The moonlight that flowed in through the window shone upon her, who stood in front of the table.By the time Matthias narrowed his eyes, Leyla had moved to her following location, the cabinet.The skirt wrapped around her slender calves shook along with her footsteps. The sheer white dress made of a see-through fabric exposed her torso line and made her seem like she was in her nightgown.\u2018What do I want from the bait I\u2019ve set up?\u2019Matthias caressed the glasses\u2019 delicate frame with his fingertips. His consciousness was rendered clear by its cold, smooth texture. Meanwhile, Leyla had shifted to the front of the console table, which was angled opposite his sofa.Matthias glanced over her moonlight-illuminated back.\u2018That woman\u2019.He now got the answers he was searching for.The reason for his unending patience in waiting when setting up this ridiculous trap.To be able to have that woman.That woman, Leyla Lewellin, who was no longer a little girl.\u201cAre you looking for this?\u201dMatthias broke the silence and shook the glasses in his hand slowly.Leyla immediately turned around when she was about to open the console table\u2019s drawer. She seemed to be on the brink of fainting.She stumbled backward, with her shaking hands covering her mouth.Matthias gradually lifted himself.\u00a0The moonlight glistened across his profile, which was hidden in the shadows all along, as he sat, leaning against the sofa.The two people\u2019s gazes collided in the moonlit night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14\u2727 Desirable Woman \u2727Matthias sighted Leyla, who was shaking all over in fear.Since she was a little girl, nothing had changed about her. Though she often pretended to put on a show of bravery, she was a lily-livered who was always easily frightened.Matthias kept walking towards her while his mind was running over the memories of the young girl he remembered.He stopped before her with a few paces left in between when he noticed Leyla\u2019s eyes locking on his outstretched hand. To the glasses clutched in his hand.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026.. sorry.\u201dLeyla opened her mouth just somewhat. She apologized politely enough though her eyes were overflowing with indignation.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be here. I am so sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t have it? Did you think it was okay to sneak in?\u201dMatthias cocked his head to confront her. Leyla\u2019s eyes grew redder with each blink, but she stood still and unwavering, whereas she seemed to be about to tear up.\u201cLike\u2026 a thief?\u201dHe sneered lowly, rendering Leyla\u2019s beetroot-red cheeks plainly visible even in the dark.\u201cI only tried to get what was rightfully mine.\u201d\u201cAh. This?\u201dLeyla\u2019s face flushed even more as Matthias lifted her glasses. Her ears were flaming red as well, as he looked at her face more closely.\u201cYes.\u201dShe fearlessly answered his question without flinching.\u201cMy glasses that you hid.\u201d\u2018Even though you\u2019re trembling that much.\u2019Matthias sauntered towards the window. It was the same window where he had thrown her hat over, but this time he had her glasses in his grip.\u201cD-Don\u2019t\u2026 !\u201dStupefied. Leyla\u2019s face started to get paler and she chased after him.\u201cGive it back! Please!\u201dThe lace shawl that had been draped over her shoulder fell to the floor. Leyla heaved her arms to cover her cleavage, which was revealed beneath her v-neck pajamas.\u201cIsn\u2019t it hilarious that you\u2019re making a fuss over your sleepwear when you\u2019ve already seen my whole body?\u201dLeyla\u2019s blush flushed down to the nape of her neck at his flout.\u201c\u2026That. That couldn\u2019t be helped!\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I wanted, but I had no choi-\u201c\u201cDid you think I wanted it?\u201d\u201cWhat? No\u2026.. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201dLeyla quickly grabbed the shawl and wrapped it around her shoulders and chest. At that sight, Matthias softly chuckled, finding her half-kayoed expression was somewhat comedic-gold.\u201cWhy are you now behaving like a lady? You said that you weren\u2019t a lady.\u201d\u201c\u2026.. Regardless of who I am, you\u2019re still a nobleman.\u201dMatthias chuckled some more, looking at her arrogant yet respectful refusal to succumb to his words.\u201cWell.\u201d\u00a0Matthias dropped his tone a little lower as his laughter subsided,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know, Leyla. Maybe I\u2019m not a nobleman.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026No!\u201d Leyla exclaimed urgently as she tightly bound the end of her shawl. \u201cYou\u2019re a nobleman!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes! You\u2019re the greatest nobleman in the Berg Empire!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re quite generous in appraising me.\u201d\u201cEveryone who knows you would think that.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that different from your thoughts?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 No.\u201dYes!Although Leyla wanted, to be frank, she kept her innermost thoughts secret by vigorously shaking her head.\u201cI don\u2019t think that way\u2026\u201dOnly for tonight, Leyla decided to sell her soul for her glasses.\u201cSo, your grace, please give it back to me.\u201dShe was about to cry because she was too upset, but Leyla persuaded herself not to.\u201cIt\u2019s very important and precious to me.\u201dShe begged him again, bowing her head and suffering the humiliation.Leyla wanted to stomp on all the stones in the forest to vent her anger. But she was mindful of how much she was actually at a disadvantage in this situation.If the duke courted the matter further, he could\u2019ve turned her into a criminal or he could\u2019ve thrown her glasses out the window into the river.His simple acts, no matter which one, were both fatal to her.So, Leyla had to put up with it.Matthias marched up to her. He began throwing the glasses up, and the gap between them closed.\u00a0Soon, they were at a near enough distance, where they could sense each other\u2019s body temperature.Leyla batted her eyes in surprise when Matthias glanced down at her with his deep and placid eyes.His eyes resembled a bottomless river.A vast and icy river that had devoured her on that sunny afternoon when all her misfortune began.Leyla was deep in thoughts as her previously blurry vision became crystal-clear all of a sudden. Matthias had put her glasses on her face. His palms that were covering her cheeks were so smooth and warm, like sand that had been steamed by the sun.Just his face could be seen in contrast with the rest of his surroundings that were veiled in the darkness.Leyla was restless. She attempted to shun his eyes, but Matthias held her face by giving some strength into his caressing hands.Why\u2026..?She wanted to ask him that, before a peculiar and terrifying feeling suddenly surged through her when his long fingers started to fondle the tip of her lips.Calmly, Matthias\u2019 fingers come to rest between the crease of Leyla\u2019s lip. His thrilling sigh tickled her forehead.Leyla could feel his breath tasted hot and had a sweet scent, same as the touch of his fingers.Matthias locked his raven\u2019s blue eyes on her.Slowly but surely, he started to nuzzle the delicate skin of her wet bottom lip. In a sensual motion, he moved his finger in and out of her mouth until the tips of his trim nails were nearly touching her lower white teeth.Leyla seemed to have long forgotten how to flee. Innocently froze, enduring both his gaze and touch.Matthias tardily closed his eyes. His insane, illogical conduct almost brought Leyla to tears. The hands that had embraced her cheeks tenderly strengthened, but then, Matthias loosened his hold and let her go.Eventually, his hands freed her.Leyla lost her footing and staggered backward.\u00a0Her body trembled violently as she struggled to breathe.Matthias opened his crystalline-azure eyes; a pair of stunning eyes that had caused her shame and dread.He looked at Leyla for quite some time, then gave a silent order.\u201cGet out\u2026.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla had no recollection of what had happened after she left the annex.After saying her goodbyes, she turned around and walked out. All of her memories of that time seemed hazy.Only after she heard the grass bugs sing, felt the cold breeze blowing against her body, and saw her silhouette walking under the moonlight, Leyla did realize she had reached the end of the forest path.Still bewildered, Leyla made her way to the cottage.\u00a0She didn\u2019t lash out at the stones and tree branches, nor did she run away.She literally walked.With her slower-than-usual stride, as light as a ghost on a stroll.Leyla pumped the water from a spigot in the corner of her yard and washed her face. She unconsciously rubbed her lips until they were swollen and reddish. And though her skin had already peeled off, the water couldn\u2019t clean the unpleasant feeling that still lingered on her mouth.Leyla\u2019s face, shawl, and the front of her nightgown were all soaked with cold water when she returned to her room. Without thinking of drying them, she sat on her bed, perched up on edge.Leyla didn\u2019t know what she had been through, but she was sure of one thing.That she didn\u2019t want to see him ever again.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The canary that had been sitting peacefully in its cage flew towards Matthias when he clicked his fingertips.Matthias leaned back against the windowsill and extended his hands towards the bird.\u00a0The canary perched naturally on his finger.It\u2019s wings needed to be trimmed a bit as it had grown long enough to be able to fly a little distance. But Matthias didn\u2019t feel the need to cut it as short as he did before.As he listened to the canary singing, Matthias lowered his gaze and peered out the window.The gardener, Bill Remmer, was in the thick of his job of weeding the garden. But for several days, he didn\u2019t see Leyla Lewellin, which was strange, since she was usually there to help him out.She had been absent and nowhere to be seen after the night she went looking for her glasses.But, Matthias was conscious that Leyla began to avoid him like the plague.After returning the canary to its cage, Matthias clothed himself in a carmine red hunting jacket.He desired her.Matthias came to realize what this feeling was called.That woman, Leyla Lewellin. He craved her.There was no longer any need to deny that she had grown up to be a beautiful woman.\u00a0Beautiful enough to pique a man\u2019s interest.But Matthias knew, this form of desire was supposed to fade quickly.So, he wondered.Did she need to leave a stain on his life just to satisfy that desire?Matthias replayed the events of that night in his mind. About the woman in front of him, Leyla. And he concluded.No.Leyla Lewellin wasn\u2019t a woman worth his desire to be kept in his palm.Then why.That night, he let Leyla go.Still, if she were to behave in this way after he had set her free, then he would have no choice.\u201cI\u2019ve prepared for your hunting session, master.\u201dHessen approached politely. Matthias nodded, took the gun Hessen had given him, and exited the room.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cDid something happen?\u201dKyle asked, a little concernedly.Leyla, who was affixing the well-dried flower into her diary with glue, lifted her head and faced him calmly.\u201cNo.\u201d She said, with a lively voice as usual. \u201cDo I seem that way?\u201dLeyla dropped her voice and whispered, narrowing her eyes.Kyle was mystified to see her face was red as if something hot had been put on her neck and burnt her skin.\u201cYou\u2019ve been cooped up in the cottage for a few days now. That\u2019s strange.\u201dKyle shrugged.Leyla blinked in a daze a couple of times before showing her usual cheerful smile. Her lips curved into a faint grin and her eyes twinkled brightly.\u201cYou should go out more now that you\u2019ve found your glasses. But what you\u2019re doing right now is the polar opposite.\u201dKyle rested his chin on his hand while staring at Leyla. But she only laughed a little and began carefully writing down the locations and characteristics of the flower petals she had found in her diary.Leyla would usually sketch and paste unknown flower petals onto her notebook before going to the library to look up their names.Kyle often accompanied her simply to watch her expression when she discovered the names of the flowers.She was a young woman who was intrigued by the names of all the birds and flowers in the world and Kyle was a huge lover of her geekiness.Her face looked small in the gleam of the reading glasses she had recently gotten back. Leyla made sure that she didn\u2019t press the notebook hard with a blotter because she didn\u2019t want the ink to smudge.\u201cDo you want to take a walk? Let\u2019s go to that tree you like, the one right in front of the river.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201dLeyla replied immediately right after Kyle ended his sentence.\u201cDidn\u2019t you used to go there all the time?\u00a0 What happened? Did you see something scary in the woods again?\u201d\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t like that. I can\u2019t go into the forest today anyways.\u201d\u201cHow come? Ah, is it the duke\u2019s hunting day today?\u201dAfter moving the book to the far end of the table, Leyla nodded. Soon after, she could hear a distant thunderous sound of horses\u2019 footsteps coming from a distance.\u201cWow. That\u2019s cool.\u201dKyle dashed in front of the window, admiring Duke Herhardt and his group of men as they headed to enter the forest through a road beside the cottage.The five young men were riding their horses with the greyhounds at the lead.Kyle and Leyla both looked out the window. The duke was mounted on a lustrous horse today, with fur that was the color of a pitch-soaked wood barrel. His red jacket and shining shotgun also attracted her eyes.Kyle suddenly changed his expression after admiring the duke.\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, Leyla. I\u2019m not an animal hunter. I\u2019m not going to hunt for the remainder of my life.\u201dAt that moment, Duke Herhadt also turned his head towards the cottage. Leyla quickly jumped away from the window even though she was already hidden behind the curtains.She had spent the past ten days trying to evade him. She didn\u2019t go by the river, and she didn\u2019t even go for a walk in the woods.Leyla felt sorry for uncle Bill, who had recently gone out to handle the garden by himself. She only helped him while the duke was away from the estate and quickly left the garden when he returned.Leyla planned to endure this discomfort until the end of summer. By the time autumn would land, Matthias would have already been engaged and would be moving to the capital. Then Arvis would regain his previous state of tranquility.\u201cLayla, are you feeling under the weather? Do you want to come over to my place?\u201d Kyle asked while looking at Leyla\u2019s pallid countenance.\u201cNo, Kyle. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u00a0Leyla leaned back in her chair which faced the dinner table and shook her head. \u201cThe hunt will end tonight, anyways.\u201dBang!Another gunshots rang out the moment she thoughtlessly opened her journal.\u00a0The sound was then followed by the dogs barking and the horses bolting.Leyla flipped her book\u2019s pages, which she couldn\u2019t read properly with her fist clenched.She felt compelled to go to the woods this evening.Some unfortunate birds had to be buried.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15\u2727 Friendly Hunting \u2727The forest, which had been swept through by a bloody activity, had a calmer atmosphere than usual.Matthias stopped his horse in the middle of a wide road that ran between the woods after dispatching his group first.Tangled bangs draped down his forehead when he removed his hat. The hunt today was a lot of fun. Matthias was able to hit every target he set out for and each moment was as thrilling as ever. But one bird that had desperately attempted to fly away made him unsatisfied.Matthias slowly pulled the reins and spun the horse in the direction of the cottage. When the hunt was over, the little girl who lived by the hunting grounds would come out into the forest crying and bury all the dead birds. It was her ridiculous habit that he still remembered very clearly.So, what about that woman now, who\u2019s no longer a child?The curious Matthias pointed his rifle at a tiny bird sitting on the branch\u2019s rim, and\u2026Bang!With\u00a0his aimed shot hitting the target, the little bird fell to the ground.Matthias left behind the prey he had killed and slowly motioned his horse to advance.Once.And then once again.He was pointing and shooting.The birds fell one by one covered in blood, adorning the long path Matthias walked through into the deep evening forest.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u2018I hate him!\u2019Leyla dug a hole and said those words over and over as she buried the dead bird.\u2018I hate his heinous pastime. I really hate it.\u2019Leyla swallowed her sadness while wiping her sweaty forehead. She felt she was almost there until she spotted another bloody bird lying down only a few meters away.Leyla picked up her shovel again and stepped closer to that poor bird. She didn\u2019t want to blame the act of killing an animal. Uncle Bill hunted for food as well and she also bred livestock.\u00a0 But she\u00a0didn\u2019t understand why the duke killed just for entertainment and then abandoned his hunt behind.When is this summer going to end?As she buried another bird-a beautiful ruby-crowned kinglet with a pretty feather\u2019s pattern-Leyla sighed deeply, hoping that her favorite season would soon come to an end.Leyla had already entered deep into the evening forest when she suddenly sensed something strange.Duke Herhardt loved hunting. And every time, Leyla buried the birds he had killed. But she\u00a0had no memory of making the tomb of birds in a row the way she did now, as if she was setting down a path made up of bird carcasses.Should I go back now?Leyla\u2019s face winced as she sensed something ominous. The sheltering sky above her head was painted in a crimson color. She turned her eyes away from the setting sun and gazed down behind a clump of shrubs.And, she saw him.Duke Herhardt was sitting on the trump of the chopped oak. He was silently watching her.Leyla\u2019s mind turned blank, and she almost stumbled.With a laid-back attitude, he greeted her.\u201cHello, Leyla.\u201dMatthias\u2019s voice sounded luscious.As velvety as the birds\u2019 feathers he had shot and killed.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cBy the way, Matthias is quite late. I think those who went with him are already back. \u201cElysee von Herhardt squinted her eyes while putting her card on the table. She was getting bored with the card game she was playing. She wanted to start dinner early, but her son, Matthias, hadn\u2019t returned from the hunting grounds yet.\u201cHe had said he\u2019d go for a walk in the forest before.\u201dClaudine, who didn\u2019t have the look of someone who had just lost a game, answered her with a friendly smile.The ladies, very much aware that she\u2019d lost the card game on purpose, looked at Claudine with admiring smiles, seeing the next Duchess of Arvis was a well-educated lady with classy manners. Claudine also knew very well that she was well-liked and highly praised among those aristocratic ladies.\u201cMatthias surely has a thing for that forest.\u201dElysee lightly rang the bell the maids rushed over and started setting the table.The idle ladies clustered around the reception table to chat and enjoy simple snacks. They talked about various stories, of course, with all its formalities that entailed.\u201cOh, Claudine. Why don\u2019t you invite your friends over and throw a party?\u201d\u201cMe? In the Arvis manor?\u201dClaudine\u2019s eyes widened as she heard Elysee\u2019s suggestion.\u201cYou will get bored if you deal with us every day. Don\u2019t you need to change your pattern a little?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m not bored. Really.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so startled? I was just kidding, Claudine.\u201dIt was tough to fathom that Elysee was the mother of an engaged son because her relaxed, smiling face was so youthful yet beautiful. Matthias, her only son, was endowed with her loveliness.The people of the empire admired Duchess Elysee von Herhardt for her timeless beauty. Yet, she was still unable to capture her husband\u2019s affection.Claudine believed that women obsessed with love were ridiculous as she learned of Elysee\u2019s tragic love life.Matthias\u2019s father, like every other man in his position, had a mistress. However, he didn\u2019t make life difficult for his successor by taking in an illegitimate child.Even though they didn\u2019t love each other, the Duke and Duchess of Arvis respected each other and carried out their responsibilities faithfully. They acted their part in the household perfectly. They remained calm and untainted by selfish greed or desire.So Claudine aspired to live a similar life like them with Matthias.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Claudine; you\u2019re never under any pressure. Consider it as a rehearsal. If the mansion is filled with young people, we\u2019ll have much more fun.\u201dElysee\u2019s smile had brightened vastly. \u201cDon\u2019t you think the same as well, ladies?\u201dBut, all in the room were aware that her question was not intended for soliciting their feedback.\u201cThe duchess is very generous and thoughtful.\u201dCountess Brandt complimented the soon-to-be-mother-in-law of her daughter. Other ladies soon joined in, making praising noises with some exaggeration sprinkled on top.Claudine sheepishly smiled as she bowed her head softly. She was thinking about the names of people she had liked to invite until now when her eyes drew her attention to the window.The moment she saw the forest beyond the dusk garden, she instantly thought of that girl: Leyla Lewellin. The poor orphan girl who lived in that forest.She was well-mannered and knew where she belonged even though she was a little arrogant at times.\u201cDo you mind if I invite Leyla?\u201dThe brow of every lady in the room was raised upon hearing Claudine\u2019s cheerful question.\u201cDo you mean the gardener\u2019s orphan girl?\u201d\u201cYes. That girl, Leyla Lewellin.\u201d\u201cClaudine, wait.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure that poor girl had never been to a formal party before.\u201d Claudine seemed unaffected by Countess Brandt\u2019s embarrassment-filled glare. \u201cI want Leyla to have an experience she will never forget.\u201dShe said those intimidating words without losing her ladylike courtesy and dignity.\u201cCome to think of it, what\u2019ve you said makes sense.\u201dDuchess Norma Catarina von Herhardt, who had been watching Claudine the whole time, smiled contentedly.\u201cThen, do as you please, Claudine.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Looking back to the path of buried birds Leyla shifted her eyes. There was only one answer she could come to as she turned her head and watched the duke.-A psycho.There were no other words to describe him.The sweat was spilling from her muddy gloves. Her heart began to pound with anger and fear.\u2018Let\u2019s get out of here.\u2019Leyla was about to run to the cottage the moment she heard his voice.\u201cLeyla.\u201dMatthias\u2019 face remained impassive as he pronounced her name slowly.\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dAfter he called her name like a song\u2019s lyrics,\u00a0Leyla straightened her back by using the shovel in her hand as a cane. She squeezed her lips closed and tight, flexing both of her legs\u2019 muscles.She realized, it was useless to run. The duke could quickly catch her if he set his mind to it.The sound of woodland leaves swaying in the wind surfaced, but there was nothing but silence for them. Leyla raised her twitching eyes and glared at him.\u201cKeep going.\u201dMatthias was the first person who breached the silence.\u201cYou should get on with your job.\u201dOn the side of the bushes that he pointed to with his eyes, a bird that seemed to be the game of his last chase, lay dead.Leyla trudged up to the bird and saw red thread tied to the bird\u2019s bleeding ankle.\u00a0 It was the same thread she had tied to the baby birds who had hatched near the Schulter River last year.Without saying a word, Leyla buried the bird in a pit she dug herself. Because of that beautiful bird\u2019s slayer, she had become used to doing all of this.\u201cThat thread. Did you tie it?\u201dMatthias asked as he sat there watching.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy.\u201d\u201cThe birds that leave their nests to migrate \u2026 I wanted to know when they will come back.\u201d Answered Leyla while patting the soil. \u201cThis is not the kind of reunion I was hoping for.\u201dShe watched Matthias\u2019s apathetic face and experienced lightheadedness.\u201cSo, do you want to blame me?\u201d\u00a0Matthias crossed his leg. A mocking smile bloom on his lips.Leyla\u2019s patience had officially expired.\u201cI can\u2019t help myself not to say no.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly is the problem?\u201d Matthias scowled. \u201cI only hunted my birds, in my territory, on my hunting grounds.\u201d\u201cBut the birds don\u2019t know.\u201dLeyla dared to retort, repeating \u2013for uncle Bill\u2013 words in her head.\u201cFor the birds, it\u2019s just a forest. A place where they were born and raised. It\u2019s also a home to which they\u2019d want to return after their migration.\u201d\u201cIs it necessary for me to understand them?\u201d\u201cNot really, but\u2026..\u201d Leyla removed her bloodstained gardening gloves and took a deep breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so ruthless in hunting them.\u201dShe\u2019d have to summon a heck of a lot of courage to utter those sentences. A very delayed feeling of regret washed over her after that, but the duke showed no signs of displeasure or anger.\u00a0\u00a0Leyla felt even more suffocated because of his odd stillness.\u201cLeyla Lewellin, the bird-loving girl.\u201dMatthias spoke up after a long moment of silence.\u201cWhat in the world do you think hunting is?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cDo you want me to go for a friendly hunt?\u201dHis scorn surely clawed at her heart. Leyla could only endure his insult by clutching her skirt.\u201c\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for my mistake. I\u2019ve said something rude. Please forgive my impoliteness.\u201d\u201cWhat makes you so fond of birds?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be a compelling story for you.\u201d Leyla lowered her head, signaling that she didn\u2019t want to see him any longer.Matthias was deafeningly silent.\u201cNow that I\u2019ve finished my work, I\u2019m leaving.\u201dLeyla bowed profoundly and turned her body while Matthias still stayed muffled.Bang!Right as she was about to take a step forward, a rabid shot unexpectedly rang out, reverberating throughout the wilderness sky.Leyla quickly circled back with a horrid face.Click\u2026Matthias eyed her with a rifle in his hand after fired his gun towards the tree branch.A bloodied bird then fell on the ground between them.\u201cWhat will you do, Leyla?\u201dHe then sat back on the tree trunk as if nothing had happened.\u201cI don\u2019t think your job is over yet.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16\u2727 Something That Is Nothing \u2727Arvis\u2019s forest was soon becoming dark after its sun began to sink.Matthias was staring at Leyla, who looked at the dead bird with blurry eyes. There was a period of silence between them. He was still patiently waiting, because he believed Leyla wouldn\u2019t be able to run away for a while.\u201cJust\u2026\u2026\u201dLeyla lifted her head. Her pupils were brimming with anger that even the dark couldn\u2019t mask. Her eyes were arrogant and brazen but Matthias thought that was far better than her avoiding his gaze.\u201cJust tell me. What did I do wrong?\u201d\u201cWrong?\u201d\u201cYes. What wrongdoing have I committed against you\u2026.. why should I be punished like this?\u201d\u201cI never punished you,\u201d Matthias laughed. \u201cI did my job, and you, Leyla, did yours.\u201dAfter a brief moment of wondering, Matthias looked at Leyla again with a subdued glance.\u201cWrongdoing\u2026Huh?\u2026.Why do you like birds so much?\u201dHe repeated the same question.Leyla looked up to the sky, towards the dead bird, and then back to Matthias. Her shoulders trembled, but her eyes staring at him remained wide open.It irritated Matthias but at the same time amusing as well.\u201cThey\u2019re always by my side,\u201dLeyla answered aloud to his question. There was a wave of slight anger in her voice, but it didn\u2019t sound rude or offensive.\u201cEver since I was a child, I\u2019ve been traveling around a lot of different places, but the birds were always there wherever I went. They were always in my vicinity. As the seasons changed, some of the birds who had gone away would still return as I waited for them. The birds always came back to me.\u201dLeyla\u2019s voice became softer as she spoke. Perhaps, the tenderness had been caused by her smooth articulation.\u201cThe birds are there in every season. I can find them in every place. I love living around these lovely and free creatures.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. But it might be meaningless to you, duke.\u201dPfftt\u2026.Matthias giggled low, looking at Leyla, who blustered with a teary-eyed expression and rose to his feet. It seemed the time of the dinner party had approached before he realized it.\u201cAre you going to hunt like this again?\u201d Leyla stopped him when he was preparing to leave.\u201cIf it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Matthias answered without skipping a second.He was pleased. Leyla\u2019s eyes, which were filled with despair, fear, and frustration after that, really satisfied him.After briefly altering his mind, Matthias stood in front of her.\u201cLeyla, everything in my life has to be in its place. Where there\u2019s no need for someone to run or hide.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cSimply stay in your place.\u201d\u201cPlace\u2026? I\u2026. I don\u2019t understand what you mean by that.\u201d\u201cThink it through thoroughly.\u201d\u201cDuke.\u201d\u201cWho knows? I might consider a \u2018friendly\u2019 hunting session if you find the answer.\u201dMatthias walked away leaving behind a dazed Leyla.He didn\u2019t want to hold high hopes towards her. But, he wanted Leyla Lewellin to stay in her place.As an orphan living in the forest.As a studious schoolgirl.And soon, as a female teacher in the place where she should be.Sitting on the back of his horse, Matthias turned his head and looked towards the bush. There, Leyla was still curled up before the dead bird. Matthias believed she was crying as he noticed a sparkle on her cheeks.There was a sense of contentment blooming in his eyes when Matthias saw her tears.He was born into a world where perfect order reigned supreme and now he was on his way to being its master.Underneath that principle, everything in his world stayed simple and clear. Living up to a specific role or meeting a set of expectations wasn\u2019t at all problematic.He was his grandmother\u2019s and mother\u2019s proud successor.\u00a0The gracious master of Arvis\u2019s people. The brilliant commander on the battlefield. Not to mention even the director of a successful business.He was always somebody\u2019s \u201csomething,\u201d and Matthias willingly played that role.The people around him also viewed him in the same light. He polished their designated roles, actions, and feelings in a structured manner. Those were the emotions that he always saw, heard, and learned.But that poor orphan who lives in my forest?Matthias\u2019s eyes narrowed as he looked at Leyla.She\u2019s nothing.Matthias smiled when he realized how easy the conclusion had been.It was the first time something that was \u201cnothing\u201d had invaded his world.Duke of Herhardt didn\u2019t need any extra stains in his life. Nevertheless, it was queer to have something that he didn\u2019t need in his life.And yet, Matthias thought it wasn\u2019t too bad. That woman whose value was equivalent to \u2018nothing\u2019, her sentiments displayed before him amused him a little, much as seeing a flying bird plummet to its death.Especially her tears.He enjoyed seeing Leyla cry. She was such a lovely weeper. Attractive enough to him to make her cry over and over again.Matthias made his way out of the forest with a content heart.In the mansion where he returned, he went through the same routine\u2014a dinner with a raucous crowd\u2014the ornate but empty conversations adorned with the ice-cold champagne and artificial laughter.After the brief summer night had passed and the morning came again, Matthias thought that doing \u2018friendly\u2019 hunting wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea next time.When he looked out the window, Leyla was there. She worked in the rose garden, quietly helping the gardener with his job.See?Matthias chuckled as he turned away from the window.It\u2019s that easy, Leyla.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThank you, Leyla.\u201dClaudine graciously conveyed her thanks. Her sitting-friend also thanked Leyla with a slight smile.\u201cNo problem, Miss.\u201dLeyla bent respectfully and clasped her white palms together. The grass had stained her fingers as she plucked the flowers. Furthermore, the rose thorns had pierced her fingers, leaving several bloodstained bruises too.\u201cNow I will\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you cut off that red rose as well? A bouquet is enough.\u201dClaudine cut her off mid-sentence. She gestured to Leyla to turn around and looked at the garden\u2019s flower field, brimming with vibrantly colored red roses in full bloom.\u201cYes, Miss.\u201dLeyla retook her basket and scissors, obediently carried out her orders as always.Claudine silently watched her distant back. She found Leyla while strolling through the garden with a friend who had paid a visit to the Arvis manor. That orphan girl was working hard today to help the gardener after being gone for several days.Claudine then canceled their tea date and suggested to her friend, Emily, to arrange the flowers instead.Emily enthusiastically agreed and under the vine rose-covered pergola the maids prepared the flower arrangements for the two ladies.After that, Claudine dispatched a maid to call Leyla. They had been like this since they were children. Whenever Claudine made a flower arrangement under the pergola, Leyla Lewellin\u2019s job was to get the roses she needed.Leyla wasn\u2019t good enough to be Claudine\u2019s playmate, but she was very good at doing errands.Claudine would sometimes call her on days when she was bored, only to say a few words.\u201cThat girl behaves very politely, but she has an arrogant air,\u201d Emily said, pouting her lips while watching Leyla. \u201cHow should I put it \u2026. She doesn\u2019t seem to know where she belongs.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Emily. Leyla is a pitiful child.\u201d Claudine frowned slightly and cut off the rose branches with the scissors Leyla had given her. \u201cFor sure, she has shortcomings, but let\u2019s still be tolerant of her.\u201dClaudine\u2019s words made Emily laugh, \u201cWell. Aren\u2019t you overly kind to your attendant?\u201d\u201cAn attendee who diligently performs their roles should be respected.\u201dClaudine\u2019s voice became lower and softer. She placed the flowers one by one in the blue porcelain vase after trimming them.Leyla returned shortly after with a bouquet of red roses. She bowed politely to them once again and put the roses on the table.Claudine stopped her hands and looked at her. Emily\u2019s criticism of Leyla seemed accurate. She had interacted with the child for a long time now and somehow she agreed with Emily\u2019s words.Claudine honestly didn\u2019t get why Emily could give such a critique about Leyla.Leyla Lewellin\u2019s docile manner seemed to be derived from her indifferent attitude. Many famous noble daughters wished to be friends with Claudine, whereas\u00a0 Leyla lacked enthusiasm and wasn\u2019t happy whenever Claudine was around her.\u00a0She never bothered to make herself presentable in front of Claudine and she never flattered her either.In a nutshell, Leyla was the type of person who endured and obediently followed orders.Claudine wasn\u2019t used to being overlooked by anyone. She felt belittled that an orphan had treated her with such indifference.\u201cGood job, Leyla.\u201dClaudine smiled kindly. Leyla took a step back as she bent, and the maid approached her from a short distance away.Claudine had been looking forward to this moment the most. The moment when Leyla\u2019s true feelings were seen through her eyes, in the same way, she did when she was awarded a gold coin.Even after all these years, Leyla couldn\u2019t keep her cool when given the gold coin. Claudine was pleased when Leyla\u2019s hand, which held the gold coin, trembled like grasping a hot potato.To top it off, Claudine was planning to give her another present. A party invitation, which would give a wonderful experience for that poor girl.\u201cAre you giving this to me?\u201d Leyla looked flustered; her eyes grew wider when she received an invitation from the same maid who had given her the gold coin.\u201cYes. I had asked the two duchesses for permission and they allowed it.\u201d\u201cBut, Miss\u2026..\u201d\u201cI really want you to come, Leyla.\u201dClaudine smiled as he interrupted Leyla\u2019s words a second time. But her bright smile made Leyla\u2019s complexion look even paler.\u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t turn down my invitation.\u201dAfter talking with Leyla as if she were a long-time childhood friend, Claudine took her eyes away from her.\u2018I have to tame that obstinate child before I become Duchess of Arvis.\u2019Claudine made up her mind as she trimmed the bunch of red roses on the table and skillfully decorated the floral vase with exquisite beauty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Word of the party circulated quickly to the rest of the residents.Everyone initially was mystified before turning to sympathize with her upon finding out the whole story.Every soul in that place could see how badly Lady Brandt treated the pitiful Leyla like she was her dog.\u201cI fail to see why all the aristocrats are so nasty.\u201dBill Remmer had been resting in the shade from the midday heat when madam Mona, the chef, visited him in the afternoon. The surprising news rooted him to the spot.\u201cThe aristocrats claim to be considerate, but how intimidated would Leyla be in such a place?\u201d\u201cLeyla isn\u2019t the type of child who is easily intimidated by things like that. She would only briefly show her face and come back.\u201d\u201cUgh. Men don\u2019t know anything!\u201dBill just scratched his neck when she grumbled. He took out his cigarette and flicked the ashes.\u201cLet\u2019s show them what they deserve!\u201d\u201cHuh, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand what I mean? With Leyla\u2019s pretty looks, let\u2019s take the wind out of those aristocrat\u2019s sails.\u201d\u201cNo, why are you so\u2026\u2026.?\u201d\u201cI knew it! Do you want to send Leyla to the party in her uniform?\u201d\u2018What\u2019s wrong with school uniforms?\u2019Bill looked at a loss and Madam Mona sighed, \u201cLook here, Bill Remmer. After all these years, don\u2019t you think you should know how to raise a daughter?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean a daughter? I\u2019m still thinking about where to send her\u2026.\u201d\u201cSure. You have to think about that. You\u2019ll think when you send Leyla on her wedding day, think when you\u2019ll hold her children, and think even when you\u2019re in your coffin.\u201d\u201cNo! How could I send that little girl off to marry? You\u2019re talking gibberish.\u201dSeeing Bill heat up with anger, Madam Mona\u2019s lips softened, \u201cAnd you still say she\u2019s not your daughter. You\u2019re a man I really don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cJust leave if you\u2019re going to keep talking nonsense.\u201d\u201cCome on, let\u2019s buy her a new dress, Mr. Remmer. She\u2019s a girl. How happy will she be when she gets a surprise gift?\u201d Madam Mona suggested him with a commanding tone. \u201cLeyla isn\u2019t the type of child who would ask for a dress, and you\u2019re not the type of person who would care, so I have no choice but to meddle. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 How?\u201d\u201cYou pay for the dress and I\u2019m going to get it ready for her.\u201d\u201cDo it, then.\u201dBill went inside the house with a grouse and brought his bag out. He used to save his money in the cottage due to his skepticism of the bank.Leyla had previously gone to the goat pen. She returned to the cottage when Madam Mona was collecting money from Bill to purchase dresses and shoes. The two hurriedly concealed the proof of their deal and put on an innocent act.Madam Mona refused Leyla\u2019s offer of a cup of tea. After she exited the cottage, Bill silently tucked his purse into his back pocket.\u201cDid madam Mona nag you talking about me again? I haven\u2019t been climbing trees lately.\u201d Leyla anxiously asked after sitting on a chair next to Bill.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that; no need to worry about it.\u201d Bill cleared his throat and ignited the cigarette he had extinguished a moment ago.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d Leyla smiled and leaned into her chair after taking off her hat.Every day, Bill was delighted to see Leyla sporting the straw hat he had given her this summer. He no longer regretted giving madam Mona his money as he thought it would be multiple times more fulfilling to see Leyla dressed up in an elegant dress.\u201cLeyla.\u201dLeyla turned after Bill abruptly called her.\u201cWhat are you planning to do? I mean, about the duke\u2019s party.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just stopping by to say hello. Since the Etmans have also been invited, I will go with Kyle.\u201d\u201cReally? That herbivorous glutton is finally paying off for all the food he has eaten at my house.\u201dBill felt a rush of relief wash over him when he heard Kyle\u2019s name. That boy was someone he fully trusted.\u201cBut, don\u2019t you need anything? A dress to wear, things like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, uncle.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re fine. Are you planning to wear your school uniform?\u201d\u201cWell, that isn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201dLeyla giggled with delight. Seeing her look so carefree, Bill was absent-minded.Is it true that I\u2019m clueless about raising a daughter?\u201cNo.\u201dMy daughter? What nonsense.Bill muttered in a dazed dismay and quickly retracted the idea. He felt awkward\u00a0 when he met Leyla\u2019s puzzled gaze which was framed with sparkling glasses.Bill tasted her efforts to avoid causing him any trouble and avoid being indebted to him if possible. He fully understood. He simply hid it beneath his bluntness, unable to find the right words to comfort her.Bill admitted that. Despite her extreme means, madam Mona had made a great decision to surprise Leyla with a dress and shoes.\u201cLeyla.\u201dBill called her once again and mustered his guts.\u201c\u2026.. There\u2019s a scorcher outside.\u201dAgain, he failed to express the words he wished.Leyla chuckled at Bill, who cleared his throat after saying useless things and gently grasped his hand on the chair\u2019s armrest.\u2018I\u2019m the one who should comfort you instead.\u2019Bill\u2019s expression got sour, but he couldn\u2019t shake off her little hand. Leyla smiled at him; she was a girl with a charming smile.Evening had fallen when Leyla rose from her seat. The chamber was bathed in inky darkness.She lay motionless on her bed, taking in everything around.A Familiar ceiling. Creamy curtains that hung over the window. An old desk with a few books on it. A soft duvet cover with a light scent of sunshine.\u2018I\u2019m in my room.\u2019Leyla let out a relieved sigh when she realized where she was.The nightmares persisted to torment her. She had a flashback to the time she was abandoned in this world. She was without a family, and forced to travel around her relatives\u2019 houses.Every day, Leyla had been having the same dreams. Until she met Uncle Bill. Even so, her recollection of the place that had instilled in her the fear of water stayed vivid in her mind.\u2018It\u2019s all because of you!\u2019Her uncle always wrecked his anger on her whenever he was drunk.He was a shy and quiet guy when he was sober, but the uncle Leyla remembered was a man who was drunk five days a week. He got more aggressive when he lost money at the casino and never failed to swear and slap her.Leyla resented him.He was someone she detested. All she could do was endure it, as an orphan with nowhere else to go.Given that, Leyla made every effort she could. She never took a rest from helping with the housework and only ate a little. She rarely moved around, just like an object placed in the corner of the house.On the day she was officially kicked out of the house, her aunt was kind enough to give her a paper bag with cookies. Leyla took the paper bag from her aunt and said her last goodbyes.Leyla took out the cookie before going to the place of the next relative\u00a0 and ate it in the carriage. The chocolate\u2019s deliciousness was tearing her heart but she refused to cry.On the ride to her destination, Leyla practiced smiling. No one in this world liked crying orphans. So, the more she wanted to weep, the more she tried to make her smile bright. Her dainty lips bloomed even wider after being booted out repeatedly.When she had to cross the border into Berg, though, she hardly smiled. Leyla did believe that the single address she had in her hand was her last hope; she would be forced to go to an orphanage if she was abandoned again.Leyla couldn\u2019t forget. The day she had the best smile she\u2019d ever had, was the day she met Uncle Bill\u2019s warm, compassionate eyes.It was an unforgettable day when she truly had a family and a home to which she longed to return to.\u2018Everything is going to be well.\u2019Leyla comforted herself and awoke from her slumber. She seemed unconcerned and didn\u2019t want to dwell on the duke\u2019s party, which was to be hosted this evening. She planned to attend the party with confidence and then quietly leave.Claudine Brandt surely didn\u2019t know how much Uncle Bill and this warm cottage meant to her. And how Leyla was willing to do anything to protect them.Leyla flung open the window and let the fresh air in. She washed her face and quickly changed her dress. After she slammed the door shut, she was greeted by Uncle Bill, who was getting ready to go gardening.\u201cUncle, Let\u2019s go together!\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The manor was poised to welcome guests as the afternoon arrived. The large-scale party was an everyday thing for Arvisans.They carried out their responsibilities for their respective roles. All that remained was for the sunset to herald the commencement of this glitzy celebration.Nobody in Arvis\u2019 manor expressed worry about the party\u2019s success today. Tonight\u2019s party, like anything else that lay in the Herhardt name, would be perfect as always.Matthias dressed up and exited the fitting room in his evening suit. He exuded a chillier impression whenever he had his hair slicked back, exposing his forehead and brows. His piercing gaze and razor-sharp facial features couldn\u2019t be melted by the faint smile on the tip of his lips.\u201cIt went well and as you had ordered, master,\u201d Hessen reported.Matthias lifted his brow slightly and turned with a cigarette in his hand.\u201cThey left about an hour ago, so the items must have been delivered by now.\u201d\u201cFine, then.\u201dMatthias nodded, kindling his cigar which he snuffed between his lips.\u201cGood job.\u201dHessen bowed his head gladly in response to his master\u2019s compliment.Matthias found that Claudine had invited Leyla Lewellin to the party through his mother. His mother impressed and lauded Claudine for her kindness and charity towards the deprived orphan.Matthias made no objections, believing that : The view of Claudine showing her fullest sympathy and compassion when Leyla arrived at the party in her shabby outfit would be a cringe-worthy sight to see.Matthias seemed to know which part of Leyla Lewellin did pique Claudine\u2019s attention.The girl named Leyla was an annoying little child. Trampling on her pride was kind of an enjoyment.That\u2019s why Matthias was determined about not handing her off to Claudine. He had no intention of sharing his things with anyone.Only he could have all that fun and pleasure. Only he could bully her.Her only owner was Matthias von Herhardt.\u201cWhat shall I do with this, master?\u201dHessen mentioned the box by the fireplace. It was Madam Mona\u2019s prepared present package. The gift was supposed to be delivered to Bill Remmer\u2019s cottage today, but Hessen took it and brought it here instead. The butler had replaced the chef\u2019s box with another one he had acquired on Matthias\u2019 request.Matthias smoked his cigar as he stared at the gift box. Without opening it, it\u2019s easy for him to figure out what was inside.\u201cThrow it away.\u201dHis calm directives floated by, along with the soaring tobacco smoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18\u2727 Emerald \u2727\u201cUncle, this looks expensive,\u201dLeyla was shocked as she looked into the box with bulging eyes. Bill, too, was amazed at the present and couldn\u2019t come up with a good excuse.Leyla sneered at Bill,\u00a0 \u201cUncle, did you spend a lot of money?\u201d\u201cNo. Not really \u2026. it was not as costly as you think! You\u2019re too worried about everything.\u201dBill stuttered a bit. On the day of the party, the dress Madam Mona had prepared arrived at their cottage.He had believed the courier would send the dress. But who would have thought the dress was delivered by a young guy who claimed to be a store employee. So Bill assumed that maybe Madam Mona had bought a very special dress for Leyla until the clerk handed it off to them directly.The dress was far beyond his expectations after Leyla unboxed it.Even for Bill, who knew little about women\u2019s fashion and accessories, his eyes could tell that the white dress stitched with golden threads appeared luxurious and heavenly. Likewise with the shoes, gloves, and the necklace.\u2018Wait, how much money did I give Madam Mona before?\u2019Bill started counting with his fingers.\u2018But did she also buy the necklace with the money I gave her?\u2019He was perplexed and recalculated once more, but Leyla quickly put the lid back.\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cHow can I not like it?\u201d\u201cThen why?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s return it. I don\u2019t want you to waste this much money just for a one-night event.\u201dLeyla seemed to be worried. Her reaction was contrary to Madam Mona\u2019s guesses that the gift would make her thrilled.\u201cLeyla, if you don\u2019t wear this to the party. I don\u2019t want to see you again.\u201dBill\u2019s expression becomes upset all of a sudden.\u201cYou never want to be indebted to me. I understand your reasoning, but I don\u2019t like it if you draw a straight line between me and you, Leyla.\u201d\u201cUncle\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll throw it into the fireplace if you don\u2019t take it. And I won\u2019t see you again.\u201dThe angry-looking Bill stepped to the front door and fled outside the cottage.He strolled through the flower garden with his cigarette, yet his mind was loaded with late regrets for saying such hurtful things to the child. He didn\u2019t mean it when he said he\u2019d never see her again.Bill was pondering whether or not to return when Kyle suddenly appeared in his tailcoat from the other side of the road.\u201cMr. Remmer. Is Leyla ready?\u201d asked Kyle with a sunny visage.Bill mulled for a moment at his arrival. Kyle Etman, who he had thought was just a child who was always pretending to be an adult, now looked like a grown-ass man in his formal suit.\u201cWell. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhat? Leyla isn\u2019t home? The party is about to start.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s home, but\u2026\u2026\u201dBill sighed. He didn\u2019t know how to explain it. But suddenly, the front door creaked open and Leyla came out.The two-waiting men outside turned their heads and were nonplussed at the breathtaking view before their eyes.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cKyle, do I look weird?\u201d Leyla asked with her smirky little meerkat face. \u201cI feel so awkward wearing this dress\u2026..\u201d\u201cNo, you look pretty.\u201dKyle, who was tight-lipped for a fleeting moment, cut her words. Once again, he complimented her expressly.\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, Leyla. I mean it.\u201dKyle\u2019s blushing face melted his adolescent smile.\u00a0He knew that Uncle Bill was preparing a gift for Leyla, but he hadn\u2019t expected it would be as posh as this.He was initially apprehensive about entrusting Bill\u2019s eyes, which were prone to picking tacky stuff.But for this one\u2026\u2026\u201cHey, Kyle Etman! Wake up!\u201dBill chided him and patted his flustered back.\u201cYou\u2019re going in my place to escort her today.\u201d He eyed Kyle sternly. \u201cThat means you have to take responsibility to protect her. You can do it, right?\u201d\u201cOf course, Mr. Remmer,\u201d Kyle answered with much confidence. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to protect her!\u201dBill couldn\u2019t hold back his guffaw once Kyle vowed with a beet-red face.Kyle took some deep breaths to calm his throbbing heart when Leyla gingerly sauntered towards him. He reached out his hand in a polite gesture.\u201cHey\u2026what are you doing?\u201dLeyla questioned the meaning of his outstretched hand. But Kyle seemed unfazed by her wonderment.\u201cWe\u2019re partners at today\u2019s party.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSo.\u201dKyle mustered up his courage to take Leyla\u2019s hand and place it over his arm.\u201cWe should walk like this since I\u2019m your party\u2019s partner.\u201dHis voice trembled and he stammered a little because of nervousness.Leyla hesitated for a moment, lost in thought, before nodding and linking her arms around his. She smiled.\u201cFine, let\u2019s go, Kyle.\u201dGazing at her gaily smile that was brighter than the sun, Kyle murmured to himself.\u2018This is a moment I won\u2019t forget for the rest of my life.\u2019*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*In a nutshell, Leyla Lewellin showed up at the party hand in hand with the doctor\u2019s son.Matthias had been busy welcoming the guests when he turned his back to see Leyla entering the hall, escorted by Kyle Etman.Leyla\u2019s appearance was Hessen\u2019s proving ground that he was Arvis\u2019s most capable butler. His choice of dress for Leyla Lewellin was gorgeous. But Matthias believed Leyla would still be attractive even if she wore the shabby dress bought by the chef.Matthias locked his eyes on her, keeping a watchful glance on her things.From her shoes.Her dress.Then, to the viridescent necklace that embellished her white, svelte neck.The green necklace, which was pieced together by pearls and emeralds, was absolutely stunning.The dress and shoes had been prepared by Hessen, but it was Matthias who chose the necklace.It was just by chance. He was on his way to the hotel for an appointment when he happened to see that necklace.The finely crafted emerald\u2019s luminous green color gleaming in a display window by the hotel was captivating. Hence, Matthias instructed Hessen to buy the necklace on their way back to the estate that day.Leyla abruptly turned her head and she realized someone had cast their eyes on her. Her green eyes, which resembled a lush summer woodland, came to a halt right in front of Matthias\u2019s face.Leyla slightly narrowed her gaze. But, her face shied away in surprise after she recognized who the person was.She clutched Kyle\u2019s arm and hid behind his back, drawing her gaze away from Matthias, who only looked at her immovably.\u201cLong time no see, Duke Herhardt.\u201dMatthias only quit staring at her after someone greeted him.He warmly welcomed the familiar guest with a modest smile and exchanged brief pleasantries. Matthias was capable of completing his job flawlessly although his mind now was in a different place.When Matthias shifted his gaze back to her, Leyla had already been walking away with Kyle to the other side of the hall.Kyle Etman seemed to be proudly puffing out his chest when he was escorting Leyla. He acted as if she were his and led her around.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThis is Leyla. She\u2019s my friend.\u201dClaudine took Leyla and introduced her to another group of ladies.\u201cHello. I\u2019m Leyla Lewellin.\u201dLeyla played her part well with a polite greeting behaving like a doll with no will or feeling as she always did.Claudine grinned satisfiedly looking at her. She was pleased with Leyla\u2019s obedient and kind conduct then continued presenting her to other people.\u201cLeyla\u2019s pursuing a teaching career. Isn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201dThe ladies soon replicated Claudine\u2019s ecstatic praising manner, and they began complimenting Leyla in droves. But underneath all the praises, it was undoubtedly a tribute to Lady Claudine who regarded the poor orphan as her friend.Those aristocratic ladies were fully aware that the two could never be real friends. Still, those empty compliments wouldn\u2019t smudge Claudine\u2019s reputation.\u201cOh, Claudine. I heard you\u2019re getting engaged.\u201dOne of the ladies smoothly dropped the topic, as if their talk about an orphan who aspired to become a teacher was over. The topic of Claudine Brandt\u2019s engagement now had sparked everyone\u2019s interest.Claudine adopted a shy and humble demeanor right away. It wasn\u2019t very sensible to behave as if she had become Duchess Herhardt when they hadn\u2019t officially announced their engagement yet.\u201cOh, look! Duke Herhardt is coming here!\u201dA burst of admiration from one of the ladies on the other side of the hall drew everyone\u2019s focus to one place.Leyla, who kept wearing an apathetic expression the whole time, also widened her eyes in tandem with them.Matthias passed by her, and as might be expected, he stood neatly beside his future bride-to-be.Claudine then wrapped her arms around Matthias\u2019.\u00a0But it wasn\u2019t the same with Leyla. Her face was noticeably paler than before as she saw them being together.\u201cDuke Herhardt, they\u2019re my friends.\u201dMatthias greeted them with grace as Claudine began introducing them. He moved his eyes from one person to the next before stopping in front of Leyla\u2019s face, who stood at the far end of the group.\u201cShe\u2019s Leyla,\u201d Claudine introduced her while holding Matthias\u2019s arm tightly. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t recognize her, right? She\u2019s so different from usual that I almost didn\u2019t recognize her either.\u201dLeyla flushed with shame at Claudine\u2019s veiled sarcasm.\u00a0She seemed to be deliberately provoking her.As Claudine noticed it. No matter how many slurs she spat at Leyla, that emotionless girl would always react differently whenever Matthias was there.Suddenly, a warm voice broke the brief silence.\u201cSorry, excuse me.\u201dKyle Etman, the boy who had been loitering around with a disapproving look ever since Claudine took Leyla away.\u201cI apologize for interrupting your talk, but may I take my partner now?\u201dKyle reached out and pulled Leyla\u2019s hand without hesitation.Leyla seemed a little startled, but she complied. Instead, she looked relieved, like a missing kid who had found her parents after being separated from them.\u201cMy friends are also looking forward to meeting her.\u201dKyle eyed Claudine coldly, which contrasted with his gentlemanly manner.\u201cThen I have to give permission. We can\u2019t hold Leyla for much longer.\u201dClaudine happily nodded her head and glanced at Matthias, who seemed to pay no heed to them.\u201cThank you, Lady Brandt. And also\u2026. Duke Herhardt.\u201dKyle bowed courteously.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Leyla.\u201dWatching their backs, which were drawing further away, Claudine soon realized something after witnessing Kyle\u2019s tender smile when he stared at Leyla\u2019s face.She could tell as his mellow smile reflected his feelings clearly.That boy loved Leyla.That boy seemed to cherish her-who looked smaller and thinner beside him, who was the same height as Matthias- like his precious treasure.\u2018But, what about Leyla?\u2019Through her slightly opened eyes, Claudine studied Leyla closely. That girl was smiling back at that doctor\u2019s son.Claudine had seen Leyla Lewellin smile in front of her before. Yet, this was the first time she saw her bright and pleasurable smiley face, like a girl who was smitten.\u2018So, it\u2019s the doctor\u2019s son, not Duke Herhardt?\u2019\u2018Then was he the one who turned Leyla Lewellin into a princess?\u2019When Claudine was still ruminating in her daydream, Leyla and Kyle turned around.\u201cAh, Leyla!\u201dWithout realizing it, Claudine called her name.Leyla stood still, bathing in the light from the ceiling chandelier.\u201cYou\u2019re looking pretty lovely today. Especially your necklace.\u201d\u201cPardon? Ah\u2026.. yes. Thank you, miss.\u201dBewildered, Leyla fumbled for her necklace.The long emerald necklace dangling on her chest was finely crafted in the flower petal shape and matched the iris color of her eyes.That piece of jewelry suited her perfectly as if it had been made just for her.\u00a0The green gemstones also looked authentic, similarly to the white pearls that decorated the edges.The jewel necklace that adorned her slender neck was too lavish and enticing to be branded as a knockoff.\u2018Kyle Etman is just a doctor\u2019s son; could he afford to buy a necklace like that for her?\u2019\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Duke Herhardt?\u201dClaudine grinned as she looked at Matthias.\u201cYes. She is.\u201dUnbothered by it, Matthias answered her question as if he didn\u2019t care.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After putting up with a less-than-pleasant festive environment, Leyla could finally breathe a sigh of relief. She thanked him while leaning against the marble balustrade.\u201cThanks, Kyle. Thank you so much.\u201dLeyla thought Kyle would make a wisecrack, but his face looked pissed off instead.\u201cKyle?\u201d\u201cWhy are you holding it in?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re like a kitten on a string, they treated you like a circus animal. Why did you say nothing? You\u2019re not like the prideful and smart Leyla Lewellin that I know.\u201d\u201cAh, who cares.\u201dUnlike Kyle, who was overtly annoyed, Leyla just giggled. \u201cAnything about what they said, there\u2019s nothing wrong. I\u2019m an orphan, I\u2019m indebted to Uncle Bill, and I plan to become a teacher.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t understand your logic.\u201d\u201cDuplicity is human nature Mr. Etman.\u201dKyle laughed at her sarcastic reply, \u201cYou\u2019re only good at saying useless things.\u201d\u201cYou can go now Kyle. I\u2019m really fine.\u201d\u201cGo where?\u201d\u201cThere are still many people you have to meet there. Some of your friends have also been waiting for you.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Kyle waved his hand with a peeved look and rested his back against the fence alongside Leyla.\u201cKyle, don\u2019t be like that\u2026..\u201dKyle turned to her,\u201d I\u2019m here as your partner today.\u201dAs he said, his pair of brownish hue eyes gleamed warmly in the ashen night.\u201cSo I\u2019ll stay with you.\u201dA smile gradually crept over his lips like a butterfly blooming its wings.\u201cBecause I want to.\u201dA gentle wind blew through the rose garden, carrying the sweet scent with it. Leyla tried to answer him back, yet, her lips were sealed tight. So all she could do was grasp the handrail on the terrace in both of her hands.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering?\u201d Kyle asked her.Leyla dropped her head and gazed at the tip of her shoes awkwardly. Her face\u00a0blushed with shyness,\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\u201cAre you being shy in front of me?\u201d\u201cGeez\u2026No way.\u201d\u201cBut your face is blushing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201dLeyla touched her rosy cheeks.\u201cJust kidding.\u201dLeyla laughed after seeing Kyle\u2019s playful giggling. It was then when Mrs. Etman, who had been searching the party hall for her son, showed up on the terrace and found both of them.\u201cKyle. What the hell are you doing here?\u201d She sighed deeply and walked up to them.Leyla hurriedly straightened her stance and bent her head. Mrs. Etman accepted her greeting in passing and turned back to her son.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people waiting to see you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my father, not me.\u201dSeeing her son\u2019s response, Mrs. Etman\u2019s eyes glowered more sternly, \u201cKyle Etman. Do my words sound like a joke to you?\u201d\u201cMom, you know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. Madam Norma\u2019s waiting for you. You\u2019re not thinking of making her wait, are you?\u201dMrs. Etman showed her obstinate demeanor as if she didn\u2019t want to give an opening for Kyle to come up with any further counter-arguments.\u201cSee you later, Kyle.\u201dLeyla cautiously spoke after watching the tension between the mother and son.The duke\u2019s grandmother, Duchess Norma, adored the only son of their family doctor. And Leyla knew very well how proud Mrs. Etman was about it.\u201cI\u2019ll wait here.\u201dLeyla smiled to reassure Kyle.\u201cThank you, Leyla.\u201dOnly then, was Mrs. Etman able to smile at Leyla. That woman\u2019s brown-hued eyes, which were a replica of Kyle\u2019s, always looked bitterly towards her. Leyla knew that as well.Kyle reluctantly dragged his heavy steps as Leyla bid a goodbye, waving a little to him, who kept looking back.\u201cWait for me!\u201d Kyle cried as he grimaced.\u00a0 \u201cYou have to wait for me, Leyla!\u201d\u2018I will.\u2019Leyla wished to reply to his outcry, but she dunno why her lips remain sealed till the end. So, all she could do was laugh and vigorously wave her hand towards Kyle even more.The terrace was back to its peacefulness after their departure.The beautiful luminescence of the chandeliers mingled in harmony with the music and sound of laughter from the hall, creating an oasis of calm beneath night\u2019s moon.Leyla had left her glasses at home, so the flickering lights in the distance were nebulous. But, the dim night world became more dreamy and romantic within her blurry vision.Now, Leyla Lewellin\u2019s time in the spotlight was over.Leyla was able to wind down. She chuckled in awe in a happy mood as she looked closely at her unusual appearance tonight.Whenever she moved her legs a bit, the decorated ribbon on her waist and the skirt rattled slightly. Leyla became so jolly as she tiptoed up and down while her eyes fell on the swirling hem of her lavish dress.The white dress embroidered with the gold lace she wore was as enchanting as the dreamy night. The silky fabric of her dress fiddled across her skin and tickled her entire body softly.And the necklace.Leyla gently fondled her necklace and her sheepish smile perished like a fume.\u2018Why did Lady Brandt say that?\u2019She guessed that probably it was Claudine\u2019s avant-garde way of expressing her disdain and sympathy towards her.Yet, Leyla didn\u2019t mind it. The gift from Uncle Bill was breathtakingly lovely. Regardless of what some said the dress was meant for her and she was thrilled with it.Leyla smiled again but once she lifted her head she saw a fine figure of a tall man stepping out onto the terrace.Her face, which had blossomed with delight when she thought it was Kyle, turned frozen in a split second.Leyla\u2019s feet were glued to the ground after she realized who the guy was.It was Duke Herhardt.Along with Lady Brandt.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThe weather tonight is so clear, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Asked Claudine as she took a few deep breaths.As shown by her behavior, it seemed like she had taken the liberty of leading Matthias to the terrace to get some fresh air and enjoy the night breeze.\u201cSummer is my favourite season because its nights are so beautiful. What about you, Duke Herhardt?\u201dClaudine flashed her dazzling smile as she stood in front of the marble railing. She then tilted her head and eyed someone in the distance who was the reason they had come here in the first place.Leyla Lewellin, who was standing on the far side of the terrace. She was the key reason why Claudine brought Matthias here.\u201cI don\u2019t really like summer, my lady.\u201dMatthias cast his glance around the garden, beautifully framed by the sea of roses. Then his eyes momentarily passed over Leyla\u2019s face, which was flushed with embarrassment and nervousness at the unexpected guests\u2019 appearance.\u201cIs that so? I thought you liked summer.\u201dClaudine looked back to Matthias with her back against Leyla.\u201cNow that I think about it, Duke Herhardt seems to be a callous man. Of course, you know it\u2019s not a reproach, right?\u201dClaudine, with her hands held together behind her back, drew a step closer. The gulf between them now had narrowed to the point where they could taste the warmth of each other\u2019s breath.\u201cBut actually, I like that insensitivity of yours. I think it\u2019s very aristocratic, emphasizing your nobility and elegant manner, which no one else will match.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you like it.\u201dMatthias didn\u2019t back down and faced her calmly with a smirk adorning his lips.\u201cThen, kiss me, please.\u201dClaudine demanded boldly with her eyes fixed on him.\u00a0\u00a0Matthias just stared at her quietly for a fleeting moment before falling into a solemn silence.\u201cI like the heartless Duke Herhardt, but don\u2019t we still need to season our relationship with some passion or enthusiasm?\u201d said Claudine.As she tilted her head, her thickly wavy brown hair fluttered elastically.\u201cI mean, we will get engaged, get married, and will live together for the rest of our lives. So \u2026. a little passion \u2026\u201dMatthias narrowed his eyes for a moment before nodding as he agreed.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dWithout a grain of hesitation, Matthias reached out and embraced her cheek with both of his hands. Claudine jolted a little at his sudden move, but she soon closed her eyes naturally.Staring at the shadows cast by Claudine\u2019s eyelashes, Matthias\u2019 eyes unintentionally wandered to the other end of the terrace.He glanced at Leyla-who had been hovering around agitatedly-just in time.While constantly keeping his eyes on her, Matthias slowly lowered his face and bussed Claudine\u2019s lips.Leyla Lewellin stayed true to her role as Claudine\u2019s sole onlooker. With her body frozen like a doll, she watched the two with a blank expression. The darkness and great distance wasn\u2019t able to conceal the rosy-tint on his two cheeks.Throughout their very restrained kiss, Matthias\u2019s eyes had continued to be on her. Her emerald eyes helplessly looked at him in a paralyzed state. The luminous moon\u00a0 couldn\u2019t enliven her eyes, which were dull like the night sky.The moment Leyla avoided his eyes, the canoodle between the two was over as well. She hurriedly raced down the stairwell leading to the garden before Claudine slowly opened her eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dMatthias politely reached out his hand, and Claudine held it as if nothing had happened.\u201cI\u2019m sure, Duke Herhardt\u2026\u201dClaudine grinned as they entered the party hall.\u201cI\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll become a pretty good couple.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla dashed down the stairwell at a frenzied pace. She wasn\u2019t being chased, but she couldn\u2019t stop her feet from running harder and faster.The sound of her heels slamming against the gravel on the promenade shattered the serenity of the night garden.\u00a0Leyla only came to a halt after she arrived at the huge fountain in the middle of the garden.As she calmed her panting breath, her leg\u2019s long-forgotten pain reappeared. She was just noticing that her feet were hurting because all she had in mind before was simply escaping from the terrace.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dLeyla loosened the lace of her shoes a little and winced in pain. There were raw scratches all over her feet. Her heel\u2019s skin had been peeled off and was bleeding, due to her new stiletto heels.What she wanted to do now was to go back to her cottage but Leyla changed her mind and chose to stay in the garden instead.She had promised Kyle that she\u2019ll be waiting for him. At least, she had to let him know if she was going to take her leave first.Even so, she feared returning to that frenzied mansion, to that strange and unsettling world.Lumbered, Leyla walked in a grimace along the right side of the promenade and sheltered under the pergola in which rose vines were trained.She planned to wait in the garden first, then headed to the mansion to wait for Kyle\u2019s return.But, can I sit down here?Leyla was perplexed as she looked at the bench. The exquisite pergola was created out of the rose foliage cultivated and pruned by Uncle Bill\u2019s green hand. Yet, she had never sat underneath it because it was a seat that no other workers or servants were allowed to use.\u2018But tonight, I\u2019m here as the Arvis\u2019s guest, so wouldn\u2019t it be okay?\u2019After having more of such thoughts, Leyla decided to sit comfortably at the bench. She needed a little more time and courage before she could take off her shoes.She relaxed her exhausted body against the bench\u2019s armrests and wrapped her arms around her knees. Once her throbbing feet collided with the cold marble, the pain started to subside a little.Her beautiful shoes damaged her feet, to the point that she couldn\u2019t put them on again.\u2018My feet would not be hurting like this if I didn\u2019t run.\u2019She gently grazed the inflamed wound with her fingertips, before shaking her head when a sudden memory flashed in her mind.Leyla wrinkled her brow as she recalled Duke Herhardt\u2019s face glaring at her while he was kissing his fianc\u00e9.She just couldn\u2019t help wondering why Claudine took his kiss for granted even though she knew someone else was there.\u201cWhy did they do that?\u201dMumbling to herself, Leyla unwittingly rubbed her lips.\u201c\u2026.. So shameless.\u201dThis time, she caressed it hard with the back of her hand till the inside of her lips.She wished to forget about tonight\u2019s memories and the strange feeling she had when looking at his figure under the dim luminance of the moon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2727 Cry, Even Better If You Beg \u2727\u201cThat\u2019s so kind of you, ma\u2019am.\u201dMrs. Etman regarded Duchess Norma with a look of adoration in her eyes.\u201cHow can you be so generous?\u201dThe more tangible the joy spread on Mrs. Etman\u2019s face, the more troubled Kyle Etman\u2019s expression, who was standing by her side, became.Matthias had a keen eye on the two. Dr. Etman was, without a doubt, a talented doctor. He was well-rounded and had a pleasant personality, and so it was easy to see why the duchess admired him and adored his son.Kyle Etman, who resembled his father, would lead a similar life in the future. Maybe. As long as nothing else would change. His grandmother pretty much ensured that and Matthias saw things the same way.But that\u2019s it.There was no need for him to pay any more attention to such blatant and humdrum brass-tacks. Especially seeing Linda Etman, the very ambitious lady of the house, who had very different mannerisms from the two men of the Etman\u2019s family.\u201cMay I greet them now?\u201dMrs. Etman became a little agitated. She badgered Madam Norma, fearing the duchess might change her mind.\u201cDear.\u201dDr. Etman, who had been calmly watching his wife, tried to dissuade her. Even so, she appeared adamant.Matthias turned his attention back to Kyle Etman. His dear grandmother had offered to introduce the Etmans to Baron Arundt\u2019s family. When the duchess stated,\u00a0\u2018The two families would get along swimmingly, and could be good acquaintances,\u2019\u00a0there was no one who didn\u2019t understand the hidden flavor in her phrase.Baron Arundt had a daughter who was around the same age as Kyle Etman. A pretty daughter who had reached a good age to marry.Even though the Etman family didn\u2019t have any peerage, their wealth outweighed that of the Arundt\u2019s and they had greater clout. Thus, Baron Arundt was the one who would benefit the most if the two families became in-laws\u201cSure, Mrs. Etman. That would be nice.\u201dWith a generous smile, Norma Catharina von Herhardt called her servant. After receiving orders to bring Baron Arundt and his wife in, the servant soon vanished among the crowds.Kyle couldn\u2019t conceal the ire printed on his face. He kept glancing towards the patio linked to the garden as if he\u2019d left something precious there.Sure of that, Matthias\u2019s lips soon curved into a smile.A mother who cherished and expected the best from her son.A son who didn\u2019t want to disappoint his mother.Matthias almost chuckled out loud when he pictured Leyla Lewellin sandwiched between the two.Meanwhile, the Arundt\u2019s couples, led by the servant, came along with their daughter.Based on his countenance, Kyle Etman seemed to be aware of the meaning of this acquaintance. He seemed wanting to get out of there post-haste, but that boy couldn\u2019t unleash himself from the role of being a kind and polite doctor\u2019s son.If so, then\u2026Matthias scurried away, leaving the stage of the tedious matchmaking scene.\u00a0His stride over the terrace and down the stairwell was leisurely one and at his own pace.How did the dutiful son\u2019s puppy love story end up so predictably?Leyla Lewellin would be left abandoned in Arvis\u2019 forest at the end of this story.By the time he reached that obvious conclusion, Matthias had found Leyla. That girl was staying underneath the rose pergola in the corner of the garden.\u00a0As foreseen, Leyla didn\u2019t bother to go far because she had promised to wait for the doctor\u2019s son.Lightly trodding, Matthias walked over to her. He wondered why she didn\u2019t get flustered when he approached her. Soon he realized; she was in deep slumber.The small, crouching girl glinted in the glow-worm moonlight that filtered through the rose shrubbery.Matthias stopped a few feet away from the bench. And he took a long, thoughtful look at her.First, at her neatly taken-off shoes.At her swollen feet.At the slender arms wrapped around her knees.Lastly, his eyes were drawn to her innocent sleeping face.Her long drooping wavy golden locks wrapped around her slender neck and shoulders. Matthias slouched his waist and gently picked up her shoes while wondering about the softness of her golden tresses.It was that moment when Leyla slowly opened her eyes.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u2018I\u2019ve got to be dreaming.\u2019Vaguely, drowsiness was still rooted in Leyla\u2019s eyes. Matthias stood leaning against the pergola pillar that faced the bench and held what appeared to be women\u2019s shoes in his hand.\u2018Even if it\u2019s only a dream? Isn\u2019t it too weird?\u2019When the question came to mind, her lingering feeling of sleep dissipated.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Duke?\u201d Leyla whispered his name softly because she couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing.Instead of responding, Matthias fished out a cigar from his pocket and tucked it into his mouth.\u00a0The white cigarette smoke wafting off his lips in a single puff proved that this moment could never be a dream.Leyla was so startled. She almost blacked out when she found the shoe in his hand was hers. As she didn\u2019t know what to do, Leyla only could curl down her body to the edge of the bench.Matthias shot an amusing look at her as if she were a sideshow of a sideshow and waved her shoes slowly.\u201cShall I give it back?\u201dHis voice mixed along with the murky tobacco haze.\u201cYes, please.\u201d\u201cThen cry\u2026\u201dStunned. His ludicrous words gave Leyla the creeps and\u00a0left her speechless.She prayed silently that Kyle would come quickly, but the pathway leading to the pergola was deserted.\u201cHe\u2019s not coming.\u201d said Matthias calmly as if he had read her thoughts.\u201cKyle Etman.\u201dHe talked again after he saw Leyla doubting him.\u201cThe one you\u2019re waiting for.\u201dMatthias dropped his half-smoked cigarette butts to the ground. Behind the column of wispy smoke that gradually disappeared, he found Leyla\u2019s face looking up at him in tears.\u201cNo.\u201dNot wanting to show her wounded feet, Leyla rose from her seat and took a confident stance in front of Matthias. Her bare feet were firmly planted on the cold ground. She was still afraid of him, yet, she wasn\u2019t willing to become his laughingstock anymore.\u201cKyle always keeps his words.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou look pretty confident.\u201d\u201cI know more about Kyle than you do.\u201dA grin crept over Matthias\u2019 lips as he watched her muster all of her courage to challenge him.\u201cConfidence is not an arbitrary matter, Leyla.\u201dAlong with his gliding words, Matthias walked a step closer. Leyla\u2019s shoulders cowered in fear, but she refused to back off.\u201cI\u2026. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cWhy do you hate me so much?\u201dUnlike her trembling voice, Leyla looked straight at him with abundantly lucid eyes.\u201cHating you makes me feel good.\u201dMatthias answered calmly, raising one corner of his lips.\u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling when I see you cry, and it\u2019s fun to see you beg.\u201d\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just answering your question.\u201dMatthias seemed blase even though her expression, who stood before him, was already all at sea. Her eyes glazed over due to his insult, but Leyla managed to keep her tears from falling.\u201cYou don\u2019t act like this to anyone other than me.\u201dMatthias willingly nodded, \u201cRight.\u201d\u201cThen why is it only me\u2026.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s you, Leyla. Because you\u2019re nobody.\u201d said Matthias nonchalantly. His calm yet dry voice made Leyla feel even more as if she was a deplorable person.\u201cMy apologies, your grace.\u201dLeyla fought back the tears as she stared at him. She began to miss her relatives, who had evicted her for a variety of reasons. Even his alcoholic uncle had never oppressed her like this.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, because a \u2018nobody\u2019 like me dared to stay in your estate.\u201dNow, not only her voice but also her clenched hands started to quiver.\u201cIf you hated me so much, why did you let me stay on your estate from the beginning?\u201d Leyla demanded to know.\u201cIsn\u2019t that too heartless if I didn\u2019t let you?\u201d\u201cYou are indeed a heartless person.\u201dHer voice continued to whimper, no matter how desperately she attempted to suppress it.\u201cAre you going to rout me out now?\u201d she managed to ask.\u201cNo.\u201d Matthias\u2019s eyes grew darker as he watched her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. You\u2019re doing great in your place.\u201d\u201cYou said I was a nobody.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s your use.\u201dMatthias opened his eyes slowly. The scorny grin on the corner of his lips had rubbed off and his expressionless face now became suffocatingly cold and still.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, let\u2019s cut to the chase.\u201dMatthias raised his head and straightened his back, which had been leaning against the vine-rose pillar.\u201cThe Kyle Etman you\u2019ve been waiting for won\u2019t come.\u201dHe pointed his hand to the empty path behind the pergola. Leyla flinched in fear when his finger unwittingly touched her flowing hair over her shoulder. She took a step back, but the bench blocked her and she couldn\u2019t go any farther.\u201cSo Leyla\u2026..\u201dMatthias reached out his hand. He squeezed and caressed Leyla\u2019s blonde hair soft and took a deeper look at her.\u201cCry.\u201dMatthias gave a callous order calmly.\u201cEven better if you beg.\u201dAlong with his additional suggestion, a faint grin sprouted on Matthias\u2019 lips.\u2018He\u2019s crazy.\u2019Leyla had been debating it for a long time, but she was certain now.The duke was completely insane.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*After Matthias returned to his mansion, Kyle Etman was still being held by his mother.The Baron and Baroness Arundt seemed to like the idea of marrying her daughter into the Etman family. They were very much in favor of becoming in-laws, and Mrs. Etman\u2019s response was not significantly different.Unlike both the pair of parents,\u00a0 Kyle\u2019s demeanor was now noticeably rigid. But his mother didn\u2019t seem to give a damn about how he felt.For whatever reason, Matthias\u2019s interest was drawn back to their tedious family affair. Mixed among recognizable faces, he began playing the role of Arvis master, Duke Herhardt.Leyla cried.A sense of contentment percolated him when he reflected on that moment.That teenage girl trembled. Her face was littered with teardrops as she could no longer contain her indignation. Nevertheless, as the corners of her eyes turned crimson, her moist eyes became prettier and brighter.Leyla Lewellin\u2019s eyes gleamed like an emerald jewel dangling from her neck at those moments.She cried so beautifully, and Matthias loved it.He gladly returned Leyla\u2019s shoes after seeing her beautiful cry.When he was about to leave the garden, Matthias looked back and saw Leyla still standing there crying.That girl cried because of him. So the falling tears from her eyes belonged to him.Thinking of it, Matthias\u2019s steps became lighter.\u00a0\u00a0Tears of Leyla had washed away the displeasure swelling inside him at seeing Kyle Etman escorting her into the mansion. Together with the ineffable feeling, he had the moment he kissed Claudine while staring at Leyla.Tonight, in his world, Leyla looked exceptionally beautiful. And the beautiful, flawless her had cried because of him.\u2018What a perfect summer night.\u2019Matthias encapsulated that satisfactory sensation, just before Leyla had appeared suddenly on the grounds of the mansion.Alone, she loitered on the edge of the aisle that attached the hall to the terrace, carefully looking for someone.\u201cKyle Etman.\u201dMatthias muttered his name.Leyla seemed to have found Kyle among the partygoers. Nonetheless, she didn\u2019t approach him as she had grasped the meaning of the scene where Kyle Etman was surrounded by the Arundt household. Especially, with the presence of Baron Arundt\u2019s youngest daughter.Leyla had been hiding behind the marble pillar for quite some time. Before leaving the terrace, she approached a passing servant and relayed a message to him.The servant nodded his head and headed towards Kyle Etman, whose face had already turned cold as he had reached his limit of patience.But, just as the servant was about to deliver Leyla\u2019s message, Matthias suddenly waylaid him,\u201cPlease call Count Klein.\u201dThe servant widened his eyes at Matthias\u2019s sudden order. For a quick moment, he glanced across to Kyle Etman\u2019s side thoughtfully. But soon, he gave the exact answer Matthias had expected.\u201cYes, master.\u201dTurning his steps, the servant hurried through the crowd to run his master\u2019s errand.Matthias went out onto the terrace and leaned against the pillar where Leyla had been hidden a while ago.In the distance, Leyla was drifting along the promenade that led to the garden\u2019s center in the distance. She walked with a limp; her feet seemed to be in a lot of pain. She later took off her shoes and began wandering barefoot from the middle of the path.Matthias stood quietly, watching her while waiting for his servant.The guy in question-Count Klein was never going to show up. The count was suffering from a neurotic headache and he had already returned home after greeting him briefly earlier in the evening.Concurrently with Leyla disappearing deep into the forest road, the servant he had previously ordered had approached him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, master. Count Klein has already returned home.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dMatthias smiled, nodding his head.\u201cGood job.\u201dAfter acknowledging the servant\u2019s bow, Matthias strolled away from the terrace at a leisurely pace.The servant went back to his previous task, approaching Kyle Etman to deliver Leyla\u2019s message.In two shakes, Kyle\u2019s face was afflicted with a sense of dismay. He rushed out to the terrace after asking for understanding for his urgent need to excuse himself first, but Matthias didn\u2019t mind him.Despite her petite stature, Leyla Lewellin walked pretty fast.\u00a0 It was too late for Kyle to catch up to her.Matthias then went on a binge and joyfully took the glass of champagne presented by Riette.The nightfall was approaching.It was a perfect party on the glitzy night of midsummer.The party was perfect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bill\u2019s brother had passed away. Though the two brothers weren\u2019t close and hadn\u2019t seen each other in years, Bill couldn\u2019t overlook the fact that his brother was one of the only remaining family members he had in this world.Bill decided to take a short break from his job and travel to his hometown for a few days. He had no problem with going there, but his heart was as heavy as steel at the thought of leaving Leyla home all alone.\u201cDon\u2019t forget to lock the door. Don\u2019t leave the windows open, even if it\u2019s hot outside.\u201d Numerous times since last night he had lectured Leyla with the same words of advice.\u201cThe shotgun is hanging in my room\u2026..\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make sure the door and windows are locked, and I\u2019ll put your shotgun next to my sleeping bed. If a bad person turns up, I\u2019m going to shoot them.\u201dLeyla calmly recited the lines that she had repeatedly heard.\u201cI\u2019ll eat well, sleep well, and I\u2019ll be doing well.\u201dBill was only going to be away for three days at most, but his excessive worry made it look like he would be gone for months. Bill reluctantly took his leave, though he still had a concerned look as Leyla followed him to the mansion\u2019s entrance to see him off.\u201cLeyla, did something happen at the party that day?\u201d Bill carefully posed a question after catching a glimpse of the stately mansion building.\u201cNo, there were no problems; I had a great time. Really.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good then, because you seem to be distancing yourself from Kyle after the party.\u201d\u201cMe? From Kyle?\u201d Leyla giggled at his nonsensical words. \u201cAh, we get along fine.\u2026 it\u2019s just, we\u2019ve been busy lately.\u201d\u201cCan I trust what you\u2019re saying?\u201d\u201cYes. Why would I lie?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. There\u2019s no way your friendship with Kyle would get awkward. Then Leyla, if you\u2019re afraid of being alone, you can bring Kyl\u2026. No, no. Pretend you didn\u2019t hear that.\u201d Bill flicked his hand fast. \u201cThat boy is the most dangerous.\u201d\u201cOh, Uncleee !!!.\u201d\u201cGet this through your head, if he comes over to play, make sure he returns before sunset.\u201d\u201cOh c\u2019mon, stop saying strange things, just go right now.\u201d Leyla lovingly swatted him on the back as they arrived in front of the entrance door of the mansion.Bill looked back several times. He kept reiterating his advice before he walked further, crossing the Platanus road.Leyla stood there, on the mansion\u2019s front steps, until Bill was no longer in sight. Every time he turned around Leyla flashed him a smile and happy-trails waves at him.The next three days were going to be a long for her.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cLeyla is avoiding me.\u201dThis time, Kyle was sure.\u201cI think it\u2019s because of the last party.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t difficult to figure out why.\u201cRight Phoebe, that you\u2019re also thinking the same thing?\u201dKyle asked seriously, but Phoebe simply sat on the window frame, pecking at the oats, pretending not to hear. He then sighed deeply as he sounded like a moron babbling to a pigeon.Another disappointing news came in the form of the content of Leyla\u2019s letter, which Phoebe brought back today.Buried within the note wrote that Uncle Bill would be in his hometown for a few days, and Leyla planned to spend the day in the library so that the cottage would be empty.Lately, the type of message he had got had been relatively consistent. She was either going to another friend\u2019s place, or she had an appointment downtown or was helping out in the garden.Kyle first thought she was notifying him rather than making him come into the vacant cottage in vain. But it just seemed like a bunch of excuses at this point\u2014a slew of clumsy reasons to avoid Kyle Etman.\u201cI don\u2019t blame her. If that had happened to me, I would do the same.\u201d Sighed Kyle, ruffling his hair.Before attending the party, he proudly stated that he was her partner and promised to protect her. Yet, the truth was quite the opposite. He\u2019d forgotten about her. After hearing the servant saying that Leyla had left the party, he dashed out of the hall, but alas, she had already gone.Kyle bemoaned to himself why he hadn\u2019t been able to leave the party hall sooner. He was the one that told her to wait first though. But he was the one who didn\u2019t follow through with his own promise.Phoebe flew away after finishing its meal, leaving Kyle, who was nervously wandering around his room, alone.Behind the window bar, Kyle stared in the direction the pigeon was heading in and impulsively stormed out of the room.He didn\u2019t remember how he got on the bike and started pedalling. All he could think of on the way there until he was out of breath was Leyla.Kyle arrived at Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage just as his heart was about to burst with thoughts full of her. His shoulders swayed up and down as he grappled to quieten the rhythm of his gasping breath in the sweltering heat.In the backyard, there were still dripping white sheets and pillowcases hanging on the clothesline. And beyond it, he could see a shadow of a woman with a delicate yet slender body shape.The sense of relief and compunction both melted away.Kyle savoured every taste of the moment while gently brushing his sweaty hair behind his forehead.Leyla slowly revealed her face behind the sheet just then, as though she sensed his presence, and her green eyes grew round with astonishment when she met eyes with him.\u201c\u2026\u2026 Kyle.\u201dThe tender voice which flowed through her dainty lips was sweet enough to make him forget about the embarrassing situation.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cSorry.\u201dAfter a long silence in front of the table facing Leyla, Kyle then opened his mouth and apologized profusely first. Leyla, who had been staring at her fingertips with her head down, abruptly lifted her eyes.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d\u201cNo. Don\u2019t say that.\u201d Leyla shook her head. She felt bad having heard his heartfelt apology. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. I\u2019m sorry I lied to you.\u201d\u201cNo Leyla, it\u2019s because of me. It\u2019s all my fault.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I\u2019m not upset or mad at you. I\u2019m serious, Kyle.\u201d\u201cThen is there another reason? Why\u2026. You\u2019re avoiding me\u2026 something you don\u2019t want to tell me?\u201d\u201cYou know, Kyle, you\u2019re like my family and a brother to me, and I like you that way. So\u2026..so I think we should distance ourselves now.\u201dLeyla tugged the corners of her lips, trying to smile casually, yet it wasn\u2019t what she had expected after looking at Kyle\u2019s expression.She was pretty sincere when she said that she was not angry or upset with him. But that night, at that dreamlike party, Leyla noticed the wall between their world.Between Kyle and herself, there was a boundary line that she couldn\u2019t go across just because they were friends.Leyla had already realized that she wasn\u2019t deserving of being seen with the son of a prominent family. But she would\u2019ve never thought the chasm between her vague thoughts and the sight of the reality that splashed across before her was too painfully ruthless.An heir of a well-known family of doctors who could easily blend in with upper-class nobility. Kyle Etman, the man Leyla saw that day in the duke\u2019s opulent banquet hall, was a man who resided in a world beyond that dividing line.That Kyle Etman was no longer a child who used to play with her.Why should a child grow up and become an adult?That night, Leyla pondered the transparent and sad question as she walked along the dark forest path with her shoes in her hand.After that, she made up her mind.To accept the time she had passed through.And even in that passing time, she decided to accept it as the only way to protect her precious friend.\u201cDo you know that you\u2019re spouting nonsense now?\u201dKyle, who had been deafeningly still until that moment spoke up in a lowered and calmed tone.\u201cNo. I mean it.\u201d\u201cWhy do we have to be apart when we like each other?\u201d\u201cBecause only in this way will we be able to remain good friends for a long time. Kyle, I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d\u201cYou think I also want to lose you?\u201dKyle\u2019s eyes shook as he looked at her.\u201cHow can we be apart? That can\u2019t be, Leyla.\u201d\u201cKyle.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll never lose you. I won\u2019t even stay away from you. How can you say that?\u201d Kyle slammed the glass cup down on the table and clenched his fist tightly.You can\u2019t do that, Kyle.Leyla was just smiling\u2019 instead of revealing what she meant to say.\u2018It\u2019s time to become an adult.\u2019Leyla gulped down the thorny words and sprung from her chair.\u201cLet\u2019s have lunch, Kyle.\u201dShe hurriedly reattached the apron she had taken off earlier ago.\u201cAs an apology for lying, \u2014I\u2019ll make you a very delicious lunch.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cMatthias, can\u2019t you just discharge from the military already and focus on your family\u2019s business now?\u201dRiette lay down on the sofa as he put down the newspaper he had just read. He tilted his head while yawning, and saw Matthias sitting on the wing chair reading a book.\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad spending a year or two in the military division.\u201dMatthias gave a smooth reply while flipping the book\u2019s page. Even in this sweltering summer afternoon, he stayed dressed in his suit and tie in his bedroom.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a Herhardt family tradition, after all.\u201dRiette muttered to himself as he stretched listlessly.\u201cMatthias von Herhardt will be the most perfect Duke of Arvis, surpassing any of his forefathers.\u201dWhile Riette chuckled, the canary, who had been happily playing in the cage, suddenly spread its wings. The bird soared lightly and landed on the book that Matthias was reading.Matthias\u2019s face lit up as he looked at the chirping bird. It seemed that the bird was having a chat with him.It was quite an astounding scene for Riette, who had watched Matthias shoot and kill birds without even batting an eye on the hunting grounds for years.\u201cI hope that bird is a she, Matthias.\u201d Riette laughed as he shook his head. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, it would gross me out.\u201dMatthias reached his hand out to the bird without answering. The little bird tilted its head from side to side and softly rubbed its beak against the tip of his finger.\u201cDon\u2019t you think so, Claudine?\u201dRiette shifted his focus to Claudine, who was busy embroidering on the sofa across from them. She looked at Matthias, and his bird with an embroidery hoop on her hands and a faint grin crept over her expressionless face.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that birds with beautiful voices are usually male.\u201d\u201cUgh. Please, Claudine. Let\u2019s just believe it\u2019s a female.\u201d Riette jokingly shuddered. \u201cIt creeps me out to think of them interacting like that if they\u2019re both male.\u201dClaudine chuckled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? It\u2019s just a bird.\u201d She picked up the needle to continue her stitching.Matthias only turned the page after the bird bounced away from his book. He looked unconcerned even when the bird flew around bothering him, hopping on his hands, shoulders, and head.\u201cYou should wear a light yellow dress at the engagement party, Claudine. Duke Herhardt might adore you as much as that bird.\u201d\u201cNever.\u201d Claudine riposted on a dime. \u201cI hate yellow.\u201dAfter taking a deep breath, she went back to her needlework. \u201cThat color, it looks vulgar.\u201d She added with a bit of scoff.A strange smile bloomed on Riette\u2019s lips, who was pretending as if he had not heard that. Later on, he quit talking about the bird and began to rattle on about Matthias\u2019s military service and the upcoming engagement ceremony instead.\u201cOur little lady Claudine will soon be the lady who beat the royal princess.\u201d\u201cYour excessive flattery embarrasses me, Riette.\u201dClaudine smiled brightly even though her eyebrows were frowning.It was an open truth that the Berg Emperor coveted Duke Herhardt as his son-in-law.The emperor had a special affection for his youngest daughter. Moreover, the princess was a beautiful lady known as the \u201cFlower of the Socialites.\u201d Claudine, who was considered the next Duchess of Arvis for granted since childhood, felt a sense of crisis because of the princess.But Claudine triumphed in the end. Though she didn\u2019t win because of love.\u2018Matthias doesn\u2019t have to.\u2019That brief remark summed up the reasons for not becoming in-laws with the imperial family.Herhardt was a household with history, wealth, and honour that were no less than the emperor\u2019s.\u00a0It was reasonable to state that the hassle of serving the princess was greater than the benefit of having her as a duchess.It sounded so arrogant. But such arrogance was pardoned when it was placed before Herhardt\u2019s name.Thanks to that, Claudine Brandt was regarded as the lady who outshone the emperor\u2019s daughter.It was easy to see why the Herhardts chose her. She was the only daughter of an illustrious count who lacked a successor. The Herhardt\u2019s must have viewed Claudine as a bride-in-law with a fine pedigree and dowry comparable to that of the princess, but one who didn\u2019t have to be served like a royal.Regardless of the substance, Claudine Brandt\u2019s name would be positioned higher than Berg\u2019s royal princess when the engagement ceremony took place. The thought made Claudine feel like she could love everything in this world. Including that vulgar little bird.\u201cI can\u2019t believe the engagement of two people right in front of me is just around the corner. It gives me a strange feeling.\u201dRiette sat up straight and gently extended his arms in a shrug.Claudine looked at him serenely before returning to her unfinished embroidery work.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In hindsight, nothing had changed in his plan. At least until he left the annex.Matters were thrown into disarray after he twisted his body to look behind and found himself standing on the road leading to the gardener\u2019s cottage.Matthias halted, pausing in his footsteps with a pensive look on his face.The days had marched on as they should. Everything went off without a hitch and in an orderly fashion.Her tears on that night had also been washed away and cleaned off all traces of his foreign feeling.Matthias expanded his stride and strolled through the shady forest path. He tugged at his tie and loosened it, then pushed open a few buttons on his tight-fitting shirt. His gestures were a bit rougher, and he wasn\u2019t as calm as he always was.It was sickening.He loathed these emotions that were out of his track.It was aggravating for him to be plagued with feelings he couldn\u2019t curb.Mathias wanted everything in his world to be in its place. So did his own feelings. That\u2019s the reason why he had never been enamored of a creature called a woman.In his orbit, the lust for sex was simply an instinct. He had never dwelled on it or been swayed by it.Rather, it was cumbersome-nothing more than a need to be adequately satisfied and dried away. Such desires, to begin with, didn\u2019t rule the roost in his mind.That\u2019s how the annoyance and discomfort he felt because of Leyla grew and wreaked havoc on his stable world.Only she now could be in his world.His whole five senses were fixed on her and blinding passion welled up deep inside him uncontrollably.\u00a0There were oftentimes when his gluttonous desire and lustful thoughts to possess her became too much for him to handle.Matthias was displeased as he learned he was obsessed with such trivial things. He couldn\u2019t even put it on his list of priorities.Leyla Lewellin was a good-for-nothing who belonged to that league.Still, he needed to make sure.The long line of the forest trees gradually petered out as the cottage building grew closer.Pondering, Matthias walked into the blanket of light. The jolly beam of summer sunlight was drifting down, permeating his eyes through the slats of twigs.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla had found a baby bird sprawled on the ground.She was traveling home after sending Kyle off when she suddenly heard the sound of a helpless squeal.Leyla spotted a fallen baby bird under a tree in the backyard. A tiny, fragile nestling that had just recently had it\u2019s feathers begin to grow.\u201cOh, did you fall?\u201dLeyla wrapped the baby bird with a careful touch and raised her eyes, looking up at the tree.Precisely as she had thought, there was a bird\u2019s nest sited in one of the tree\u2019s limbs. The tree loomed quite high, but thankfully, the baby bird wasn\u2019t severely injured.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201dLeyla petted the baby bird gently and tucked it into her apron\u2019s pocket. She hurried back to the cottage to take the ladder stashing in the warehouse.She securely leaned the ladder against the tree and started climbing up.The nest was nestled between branches higher than the ladder, so she had no choice but to clamber further.Climbing that high usually had never been a problem for her. But with the baby bird in her pocket, Leyla became more circumspect in her movements and couldn\u2019t be as nimble as usual.After ascending the closest bough to the bird\u2019s nest, Leyla snatched the branch with one hand and thrust the other into her pocket.She painstakingly stretched her arms as far as she could and safely handed back the baby bird to its nest.Too bad, just as she breathed a sigh of relief, her foot suddenly slipped off, and she lost her grip on the branch.The world spun upside down in a split second as her body bounced and lost its balance. She had managed to grab the branch\u2019s end and hold it tight, but the ladder had dropped to the ground. Alas, the branch that was too weak to support her body weight, started making a crackling sound.\u201cUncleeee! Uncle Billlll!\u201dThe terrified Leyla reflexively screamed aloud. But her shout was met by the silence that she realized Uncle Bill wasn\u2019t at home.\u201cKyleee!\u201dThough she knew Kyle had walked too far and couldn\u2019t hear it, Leyla kept crying and calling out to him. Kyle was her only hope when Uncle Bill wasn\u2019t here. Because they were the only ones who would come to help her when she was in trouble.\u201cLeyla.\u201dSuddenly, a familiar voice appeared out of nowhere.The mellow voice called out her name softly as if singing a song.Her mind had turned white with fear, but Leyla could still recognize the owner of the voice. She lowered her frightened gaze, and someone she knew was standing right below her.Duke Herhardt.With an unbothered state\u2013his eyes strayed at the fallen ladder and calmly watched her hanging precariously on the half-broken tree branch.He laughed, asking her.\u201cShall I save you?\u201d\u2018That crazy person, why does he \u2026?\u2019\u201cNo need!\u201dEven amidst her fear, Leyla flatly refused his offer of help. She persisted in holding onto the tree branch though she knew her tries were fruitless.The branch began to shake even more showing how rickety it was quickly becoming as the crack became deeper.\u201cKyle! Kyleeee!\u201dHer cries mingled with fright, calling for Kyle reverberated through the Arvis\u2019 forest.Matthias giggled at a peek. He turned to look down the path that the young man had gone.\u201cHe\u2019s not coming.\u201dHe said and relaxedly folded his arms.\u2018No matter how heartless he is, doesn\u2019t he feel the least bit concerned when he sees people in danger?\u2019Leyla soon understood that astounding fact about the person standing before her. He was Duke of Herhardt. That insane duke wouldn\u2019t be able to have a reasonable mind like a normal person.\u201cGo away!\u201dShe snapped at him in annoyance and shooed him away.\u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to help, just go! Why are you still standing there!\u201d\u201cIt seems you\u2019re gonna fall, I\u2019ll call someone to save you.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not such a heartless person, Leyla.\u201d Matthias\u2019s lips curved into a drowsy grin. \u201cI\u2019ll call Mr. Etman, whom you were calling desperately.\u201d\u2018You dipshit.\u2019His voice could no longer be heard as the noise of her panting breath had drowned it out.\u201cWell, let me see, what am I gonna do? Looking at the height, I think It\u2019s better to call Dr. Etman instead.\u201d\u2018Goddammit.\u2019Leyla felt she had every reason for mowing him down with a hail of the most virulent cusses, if only her position right now didn\u2019t hinder her from doing so.\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Sa, save me!\u201dLeyla wailed in despair.Rather than begging the man in front of her, she would rather crumble to the ground and be wounded.That\u2019s all she thought before her fear compelled her to forego her principles.\u201cAre you sure?\u201dMatthias asked, leisurely taking off his coat.\u201cCall me, then.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCall me.\u201dHe took a few steps closer to the tree before coming to a stop and staring longingly at her.As if he were waiting.Waiting for the moment of her fall if his demand\u00a0 would not be met. Leyla freaking knew it, that he was a man capable of those deeds.\u201cDuke, please!\u201dLeyla begged him with teary eyes and her voice miserably sobbing.\u201cDukeeee!\u201dHer plea grew more despondent as the moment for her fall drew nearer.After she hailed him for the millionth time, the branch ended up broken.She fell.Leyla\u2019s mind went blank. Her vision became hazy as her body floated down from the tree.Then he cometh.Matthias ran hell for leather towards the tree and embraced her deeply in his arms. Their bodies bumped onto the ground but Matthias refused to let go, and kept hugging her with all his might.The dirt and dust brume clouding them colliding on the soil gradually dissipated. Leyla\u2019s head was buzzing, but slowly she got her consciousness back.Soft.It felt pillowy and unbelievably cozy even though she had fallen from a elevated place.Leyla opened her eyes. The warmth she felt belonged to a man, whom she had unknowingly hugged tightly.Duke Herhardt lay underneath her. And she was blanketed safe and sound in the his arms.She could feel the sound of his beating heart transmitted to her chest that were intimately in touch with each other.His arm muscles wounded around her waist and the back of her head stoutly, were incredibly strong.As she slowly raised her head, a faint minty scent of water could be smelled from the nape of his neck. His skin was smooth and warm, and mantled with a wonderful fragrance.The heat, which had started from her cheek, quickly dispersed throughout her body in no time.It gave Leyla a startled shudder when her body started to reheat. She wrestled her hardest to escape from him.Glossing over the shame as their bodies were entwined in a close knot.\u00a0 He was too big and too hefty. Matthias\u2019 bondage had only gottem stronger the harder she tried to secede.\u201cSsst..Stay still.\u201dMatthias ordered her with a low sigh.\u00a0 But Leyla\u2019s resistance grew fiercer.\u2018No.\u2019She was fed up. Her blood was boiling.\u2018What a jerk. I don\u2019t want to.\u2019Leyla tried to scream, but she didn\u2019t get a single word in.Matthias\u2019s choking embrace which was trapping her, meanwhile became growingly hot. His head and waist hugging her were ever mightier. All of those strange yet unfamiliar sensations were getting awol to her and Leyla couldn\u2019t take it any longer.She was scared shitless and desperately tried to break free. But the more she wanted to resist, the more helpless she felt. Whatever she did, Leyla couldn\u2019t push herself off of him.The moment her delusion soon coalesced with her worst dread, without heed of, she blindly bit the duke\u2019s ear.\u201cAckh!\u201dMatthias grimaced in pain and straight off shoved her backward. He was dumbfounded, but soon, his mouth twisted in a pucker of amusement.Matthias found it hilarious watching her trembling so badly when she was the one who had savagely assaulted him.Leyla\u2019s vivid green eyes glared at him ferociously, acting as she wanted to rip him into pieces. Matthias stopped laughing.\u201cBe a lady, Leyla.\u201dMatthias lightly caressed his bitten ear\u2014 immediately grabbed Leyla by the hair without batting an eye.Without reflexes, she had been pushed to the ground. Matthias\u2019 visage loomed above her, glowering at her with his void-slitted eyes.\u201cSo this is what I get in return after saving your life? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too unladylike?\u201d\u201cWhy should I be ladylike when you\u2019re not even a gentleman?\u201dLeyla turned her face aside. Embarrassment was splotching her cheeks with red color as she tried to push his body one more time. But Matthias had snatched her chin with his scorching-hot hand and dragged her face to his.\u201cDidn\u2019t your mouth just say I was a gentleman?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u2026 No! I misspoke!\u201d\u201cDid you?\u201d\u201cA gentleman, huh. It\u2019s hogwash. If you\u2019re a gentleman\u2026.H-How can you d-do \u2026this?\u201dLeyla stammered with a face that was going to break into tears and struggled to get away from him.Matthias\u2019s eyes narrowed. A small furrow formed between his eyebrows as he looked at Leyla rubbing her lips as if they had been polluted with something filthy.\u201cPlease step aside.\u201dLeyla glared at him with a sullen look invading her face.\u201cSomething like this, I\u2026\u2026Argh!\u201dA shrill scream came out,\u00a0 letting the last syllable hang in the air. Matthias had lowered his head and bit back her ear.All happened in a snap, almost unexpectedly.With a relentless thud, Matthias slammed her onto the earth. He gripped her clawing little hand, hindered her move, and roughed up her ear.\u201cAckhhh!\u201dHer shrieking breath fell when Matthias began to suck and nibble on her lobe.Matthias initially planned to repay what she had granted him, but he had changed his mind and pushed her with a tenacious force.Leyla groaned and twisted her body when he bit her clammy earlobe hard. The sound of sobbing and gasping was muggy and ovenlike. Matthias weight-pressed her flailing limbs and branded his teeth\u2019 mark all over her reddish ears.A satisfied smile presented on his face after he saw Leyla\u2019s messy countenance.Her innocent eyes were soggy, transparently swollen with tears. Her slightly open lips, which were even darker than its hackneyed shade, gulped in a lungful of heavy air.Matthias tightly clutched her crumbly intertwined fingers and sensuously devoured her moist lips.Astonished by his sudden kiss, Leyla firmly clenched her lips, but Matthias had easily dispatched her resistance.This sweltering summer would end by soon enough.Matthias perfectly got the picture. Still, it didn\u2019t stop him.He kept shoving his hasty tongue in, sucked it up, and swallowed it as if he meant to engulf her.Pellucid saliva, moaning voice, and rough breathing began to flow through their overlapping lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2727 Tore It Out, Crushed It Up, and Threw It \u2727Whenever Leila struggled, Matthias increased the strength of his hold and Leyla desperately resisted as he did so.What was plastered over her sight every time she opened her tightly closed eyes was only a fickle scene.The shaking leaves\u2026The unfolding sky\u2026and Matthias\u2026.The dirty floor, wherein the leaves\u2019 silhouettes flickered over it, and him again.The yellowish dust clumped onto and canopied them in a sandy shroud. Their passionate kissing came perilously close to a brawl.At some point, Leyla didn\u2019t even know what she was up to. The fear of not breathing and the necessity of needing to do so were grouped into one.On the flip side, the duke\u2019s attempt to suck her lips and tangle her tongue with his only seemed to flare more. Leyla had no choice but to resigned herself defeatedly as if she were a living prey that was being had been consumed by a predator.Her breath became weak and thready at the brachial. She cried out in heartbreak when Matthias\u2019 desirous lips started to travel her scruff quickly and strongly.A flurry of buttons scattered as he tore off her blouse, revealing her slender clavicle. His lips persistently provoked one specific spot on her neck where her pulse was beating.His hand that had fondled her thighs and waist, tardily made its way up and grappled her luscious bosoms.\u201cAh\u2026 !\u201dLeyla shook her head hard and yanked on Matthias\u2019 shirt. The ripped button on his shirt bounced on the ground. She scratched his skin with her sharp nails, stamping red streaks on his neck several times.The red hickey engraved by Matthias\u2019 lips one by one began to garnish her clavicle. Tears sprung to her eyes as his lips began to trail down her collarbone.Leyla\u2019s mind went numb.Matthias\u2019s body heat, which came into contact with hers, did give her a discombobulation and novel feeling.She was afraid and baffled as to why she had to go through this nightmare.Matthias, thankfully, was able to put a stop to his deeds. He bowed his head and glanced down at her, one arm supporting his body.Leyla opened her eyes; Matthias\u2019 gasp was still erratically rough, but his eyes didn\u2019t seem to be those of a man engrossed in lust.His eyes were deep and serene. Akin to the day he stomped on a coin or the moment he calmly shot a bird to death. The way he looked at her made Leyla\u2019s face flush in indignation.Matthias placed his stare on her for a few seconds. He drew his eyes closed and slowly opened them. The wriggling of his Adam\u2019s apple had ceased as he got a grip on his breathing a little.The forest wind randomly fluttered Leyla\u2019s hair into a complete mess. The smooth golden waves hovered in front of him as he lowered his gaze.Matthias wiped off the dirt from his hands, then twisted his body to the side.He carefully took in his surroundings.A woman who was lying under the shade of a tree and sobbing.A yard with a clothesline loaded with freshly dried laundry.The old cottage that stood alone.And he who was seated in this ludicrous world with a screwed-up appearance.Matthias scoffed faintly and swept his drooping hair off his forehead. Beside him, Leyla curled up her body in a circle, trying to suck in more air.\u201d Pfft..Ha..ha..ha\u2026\u201dThe moment he saw her battered figure riddled with dust, Matthias\u2019s laughter, became more and more devastating to her ears.\u2018You.\u2019Drawing in a long breath, Matthias wiped his damp lips with the back of his hand. There was a splotch of blood.\u2018Just because of a nobody like you.\u2019When he turned to look behind him, Leyla had already bolted to the bottom of the tree. She glared at him vehemently and scrunched the picked-up tree branch with her quivering hands.Tears were still dripping from her gleaming eyes.Matthias lifted himself from the ground after receiving such a menacing glare from a woman who was doing the same thing to him. He gazed down, hushedly, at his hand, which had recently grabbed a handful of toasty soil.\u2018You may not know. I truly wanted to wring your little neck with this hand.\u2019Mathias turned around unhesitatingly after having grabbed his coat.Summer in Berg was brief.When the time was ripe, a cold breeze would blow, and the seasons would change in a jiffy.Mathias was no stranger to it.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla was only able to get up after Duke Herhardt was no longer in sight.She picked up her glasses and put them on. Both of her legs seemed to rumble. She walked stumbling, trembling, tripping, and had to take several break before she finally reached the cottage.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have fallen to the ground.\u2019The tears beaded down her cheeks with great regrets. The unpleasant taste was still there, no matter how many times she cleaned her lips with her hand or her apron.Leyla strolled over to the water tap and pumped it hard. The cold water spilled out of the bucket because of the pressure, soaking her clothes but she didn\u2019t care.\u201c\u2026No.\u201dShe muttered, unsure about what exactly she was trying to deny.\u2018No. No. No.\u2019Leyla shook her head. The bucket was full as her irregular breathing mingled with those repetitive sentences.She covered her shaking hands and looked around nervously as if she were being hunted by something.But, everything was the same.It was Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage. The homiest place in the world. The place she endlessly loved.The wind ruffled the leaves, and birds sang while perched on the tree\u2019s slats. The backdrop of the forest looked beautifully dazzling and still as the time neared the sunset, bathing everything in a golden shaft of light.But Leyla\u2019s heart kept throbbing uneasily. She was mystified with what she denied but also didn\u2019t know what she was afraid of.One thing was clear though. She had to get away from all this.Leyla took off her glasses and washed her face repeatedly with the water-filled bucket. She wiped the nape of her neck which was mottled with red marks. She continued to clean her ears, yet the finer traces that he left behind were still vivid.The overcast sky appeared so buff, Leyla stared at it with a blank look on her face.She suddenly clenched her teeth, lifted the bucket, and submerged herself with cold water. Her body trembled with a chill as the water washed her down from the head to toe.Leyla drew water from the tap again, shaking, as she was fed up with the unpleasant memory of her persistent survival. This time, she thoroughly rinsed all over her mouth with her palms full of water.Cough!Splashing water, she thought, would flush away those memories. But it was no use. She still recalled that nasty and absurd things.Cough! Cough!Leyla stopped washing. Her throat choked as she had accidentally swallowed the water.She crouched, crying, before pumping more water from the tap.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias took a leisurely walk around the garden before stopping at the periphery where the rose flower bed garden and the marble stairwell leading to the manor were assembled.Though he had brushed the dust off his clothing, the remnants of it still could be seen in every place. For it was of no account to him. The problem was his memory. Those memories only became more clear whenever he took a step at a time.When Leyla huddled in his arms, any semblance of his rationality evanesced. There was nothing but a hunger-like thirstiness to have her; as if he had morphed into a wild beast.Matthias licked his lips and batted his bangs aside from his forehead. He sought to see how and where this lascivious desire would stop.If that nobody woman, Leyla, hadn\u2019t cried, it would have been meaningless, vain, and ultimately insignificant.If only he could restrain himself. If only he could refrain from hurling abuse at such a woman.\u00a0Perhaps\u2026..Rearing his head, Matthias saw the mansion sitting in the tawny sun of the afternoon. Behind him, the forest across the garden seemed to be a desolate world cloaked in stillness.It was quiet.Something stood by itself in a place of nothingness.A hankering interest and ruling passion for a beautiful woman. Matthias haltingly closed his eyes as if erasing something silly that was bothering him.He opened them again and plucked a cluster of roses in full bloom which resembled her tears.From his grasp, the pungent scent of crushed roses spread thickly, poking the nose. It had a pleasing redolence that reminded him of that woman\u2019s body odor.He tore it, crushed it, and threw it.The torn and broken rose petals fell scattered strand by strand at his feet in a lumbering pace.The memory of a girl passing through this garden came to his mind one after another along with the fallen petals.Every time he returned home to the Arvis manor, that child always grew up more hearty.A full-blooming rose meadow had become a familiar sight in the neighborhood where the child resided.As the winter months came, the flower bed was peacefully carpeted with snow. Seasons continued to be repeated, the time elapsed, and the girl did grow up and turned into woman like a sequence of scenes.By the end of the day, however, it was all for naught.Matthias fondled his lips with the rose-scented hand and strode over the flake of petals.As the sun began to set, a cool breeze blew clemently, foretelling the end of the summer.Matthias never looked back as he climbed the stairwell and entered the blinding artificial light of the mansion.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The sky on the western horizon, where the sun had returned to its nest like the doves was now tinged with deep purple hues.The darkness ploddingly inked across the room, but Kyle didn\u2019t switch the lamplights on. He leaned deeply on a chair by the window, his gaze reared at the sky, which was continuously shifting its radiant shade.Ever since coming back from the Arvis\u2019 cottage, Kyle had been confined to his room. Without a playful grin teased on his lips, his grayish eyes gave a shady cold nuance.He ate lunch with Leyla in a friendly setting. Kyle didn\u2019t say no because she was trying to act as usual.But he knew. Their time together wasn\u2019t the same as before.If he can\u2019t find a solution any sooner, he\u2019d have to let her go.Kyle wiped down his dry face with his hand as if washing it.Leyla said that she wished for them to remain good friends for a long time. And to stay as friends, they should keep their distance.He finally grasped the meaning of it. Yet, Kyle had a very different plan. Surely, he wanted to spend a long time with her, but not as a good friend in disguise.Thereby, he was unable to wait for long.Kyle took a hard stance after he came to that conclusion. He didn\u2019t want to squander those happy days with Leyla, so it was time to let go of his unseeable feelings.Taking a deep breath, Kyle opened the door and stomped down through the corridor.A dim light glinted, seeping beyond the door of his father\u2019s study. Kyle reassured himself in front of the door before drawing yet another breath.At the duke\u2019s party, Kyle got the gist of his mother\u2019s reason for presenting him to the aristocracy. He didn\u2019t have the faintest notion of what was going through his mother\u2019s mind when she was considering engagement or marriage at the time, but today, he was rather grateful for that, somehow.\u2018I can\u2019t lose you. Or be apart from each other. How can we do that?\u2019Mulling on the words he said to Leyla, Kyle knocked on the door vigorously.\u201cFather, it\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cCome on in, Kyle.\u201dHe heard his father\u2019s warm and loving voice beyond the door. Encouraged by his sweetness, Kyle slowly opened the door to the study. Dr. Etman, who sat in front of the desk, smiled as he welcomed his son.Instead of slumping in the chair across his father\u2019s desk like he usually did, Kyle stood upright in front of his father.\u201cI have something to tell you, father,\u201d he said.\u201cThis isn\u2019t something you usually do. It\u2019s quite a serious thing to say, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKyle clenched his fists tightly to muster up his courage.When push came to shove, he was going to say this anyway.He heartened himself and swallowed.Next year, he will enroll in the college and leave for the capital. And Leyla, on the other hand, had planned on staying in this city and pursuing a career as a teacher.Distance would separate them for a long time.Kyle, however, wasn\u2019t quite convinced with just that. The fact that there would come a day when Kyle Etman wouldn\u2019t be standing next to Leyla Lewellin.He pondered upon this.What if they both went to college together? How about they studied as medical and ornithology students at the same time? And what if they lived together for the rest of their lives as they had been? As friends, lovers, and family.\u201cMother seems to be thinking about my marriage nowdays.\u201dDr. Etman soon let loose a short lived barking yet delightful laugh at what Kyle said.\u201cThat day, your mother went a little ahead of herself. Don\u2019t let it bother you too much, Kyle. I understand your mother\u2019s feelings, but I disagree with her. There\u2019s no need to hurry.\u201d\u201cNo, father.\u201dKyle looked at his father with a determined glance.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of getting married.\u201d\u201cMarriage? Kyle? You?\u201d Dr. Etman\u2019s eyes creased slowly as he faced his son.\u201cYes.\u201dKyle replied with a nervous but laid-back voice.\u201cI want to marry Leyla and go to college with her.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She jolted by\u00a0the owls hooting\u00a0and suffered from the suddenly-flashing nightmares. The duke\u2019s countenance often dawned between dreams of her being beaten or thrown away. The memory of their kiss littered along tirelessly, and deepened in her dreams like a glutinous swamp.The first blush of the morning rose and each passing day seemed so long and eternally lasting. Leyla occupied herself and kept moving without taking a single break.She took care of the livestock, tended to the lawn, and swept and polished everywhere in the already spotless cottage. She washed all the curtains and bedding and even organized the warehouse. Reading a book or studying was the only chore she gave something a miss: as her eyes, strangely, couldn\u2019t draw a bead on the book\u2019s prose.Leyla had spent the whole day alone, pacing until the nightfall brought upon her another nightmare.On the morning of the fourth day, she went out to take care of the backyard, tightly knotting the apron\u2019s string behind her.Everything was so mind-numbing.Bill Remmer regularly spent most of his day at work. Apart from helping him with his job, Leyla went through her everyday chores and studies.Living together didn\u2019t mean that everything could be done together. They just sat at the same table, returned to the same warm house in the evening, shared stories from their days, and so on\u2026\u201cThis is the first time.\u201dLeyla murmured pensively at\u00a0the flash of realization.Ever since she was driven to Berg, she hadn\u2019t led a single day apart from Uncle Bill. He had always been by her side, and there was never a day that she was alone. Bill Remmer was always there with her, at both day-peep and eventide, like a clockwork.But now, she was on her own.The realization that\u00a0Leyla Lewellin had realized over the span of four days\u00a0brought her another realization. It enlightened her: how lonely, sad, and afraid she was when she wandered in this world, all alone.Leyla plodded a step back after momentarily standing idly. While feeding the chickens and milking the goats, she kept taking a glance across the yard.Her fondest wish for Uncle Bill\u2019s return had grown into a sincere prayer. She was pretty sure much of her perplexity and frustration would wither away once he returned. Her loneliness, her teen sadness, the loathsome memory of her first kiss could be forgotten with someone to keep her company.Everything was going to be okay, and things would go\u00a0back to the way they were before.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cKyle Etman.\u201dKyle looked back, startled after someone suddenly hailed his name from behind. His father had already loomed behind his chair.\u201cYes, father.\u201dKyle hurried to his feet. A book remained open on the same page for several days on his desk. The page hadn\u2019t been flipped since the evening when he\u00a0announced he would marry Leyla to his father.\u201cYou\u2019re home early.\u201dKyle alternated between staring out the still-bright window and at his father\u2019s face. Dr. Etman\u2019s lips bent into a gentle smile when he saw his son\u2019s darting eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a weekend, Kyle.\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, already?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t ask what you\u2019re thinking. I think I know even if you don\u2019t tell me.\u201dDr. Etman mumbled a laugh and leaned in the chair where Kyle was flumping a while ago. It was his quirk whenever his father had something to tell. Kyle pulled a chair in front of the table and sat facing his father, a little nervous.His father hadn\u2019t answered and was silent on that very day. After giving Kyle a long stare, all he said was\u00a0to give him a few days to think about it.. Kyle was mindful that there was no use of daring to talk when his father had expressed himself in such a manner and tone.Hence, he did nothing but wait. Though his desire tempted him to sprint towards her in that split second. So Kyle endured it and wasted his days living in a slow-moving damn clock. Because he didn\u2019t want to hurt Leyla by giving her ambiguous promises.\u201cI completely understand how you feel. I know how much you love Leyla. But Kyle, you and her are still too young to talk about marriage.\u201d\u201cBut father, you married mother when you entered medical school, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThat was already 20 years ago.\u201d\u201cLady Brandt is only a year older than Leyla, and she\u2019s getting engaged next week.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cLady Arundt, who was introduced by mother, is also the same age as Leyla.\u201dSeeing Kyle refute every single one of his words with a stiff face, Dr. Etman\u2019s laughter eventually burst out, \u201cIt seems, you\u2019re more serious than I thought.\u201d\u201cFather, I know I\u2019m still young. I also understand what worries you.\u201d\u201cDo you love Leyla so much that you\u2019re willing to sacrifice anything for her?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Kyle\u00a0answered with no hesitation. For him, loving her was as natural as breathing. And so, it wasn\u2019t even necessary to take it for granted.\u201cI can help Leyla go to college by becoming her sponsor.\u201dWith a stern yet loving gaze, Dr. Etman looked at his beloved son dearly,\u201cLeyla is a good child. She\u2019s good-minded and smart. I know her well, Kyle, and I\u2019m willing to sponsor her to go to college if she wants to.\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m really hoping Leyla can continue in her favorite field of study. But father, what I want the most is to marry her.\u201d\u201cIt takes more than two people to make a marriage happen.\u201d\u201cHousehold, dignity and prestige. I\u2019m not saying that those things are unimportant.\u201d\u201cSo, how come you\u2019re so obstinate?\u201d\u201cNo matter how important those things are, Father, there can\u2019t be something more important than the person who will be with you for the rest of your life.\u201d\u201cKyle.\u201d\u201cI want to be a great doctor, as well as a good husband and father. As much as you. But, Father, everything starts with Leyla for me.\u201d Kyle said. His heart started to pound, almost as if it wanted to ball out of his chest. But he suppressed it and began to broach about all the things he had kept under his hat for years.\u201cI want to live with Leyla, by her side, as Leyla\u2019s good person, her good husband, the good father of her child.\u201dHis heart now felt like it would burst open,\u00a0but Kyle went on to say.\u201cIf I have Leyla by my side, I firmly believe that I can make all of that happen, but father, without her, those things are just a pie in the sky.\u201dHe spelled back to his father in a firm, unwavering tone.\u201cWithout her, I don\u2019t have the confidence to live as such a person.\u201dKyle raised his head to see his father; his hands clamped together on his lap.\u201cI believe Leyla is a woman who meets both her father\u2019s and mother\u2019s expectations. She\u2019s perhaps the most wonderful thing I\u2019ve ever had.\u201dDr. Etman gave the eye to his son with a solemn face.\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose her.\u201dKyle\u2019s eyes glistened with a determined light.\u201cPlease help me protect Leyla, father.\u201d(\u00a0ED: I don\u2019t love him but good luck Kyle! At least you\u2019re better than that a**hole Mathias.)*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The night was getting longer, but Bill Remmer hadn\u2019t returned yet.Leyla sat drowsily on a porch chair, waiting for him since she couldn\u2019t think of any more domestic chores to focus on. Uncle Bill\u2019s vacant chair felt so big today in a strange kind of way.Was there a mishap of any sort?The alarming notion that passed Leyla\u2019s mind made her spring to her feet. One day, she recalled reading an article in the newspaper about a rail accident. Trains, in addition to carriages and cars, often engaged in a variety of incidents.Which train was it?Leyla circled around the yard\u00a0and plucked up her courage to head towards the mansion\u2019s gate by the time the sun plummeted. It had become a path she couldn\u2019t cross in the last few days due to her fear of encountering the Duke.For every step she took, Leyla kept thinking of Uncle Bill. She did have a propensity of assuming the worst since she was a little girl. The unhappiness of a like-a-clay-pigeon person was harrowing. So she believed, if she had just the barest of preparations, at least, she would be able to accept the ill-fortune\u00a0without becoming too overwhelmed.Leyla braced herself for the unhappiness that would follow after her relatives stared at her with displeasure in their eyes.Don\u2019t cry even if you get hit.You\u2019ll hear harsh words, but don\u2019t get hurt.I should be polite and brave even when I\u2019m getting kicked out.I\u2019ll try to smile brighter on my way to another house next time.Her efforts had been fruitful. Leyla was less hurt and able to smile a little better. The misfortunes seemed to follow her like straw in the wind, but she was able to bear them with ease, because she had steeled herself, ready for everything.But, she was having qualms when it came to Uncle Bill.\u201cUncle\u2026.\u201dCalling his name, she passed the entrance to the mansion.Uncle Bill was not the type of person to leave her behind.\u00a0Undoubtedly, he would return.But if he didn\u2019t, then\u2026\u201cPlease come back\u2026.\u201dLeyla put her hands together like she was praying.\u201cDon\u2019t leave me alone\u2026\u201dThe picture of her from yesterday, which had calmly soothed the man who had been frightened about leaving her for four days, now had dissipated, replaced by her own worry.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u2018Mom, where are you going?\u2019Leyla innocently inquired of her mother when she gave her candy in a pretty glass jar for the first time in her life. That day, her mother was as lovely as the sweets she was holding.\u2018Far away.\u2019Her mother had been looking at her for quite some time, as she replied in a word.\u2018Then, are you coming home late?\u2019Leyla asked again, impatiently, since she was eager to taste the candy.\u2018Yes.\u2019\u2018How late?\u2019\u2018Very late.\u2019\u2018You\u2019re coming home before I finish eating this, right?\u2019Leyla shook the glass jar full of colorful candies and her mother languidly nodded\u2018Yes\u2019Again, she gave a short reply.\u2018I will.\u2019*\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have left me such an answer if you\u2019re going to forsake me.\u201dHer mother was reputed to be too beautiful to exist as the wife of a poor man. She had eventually fled, leaving behind her husband and daughter as if she were discarding her ill-fitting clothes.In keeping with the grapevines, she had become a high nobility\u2019s mistress or married a silk-stocking merchant, and emigrated to another country.People enjoyed overblown and twisted rumors like these which often soon withered. The only thing left was a man abandoned by his beautiful wife and a neglected young daughter, let alone such a cruel reality.Thenceforth, her loving father became an alcoholic and bedrinked every day. He didn\u2019t want to see Leyla\u2019s face any longer, because it was hard for him to look at someone who reminded him of his truant-wife.Leyla cherished her candies as she awaited her mother\u2019s homecoming. By the time the bottom of the pretty glass bottle was exposed, she realized that her mother would never return. But she didn\u2019t want to accept that painful truth. That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t eat the last piece of her candy.She ate that last candy for dinner only after she was left all alone in the world.Her father, whose health was ruined by alcohol, at a later time passed away due to sickness.\u2018Was it a foreshadowing of his departure and last farewell? \u2018Her father, who had ignored his daughter for years, smiled at her on\u00a0the day he died.\u2018Let\u2019s go to the park together when the flowers bloom, Leyla.\u2019Her father whispered in a lifeless voice.\u00a0But, after he departed that evening, his words only became a vain will.\u201cDon\u2019t leave any promises if you\u2019re leaving.\u201dLeyla was orphaned in an empty house. Her relatives couldn\u2019t figure out what to do with the troublesome child, so they deserted her for a time. It seemed as if they were gawking at her. There was nothing left for her save the empty words of a worthless promise and a solitary piece of candy that provided little comfort.Even after all these years, Leyla still remembered the color of that candy. A glossy blue luster of confectionery that glistened much like crystal.A few days later, on the day when there was nothing else left to eat, Leyla ended up eating the last candy. When she nibbled on it hard, some of the shattered candy shards scraped her fragile gum and the tender skin of her taste buds.Her mouth was bleeding, but Leyla went on munching on the crunchy candy. Tears streamed down her eyes as she ate it. Her sadness tasted so sweet, like biting into a luscious candy but with a fishy aftertaste.There was a shower of blooms outside the window, ornamenting the scene with spots of dappled sunlight. It was an afternoon in early spring when the wafting pale pink flower petals in the breeze looked like falling flakes of snow on a fresh layer of grass.*\u201c\u2026 Uncle?!\u201dLeyla\u2019s eyes went wide with surprise on her walk along Platanus Road.\u201cUncle!\u201dA dazzling smile flourished over her face.\u201cUncle! Uncle Bill!\u201dLeyla ran toward Bill Remmer, who was crossing the road from the opposite side.At the same time when a black limousine transporting the duke entered the Platanus roadway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She let her long, loose blonde hair whip around by the wind following her springing footsteps.Matthias clenched his hand slightly. He was about to tell the driver to slow down the car, but eventually, he changed his mind and merely scoped a glance at her running towards a middle-aged man who was none other than Bill Remmer.Leyla leapt with light steps into the gardener\u2019s arms like a winged bird, and the gardener caught her in a bear hug. She appeared like a little girl in his big arms and smiled so widely as if it were the brightest smile in the world and seeing that the gardener burst into laughter.At that moment, the car whizzed past them. Matthias left his gaze from the window and peered down onto his hands. From that slightly raised hand, he still could feel her touch and the lingering smell of her body on that day.The engagement was soon, around the corner.By the time Matthias felt alleviated by that verity, the car had passed through the gate of the Arvis mansion.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla\u2019s wish came true.Everything was back to being fine after Uncle Bill\u2019s return.Her adolescent sadness, the unpleasant memories of her horrible first kiss, all of her bewilderment and despair wound down as she was no longer alone.In the meantime, the morning and evening weather grew chillier. The days wore down, and the Arvis manor began to have a more stately jubilant atmosphere than it ever had in the past.\u201cOh, don\u2019t even mention it, I\u2019ll serve all the greatest cuisine in the world.\u201d Madam Mona, who had barely made it to the forest, kicked up a rumpus with a straight face. She leaned leisurely on a chair next to Bill Remmer and began to bleat in earnest. \u201cI\u2019m already scared to think how grand their wedding would be if their engagement ceremony is so ritzy like this.\u201dLeyla had just returned from milking the goats and greeted her with a cheerful smile.\u201cWait a little longer, Leyla. Tomorrow I will make your mouth water until you\u2019re sick of it. Regardless of how many guests are invited, they won\u2019t be able to finish half of the food I will cook.\u201dLeyla unconsciously clutched the tip of her blouse at Madam Mona\u2019s hearty laugh. The hickeys sowed by the duke on her neck were still painfully obvious even after a few days. The red marks which showed in the mirror every time she looked in it made her feel ashamed and disgusted.\u201cIs the engagement ceremony already tomorrow?\u201d\u201cPlease, don\u2019t use the word \u2018already\u2019 Leyla. I hope that\u2026..no, I\u2019m simply hoping for a quick ending to this engagement ceremony.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s tomorrow\u2026\u201d Leyla muttered quietly, then smiled again. \u201cYes, auntie. I will wait for it.\u201dShe sought to grin more brightly as if to erase her nightmare-like memory. Ever since that day, the duke had never once set his foot in the forest. Pleased to state, it was a glee for Leyla to know that.\u201cI like chocolate cookies. And raspberry cake too!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll bring you a bulk of chocolate or raspberries.\u201d\u201cHow can I repay you?\u201d asked Leyla.\u201cRepay? Just eat a lot and grow up well.\u201d\u201cDo I have to grow up to be as big as Uncle Bill?\u201d\u201cOh my God, Leyla. You\u2019ll be single for life if you grow up to his size.\u201dMadam Mona giggled as she rose from her seat and waved goodbye. Bill Remmer furrowed his brows, but later he tardily joined in the mirth.Not long after she left, the usual night dawned at the cottage.After having supper with her uncle, Leyla tidied the house and reopened the textbook she had overlooked till now. She opted to sleep for a little while as drowsiness engulfed her. But by the time she awoke, the sunup had already begun to appear; and the Duke\u2019s engagement day was already here.Leyla put on her glasses from the desk and rubbed her sleepy eyes before strolling up to the window. She flung the window wide, letting the cold morning air flood in.The wee hours of the morning drew near and the sky was dyed with a clear, transparent tint of blue. Leyla reared up her eyes-the hue of the azure sky today reminded her of the colour of her last piece of candy.The duke\u2019s eyes were also blue, similar to the shade of that candy\u2019s.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Claudine picked a pastel pink dress for her red-letter day. Donned in a gown garlanded with chiffon on top of the silk, her figure was so graceful and stunning as the event\u2019s protagonist.\u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous, Claudine!\u201d Countess Brandt cheered in jollies as she watched her daughter. Her face was etched with awed looks, akin to those of the Brandt\u2019s maid, who stood in the rear of the room.Claudine smiled sweetly to show her gratitude for the honeyed flattery that had been bestowed upon her. Even at this moment, the spark of pride and satisfaction in her eyes didn\u2019t wear off after seeing her reflection in the mirror.It was Claudine\u2019s idea, holding the engagement ceremony at the Arvis manor. Aside from wanting to show respect for the Herhardt family, Claudine wanted to assure through dint of her presence that she was gonna be the Arvis\u2019s next duchess.\u201cMarie, is she still not here?\u201d Claudine turned slightly and asked the maid as she wondered.\u201cShe should have arrived by this time\u2026 Oh, look over there! She\u2019s coming from the garden!\u201dThe maid hurriedly exclaimed and\u00a0Countess Brandt creased her brows as she looked out of the window.Leyla Lewellin was seen ascending the marble staircase bridging the rose garden to the mansion, carrying a basket of flowers in her hands.\u201cGoodness me, Claudine! Did you bring her in again?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mom.\u201d Claudine calmly lulled her mother. \u201cI merely need flower ornaments in my hair to make them look nice.\u201d\u201cIs there a reason why it had to be her?\u201d\u201cWell, there is no specific reason.\u201dClaudine shrugged her shoulders, then stepped in front of the mirror once again.\u00a0Her face reflected in the mirror was no longer smiling.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to get flowers and congrats from an old friend.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The Arvis house was wrapped up in a festive excitement as the Duke Herhardt\u2019s residence readied to greet the guests who would be in attendance for the engagement party later in the afternoon.Leyla plodded\u00a0\u00a0the passageway behind the mansion designed for servants to enter.\u00a0Her feet shook nervously numerous times as she was treading on a floor that sparkled like a clear mirror.Claudine had sent a maid to the cottage to call her in. Leyla immediately knew the moment she was told to pick roses to decorate her hair.It wasn\u2019t a matter of flowers that Lady Brandt wanted to meet her for.Leyla began to slow her pace down as she neared the east side of the fourth floor. It was a guest bedroom where Claudine was staying in. Her hand, which was holding the basket, stood out pallid. Her heart felt as if it would pound out of her chest and her lips were feeling parched.\u2018No.\u2019Leyla mumbled, convincing herself.\u2018It\u2019s merely an unfortunate accident.\u00a0\u00a0The duke would also think the same. So it\u2019s fine.\u00a0There\u2019s nothing to be scared of.\u2019While she was hesitating, trying to make up her mind, Leyla had already set her foot in front of Claudine\u2019s bedroom. She knocked on the door and it began to slide open slowly.\u201cHello, miss. I\u2019ve brought you the roses you had asked for.\u201dLeyla greeted her with politeness like she usually did. She had brought Claudine a bouquet of roses in the colour pink, which matched the shade of the dress she was attiring for today\u2019s occasion.Claudine approached Leyla with a wide smile. \u201cHow do I look? Do I look good?\u201d\u201cYes, miss. You look beautiful.\u201dLeyla answered wholeheartedly. She would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t. Claudine\u2019s beauty today was undeniably as beautiful as a blooming rose.\u201cBefore, I was very anxious, but now that you have said so, I feel relieved. Do you think Duke Herhardt will think the same too ?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dThe duke\u2019s name that came out suddenly from Claudine\u2019s mouth made her flinch..\u201cI\u2019m sure, he will.\u201dA faint tremor was noticeable in her voice.Leyla felt woefully pathetic, as if she were a child who had done something wrong. Their\u00a0kiss was an unpleasant incident, but\u00a0she couldn\u2019t rule out her feeling of guilt as if\u00a0she had become a shameless thief who stole Claudine\u2019s fiance.Leyla he could see that her pride she had puffed up and toiled for in front of Claudine for so many years had been shattered, making her look shabby at this given time.Claudine gave a sideways glimpse at a maid to accept the rose basket. And, as if it were a natural thing, she gave out a handful of gold coins to Leyla. The amount of money she gifted to her today was more than usual. Unknowing it just served to wound Leyla\u2019s heart even more gravely.\u201cWhat are you doing? Why aren\u2019t you showing your gratitude?\u201dThe frowning maid rebuked her.Leyla quickly bowed her head while tightly gripping the money in her hand. She\u00a0didn\u2019t feel insulted bowing down to Claudine\u00a0as she had repeated this stance countless times since she was a child and had been used to it.\u201cThank you, miss.\u201dThankfully, Leyla was able to convey her thanks calmly. Claudine, who had been staring at her with a deadpan face, soon regained her bright smile. \u201cNo problem. Instead, I should be the one to say thanks, Leyla. Thanks to you, this engagement ceremony will turn out to be perfect.\u201dClaudine turned around as she was done with the talk.Leyla gasped a big sigh and rushed out of the room in a headlong dash. What was buzzing around inside her head right now was the urge to get out of this uncomfortable and unfamiliar place as quickly as possible but she couldn\u2019t act in a reckless manner inside the mansion.She neatened her clothes and organized her flower basket first before walking down the corridor meant for workers at the quickest possible speed.She was about to walk through the passageway\u2019s entry door when a surprise caught her. Just as she was about to turn the corner, she crossed the path with the duke who had come up the stairs.\u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve been doing Lady Brandt\u2019s errands, Leyla.\u201dButler Hessen, who stood behind the duke, spoke with a gracious smile.Leyla greeted him back politely and scurried back to the side of the corridor. She only wanted to go ahead, but the duke stopped still and lowered his gaze on her.Her cheek blushed. She bent her head even deeper as she dared not to make eye contact with him.\u00a0It was just eye contact, but her heart was erratically pounding.\u00a0While the duke looked fine, as if he couldn\u2019t care any less. It seemed he had forgotten everything that had happened between them.\u2018How foolish of me. How could my heart throb in snatches of a man like him?\u2019The duke walked past her just as she wanted to run away unmannerly. Only after she could no longer hear the stomping of his shoe-steps did Leyla dare to move her feet and leave the mansion.After completing her errands, Leyla returned to her daily routine.As the evening drew near, the guests invited to the engagement party began to flock to manor. In contrast with the rollicking mansion, the little cottage loomed peacefully deep in the forest as if it had been sojourned in another world.There, Leyla lived her life diligently.She weeded the garden and cleaned the goat pen. Continued by cooking a stew for dinner and folded up the sun-dried laundry stocked in the hamper.After all of her house chores were finished,\u00a0 Leyla took a leisurely walk in the forest to get a thrill of nature. She was enjoying her stroll before long she realized she had arrived at the riverside.Leyla clambered her favourite beautiful tree to watch the evening scenery laid bare on a windless summer day. The awe-inspiring view surrounded her; birds were soaring above the sky, the red-tinged Schulter river drenched in light by the setting sun, and a white swan-like annex floating on it, all of which led to greater beauty of the scene.It was a millions worth sight to see. Her eyes were drawn to all of those beautiful things.As the sun set, a few thin strips of the cloud on the horizon turned shimmering gold. The clear darkness of early nightfall settled over the sky like the blue candy she remembered from her childhood.The thought came to her.The Duke\u2019s eyes were likewise the same as those colours.\u201cYour blue eyes are the same as the color of my sadness.\u201dLeyla laughed a little as she somehow was feeling\u00a0dejected. Then suddenly, she sensed someone\u2019s presence approaching her.\u201cKyle!\u201dLeyla shouted with delight when\u00a0a familiar face standing underneath the tree.\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d\u201cYou like taking a stroll on a summer evening, when you go out for evening walks you always go to this river.\u201dKyle\u2019s playfulness had disappeared, and his eyes were deeper and gentler than they had ever been. Leyla observed him quietly,\u00a0his gaze towards her felt a little strange.The wind was sighing through the river. The sound of the leaves rustling in the treetops and the boughs moaning breached the silence that had been created between them.\u201cLeyla.\u201dKyle opened his lips after a while.Leyla replied by tilting her head a little as she waited for him to speak.\u201cLet\u2019s get married.\u201dThose overly unrealistic words were torn asunder on a gentle evening breeze. Leyla was dreamingly dazed in disbelief, but now Kyle said it once again. This time with a more serious tone.\u201cLet\u2019s get married, Leyla.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2727 Let\u2019s Get Married \u2727The spring season came a little earlier in Ratz, the capital of the Berg Empire, which was located in the southernmost province of Carlsbar. Arvis estate was starting to bear buds as May came, but the whole city of Ratz was already awash with the sweet scent of roses.Matthias had a sudden glimpse of thought over the changing of the season while passing through the gardens of the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace. He suddenly halted in his steps, and the other officers who were trailing from behind stopped as well.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Matthias answered short, \u201cNothing.\u201d He smiled a little, the tip of his lips lifting.The brief silence broke after Matthias got his stride back. The young aristocratic guard officers continued to converse playfully. Their faces and voices glowed with excitement while discussing how to spend this fine spring weekend and roughly met with a very similar conclusion altogether.Party. Horse racing. Alternatively, having a spring date with a lover.\u201cOur Captain will leave his fiance\u00e9 and spend a lonely spring.\u201dThe horde of officers giggled in a bunch when one of their peers cracked a joke. Matthias just casually grinned and gave a faint chuckle in response to his men\u2019s jesting.The engagement ceremony between Duke Herhardt and Lady Brandt, which was hosted at the end of last summer, took place successfully. Over several weeks, the couple who had been officially betrothed had become a hot topic of buzz within the society.However, Matthias didn\u2019t feel much of a change from his everyday life. A week after his engagement, he was assigned to the Berg\u2019s army garrison and had to leave for the capital the day after. Meanwhile, Claudine, who had been staying in Arvis estate, returned to the Brandt\u2019s estate, which was situated in the center of Carlsbar, a metropolis that was a long distance away from the capital city of Ratz.So, nothing had changed from their previous mode of living, except for the fact that their engagement had been made public. During the social season, Claudine stayed at the mansion the Brandt\u2019s had in Ratz for a while. It was nothing new for her, however, since she had been a regular visitor to the estate on a seasonal basis for quite some time before then. Aside from that, they also attended the social events together, as they always did in the past.Everything else basically remained the same, except that they now had a definite official status as each other\u2019s fianc\u00e9es, which was the only thing that had altered in their life.\u201cI\u2019m about to finish my military service soon. What about you, Matthias?\u201dA fellow officer who was strolling alongside him posed a question that drew everyone\u2019s attention to Matthias.\u201cCurrently, I\u2019m thinking about extending it for another year.\u201dAs soon as he said that, those around him seemed to be taken aback by his surprising answer.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to get married and focus on the family business?\u201d\u201cThe wedding? Maybe next year.\u201d\u201cIs it because the hot dish over Duke Herhardt\u2019s marriage has eased in social circles? So you want to postpone the wedding?\u201dMatthias flicked his chin instead of answering. Rather than calling it a postponement, things went that way naturally like it was supposed to. He intended to stay in the capital for another year. At the same time, the Brandt\u2019s wished for their daughter to spend her honeymoon in Arvis with her husband.When the Brandt\u2019s first requested for the engagement to be tabled for one more year, the Herhardt family consented without hesitation.Given her young age, there was no pressing need for Claudine to get betrothed so soon. And more than anything else, both families yearned for this marriage to be perfect from the beginning.After leaving the Imperial Palace, Matthias didn\u2019t waste any time returning to his home.In terms of age, the old brick mansion, which was located in the heart of Ratz, was the second-oldest building among the Herhardt family\u2019s properties after the Arvis mansion on their estate. That mansion served as the family\u2019s headquarters for generations, during the time they were responsible for the capital\u2019s work. The architecture of the house was more modest and classic compared to the Arvis manor, which epitomized the aesthetic tastes of the hostesses.\u201cThe two madams are here,\u201d reported the servant as he approached Matthias, who had just got out of the car.\u201cMy mother and grandmother?\u201d\u201cYes, the madams arrived this morning. They said, \u201cthey came here to attend the forthcoming wedding of Her Majesty the Crown Princess.\u201dMatthias nodded his head and slowly entered the mansion.The princess, whose pride had been crushed after being pushed out and losing the seat of the Duchess Herhardt\u2019s, was eager to find another running mate so that she could proceed with the wedding ceremony as she planned. Thereafter, the title of her spouse fell to the Grand Duke of a nearby duchy with the same social standing as the Herhardt\u2019s.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Matthias!\u201dCatharina von Herhardt, waiting for Matthias to enter the foyer, greeted him with a bright smile and wide opened arms.\u201cSon, we can see your face only when we come here like this.\u201dWhile his mother Elysee, stayed the same as always; her approach towards her only son was more straightforward.Matthias approached the two with a warm smile on his face. It was another Saturday afternoon, as much as every other day. Just like the brimming garden of blossoming roses during the early season of spring.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThe weather this evening is so nice, Leyla.\u201dKyle walked up to her with a jolly face after parking his bike. Leyla, who was busy helping Bill clean his cart in the garden, quickly turned her head towards the voice, so did Bill, who was holding a shovel.\u201cLet\u2019s get married.\u201dKyle shouted.After hearing it over and over again, his marriage proposal no longer came as a surprise and it sounded more like a daily morning greeting these days. After having taken a slight pause for a moment, Leyla and Bill nonchalantly returned to their work.\u201cHello, Kyle.\u201dLeyla greeted him brightly as she carried whatever was leftover of the planted seedlings.\u201cI\u2019m not getting married.\u201dLeyla spoke in a friendly tone afterward, emphasizing her firm rejection of his proposal.Sigh.Bill heaved a sigh. He seemed to be feeling the pain of Kyle\u2019s broken heart. But in contrast, Kyle appeared unfazed by Leyla\u2019s constant rejection. He just smiled gently and volunteered to help her without being asked.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll accept your rejection today. I\u2019ll ask you again tomorrow, then.\u201d\u201cEnough. Don\u2019t ask anymore.\u201d\u201cNo, I will keep asking. A person\u2019s minds is bound to change.\u201dWith the way he was behaving, it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that Kyle\u2019s shameless and stubborn spirit was maybe the toughest in the whole Berg empire.Bill tried to maintain a straight face as he looked at Kyle and Leyla while struggling to stifle his laughter.***Kyle Etman began to propose in the late summer, and stuck to his guns until the seasons changed several times.When Bill first found out that Kyle had proposed to Leyla, he believed it was most likely due to one of the two possible causes. Either that kid was drunk, considering he couldn\u2019t drink well, or he was insane. That\u2019s why Bill didn\u2019t smack him in the head with the shovel after all. But the following day, Kyle showed up again with a very sane face and repeated the same thing.\u2018How many times has it been since then?\u2019Kyle stopped by the cottage without missing a day throughout fall, winter, and even this spring, saying the same thing every time. Only to be rejected on every one of those visits.At first, Bill was cheering for Leyla since she was so staunch, but he began to feel sorry for Kyle and his plight as time went on. If it weren\u2019t for his father, Bill would have been excessively vocal with Kyle to get him to stop his doing. Bill, however, opted not to speak more since Dr. Etman had granted his son a green-light.\u2018How about sending Leyla off to college?\u2019Said Dr. Etman when he paid a visit to Bill at his cottage last fall.Bill\u2019s heart suddenly slumped like a dreary chimney pot. Even if he wished Leyla could pursue her study to a higher level, his current circumstances, in which he was forced to live from hand to mouth, prevented him from doing so. When he replied hesitatingly, \u2018I can\u2019t afford it.\u2019 Dr. Etman\u2019s face was lit up with a smile. He continued.\u2018If our children have feelings for each other and want to become a couple, it would be good to get them married and send them to college together.\u2019Bill stared blankly at the doctor in stupefaction. He couldn\u2019t believe what he had heard, though he was thrilled with the offer.To him, Leyla was the most wonderful child in the world. Yet, he soon realized that the rest of the world had its own set of standards that he couldn\u2019t grasp. One of those was regarding the Etman family\u2019s social standing in Carlsbar society, something about which he had been entirely clueless up until today.Dr. Etman seemed to understand his befuddlement, so therefore, he spoke first.\u2018Kyle said that Leyla is the one person who could bring out the best in him, so he wants to live by her side as a decent person for her.\u2019Bill was reasonably surprised, as he learned that the young boy who spent most of his time lounging lazily in his cottage and stuffing his stomach with free food had said something like that to his father.\u2018It was a very sincere thought that came from youngsters who are still in their adolescence.\u2019\u2018But Doctor, Leyla is\u2026.\u2019Bill clammed up, but Dr. Etman\u2019s expression grew kinder.\u2018I don\u2019t require his future bride to come from a wealthy family or have a perfect upbringing, because I know that Leyla is a good child even if she doesn\u2019t have such privileges.\u2019He said so with a smiling face that resembled that of his son.\u2018If Kyle doesn\u2019t change his mind till he decides on his career path next year, I\u2019d like to allow them to be together. How about you, Mr. Remmer?\u2019Deep down in his heart, Bill Remmer was on a cloud nine and felt grateful that he was willing to carry Dr. Etman-whom he regarded to be an angel in human form- on his back and run across the Carlsbar or even the whole Berg Empire. It didn\u2019t matter how tired his physical state was; Bill would be able to endure it every time he pictured Leyla\u2019s happy face in front of him.Those were his true feelings.Kyle\u2019s stupid proposal may have ended up being a blessing in disguise for Leyla.Bill tossed the shovel into the warehouse as he had made up his mind to do something about this matter.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cOh, Matthias. You know Dr. Etman\u2019s son, don\u2019t you?Elysee von Herhardt lowered her voice a smidgeon amid a boring talk on the princess\u2019s nuptials. It was just the two of them at the spacious dining table, savoring their blue-plate dinner since Catharina had gone to bed early that night.\u201cYes, mother.\u201d Matthias nodded calmly, putting down the glass of water from which he had taken a sip on the table. \u201cKyle Etman. Dr. Etman\u2019s only son.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. That kid, Kyle, he\u2019s getting married.\u201dHer voice sounded keen. It was a hint that the woman who became Kyle\u2019s Etman\u2019s companion was an unwelcome figure. But Matthias remained quiet, patiently waiting for his mother to finish her story.\u201cShe\u2019s an orphan raised by our gardener, if I\u2019m not mistaken, her name is Leyla.\u201d\u2018Leyla.\u2019Matthias muttered, with no sound flowing from his lips.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me that she will satisfy the criteria of the Etmans as their prospective daughter-in-law.\u201dHis throat felt a little tight when he heard his mother mention her name.\u201cIt\u2019s amusing, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Matthias then came up with a bland retort. \u201cSadly, all of Grandmother\u2019s efforts to find him a good mate have been in vain.\u201dHis voice was a bit taut for some reason.Matthias didn\u2019t give a further response, but Elysee enthusiastically recounted Kyle Etman\u2019s marriage story, which had been garnering a lot of snooping in the Arvis estate these days.Mrs. Etman was teed off with Kyle\u2019s decision to marry Leyla since she had been striving for years to get a title from her in-law\u2019s family, which now she was unable to get because of her son\u2019s choice. However, it seemed that she was actually put on the spot in the face of her husband and son\u2019s wishes.If all went according to plan, rumors said that Leyla would marry the doctor\u2019s son and continue her education. After they went for their honeymoon in Ratz, they would attend college together.After the upcoming summer passed. Shortly after the season of roses.\u201cGrandmother must be heartbroken. She eally adores Dr. Etman\u2019s son.\u201d\u201cYeah. She must be.\u201d Matthias put down his cutlery and grabbed a napery on the table with his alabaster hand.\u201cI feel so sorry for Mrs. Etman. She was a respectable doctor\u2019s wife, much more so than them, who were nobles in status. But she lost her hard-earned social standing because of a ridiculous daughter-in-law.\u201d Elysee took a sip of wine to moisten her lips. \u201cWhat kind of noble would want to befriend a wife who takes a lowlife orphan as her daughter-in-law?\u201d\u201cThe situation may change.\u201dMatthias straightened his posture and turned to face his mother.\u201cBecause they\u2019re not married yet.\u201d\u201cWell, Matthias, if things could be changed, Mrs. Etman wouldn\u2019t have been so depressed like this. As you know, Dr. Etman is a persistent person and above all, Kyle is completely smitten with that orphan child.\u201dElysee flicked her tongue, expressing her sympathies for the doctor\u2019s wife, who was about to-be-shunned by society as of now.\u201cShe\u2019s a remarkably pretty girl. It was a troublesome reason why her son couldn\u2019t get away from her.\u201dWhen she rang the bell, the waiting maids started to serve the dessert on the table.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that girl was able to take over Mrs. Etman\u2019s position in such a blatant way. She\u2019s a real freak. No, should I say she\u2019s smart?\u201d Elysee shrugged her shoulders lightly and slid her dessert fork into her mouth. \u201cActually, it\u2019s absurd to place the blame on her alone. The most foolish is Mrs. Etman\u2019s son, who got blinded by a girl and brought disgrace upon his whole family.\u201dAfter she was satisfied with schmoozing and reaching her desired conclusion, Elysee von Herhardt finally changed the topic of her talk.Now, she was back to bring up the topic of her social life, which included a slew of well-known and uninteresting names.Matthias, on the other hand, stayed deafeningly quiet while listening to her drone on.\u2018Leyla.\u2019That name lingered on the tip of his tongue, like the sip\u2019s taste of wine that had left a sweet mark on him.Leyla.Leyla Lewellin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For that reason, the Ratz garden was landscaped modestly to add-on to the mansion\u2019s austere style of architecture.Once the spring season arrived and the roses of different varieties imported from Arvis were in full bloom, the flower beds transformed the drab gardens into a site that was well worth seeing.When the scent of flowers\u00a0began to linger in\u00a0the blowing wind, Matthias had a passing thought about returning to the estate for the summer break.Before suddenly, the shadow of a girl who had been diligently wandering about the garden, helping the gardener, snapped him out of his reverie.Leyla.Matthias unwittingly frowned.That girl smelled like a rose.A gardener with a natural aptitude for growing roses had painstakingly succeeded in blossoming one of the most beautiful roses in the world.But he never thought\u00a0the precious rose the gardener raised in the woods would soon become his misfortune.Leyla, the nobody girl.That was the name that had been embedded in her.Matthias closed the window and turned around.\u00a0\u00a0Droplets of water\u00a0from his wet hair\u00a0sprinkled over his feet.\u2018Still, didn\u2019t fortune favour her now?\u2019Someone like Leyla Lewellin could only dream of having a companion like a doctor\u2019s son.She was blessed with once-in-a-lifetime great luck. Thanks to Kyle Etman\u2019s foolish naivety, she could become the future Mrs Etman and attend college in the nation\u2019s capital.\u201c\u2026Leyla.\u201dMatthias made a hushed mention of her name beneath his breath. He mused for a beat.Perhaps, if that beautiful thing disappeared from his sight, things might turn out better for him as well.Assuming this was true, he should give her a bigger round of applause for the marriage more than anyone else.Even when he closed the window, the smell of roses still lingered on the tip of his nose.Matthias spotted a vase of roses that had been put on the console table. Someone seemed to have plucked the roses that had bloomed in the garden and placed them in his bedroom.After passing by the vase,\u00a0his gaze was rested on the golden cage he had brought along with him to Ratz\u00a0\u00a0and then turned towards the vase again.\u201cLeyla.\u201dHer name sounded even sweeter when he said it with more clarity.\u201cThe roses have bloomed but you\u2019re not here.\u201dMeanwhile, he was lost in his musings; Matthias suddenly snatched the coveted roses from the vase and clasped them firmly with his hand.The memories of Leyla, who had tears pouring down her face, flooded back into his mind. The pale pink roses reminded him of her sobbing cheeks, which were dripping wet with tears.Matthias\u2019 grip on the rose gradually became tighter and tighter until the flower was crushed to a jumble of petals in his palms.\u2018It\u2019s a good thing.\u2019He conscientiously believed so.\u2018But\u2026\u2019Matthias\u2019 eyes narrowed slowly.\u2018Can there be a season where the roses bloom without you there?\u2019\u2018The flowers will blossom, and I will return, but why aren\u2019t you there with me?\u2019In those questions, Matthias revived a memory that he wasn\u2019t even aware he had.That the child was always there.In the rose-filled summer garden, as if she had become an inseparable part of Arvis itself.Which means she was also a part of him.His little yellow bird chirped when it couldn\u2019t fly after he cut its wing off. Matthias now felt a strong urge to kill a person for the first time in his life at this point.It was unclear which one of them, whether it was the doctor\u2019s son?\u2026.or that woman.It wasn\u2019t until the night had gotten dim when Matthias released the petals that became a hard lump.\u00a0His rose-scented hand reached out and took one of the papers on the table and tore it into shreds.It was a document required to be submitted by the end of the following week.An eligibility document to extent one year service as a military officer.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI wholeheartedly give my approval.\u201dBill strenuously broached his long hesitated words.Sitting across the table, Leyla was gazing at him with a perplexed face.\u201cThat glutton, Kyle.\u00a0I agree. You have my blessing.\u201d\u201cHey, uncle\u2026\u201dLeyla frowned. But Bill kept running his mouth off.\u201cStop rejecting him now.\u00a0Marry him and go to college. I really want you to do that, Leyla.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you like Kyle, too?\u201d\u201cI do, it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to marry him.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by it makes no sense? What\u2019s so strange about two people liking each other and getting married.\u201dBill choked up, but Leyla\u2019s eyes were fixed on him and didn\u2019t budge.\u201cKyle and his family will become everybody\u2019s fool because of me.\u201d\u201cDr. Etman has allowed it, too.\u201d\u201cBut \u2026.\u201d\u201cLeyla, stop thinking about this and that and just look into your heart.\u201d Bill raised the tone of his voice.\u00a0\u201cIf you like Kyle, get married, but if you don\u2019t like him, then don\u2019t. You don\u2019t need to think about anything else.\u201dLeyla blinked her eyes shut at his words and took a big gulp of the beer before her.Bill quietly watched her. The child he had nurtured had now grown into a great drinker. Now, they were each other\u2019s best drinking buddies. Ones who could share their woes while sipping a pint of beer together.\u201cI like Kyle. There\u2019s no other friend in the world who is as comfortable, warm and kind as him.\u201dLeyla wiped the beer\u2019s froth from the corner of her lips as she eyed Bill even more sternly.\u201cSo, I don\u2019t want to bring shame on him.\u201d\u201cNo, what\u2019s wrong with you, Leyla? Why are you looking down on yourself?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. Uncle, I like the person I\u2019ve become. No matter what other people think of me, I\u2019ve never been embarrassed of who I am. All I want to do is be a good and responsible adult, much like you wish for.\u201dLeyla knitted her brows. Her eyes clouded over with somberness\u00a0beyond her glasses.\u201cBut, uncle, I\u2019m completely clueless when it comes to marriage. If I were to get married right now, it would mean that all of my efforts have been in vain.\u201d\u201cHa. I hope you\u2019re not possibly thinking of spending all your life stuck in this cabin\u00a0old widower for the rest of your life, Leyla.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d love to. I don\u2019t want to leave this Arvis forest, uncle. And neither do you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible thing to say.\u201d\u201cNow that I have a teaching certification, I\u2019m going to get a job at a school nearby. And I want to live like this forever. Living here, together with you, uncle. Maybe I can help you, too.\u201d\u201cIs this forest going to run?\u00a0It\u2019s going nowhere.\u00a0\u00a0And I\u2019m always going to be here in this forest.\u00a0Well, maybe someday when I\u2019m getting older and don\u2019t have the stamina to continue working as a gardener, I\u2019ll resign and leave this place. However, I\u2019m still healthy, and I\u2019ll still be in good shape for the next ten years as well.\u201dBill gulped down his beer.\u201cLeyla, whether you leave here, go to college, get married, wherever you are, whatever you do, you will always be my little Leyla.\u201dBill reached out and gently squeezed Leyla\u2019s tiny hand on the table.The college entrance exam was just around the corner, but Leyla still had no signs of changing her mind. Bill was so frustrated, that he had decided to arrange this talk with her today.\u201cIf you get married to the Etman household, you\u2019ll be living in the neighborhood, there\u2019s nothing better than that.\u201d\u201cUncle.\u201d\u201cLeyla, there\u2019s a very rare kind of man in the world. A man who assured me that he would be a good husband and a good father. And Kyle is the kind of man who fits that bill.\u201dAs he smiled, Bill patted the back of Leyla\u2019s hand with his palm.\u201cThink about this. I hope you get married to a nice guy and build a real family. Make your home a hive of life, filled with the sound of children laughing. I believe Kyle will never let you be lonely.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 We\u2019re an actual family too.\u201dLeyla, who was fiddling with Bill\u2019s fingers, raised her head.The corners of her eyes were red\u201cUncle, we are also a family. A real one.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What\u2019s that\u2026 \u2026 ?\u201dSince she came from Lovita, this hapless child had carried tear sacs full of sadness with her. Bill\u2019s eyes would sometimes heat up and get teary when he looked at her.\u201cIf you think we\u2019re a real family, you should listen to me even more!\u201dBill yelled and dropped an envelope he had prepared in advance in front of Leyla.Immediately upon receiving and opening the envelope, Leyla\u2019s eyes widened. Inside the envelope was a train ticket to Ratz with a sum of money to cover travel costs.\u201cThe test is next week. Study hard from tomorrow. \u00a0You always work hard, but you still have to work harder to pass. If you don\u2019t go to Latz, then I\u2019ll consider us as a fake family.\u201d\u201cUncle!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t take the entrance exam, I won\u2019t see you again, Leyla.\u201dBill had let go of her hand and sat with his shoulders straight.\u00a0He stared down at her with a severe look. Albeit, his eyes were endlessly warm, with no hint of a threatening expression in them at all.Leyla was lost in thought with the envelope in her hand.Bill looked at her deeply, wholeheartedly, at the figure of a bright and lovely child before his eyes, things that for him hadn\u2019t changed and had remained the same since she was a little kid.After contemplating for quite some time, Leyla ultimately made a difficult choice.She stuck her sparkling glass of beer in front of Bill with a still severe expression on her face.As she had done in the old days, drawing on her pupilage when she tried\u00a0tried to bump her glass of apple juice into Bill\u2019s glass of beer.Bill gladly bumped his glass against hers.Leyla downed the beer all in one go and drained the glass entirely of its contents. Her cheeks quickly began to flush, but she remained steadfast in her pretence of being a good drinker.\u201cEven though we\u2019re apart, we\u2019re still a real family, right?\u201dThat smothering question came close to bringing tears to Bill\u2019s eyes all over again.\u201cDon\u2019t be worried about that.\u201dUnlike his blunt way of speaking,\u00a0\u00a0Bill smiled so warmly at her.Leyla smiled as she watched him still.They were like a genuine family.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYou will definitely like it the most. The museum of natural history.\u201dKyle once again spoke excitedly.\u201cIt\u2019ll probably be like heaven for you.\u201dHe was listing out the must-see places in Ratz and was most excited when he began to talk about the Natural History Museum.Outside the window of the rattling train they were riding, a breathtakingly beautiful sight of springtime landscapes with flowers in full bloom greeted them everywhere.This was Leyla\u2019s first visit to Ratz, and she couldn\u2019t have been thrilled.But for Kyle, it was the umpteenth time since he often visited his relatives in the capital and thus was quite familiar with the city.Kyle had meant for Leyla to stay at\u00a0his relative\u2019s house, but she politely refused his offer and opted to stay at a small hotel nearby.\u201cYou must be tired right now. Shall we go tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI have to study for the exam.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to studying, what is the difference between studying now and studying later before the exam day? You just need to make sure you memorize what you\u2019ve learned.\u201d\u201cWow. You look very confident, Mr. Etman.\u201d\u201cOf course I am, Miss Lewellin.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cSo then, let\u2019s get married.\u201dInstead of hurling her rejection at him like in the past, Leyla set her gaze intensely on Kyle\u2019s face. Her sudden shift in reaction made Kyle startled a bit.\u201cW-why, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cYou know, Kyle. Can you imagine it?\u201d\u201cImagine what?\u201d\u201cWe are married to each other and become husband and wife.\u201dThe moment Leyla stated it with a serious expression, Kyle\u2019s cheeks began to burn crimson.\u201cOf course! You can imagine it! Go ahead, do whatever you want!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It strikes me as a bit weird.\u00a0Us getting married, having children\u2026 You know, getting into that type of relationship.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying now? It\u2019s not weird at all.\u201d\u201cReally? We\u2019ve learned about the act of reproduction, haven\u2019t we? How to make and give birth to a baby, are we really going to do that?\u201d\u201cMake\u2026 Birth, what?\u201dKyle doubted his ears.\u00a0He felt like he had misheard something improper,\u00a0\u00a0but Leyla, the person who threw the bomb words, precisely had an innocent face with not a trace of shamelessness on it.\u201cAct of reproduction.\u201dLeyla hurled a bomb for the second time without even batting an eye.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of, Kyle. Birds, flowers, and all other living things do it to preserve their species.\u201d\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re saying right now?\u201cYeah. I\u2019m only a little weak in geometry, but I am pretty good at other subjects.\u201dKyle\u2019s throat tightened, and he turned head sideways to avoid staring straight ahead. He was embarrassed when Leyla seemed so proud of herself after uttering all that saucy stuff.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit weird for us that we\u2019re going to do that, and\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cuh\u2026 \u2026 Leyla, come on, eat this.\u201d Kyle quickly slipped a slice of sandwich between Leyla\u2019s talkative lips to cease her babbling.Though it wasn\u2019t yet summer, the temperature within the train, for some reason, was as scorching as if he were inside a kiln.Leyla munched on the sandwich with relish. In between bites of the sandwich, she mumbled and opened her lips again.\u201cEat this too.\u201dBefore she could say anything, Kyle had already shoved another cookie into her mouth, clamming her up from speaking further.\u2018Please, don\u2019t say that stuff anymore.\u2019Kyle sucked in everything he wanted to say and just shook his head.( \u2018When you start thinking of shit, think about my shovel.\u2019 )Uncle Bill\u2019s voice suddenly rang out in his ears.He greeted Kyle with a very kind and creepy smile when he came to the cottage to pick up Leyla this morning.\u2018Yes, shovel.\u2019Kyle\u2019s thoughts wandered back to Uncle Bill\u2019s giant dirt shovel, which looked close to a weapon.\u201cSo Kyle, I mean\u2026..\u201dLeyla\u2019s lips began to twitch open once again as soon as she finished all the cookies. Her look was a mess yet lovely, with cookie crumbs smeared all over her dainty red lips.\u201cLeyla, if you say one more word.\u201dKyle sighed and scratched the back of his head.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIf you say one more word\u2026\u201dHe gulped.After digesting his feelings that had been stifled by the shovel, Kyle made a tragic confession.\u201cI\u2019m going to jump off the train.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Matthias remained still. His countenance was quite ample.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m losing a capable officer. Well, it would be a greater loss for this Empire if Duke Herhardt were to continue serving in the army with his competencies. However, speaking from the standpoint of a soldier, I\u2019m a little upset.\u201dHe said. The sense of disappointment and loss in his eyes was earnest, given that they were in a formal military relationship as superior and subordinate.Captain Herhardt, his most trusted underling, who was due to remain in the service for another year, had unexpectedly changed his mind. Imagined his surprise when a paper was delivered to his desk. Instead of the document to extend his service period, a letter of resignation was sent to him. It was his wish that Matthias would stay, but Colonel Farrell had no reason to detain him since the grounds for his appeal, as stated in the letter, was none other than his grandmother, the Duchess of Herhardt.\u201cThank you for all this time.\u201dMatthias thanked him politely.He always showed due respect for his superiors even though the Duke of Herhardt was a considerably higher-ranking nobleman based on social status.His attitude was markedly different from that of other aristocratic officials, who were often unable to differentiate between public and private affairs.Colonel Farrell admired Matthias for that.Secondly, if considering his meritorious service to the empire, his first task by selecting the frontline, a problematic area of the outpost, was noteworthy.\u201cMake sure to visit me when you come to Ratz.\u201dMatthias was more than glad to comply with the colonel\u2019s request for a farewell handshake.\u201cYes, Colonel.\u201dHe shook his superior\u2019s hand firmly and exited through the colonel\u2019s office door, having been entirely freed of his duties.The outpouring of the spring sunshine drifted across a clear blue sky welcoming his steps once he walked out onto the street.Matthias got into his car and drove toward Ratz\u2019s downtown. He had to go to several places to meet with some of his other superiors. It was only after then, the farewell activities for his retirement, which had been rolling on for several days, were finally brought to an end.When he was about to walk up to his waiting vehicle, something went by and halted him in his tracks. Matthias turned his eyes towards the end of the road across the street. Over there, came to his sight a figure he used to know.Leyla.A woman who turned out to be none other than Leyla Lewellin was walking the road leisurely along the promenade at the downtown area.\u201cMaster.\u201dThe driver approached him as he stood still and didn\u2019t get into the car.\u201cGo back first.\u201dMatthias ordered him while keeping his gaze fixed on the opposite side of the road.\u2018It\u2019s Leyla. No way, she couldn\u2019t possibly be here. \u2018Straightaway, with broad strides, he got across the road.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The museum she visited was huge.Leyla looked around in amazement at the magnificent building of the Berg Empire Natural History Museum, the same way she did on her first day setting foot in this place.The day after arriving at Ratz city, Kyle took Leyla on her first visit to this place. The Art History Museum and the Natural History Museum, which sat across the street, opposite to each other, and were said to be places of Ratz\u2019s greatest pride.Leyla had grown used to the grandeur of Carlsbar city, which was reputed to be on par with the splendor of the capital. But she remained so mesmerized by the architectural wonders that lined the streets of Ratz every time she passed through them.The girls at her school who toured the capital often gushed about how beautiful the Art History Museum was. Still, Leyla unhesitatingly chose the Natural History Museum to be named the owner of the most beautiful architecture.As Kyle described it, the museum was like a piece of heaven on earth for her. All she could think about was how vast the museum was and how impossible it seemed to be for her to explore every corner of the building in just a single day.Leyla was eager to devote her entire day exploring this place to the fullest extent possible. She also had planned to empty her schedule on the last day to come here once again before leaving Ratz city. Hopefully, she would be able to view the whole of the museum\u2019s collection and accomplish her mission.Having finally made up her mind, Leyla was raring to go and walked into the museum foyer with a spring in her step.Literally, Kyle wished to accompany her today, but Leyla shunned his goodwill. Unlike her, who had completed her exam the day before, he was just getting started with his exam tomorrow morning.Though Kyle was full of confidence in his brains and had studied in advance, Leyla didn\u2019t want to bring him here for sightseeing just one day before the exam.Before entering the exhibition hall, Leyla once again double-checked her outfit, making sure there was not a single hair out of place.\u2018Comfortable shoes, checked.\u2019\u2018Notebook and pen, checked.\u2019\u2018Stamina in full, I\u2019m ready to go.\u2019After drawing out a notebook and pen from her bag, Leyla stepped into the viewing gallery, which she hadn\u2019t had a chance to see on the first day of her arrival.***Leyla Lewellin today was just like a child at a picnic.Matthias stood at a safe distance away, quietly watching her as she strode through several spacious exhibit galleries without a trace of tiredness devouring her.Matthias was already convinced that the woman\u2019s back he saw going inside the Natural History Museum belonged to Leyla, so he quietly followed her while keeping his distance.Curiosity got the better of him, leaving him wondering what the hell she was up to.?But soon after seeing what she was doing, Matthias was willing to wait and keep a closer eye on her.As he waited, Matthias suddenly remainded about the college entrance exam that took place\u00a0 in the capital around this time. Seeing that she had traveled to the capital city to take the test, Matthias concluded that she had decided to continue her study at the college. So was her marriage to Kyle Etman as well.Leyla was standing in front of a glass display case containing various plant specimens, diligently penning things down in her notebook. Sometimes, her lips were tinged with a smile, and her face took on a jolly beam as if she was looking at a precious jewel. Matthias was hard to believe that a mere plant sample could elicit such a giggle from her face.In the end, Matthias decided to stalk her a bit further, but he didn\u2019t go any closer since he knew her joy would perish whenever she saw him.Matthias folded his hands behind his back and slowly trailed in her footsteps at the same pace.He hadn\u2019t seen her since last summer, and Leyla didn\u2019t seem to have changed much since then. Even yet, there was only a slight changeover in her delicate appearance from before.Her face had become slimmer, her expression looked more gentle, and every movement of her body appeared more graceful as time went on. Donning a lace-embellished white dress, Leyla seemed more mature than she was before.After she had been there long enough, Leyla left the herbarium exhibition room and abruptly stopped for a while in front of the passage leading to the next gallery.Matthias was able to figure out what had piqued her attention.The passageway that ran between the two exhibition rooms was conjured up in such a way and incarnated like a heavenly place. The branches, painted with silvery hue, were decorated with white feathers and garland hanging like leaves.As the light trickled in through the window glass, the colorful bird-shaped crystal ornaments draping all over the branches reflected its rays. They created a dreamlike atmosphere to the eye, reminiscent of a fairy tale realm, enhancing the magical beauty of the space even more.\u201cGosh\u2014.\u201dLeyla\u2019s naive admiration came to his attention.Matthias couldn\u2019t keep a smile off his face as he watched her run about with such abandon. Her wavy blonde hair and the hem of her dress bounced with her as she sprinted excitedly inside the area like a little girl at a playground.In the middle of that beautiful passage, Leyla halted her steps.She stretched out her hand towards the branches, but her fingertips were unable to grasp the bird-shaped ornament.Leyla was still staring up at the ceiling gazing in awe, when Matthias sauntered and walked straight off to her side.Before she had a chance to realize his presence, Matthias already grabbed her by the waist and lifted her body off the ground.Leyla jolted in surprise when she floated into the air. She turned her head, and a crystal bird, which had previously been beyond her reach, was now right in front of her eyes.She felt like she could fly like a bird in the spring and go anywhere. As if she were dreaming with her eyes open.It was strange, but breathaking moment.Matthias dropped her down to the floor and acted as if nothing had happened.The hem of her voluminous, puffy white dress slid down her calves and caressed her skin softly on the inside.Leyla raised her head and hid her hand that had touched the crystal bird behind her back.Matthias slowly took off his officer\u2019s hat. His pairs of blue eyes, bluer than the sky at the end of the summer, were fixed on her with a dazzling vividity.***Below the museum\u2019s dome was a little cafe selling refreshments where visitors could rest and refuel their stomachs. Leyla and Kyle had already had lunch at that place when they came on the first day of their visit.Matthias took the lead in heading there. Knowing the meaning, Leyla stood still, a scowl on her face.\u201cIt was nice to meet you, duke. I\u2019m going to take my leave now.\u201dAt her words, Matthias turned around. Leyla steeled herself, bowed her head in greeting, and began to walk to the other way.\u201cThere.\u201dHe commanded.She refused to comply and took a few more steps, but at the end she failed to escape.Matthias had passed by her and blocked her way.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dLeyla looked around her and asked sharply. Some passersby narrowed their eyes, staring at them in a bit of wonder.\u201cI hate it.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Someone like you, I hate it.\u201dMatthias\u2019 arrogant attitude suddenly drove her up a wall.\u201cYou can\u2019t be like this to me.\u201d Leyla clasped the straps of her bag, which she was carrying over her shoulders. Her hands trembling nervously,\u201cI-I mean\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want to do something that we shouldn\u2019t do?\u201dA smile teased the corner of his lips as he stated it in a somewhat sarcastic tone. For a short moment, a maddening rush swept through Leyla\u2019s body and knitted her brows in disbelief.\u201cNo!\u201dBoth of her hands began to shake fiercely after Matthias made such offensive remarks,\u201cNever!\u201dA sharp feeling of heat seared Leyla\u2019s cheeks. Her face became blazing red as she seethed with rage. The humiliation Matthias piled on her had trodden on her toes. Mainly because how aloof and arrogant he was when he said so.After a few moments of looking around his surroundings, Matthias returned his gaze to her.\u201cI want to buy a cup of tea for an orphan who lives on my estate I happened to meet while in the capital city. What\u2019s wrong with me being kindness?\u201dHis attitude consistently unabashed even when he said something disrespectful.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201dMatthias spoke coldly. His face lost its grin.\u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Leyla?\u201dEnding his question that he had answered himself, Matthias slithered his way to the cafe.Leyla let out a long, weak sigh as she looked at his back.Though she didn\u2019t know Duke Herhard very well, she now knew one crucial aspect about him:achieving everything he desired at whatever cost. The more challenging something was to get, the more valuable it was to own.That man always had to get what he wanted.Giving up, Leyla walked behind the duke with heaviness in her stride.***They were sitting across from each other.Shortly after the take-out order was made, the waiter brought two cups of steaming hot coffee to their table. The teacup billowed a cloud of white smoke, which rose into the air; had been laid between the two people who were appearing to be silent.\u201cI never thought I\u2019d meet you by coincidence in a place like this.\u201dLayla opened the conversation with some trepidation. She was feeling awkward with the stillness between them, so she decided to speak up first.\u201cIn the natural history museum\u2026do you\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201dMatthias cut her words, taking a sip of his coffee.\u201cYou already know it, Leyla.\u201dA smirk hung on the corner of his lips. \u201cI have absolutely no interest in these kinds of things.\u201d\u201cThen why you\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou already know it\u2019s not a coincidence.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dLeyla replied reflexively. Her whole body grew tense, and her heart began to beat in a blue funk. She would rather be an impoverished orphan who would get pity from him. She didn\u2019t want to be seen as \u2018something\u2019 else by this man in any way.\u201cAll I know is\u2026\u201dThe sound of her voice was a bundle in nerves, and Leyla gulped back her agitation for a moment.\u201cAll I know is just that, you hate me.\u201dLeyla closed her eyes as if she were trying to erase the horrifying memories of their first kiss that suddenly dawned on her. But it was to no avail. Once she blinked her eyes to see, Matthias\u2019 blue eyes were still fixed on her, and those memories flooded back in, anchoring her to the nightmare once again.\u201cRight, I hate you.\u201dMatthias assented her words with ease. A smile bloomed on his face.\u201cNow, I terribly hate you, Leyla.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he looked at her with a cold glint in his eyes, Leyla felt her heart leap into her mouth.\u201cI\u2019ll leave then.\u201dAs she spoke, Leyla dipped her gaze into the teacup in front of her, utterly disregarding his presence.\u201c\u2026 Pardon?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be staying there anymore. I\u2019ll leave and won\u2019t be a bother in your estate.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cAnywhere.\u201dShe clenched her fist which began to shiver, together with the chill she felt. Don\u2019t be scared\u2013 Leyla reassured herself, though she knew it was a fool\u2019s errand.\u201cArvis isn\u2019t the only place in this world where I can make a home for myself.\u201dHer words lost none of their venoms, spewing a thorn as sharp as the blow he spat to her. But Matthias simply gave her the cold shoulder, taking her grumbling as a passing whim.Leyla wanted to flee from her seat and get out of there as soon as possible, but what happened last summer\u2014the day she lost her hat and fell into a freezing river because she refused to eat what he offered her, had presented itself in her mind and pinned her feet firmly in place.She didn\u2019t want to go through that trauma all over again.As she set her sight on the teacup, Leyla sipped her hot coffee in a hurry. She almost choked, but Leyla managed to finish it in one gulp, until the teacup revealed its bottom. Then, she sucked in a long breath to calm herself.\u201cLeyla.\u201d sibilated Matthias, pointing at her.Lelya stiffened and hurriedly took out the money from her purse and put it on the table\u2019s edge.Matthias scoffed, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s money to pay for the coffee I drank.\u201d Leyla opened her lips and struggled to get the words out. Her gaze remained affixed on his finger.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m the kind of person who needs someone like you to pay for a cup of coffee?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but I don\u2019t want to receive anything from you.\u201dWith that phrase, Leyla felt a chill run down her spine. The trembling began anew as her hands became soaked with cold sweat, and her fingers turned a paler hue. Still, her inquisitiveness won against her, in the end.Because this place wasn\u2019t Arvis, where Leyla Lewellin used to live the life of a poor orphan under his world.\u201cLift your head.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cLift your head, Leyla.\u201d\u201cStop bossing me around.\u201dThe mounting exasperation tightened her throat. She looked daggers at Matthias with a blaze of indignation burning furiously in her eyes.\u201cI am not your maid.\u201dA sudden rush of reckless courage had obliterated the ripples of dread that had been roiling within her for some time, heating her response.\u201cMaid?\u201d\u201cI was obviously raised by Uncle Bill in Arvis, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m your maid.\u201d\u201cIs that so? What are you, then?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m a nobody.\u201dThe corner of her eyes faintly flushed\u201cI have been and will always be.\u201dA sharp pain seared through her feelings right at the moment. Her emerald eyes were moist with tears as she glowered at Matthias. But even so, she still got a hold of him and even ventured to confront him.Matthias just held his coffee cup\u2019s handle wordlessly. He mused about the day he wished to strangle Leyla Lewellin, and he longed to do so again right now.The sweltering heat of a late summer day afternoon; when he felt as filthy as his messed-up clothes after rolling around on the dirt ground. When he went ballistic at the acts of a mere worthless woman.What if I had strangled you then\u2026In his mind, Matthias concluded that what he felt at the time wasn\u2019t quite as bad as what he was presently feeling. Right now, he felt like a freak. The feeling of being carried away by an inexplicable desire and compulsive obsession over a no-name woman disgusted him the most.Matthias took the money that she had left on the table and rose from his seat. Then, he dropped it one by one onto her lap.\u201cTake it.\u201dLeyla glowered at him. Taking in her eyes, which turned a livid red, Matthias threw some of his gold coins down her skirt. \u201cAnd this, too.\u201d\u201cW-what are you\u2026\u201d\u201cThank-you; is what you should say, Leyla.\u201dMatthias scoffed in ridicule.\u201cSimilar to how you receive Claudine\u2019s money. With gratitude. With courtesy.Leyla\u2019s eyes blurred as he snickered, but she wouldn\u2019t let her tears fall. She twitched her lips to counter his severity, yet words slinked and slid off her tongue.\u201cI\u2019ve taken away your time, even though you\u2019re not my maid, so I\u2019ll pay you your labor fee.\u201dA great tremor now overtook her. Leyla gritted her teeth, but hot torrents of grief already coursed down her face.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, simply think of it as my sympathy for the poor orphan.\u201dTears began to tickle her cheek. Deep emotions stirred with no other outlet but through her long-lasting sobs dripping down like a piece of jewelry.\u201cHow silly, you bootlick a guy who wants to marry you out of pity and it\u2019s amusing to watch how you build your self-esteem so high just for a few little coins.\u201d / You bootlick a guy who wants to marry you out of pity, yet you wish to sustain your pride for a few coins. How amusing.Matthias\u2019 sneer was like an invisible thread that pulled her over. Leyla gallantly scowled at him, but her total disgruntlement had already converted into tears that continued to rain down her cheeks like a river leaving a dam.Matthias walked out of the cafe with a satisfied smile plastered on his face.Leyla Lewellin was a woman who never once smiled in his presence, but she was also the woman who, whenever he came into contact with her, would break down and cry uncontrollably.If I can\u2019t make you smile, then I will make you cry.Her laughter or tears, Matthias loved her in all of her manifestations. If he only could give her pain, he would hurt her as deeply as he could.At the very least, you wouldn\u2019t see me as a tiny blot in your life.Before leaving the cafe, Matthias turned around and gave her face a good stare. Leyla wiped her cheek every few second as she cried; her glasses laid on the table\u2019s edge.Matthias made a wish as his long strides slowly brought him to leave the Natural History Museum.May Leyla soon marry the doctor\u2019s son, and disappear from my world.And may the tears and wounds I had sculpted, last forever in her memory.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The sun had already drowned itself on the west skysill, but Leyla hadn\u2019t returned to her hotel yet.Kyle, looking for Leyla at her hotel to have dinner with her, exited the lobby with a worried face. Though she was a little kid no longer, this city was a stranger to her; bad people might be clustered everywhere.\u201cWell, she has no fear, but still\u2026..\u201dKyle took a hesitant stride along the street. His mind was racing faster than his feet. He had assumed she would be at the museum, but it had already closed by the time he had arrived. The search for her had taken him all across town, but Leyla was nowhere to be seen.Is she lost?Kyle darted past people, buildings, and trees.If not, has she met a bad guy?Kyle wanted to bury all of the negative thoughts that had crossed his head; he didn\u2019t even want to consider the possibility.It was then that he found her.Leyla stood before a fountain in the park square at the end of the museum street and dubiously threw a coin towards the statue of the water fountain.\u201cLeyla!\u201dHer eyes naturally moved towards the direction of the voice that was calling her name.\u201cUh, Kyle?\u201dLeyla seemed befuddled as if she had no idea that she had scared someone out of his wits.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dKyle approached her, brushing the sweat-drenched hair from his forehead.\u201cKyle, why are you here? How about your exam preparations?\u201d\u201cDoes it matter right now? You really\u2026 Seriously, you\u2026.\u201dKyle grabbed her shoulder. He slowly drew a breath and let it back out with a loud sigh. It wasn\u2019t long before his daunting gasps calmed down a little.\u201cAre you alright? Would you like to have a seat?\u201d Leyla asked; her eyes were drawn to his face with worry.\u2018Who cares about who now?\u2019Kyle clasped his heated palms over Leyla\u2019s face and heaved a long sigh that sounded more like a mournful laugh. It was then that he noticed that her eyes had swelled and reddened a bit.\u201cLeyla, are you crying?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201dLeyla answered his question in such a hurry as if she had run out of words, which only made Kyle even more sure that she had been crying.\u201cWhy did you cry?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWho made you cry?\u201d\u201cNo one, it\u2019s nothing like that,\u201d Leyla smiled and gently pushed his hand away. \u201cI just, uh, looked around the museum. Took a walk in the park and made a wish.\u201d\u201cWish?\u201d\u201cYeah. I saw everyone doing it.\u201dLeyla gestured with her finger toward the fountain in the middle of the park. People with bright smiles on their faces were throwing their coins into the fountain and making wishes.\u201cI also made a wish for you to get into medical school.\u201d\u201cAre you sure you threw it accurately?\u201dKyle began to chuckle as he pointed to the water bowl the statue was holding. The disappointed moans of those who failed to throw their coins into the pot resounded across the throng.\u201cOf course I made it,\u201d said Leyla with a proud smile on her face, \u201cI\u2019m really good at this thing.\u201d\u201cI know, I can already imagine it.\u201d\u201cIt is already dinner time. Are you hungry? Let\u2019s make one more wish before we go.\u201dLeyla made a beeline for the fountain, holding a shiny gold coin in her hand. Kyle, to her surprise, obediently trod on his heels from behind.\u201cLeyla! Do you seriously want to throw your gold coins there? To that fountain? A penny-pincher like you?\u201dIn lieu of responding, Leyla pitched the coin with all her might. Unluckily for her, the gold coin hit the edge of the bowl and bounced off towards another side. She gasped and frowned, dismay enveloping her face.\u201cLeyla, are you really good at this?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you believe me? I successfully threw all of my coins in one fell swoop just now!\u201d\u201cJust how many gold coins did you throw, huh?\u201d Kyle asked in a giggle at her slipshod feat that wasn\u2019t like her at all.\u201cOkay. Since I\u2019ve already given a big donation to the Ratz\u2019s fountain today, I\u2019ll toss in one more coin.\u201d\u201cAre you going to throw another one? That\u2019s enough! Don\u2019t do it!\u201dKyle snatched the coin from Leyla\u2019s grasp, leaving her to scowl and lunge for his hand in annoyance. \u201cIt must be spent!\u201d\u201cYou may say that, but how many gold coins have you already thrown in there?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the value of money.\u201d\u201cIs there money that needs to be wasted for nothing like this?\u201d\u201cThere is!\u201d Layla shrieked.\u201cEnough! Don\u2019t throw any more money. It\u2019s a waste. If you want to squander money, let\u2019s go and get some ice cream.\u201d\u201cYou really do look like Leyla Lewellin when you say that.\u201d\u201cWhatever.\u201d Kyle shrugged his shoulders and put the coin back into his pocket. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe knew Leyla would reject his hand, but Kyle still extended his to her. Leyla lightly clapped his hand and seized the lead by taking a small step ahead of him.Kyle was moving quickly to catch up with her\u201cHey, what did you wish for?\u201d\u201cI wished for Uncle Bill\u2019s well-being and happiness. Then for you to get into college and become a good doctor. And I wished to be a decent grownup. That\u2019s all of the wishes I had for us.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s the last one?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cThe last wish of your failed attempt.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dLeyla\u2019s face suddenly grew sour.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d She abruptly shook her head in disgust and widened her stride.Kyle just chuckled cheerfully, his face lighted up with interest.\u201cLet\u2019s get something delicious to eat, shall we? I\u2019ve been frantically running around searching for you, and now I\u2019m starving to death.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Dr. Etman heaved a sigh before he opened the bedroom door.When he switched on the light, he saw that his wife was already lying on the bed. She had been like this ever since Kyle and Leyla had left for Ratz to take their exams.\u201cDear, dinner is ready. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mind me.\u201dHer voice sounded icy, which contrasted with her lackluster appearance.\u201cI understand how you feel, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo. You don\u2019t. The generous and benevolent Dr. Etman would never understand.\u201dHer eyes were ablaze with anger.\u201cBut dear, you also like Leyla, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes. I know. Leyla is a good girl. If it weren\u2019t for you and Kyle, I would have continued to like her.\u201d\u201cMarrying Kyle won\u2019t change Leyla, dear. It\u2019s just that Kyle will marry that good girl that he truly loves.\u201d\u201cYou might think of me as an exorbitant snob, but marriage is a reality. This marriage is degrading our son, and you\u2019re allowing it to happen!\u201d\u201cDear, the world will keep changing. Someone\u2019s social status will soon become an outmoded value.\u201dMrs. Etman arranged her long, flowing hair into a bun and pulled it up neatly before getting out of bed. She stared at her husband with an upset face; she didn\u2019t exactly look like someone who had been starving for days.\u201cIn a world where people live, social status won\u2019t disappear. Even if the title is no longer in use, something else will separate society\u2019s social classes in the future.\u201d\u201cDear\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd whatever the standards are, the fact that Leyla is not a good fit for our Kyle will never change. Ever.\u201dRounding off the talk with those bitter words, Mrs. Etman walked past her husband.Dr. Etman watched his wife\u2019s back, who had left towards the garden, and smiled faintly to the maid, who was standing there looking confused.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Becker. Please clean the dinner table.\u201dWith a sigh, Dr. Etman followed his wife into the unlit garden at this hour of the night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kyle was keen on staying with her though she had told him to hurry back and prepare for tomorrow\u2019s exam.\u201cI need to digest the food first so I can properly prepare for tomorrow\u2019s test.\u201dLeyla belted up, unable to come up with a retort to his confident reasoning.\u201cLet\u2019s walk for a bit then,\u201d she said, \u201cbut Kyle\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to marry me?\u201dLeyla asked cautiously. The aftertaste of cold, sweet ice cream smeared on her lips.\u201cIf you\u2019re just doing it out of pity\u2026.\u201d\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dKyle cut her off, calling her name firmly, and stepped in front of Leyla, who was a little startled by his frigid voice.\u201cDo you see me as the kind of crazy guy who marries someone out of sympathy?\u201dHis unfamiliar expression made Leyla freeze in her tracks, and she fell silent.\u201cWell, the world is wide. There might be a lot of crazy people who marry for such reasons, but I\u2019m not one of them.\u201dKyle eased the air out of his lungs slowly, letting his temper settle.\u201cDo you know why? It\u2019s because I love you.\u201d\u201cKyle\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my only reason. Because I love Leyla Lewellin.\u201dAs he looked down at Leyla\u2019s cocked eyebrow, Kyle sighed and then chuckled. \u201cWho do you think is more pitiful? Me, who\u2019s been rejected hundreds of times or you? I\u2019m the sadder one, Leyla.\u201dKyle said as he began to ruffle Leyla\u2019s hair and moved a step ahead. He didn\u2019t want Leyla to see what expression he was making right now, which must have been pretty silly.As if she knew what he was going through, Leyla followed him from behind, creating some distance between them.After travelling home shackled in deafening silence, the two finally arrived in front of the hotel.\u201cGo in,\u201d Kyle told her. With a smile on his face, he added, \u201cOh, I forgot, I haven\u2019t done it today.\u201dHe slowly lifted his eyes after staring down at the cup of melting ice cream in his hand. He had remembered something.\u201cLeyla, let\u2019s get married.\u201dThe turndown was already flashing before his very eyes, though. Yet Kyle felt a little weird skipping it now since Leyla\u2019s rejection had become something of a daily routine for him.For some reason, today, Leyla, who was accustomed to rejecting his proposal with a nonchalant shrug, was unusually quiet.Kyle looked at her with his eyes narrowed as he studied her attentively. \u201cI\u2019m not getting married,\u201d He readied to hear such a sweet but heartless response that was supposed to come from her slowly parted lips. But instead, her response was something beyond his wildest dreams.\u201cMm.\u201d\u201c\u2026Leyla?\u201dKyle jolted in surprise. The ice cream cup he was holding fell to the ground, soiling the tip of his shoe.The words failed him. He was in a conundrum at her straightforward reply.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026 So, do you agree to marry me?\u201dAs he made sure, Leyla lowered her head and nodded.\u201cYou want to marry, right? Me?\u201dHe repeated the question in a shaky voice. Leyla glimpsed at him sheepishly and nodded her head slightly once more.She was momentarily at a loss for words. But Kyle was already screaming in delight as he held her by the shoulders.\u201cWoohooooooo!\u201dTheir shindig floored guests at the hotel who happened to pass by stared at them. Kyle didn\u2019t seem to care even though Leyla let out her scream when he spun her around.It was a beautiful spring night.A gentle wind was lulling the city back to its slumber.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*That night Kyle had a dream.He dreamed of marrying Leyla and living their everyday life in complete bliss as an Etman couple.Leyla once said to him; having her own house with a small flower bed was her long-held dream. She smiled shyly and voiced her happiness. She wished the roses she had planted in the garden were all blooming beautifully.In his dream, he saw Leyla diligently tending to that very flower garden. The little child who was running alongside her was more lovely than a blossoming rose.The sun shone brilliantly, and the child\u2019s laughter was brimming with glee.\u2018Daddy\u2014!\u2019The child who saw him quickly came running. She was a pretty little girl who looked a lot like Leyla with her blonde hair. The child, still a toddler, jumped on his feet and welcomed him with her eyes sparkling.The whiff of air caressed him as he walked to her with their lovely daughter in his arms. The scent of sweet roses borne by the fluttering wind faintly tickled the tip of his nose in a pleasant way.Leyla laughed as her eyes held his a moment longer. Her smile was so beautiful, perhaps even more beautiful than his beautiful dream had been.In the fading remnants of his dream, Kyle awakened with the phosphenes still in his eyes. Thanks to that feeling of happiness, he performed much better than he expected on the exam.He couldn\u2019t believe it.Will his dream soon come true?Is there such a thing as a beautiful blessing in this world greater than that?Once he stepped out of the exam hall, Kyle had the feeling that he could leap to great heights in the sky. His footfall seemed to have wings, he felt free like a bird just leaving its nest the moment he spotted Leyla sitting on a bench outside, waiting for him.\u201cLeyla!\u201dLeyla raised her head at his shout. She folded the small notebook she was reading and put it back into her sling bag.\u201cHow was the test?\u201d She approached him blithely. \u201cWas it hard? Did you do well?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re always worried about everything.\u201d Kyle tucked his chin up as though he were flaunting. \u201cI\u2019m Kyle Etman. I don\u2019t know how to get second place in studies.\u201d\u201cOh, hahaha. You did great, then.\u201dLeyla hooted with laughter.\u201cI forgot how smart Mr. Etman was for a moment.\u201d\u201cWow. That makes me very sad to hear. Make sure you keep it in your mind from now on.\u201dKyle suddenly grabbed her hand. Leyla didn\u2019t wave his hand away though his touch took her by surprise.While she was looking at him, the late afternoon spring sunlight in dazzling crimson gold glowed on the corner of his lips as he gave a gentle smile back to her.\u201cAre you sure you did well on the exam?\u201d asked Leyla carefully, as she looked like she couldn\u2019t shake off her trepidation.Kyle grinned at her after seeing how adorable she was. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t fail the exam, so there won\u2019t be anything bad that may prevent us from attending college together.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2026.\u201dLeyla\u2019s cheeks were flushed with rosy pink. The moment he caught the sight of her adorable, sweet ripe-peach face, Kyle\u2019s heart began to skip a beat erratically. He regretted that they were at the exam location presently. If they had been on an empty street, Kyle would have mustered up his guts to kiss her right at this moment.\u2018No.\u2019\u2018If I do that for no reason, Leyla will get scared, so I\u2019d better wait for a little bit longer.\u2019One of his thoughts wandered back to the shovel, which he had forgotten about. The giant shovel full of dirt, and Uncle Bill\u2019s alarming smile.The two slowly hiked around the campus, with hands intertwined tightly. Walking from the medical facility where Kyle would study as a doctor, then to the biology hall where Leyla would be enrolling in the future. They laughed and chatted excitedly and had a great time along the way.\u201cYou will definitely pass, but it may be a bit difficult for me.\u201dLeyla muttered with a serious face as she reached the biology faculty building.\u201cWhy are you worried about that? Didn\u2019t you do well on your exams?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but only a few female students took the exam earlier.\u201dHer countenance became more gloomy as the talk continued.Kyle nodded his head, \u201cAh\u2026 that\u2019s right.\u201d He momentarily sighed a little.It had only been a few years ago since women were allowed to pursue higher education at the same level as the men in the Empire\u2019s universities. Due to the rigorous selection process, only a few students could pass since the threshold for college admission test scores was much higher for female students.\u201cStill, I\u2019m sure you will pass.\u201dKyle spoke with confidence.\u201cIf you don\u2019t pass, who else will?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re being overconfident?\u201d\u201cNot in the least. This is my opinion based on your grades during your eight years of school.\u201d\u201cEight years\u2026 So much time has passed already.\u201dLeyla could still vividly remember the road she had ridden to Arvis by a mail wagon. Time had passed by in a flash. The well-grown Kyle who was standing before her eyes suddenly felt like a new person.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dKyle, who was a little embarrassed from the deep gaze fixated on him, asked awkwardly.\u201cYou have grown so much.\u201dAmazement reigned in Leyla\u2019s eyes as she stared at him for a moment. Stunned, Kyle was utterly at a loss for what to do as though fluffy feathers were popping from his chest. Leyla Lewellin\u2019s attractiveness didn\u2019t appear to diminish even when she uttered such ridiculous things, leaving him speechless.\u201cUh-huh.\u201dKyle gave a false smile. He took a deep breath and continued,\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve grown up well to be a decent husband. Do you like it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201dLeyla stiffly hastened her stride. Kyle couldn\u2019t stop himself from grinning from ear to ear when he saw her face was daubed with shyness.On their way back, Kyle talked about his pleasant dreams, which would soon become a reality.About the house\u2014how they would live together. Their daily life as husband and wife. And also, their soon-to-be-born, beautiful child in the future.He was keen to write a fresh chapter in the history of the Etman family, along with their offspring.Kyle cherished the look of cautious eagerness that graced her face when he talked about that dream. He was ecstatic to see those hopes and dreams were on the cusp of becoming a reality.It was a rather funny and sentimental thought. But he believed it was the reason why he was born into this world\u2014to make her expectation come true.\u201cHow many children do you want to have?\u201d Kyle asked her, \u201cI wish I had a daughter and a son.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 maybe five?\u201d she answered.\u2018Fi\u2026Five?\u2019\u00a0Kyle stood gaping. The number she said was in contrast to her timid attitude.\u201cWe won\u2019t be lonely if we have so many kids,\u201d Leyla chuckled and continued, \u201cWe can depend on one another. I think it would be great if the house were full of people who resembled one another.\u201dFor some reason, Kyle felt bitter when he saw Leyla say those things with a radiant look. He could tell by gazing at Leyla\u2019s bittersweet smile how long she had lived in loneliness.\u201cFive\u2026 okay, Leyla. I\u2019ll do my best!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dLeyla\u2019s eyes grew round at Kyle\u2019s loud pledge. They looked at each other with blank expressions for a spilt second, then their cheeks blushed nearly at the exact moment.\u201cHey, that\u2019s not what I meant!\u201dKyle took a step back, he had a redder complexion than hers.\u201cI\u2019m not thinking only about that.\u201d\u201cNeither am I!\u201d Leyla snapped back, ashamed by his words.The two quickly released their grip and walked a step apart, not daring to make eye contact. Kyle gave Leyla a sideways look, and the peals of laughter he\u2019d been holding in eventually burst from deep within.\u201cBy the way, Leyla, did you feel ashamed after deciding to have five children?\u201dGasp.\u00a0Leyla turned away. Her brows knitted.\u201cYou didn\u2019t think a stork would give you five babies, did you? Our Miss Lewellin, who is well-versed in all subjects except geometry.\u201dLeyla kept walking, a scowl on her face, disregarding his mischievous teasing. Kyle\u2019s jolly laughter grew louder along with the clacking of her heeled shoes.\u201cOh wait for me, Mrs Etman!\u201dHis jovial cry reverberated across the campus on a sunny spring day.Leyla started to run. Her braided ponytail on the back of her head swung in rhythm with her stomping shoes on the asphalt.Kyle was smitten with the look of her back. Her statuette gave him the feeling of returning to that pleasant dream once again.And he didn\u2019t want to ever wake up.Forever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Duke seemed to take it into account as he couldn\u2019t rule out his grandmother\u2019s request.Oh, whatever.Leyla stretched her apron and laced it tightly around her waist. The matter had nothing to do with her, though. She merely lamented that her bouncing gold coin had hindered her wish from coming true.\u2018Please don\u2019t let me run into Duke Herhardt again.\u2019Leyla fervently prayed as she threw the last gold coin he had given her onto the fountain.Since last summer, after he left Arvis Estate, Matthias hadn\u2019t returned for a single day visit till the end of the year. Leyla thought her prayer had been granted by all means; the peaceful days of her life would last until his military service was over, and she would have already left Arvis by the time he returned home.Leyla fell into a daze for a moment, but soon, she shook her head and walked out towards the backyard. Besides, her wish would likely come true since she would have already left the Arvis forest by the time the Duke arrived back from his trip.With a lighter heart, Leyla started caring for the livestock and tended to the garden diligently. The moment her morning routine was winding down, Phoebe, the mountain pigeon, returned from the Etmans\u2019 house, bringing a letter from Kyle that was attached to its ankle.\u2018My mom wants to invite you to dinner tonight.\u2019\u2018See, Leyla. I was right, huh?\u2019She could hear Kyle\u2019s voice in the letter.After seeing her anxiety, Kyle had reassured her a million times that his mother would like her and that she would be accepted in his family.\u2018Everything will be fine.\u2019 He soothed her. When the autumn dawned, they would become a campus couple and enjoy their college years together happily, very happily.\u201cUncle, I\u2019ll have dinner at Etmans\u2019 house tonight.\u201d Leyla approached Uncle Bill, who had just gotten home from work. \u201cMrs. Etman invited me.\u201d\u201cLook, what did I say before,\u201d said Bill in a raspy voice, reiterating the same thing Kyle had said in the letter. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that everything would be all right?\u201dLooking upon his gleeful face, Leyla also gave a soft smile of her own. Her heart was pounding. She put her faith in his words and was looking forward for tonight\u2019s dinner.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The evening sun had cast long shadows on the ground when Matthias arrived in Arvis manor. The tension didn\u2019t escape the faces of the waiting staff in line when the car transporting him appeared in front of the lobby.Everything was in the groove. He was welcomed with loving arms with courtesies and was given some joyful smiles from the two Duchesses, who were standing next to him.Every time he passed in front of the gardener, Matthias tended to lower his gaze. A little girl in neat brown shoes always stood in line next to the gardener\u2019s big feet, ready to greet him whenever he came home. But Leyla Lewellin, who had always been by Bill Remmer\u2019s side, would no longer be here after the summer season ended.Matthias walked past the gardener without even bothering to look at him. His sight turned back towards the front entrance, where he could see the stairwell in the lobby leading to the manor\u2019s main hall.\u201cOh my, that bird also returned with you.\u201dElysee von Herhardt chuckled the moment she gazed upon the gilded cage that a servant was holding. Inside the cage, there was a little canary that Matthias had brought with him when he departed the Estate last summer.\u201cWhat a very strange thing. How could Matthias, who has never even had a pet dog, take care of a bird?\u201d\u201cIf you have a hobby with birds, why don\u2019t you expand the greenhouse a bit more and bring in different kinds of birds?\u201d suggested Norma with a smile on her face.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Grandma.\u201d Matthias grinned as he said. \u201cOne is enough.\u201dAfter giving a prudent answer, Matthias entered the mansion.Before going up the stairwell, Matthias reared his head and gazed at the huge chandelier for a long, thoughtful moment. Right above it, the insignia of the Herhardt family was emblazoned on its distantly high ceiling.He was born under that crest. He lived beneath that crest, and he would close his eyes under that crest. It was a natural cycle\u2014just as breathing in, just as easy as he was living.Matthias lowered his gaze and started ascending a flight of steps.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cIf he had retired this year, why would he still want to put it off another year?\u201dCountess Brandt grumbled beneath her breath. Her voice was laced with annoyance that she couldn\u2019t keep hidden.The reason she had agreed in the first place to extend her daughter\u2019s engagement period for another year was solely out of respect for Duke Herhard\u2019s choice to serve the Empire. Nonetheless, if she had known what was going to happen, she would have insisted on having the wedding by the end of this summer, no matter what.\u201cI had no idea Matthias was such a fickle guy.\u201d\u201cOur wedding has been postponed,\u201d Claudine passively said, \u201cbut I think it would be better if Duke Herhardt returned to the Estate earlier, mother.\u201d Nothing on her face indicated that she was upset.\u201cYou seem so relaxed. This mother of yours is very worried to see her daughter unable to marry this year.\u201d\u201cIs there any reason to be concerned? It is better to take the time to properly prepare rather than have a wedding that is less than perfect due to hastiness.\u201d\u201cOne year is a long period of time, Claudine. How do you know what might happen within a year?\u201d\u201cThink about last year, mother. A year passed in a flash\u2014and peacefully. We just have to wait one more year. Wedding preparations will also be easier if Duke Herhardt stays on the estate.\u201d\u201cClaudine, men aren\u2019t to be trusted, and engagement isn\u2019t a binding commitment like marriage.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s Matthias von Herhardt, mother.\u201d With a nonchalant face, Claudine added \u201cHe is Duke Herhardt, a man who will never love anyone but himself.\u201dClaudine might as well have been feeling uneasy about her wedding if she hadn\u2019t heard the news that Leyla and the doctor\u2019s son were getting married. But now that Leyla Lewellin was a fly in the ointment no longer, her mother\u2019s worries were nothing more than the elderly\u2019s fuddy-duddy fears.\u201cFor him, this engagement is also a symbol of pride for the Herhardts. There\u2019s no one who can get in the way.\u201dClaudine spoke her thoughts with confidence as she cut and neatened the embroidery thread.The kind yet heartless man.Since childhood, that\u2019s how Matthias was nicknamed. While her other cousins often made fun of Claudine with their snarky jokes, only Matthias remained polite and kind to her. Whereas, his good samaritan attitude also built a barrier between them and made him a difficult man to attract.\u2018Does he even have feelings?\u2019Claudine sometimes wondered about it.It was difficult for her to envision Matthias being angry, sad, or happy.From the beginning of his life to this day, he seemed to look down on the world with his arrogant yet elegant smile. And this Matthias von Herhardt was something Claudine wanted to own.\u201cI should visit Arvis sometime next week.\u201dClaudine rose from the sofa, her mood became a bit lighter.\u201cI want to meet Duke Herhardt and congratulate my friend who is getting married soon. It\u2019s for both of these reasons.\u201d\u201cA friend who\u2019s getting married? Oh my goodness. By \u2018friend\u2019 did you mean the gardener\u2019s orphan?\u201dCountess Brandt gave a fretful moue. Claudine smiled without a hitch to her mother and said,\u201cLeyla is my friend. Of course, I have to give my old friend a wedding present.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla wrapped herself in a white dress she had bought in Ratz after so much consideration when she travelled there to take the exam. Her golden hair was nicely braided, and she adorned the end of her hair with her favourite ribbon.This was not her first visit to the Etman household, but Leyla felt uneasy for some reason. Her insides felt queasy as if this was her first.The thought of her upcoming marriage to Kyle exacerbated her nerves, and the fact that the person who personally invited her was Kyle\u2019s mother further added to her concerns.\u201cUncle, how do I look?\u201dLeyla walked out of her room. She stood in front of Bill and asked with a solemn expression. Bill, who was mellowing out by the opened window with his mouth smoking his cigarette, looked at Leyla and grinned widely.\u201cWooho\u2026 Since you\u2019re going to get married soon, it seems you\u2019re going all-out in dressing up unlike before.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, I\u2019m just really nervous about meeting Mrs. Etman.\u201d\u201cGoodness me! Haven\u2019t you already met Mrs. Etman once or twice before?\u201d\u201cBut today is a special event.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. It won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Bill gave a gentle smile as he stubbed out his cigarette and got up from his seat. \u201cYou just have to be yourself, Leyla. That\u2019s enough.\u201dBill gently patted Leyla\u2019s shoulder. His smiling face felt warm, so did his hand.Leyla smiled. She willingly nodded, even though she knew it was simply his subjective point of view. After a whole day of fretting, she was finally able to relax a little bit. Kyle arrived in the cottage at that moment.\u201cKyle, I\u2026.\u201d\u201cPerfect.\u201dKyle lauded her before Leyla could raise a question.\u201cJust be yourself.\u201d He cracked a smile. His gaze was warm, identical to Uncle Bill\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s all you need, Leyla.\u201d Kyle reassured her.\u201cWell. Someone else had said precisely the same thing as you did.\u201d Leyla giggled as she witnessed two people with the same expression and said say very similar the exact same things.\u201cWhat? Who? What kind of person?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk crap and get going, you little prick.\u201d Bill smacked Kyle on the back with all his might. Kyle staggered back and turned around, his face scrunched up.\u201cBut, uncle, some jerk is hitting on her\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat jerk is me!\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 uh, what!?\u201d\u201cYou spoiled gluttonous brat, you! I\u2019ll seriously consider whether or not I can entrust Leyla to you.\u201dContrary to his scathing tone, Bill Remmer kindly patted Kyle on the shoulder. Leyla stood aside and quietly watched the pair\u2019s bickering.Her two most beloved people in the world. Her two precious people. Two people she wanted to protect by all means.Her heart began to warm, a smile blossomed on her face. Uncle Bill and Kyle were her everything, and Leyla couldn\u2019t fathom living her life without those two by her side.That\u2019s why Leyla decided to get married after a long shilly-shallying.As Kyle proposed to her and she turned him down, the strain in their relationship grew bigger. If she couldn\u2019t accept his feelings, it would be right for her to walk away. Kyle tried hard to narrow the distance between them, but since he had already revealed his feelings, they were faced with two choices.Get married or become strangers.It would crush her innermost hope for them to stick as dear friends forever if they grew up by keeping their distance from one another.Leyla could feel her heart breaking every time she thought of them, from the fall through the winter, and into the spring living as strangers.For Leyla, the marriage and the future that Kyle had proffered to her, was a vague picture in the distance. She was cowed into indulging her avarice to a line that was beyond her reach. But if it was the only way for her not to lose Kyle,Leyla wanted to be brave.It was late spring; after Duke Herhardt had insulted her until she cried her eyes out, Leyla finally made up her mind. On that night, she dumped his gold coins into a fountain because she didn\u2019t desire anything he had given to her, then she saw Kyle\u2019s face, who had come searching for her soon after that.The moment she met Kyle, all of the sadness and grief in her heart were wholly forgotten. He stood out like a beacon of light amidst a dark forest. Like the warm light from Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage, which always awaited her return, and belighted her voyage through the dark forest trail. That glint of light became her solace and comforted all of her wounds that the world beyond the forest had given to her.Wontedly, Kyle and Bill\u2019s futile argument ended with a jolly laugh. With a lingering peal of a smile still hardened on his face, Kyle walked up to her.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Leyla.\u201dKyle reached out his hand to her. With some reluctance, Leyla grabbed the tip of his. Kyle held his gaze at her for a long moment. He grinned and then gently took her hand. So intimate and in such a tight hold.Though the changing of their relationship was still very awkward and embarrassing, Leyla didn\u2019t brush-off his hand.Because he was Kyle.The person she didn\u2019t want to lose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leyla, as well as Dr. Etman and Kyle, were dazed by the warm hospitality presented by the Lady of the House, which was something above their expectation.\u201cThank you for the invitation, Mrs. Etman.\u201dLeyla delivered a greeting which she had rehearsed dozens of times during the day and politely handed over the gift she had prepared: a bouquet of roses and pickled peaches parcelled nicely in a beautiful mason jar.\u201cThank you.\u201dMrs. Etman gladly accepted the gift. As a heave of sigh washed over her, Leyla\u2019s face lit up and Kyle\u2019s lips twitched like a grin. Mrs. Etman\u2019s eyes grew icily cold as she watched her son, yet she deftly set her expression like a Mother who was full of tenderness.Dr. Etman alluded that they\u2019d tie the knot after the College\u2019s enrollment announcement was released. However, since Kyle and Leyla were both unquestionably accepted, it could be said that their marriage had been officially confirmed.\u2018My son is together with such a girl.\u2019Mrs Etman slowly clenched her hand beneath the table. She was disenchanted, yet she had stalled voicing her disapproval. She clearly knew what kind of people her son and husband were. Her intransigent opposition had only served to backfire back on her in the end.\u201cEat a lot, Leyla.\u201d Mrs. Etman\u2019s expression softened after taking a deep breath. \u201cI specially prepared the food to your taste.\u201d She looked at Leyla with a more pleasant countenance.Leyla blinked her eyes in surprise and smiled back at Mrs Etman, though she felt strange slits of fury flickered on her beautiful face.\u2018Bitch, you must have seduced my son with that face and smile.\u2019Mrs. Etman quickly snatched a glass of water from the table. She could feel the slightest drip of ice-cold water drained down her esophagus.\u201cThank you very much, Ma\u2019am.\u201d Dimples appeared on Leyla\u2019s cheeks as she said, expressing her heartfelt gratitude.\u2018Leyla was a good girl, a really nice girl. \u2018Mrs. Etman acknowledged that fact. And it was for that reason, above all others, why she never wanted Leyla to become her daughter-in-law.It\u2019s probably a lot better if she was a troublesome child. That way, she could loathe her for the proper reason instead of hating her because she was poor.. At the very least, she wouldn\u2019t be ashamed of herself for being such an terrible mother.But now,She hated everything about Leyla Lewellin.She detested all of her: her kindness, her brilliance, and her impoverishment.\u201cLeyla, do you know? Dr. Lorentz, a professor at Ratz University is an avian biologist?\u201dDr. Etman abruptly changed the topic after witnessing his wife\u2019s unpleasant expression.\u201cOnce you enter, be sure to take Dr. Lorentz\u2019s classes. It would be very beneficial to you if you can get direct lessons from an expert such as him.\u201d\u201cDear, you\u2019re talking as if Leyla has already entered college.\u201dMrs. Etman, who had been quietly watching Leyla for some time, sprang into reaction with an unexpected retort. Dr. Etman and Kyle both had their eyes on her. Their expressions were befuddled.\u201cThere\u2019s no way she\u2019ll fail, dear.\u201d\u201cRight, Mother, there\u2019s no way Leyla will fail.\u201dThey were ready to debate her with identical facial expressions and tone of speech. Both of her husband and son were like two peas in the pod whenever they paid attention to Leyla.Mrs. Etman was compelled to swallow back the words that had been pushed to her throat. \u201c\u2026..That\u2019s true\u2026\u2026 Leyla is such a smart girl.\u201d She curved the corners of her lips upwards with slight coercion.Sitting across from her, Leyla was a little embarrassed and slightly blushed at her praise.Whenever Leyla\u2019s past story at Lovita came up, Bill Remmer always kept his lips shut. Everyone at Arvis manor knew about Leyla: she had lost her parents overnight and had travelled to Berg after moving from one relative\u2019s household to another.And Linda Etman detested this truth of Leyla Lewellin beyond all else. A child with no proper relatives to care for and nurture her. A child who had travelled across the border, and was repeatedly kicked out. She was on the verge of getting chills whenever thinking about how lousy her foundation for starting a family would be.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t she be getting something too big?\u2019Even if Leyla came from a ordinary well-off family, she would still hinder that girl from being together with her son. Linda Etman believed: a girl who grew up without a good background won\u2019t become an excellent spouse. Moreover, seeing a \u2018skint\u2019 girl like her who was so eager to study at College, was very irksome to see.Despite her lesser means, watching how Leyla had lofty ambitions that were out of her league, and considering her poor circumstances led Linda Etman to label her as a greedy person. She thought for sure: Kyle would never be able to live happily if such a child would become his wife.\u2018That\u2019s why I have to stop it.\u2019Mrs. Etman tightened her grip under the table.She had to stop this marriage by all means possible.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla Lewellin\u2019s acceptance note to university arrived in the mail from the very same postman who had delivered little Leyla to Arvis in the past.Bill Remmer, who received the letter while Leyla was out and in the forest, stood still for a long while.\u201cMr. Remmer?\u201dThe Mailman glanced at him with a worried face after Bill didn\u2019t give a response after he said his congratulations. His expression that was carefree a moment ago, suddenly became a blazing bright crimson.\u201cAre you okay, Mr. Remmer?\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, there\u2019s nothing to fuss about.\u201d Bill rubbed his eyes with his rough hand. \u201cI was just thinking for a moment.\u201dHe raised his voice as he spoke. His eyes glistened. The postman, who had known the gardener of Arvis was \u2018The bruiser with a soft center\u2019, nodded quietly, pretending not to notice a tear which was forming on the corner of his eyes.\u201cAnyway, congratulations. I\u2019m thrilled to know that Leyla is going to be a student at the best university in the Empire.\u201dAfter congratulating Bill for a second time, the postman departed from the cottage.Bill glided back to the terrace holding the acceptance letter and sat on his chair. He reread the letter many times and softly stroked the letter typing with his fingers. After taking a deep breath, his face gradually returned to normal, which was getting redder with compassion. That was when Leyla came back.\u201cUncle!\u201dLeyla waved her arms up in the air while running as she saw Bill sitting on the terrace. Her old leather bag that was draped over her shoulder swung slightly.\u201cThat damned bag.\u201dBill chortled as he hissed faintly. It was his tool bag that he had given to her when she first arrived at the cottage over the summer. Leyla had a few nicer bags than that one, but still, she relied on that old, battered bag every time she went for a stroll in the forest.\u201cWhen are you going to throw away that trash bag?\u201dBill began to ask Leyla, who was sitting next to him.\u201cThrow it?\u201d She yapped. \u201cWhy?! It\u2019s still usable.\u201d\u201cNow, please throw that bag into the trash! That grody thing could bring you bad luck!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll use it a little more.\u201d Leila giggled softly as her finger fiddled with the tattered leather bag strap. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little empty without it.\u201d\u2018Well, I know it sounds like a fool\u2019s talk.\u2019She murmured. Without saying a word, Bill quietly held out the letter in front of her eyes.\u201cUncle, what\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you read it.\u201dLeyla blinked at the letter with her eye-popping. Bill thought that she would burst out into cheers of joy, but Leyla\u2019s face just grew more composed as she continued reading the letter of acceptance.\u201c\u2026Leyla?\u201dBill spoke first, and he did so with some trepidation after he saw her overly muted reaction. Only then did Leyla lift her head and turned to face him. A faint smile appeared on her lips.\u2018It would be nice if you were jolly like a little girl in a moment like this.\u2019Bill scratched the back of his neck at her silent slant, which was mature enough to make him feel ill at ease. Leyla momentarily smirked at him, who was standing still for a brief moment.Suddenly, she hugged him tightly.\u201cHey, it\u2019s stuffy!\u201dAt odds with his prickly words, Bill tepidly patted her back.Later on, Leyla raised her head, \u201cThank you.\u201d She whispered in a hushed tone. \u201cThank you so much, Uncle.\u201dWith every glance he gave her, Leyla\u2019s eyes welled up with tears and her lips melted into a wide grin.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying nonsense.\u201dBill gulped for air and started counting in his head. He reflected on the chores he needed to do one by one before the sunset, but the heat in her eyes showed no signs of abating.Now Bill was sure: \u2018This little child must have brought her tear bag from Lovita.\u2019\u201cYou were the one who studied hard and earned a passing grade on the exam. What did I do, huh?\u201d\u201cNo. No, Uncle.\u201d Leyla shook her head and reached out to take Bill\u2019s hand in hers. Her tiny hands had a tough time holding his hand.\u201cI\u2026\u201dShe stuttered. The hand she was grasping had flowed a warm feeling that was akin to the tepidness she had after sipping a shot of vodka.\u201cUncle, if it weren\u2019t for you, I\u2019d have been\u2026.\u201dOn this happy day, Leyla looked like she\u2019s about to cry. Bill didn\u2019t like it, and he dreaded the sight of her sobbing face the most. He didn\u2019t want to witness Leyla\u2019s tears, even if they were tears of happiness.His fondness for this child was far greater beyond all the love and care he had devoted to the flowers and trees that he had planted throughout his life. Bill was perplexed knowing he cherished this child more than his precious flowers and trees.It just happened naturally before he knew it and he was more than happy to accept that fact.\u201cShall we go to the Capital together next weekend?\u201d asked Bill in a cheerful tone after coughing a little bit to calm his emotions.\u201cBoth of us?\u201d Leyla\u2019s pupils dilated. \u201cGoing to the Ratz?\u201d it left her bewildered.\u201cI have to pay your tuition fee since you\u2019ve been accepted into college. Besides, I haven\u2019t brought you to any place yet, so let\u2019s go sightseeing around the capital city.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Leyla\u2019s tear-stained face glowed with zest. \u201cUncle, are you serious? We\u2019re going on a vacation together?\u201d\u201cWhat vacation?\u201d He jested. \u201cI\u2019m just going to pay your tuition.\u201d\u201cAh, whatever it is. All that matters is we\u2019re going together.\u201dA tinge of regret lingered in his eyes when he looked at Leyla, who was such a happy camper at the moment.He wanted to take her for a walk to a nearby place, show her something interesting, and buy something delicious to eat.But why?Bill questioned himself, lamenting. Why did all of these thoughts occur to him only now? As the day when he would have to let her go from, his arms drew nearer?\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money, even though the two of you are getting married, I\u2019m still worried about letting you go alone with Kyle carrying that much money, so I can\u2019t help it, but\u2026..\u201dThe babbling Bill eventually hooted with laughter. Leyla flung herself once again onto his hug.\u201cLook, Leyla.\u201d Bill gave her a lovely smile. \u201c Am I right?\u201d He gently combed her hair with his fingers. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019ll be a good adult?\u201dIn the end, he couldn\u2019t put it into words, and Bill was at a loss for what to say as well, so he just stroked Leyla\u2019s head again over and over again.Bill Remmer needed to count more than ever than before to keep his ugly crying face on hold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since it had been widely expected, nobody was surprised to hear that Dr. Etman\u2019s lone son had been accepted into a prestigious medical school with outstanding grades.It was Leyla who topped the talk. In these past few days, she had become the talk of the town wherever people gathered. Even the Duke\u2019s greenhouse listened regarding this kind of talk.\u201cI just can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Norma gasped. \u201cBill Remmer made a great choice by sending an orphan, and moreover, a girl, to a College.\u201dNorma Catharina von Herhardt, who wouldn\u2019t usually say anything on the street about low-income youngsters, tuned in on today\u2019s chatter about Leyla with great interest, just like others.\u201cI supposed she was born under a lucky star.\u201d Elysee von Herhardt added a pinch of salt to the table talk. \u201cShe met her daddy-long-legs and was even now engaged to Dr. Etman\u2019s son.\u201dClaudine was quietly sipping her tea next to the Duchess, nodding graciously in accordance, then a radiant smirk appeared on her face, \u201cI\u2019m so glad that a poor kid like her has such good luck.\u201dShe praised Leyla more sincerely than she had previously done. As luck would have it, the maid who had gone to pick up the kid on Norma\u2019s orders returned to the greenhouse just in time. She was with Leyla who was neatly dressed.\u201cCome here and sit down.\u201dDuchess Norma calmly instructed her to take a seat. Elysee and Claudine both stared at her, their brows slanted, so as Leyla\u2019s.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with serving this special child a cup of tea, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Norma flashed a smile as she said.Like many of Herhardt\u2019s, Catharina von Herhardt was noble to the bone to say that the blood coursing through her veins must have had a deep blue tint on it. Hence, everyone was astonished with wonder by her willingness to share a tea table with the orphaned child raised by her gardener.Ushered by the maid, Leyla sat on her chair, her cheeks flushed with nervousness.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that getting into Imperial University is very hard, even for the sons of the most illustrious families.\u201dDuchess Norma opened the conversation first after the maid placed the cup of tea in front of Leyla.\u201cIt was all thanks to Uncle Bill,\u201d Leyla responded, as she politely lowered her gaze.\u201cYes. You must not forget the kindness of your benefactor, Bill Remmer.\u201d\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cAre you from Lovita?\u201d\u201cMy mother was from Lovita, but my father was a Berg.\u201d\u201cSame as me.\u201dElysee and Claudine both dilated their eyes simultaneously in response to Norma\u2019s peculiar words that sounded like a veiled innuendo.People knew Duchess Norma von Herhardt was a Marquise of repute and the sole cousin of Emperor Berg. Her mother was a progeniture of Lovita\u2019s aristocratic line; no one would dare to draw a parallel line between her to an orphan who was raised from a humble background.\u201cTell me what you want.\u201dThe abrupt request from the elderly Duchess, who just laid her teacup down, caught Leyla jerking her head up, startled.\u201cBill Remmer is my favourite employee.\u201d She stated it quietly, \u201cAnd you\u2019re a child he raised like his own daughter, so I should give you a congratulatory gift.\u201dEmbarrassment immediately rose up to Leyla\u2019s cheeks. Just in time, she stared at the Duchess; instead of concealing her eyes, the greenhouse received the arrival of another visitor. Claudine spotted him as he neared them and blurted out,\u201cDuke Herhardt!\u201dClaudine\u2019s cheery voice got everyone\u2019s attention, and their eyes fled to a distinguished man.Leyla swiftly turned her head and saw Matthias von Herhardt standing haughtily near the table. Their eyes met, faces frowned on one another for a host of reasons. The tension persisted between them until Leyla averted her gaze from him.\u201cThis child had been successfully accepted into Ratz University. So we took her out for tea together because it was something to celebrate,\u201d Elysee explained in a voice laced with hilarity.After a brief nod, Matthias sat down on a chair beside Claudine, which happened to be the seat facing Leyla.\u201cYou\u2019re back early today.\u201d Claudine gave a warm welcome to her fianc\u00e9.Matthias always departed the mansion right after the clock hit the dawn of the day and would always return late at night after he had taken charge of the family\u2019s business for good. It had already been a week since Claudine stayed at Arvis, but this was the first time she had seen Matthias come home before gloam.\u201cThe meeting came to a close earlier than planned, My Lady.\u201d\u201cWhat a relief. I was worried you might be overdoing it these days.\u201d\u201cClaudine\u2019s right, Matthias,\u201d Elysee added. \u201cTake your time and avoid rushing. If you end up ruining your health, it would be a real concern.\u201dFollowing that, the conversation drifted to Matthias\u2019s current situation, with the family-run business and Leyla Lewellin\u2019s presence seemed to have been wiped out in a blink of an eye.But thanks to it, Leyla had a moment to catch her breath and take a sip of her already cooled tea. She wished she could escape this unpleasant situation, but she knew it would be rude to do so in front of the two Duchesses who were keeping a keen eye on her every move.Leyla put her teacup down onto the saucer, cautious not to create any noise within her gestures.When she elevated her sight, she flinched slightly, and her back banged against the chair.Matthias sat quietly between his chattering fianc\u00e9e and his mother; his callous eyes fixed on her in the same gaze he had on the day he ruthlessly trampled her heart and abandoned her behind.Leyla, who was trying to grab the teacup again, hurriedly slid her hands beneath the table. Matthias was seen speaking to Claudine for a while before turning his attention to his Mother and then back to her.She lowered her head, daring not to look at him in the eyes, but Leyla could still feel his menacing glare piercing through her body.That gaze served as a constant reminder of her last summer\u2019s memories. In the face of Claudine, those memories grew even more humiliating, and Leyla had enough of it. Although the Duke committed wrongdoings, it was always her who felt guilty.\u201cSo, have you thought about what you want?\u201dNorma\u2019s questions brought the table\u2019s spotlight back to Leyla Lewellin.Leyla clenched her jaw hearing Norma and bit her lip involuntarily as she witnessed Matthias\u2019 blue eyes remain glued on her. She immediately switched her look to Norma, attempting to conceal her reddened face.\u201cYou\u2019ve already given me a wonderful gift, Ma\u2019am. That was more than enough.\u201d\u201cYou already got it?\u201d\u201cYes. Just allowing me to stay here in Arvis, in Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage, is already a gift I cannot repay. It was the biggest and most precious gift I\u2019ve ever received and I\u2019ll be forever grateful for it my whole life.\u201d\u201cWe just granted Bill Remmer\u2019s request.\u201d\u201cThat permission was a gift that changed my life,\u201d said Leyla, her lips curved in a faint smile. \u201cI am also very grateful to you, Ma\u2019am,\u201d she also didn\u2019t forget to express her polite gratitude towards Elysee.\u201d\u2026. Also to the Duke and Lady Claudine.\u201dSomehow, Leyla was more than delighted to express her gratitude to everyone, including those she disliked, rather than asking for permission to leave the place.\u201cI won\u2019t forget the kindness you have given me, even when the time comes for me to leave Arvis.\u201d With a deep bow, she took Norma\u2019s question into appreciation.Duchess Norma scrutinized her thoroughly before giving a slight nod. It would be impolite to turn down Herhardt\u2019s favour; nevertheless, Leyla\u2019s courteous attitude seemed to astound her, which she found to be quite commendable for a plebeian young girl.\u201cHave you already said goodbye?\u201dClaudine asked sadly.\u201cYou must be sad, Leyla.\u201d She kept a silent gaze on her and offered something to her, \u201cI understand how you feel, but I still want to give you a present. Oh, how about if I pay for your college tuition?\u201d\u201cNo, Miss. The kindness you have shown me has already made me feel very grateful.\u201dLeyla looked at Claudine; a smile tightened on her face.\u201cUncle Bill has already saved the tuition money aside. He wants to cover the cost of my first semester of college.\u201d\u201cReally? I\u2019ll have to think of something else to give as a present then,\u201d she declared, \u201cI can\u2019t let my old friend leave empty-handed who had been accepted into College and is about to marry. . Isn\u2019t that right, Duke Herhardt?\u201d Claudine said. Her lips curving into a brilliant grin, and her voice calling his name sounded as sweet as a honey.Matthias took a moment glancing at Leyla before he gently gestured his head in agreement with his fianc\u00e9e.Leyla was eventually allowed to leave that unsettling tea table after many more formal talks and niceties.She was standing with her back to the Herhardt family at the time when her eyes were drawn to the scenic view of the greenhouse.Eden of Arvis.That\u2019s what everyone called it.The opulent greenhouse, where people say lavished grandiose praises on one another, left her feeling uneasy and out of breath.The stifling feeling that engulfed her was analogous to the one she had when she saw lovely crippled winged bird or mixed flowers of colours, its scents stinging her nose. From the gurgling water that was flowing from the marble fountain to the sunshine that was cast in through the surrounding glass windows, the whole nine yards echoed that sentiment precisely.Leyla strode out of the greenhouse without giving a second glance behind. Only when she clapped her eyes on the glimmer of light outside and smelt the wind blowing over her body did she expel her sigh.Long shadows trailed her footsteps beneath the twilight gloom as she walked into the heart of the forest.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cSister, do you know what you are talking about?\u201dDaniel Rayner was stunned and therefore asked in disbelief. The crepuscular light cascading in through the uncurtained window blinded him and his cousin, Linda Etman, who sat calmly opposite from him.\u201cSister!\u201d\u201cTone down your voice, Daniel!\u201dMrs. Etman sternly chastised him as she cast a quick peek through the closed door. Daniel heaved in shock.Daniel Rayner, who had just regained his business\u2019s impetus after the failure of his overseas mining venture, had frequently sought help from Linda Etman, his cousin\u2019s-sister and his wealthiest relative. She, who had consistently rebuffed his appeals graciously but heartlessly, this time came to visit him first.It went without saying that the promised help won\u2019t be returned back. However, Daniel\u2019s excitement for taking her helping hand soon turned to hesitation upon hearing Mrs. Etman\u2019s improper words.\u201cIt\u2019s stealing, Sister. How\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Mrs. Etman abruptly cut-off his words and narrowed her eyes onto crinkled slits. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of hiding it for a while and returning it.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you care about Kyle too?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d\u201cAnd you, too, need my help,\u201d Mrs. Etman said as she lifted her hand from her lap and caressed her heated temple. As foreseen, Daniel Rayner was unable to counter and could only bend his head in shame.\u201cI\u2019m going to keep the money for a while and return it at the right time\u201d, she reasoned. \u201cIf you can do that simple task, you will be able to safeguard your family, and I will be able to protect my son.\u201dMrs. Etman straightened her sitting posture and looked at Daniel Rayner with a satisfied expression on her face.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a bad deal. What do you think?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leyla, who was walking with her gaze down staring at the ground, promptly lifted her head in eyes widened.Kyle couldn\u2019t keep the grin off his face from adoring that moment. The moment Leyla quickened her stride whenever she got a hold of his presence was always very adorable.Leyla flashed a beaming smile as she neared closer to him.\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201d\u201cI went to your cottage a while ago and they told me that you had been summoned to the Duke\u2019s manor, so I was on my way to save you.\u201d\u201cSave me?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious why Lady Brandt called you?\u201d\u201cNot today,\u201d said Leyla as she took a step forward. Kyle trailed behind, his stride was perfectly timed with her.\u201cIt was Grand Duchess Norma, not Lady Brandt.\u201d\u201cGrand Duchess? She did?\u201d\u201cYeah, she congratulated me on passing the exam and asked if there was anything I wanted as a gift.\u201d\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d\u201cI said nothing. I just conveyed my gratitude for letting me stay here.\u201d\u201cWow, it was so Leyla Lewellin-Esque answer.\u201dKyle just smirked at what he had guessed. He gently scooped her hand, and Leyla seemed to be less nervous compared to the past. This small change brought his level of happiness climbed by one or two notches.They strolled along the familiar road, hand in hand, as they shared stories. It began by their everyday routines, mystery novels published in today\u2019s newspapers, and their meagre summer plans for this year. As always, the intimate atmosphere snippet mingled with their rhythmic footfall, who was walking alongside one another.Before long, the afternoon sky was broken, and jolted the twilight from its light slumber.When the nightfall dawned, the sea of trees was soon blanketed in its beauty. Kyle yanked Leyla\u2019s hand and dragged her into the darkness with him.He leaned her body against the tall tree on the side of the road as she reeled, then stepped in front of her. Everything happened in the blink of an eye, yet Kyle felt as if time had halted still for eternity throughout that moment.Leyla glanced at him, bewildered.\u201cKyle?\u201dHer voice was trembling a tad as she spoke. Her bonnie pink delicate lips glowed attractively even in the pitch blackness of the nite.Kyle summoned all his courage and bent his head towards her; his eyes slammed shut. The warm skin soon reached his lips, but he wasn\u2019t pleased with the touch he was getting.Kyle opened his eyes and laughed out loud. He found out that his lips had kissed Leyla\u2019s hand rather than what he planned.\u201cI felt weird doing this, Kyle.\u201d Leyla was gazing at him with her blushing face while her other hand was firmly covering her lips.As Kyle slowly raised his head, once again she spoke,\u201cIt seems like we\u2019re doing something bad if we do this, and I\u2026.\u201dLeyla dropped her gaze quietly, unable to bring herself to finish her words. Her pale, long eyelashes were likewise heading down.\u2018Don\u2019t you think this is wrong?\u2019When Leyla struggled to swallow the words she so wished to talk, Kyle flashed a grin. The hue of his cheeks now had matched hers in colour.\u201cHey, Miss Lewellin. An innocent person who doesn\u2019t know how to kiss like you knows what?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThough you were chattering really loudly in the train back then as if you were an expert.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026Oh, gosh!\u201d Leyla hunched over to look shorter after recalling the day Kyle wanted to leap off a speeding train after she gave him a lecture about the act of reproduction.\u201cT-that\u2019s\u2026.\u201d Leyla\u2019s eyes rolled skyward, and she gulped, finding she lacked the right words to debate him. \u201cI-I\u2019m also not sure about that\u2026..\u201d she softly whispered.Her habit of muttering low when she was in a position of disadvantage had remained unaltered since their childhood, to which Kyle let out a faint sigh.His heartbeat went loose; it was pathetic that he couldn\u2019t kiss the woman he would marry, but Kyle didn\u2019t abhor it either. His deepest wish was to win Leyla\u2019s heart, so he refused to shatter her heart merely because of his fleeting lust.Softly, Kyle fondled her cheeks, wrapping his hands around them. And then, he kissed her. His heated lips found their way to her forehead. He tried his best not to be greedy anymore, and with that, Kyle had kept his promise.As he drew in a steadying breath, the pleasing scent littered his lungs.The sweet scent of roses.It was the scent of Leyla.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias gingerly walked towards the window on the west side of his bedroom after taking a shower.His routine went on wontedly. Though he slept off after midnight, he would usually be awake pretty early in the morning. He made his way to the bathroom without losing a beat and took a quick shower before getting ready for the day ahead. It had already evolved into a sort of habit, which he could do effortlessly since it had been ingrained into his bones.Perhaps, even right now.Matthias looked over the open window. In his garden surrounded by blossoming rose fields, Leyla was there, hard at work.Perhaps as the day of her departure drew nearer, she had been seen following the gardener much more often recently. The two of them didn\u2019t separate for a single second and kept conversing without the slightest pause.He once described Leyla Lewellin as a \u2018very reticent child\u2019 who seldom opened her padlocked lips in front of Claudine.\u201cMaster, this is Hessen.\u201dHe heard the familiar sound of a door-knocking at the scheduled hour.\u201cCome on in.\u201dStanding with his back against the windows, Matthias gave a succinct response. The chiffon drapes were rattling in the wind that wafted through the open stile.While reading the newspaper Hessen had brought, Matthias overheard the reports about his to-do list for the day. He seemed to be having a laid-back schedule before the luncheon.\u201cIt seems that Arvis was completely filled upon the return of its Master,\u201d Hessen added a word rather than retreating silently as he usually did.Matthias turned to face him, setting down his teacup on the table. \u201cMy grandmother and mother would probably be sad if they heard that.\u201d\u201cPardon? Oh no, master. I didn\u2019t mean that \u2026.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d A smile crept across Matthias\u2019s lips. \u201cI know what you meant.\u201dHis momentary grin soon melted away, but his eyes stayed riveted on the middle-aged butler calmly; it was placid like a windless night. Hessen hurried off the room, after noticing the look of displeasure in his master\u2019s eyes.Even after the bedroom door was closed, Matthias continued reading the newspaper while leaning on the windowsill. His bluish eyes, exposed through the loose strands of his hair, sparkled even brighter when the sunlight hit them.After thoroughly reading the article about Count Klein\u2019s business-someone he would have luncheon with, Matthias put down the newspaper.He slowly turned his head and saw Leyla walking into the flowerbed near the manor. Her braided hair beneath the straw hat was swinging as she hopped around.The gardener appeared to be shouting something at her, and Leyla answered excitedly. She burst out laughing. Even with the hat shade obscuring her face, Matthias nonetheless could tell she was laughing with a bubbly voice.Matthias\u2019 brows furrowed in a scowl. He ruffled his hair and slowly swept it back.\u2018Should I not come back?\u2019The thought was running rampant in his head from the second he set foot on the manor ground.His entire life had been meticulously orchestrated. It was analogous to the stairwell leading to a perfect life and he needed just to tread on it.But, the stairwell was twisted, which muddled his steps.And Matthias still couldn\u2019t understand why he had taken a choice that broke his life\u2019s cycle.\u2018No.\u2018He may have already broken it long before the night when he tore up the letter extending his military service.It all began from the day he decided to serve an additional year in the military and postponed his wedding\u2014 the day when petty desires blindsided him.The day when he approached her, after she fell from her bicycle.Or maybe from the day, he didn\u2019t even remember.He still desired her\u2026Matthias was keenly aware of the amplitude of his feelings.As such, he desired that she would disappear. And he believed that his desire was something right.His state of shambles was sparked by the inner conflict between his raging emotions and guileless desires. Matthias was unable to provide a definitive answer, but he trusted the passage of time would eventually remedy the matter.The window was slammed shut, and Matthias changed his outfit into a different one. The trellis shade slid over his face as he strode along the hallway.Luring by his discernment, Matthias left the manor alone and followed the forest trail leading to the river. On the underside of the dazzling moonlight, the dancing shadows loomed sombrer.Matthias stalled for quite a while beneath the thick shadow cast by the surrounding trees to get sucked up onto reverie.His world had no concept of longing since he had never had a desire of his own. There was a raw feeling that he had discovered when he was unable to get what he desired and it was a pretty odd frisson that had seized possession of his body.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Daniel Rayner\u2019s countenance grew paler as a ghost as he got closer to the gardener\u2019s cottage. The sun wasn\u2019t yet scorching, but the sweat was already dampening his forehead.\u201cThis is nuts.\u201dDaniel mumbled frantic words as the cottage\u2019s roof had shown itself from the distance. Mrs. Etman told him that she wanted to temporarily withhold the tuition money the gardener had prepared,\u2014which amounted to nothing more than a stealing act if her discourse was condensed.\u2018The noble and graceful Linda Etman beguiled her cousin into committing a sin in the hope of severing the poor girl\u2019s relationship with her son.\u2019Daniel Rayner heaved a sigh and entered the cottage\u2019s front yard. He took out the handkerchief from his pocket and again wiped his face. His grip on the briefcase stretched tightly.He also felt sorry for Kyle, who had fallen in love with and chosen to marry a girl who wasn\u2019t a suitable fit for him. Despite their low social standing, everyone expected that the Etman family would have a daughter-in-law who was nonetheless a silk-stocking.However, it was something Kyle sincerely wanted, and Dr. Etman supported it. He believed that Leyla Lewellin deserved to be their son\u2019s companion. Mrs. Etman, too, acquiesced in her husband\u2019s decision. But, who knows?\u00a0A hidden dagger may be lurking behind her benign smile.\u201cMoney is your foe.\u201dAfter a moment of despondence, and making up his mind, Daniel gallantly strode towards the cottage. Linda Etman said that the cottage would be vacant in the morning. So if Leyla happened to be there, Daniel only needed to reason that he had just returned from Etman\u2019s home and dropped by to congratulate her on getting into college. It wasn\u2019t a suspicious excuse, given that they had met and known each other before.With cautious, Daniel knocked on the front door. Guilt seeped into his veins as he prayed Leyla was inside, and this scheme would fail. Yet, the thing that greeted him inside the house was all quietness.Daniel then pulled on the doorknob, and feelings of despair and hopelessness started to blend into one. As his sister had assured him, the door was unlocked.\u2018But, sis, didn\u2019t you mention that even if the money was stolen, someone would undoubtedly help her in paying her tuition? Even Dr. Etman was willing to pay for her tuition fees.\u2019Linda Etman stiffened her cheeks with a bitter smile when Daniel questioned her in bewilderment.\u2018I know my husband better than you.\u2019\u2018But why\u2026.\u2019\u2018The missing tuition was just an excuse.\u2019\u2018Huh?\u2019\u2018An excuse to break her heart.\u2019\u2018\u2026.\u2019A sigh punctuated his silent reply.Daniel refused to comment and could only blink slowly. He had no interest to become involved in their household matters and this shameful deed just made him feel more guilty and disappointed in himself. But he kept grasping at straws, although it made him feel like a despicable person.He was only helping his cousin sister to keep the gardener\u2019s money for the time being; Daniel recited that rationalization thought a thousand times in his head before summoning the courage to enter the house.He completed the job quickly. Daniel breathed a sigh of relief after successfully leaving the cottage with a bag of money. He had rolled the dice and succeeded in his role on the game board. He just has to hand over the scruffy cash to Linda Etman and then go home, content in the knowledge that his laborious efforts to protect his family would be repaid in full in the near future.Daniel opted for a loop along the riverside to avoid a situation where he might encounter the gardener. Worse luck, his prudent choice landed him in a pickle when he met paths with a young man near the river.Seeing Daniel Rayner, the young man stopped his sluggish steps. Without even a speck of suspicion or surprise in his face, the young man stood still and regarded him stoically.\u2018Is he one of Arvis\u2019s employees?\u2019It was not long after his momentarily nonchalant attitude soothed him; Daniel\u2019s complexion soon grew like a death warmed up.Wearing a comfy shirt, that young man didn\u2019t look like a servant as he strolled down the riverside at the busy time to start the day. Moreover, his princely face had all the hallmarks of the familiar figure he recognized.The very face that was featured countless times in newspapers and which he could only see on many occasions from a distance.The young owner of a heaven-like place called Arvis.It was Duke Herhardt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This time, with a radically different narrative.Now, the outline was;\u00a0\u2018The gardener\u2019s cottage had been burgled.\u2019The news traveled fast around the Manor like a wildfire. The incident was met with people\u2019s doubts. Few believed a thief had the nerve to steal from Duke Herhardt\u2019s estate. Only until they saw a half-dazed Bill Remmer looking for the culprit did they believe the robbery really happened.Matthias departed the Mansion at the peak of the clamor. The scheduled time had come, and he must leave now to avoid being late for lunch.He wasn\u2019t the kind to chime in on gossipy talks, sensing something different upon passing the Arvis\u2019s driveway flanked by Platanus trees.From the opposite side of the road, police officers on horseback were making their way toward the scene. Matthias didn\u2019t even have to make logical assumptions of where they were going since the route would lead them to the Arvis forest.\u201cThey said a thief broke into the gardener\u2019s house.\u201dThe quick-witted aide answered first before Matthias could open his mouth to ask.\u201cAt Bill Remmer\u2019s house?\u201d\u201cYes, he was in a big pickle since the funds he\u2019d set aside for his daughter\u2019s College tuition were stolen.\u201dThief.Tuition.Leyla.Matthias tilted his head to one side, elatedly repeating those three syllables.Just as his vehicle exited the Platanus\u2019 shade, he recalled his unpleasant encounter with a strange man on the Schulter River this morning.The guy introduced himself as Daniel Rayner, Mrs. Etman\u2019s cousin. He was in the neighborhood paying a visit to Etman\u2019s house and stopped by the Estate to congratulate Leyla.His following few speeches were full of baloney; the investment firm he ran, the mining rights of overseas mines, the stock market, and other business-related matters. But most of them had been spilled and were now just a blot on Matthias\u2019 mind.Matthias did, nevertheless, remembered a few details about the event. His wristwatch read nine o\u2019clock in the morning when he met a middle-aged man drenched in sweat by the riverside.It seemed strange for a well-heeled middle-class businessman to bother coming just to congratulate his cousin\u2019s future daughter-in-law at such an early hour.Matthias, however, didn\u2019t mind it since it was irrelevant to him. He treated the thought as a passing interest until he overheard a ludicrous report of a burglar sneaking into the gardener\u2019s cottage.But why?As a civilized business person, sneaking into Arvis to steal the gardener\u2019s money seemed so wrong no matter how dire his financial circumstance was. If he were him, Matthias would instead steal from the house of his wealthy cousin sister.\u201cLinda Etman.\u201dHe was ready to quit on thinking such a nonsensical idea when he muttered that name without knowing.After he inserted Linda Etman\u2019s name between that guy and Leyla, Matthias was able to draw a very plausible relationship line between the three of them.He was just guessing. Yet, it was fascinating, how perfectly fit the jigsaw pieces were in place together.The car finally reached their stop in front of the Hotel, where his appointment for the luncheon will take place. Before stepping out, Matthias issued a short order to his assistant.\u201cEvers\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d\u201cFind out about Daniel Rayner. ASAP.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The food on the dinner table was left nearly untouched, but it was hard to get up from the table where Bill and Kyle used to dine together.Leyla, who was well aware of the cause, quietly cleaned the table.Leaving his half-eaten plate, Bill Remmer went straight to the porch and lit up a cigarette. Since the thief broke in, the mood in their cottage had lost its thrill.\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Leyla.\u201dKyle spoke cautiously as he helped her. Leyla\u2019s hardworking hands screeched to a pause, and she lifted her emerald eyes to meet his.\u201cThat thief, I\u2019m sure we can catch him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if we are unable to arrest him, don\u2019t fret about the tuition. My father said that he will also pay yours.\u201d\u201cKyle.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try to say no. My father wanted to pay for it from the very beginning. But Uncle Bill was so stubborn that my father caved.\u201d Kyle firmly argued, \u201cTo get married means being family, Leyla. It\u2019s not about being in debt, it\u2019s about helping each other\u2026 Isn\u2019t that how families should be?\u201dLeyla lowered her gaze, stood still and finally nodded her head slowly. Her face had grown so gaunt in a matter of days, fueling Kyle with hatred for the robber who had despoiled the woodland\u2019s peacefulness.\u201cAnyway, just in case, let\u2019s just think about how to catch the thief first.\u201dKyle expressed his optimism by saying, even though he knew that the odds of catching the thief were very slim. Leyla gave a sliver smile.\u201c\u2026Thanks, Kyle.\u201d\u201cThank you? What did I do?\u201d\u201cFor everything\u2026\u201dOnce again, a grin crept on her lips, yet her smiling face caused Kyle\u2019s heart to feel heavy.Kyle clearly remembered the tinge of happiness plastered on Leyla\u2019s face at the idea of coming to the Capital with Uncle Bill. Though Uncle Bill downplayed his trip by claiming it was to pay for her tuition, in truth, it was their very first Family Vacation.Uncle Bill couldn\u2019t express his elation well, owing to his blunt personality, but undoubtedly, he was thrilled to go on a trip with Leyla, to the point that he teased her, and claimed that she would make an excellent guide for him since this would be her second visit to Ratz.Places to visit, foods to try, and activities to do together were all must to do. Kyle almost got jealous at Uncle Bill witnessing how endearing was Leyla when she was talking with passion bad giddily with him.But, the thief ruined everything.Even if they could get the money back, Leyla and Uncle Bill couldn\u2019t go on a trip with such pleasure, and Kyle couldn\u2019t do anything about it.Kyle shook off his boundless helplessness as he caught his breath and approached Bill who was sitting suddenly on the porch.He cast a look at Kyle, who was seated next to him before he resumed heaving the cigar. Depression had been consuming him for the recent days. Inside him, a boiling hatred against the thief was brewing, to the point he devised hundreds of different methods to kill people.After some silence, he spoke.\u201cIt was all my fault.\u201dHis voice was choking.\u201cI left a lot of money at home, but didn\u2019t properly lock the door.\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t at fault. Who would have thought someone would dare to steal in the Arvis Estate?\u201d\u201cThe payment deadline is next week, and I\u2019m not sure if the thief will be caught before then.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. If there\u2019s no progress in catching the thief before then, my father said that he would pay Leyla\u2019s tuition as well. I\u2019ve told Leyla about this.\u201dKyle\u2019s beaming face drove Bill Remmer\u2019s eyes to sink beyond a deep well.\u201cI will call the Police tomorrow. I will ask our Officer acquaintance to properly investigate this case.\u201d\u201cThank you Kyle, I owe it all to your family.\u201d\u201cI feel bad to hear that, I haven\u2019t even paid half the price of the food I ate all this time.\u201dAt his witty, Bill could smile a bit, albeit, it was a weak smile.\u201cPlease convey my gratitude to your parents. Ah no, please tell them I will pay them a visit once this matter is settled?\u201d He squeezed Kyle\u2019s shoulder as he said so.Kyle nodded, dissuading him from saying,\u00a0\u2018You shouldn\u2019t.\u2019\u00a0He couldn\u2019t pinpoint why, but he had that unexplained feeling about Bill Remmer.Kyle also didn\u2019t want to offend him in any way.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The Duke\u2019s manor had two study rooms.The study on the second floor was a spacious, book-filled space that rivaled the scale of a public library. The second one, that was located at the end of the third floor next to the master bedroom, was less in size.The library, that was loaded chiefly with history, politics, and economics books, had been used by Duke of Herhardt for generations as a place for receiving guests and conducting business meetings.Similarly, Duke Matthias von Herhardt did.Mark Evers, the Duke\u2019s aide, rushed off his feet to the third-floor office. He seemed in demand.He had been Matthias\u2019s Assistant since he was fully fledged. But never once did the Duke give him orders in such haste like now.All along, Matthias always presented him the image of an easy-going Master with an innately laid-back attitude. But soon, he realized. Perhaps, that was because nothing existed under the skies of the Berg Empire that could make Duke Herhardt champ at the bit.*\u00a0(To\u00a0be\u00a0very\u00a0eager\u00a0or\u00a0impatient\u00a0to\u00a0do\u00a0something)Matthias von Herhardt was a man of influence.He had it all.And everything he did went as slick as a whistle.Mark Evers deemed that his Master\u2019s generosity and kindness stemmed from there.His calm-wolfish-predator persona led him to feel the air move slowly whenever he was around Matthias. It was Duke Herhardt, whom he was familiar with.Hence, when Matthias added the term \u2018ASAP\u2019 to his order, Mark Evers briefly questioned his ears. After his brain processed hard, he quickly grew impatient and frantically began investigating Daniel Rayner.\u201cMaster, this is Evers.\u201dMark Evers galloped to the Duke\u2019s Office on the third floor and knocked on the door. A light source glinted through the door plate, but no answer came from behind the closed jamb.In other words, it meant\u00a0\u2018Yes.\u2019He slowly threw open the door and entered the office. Matthias was sloping on the spacious leather sofa. It was a brisk night, yet he was still clad in formal attire from his previous meeting with a business partner.\u201cIt\u2019s about Daniel Rayner, as you asked.\u201dMark Evers politely placed the file folder he was carrying on the table.Matthias dropped his hand from his temple and took the document; he then started flipping the pages. His stance, attentively scanning the papers in his hands, was definitely that of the Duke Herhardt Mark Evers knew.But the peace was short-lived, and Mark Evers was soon thrust into a direful scene.Matthias busted a gut as he reached the last page of reading. He had no clue why misfortune was playing such a cruel joke on Daniel Rayner; enticed by foreign mining investment but duped, then detained and forced to give up his house as collateral, he invested a huge sum of money and ended up in Queer Street*.\u00a0(T/N: In difficulty, typically by being in debt)What a gut-wrenching loss!\u201cDaniel Rayner, it seems he has paid off all of his bank debt recently.\u201dMatthias folded the document in his hand. One of his lips curled upward. His expressionless face was quite gentle, but when he giggled like it was entertaining, he portrayed an image of himself as a cold-hearted person.\u201cYes, Master. I\u2019d like to report it to you. He didn\u2019t pay off the whole balance, but it was big enough to save his house from being seized. It happened this afternoon, and therefore, I am unable to include it in the report.\u201d\u201cThe amount of cash must come from Etman.\u201d said Matthias. He continued,\u201cLinda Etman.\u201dMatthias spoke the name slowly and gave a Bronx cheer.\u201cSo, what should I \u2026 .\u201d\u201cGood job. Call Hessen.\u201dInstead of responding, Matthias gave another command.Although he looked puzzled, Mark Evers followed the call, and he didn\u2019t ask anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And I think Dr. Etman was equally willing as well.\u201dNothing in his report seemed surprising.Jutting his chin, Matthias giggled and put down the file.Linda Etman was the scheme\u2019s brain.Matthias fixed on based from information he got about the stupid stranger he had met that morning.Mrs. Etman seemed to be pleased with his son\u2019s marriage at first glance. But who would have expected that her revealing-true-stripes would be much more toxic and menacing?Though it\u2019s unrelated to him, but Matthias didn\u2019t want to miss the spectacle of their household\u2019s intriguing drama.The look on Leyla\u2019s face gave an impression that she was all-knowing. Yet, in reality, she was completely clueless about how the world went about its job.Should he now refer to her as a fool?As he took Matthias\u2019 silence as a kind of opposition, Hessen braved to ask,\u201cMaster, if the your will is different\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Matthias cut him short. A sneer surfaced on his lips. \u201cI respect grandmother\u2019s wishes. I\u2019m not against it.\u201dFrom the time he said it, Matthias was inwardly in no doubt. Linda Etman must have planned the plot wisely without a lapse in her forethought.The chess piece she had bought with her cash was a kind of a moron, but not with her very precise and bold scheme. She wasn\u2019t na\u00efve enough to be ignorant that many people would gladly pay for Leyla Lewellin\u2019s lost tuition. She must already be aware of it just by looking at her husband.So what\u2019s her true purpose?Matthias touched the tip of his chin, having her inside his brain.Why would Linda Etman create such a fuss when she knew it\u2019s hardly possible to hinder Leyla from going to college with Kyle Etman even if her money was stolen?Matthias pursed his lips as if faced with an enticing riddle.\u201cPut someone on Mrs. Etman.\u201dAnnounced Matthias as he elegantly crossed his legs. His unamused visage was gentler than the recent command that escaped from him.\u201cMrs. Etman? Are we talking about Dr. Etman\u2019s wife, our family doctor?\u201d\u201cYes. Linda Etman. The doctor\u2019s wife.\u201dHis plainspoken reply made Hessen stagger somehow.\u201cThere\u2019s just one thing you need to report.\u201dMatthias rested his tired back against the sofa, a grin was tightly plastered around his face.He said,\u201cDoes Mrs. Etman meet with Leyla Lewellin separately? And what she talks about if she does.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The next day at dawn, the police officers returned to Arvis. They visited the Duke\u2019s manor and came upon Matthias by chance when he was descending from the stairway to the grand lobby.\u201cGood morning, Duke.\u201d A man with silver hair who was the commander of the police officers gallantly greeted him. \u201cWell, I felt ashamed by the theft incident.\u201dMatthias paused his steps in the middle of the hall, followed by Claudine and his attendants.Hessen made a subtle approach and said, \u201cThey want to ask permission to do another investigation to find eyewitnesses.\u201dMatthias nodded approvingly, \u201cSure, as much as you want.\u201d\u201cThank you, Duke.\u201dUpon the salute from their commander in the front row, the young officers at the rear dipped their heads quickly.Matthias was about to continue his stride when the silver-haired officer lifted his head and suddenly addressed him.\u201cSo, Duke.\u201dMatthias turned his gaze back, his face had a calm demeanor.\u201cDid you see anyone suspicious in the estate that morning?\u201dThe hesitant officer posed the question cautiously. Matthias took a second then made his way slowly up to him.\u2018I saw it.\u2019That was a simple answer he should have given, however, Matthias just smiled gracefully instead. He mulled his thoughts regarding Leyla Lewellin for a while;\u2018What should I do?\u2019What if he exposed Mrs. Etman and her early-bankrupt cousin\u2019s conspiracy to thwart her son\u2019s marriage now?Though the dire situation was on her hand, Linda Etman could still settle things as long as she wouldn\u2019t show her real fangs in front of Leyla. There would likely be some uproar, but Matthias believed that it would be for a brief moment; Dr. Etman and his son would strive to make sure the marriage will happen.However, Linda Etman was not the kind of person to give up.\u2018Then.\u2019Matthias looked up to the ceiling, and his gaze was drawn to the chandelier\u2019s light.Leyla Lewellin had gained a once-in-a-lifetime windfall; she would live happily ever after.Mrs. Etman wouldn\u2019t be able to meddle after the two of them moved into their newlywed residence in Ratz. Kyle Etman would be a devoted husband who loved and cherished his wife. With the spillage of his love, Leyla would be able to study as much as she wished and perhaps pursue her dream of becoming a scholar.Matthias raised his gaze to the ornate inscription chiseled on the ceiling, high above the chandelier lampshade.He surely could help Leyla if he were willing to trouble himself a bit. Before Linda Etman met her, Matthias had the privilege of meeting Kyle\u2019s mother ahead. Linda Etman would likely withdraw quietly without fanfare if she knew Duke Herhardt had discovered all her schemes, and at least to save her face.It seemed to be a viable way to lessen Leyla\u2019s wounds.Matthias gave the officer a once-over without a word being spoken. The senior officer stood in the state, interpreting that the Duke\u2019s silence was a reprimand for his rudeness.Matthias knew what makes Leyla happy And he could save her source of happiness just with a single flick of his fingers.\u2018So then\u2026?\u2019Matthias\u2019s lips were drawn onto another smirk.\u2018What pleasure can he gain from helping Leyla in finding her happiness?\u2019All that remained in him was the dreary roses season in the absence of her, which would be a fissure in his idyllic world.\u201c\u2026I saw no one.\u201dMatthias replied curtly, as his eyes narrowed while staring at the officer. The faces of people watching them were a mixture of worry and soon-relief.\u201cAh, yes. Well, thanks for your understanding, Duke. My apologies for all of my rudeness.\u201dMatthias accepted his apologies with a kind nod.\u201cHave you ever seen a stranger?\u201dThe officer\u2019s cooperative attitude had prompted him to pose the same question to Claudine, who stood behind Matthias.\u201cNo.\u201d Claudine answered without a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have any information that can help your investigation.\u201d She gave Matthias a passing glimpse before turning to look at the officer with a smiling face.After the case was closed, Matthias then resumed walking. The officers were left to question the employees, and Matthias got into the car which was parked outside the front door.\u201cYou didn\u2019t forget your promise, did you?\u201dClaudine kindly reminded him about their afternoon appointment; to join Riette for dinner after drinking tea together.\u201cOf course I remember, My Lady.\u201dClaudine\u2019s face lit up at Matthias\u2019 answer.The car sped away from the Estate\u2019s main gate, and soon departed the Estate. Matthias averted his gaze out of the window as the car drove down the road passing through the Doctor\u2019s residence.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Linda Etman wished for an amount of fun beyond her wildest dreams as a reward for her wait-and-see hard work.She donned a stylish lilac dress. Her face had some light y makeup, and her chosen hat was both classy and modest in style. Her appearance wasn\u2019t supposed to be showy. However, her elegance barely made her appear shabby in her attire today.Mrs. Etman admired her reflection in the mirror for the second before stepping out of the bedroom.Today she chose to walk rather than take the carriage.The place she was going to wasn\u2019t a crowded one. She would go unnoticed from all eyes, so she purposely cherry-picked a location distant from the cottage as she needed a quiet place to meet Leyla.Mrs. Etman was a million miles away as she waited for the carriage at the stop. She had started everything, and with no way to turn back, she was left with no choice but to go ahead.For her son, Kyle.The carriage came shortly when she sought to gather her wits. Mrs. Etman climbed into the carriage, and from her mouth came out a slight sigh within her breath.She was willing to go to any length for Kyle even if she were to become a villainess.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The tea shop that Mrs. Etman told was located a couple of miles away from the downtown area. Leyla arrived earlier than their appointment time, so she sat at the table near the sunny window, waiting for Mrs. Etman\u2019s arrival.Rows of brick houses draped in ivy were lined the opposite side of the narrow road, it was barely wide enough for a wagon to pass. Stores with rustic and plain signage padded the left and right sides of the alley.Likewise, the tea shop. The fading paint, worn furniture, and antique windows, as well as the tea-stained tablecloths, to name a few things. It was a place that didn\u2019t seem to be to Mrs. Etman\u2019s liking.\u2018Why did she choose this place?\u2019Leyla decided not to be biased despite her cryptic feelings. The more she thought about it, the more anxious she became. She was averse to adding more to her already overburdened mind\u2019s about the thievery.So, Leyla didn\u2019t want to continue assuming the worst that may happen.\u00a0 Mrs. Etman may need a private talk with her in a less crowded place. There was undoubtedly plenty of things to discuss, and\u2026Layla\u2019s thoughts that were trapped by the paralysis of analysis, were shortly disturbed by the clatter of a chime. She sprang to her feet, thinking it was Mrs. Etman who was coming. Instead, a young man walked into the shop. He was dressed conservatively in a suit complete with a fedora hat. He took a seat at a corner table and then opened a newspaper.Leyla slumped on her chair, her eyes were fixed on the tea stains on the tablecloth.She went to the police station today, but the case made no significant progress thus far. The lack of witnesses and evidence made it difficult for them to catch the thief. A policeman who took pity on her kindly advised; it\u2019s better not to cling to a shaky hope and find someone else to lend her money urgently.\u2018Should I?\u2019Dr. Etman, together with Duchess Norma and Lady Claudine, said that they would instead pay for her tuition. This morning, Madam Mona also visited her. She sweetly consoled Leyla and Bill by telling them if the thief wasn\u2019t caught, Arvis\u2019s workers had committed to fundraising for her college.Their kindness weighed heavily on her heart.When her deep sorrow was expressing itself through a sigh, the bell sounded again. Leyla jumped up from her chair reflexively and turned around.\u201cHello, Mrs. Etman.\u201dLeyla faintly smiled and bowed her head. The real Mrs. Etman was now standing in front of the opened door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She straightened her posture and put her hat on the other chair.Different nuances presented by Mrs. Etman when she saw her today left Leyla feeling uneasy.\u201cYou\u2019ve probably just returned from the police station.\u201d Mrs. Etman spoke first, \u201cHow\u2019s the investigation going on?\u201d\u201cThey haven\u2019t found any clues yet,\u201d Leyla said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not over yet, so I don\u2019t want to give up.\u201d\u201cWell, Leyla. I don\u2019t think it is a wise choice.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dTaken aback, Leyla asked once again when the tea she had ordered came. An awkward silence prevailed between the two until the waiter left after carelessly dropping the cup on the table.\u201cMay I ask what you mean, Ma\u2019am?\u201dLeyla breached the stillness first.\u201cYour money, I have it.\u201dMrs. Etman uttered those without a trace of guilt; her sight dipped to the clouded boiling steam of the teacup.Leyla\u2019s face was soon obscured by fluster. The words she had clearly heard sounded just like a delusion.Mrs. Etman lifted her gaze to Leyla and again firmly said, \u201cI was the one who stole your tuition.\u201d\u201cNo, that can\u2019t be. How could someone like you do that?\u201dHer stiff lips tried to smile. Leyla was unable to understand how Mrs. Ethman could make such a bad joke. Yet, Mrs. Etman\u2019s eyes were chilling.\u201cI hid it. I knew it was wrong, but I wanted to prevent you from going to college with Kyle.\u201d\u201cNo, that can\u2019t be-\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s stealing\u2014a pathetic and cruel theft. Nevertheless I did it. I want to keep you away from Kyle.\u201dLeyla\u2019s mind went completely blank. The gruesomely obvious truth said by Mrs. Etman jolted her awake, and she decided that she could no longer keep on living in denial.\u201cLeyla, I hate you.\u201dMrs. Etman stared at Leyla. Her disappointment and fatigue were epitomized in her greyish eyes.\u201cI really hate you to the point that I believe it would be better for me to be a criminal than to accept you as Kyle\u2019s wife.\u201d\u201cM-Mrs. Etman\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought you were a good girl who knew her place. I never thought that you were trying to use Kyle as a launching pad for your greed.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Ma\u2019am?\u201d Leyla fiercely shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not like that. How could I think like that about Kyle? I-I could never\u2026\u201dShe got the shock of her life and failed to notice her hands trembling at the edge of the table as well as her entire body starting to shudder.\u201cAre you friends with Kyle for this purpose? Using Kyle to go to college and marrying Kyle to improve your humble status in life?\u201dMrs. Etman chastised and cornered the wordless Leyla even more harshly. Though she knew that Leyla\u2019s feelings for Kyle stayed within the bounds of brotherhood or friendship in the past.Rather it was her son, Kyle, who fell head over heels in love with her, instead of Leyla. Leyla would not be caught up in this presumptuous affair if it weren\u2019t for her bumbling son. It was always this truth that wounded her self-esteem, and now it became the reason why she loathed Leyla even more.\u201cMy hatred for you has turned me into a thief. I resent you enough to do this, and that will never change. Do you think we can become a family like this?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to tell me, Ma\u2019am?\u201dLeyla\u2019s voice trembled, but she kept a straight face before Mrs. Etman.\u201cYou must already know. You are a smart girl.\u201d Mrs. Etman stated briefly. Her eyes shone as cold as the untouched cup of cheap tea, while looking at her.\u201cIf you have something to say, just tell me,\u201d said Leyla. Her glassy, round eyes glimmered in the rays of sunshine that fell upon her despondent face. The ugly face she wished to conceal at the moment.\u201cYou can tell Kyle and the rest of the world that I did such despicable acts to stop you two from getting married.\u201dYou\u2019ll never be able to do that\u2013 Mrs. Etman looked confident through her words as she knew Leyla\u2019s personality.\u201cKyle will be very disappointed with me if you tell him regarding this,\u201d She recited. \u201cOur relationship will all but be broken, and maybe even our whole family\u2019s harmony.\u201dMrs. Etman\u2019s expression became colder as she saw Leyla stiffening.\u201cSince all of this has happened, it makes no difference whether you keep this a secret or tell Kyle everything. You and Kyle won\u2019t be able to get married. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d\u201cDo you hate me so much that you have to do this\u2026?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I already tell you? I really hate you.\u201dMrs. Etman rose from her seat and walked away.\u201cI hate you terribly. You pushed me to take such an extreme choice; I really despise you, Leyla.\u201dMrs. Etman stared at her with a steely gaze. Her eyes could not hide her contempt.\u201cI will refund your money after the registration date.\u201dShe swallowed the curse words that were already on the tip of her tongue, knowing Leyla would have understood; that she should leave Kyle without wasting time or making a scene out of it.Mrs. Etman was about to turn around when she groaned and lowered her eyes down.\u201cToday, I\u2019m very resentful of Mr. Remmer.\u201dShe said,\u201cWhy did he have to take you in and create such a tragedy in Arvis ?\u201dThose last words\u2026\u2026. hit Leyla the hardest.Her eyes froze and then turned glassy in a blink.Mrs. Etman strolled out of the tea parlor leisurely, leaving the poor little girl behind, who didn\u2019t weep till the very end.In her wake a tinge of pleasure and guilt was clinging like a shadow on the tips of her toes as she went.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*He saw Leyla.Her petite frame was crouched down beneath the blooming dry cottonwood tree on the roadside leading to the manor.Matthias, who was peering out the car window, did recognize her figure. All he could see was her back, but he felt confident that it was her.\u201cDoesn\u2019t that girl under that tree look like Leyla?\u201dThe driver frowned as he kept an eye on a girl he seemed to know.\u201cIs she sick?\u201dMark Evers, the Duke\u2019s aide, wondered as well so his voice was filled with concern.Meanwhile, their car edged closer to Leyla, who was curled up on the ground. Leyla quickly stumbled up and straightened stiffly when she sensed their upcoming approach. She bent her head so deep that they couldn\u2019t see her swollen face, but it was noticeable that she wasn\u2019t fine.Following that, Mark Evers continued to look out the car window before turning his gaze to the rear seat. He was reluctant to ask his Master, but his eyes were filled with hope that they could stop the car for a moment and help Leyla.The driver\u2019s thinking seemed to be in tune and he steadily slowed down the car\u2019s speed.Matthias glanced outside the car window at the slow-moving scenery beyond. Leyla was leaning against the trunk of the tree with her head down.She was crying.Matthias was sure of what he had seen on her face. Nobody else in this world had a better understanding of Leyla Lewellin\u2019s tears than he did.Matthias clammed up. He turned his gaze away from the car window in place of his answer.His assistant couldn\u2019t add any more words, with only a sad expression on his face. The driver, likewise, accelerated the car\u2019s speed to comply with his Master\u2019s wishes.Matthias immensely enjoyed Leyla\u2019s tears, as he always did.It entertained him. But, he wanted to monopolize her tears for his own pleasure.The idea of someone else having to step in to create those kinds of entertainment wasn\u2019t pleasurable.The car fled the scene, leaving Leyla alone with her tears, and soon stopped at the Mansion\u2019s entrance.Matthias stepped out of the limousine, with a face that appeared more relaxed.\u2018Linda Etman, has she taken action?\u2019That was the only explanation he could think of for Leyla to cry until her shoulders sagged. And his guess seemed to be right. It was proven by Hessen, who approached him with a concerned face.\u201cMaster, I have something to report.\u201dHe spoke secretly in a hushed voice as he walked beside Matthias.\u201cIt is an unbelievable story; I\u2019m at a loss for words\u2026\u201dWhen the voice of his capable butler, who seldom panicked, shook a little, Matthias knew that Mrs. Etman had lived up to his expectations.\u201cI\u2019m going to the office.\u201dMatthias said so in matter-of-factly, gentle voice.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cGot cold during summer, huh? It\u2019s all because of that damn thief that you\u2019re sick like this.\u201dBill who strutted around Leyla\u2019s bed said.He became concerned when Leyla said that she was ailing and after he saw her going to bed early last night.Leyla said she had a cold and would recover with a bit of rest, but in Bill\u2019s opinion, her condition did not seem to be getting any better.\u201cYou can\u2019t be like this. Mr. Etman\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dLeyla struggled to rise from the bed when Bill was about to turn around. She was shivering even with her thick pajamas, even though the weather had been relatively warm since it was still the wee hours of the morning, she looked as if she had gotten ill overnight.\u201cNo, Uncle. Don\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cI just wanted to call the Doctor because you\u2019re sick? Why? Did you have a fight with Kyle?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cEven though you fought with Kyle, but Dr. Etman\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle, please.\u201d Leyla\u2019s clammy hand, drenched in a cold sweat, groped Bill\u2019s clothes. \u201cI just need a little rest. That\u2019s it. Please let me be.\u201d\u201cLeyla\u2026 \u2026 .\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ll get better soon. Please?\u201dBill could no longer stay stubborn in the face of her desperate begging. He had a hunch it had to be related to Kyle, but he wasn\u2019t in a place to unearth it.He grudgingly nodded, and Leyla seemed relieved just then. Bill could feel a searing pain in his heart when he saw her lying limp on the bed as if she\u2019d fainted.\u201cRight, eat well! Sleep well! I should\u2019ve said that!\u201d Bill yelled aloud, \u201cI\u2019m going to sort it all out. I was on the verge of bursting within now!\u201d He pulled up the blanket\u2019s seam with careful gestures that contrasted with his rough hand and then put a wet towel on her feverish forehead.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart. Even if I can\u2019t catch and kill the thief, I will pay your tuition in some way\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle.\u201dLeyla\u2019s frail voice blended with her heated breaths.\u201cPlease stay here. Don\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d\u201cYou are thinking negatively again.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Uncle.\u201d\u201cWhat gibberish are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIt was because of me.\u201d\u201cIf you keep saying that, I\u2019ll get angry. I\u2019ll come back for sure.\u201dBill regarded Leyla as lying and babbling, and then heaved a deep sigh that silenced her. \u201cFirst, take a rest, Leyla. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dBill shut the window in Leyla\u2019s room and draped the curtains to cover it.\u201cI\u2019m stuffy\u2026 Please open it up a bit.\u201dLeyla, who was shivering from the cold, asked him once again to open it. Her stubbornness persisted even as she lay weak on the bed.Bill had to yield to her pigheadedness for the nth time. Again he rolled up the curtains a bit and partly opened the window, and finally, Leyla closed her eyes.\u201cIf your fever\u2019s not coming down by the evening, whatever you say, I\u2019ll call Mr. Etman. Got it?\u201dHe threatened her, but Leyla stayed quiet as if she hadn\u2019t heard him.Bill then reluctantly left the house, leaving Leyla, who was already dozing off like a log.He hastened off, determined to complete today\u2019s job as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Matthias suddenly realized that this morning, when he was gazing down at the rose garden without Leyla Lewellin.He had his doubts if she would show herself up for now, after being such a downer. Matthias had guessed it at the moment he heard Hessen\u2019s report in his office last night. Nevertheless, witnessing Leyla\u2019s absence with his own two eyes had given him some annoyance.\u2018She\u2019s pretty damn stupid.\u2019While laughing, Matthias rolled down the thin curtain then turned around.Linda Etman\u2019s heist was a ruse.Breaking Leyla Lewellin\u2019s heart and tarnishing her pride was her true purpose. She devised another plan after her failure to stop his son;\u00a0It would be Leyla who needed to be stopped.Matthias delightedly applauded and gave a hats off to Mrs. Etman\u2019s great approach. She had a superb hold on her opponent and stabbed her blade precisely on the target.Her hostility towards Leyla bestowed him with a lot more entertainment than he had expected. Matthias couldn\u2019t keep the laughter from escaping his lips as he listened to Hessen\u2019s report yesterday night.His leisurely weekend morning felt particularly lengthy and stodgy. After changing his clothes, Matthias was once again gazing out of his window while drinking his coffee. Only Bill Remmer and the garden\u2019s employees were there, but Leyla was nowhere to be seen.Was he too greedy in his desire for someone as pathetic as her?Matthias took a little morning stroll while mocking her sorry state of affairs. Usually, he would stop by the annex to swim in his spare time. The servants who were well acquainted with their Master\u2019s routines would flee as soon as they saw him approaching.He wished to see Leyla cry so he could have some good time today.As he was taking pleasure as the wind blew in, Matthias happened to arrive at the gardener\u2019s cottage. The house without Leyla lounging on the porch while reading a book or doing chores diligently in the yard, was much too quiet.Matthias\u2019 annoyance rose a little. It was when a white pigeon suddenly flew into the house.The bird flew straight towards the window at the back of the cottage as if it had a specified destination. Without a second\u2019s hesitation Matthias made a beeline to where the bird had passed. It perched calmly in the half-opened window, and he noticed a note attached to the bird\u2019s leg.Beyond the window was Leyla\u2019s room.The pigeon didn\u2019t flee as Matthias approached it.\u2018Carrier pigeon?\u2019Matthias looked at the bird with a scowl before gently catching it.Although being in human hands, the pigeon was very docile. Matthias stared carefully at the note the bird brought before a sudden cry from the window jarred him out from his muse.Matthias lifted his head, and he found Leyla sniveling and laying in bed like a dead person in her room that he had previously thought was empty.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla opened her eyes and laid still, her gaze was glued to the ceiling for some time.The room was lathered in blinding light. The sound of birds chirping in the tree outside the window was clear and lively , like the summer sunshine in the morning.As her dreamlike senses reawakened one by one, the bitter truth that she had forgotten due to her sickness slowly revived.\u2018How strange\u2026\u2019Leyla felt more at ease when the reality before her eyes grew clearer. The plethora of emotions that had filled a gap in her breath melted away in the guise of cold sweat and tears that broke out without her realizing it.It had been about two\u2026 No, three days had passed.Leyla was counting how much time she had spent laying on bed before slowly raising her body and sitting down. She momentarily felt a little bit groggy but soon regained her composure.She took a look at her bed sheet and thought that it needed to be laundered. The window sills should be wiped as they have become dusty. The dish that Uncle Bill had washed before wasn\u2019t clean enough, so she had to polish it again to get rid of any residual stains, and\u2026For a short spell, Leyla was stunned and closed her eyes, thinking of the many tasks she needed to do. When she reopened her eyes, she calmly decided that one thing should take priority above all else.She has to meet Kyle.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYou can\u2019t go around like this yet, Leyla. You should rest!\u201dKyle speeded up his steps when he spotted Leyla sitting by the stream.Leyla was looking down at her reflection in the water, slowly raising her head to face him. She was pale-faced, with visible symptoms of sickness.\u201cWhy did you come all the way here?\u201d Kyle hurriedly walked over to her side.\u201d I can meet you at home.\u201dWith her knees clasped together, Leyla was sitting on a wide, flat rock by the river. Her wavy, silky golden hair, which draped naturally over her slender shoulders, was like a part of the gleaming afternoon sun.\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dLeyla spoke as she stared at him solemnly, without her usual smile.\u201cSo, what amazing thing are you going to say?\u201dKyle laughed on behalf of her, who showed no sign of mirth. Leyla gazed at him without a word, turning up her nose to join in the laughter. Without the slightest hint of a bad feeling, Kyle broadened his grin.\u201cMeeting somewhere else like this is nice at times, but you\u2019re still unwell. That\u2019s what concerns me.\u201d\u201cKyle.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I had something to convey as well. How fortunate we are to be able to talk here.\u201d\u201cKyle.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the stolen money, Leyla. Tomorrow my father is going to Ratz. Your tuition will\u2013\u201d\u201cKyle, I\u2019m not going to college.\u201dKyle\u2019s words were cut off by Leyla.\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dKyle, who was sitting beside her and watching the river flow, tilted his head. Both exchanged glances. A heavy silence rang between them in a moment as their trapped gazes were locked on each other.\u201cI\u2019m not going to College.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? You passed that difficult exam! Don\u2019t worry about the tuition fees. Leyla please, don\u2019t be so stubborn like th-\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t marry you either.\u201dLayla straightened her knees and re-wrapped her fallen scarf around her neck.\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here with Uncle Bill, and live the life I\u2019ve always dreamt of. I\u2019m sorry, Kyle. I should have told you this from the beginning\u2026.but I\u2026 \u2026 I was blinded by greed for a moment.\u201d\u201cGreed?\u201d\u201cYes, even though I always pretended I didn\u2019t want to, deep down I really wanted to go to College and continue studying. So I decided to get married with the belief that it was possible. In simpler words, to use you on the way.\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll believe such a lie?\u201dKyle scoffed coldly, but Leyla didn\u2019t seem to be shaken.It would be great if everything was a lie.A bitter smile stole over her trembling lips. For a small span of time, Leyla believed it was just sympathy or pity, but she soon got an understanding otherwise.Kyle Etman viewed Leyla Lewellin as a romantic partner.He proposed to her with the heart of a lover. But she accepted him with the heart of a friend.It was a pack of lies if she said that she was not greedy on the inside. It was precisely that fact which sank Leyla\u2019s heart even deeper.\u201cI know you, Leyla. You\u2019re not that kind of person.\u201dKyle leaped to his feet, his towering shadow looming over her.\u201cYou love me. Do I look like an idiot who doesn\u2019t even know that?\u201d\u201cI love you.\u201dLeyla said; she made no denials.\u2018Is Kyle someone I love?\u2019\u2018Yes, she does love him.\u2019\u00a0Leyla would nod her head repeatedly to answer that question. Even if she was asked 1,000 times, she was willing to nod every time with the same answer.\u201cAs my best friend, as an older brother, or sometimes as a younger brother. I love you so much, Kyle.\u201dLeyla remained unflinching even as she beheld Kyle\u2019s growing hardened face.She had to.\u201cBut I know this is not the kind of love you want. I\u2019m sorry Kyle, but I can\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can love you like that. I cannot marry you with this kind of heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t care.\u201dKyle\u2019s throat cramped as he swallowed his spit.\u201cWhatever kind of love it is, as long as it is love, I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s okay even if it isn\u2019t the kind of love I\u2019m looking for, Leyla.\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201dLeyla slowly lifted herself up. Their gazes were riveted between the howl of the forest wind. As she looked at the water that had been blown away by the wind, shaping small ripples on its surface, Leyla caught her breath.Not far from the cottage, this wooded creek was the playground for little Kyle and Leyla. Amidst her fear of water, she was able to dip her feet in the stream that barely reached her knees. Rather than the Schulter River, Leyla enjoyed visiting this place more.She used to read her book on a boulder shaded by a tree, and Kyle would explore the brook, catching crayfish or small fish. He would collect lovely freshwater clams or pebbles, both of which were her favorites.They laughed a lot. Those were always fun and heartwarming moments.The time when she loved him was like that.There were so many pristine memories that were more glorious than playing in the water\u2019s ripples. But still, that time of love was irreplaceable; it would stay within her forevermore.\u2018Even so, I still have to lose you.\u2019\u201cI can\u2019t do it. I want to stop.\u201d Leyla dropped her head to hide her reddened eyes. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Kyle. I should\u2019ve told you from the beginning.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s your only reason, don\u2019t even say that. This world is teeming with people who marry without love. Still, you love me. That\u2019s enough.\u201dKyle approached her and wrapped her shoulders in his grip.\u201cYou use me? Fine. Using me doesn\u2019t matter either.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like this.\u201d\u201cAs long as it\u2019s you, I\u2019m fine. If I can be of any help, feel free to use me.\u201d\u201cKyle!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alright as long as you don\u2019t desert me.\u201d Kyle\u2019s eyes began to flush.Leyla clenched her fists, attempting to fortify her wounded heart.\u201cI hate that. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\u201cIf you really want to go to College. If you\u2019re so desperate enough to use me, then you shouldn\u2019t let me go.\u201d\u201cKyle\u2026 I want to marry someone I love as a man and a lover. The thought of marrying you and going to Ratz made me realize that.\u201dThe vilest things she had been struggling to keep from saying eventually slipped out of her lips. Kyle\u2019s pupils dilated at her reply.\u201cI want to marry such a person and live without shame. My dream to feel that, that kind of love outweighs my ambition to attend college with you.\u201d\u201cLeyla.\u201d\u201cI had thought about using you, and pretending it was alright until the end, but then I felt like I would be ashamed of this choice for the rest of my life. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll regret it. I\u2019m not happy about living in a guilt fantasy.\u201d\u201cLeyla Lewellin!\u201d\u201cIf I make such a choice, I fear it would taint my time and my heart, which loves you as a friend and a family member. I hate it the most and am scared of its occurrence.\u201dHer heartfelt voice was faintly shaking.When the time came for her to become a grownup, she made the most childish decision she could imagine.Leyla ballooned her dream of attending college together for fear of losing him. But, in the end, this marriage turned out to be a genuine mistake that garnered her much regret.Mrs. Etman was entirely right. The moment she accepted Kyle\u2019s proposal, her relationship with him had already crossed the line of no return.Mrs. Etman\u2019s resentment towards her was too much for her to endure. Leyla couldn\u2019t separate Kyle from his beloved mother; moreover, she didn\u2019t want Uncle Bill to get hurt.The trigger had already been pulled; the only thing that can be gained by revealing the truth would be a gash in everyone\u2019s heart. Leyla felt her body had been drained out of all the water after shedding so many tears, and there was no turning back at the end of the road.So she had to turn around at this point, in silence.It was the only way to save her last semblance of pride, Kyle\u2019s family, and Uncle Bill\u2019s heart.\u201cLet me have that dream, Kyle.\u201dLeyla whispered as she looked at Kyle.\u201cWe\u2026 Let\u2019s do that\u201d.\u2018So, let us bid farewell to those precious sparkling days and become adults.\u2019Leyla let out a quiet sigh against voicing what she intended to say. Her faintly heated breath flowed through her parched lips.\u2018Don\u2019t cry.\u2019Tears didn\u2019t spring up in her eyes, fortunately. The spell she had learned along the way somehow had shown its worth.\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201dKyle, who was standing still, grabbed Leyla by the wrist as she passed him. His big, hot hands were shaking.No answer.Leyla opened her tightly-closed eyes and pushed his hand away.Kyle\u2019s hand fell off so easily. His grip on her wrists had lost its strength.Leyla walked away with weightless steps, leaving Kyle behind , who was standing stiffly staring at the stream.Her misty-eyed gleamed a shade of red, but they were held back until the moment she arrived at the cottage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mrs. Etman could foresee the ending of the two of them based on her son\u2019s condition, who was confined to his room with his lips clamped shut.\u201cMadam, the Young Master skipped lunch today as well.\u201d With a worried face, the housekeeper reported to Mrs. Etman, who had just come down from the second floor.\u201cLeave him alone. He will also have a hard time swallowing food when having a breakdown.\u201dMrs. Becker\u2019s eyes widened at Mrs. Etman\u2019s unexpected response regarding her son. She seemed overjoyed, even though her son had skipped every meal since yesterday. But Mrs. Becker decided not to ask further, knowing that her milady would seldom reveal the actual reason, so she just bowed her head and walked away instead.Mrs. Etman visited the garden after a long absence to tend to the flowerbed. The garden at Etman\u2019s house was brimming with exquisite and different kinds of roses which were imported from Arvis\u2019s shrubbery. She received several roses from Elysee von Herhardt, who exclusively gifted the flowers to her closest wives.She was the only woman without a title in Carlsbar who had fellowship with the two Duchesses of the Herhardt household and several people didn\u2019t know how proud she was of it. She believed that Kyle\u2019s marriage to the lower-noble-lady that was introduced by Norma von Herhardt would enhance the Etman family\u2019s social standing.How hard she toiled to get here, now her husband and son tried to thwart her efforts, only for the sake of one girl named Leyla.Linda Etman readily admitted that she had done a great wrong towards that poor girl. But she had no regrets. For Kyle\u2019s sake, she could have performed far more gruesome acts than that. Leyla would be wise to seek a husband who was on par with her.Mrs. Etman entered the living room, carrying a bouquet of roses that blended harmoniously in hues. She was delicately arranging the flowers in the vase when Dr. Etman came in.\u201cKyle? Is he still doing that?\u201d\u201cYes. Sounds like he went through a lot of trouble.\u201d\u201cI think something happened between him and Leyla.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to see Leyla.\u201dMrs. Etman spoke calmly as she centered the vase on the table.\u201cYou?\u201d\u201cDid you forget? Kyle is my son as well.\u201dShe smiled as she stood.\u201cHe is the son I love much more than you.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla was sitting in the corner of the yard washing a big pot when Mrs. Etman visited her. Her appearance was soaked; the splashing jet of pump water drenched her apron, sleeves, and the crown of her head.\u201cHello, Mrs. Etman.\u201dLeyla got up and greeted her without expressing surprise.\u201cPlease come i-\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo. You don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d Mrs. Etman shook her head after thoroughly scrutinizing Leyla from head to toe and handing her the leather bag she had brought.Leyla could tell what was within without even looking at it. She came close to expressing her gratitude, as she always did after receiving something. But Leyla decided to swallow her words and accept the money bag quietly.Seeing Leyla shut her lips after receiving it, Mrs. Etman furrowed her brow in annoyance.\u201cJudging from the expression on your face, you seem to have a lot to say.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Leyla answered her without a grain of hesitation. She refused to bow her head, which she did the last time at the teahouse.Mrs. Etman erupted in laughter, \u201cWell, go ahead. I\u2019ll understand.\u201d She flashed a kind smile through her lips which were stiff from the bitterness. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re done talking to Kyle.\u201d\u201cYou already know, and that is why you returned our money, right?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mrs. Etman\u2019s eyes fluttered at Leyla\u2019s bold tone, which contrasted markedly with her usual self.\u201cDon\u2019t worry; I made no mention of you.\u201d\u201cWorry?\u201d\u201cYes. You appear worried that I will tell Kyle of what you really did that day.\u201d\u201cHuh. I had no idea you were such a daring child.\u201d\u201cMy apologies if I sounded rude. I just wanted to tell you that Kyle doesn\u2019t know what happened that day.\u201dLeyla bowed her head to express her apology.\u201cI didn\u2019t tell Kyle,\u201d she said. As her gaze returned to Mrs. Etman again, her eyes grew fiercer. \u201cI won\u2019t ever tell him in the future as well.\u201dEven mentioning Kyle\u2019s name made Leyla\u2019s heart ache. The memory of Kyle\u2019s back, which she had abandoned by the river that day, would forever change her life. It would undoubtedly stay as a pain inside that will last for the remaining of her days.\u201cI\u2019m going to do it for Kyle, not for anyone else.\u201d\u201cFor Kyle?\u201dMrs. Etman was snide, but Leyla didn\u2019t seem to mind.\u201cYes. I know. I know that Kyle loves his mother very much. Whatever you do to me, you are Kyle\u2019s precious mother. So I want to protect the mother he loves.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help but marvel how a brat like you has lived this long wearing the mask of a sweet and kind faced child.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I offended you.\u201dLeyla again dipped her head politely. Mrs. Etman blanched in response to what she perceived to be a sign of ridicule.\u201cBut, I meant that sincerely. I just wanted to let you know that you have nothing to worry about.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a ballsy promise, so I\u2019ll try to believe it.\u201dMrs. Etman felt relieved but scrunched her eyes to disguise it.\u201cSince you said that you did it for Kyle, I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll explain to Kyle why you called off the wedding in a way that doesn\u2019t cause him undue pain.\u201d\u201cYes. I will do that. Instead, Mrs. Etman\u2026\u201dLeyla looked down at her money bag, then slowly lifted her gaze.\u201cI want you to apologize for one thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What? Apologize?\u201d\u201cYes. I can accept whatever you tell me, even if it\u2019s false, I will still accept it. But I want you to apologize for what you said about Uncle Bill.\u201dLeyla raged. Her hand holding the bag became pallid, but she did not attempt to revert.\u201cYou said that you hated Uncle Bill for bringing about such a tragedy into your life by raising me.\u201dMrs. Etman snorted as if she couldn\u2019t comprehend what she was saying. Again, Leyla badgered her into apologizing.\u201cPlease apologize for that.\u201dHer voice was soft yet insistent, borne on the wind of a beautiful summer evening.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias\u2019s lips broke in a grin as he leaned against the wall, having to eavesdrop on their interesting conversation.He just finished swimming when he suddenly stepped foot towards the gardener\u2019s cottage while on his way back home, expecting to see Leyla crying there. And Matthias had no regrets about making such a snap choice after witnessing a spectacle that was even more enthralling than her tears.He was eager to see what look Mrs. Etman would put on her face, but Matthias decided to be patient, knowing that his entrance would merely bring their fascinating play to an end.Matthias took a seat on the window frame leaning against Leyla\u2019s room window facing the backyard. He enjoyed watching the white pigeon pecking on its food as he awaited Linda Etman\u2019s answer.\u201cWhat people say is true; One\u2019s roots cannot be deceived\u201dAfter some silence, Linda Etman\u2019s voice became strained with a maddening rush that she couldn\u2019t hide.\u201cApologize? I\u2019d rather feel sorry for Mr. Remmer, that poor man who reared a child like you.\u201d\u2018Linda Etman, as one would expect.\u2019Pleased that his second prediction came true, Matthias petted the docile pigeon. He recalled seeing Leyla\u2019s figure through the window of his car a few days ago. It was all still fresh in his mind; she sobbed piteously, and her body was soaked in a cold sweat. She had difficulty breathing properly, and her shaking body appeared scruffy.\u201cVery pathetic.\u201dMatthias gave a mocking smirk. His twitching lips gleamed in crimson red.\u201cIf she has something to say, tell her, say it aloud. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dAfter he gently spoke to the pigeon, Matthias left the cabin, dumping the drudgery spectacle behind.Then, he decided.If Leyla couldn\u2019t provide him with some fun, he would simply\u00a0create his own.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The hearsay started from Mrs. Mona.\u201cHave you guys heard? The reason why Leyla and Kyle broke up.\u201dWhenever she encountered the other employees of the duchy, Mrs. Mona would return in her furious tone to tell the marvelous story she had overheard previously.\u201cIt was Mrs. Etman who stole Leyla\u2019s tuition from Mr. Remmer! The Postman just told me. She sent someone else to steal their money. She wanted to make Leyla drop out of College and cancel her marriage with Kyle!\u201dMrs. Mona held her breath momentarily as she spoke to add a dramatic effect, just like a popping firecracker.Everyone laughed in tandem, they were all blown away. Mrs. Mona was well-known as a chatterbox. She eschewed idle gossip and never failed to give a solid grounding for every one of her storylines.\u201cI know. You can\u2019t believe it. Because I was like that too at first. However, the police had arrested the person who acted as Mrs Etman\u2019s lapdog in stealing the money. The Postman, Mr. Berger saw the thief in person when he was delivering the letter to the police station. He heard what had happened from the policemen. I bet you would all be shocked to know who he is.\u201dMrs. Mona deliberately dropped her voice as she reached the story\u2019s most intriguing part.\u201cDo you all know Mr. Rayner? The businessman, who is also Mrs. Etman\u2019s cousin? Oh, my God, he was the thief!\u201d\u201cWhat, Mr. Rayner? That Daniel Rayner?\u201d\u201cYes! That Mr. Rayner!\u201dMrs. Mona\u2019s tone grew more spiteful as they all noisily parroted the question in disbelief.\u201cAnd after she stole the money, Mrs. Etman asked for a face-to-face meeting with Leyla, at some point she confronted her and said, \u2018How dare you marry my son?\u2019 A stranger who happened to overhear their quarrel became suspicious and reported it to the police, which led to his arrest.\u201dFollowing that, the story rolled about like fireworks dotting upwards the night sky.\u201cIndeed, she was a wicked woman. How could she do such a cruel thing to that poor child?!\u201dThe stunned looks on her audience\u2019s faces grew wider when Mrs. Mona raised her voice as she struggled to suppress her emotions.\u201cI knew it! There is no way that Leyla would ever give up on college or marriage without doing anything.\u201d\u201cHow could she have done such a horrible act? That noble Mrs. Etman.\u201dThe excited crowd flocked over to lend their voices. They all quickly developed into enthusiastic orators with the same veins as Mrs. Mona and began spreading the truth at the same speed.The word quickly traveled throughout Arvis\u2019s Mansion, needing less than half a day, to be precise.It was late afternoon when Mrs. Mona, who seemed to have subdued her fury, saw Bill Remmer who was calmly working in the garden.\u2018It seems, the dim-witted guy still doesn\u2019t know.\u2019Regardless of how excited Mrs. Mona was about relaying the story, she was unhappy since this matter concerned someone close to her.\u2018But Bill Remmer is like Leyla\u2019s father. He is someone who needs to know this better than anyone else.\u2019In her inner battle, Mrs. Mona made up her mind,\u201cYes. I have to tell him.\u201dFinalizing her decision, she began waddling towards the garden.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Come out now! Right now!\u201dKyle slowly raised his tired body. The man\u2019s thunderous yelling and whale-like voice was not a stranger to his ears.\u201c\u2026Uncle Bill?\u201dKyle sprang out of his bed in surprise. He hastily walked to the window and witnessed a quarrel between Bill Remmer and a housekeeper at the front door.\u201cWhat kind of commotion is this?\u201d Mrs. Etman appeared with a haughty yell.\u201cMrs. Etman, are you the damned thief? Is this an act that can be committed by someone who has been revered as a noble? No matter how much you hate Leyla, how could you do this?!\u201dKyle, who was rushing towards them to break up the brawl, suddenly stopped like a dead person in his tracks.Thief?Why did Uncle Bill mention the thief?To my mother?Kyle stood frozen in a conundrum as Bill spewed forth an implausible gruesome story in a fit of anger. His body suddenly became like a stiff board as he listened to those unbelievable utterances.\u201cNo-Nonsense\u2026 How could he accuse my mother of such a heinous crime\u2026\u201dMumbling blankly, Kyle lurched out of the room. He made his way down the stairwell in stumbling steps.He couldn\u2019t take Uncle Bill\u2019s persecution towards his mother, no matter how angry he was about the theft incident.\u201cDid Leyla say that?\u201dMrs. Etman asked sharply after Bill stopped screaming.\u201cGood grief, how could she slander me like that\u2026..\u201d\u201cDoes Leyla look like a child capable of telling such things?\u201dBill shouted out in tears when Kyle was about to step out to the front door.\u201cIf Leyla told me, my heart would not have been ripped asunder like this!\u201d\u201cIf you want to create a scene by uttering nonsense, go back now! Before I call the police!\u201d\u201cDo you dare to call the police?! Do you think you can bring the police when the postman saw your cousin being taken to the police station?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Wh-what?\u201dMrs. Etman staggered. She took a step back.\u2018Please, mother.\u2019Kyle prayed as he looked at his mother\u2019s back.\u2018Please say no, you\u2019re not the culprit, say that it was just a slander\u2019.Mrs. Etman kept mum, but her breathing was labored. Due to fear, her grip on the railing started to tremble.Kyle waddled towards his mother.\u201cMother.\u201dMrs. Etman was stupefied. Only after hearing his pained voice, she noticed her son\u2019s presence standing behind her.\u201cThat was not true, right?\u201d Kyle grabbed her arm. \u201cIt was just a misunderstanding, right? Tell me. ?\u201dKyle tried to laugh but failed. It was painfully obvious that this moment was real, yet a dense fog seemed to shroud his head.For him, the last couple of days were hellish. He visited, coaxed, and begged many times, but Leyla refused to change her mind. In his profound sadness, time was slipping away.Kyle had nonetheless pinned his vague hopes. His father, who went to Ratz, had already paid Leyla\u2019s portion of the tuition. He believed everything would be fine as long as he could persuade Leyla and assure her. So he planned to visit Leyla this evening and cajole her once again;\u2018If marriage was too much of a burden, then how about an engagement? Let\u2019s go to college together while we\u2019re engaged.\u2019Engaged\u2026That was enough for him.As time passed by, he believed that Leyla\u2019s feelings would grow into that of a lover. Thus, they would live happily ever after.But now\u2026.\u201cMother!\u201dKyle gasped as his voice was stymied by tears.Mrs. Etman froze and gazed down at the railing. Her face was pale and her lips were zipped tightly.That moment, Dr. Etman arrived at the scene. He got out of the car alongside two police officers. Mrs. Etman\u2019s legs buckled when she saw them and collapsed on the floor.Dr. Etman begged the police to allow him to approach his wife alone. Strained expressions were plastered on his face.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Remmer.\u201d He went towards Bill Remmer first and took off his hat. \u201cEven if I had ten mouths, I have nothing to say. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dKyle\u2019s eyes welled up with despair as he watched his father apologizing repeatedly.\u201cAs you can see, the situation is dire now, and it seems difficult to have a proper talk. Can I meet you and apologize again after things have calmed down?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s do that.\u201dBill Remmer furiously wiped his tears and nodded his head. As he stepped back, the officers came forward.\u201cWhy did you do that, dear?\u201d Dr. Etman\u2019s gaze fell coldly on her crouched wife.\u201cNo. It\u2019s not what you think\u2026..\u201d\u201cDaniel is at the police station. He confessed everything. You bribed him.\u201dAs soon as that name escaped from her husband\u2019s lips, Mrs. Etman\u2019s lips clamped shut. She had nothing to say to defend herself.\u201cSo don\u2019t try to lie to me, Linda.\u201d\u201cDear!\u201d\u201cAre you going to pretend that you accept Leyla and do things like that in the future? You are not just my wife, but also Kyle\u2019s mother!\u201dDr. Etman eventually lost his temper. An uncontrollable surge of fury he couldn\u2019t suppress anymore distorted his face.\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault!\u201dMrs. Etman lashed out irately as she cried.\u201cWhy? Why the hell did you allow Leyla to wreak destruction on my life?!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of rubbish are you spewing now that you\u2019ve committed such a crime?\u201d\u201cNo. It was all your fault! As I had already said, I disliked her from the beginning! I would not have come this far if you had just listened to me back then! If it was not for you, I, I\u2026\u2026.\u201dA loud sob escaped her mouth, and the hands covering her face soon became doused with tears.With a sigh, Dr. Etman roused his sobbing wife. The officers showed their respect for the notable doctor by letting him bring his wife inside the car.Kyle stood motionless, watching the nightmarish scene with his eyes wide open.Before long, a thick layer of dusk began to cloak the blue yonder, and he had not yet awoken from that hellish dream.Kyle shut his eyes in the dazzling dusk of the twilight.He wished the entire world would be buried in a blanket of darkness.It was his only hope at the moment.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cUncle, please don\u2019t cry.\u201dLeyla gently placed her handkerchief on the table. Bill, who had been staring at his beer glass sternly as if it was his enemy, lifted his head in bewilderment.\u201cCrying?! Who is crying?\u201dAlthough he vehemently denied it, Bill wiped the wet corners of his eyes with Leyla\u2019s handkerchief.His untouched food had cooled on the plate, but no one was urging him to have the meal. Both Bill and Leyla were mindful; they couldn\u2019t eat.While Bill gulped and emptied his glass, Leyla leaned her gaze at the table\u2019s edge. Her face looked drained.Leyla was unaware of what had occurred until she heard the words of comfort from Arvis\u2019 employees, who came to the cottage. Mrs. Etman was unlikely to divulge the incident on her own, and she also kept her mouth sealed. Nevertheless, everything about that day was eventually disclosed.Leyla had no clue who had informed the police about their private talks. That day, the old tea shop on the outskirts of town had no other visitor except for her, Mrs. Etman, and a stranger.\u2018Who leaked the rumors then? Who the hell is he?\u2019Leyla could not even make a hazy guesstimate, no matter how hard she thought about it.Whatever the case, one thing\u2019s for sure; she had inflicted an irreversible wound on Kyle. She had broken his heart which she wanted to protect. Mrs. Etman was taken to the police station by several officers accompanied by Dr. Etman. And Kyle was there witnessing it all.\u201cLeyla, don\u2019t cry.\u201d Bill put down his glass and handed a handkerchief to her.\u201cCrying, who\u2019s crying?\u201dAs Bill did a while ago, Leyla stubbornly denied and wiped the corners of her reddened eyes.\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t know about the world out there, but I encouraged and pushed you till you suffered painful things like this.\u201d\u201cIf you say that, Uncle, you\u2019re going to make me upset.\u201d\u201cMarriage is\u2026 Yes. I\u2019d rather not let you marry. Right, it\u2019s better like this.\u201dLeyla stayed quiet, but she nodded her head deeply. Her lips glistened faintly as she smiled, dampened by her tears.\u201cBut, I want you to attend College, Leyla. Dr. Etman had already paid for your tuition, and returning the money to them is the same as me paying for your tuition. College has nothing to do with Kyle.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIf you need something like a house or boarding house, I\u2019ll give you more money. My finances might be a bit tight, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll work harder to cover all of your living costs\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle, I will go to college, \u201d said Leyla. \u201cI am not giving up. But, not now.\u201dShe reached out and held Bill\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a teacher.\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m going to save money and retake the exam once I\u2019m able to afford to study in the Capital. That was my original goal and dream. It was just that the shortcut blinded me for a while, but now I\u2019m back on my track.\u201d\u201cBut you can\u2019t just give up after what you\u2019ve been through. You have already been accepted into College.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you believe me?\u201d Leyla smiled peacefully, \u201cEven if I take the exam again, I believe I will still pass it. At that time, I will be accepted with a higher grade to qualify for the scholarship. You will see.\u201d\u201cLeyla, my dear\u2026.\u201d\u201cUncle, didn\u2019t you tell me? I\u2019ll become a good adult. So please trust me one more time.\u201d\u2018This good child, what should I do with her?\u2019Bill opined that it would have been better if she had cried, rather Leyla laughed merrily. She seemed to have no idea that her smile had ripped a hole in Bill Remmer\u2019s heart.\u2018And Kyle, what should I do with you?\u2019Bill\u2019s shoulders began to shake as he couldn\u2019t control his overwhelming mixed feelings. He hurriedly dropped his head, not wanting to show his pitiful state. His thick, hot tears streamed down his face and dropped over the table.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Uncle.\u201dLeyla rose from her chair and approached him.\u201cI\u2019m really fine.\u201d She hugged him with her petite arms. \u201cReally. I don\u2019t want to punish Mrs. Etman. It\u2019s fine now that we\u2019ve got our money back.\u201d Leyla comforted him with a gentle voice and patted him on the back.\u2018What should I do with you?\u2019Tears threatened to spill from his eyes as his hard-strangled words seared from his throat.Bill nodded as he wiped away the tears.He judged what she did to be unpardonable. Bill, however, felt uneasy the whole time after he saw Mrs. Etman collapsing in front of him and Kyle looking so pale. Linda Etman was Kyle\u2019s mother, regardless of how wicked she was. To Leyla, she was like a second mother, as she was the mother of Leyla\u2019s precious Kyle.\u201cLet\u2019s do that. If that\u2019s how you feel, then I\u2019m fine, Leyla.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m curious as to what kind of nonsense this is.\u201dAfter taking a sip of wine, she wiped her lips together in disgust at the vulgar story.\u201cI have to wrap up my relationship with Mrs. Etman.\u201dElysee von Herhardt responded similarly to her mother-in-law.Linda Etman was locked at the police station yesterday night and just got released this noon after Bill and Leyla visited the station, stating they didn\u2019t want to prolong the case since they had already got their money back.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Dr. Etman was greatly disgraced by this event. He\u2019s a good person, but should we change our doctor?\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s not Dr. Etman\u2019s fault, I suppose we don\u2019t need to. This kind of scandal will quieten down after a while.\u201d Duchess Norma resolutely voiced her unwavering faith in Dr. Etman.\u201cI hope Kyle doesn\u2019t get hurt by this.\u201dShe showed some sympathy while speaking about Kyle Etman.\u201cNow that things have turned into such a mess, I regret allowing the child to stay at Arvis.\u201dElysee von Herhardt blurted out at the end of her meal.\u201cLeyla created this whole situation. .\u201dShe looked at Claudine as if seeking an accord.\u201cRight, I think so too.\u201d Claudine gladly nodded her head. \u201cAlthough unintentionally, Leyla has ruined the Etman\u2019s household.\u201dAs she said it firmly, Claudine glanced across the table. Although he was a soft-spoken guy by nature, Matthias was unusually quiet during dinner tonight. Nevertheless, he showed no signs of being strange, rather he seemed to be as gentle as ever.Like the dinner that came to an end, the scandal that had ensnared Arvis manor would soon be forgotten.Mathias went right to his bedroom instead of going to his study.He had instructed Hessen to send the spy who tailed Linda Etman to the police station that day. Matthias wanted him to testify against the theft when the postman was scheduled to deliver the documents to the station.Given the postman\u2019s closeness to Arvis\u2019s employees, he expected the rumors were sure to spread like wildfire.Everything went smoothly according to his plan.And the Arvis\u2019s Chef, a well-known newsmonger, played the last key part in helping the postman with his whistleblower tasks.It was a clich\u00e9 ending, but Matthias had great fun.\u2018Did Linda Etman cry?\u2019Matthias\u2019s thoughts rummaged for that idea as he turned on the lamp near the window.\u2018Probably she did, like Leyla.\u2019That simple climax added another layer of excitement to his stage play.The marriage of Leyla Lewellin and Kyle Etman had now crossed the line of no return. Even if there was such a thing as love, their marriage has undoubtedly been ruled out. To keep it short, Leyla Lewellin had forfeited whatever luck she may have had.Matthias left the window and sauntered to the drink\u2019s cabinet. All of the beverages stored there were still unopened as he wasn\u2019t fond of alcohol.He took out the bottle of wine closest to him and poured the clear amber-colored liquor into his crystal glass.\u2018Leyla\u2019s wings have been cut off.\u2019Matthias pondered calmly as he turned around, with a glass of wine in his hand.\u2018So Leyla will stay inside the cage called Arvis.\u2019His satisfaction at knowing this fact had outweighed his rude awakening.Matthias spent a long time staring at his sleeping canary, snoozing in \u2018her\u2019 comfy cage. His gaze then wandered to the garden outside the window before returning to the golden liquor in his hand.His mood right now wasn\u2019t as bad as the one he had on the late spring night when he heard of Leyla\u2019s upcoming marriage to the doctor\u2019s son.That night was terrible as he remembered when the desire to kill someone took over his head for the first time in his life.Leyla and Kyle\u2019s love story had a better ending than the death of a person.Matthias put the drink he hadn\u2019t sipped on the table quietly.Even without having to borrow the effects of liquor, he was already aware of the way to erase the lump in his heart and his beautiful blues.He just needed to\u00a0own\u00a0her.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The case of stolen tuition, which made Arvis manor fall into a buzz, came to an end at the peak of summer.The matter was flawlessly settled, with Bill Remmer getting his money and Mrs. Etman avoiding punishment thanks to his goodwill. Even so, it wasn\u2019t enough to eradicate the consequences and her ruined afterimage from the public\u2019s mind.\u201cKyle.\u201dDr. Etman slowly opened the door of his son\u2019s room, who didn\u2019t respond to his knocking.Kyle was sitting quietly in front of the desk. He kept looking out the window even though his father approachied him.\u201cKyle.\u201d Dr. Etman called out his name for the second time and tapped him on the shoulder.Surprised, Kyle turned around. His face was worn to a frazzle.Dr. Etman slid his hand away from Kyle\u2019s shoulder and leaned on the edge of his desk.\u201cYour mother is a little better now.\u201d He said.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dKyle answered tersely.Mrs. Etman, who was bedridden from shock after being taken to the police station, drank and ate almost nothing. He was worried as his mother had been suffering from a high fever for several days, but fortunately, her illness had not worsened to a critical stage.\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for a house for you to stay in Ratz.\u201dDr. Etman calmly informed him and Kyle looked stumped.\u201cWhat do you mean by\u2026. house?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a house that\u2019s suitable for living alone, and it\u2019s furnished\u2026\u201d\u201cAm I going to College alone?\u201d Kyle asked with a peal of scornful laughter. \u201cWithout Leyla? After I hurt her like that\u2026 Am I going to College alone as if nothing happened?\u201d\u201cI understand how you feel, Kyle, but your stubbornness on this matter will only hurt Leyla more.\u201d\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s accept it, Kyle, that your relationship with Leyla is over. This is the best option for you and Leyla and also for everyone else. Both of you must live your own lives.\u201dDr. Etman sounded firm, even bordering on cold, ignoring Kyle\u2019s heartbreaking gaze. The situation itself was suffocating for his son, but precisely for that reason, he needed to address his son level-headedly.Nothing mattered more than protecting Kyle. He believed that Kyle\u2019s wounds would gradually fade away after leaving Carlsbar, distancing himself from Leyla, and getting acquainted with a new environment at the university.That was the sole hope Dr. Etman could have for the time being.\u201cYour mother was at fault, but it doesn\u2019t relieve us of responsibility either. We chose to overlook the fact that your mother\u2019s heart could never accept Leyla. You and I , we were the ones who drove her into that corner.\u201d\u201cBecause Leyla is an orphan and doesn\u2019t have a glamorous background, she cannot satisfy mother\u2019s snobbery, that was why Mother can\u2019t accept her? Is that what you meant?\u201d\u201cKyle, enough! Even if she\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s unacceptable to talk badly about your mother!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know anymore. Is she my Mother that I\u2019ve known and loved for so long? And I don\u2019t know why I have to go to college\u2026?\u201d\u201cAre you going to give up your life because of your failed first love?\u201d\u201cLeyla\u2026 Do you think she only means that much to me?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s not the case, you should strive to be more level-headed. The more you act like an idiot, the more painful it gets for Leyla!\u201d\u201cBut, I\u2019m unable to go alone without her.\u201d\u201cYou, and Leyla, are now past hope.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Kyle howled. \u201cThere must be a way. Somehow\u2026 If I beg, if I apologize, if I convince her otherwise\u2026\u201d\u201cWake up, Kyle Etman! Don\u2019t you already know that\u2019s impossible?!\u201dDr. Etman violently quaked his son\u2019s shoulder, his voice rose.Kyle shook his head in denial. He yanked his father\u2019s hand from his shoulder and fled from the room.Dr. Etman, who knew where he was going, decided not to chase after him.Even if it hurts him, he believed, that Kyle had to face reality beyond his hope.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The weather today was sweltering, but Leyla\u2019s attire was orderly groomed, bordering on stuffy.Her blouse\u2019s collar was neatly ironed, the buttons clicked to the neck, and her skirt was faultless, without even a single pleat. Not to mention the pantyhose that cocooned her slender legs.Her appearance didn\u2019t seem to be unkempt at the slightest; even the afternoon sun was diligently bathing the road in its scorching heat.Her cheeks were flushed crimson and out of breath due to the heat. However, Leyla walked gallantly, keeping her posture upright even after reaching a deserted street devoid of people.Leyla Lewellin these days earned sympathy from everyone wherever she went. People openly consoled her and spoke ill of Mrs. Etman. They kicked their tongue in the spleen, and few shed tears after hearing her heart-wrenching story.Similarly, today was no exception. The teacher at Gillis Girls\u2019 High School, whom Leyla met when seeking a teaching job, was the first person to express her pity with a heavy sigh.\u2018Indeed, Leyla. You have to cheer up and think realistically for the solution. It\u2019s sad, but what else can you do? Everything had already happened.\u2019She grabbed Leyla\u2019s hand and said words of comfort repeatedly. Likewise, the familiar faces she encountered in the city did the same.Her gratitude for them was tempered with some shame. Leyla was at a loss for words and just greeted them cordially with a faint smile on her face.Every time she did, Leyla tried not to assume things about the vague smiles that flickered on people\u2019s lips. It was fortunate that she didn\u2019t have to dwell on anything else since she was too busy maintaining her straight-grin mask.\u2018I wish I could cut you off some slack, but this is the best thing I could do right now.\u2019Gillis\u2019s teacher gave a sighing answer after consoling Leyla for a long time.All teaching positions at Carlsbar Primary School had already been occupied. Her last remaining option was to work in a small town about an hour away by train.Leyla eventually accepted the job after much deliberation. Given that commuting would be too exhausting, she needed to find a boarding house near the school. However, she would be able to return to Arvis on weekends. Perhaps after a year of teaching there, she would be offered the opportunity to relocate to a school in Carlsbar.Leyla took off her hat for a moment to recover her breath after arriving in front of the Arvis Estate\u2019s magnificent gateway.She had a harder time dealing with Uncle Bill than anyone else. Uncle Bill always gave her a somber gaze whenever she smiled in front of him. Hence, she couldn\u2019t shed a tear in his presence.\u2018Well, this is good news, so I suppose it\u2019s fine.\u2019Leyla strode along the path in a blue funk. Even if it didn\u2019t mean like she would be saying goodbye to Uncle Bill for good, she felt upset whenever she thought about attending a school that was too far away from home.As she walked, Leyla tried to make her smile a little brighter. She made her way to the garden, eager to tell Uncle Bill the news as quickly as possible.The moment she passed under the arching arbor of the rose garden, Kyle was already standing there, waiting for her.\u201c\u2026 Kyle?\u201dLeyla\u2019s pupils dilated. Kyle rushed up to her as if he were being chased by something and grabbed her wrist. He seemed to be a completely different person right now.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Leyla.\u201d\u201cGo where? Let go of my hand first and then we can talk!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s run away from here, just the two of us.\u201dKyle\u2019s grip, holding Leila\u2019s wrist, grew stronger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her eyes shook the moment she stared at Kyle\u2019s peaky face with his tousled hair and wrinkly clothes.\u201cDon\u2019t be like this, Kyle. We\u2019re now\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go anywhere. Let\u2019s go somewhere where just the two of us can become happy. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d Kyle harshly grabbed her hand and dragged her while mumbling like a lost person, closing his ears.Leyla\u2019s fierce resistance only made Kyle widen his stride ahead without budging.\u201cMr. Remmer! Mr. Remmer! Look over there! Leyla is being dragged away!\u201dA gardener who happened to be nearby witnessed the scene and exclaimed. Bill shifted his gaze to the direction he pointed at.Straightway, his face heated up.Bill threw his pruning shears and frantically chased after Kyle. The baffled employees in tandem quickly joined the bandwagon.\u201cKyle Etman! Let go of her hand right now!?\u201dBill shouted, as anger rose to the crown of his head, struck a chord like thunder. He slammed a punch in Kyle\u2019s face without delay. Kyle slumped and fell, but he dared not release his grip on Leyla\u2019s wrist.In the gusts of wind, Leyla\u2019s body also hit the dirt of the rose bed.\u201cLeyla!\u201dBill screamed in shock and hurried to assist Leyla in getting up. She had scratches on both of her cheeks and the back of her hands from thorny roses.Kyle\u2019s spaced-out eyes began to gradually regain their focus. He got to his feet, ghastly-faced, after seeing Leyla\u2019s face smeared with blood in his sightline.\u201cLe-Leyla! Are you okay? Blood\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dLeyla pushed Kyle\u2019s hand away from her face.\u201cYou look more hurt.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m not \u2026.\u201dKyle then looked at his shirt and bleeding hands. He felt a throbbing pain in his cheek and the back of his neck, but he ignored it.\u201cUncle. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine.\u201dLeyla hurried to stop Bill before he approached Kyle again.\u201cKyle.\u201dShe carefully spoke. Her swollen, glassy eyes captured his face.\u201cThere is no such place.\u201dLeyla\u2019s smiling lips quivered slightly at the corners. Her soothing tone of voice concealed her crimson eyes and heated cheeks.\u201cThere is no such place in the world, Kyle. There\u2019s nowhere in this world where just the two of us can be happy.\u201d\u201cLeyla\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too hard for me if you insist like this. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can stand it.\u201d\u201cPlease, Leyla\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo take care of yourself. Don\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019ll be fine too.\u201d\u201cHow could I be fine without you?\u201d\u201cGo to college as planned\u2026..study hard, and stay healthy. Then, become a good doctor.\u201dLeyla gave Kyle\u2019s wounded eyes a good stare. Bitter tears that trickled down her cheeks had glistened her face in sadness.\u201cMy Kyle. My good friend, Kyle Etman. I want to see you in that light.\u201dA single drop of grief welled up from the corner of his eyes. Kyle swallowed the sobbing with his teeth gritted and stared at her with reddened eyes.\u201cIf you\u2019re doing well, I will be fine too. We might be able to greet each other with a smile as time passes by.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sorry. I\u2019m sorry, Leyla\u2026\u201dKyle\u2019s gut-wrenching sobs that tore apart his chest escaped from between his lips.\u201cI, it was all my fault. Because of me, you\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry.\u201dThe sun\u2019s piercing light descended on him like shards of broken glass. Kyle collapsed to his knees like crushed rose petals strewn over the ground.Leyla shook her head and crouched before him.\u201cNo, Kyle. Don\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t resent you. How can I hate you?\u201d\u201cLeyla.\u201d\u201cSo, take care. You will, right?\u201dKyle gasped as if he was being strangled and hugged her tightly.His dread erupted in a torrent of uncontrolled sobs. Blood and tears dripping from his wounds marred Leyla\u2019s white blouse.Bill let out a long sigh. He withdrew his gaze, unable to bear the sight of the two youngsters hugging. The workers a few feet away also did the same.With resentful eyes, Bill glanced at the sun blazing down on him in the blistering heat. He longed more than ever fqor this bitter summer to elapse ere long.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Kyle Etman left for the capital sooner than scheduled.The Etman household put forward a flimsy reason that they had to prepare for college entrance, but no one believed it.On the morning of Kyle\u2019s departure, Leyla woke up earlier than usual.Kukukukuku\u2026.A bird chirping could be heard from the outside. Leyla turned her head to follow the cries and saw Phoebe sitting on her window ledge.She put her glasses on, ambled up to the window and flung it open.The bird\u2019s ankle was tied along with a scrap of paper. Phoebe was trained as a homey pigeon to fly between her window and Kyle\u2019s room. Leyla didn\u2019t have to candle who the letter was addressed to.She hesitated a while before carefully opening the letter.Leyla, I\u2019m leaving for the capital today.I\u2019m travelling to where I was supposed to go with you. But like a coward I\u2019m leaving alone.I won\u2019t say this is better for us by telling you a plausible lie. Eventually, I\u2019m running away.I\u2019m turning a blind eye to the messed up reality and leaving you behind. I lack the courage to assure you that everything is fine.I\u2019m sorry.I know very well that my apology can\u2019t wash away your wounds. Still, I want to convey these words.I\u2019m sorry for all the pains my mother foisted on you and for my inability to stop her. I was too naive to think that everything could be sorted easily, deaf to your feelings, I ended up hurting you.I\u2019m sorry\u2026.I realized my mistake.But Leyla, I\u2019ll be back.I won\u2019t be too late. I\u2019ll make sure to return to you soon.You may be right when you said that there\u2019s nowhere in this world where only the two of us can be happy.But Leyla, if there is no such place, I\u2019ll ensure that I create one on my own. And I\u2019ll bring you there.Until that day, I will be doing good, just like you\u2019ve asked of me.So take care of yourself too.My beloved Leyla, Goodbye.\u2026.Leyla read through Kyle\u2019s handwritten letter slowly. The dawning wind ruffled her bushy blonde hair, which draped politely over her cheeks.After a long pause, Leyla turned away from the window. She stowed the letter inside her desk drawer and hurriedly started her morning rounds.***It was an insanely hectic day. Leyla meticulously cleaned the entire house as if a single speck of dust wouldn\u2019t be tolerated to stay on the surface of any place. Her kitchen was brimming with delectable food that she had cooked herself.Before long, Bill returned to work after lunchtime, and a couple of Arvis\u2019 workers who were close to them came to the cottage.\u201cLeyla, are you alright?\u201dMrs. Mona worriedly asked as she handed out a basket full of luscious cookies and pastries.\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Leyla flashed a smile and gladly embraced the gift. \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am. Kindly go in and have a cup of tea.\u201d\u201cTea? Oh.. there\u2019s no need to bother really.\u201dMrs. Mona shook her head. Other coworkers nodded in tandem with her.\u201cThat\u2019s right! We just wanted to know whether you\u2019re fine.\u201d\u201cYes Leyla, don\u2019t be sad. First love doesn\u2019t always come true. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a better man than Kyle\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHey, it\u2019s almost time! Let\u2019s go back soon. I have to prepare for the duchess\u2019 tea time.\u201dMrs. Mona swiftly cut her off as she glared at the maid whose words were about to cross the line.Leyla saw them off and went back to the kitchen with a heavy basket. She carefully took out the cookies and cakes from the basket one by one and arranged them nicely on the table.Suddenly her hand stopped. She momentarily froze upon seeing a toasted cracker with a peach jam filling.It was\u00a0Kyle\u2019s favourite cake.Leyla vacantly looked across the table to the chair where Kyle was usually seated. The day when the three of them dined together at this table would never return.That lone chair evoked pleasant memories in her thoughts. The time of their delicious good feasts, warm dim lights and loud chatter on the table. All of it had now gradually perished into a gulf of silence.Leyla blinked and rushed to tidy up the basket before leaving the cottage. She grabbed her well-used sling bag and the hat hanging in front of the rear door and made her way to the forest trail.**Fennel. Yorkshire Fog. Buddleia.Katydid. Green Linnet. Swallowtail.Layla went along the path, whispering the names of the flowers that were blooming. The clinking sound of the stuff in her bag chimed along with the mumbled names of mother earth as a cradle song.After a long trek, Leyla stopped at the foot of an idyllic tree standing on the banks of the Schulter River. She immediately began climbing it to the summit and perched between the thick branches of the wooden trunks.Leyla stared at the bend of the blue Schulter River through her empty gaze.The sparkles of the water scales made her eyes feel cold.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cAs you said, master, it has been handled well.\u201dHessen, who turned back after a short phone call, said. Matthias gave the nod as he had grasped the meaning of the word without the butler\u2019s explanation. His gaze remained patched on the river beyond the colossal window.\u201cThey will notify us by telegram today.\u201dAfter concluding the report, Hessen moved on to the next agenda; the dinner scheduled for the following week and the guest list. The visit of Count Brandt. The issue of workforce expansion. Daily reports and Matthias\u2019 pithy answers were sequentially layered on top of one another.\u201cThen sir, I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201dHessen left the annex after everything was done.Once alone, Matthias descended the stairs connecting to the bottom floor.The pavilion was built in the shape of a floating house on stilts. Half of the ground level was devoted to a boat hangar, designed to be openly attached to the river. Matthias could simply cross the river anytime he pleased by untying their ropes and rowing over.Matthias stripped off his clothes on the hangar\u2019s floor and dived into the water. As he swam across the arched foyer, the dazzling sun soon devoured his nude body bathed under its light.Matthias let the gentle stream of the river cling to his flesh. Through his flexible stroke, he looked like a part of the river at first glance.The lingering attachment that he couldn\u2019t have was bound to grow into a bigger and tougher desire beyond his control, even if he believed, he would soon become tired of it once he had it. And Leyla was no exception.Breathing hard, Matthias reached that conclusion. He felt silly for getting carried away by the ephemeral hankering. Still, he graciously accepted the desire to have her.And now, nothing could stand in his way.He was free to do anything he pleased.The male lead who failed to protect their puppy love had eventually left, and Leyla was abandoned in the forest at the end of their fairytale.Everything in his world had been back to its proper place, in a perfect line, just as he wished.By the time he turned around and began swimming back to the annex, the slanting rays of the setting sun had tinted the sky a warm orange.Matthias\u2019 eyes narrowed at the river\u2019s edge when he saw the familiar, beautiful tree. Ridiculously, there was a woman present, where he casually cast his gaze.Leyla Lewellin.He chanted her name silently like a spell, sending ripples over the water\u2019s surface.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sky was darkening as the sunset descended from its zenith. But Leyla was still there, crying on top of the tree, oblivious of his arrival.Matthias eased to his feet under the tree. The hose wasn\u2019t long before Leyla turned her head and looked at him from the top.She didn\u2019t seem surprised, nor did she try to escape his gaze. She also exhibited no signs of fear or worry either.\u2018why\u2019Matthias soon found the reason: she wasn\u2019t exactly looking at him. Her dim eyes seemed to wander somewhere far away, probably toward the place where the doctor\u2019s son had left.By the time Matthias slanted his lips, Leyla\u2019s eyes had returned to focus. Her green eyes soon filled with a sense of shame. Her shoulders sucked in, and her face became stiff. She was back to the Leyla Lewellin that he knew.Matthias casually peered at her teary eyes with his arms folded. He had a leisurely evening and wasn\u2019t bound by any schedule, so Matthias had plenty of time to wait for her to stop weeping.He saw Leyla\u2019s eyes flashed with contempt when he had no intention of leaving, but her scathing arrogance only made him giggle.\u201cYou know, Leyla. That boy is not coming.\u201dMatthias took a step closer to the tree in which she was sitting.\u201cKyle Etman. The boy you\u2019re waiting for. Ah! Should I now call him\u00a0the one who left you?\u201dHis lips smiled up at her. His tone was gentle and calm, though the sting in his words hadn\u2019t dimmed in the slightest.Leyla teared up at hearing those words. The twilight sky above her revealed itself\u2014devoid of the birds that had returned to their nests. Her vision of the gradually swelling landscape soon turned into steamy tears and flowed down her cheeks.Leyla bit her lower lip, she kept silent until the darkness slowly snuffed out her surroundings. She patiently awaited his leave but the wicked Duke was still standing beneath the tree. So Leyla decided to climb down the back of the tree, which was unreachable from his sight. Her head was slightly dizzy from all the crying. It\u2019s fortunate that she didn\u2019t stumble and was able to step on the ground safely.Leaning against the tree, Leyla wiped her tear-stained face with her apron. She spruced up her tangled hair and straightened her posture. Only after that, she looked back, and the duke was still blocking the path to the cottage.After building up some nerve, Leyla approached him one step at a time. She couldn\u2019t care less about her scruffy face as her untamed tears were still sticking on it. As she couldn\u2019t keep her tears hidden, Leyla chose to show it off with confidence.This time she was determined to never again be his plaything.\u201cI apologize for my disrespect. Goodbye then, Duke.\u201dLeyla bowed her back with the greatest politeness from a distance of two steps away. At this point, giving the nobility the courtesy they wanted, has become as easy to her as breathing.\u201cLeyla.\u201dMatthias called out her name the moment she was about to pass by him. Leyla flinched, but her stride went undisturbed.\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dMatthias laughed and turned. But Leyla ignored him and continued ahead as if she were deaf.His brows wrinkled into a scowl at her rudeness that had crossed the line. He was about to stop her when Leyla suddenly collapsed.\u201cArghh..\u201dShe sat slumped on the ground, unable to get up. Her tiny hunched shoulders and frail back trembled intermittently.Matthias scoffed and slowly approached her. Leyla Lewellin, the upright girl whose eyes never lost their boldness despite her tears, was now wailing terribly after taking her nasty fall.Matthias squatted in front of her, bending one knee and picked up her dropped glasses.Still, Leyla didn\u2019t raise her head.The tears that had always entertained him this time no longer did. Matthias now learned what to name this feeling after seeing her crying over the boy named Kyle Etman.Hate\u2026A feeling of emotion he never had.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201dMatthias grabbed her chin. Leyla tried to dodge but was unable to escape his grip.\u201cLet me go!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201dMatthias overlooked her protests and repeated his demand. With just one hand, he was able to tame her fully.Layla threw a flout at him.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be happy to see me cry?\u201dThe dewdrops in her eyes became thicker and hotter as she endured his grip\u2019s humiliation.\u201cSince when did you take an interest in my pleasure?\u201d Matthias sneered at her, who sniffled frantically in front of his nose. \u201cWhy? You don\u2019t like me having fun?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dLeyla shook her gripped face, stubbornly trying to contain her sobs.\u201cWhether or not the Duke likes it, it has nothing to do with me. My tears are not related to you.\u201d\u201cWhat is that Leyla?\u201d Matthias tilted his head. \u201cIt does have something to do with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo, don\u2019t cry.\u201dOver again. Matthias\u2019s gentle look held her a moment longer. Leyla was stunned, and she groused.\u201cDo I need your permission to cry?\u201d\u201cPerhaps?\u201d\u201cWhy should I? You have no right to do so.\u201d\u201cI have no right\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t own me just because you\u2019re the owner of Arvis!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dAfter a quick frown, Matthias\u2019 face soon lit up with excitement.\u201cThen\u2026.shall I have\u00a0you\u00a0now?\u201dEmotion fled his face when his smile disappeared. Leyla cowered at the sight of the face that reminded her of the water\u2019s still, windless surface.\u201cSo that I can be\u00a0your owner.\u201dMatthias fondled her lips with the tip of his finger. Leyla shuddered with dread when his touch rekindled the memories of her odious last summer. Her burning heart, which had been aflutter in sorrow at losing Kyle, seemed to freeze suddenly.\u201c\u2026N-no, I-I don\u2019t want to.\u201dLeyla heaved her body with all her might. She was sick to her core at the sight of herself groveling at the his feet. Matthias then let her go, much like a child who had become bored with his toy and threw it away.Matthias rose first and stood there watching her crawl to her feet under his shadow. Soil dust and tears marred her shape, but not her eyes\u2014the flame had not yet burned out in her irises.\u201cDuke, I really don\u2019t understand you\u2026You already have a fianc\u00e9e but you always do such inexplicable acts\u2026 I hate all of this.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201dMatthias asked back, fiddling with her loose glasses.\u201cWhat does your heart have to do with me?\u201dHis tone was devoid of hostility.\u201cI just want to have you.\u201dHe wanted it; then he had it. His principle was that simple.Matthias von Herhardt wanted Leyla Lewellin. He wanted her, and he would have her. He believed; something could be thrown away only after having that\u00a0\u2018something.\u2019\u00a0And he had to leave her after he had her so that his life would be complete again.Matthias gently put the glasses on Leyla\u2019s dejected face.\u201cGo on.\u201dHe released his hand, and Leyla lost her balance and fell back on the spot.Matthias stood peering down on her for a while before he left the riverside to continue his stroll.Leyla stayed there alone for a long time, even after he was no longer seen.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cLeyla! Leyla! Come here and look at this!\u201dBill Remmer greeted Leyla excitedly after she returned to the cabin.Leyla approached Bill merrily as he sat on the porch. She knew she couldn\u2019t deceive her uncle with such a sloppy laugh, but she didn\u2019t want to show him her stupid weeping face.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, uncle?\u201d\u201cA telegram arrived. It\u2019s for you.\u201d\u201cTelegram?\u201dLeyla was puzzled when Bill gave her the telegram. It was a letter of notice about job openings for teaching positions at a rural school not far from Arvis estate. Beginning from the next semester, she would be able to work at the school rather than commute to a neighboring city.\u201cIt\u2019s weird. They said that there were no more openings at Carlsbar\u2026\u201dThe good news left her confused. Bill raised his hands and softly patted her head.\u201cIt\u2019s so hard for me to send you far away, Leyla, but I\u2019m glad this kind of luck came in.\u201dLooking at Bill\u2019s relief-filled gaze, Leyla giggled as she nodded. She could come every weekend to visit her beloved uncle despite her work in a nearby city. However, her heart was uneasy whenever she left Uncle Bill at the cottage alone.But\u2026Leyla was unable to savor her bliss once the Duke\u2019s visage loomed in her thoughts. She was grateful she didn\u2019t have to part from Uncle Bill. But on the other hand, she loathed living under the same roof as the Duke.What a stupid thought.\u201cLeyla, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dBill seemed worried, and Leyla realized her face appeared glum.\u201cNo. It\u2019s nothing.\u201dA rim of brilliant moonlight shone over her smiling face.\u201cIt\u2019s like a fluke, so I\u2019m a bit shocked.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dShe twinkled, and her smile lit up a little more.\u201cUncle, aren\u2019t you hungry? Let\u2019s have a nice dinner.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The draping curtains in the bedroom, which partially obscured the open window, swelled up in the night air before repeatedly sinking.Inside the room, the tinkling piano tune played the transition of a music piece. The tapping chords flowed mellifluously, creating an extremely delicate and flashy symphony yet, to some extent, sounding depressed.Matthias reclined on a chair near the window, tin scissors and a handkerchief in his hands. when he clicked his finger, the canary swooped down and perched on his hand. He learned that canaries, like people, could improve their singing by being trained often.His lips rose into a smile when the bird was humming in tune with the piano being played. The canary wiggled its little body covered in soft feathers and cocked its head as if in deep study.Matthias gently wrapped the bird with the handkerchief he had brought after the singing had stopped.Knowing that the bird would be frightened of the person who cut its wings, the zookeeper always covered the birds\u2019 eyes before trimming their wings. After entrusting the job to the zookeeper for so long, Matthias could now easily trim it overgrown feathers.The first few times he cut its wing too short, the bird bled. It wasn\u2019t severely injured, but seeing its golden wings splattered with blood wasn\u2019t a pleasant sight. Matthias disliked it, so he grew more circumspect.Matthias skillfully spread out and clasped the branches of the bird that trusted him. He grabbed the scissors from his lap after deciding which feathers were to be clipped. Strand by strand, the feathers were strewn along the slashed area. The plumages fluttered in accord and fell on his perfectly polished shoes.Matthias then rolled up the handkerchief that had been shielding the bird\u2019s eyes after he had done cutting off the last wings. The canary flapped its wing several times before sitting on his finger.The canary began to sing again as if nothing had happened.It was a beautiful song.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leyla! what are you doing up there!\u201dA high-pitched screech from below the tree nearly made Leyla drop her half-bitten apple.She snatched the fruit before it fell. Mrs. Mona appeared in her sight as she lowered her gaze. She was glaring at Leyla with her arms firmly crossed.\u201cHello, Mrs. Mona. Isn\u2019t the weather really nice today?\u201d.After a simple greeting, Leyla hurriedly stuffed the apples and books into her bag. Mrs. Mona\u2019s brow knitted as she watched Leyla fluidly glide down the tree trunk. At the same time, Bill Remmer returned to the cottage.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of you, Mr. Remmer!\u201dMrs. Mona growled at Bill Remmer moments after he ditched his cart.\u201cI warned you to raise her like a modest lady! I\u2019ve advised you many times, with my experience of raising three daughters, and yet you consistently ignore what I say! Take a look at her now!? A grown lady and a teacher who\u2019s supposed to educate children, climbed a tree like that!\u201d\u201cIs there a rule that school teachers can\u2019t climb trees? A good teacher should be capable of doing everything!\u201dBewildered by the matter, Bill raised his voice and was ready to debate her. Ever since Leyla\u2019s stay in Arvis, the pair\u2019s parenting styles had never been in agreement.Leyla wanted to say that she was now a grownup, instead, she wittily approached her uncle.\u201cLook at her! It\u2019s all your fault! You should\u2019ve gotten rid of her bad tomboy habits by at least spanking her ass when she was a child!\u201dMrs. Mona\u2019s ghoulish grumble made Leyla gasp and impulsively caressed her bottom. Bill and Leyla both had their feet freeze in place, as if they were being punished for making a mistake.After a few minutes of nagging, Mrs. Mona suddenly remembered her original reason for being there and handed a basket of food to them before leaving. Bill and Leyla met eyes and exchanged guffaws.\u201cI feel like her scold has smacked me in the butt.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t handle this anymore, Leyla. You\u2019ll have to climb trees secretly from now on. Don\u2019t get caught by her. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll become deaf if I hear her blaring voice.\u201d\u201cOkay uncle, I\u2019ll do that for you.\u201dAfter nodding, Leyla picked up the heavy basket and sauntered into the home. The old sling bag on her shoulder shook, making a clattering sound as it moved in time with her steps.\u201cAnyway, that junk bag needs to be burned soon.\u201dBill tutted as he gazed at the crap bag, which she refused to throw away.His worries didn\u2019t seem to have a bearing on Leyla\u2019s everyday life; she lived gallantly. After the new school semester started, she began teaching the children as a new primary school teacher. She was sometimes careless and couldn\u2019t avoid making a mistake, but she quickly overcame them.School seemed to have gotten pretty interesting for her lately. Bill, who had been worried if she could do well in teaching the child, could now relax. But he was keenly aware of Leyla\u2019s pain and sadness that she was hiding in the depths of her heart.She was a child who could hardly throw away the worn bag because of her attachment to it. He knew what Kyle meant to her better than anybody else. It was hard for her to mend her wounds from losing Kyle. He was her closest friend, before he became an innocent lover so fast. She was much too frail to be able to heal herself.\u2018It\u2019s not time yet.\u2019After a long thought, Bill shoved Kyle\u2019s letter back into his pocket.Even after moving to Ratz, Kyle sent a letter to Leyla once a week. Bill had explicitly asked to deliver the letter to only him. The postman had understood his intentions, and willingly complied with his request.Bill knew he was cruel, and his cowardice didn\u2019t represent an adult\u2019s attitude. But, his need to protect Leyla trumped his regret and guilt over that boy.\u201cUncle!\u201dLeyla waved at him, and Bill came to her.They sat next to each other on the porch and shared an apple while enjoying the cool weather as the forest was resplendent in the colors of autumn.\u201cOh, I forgot. I have something to say to the butler. Uncle, would you please relay my message to him?\u201d\u201cButler? Do you mean, Mr.Hessen?\u201d\u201cYes. Because of school work.\u201dLeyla wiped the juice drop on her fingers with the handkerchief she took out from her apron.\u201cI\u2019d like to ask the Duke if the children can have an autumn picnic in the Arvis forest.\u201d\u201cAh that\u2019s right, you must tell Hessen first, since you cannot directly approach the Duke. Sure. I\u2019ll ask instead of you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a bit worried if it\u2019s a discourteous request.\u201d\u201cDiscourteous? Don\u2019t worry; the Duke is notoriously generous with such things, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll gladly allow it. Besides, Duke Herhardt is a sponsor of the school.\u201d\u201cSponsor?\u201d Leyla\u2019s eyes grew three sizes. \u201cDuke Herhardt is the sponsor of my school?\u201d A look of shock crossed her face.Bill nodded, \u201cDid you not know that yet? Duke Herhardt funds virtually almost all schools in this district.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dLeyla muttered a little. She clamped her eyes shut, wanting to block off the Duke\u2019s face from her thoughts.Duke Herhardt\u2019s name followed her wherever she went in Carlsbar, and Leyla was bound to accept that unavoidable reality.The King of Carlsbar.That was the moniker bestowed to Duke Herhardt by the citizens of this city. An imperial nobility on a par with the emperor\u2019s family in terms of wealth and power. He served both as a symbol and a source of pride for Carlsbar society.\u201cWhy? Is there a problem with the Duke? Did his haughty fiancee bother you again?\u201dLayla shook her head, taken aback by Bill\u2019s question. \u201cNo. How could that be?\u201dOnce again, the Duke\u2019s face, his stare, and their suffocating moments sequentially seared into her memory, robbing her of her speech.\u201cLet\u2019s have a cup of tea, uncle.\u201dLeyla stood up and fled to the kitchen before Bill could answer. She poured the tea into the cup and placed the cake from Mrs. Mona on the serving plate after slicing it.The daytime was winding down, and the night was creeping into the house. But Leyla hesitated to switch on the light as if she wanted to conceal her wariness in the dark.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*There was no need to rush.Matthias\u2019 opinion of Leyla Lewellin was as follows. He had a burning urge to have her, but he didn\u2019t want to jump the gun.\u201cOh, Miss Lewellin is over there.\u201dMark Evers giggled when he spotted Leyla marching down the Platanus road with her students. After Leyla established herself as a decent grownup and schoolteacher, Arvis residents started addressing her as \u2018Miss Lewellin.\u2019The driver chipped in. \u201cToday must be their picnic day.\u201dHis grandmother granted the children from the local school to have an autumn picnic in Arvis forest. His mother gave a cool nod to the idea as well. In essence, such consent came under the hostess\u2019s purview, which explained why Matthias raised no objections and respected their decision.The excited students surrounding her reminded Matthias of the first time Leyla came to Arvis. She was still a child at heart who loved roaming the forest, who knew she could act so maturely in front of her students.A smile crept on Matthias\u2019 lips as he gazed from the car window. In the following moments, his car passed by Leyla and the children. But her afterimage clung onto his thoughts for quite some time after that.These days, toying around with Leyla Lewellin had been his favorite pastime.The more severe he bullied her, the more vivid her reactions became. Her emotions didn\u2019t stray from embarrassment, anger, shame, and fear, but he savored every change in her emotions. Watching her flinch, get enraged, and speak back to him was much more entertaining than seeing her docile face with a polite smile.Last weekend, they bump into each other in the mansion\u2019s glasshouse. She was helping her uncle in tidying up the flowerbed when she saw him. The color quickly drained from her face. Leyla dropped her garden basket, and the soil-stained tubers were strewn over the paving stone. Bill Remmer, a few feet away, was busy tending to another flowerbed and didn\u2019t seem to notice the fuss.He calmly approached and stood in front of her. When he stomped on the tubers with his shoes, Leyla raised her head in a fit of fury. She looked nervous if anybody saw them, but her eyes were filled with an uncontrollable hatred.Matthias chuckled, remembering how the people regarded Leyla Lewellin as a kind and gentle lady who never spoke ill of anybody. However, it didn\u2019t stop him from being satisfied. As he had never learned to share his things with others, he was elated when Leyla acted sharp-tempered just to him.The majestic birds living in the Arvis\u2019 heavenly greenhouse made a loud chirp. Leyla quickly scooped up the tubers as if she didn\u2019t want him to touch them, and then stood up.As she bowed and was about to run, he tripped over her leg. The basket in her hands toppled, and the tubers were scattered again on the paving stones. Leyla stumbled, but he had already hugged her waist to save her from falling.Matthias recalled how frightened Leyla was and how she quickly covered her mouth to prevent a scream. Even though the flowering season had withered away, he could still taste the faint scent of roses wafting from her skin.After letting her go, he took a step back and pointed to the falling tubers with his gaze. Leyla scowled, loathing visible in her eyes, but she had no option but to follow with his demand.Gnashing her teeth, she knelt to collect the tubers. When he kicked some tubers with the tip of his shoe towards her, a blush of heat bloomed on her cheeks.Its crimson color beautified her skin tone perfectly.Matthias wondered how beautiful it would be if he could paint her whole body with that hue. A lovely shade of red.\u00a0The color of him.\u201cWhat\u2019s my afternoon schedule?\u201dMatthias queried when their car moved closer to the city center.\u201cToday\u2019s last schedule is to attend the board of directors meeting.\u201dMatthias gave a satisfied nod and checked his wristwatch. He\u2019d be able to return home earlier this afternoon.After getting out of the car, he took a moment to admire the cloudless high blue sky. The late-afternoon sun bathed the buildings in its warm light and the wind kept everything crisp.The weather was perfect to enjoy autumn picnic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s not like our teacher at all!\u201dA little girl\u2014smaller than the boy whimpered and other children who huddled behind Leyla, reacted identically: their eyes opened wide with fear as soon as Bill Remmer appeared in front of them.Bill was quite blas\u00e9 at their not-so-extraordinary reaction. He disliked rowdy children, but Leyla had especially begged him to spare his time to guide the children who came for a picnic in the Arvis\u2019 forest for a day. But he already felt that this wasn\u2019t an easy job.\u201cKids, Uncle Bill is a good person.\u201dLeyla smiled as she comforted her students. The timid little girl from a while ago again burst into tears after Bill showed his toothy grin.\u201cFuck! I don\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle!\u201dLeyla quickly hushed up Bill\u2019s violent cursing and knelt in front of the sobbing child. Unable to smile or frown, Bill could only stare at the tiny creatures with a quizzical face.\u201cUncle Bill is a very nice man and he will take us around the forest today.\u201dThe sniffling child in her arms stopped weeping, and Leyla continued her praiseworthy explanation.\u201cWe\u2019re going to study flowers and trees in the forest with Uncle Bill. Won\u2019t it be fun?\u201dThe children seemed to disagree with their teacher\u2019s words, but they grudgingly nodded in tandem.\u2018What a bunch of whiny!\u2019Bill scratched his head and began to lead the way. Leyla and the children were quick to follow his suit.\u201cCome to think of it, I think you were around the same age as those children when I first met you.\u201dBill\u2019s stiff lips softened when a flashback of memory flooded his thoughts.\u201cUh, Uncle. These kids are all under the age of ten.\u201d countered Leyla, with a frown on her face. \u201cI was 11 years old at the time, about to become 12.\u201dBill was joking when he said that, but Leyla took it seriously and she retorted by telling her age like the way she did the first time she came to Arvis.\u201cHe.. he.. he..\u201dBill chuckled, remembering that day. Leyla, his little girl who had always disliked being labelled \u2018small\u2019, now had grown up into a beautiful lady.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was a little past 1 o\u2019clock when Matthias returned to the Estate.The car made its way through the mansion and headed to the riverfront annex. The driver and his aide were baffled at first by his surprising order, but soon understood when they recalled that it was a picnic day for the rural school children. This kind of charity event was primarily the duty of the hostess, but there was no reason to exclude the Duke from participating.A gleam of bright sunlight bounced off the tree and caught the shrubs in its beams as the car drove through the forest to the riverside. The splendour of the forest coloured with reds and oranges and the pristine river sparkling with luminous water scales became a natural fence that encircled both sides of the road.Arvis was a place that offered picturesque vistas all year round, but the period with the most splendid beauty by far was the autumn season.Matthias stared at the scenic view which passed like a movie scene with an odd feeling.Arvis, as he knew it, was either a verdant summer or a placid snowy winter. In the spring of his twelfth year, he inherited the title of Duke after the death of his father. And the next summer, he enrolled at a school in the capital. From then on, he spent the spring and autumn in Ratz and the summer and winter in Carlsbar, leading a life divided between the two cities.\u201cDuke, it\u2019s been a while since you spent the autumn at Carlsbar, hasn\u2019t it?\u201dThe driver who was watching Matthias as he gazed out the window, carefully asked.\u201cYes, that\u2019s true.\u201dMatthias nodded with an autumnal smile as he recalled his eleven-year-old autumn memory. A very long time had passed, but his life seemed scarcely different between then, and now.He was reared as the family\u2019s heir from his birth and was groomed to succeed his father as the Duke of Herhardt. It was a life mapped out in advance; only his turn had come sooner than planned. And the same circle would apply to Herhardt\u2019s future heir, whom he and Claudine would have. As was his life, which paralleled his father\u2019s.Matthias drew his gaze from the car window where the unfamiliar autumn landscape was unfolding. The car shortly came to a stop at the annex\u2019s pier. When the driver opened the backseat door, he was greeted by the children\u2019s laughter and chit-chat.After getting out of the car, Matthias looked in the direction of the sound. The little children he had seen this morning were merrily strolling along the riverbank. The gardener was following them, and\u2026.. Leyla. Her radiant smile resembled the fall sunshine.They met each other\u2019s eyes the moment she turned her head away from the children. She was dressed in a wide lace collared top and a maple-red skirt. Her teacher outfit looked great, but everything else about her was clunky.Matthias buttoned up his suit and walked into the autumn sun.\u201cOh. Is that Duke Herhardt?\u201dMrs. Grever asked, taken aback while staring at Matthias approaching them. She was a mother of two and the upper class\u2019s homeroom teacher.\u201cOh my god, this is my first time seeing him this close! He\u2019s even more handsome in person than the picture in the newspaper!\u201dShe muttered in a lively tone, not giving Leyla a chance to answer.Mrs. Grever\u2019s jovial reaction made Leyla realize Duke Herhardt\u2019s notable reputation. The citizens admired and respected him, whose face was often featured in publications. But in her eyes, Matthias Von Herhardt was nothing more than a psychopath.\u201cBy the way, Miss Lewellin\u2026.\u201dMrs. Grever was about to speak when Matthias stood in front of them.\u201cHello, Duke.\u201dBill, who was busy bickering with the children, hurriedly approached them and greeted him which also made Mrs. Grever join in. Still soured by his jerk behaviour last weekend, Leyla belatedly bowed her head.\u2018Damn it! I should have thrown those tubers at him!\u201dShe walked home from the greenhouse that day with terrible feelings. Even if she could rewind time, she wouldn\u2019t dare to commit such impudence~ That\u2019s what she had to tell herself to quell her frustration\u201cWould you like to introduce this person to me, Miss Lewellin?\u201dMatthias asked her nicely as Leyla had lifted her head. His gentlemanly regal and courteous manners astounded her. He seemed to be a totally different person.\u2018Others\u2019 impressions of Duke Herhardt will always be like this.\u2019That insight amazed her.\u201cLe\u2026 Leyla?\u201dThe confused Bill patted her on the back.\u201cHmm? Ah\u2026 Yes, Duke.\u201dLeyla apace came to her senses and took a perfect stance, clasping her hands beneath her navel. She decided not to lose her temper because she failed to throw the tubers at him. She set out to prove to the Duke that she had polished herself into a decent adult, no longer like a forest child he could just pester around at whim.Leyla introduced Mrs. Grever to him in a professional manner. She also patiently explained to the wondering children who Duke of Herhardt was. Leyla decided to go along with her children\u2019s adoration of him, even if she couldn\u2019t agree with most of what they said. If she had to tell the truth about what a terrible person he was, she would have to use offensive words that no child should ever hear.\u201cThank you so much for allowing us to have an autumn picnic, Duke.\u201dLeyla stood confidently before him, with her shoulders straightened and chin slightly up, proud of her performance.\u201cThanks to you, the children are having a great time.\u201dShe also gave a soft emphasis on the term \u2018children\u2019 to underline her position as a teacher.\u201cReally?\u201dMatthias\u2019 lips rose slightly as she spoke.\u201cThe one who is having a good time seems to be Miss Lewellin.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Pardon?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dMatthias stayed quiet at her question. He did little more than snicker at her boggling expression and greeted Mrs. Grever and the kids\u2019 goodbye with his gentlemanly persona that was able to mask his twisted personality.Matthias, his aide, and the driver then reversed and left the scene. Leyla stood silently watching their backs as they approached the riverfront annex. She did lose her understanding of his words until Mrs. Grever gave her the answer.\u201cUm\u2026 Miss Lewellin\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYour head\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dA little coy, Mrs. Grever pointed over her head.\u201cHead? What\u2019s wrong with my head\u2026.\u201dLeyla\u2019s bewildered face creased in a tick as she felt the soft touch of flowers and grass leaves on her head.Flower crown!There was a flower crown adorning her head. Monica, her youngest and closest student, had put the wildflower wreath she\u2019d fashioned as Uncle Bill had taught her.Mrs. Grever felt awful for not telling her. \u201cI was about to tell you, but Duke Herhardt suddenly came.\u201dLeyla was stone-faced. She was unable to speak and just blinked.\u2018So I pretended to act like an adult while wearing this.\u2019A rush of shame overtook her. She almost yelled out the curse words Uncle Bill often used if it weren\u2019t for the children.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, teacher.\u201dMonica, the child who gave Leyla the flower crown, cheered her on lovingly.\u201cYou look pretty! Like a princess.\u201dThe other children agreed with Monica and nodded their heads together.Ha.. Ha.. HaLeyla seemed to know too well why Uncle Bill was laughing so wildly. If one could die of shame, she was willing to fall deeply asleep on this beautiful autumn day.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d Bill delightedly patted her back. \u201cIt was just a little embarrassing, but it\u2019s not like you committed a crime or anything like that.\u201dAt his words that weren\u2019t comforting at all, Leyla\u2019s cheeks bloomed crimson as a ripened apple. Then, out of the blue, an even more shockingly bad ordeal befell her.\u201cMr. Remmer! Miss Lewellin!\u201dMark Evers, who had left with the Duke earlier, returned with a sprightly smile.\u201cThe Duke has invited the picnicking children to his annex. He wants to have tea with everyone. Of course, together with the two teachers and you too, Mr. Remmer.\u201d\u201cWoaaaaaaaa!\u201dThe frenzied child\u2019s cheering could be heard echoing through the forest. Mrs. Grever\u2019s jaw hung open, and Bill didn\u2019t seem to dislike the Duke\u2019s invitation.In everyone\u2019s thrills, Leyla looked blankly up into the sky, grabbing the flower that crowned her head.She knew shame couldn\u2019t kill a person, but she prayed at least it could knock her out.Leyla earnestly begged, yet her mind was as clear as the dazzling blue of an autumn\u2019s sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their eyes twinkled with delight as they looked around the house but couldn\u2019t dare to make jokes and fool around like before.Leyla had to appease the frightened Monica first, so she was the last to enter the annex, and the servants welcomed the Duke\u2019s young guest with the same servility they gave to the VIP guests.\u201cThis way, please.\u201dOne of the servants promptly escorted the waiting children from the guest lounge to the living room. Inside, Matthias was sitting there with his back against the window overlooking the river\u2014he had been waiting for them to arrive.Leyla held her breath as she walked into the place riddled with horrible, embarrassing, and humiliating memories.\u201cThank you so much for your kindness in allowing us to visit Arvis, Duke.\u201dMrs. Grever was effusive in her thanks, and her vivacity put Leyla at ease. She hoped her-teacher-friend would take the role as the Duke\u2019s converser, so she could sit quietly like the room\u2019s furniture and leave the place when the pleasantries were over.\u201cRather, I should be thankful to all of you for accepting my sudden invitation.\u201dMatthias welcomed them as he rose from his seat. The window\u2019s backlight cast a shadow over his face, but it amplified the sense of his presence.\u201cTeacher\u2026 it hurts.\u201dMonica\u2019s whispers startled Leyla, who was staring blankly at his silhouette.\u201cMy hand hurts.\u201dMonica moaned in pain. Leyla\u2019s eyes widened as she realized she was gripping the child\u2019s hand too tightly.\u201cAh, sorry. I\u2019m so sorry, Monica.\u201dShe massaged Monica\u2019s wrist in a panic, and at the time, the door flew open to the balcony facing the riverside.The scent of fresh water was wafting from the opened door. Leyla swiveled\u00a0to face the view. A sumptuous tea table which was set up in the sun-drenched terrace and the white tablecloth that gently swayed along with the wind, captured her eyes in a blink.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dMatthias\u2019 gaze flew from Leyla to Mrs. Grever. The teacher accepted his escort by lightly placing her hand on his arm with her blushing cheeks.The astonished children who had never had a tea-time of this kind, happily followed the Duke with a zealous expression on their face. Leyla walked with Monica in tow and was the last to head to the balcony.\u201cWoah, Teacher! I feel like I\u2019m becoming a princess!\u201dAs she walked onto the balcony, Monica rolled her eyes, and her innocent face glowed with adoration. Leyla couldn\u2019t debate the child\u2019s praises, as the vibrantly colored assortment of bites that was served on the balcony\u2019s table looked quite appetizing. It was amazing to think about how promptly they had everything ready.She caught sight of the bouquet of Baby breath flowers, and red asters gracing the table\u2019s centrepiece. There were teacups and exquisite silverware on the table, much too many for the rural schoolchildren. And the scenic beauty of Schulter River beyond the railing was the perfect setting for their afternoon meals.A beam of sunlight hit her slender glasses frame and shattered like shrapnel. Matthias\u2019s eyes wandered throughout those shards of light\u2026The jewel-blue flowing river\u2026.the daughter of the sky\u2014Bright white sun\u2026And\u2026.The sea of trees,\u00a0 beneath a garland of scarlets and golds.In the autumn moment of Arvis, where all the beautiful colors of nature were at their most vivid,Their eyes met\u2026.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Monica was delighted over the moon. She roistered endlessly at how pretty the annex was, of how handsome the duke was, and the tasty cake she had eaten. That child couldn\u2019t stop herself from extolling everything.\u201cWoaaa!\u201dThis time, that child was hooked on by the scoop of ice cream. Her eyes sparkled at the ice cream dish, and she hurriedly reached out her hand to Leyla sitting beside her.Leyla gave a surprised look, and Monica whispered,\u201cTeacher, it tastes like clouds.\u201dLeyla blinked a few times before catching on to what the child was trying to say. With a smile, she took a napkin and gently wiped Monica\u2019s lips to clean the ice cream smudge on her lips.Monica had just started school this year. She was physically smaller than her peers, a scaredy-cat, and still a shy girl. Her introverted nature made it difficult for her to socialize with other children. She used to cry, wanting to go back home every day. And for the first few weeks, Leyla had an uphill struggle to cope with that child.But now, she was Leyla\u2019s best disciple among her classmates. After learning that Monica\u2019s mother died from an illness last spring, Leyla had a deeper understanding of the child\u2019s heart.\u201cTeacher, you should try it too.\u201d\u201cNo, Monica. Teacher is fine.\u201dLeyla scrupled for a moment. But she maturely refused. Albeit, there was no law prohibiting adults from eating ice cream, she didn\u2019t want to seem childish in front of the Duke by eating the ice cream that was prepared for the children only.Leyla took another sip of the half-cold tea as she eavesdropped on the ongoing table talk. Mrs. Grever was leading the conversation with a bubbly attitude, just as she wished.Meanwhile, ridding her mind of its load, Leyla threw a glance at Matthias, who sat at the head chair. He was listening attentively to Mrs. Grever. His brief replies and smile presented impeccable courtesy. Strangely enough, by displaying such a perfect turn, the other people could sense his dominance and classiness in the relationship. All of his gestures were haughty but graceful at the same time.Like a researcher, she observed Matthias intently when Monica suddenly stood up and approached her with a bowl of ice cream.\u201cTeacher\u2026 teacher! This ice cream is so delicious. Please try it?\u201dWhen her tiny hand was tugging her sleeve, Leyla flinched and pulled back. Monica dropped the ice cream bowl and it splattered all over her skirt. The loud fuss drew the attention of everyone seated at the table to her.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry teacher!\u201dMonica blanched when the bowl fell to the hardwood floor, covering her teacher\u2019s skirt with ice cream. Tears slowly crept out of her eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t cry, teacher is fine.\u201dLeyla smiled and quickly wiped the ice cream with the napkin to soothe the child. Meanwhile, the maids reached them quickly and rushed to wipe the wet floor.Leyla was flustered after taking a look at her sticky hands and stained skirt. Seeing that, Matthias gestured at the maid standing close to her and she hurriedly ushered Leyla into the powder room.Monica was about to burst into tears when Leyla left the terrace, but luckily Bill Remmer calmed her down. At the same time, Mark Evers discreetly approached.\u201cDuke, Count Klein wants to have a call with you.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The more she rubbed it, the larger and more stubborn the ice cream stain became on her skirt.Leyla gave up and just washed her hands and face. By luck, she was wearing a dark-colored kilt, which helped a lot in hiding the stain.She carefully turned off the sink\u2019s gold faucet and checked her reflection in the mirror. Her cheeks were blushing red from a fruitless effort to remove ice cream stains off her skirt.She tidied her droopy hair and took a breath before leaving the powder room. It wasn\u2019t long before she tensed up again, a heavy feeling in her stomach as she saw the Duke leaning against the hallway wall leading to the living room. Matthias looked at her, smiling when she gasped.\u2018Damn.\u2019A frown appeared on her face, and she looked around. There was no one else here, and her mind whirled, alarmed of what could happen next.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s been waiting for me\u2026.\u2019After several minutes had passed, he remained standing there, nonchalantly staring at her. A sneer sneaked out the corner of his lips, a satirical grin that those who lauded him as a faultless aristocrat would never know. And every time he cracked a smile like that, Leyla knew something bad was going to happen to her.Ominous hunch overwhelmed her. She gulped, her shaking hands clenched, waiting for him to get out of the way. But Leyla decided not to waste time that would cause an unnecessary misunderstanding.Without letting go of her guard, she took a watchful stride forward. Matthias, still leaning against the wall, kept his eyes intact on her. And once she got closer, he blatantly stood in the middle of the corridor.Seeing her flinch in fear and step back from him, Matthias\u2019 chuckle grew louder.After a short phone call from Count Klein, without a particular reason, he went in the opposite direction instead of going back to the balcony. He simply had the urge to wait for her since she hadn\u2019t yet returned. Just in case something interesting happened to her. Exactly just like right now.Leyla approached him with a straight face, as if marching to a battlefield. She intended to avoid him, but the hallway was incapacious.As she walked right next to him, Matthias slightly stuck out his leg. Leyla reflexively backed off.\u2018Dodged it!\u2019But her joy soon turned into shame when he just pretended to move to change his posture. She now looked like an idiot-jumping rabbit in front of the upright and elegant Duke.Matthias snickered and took a spin around as if nothing had happened. Alone in the hall, Leyla stayed still until he entered the living room and was no longer in her sight.A liar\u2014She would undoubtedly be labelled as such if she told everyone about Duke Herhardt\u2019s absurd personality.\u2018No.\u2019Leyla tossed aside the thought and walked into the living room. Upon reaching the balcony, she saw him acting normal, like a model gentleman. He had a warm conversation with Mrs. Grever, and a smile never left his face.\u201cOh, welcome back, Miss Lewellin!\u201dMrs. Grever was pleased when she came back.\u201cLet\u2019s go boating!\u201d\u201cBoating?\u201d\u201cThe Duke said he\u2019d lend our kids his yacht. Isn\u2019t it wonderful to have a boat ride in that beautiful river?\u201d\u201cUhm\u2026 But I\u2026.\u201dLeyla shot her uncle a worried gaze, and Bill stepped forward.\u201cMy apologies, Duke, but Leyla is very afraid of water. It\u2019ll be hard for her to get on the boat.\u201d\u201cAh. I see.\u201dMatthias pretended to be saddened by the story, although he had seen her drowning in the same river a year ago.\u201cThen Ms. Lewellin, you can take a rest here.\u201d\u2018He\u2026 Why is he showing such consideration now?\u2019While his unexpected concern perplexed her, the children bolted off the balcony, accompanied by the Duke\u2019s servant.\u201cYes, Miss Lewellin. I\u2019ll go, so you can stay here.\u201d\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry Leyla. I\u2019ll take care of those little ones.\u201dBill smiled and took Monica\u2019s hand from Leyla\u2019s. That child was scared and wanted to weep every time she saw Bill, but she was willing to follow him out of the blue.\u201cThank you, Mr. Grever and Uncle Bill too.\u201dLeyla felt embarrassed but thanked them for their kindness. They were nice people, unlike the enigmatic Duke. Apart from that, she also felt lucky to be able to stay away from the Duke.However, as she waited, Matthias didn\u2019t get up from his chair.She gave him a confused look.Matthias remained in his seat even after everyone had left. She then realized that the Duke canoeing with the village kids would be odder.Realizing that she had made a grave choice, Leyla leapt from her seat. The two boats carrying the children had already departed the bottom floor\u2019s boat hangar and headed towards the river. The servants were tirelessly rowing while Uncle Bill and Mrs. Grever kept an eye on the children in separate boats.\u201cTeacher! Teacher! Teacher!\u201dThe children laughed and waved their hand at her, who was standing beyond the railing.\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll be back!\u201dEven the timid Monica grinned with excitement.She could no longer catch up with the children. She was engrossed in her despair when a voice as cold as a river wind, suddenly broke the silence.\u201cSit down.\u201dLeyla jerked back. Matthias was looking at her with his legs crossed.\u201cLeyla.\u201dHe smiled, calling her name as if he was humming along to the tune.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One of its legs was tied with a red thread. It was unmistakably her carrier bird, Phoebe.\u201cWhy did you fly here?\u201dShe went up to the railing where Phoebe was resting.Phoebe\u2019s role as a letter-deliverer came to an end with Kyle\u2019s departure. These days, the bird has become her cherished pet. When the Duke went out for upland hunting, she always confined Phoebe in a cage. But, on the other days, that pigeon roamed freely around the Arvis forest.\u201cYou can\u2019t come here. Here is\u2026 .\u201dLeyla darted a wary look towards the Duke. They met eyes as his gaze swiveled from the children\u2019s boat to her.\u201cPhoebe?\u201dHis mention of Phoebe made her flinch.\u201cSo the bird\u2019s name is Phoebe?\u201d\u201cDo you know Phoebe?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Matthias tilted his head. \u201cJust ask the pigeon.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you claim you understood the bird\u2019s mind.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dLeyla was tight-lipped, unable to say anything more than a grimace. Matthias felt quite satisfied upon seeing her bite her lips because she couldn\u2019t debate him.With her back fully turned, Leyla whispered a few more words to her bird as if they could communicate with each other, but Matthias was certain she was mocking him without needing to hear her mutter.Phoebe began gliding towards the other bank of the river. After the bird was out of her sight, Leyla returned to her chair with a sense of alertness. She looked at Matthias with some trepidation before deciding to speak.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Duke.\u201dShe abruptly uttered words out of context.\u201cI apologize in Phoebe\u2019s stead for recklessly entering your annex and leaving.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll apologize in the bird\u2019s stead?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Leyla gravely replied to his scoff. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it came here, but I\u2019ll train it to make sure that this never happens again. So\u2026 so\u2026 Duke.\u201dShe began to sweat; her fear was audible.\u201cPlease \u2026..Please don\u2019t shoot Phoebe.\u201dOnly fear remained deep in her eyes as all her bewilderment and curiosity dwindled. Matthias kept mum, his crooked smirk on his lips seeming to fade as he stared into hers.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026\u201dAs his silence prolonged, her tone was heavily laden with desperation.\u201cOf course, I know you are Arvis\u2019s owner, but Phoebe\u2026.\u201dLeyla kept pleading though her pride was in pain. She was ready to beg once again but a servant appeared in front of them, pushing her to clamp her trembling lips.Matthias left the balcony after the servant informed him he got a phone call from the company\u2019s lawyer. Leyla hardly took her eyes off of him through the window. Her mind was imprinted with the horrors of his countless bird-killings. She couldn\u2019t relax unless he promised that he wouldn\u2019t shoot Phoebe.Matthias returned shortly after.Leyla no longer avoided his eyes like she used to; instead, she stared at him with persistence.\u201cDuke, Phoebe\u2026 .\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested in your bird.\u201dMatthias flatly cut off her vexing pleas. She heaved,\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cA target that doesn\u2019t run away. It\u2019s boring.\u201d\u201cThen are you not going to shoot?\u201dLeyla\u2019s eyes sparkled brighter, revealing hope and optimism. Her piercing gaze put Matthias in exasperation. Ever since Leyla Lewellin set her foot in Arvis, this was the first time they had eye contact that lasted this long.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dMatthias asked back without averting his gaze.He had no intention of hunting the carrier bird in the first place, but he was unwilling to give her a straightforward answer. For the first time he saw her like that: willingly clinging to him in order to beg for something.\u201cI don\u2019t think you will shoot.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because.. You\u2019re a gentleman.\u201d\u2018Pfft\u2026You only call me a gentleman when you\u2019re at a disadvantage.\u2019Matthias let out a vexed laugh at her hasty and brash answer. Leyla hurriedly added onto her words in anxiety.\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the type of person to hunt boring targets.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Leyla nodded along with her praise. \u201cYou\u2019re titled as the greatest marksman and gentleman in Carlsbar, I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t shoot Phoebe.\u201dSeeing her squirming as she talked, Matthias\u2019s laughter suddenly cracked up. The servants behind him exchanged conundrum glances, especially Mark Evers, his long-time assistant\u2014he was the most stunned of the others at the balcony.Not because Duke Herhardt didn\u2019t laugh much. But those in his \u2018immediate vicinity\u2019 knew that his courteous laughs were mostly a display of civility towards others. Even as a little boy, if Mark Evers\u2019 memory served him right, the Duke seldom laughed in a pleasant way.The boats heading downstream now had turned their bows back to the annex. The children\u2019s excited laughter and chatter mingled with his chortle.Leyla seemed eager for a definite answer, but Matthias continued to stay silent. He did nothing more than spectate her as she repeatedly wetted her lips in a panic. And she spoke up first.\u201cUh\u2026.. Duke?\u201dBoth her voice and eyes wavered, but not in a fearful way. Matthias did think her rosy cheeks, flushed with anticipation, were very attractive. Her eyes and delicate poise stated she wasn\u2019t trying to miss even the slightest of his facial expressions and body language.Matthias changed his mind about answering and instead rang the bell. One of the house staff rushed into the living room at his errand and brought out an ashtray and a pack of cigarettes.\u201cDuke\u2026?\u201dLeyla urged him on. She needed an answer.Phoebe was a bird she had been raising from its fledgling age. Beyond everything, that bird was like a symbol of her and Kyle\u2019s beautiful time they had spent together. She didn\u2019t ever want to lose Phoebe, even if those days would never return.Matthias took out a cigarette from the silver case and lighted it up. The thin layer of smoke slowly floated between their deliberate silence. The white puff played in her face. Matthias didn\u2019t dislike her outlook, who only looked at him and begged him. It would be great if this moment could continue to last forever, he thought, quite pathetically.\u2018Well, I should stop here for now.\u2019As he soon nodded his chin, Leyla\u2019s eyes glistened.\u201d Phoebe\u2026.You\u2019re really not going to shoot Phoebe, are you?\u201dHer questioning was very persistent.Matthias turned aside and flickered his cigarette ash. After attentively watching his gesture, Leyla grasped his meaning and retreated without pestering him further.She hardly believed his promise, but there were other servants on the balcony listening, so she felt positive Matthias would keep the promise he made with a lot of eyes watching him. She didn\u2019t know or care about Matthias von Herhardt, yet she had that feeling of trust in him.Leyla finally could sigh with relief and glance out of the railing, to the river beyond. The tranquility of the flowing river reflected the shadow of the forest with its autumnal leaves.Her lips draped in a smile. She had managed to protect Phoebe, as well as her precious memories.Her smile lit up as her relief grew.Matthias\u2019s eyes narrowed at her odd expression.\u00a0\u2018What good is it to guarantee the safety of a pigeon?\u2019He was unable to understand her, yet he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of her face.The cigarette he was holding between his long fingers burned slowly. A sense of unidentifiable annoyance and anxiety rose within the smoke. Both satiety and hunger battled each other to overtake him. The uncomfortable and queer feeling he had was as vivid as the vibrant colours of the season, which dyed the entire world. And as vague as the dream of last night when he opened his eyes.Matthias threw the cigarette in his hand into the ashtray. He was thirsty, perhaps from smoking a cigarette he didn\u2019t enjoy, but instead of taking a glass of water, he took out a new one. The unlit cigarette\u2019s tip loosely wrapped between his fingers slightly shook along with the wind.Leyla turned her head when she felt his stare on her. A smile still lingered on her beaming face, an emotion that shined more vividly than anger and fear, shame and tears could ever have.Matthias was pondering about what that emotion was when Leyla ripped away her smile with haste. She avoided his gaze and bowed deeply. She was only looking down at her fingertips, but Matthias felt quite humiliated at her actions.Humiliation.Leyla Lewellin had taught him the emotion that he now knew for sure.\u2018Look at you now, Leyla\u2019Matthias unknowingly laughed in vain.\u2018Now that you\u2019ve reached your goal, you\u2019re ignoring me again?\u2019He never knew Leyla Lewellin could act this sly. Her attitude was daft, yet it was also pretty cute. But her abrupt mood swings really displeased him.Matthias squeezed his unlit cigarette and tossed it again into the ashtray.After the sunshine-like mirth had disappeared, the terrace was just left in a dark shade.The gloomy place\u2026.he didn\u2019t like it.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The autumn picnic ended when the children were taken to school and safely returned to their homes.Leyla noticed tiredness had strained over her body the entire day. Her muscles were drained which made her sleepy, but she was happy with her first picnic with the children. Ironically, the person she was most worried about, was the key factor to the success of their autumn picnic, Duke Herhardt.\u201cFor the time being, I think Lady Brandt will be the most envied woman in the world.\u201d Mrs. Grever sighed while walking beside Leyla. \u201cShe will have both that handsome gentleman and the whole of Arvis. The world is so unfair at times like this. Do you know when they are getting married?\u201d\u201cI heard it\u2019s around next summer.\u201d\u201cIt will be a grandiose wedding that will stir the whole empire. Ah. I really envy her.\u201dLeyla just gave a moderate smile at Mr. Grever\u2019s overblown admiration.They split ways at a downtown junction. Leyla returned to Arvis after buying an armful of groceries. She was going to cook a delicious dinner for Uncle Bill, who had provided her a great help.\u2018I\u2019m going to make lots of my Uncle\u2019s favourite food.\u2019Impatience drove her steps faster. She started speed walking after entering the road leading to Arvis. But suddenly, her feet froze in the middle of the road when a middle-aged lady came from the opposite side. That woman also simultaneously stopped as she saw Leyla.That person\u2019s eyes was evocative of Kyle, Mrs. Etman..Her hands, holding the grocery bag, turned pale.\u2018What should I do?\u2019Leyla stood frozen in front of her eyes regardless of how hard she thought. It felt weird passing by her like a stranger but even weirder to greet her.After much hesitation, Leyla dipped her head in greeting without uttering a word, and Mrs. Etman accepted it with a silent nod.But as the stifling moment was about to end, Mrs. Etman opened her mouth.\u201cLeyla.\u201dLeyla swiveled in shock.\u201cIt ended up like this, but I really don\u2019t regret it.\u201dMrs. Etman sighed as she stood in front of Leyla. Neither hostility nor guilt contained in her eyes\u2014they were as lifeless as a clump of leaves.\u201cEven if my reputation fell to the ground and my relationship with Kyle turned sour, I still hindered your marriage. That\u2019s all I need.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dPerhaps, Leyla would feel much better if Mrs. Etman\u2019s tone was hostile.Each word Mrs. Etman uttered calmly in a tired voice pierced her heart like a shard of glass.After finishing what she had to say, Mrs. Etman started walking and passed her. The housekeeper, standing at a distance with a flustered face, followed her suit.Leyla hurried her way after giving a silent salute to the housekeeper, who threw a look of consolation and compassion towards her.She walked boldly and with a broad stride, then stopped like a toy with a loose spring.She peered down at her two feet on the ground, stretched her hand, and took a deep breath.\u2018Am I really a human?\u2019A sense of shame entered her thoughts.Leyla slowly opened her closed eyes and started walking towards the cabin where Uncle Bill was waiting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA white dove landed gently on the balcony\u2019s railing.Folding its wing, the bird naturally approached the bird feeder and pecked its food deliciously, doused in the golden light of the fading sun that seeped in between its white feathers.\u201cPhoebe.\u201dMatthias blurted out its name after seeing that bird perched on his window.\u2018Phoebe\u2019\u2014\u2018What a grand name for such a bird.\u2019His sneer at that bird-crazed woman flowed softly like a sigh.Matthias rose from his sofa and opened the balcony door. The river wind near the sunset felt cold and humid, playing in both up tempo gusts and gentle lulls.When he went close, the pigeon continued to eat its feed, undisturbed. That docile bird\u2019s personality contrasted sharply with that of its owner.Softly, the evening came with the sunset while he was leaning against the railing. Matthias closed his eyes so he could hear the wind whispering. Their dulcet tones became a feast for his ears. The gentle rustling sound of the autumn leaves, falling and dancing in the quiet, beautiful forest bloomed like a soothing lullaby.Everywhere he looked, he could only see Leyla in Arvis\u2019s autumn.He watched her diligently go to work by pedalling her bike and returning home with a tired face. In her spare time, she volunteered to do the gardener\u2019s work and sometimes scoured the forest with her big basket to collect mushrooms and wild berries.In his beautiful cage of Arvis, everything he had in this world stayed in its proper place.That perfect world satisfied him. More than enough to erase the disillusionment he tasted last summer after helping Linda Etman stop Kyle and Leyla\u2019s marriage.\u2018Leyla\u2026.she should be where she deserved to be.\u2019As he opened his eyes, Matthias could feel a semblance of satisfaction spreading over his system like a pleasurable intoxication.The stuffed pigeon soon left the balcony and flitted to the cottage, going back to its owner.He believed that the bird would come here again tomorrow and the day after. He had no interest in the bird\u2019s feelings, but he knew well how to tame it.To earn that carrier bird\u2019s heart, he just needed to provide the bird a safe place and let it eat to the fullest.It was a trick he had honed while serving in the military. Soldiers often used carrier pigeons to deliver messages when communication devices were poor, or there was a risk of information being leaked to the enemy. He was currently using the same method the military bird trainers used to tame Phoebe.Leyla\u2019s carrier bird, Phoebe, realized there was no use in flying to Kyle Etman\u2019s tightly shut window. A new food source had appeared, and the place was safe, so unhesitatingly, Phoebe would fly to his annex from now on. That bird was quite clever, unlike its foolish and clumsy owner.Matthias looked at the flying bird and suddenly frowned. His memory slithered back to the autumn picnic day\u2014 when her smile faded to nothingness the moment their eyes met.\u201cBut it\u2019s probably a smile you\u2019ve countlessly shown to the doctor\u2019s son.\u201dThe annex shade that shrouded the balcony became darker when his train of thoughts jumped to that conclusion.Ever since Leyla was a child, never once had she smiled in front of him, nor could she hold back her tears.So \u2026.he made her cry.If he couldn\u2019t make her laugh, he would have made her cry.Whether it was her smile or her tears, he was satisfied with everything about her.If all he could give her were tears, then he would make her shed them.He was also willing to break her heart.\u2018But what if you could give me something else?\u2019These days, Matthias often falls into such a reverie. He no longer wanted to see her being scared or angry at him.He simply wanted her to look only at him. Sometimes humoring him and smiling at him full of overwhelming bliss after he granted her wish.Now\u2026.he knew his desire\u2026Leyla Lewellin\u2026.He lusted for her\u2026All of her\u2026Everything about her\u2026.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYou\u2019ve gained weight, Phoebe.\u201dLeyla tutted as she peered at Phoebe snuggling in her hands. She mistook it for a puff of thick feathers preparing for the winter, but as she got a closer look, it was apparent that Phoebe had gained some weight.\u201cIs it because it\u2019s fall?\u201dCuckoo\u2026 Cuckoo\u2026. CuckooLeyla kept questioning Phoebe, but the bird seemed to ignore her.\u201cWhere are you eating now? You don\u2019t even have Kyle now\u2026\u201dHer last words, she unintentionally said, left her stunned. Tears welled up in her eyes, whenever his name came out.\u2018No, it\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t cry.\u2019Leyla tried to keep her tears from spilling out of her eyes. They had promised to take care of themselves, and she would do her best to keep that promise.She calmed herself down by taking a deep breath and then released her chubby Phoebe. That bird roamed around the yard for a while before flying to the far side of the forest.It was an ordinary day.She diligently finished her morning routine and went to work after seeing off Uncle Bill.The sound of her winding bicycle chain clicking along the Arvis\u2019 road, splendidly carpeted with autumnal leaves creating a noisy tune.\u201cTeacher!\u201dStudents who recognized her waved their hands as she entered the road in front of the school.Leyla dismounted her bike, greeted the children, and walked into the school.It was an ordinary day, but she felt a bunch of happiness.The children were much more obedient than usual, and they scored well on their mathematics and spelling tests. The languid warmth of the classroom she loved, the lunchtime chatter with Mrs. Grever she enjoyed, and the cloudless, high, bright blue sky beyond the window.She smiled.Leyla steeled her heart and smiled brightly every time she was reminded of Kyle at waking or on her way home from work.But, as she got closer to Arvis, she could no longer ignore the memories she shared with him as they walked through the streets together.Loneliness suddenly swallowed her up, taking what was once her inner light and replacing it with a darkness that overshadows each moment.Layla stopped her bike on the sideroad. She felt helpless.The myriad of memories gliding above the road snowballed into a deep regret.They couldn\u2019t live like brother and sister for the rest of their lives, as they weren\u2019t related by blood. Nor could they live as best friends as man and woman. But they never knew their relationship was meant to end in separation from the very beginning.They never once expected that they would love, get hurt, and become like this in the end\u2026As her vision began to blur, Leyla squirmed and bit her lip. She encouraged herself, closing her eyes as if she was enchanting a spell.\u2018I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll be fine for sure, so please take care of yourself, Kyle.\u2019Fortunately, she was able to contain her sobs and continue pedalling her bike.A black car approached from afar and eventually brushed past her.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias made the driver pull over the car at the entrance of Platanus road. After telling his aide to go back first, he was then left alone on the road, just like the day when last summer had begun.He took a leisurely walk, waiting for the approaching figure. The fallen leaves rustled underneath his shoes.When the sound of a bicycle running through the road was faintly heard, Matthias naturally slowed down his pace.He turned around at the same time Leyla stopped her bike at an appropriate distance from him.The expected scene unfolded before his still eyes; Leyla was in front of him, along with her bicycle.\u201cHello, Duke \u2026Herhardt.\u201dLeyla awkwardly greeted him after glancing around. Her braided, curled hair was half loose and fluttered in the wind. She didn\u2019t seem to have a knack for dressing up as her hair was always tied too neatly or too loosely like today.Still, he quite liked her clumsy appearance.Matthias nodded his head in a straight posture, one hand behind his back. Leyla blinked her emerald eyes while holding tight her bike\u2019s handlebars. Whatever she did, she always looked uptight whenever she encountered him.\u201cWell then\u2026. Excuse me.\u201dAfter bowing, Leyla dragged her bicycle past him and kept walking.\u201cYou have to act like a proper lady, Leyla.\u201dMatthias warned, staring at her back.Leyla had just hopped on the saddle when she flinched and pulled back the bike she was about to pedal.\u201cYou know that. If you want me to be a gentleman, you need to behave like a lady.\u201dMatthias slowly approached her, who could neither get off the bike nor step on the pedal. He continued,\u201cAnd I need to be a gentleman for your bird to be safe.\u201dLeyla immediately turned her head. She frowned and stepped off her bike. Matthias smirked as he tilted his head and peered down at her. Her moist eyes looked petrified, but her dainty twisted lips voiced displeasure and defiance.\u2018What a cranky woman.\u2019After a long stare at her, who pathetically trembled at his joke, Matthias walked forward as if nothing had happened. Having no other choice, Leyla dragged her bicycle and followed him from behind with a heavy stride.Matthias sighed and turned around. \u201cI never asked for you to act as my maid.\u201dLeyla, who grimly looked down at her toes and followed him like a shadow, suddenly raised her head, taken aback.\u201cYes? Ah\u2026 .\u201dDespite her stubbornness, she was smart enough to understand what he meant. She quickly took a couple more steps towards him. Her gloomy expression conveyed her displeasure, but they were still one step apart.Matthias scoffed as he got his wish and stepped back.As he began to walk again, Leyla carefully matched his pace. With a bicycle between them, they strolled side by side on the Platanus road.There were no words spoken between them. The refreshing evening breeze was filled with only the sound of bicycle wheels spinning and falling leaves being tramped.He was a man who walked very slowly with those long legs of his.Leyla meekly glanced at him after turning her eyes at the road that seemed to be fading away. He was a languid man, but his pace was especially slow today.She wasn\u2019t sure whether she was feeling that way because of the awkward situation.He was a man of similar height as Kyle, but he gave off a bigger, and domineering presence. She reasoned, it might\u2019ve been because of his straight, elegant posture and distinctive eyes. His physical appearance also looked firmer and broader than Kyle.\u2018Maybe that\u2019s why he seems so different.\u2019Leyla made her own findings and deliberately moved her gaze upward. She observed his white, smooth hands, his dark grey suit, his delicately shaped tie, expressionless lips and his\u2026 eyes.His sapphire eyes noticed her gaze and beheld her.Leyla suddenly was seized with instinctive fear. She meant to bend her head, but her mind wandered elsewhere.As he thoroughly looked into her eyes as if he was captivated, Matthias opened his lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His choice of words left Leyla befuddled when she grasped his gybe after a moment of startlement.\u2018This man! Is he trying to pick a fight again?\u2019\u201cI know. My hair\u2019s a little\u2026. blowsy.\u201dLeyla\u2019s tone sharpened at his unforeseen criticism.\u201cA little?\u201dScoffingly, Matthias asked while his scrutinizing eyes traced her top to bottom.Under his watchful gaze, Leyla squeezed the bike\u2019s handles, battling to suppress her urge to run away. Her incapability of restraining the weird emotions stirring in her body has already made her upset as stood opposite to him. She doesn\u2019t want to look like an easy target by blushing at the very sight of a man.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just untie your hair?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to, but they said I won\u2019t look like a proper teacher.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d He asked, the lines on his fair forehead creasing together in suspicion.\u201cThe headmistress.\u201dLeyla replied and quickly averted her gaze when she felt her cheeks getting warmer as his eyes lingered on her.\u201cShe said that if I look too young, I won\u2019t seem like a teacher with authority.\u201d She hesitantly continued to speak, fearing that the profound silence between them would make things even more awkward. \u201cSo the headmistress advised me not to have a \u2018student-like\u2019 hairstyle.\u201dAs soon as she concluded, his faint laughter that resembled a soothing breeze flew out, quickly turning her earlobes into a deep shade of burning red.She felt like a fool and dreaded looking at him, once again.With a scoff adorning his face, Matthias peered down at the petite woman before him. \u201cSo, that blowy, tied-up hair is the symbol of a teacher\u2019s authority\u2026\u201d His eyes still brimmed with sarcasm as he witnessed the look of hurt pride on her face- coyer but cute.\u201cI\u2019m practising a lot, so I\u2019ll get better at styling my hair soon.\u201d She retaliated in the same tone, leaving him spellbound for a moment.\u2018This woman never wants to give in, even if it kills her, doesn\u2019t she?\u2019Her persistence caused Matthias to smirk once again.\u201cWell, Let\u2019s see then.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m damn sure that I can do it. In case my skill doesn\u2019t get any better\u2026I\u2019ll just cut it short.\u201d\u201cCut it?\u201dAt her casual reply, the beaming smile on Matthias face faded all at once and the very next instant, when he saw Leyla nodding thoughtfully, his eyes narrowed as if he witnessed something terrible.\u201cYes. Then I\u2019d look a lot more mature and\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cut it.\u201dEven though his command sounded oddly soft and calm, Leyla couldn\u2019t help but look at him in puzzlement. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I need your permission to grow or cut my hair?\u201d She retorted in a surprisingly annoyed tone.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful\u2026, your hair.\u201dHer irate question was answered with a stupefying reply that was nearly impossible to believe.Above all\u2026. that sounded ridiculous.Doubting her ears, Leyla frowned at him, but unlike her agitated self, Mathias remained calm as he beheld her state passively.\u201cIt\u2019s like a wing.\u201dHis wintry voice echoed the same as he insulted and hurt her with a single statement.Leyla recalled how his voice remained unchanged and calm, even though he kept throwing her terrible slurs.As she stood fuming in anger, her memory took a walk to that old summer day of their first meeting. That day, when she first saw the Duke Herhardt from the treetop, his cold voice remained tranquil and serene, even when he came perilously close to shooting a child. His soothing voice imprinted itself in her mind ever since.Leyla clearly remembered jumping down from the tree and running towards Uncle Bill\u2019s cottage, exclaiming at the existence of such a human being.\u2018The- There\u2019s a man in the forest! A tall man!\u2019She poured out a bunch of random words doused in admiration as she struggled to catch her breathing.\u2018 He has black hair, and his eyes were blue. And his voice was light as a feather .\u2019At that moment, only the feathers of the water birds came into her mind as she struggled to explain the texture of the voice that left her smitten. Little Leyla, who regarded those soft feathers as her precious possession, couldn\u2019t compare his voice with anything else but to the feathers that she gathered while ambling along the banks of the Schulter River.Flustered by his blatant words, Leyla hurriedly avoided his gaze. The Duke\u2019s cruel words would rather hurt her so he could remain as the person she disliked and the most feared one in her heart. After all, it was the Duke Herhardt whom she knew of.However, no matter how long she waited Matthias spoke no word nor a familiar insult escaped from his lips.As the leaves from the autumn trees fell one at a time, he simply walked away from a confused Leyla who was fretting whether his odd compliment was her own hallucination or not.Snapping out of her thoughts, Leyla neatened her hair that cascaded down her shoulders, only to flutter by the autumn wind. The sudden gush of cold wind shook her a little, prompting her hand holding the steering handle to slip. Leyla, who made a vague effort to grab the handle, crashed to the ground along with her bicycle.\u201cAckhh!\u201dThe thud of the bicycle colliding with the pavement echoed over the quiet road, as well as her scream.Matthias spectated the comedy scene unfolding before his eyes with a faint grimace. He unknowingly let out a sneer when he watched the hilarious sight of Leyla\u2019s struggle to stop her own bicycle from crushing her to the dusty road.\u201cYou always seem to trip and fall.\u201dLeyla bit her lip in shame as he laughed. However, she felt relieved.\u2018Just laugh, harass me, and leave.\u2019She hopefully waited for him to do so. But Matthias quietly pulled up her bike, picked up her bag that had bounced off far away, came back to her, and knelt.\u201cNnn..no-no, It\u2019s mine!\u201d Leyla panickingly snatched the bag from Matthias when he was about to pick her scattered belongings, \u201cI-I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201dHer blatant hostility made Matthias\u2019s brows scrunched.\u201cI..I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Leyla mumbled as she lowered her eyes and began to collect her stuff with trembling hands, even though Matthias had done nothing to frighten her.Though her actions and shaky voice agitated him, Matthias decided to watch her patiently. When his eyes caught her flushed cheeks and neck, his ire toned down when he figured out that Leyla was just too embarrassed and shy to stay next to him.Matthias stood up in front of her, watching her scramble to gather her dropped items under the shadow of his looming figure. She seemed very distraught, as she even stuffed the roadside leaves and stones into her bag. Her quirkiness somehow had quelled Matthias\u2019 annoyance.After she finished packing her bag, Leyla quickly got up to her feet. She looked at him, oblivious to the dust that was all over her clothes and hands.\u201cI know it\u2019s rude, but Duke\u2026.\u201dHer perplexed eyes drifted between Matthias and the mansion entrance on the opposite side of the road, wondering what to do next.\u201cIf it\u2019s rude of me to go ahead of you, I\u2019ll wait until you leave first.\u201dShe spoke so boldly as she no longer wanted to walk together with him. Yet, Matthias could see the anxiety in her eyes. Her attitude was very invasive, but he tolerated it, for now, knowing that he also couldn\u2019t walk alongside her after passing the entrance.\u201cGo on.\u201dHis permission surprised her.\u201cMe first?\u201d She confusingly asked to confirm,Matthias clicked his chin instead of answering. Leyla\u2019s face eventually lit up, and quickly lowered her head,\u201cThank you, Duke.\u201dMatthias seemed to take offence with her excessive politeness; it was rather like an affront to him.Leyla made her way to the entrance first, but she halted in her tracks to look back before getting onto her bike. It was evident that Matthias was oddly kind towards her, but Leyla\u2019s eyes remained wide with mistrust as she frowned at the man.After a quick glance, she tilted her head and rode off on her back.\u2018Should I have made her cry instead?\u2019Matthias\u2019 regret belatedly came, but he kept on walking with an expression that didn\u2019t seem to look unpleasant until the shiny pen on the ground suddenly caught his attention.Agilely, Matthias picked up the pen of a woman who easily fell and lost her things.His blue eyes followed the girl while his grip on the pen turned tighter as he took a moment to contemplate whether to stop her or not.Leyla was near enough that she could hear him if he called, but Matthias kept mum.He strolled the road while spinning the pen with his long fingers. While Leyla, who diligently cycled her bike, soon disappeared beyond the Arvis gate.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThat bird came again.\u201dMark Evers smilingly informed the man who sat facing away from the window. Even without much explanation, Matthias understood his words and didn\u2019t bother to take a look at the window as it has become a part of his daily routine.It was the time for the visit of \u2018Phoebe\u2019, the pigeon much gentler and smarter than its owner.Leaning against a chair by the fireplace, Matthias had finished today\u2019s work by signing the last document. After his aide took the paper and retreated he was left to his own devices in the living room.Matthias shut the lid of his fountain pen and glanced out of the window. Phoebe, as always, was sitting on the railing, preoccupied with gulping down its food.He turned his gaze away from the bird to the thin pen in his hand and began to examine it carefully. The pen owner\u2019s name was engraved in gold on the cap.\u2018Leyla Lewellin.\u2019It seemed to be a brand-new pen and didn\u2019t look like she bought it with her own money, so it was likely a gift from the gardener.Matthias hoped so. He was sure that Leyla would do everything to get it back if it was Bill Remmer\u2019s gift.\u2018Would she have noticed by now?\u2019Matthias stared at the pen with a crooked grin and re-opened the pen cap. Acting like a gentleman towards a woman who had praised him didn\u2019t seem like a bad idea. Besides, it was time for the pigeon to pay for its own meal.Matthias paced up to the balcony, folding a letter with a single short sentence. He chuckled at the thought of the bird\u2019s owner fleeing on her bicycle while tying the letter to the bird\u2019s ankle, which dociely leaned its body towards him.After tying the note, Matthias flew Phoebe into the sky.And the carrier pigeon began to wing towards the gardener\u2019s cottage eagerly.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Once the coppery sun settled behind the horizon, Phoebe returned along with the night.Leyla was sitting and staring mindlessly at the empty desk when the pecking sound from the window startled her. She turned her head and called the bird in a chiding tone\u201cPhoebe!\u201dLeyla hurriedly wrapped the shawl over her shoulders as she stood from her chair. The chilly wind blew into the room when she threw open the window.\u201cAre you hungry? Wait a minute\u2026 uh?\u201dThe letter tied to Phoebe\u2019s leg made her pupils widen in astonishment. She even rubbed her eyes because she thought she was mistaken, but a letter was tied there.\u201c\u2026 Kyle?\u201dShe unconsciously called his name, even though she knew it wasn\u2019t him.\u2018No, Kyle already left. There\u2019s no way anyone would tie a letter to Phoebe\u2019s feet.\u2019Leyla stared blankly at Phoebe before tremblingly opening the letter. As she skimmed through the brief sentence written in the letter, her countenance quickly changed from curiosity to dismay.She gasped and unwittingly stepped back while the letter slipped from her fingers. It gently fluttered onto the floor beneath the window.Leyla took a step back, then another. She stared at the letter, blinking her eyes repeatedly. Her mind had snapped back into reality when her back slammed against the closet.\u201cI-It can\u2019t be!\u201dMumbling in a quivering voice, Leyla hurriedly rummaged through her bag, but the pen she was searching for was nowhere to be found. She was even more baffled by the stones and leaves coming out of her bag since she had no idea how those things had gotten into her bag.Leyla frowned and staggered back to the window. Her letter-holding hand had lost its colour and was now as pale as the ring of moonlight.\u2018[Where\u2019s your pen, Leyla?]\u2019Once again, she read the note Phoebe had brought in and wrapped her arms around her head.She sighed.\u2018No way.\u2019Leyla muttered the words a few more times, but she knew nothing would change.Guu\u2026 Guuu\u2026 Guu\u2026.In the white moonlight of an autumn night, Phoebe, the pigeon that the Duke fattened, calmly cried.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayArvis was bustling with the preparations for Herhardt\u2019s dinner party.As Leyla walked home from school, the roads were swarming with carriages and vehicles. Uncle Bill had been extremely busy these past few days, engrossed in arranging flowers for the mansion\u2019s interior. It was that time of the year when flowers start wilting, so he had to gather some from greenhouses and procure the rest from local flower gardens.Leyla helped her uncle out by making frequent trips downtown to buy flowers. Her hectic days made her feel lucky; at the very least, she could forget about her missing pen and her unanswered letter from the Duke. But now that her work was done, she had to return to Arvis.As the entrance to the mansion loomed closer, Leyla slowed her pace.Fortunately, Duke Herhardt seemed to have brushed the matter aside. Or more likely, he didn\u2019t have a chance to ponder over it. He, too, had been swamped with work lately, and Phoebe, who had been secretly communicating with him, was confined within a cage in the backyard.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201dShe had uttered these very words at least a hundred times since Phoebe brought in the Duke\u2019s letter.\u201cHow did he come up with the idea of taming Phoebe and using it as his carrier bird?\u201dShe hadn\u2019t lived a long life, nor was she acquainted with many people. However, within her lifetime, Duke Matthias von Herhardt was by far the most strange and yet enigmatic man Leyla Lewellin had ever come across.\u201cWhy does he keep taking other people\u2019s things? Is he a kleptomaniac?\u201d Leyla kicked an innocent stone on the path as she grumbled.She didn\u2019t want to meet the duke, even though she needed to get her pen back. She didn\u2019t really know why she was determined to avoid him even more now, but Leyla felt like she had to.Just as Leyla was about to enter the mansion from a side entrance, a blaring honk startled her. She swivelled to see the Brandt family\u2019s car park right in front of her.As the back seat window slowly rolled down, Leyla approached the car with stiff steps.\u201cLeyla, long time no see.\u201dSitting inside was the familiar face of Claudine Brandt.\u201cHow have you been?\u201d Claudine beamed, scanning Leyla from head to toe.Leyla froze for a moment. A familiar sense of guilt, like that of a child who had made a grave mistake, gripped her tight. It was the same emotion she had felt last summer, on the day of Duke Herhardt and the Lady\u2019s engagement ceremony. The memory of her first kiss being stolen by Claudine\u2019s fianc\u00e9 never failed to make her feel pathetic.The Duke\u2019s gentle voice, his soft laughter, and the touch of his firm, fervent hands flitted across her mind, but Claudine\u2019s gaze brought her back to the present.Clasping her frozen hands together, Leyla, as she\u2019d always done, greeted Claudine with a polite bow.\u201cHello, Lady Claudine.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was a surprise to no one that Herhardt\u2019s dinner party had ended on a perfect note. Always the epitome of grace and elegance, the two hostesses of the party were consistent throughout. In the Berg Empire, the name Herhardt had earned the epithet \u2018perfection\u2019. A mishap in Herhardt\u2019s dinner party would merely heighten everyone\u2019s unbridled curiosity.\u201cWould it be alright if we took a walk in the greenhouse for a while?\u201dClaudine politely asked Elysee after everyone had moved on to chat in the living room. Standing on the other side of the room were the people Claudine had referred to \u2013 her fianc\u00e9 and her cousin.\u201cOf course, go ahead.\u201d Elysee von Herhardt readily consented. \u201cYou young people do need to spend some time together.\u201dWith her subtle tone, the ladies surrounding Elysee burst into laughter in tandem, as if they were dancing in rhythm.Claudine exited the living room and Matthias together with Riette followed suit, leaving behind the ladies who began gossiping about the youngsters\u2019 love affairs.\u201cOh, Duke Herhardt, Madam Norma granted me permission to expand this greenhouse when I become the Duchess of Arvis,\u201d said Claudine, her radiant voice permeating the tranquil greenhouse in the dark.\u201cI see.\u201dMatthias\u2019s lips twitched with a faint smile.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go along with whatever my Lady wishes.\u201dClaudine already knew what Matthias would answer, but she still nodded with a pleasant smile. \u201cYou can look forward to it. I\u2019m confident that I can truly love this magnificent greenhouse, Arvis\u2019 Heaven.\u201dClaudine walked along the pathway with a spring in her step. Although she was being escorted by her fianc\u00e9, most of her conversations ended up revolving around Riette.\u201cMaster.\u201dClaudine had just begun talking about what tropical plants to grow in the expanded greenhouse when a servant arrived to see Matthias. Someone had sought him out to discuss business-related matters.\u201cCome back quickly.\u201d Claudine smiled as she let go of her fianc\u00e9\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll continue my walk with Riette.\u201d\u201cI always end up as the Duke\u2019s substitute for my dear Lady Brandt.\u201dDespite his grumbling, Riette willingly lent his arm to Claudine.After Matthias and his servant departed, Claudine and Riette were the only ones left in the greenhouse, surrounded by the soft lull of the flowing fountain.They resumed their prior discussion as well as their stroll. Claudine\u2019s visualization of expanding the greenhouse was quite specific; she had already made up her mind about which particular plants to import and how to landscape them.\u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve already become Duchess Herhardt. Your love for Arvis exceeds your love for your fianc\u00e9,\u201d Riette surmised as he turned to look at her after listening to her ideas.Claudine nodded without a hint of shame. \u201cEither way, I\u2019m still showing love for Herhardt.\u201d\u201cYou two really are something.\u201dRiette\u2019s laugh was one of defeat.\u201cMatthias is pretty cold, are you okay with that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cDuke Herhardt doesn\u2019t love anyone. He never loved you before, doesn\u2019t love you now, and will never love you in the future.\u201d\u201cWhich prestigious nobleman marries for love?\u201d\u201cSome do! It would surely happen if Lady Brandt would simply become my wife.\u201dAs usual, Riette kept his expression and tone light and casual. Claudine just flashed a smile in response.\u201cRiette, I\u2019ve been going in and out of Arvis with my mother for ten years.\u201dClaudine turned to look at Riette.\u201cDo you know what that means?\u201d\u201cIt means, for ten years now, the aristocrats of this empire have already fancied you as Duchess Herhardt.\u201d\u201cRight, Riette, this is why I like you.\u201dClaudine laughed softly and placed her hand back on Riette\u2019s arm.Riette calmly escorted his cousin. The subtle tension between them soon disappeared as their casual conversation and laughter flowed back in.\u201cI also want to raise a peacock after I expand this place.\u201dClaudine changed the topic while observing the birds in the greenhouse.\u201cIs this the birth of a bird-loving couple?\u201d Riette asked sarcastically.\u201cRiette!\u201d\u201cThe bird is still there, by the way. That pretty little bird who dwells in the Duke\u2019s bedroom.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Duke Herhardt ought to have at least some small pleasures. We should respect his wishes.\u201d\u201cI hope it stays just at that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not worth your worries. No matter how pretty it is, you can\u2019t bestow the title of Duchess to a bird, Riette.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true.\u201d Riette failed to refute. No matter how much Matthias adored the canary, a bird was just a bird. \u201cDo you know how long a canary lives? Does it have a long life?\u201d He asked.Claudine tilted her head, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I hope that noisy bird doesn\u2019t live too long.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say that we should respect the Duke\u2019s small pleasures?\u201d\u201cYes, but if that bird dies, there will be another bird who\u2019ll entertain Duke Herhardt.\u201d\u201cClaudine, I truly want to give my blessings to you and Matthias.\u201d Riette laughed absent-mindedly as he gazed at Claudine\u2019s face, \u201cYou two are such a perfect match.\u201dRiette felt a brief pang of pity for Matthias\u2019s little bird. The poor bird was bound to hover around the well-matched couple helplessly.Claudine\u2019s lips lifted to a natural smile. Seeing her cruel, yet beautiful face, Riette blurted out, \u201cShould I become acquainted with that bird for my precious cousin?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had that kind of hobby.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not my cup of tea, but she\u2019s still pretty.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy.\u201d Claudine giggled as if she were having a lot of fun. \u201cThat bird may look pretty, but she has the pride of a princess.\u201d\u201cHah. Do I look like the type to easily fail?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 but I\u2019m indeed curious. Will you be able to become friends with that haughty bird?\u201dClaudine was no longer smiling, her features as cold as the window panes reflecting the moonlight.\u201cIf you succeed, I\u2019d be happy to send you a congratulatory gift.\u201d\u201cWhat gift?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t gratitude and love enough?\u201dTheir ostentatious smiles dissipated as the pair\u2019s intense stare-down grew profound.\u201cNot bad.\u201dAs the door to the greenhouse opened, Riette let out a low sigh and the pair made their way forward. Matthias had returned.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Neither the carrier bird nor Leyla had returned. Everything was exactly the same as it had been prior to him sending the letter.Matthias scoffed as he looked up at the sky, where the white dove used to flit about. He laughed coldly, bitter and borderline angry.\u201cYou can go back now.\u201dMatthias declared to the servant waiting in front of his balcony door.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be waiting in front of the annex when it\u2019s time for departure.\u201dMark Evers left a polite greeting and returned with the rest of the staff.Left to his own devices, Matthias let his mind wander as he looked down at the tranquil river below his balcony. He believed that Leyla had been too preoccupied with assisting the gardener recently. But now\u2026 that was no longer the case.After lifting his cuff to check his watch, Matthias paced up and down his balcony. There was still some time left before his afternoon appointment. Also, it was the weekend, so Leyla Lewellin would probably be in her cabin.Thus, he deduced a fair conclusion and decided to follow through with his plan without hesitation.Matthias walked down the riverside and entered a forest path carpeted with fallen leaves.He was filled with regret.It flooded through him hot and thick, darker than the colour of autumn leaves.\u2018I should\u2019ve hurt her until she cried.\u2019However, he soon found Leyla Lewellin. She was hanging laundry near the cottage\u2019s fences. She looked very calm and relaxed, enough to make Matthias seem foolish for restlessly waiting around for the past week.Matthias stood still and watched her with discretion. Leyla continued hanging the clean bedding, her attention entirely focused on her task. She pulled left and right, pulled once again, and then twisted the sheet tight until it was dry enough to hang.Her proud smile added to Matthias\u2019 bewilderment.\u2018Ha\u2026 Would you look at that?\u2019Lately, he\u2019d been thinking about those words often. She was annoyingly cute yet ferocious, and she always amused him with her quirky attitude. Matthias felt frustrated with himself for being so disarmed by her.Leyla turned around just as Matthias took a step forward. Her body stiffened like a pole as soon as she saw him. So far, he had thought her actions were very adorable, but Matthias now decided to change his outlook.Leyla swivelled and started running. When she disappeared beyond the yard, Matthias realized that she was running away from him.\u201cThat woman\u2026\u201dThe sight of her running away as if she had seen a ghost made Matthias scoff. It was amusing to watch and more amusing to think that she believed she could dare run away from him.He withheld his sentiments for now. After he stopped laughing, Matthias began to chase her.Leyla ran out of the yard and towards the harvesting fields on the opposite end of the Schulter river. Matthias\u2019 strides grew longer, and the gap between the pair narrowed. Leyla looked back in fear, and then\u2026 she stumbled.She finally got caught under a willow tree near the river. Leyla struggled against him, but Matthias had grasped onto her shoulders tight and caged her between the tree trunk and his body. His hands were blazing as he aggressively grabbed her matted hair.When he looked down, Matthias was greeted by the sight of a tearful Leyla.He smiled.\u201cWhere are you going, Leyla?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Duke Herhardt is insane.\u2019\u201cOuchhh!\u201d\u201cYou must answer me when I ask you a question.\u201dLeyla\u2019s breathing was ragged as Matthias smirked and tugged at her hair. Unlike the time he chased and slammed her against the tree trunk, his touch was gentle. However, the shame and apprehension of being dragged by the hair muddled her mind and prevented her from noticing his loosened grip.\u201cLeyla.\u201dHis voice sounded huskier.Leyla tried to step back, but the tree trunk blocked her escape. Although they had both run for quite a while, Matthias\u2019 breathing had already stabilized. Meanwhile, Leyla kept panting erratically. As her chest heaved up and down, the sensation of his towering, firm body grew apparent, further adding to her shame.\u201cWhy\u2026\u201dLeyla shoved his shoulder roughly, her voice shaking.\u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201dRealizing that her two arms\u2019 strength alone won\u2019t be enough to push him away, she twisted her body with all her might.Matthias pressed his chest closer against hers, amused by her futile attempts. He looked pleased to see Leyla\u2019s helplessness at the state of their intertwined bodies.\u201cDon\u2019t question. Answer me.\u201dHe looked into her glare, eager and waiting.\u201cAnswer me, Leyla.\u201dMatthias fiddled with a strand of Leyla\u2019s golden hair, slowly wrapping it around his finger. The soft texture of her locks somehow alleviated the displeasure that had consumed him over the past week. It even managed to water down his irritation from Leyla\u2019s lack of response.\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s unladylike to not answer?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cLeyla.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201dMatthias\u2019 grip on her hair gradually gained strength. Overcome with a foreboding feeling, Leyla finally opened her lips in a bout of anger.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t my letter arrive?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cLeyla, you better think carefully before you speak.\u201d Matthias\u2019 lips spread to a wide grin seeing Leyla\u2019s eyes tremble with fear. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019ll do with a useless carrier bird that can\u2019t even deliver a letter properly?\u201d\u201cYou- you promised!\u201d yelled Leyla, \u201cYou promised not to shoot Phoebe!\u201d\u201cDid I?\u201d\u201cDuke!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t seem to understand what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dMatthias grew more mischievous with the woman who stumbled over her clumsy lies, failing to hide her nervousness. Leyla glared at him briefly before lowering her trembling eyelids.\u201c\u2026Sorry.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cYou already know.\u201d\u201cFor ignoring my letter, running away, or lying?\u201dLeyla flinched as he pointed out each of her mistakes. She looked particularly lovely when she was docile, and Matthias regretted not being able to see her downcast, glassy eyes.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough apologizing.\u201dMatthias raised her chin. His touch was careful. It had the tenderness of someone handling something delicate. Yet, Leyla shivered at his mere touch. He didn\u2019t mind her reaction though; he was already content with her looking at him.\u201cI guess that pen means nothing to you since you\u2019re acting like it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s precious to me! But\u2026\u201dAs Leyla turned to look away, Matthias captured her dainty chin again, turning her gaze back to him.\u201cBut?\u201dHe didn\u2019t want the conversation to be avoided any further. Leyla finally admitted defeat, with her face and hair firmly locked within his grasp. She let out a sigh of resignation.\u201cI really don\u2019t understand you.\u201dLeyla\u2019s serene, emerald eyes held Matthias\u2019 gaze. Reflected in her beautiful eyes that resembled the lush greens of eternal summer was his shadow.\u201cWhy do you keep stealing my things?\u201dMatthias\u2019 eyebrows shot up upon hearing her chastising tone, like that of a teacher disciplining a naughty student. Her retort was so ridiculous that it brought a grin to his lips. Besides Leyla Lewellin, no one in the whole empire would dare accuse Duke Herhardt of being a petty thief.\u201cAre you a crow?!\u201d She snapped. Her gaze travelled from his jet-black hair to his piercing blue eyes.\u201cA crow?\u201dHer unexpected question made Matthias frown, but Leyla didn\u2019t seem the least bit phased.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s always stealing my\u2026 I mean, you\u2019re the one who did wrong. Why should I be the one who has to go seek you out and beg for my things every single time? It\u2019s not fair.\u201dLeyla\u2019s disgruntled voice was a pitch higher than her regular tone. Somehow, it was clearer and more pleasing to the ears, so Matthias willingly listened.\u201cThat\u2019s why you stayed put this time?\u201d Matthias\u2019 lips twitched at Leyla\u2019s frustration.His unruffled features left her speechless. Leyla had finally mustered up the courage to protest, but the Duke had dismissed her with a simple smirk.\u2018What in the world\u2026\u2019He made her feel foolish.\u201cLeyla.\u201dRight when Leyla was about to speak, Matthias had called out her name. His obtrusive voice dampened her resolve. It was a strange feeling that she couldn\u2019t really describe. Hence, she promptly opened her eyes and mulled over a possible reply.\u201cLeyla.\u201dMatthias murmured, his voice a low hum.When she turned her head to the side, Leyla\u2019s ear pressed against Matthias\u2019 chest. She could hear the faint beating of his heart.She gasped, placing her pale, stiff hands on top of his chest, horrified at the possibility of him feeling her thumping heart. Leyla pushed his shoulders once again, even though she knew her efforts were for nought.When Matthias finally took a step back, Leyla let out a long-held breath.Despite being of timid nature, Leyla Lewellin was gentle, smart, and at times, daring. She was difficult to comprehend but very entertaining to watch.\u201cNow, please return my pen.\u201dMatthias burst into laughter at Leyla\u2019s abrupt request.\u2018She never disappoints me.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201dMatthias eagerly answered.\u201cI threw it away.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would look for it.\u201d\u201cThen why did you come looking for me?\u201d\u201cLeyla, don\u2019t you think I should at least inform you?\u201d Matthias shrugged his shoulders as if she were asking the obvious.\u201cI\u2019m a gentleman.\u201dMatthias caressed her hair, still trapped between his fingers.\u201cI\u2019m Carlsbar\u2019s best gentleman, acknowledged by Ms. Lewellin herself.\u201dAs he loosened his grip, Leyla\u2019s hair fell on her shoulders like golden waves. She gave him a disapproving look while staggering backwards. However, as soon as she\u2019d been released, she let out a yelp of pain.\u201cOuch!\u201dAs the last strands of her hair slipped out of his fingers, Matthias suddenly strengthened his grip.\u201cAm I not?\u201dHe looked elated, even when Leyla\u2019s eyes went misty from the pain on her scalp.\u2018Insane\u2019\u201cI-It\u2019s hurt!\u201d Leyla struggled to release her hair from his fingers. Chuckling, Matthias played with the tips of her hair as if it were nothing but a toy.\u2018I can\u2019t believe this deranged psychopath is the head of the great House of Herhardt!\u2019Just when she was about to start worrying about Arvis\u2019s future, Matthias abruptly let go of her hair, causing Leyla to trip.Leyla expected to hear his musical laughter at her tumbling figure, but her plummeting vision came to a sudden halt. Before she knew it, Matthias\u2019 familiar features filled her view. Only after feeling his arms encircle her waist did Leyla realize that she was looking up at him while being held against his chest.\u2018Should I bite him?\u2019Leyla felt like a trapped mouse until Matthias casually set her down. His calm, yet sly demeanour caused her to shudder.She quickly ran to the river\u2019s edge near the tree, while Matthias paused to check his wristwatch.\u201cI\u2019m taking those words back. You\u2019re definitely not a gentleman. Absolutely not!\u201dLeyla screamed at the top of her lungs.\u201cI guess I have a terrible reputation now.\u201dHer cheeks flushed with rage as he laughed again, and it reflected in her voice when she declared, \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d\u201cAh, are you?\u201d\u201cYes! If you\u2019re a gentleman, then I must be the Queen!\u201dLeyla was bitter at her past self for showering him with such servile praises.Matthias flashed a wolfish grin while fixing the lapel of his dishevelled coat \u2013 as if to tease her by saying, \u2018Is that all you have to say?\u2019Before he left, Matthias made a theatrical bow, as though he were a servant in the presence of a Queen. His subtle jibe left Leyla speechless.Leyla stared at the Duke\u2019s retreating back, dumbstruck. The man who hunted her down and tormented her like a predator had now left after insulting her in the most\u00a0beautiful\u00a0manner.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The car was already on standby with its door open when Matthias arrived in front of the annex.He promptly stepped into the car, his prior annoyance and displeasure having vanished into thin air.The car gathered speed as it drove along the riverfront road. Inside, Matthias gazed at the Schulter River for a moment before turning to the pile of documents and letters his aide had arranged for him.His twinkling eyes slowly returned to their usual, calculated gleam. However, his stoic visage broke when he slightly pouted his lips as he retrieved a pen from the pocket of his coat.\u2018Leyla Lewellin.\u2019The golden letters engraved on the pen sparkled in the afternoon sun.Matthias\u2019 fingertips softly glided over the pen\u2019s glossy surface. Smiling, he opened the pen cap.The scritch-scratch of pen-against-paper echoed throughout the sunlit car.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cMs Lewellin, this is for you.\u201dThe mailman had a small parcel left in his hands once all the official letters had been given out.\u201cFor me?\u201dLeyla hesitated before receiving a parcel at school rather than at her cabin. When she searched for the sender\u2019s identity, she was greeted with a name and an address that she had never seen before.\u201cMight this be a wrong delivery?\u201d\u201cHuh? Um- no\u2026\u201dLeyla dismissed her doubts with a smile. Although she didn\u2019t know who the sender was, the recipient tag on the box clearly mentioned \u2018Leyla Lewellin.\u2019\u201cThank you.\u201dLeyla hurried back into the school building after thanking the mailman. As the school\u2019s youngest teacher, she was tasked with the duty of receiving and distributing all the letters and parcels \u2013 from the principal\u2019s office to the classrooms.By the time she completed her tasks, break time was almost over. Leyla took a seat at her classroom desk and started unwrapping the package she had received. She found a long box, free of any note or missive.Leyla checked the sender\u2019s name and address once again. It was odd \u2013 the address mentioned a strange city.\u201cOh!\u201dUpon sliding the lid open, Leyla sat with her mouth agape.Inside the box was a black pen with exquisite golden etchings.\u2018Who on earth would send this and why\u2026\u2019But then, the memories of the weekend flooded her mind and she let out an inadvertent sigh.This new pen seemed far too expensive compared to her previous one.Leyla carefully picked up the new fountain pen. Her name was engraved on the cap, just like her old pen that the Duke had thrown away.Before she could do anything else though, her students started pouring into the classroom with the sound of the ringing school bell.Leyla put her new pen back in its box and stowed it deep within her desk drawer. How dearly she wished she could stow away her memories in the same, dark place, too. But alas, Leyla knew that was impossible.\u201cLet\u2019s get started, everyone!\u201dLeyla stood before the podium, a jovial smile in place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was late afternoon when Riette von Lindman arrived at Herhardt\u2019s mansion, his carriage loaded with luggage for his short stay at Arvis.\u201cWelcome, Riette.\u201d Elysee von Herhardt greeted him cheerfully, \u201cI wish my sister had come with you.\u201d\u201cMy mother is going on a trip soon.\u201d\u201cShe must be planning a trip to the south for winter.\u201d\u201cYes, she detests the cold.\u201d Riette smiled as he conveyed his mother\u2019s regards with a gentle voice. \u201cWhere\u2019s Madam Norma?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s taking a nap at the moment. You may say hello to her later.\u201dElysee von Herhardt led Riette to the living room.As a cousin and a close friend of Matthias, he had wandered in and out of Arvis growing up, and was already considered a part of the family.The two had tea in the living room, after which Riette went for a stroll in the woodlands of the Herhardt estate. Matthias wouldn\u2019t return until nightfall, and it would take some time for the servants to organise Riette\u2019s belongings. Thus, curiosity got the better of him. Riette decided to set out for a special occasion: to meet the elusive child who lived in the woods, Leyla. In other words, the woman who was wreaking havoc in Matthias and Claudine\u2019s once orderly life.Riette knew the child, but he had never spared her a single glance. To him, she was just one of many in the bevy of servants who took up residence in Arvis. He sympathised with her plight and thought of her as quite a pretty girl, but that was all. So imagine Riette\u2019s surprise when he discovered that the woman Matthias had taken an interest in was Leyla Lewellin.Scandalous affairs between aristocrats and their servants were nothing new, but if the aristocrat were to be Duke Herhardt, the story would take on a life of its own. Even if it was just a passing fancy.\u2018Duke Herhardt lied.\u2019As the gardener\u2019s cabin appeared on the horizon, Riette reminisced about that evening last summer when Claudine had abruptly brought up Matthias.\u2018He lied in order to separate Leyla from the doctor\u2019s son.\u2019Claudine had smiled, but Riette saw through her facade when he caught a glimpse of her frightening, icy gaze.\u2018The blue-blooded Matthias von Herhardt lied and schemed just to have that pathetic orphan. Can you believe it, Riette?\u2019 Claudine scoffed.\u2018What kind of lies did he spew?\u2019 Riette had asked, but Claudine had given no further explanation.\u2018I hope he gets her as soon as possible.\u2019Claudine looked out her window impassively, as if nothing had happened. The long, summer sunset split the skyline beyond Count Brandt\u2019s estate like a blade of gold.\u2018He needs to have her in order to dispose of her at the earliest.\u2019Claudine muttered with a look of boredom sketched on her face, as if she were a spectator of a third-rate, low-class performance.Riette could peer right into her mind. She didn\u2019t look jealous of Leyla Lewellin. She simply portrayed slight dismay and scorn at her noble fianc\u00e9\u2019s lowly inclinations.Rather, if Claudine had been jealous or distressed, Riette would have asked her to marry him instead of getting tied to a marriage that would\u2019ve made her miserable. However, Claudine was adamant that marrying Matthias would be the only way for her to receive the happiness she so desired.That day, the two of them had sat down for tea and chatted pleasantly, later enjoying their dinner in the same amicable atmosphere. The following morning, Riette had left the Brandt estate with Claudine standing at the door until his car was out of sight.\u2018Why is that memory persisting and becoming a lingering regret?\u2019A forlorn laugh escaped Riette\u2019s lips just as he arrived in front of the log cabin. A forest trail linked the hedgeless hunting grounds and the small cottage.Every passing second, the glorious lamp of heaven leisurely dripped gold onto the glittering river. As the sun slowly set beyond the horizon, the lighting inside the house dimmed down. Instead of leaving, though, Riette decided to wait. With his back resting comfortably against the porch railing, he looked up at the deciduous branches.Riette Lindman harboured feelings for someone who would never be miserable because of love. And he knew well that the woman he loved was the root of his woes.Yet, Riette enjoyed having a simple and carefree life, so he was willing to embrace his tragic love with ease. He didn\u2019t mind providing Claudine with some fun and helping her through his pranks.Just when he was about to light a cigarette, Riette suddenly heard footsteps coming from the other side of the forest trail. Sounds of conversation floated down the path.He shifted his attention to the direction of the distant sounds and took a long drag of his cigarette. He then exhaled a cloud of smoke as he kept waiting. Before long, a bear-like man and a woman half his size appeared before him. They stopped short of the entrance when they noticed Riette.With a grin pasted on his face, Riette approached the pair. The gardener blurted out a greeting upon recognizing the man and the petite lady next to him bowed her head.\u201cHello there, little forest bird girl.\u201dRiette greeted her calmly, similar to the time he watched her cry as she buried the bird that Matthias had slain.\u201cAh. Should I say bird lady now? Or bird teacher?\u201dLeyla\u2019s eyes glinted in suspicion behind her glasses, her brows furrowing as she processed his nonsense.Riette\u2019s impression of Leyla Lewellin remained unchanged. She was certainly pretty, but not stunningly so that it would dazzle the men around her. Yet, he seemed to have an inkling of how she managed to tickle the fancy of the doctor\u2019s son and his very own noble cousin.\u201cAnyway, nice to meet you, Leyla.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cBe careful of Marquis Lindman.\u201dIt was a severe warning when coming from Bill Remmer, who was glaring at something towards the end of the table. Leyla giggled placing down the pot of freshly cooked stew in the middle of the table.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a laughing matter. Don\u2019t just take it lightly\u201d\u201cUncle.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe that lazy flirt just came out for a walk this far.\u201dBill bit the loaf roughly, tearing it into smaller pieces.\u201cHe greeted you and prattled on about pointless things. It\u2019s extremely suspicious so you should be more careful.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201dLeyla readily replied, knowing his nagging would never end if she didn\u2019t comply. At her half-hearted response, Bill was unconvinced.\u201cKeep my words in mind, Leyla. Not all aristocrats are as decent and dignified as Duke Herhardt.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Huh, what?\u201dLeyla\u2019s forehead scrunched up in the midst of her inadvertent nodding. Bill\u2019s exaggerated reverence of Duke Herhardt left her speechless; but she could not dissent because except for her, everyone else viewed Duke Herhardt in such light.Leyla just kept nodding as she hurriedly ate her bread, keeping her opinions to herself. Nevertheless, memories of that indecent, undignified man became more vivid. She started coughing, choking on her bread as she remembered the offensive bows and expensive pens he sent to her in school.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Leyla shook her head. \u201cI was hungry, but ate too fast just now.\u201d She took off her glasses, and wiped away the tears that resulted from her violent coughs.Bill burst out laughing as he watched her. \u201cAt moments like this, would you still seem like a child.\u201dHe had a chastising tone, but Bill\u2019s smile said otherwise.\u201cEat some more. But carefully this time.\u201dBill took a big serving of meat, placing it one by one on Leyla\u2019s plate. Then another. The food piled up higher everytime Bill moved his hands.\u201cThis is too much!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know? I like children who eat like cows.\u201d Bill, like always, refused to listen to Leyla\u2019s objections.\u201cI am no longer a child.\u201dLeyla declared , yet Bill\u2019s only response was adding one more piece of meat onto her plate.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Their balmy evening was spent chatting and laughing at the table. Leyla found it difficult to eat like a cow; but she tried to eat enough, to please her uncle.Leyla washed the dishes as Bill Remmer mended the squeaky desk chair. Afterwards, the two of them sat on the porch, warm mugs of coffee in hand, and viewed the falling russet leaves . The wind brought on a palpable chill, but Bill and Leyla would continue their day-end conversations for as long as they could until winter arrived.\u201cGood night, Leyla.\u201dBill gave his rudimentary but warm goodbye before entering his room.\u201cYou too, Uncle. Good night.\u201dLeyla\u2019s lips held a gentle smile, as usual. Her bubbly voice had the essence of a sliver of light flowing through the gap of a curtain.After returning to her room, Leyla sat on the chair Uncle Bill had fixed for her and corrected her students\u2019 test papers. Later, she read some mystery novels borrowed from the library and replied to letters from friends who had become teachers at other schools.After finishing the last letter, she suddenly remembered the pen the Duke had given her as she closed the lid of her own worn-out one.Leyla was silent for a brief moment as she looked blankly into space, before deciding to open the desk drawer. The pen she had reluctantly brought home was still neatly stowed in its box.\u2018I knew it.\u2019Growing up, Leyla had heard many a tongue-click whenever she made a mistake or tried to be more well-behaved than her classmates.\u2018As one would expect from a child who grew up without parents.\u2019The remarks she\u2019d grown used to hearing always carried one of the two emotions: scorn or pity.Leyla always wondered why she was singled out for blame every time, even though the other children made the same mistakes as her. Nevertheless, as she grew older, Leyla realized that society\u2019s rules didn\u2019t apply equally to all of its members.So she wanted to do better.Even if she couldn\u2019t be perfect, she was determined to live a life where she didn\u2019t garner sympathy from others. Every time she faced the world\u2019s harsh standards, Leyla tried her best to stand her ground and fight. She wanted to live a respectable life for Uncle Bill, who had cared, loved, and raised her in all the ways that count.After she made up her mind, she pulled the pen out of the box without hesitation. Her hand reached for a piece of paper to wrap the package in.Leyla meticulously packed the parcel and scrawled down the address using an old fountain pen. The receiver was the owner of Arvis, Duke Matthias von Herhardt. As for the sender, she wrote down the stranger\u2019s name and address from whom she had received the pen.When dawn came, Leyla stuffed the box into her bag and set off for the day\u2019s work. She had to leave the house earlier than usual to make a quick trip to the post office in the nearby hamlet.After returning the present, Leyla felt like a heavy weight had been lifted off her chest.Leyla believed it was over now.She was sure of it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though he wasn\u2019t a big drinker, the minibar in Matthias\u2019s room was always stocked with fine liquors.\u201cIt\u2019s not nice to overlook fine liqueurs in this way.\u201dWith a vague grin, Riette took a bottle of alcohol and went back to the front of the table. Matthias\u2019 expression was bland as always\u2014he didn\u2019t give a fig about what his cousin did.The soulful melody of a piano played from the phonograph, perfectly harmonized with the crackling of the logs burning in the fireplace. Riette filled a glass with the liquor from the bottle, handing it to his cousin. Matthias took the glass gracefully, his movement in sync with the notes filling the room.Leaning against the couch, Riette observed him as if he were a stranger. Matthias was staring at the rim of his glass, lost in thought as a canary, which now felt like a part of the bedroom, played happily beside him.\u2018Your cousin is a demon of a gentleman.\u2019The reputation of Captain Herhardt, spreading ever wider with each social event held, suddenly rose in Riette\u2019s mind.Matthias had never spoken about his time serving on the military front\u2014not from modesty, as one might have expected, but from feeling that his accomplishments during that period of time had no meaning. Instead, word of Captain Herhardt\u2019s heroics spread through the lips of other aristocratic officers who had battled beside him during the war.Riette might not have participated in the war, but the narratives he had heard allowed him to visualize Matthias\u2019s prowess on the battlefield as if he had seen it firsthand. Neither a warmongering idealist like his fellow aristocratic officers, nor someone steeped with the boredom that came from the routine of the military, Matthias\u2019 ethos as a soldier-at-arms was noticeably different from his brethren.His name was etched in gold ink, illustrating his brilliant achievements during his time in uniform. Yet, Matthias deemed it all of little importance. Every time people gossiped about Matthias\u2019 military prowess, they invariably concluded their stories with an incredulous sigh :\u2018\u2026. I don\u2019t understand him.\u2019Riette knew better than anyone else how that discouraging remark was the most apt description of Matthias von Herhardt.\u2018I really don\u2019t understand.\u2019Each person had sighed once they uttered those words, much like how Riette was sighing at the moment.\u2018I don\u2019t understand him.\u2019He had known Matthias von Herhardt all his life, yet the only conclusion that Riette could draw about him was this\u2014 the man resembled a rainbow amalgamation that blended into a murky color with a white finish.A noble aristocrat. A worthy successor. A good cousin. A man of honour. Every facet of him was prominent, yet nothing was discernible, even when all of the facets were arranged together.Some praised Duke Herhardt for his self-learnt mastery of self suppression, especially when it came to carrying out his duties, but Riette was skeptical of their analysis. As far as he could tell, there had never been anything to suppress in the first place.But how would Duke Herhardt act towards Leyla Lewellin?More than a little tipsy, Riette grinned as Matthias gave him a sidelong glance. The canary was now sitting still on Matthias\u2019s shoulder, something that Riette believed would make Matthias annoyed, but the man looked unfazed instead.\u201cHow long do you plan to be the owner of that bird?\u201d\u201cFor as long as I want to.\u201dMatthias\u2019s answer was quick and resolute. The bird fluttered up to his shoulder, rubbing its beak against his suspender as he took a sip from the glass he was holding.\u201cWhen will that be?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dPlacing his glass down delicately, Matthias leant aslant against the armrest. The warm light from the fireplace reflected off the onyx buttons on his cuffs, gleaming a deep black in the light.\u201cAren\u2019t you curious? Why I came to Arvis, what I\u2019m planning to do, that kind of thing.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dRiette\u2019s visit to Arvis that came out of the blue, and his impromptu weeks-long stay came as no surprise. Yet Matthias\u2019s reply was indifferent, as if he found what he was listening to was nothing more than a pathetic affair.\u201cWhatever, you jerk.\u201d Riette laughed, downing the last of his drink.\u2018Is it lust?\u2019Riette looked at Matthias contemplatively. He knew well\u2014men had the instinctive desire to own beautiful women. Despite the lack of emotion Matthias externally, that didn\u2019t mean his instinct was gone. It was just a hunch, but Riette felt that it was a reasonable assumption to make with what he knew about his cousin.But why the orphan?\u00a0Duke Herhardt was always unsympathetic to women who were more beautiful and noble than the orphan.The more Riette thought about it, the more it felt like he was in a labyrinth, increasingly confused by its twisting turns. Riette shoved the thought away as Matthias whistled. The bird, which had been bouncing on the table, flew over to Matthias immediately.Gazing idly at the bird, Riette whistled towards it, tune longer and kitschy. Unfortunately for Riette, the bird showed no sign of coming towards him. It sat on the back of Matthias\u2019s hand, tilting its head up towards Matthias instead.\u201cWhat the\u2026. Can a bird recognize its owner?\u201dRiette scoffed as he recalled the woman who had kept a wary watch on him.He didn\u2019t view Leyla Lewellin as an elusive woman. No matter how long it took, Riette believed that she would open up to him with time, just like she did to the doctor\u2019s son and Duke Herhardt. Not just that, but Riette knew Matthias von Herhardt would abandon the orphan eventually for the sake of his marriage with Claudine, an end result that Claudine had long hoped for.\u201cShall we go hunting on the weekend?\u201dRiette asked, refilling the glass. After a moment of thought, Matthias gave a surprising answer.\u201cGo alone. I\u2019ll have it prepared for you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dEyes wide, Riette stared at Matthias. For as long as he could remember, Matthias had never turned down a hunting offer.\u201cNo way, are you serious?\u201dA knock on the door interrupted Riette\u2019s question. The butler, Hessen, stepped inside the room.\u201cThe mail has arrived, master.\u201dWith a parcel and a tray of letters at hand, he moved smoothly towards Matthias.\u2018Why does the butler have to come in at this hour for such a trifling notice?\u2019Riette flashed the butler an annoyed glance. The butler\u2019s lips were pressed flat, a clear signal that Riette had overextended his stay.\u201cWell then. See you tomorrow, Duke.\u201dToasting a goodbye with the glass of alcohol in his hand, Riette left Matthias\u2019s bedroom. After Riette\u2019s steps had faded, Hessen opened his mouth, saying;\u201cMaster, the parcel has returned.\u201d\u201cParcel?\u201dHessen awkwardly gave a small box to Matthias. The sender\u2019s name and location were unfamiliar.\u201cWho is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my relative. I used this name and address to follow your order.\u201d\u201cMy order? Ah.\u201dMatthias\u2019s mind flashed back to the week before, when he had ordered Hessen to send Leyla Lewellin a good pen. Understanding clicked into place at the memory.\u201cM.. master\u2026..\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Matthias cut Hessen\u2019s words short. \u201cYou may leave.\u201dHe tapped his finger on the box he had taken. Hessen stared like he wanted to say something, but followed the Duke\u2019s orders without further questions.Matthias rose from his seat once the door had closed. The box was held in his hands, ripped box\u2019s wrapper burned into embers in the hearth.Inside the opened box was a note and pen, neatly arranged. Slowly, Matthias read the message, taking his time to read the few scrawled words on the scrawled words on the scrap of paper tucked between his fingers.[Come to think of it, it was my fault for losing my pen.][It was my fault that I fell, didn\u2019t properly pack things, and didn\u2019t get it back on time. You don\u2019t have to take responsibility..][There\u2019s no reason for me to receive this item, so I\u2019ll return it to you.]There was no name written on the message, but Matthias knew who it was anyway. Leyla\u2019s note was full of familiar conceit. The more Matthias read, the more slanted his eyebrows went, until eventually he snorted and flashed a grimace, edges of his lips curved up in anger.As he watched the fire in the fireplace devour the crumpled note, shiny new pen and the parcel box they were originally wrapped in, self content, anger, shame and laughter loomed one after another on Matthias\u2019s face as he watched the shimmering flame.His expression faded back to neutrality, vanished moments after the vivid emotions mixed into one.The only thing left of his features was the very picture of calmness and serenity marred only with the shadow of the lamplight growing over it.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The class had ended early, but Leyla was still quite busy.It was the day of the school\u2019s council meeting. The members were going to discuss the issue of the school\u2019s old, small building, which needed to be expanded.As the person in charge of arranging the conference room, Leyla set up the chairs and desks in accordance to the number of people attending, preparing simple writing instruments and notepads for everyone to use before the meeting began.\u201cMiss Lewellin, are you done?\u201dMrs. Grever asked in a hasty fashion. Smiling, Leyla looked around the conference room for one last time and nodded decisively.\u201cYes, I\u2019m done.\u201d\u201cThen, let\u2019s get going. The sponsors are here.\u201d\u201cAlready?\u201dLeyla scrambled to get ready, following Mrs Grever as soon as she was done. The sponsors\u2019 extravagant carriages and limousines formed a long line as they entered the school\u2019s front gate.An ominous premonition flashed through her. She shook her head, as if to deny the feeling. In the numerous times she had read the list of sponsors attending the meeting, Herhardt\u2019s name had never appeared in the lineup. She had nothing to be apprehensive about.Nothing to worry about save for the gift she had returned to the Duke, that was, and the most likely cause for Leyla\u2019s erratically pounding heart.Several days had passed since she had returned the gift. The Duke had made no mention of her\u2014no visits, no interrogations, no harassments, unlike his actions from before. Leyla, who had been terrified of encountering such a mishap, could already feel her guard going down. She might have hurt the Duke\u2019s pride, but it was something that had to be done once anyway.No matter how irrelevant their relationship was, Leyla had a dim hunch about him. She was aware of the Duke\u2019s desire for her and knew she could get harmed.Leyla despised him for every single thing.She hated Matthias von Herhardt.She hated his selfish desires. She hated the repercussions she would face because of his freakish obsession. Leyla had long since lost the desire to be embroiled in irrelevant affairs, and more importantly, she didn\u2019t want to get hurt, especially by the Duke, who had gotten wind of her heart after she had returned the gift. As the aristocratic man remained silent, Leyla took it to mean that he had accepted her rejection.Slowly sweeping down her chest, Leyla stood still at the end of the line to greet the sponsors. The autumnal rain had chilled the air. She had been concerned about the poor attendance rate caused by the bad weather, but all the sponsors who had promised to attend were fortunately present.Leyla performed her job well, smiling and bowing politely to everyone she met. She prepared the tea and waited quietly as the meeting started. Leyla\u2019s first council meeting would be considered successful only when she escorted the sponsors off the premises.The headmaster turned around as the last sponsor, a lady, drove through the school\u2019s entrance. A black car that had clearly been in a battle with the heavy downpours squeaked to a stop just as the other teachers were about to do the same.\u201cMy god! Duke!\u201dThe headmaster\u2019s countenance changed from a confused expression to a beaming grin very quickly.Face prepared to smile and greet the guest, Leyla\u2019s lips quivered.\u2018No way.\u2019Leyla blinked. She blinked rapidly, nervously, as if to deny what she was seeing. Standing there in a distinctive, straight posture under a parapluie held by an assistant was Duke von Herhardt.His eyes wandered through the line of teachers, stopping at Leyla\u2019s withered face.When their eyes met, the Duke smiled.For those who did nothing more than glance, it was a smile that could only be called gentle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She laughed, she talked, and she moved around, yet her focus was entirely on one person\u2014the one and only Duke Herhardt.\u2018What is he doing here?\u2019Anyone who caught sight of Leyla\u2019s eyes would have to be blind not to notice the mix of curiosity and fear in them, as she studied Matthias\u2019s face intently.Matthias attended the meeting as if his sole purpose was to mock her. The Principal, however, was excited with the surprise visit from the Duke, and even more delighted when Matthias agreed to develop the school further.Unknown to the Principal, Matthias wasn\u2019t interested in anything related to the school. The same went for the meeting. What he was interested in was the woman seated in the far corner, trembling as she glanced periodically at him when she thought he wasn\u2019t looking.\u201cMiss Lewellin.\u201dMatthias\u2019s smile softened at the sound of a teacher calling her name.\u201cMiss Lewellin?\u201dThe teacher hesitantly called out her name again.As one, everyone in the conference room turned to look at the owner of the name. Matthias followed suit. Leyla was standing still as stone in the corner of the classroom, much like a child being reprimanded. As Matthias continued to stare, Leyla fidgeted nervously, not quite managing to look away from his gaze.\u201cAh\u2026..\u201dLeyla hesitated under the weight of their stares. Full of reluctance, she raised her head, mumbling,\u201cP-Pardon me\u2026\u201dThe woman trembling and bowing her head repeatedly in apology was the opposite of the woman he remembered; an outspoken, fearless woman who always acted courageously in front of him. It was pathetic. The more Matthias saw her low-spirited attitude, the more Matthias could feel his temper fraying, thread by thread.\u201cNow, Miss Lewellin..\u2026..\u201d\u201cPlease continue.\u201dMatthias interrupted the frowning Principal as she opened her mouth to complain, voice blunt and gruff.\u201cWith the expansion proposal.\u201dThe Principal shot him a look, eyes wide. He smiled graciously at her, baring his teeth.\u201cI\u2019d like to hear more about it in detail.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dIt took only a mention of the new building for the Principal to regain her excitement. Leyla\u2019s clumsiness was already fading from the Principal\u2019s mind, replaced instead with new architecture and expenses.As the discussion between Matthias and the Principal continued, Leyla helped Mrs. Grever prepare the tea.\u2018Get your head straight, Leyla.\u2019She told herself, doing her best to put herself into a calm, trancelike state in an effort to control her nerves\u2018Stop acting like a fool and behave naturally.\u2019Alas, her desperate wish was not to come true. It vanished into thin air without fail the moment she approached Duke Herhardt.Leyla\u2019s hands shook with nerves as she held the teacup. Matthias looked at her as the teacup as it clattered on the saucer, following her every move. The more he stared at her, the more emotions hopeless she felt, eyes glazing over with a mix of fear and confusion that increased with every step she took towards him.Matthias had initially attended the school meeting with the expectation of seeing an incredibly flustered Leyla. However, at the sight of her misery, the emotion in his heart was not happiness as he originally thought, but a distorted sort of pleasure.\u0362Matthias looked away. Leyla appeared to be less intimidated by him if he didn\u2019t look at her directly. Although Matthias still had hopes of seeing her spill the tea in her fluster, it wouldn\u2019t do for her to be embarrassed in public, fun as it would have been to see her face grow red in fluster.While Mathias had casted his gaze elsewhere, he caught a glimpse of Leyla\u2019s hands out of the corner of his eye, white and smooth like the skin of a wax doll as she placed the teacup onto the table in front of him without spilling a drop.Leyla walked back to the corner of the classroom as the meeting continued.Her hands had a sensitive touch, with slender fingers and petal-like fingernails that sparkled at the tip. Matthias\u2019s mind strayed constantly to the image of Leyla\u2019s hands during the long speech and the Principal\u2019s appeal, at how frantic and harmless those hands had seemed even as Leyla used them to pummel and scratch him on that memorable summer afternoon. How small and delicate her hands had been as he\u2019d grabbed them and intertwined them with his own.Lost in the lust-tinged memory of touching Leyla\u2019s lips while clasping her dirt-covered hands to the ground, Matthias barely noticed the ending of the meeting.The school expansion would proceed as agreed by all sponsors. Satisfied with the arrangement, the sponsors thus headed back to their residences.\u201cMay I take a look around the classroom for a while?\u201dMatthias politely asked for permission from the Principal. The Principal, who was already in high spirits after the successful meeting, would have seen no reason to refuse, especially when it was a request made from the sponsor who had made the most generous donations to the school.\u201cOf course, Duke.\u201d The Principal said immediately. But the other sponsors are returning, so I\u2019m afraid I have no choice but to bid them farewell.\u2026.\u201dTroubled, the Principal glanced around the classroom. Her eyes rested on Leyla, who was standing awkwardly in the corner of the classroom.\u201cWould you mind if I assign Miss Lewellin to guide you around?\u201dIt was the answer he had been hoping for. Matthias rose steadily from his seat.\u201cNot at all. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d***Leyla was in charge of the lower classroom on the first level, positioned at the very end of the school corridor. As the students had returned home earlier in the day, the heater had been switched off, leaving the classroom cold and humid.Leyla switched on the light. She walked stiffly around the classroom, expecting her role as a guide to end once she showed him around. Matthias conducted himself perfectly as a keen sponsor, checking over the school\u2019s amenities, and thanks to that, Leyla was able to guide him around without too much fear and stress.\u2018Just a little more.\u2019\u201cThis is where the young students stu\u2026.\u201dSlam!The door slammed shut with a thunderous sound, cutting Leyla\u2019s explanation short. She flinched at the sound, back ramrod straight with shock as she whipped her head to the door. Standing there was Matthias, leisurely standing against the closed door.\u201cThis must be Miss Lewellin\u2019s classroom.\u201dMatthias broke the silence as he carefully observed the teacher\u2019s desk. Her belongings were placed neatly on its surface, with her coat hanging over the chair\u2019s backrest.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right, Duke.\u201dLeyla retreated a reasonable distance away to the window with small steps. Her heart was pounding in her ears, like the insistent heavy drumming of rain beating upon a window pain.She stuck close to the desk near the window, unable to do anything but fidget helplessly as Matthias narrowed the gap between them.\u201cPfft..why are you scared? Have I ever said I would hurt you?\u201dMatthias laughed, but his quips failed to provide her with any comfort. Gaze calm, smile sweet as honey, the Duke was mean as he watched her.\u201cWe\u2019re in school, Duke. This isn\u2019t Arvis.\u201d\u201cYes, we are in school.\u201d Matthias walked up to her without stopping. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a patron of this school. Is there a reason why I can\u2019t come?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t even tell me that you were going to attend, so why would\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you take me for a fool, Leyla?\u201dMatthias stopped at a distance of about two steps away from her. He slowly clasped his hands behind his back.\u201cIf you had known earlier that I were to be attending the meeting, you wouldn\u2019t have been here. You would have avoided me at all costs.\u201dUnable to refute his words, Leyla moistened her lips. \u201cIf you have anything else to say, please say it at Arvis.\u201d\u201cWell, Leyla. I think it will be much better here.\u201dMatthias smirked. He stepped forward to the teacher\u2019s desk as Leyla desperately stared out of the window at the hallway, hoping against hope of finding someone for help.\u201cWe\u2019re able to have a conversation now because of this classroom.\u201dMatthias\u2019s words were light. Leyla gasped for air, audible against the pleasant sound of rain against glass. Looking away from her, he moved towards the desk, running his eyes over the neatly organised items on the desk.A quill pen and blotting paper.An exquisite porcelain doll.A pile of unused pen nibs in an empty chocolate box.His eyes paused on the three ink bottles placed at the end of the desk.Black. Blue. Red.With each color he saw, Matthias\u2019 lips widened into a grin. He reached out to the bottle nearest to him, the one filled with red ink.After much contemplation, Leyla bowed her head. Matthias was simply examining the table, Leyla thought. She didn\u2019t want him to see her reactions.Please.\u00a0Leyla held her hands in prayer, hoping for the return of the other teachers, who had left to send the sponsors off. Meanwhile, Matthias had opened the lid of the ink bottle. Leyla heard the sound of the lid falling , and the movement of the Duke finally caught her attention.Hysteria hit her instantly.\u201cD\u2026duke!\u201dMatthias had sidled up to her chair. As if he were serving wine from a decanter, he gracefully tilted the bottle, pouring a stream of red ink onto her coat as Leyla screamed in shock and alarm.Matthias backed away elegantly as Leyla rushed towards her ink stained coat, grasping the half-empty in bottle lightly in his hand.Whipping out a handkerchief, Leyla hurriedly tried to blot off the ink staining her light grey coat.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing!\u201dLeyla wailed, but Matthias appeared calm.\u201cTaking responsibility.\u201dMatthias\u2019s nonsensical reply rendered Leyla silent, mouth agape, lips flushing scarlet.Eyes locked onto her lips, Matthias sauntered over to Leyla with the bottle of red ink in his hands\u2014she barely had time to react before he upended the bottle over her shoulders. Ink splashed onto her blouse, her skirt, her pumps, staining them a bright red.The argument ended with Matthias pouring every last drop of the ink onto her clothes. The glass bottle fell to the floor with a loud thump, rolling to a stop at his shoes. Their polish had been smeared by the bright red ink as well, but Matthias gave no reaction.Leyla was so angry that she wanted to scream. Her mouth opened, but nothing came out. Frozen still, she gasped as if she were full of fear, the ink smeared over her upper body glistening red like blood as she held back the urge to strangle something.\u201cWhat to do, Leyla?\u201dGlancing at the mess Matthias himself had caused, he narrowed his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll have to take responsibility.\u201dDespite the tragedy, his lips curled up with pleasure.***\u201cThank you very much for your kind understanding of Miss Lewellin\u2019s mistakes.\u201dWalking by Matthias\u2019s side, the Principal apologised once again.After escorting the sponsors out of the school, the Principal and other teachers had rushed to see Duke Herhardt, only to be left dumbfounded by the scene they witnessed inside the classroom\u2014their youngest teacher bathed pitifully in red ink with a very concerned-looking Duke.\u201cIt was my mistake,\u201d Matthias repeated. \u201cI dropped the ink bottle on her by accident; I really should apologise to Miss Lewellin.\u201d\u201cEven so, your grace, it is your first time in this place. I apologise for failing to show you the better side of our school.\u201d\u201cI had quite a pleasurable visit here.\u201dOnce they reached the school entrance, Matthias bade farewell to the panicked Principal.\u201cMiss Lewellin, please come along with me.\u201dHis gaze shifted from the Principal to Leyla, who was scrubbing at the stain on her blouse. The more she tried to scrub it off, the more the ink smeared, until her clothes looked like they belonged to a person who had suffered grievous injury.\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201dLeyla\u2019s voice trembled with anger. Despite the fear coursing through her, she gave Matthias a stern glare. Matthias favored her current attitude much better than the low-spirited behavior from earlier, even if her eyes were still filled with fear.\u201cMiss Lewellin. Please, just go along with the Duke. He\u2019s trying to apologise.\u201dThe Principal chuckled as if it was a trivial matter, but her eyes, full of nerves, told a different story.\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring your bicycle today, and it\u2019s going to rain! Do as the Duke says.\u201d\u201cEven if the rain falls, I have an umbrella, so I can walk back home.\u201dAt Leyla\u2019s stubborn refusal, the Principal\u2019s complexion grew even more wane.\u201cI do understand you, Ms Lewellin.\u201d Matthias said, smiling. \u201cHowever, will you not scare the passers-by that see you walking in the rain dressed as you are right now? The police officers would appear, thinking there might\u2019ve been a murder case.\u201dLeyla pursed her lips and looked down at her clothes as everyone in the crowd laughed uproariously at Matthias\u2019s joke. Like it or not, what he said had been nothing but the truth. The red ink stains on her white blouse did indeed make her look like she had just committed a gruesome murder.At a sharp glare from the Principal, Mrs Grever approached Leyla, who was stiff as a board. Getting into the car, Matthias , calmly watched the scene.Full of resignation, Leyla allowed herself to be dragged and loaded into the car like luggage. Matthias moved to the side, giving her a comfortable amount of space to sit in.The car\u2019s engine roared to life the moment the door clicked shut.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She clutched at her bag and coat, grip tightening until her knuckles turned white.\u201cMr. Evers,\u201d She began, addressing the aide seated in the front. \u201cThis road-\u201c,\u201cLeyla, I believe I\u2019ve told you.\u201d Matthias abruptly cut her off. \u201cI will take responsibility.\u201dLeyla raised her face, shooting Matthias an angry glare.\u00a0\u2018Take responsibility?\u2019\u00a0His words replayed in her mind, and her hands clenched into fists with anger. She hadn\u2019t heard anything more nonsensical.\u201cI ruined your clothes on purpose. It is only natural that I should be held accountable for it.\u201cNo. You don\u2019t have to. I\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you insisting that I am not in the wrong?\u201d Matthias repeated tenaciously, despite the presence of his aide and the driver, who were seated stiffly in the front of the car.Leyla grabbed her skirt. She took a deep breath. No matter how hard she scrubbed, the red stains on her hands and clothes stayed stubbornly on, as if they were mocking her fury.\u2018That gift\u2026 I should immediately throw it away.\u2019Leyla bit her lip. Even if it was utterly foolish to believe that refusing the Duke\u2019s gift would sever the relationship between them, she couldn\u2019t help but think it.Unable to deny how lost she currently felt, Leyla wanted to cry from shame.\u2018How-\u2018Hoping against hope for an answer, she glanced at the Duke. The look he gave her reflected the bleak cityscape, cold and filled with a tinge of frustration. Hopes dashed, she looked away, breaking her gaze.As the sun hesitantly peeked through a thick layer of clouds, the car came to a stop at a street filled with high end stores and upscale boutiques.The driver and the aide both exited the car without a word, leaving only the mismatched pair behind. The instant they had left the car, the air in the car became heavier, temperature dropping by a few degrees. Leyla immediately tensed her shoulders.\u201cI-I\u2019m going to leave now.\u201dGrabbing at her umbrella, Leyla hurriedly spun to the side. Before her hand could reach the car door, Matthias forcefully grabbed her wrist.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cHome. I don\u2019t need any clothes. I\u2019m going home!\u201dMatthias kept his grip on her wrist without much effort as Leyla instinctively struggled to pull her hand away.\u201cDon\u2019t be selfish, Leyla.\u201d He said gruffly. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you taking Bill Remmer into consideration?\u201d Matthias scoffed, loosening his grip on her wrist.\u201cW-what? What do you mean?\u201dThe mention of her uncle was enough to make her struggles stop.\u201cHow heartbroken would Mr Remmer be if he sees you like this?\u201d\u201cI am surprised that the noble Duke Herhardt is concerned about my uncle after he did this to me.\u201d\u201cWell, Mr Remmer has worked as a gardener for our household for decades. It is only right that I worry for him.\u201dGrip tightening on her wrist once more, Matthias pulled her close to him, so close that he could feel her breath against his face.\u201cAre you confident that you can come up with a good excuse when Mr Remmer asks about what happened to you, upon seeing this pitiful appearance?\u201d\u201cO- of course.\u201d Leyla stammered. Matthias\u2019s hand swiftly grasped her cheek as she tried to free herself from him, leaning in close to her small ears.\u201cUnfortunately, Leyla, I am fully responsible for you.\u201d He whispered. \u201cAfter all, all your misfortune is caused by me.\u201dMatthias\u2019s gaze was intense, filled with the obsession she knew he had towards her. Leyla desperately tried to break her gaze, but to no avail.\u201cIt is my responsibility to hand you back to Mr. Remmer in perfect condition. Even a single blemish on your clothes will not be tolerated.\u201d\u201cN- No need! You don\u2019t have to! Let me go! I\u2026\u201d\u201cThink about it, Leyla. There\u2019s nothing wrong with accepting my apologies and receiving your rightful compensation. Don\u2019t you think your act of disobedience and stubbornness would appear quite weird?\u201dMatthias\u2019s solemn gaze shifted towards the window. The driver and the aide were standing outside, ignorant of the quarrel taking place inside the car. \u201cThey might think you\u2019re a petulant mistress.\u201dExtremely offended by his vulgar joke, Leyla frowned fiercely.Releasing her hand, Matthias smirked, reaching out to knock on the window. Mark Evers nimbly turned around, opening the back door. Leyla quickly leapt out of the door like a bird that was freed from its cage, unwilling to waste her newfound chance for freedom.Matthias glanced at her ruined bag and coat. Gesturing to Mark Evers, Matthias gave brief instructions to the aide, closing the door once he was done.He resumed his staring out of the window. His blue eyes narrowed as Evers attempted to drape his coat over the freezing Leyla. Before Evers could make a move, a faint knock on the window interrupted him. Pulling his coat back on, he swiftly re-opened the back door.Matthias took off his coat and handed it to Evers, who obediently took the coat without question.The door slammed shut once again and the only sound inside the car was the raindrops hitting the windows.Matthias\u2019s steady gaze never left Leyla, watching as his aide wrapped her, who was too dazed to realise whom the coat belonged to, in his coat.Soon, the driver returned and started the car\u2019s engine. Leyla followed Mark Evers into the boutique\u2019s fitting room, her hands tightly gripping Matthias\u2019s coat.Matthias\u2019s gaze lingered on her for a long time.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cWhy are we going in there?\u201dLeyla came to a stop as she glimpsed the luxurious hotel she had been given the privilege to attend last summer, when she had tea with Claudine and Matthias.\u201cIt was the Duke\u2019s command, Miss Lewellin.\u201d, Mark Evers explained, smiling. \u201cThe Duke informed me that he will only return to Arvis after treating Miss Lewellin to a cup of tea as an apology.\u201d\u201cN- no, it\u2019s fine. These clothes are more than enough for an apology.\u201d\u201cMiss Lewellin, it is not for me to decide.\u201d\u201cBut-\u201d\u201cMiss Lewellin, I\u2019m simply following the Duke\u2019s orders.\u201d Mark Evers said, a little baffled by Leyla\u2019s attitude. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make it difficult for me to accomplish those orders.\u201dRunning out of reason to give for her stubbornness, Leyla followed him with heavy steps.\u201cDid you know that the Duke is currently raising a bird just like you, Miss. Lewellin?\u201d Mark Evers blurted out as they entered the hotel lobby. \u201cA tiny, pretty yellow bird.\u201d\u201cA bird? The Duke?\u201d Leyla frowned in disbelief.\u2018That psychotic bird slayer raises a bird?\u2019It was the weirdest thing she\u2019d ever heard, and even more difficult to believe in.\u201cIs he raising it to hunt it?\u201dThe question filled with paranoia left Mark Evers dumbfounded. Before he had a chance to clarify the misunderstanding in his master\u2019s stead, they had already arrived to the entrance of the tearoom.Mark Evers escorted Leyla to Matthias, who was seated near the window overlooking the rainy terrace, promptly leaving the room the moment his job was done.Seeing Leyla standing blankly without moving an inch in front of him, his stern voice rang.\u201cSit down.\u201dReluctantly, Leyla sat down in the chair opposite of him. She removed her coat, revealing a newly bought turquoise velvet dress with shiny pearl buttons adorning its front, and a wide lace collar that was white as snow. It was clear that everything she was wearing was brand new, from her shoes to the stockings that ended mid calf. Her hair had also been done up into an elegant yet natural looking style. Compared to her usual nun-like outfits, Matthias was pleased to see her in a more elegantly styled dress.They were served tea and an assortment of exquisite desserts not long after.\u201cEat.\u201d Matthias ordered while holding his tea cup.Leyla didn\u2019t move, flashing him a look of stern disgust instead.Matthias met her glare headon, as if it held no threat to him. \u201cShall I feed you?\u201d He asked arrogantly. \u201cI am more than willing to take responsibility for that as well.\u201dAt Matthias\u2019s declaration, Leyla hastily grabbed her fork. She hesitated only a moment before choosing a light pink cream cake.Satisfied by her obedience, Matthias straightened his posture and continued to observe her.\u201cWhat kind of delicacies do you prefer?\u201dMatthias asked curiously, watching her silently savor the cake. She appeared to be a fan of desserts, a fact that was seemingly trivial that nevertheless piqued his interest in her.\u201cSave for the foods I have to eat in front of you, everything is to my liking.\u201d Leyla retorted coldly, fiddling with the fork handle. Despite her attempt to sound confident, her voice trembled.Matthias\u2019s chuckled, little pearl-like bubbles of sound that were soon muffled by the sound of raindrops splattering against the windowpane. \u201cDid you know that it\u2019s your proud attitude which I am attracted to?\u201d He leaned towards the table, while saying, \u201cMy intrigue of you grows when you\u2019re cocky like this, believe it or not.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you decide to continue to behave like you do now, then I reckon it won\u2019t take long before I am addicted to you,\u201d Matthias scoffed, his voice soft like a bird whistle.Petrified by his words, Leyla found herself leaning back instinctively as he bent closer towards her.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if you acted innocent and docile?\u201d Matthias said, grinning, \u201cThat way, I might grow tired of you.\u201dMatthias leant back in his chair, as if he believed Leyla would fall out of her chair with fear if he moved in closer.After much thought, Leyla placed the fork down. Cheeks flushed, she quickly wiped at her lips with a napkin.\u201cSo, what do you like?\u201d, Matthias asked once again.\u201c\u2026I am not a picky eater.\u201d Leyla replied calmly.It was quite a sight for Matthias to behold, seeing Leyla striving so very hard to keep her \u201ctrue\u201d self under wraps.\u201cReally? Good girl.\u201dAt his remark, Leyla immediately tamped down her ire, although her eyes sparkled with fury, revealing her true emotions.\u2018Let\u2019s see just how long you can act like this.\u2019Matthias devoured the words he wanted to say with a sip of coffee. Just the slightest glance of Leyla glaring with impudence despite shuddering with despair sent him spiralling into madness. Matthias couldn\u2019t stand the thought of anyone else seeing that expression of hers\u2014it gave him a strange sense of superiority, thinking that he was the only person who knew of Leyla Lewellin\u2019s other persona.Leyla was demure and stoic, obediently answering any questions he asked while finishing her food without causing a fuss\u2014completely unlike the usual self that Matthias knew. The only times her facade broke was the occasional glances of discontent she sent his way, and the blush that appeared once or twice as she bit her cream smudged lips.The time they spent together was sweet, if limited, but only obtainable by nefarious means, such as pouring ink onto Leyla\u2019s coat in a mischievous prank. At the realisation, Matthias laughed heartily, only for his pleasure to fade as it dawned on him\u2014he could only give Leyla something by breaking her first.\u2018So, only by hurting you badly will you be mine\u2026..How ridiculous.\u2019He stared possessively at Leyla, eyes gleaming with an odd light as a smile returned to his face. He found it interesting how her docility, instead of dousing his interest in her, only served to drive him crazier instead.\u2018Leyla\u2026. What must I destroy to possess you?\u2019Matthias tilted his head, sinking further into rumination.The sky outside the window was getting dark. Leyla finally turned her head, meeting his gaze. Her eyes looked as if they were softly woven with fine green threads, large and beautiful like emeralds.Entranced in their beauty, he could do nothing but admire her gorgeous eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m glad that you are back to your peak health.\u201d Dr. Etman replied warmly, smiling like his usual kind self.\u201cGiven my old age\u2026it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if my health starts deteriorating.\u201d\u201cPlease, don\u2019t say that.\u201dDr. Etman left his work earlier to re-check Norma\u2019s health.\u00a0 The Duchess had caught a cold and had the potential to become serious considering her youth had passed.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you that this old woman is enjoying these years in good shape. Isn\u2019t that right, Elysee?\u201d She asked her daughter-in-law who had been silently standing next to the doctor the entire time.\u201cOf course!\u201d Elysee von Herhardt agreed, gladly grabbing the chance to praise their family doctor. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well, Dr. Etman.\u201d\u201cThank you, Madam. I must get going now.\u201d Dr. Etman replied as he picked up his already packed medical bag, intending to leave the room.\u201cOh yes, how\u2019s Kyle doing?\u201dThe instant he heard Elysee inquire about his son, Dr. Etman\u2019s eyes twitched, but he quickly regained his calm and replied with a bright smile. \u201cKyle is doing well. He\u2019s currently absorbed in his studies.\u201d\u201cI see. He will be a great doctor in the future since he resembles you a lot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m honored that Madam thinks that way.\u201d\u201cWill he return to Carlsbar during the winter break?\u201d Elysee tried probing.\u201cI don\u2019t believe he has decided yet.\u201d\u201cTrue, he might prefer to stay and mingle with his new friends since it\u2019s his first break and there\u2019s also the option of exploring the south.\u201d\u201cYes, either way, I\u2019d like to respect Kyle\u2019s wishes.\u201d\u201cDo tell me his decision; if he decides to spend his winter vacation in the capital then I\u2019ll introduce him to an excellent social club or if he chooses to go on a trip, I\u2019ll help him in any way I can.\u201dElysee proposed without hesitation, leaving the other two surprised at her unexpected consideration and kindness, especially Dr. Etman.\u201cPlease send my regards to Mrs. Etman as well.\u201d Elysee added as she accompanied him towards the bedroom door.Hearing Elysee\u2019s considerate words even though her relationship with his wife had soured, a content smile spread across Dr. Etman\u2019s face.Following his departure, the maids also stepped out of the room, and the Herhardt\u2019s duo were left unattended.\u201cYou\u2019re quite attentive to Kyle, Elysee.\u201d Norma faintly praised her daughter-in-law as she leaned back onto the soft cushion with a tender smile on her face.\u201cAfter contemplating for a while, I have realized that your words were indeed right. \u201d Elysee expressed further, \u201cIf Kyle becomes an excellent doctor, he could be useful to our Matthias. Mrs. Etman and I have grown apart, but I\u2019m trying to respect the Etmans as our family doctor.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you agreed.\u201dNorma replied with an eager nod. Kyle Etman was to replace his father\u2019s role as the Herhardt family\u2019s doctor after he graduated, if everything went as predicted.The gradual conversation between the pair that had begun with Kyle Etman eventually deviated back to Matthias, the living honor of the Herhardt family.\u201cMatthias attended a council meeting at the town school recently.\u201d Elysee informed with delight. \u201cHis attentiveness towards such matters amazes me.\u201d\u201cHe is on the right path\u00a0to becoming\u00a0the head of the household. I am impressed at how fast he has improved.\u201d\u201d Norma praised her grandson wholeheartedly , which pleased Elysee von Herhardt to no end. After all, Matthias was her son.\u201cOf course! He will become the best Duke Herhardt has ever had!\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*So to speak, it was a coincidence.Riette proposed attending a social gathering since there was no schedule prepared for the day, and Matthias agreed.The social gathering was pleasant, yet tedious. They finally excused themselves and came across Leyla on their way back.Matthias recognized Leyla from a distance instantly when the car entered the mansion.\u00a0 She cycled her bicycle along the Platanus road in the October cold, wrapped in the white coat he had gifted her.\u201cIsn\u2019t that Leyla Lewellin?\u201d Riette noticed her as the distance from the woman on the bike gradually shortened. \u201cThe bird lover that lives in the Arvis\u2019 hunting grounds?\u201d His eyes switched from Leyla to his cousin who was staring unblinkingly at her with his piercing blue eyes.Matthias nodded without removing his gaze from her. He could see how fatigued she was yet she endured and pedalled her bike as usual.Realizing that a car had been following her, Leyla parked the bike to the side of the road to make way for the bigger vehicle. Matthias was able to get a good glimpse at her as soon as his vehicle passed by; she was wearing brand-new shoes that he had bought for her as well.\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, earlier, you told me that she\u2019s a village school teacher. She should be on her way back home from school .\u201d Riette grinned as he kept staring at his cousin, whose eyes never left the girl.\u201cMaybe.\u201dMatthias drew his glance away from Leyla at the end of his vague reply, his lips still had a faint smile on its corner. Riette couldn\u2019t take his eyes off his cousin\u2019s face, who seemed like a little boy experiencing love for the first time.\u201c\u2026Got something to say?\u201d Matthias mischievously asked as he turned to face Riette who had been burning holes on him with his gaze.\u201cWe will hunt today. I hope you can join us.\u201d Riette replied with an excuse. \u201cI\u2019ve invited some guests and it wouldn\u2019t be right if the Arvis\u2019 owner is absent.\u201dAfter Riette announced his weekend plan to hunt in the Arvis\u2019 forest, requests for invitations flooded in. Matthias had shown green light to his cousin\u2019s request to invite guests to his mansion.\u201cI can\u2019t act like the owner of your estate, Matthias.\u201d Riette added just as the car stopped at the front door of the mansion.\u2018Leyla would definitely roam the forest during the weekends, wouldn\u2019t she?\u2019After contemplating for a moment, Matthias gladly agreed.\u201cFine\u2026\u201d\u201cAs expected.\u201dRiette got out of the car looking delighted. This was the Matthias he was familiar with.\u201cNow you\u2019re acting more like Duke Herhardt, my cousin!\u201dLaughing, Riette wrapped her arms over his shoulders, which Matthias let him do, despite his dislike of such intimate acts.The two men walked alongside each other, entering the mansion\u2019s foyer, which was lit up at evening hours.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Phoebe was a smart pigeon.Intelligent enough to know how to scheme to get her freedom back after she got dissatisfied with being confined in a cage in the backyard.It all started with Bill Remmer, who forgot to lock her cage properly after volunteering to feed the bird on behalf of Leyla one weekend morning as she was busy preparing breakfast for them.The gluttonous pigeon hadn\u2019t noticed the unlocked door right away as she was more interested in filling her stomach. It was only while Bill and Leyla were busy raking up the leaves that blanketed the entire backyard, that the bird noticed something unusual about her cage.\u201cDon\u2019t go out into the woods today Leyla. The Duke is out hunting with his friends.\u201dLeyla sighed deeply as she cleaned the ground. \u201cHe has been quiet for a while but it seems his hobby hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d Her disappointment was audible as she vented her frustration by sweeping.\u201cWhat kind of marksman would waste his skill?\u201d Bill pointed out as a matter of fact.\u201cI feel like you\u2019re siding with the Duke.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not taking any sides! It\u2019s just\u2026I\u2019m just telling the truth.\u201dLeyla smirked as Bill hurriedly turned his words around. \u201cIt seems that everyone in Arvis likes the Duke.\u201d She stated her observation and her uncle shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to dislike him. On the contrary, he\u2019s the noblest gentleman Arvis ever had. That saucy aristocratic lady is lucky to be engaged to a man like Duke Herhardt.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dLeyla raked the backyard with a brighter smile as she relished the back and forth conversation with her uncle. She occasionally glanced at the bird cage and would feel at ease seeing Phoebe safe and sound; everything was fine.The naughty bird, however, finally made its bold escape when Bill left for work and Leyla began to clean the house.The wooden door of the cage creaked by the wind. Following the sound Phoebe tried her luck by pecking at the swinging door. She quickened her pace and the rickety door of the cage was fully open not long after.Phoebe was puzzled for a second as she stared at the opened cage door, thinking it was a perfect chance to escape the unfair punishment Leyla had given her for delivering the Duke\u2019s letter.The fatty pigeon flapped her white wings vigorously and flew towards the forest, the same place where the Duke\u2019s hunting party would head for their session.Leyla took a break from mopping and peered out the window as she heard noises outside. A familiar sight unfolded before her: hounds leading the way and aristocrats following on horseback. She jerked into a tense pose in fear. Repetitive flashbacks of gunshots firing with an eerie light resurfaced in her head.Leyla was startled when Matthias turned his head towards the cabin and caught her gaze. Facing an overwhelming sense of dread, she withdrew from the window, her heart pounding hard.Fidgeting frantically, Leyla fastened the window and drew the curtain hurriedly.\u2018It\u2019s not my first time seeing them, why am I behaving more cowardly than before?\u2019Her heartbeat had barely returned to normal even after the hunting party had left. The first gunshot was heard as Leyla massaged her cold and stiff shoulders followed by the resounding barks of the hounds.\u2018It\u2019s him! The insane Duke who casually kills birds.\u2019The small, motionless bird drenched in its blood, wounded by the bullet.The scent of blood\u2026All those memories began to re-live itself in her mind.Leyla hurriedly took her bag and left the house to bury those dead birds in the forest once the hunting session was over. She went to the backyard to check on Phoebe first , as if it was routine, to make sure the pigeon was still there before leaving.\u201cPhoebe\u2026\u201dLeyla\u2019s face turned pale with fear as she stood in front of an empty and open cage. Trembling, she held the bag strap and ran as she heard another gunshot ringing in the forest*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias was the first to shoot. His bullet immediately put an end to the roe deer\u2019s life as it galloped through the undergrowth.\u201cAre you considering hunting on the ground as well?\u201d Riette asked with amusement while he applauded Matthias\u2019 success. \u201cThat would be a little disappointing, I really wanted to spectate Duke Herhardt\u2019s bird shooting ability.\u201d He continued, commenting on Matthias\u2019 sudden change.Riette stopped his nonsense and picked up his gun as the hounds drove him to a new prey; a grey fur rabbit.The deeper they moved into the forest, the more intense the hunt grew. However, Matthias did not make a move against any of the birds even though others added them to the catch.\u2018As long as it\u2019s not a bird, it\u2019s fine, right?\u2019Matthias didn\u2019t understand the reason for such a random thought but he soon came to a realization :He didn\u2019t want to see her cry.He\u2019d rather that it became a dull hunt than to upset her by aiming for a bird.The sound of the horse hooves running over the thick layer of fallen leaves shook the serenity of the forest. The hunting party set out for the rookeries at the Schulter River \u2013 Matthias\u2019 favourite hunting location.On the way to the river, Matthias inadvertently saw a familiar bird with white feathers seated on a long branch. It\u2019s leg tied with a familiar red thread.\u201cPhoebe.\u201dHis unwitting murmur drew the attention of the others to the twig, where a white pigeon was perched calmly without a care.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLeyla ran through the thick vegetation of the forest, eyes frantically darting from one branch to the other. The thick leaves allowed only small rays of the sun through, letting her see clearly whether or not her precious bird was safe and sound.She could feel the thundering beat of her heart against her chest, her heavy breathing as she grew more frantic at finding her missing bird. Her baggage clattered along with every stride she took. She was the only one disturbing the natural stillness of the forest.She was practically heaving by now. The wind was chilly, but the temperature was quite humid, an indicator that the autumn season had finally reached its peak and winter would soon begin to set in. Leyla was beginning to feel the chill in her bones, making her body stiff, draining her strength quicker than usual.But she couldn\u2019t stop, not when the continuous gunshots echoing in the forest only served to remind her that she was still yet to find Phoebe, her beloved pigeon.With every gunshot she could hear, another blood-soaked image of Phoebe would run through her mind. Each one worse than the last, breaking her sanity bit by bit.\u2018What if she\u2019d already been shot?\u00a0What if I\u2019m already too late?\u2019She couldn\u2019t help but think, her chest aching at the thought.You would think that with every step she took she\u2019d be more confident to find her bird alive, but it only made it worse. Her steps began to falter as exhaustion was making its way into her joints, and the air running out of her lungs. The faint scent of gunpowder wafting in her nostrils as the smoky scent surrounded her as she inhaled huge bouts of air.Matthias had promised her he wouldn\u2019t touch Phoebe, that he would not shoot the bird. And she had foolishly accepted his word as it is. Looking back now, she should have thought of the possibility that perhaps he was only promising it to appease her. Now she can\u2019t help but imagine him breaking that promise as he aimed his gun and shot at innocent birds, Phoebe included, just to get her to pay more attention to him.\u2018How could I have blindly believed him?!\u2019She thought incredulously to herself as she kept running,\u2018That promise probably meant nothing to him, brushed it off as something so trivial for him to really keep!\u2019Leyla scolded herself for placing her trust in him blindly like a fool, despite already knowing he was a vicious person.She could feel the tears threatening to fall by the time she had reached the end of the forest\u2019s tree line, ending up by the road near the Schulter River. Should she fail to find her precious bird, she would go find the Duke himself and seek answers to Phoebe\u2019s fate.It didn\u2019t matter to her whether or not he would grant her an audience, she was prepared to do whatever it took to make sure, even if she had to go down on her knees and beg him for mercy.It was shortly after she stopped to take a breath, did the autumn breeze sweep past her softly. The skies were painted radiantly by a pale blue hue, her eyes closed shut as she soaked in the breeze and wished for a miracle. Leyla snapped them open once more, sweeping one last look around her surroundings before she finally found him.He was standing there\u2026.Just there, on the other side of the forest trail. He sat atop his steed, all confident and unbothered as he was surrounded by his peers and fellow comrades.The moment Leyla tried to call out to him, she found herself devoid of a voice.\u00a0 She tried to; she really wanted to call out to him but all the breath had left her lungs, and her voice stuck in her throat due to the lack of air. It had been too long since she had started running, and now exhaustion was taking over her, replacing her previous adrenaline rush.She took one last deep breath, before pushing her legs past their limit as she resumed her sprint towards the nobles on horseback. It was only when she neared them enough did she spot one of them had poised their gun at an aim towards one of the branches.A split-second later, she recognized it was him,Duke Herhardt\u2026Her eyes trailed from the end of the gun to see what he had been aiming at, and felt her breath hitch as her heart stuttered in fright.Phoebe!Her pace picked up as she tried to stop him from pulling the trigger, her legs screaming in protest at the overexertion. She tried to regain her voice to let out a scream, but only managed a strangled gasp out as a resounding gunshot echoed throughout the sleepy forest.BANG!The end of Matthias\u2019 gun was smoking, as soon as he let go of the trigger, and Phoebe was no longer perched on top of the branch.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Time seemed to stop after that one moment, until Matthias moved and broke the silence.He slowly lowered his long silver rifle, the sunlight glinting as it slid off, it\u2019s shimmer bouncing off the air, twinkling through the forest. Meanwhile, Riette and the other nobles looked at him in a mix of bewilderment as well as amusement on their faces.\u201cWell, colour me surprised Matthias.\u201d Riette exclaimed, \u201cWhat the hell was up with that shot?\u201d he teased, it wasn\u2019t long before the other nobles followed suit in teasing the Duke.\u201cI can\u2019t believe\u00a0the\u00a0Duke Herhardt actually missed!\u201d\u201cWell I certainly saw something interesting today.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s always a first for everything I guess.\u201dThey all started to remark, the easy laughter and banter flowing between them naturally.Though Matthias did take the shot, it had only grazed the end of the branch on which the pigeon had perched upon. After that missed shot, the bird fluttered away from the hunting nobles as a piece of the wood broke off and landed on the forest floor.Matthias took all the teasing in pride, smirking knowingly to himself as his sharp eyes trailed intensely after the bird. It seemed to him it was flying towards the east wing of the estate.\u201cHuh, why is she here?\u201d Riette wondered out loud, having managed to catch sight of a woman who was standing stock still not too far away from the group.Matthias slowly turned, following the trail of his cousin\u2019s gaze, before finally spotting her. He grinned minutely to himself when he noticed he held all of her attention now.\u201cLe-Leyla!\u201d exclaimed a couple of the servants when they finally took notice of the unexpected guest.Despite the commotion she caused, Leyla stood frozen as she regarded Matthias in a dumbfounded manner, as if he was the only one she could see.\u201cLeyla!\u201d a servant grabbed her arm, which shook her out of her frozen state, \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to go out today! Didn\u2019t you hear from Mr. Remmer? I specifically informed him of the Duke\u2019s plans for hunting today.\u201d\u201cI,\u201dLeyla gulped, eyes wandering back to the Duke\u2019s, before going back to look at the person talking to her, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, he did inform me, but I must have gotten the dates mixed up.\u201d She apologised, \u201cTruly, I am sorry.\u201dLeyla slowly bowed her head, her hand coming up to rest against her chest, still able to feel the thundering beat of her heart as she lowered her gaze to her feet.Shortly after scolding her a little more of her recklessness did the servants return to their posts, leaving her alone. Meanwhile Matthias acted like he was above the small commotion that had just happened. He pulled on his horse\u2019s reins, nudging it to move along as he directed it towards the west wing of the estate. Which had been opposite of the direction she knew Phoebe had flown off to.Her tears threatened to fall once more, but only made her eyes shine as the water built up within them. The overwhelming astonishment she felt was too much for her to bear.She was no stranger to the Duke\u2019s aim.Throughout her years here, she had witnessed with her very own eyes shot after shot he made. His aim, his posture, his concentration, and his skills with shooting; she was so familiar with, she was certain of this one fact.It was not a missed shot.Today, he purposely aimed the branches and scared the bird off, to fly away from their hunting party so that others could not take a turn at her. And now Phoebe was safe, far away from their bullets and silver guns.As Matthias was leaving, he expertly tilted his head back, eyes meeting with her before treading the curved evergreen trail. Though they were quite some distance apart by now, Leyla instinctively knew that the Duke knew she could see him back.As soon as the hunting party disappeared from her line of sight, she hiked up her skirts before turning around to go back the long way she came from.Only then did her final strength leave her, the exhaustion fully settling in as she felt herself relax. She felt so weightless, like a ghost floating adrift aimlessly, even though she knew exactly where she was headed. She couldn\u2019t help but recall a similar instance where she also felt this weightlessness.Images flashed through her mind as she recalled fragments of events long past, but she thought nothing more of it. Leyla can\u2019t believe she remembered as much as she did from back then.Gripping her bag tightly on her shoulder, she began to slowly trek through the forest this time. There was no need to rush anymore. Her worries were appeased now. By the time she finally reached her cabin, she felt herself get lightheaded, her vision turning blurry. Leyla no longer had the strength to reach her bed for much rest, so with her last strength, she plopped down on the nearby chair by the porch.Matthias kept his promise.A promise he made to her in particular.And that, that was another fact she was certain of.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Tap. Tap. Tap.The sound echoed inside the quiet room. Sitting in front of her desk by a lantern, Leyla instinctively rose from her seat at the familiar sound and ran immediately towards the front windows. Excitedly she opened it up with a bright smile!\u201cPhoebe!\u201d she exclaimed before her smile froze.Leyla immediately muffled down her scream at the sudden sight of the Duke outside with a hand to her mouth, wary of Uncle Bill, who was just outside, chopping up the firewood by their front yard. Had he heard her shriek in alarm, he would have abandoned his task to immediately check up on her. And she didn\u2019t want that.In a hurry, Leyla moved to lock her bedroom door before turning back towards her open window.Matthias was still decked in his hunting gear. The dust and grime of his day\u2019s activities adorning the expensive clothing, while the faint smell of blood lingered on him. She could see some specks of blood by his sleeves, and the front of his red hunting jacket.\u201cYour pigeon is over there.\u201dMatthias raised his head lightly to point towards the other end of the window frame where Phoebe, her precious bird, was calmly resting.She held in her cry of relief at seeing the bird, focusing back on the Duke who was standing outside her window.His noble steed, who stood patiently behind him made him look all the more intimidating for her. However, the backdrop of the soft glow of orange sunset and slowly darkening skies also served to make him look more alluring, bringing out the colour of his eyes. She can\u2019t help but feel slightly mesmerised by his figure.\u201cHave you thought about it?\u201d\u00a0Matthias interrupted her thoughts unknowingly, \u201cOn how you plan to return the favour?\u201dHe inquired, gesturing once more towards Phoebe, while his gaze held onto Leyla\u2019s, with one pristine brow rising up at her.Leyla gulped nervously, eyes fleeting towards her bird momentarily before looking back at Matthias.\u201cI, I don\u2019t think this counts as a favour,\u201d she softly began, before slightly gaining more confidence, \u201cAfter all, you were only keeping your word.\u201dLeyla pointed out anxiously, but Matthias only smirked at her in a rather smug manner, making her retrace a few steps back.\u201cThough I am very grateful.\u201d She added, lowering her gaze.\u201cGrateful, you say?\u201d he smirked, \u201cAnd what could I do with gratitude?\u201d Matthias prodded further.\u201cW-well,\u201d Leyla stuttered slightly, \u201cI think it means you are an honourable gentleman, who keeps his word.\u201d\u201cOho,\u201d he lightly scoffed, taunting her in a subtle manner, \u201cAre you then retracting your words from before?\u201d Matthias asked, tilting her head, smirk still firmly in place.Leyla frowned in confusion.\u00a0What words?\u201cYou described me as the furthest thing from a gentleman, if I recall correctly.\u201d said Matthias as he leaned on the window frame, after seeing her confusion.Leyla flushed in embarrassment as the memory resurfaced.\u201cI, forgive me,\u201d she immediately spewed out, \u201cI had been too imprudent at that time!\u201dLeyla bowed her head further, she felt as though she was digging herself further and further deeper into a grave. But no matter what was done, all she needed to do now was damage control.\u201cFirst you say I\u2019m a gentleman, then the next I\u2019m not, and now I\u2019m once again one.\u201d Matthias hummed, cocking a brow at her once more, \u201cSo which is it?\u201d\u201cY-you\u2019re a gentleman.\u201d She stuttered. He then pursed his lips in thought, as he regarded her slowly, raking his eyes up and down her person.\u201cThen does that make you the queen?\u201d Matthias scoffingly asked.Leyla blinked in confusion, brows furrowing as she racked her brain for a reason how the conversation had turned out this way when a memory resurfaced from when she yelled out at him by the stream in frustration\u2026\u201cIf you\u2019re a gentleman, then I\u2019m the Queen!\u201dShe had meant it sarcastically of course, but now she found her words being used against her. Leyla wanted to deny it vehemently, but she could tell by the knowing smirk on his lips that her face was already too flushed in embarrassment at the memory.Of course all this could have been prevented had she managed to let a few offhanded comments of his slide, but for some reason, Leyla at that time had failed to control her temper in front of him. Sure when it came to others she could play the perfect, polite girl act, but whenever it came to the Duke, something in her just seemed to do the opposite. It was a struggle to even keep her calm around him.\u201cI apologise for that day. And I sincerely thank you for keeping your promise. I mean it.\u201dLeyla apologised to him, though the hesitancy in her posture spoke in volumes.\u00a0Silence reigned between them once more, the sound of Bill Remmer\u2019s chopping axe the only one filling the void between them.Matthias continued to regard her calmly, before sighing in feigned resignation.\u201cAh, what should I do with you, Leyla?\u201d\u00a0His hand suddenly reaching out and gripping her chin to force her to look up at him. Matthias clicked his tongue as he pulled her closer to him, \u201cI don\u2019t need your gratitude after saving your bird.\u201dFeeling as though she was doused with a cold bucket of water, Leyla tried to shake his grip away from her, but he was much too strong. Matthias was stronger and faster, and not a second later did her vision blur as he too yanked her glasses off\u2026He had kissed her.She tried to shake away from him, but too late did she realise that his other hand had come up behind her head and grabbed a handful of her hair when she felt a sharp pain as he lightly yanked her head back.Leyla gasped out in pain, and that was the opportunity Matthias took to slide his hot tongue inside her mouth.His tongue darted inside, exploring her mouth ravenously, before sensually entwining around hers. Leyla couldn\u2019t help but moan at the sensation. In the background, she could still faintly hear Bill Remmer\u2019s grunts loudly as he split some more firewood.Leyla\u2019 hands shifted, moving from the window sill and up to Matthias\u2019 shoulder, trying to shove him away. But it only served to deepen their kiss instead.This kiss now was quite different from the kiss she remembered having from last summer\u2019s final day. The kiss that scarred her deep in her heart. Instead of the fierce devouring kiss he let her taste before, it was now firm, but gentler; demanding but more delicate against her lips.It wasn\u2019t long before his grip on her hair loosened up, allowing her to break free of his grasp. As she gasped for air, Leyla\u2019s nose picked up his body scent; a blend of the blood of prey along with his minty fragrance.She bit her lips defiantly as Matthias still held onto her chin resolutely, not letting her go just yet.\u201cJust a kiss?\u201d he whispered in a sultry voice, \u201cIs your precious bird\u2019s life just this much?\u201dSuch a seductively coercive tone fell on her ears. Unfortunately, she neither had time or the strength to think past her current panic. All she could feel was the way her body locked up in place as she stared at him in a flushed manner, her mouth agape as she continued to breath in air. Suddenly, she was yanked forward, her face now a hair\u2019s breadth away from his.\u201cAckh!\u201d Leyla exclaimed.Matthias regarded her face a little bit, eyes flitting around her features. The grip on her chin was tightening up, she feared he would crush it sooner. Leyla let out a quiet gasp as the grip pained her, before his tongue dove back in her mouth\u2026All she could think about then was how she\u2019d much rather be in pain instead. However, Matthias was persistent in his efforts, his tongue resuming their previous ministrations, dancing expertly around her own tongue as he tasted every nook and cranny in her mouth.Their bellicose kiss continued, coupled by the loud grunts of Bill, alongside the splitting firewood.\u00a0Each time Matthias intertwined his tongue with hers and sucked on it, she gasped for\u00a0 breath, squeezing his shirt,\u00a0 letting out involuntary moans that seemed to have been scraped up from the depth of her throat with every brush of his tongue against hers.With every noise she made, Leyla felt so ashamed of herself. She could feel herself grow dizzier with each passing moment, her body moving in response to whatever he was doing.Even her hands, who were tirelessly pushing him away, can now only hang limply on his shoulders. She could feel the prickling of tears begin to form, willing them not to fall\u2026Finally, Matthias let her go, letting her gasp for air when he felt her cheeks grow wet, and a sob mixed with her moans.Their lips were now moist with each other\u2019s saliva, making it glisten in the dark. Leyla felt her knees go weak, but she caught herself before she fell to the floor completely at the thought of how the two of them looked like right now.\u201cLeyla!\u201dUncle Bill\u2019s voice shook Leyla from her unforgiving thoughts.\u201cLeyla! Could you bring me a glass of refreshing water?\u201d he requested.\u2018Answer Leyla,\u2019She thought to herself,\u2018I must answer quickly!\u2019She urged, but her movements were sluggish as she dazedly stared at the way Matthias took out his handkerchief. Leyla watched him slowly bring it up to his lips and wipe off the evidence of what they had done.It was only when he slightly tugged her face forward did she remember he was still gripping her chin. Next he brought the same handkerchief he used, to wipe off the evidence from her lips as well.Calmly Matthias picked up her glasses he had discarded earlier and replaced them back to where they should be until finally releasing his grip on her.\u201cLeyla?\u201dThe sound of Bill chopping firewood suddenly stopped when he began to wonder why there was no reply.\u201cWash it and bring it back.\u201dMatthias ordered, taking hold of her hand, making her fingers grasp the used cloth firmly. He rubbed a few small circles on her wrist before swiftly letting her go, and turned around to ride atop his steed.\u201cLeyla, child! Is there something wrong?\u201dUncle Bill\u2019s footsteps shook Leyla out of her daze as she noticed them grow closer. Hurriedly, she shut the windows, and drew the curtains closed. Immediately, she rushed back towards her door and swung it open, just before Uncle Bill\u2019s hand, which was raised to knock, was about to hit it.\u201cSorry, uncle. I\u2026 I was sleeping for a moment.\u201d she lamely excused, making a show of fixing her hair, which Matthias had been gripping not too long ago.\u201cHmm, I did wonder why you were taking so long.\u201d Uncle Bill told her.\u201cI, I\u2019ll get started on dinner right away!\u201d\u201cNo need to rush lass,\u201d he placated her, \u201cMake sure you\u2019re properly awake first. You can slow down.\u201d He reminded her, smiling at her fondly.Bill gently patted her on the head before turning around back into the front yard, picking up a glass of water on his way out, before leaving her alone.As soon as she heard the front door shut, only then did Leyla allow herself to feel faint, and unceremoniously dropped to the floor\u2026Matthias\u2019s handkerchief, which was in her weakened grip, fluttered around her as it too fell, and innocently sank in front of her crestfallen form.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.**Dear readers, I\u2019m so sorry if in the past month, the release was a bit late.

    "Chapter 58": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Principal\u2019s lips pursed into a thin line, her face set with a slight frown as she regarded the woman across from her. Leyla, on the other hand, sat calmly, yet resolutely as she waited for her decision. From her eyes alone, the Principal could see that Leyla was determined about this.\u201cAre you sure of this, Miss Lewellin?\u201d She asked Leyla anyway, her eyes peeking above her spectacles to look at her. Leyla only nodded in response.\u201cYes. I\u2019d like to do that.\u201d She responded immediately, as though the thought hadn\u2019t just hit her out of nowhere. She wasn\u2019t kidding about her desire to move away. To teach in a different school, a much farther school.\u201cForgive me for prying, but,\u201d The Principal hummed as she rested her chin above her clasped hands, scrutinizing Leyla some more, \u201cIsn\u2019t this school the closest one to home? Why would you wish to be transferred away?\u201dAs far as she knew, Leyla only had to pedal her bike to commute to school everyday. She was asking, not because Leyla was a seasoned teacher, but because she was a hard worker. Sure, she was a novice, often lacking experience in handling matters which would cause a few headaches along her way, but she could see the potential the girl had.In short, she had grown quite fond of Leyla. As a matter of fact, this school was also the best choice she could have of growing experience and a career.\u201cShould I also point out that the other Carlsbar schools lack an opening to hire you?\u201d The Principal inquired, sighing briefly, \u201cIn addition to that, you would have to move away, find a place to stay in, as well as travel quite a few times just to switch schools?\u201d\u201cYes, I understand, and I\u2019m prepared to do it.\u201dLeyla did think about those things. It was impossible not to. But she knew she needed to do this. The Principal hummed in thought before leaning back on her chair.\u201cIf there is a problem within the school, then I assure you, we can handle this Leyla.\u201d She said softly, \u201cHas there been some troubles between your students? Colleagues?\u201d\u201cNo! There has been no trouble.\u201d Leyla vehemently denied, \u201cThe teachers have been good to me, you most especially. And the children are absolute angels, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d the words caught in her throat. How was she to explain her reasons for leaving were not even work-related?\u201cJust\u2026?\u201d The Principal prodded, a pristine brow raised at her for further inquiry. Leyla schooled her features, smiling politely.\u201cI\u2019ve thought about this not because of my troubles in school, but rather because I feel as though I need more experience outside my comfort zone.\u201d Leyla explained, \u201cI want to broaden my horizon, move past my home so that I could better my skills, for me and the children I will teach.\u201d she finished. The Principal whizzed at her answer, minutely impressed.\u201cHow eloquently put.\u201d She sighed in resignation, \u201cIf that is what you truly want, then who am I to deny that?\u201d\u00a0She looked down on her work table and began rearranging papers, \u201cFortunately, there are many who also wish to gain experience here in Carlsbar, so finding a replacement for you shouldn\u2019t be too difficult.\u201d\u201cThank you so much for your consideration!\u201d She thanked profusely.\u00a0Leyla knew that her experience in Carlsbar was good for experience. The school was fairly prestigious, located in a flourishing city not too far away from the capital of the Berg Empire. A prime job opportunity, in fact, that she landed a job in such a place despite her lack of experience.But it was the only excuse she could think of that would suffice the Principal of her requesting a transfer of schools, far away from home.\u201cThough you will still need to serve the full semester before your transfer can be processed.\u201d The Principal continued, \u201cHowever, should you change your mind, feel free to come back and retract your transfer.\u201dLeyla doubted she would ever retract her request, even if she was given a whole semester to think about it. She was resolute in moving far away from this place. Thanking her once more, Leyla got up and left the headmistress\u2019 office, softly shutting the door behind her, and walked back to her classroom before letting out a long sigh of relief.Checking she was alone, Leyla moved towards the window, watching the leaves of the oak tree outside gently sway with the wind before its stem snapped and fluttered towards the ground. Autumn was nearing its end as winter crept in ever slowly.The sun\u2019s rays flowed between its almost barren tree branches, filtering in the light seeping through her windows, casting elongated shadows across her face.\u2018I have to leave Arvis.\u2019\u00a0she thought to herself, taking in the sight of what would serve to be her last autumn in the school.Leyla did, in fact, think this through carefully. It took her quite a few sleepless nights and busy days before she reached such a decision. As much as it pained her to be leaving and thus wouldn\u2019t be able to spend more precious time with her Uncle Bill, she didn\u2019t want to repeat the events that happened with Kyle.She had learned her lesson. She could no longer hold onto impractical wants and desires. It would only complicate things more, make it harder for her in the long run, and ruin everything she had been working hard for.So Leyla decided to focus on her original plans.Besides, just because she\u2019d become a teacher in the neighbouring city or somewhere further did not mean she couldn\u2019t come to visit Uncle Bill from time to time. She reckoned she could even turn it into weekly visits if she would do it during her weekends.And maybe lodging and board would turn out to be expensive in a foreign place and delay further preparations she had when continuing college education. Still, it was a far better alternative to staying any longer here in Carlsbar.She would do anything just to get away from that man and Arvis.\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright,\u201d Leyla softly muttered to herself, \u201cEverything will be alright soon. You\u2019ll see.\u201d she repeated.Perhaps after repeating those phrases over and over, she would start believing in them. And so, schooling a smile over her lips, she went back to her desk.She was no stranger to moving, after all. Her entire childhood consisted of her moving around from one place to the next, staying with relatives, one after another. It made her feel miserable as a child, but it certainly imparted quite a few valuable life lessons, which she found handy right now.Yes, she was an adult now, with a loving uncle to support her every endeavour. Everything would definitely turn out fine in the end.Unconsciously, her fingers went up to gently rub her lips in a back and forth motion. She took in a deep breath before standing up to put on her coat. She fixed her belongings and packed what she needed into her bag for the next few days before her breathing stuttered at the sight of a simple white cloth.There, stuffed innocently inside one of her bag\u2019s inner pockets, was the Duke\u2019s handkerchief. Memories of their latest kiss assaulted her mind before she shook them away and breathed in deeply.She couldn\u2019t allow him to affect her any further. And so, without further ado, she locked her classroom as she left and went out of the building. She beelined to her bike, hoisting herself over the seat as she did a thousand times before, and began to pedal through Arvis.She knew where she was going next.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Riette von Lindman dutifully drove his car, eyes kept resolutely on the road. His grip on the steering wheel lightened as he made a soft turn, entering the path leading up to Arvis Estate. As soon as he passed the boundary, he caught in his peripheral a woman, taking shade under the tree.He slowed down to a stop, eyes glancing in her direction. He took note of the bicycle propped against the tree as she stood idly waiting for someone.\u2018Who is she waiting for?\u2019\u00a0Riette hummed in wonder at sight.\u00a0This was certainly quite the surprise, and he wanted to know what she was there for. He unbuckled and got out of the car, locking the door behind him. As he neared the woman, he blinked as he recognized her.\u201cGood day Miss Lewellin.\u201d he greeted as soon as he was near enough to be heard.Leyla, who had been busy spacing out, snapped her head up at the unexpected presence of the Marquis. In her anxiousness, she staggered back when he stopped before her.\u201cMarquis Lindman, a good day to you as well.\u201d she politely greeted back after a whole minute, though the nervousness in her persisted. Nervously she looked around, noticing they were alone, and unconsciously stepped back away from him, putting more distance between them.She was already nervous being in the estate; she didn\u2019t need any noble poking around to see why she was here as well. But of course, she was never that lucky.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Riette asked her.Leyla struggled to answer him.\u00a0What could she say?\u00a0The more she thought about why she was even here in the first place, the more she felt stiff and frozen on the spot. She couldn\u2019t answer him.Riette, on the other hand, watched as she slowly paled, silence reigning between them after his inquiry. It didn\u2019t take him long to piece out the puzzle, and he let out an amused chuckle at her terror.\u201cHmm, well let\u2019s see, the it couldn\u2019t be the doctor\u2019s son,\u201d Riette chuckled, eyes watching her in scrutiny, \u201cHe\u2019s not in the estate at the moment.\u201d He pretended to think about it for a few more moments before gasping in mock dramatics, \u201cCould it be? You\u2019re here for Duke Herhardt himself?\u201dLeyla\u2019s eyes snapped back to him at his mocking tone. She could feel her cheeks flush, eyebrows furrowing in response, the shame she felt hidden in her eyes by the glasses she wore.Riette drew closer, hands clasped behind his back, lowering his mouth next to her ear\u2026\u201cThe man whom Miss Lewellin is waiting for must be Matthias, right?\u201d He whispered before straightening up, putting some distance between them once more.Upon hearing his suspicions once more, Leyla felt her palms turn clammy, cold sweat slid down her temples, her knuckles turning white as the grip on her bag tightened in frustration.She was only here to return the Duke\u2019s handkerchief, but how was it that she felt as though she\u2019d been strapped with a time bomb instead? She didn\u2019t want to be trapped alone with him at the annex, so instead, she waited here, by the road\u2026Oh, what a mistake that was.\u201cCat got your tongue, hmm?\u201d Riette mused, \u201cWhy? Did I hit too close to home?\u201d\u201cForgive my rudeness, but I must leave now, Marquis.\u201d Leyla forced herself to say, discreetly manoeuvring her bag behind her as she turned to indeed leave the place. She\u2019d catch the Duke at a different time instead.However, Riette was taller and nimbler than her. He managed to catch up to her quickly, herding her to a stop as he blocked her exit.\u201cAh, won\u2019t you wait a little while for my dear cousin?\u201d he asked, \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen him yet, and you\u2019ve surely waited for sometime now. It would be quite a waste of time to leave now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t a waste, excuse me.\u201d Leyla dodged once more to pass through him, but instead, Riette grabbed her by the shoulder and held her back.\u201cOh but I insist!\u201d He exclaimed, \u201cBy the way, did you know that the Duke is actually not at home right now?\u201d He told her informatively, \u201cIn fact, he left to escort his fiance!\u201d He emphasised, \u201cDoes that upset you, oh poor Miss Lewellin?\u201dLeyla frantically tried to get away from his grip, which in turn was also beginning to get on his nerves the more she struggled. Couldn\u2019t she see beyond her fear he was trying to help!?When Riette had initially stopped and approached her, he had only meant to tease her a little. However, when he learned or rather guessed correctly that she had indeed been waiting for Matthias, the teasing turned into pity. The poor thing didn\u2019t even realise her precious Duke had gone and left the estate.He sympathised greatly; after all, he too was in his very own tragic love affair. Riette firmly believed she was also suffering the effects of heartbreak at the news, the same way he suffered when he\u2019d witnessed Matthias heading out the mansion to escort his fiance, Claudine, this morning.The painful sting of longing was still heavy in his heart, so of course, he understood her. But that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t against playing with her a little longer for his amusement.\u201cThough come to think of it, Matthias is quite the simple man isn\u2019t he?\u201d Riette continued to hold her back, his grip on her shoulder tightening before he grabbed hold of her bike instead, effectively stopping her from leaving. \u201cAlso, your relationship with him, isn\u2019t it akin to that of a mistress?\u201d\u201cWha-what?!\u201d Leyla hissed, her breath hitching at the accusation.\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s the exact word.\u201d Riette insisted, straightening up as he held her bike far from her, \u201cYou\u2019re almost like the Duke\u2019s mistress, are you not?\u201d He blinked innocently before smirking at the growing rage on her face, \u201cWhat? Too vulgar for your tastes, Miss Lewellin?\u201dLeyla was fuming at the blatant insult to her face. She wanted to tear that smug look off his face in response to baseless accusations. Though that didn\u2019t help in easing the shame as she remembered the latest kiss the Duke and her shared, never mind the fact she had been reluctant to do so.\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Riette found it amusing to keep pushing more and more of her buttons. \u201cIf so, then I deeply apologise for using such a word.\u201d He continued to mock, tilting his head for added effect, but the smugness was still there.\u201cGive me back my bike!\u201d Leyla demanded in anger, arms reaching out to yank her possession away from him, but he dodged her quickly, effectively keeping her bike out of reach.\u201cNow, I feel a little disappointed that you, the esteemed Miss Lewellin, who like\u00a0both\u00a0the doctor\u2019s son and Duke Herhardt, couldn\u2019t even stand to be around me! Oh, how you wound me!\u201d Riette feigned dramatics as he swooned in mock pain. \u201cVery well, here\u2019s your bike.\u201d and he let it go.Leyla immediately moved to gather her bike, but in her haste to get it, she had let go of her bag, allowing the Marquis to snatch it up quickly. She gasped in panic, abandoning her bike instead as she began to run after the Marquis, who was now busying himself with her bag\u2019s contents.\u201cPerhaps I could find something here for me instead.\u201d he teased her once more. Twisting and dodging around her to keep it out of reach from Leyla. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the doctor\u2019s son, but I\u2019m sure I can be more interesting than Matthias.\u201d\u201cGive back my bag!\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, even Matthias and I look quite alike.\u201d He pointed out, pausing as he touched his chin and looked down on her, raising her bag high above him, \u201cDon\u2019t you think so, Miss Lewellin? Although I can\u2019t give you as much affection as Duke Herhardt, I\u2019m sure I can still make you happy.\u201dUncaring of how she would look, Leyla grabbed on his arm as she jumped to retrieve her stolen bag. She could feel the growing frustration threatening to burst inside her as her eyes blurred and lips began to tremble.\u201cLet the dull Duke get along with his boring fianc\u00e9e, and in the meantime, play with me, Miss Lewellin.\u201d Riette said in a sing-song voice as he kept the bag out of reach from her.It was undoubtedly quite amusing for him to watch her hop on her tippy-toes to reach for her bag, as though it held all the treasures in the world. Ah well, his hand was beginning to feel numb, and so he immediately dropped it back down and let her have it back as well.\u201cGive it back!\u201dLeyla wasted no time in snatching it away from his fingers, wrapping it close to her bosom protectively. She sniffed and grabbed her abandoned bike, righted it up and hoisted herself over, and pedalled away.In her haste, she failed to notice her striped shoes slip off.\u201cOh, come on now, I was only teasing!\u201d Riette called out after her, \u201cOh Miss Lewellin, I promise to be a good boy!\u201dBut Leyla was no longer listening and was gaining steady distance between them. Riette only sighed in pity before noticing the shoes left behind.He picked it up, turning it over in his hands before groaning in resignation, and began sprinting towards the direction she left before disappearing by the corner.SCREEEEECH!He didn\u2019t get too far before he heard the alarming sound of a collision between something metallic and another object. Riette slowly began to pick up pace as alarm bells rang in his head!As soon as he turned the corner, he stopped in bewilderment when he saw the sight of a downed woman in the middle of the road in front of a familiar black car, who seemed to have skidded to a stop.Riette stood frozen in place, unsure of what to do when someone hurriedly exited the car. The driver, it seemed, was the first to check up on the woman who stayed still on the ground, and soon a couple had emerged from the back\u2026Matthias and Claudine.\u201cOh my god! Leyla!\u201d Claudine exclaimed in panic as she saw the woman. Riette could only stand dumbly as he stared at the scene before him, taking in Leyla\u2019s crumpled form and her dented bike by the front of the car.Riette\u2019s eyes then were drawn towards Matthias, who regarded Leyla\u2019s prone form with indifference. In Leyla\u2019s arms, she still clutched her bag like a precious artefact. Matthias raked his eyes over her before his gaze turned to the side to meet Riette\u2019s gaze, who stood uselessly in front of an overhead lamplight.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was fortunate that the accident looked worse than it actually was. Despite having been hit by the car, Leyla had only sustained minor injuries, and thus, still managed to stand and walk fairly well. Matthias had suggested taking her to the hospital to be sure, but Leyla had stubbornly refused.After confirming she was fine, Matthias deemed it fit to put the incident behind them.\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the mansion now.\u201d He announced, glancing around at the servants with them, who had been attending to Leyla. Though the servants were particularly concerned about Leyla, they did nothing as they watched her until she disappeared from their sight.\u201cYes, that would be a good idea.\u201dClaudine readily agreed after bidding Riette goodbye.\u00a0So that was the end of that. Matthias dutifully escorted her back into the car. Riette looked flushed, followed shortly behind them as he headed back into his by the entrance of Platanus road.Claudine watched outside the car window, eyes staring worriedly as they both passed by Leyla. She couldn\u2019t help but recall the way Leyla had absolutely rushed in front of the car. Normally, Claudine was a calm woman, but when Leyla appeared out of nowhere and got hit by the car, she assumed the worst!\u201cI thought she got hit pretty hard. I\u2019m glad that she is fine.\u201d Claudine sighed in relief. Speaking of Leyla, she recalled the way Riette had been holding onto Leyla\u2019s shoes just moments after he rounded the corner where Leyla got hit.She must admit, she almost let her composure slip at that very moment. She had not expected Riette to be that rash and impatient. Claudine\u2019s eyes shifted to her peripheral, discreetly scrutinising her fiance. She expected something after that near-death scare for Leyla, but she could not read him at all.Even after this, he was still so indifferent.If she didn\u2019t know any better, she would have thought he did not care for Leyla at all. Matthias didn\u2019t even look livid about the driving hitting her accidentally, nor questioned Riette about why he had been holding onto her shoes.How very typical of Duke Herhardt.By the time they reached the front door of the mansion, and the car came to a stop, Claudine couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for Leyla.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once the car came to a stop, Matthias got out first, before holding his arm out for Claudine, who took it as she exited as well. They were then led towards the reception room, where two ladies-in-waiting stood to receive them, alongside his cousin, Riette.\u2019What if Claudine was mistaken?\u2019Riette thought as he observed his cousin. One would think he would at least show some bit of concern towards the incident on Leyla, but Matthias remained calm and composed throughout the whole thing.If Claudine was in fact correct in her assumption about the Duke being enamoured with the orphan, surely there would be some sort of reaction from him seeing Leyla get hurt. He knew he would if it was Claudine.His cousin wasn\u2019t an idiot as well, and was wise enough to cover up the earlier incident and brush it off as something trivial. Still, it was baffling for Riette to see Matthias so indifferent. What were his true feelings towards the girl?He\u2019d get to the bottom of things, one way or the other. And so they had dinner served early in consideration for Claudine. As quick as it started, so did it end, and she retired early, leaving the two men alone, to head towards Matthias\u2019 study.\u201cTo be honest, she looked quite lonely, waiting for your arrival on her own.\u201d Riette started, \u201cSo I decided to go and give her some bit of cheer when I arrived. I might have teased her some, but I had not expected her to be so afraid and run away.\u201dHe eyed Matthias carefully, watching for any subtle hints of emotion as he sat across from the Duke in the study. When there was no change with Matthias, Riette cleared his throat, before languidly leaning back on the chair.\u201cI\u2019m talking about her, by the way,\u201d He clarified, \u201cMiss Leyla Lewellin.\u201dThe name spilling out of Riette\u2019s mouth as though he was spitting out sand, albeit in mild distaste. Much of what he said was indeed true. He might have gotten a little physical, but he\u2019d only meant to tease her.\u201cAh.\u201d Matthias hummed, indifferent as ever, but sharp eyes regarding the Marquis in scrutiny. He then let out a low, yet amused chuckle, before sighing at him, looking quite amused by his cousin\u2019s antics.It wasn\u2019t the reaction of someone affected by a loved one\u2019s near-death experience. It seemed too real to be fake, Riette thought to himself.\u201cI guess even a womaniser by the likes of Riette von Lindman have their limitations!\u201d teased Matthias, \u201cImagine that, you, getting rejected by a woman. Such a woman does exist.\u201d He declared jovially. Riette couldn\u2019t help but chuckle back.\u201cWhat? Such slander!\u201d They both laughed at each other before it died down eventually. Matthias\u2019 eyes softened a little bit before turning serious.\u201cWell, it does serve you right.\u201d Matthias told him, smoothly opening the silver box on his desk and took out a cigarette. He flipped his lighter to light the end before offering one to Riette, who in turn took one for himself as well.Both men settled back in their respective chairs, languidly puffing out smoke. Riette continued to regard Matthias carefully, wondering what would happen now. He was mostly convinced by now, after the laugh they shared moments ago, that Matthias could care less about Leyla.\u2018I can\u2019t help but feel sorry for Leyla after all,\u2019\u00a0Riette thought as they continued to puff smoke,\u00a0\u2018To think he\u2019d treat her this pathetically.\u2019\u201cNot one of my best moments, I\u2019d admit to that.\u201d Riette said, sinking further into the comfy chair. He felt as though he and Claudine had made complete fools out of themselves.(\u2018That girl over there, doesn\u2019t she resemble the canary Duke Herhardt raises in his bedroom?\u2019)Those were the words Claudine said last summer during one afternoon as she had been looking out the window, still all smiles and hearts filled with light. She had been busy looking at Leyla Lewellin, who had been returning home after a day\u2019s work in the garden.Riette could still remember the way Leyla looked at that moment. Her voluminous blonde hair bounced softly with every step, swaying as the wind fluttered through her. The sweat on her brow glistened, making her shine in the afterglow of the setting sun. She did greatly resemble a bird, whose wings were flapping so exquisitely.( \u2018Are you possibly wanting to tell me that Matthias started to raise a canary because of her?\u2019)He had asked Claudine in disbelief that day. She only looked at him meaningfully, all confident as she gave him a clandestine smile.Yes, Claudine conveyed wordlessly. She was so certain, Riette couldn\u2019t help but believe her. She was always so rational, so logical, so he trusted that she wouldn\u2019t make such a decision lightly on a small coincidence. After all, he too had been a little apprehensive with Matthias\u2019 sudden change of heart in raising a bird.Coupled with the fact he had overheard that Matthias had planned to create a rift between Leyla and Kyle Etman, it seemed more and more plausible that Claudine\u2019s assumptions were correct.\u2018But how can he act like this?\u2019\u00a0The more he pondered about it, Riette felt as if he had lost his way in a maze of increasingly complex questions.How could he act so indifferent towards the woman he has strong feelings for? Sit across him and make jokes about the way his cousin acted so callously towards her, leading to injury? And if Claudine had indeed been right, what did that mean about their relationship with each other?\u2018Have they broken up already? But then why does Matthias still care for the canary, safely tucked in his bedroom?\u2019\u201cRiette von Lindman.\u201d Matthias spoke up, blowing a drawn out puff of smoke, looking at his cousin now with indifferent eyes. Riette, who had been preoccupied with his growing questions, looked up at the sound of his name, schooling his expression immediately. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you create your scandals in your own estate and not mine?\u201dThough Matthias slightly quirked up the corner of his lips into a smile, his eyes told a different story. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember? I\u2019m willing to do anything to keep Arvis in order.\u201d He blew one last puff of smoke before disposing of his newly used cigarette to light up a new stick.Both cousins locked eyes on one another, Matthias resolutely trailed on Riette, who still could not pick up any hint of his emotions. There was no tell of jealousy, anger or anything else, other than indifference. In fact, Matthias greatly resembled that of a mischievous child.\u2018Your cousin was a gentlemanly demon.\u2019Riette\u2019s mind flashed back to the officer he met not too long ago. He held quite the appalled expression as he had been describing how the Duke looked like while on the battlefield. Riette involuntarily swallowed his saliva, making his mouth feel dry. His hands lightly shook the longer they kept eye contact.\u201cI\u2019m sure you know that better than anyone else.\u201d Matthias finished in a low tone, warning him slightly before breaking eye contact. At that moment, Riette could see his cousin looked a little worse for wear, a slight look of fatigue could be seen in his face.\u2018I don\u2019t understand him.\u2019\u00a0Riette thought, before sighing out, his smoke mixing with the growing fog in the room as both men continued to puff out their cigarettes.\u00a0\u2018Perhaps a little more provocation is in order, though I do wonder\u2026\u2019His thoughts trailed off as he regarded the growing embers at the end of his stick. He brought it to his mouth and took a long breath in, before blowing another drawn out puff into the office\u2026\u2018I wonder if the answers I will find, prove useful to you, Claudine?\u2019\u00a0and so Riette swallowed back down his nervousness to calm his nerves.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Tap. Tap. Tap.The familiar sound of Phoebe pecking her window broke through the silence of the dimly lit room. Normally, Leyla would have opened it up to let her bird in. However, she found herself stuck in her head, staring into nothing but the space in front of her as she curled in on herself, lying on her side on the bed.She blinked occasionally, looking but not really seeing what was in front of her. Should anyone stare at her eyes now, they\u2019d find themselves feeling as though they were looking inside a deep, yet empty well.Leyla couldn\u2019t remember how the accident happened or how she returned to the cabin. She had simply wanted to run away from Marquis Lindman, but next thing she knew, she was met with a burst of light coming towards her, and not a second later, felt faint pain that spread throughout her entire body.Though it hurt a lot to be hit, it felt nothing compared to when she found out that the car she was hit with belonged to Duke Herhardt, who had been inside during the incident, with his fiance, Claudine.At that moment the physical pain she felt was nothing compared to the sudden sting inside her heart. All she could think about at that moment was to escape, to be as far away as possible from them.A few more minutes had passed before she was finally back to herself, but opted to remain in bed for a little while longer. The accident earlier left her with no tear on her skin or fracture in her bones. But it did leave behind a few bruises, and pain in her left shoulder and back, which took most of the hit. It felt as though her bones would crack every time she moved.She should probably get some sleep in, and rest early, but the pain made it impossible to even close her eyes. Eventually Leyla managed to convince herself to get up from her fetal position to open the window for Phoebe to get in.Once the bird fluttered by the windowsill, Leyla noticed there was a note attached by her bird\u2019s ankle. Her eyes narrowed as she suspected the note might have come from Duke Herhardt. She was certain of that.With a deep sigh, Leyla untied the note, and lightly caressed Phoebe for a moment. Sensing that she had done its job, Phoebe flew back to its cage, having eaten its fill back at the Duke\u2019s mansion.Leyla pursed her lips as she stared at the note, pondering if she could leave the note unread.\u00a0Deciding otherwise, she quickly closed her window shut and sat down by the edge of the bed. She unrolled the note open, grabbing her glasses by the pillow beside her to read its content.[You need to bring the handkerchief, Leyla. If you don\u2019t come here, I\u2019ll go there instead.]Leyla\u2019s hand shook as she read the note, her fists clenching at the trepidation that came over her. She soon dropped the crumpled letter on the bed, before sliding down in anxiousness. She clutched the end of the bed, hands fisting over the sheets as her body shook, before she let out a quiet sob.Her hands came up shakily to grab her glasses, tossing it carelessly aside before burying her face into her pillow to release a muffled scream! She felt as if she was going mad!\u2018If only\u2026 If only I could\u00a0 run to a place far away from this man.\u2019However no matter how hard she wished, reality still caught up to her. She was still here, she was still in Arvis, which meant she was still within his reach. Which brought her back to the letter\u2019s content.Should she decide not to go to him, he would not hesitate to come to her instead. He wouldn\u2019t mind it too, if he was to be caught by Uncle Bill.\u2018Should that happen then Uncle Bill would\u2026\u2019\u00a0Leyla\u2019s thoughts trailed off as she recalled one of the things her Uncle Bill had told her some time ago\u2026\u2018You\u2019ll become a pretty decent adult.\u2019Uncle Bill\u2019s fond smile, and soft voice filtered through her mind, bringing fresh tears into Leyla\u2019s eyes. No matter what others had said about her, what rumours spread, Uncle Bill had always been there for her. He believed in her when no one else did. He had been, still is, proud of her and her achievements. He made sure she knew that too.\u201c You\u2019re almost like the Duke\u2019s mistress, are you not?\u201dThat one sentence, from Marquis Lindman immediately crushed the light feeling from Uncle Bill, with a bitterness that was hard to swallow.She struggled for a while, but managed to find footing to raise herself up from the floor. Leyla gingerly reached out for her bag, which had been thrown haphazardly on her desk, and took out the handkerchief that had been weighing her down all day.Resolving to end this quickly, she clutched the handkerchief and immediately turned to leave her room, locking it behind her. As she passed by the living room, Leyla slowed her steps as she listened to Uncle Bill\u2019s soft and steady snores. She hated that she had to leave Uncle Bill, but she knew she needed to if she wanted to escape Matthias.She really despised the Duke, so much\u2026, so she felt as though her heart would burst into flames. It didn\u2019t matter if it was Marquis Lindman who had been the indirect cause of her accident, it was the Duke\u2019s involvement with her to blame everything going wrong in her life.She walked out of their house, and braved the woods at night, with only the moonlight to light her way. Overhead the clouds rolled by, often dimming the moon\u2019s glow, but Leyla could see just fine in the dark. She was familiar with these woods.She walked the same path she always took towards the annex, reaching the clearing that led to the Schulter river in no time. Leyla picked up her pace, eager to put this entire thing behind her. She was freezing, as the nightly chill washed over her, but her cheeks burned with her frustration, giving her heat in the cold.\u201cYou came.\u201dLeyla stopped when she heard the voice from the darkness. It was Matthias. He was leaning against the railing by the stairway that led outdoors, connected towards the dock and the annex\u2019s second floor. His gaze was resolutely locked onto her form, regarding her with a resigned air.\u201cI was just about to leave.\u201d He hummed, before he pushed himself off the railing, and began to saunter towards her with a predatory grin as she stood frozen in place. Once he was only a step away from her, he stopped in his tracks and took in the sight of her.Leyla\u2019s blonde locks were tussled by the wind, her hair and skirt swaying slightly with the night breeze. He also took note of the goosebumps up and down her arms, and the slight shiver she involuntarily made.\u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d He frowned in concern as he noted she wasn\u2019t dressed warmly.Leyla scoffed at the sudden concern he was showing her. Where was it when she had been hit by his car earlier? But that didn\u2019t matter to her, not anymore.She thrust her hand out in front of Matthias, her hand holding the clean handkerchief towards him to take. \u201cHere, I\u2019m returning your handkerchief to you.\u201d She huffed out, cold puffs of smoke escaping her.\u201cLeyla-\u201d but Matthias got cut off, as she hastily made him take the handkerchief back, before pulling away from him.\u201cGoodbye then Duke,\u201d She bid him adieu, \u201cI hope to never see you again, ever.\u201d She finished, turning swiftly on her heels. Her task was done, and she felt some weight lift off her shoulders the more she put some distance between them.Only her soft footfalls echoed through the forest. Leyla breathed in the earthy scent of the trees around her, making her head feel clear and refreshed despite her dark surroundings, despite the way her body shook with every step due to her bruised body.\u201cI order you to stop, Leyla!\u201d Matthias commanded, a few steps behind her, making Leyla jolt in surprise. She attempted to break out into a run, but found her body frozen after hearing his command.He caught up to her in no time.\u201cLeyla,\u201d He called out to her softly, his hands grazing the back of her hand, trailing it up to her left shoulder, before she regained her movement and slapped his hand away from her.\u00a0 \u201cLeyla!\u201d Matthias\u00a0 exclaimed in frustration.Immediately he crowded into her personal space, face set into a frown as he grabbed her, and lifted her bridal style as though she weighed nothing more than a feather.\u201cAckh!\u201dLeyla choked on her scream at the sudden change in orientation, before realising what was happening to her.\u201cNo! Let me go! Let go!\u201d She yelped, struggling against his hold, but Matthias resolutely held onto her, before shifting his hold on her and hauled her over his shoulder like she was a sack of potatoes.Leyla kept thumping her fists against his back, kicking and screaming against him but he made no indication he had been affected by anything she\u2019d done so far. Matthias resolutely climbed up the flight of stairs into the annex building all poised and steady despite his struggling companion.Leyla\u2019s screams grew louder with each step, but they were deep enough into the forest and no one else would hear them at this time of night. Matthias kept walking down the corridor, leading them both towards the reception room.He then reached his bedroom, opening the door without delay, before dragging Leyla inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Suddenly she felt her whole body shift once more, before she was unceremoniously dumped off of him.It was only when her back hit the familiar feeling of a soft bed did she realise where he had taken her and what he planned to do with her. She looked around frantically before scrambling to get up the bed.\u201cN,no! Go away! No!\u201d Leyla screamed hysterically, the pain in her body momentarily forgotten. The white sheets which had been painstakingly prepared just this morning began to wrinkle beneath her weight, her thrashing crumpling the sheets in no time.\u201cStay still.\u201d Matthias ordered sternly, immediately catching one of Leyla\u2019s flailing wrists and pulled her still\u2026\u201cAckh!\u201dThe pain she had forgotten returned in full force, bringing tears into her eyes as she yelped in pain. Matthias frowned, and immediately released his hold on her.Just as he did, Leyla twisted her body further away from him that she had almost fallen off the bed. Fortunately, Matthias\u2019 reflexes were quick, and managed to stop her from toppling over, this time his hold gentler from moments ago. However his resumed contact with her only served to make Leyla thrash some more in panic.\u201cLet go! Let go of me!\u201d She shrieked, but Matthias held onto her resolutely, careful not to put too much pressure on her this time. Leyla continued to thrash, making him take a deep breath.\u201cIf I let go of you now while you move so recklessly then you\u2019ll only injure yourself further.\u201d He tried explaining, but Leyla wasn\u2019t listening, continuing to thrash around in order to escape from him.\u201cNo! No! No!\u201d She kept pushing him away. The more she protested, the more it grated on Matthias\u2019 nerves. He won\u2019t say it out loud, but he would admit to himself that he misplaced his anger a while ago on Leyla when he had scolded and grabbed her harshly.The anger was for his cousin, Riette von Lindman, after all. And he had dumped it on her in a fit of anger. However now, he could only feel concern over her battered body.Matthias knew very well that Leyla would have hidden from her Uncle Bill the fact she had been involved in a car accident, much less had been the victim of one, so he had prepared beforehand some medicine, safely tucked away in his room at the annex. He brought it here, all the way from his mansion.He had planned to bring her here from the start, reeling her in with the sparsely written note he had attached to the leg of her precious bird. Matthias can\u2019t help but laugh mirthlessly to himself as he remembered how imprudent he had been acting, watching as she dragged herself to the edge of the bed.Just as Leyla was about to bolt off the bed and out of the room, Matthias intercepted her and gently plopped her back onto the bed, making her huff out in surprise. She finally looked up at him and began to beg\u2026\u201cDuke, don\u2019t be like this, please.\u201d She pleaded, hastily moving back from him as she attempted to escape once again, but Matthias swiftly got on top of her, straddling her waist, keeping her in place. He grabbed both of her wrists gently, pinning them over her head as he held her down.Leyla struggled feebly beneath him, squirming futilely before sobs wracked her body as a terrible wave of helplessness washed over her.\u00a0\u201cSt-stop, please,\u201d She begged, fat tears streaming down her face, \u201cPlease, I\u2019m begging you, stop! It hurts, it hurts so much\u2026\u201d She whispered.She\u2019d been paralyzed by both her fear and the Duke looming above her. The pain in her body screamed for relief the more she strained as she lay on the bed.\u201cDuke please,\u201d Leyla called out pleadingly, whispering beneath him, \u201cIt hurts so much.\u201d She sniffed, crying softly from under him. The Duke\u2019s face began to blur as fresh tears kept forming, but she resolutely met his gaze, as he eyed her carefully.\u201cDid he touch you?\u201d Matthias inquired, \u201cDid Riette touch you in any way?\u201d He whispered as he eyed her slowly from the face to the bottom of her belly.Matthias tilted his head as his eyes met hers once more, prodding gently for her to answer truthfully. His hair swayed to the side as he did, revealing his intense gaze on her.Immediately Leyla shook her head in denial despite the sobs wracking through her. She hated what Marquis Lindman had done to her, but hated all the more that Matthias had found out about it. He shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201cN-no,\u201d She began to explain, \u201cHe only teased me rather badly that I got so scared that I couldn\u2019t help but just up and left in such a hurry.\u201dMatthias listened intently as she stammered through her explanation. The shaking of her body seemed to finally calm down after a few more rounds of her crying, then stopping, then crying again, until she calmed herself into exhaustion.Her cheeks glistened with the streaks left by her tears. Gently, Matthias pried off his fingers that held down her arms before moving to caress her hands, gone was the strong grip from before replaced only with such gentle and tender caresses.\u201cStay still, Leyla.\u201d He murmured softly, interlocking their fingers together as Leyla stiffened beneath his touch on instinct. \u201cLie still,\u201d He repeated as he held her gaze, \u201cI promise it won\u2019t hurt, not even a little.\u201d and he dipped his head down a little closer to her.Leyla forced herself to watch as Matthias loomed over her, eyes darting to her prone figure on the bed, then to the room they were in. The two of them were the only ones in the annex, which was located deeply inside the forest.In her head she had already imagined the multiple scenarios she could have done to push him away and make her escape, but she knew there was no escape now. And that just pushed her deeper into despair.\u201cYou promise?\u201dLeyla finally responded in a meek voice. She was being quite foolish right now, but she was also earnest. She had no choice but to submit right now. She was at his mercy after all.She hoped that he would also grant her a small mercy in her vulnerable state.Leyla looked up at Matthias pleadingly as he remained unresponsive to her inquiry. She shivered as he stared at her some more. His eyes raked her up and down in appreciation, wetting his lips lightly at the sight of her tear-streaked face.Finally, Matthias nodded at her in promise, making her sigh deeply in relief as she relaxed underneath him. He pulled himself away from her, hands digging into the pocket of his jacket where he had shoved the returned handkerchief carelessly in his haste to catch up to Leyla.Leyla allowed herself to remain still despite being unbounded by the Duke\u2019s hands, watching his hands, and believing in the promise he\u2019d take care of her. She watched as he brought the handkerchief next to her forehead, and began slowly dabbing away the sweat on her brow.Matthias kept gently wiping at her face, grabbing her chin gently to keep her eyes on his when she instinctively tried to turn her head away from him. Her emerald orbs shone brightly in the dimmed light. He tucked back her ear a few stray locks of her hair before fully standing up as he finished wiping her face clean.Leyla watched attentively every move he made, struggling to stay still so as to not aggravate him. Matthias then got off the bed as he rummaged through some of the things he had set aside, and returned with a medicine box in hand.He then sat down by the edge of the bed, and laid it on the bedside table, before turning to her calmly.\u201cShow me your injuries.\u201d He gently ordered, and Leyla immediately shook her head frantically, and began retracting her words from before\u2026\u201cOh, there\u2019s no need really! I wasn\u2019t really injured even-\u201d\u201cYou said it hurts.\u201d Matthias interrupted, \u201cYour words were: it hurts\u2026 so much.\u201d He reminded, eyes narrowed as he regarded her.\u201cNo, I was\u2026 that was\u2026\u201dLeyla stumbled through an explanation, unable to provide a good excuse on the spot as she gingerly sat up from her position. Her eyes darted everywhere around her but his.Slightly annoyed by her stubbornness and refusal to look at him, Matthias began to uncuff the sleeves of her blouse, immediately gaining her attention. She panicked and began to struggle once more as he rolled them up to her elbows.\u201cI guess the arms were uninjured then?\u201d He remarked dryly, swifting grabbing the hem of her skirts, riding them up further as it hiked above her knees.Yelping in the suddeness of his actions, Leyla stilled his hands immediately, \u201cBack!\u201d She blurted out, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s my back\u2026 that hurts\u2026\u201d She trailed off in all honesty. Matthias stopped moving his hands as he stared at her, urging her to continue, \u201cI hurt my back a little, and my left shoulder.\u201d she reluctantly admitted.He pursed his lips together, backing away from her to give her one more once over, to determine if she was telling the truth. His fingertips tapped on the lid of the medicine box rhythmically, making Leyla squirm in the silence between them, before the tapping stopped.\u201cI want to see it then.\u201d He demanded, \u201cTake it off.\u201dLeyla\u2019s eyes snapped towards him, before shaking her head in denial once more, unwilling to remove any layers of clothing around him. But Matthias wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. His eyes narrowed at her before growling under his breath.\u201cIf you won\u2019t let me take a look, then I won\u2019t hesitate to call the doctor for you!\u201d He hissed and stood up, grabbing the medicine box with him. \u201cAnd not just any doctor, mind you, but Dr. Etman!\u201d He threatened her.Leyla\u2019s breath hitched at the thought, before shaking her head once more, pleading for him not to do it. She would rather drown\u00a0 by the Schulter River than be caught dead by Kyle\u2019s father in such a compromising position! She looked practically scandalous as she lay on the Duke\u2019s bed!\u201cThen make the choice Leyla.\u201d He gave her an ultimatum, \u201cEither strip and allow me to assess your injuries myself, or I will call for Dr. Etman.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias had left her alone with her thoughts, basking in the room\u2019s silence for quite some time now. Leyla\u2019s body was still aching due to the strain it underwent with her thrashing and squirming.Matthias waited patiently for her final decision. He reclined against the nearby chair as he continued to run his eyes up and down her figure.He sighed deeply, watching her rumpled form on his bed, hair a mess and eyes swollen red. There was something sensual in the way she basked in the dim lighting, all shrouded in doubt, fear, sprinkled with a dash of hope and trust in him.\u201cDo\u2026 Do you really promise?\u201dLeyla finally asked, breaking the silence. Her eyes clenched shut as she resigned herself to her fate. It didn\u2019t matter anyway if she would try to negotiate with him. His promises, her promises, they were only just words unless they made it true.She was well aware by now that Matthias could do whatever it takes, just so he could get what he wanted in the end. Just as he once did before. The circumstances between them hadn\u2019t changed. She was still bound to cross paths with him, doomed to suffer in his presence.She would only complicate things further for herself if she would continue to resist. She had her answer now. She\u2019s made a decision. But that didn\u2019t stop the fresh tears from running down her face as she felt utterly useless in front of him.The tears flowed, saturating her blouse the more she cried while Matthias continued to stare at her.\u2018How happy he must be again to see me cry.\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought miserably, she choked down her sobs, swallowing as she turned away from him, giving him a silent permission to undress her himself.She felt the rustle of his clothes, and the dipping of the bed. Calloused hands came up to her shoulder, caressing her back gently as it trailed towards the buttons at the back of her blouse. Slowly, she felt the gradual loosening of her blouse as his fingers deftly unbotted it one by one\u2026Her body shook with sobs as she kept her head down, aiding in removing her blouse once everything had been unbuttoned. She wanted to keep even just a little bit of her pride by refusing to look at the Duke.The cloth slid down her skin, revealing the soft, smooth flesh underneath. It had only been a second, but for Matthias it felt as though time moved slowly, sensually revealing inch by inch her skin, teasing him, goading him to touch it. From the slender slope of her neck, to her petite shoulders\u2026His eyes travelled further down, following the perfect curve of her back, riddled with blotches of red bruises. It looked as though any touch of his would bring her to her knees in front of him.Matthias found himself mesmerised by the swelling on her back. It was littered everywhere on the expanse of her left shoulder blade, down to her waist. It was no wonder why she wailed like she did in pain.He found himself amazed by her strength in brushing her injuries as if they were nothing as she continued to bike away from him. Though she did look a little pathetic as she did so as well, running away like a dog with her tail between her legs.\u2018If I had ignored it , you would\u2019ve hid your bruises and suffered all by yourself.\u2019\u00a0Matthias thought, causing an anger-like feeling to well up inside him. Opting to push it down, he began to move, lightly touching the bruises\u2026Only Leyla yelped in pain, making her flinch away from him, twisting her body as if to shield her prone side despite her state of undress. He hummed in thought, a frown marring his face. It would prove difficult to treat her if a slight touch would cause her too much pain.\u201cTell me if the pain gets worse.\u201dMatthias murmured softly as he moved his hands, touching the areas around the bruises instead as he assessed the extent of her injuries. Whenever she tensed up beneath his fingertips, or let out soft groans, he would ease up, and move to the next area after she had relaxed once more.It was fortunate that Leyla could still move her arms and shoulders. The ribs and spine seemed to be fine as well. Overall, she was in good condition considering a car had hit her. The creases on his forehead disappeared as he found himself relieved and quickly proceeded with the treatment.He took some smoothing salve, before wrapping her bruised shoulder with bandages in silence. Leyla sat still, head still looking down, as her body shook in the tension between them.Matthias rubbed smoothing circles on her uninjured side as he went and wrapped her bruises securely, yet tenderly. He had been right; she was smooth to the touch, very soft beneath his fingers.He wanted to touch her more. She was such a frail woman indeed; so small and so vulnerable.\u201cLeyla.\u201dMatthias softly whispered. Leyla found herself raising her head in response, a little dismayed at how quickly she did so. By the mantle on the fireplace, hung a large mirror, with an intricate golden frame. In it, was her reflection.She met her gaze in it, seeing as clear as day, the shame and despair written in her eyes.Her eyes then shifted to meet Matthias\u2019 in the mirror, seeing his cerulean eyes staring back at her. A strange feeling came over her, locking her in place as she found herself unable to look away despite the terror she was feeling.\u2018Why\u2026?\u2019She wondered to herself the more she looked at him through the mirror, trying to convey the question with her eyes\u2026So innocent\u2026 so clearly looking at him for some sort of explanation as to why this was all happening.\u2018Ah \u2026\u2019Matthias chuckled dryly to himself in his mind, his eyes breaking contact to take in her now bandaged shoulder. He felt too hot, his breath controlled, yet too harsh as he struggled to wet his parched lips.His eyes went back to look at Leyla once more, before realising that he had been the one to back away first from her. In all his years of knowing Leyla, he\u2019d never once backed down for her.\u2018Damn it.\u2019He cursed himself for his ineptitude. He felt as though he had been cursed, but only he could feel the way his body grew hotter, breathing out hot puffs of air through his mouth.Before he could let out another sigh, Matthias leaned\u00a0 forward and planted a light kiss on Leyla\u2019s shoulder in order to turn a blind eye to the unfamiliar emotion stirring inside him and a vague attempt to console the wounded girl. He wasn\u2019t acting like himself, but he found that didn\u2019t mind; not even a little bit.\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Matthias tenderly whispered in Leyla\u2019s ear while she attempted to turn her body away. His voice dipped down into a husky tone, creating a strange sensation travelling down Leyla\u2019s spine.She hastily avoided his gaze once more, unable to look any longer in the mirror.The last sight she saw was seared into her mind. His strong imposing figure loomed behind her vulnerable form; his large calloused hands wrapped around her bare waist. She tried to subtly shrug the hand off of her, but was unsuccessful to do so.Matthias continued to trail soft kisses through the expanse of her shoulders, before on hand travelled to grab and interlock their fingers together.As the pain in Leyla\u2019s body began to soothe, she found it being replaced with a foreign sensation pooling in the pit of her stomach.Leyla clenched her eyes shut, feeling more vividly the way the duke\u2019s warm breath grazed her skin.The touch of his lips, and the impression it left as he continued his tender ministrations across her bruises, were as soft as a feather.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A peaceful dream in an unfamiliar way. She still couldn\u2019t believe it happened.In the time that passed, Marquis Lindman had finally returned to his estate, and the Duke no longer sent her letters demanding her, or gave her unexpected visits. Soon autumn left, and winter had taken its first step upon its month-long journey, bringing with it a new season. Leyla opened up her window, breathing in the cold chill in the air, loving the smell winter brought.She quite enjoyed the breeze, senses numbed to the cold for a while, as she appreciated the way the sun would hit the snow, making it glint as though the forest was made of diamonds.She kept the window wide open, until the cold began biting at her fingertips. With one last deep breath, she shut it closed and turned around to get ready for the day.Today was the day of the charity performance prepared by the school children at the town hall in downtown, so her preparation before going to work took a little longer than usual. Shosted royalty and the children were the ones going on stage, which meant she couldn\u2019t wear the usual clothes she would.This year\u2019s performance was being held in a reputable venue. It hosted many events which prominent figures and powerful people had attended regularly. She needed to look her best for the school and her students.\u2018You have to present yourself as a dignified teacher. Okay, Miss Lewellin?\u2019Even the Principal knew she needed to improve her wardrobe. She even added in a few more remarks about her image during yesterday\u2019s meeting, especially about hoping to avoid seeing Leyla ride her bike to the town hall.Leyla couldn\u2019t help but frown at the thought, hands busying themselves as she braided her hair into an updo style. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with riding my bike?\u201d she muttered under her breath.She finished rather quickly with her hair.\u00a0 She was rather thankful for her newly gained experience in that department by the way, seeing as she had to do so multiple times throughout the semester.\u2018That hair, it doesn\u2019t suit you.\u2019Ah, just when she thought he wouldn\u2019t find a way to disturb her. But it seemed even in her thoughts she couldn\u2019t escape him. Those had been the words the Duke gave her by the platanus road during the early autumn season.The autumn sun had just filtered through her room, hitting the mirror and rebounding in an angle that hit her hair. She had flinched at his sudden reflection of appearance on the mirror, having felt he was watching her. Leyla quickly turned her gaze away, just like how she avoided his eyes back then too.\u2018It\u2019s beautiful, your hair. It\u2019s like a wing.\u2019And suddenly, a dam broke in her mind as one after another she recalled every compliment he had ever given her. It flustered her more than the insults he sent her way. Especially when he\u2019d look at her with those cold, indifferent eyes.She resumed brushing her hair, checking her side profiles before deeming herself well and ready for the day. It was fortunate that unlike her memories of their latest night together, the bruises on her shoulder had begun to fade.He had been true to his word that night after all.True enough, she had been terrified out of her wits when he carted her off to his room. The tension between them in the beginning had been so thick, you could have cut it with a knife. But that soon diminished with each kiss he planted on her bruises.He let her be, and treated her carefully, as though he didn\u2019t mind the struggling and thrashing she made moments before. His gentle touch trailed along her injuries, rubbing the soothing salve to numb the pain before wrapping bandages protectively around them.His movements were so calm, and skillful, it rivalled that of a doctor\u2019s. Not to mention his azure eyes resolutely trained on her, even as she sluggishly put her clothes back on\u2026In the corner of her eyes, she spotted a clock, making her gasp at the time. Immediately, Leyla rose from her seat and rechecked herself on the mirror one last time, before flitting around the room for some last minute preparations.The dress she wore was brand new, which she bought with her own money just for today\u2019s event. She dashed around, looking for a good pair of shoes, before snatching up some high heels. Leyla could already imagine her feet throbbing with pain by the end of the day, but she would need to endure it. Satisfied with her final look, she finally went out of her room.\u201cAh, you\u2019re so pretty Leyla!\u201d Uncle Bill greeted her with awe as he regarded his niece. He had just come out of the kitchen, making some breakfast. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the prettiest one tonight at the town hall!\u201d he praised. Leyla only giggled disbelievingly before responding.\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty others who\u2019ll dress better than I,\u201d she pointed out, \u201cThere will be tons of young ladies and madams attending the event.\u201d\u201cAh, but what have they got against you?\u201d her uncle pointed out, \u201cNeither their silver nor gold on their skin could make them hold a candle to you!\u201dLeyla rolled her eyes.\u00a0\u201cPerhaps not in my uncle\u2019s eyes.\u201d she hummed, a fond smile creeping up the corner of her lips as she sat across from him.\u201cOh, yes, I just remembered,\u201d Bill said before gesturing to his neck, \u201cThe necklace you have, why don\u2019t you wear it as well?\u201d he suggested, taking a bite out of his breakfast. Leyla\u2019s brows furrowed in confusion before widening upon remembering.\u201cAh! You mean the necklace you bought for me?\u201d\u201cYes! The one you wore for the Duke\u2019s party last year.\u201d he swallowed, before cutting up more of his food, \u201cI think it would perfectly complement your outfit today. You don\u2019t have to wear it if you don\u2019t want to, but I\u2019m certain what a sight it will be!\u201dBill Remmer might know nothing when it comes to women\u2019s fashion, he was certain indeed that no one could hold a candle to his niece\u2019s beauty. Just remembering the way Leyla stood out at the Duke\u2019s party was enough to make him so proud that even just for that one night, he could turn Leyla into a beautiful princess.Leyla smiled and nodded, seeing the smile in her uncle\u2019s eyes as he suggested it. She got up from her seat and went back to her room, searching for where she had kept the necklace in. She reached deep inside her closet, before she found it.She straightened up, and clasped the necklace around her bare neck. Deeming it secure and worn well, she went back out and stood in front of her uncle, arms tucked behind her, as she puffed out her chest to showcase the necklace more.\u201cSo, how do I look?\u201d she asked him demurely, and Bill cheered jovially at seeing Leyla wearing the necklace once more.\u201cAh! Absolute perfection, my dear.\u201d he praised before clasping warm, gentle hands on her shoulder, before giving her a brief hug. He pulled away and looked at her, eyes wrinkled with a smile, before looking at her with a slight concern\u2026\u201cNow you be careful out there Leyla, don\u2019t stray too far,\u201d Bill warned her softly, \u201cYou\u2019ll catch a lot of attention because of how you look, but be wary of them too, or they might just take you away for themselves.\u201d he finished, and Leyla nodded in agreement.\u201cI will uncle, don\u2019t worry.\u201d she promised.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*She was like a dot from a far, hardly recognizable at such a distance, but Matthias could spot her even from a mile away, a slight curve up the corner of his mouth began to appear.He knew it was Leyla, the woman who was walking along the path\u00a0 through the hunting grounds, all the way towards the rose garden behind the mansion. He tilted his head at the sight of her, his brows furrowing in wonder\u2026\u2018Why is she walking to work today?\u2019Matthias let out a low whistle, moving closer towards the window, and outstretched his hand, index finger popping up in wait. Not a moment sooner a little bird fluttered to land on it.He brought the bird up close to his eye level, using the sight of Leyla drawing near as a backdrop to it. He leaned against his window sill by the damask curtains that hung from the ceiling down to the floor. It swayed with the wind, framing him perfectly from behind, and hiding him from any passerby.He shifted his arm, as if to present his canary to the unsuspecting woman, but the bird had fluttered away, and right back into its cage. The introduction to his two birds were unsuccessful, but that didn\u2019t mean it was entirely a waste. And so Matthias stayed by the window, even long after Leyla had disappeared from his sight.It had become some sort of routine of his, to perch by the windowsill every morning for the view it offered, day after day. And all the while, he\u2019d only look, waiting for the moment she would leave the quaint gardener\u2019s cabin, and into the path through the forest just to go to work.At this spot in his mansion, he could always see her, and what she would do whenever she\u2019d go home.\u2018Is she all better now?\u2019He couldn\u2019t help but think as he recalled how frail she looked the last time he saw her so close. She had been all bruised up and in pain. Her quivering body as she sobbed desperately at him\u2026Those flushed, tear-stained cheeks, and glistening emerald eyes. He could just lose himself at the sight of her.It was a shame he hadn\u2019t had the fortune of running into her, or see her since then. He could have gone to see her, much like he did before, but this time he chose not to. There had been some strange stirrings in him, that night, feelings he couldn\u2019t put a finger on.Matthias pushed himself away from the window, and settled down onto the wingback chair near the fireplace in deep thought. Absent-mindedly, he reached out towards the morning paper and flipped it open, but his eyes unseeing the words printed on it.His mind kept returning to those tears she shed that last night. He\u2019s seen her cry countless times now, but there had been something different about the way she did last. It was imprinted in his mind by now, and he couldn\u2019t escape it\u2026\u2018Wait,\u2019Matthias recalled him saying, as he prevented her from leaving right after he managed to bandage her, and handed over some medicine.\u2018These are painkillers, drink them sparingly.\u2019Leyla\u2019s face, at that moment, grew contemplative as she eyed the bottle, still in his outstretched hand, warily. Impatiently, he opened the lid as he neared her. She flinched under his touch when he had suddenly grabbed her by the chin, gently prying her mouth open to pour the liquid medicine down her throat.She took it like a veteran, eyes trailed at him in an indecipherable manner, gulping the medicine down as best as she could despite the bitter flavour. Matthias smirked as he watched her struggle.Once he was satisfied by her medicine intake, he gently wiped the excess medicine that dripped down the corner of her lips with the returned handkerchief. Once she had been wiped clean, he took out a piece of candy in his pocket, and popped it in her mouth.Leyla had blinked back tears as he continued to shower her with his care, unable to make a sound. The tears flowed down her cheeks once more, as she kept the candy inside her mouth, neither spitting or making an effort to swallow it.Finally, he had been unable to hold back, and began to caress\u00a0 her cheeks, not minding the way it soaked his hand. His movements were stiff, and unpracticed, but he kept going.\u2018Does it still hurt?\u2019He couldn\u2019t help but inquire. He\u2019d never felt so useless before, so helpless, when he\u2019d asked her that. Leyla nodded back in reply not a moment soon. Unable to do anything else, Matthias gathered her up in his arms once more, and held her in comfort.She tried to resist him at first, but eventually gave in. She continued to tear up in his arms, tongue rolling the candy around in her mouth for quite a long time. By the time she stopped crying, the front side of his sweater was completely soaked with tears.Even the memory of it brought a certain sorrow to Matthias. He let out a sigh, and set aside the paper he hadn\u2019t bothered to read. He leaned his head back, until all he could see was the ceiling.He really can\u2019t get that image of her out of his mind. Normally when Leyla would cry, all he could feel was amusement. He liked seeing a pretty face cry, so he\u2019d relentlessly bully her. Though there were times, too, when it bothered him to see them.It made him irritant that anything, or anyone, other than him had made her cry. During those times, he would wish them to stop. No one else but him should make her cry. And not even just her tears\u2026Her smiles, her laughter, hopes and dreams\u2026 everything! Everything she has must be his!She must be his.The tears she kept crying back then made him feel as though he\u2019d lost, and he was at a loss at how to turn his defeat into a victory\u2026Such strange tears indeed.Whenever Leyla would cry, she had the tendency to let her temper get the best of her. Sometimes she\u2019d feel afraid, or even terrified. And he would enjoy every emotion he\u2019d managed to get a rise out of her.But she didn\u2019t even seem to understand why she was crying at that moment. They were not filled with any anger, not even fear of him. They looked like something foreign\u2026Almost as though her eyes were empty. And he found out at that moment he hated those tears very much. He wanted to stop them. It raised in him a feeling he hadn\u2019t felt when he watched Leyla cry over Kyle Etman\u2026Made him want to strangle her just so she would stop crying.Such an odd, uncomfortable feeling indeed festered inside him, but Matthias did not mind it. It was reminiscent of the feeling of getting drunk with a fragrant liquor against his nose. However, it also made him feel as though something was closing in on him.It confused and gratified him immensely.Yes\u2026 it made him quite\u2026 happy.He felt unbridled happiness, completely different from the enjoyment he used to feel whenever he tormented Leyla. He hadn\u2019t tossed her aside because he wanted to feel more from her. To know this joy, and to experience it to the fullest capacity!Leyla had entrusted herself to him. He remembered it, the resignation on her face as he gazed at her exhausted form while he kept comfort.And so he kept wiping the tears away, sweeping her hair back to see her more clearly in the dim lighting. He watched as the slight hope in her eyes turned into unbridled fear, making her entire body tremble in his touch.He waited a long time for her to be at ease, to trust him once more, because whatever joy he felt before was swiftly snuffed out of his system. He wanted it back! But how would he get it once more? The answer was the same.It\u2019s always been the same.A sudden knock disturbed him from his thoughts, making him frown at his broken trail of thoughts. He\u2019d just been onto something important, a little more time and he would have found some resolution. But life has a way of making important things slip through you, much like holding sand in the palm of your hands.\u201cMaster, this is Hessen.\u201d a muffled voice came from behind the door.\u201cCome in.\u201d Matthias calmly answered, his eyes no longer trailed on the ceiling as he straightened up in his seat. He watched as Hessen opened the door, approaching swiftly and stopping by the side of his seat at a respectable distance. Hessen stood at attention, before dipping his head in a bow.\u201cMadam Elysee had asked about the master\u2019s dinner schedule today.\u201dMatthias\u2019 brow quirked up at the news. \u201cMy mother?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Hessen confirmed, \u201cInitially she had planned to attend a charity performance with Madam Norma tonight at the town hall, but she\u2019s fallen ill with fever so she won\u2019t be able to go out.\u201d he explained to his master. \u201cSo, she wondered if you could go in her place, instead, in accompanying Madam Norma. That is, if you have no prior engagements.\u201d\u201cA charity performance you say?\u201d Matthias hummed, as he tapped his fingers on the armrest.\u201cIt\u2019s a performance held by several schools here in Carlsbar,\u201d Hessen hastily informed, \u201cEven children from this village would be taking part.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d he said, smirking to himself.Now he knew why Leyla had walked herself to work today, all dolled up more than she usually does on a normal work day.\u201cIt would be my pleasure to escort my grandmother tonight.\u201d Matthias responded as he got up from his seat, \u201cWell then, we best get prepared properly for the charity event.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just as she\u2019d come out towards the lobby, Mrs. Grever came up to her, face flushed as she saddled up beside her.\u201cMiss Lewellin, look here!\u201d she whispered hurriedly, \u201cIt\u2019s Duke Herhardt! He\u2019s here!\u201d she squealed rather excitedly. Leyla felt as though a bucket of cold water had just been dumped at her.\u201cThe Duke? He\u2019s here?\u201d she hurriedly inquired, looking towards the direction Mrs. Grever had been pointing to, \u201cI thought it would be Madam Herhardt that would be attending tonight.\u201d she murmured as she realised Mrs. Grever was right.Matthias was here.\u201cYes, it\u2019s the Duke, not his mother who is attending.\u201d Mrs. Grever giggled, before cooing in awe, \u201cAnd look! He even brought his grandmother along with him!\u201d she exclaimed.It was surprisingly easy to spot the Duke, mostly because of the crowd that had swarmed him the moment he\u2019d arrived. It was the exact moment she was looking at him, did his eyes manage to meet hers.Leyla felt her chest suddenly constrict underneath his gaze, and lightly tipped her head forward into a bow, pretending as though she was wordlessly greeting him from afar. Fortunately, they didn\u2019t have too much interaction as he was quickly swept away by the crowd.Leyla found herself sighing in relief at his disappearance.\u201cSay, Miss Lewellin, you live right next to Arvis, don\u2019t you?\u201d Mrs. Grever asked, and she nodded, \u201cThen that would mean you see him quite often too?\u201d The missus looked quite despondent that the Duke had disappeared from their immediate vicinity, completely missing the way Leyla shifted on her feet uncomfortably.\u201cI, well, I guess\u2026 sometimes,\u201d she mumbled, hands clasped in front of her as she fidgeted, feeling absolutely guilty even though she had no reason to. Mrs. Grever sighed, pouting slightly.\u201cAh, how lucky of you!\u201d she sighed once again, \u201cIt\u2019s sure quite the treat to see such a handsome face everyday. Even at a distance.\u201d she finished before moving away to get back to choir practice as she had been charged with taking care of the upper class\u2019 performance.Ever since the picnic last autumn, the one held in Arvis, Mrs. Grever had grown quite fond of Duke Herhardt, never missing an opportunity to praise him and his deeds. She would praise how wonderful he was, or how elegant he walked, or how aristocratic he acted.With a sigh of relief, Leyla too went and joined the other teachers for some last minute preparations, when she finally came face to face with the Duke by the hallway. Her steps faltered for a moment, before she regained her composure to keep walking.She hoped that he wouldn\u2019t notice her passing through. He seemed to be engaged in conversation with an elderly gentleman. She couldn\u2019t help but pause once she did pass him by, just to take one last look at him.He looked so tall from where she stood, the long shadow on the marble floor he casted made him look all the more imposing. The suit he wore accentuated his lithe form, though it also perfectly hugged every firm muscle he had on his body.Ever since they were children, he made her so fearful and uncomfortable around him. And despite the numerous praises she heard about him, she couldn\u2019t find it in herself to find out why they thought so highly of him since she obviously thought otherwise.Even now, that fact remained unchanged for her, though she now had an insight as to why he was highly respected in their community. He played his role perfectly as the esteemed Duke Matthias von Herhardt, making everyone believe he was born to be respected.If only they knew, like she knew, how childish he could be. Indeed, she thought it so strange to see him in such a respectable manner. Could she even describe him as her beautiful nightmare?Also, his eyes glinted in the light\u2026\u2018Wait\u2026 eyes?\u2019\u00a0Leyla blinked, before she realised Matthias was now looking straight at her, his body turned slightly towards her direction even as he was talking to the person in front of him.\u2018Why\u2026 Why is he looking at me?\u2019\u00a0she wondered, slowly feeling her cheeks grew warm the longer she held his gaze. Though his eyes betrayed no emotion, she could see the way the corner of his lips lift up into an unnoticeable smirk.\u201cMiss Lewellin, why are you here?\u201dA voice interrupted their silent interaction as Leyla quickly spun around to come face to face with the school\u2019s principal. She drew closer to Leyla, momentarily appraising her looks before nodding satisfactorily, \u201cCome on now, stop dilly dallying, we have more guests to welcome.\u201d she gently reminded, pushing her softly towards the direction she needed to be in.The Principal led Leyla towards where the other teachers had been lounging on, which coincidentally was where Matthias and his grandmother currently were as well. As she was left to the crowd\u2019s mercy, she carefully avoided bumping into anyone, jerking left and right when someone got too close\u2026Before she knew it, she was right near the Herhardts, within Matthias\u2019 line of sight. There was no way she could escape without having to converse with him now. Leyla gulped back down her nervousness at being so close to him after their prolonged separation.Matthias had been busying himself in interacting with the others, guests and teachers alike, before he noticed Leyla had managed to find her way in front of him. She averted her gaze, hoping it would buy her more time, but caught the glimpse of a growing smirk.She looked down, busying herself with the sight of his well-polished shoes and began thinking about the nearing performance of her students\u2026Unfortunately for all her preparations, she hadn\u2019t come to expect to be the butt end of a joke by the time the night ended.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*After the crowd dialled down around them, Norma finally took the time to appraise her grandson. She tilted her head as she observed him critically, seeing the slight glint of his eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re looking quite lively these days, Matthias.\u201d she pointed out with a smile as soon as they sat on their seats, \u201cIs there something you\u2019d like to tell me?\u201d she hummed, eagerly awaiting for an answer to her grandson\u2019s sudden mood change.\u201cHm? No, not really grandmother.\u201d he answered truthfully, unwilling to divulge any information for her, giving her a placating smile. Norma was disappointed that Matthias felt no need to share with her any progress in his day to day life.She knew something had changed. He acted differently than before, giving off a lighter aura about him. He almost looked like someone his own age. Don\u2019t get her wrong, she knows her grandson was one of the most handsome people in existence. He just never acted like his age before, always so mature\u2026Sometimes she would forget how young he actually was until she noticed the slight bounce in his steps, or how lighter he looked. Almost happier even. An absurd thought, if you will, but one she\u2019s unwilling to take back.\u201cAh, well,\u201d she hummed, turning away from him to look towards the stage as the others continued to settle down around them, \u201cEither way, it\u2019s nice to see you like this.\u201d She was only curious after all, but if Matthias felt more comfortable with her not knowing, then who was she to pry further?They sat there in silence, Norma busying herself with a conversation or two with people who stopped by to greet them. She noticed in all their interaction, Matthias looked rather bored, eyes darting here and there, before a slight slouch in his posture told her he was finding everything a little boring.\u201cI know these things may seem quite trivial to you, Matthias, but I like to see it as an opportunity to receive support and respect in these gatherings,\u201d she told him, quiet enough that only the two of them could hear her. \u201cAnd I am delighted to know that despite your duties as the head of our household, you still found the time to participate diligently in events like this.\u201dShe turned to Matthias and patted his chin lovingly, to which he automatically took in his hand and kissed her palm in response.\u201cOh, your grandfather and father weren\u2019t half the man you were at your age. And of that I\u2019m so proud.\u201d She praised him. He truly was the Herhardt\u2019s masterpiece.The public had given Matthias the moniker of being Herhardt\u2019s masterpiece. They\u2019d witnessed his hardwork and glory in the deeds he\u2019d done here and there. Norma couldn\u2019t help but smile in the memory of all of them. And though she\u2019d like to be modest about it, she agreed with the public wholeheartedly.She had been saddened when she outlived her husband, as well as her son, but she believed it was to witness her grandson rise up and beyond the expectations set for him, and see him thrive in it; to bring glory to the Herhardt household once more when its last patriarch left them.Suddenly the lights went out, making the crowd gasp in surprise as Norma was busy admiring her grandson. A drumroll began as some spotlights began darting back and forth everywhere before settling down on the stage. The crowd quieted down and the host finally appeared in a puff of smoke on stage.The crowd began clapping at the dramatic entrance, Matthias included as he straightened up in his seat, but not because of what was happening on stage, oh no. In fact, his eyes were glued on Leyla.He can\u2019t believe how he missed it before, but she was wearing it. She was wearing that exquisite necklace she owned. Yes, upon prolonged inspection, he was certain it was\u00a0his\u00a0emerald necklace she was wearing.Matthias felt the stirrings of satisfaction deep inside him, loving the fact she had it on. It made him feel as though he had marked her, and she was proudly announcing to the world that she belonged to him alone.Whether she knew that he felt that way when she wore it or not, it didn\u2019t matter to him. She was his.Eventually he managed to pull himself away from looking at her and focus on the show. He paid attention to the introduction of the play and watched as the students performed, observing each one of them carefully.The play was about some fairies who lived by the woods. Each child wore translucent wings, with glitters splayed strategically to give it some sparkling effects. They walked and acted in practised manners, delivering their lines nervously.The crowd oohed and awed at the play, chuckling here and there when they would do something adorable. He found that he recognized them as the children who came to have a picnic with Leyla at Arvis.The thought of her made him seek her out, eyes glancing to the dimmed bottom part of the stage, where Leyla sat attentively watching her students. He watched her interaction with them, noting from time to time how the children would glance nervously, looking for their teacher amongst the crowd for cues and validation they were doing the right thing.Suddenly, the smallest, and probably the youngest, of the children began to openly cry, surprising the crowd and the Duke. The wail echoed throughout the venue, momentarily drawing everyone\u2019s attention away from the play. Matthias then recognized the child as the girl who spilled ice cream all over Leyla\u2019s clothes on that picnic.\u2018I wonder how Miss Lewellin would handle this?\u2019\u00a0he wondered, tilting his head as he tried to imagine how Leyla was looking like right now. Judging by how she straightened up, hands silently conveying for the child to relax, that she was beginning to grow nervous herself.\u201cOh dear.\u201d Norma sighed. Matthias spared her a glance before giving the little girl his attention once more. Said little girl was now leaning over the stage, staring right at Leyla as she tried to reach out to her\u2026\u201cTeacheer!\u201d the little girl bawled, her voice echoing in the now silent hall. All other child actors also ceased their presentation, distracted from the sudden interruption. It was clear at this point whatever role the child had was void, which made all the other children begin panicking over what to do as well.\u2018What are you going to do now, Leyla?\u2019\u00a0Matthias asked in his mind, narrowing his eyes at her back. Eventually the principal made her way inconspicuously towards the rookie teacher, whispering in her ear.Whatever she said had made Leyla tense. He watched as they exchanged a few words, Leyla shaking her head frantically at the principal\u2019s insistence. In the end though, the principal got her way and Leyla resigned to her task.Gingerly she got up from her seat amongst the teachers, and slowly went up the stage. She carefully pulled the bawling girl aside and wiped her tears. She was speaking to the child now, softly placating her, he would assume from behind the fake flower bush they used as a prop.The child was now holding onto dear life on her teacher, Leyla letting out a sigh of defeat before rubbing her palms up and down the child\u2019s back to soothe her. Any further delay would only build up more panic amongst the inexperienced children.Just as Leyla was planning on getting off the stage with the child, the Principal came close to her once more, handing her a stack of papers. Matthias watched as she paled at the sight of them, frantically exchanging words with the principal. The principal tried to take the crying child with her, but the girl refused. With that, she left Leyla and the little girl on the stage.\u201cHmm, I think I recognize that teacher.\u201d his grandmother remarked as she squinted her eyes in order to see Leyla better, \u201cYes, isn\u2019t that Bill Remmer\u2019s foster daughter?\u201d she exclaimed softly, looking pleased to see a familiar face.Reluctantly, Leyla went back, hands clasping around the girl\u2019s arm as she dragged her along gently once again, and began to sink down behind the way-too-small of a bush, and began flipping through the papers rather hurriedly. She eyed the crowd a couple of times, clearing her throat as she took a deep breath.It was amusing to see her face growing redder by the second.\u201cU-waa\u2026 look at th-this everyone!\u201d Leyla giggled nervously, \u201cPre-pretty flowers have bloomed.\u201d she finished awkwardly, stuttering through her line, leaving Matthias perplexed at seeing her be a bumbling mess with such a public audience.It seemed as though watching someone more nervous than themselves gave the children a boost of confidence, and the play began to once again resume, each child growing more and more confident in their gait and acting.Though her lines were short, Leyla couldn\u2019t seem to find her composure whenever it was her time to deliver them. The crowd giggled, trying to keep their amusement at bay whenever it was her time to speak.It was just way too funny seeing Leyla so awkward and serious in her task. They tried not to laugh too much, really they did!But then one of the audience let out an unexpectedly loud accidental laugh when Leyla said a line, and suddenly a dam broke! The entire town hall was then filled with boisterous laughter, finally unable to hold back. Even his grandmother, who had been trying to be as respectful as possible, let out a laugh along with the crowd.Matthias went back to looking at Leyla, head resting on his knuckles that were perched on the arm rest. His head tilted as he stared at Leyla with a frown on his face, hardly noticeable in the dim lighting.The child had finally stopped crying, and was now sitting uselessly next to Leyla, flapping her hands up and down. Eventually, the child looked up at her teacher, and as though trying to thank her, she removed the flower crown on her head and placed it in a lopsided manner on top of Leyla\u2019s golden mane.Unfortunately, the child\u2019s efforts had gone unnoticed as Leyla was far too focused on reading the script.\u201cTh-this is a great party! Hahaha!\u201d She laughed dramatically, but the stern expression on her face made it humorous. \u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d She then looked up and smiled shyly at the crowd.At that point, Matthias finally snorted before laughing along with the crowd. Leyla was practically already red in the face, matching the roses on her flower crown, yet she forced herself to continue with the play.Matthias could already predict that in the play, the crowd eagerly awaited for when Leyla would speak up next. And consequently, he could also predict that amongst all the presentations today, this play by the lower years would be the talk of the town starting from tonight.When the play finally came to an end, and Leyla was finally done with her part, she hurried off the stage, smiling politely, yet hurriedly through the crowd\u2019s warm round of applause just for her. Matthias also found himself clapping for her. He\u2019d been thoroughly entertained by the pretty flower fairy tonight, who ended up being the star of the show.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone clapped as the children bowed on stage with Miss Lewellin and they all exited the stage to give way to the upper years.Each child immediately went where their families were located, those who had older siblings had to stay behind and watch the remaining plays, while the rest of the children had to go home for their bedtimes, leaving the town hall with fewer audiences.\u201cWe apologise so much for Monica\u2019s behaviour!\u201d The little girl\u2019s parents repeatedly apologised to Leyla, who was escorting them to their carriage.\u201cPlease, it\u2019s fine!\u201d Leyla tried to reassure them, \u201cIt\u2019s my duty as their teacher to be there for them.\u201d\u201cStill, because Monica couldn\u2019t continue with the play, then Miss Lewellin had to endure getting laughed at during the play.\u201d interjected Monica\u2019s grandmother.At the reminder of the humiliation she had to go through, Leyla flinched slightly, effectively silencing both Leyla and the apologetic parents. Eventually they settled in their carriage, bidding Leyla goodbye. Once they were out of sight, Leyla sighed in relief.\u201cMiss Lewellin, shall we get a cup of hot coffee?\u201d Mrs. Grever immediately offered with a kind smile as she neared Leyla, finally finding her alone. Leyla jolted at her unexpected appearance, before gently shaking her head, smiling back politely.\u201cOh, thank you, but I\u2019m fine.\u201d she reassured, \u201cI think I should get a breather alone for a while.\u201d\u201cOh well, that\u2019s understandable.\u201d Mrs. Grever agreed, before patting Leyla on the shoulder, squeezing it comfortingly, \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I think you make quite a cute fairy, and I enjoyed the play a lot more because of you.\u201dLeyla giggled softly, \u201cThat really doesn\u2019t make me feel that much better.\u201d she jokingly, and both of them chuckled.\u201cI know it doesn\u2019t sound that much better, but it is the truth.\u201d Mrs. Grever said, \u201cUsually the nobles that attend these events rarely pay attention, or even get entertained, but you did. You made them enjoy it, and not make it feel like just a publicity stunt for them.\u201d she sighed and squeezed both of Leyla\u2019s hands this time, \u201cSo you did an amazing job today.\u201dThe words were meant to be comforting, and any other time Leyla might have found comfort in them, but not in this instance. She fought back a grimace as she thought about someone who most certainly was in the audience\u2026\u2018Oh, I bet he really was entertained back there. Oh god.\u2019\u00a0she despaired in her thoughts.\u201cAlso, because of you, the principal predicts our donations will also increase. Which makes her so pleased with you as well.\u201d At the mention of the principal, Leyla couldn\u2019t help but groan.\u201cUgh, I really hate her right now.\u201d she sighed, before they both giggled once more. They both know how overbearing the principal could be when she wanted to. Leyla then proceeded to tell Mrs. Grever, that she would be fine on her own, prompting the missus to go back inside ahead of her.Satisfied that no one was trying to approach or speak to her, Leyla began to trudge along the park, which was located right behind the town hall. She needed time for herself. Each breath she took felt as though she was leaving pieces of her soul behind as she embraced the chill in the night air.The park was indeed devoid of anyone. She sat down on one of the nearest benches and gingerly took off her shoes.\u2018What have I done?\u2019\u00a0she thought as she rubbed her painful feet. White puffs of air escaped as she leaned her head back to look up at the night skies. She let out a long deep breath as she did so\u2026She was surprised she was still alive after that shameful display. Something was building up inside her, threatening to burst!\u201cAAAAHHHHH!\u201d she screamed into the open air, letting her breath turn white as though they carried her soul with them.\u2740\u2740\u2740Matthias found Leyla at the very place he had predicted her to be.He had predicted after being humiliated like that, she would run off to a secluded place. Additionally, she had been wearing heels tonight, she wouldn\u2019t go far and find somewhere to sit. Add to the fact she was a bit of a coward, she would stay by a well-lit place, and still be nearby despite the seclusion. Which could only be the park right behind the town hall.And indeed she was right there, sitting as she looked up at the night sky, seemingly lost in thought. She was barefoot, heels hung by the tips of her fingers instead. She was sitting on a bench by a massive tree, with a street lamp lit up right next to her.He walked slowly with steady steps, his footsteps almost silent in the quiet night and stopped when his shadow loomed over her unsuspecting figure. \u201cI expected you to be here.\u201d he announced, making her gasp in surprise.Leyla whipped her head around, eyes widening at the sight of him within arm\u2019s length.\u201cHo-how did you-\u201d she stuttered, staring up at him before her eyes were darting around them both in a panic. Immediately she grabbed both of her heels tightly before hastily putting them back on, remembering the time when her shoes were snatched away from her.Matthias found himself grinning at the wary look on her face. He looked down, staring pointedly at her shoes, which she was securing to her feet, he hummed as he took a step closer.\u201cYou really think that\u2019s going to stop me from taking your shoes?\u201d he asked her teasingly. Leyla only huffed out a breath, before locking the last of the straps securely and jumped up from her seat, looking a little relieved she managed to completely put them back on.Looking at her now, well, it seemed like he didn\u2019t have to be so worried if her injuries were still bothering her. They seemed to have healed up rather nicely, judging by how fast she was moving compared to before.\u201cDon\u2019t get up on my account.\u201d Matthias tried convincing her to sit back down, but she shook her head, now standing right next to the street lamp.\u201cNo thank you, I\u2019ve sat enough.\u201d Leyla refused politely. Matthias eyes\u2019 narrowed at her for a moment, before pushing down his irritation at her resistance. The street light shone down on her much like the stage lights did just a while back.It wasn\u2019t such a bad sight either, as he continued to roam his eyes appreciatively over her.\u201cYou should\u2019ve been an actress instead of a teacher, Leyla,\u201d he pointed out with a wide smile, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such an actress who\u2019s able to make that large of a crowd laugh so much in one sitting!\u201d he praised.Leyla\u2019s arms tightened around herself, hands gripping tight as she bit her lips and looked down on the ground resolutely. She swallowed her pride before trying to politely reply back to him\u2026\u201cY-yes, my acting was quite clumsy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she laughed nervously, trying to pass it off nonchalantly.\u2018It might even be the reason you sought me out tonight, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u00a0she thought scornfully, but refused to voice it out.\u201cHm, it was, just a little,\u201d he chuckled, eyes watching as her body began to tremble in the continued embarrassment despite their play being over. Leyla began to shift nervously before finally finding the strength to move.\u201cWell, then, I must get going now Duke\u2026\u201d she began to move away..\u201cSo pretty.\u201d Matthias slipped out, making Leyla freeze and look up at him in shock. Her face flushed against the cold at the unexpected complement he had given her. He held her gaze as she struggled to find a reply\u2026\u2018Should I say thank you? No, it\u2019s too ridiculous! Not at all duke? Not that one either.\u2019\u00a0she fully bit her lower lip as she struggled to find the right words, squirming underneath his observation.\u2018Should I just leave? But he\u2019ll catch up to me anyway!\u2019She could feel the way his eyes trailed all over her. From her flushed cheeks, down to her pale neck, and onto her dazzling emerald necklace adorning her neck. She watched as his lips spread out into a pleased smile the more he looked down at her, eyes locked at her necklace.\u201cU-uncle Bill bought them for me.\u201d Leyla finally said, careful to keep ample distance between them. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t talking specifically about her, but her clothes, or maybe her necklace! Yes right, he must be talking about her necklace.\u2018I also got a few compliments before about my necklace.\u2019\u00a0she added as an afterthought. He hummed, before lifting his gaze back to her eyes, watching her for reactions.\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he inquired, making her blink.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe necklace,\u201d Matthias gestured back down before returning his gaze to look into hers, \u201cDo you like it?\u201dA frown marred her face, she was confused as to why that mattered.\u201cUh, of course.\u201d she answered honestly, and Matthias chuckled, making her more confused. What was so amusing? Still she had been surprised to see and hear his laughter. She hadn\u2019t seen him like this\u2026And his laughter\u2026 it sounded low, like his voice, but soft and velvety to the ears.She stared at him in a guarded manner, wary of this new side he was showing her. Eventually he stopped laughing, before locking eyes with her once more. There was tension between them as they both stared each other down\u2026The pregnant silence between the two was broken when there was a sudden chirp, and a bird flapped away from the tree branch near them. Leyla was caught in a surprise, yelping at the sudden disturbance as she whipped around in alarm, just in time to watch the bird fly off into the night.She knew she had to get away quickly from him before they could be seen together. Unfortunately her foot twisted in an awkward manner as she turned to step away from the unexpected intrusion.She tried to right herself back to a balanced position, but Matthias was quicker, swiftly grabbing her by her waist, and pulling her flush to his body.\u201cAh!\u201d she exclaimed as he turned her around, their chests pressed together as he pushed her back into the cold steel of the lamp. He loomed, tall and firm, over her, eyes glinting dangerously.\u201cI-I\u2019m going to scream for help.\u201d she softly threatened, breath quivering in terror. Leyla could feel the tears pooling in her eyelids as she pushed her palms on his chest in an attempt to get him away from her.\u201cDo as you wish.\u201d Matthias dared her, eyes still softly admiring her unwaveringly. He cupped her face with one hand, keeping her gaze on him. \u201cWhere do you hide it?\u201d he asked her as she struggled.Leyla frowned as she looked up at him.\u201cHide? What do you mean? Hide what?\u201d her voice shook as she tried to push him away with all her might. Her eyes looked at him inquiringly, not understanding what he wanted to know from her this time. He kept looking at her, before sighing disappointedly.Matthias thought he\u2019d catch a glimpse of it again, but alas, he was mistaken as it disappeared too quickly this time. Which was frustrating because her beautiful face was enough to erase his growing desire.He lowered his hand slowly, gently caressing her cheeks, grazing the back of his knuckles against her jawline, before resting an open palm around her slender neck. His fingers gingerly wrapped around it, fingertips grazing the pearls of the necklace as she gulped nervously at him.He could feel the way her throat bobbed up and down as she swallowed. She\u2019s so sensitive here\u2026It was so easy to leave his mark all over her body. Just a little pressure on her neck would probably be enough for his hand to leave its mark on that pale skin. Or perhaps he should kiss it deep enough it would leave a mark to stay for days?\u2018How easy it would be, from the top of her head down to the tip of her toes, to leave my mark all over her\u2026\u2019\u00a0he thought, entranced by her pale skin,\u00a0\u2018Then, everyone will know she\u2019s mine, only mine.\u2019He could do it to her, but eventually decided against it as he let out another despondent sigh. Finally, Matthias pulled his hand away from her neck, making Leyla breathe in a sigh of relief, before he was replacing them against her cheeks once more.His fingers touched her lips, rubbing against it\u2019s warm moistness.\u2018If I touch you in there*, would they feel like this too?\u2019\u00a0he wondered out loud. Leyla opened her mouth to protest, but he was already pushing fingers in her mouth, drowning out her resistance.The pads of his fingers rubbed against her tongue, fondling the inside of her mouth as they both breathed heavily against each other. His fingers went deeper, reaching the back of her throat\u2026And with all her strength, Leyla bit down on his fingers. Hard.But Matthias only laughed at such a weak display of strength. He barely even felt it now that his fingers were so deep inside her mouth. He smiled at her feeble attempts to get free.\u201cYou should bite harder, Leyla.\u201d he mused as he watched the way her teeth met his skin. \u201cHarder than that, and then I\u2019ll feel the pain.\u201d he whispered against her, his warm breath hitting her face.The only thought that ran in Leyla\u2019s mind aside from indignation, was how out of his mind the Duke really was.\u2018He\u2019s insane!\u2019She was appalled by the way Matthias was grinning down at her that she could feel her temper spike.And so she loosened up. She knew that no matter how hard she tried to make it hurt, he wouldn\u2019t back off.Seeing her calm down, Matthias gave her a victorious smirk before pulling his fingers out of her mouth, before he stroked her lips with his wet fingers.\u2018If I would kiss you, no doubt you\u2019d protest once again.\u2019\u00a0he thought as he rubbed her plush lips. It would be an easy thing to do too. He knew by now how to quickly snuff out any form of resistance from Leyla.How easy it would be for him to satisfy his lust and greed for her as he\u2019d done so before. However, he found himself unable to do so as he stared at the way she was trapped in his arms. So willing, and so submissive as her hands were now only pressed on his chest, neither pushing or hitting him away from her.He thought of the dreamy moment that had passed by and the joy he had felt.He trailed his hands lower once more, resting it against her neck as he stroked the pale skin again. He found himself at a loss on what to currently do. Unconsciously, he swallowed his mouth dry.\u2018Goddamnit.\u2019\u00a0he thought, the curse threatening to escape from his lips. He found himself clenching and unclenching his other fist, before bringing up both hands this time to cup Leyla\u2019s face.With a quiet sigh, Matthias finally pulled away, letting her go. Leyla felt puzzled about it, though she was absolutely relieved to be free of him as he took a step back from her.Matthias expected her to flee by now, but she remained rooted to the spot, blinking at him in a dazed manner as she frowned in a deep thought. They stayed that way for some time, Matthias content in observing her through it all.While Leyla had been pondering about his strangeness tonight, she failed to notice when something cold and wet skewed her vision a little, making her blink in surprise. She raised her head, leaning her head back to look at the sky, Matthias following in suit.The first snowfall was finally here.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*By the time the second half of the event was done, the night had gotten darker, and the audience soon began to leave. Meanwhile the organisers were busying themselves in cleaning up the place and some last minute checks that everything was fine.Leyla was just finishing up, gathering the last of her belongings before deeming herself done for the day. Her feet wobbled as she walked past her colleagues, bidding them goodbye as she quickly walked through the halls.The heels she wore dug painfully on her soles, it was best she took them off once she boarded the bus or a stagecoach passing through Arvis. She quickly checked the time, noting it won\u2019t be long before the last of the transport would leave. She picked up her pace, eager to catch the last ride home.\u201cExcuse me, Miss Lewellin!\u201d called out someone from behind her. Surprised, she quickly turned around, towards the town hall, where she heard her name be called out. She recognized that voice.\u201cAh, Mr. Pat!\u201d she exclaimed as she saw just who called for her. Mr. Pat was a friend of her Uncle Bill, he was also known as the coachman of Arvis. He waved towards her with quick strides, before stopping right in front of her.\u201cI apologise for the late notice, but you\u2019ve been invited to ride with us.\u201d he told her, gesturing to the nearby coach. It was unmistakable, the carriage of Herhardt household was parked where he was pointing at.Leyla reflexively began to decline, shaking her head as she saw the emblem imprinted by the side of the carriage.\u201cOh please, there\u2019s no need for that-\u201d\u201cMadam Norma insists, Miss Leyla.\u201d Mr. Pat said kindly, halting Leyla in surprise.\u201cThe madam insists as you are returning home to Arvis as well, you can ride with both of the house Herhardt tonight.\u201d Mr. Pat finished as he once more gestured for Leyla to go along with them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Already, the roads were thickened of white frost, making it difficult for the carriage to move faster than it could. Leyla couldn\u2019t help but look out the window, worry clear on her face.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry too much, my dear.\u201d a kind gentle voice interrupted her. Leyla looked in front of her to see Madam Norma Catharina von Herhardt smiling for her, eyes wrinkled kindly as she regarded the young teacher sitting across from her.\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s not, um,\u201d Leyla began to stutter, but Norma graciously cut her off with a soft laugh.\u201cI know this might be a little uncomfortable for you, but please, there\u2019s no need to be so nervous.\u201d she comforted the young miss, \u201cI don\u2019t wish for you to be so tense in this ride. Especially since I extended the invite myself.\u201dLeyla found she could not begrudge the esteemed woman. She radiated so much warmth, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little bit at ease with her around. Norma sighed as she finally spared the outside a little glance.\u201cJust the first day of snow, and already the roads have grown thick with snow. I expect this winter to be colder, don\u2019t you think so\u00a0 as well, Matthias?\u201d Norma asked her grandson, turning to look at him for a response.Leyla, too, followed her gaze to spare the Duke some attention. They spared each other just a glance, but already she could feel her heart beating loudly against her chest.\u201cI think so as well, grandmother.\u201d he agreed readily. It was clear for Leyla that Norma was a tactful conversationalist. She took charge with the small talk, asking her about her school life, and even praising the latest charity event. Which of course led her to a conversation Leyla was hoping to avoid.Her class\u2019 play.\u201cYou seemed so flustered up there, but I want you to know you did marvellously.\u201d Norma said, eyes glinting in amusement as she recalled how much she enjoyed the play. Leyla felt her cheeks flush at the praise. Somehow, it sounded a lot more comforting than the other praises she received earlier.\u201cI thank you so much, madam!\u201d she thanked profusely. Her cheeks felt hotter, the tip of her ears turned red at the praise, giving her pale skin a vibrant colour akin to a ripened fruit.Matthias fought to hold back his laughter at her expression.\u00a0It was very reminiscent of her face when she had been up on the stage. She sat up straight in front of him, hands demurely clasped on her knees as she fidgeted restlessly with her fingers.She was not good at acting indifferently. She can\u2019t hold in her emotions very well. Not to mention how terrible she was at lying, which was probably why her acting ended up being so hilarious during the play.He leaned back against his seat, stretching his legs a little further, gently grazing the tip of his shoes against her heels discreetly so his grandmother wouldn\u2019t notice. Leyla felt him graze her foot, and moved her feet farther from him, but he wasn\u2019t giving up easily.The carriage rattled as it began to rock due to the unevenness of the well-polished road before. Leyla couldn\u2019t help but feel as though she was about to cry. She tried so hard not to let him touch her, but she could only move so far in a small carriage.And now his feet were firmly pressed against hers. The contact wasn\u2019t much, but it was enough to make her feel as though he\u2019d just stripped her naked.\u201cFor such a young lady, you seemed to handle the children well.\u201d Norma praised again, making Leyla raise her head back up to look at Herhardt\u2019s matriarch. As much as she\u2019d like to avoid the small contact Matthias was forcing on her, she didn\u2019t want the matriarch to be suspicious, and thus reluctantly ignored it.\u201cTell me, do you like children, Miss Lewellin?\u201d\u201cOf course madam.\u201d Leyla answered earnestly. She wouldn\u2019t have chosen to work as a teacher if she didn\u2019t like kids.\u201cWell then, I reckon you\u2019d be a great teacher in the long run,\u201d Norma smiled, as she leaned back, \u201cYou are both intelligent and love children, two qualities that\u2019s important to being a teacher. Don\u2019t you think so, Matthias?\u201d she turned to her grandson again, prompting him to join in on the conversation.\u201cI completely agree, grandmother.\u201d Matthias replied, quickly sparing Leyla a glance before giving his grandmother his full attention.Leyla on the other hand, couldn\u2019t help but feel so perplexed by him tonight. She knew it was a general answer, some polite courtesy on his part, but his behaviour by far was so polite compared to how he was before.If it were anyone else, he would have just nodded and given monosyllabic responses before leaving it at that. That was how she knew him, that\u2019s how she thought he would be. Just then Matthias\u2019 eyes slid back to her.\u201cThe semester break is coming soon, isn\u2019t it, Miss Lewellin?\u201d he asked her directly this time, making her jolt in surprise before hastily averting her gaze away from him.\u201cYes, it is, Duke.\u201d She tried not to act too flustered by him, mentally berating herself to keep her composure and just pretend as though she was just like any other family member of her Uncle Bill.\u201cHow are you planning on spending your vacation off school?\u201d\u201cUh, pardon that\u2019s, uh,\u201d she fumbled for words. Matthias had asked it so nonchalantly but Leyla could see the slight curve up his mouth. He was having fun with her.\u201cUh, I mean to perhaps help out Uncle Bill with his workload\u2026\u201d the foot pressed up against hers slid up slightly, almost making her gasp in the sudden movement but managed to continue anyway, \u201cA-and also prepare for the next semester!\u201d she finished, raising her voice slightly at the end of it due to embarrassment.Norma couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the strange behaviour Leyla had. She had been watching with apt attention, and noted as though she was trying to make a quiet declaration of what she wanted to do.It was a refreshing sight to see for the matriarch.\u201cThose are very good activities over the break Miss Lewellin,\u201d she told Leyla, \u201cBill Remmer raised you very well indeed.\u201d she smiled brightly, making Leyla flush in appreciation at the way Uncle Bill was commended.\u201cI\u2019m flattered you thought so, Madam.\u201d she replied softly, voice now dropped to a whisper as she now wanted to crawl into a hole. Matthias then shifted, crossing his legs as he looked at Leyla rather smugly, from beside his grandmother.\u201cYes, you would make a fine teacher one day yet, Miss Lewellin.\u201d Matthias added and Leyla looked back at him, \u201cAnd I can\u2019t wait to see more of you.\u201d he finished.Leyla can\u2019t help but want to trample his nearest foot with her heels, but resisted to do so. For now, she would have to give him the same respect she would with Madam Norma.\u201cI thank you for your words, Duke.\u201d she politely responded. Satisfied the conversation was over, she looked back outside, deciding to not look at the Duke any more tonight. Then again, it was a tedious task to do because of the small carriage.When their eyes met again, Leyla couldn\u2019t help but flinch away. His eyes were now dull and held no emotion, as though to compensate for the various expressions he\u2019d shown her before.Those eyes\u2026Those eyes reminded her of that summer day when the river engulfed her.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The journey back took twice as long, no thanks to the growing snow before they finally turned towards the road that led straight to Arvis.The rest of the journey had also taken a quiet turn not too long ago, when the Herhardt matriarch fell asleep along the way. The only sounds that could be heard was the stomping of the horses\u2019 hooves outside, along with some rattling the carriage made.Matthias had looked out the window long ago, before finally turning his gaze towards Leyla, wondering what she was doing to pass the time, when he saw her fast asleep as well. He noted that not too long ago she had been awake, trying to be vigilant within his presence. Though it seemed at some point she fell asleep anyway.His eyes now unashamedly trailed along her figure, his gaze stopping right by her shut eyes. Even in the dim light inside the carriage, he could see the way her necklace gleamed beautifully, reflecting the moonlight that managed to seep in.His eyes trailed further down, watching the way her lips parted, the slow and gentle rise of her breathing, down to her heeled feet. They looked so small compared to his own, now that they lay side by side with each other. Her feet almost reminded him of a doll\u2019s.He found himself amazed by how such small feet could carry such a majestic woman as though it was nothing.Suddenly, the carriage pulled into a stop, shaking Matthias away from his thoughts.\u201cBill! Why are you out here?\u201d Mr. Pat, the coachman exclaimed, when he saw his friend waiting around in the cold. At the sudden halt, Leyla jolted awake, looking around in a daze as she rubbed the sleep from her eye.\u201cI saw the weather beginning to look bad, so I got worried about Leyla.\u201d Bill replied to the coachman.\u201cLeyla\u2019s fine, she\u2019s right inside here with the Herhardts, thanks to Madam Norma. I\u2019m certain she was well taken care of.\u201d\u201cOh? She rode with you?\u201dThe muffled sounds of the conversation outside filtered towards the occupants of the carriage, that it was enough to awaken Norma Catharina von Herhardt. Seeing her awake, Leyla quickly fixed her appearance, before gently taking the madam\u2019s attention.\u201cUh, Madam Norma?\u201d she called out softly, with a soft smile. Norma need not hear the words, for she understood completely what Leyla wanted and nodded, smiling back at her.\u201cWell then, this is goodbye for now. Off you go, Leyla. Bill\u2019s waiting for you.\u201dLeyla bid them both adieu before taking leave, leaving both Herhardts in the carriage behind.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cShe\u2019s lucky to have been raised by Bill Remmer,\u201d Norma said as soon as the carriage began to move.\u201cI agree, grandmother.\u201d Matthias responded, having practised his responses for her with ease over the years, eyes staring outside, watching the way Leyla ran up to her uncle with a tight embrace.For now, he could only stare uselessly at her back as she continued to grow smaller the further they got. He didn\u2019t like this feeling in his chest; this feeling telling him he was leaving something important to him.\u201cHmm, I\u2019m surprised Bill has a soft side to him,\u201d it seemed like he wasn\u2019t the only one looking back, \u201cI can\u2019t even act like that around my own child. I doubt even God predicted such a side from him as well.\u201d Norma continued on as she stared wistfully at the old gardener and his foster child.Matthias remained silent, unsure of what answer to provide his grandmother to show he was listening.\u201cI hoped she\u2019d stay forever by Bill\u2019s side. But I didn\u2019t expect her to want to leave Arvis.\u201d his grandmother grumbled, making Matthias\u2019 thoughts halt at the new information he just heard.\u201cTransfer? Leyla Lewellin wishes to be transferred\u00a0away\u00a0from Arvis?\u201d he asked, a frown burrowing in his brows and his grandmother nodded in confirmation, oblivious to the troubling thoughts of her grandson.\u201cOh yes, I received word she requested to transfer to a different city, something about broadening her experience.\u201d Norma can\u2019t help but scoff, \u201cYoung women these days are never content to stay close. Don\u2019t they know home is the best place for them?\u201dShe tutted softly beside Matthias, before continuing with her tirade. Matthias only opted to remain silent, attentively listening by now.\u201cI only heard about the transfer a while ago, when the headmistress told me. She tried to dissuade the girl, but she was quite adamant to go.\u201d Norma shared, \u201cEven the headmistress was shocked she wanted to leave. All her students love her after all, including their parents!\u201dThe frown on Matthias\u2019 face grew deeper as he listened to the next part of his grandmother\u2019s news.\u201cThough maybe her leaving has something to do after she broke off her engagement with Kyle Etman, which is understandable to me; though that doesn\u2019t explain why she wants to move so far away from Bill.\u201d she sighed finally finished. Matthias jaw clenched as he slowly fisted his hands in quiet anger.\u201cI see.\u201d he finally said, eyes glaring at the snowfall outside.\u201cOf course the headmistress told Leyla she still has the rest of the year to complete, and should she change her mind not to hesitate in telling her so.\u201d she added as an afterthought, \u201cThough personally, I want her to stay.\u201d Norma sighed wistfully once more, looking somber at the thought of Leyla leaving Arvis.And then a sudden thought struck Norma.\u201cCome to think of it, doesn\u2019t the headmistress have a distant relative nearby who owns that big grocery store downton?\u201d Matthias wordlessly nods, \u201cYes, I remember she mentioned wishing for Leyla to meet and hit it off with him. Which would work perfectly!\u201d she cheered to herself.\u201cThink of it, she might not come from a good background, but with her pretty face and her brain, she\u2019d be a catch to anyone. After all, it\u2019s quite common for engagements to be broken off nowadays. Though I wonder if marrying someone would be enough to change her mind\u2026\u201d Norma wondered out loud. \u201cThe headmistress seems to want to match them up.\u201d\u201cI completely agree.\u201d Matthias took a deep breath, trying not to make his irritation noticeable.\u201cAh well, even if Bill disapproves of the merchant, I can always ask Hessen for a decent, young, unmarried man who lives nearby and present him to Bill.\u201d Norma said, content with her recent plan so far, \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s best for someone like her to marry young and have a family while she teaches. Not to mention still manage to live near Bill. Don\u2019t you agree, Matthias?\u201dJust in time, the carriage halted to a stop, signifying they\u2019ve arrived at their mansion. Wasting no time, Matthias immediately opened up the carriage door, and got off, trying to compose himself, before schooling his expression.He turned around, fixing his lapel underneath his coat and gave his hand to his grandmother, who gratefully took it. \u201cShall we, grandmother?\u201d he asked, as polite and graceful as ever.\u201cThank you, sweet boy.\u201d she smiled at him as he helped her down the carriage. With their conversation officially over for the night, the only sounds left were the click and clacking of their shoes against the polished floors as they walked inside the mansion\u2019s halls.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When Bill and Leyla pulled away from each other after they hugged, they held hands as they continued their walk back home after seeing the Duke\u2019s carriage had finally left the entrance of Arvis.Bill had immediately asked Leyla about the charity event, who after being sworn by Leyla not to laugh, eagerly listened. Leyla told him about the people, how the play went, before one of her students broke down crying that she had to stand in as their substitute. The rest of the evening then went downhill for Leyla as she was humiliated.Bill couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud at her story!\u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t laugh!\u201d whined Leyla, flushing red in embarrassment, which only served to make him laugh more. Leyla harrumphed defeatedly, before resigning herself to the fact at least one more person was laughing because of her.Bill\u2019s laughter soon died down as he wiped a tear from his eye, before patting Leyla on the back comfortingly.\u201cThere, there now Leyla, I have no doubt you looked absolutely adorable next to the children. No doubt at all.\u201d he grinned at his foster daughter. Leyla pouted before hugging him from the side, as they both huddled for the warmth each other brought.\u201cI doubt the rest of the audience thought so as well.\u201d she grumbled, resting her head on her uncle\u2019s shoulder as they continued to walk. Despite the growing ache in her feet, Leyla couldn\u2019t help but feel all is better in the world once again now that her uncle\u2019s here.They reached as far enough as the outskirts of the roe garden before Bill let out a cough and stopped to look at Leyla\u2019s feet. \u201cDo you want to ride on my back, Leyla? It would make you feel better to be off your feet.\u201d\u201cWhat?! There\u2019s absolutely no need for that!\u201d she chuckled, denying vehemently the offer, \u201cBesides, I\u2019m no longer a child, uncle. I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked her sceptically, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve noticed for a while now you\u2019ve been limping. The heels must be uncomfortable by now.\u201d he pointed out, making Leyla squirm. He sighed, knowing just how stubborn she was, but he was equally stubborn too.He crouched down in front of Leyla, waiting no further reply as he wordlessly encouraged her to get on his back.\u201cUncle\u2026\u201d Leyla murmured, touched by the caring gesture he\u2019s given her.\u201cWell, it\u2019s either a piggyback ride, or I carry you like a sack of potatoes, your choice.\u201d Bill further prompted when Leyla made no move. Leyla couldn\u2019t help but pout at the suggestion.\u201cBut you\u2019ll get tired.\u201d she protested, making Bill chuckle.\u201cJust how old do you think I am? I\u2019m not that old, girl.\u201d he reminded, \u201cI\u2019m only still a middle-aged man, I can carry loads twice as much as you with no problem.\u201d he boasted. Sighing deeply, Leyla gave in and climbed on his back.Bill hoisted them both up, Leyla grabbing him by the shoulders, as he supported her from under her knees and resumed their trek back to their house. Bill strode down the forest path with ease, and Leyla couldn\u2019t help but smile as she felt like a child once again.It didn\u2019t take long for her teeth to begin chattering, as short, white puffs of air began to escape her. Bill noticed this, and couldn\u2019t help but laugh at Leyla once more, who lightly thumped his back in indignation. Bill only laughed harder, and Leyla pressed her body to her uncle\u2019s back looking at the pair of footprints turning into one behind them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he seemed to be unwilling to part with her just yet.\u201cOh please it\u2019s no problem, it\u2019s just a little more distance.\u201d he insisted.\u201cOh no, there\u2019s no need,\u201d Leyla politely declined once more, \u201cMy uncle\u2019s very strict you see.\u201d she told him, discreetly looking around, hoping no one has seen them yet.It didn\u2019t matter what Leyla would say as soon as rumours of her being seen around with a man would spread like wildfire in Arvis. She hated having to throw her uncle\u2019s name under the bus, but it wasn\u2019t as though it was untrue.\u201cOh, I understand.\u201d he finally complied, looking a bit dejected, before smiling at her once again, \u201cWell, I guess I better go then. I had fun today, how about we do this again through lunch on Sunday?\u201d he asked hopefully, making Leyla smile apologetically at him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cOr if this week\u2019s not available, perhaps sometime next week? I don\u2019t mind.\u201d he quickly retracted, \u201cI\u2019m just hoping we could do this again.\u201d he finished, flushing slightly under her gaze, but sounded quite sincere for her.\u201cI feel terrible having to spend such a short time with you over tea.\u201d he reasoned out, \u201cI\u2019d love for us to have a proper chance to get to know each other more, that is, if you feel the same.\u201d he admitted, \u201cIf not well, I promise not to trouble you any longer.\u201dLeyla could see he was being very truthful to her, and that no matter what her answer would be, he would respect her wishes. But until then, he was not leaving without a proper answer from her.Leyla and the grocery store owner\u2019s son were not well acquainted with each other before this. As far as she knew, he was the one in charge of the school\u2019s delivery of their weekly supplies. She never expected to get to know him beyond that.So when she had been called to the headmistress\u2019 office just this afternoon, she was shocked to see him there with her. She soon found out he was the headmistress\u2019 distant relative, looking for a relationship leading to marriage.Leyla\u2019s mind blanked out at that information.Again, she couldn\u2019t help but give another once over around them. Immediately, she heard the familiar sound of a car rolling down the pavement, and turned towards its general vicinity. She felt panic beginning to seize her chest, as she hoped for a miracle she was mistaken, but she was never that lucky.Bright lights flashed them both on the pavement, the car having slowed down as it neared them before speeding up as it passed them by\u2026Leyla recognized that car anywhere. It was Duke Herhardt\u2019s vehicle.\u201cMiss Lewellin?\u201d His gentle voice shook Leyla out of her thoughts before she remembered she remained unresponsive with him for some time now, having been locked in her thoughts.\u201cI, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d she apologised, bowing before him, \u201cI\u2019m not ready yet for that kind of relationship.\u201d she admitted to him, looking apologetic.Though the headmistress might have set them up to have tea together, she found him to be amicable to be with. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s against marrying, she was sure she wants to someday. But just not right now, for now, it was enough for her to have a stable job and live a normal life.\u201cOh, well, I completely understand.\u201d he replied, sounding dejected. He stepped back, smiling back at her reassuringly he was not angry at all, and apologised for the trouble she went through.They parted ways, and Leyla watched as he left in a sullen manner. It made Leyla uncomfortable knowing she had to turn down such a kind man, but it was for the better. If she had accepted him sooner than she should, she would have hurt him in the end.Just as she did with Kyle.Leyla\u2019s gaze turned dark as the name entered her thoughts.There had been many times, since their separation, that she\u2019d wonder how he was. However in the end she found it enough for her to pray for his well being for now. She missed him dearly, but she couldn\u2019t go back to the times when it was so easy to be with him.She can\u2019t go back to the moments when she could still laugh, chat and walk freely with Kyle.The skies have turned dark, the street lamps now lit up. Anxiety bubbled up in her as soon as she shook her fond memories of him away out of mind. This anxiousness in her felt just like she did with the first autumn she had spent with the duke.She breathed in, and closed her eyes, imagining the distant spring time to come. She\u2019d be in a new place by then, planning to start a new chapter in her life. She hoped when she moved she could find a lodging room with a huge window, allowing the sun to seep in and fill her space.It would also be ideal if there were some trees nearby, or a park she could see through. That way she only needs to open the window to breathe in the fresh smell of cut grass or the wet forest floor after a rain. That\u2019s what she would miss most in Arvis after all.She soon found herself calming down the more she thought about her successful move away from Arvis. Composed and confident everything would be fine, she gripped the handle of her bicycle tightly, and began to move, turning carefully around the corner.Her eyes were only set in front of her, on the empty asphalt road, framed by the trees on either side, moonlight guiding her way home. She breathed in deeply, relaxed in her assumed solitude, pedalling briskly as she continued in her way.She was completely oblivious to the Duke Herhardt that had been nearby, waiting for her quietly by the shadowed side of the pavement.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Kyle was overcome by a familiar trepidation whenever he approached his mailbox. It\u2019s become a habit now, whenever he\u2019d retrieve his mails, for him to search for a particular letter. He always arrived with that faint hope that this time, he\u2019d get a reply.However, when he sifted through his mail, none of them were from Leyla. His smile fell, as he turned sullen. Week after week he\u2019d write to her, hoping for word of how she was, a response to his letters to her. But she\u2019d never written back, not once.With a dejected sigh, he closed his mailbox once more, and went back up to his dormitories. His room was located on the east wing, third floor. With vacation just right around the corner, students were busying themselves in packing for home. But Kyle was yet to be struck with the need to do the same.His room was just as usual. He opened up his dorm room, greeted by nothing but the darkened room, and tossed his meagre pile of letters by the console table, right beside the doorway. There were only a couple of them today, an invitation to an upcoming social gathering, and one from home.He plopped himself on his bed, not having the energy to read through their contents. He watched the moonlight filter through his window, slipping through the gaps between his curtains as it shone on his sulking form.\u2018Why don\u2019t you go on a trip during your first break?\u2019Those were his father\u2019s words just a few days ago when he phoned home. While it was true that nowadays, most of the wealthier students tend to go off on trips across the continent during breaks, he was certain his father had some other reason in mind.He glossed over a proper response to his suggestion, telling him he\u2019d think about it. No matter what he\u2019d decide on, he knew it was pointless to go back and seek Leyla out by now. So what point was there for him to travel?\u2018Should I just lay here then, all miserable without her?\u2019\u00a0he pondered, shifting to lie on his back instead of his stomach.\u00a0\u2018To stay until I become insane from staring at concrete while drowning myself in studies?\u2019\u2018There\u2019s no place in this world where only the two of us can be happy.\u2019He tossed his arm over his eyes, chuckling dryly to himself as he recalled Leyla\u2019s words to him. He couldn\u2019t even answer her, couldn\u2019t find his voice to speak back at that time. And now, all that\u2019s left of him is a deep sense of self-loathing.He hated how weak he had been, how he was nothing if not for his parents. But most of all, he hated how he couldn\u2019t even protect the woman he loved most in the world.\u2018Leyla, I wanted to be a doctor so that I could find a place where we could both be happy.\u2019\u00a0he thought wistfully, feeling the pinprick of tears in his eyes,\u00a0\u2018But that\u2019s still in the distant future, could I survive that long to be parted from you?\u2019He pressed his palms over his eyes before sighing. He pulled his hands away as he opened his eyes, before trying to catch the light of the moon in his hands.\u2018Even a few months away from you is torture.\u2019Kyle was almost of age by now, which meant he could finally claim the inheritance his grandfather left him. He regretted having not thought about it sooner.He sat up on his bed, and ran his fingers through his dishevelled hair, staring at nothing but the blank walls of his dorm. Making up his mind, he immediately got up, flipped the light by his desk on, and grabbed some pen and paper.He was nervous when he wrote it down, but this was an urgent matter he needed to do.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cWhy, all of a sudden, is everyone trying to find you a groom?\u201d Bill suddenly piped up as he watched Leyla set the table for dinner. When he\u2019d asked her about her day, he hadn\u2019t expected her to have been out with the grocery store owner\u2019s son, a meeting set up by the headmistress.Leyla looked up at him, frowning as she tilted her head in confusion.\u201c\u201cWhat do you mean by\u00a0everyone?\u201d she asked curiously. Bill scratched the back of his head as he recalled earlier events.\u201cYou know, Mrs. Mona, the chatty chef?\u201d Leyla nodded to indicate she knew who he was talking about, \u201cWell she approached me a while ago, telling me she overheard Madam Norma asking Hessen around for a suitable groom for you.\u201d he informed her. Leyla couldn\u2019t help but grow more confused, and more curious.\u201cWhy would Madam Norma do that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bill shrugged, \u201cPerhaps she took a liking to you.\u201d he added offhandedly as he placed their food on the dinner table. Leyla couldn\u2019t help but scoff.\u201cNo way.\u201d she added preposterously, smiling as she sat across Bill from the table as he fetched the bread out of the stove.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see any other reason why she\u2019d find you a groom.\u201d Bill pointed out and sat down on his seat, \u201cSo why do you think she would?\u201d he asked her this time, looking at her inquiringly.\u201cUncle, you\u2019re not getting tired of being around me, are you?\u201d Leyla teased, making Bill puff out a scoff and waved the accusations away.\u201cWhat kind of nonsense is that?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s not the case, then you won\u2019t mind if I\u2019m going to live with you forever?\u201d she further said, grinning as they gathered food into their plates and began to dig in.The conversation died down a little, the only sound coming was the scraping of their utensils against the plates as they ate. Bill leaned back in his chair, deep in thought as he chewed carefully, eyeing Leyla, before swallowing the food.\u201cSo, if ever Madam Norma introduces you to a strapping young man,\u201d Bill began, breaking the silence between them, \u201cYou\u2019d refuse him?\u201dLeyla only smiled sadly at him, seeing the concern reflected through her uncle\u2019s eyes for her.\u201cWell, I\u2019d certainly love to meet someone who\u2019s just like you Uncle,\u201d she admitted, \u201cUnfortunately, I think no one is like you.\u201d she smiled, hoping to reassure him, but Bill could only ache for her.Once more he couldn\u2019t help but feel like it was Kyle why she was like this. He was certain she was so hurt by their failed engagement, she found herself no longer wanting marriage, hence continuously turning down marriage offers.Though that\u2019s not stopping Kyle from wanting to reconnect with her. As much as it pained him to lie to her, Bill had to take Kyle\u2019s letters away from her pile every time he saw one from the man. He knew that they had a good relationship in the past, but for him it was beyond a point of repair.\u201cShould, uh, Leyla\u2026\u201d he trailed off, making Leyla hum as she listened to what he had to say\u2026\u2018If Leyla still has feelings for Kyle, would it help if Kyle cuts ties with the Etman household?\u2019\u00a0Bill couldn\u2019t help but wonder,\u00a0\u2018It might be a rough start, but I\u2019d help them settle down, even if they move to the capital city.\u2019Should that happen, Bill has resolved himself to move with them. It might be difficult for him to get a job as a gardener from Arvis there, but he\u2019s willing to quit for Leyla. And should the time come to pass, and Leyla gives birth to their child, then perhaps that wicked Mrs. Etman would come around to accepting their relationship.\u201cUncle?\u201d Leyla called out, having heard nothing from him for sometime now.\u201cHm?\u201d He looked up at her in confusion.\u201cYou were saying?\u201d she prompted gently, making him remember they were still in the middle of a conversation.\u201cAh right, um, chicken!\u201d he declared, \u201cYes, yes, chickens.\u201d he murmured, tapping his fingers thoughtfully against the tabletop. Leyla\u2019s face twisted into confusion.\u201cChickens?\u201d\u201cYes! Should we catch chickens tomorrow?\u201d Bill asked rather jovially, before seeing the concern in her eyes, \u201cIt slipped my mind for a while there, must be my age getting to me. I\u2019m fine Leyla.\u201d he excused rather sheepishly, smiling brightly at her.Next time, he\u2019d think twice before opening his mouth to speak. He was fortunate that Leyla hadn\u2019t doubted him yet, so she only smiled and nodded brightly back at him.\u201cSure uncle, let\u2019s have some chickens tomorrow.\u201d She readily agreed and they both began finishing their meals.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Slender fingers grabbed the knob for the phonograph\u2019s volume, turning it up. The figure turned around, heading towards his wing chair, the firelight illuminating his face, revealing Matthias.He sat quietly in his darkened room, staring into the fire, the only light source he had right now. Suddenly, there was a fluttering of wings, as the cage rattled, and a bird landed by his perched fingers.He regarded it slowly, gently turning his fingers, whistling the same tune of the music that was playing. It didn\u2019t take long for his bird to follow in suit, chirping along with the tunes. Matthias couldn\u2019t help the smug grin on his lips.His bird was clever. Despite having never trained it, it followed him wordlessly, chirping along naturally to the music. It was thanks to his beautiful canary he enjoyed listening to the music as it followed along.The music he mostly played was waltz, though sometimes he liked to mix it up with either the orchestra symphonies, or ballet bagatelles. As far as he could tell, his canary would sing beautifully whenever it was a waltz it was copying.Finally the music stopped, soft melodies fading out as the piece ended, leaving only the crackling of firewood to fill the quiet room. Matthias lightly caressed his bird with the pads of his fingers, wordlessly praising its natural talent.Familiar with its master\u2019s touch, the canary nuzzled towards his fingers, lightly tapping its beak as though it was trying to kiss his hand. Matthias smirked, slowly getting up as he approached his bird\u2019s cage.He lowered his hand, hovering right in front of the cage\u2019s entrance, before it fluttered back in to settle inside it\u2019s plush and cosy nest. Matthias quietly locked the golden cage close, before turning towards the phonograph to cut the beginnings of the next song off.He breathed in deeply, before letting out an exhausted sigh as he languidly rested on top of his bed, looking up at the ceiling. He then turned his head, to look at his bird with a smile, in his mind, imagining a different one instead\u2026\u201cGood night.\u201d he said to it, seeing his canary settle down into sweet slumber. As soon as the bird was asleep, the smile faded on Matthias\u2019 lips as he kept staring at the bird.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He sifted through the letters before spotting another one from Kyle. The only difference was, this one\u2019s thicker than the previous ones that came.\u201cWhat are you going to do about that, Mr. Remmer?\u201d the mailman asked, his voice dropped in a whisper. Through the past fall and winter seasons, he had been an accomplice of Bill from keeping Kyle\u2019s letters to reaching her. Making him just as guilty as Bill.\u201cYou can\u2019t keep hiding them forever.\u201d the mailman couldn\u2019t help but point out. Bill sighed, placing the letter between his pile of mail, nodding to the mailman.\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that.\u201d he looked out to the road, breathing deeply as he stared at the direction towards Leyla\u2019s school, \u201cI\u2019ll tell her soon.\u201d he admitted, the mailman appeared relieved with the news.\u201cYes, it should come from you. I promise I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u201cMuch appreciated,\u201d Bill thanked, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for dragging you into this.\u201d\u201cHey, it\u2019s alright, I know you\u2019re only looking out for Leyla.\u201d the mailman assured him, \u201cThough it must be troubling you greatly.\u201d he smiled sadly at the gardener, as though he understood how he felt.He loved to think he knew Bill better than anyone in Arvis. After all, he was the one responsible for bringing Leyla Lewellin to Arvis as a child. He watched Bill change with Leyla in his life. It was that love for the child that made Bill happier than he was before.They bid each other goodbye, leaving Bill as he returned back to their cabin. Leyla had gone to work earlier, which made him alone right now.Bill tossed the letter onto the table, looking at it strongly, before impulsively pulling out all of Kyle\u2019s letters, tied into a bundle. There were so many he prevented from reaching Leyla, he suspected she\u2019d be rather angry and distrustful of him once the truth came out\u2026But it didn\u2019t matter how scared he was of how she\u2019d respond. What mattered was he couldn\u2019t keep doing this to her. The guilt of lying and keeping such a huge thing as this was getting too much for him.And so he sat down, untied the current bundle, arranging them properly by date, before adding in the latest one. He wrapped the string back around to keep them secure, before placing them down to the edge of the table.There. Maybe if he\u2019d see it as he returned, he would be reminded of the guilt, and be unable to talk himself out of coming clean to Leyla.He had thought about it before, trying to ease his guilt by saying what he was doing was best for Leyla, but really, the only choice that mattered in that department was Leyla. She was the only one who could choose what was best for her, and whatever her choice, he\u2019d support her fully.With his mind made up, Bill got up from his seat and exited his cabin, locking it as he left. He neared the chicken coop, scoping out his target. Once he chose which among them would be their dinner tonight, he went towards the greenhouse, owned by the Duke. As soon as he entered, a familiar voice greeted him.\u201cGood day Bill!\u201d the zookeeper called out to him as he crouched down on a nearby flower bed to get started with his work.They\u2019d been colleagues for a long time now. Bill liked to think they were friends by now. He waved back, giving the flowers a once over, before getting up and headed to the warehouse to chop up some firewood.The zookeeper approached him not soon after he did so.\u201cBy the way Bill, the butler made a request not to stack the firewood right next to the generators.\u201d he informed him, making Bill frown at the new instructions. Bill grumbled about how the new machines were dictating his job.The generators were a new instalment, which supposedly provided the mansion with this thing called an\u00a0electricity, which they apparently produced. Bill had no idea what the fuss was all about, all he knew is it was a massive headache to learn.\u201cThank you for telling me.\u201d Bill replied, sighing as he looked around, \u201cI think I can manage this one on my own, no need to worry.\u201d he assured, letting the zookeeper leave to do their own job.He walked back towards the warehouse, and pulled the doors open, before being greeted with loud whirring sounds. He winced as he strode in, the sound making the ground vibrate whenever he neared the operating machine.He cursed under his breath, complaining about how loud it was every time he had to be in the warehouse. He shot the machine a glare as he passed by. Things were so much easier before, and a lot less hassle than these infernal devices!His distaste for modern technology was something he shared with the Herhardt matriarch, Madam Norma.He mourned the days where he once worked silently in the warehouse, without the fuss of technology. He looked up, and was surprised to see Madam Norma, who was probably taking a stroll around the greenhouse. He greeted her respectfully as she asked him how work was.\u201cNothing much, madam,\u201d he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s just this thing is making more of a fuss today.\u201d he observed, and began stacking some firewood right next to them.Perhaps making a physical barrier between him and the generator would make it quieter. It would certainly help his sanity. He shook his head and brought more of the firewood he collected inside to pile right next to the machine.\u201cThings were much easier back in the day.\u201d Madam Norma hummed thoughtfully as she watched Bill work. Of that statement, he couldn\u2019t agree more.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*There was a loud cacophony in Leyla\u2019s class, as the children portrayed mixed reactions. Some had broken off into their respective groups, others opted to stay in their seats. There was a mixture of children laughing, while there were those who were despairing.Among the latter, was little Monica.Leyla had just informed the students of her decision to transfer away from school, and thus was saying goodbye to them. She was most concerned for Monica, who might have taken the news too hard. Still, it was better to prepare them for their parting ways this early despite the remaining few months she still had with them.After making sure each of her students were alright, and understood she was only moving away and not abandoning them, she deemed her job finished and dismissed them. School was done for the day, so all she had to do was go back to her desk by the classroom to gather up her things.She still has dinner to prepare for after all. Perhaps she could cook them some roasted chicken tonight.As she was getting ready to leave school, and back to their cabin, she found herself busy with whether she should buy Uncle Bill either some new socks, a sweater, or a nice bottle of wine to share. She pedalled absentmindedly, wondering how he\u2019ll take the news of her moving to another city by the next semester.\u2018He\u2019ll be heartbroken for sure,\u2019\u00a0she thought to herself,\u00a0\u2018Perhaps a nice drink will be a better consolation gift after all.\u2019\u00a0She slipped out of her school slippers, before putting back on her shoes, tucking the slippers into the lockers properly, before smiling to herself in satisfaction.\u201cYou really think that\u2019s going to stop me?\u201dMatthias\u2019 words to her during that night at the charity event echoed through her mind as she put on her shoes. The more she recalled his words, the more she found it incredulous he would say such a thing. He wasn\u2019t the type of man to be throwing around such empty threats. Leyla always thought he would remain the ever serious duke, even to his grave.\u2018Is it because of winter that he\u2019s like this?\u2019\u00a0she couldn\u2019t help but wonder,\u00a0\u2018Is the cold getting to him after all?\u2019She hadn\u2019t had much interaction with him at all since the season started. At first she had been so anxious by his absence, but eventually grew relieved with her newfound peace. She really hoped it would stay that way\u2026That one day, his interest in her would fade into nothing, and she could go back to the way her life was before she even met him.She grabbed her coat by the entrance of the school, tucking it around herself and closing all it\u2019s buttons. She pushed the doors open with her free hand, carrying a box of her belongings with the other as she went to where her bike was. She secured her things first on her bike\u2019s basket, before finally pedalling back home.She went through her usual route, passing by downtown to buy some additional groceries. Once she was done, she tied it to the back of her bike instead as her basket was already full of her belongings.\u201cGive my regards to Mr. Remmer!\u201d the owner called out just as she was about to leave, to which she only nodded back with a smile.\u201cI will! Thank you!\u201d She replied.\u201cOh, and be careful on your way back! Bill might cry if the wine breaks once you get home.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d Leyla laughed, \u201cGood bye!\u201d She bid him goodbye and went on her way.Despite the cold air, the sun provided her with enough warmth for the clear day still left. She sped up as the skies turned orange, giving the afternoon a golden glow as the sun began to set. It has been a good day so far. Nothing was amiss.At least, nothing until she entered the streets leading to Arvis.\u201cLeyla! Leyla!\u201d a shrill voice called out to her, making Leyla halt in alarm, just in time for a fire brigade to pass her by, and straight towards the Duke\u2019s mansion. \u201cLeyla!\u201dShe looked around, before seeing a frantic Mrs. Mona, who was practically in tears, held onto her hands as though she was holding on to dear life! Leyla grew alarmed.\u201cM-Mrs. Mona, what is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d she quickly inquired, \u201cWhy did I just see the fire brigade?!\u201d she frantically looked around, before spotting the smoke trail\u2026Leyla couldn\u2019t help but feel her heart constrict on her chest when she realised the smoke was coming directly from the Duke\u2019s greenhouse.\u201cNo! It can\u2019t be!\u201d Leyla exclaimed, turning back to ask Mrs. Mona, \u201cThe greenhouse is on fire?!\u201d\u201cOh it wasn\u2019t just a fire Leyla!\u201d Mrs. Mona wailed, tears streaming down her face, \u201cI heard the electric generator practically exploded, taking half of the greenhouse with it in the process!\u201d Leyla gasped in alarm, \u201cBut the worst part of it, they say it\u2019s Bill Remmer who was to blame!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d she asked incredulously, \u201cWhy uncle?! What happened?\u201dAnd so Mrs. Mona talked.She told her how she couldn\u2019t understand fully what they had been saying, but from what she could piece together was that Bill had done something to the generators which was why it exploded. But the worst part of it all was not the explosion itself\u2026It was the fact that Madam Norma had been there during the explosion.\u201cShe\u2019s only gotten injured thankfully, but practically the whole mansion is in a disarray!\u201d Mrs. Mona paused, catching her breath, \u201cRight now the police had been combing through the vicinity looking for-\u201d\u201cUncle!\u201d Leyla called out, cutting off Mrs. Mona as she saw her uncle being escorted by policemen. She quickly ran towards him. Bill looked up at the sound of her voice, surprised to see her. \u201cUncle are you alright?!\u201d she quickly asked but was halted by the other police from going near him.She took in his appearance. He was covered in soot, parts of his clothes were singed, and he had some cuts and bruises all over him. Leyla felt her heart breaking.\u201cUncle what\u2019s happening?! Why are they saying it\u2019s your fault!?\u201d She called out to him as the police held her back as they dragged him away from her, \u201cUncle, it\u2019s not true right?! It can\u2019t be! It\u2019s just a misunderstanding!\u201dBill tried to smile comfortingly at her, but it was difficult to look back when the police were adamant he had to go.\u201cI\u2019ll be alright Leyla, I\u2019m sure this will all be over soon.\u201d he told her comfortingly, but it wasn\u2019t enough to ease the cold chill in Leyla\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019ll be back shortly. Okay Leyla, I\u2019ll be back-\u201d\u201cStart moving.\u201d the police grunted as they pushed Bill to keep moving, Leyla tried to get away from the police holding her back, but she was pushed away, and right into Mrs. Mona\u2019s embrace who quickly held back Leyla in a comforting hug.\u201cUncle!\u201d she called out, tears now streaming down her cheeks as she watched the police load Bill harshly into their car, slamming the door on his face, cutting off whatever it was he wanted to tell her. He only looked back at her silently, smiling comfortingly all this time.Leyla crumpled to the ground when the police left with their cars, and Uncle Bill with them before disappearing from the streets of Arvis.People rushed about to Leyla\u2019s side, trying to help her stand, when she stumbled and collapsed in their arms. Leyla\u2019s resounding cry echoes throughout Arvis\u2019 winter night, before being drowned by the surrounding sounds of worry by the servants.But right before she passed out, she could have sworn the duke was there, standing right on the mansion\u2019s front porch, atop the staircase.And then her world turned black.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla arrived in Arvis with a sunken face as she stared blankly at the road in front of her. When she regained consciousness, she immediately went to the police station and demanded to know what happened to her uncle, and what she could do.Unfortunately, there was nothing, the police informed her.The explosion had happened because of the many firewood that had been stacked beside it, which ultimately collapsed about half of the greenhouse. The glass around it cracked and shot out to everyone nearby, including Madam Norma, who was admiring the flowerbeds by the greenhouse at that moment.It was fortunate enough that the maid with her shielded her from the explosion, but the Herhardt matriarch still sustained broken bones from the impact of the explosion when the debris struck her. Add to the fact that the greenhouse, which was hailed as the most beautiful one around and home to various rare plants, was irrevocably irreparable.The police knew it was all an accident, but even if her uncle Bill hadn\u2019t intended to do so, the accident took place, and someone must be held responsible. Especially a prominent figure in the community as Madam Norma had been injured in the accident.The police did take pity on her, allowing her to speak with Bill on her visit, but it only led to more despairing words before she had to say goodbye.\u201cPerhaps if the Duke were to lessen the charges against him, he could get out sooner,\u201d the police told her just as she was about to leave, \u201cHowever, as of now, there\u2019s nothing else for him to do but to serve time for his current charges.\u201dThey helped Leyla up, who had been begging on her knees for anything she could do for them to release him. She had failed in getting her uncle out. None of the police in the station were able to look her in the eyes after that. That\u2019s when she knew there was really no other way they could show her.\u2018Should his sentence be final, would uncle really go to jail?!\u2019\u00a0she thought in despair as she walked the lonely road in Arvis.She\u2019s not certain what exactly the procedure was for such incidents, but she knew it would need a lot of time and money for a lawsuit to be filed. She can\u2019t even pay the bail for her uncle right now.She was unsure as to how she managed to reach Arvis, but she knew the only way she could help Uncle Bill was to beg mercy from the Herhardt household. All she could do was cry in the dark, her body moving in autopilot for her. But how could she do that?Madam Norma had gotten hurt during that explosion, not to mention their precious greenhouse was in shambles. Should she present herself in front of Madam Elysee, all crying and begging, she might make the problem worse for her uncle\u2026And then she caught sight of the mansion, the only source of light in the dark neighbourhood. And then a thought struck her!\u2018Duke Herhardt! If it\u2019s him, then surely\u2026\u2019\u00a0her thoughts trailed off as she began to pick up her pace despite her staggering steps.The Duke was ultimately the owner of the household. Sure he made her uncomfortable, terrified and bullied her relentlessly, made her confused with his actions over the past autumn season, but perhaps he would help her.She clasped her hands together in prayer as she passed by the still rose garden, and through the forest path. The river streamed restlessly once she passed through the riverbank, her breath quickening as she drew closer to the mansion.She could see the annex up ahead despite her white puffs of breath. The lights were still on!And so Leyla broke out into a run, heading towards her light at the end of the tunnel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNorma watched as Elysee von Herhardt, Matthias\u2019 mother, kept walking back and forth all over her room. She fluffed up her pillows, tucked her in securely in bed, before checking over some last minute details to ensure she was comfortable.\u201cI can\u2019t help but feel sorry for Bill.\u201d Norma piped up, making Elysee turn around in shock at the matriarch\u2019s words.\u201cSorry?\u201d she asked incredulously, before sitting down at the edge of Norma\u2019s bed, \u201cHow could you say your sorry for him? You\u2019re the one injured by his negligence and destroyed the greenhouse!\u201d she exclaimed in an outrage.Normally Elysee wouldn\u2019t dare raise her tone at Norma, she respected the Herhardt matriarch too much. However, in this case she couldn\u2019t help herself.\u201cI didn\u2019t get hurt that badly.\u201d Norma softly explained, making Elysee scoff in disbelief at her words.\u201cI can\u2019t believe how forgiving you are of this!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cYou have broken bones! You almost died! The only reason it wasn\u2019t worse than that was because the maid took most of the brunt of the explosion.\u201d she pointed out.She got up and began to fix the medicine by Norma\u2019s vanity, posture tense and angry as she tried to calm her tone as she reasoned with Norma.\u201cAlso, Hessen had already given them warnings about not stacking firewood too close to the generators, and yet he deliberately did the opposite!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not some rookie employee Elysee, we\u2019ve known him for years.\u201d Norma added, \u201cYou and I both know this was all an accident.\u201d\u201cWell, that accident of his cost me my birds, and around half of your rare plants! We were fortunate that no person was involved in the casualties, but you could have been one too. Even the year end party at Arvis is ruined now because the generator is gone.\u201d Elysee ended her argument.The rest of the banquet hall and dining room were now stuck with old fashioned lamps just to light them up. The mansion\u2019s electricity was practically non-existent at this point because most of the lamps had been replaced to use the electricity, and now they were completely useless.\u201cI did tell you we didn\u2019t need that crude electricity.\u201d Norma huffed out. It was no secret from the start that the elder matriarch had been against changing the ways of the house. She was practically happy having lost the generators.There was no need for useless things. Things worked perfectly fine as they were before.\u201cAnd I understand how you feel, Elysee,\u201d Norma continued, \u201cBut what good will punishing a gardener for things we can\u2019t undo? It won\u2019t bring back this electricity, nor rebuild the greenhouse. Better let him go now, especially since I\u2019m certain he can\u2019t afford to pay us back.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about the money!\u201d Elysee pointed out exasperatedly, \u201cIt\u2019s about responsibility, and making the rest of our servants vigilant in following orders.\u201dThere was a tense silence between the two of them now. Elysee was trying to even her breathing while Norma remained contemplative.\u201cSo you\u2019re going to send Bill Remmer to jail then?\u201d Norma finally asked, and Elysee let out a deep breath, shrugging.\u201cIf the court deems him guilty, then he will be.\u201d Elysee replied diplomatically.\u201cElysee,\u201d Norma softly called out, \u201cBill has been with us for years, been there since before Matthias was born. He\u2019s a friend by now. Also think about Leyla. What would happen to her now he\u2019s gone.\u201d she pleaded, Elysee could only shake her head in disbelief.\u201cLeyla\u2019s an adult now, she could very well take care of herself.\u201d she stated, \u201cBesides, we all know she couldn\u2019t stay forever in Arvis as a guest.\u201d It seemed as though Elysee\u2019s mind was already made up, and nothing would change it.\u201cAlso, I can\u2019t help but think about how Claudine feels right now about the explosion,\u201d Elysee continued, \u201cYou know she loved the greenhouse, she even wanted to hold the wedding there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201d Norma trailed off. She couldn\u2019t help but wince at the mention of her grandson\u2019s fiance. She knew by now Elysee had given instructions for the diligent repair of the greenhouse, but it would be impossible to finish it before the wedding.Claudine did love the once majestic greenhouse of Arvis.\u201cSo you see, he inconvenienced not only himself, but also plenty more people.\u201d Elysee continued, \u201cAnd that is why we simply cannot let him be after the accident.\u201d she sternly finished.\u201cI understand,\u201d Norma finally conceded, \u201cBut it still doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201dWith a deep sigh, Norma shifted in her seated position to lie down on her bed properly. Elysee immediately nodded to the maids at the side to assist her. They rushed and aided her carefully as she lay down, rearranging her pillows to be more comfortable for her before going back to their previous post.\u201cEither way, the final decision lies with Matthias.\u201d Norma finally said, looking at Elysee in the eyes with a meaningful stare. Elysee\u2019s jaw clenched as she knew what Norma was silently telling her.Matthias was the current head of the Herhardt household after all. Ultimately, he held the fate of Bill Remmer.\u201cYes, I agree.\u201d Elysee replied back, nodding in agreement, \u201cWhatever he says will be final, I won\u2019t disagree. I just hope he makes a wise decision.\u201d and with that she bid Norma good night, and left the older matriarch to rest.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla had just managed to arrive inside the annex and immediately headed towards the reception hall. Minutes later, Mark Evers went to Matthias, who was still in a phone call. Matthias turned to him, after excusing himself for a while, before he was informed of Leyla\u2019s arrival.After checking Leyla was indeed there to see him, he nodded to the attendant, signaling him to leave before continuing the phone call. Mark gestured for her to come closer, to which Leyla did, and remained standing across Matthias, in front of his desk. And with that, Mark left them alone.Leyla fidgeted as she caught snippets of Matthias\u2019 conversation on the phone, growing more anxious by the second. Matthias was calling about the impending repairs that needed to be done in the greenhouse, as well as the generators, both of which got destroyed in the recent explosion.When the phone call was done, Matthias put it down, before turning to look at Leyla, his hands clasped in front of him as he rested his chin on his fingers. Leyla squirmed beneath his gaze\u2026\u201cI see you got busy.\u201d she softly started, licking her lips nervously.\u201cNo thanks to Mr. Remmer.\u201d Matthias replied, devoid of any emotion, making Leyla nervous.\u00a0Was he angry? Was he pitiful of her uncle?\u00a0\u201cSit.\u201d he commanded, gesturing to the sofa across from him. Leyla hastily shook her head in denial.Not in the mood to push her, Matthias only leaned back in his seat, and crossed his legs together. Immediately, Leyla went beside him, and took a deep bow.\u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry for the accident today, Duke.\u201d she apologized, Matthias only stared at her, unsure why she was apologizing for the accident.\u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d he asked her.\u201cI\u2019m apologizing on behalf of Uncle Bill.\u201d she immediately replied, bowing lower as she could, \u201cPlease forgive him, just this once.\u201d she pleaded, desperately hoping he would accept her apology.\u201cYou know my uncle, Duke, what kind of a person he is.\u201d she proceeded when Matthias remained silent, \u201cThis was all just an accident! He\u2019s still so confused about electricity and generators, he misjudged it completely!\u201d she knelt down this time. She proceeded to give him excuses, about how his head always aches whenever he went in the warehouse due to the loud noises it produced, which was probably why he tried to shut it down.\u201cHe would never wish to harm Madam Norma, or destroy the greenhouse or anyone in it. You know that.\u201d she finished.Leyla stuttered through her explanation, but that was only because she tried her best not to act hysterical in front of him. All that time Matthias let her talk, not interjecting even once.\u201cPlease forgive him, please.\u201d she begged. She was as white as a sheet of paper, her hands shaking as she waited for the verdict, refusing to look up at him as she kowtowed beside him.\u201cLeyla.\u201d the Duke called out for her softly in a low and gentle voice. Leyla\u2019s head shot up immediately, looking up at him with red-rimmed eyes. \u201cHow would you suggest I show him forgiveness then? Just let him go?\u201d Matthias asked rhetorically, and Leyla frantically nodded, swallowing back her tears. Matthias took a deep breath\u2026\u201cForgiveness, huh?\u201d he murmured to himself, calmly observing her quivering form. Leyla immediately stood up, and stepped back at a respectable distance. Matthias\u2019 gaze went to her shoes, all covered in dust and dirt, probably from all the running she did to the police station and back.His gaze trailed up, glancing at her stocking clad calves, emphasizing it\u2019s slenderness. He tilted his head, leisurely moving his eyes up her form, seeing her clutch at her dark gray skirt, ending just above her knees. His eyes went further up, watching her checkered coat envelop her, with a red sweater hiding beneath.The two top buttons of her shirt were open, revealing her slender neck, before he met her teary eyes once more. She looked so desperate.He had been certain he\u2019d given her loads of pretty clothes, yet she always manages to dress like a nun.\u201cWhy should I?\u201d He finally asked her, his brows furrowing as Leyla found herself at a loss for words, \u201cWhy should I forgive Bill? Show him mercy?\u201dMatthias then stood up from his seat and brushed up against her casually, heading straight for the fireplace, stopping right in front of it. He stared into its flames, a frown marring his features.\u201cPl-please Duke-\u201d Leyla stammered, but was immediately cut off.\u201cThe generator exploded because of a warning he ignored,\u201d Matthias began, \u201cResulting in my grandmother almost dying, and the destruction of expensive property.\u201d He listed off all of the cases against Bill Remmer, making Leyla face the harsh truth.With every item, he took one step closer to her, looking all the more imposing. He only stopped when he was only a step away from her quivering form\u2026\u201cAnd you want me to just show him mercy?\u201d he finished, looking down at her, \u201cTell me why I would do that?\u201d\u201cPlease Duke-\u201d\u201cSo you wish for me to just dismiss all his wrongdoings then? To just let him go?\u201d he asked her, eyes shifting to caress Leyla on her collar with the tip of his fingers.She looked rather cute with the way the shirt hung loosely on her shoulders, though it did look rather familiar to him. It wasn\u2019t long until he realized it was the same shirt she wore during that picnic in autumn. The exact blouse he\u2019d taken off when she had the accident as well.He couldn\u2019t help but wonder if perhaps this was also the same shirt she wore when she asked to be transferred away from Arvis and work at a different school?His grip on her collar tightened, as he stared at her coldly.\u201cWho do you think you are to ask for such a thing?\u201d he practically snarled at her. Leyla felt as though he slapped her in the face with his response. His hands moved up, and grasped her chin tightly. \u201cHuh, tell me Leyla.\u201d he demanded.Tears welled up in Leyla\u2019s eyes as he forced her to keep eye contact. Tears flowed down her cheeks in streams, drowning the fingers around her chin. His voice softened up as he straightened up, her face still in his hand.\u201cTruly, who do you think you are?\u201d he asked calmly, his voice back to being indifferent. Leyla couldn\u2019t help but wonder if their last interactions together were all just something she conjured up in her mind\u2026How he kept his word to not harm Phoebe, to not harm her as he healed her injuries. Even the jokes and light hearted smiles they secretly shared in the latest autumn season. All those times he intrigued her with every new side she discovered from him\u2026She could still see them as clear as day, and yet, looking now into his dull and cold eyes, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if they all meant nothing to him after all.Her voice was caught in her throat, unable to speak as her body was wracked in terror. Images of her precious uncle trapped behind iron bars, shattering her safe haven in Arvis, and his cold imposing figure muddled her brain.She couldn\u2019t think clearly.\u201cHow bold of you to demand such a thing from me without an equal exchange.\u201d he informed her. Leyla bit her lower lip to stifle back her sobs, but wasn\u2019t successful to do so as she openly cried in front of him.Matthias continued to act as though her world wasn\u2019t falling apart in front of him.\u201cI don\u2019t like entering an exchange that will bring me nothing.\u201d he finished, and Leyla couldn\u2019t help but try once more.\u201cD-Duke..Please-\u201d she sobbed, but he cut her off once more.\u201cSadly your tears are not enough to buy Bill Remmer\u2019s freedom.\u201d\u201cI-I have nothing to offer you but my apologies, please! We don\u2019t have money-\u201d She kept begging. But his grip on her tightened as he forced her to keep quiet.\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about a monetary exchange Leyla.\u201d He explained to her, \u201cA deal can be made with whatever one party wishes to have that the other can only offer to gain the favor they want.\u201d he pulled her closer, until their faces were only a hair\u2019s breadth away. \u201cAnd I\u2019m willing to enter such a trade with you.\u201d\u201cA-a trade?\u201d Leyla\u2019s sobs have quieted as she grew curious as to what he wanted from her.\u201cYes, a trade.\u201d He slowly nodded, glancing up and down at her before meeting her gaze once more. Her eyes widened in realization and began to pull away from him, shaking her head widely in refusal.He released her from his grip, letting her stumble back as he returned to his position and sat unbothered on his wing chair. The fear in Leyla\u2019s eyes was now replaced with a silent fury as she glared at him intently.\u201cI-I won\u2019t do that!\u201d she exclaimed, locks of her hair coming undone due to her struggling, making her neck all the more enticing to him, \u201cYou\u2019re engaged to Lady Claudine! You\u2019re about to get married!\u201d she pointed out in an outrage.Matthias only shrugged as he looked at her inquiringly, \u201cAnd that\u2019s relevant how?\u201d he asked her, casually pulling out a handkerchief as he looked back at her defiant figure. He looked rather bored to be in this conversation.Suddenly, the phone rang once more, making Leyla jump in surprise as she stumbled away from his desk. Matthias only sighed softly, before brushing up against her again as he walked back towards the phone.\u201cThe final decision is up to you, think about it.\u201d He told her as he placed his hand on the ringing phone. \u201cYou can refuse if you want, and that\u2019ll be the end of it.\u201dJust as Leyla was going to ask him what would happen should she refuse, he picked up the phone. She watched as the perverse man in front of her transformed into a respectable Duke so seamlessly.He was talking about his grandmother this time, asking about updates on her health. Leyla couldn\u2019t dream of being anything of value to this man.She found it difficult to breathe as she stood still. She walked out of the room, and was greeted by a nicely lit part of the annex, a complete opposite of the darkness threatening to overwhelm her.She kept walking until she stopped by the stairwell outside, leading up to the second floor of the annex, and crumpled down to the floor in a daze. She could feel her chest constricting as she pulled her knees to her chest. She watched the currents of the outside river reflect the moonlight, getting lost in its shine.She felt as though she had just woken up from a long sleep, dreaming of a beautiful nightmare.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt\u2019s been a few days since Bill Remmer had been taken in by the police. Leyla had gone earlier to meet with the lawyer at the law office. And now, she was heading home with a dejected spirit.\u201cOh Leyla, you\u2019re back!\u201d Mrs. Mona greeted her as soon as she arrived. She had been pacing worriedly in front of their cabin for quite a while before Leyla arrived. \u201cHow was the meeting? Did you meet the lawyer yet? What did he say?\u201d she quickly inquired of the young woman.But Leyla couldn\u2019t speak coherently, too stuck in the endless reminder that there was nothing she could do for Bill. She only shook her head, which made the small glimmer of hope in Mrs. Mona\u2019s eyes disappear.The servants up in Arvis had helped raise some funds to free Bill, giving her the money they\u2019ve gathered from time to time to help her pay for the lawyer without her knowledge. Leyla could do nothing but receive them with gratitude, feeling her heart about to burst with their show of care and concern for both of them.But what good was the money when even the lawyer told her the evidence gathered was stacked against Bill?\u201cOh dear.\u201d Mrs. Mona gasped, \u201cYou know I heard that Madam Norma was ready to drop the charges, but Madam Elysee felt different and wanted him to suffer for what he\u2019s done. But it was only an accident, she could have afforded to forgive him.\u201d Mrs. Mona informed her.Leyla gulped down her infocus, before turning towards the missus.\u201cShould I, perhaps, speak with Madam Elysee then?\u201d she asked softly, but Mrs. Mona only smiled sadly at the suggestion.\u201cI think the better course of action is to see the Duke instead.\u201d Mrs. Mona suggested, \u201cYou see I heard Madams Norma and Elysee couldn\u2019t agree on what to do, so they left the final decision to the young duke.\u201d she explained.At the news Leyla felt herself grow dizzy. Mrs. Mona immediately reached out to steady her back onto her feet, gently escorting her back inside their cabin to get her to sit.\u201cDon\u2019t worry Leyla, I\u2019m certain the Duke will be more gracious than his mother.\u201d Mrs. Mona comforted her, \u201cThere\u2019s still hope yet.\u201d She patted her petite shoulders softly, rubbing her palms up and down the frail woman to warm her up a little before walking around the fireplace to light some fire.\u201cI\u2019m worried for you Leyla dear,\u201d Mrs. Mona voiced out, \u201cYou look so thin these days, and have gone pallor. Mr. Remmer would not like for you to ignore your wellbeing for his sake. Here, I brought some stuff I think you might like.\u201d Mrs. Mona immediately brought over her package she had set aside earlier.Leyla could only watch as Mrs. Mona placed some food before her, alongside some water. She politely smiled up at the missus.\u201cThank you for these Mrs. Mona,\u201d she finally said, \u201cHowever I think I\u2019ll eat them later.\u201d she admitted softly. Mrs. Mona only sighed at Leyla\u2019s dispirited state, before wishing her well and finally took some leave.As soon as she was alone, Leyla buried her face in her hands and began to cry.The lawyer she met with earlier had given her no solution, and more explanations as to why defending Bill from his crimes was a fruitless endeavor. Should he be lucky, he might not serve time in prison, instead, the litigation would only take more time and effort for them to accomplish.Given that compensation for the damages inflicted would be unavoidable, going up against the Herhardt in a legal battle was largely inadvisable.\u201cAt times like this, it\u2019s best for both parties to compromise before going to court.\u201dThat was the last advice the lawyer had given her, which only served to fill her with more dread. She knew that the Herhardt household was devoid of mercy. Perhaps not the entire household, but the Duke certainly was.She\u2019d already gone to see him after all, three days ago to be specific. The last few days she struggled with the decision and tried to take whatever alternative road was presented to her. She couldn\u2019t find it in herself to eat, drink or sleep regularly due to the stress her current predicament landed her in.Her dignity refused to enter such a perverse deal. It was against everything she stood for. She didn\u2019t want to fall into another one of the Duke\u2019s traps.She bit her lip, a nervous tic she can\u2019t seem to get rid of. She stood up from her seat and began to pace around the kitchen, before she returned to the desk to take small sips from the glass of water Mrs. Mona prepared earlier.\u2018If I\u2019m suffering this much, think about the pain Uncle Bill is experiencing right now!\u2019Leyla scolded herself as she recalled the hollow face her dear uncle sported within the past few days. Seeing him like that was like a knife to her heart, being twisted deeper, embedding the blade within the depths of her chest.She can\u2019t continue to act like this. She needed to do something to free her uncle. And she was presented with the only way she could do so successfully.It didn\u2019t matter how much she tried to swerve away from making a deal with them, she always ended up with the same anwer. And that was to accept the Duke\u2019s offer.Her jaw clenched at the thought, remembering the way the Duke gazed at her with unbridled lust, making her feel so disgusted and ashamed of even entertaining the thought. He was so calm back then, and even had the audacity to look so amused with her.She knew that expression well. He wore it enough times whenever he went out hunting just for the fun of it, or whenever he tormented her to the point of crying. No matter what she did to rise up against him, despite her many falls in his presence, she was unable to escape him.She collapsed back onto her chair, but no tears left her eyes. They were too dried up, and her heart too numb to produce them. She could hear her ragged breaths in the still night, much like a soundless cry for help.Compared to the others, her life may seem so insignificant, but the way she lived was oh so important to her. She tried to do right all her life; earn a living through honest, good work and to do nothing she would be ashamed about. That nothing, much less a man\u2019s petty desires, could trample upon her hard earned life\u2026But she\u2019s made up her mind.\u2018What would Uncle Bill think of me, if he knew what I did?\u2019\u00a0she couldn\u2019t help but wonder. Just thinking about him brought up a new surge of worry.And thus in the dead of the night, Leyla embraced the darkness around her, not finding any will in her to move for a long while.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It was already late into the night when Matthias finally managed to sign the last of the documents for the day after thoroughly reviewing it. He leaned back in his chair, before turning to his attendant nearby.\u201cYou are done for the day, you may go now.\u201d he ordered bluntly. The attendant only bowed in acquiesce, retrieving the signed documents in his arms, before swiftly leaving him on his own.Despite the time Matthias spent on his own in the annex, he had lately been spending more time in the building now that he had no access to electricity back in the mansion. Though that wasn\u2019t the only reason why.He felt as though tonight was the night.\u2018Leyla should be coming to visit soon enough.\u2019He thought to himself. He knew she\u2019d been exhausting her resources, trying to find a way out of her situation without having to deal with him. But she should have known by now that he always got what he wanted in the end, no matter how long it took.Matthias knew, on that day of Bill\u2019s accident, that he finally found an undisputable leverage over Leyla. To clip her wings, and have her stay by his side. He\u2019d been making a plan with it in his mind when he heard\u2026And seeing her so desperate in front of him just made him go through with it. And thus here he was, awaiting for an answer he was certain of.He knew her current predicament wasn\u2019t the most proper, or the most correct way of gaining her favor for him; he had been in a hurry to bind her to him. Though he had to throw away his initial plans regarding her, he believed he would eventually be presented with an opportunity to seize that happiness he so desired from her.He reached out to the end of his desk, his fingers opening the cigarette box, grabbing a stick. He brought it up to his lips, the other hand already reaching for the lighter, when a knock disrupted him.KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.Something shifted in his dull eyes when he heard it. It was so soft, so hesitant. A glint returned to his eyes, and despite having not used it, he quickly discarded his cigarette to a nearby trash bin before slowly rising from his seat with barely contained excitement.He took slow, steady steps towards the door, wanting to make her squirm, before he swung the door, slowly revealing Leyla in front of him. It was just as he expected. She did manage to make her decision.A cold breeze rushed through him as he saw her, creating tension between them as they stared at each other wordlessly. He would have thought the time had frozen between them, but the way their clothes rustled and her hair swayed with the wind told him otherwise.Eventually, he moved, stepping aside in a wordless order for her to come in.Leyla turned paler at the sight of him, and despite the growing chill in her bones, she crossed the threshold into his office.The door slowly swung shut, the sound of a lock turning echoing through the silent halls, and the occupants hidden from any outsiders.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla found herself in the exact same spot she had been a few days ago when she had come to beg the Duke for mercy for Uncle Bill\u2019s sake. She stood in front of him, just as she did before as well, but the expression on her face was no longer filled with that glimmer of hope.No, instead, there was only resignation and fear.Matthias sat cross-legged on the sofa across from her, as if to show he was willing to give her space, allowing her more time to gather her thoughts. She fidgeted with her fingers as she took a deep breath before finally breaking the silence.\u201cI am nothing, right next to you, Duke.\u201d she began softly, head held up high as she looked him in the eye. Matthias snorted at her words, tilting his head at her inquiringly.\u201cAnd what of it?\u201d\u201cYou are a respectable member of this community.\u201d she pointed out, \u201cIf you were to risk that all for a slight fancy with a lesser woman, your reputation would be destroyed.\u201d a slight defiant glint echoed in her eyes at that statement. \u201cSo I implore you, Duke, I would do anything, please, but not this.\u201dLeyla thought he would reconsider, but it seemed even for this argument, he had prepared for a counter-statement. He only smirked at her, a triumphant look on his face.\u201cLeyla,\u201d he began, \u201cDid you know my family actually owns a castle by the resort, south of Berg?\u201d he asked her, filling Leyla with a sense of dread with what he was to say.\u201cD-duke\u2026\u201d\u201cYou see, my father was a music enthusiast.\u201d he interrupted, \u201cAnd oftentimes he\u2019d bring many women there, who played fanciful music to him, but the longest he had with him was a famous singer. My mother quite liked her too.\u201dHe gazed up at Leyla, watching the way her face slowly turned pale.\u201cOh she was a very talented singer.\u201d Matthias continued, \u201cWould you like me to tell you how their relationship was? What fate did their reputations end with?\u201dHis voice was sweet, as though he was just telling her an old wive\u2019s tale, it made Leyla speechless how crass he was at implying what he meant. She knew exactly how his predecessors\u2019 reputations ended. There was no way she couldn\u2019t know.Even to this day, even if they\u2019ve long since passed, they are still widely respected and highly regarded by the people of Carlsbar.It seemed after all, there was really no way out of the deal he had given her. She knew that when she came here, but she wanted to try one last time. A different angle to revise the deal set out for her.\u201cSo, so for just one night then?\u201d she clarified, finally looking back into his eyes. Perhaps she was more worthless than she initially thought, she wasn\u2019t even good enough to tarnish his reputation.Leyla thought to herself numbly, that it would be just as though she had fallen from a very tall tree, and got deep wounds from it. She would be unlucky, and it would hurt for a long time, might even leave a scar, but eventually she will recover from it, sooner or later.\u201cSuch an unfair deal that would be, don\u2019t you think, Leyla?\u201d the Duke hummed, \u201cI refuse to enter deals where I couldn\u2019t get the maximum amount of benefits I could take.\u201d he eyed her up and down, \u201cDo you really think yourself so impressive that one night with you would be enough for the price of Bill Remmer\u2019s freedom?\u201d he prodded at her, making her squirm.She couldn\u2019t bear to look at him any longer, swiftly turning her back towards him, but was rooted in place.Should she leave now, she would forever surrender her only hope of helping her uncle. And even if he were to be released after he\u2019s served his sentence, her uncle would never be the same again\u2026Bill\u2019s hollow face in her latest visit flashed through her mind. Her jaw clenched, knuckles turning white as she balled her hands into a fist. Matthias leaned back on his seat, and watched as Leyla fought with herself over what decision she would make.Leyla couldn\u2019t help but think just how despicable he truly was. But how could she expect any different? He really was the type of person who would willfully destroy a person\u2019s life just to get what he wanted, with no regards as to how the other person would feel when it\u2019s done.When he gets bored of her, he\u2019d no sooner throw her away as trash in his pocket. Just as he did with those poor birds he shot and killed whenever he hunted them down for a little bit of fun.Matthias could only smirk at the glare Leyla stared at him with. This time, she turned around to face him fully. Unable to run or turn away from him any longer, Leyla immediately fell to the floor as her knees buckled beneath her. Matthias wasted no time in kneeling in front of her, a smug grin on his face as though he expected her to do so.Deft fingers traveled up her arms, popping one button open at the top of her blouse. Leyla shied away instinctively, but he held her in place\u2026\u201cLeyla,\u201d he whispered, a warm breath hitting her cheeks as he brushed his lips against her ear. \u201cYou have no choice but to do as I wish, that was the deal.\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou said so yourself, didn\u2019t you? You\u2019d do anything?\u201dHe chuckled as he held open her blouse, his other hand coming up to grab her chin, forcing her to look up at him.\u201cHowever, if you did change your mind, well,\u201d he gestured to the entrance of his office, \u201cThe door\u2019s right there.\u201d he pointed out, forcing her to look at the locked door, before slowly letting her go, and pulling away from her.He was reminding her she was the one making a choice to be with him, and not the other way around. Oh how she despised him!He practically cornered her between a rock and a hard place. She was completely desperate by now, how could he make it seem as if she even had a choice in the matter!? She never had one in the first place!Her body trembled as she looked down on the ground, refusing to give him the satisfaction of her looking up at him like a weak woman.\u201cI will never forgive you!\u201d she hissed in a whisper.\u201cDo as you wish!\u201d she finally declared, and Matthias wasted no time in closing the distance between them once again, watching as she shed her blouse, popping the buttons away one by one.Impatient, he grabbed her hands, and ripped her blouse open, the buttons scattering all over the floor as he slid it down her shoulders and threw it aside. Leyla felt herself sink onto the floor, back pressed onto the cold tiles as he nosed her neck, before his lips stopped right next to her ears\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t worry Leyla, I certainly will.\u201d he responded.She wanted nothing more than to hurl curses and insults at him in that instant! However she could only bite her lips in response, feeling the way his eyes roamed all over her. She refused to participate in such an act, turning her head away from him.But, his hand grabbed her by the chin once more, and before she knew it, his lips were upon hers.Leyla moaned in protest at the way he was shoving his tongue down her throat. She wanted to avoid kissing in the activity, but he wouldn\u2019t even allow her that kind of dignity. He covered her with his body, hovering above her half naked form, making her feel more suffocated.He pulled away, a strand of saliva connecting both their lips as he moved down, trailing wet kisses and suckling on her unblemished skin, nipping and biting her wherever he wanted to. She couldn\u2019t help but wince with every action, resolutely looking up at the ceiling instead.She felt his hands shift, calloused palms rubbing at her thighs, slowly going higher and higher. He was rubbing circles at her inner thighs, making heat pool uncomfortably in her stomach with every touch. His hands went up under her skirt, hooking nimble fingers by the edge of her stockings before pulling them all the way down her legs.She choked back a sob as the cool air hit her bare legs, feeling the goosebumps begin to form. The mixed sounds of labored breathing, and moaning echoed in the room, filling the silence between them as he pried her legs open for him.Next he swiftly discarded the rest of her skirt and underwear, tossing them onto the growing pile of her discarded clothes. He settled down between her legs and looked down in all her bare glory\u2026\u201cBeautiful\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but whisper with such adoration as he gazed down at the perfection beneath him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She knew only one thing could bring her peace once this was all over\u2026\u201cYou promised\u2026\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but whisper in between her moans as she felt him thrusting deep into her. Leyla arched her back as he kept going, hands grasping at his biceps, fingernails digging into his skin at the reluctant pleasure coursing through her veins\u2026Matthias looked up at her, lust-filled eyes looking at her in a prodding manner to voice out her thoughts. He was too drunk in euphoria at that moment, feeling her warmth engulfing him, squeezing him tightly inside her. He let go of his grasp in her hair, and used it to cup her flushed cheeks\u2026\u201cYou promised to show mercy\u2026\u201d she continued, letting out a breathy moan when he hit her deep in her sweet spot, hands hastily grabbing purchase on his broad shoulders, \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d she begged, unable to voice further coherent words.Despite being too preoccupied with the feeling of being sheathed inside her, Matthias still had his wits about him, and understood her completely. He couldn\u2019t help but release a dry chuckle as he picked up his pace, grunting whenever she tightened around him.How could he despise her?She looked so delectable, begging for her dear Uncle Bill\u2019s freedom as she writhed in pleasure beneath him. It didn\u2019t matter to him why she agreed to tangle with him at this moment, her eyes still shone prettily like jewels to him.He watched as she struggled to support her weight in her arms, grabbing blindly onto him as she hooked her arms from behind his neck, bringing their faces closer. He could clearly see the tears in the corner of her eyes and he couldn\u2019t help but begin to chase his pleasure at the sight of it.She could burst into tears any minute now, should he delay answering her. She threw her head back with a wanton moan, her eyelids fluttering closed as she lost strength when she felt warmth pool into her. Her body limply lay still on the floor, leaving Matthias panting with sweat on his brows as he hovered above her.He couldn\u2019t help but admire her. She still stubbornly refused to look at him, but that didn\u2019t matter. Nothing changed in the desire he felt for her, in fact it seemed to grow stronger.One more, just one more time, he couldn\u2019t help but think as he pulled her towards him, hands grasping onto her tousled hair firmly, but gently. He saw a glimpse of fear in her as he did so, before she finally turned to look at him.And he ravished her lips once more as they began their intimate dance anew.Truly, this was a fair deal, Matthias thought to himself.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When Leyla awoke from her deep sleep, the whole room was filled with a bright light.She winced when the sunlight hit her eyes, blinking as it adjusted at the flood of light. She could feel her body sore, parts she didn\u2019t know would hurt making themselves known as she gingerly sat up on her bed, before leaning against her headboard.She had half a wish that everything that happened last night was just a cruel nightmare, but the stiffness in her body proved it otherwise. She blinked back remnants of sleep as she turned to look at her reflection in her mirror by the vanity.Last night she had dragged herself half-awake back home. When she finally reached her cabin, she had just barely locked the doors before collapsing in a dreamless sleep on her own bed.She would have liked to wash away last night\u2019s traces on her body, but she was so exhausted she couldn\u2019t even lift a finger after hitting her mattress. The best she could do last night was to get home without driving herself to insanity because of last night\u2019s events.Absentmindedly, her eyes trailed down her body, watching the hickeys he\u2019d left on her skin, the dried body fluids making her feel unkempt and sticky all over. Seeing them once more made the shame run deep inside her as tears welled up in the memory of being violated in the most humiliating way.\u2018It\u2019s nothing,\u2019she told herself as she tried to even her breathing. She dragged herself to her bath, and began to scrub her body.\u2018It\u2019s not that big of a deal, not when you know why you have to do it\u2026\u2019\u00a0she kept telling herself.She only kept scrubbing, rubbing her skin raw until it turned red and her shame was replaced with a numbness as she watched the dirty water flow down the drain. She slowly walked out, robotically putting on some clothes before trudging towards their dining area and sat by the table, staring at nothing\u2026Belatedly she thought she should get something to eat before heading out to visit her Uncle Bill. She needed to gather her strength after all, she couldn\u2019t afford to show signs of her fatigue.Immediately she moved to grab the food Mrs. Mona had brought to her yesterday, setting some out on a plate and placing it on the table. She only chose some of the lighter options. While she knew she needed to eat more, for now she couldn\u2019t find the strength in her to even swallow.Despite not feeling hungry, she dutifully shoved some of the food down her throat, forcing herself to swallow with the aid of some water running down her throat. Once she finished off the last piece of the sliced bread, she caught an odd stack in the corner of her eyes.She had been so out of it in the last few days, she hadn\u2019t noticed it. It took her a while to realize it\u2019s been lying in wait for several days now, considering the light dust gathering on its surface.Curiously, she approached the stack of letters, untying the string around them and picking up the topmost envelope to see who it was from. Her eyes widened and hands shook as she recognized the penmanship written across the sheet\u2026\u2018Kyle!\u2019\u00a0she thought in shock, her heart skipping a beat at seeing his penmanship on it. Immediately she checked the other letters, flipping one after the next with a renewed urgency. She dropped the letters haphazardly on the desk, checking until the last\u2026All of them were from Kyle.She braced herself on the edge of the table, steadying her breathing as she glanced at the multitude of letters addressed solely to her. Where did these come from?! She stared at them in shock for a while, before tearing open the earliest letter she should have received.Tears welled up in her eyes and her hands shook as she began reading the first of many letters Kyle had sent to her. It had been dated back since the beginning of the latest fall season.Her eyes went to the first line of the letter, choking back a sob\u2026[My beloved Leyla,]*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cThank you, Duke. I sincerely don\u2019t know what else to say. Thank you so much.\u201dBill thanked profusely as he bowed deeply to the duke in front of him with a flushed face out of shame.\u00a0\u00a0He looked a little worse for wear, his last few days difficult, but still held so much hope that everything would be fine. And he was proven right when the Duke dropped the charges against him with no compensation needed.He was looking much brighter than ever.\u201cI can never repay you for this mercy you\u2019ve shown me\u2026\u201d he trailed off, tears welling up in his eyes in his ecstatic disbelief over the miracle he was shown. Just then, he saw Leyla entering through the entrance of the police station\u2026He couldn\u2019t help but beam happily at her arrival.\u201cLeyla!\u201d He greeted excitedly towards her. Multiple pairs of eyes around them were drawn to the commotion, looking back and forth from Bill and Leyla, including the Duke and the lawyer he was with.Leyla froze as she momentarily met the Duke\u2019s gaze before looking back at her uncle. Trepidation filled her as she hurriedly went to her uncle\u2019s side.\u201cUncle!\u201d she greeted back, grasping onto his arm tightly as though she was afraid to let go. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201d she hurriedly asked.\u201cIt seems congratulations are in order Leyla,\u201d the police officer with them began, with a beaming smile, \u201cThe Duke has just dropped all charges against your uncle.\u201d he explained.Leyla tried to act as though it was a surprise, but the smile on her face was stiff as she now turned to face the Duke.\u201cI-is that so?\u201d she asked slowly, her head turning jerkily before she fully faced the duke to give him a respectable bow of her head in thanks despite the deep rage filling her in seeing him, \u201cM-my sin-sincerest gratitude for you, Duke.\u201d She thanked him reluctantly.There was a rush of emotions circling inside her mind as both she and her uncle bowed in thanks in front of him. Her hands grew clammy on her grip on her uncle\u2019s arms, feeling her body grow colder every second passing with him nearby\u2026At a distance, nothing seemed amiss to the others despite how awkward Leyla was acting. The people only chalked it up to her innate shyness. No one else noticed her warring emotions, at least, no one else but Duke Herhardt did.Matthias and Leyla\u2019s eyes met once again, as his lawyer spoke with the police for some last minute details per his instructions. Leyla\u2019s eyes stared at him with deep contempt, to which he stared back challengingly, glancing discretely towards her uncle in a subtle threat.If she wanted to keep their little affair a secret, she should know better to hide her emotions, starting with stopping her hands from shaking so much.There was a small upturn on the corner of his lips as he watched her dainty little hands. He could just have easily left it all up to his lawyer to smoothen out the details of Bill\u2019s release alone, but he wanted to come.He wanted to see his impertinent mistress, Leyla Lewellin.Memories from last night flooded the back of his mind.After their coupling had stopped, the annex had gone silent, leaving only their heavy breathing in the air. Their clothes were scattered all over the floor, their figures all disheveled. Matthias only took one look at his form, before forcing himself to stand up.Leyla then remained curled up on the floor, hugging herself. The firelight nearby illuminated her hunched form, casting a soft orange glow on her pale skin, littered with marks, courtesy of him. Her shaky breaths echoing against the cackling fire.Matthias picked up his discarded trousers, pulling them up smoothly and wore back his dress shirt before plopping down on the sofa nearby to continue adoring Leyla\u2019s naked form. He liked the dark contrast of his marks left on her. It fed the hungry beast inside him with deep satisfaction.Shame he couldn\u2019t see her face from where he was because she still refused to look at him.Her long golden locks were pasted on her back with the sweat she accumulated. Prints of his hands, from the rough way he\u2019d gripped her hips and thighs reminded him of how soft she felt in his hands. He thought of calling out her name to make her look at him, but shook the thought away, replacing it with a cigarette\u2026Still, he couldn\u2019t find it in himself to light it up.He couldn\u2019t help but watch how she stubbornly refused to move from her fetal position, still turned away from him. It grated on his nerves, he had half a mind to grab her form and force her to do as he wished\u2026But that wasn\u2019t what he wanted from her.Losing the desire to smoke, he only discarded the unlit cigarette once more, before he stood back up. He walked towards his adjoined bedroom, brows furrowed with the slight regret of not taking a few extra minutes of taking her on his bed instead.He felt a slight guilt on having her experience their coupling on a cold hard floor instead of on his plush, and soft mattress. He went back to check on her, and watched as she stiffened up at the sound of his return.He only scoffed at her childishness, grabbing his hung coat by the rack and tossed it haphazardly over her prone form. She winced at the sudden contact, but still did not move. It was starting to become difficult who was being insulted between them in his mind.Trying to reign in his emotions, Matthias could only retreat momentarily to his bathroom to get his emotions in order. She annoyed him as much as she satisfied him, which made him at a loss of what to do next.He took a short shower, resolving to soothe the lingering ache on Leyla, but when he was done, and went back out to gather her in his arms, he found himself alone and bewildered. Leyla was nowhere in sight anymore.She had run away from him.He frantically searched around the annex, before he finally came to terms she was gone and left with no goodbye. He saw her discarded blouse, destroyed with the buttons ripped and scattered all over the marble flooring. If he were to look closely, he could also see a few strands of her golden hair left behind.He also saw his jacket hung carelessly by the rack and couldn\u2019t help but chuckle in amusement. Did she hate the thought of being with him so much she\u2019d rather risk being seen in such a scandalous state of undress to return home?He was partially thankful he hadn\u2019t gone after her then, for he knew his patience was reaching its limit. Should he have encountered her one more time last night, he believed he could have treated her a lot rougher than before.And thus he only stared down at Leyla in front of him now, convincing himself he made a wise decision last night. It had just been a few hours since he buried himself in her, and already he could feel the same stirrings he felt for her last night when he found himself bereft of his mistress.\u201cYou made such a noble decision Duke,\u201d the police praised him, bringing Matthias back to the present moment. \u201cTruly you are deserving of the respect and praise as the head of Herhardt House.\u201dMatthias only briefly thanked him, ending the conversation effectively before leaving the police station in a swift manner. It didn\u2019t take long enough before Leyla, Bill and the other police officers to start moving once more.Bill went after as Matthias\u2019 chauffeur opened up his door for him.\u201cDuke, I will never forget this kindness until I die!\u201d Bill thanked him profusely, \u201cTruly I won\u2019t.\u201d He declared earnestly, bowing one last time at him. Matthias only stared at the gardener\u2019s niece, a dark glint in his eye.\u201cIt was nothing, Mr. Remmer.\u201d he replied, watching the way Leyla looked sick at the thought of her uncle thanking him and singing his praises. \u201cI expect to see you in Arvis again.\u201d he concluded, before finally getting in his car.Leyla all that time refused to smile once more. He couldn\u2019t help the small grin he sent to her as the car door closed between them. Truly he\u2019ll see her once more in a similar state soon.He\u2019d make sure of it.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When the Duke had finally left the police station, Leyla felt relief flood her body at his disappearance. They both did some last minute checks on the charges that were dropped before they finally left. Leyla hooked arms with her uncle, resting her head on his shoulder. They talked for a while, Leyla asking what she missed before finally speaking up.\u201cWhat do you mean we\u2019re still staying in Arvis?\u201d she asked with a slight frown, \u201cWhy are we staying?\u201dBill could hardly contain his joy as he squeezed an arm around her comfortingly. She found herself deeply confused as they walked back to their quaint cabin in Arvis.\u201cOh it\u2019s all the Duke\u2019s doing really,\u201d he replied bashfully, still sporting a wide grin in his relief, \u201cHe told me I could still work in Arvis, and continue living in the cabin.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Leyla couldn\u2019t help but ask dumbly. She had hoped they could take this as a chance to move away. \u201cBut uncle-\u201d Bill softly held up a hand, wordlessly imploring her to let him continue.\u201cAt first I wanted to refuse my dear, really. I felt so guilty about my neglect that I couldn\u2019t bear to go back to work there.\u201d He admitted, \u201cHowever, the Duke only told me to take this as a penance for my misdeeds, and work harder in restoring the greenhouse back to its former glory.\u201dLeyla could only feel the growing pit of dread in her stomach.\u201cHe also proceeded to tell me that my skills and expertise were a crucial part in the restoration, and I thought about it and agreed. I am a gardener, and have worked on the greenhouse for many years. Who better to fix my mistakes than myself after all?\u201d he turned to Leyla, looking for some sort of approval.\u201cWould the madams allow you to return to work?\u201d Leyla asked him worriedly, to which Bill only smiled softly at her fretting.\u201cThe Duke tells me that Madam Norma welcomes me gladly, and Madam Elysee has conceded to their wishes.\u201d he answered her, \u201cAh what a godsend the Duke really is Leyla! Our savior he truly is!\u201d he praised.Leyla could only numbly agree.Saviour\u2026Uncle Bill sang him praises and called him their saviour. Leyla wanted nothing more than to shout her contradictions and ruin their image of him. He was a vile and cruel man, and everyone deserved to see him as she saw him\u2026But at the same time, she wanted to spare her uncle the unbearable guilt he would feel if he knew what she had to do just so he could walk free once more. She couldn\u2019t do that to him.Thus she kept her mouth shut, doing her best to reign in her indignation until she could calm down.Uncle Bill proceeded to tell her about how he felt so guilty for destroying such a masterpiece over the last few days. And that perhaps, should he help it be restored to its former glory, he would feel a faint sense of peace in seeing it through.\u201cTruly it\u2019s the only way I could ever repay the kindness he\u2019s shown us.\u201d Bill finished.\u201cI understand, uncle.\u201d Leyla softly replied. If only he knew their debt was already being paid, but she\u2019ll take that secret to the grave if she could.\u201cTruly Leyla, you needn\u2019t worry too much anymore.\u201d Bill tried placating her, \u201cI promise to be careful from now on, I\u2019ll do better in following precautions.\u201d he sighed, stopping in front of the gates of Arvis before pulling her into a tender hug.Leyla could only watch how her uncle\u2019s vibrancy was slowly returning to him, and hugged him back. Despite her shame, she was happy he was out. She never wanted to see him as hollow as he did ever again.Suddenly there was a cacophony nearby, growing loudly by the second. They both pulled away and looked to see what the commotion was all about, and Bill could only laugh jovially, at the sight of the servants rushing to greet them.\u201cBill! You really are back!\u201d\u201cOh thank goodness!\u201d\u201cWe missed you Bill!\u201dThey gathered around Bill, reaching out and hugging and touching him in any way they could. Leyla only stepped back, giving them a wide berth to be sufficiently reunited with her uncle. She watched as they excitedly welcomed him back.Their joy was infectious that she couldn\u2019t help but smile serenely at the sight in front of her. She turned away, eyes glancing at the beautiful and elaborate gates that seemed to close in on her.The smile she had slipped, eyes returning to a dull state as the golden emblem was reflected in her eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her eyes lowered to the ground, looking quite embarrassed at her changing her decision.\u201cI\u2019m truly sorry for giving you trouble over my transfer.\u201d\u00a0Leyla apologized, bowing her head in remorse. The headmistress only brushed off her apology.\u201cNonsense,\u201d the headmistress said, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re staying in our school there\u2019s no trouble to be had.\u201d she pointed out before clearing her throat, and looking a bit sheepish this time. \u201cBy the way Miss Lewellin, may I inquire if you changed your mind about Theo?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Leyla looked up, \u201cTheo?\u201d she softly wondered to herself, before memories of the grocery store owner\u2019s son popped up in her mind, \u201cOh! Theo?\u201d she looked back at the headmistress who nodded eagerly.Fortunately, the headmistress\u2019 spouse neared them, carrying a tray with tea, effectively cutting off their conversation.\u201cCome now dear, let\u2019s not force her.\u201d interjected her husband, \u201cLook at how embarrassed Miss Lewellin is. Let the young people be.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just saying that Theo is a perfectly good young man.\u201d the headmistress haughtily shot back at him before looking pointedly at Leyla, who only smiled awkwardly at the two of them.She really wanted them to get together, and couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Leyla thought Theo was not up to her standards. She knew Leyla had been engaged to Dr. Etman\u2019s son, but broke it off.The headmistress couldn\u2019t help but think Leyla should know by now that looking for better prospects won\u2019t look too good for her. It could even backfire on her, making her look greedy when she knew Leyla was anything but.Deeming a change of subject was in order, the headmistress cleared her throat before straightening up, shaking further thoughts off her mind. She then gave a cheerful smile to the young teacher.\u201cWell then, now that you\u2019re staying with us, how about we place you as the star of our play next year?\u201d she suggested jovially, \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to garner huge amounts of donations once more if we do that.\u201dLeyla only smiled at the sudden change of subject. She knew it was a poor joke on the headmistress\u2019 part, but this felt much easier to laugh about now after the harrowing events she had experienced lately.Soon enough they wrapped up their conversation about the school, their students, and the plans for the next semester. Leyla bid the couple goodbye, before exiting the headmistress\u2019 house.The temperature outside was freezing, the cold chilling her through the bone, making her walk at a sluggish pace. However, Leyla found herself wanting to prolong the time it took her to reach Arvis.She found herself stopping right by the central station\u2019s square, looking around aimlessly. She began to move once more, drawing closer to the display windows by the mall, gazing at the items with no particular thought, vaguely looking at her translucent reflection\u2026\u2018What would happen if I just suddenly disappeared from here?\u2019\u00a0she couldn\u2019t help but wonder.Huh, even wishful thinking proved to be depressing. Leyla knew deep down there was no way she could ever go through with escaping the Duke. She couldn\u2019t leave her uncle behind, not when it\u2019s his life on the line.\u2018Even if I managed to convince my uncle to move and leave Arvis with me, the duke would stop at nothing to find him.\u2019It would also be counterproductive of her if she were to summon the duke\u2019s ire in her defiance. It could make things worse than it already is.With a deep sigh, Leyla closed her eyes, leaning her head against the cold glass, the helplessness overwhelming her once again.It was rather obvious to her the duke was keeping her on a leash by giving her uncle sweet opportunities to stay in Arvis. She couldn\u2019t believe he would go to such lengths just to satisfy his carnal desires. She was sure now that once he was through with her, and thoroughly sated, he would dispose of her just as quickly.That cursed night said it so plainly and loudly just how little the duke thought of her.She began to walk once more, finding no relief in prolonging her stay in the biting cold. She turned down a familiar platanus road, feet moving through the snow. She never prayed for a miracle as hard as she did now, when Kyle\u2019s letter echoed in the back of her mind, halting her steps once more\u2026[My beloved Leyla]He started every one of his letters that way. She knew this because she spent that morning reading the dozen letters he\u2019d sent her way. As much as she wanted to be crossed with her uncle for such deceit, she could understand why he withheld them from her.When they returned to the police station later that day, and he saw the letters spread all over the dining table, Uncle Bill began to stammer and beg for her forgiveness. Leyla could only smile mournfully towards him.\u201cI\u2019m so ashamed to have done such a horrible thing to you.\u201d he\u2019d told her that day, his hair looking an unusual gray in the light of the winter\u2019s pale sun. \u201cBut I want you to know that I\u2019m with you every step of the way, Leyla, even if it means you want to go back to Kyle.\u201dHe sounded so sure, Leyla recalled, his eyes shining determinedly. He kept apologizing again, explaining how foolish it was of him to do such a thing and wanted to come clean the day of the explosion. Leyla couldn\u2019t find it in herself to mind\u2026\u201cI\u2019m fine uncle.\u201d she replied then, before swiftly inviting him to some breakfast she had prepared before leaving their cabin to fetch him. Uncle Bill could only nod in reply, both of them barely managing to finish half their plates.It didn\u2019t take long for Leyla to spot the gates of Arvis. She arrived quicker than she\u2019d like. Her fists instinctively clench at the sight of them, inciting a deep rage at the memory of its master\u2026\u2018Just as I am nothing to you, you are nothing to me.\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought rebelliously as she crossed the threshold. Memories of that night still plagued her dreams, giving her restless sleep.\u00a0\u2018I won\u2019t let the likes of you have the power to hurt me.\u2019Her entire body was freezing, but her hands were clammy. She quickened up her pace, boldly marching through the pavement when she finally arrived in their cabin. She quickly locked up the door before releasing a sigh of relief.The cabin was empty for now, with her uncle largely occupied with the repairs of the greenhouse since early morning. She suspected it won\u2019t be until later tonight that she\u2019ll be seeing him. He really was so eager to pay back the duke for his\u00a0kindness.Leyla plopped herself on top of her bed haphazardly, looking at the ceiling in thought.[My beloved Leyla]She closed her eyes shut, bringing up an arm to cover her eyes, wiping the memories of his letters off her mind. But whenever she would, horrid memories of her night with the duke would resurface. She wanted to do nothing more than cry that instant, but the light tapping on her window distracted her.There was a sudden lurch in her heart when hearing the sound. Slowly, she turned her head to her window. Once upon a time she had been eager to hear the sound of her precious Phoebe arriving to visit her.Now she could only fear dread, for when she drew her windows open, and Phoebe flew in, she had a note tied to her ankle.A note written by the Duke.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYou don\u2019t plan to keep the gardener in Arvis forever, do you?\u201dClaudine immediately asked, cutting straight to the point. She had a polite smile on her face as she looked at her fiance inquiringly. Upon her question, multiple pairs of eyes snapped in her direction, darting back and forth between her and the Duke.\u201cClaudine!\u201d the Countess Brandt hissed, scolding her softly as she sat nearest to her. But Claudine cared not for everyday theatrics at the moment. She wanted clear-cut answers, and she would get them from the Duke himself.\u201cTruly your decision to drop the charges against the gardener baffled so many of us, and while commendable, it doesn\u2019t explain why he\u2019s still here in Arvis, working and living for you.\u201d Claudine pointed out. \u201cAre you confident that he won\u2019t make the same mistake again? What if it causes another mayhem for you with worse consequences?\u201d\u201cThat is quite true my Lady,\u201d Matthias replied, looking charmingly at her with a smile on his lips, \u201cHowever I also believe that he could better handle the restoration of the greenhouse you so dearly loved. After all, he was the one mostly in charge of its design and arrangement since its conception.\u201d He explained calmly to her in front of their audience.Claudine knew by then that whatever argument she would make, there was no changing his decision.\u201cWell, I won\u2019t argue that I did love the greenhouse as it was, and would like to see it restored to its former glory,\u201d she began, \u201cBut I also fear that having someone, who\u2019d once been careless in his work, handling such a delicate project, no matter his expertise.\u201d she calmly finished, sending a demure smile to everyone present.When she made no further argument, indicating she would retreat from such a discussion any longer, the Countess Brandt looked more relieved sitting beside her.There had been an uproar in the community when word had spread of Madam Norma being involved with an accident caused by one of their seasoned employees. An even greater praise the Herhardt House garnered when the duke dropped all charges against him. Her line of questioning could have been interpreted as worry and fear about their upcoming wedding, but it couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth.For beneath each word she masked in concern for their health and safety, was her concern of one Leyla Lewellin.She wasn\u2019t worried about Leyla\u2019s state of mind, or her uncle\u2019s. No, she was concerned about whether or not the duke used this opportunity to get Leyla to cave in to his advances.Her eyes darted towards her fiance, and narrowed at his posture. He did seem a little laid back. She was assured he did manage to have her already. It was just in his nature. She knew he would have milked every opportunity he was presented with to the very last drop.There was no way Leyla was disappearing from him any time soon.Initially she had been worried at the news of the explosion in Arvis. Images darting to the worst case scenarios when she heard Madam Norma had been within the vicinity of the explosion by the greenhouse. She also rejoiced along with the others when she heard she only retained minor injuries, but was saddened at the loss of the greenhouse.She took it with grace, and allowed herself to act accordingly, but in the back of her mind she couldn\u2019t help but silently cheer at the fact this would be a great opportunity for Leyla and her uncle to move away in Arvis. She was absolutely positive Leyla would have taken the chance.But then she heard about the Duke pardoning Bill Remmer, and she grew suspicious and critical. Worry surged through her at the thought of Matthias taking Leyla for himself, and she grew anxious at the possibility of a relationship forming between the two of them.How scandalous it would be for both his wife and mistress to be living under the same roof! She knew that whether or not Leyla left Arvis, there would be no changing her status with Matthias. In fact, if word of their affair were to get out, it would be their reputations on the line, not hers.It was just a personal preference of hers that Leyla was out of the image by the time she ascended to the title as Duchess Herhardt.She seemed to recall as well of Riette warning her to not provoke Matthias, just recently even. He advised her to leave them alone, and not butt in on their relationship. He looked absolutely serious in telling her, hoping she would see the sense in his words.But Claudine was a little stubborn, and she couldn\u2019t see or understand Riette\u2019s warnings. Despite that, she would heed his advice as she saw fit. After all, she knew that the only reason the gardener was able to retain his place in Arvis was because of Leyla.Still for the life of her, she couldn\u2019t understand how Leyla managed to wrap her finger around the Duke so securely. Perhaps she did know how to work her charms against men after all. They do say it\u2019s always the quiet ones, the ones who seemed innocent.But the thought of their affair would only further sour her mood further, and the day was just getting started. She needed a different subject, and thus resolved to act more cordially in front of everyone, appearing more pleasant than how she actually felt.By the end of dinner, Claudine found herself absolutely parched. Her endless engagement in polite conversation taxing her greatly. Fortunately, it was easy for both her and the Countess Brandt to excuse themselves earlier, enabling them to retire back to their beds.On their way out, the Countess immediately broke the silence between them.\u201cI might have scolded you earlier for questioning the duke, but I do agree with your sentiments.\u201d she began, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how he could just drop all the charges against the gardener. I can\u2019t help but think the Herhardt House has turned soft.\u201d the Countess scoffed irritably.Claudine was escorted by her mother to the guest bedroom, and continued to air out her grievances. Claudine glanced by the room\u2019s window, where she had a perfect view of the wrecked greenhouse. She only hummed agreeably with her mother\u2019s words, when a smirk found its way on her lips the more she stared at the greenhouse.\u201cFret not, dear mother,\u201d Claudine replied once her mother quieted, \u201cI can assure you, come next summer, the gardener won\u2019t be a problem anymore.\u201d At her words, the Countess was startled and came up to stand beside her.\u201cWhat are you saying Claudine? That you\u2019d fire him?\u201d her mother asked incredulously, \u201cYou\u2019d go against Matthias\u2019 and Madam Norma\u2019s wishes?\u201dClaudine only hummed for a moment, before turning to face the countess and smiling brightly back at her mother.\u201cI\u2019m just saying that the new Duchess of Herhardt would be in need of a new gardener.\u201d she calmly replied.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cI\u2019ve finished preparing it just as you ordered, master.\u201d Hessen dutifully informed him with a bow. Matthias, who had been staying in the reception room of the annex, glanced at him briefly before looking down at the large silver domed dish on his desk.\u201cWell done.\u201d he briefly said, before taking the slew of mail Hessen handed out to him. He dismissed his butler, who left him alone to his devices.Matthias leaned back on the sofa, flipping through his mail. Most of them were invitations for various upcoming year-end parties and social events. He even saw some of them containing news of the Crown Prince visiting with his wife. They were scheduled to tour the northern part of the empire early next year after all.Once he was done skimming through them, he grabbed his fountain pen by the inner pocket of his jacket to begin writing his replies. The sight of the pen brought a forlorn smile on his lips, it had been with him since last fall.He clicked the pen closed, and on its lid was engraved a name in golden letters.Leyla Lewellin.Her name glistened in the firelight. He couldn\u2019t help but feel some sense of amusement in using something of hers for the most menial tasks he does everyday.\u201cWhy do you keep stealing my stuff?\u201dShe had complained about it once, the frustration clear on her face when she realized he was the one who took it. He couldn\u2019t help but let out a fond chuckle when she likened him to a crow. He could say the same for her.He turned the pen between his slender fingers, before he glanced down in his wristwatch. He counted down the seconds, until finally the clock\u2019s hands struck at a certain time, when a familiar knock echoed inside his office.He put the pen back in his breast pocket, and languidly rose to his feet. His footsteps clicked through his polished office floor, and swung the door open as he neared it.On the other side of the door was just the very person he expected to see.His dearest mistress, Leyla.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And Leyla entered without pause, but unlike that night, she did not stop at the reception room.No, she headed straight to his bedroom. Matthias couldn\u2019t help the smug upturn on his lips, but chose not to question her, and simply followed suit. He was looking forward to what she was planning for him today.She never failed him before, he doubted she would start now.When Leyla reached the door of his room, her nerves gripped her once more, causing her to hesitate. However, she also wanted this done as quickly as possible. She held onto the knob but had yet to open the door.[I\u2019ve done my part. You should do yours.]Those were his words, sent to her by her bird.Matthias paused a few steps behind her, watching her for any further movement. Just as he was to question her on her actions, Leyla swiftly turned the knob, walking in with a determined look on her face. Silently he continued to walk a few paces behind her, observing her actions as to what she was just planning to do tonight.He leaned back against the closed door, crossing his arms across his chest as he continued to appraise her. She stood stock still in the middle of his bedroom, fiddling with her fingers for a moment before resolutely advancing to his bed.Leyla immediately set her belongings: glasses, scarf, gloves and coat, by the bedside table, neatly arranging them.[I\u2019ve done my part. You should do yours.]How crude of him, she couldn\u2019t help but think, to demand she fulfill their deal. What a role she had to play indeed. Recalling his note only served to root her in place, she didn\u2019t want this. He might have as well told her outright to start acting like his mistress!She felt so cornered, stuck between a wall with a cat in front of her, while she was the mouse! Her legs gave in, causing her to drop to the floor, unable to move any longer.She thought she had made her peace already, but the memories of that night came flooding back in full force, rendering her paralyzed. For a moment she thought she had blacked out, but she was only numb with the hurt and shame she felt in the face of her weakness.What she did with the Duke was the furthest thing from an act of love. Despite the sweet nothings he whispered to her ear, his actions only proved him to be a brute. And what\u2019s worse, it wasn\u2019t just a simple carnal desire to bed a woman\u2026No\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful Leyla, especially when you cry and beg.\u201d he whispered to her in the midst of his throes of passion.She didn\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been, only that she had sat too long on the cold floors when the winter breeze finally seeped into her frame, through the room\u2019s open windows. And then a different memory came to mind, to a much earlier, and much pleasant time.Back when the duke was still someone she could find redeeming qualities to.\u201cSo Leyla, cry,\u201d he smiled so sweetly at her, \u201cEven better if you beg.\u201d he finished off. And despite his cruel words, she couldn\u2019t help but think of him as beautiful that summer night last year.Truly, he enjoyed seeing her cry so much, and that was the reason he could stand to make her suffer! She chuckled hysterically to herself, sobbing through the memories. She hated how she kept trying to find reason, to give him excuses as to why he\u2019d do horrid things to her!\u201cLeyla!\u201dSuddenly, Leyla awoke at the sound of her uncle Bill calling out to her. Groggily she sat up, and saw she was back in the Duke\u2019s room. Ah, she couldn\u2019t help but realize with such depreciation, she still had a role to fulfill.She nervously got up from her spot, and headed towards the windows, drawing the curtains to a close as she rubbed the tears away with the sleeves of her shirt. If he wanted to see her cry and beg, then she wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction.Not anymore.He\u2019d taken something from her in the worst possible way. And while she can\u2019t escape him anymore, she resolved not to give him any satisfaction as he took more and more from her. Then perhaps he\u2019d grow bored faster, and thus discard her sooner.She turned around, hands immediately coming to the buttons of her blouse and deftly opened it one button at a time. Leyla expertly undressed herself, fixing her clothes along the way until she was only in her undergarments.Her breath hitched as she went to remove it, but she managed to do so quickly and swiftly. Considering he\u2019d already seen her in a much more pathetic state before, there would be no point in delaying their coupling due to her embarrassment.Matthias could only stare at her in a baffled manner. He had been content to watch her cry and struggle, but he hadn\u2019t been expecting her to be so willing in baring herself whole to him. She even took her clothes off herself.He couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she\u2019d gone insane over the last few days. It\u2019s his only plausible explanation as to why she\u2019s acting not like herself at all.He watched as Leyla picked up her clothes, setting them down to the chair nearby in a neat pile. Her hands then went up, and pulled loose the pin, keeping her hair in place, letting golden locks cascade down her pale neck, and slender shoulders, falling up until the small on her back.He felt himself being mesmerized by the sight of her in front of him. He was intoxicated by her, he was beginning to lose his inhibitions. His breathing grew ragged the more he kept staring. She then gingerly sat by the edge of his bed, waiting for him\u2026And oh, what a sight that was. She doesn\u2019t know just what she was doing to him. He ran a palm through his dark locks. Seated like that, with her body shaking in anticipation, it was almost like she was looking forward to being with him.And he stalked slowly over to her, watching as her flush spread from her cheeks down to her chest as she looked down, struggling to avert her eyes from him.\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Matthias growled under his breath, grasping her chin in his hand, forcing her to look up at him. Leyla kept quiet as she stared at him, her throat bobbing up and down as she swallowed back an insult.\u201cMy part.\u201d she hissed at him in a whisper, but the shakiness in her voice failed to make it threatening.He hummed, tilting his head at her, \u201cAnd what is your part?\u201dHe wanted to hear it straight from her. But Leyla clenched her jaw, refusing to take part in his satisfaction.\u201cYou know what.\u201d she boldly replied, willingly looking up at him in defiance despite flinching at the way his gaze narrowed at her. \u201cYour deal laid it out so clearly.\u201dMatthias only gave her a once over, giving her body shivers as he glanced at her. He hummed as he watched the way she acted like a prim and proper lady despite her state of undress.When he finally met her eyes, he couldn\u2019t help but let out a self-deprecating laugh. At the back of his mind, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if paying a random whore to sleep with him could make him feel as dirty as he did now?When his laughter died down, he turned back to Leyla with a glare.He stroked her golden locks, humming indifferently at her, as though to praise her for being so obedient to him. He started out slow, and soft, just as he does when it comes to her, smiling comfortingly at her.When it seemed like she was relaxed enough, he poised to strike!His hand came down to her neck, clasping it firmly, making her gasp in terror. He ignored the fear in her eyes as she clasped onto his wrist with both hands, as he pushed her into the mattress, climbing over her.Matthias wanted to see what she would do if he tightened his hand on her pressure points, making her gasp for precious air as he hovered above her. He only chuckled manically for a while, his reflection catching on the mirror hanging over the mantelpiece by the marble-white fireplace.No longer could he see the revered Duke Matthias von Herhardt. No, the man he could see was now tainted. He could see it plain as day now, how ruined he\u2019d become simply because for once in his life, he couldn\u2019t just have what he wanted.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When Leyla\u2019s erratic breathing finally quieted down, Matthias roused from the bed, leaving Leyla to lie on her stomach. She was exhausted, but not enough to miss his movements. She felt some relief in seeing him leave.\u2018It\u2019s over now.\u2019She couldn\u2019t help but quietly cheer in her mind. She stayed still, afraid to draw attention to herself. She was faintly aware of the blanket tossed over her form in a poor attempt to give her some form of decency. She only wished he\u2019d leave her alone like he did that previous night so she could finally leave.She heard his footsteps drifting away, before she finally let out a sigh. Until she heard the footsteps growing louder. Did she rejoice too soon?The tension seeped through her body. She felt as though she was at a breaking point.Her fists slowly clenched onto the rumpled sheets. It was a simple task, to look up to see what he was up to, but she was determined not to move.She won\u2019t make it easy for him.The Duke, she assumed by the way the bed dipped somewhere behind her, was back. In the corner of her eyes, she could tell he was already dressed.Matthias looked down, a smirk curling up his lips as he gazed down upon her. He reached out, gently caressing her tousled hair, patting her like he would a pet. He brushed her hair aside, to reveal her flushed face, looking as defiant as ever.He dipped his head down, breath brushing up against her earlobes. Leyla couldn\u2019t repress the shiver that ran through her spine.\u00a0\u2018Don\u2019t start crying now!\u2019\u00a0she scolded herself, feeling the tears threatening to form.She repeated it like a mantra. She had reached this far without crying, she wouldn\u2019t dare start now.\u201cGood job Leyla.\u201d Matthias praised her with a sultry whisper. There was a ghost of a kiss in his words, before he finally pulled away from her.She felt his weight disappear on the mattress and listened to the sound of his footsteps fading out. When she heard the door swing and click to a close, and heard no other movement, she finally rose herself.She was finally, truly alone once more.Leyla could feel the pain in her swollen lips, she faintly tasted a metallic tongue as she licked her lips. She had been cut, but it wasn\u2019t as though it was a big wound. She then found herself sinking to the floor, her reflection catching sight, making her wince and avert her view of it.After a moment, she found herself looking back at her reflection. She saw the way her eyes looked back at her dully. This night was just another meaningless tumble beneath the sheets. But no amount of excuses could make her brush away the pain she could feel so easily.She could hardly find the strength in her to move, she would likely be unable to dress herself at this rate. It was almost like Matthias made sure she would be exhausted to do so once they were done.So instead, Leyla crawled poorly towards her clothes, reaching into her coat\u2019s pocket to get some handkerchief, and began to wipe her body down with any bodily and sticky fluids she had on. Her breath kept hitching with every stroke of the handkerchief.\u2018Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry dont cry dontcrydontcrydontcrydontcry\u2026\u2019\u00a0she kept repeating like a mantra over her head, growing more frantic with every second she spent longer trying to clean herself.Finally done, she finally managed to stand up, and dressed herself once more, before moving out of the annex and walked back home. She took great care to hide from the light of the moon, ducking beneath the trees to stay in the shadows, kicking every random acorn or pebble in her path away from her numbly.[My beloved Leyla]Kyle\u2019s voice echoed in her thoughts as she recalled his letters. She managed to arrive back in her cabin, undisturbed and quickly went inside her room quietly. She still had one last letter to read from him.She\u2019d burned them all, and now only one remained.She waited for the fire to burn brighter, before she carried over the last letter closer, and broke the seal. She flipped the papers open, and began to read it, his voice echoing in her mind as though he was reading it to her\u2026[My beloved Leyla,Will you marry me once more?I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve reached a point of proposing to you once more, and through a piece of paper at that. It sounds less sincere this way, I know, but I\u2019ve never been more sincere in my life than at this moment to you.This might sound a bit of consolation, but my grandfather has promised to me a share of inheritance. Come next spring, after my birthday, I would have the sole claim to it. It\u2019s not a lot of money I\u2019m afraid, but I am certain it would be enough for us to start over.We could move closer to the college district, find a small house to make into a home, and continue our studies and fulfill our dreams. If you fear we\u2019re going too fast, then I don\u2019t mind slowing down. We can go entirely at your own pace, even if it takes until graduation before we can be wed. I could do it, I will do anything so long as I can stay beside you.So my beloved, please, won\u2019t you come to Ratz with me? You can take the test again, and I\u2019m certain you would pass because you\u2019re the most intelligent person I know. That way we could study together, and we can work on our dreams side by side.Do you remember those stories we used to share with each other Leyla? We promised that one day, I shall become a doctor, and you the greatest ornithologist. We would lead the most wondrous life! I still wish for that day to come. Whenever I dream of a future, you are the one constant I can always see in it.You are my dearest friend, my sole lover. You are my future, and I hope one day to be your husband, and father of your children. For you are forever my dearest Leyla.I won\u2019t deny the love I carry for my parents, for I know they love me just the same. That\u2019s an irrefutable fact, but Leyla, I will admit I cannot bear to walk down a path that makes me so unhappy. Their idea of my happiness is not my happiness. It is merely my mother\u2019s vanity winning.But I know where my happiness lies. So Leyla, would you accept me back? Would you allow yourself to be my happiness once more?I cannot promise you a life of grandeur, I\u2019m afraid. Not right now when I still can\u2019t break free of my parents\u2019 shadows. As I am, I am a nobody in society and the world at large. But I can assure you this.I will love and cherish you for as long as you will allow it. I swear that no harm shall come to you again, whether by another\u2019s hand or mine. I only ask that you reconsider us once more. Do not think about what will be just yet, or what was.I only implore you to think with your heart. Do our hearts still beat the same Leyla? If you say yes, then I\u2019ll hesitate no more. I\u2019ll come to you at once! We can leave Arvis together, and find our happy place in this world!With love always,Kyle]Leyla lost track of how many times she\u2019s read, and re-read the letter until the embers of the flame in front of her died down. Dawn had arrived once more, the rooster croaking as the sun peaked out the clouds.She won\u2019t deny that once upon a time, she dreamt of a future with Kyle. It had been within her grasp once, but was then cruelly replaced by a nightmarish future with the Duke. Only it was no nightmare anymore. Just her reality.She could hear her uncle waking up, the way he groaned as he stretched his limbs to start an early morning. She rose quietly from her bed, and headed straight out to their stove. She grasped tightly onto Kyle\u2019s last letter, staring quietly into the flame, before tossing it over fire.She quickly moved away, standing at the other side of the room, and watched as the letter turned into ashes before her eyes. As the fire consumed his love for her, she allowed a single tear to slide down her cheek, and no more.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When Hessen had come back to check on his master back in the annex, he immediately noticed the untouched cake he had prepared earlier by the reception table.He had been initially surprised to receive an order from his master to buy some cake. And not just a random cake, one made by Arvis\u2019 finests bakers. But the thing was, Hessen knew the Duke was not fond of sweets. He does not eat such food pleasantly. So he had been certain it wasn\u2019t for the Duke himself, but for someone else.He took a deep breath, glancing one last time at the cake before knocking lightly on the duke\u2019s bedroom door. He heard a faint order, telling him he could come inside, before he entered the room. He was greeted with the sight of Matthias reading the morning paper.Hessen came to stand a few paces to his side.\u201cMaster, shall I set out the cake for you again?\u201d he asked politely, Matthias looked up through his brows, before looking back down to read the newspaper.\u201cThere will be no need for that.\u201d he replied coolly. When Hessen looked questioningly back at the table, Matthias flipped a page as he straightened out, \u201cGet rid of it at once.\u201d he commanded.Hessen knew that questioning him further would be deemed impolite, thus he bowed to his master, quietly dismissing himself and took the cake with him, leaving Matthias to his own devices.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThey were already a few weeks in on their arrangement, when Matthias finally saw Leyla through his car window.For the past few weeks, he had gotten acquainted with the sight of her lethargic state, always so expressionless and forlorn whenever it was just the two of them in the annex.Whenever she arrived, she would dutifully undress herself for him, and wait patiently until they began. She always looked too exhausted, but so afraid of him whenever he would approach her. But the woman he saw now was different.Outside from the confines of his room, she looked livelier than she\u2019d been. She dressed respectably, and had an amicable smile on her face as she walked with a group of women roughly among her age. Among them was the same woman she came with during their picnic in Arvis. Mrs. Grever, if he remembered correctly.Matthias couldn\u2019t help but narrow his eyes at her as he observed them. She looked thinner than she had been, but she no longer wore that haunted expression. She didn\u2019t carry a sullen and gloomy air around her peers, but rather a warm and sunny disposition. He could almost mistake her for a different woman.He found himself torn whether he should rejoice she wasn\u2019t acting so helplessly outside of their meetings, or insulted by how well she was hiding their affair. Nonetheless, Matthias could respect her boundaries. If she wants to act like his mistress, he\u2019ll let her. Same as if she wanted to act as though she\u2019s a commonplace whore, he\u2019d treat her as such too.She has no one to blame for it but herself.But despite that fact, he couldn\u2019t help but feel more affected whenever he would be forced to be rougher than usual with her. She took every insult, and every hurt he made her feel when they\u2019d be together quietly and resolutely indifferent. And it made him feel strange whenever the night would be over, and he\u2019d be left alone to his thoughts.Lately, he found himself at a loss on how to deal with her. Matthias still felt the deep satisfaction of seeing her wince in pain and flush in embarrassment, that much hadn\u2019t changed between them. In fact, it gave him a sense of pride that she wasn\u2019t entirely indifferent to him.What left him baffled was that whenever she would be on the verge of breaking down, as he\u2019d learned to read by the way her lips quivered and eyes began to water, she\u2019d take a deep breath, and no tears would come. It was as though she finally learned to calm herself down, cutting short the amusement she usually brought to him, leaving him with a bereft feeling.The audacity she has on making him feel so terrible!It brought him back to the time when he\u2019d nearly gone on a berserk streak, during spring last year. It was the first moment in his life he really felt that strong urge to kill. And that happened when he heard from his mother\u2019s lips that Leyla, his Leyla, was planning on tying the knot with Kyle Etman.A feeling that was often called upon whenever he\u2019d see her turn away from him. Not for the first time since they started their arrangement, did he wonder if that urge to kill was not directed at the poor doctor\u2019s son, but instead at Leyla herself?Despite how much she\u2019d irritate him these days though, Matthias can\u2019t deny he was still and utterly entertained by her. She drove him positively mad, invoking emotions he didn\u2019t even know he possessed.Never in his life did the sight of a quivering body give him such desire to give in to baser instincts he once brushed off as of no mere importance, until he saw her.\u201cUh, master?\u201d an attendant had carefully called out to him. Matthias glanced to his side, to see the car door already opened, only waiting for him to make his exit. It seemed like he had arrived.With a sigh, Matthias gracefully got out of his car, and headed to the lobby. When he arrived, he was suddenly greeted by a slew of company executives, rushing to welcome him.Just before he would fully enter the magnificent building lined with enormous rows of corinthian columns, Matthias subtly stopped in an angle that let him freely gaze on the sunlit streets outside.He glanced down at the streets, watching each person that walked by it, fully knowing Leyla wouldn\u2019t take that road. Once his lingering thoughts were appeased, he resumed his walk, schooling his expression back to a polite and calm one.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Everyday, Leyla would see her uncle off with a smile, watching solemnly at the heavy way he carried himself whenever he\u2019d go to work at the Arvis greenhouse. Carrying his large duffel bag down through their steps, and through the Platanus road, walking with his fellow gardeners looking equally serious made them look like soldiers heading off for war.Most of the greenhouse\u2019s structure has been restored to the way it was before the explosion, but the variety of plants that had been replanted had mostly died during the winter frost. Many of them were of the rare sorts, and couldn\u2019t be easily replaced due to the limited sources.And Leyla knew that her uncle would be the last to complain, for he\u2019d taken it as his duty to repair the greenhouse as payment for what the Herhardts had done for him.Leyla couldn\u2019t help the worry she had for him. Uncle Bill would work from dawn until dusk just so he could atone for the accident. It was taking its toll on him, she could tell, but she could also tell he was determined to see this through.\u201cLeyla! What are you doing out here?!\u201d Uncle Bill exclaimed as soon as he saw her when he\u2019d passed by the street\u2019s corner, \u201cIt\u2019s cold outside, you should head back!\u201d he implored her.Leyla only nodded at him, but still found herself unable to move to the warmth of their cabin as she watched him go. He\u2019d taken it as his responsibility to visit every known horticulturist, renowned botanical gardens, and aristocrats with a good number of plant collections to look for replacement of the plants they\u2019ve lost.But that could take weeks before he\u2019d return, and Leyla found herself wondering if she should take this opportunity to also leave and accompany him in his travels? She couldn\u2019t bear it if she must stay in Arvis for weeks on end alone in their cabin.But she feared if she were to request to do so, the Duke would tighten his grip on her, which would make it even more suspicious that something was going on between them.One by one, each family member that bid good bye to their respective gardener went back home, leaving Leyla as the last one to stay in the cold. She didn\u2019t know how long she stayed standing out there with nothing but the bitter chill as company, until the sound of an approaching car shook her out of reverie.Knowing that the Duke was in it, she hastily made her escape, wanting no contact from him aside from what was necessary. Unfortunately, a car would always prove to be faster than a human.It passed her by, creating a strong gust of wind in its rush. Leyla clasped her hands together, hoping it would not stop until it reached Arvis. Her chest pounded with anxiety as she remembered she cannot hide behind her uncle in his absence.But it wasn\u2019t a big deal, it wasn\u2019t like the Duke was responsible as to why he left after all.When she could no longer see the vehicle, Leyla immediately hurried back to her cabin, her thoughts growing frantic the longer she stayed outside. She locked the door behind her and double checked her windows, before removing her clothes and warmed herself thoroughly.She cleaned the house and ironed out her drying clothes, finding great comfort in her mundane tasks everyday she spent alone. It was the only reprieve she had, making her believe that soon enough Matthias would be nothing more than a stain in her memory.\u2018He would probably abandon me right before his marriage.\u2019She thought gratefully. She had just seen the Duke and his lady standing side by side with each other, looking like the most perfect pair to ever exist.Leyla\u2019s cheeks flushed as she went by unnoticed by the two of them, managing to arrive home unbothered. There was a strange feeling in her chest when she recalled the two of them together, but she mostly chalked it up to the cold weather back there.Just as she was about to sit by her desk, Phoebe fluttered by her window, earlier than she usually arrived. Once more, she carried with her a summon to the Duke. A deep rage erupted in her as she ripped into the note, and tossed it into the fire.Leyla proceeded to finish her duties, pushing his summons to the back of her mind. She went and fed their livestock, and washed the dishes she used. Once she found that all her chores were finished, she reluctantly got ready to leave, and locked her cabin before heading out to the annex, using the shadows once more as a cover of her leaving.One day, she hoped to be free of the Duke. She\u2019d move to the farthest city from him, bringing Uncle Bill with her. Maybe they\u2019d settle somewhere south, by the borders of Lovita, she heard it was nice there. Then she\u2019d take her uncle out on a trip, just the two of them. They\u2019d eat and laugh to their heart\u2019s content, watching birds as they lounged on a tropical island. Or perhaps they\u2019d vacation in snowy mountain peaks with majestic views.Then they\u2019d return, to their quaint little house, owned only by them, and not by the grace of their betters. She\u2019d decorate it just the way she\u2019d like, while her uncle would grow his own garden in their backyard and\u2026Her thoughts were abruptly cut off when the view of the annex came around, replacing her daydreams with dread as she drew closer to the looming building. She was already counting down the days she\u2019d be forced to spend with the man.She\u2019d lived long enough beneath the thumbs of her cruel relatives in her formative years, she could manage a few months with him. And thus, her pleasant disposition disappeared, casting a shadow over her features as she walked dutifully up the steps to meet with the duke.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The sun was yet to fully set when she\u2019d managed to arrive, making it difficult for her to move unnoticed. Yet even in the light of the fading sun, the annex didn\u2019t change much. She still stood in a massive bedroom, with a lit fireplace in preparation for the incoming darkness. The elegant furniture still looked the same, and Leyla was still waiting for him in complete nakedness.Matthias took his sweet time in reading through his papers, treating the sight of her naked body as one of his ornaments by now. He had grown busier these days, with the family business expanding their influence. That was largely thanks to the improved company system his grandfather, and by extension father, had made when they were still alive.He remembered them telling him that no head of the business could handle everything in the company, and thus ironed out every detail in delegating the tasks to their subordinates. It hadn\u2019t been implemented when they were still alive, but now Matthias was reaping it\u2019s benefits. Thus, he only needed to make the final decisions of major projects and developments that could make or break their company.Ever since he could read and write, he had been instilled with the sense of the best decision making. But the world around him was churning and turning rapidly every day, creating new problems and new circumstances that leave much to be determined.So he would meticulously analyze every report handed to him. The one he was currently reading was pertaining to mining rights, and oil fields located overseas. When he found himself reading too much, he would only look up, and appreciate her bare beauty presented to him, before going back to his task.If it were any other night, these walls would\u2019ve been filled with moans and pleasures from both him and Leyla. But for now, he was content in listening to the rhythmic cackling of the fire as he sifted through the reports.Leyla, on the other hand, grew irritable the longer she stared on the floor, waiting for him to have his way with her. She finally looked up, and saw that the night had fully settled in, replacing the orange hues of the setting sun.She didn\u2019t understand why he was ignoring her as though she was invisible today. Normally he\u2019d begin when she finished undressing for him, chasing after his pleasure. Now, she sat uselessly, and humiliated at how naked she was.She crossed her arms over her chest, now feeling the vestiges of shame return to her the longer the Duke would do nothing but give her a side glance before returning back to his papers. He was doing nothing but work the entire time she\u2019d been with him.Finally, he put down the thick document he\u2019d been reading, and both their eyes met briefly.She found herself shuddering when they locked eyes, and quickly averted her gaze away from him, looking resolutely on back on her toes. She heard him abruptly get up, a sense of relief washing over her, thinking it was time to start\u2026But then his steps grew fainter, and not louder, indicating he was leaving her in his room. Puzzled, Leyla looked up once more and stared at the door once it clicked shut. She could hear the muffled sounds of him speaking from behind the door. It sounded like he was talking business.From his tone, she could tell he was using his polite, and resolute, persona of a respectable Duke. She heard him quiet down, and him returning back into the room. When his door swung open, she found herself freezing in place as they met eyes once again.Leyla forgot she had been waiting for him to come back. But from what she\u2019d seen, he was hardly bothered by her. Matthias only gave her a once over, eyeing her with the look of an art curator admiring a masterpiece, before casually returning to his work.He casually leaned back in his chair, stretching his long legs to rest on top of his ottoman, before picking up the papers by the side of the table. Once more, the room was filled with the sound of ruffling papers, before the sound of a waltz seeped through the air.The music was coming from the phonograph in the reception room. Leyla couldn\u2019t help but grow more puzzled the more he kept his distance from her.Quietly, she reached out for her glasses, and put them back on. She glanced at him with a frown, eyeing the way he twirled his pen absentmindedly as he read through more of his work documents.As though sensing her eyes on him, Matthias looked up, curling up an eyebrow inquiringly at her. Even with her glasses, she couldn\u2019t read what his intentions for her were today.Feeling flustered, she quickly got up and grabbed her undergarments. If he wanted to watch her as he worked, well, she wouldn\u2019t let herself be more humiliated by participating in his perverse fancies. She hurriedly put them back on, sparing him glances from time to time, growing more flush by the second.She found herself more humiliated tonight! She had been calm the entire time she was naked, but she could only grow more frustrated with every clothing she put back on.By the time she was wholly dressed, Leyla was completely flushed and red in the face, looking at him with unbridled anger. Matthias only met her gaze calmly, the pen stopping from twirling was the only indication she had that he was paying attention to her.As the moonlight filtered through the half-opened curtain in the room, Leyla found herself unable to stay silent any longer. And so with a quivering voice, her words rang loudly throughout the stillness in the room as she asked\u2026\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSit.\u201d Matthias said to her in reply in a calm manner as he sat himself down on the table where food had been prepared for them. He gestured for her to take a seat at the remaining chair available, as the others had been conveniently taken away.Leyla remained standing in front of him, shooting him a scathing glare. She eyed the various food arranged in front of her, while Matthias sat at the head of the long table, the table that brought forth painful memories for her.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re close enough to share meals.\u201d she angrily said to him. Matthias only hummed as he unfolded the table napkin with a flick of his wrist.\u201cI thought you said you agreed to fulfill your role in our deal.\u201d\u201cI am!\u201d she protested, \u201cI\u2019m giving you everything you want from me!\u201dMatthias only sighed forlornly at her.\u201cYes, that I can\u2019t deny, but your skinny body makes it so painful to thrust into. I can hardly enjoy our time together.\u201d he told her nonchalantly. Leyla\u2019s breath hitched in response to his criticism, hot shame filled her as she listened to him.Matthias looked at her in a challenging manner, and Leyla couldn\u2019t help but wonder just how low does he see her? How can he just sit there, and spit those words at her!? He might as well just slap her in the face because that\u2019s what it felt like to her, hearing those words.Matthias picked up his wine-filled glass, cradling it between his fingers as he swirled the liquid around the clear glass. He always held himself in a graceful manner, which was a shame because his personality was equally repulsive.\u201cDo eat Leyla, you look starved to death.\u201d he pointed out, but Leyla remained standing. Matthias put his goblet down, and leaned back in his seat. \u201cDo you wish to die then?\u201d Still, she refused to answer.\u201cWell then, do as you please.\u201d Matthias shrugged, smiling brightly at her before clasping his hands together in a thinking pose, \u201cHmm, I wonder what I should put in your tombstone? Let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d he unclasped his hands, drumming one set of fingers onto the polished tabletop in deep thought.\u201cAh, I know! It should be something to commemorate our intimate moments together!\u201d he declared, \u201cHere lies Leyla Lewellin! The beloved mistress of Duke Herhardt!\u201d he announced with a flourish, looking at her with a twinkle in his eye, \u201cI quite like the thought of it, don\u2019t you?\u201dLeyla could only feel appalled.\u201cI\u2019ll have it carved into the most exquisite marble in existence, with big and clear letters, so that everyone can see you for what you really are\u2026\u201d he proceeded, \u201cSo don\u2019t worry, live or die, you\u2019ll always be with me.\u201dHe sounded so relaxed, so amused by the thought of toying with her even beyond the grave. Leyla\u2019s fists clenched so tightly, her knuckles turned white with rage towards the man, no beast, in front of her.She tried to forget the first night she ever laid with him, tried to scrub it from her memory, but it just kept coming back, over and over and over again. There was no escaping him wherever she went. No matter how much he\u2019d try to clean and redecorate the space, she\u2019d always find her mind trapped forever in that moment.The marks he\u2019d left her with had faded and healed over the course of time, but the wound she felt in her spirit remained salted and open.\u201cI\u2019m not going to die.\u201d Leyla finally responded, making a point to drag the chair across the floor loudly, and sat primly across from him, \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m planning to live well.\u201d They now sat across from each other.She won\u2019t let him bully her as easily as before anymore. She won\u2019t get scared, or flustered in front of him any longer. She won\u2019t allow herself to be affected by him anymore.\u201cI won\u2019t allow anyone by the likes of you to destroy my life.\u201d she declared, glaring at him hatefully as she reached out for the piece of bread nearby, She tore into the loaf, breaking it into pieces, lathering it with smooth butter before biting into it.She ate messily, hardly caring how she looked in front of him. He didn\u2019t deserve to see her in her best behavior. In fact, he might grow disgusted by her even, which was definitely something she wanted him to do.\u201cHmm, is that so?\u201d he asked her, as he ate at a moderate pace, slicing properly into his food as he chewed carefully on the piece of food he brought to his lips. He quirked up a smile, loving the way she fell for his goading. \u201cWhat a good girl for me.\u201dHe put his utensils down, and stood up. He carefully grabbed a spare goblet, and the wine bottle, pouring it\u2019s contents into the glass as he made his way gracefully to Leyla\u2019s side. He offered her the poured drink, to which she greedily gobbled up in one gulp. Matthias chuckled when the glass was emptied.\u201cWell, you\u2019ve certainly got quite the appetite today.\u201d he hummed with amusement, quickly refilling it, when Leyla just quickly downed it in one go once more. She was clearly acting out, Matthias knew that, which did manage to make her seem like the lowlife she was, but he could only be amused as he continued to watch her.She wiped the stray wine drops on the corner of her mouth with the back of her hand, before angrily stabbing into the food, shoveling in mouthfuls into her mouth as she chewed loudly. She didn\u2019t look that terrible to him, in fact, he rather preferred seeing her acting uncouth than the way she walked like a dead man.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Soon the wine bottle had emptied, and Leyla felt inebriated. She winced at the ringing in her ears, the sound of the music grating at her.\u201cTurn the music off,\u201d she slurred, glaring at the device blasting its sound at her. She could hear him humming right next to her\u2026\u201cJust listen,\u201d he said in a whisper, but it also sounded too loud. His voice echoed in her head. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d he finished, his voice bouncing back and forth.Leyla could only frown. She could make up the sounds, guessing it was a waltz, but the current section she was listening too was complicated and hit way too many notes for her to follow, it made her dizzier by the second\u2026Matthias slightly swayed along with the music. It was his and his canary\u2019s favorite part. Leyla seemed to be doing her best to follow the music but she only groaned in pain, complaining all the way how annoying it was.She grabbed a fork, sloppily stabbing through her last chunk of meat before stuffing it in her mouth, mangling the meat through her teeth. Matthias laughed out loud as he watched her eating through chubby cheeks.\u201cThen you have a worse taste of music compared to a bird!\u201d\u201cBird?\u201d she asked in a slurred voice, looking so confused why they were talking about a bird. Matthias wondered if she could finish her last bite, she\u2019d been chewing on it for some time now. Eventually, Leyla did manage to swallow it down, washing the meat down her throat with her last sip of wine as she shakily brought the goblet to her lips, some drops escaping and sliding down the corner of her lips in her haste.She was practically plastered, having drank more wine than she usually does, face all flushed red as a testament to her drunken state. Leyla regarded him seriously, eyes squinting in his direction before she hummed and turned to look at her empty plate as she slapped her lips together in search for more food.\u201cSo, when do you plan to get rid of me?\u201d she asked him in a brazen manner, resting both elbows on the table loudly, making some plates and utensils shake. Matthias only met her gaze, before smoothly setting down his own empty goblet.But his eyes held a serious look, despite the ease of his actions.\u201cWell?\u201d she prodded, \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve already had me, many ways in fact,\u201d she grumbled into her goblet, before finding it was empty. She frowned at it, turning it upside down as though it would produce more than just a drop. \u201cIt must be coming soon right?\u201d she asked with a smug smile.\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d Matthias finally answered. He was practical enough, after all, he couldn\u2019t be expected to forever keep her as his mistress. He wasn\u2019t that foolish.\u201cWell, do it quickly then!\u201d she demanded, and Matthias chuckled dryly.\u201cAnd what would you do the moment you\u2019re free of me?\u201d\u201cI already told you!\u201d she reminded him, frowning when her goblet was still empty. \u201cI\u2019ll live well!\u201d she placed her glass down, grabbing the table napkin to wipe her greasy fingers and saucy lips clean. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll definitely live well and free away from you!\u201d\u201cYou make it sound as though you\u2019re miserable with me.\u201dLeyla snorted as she chortled in amusement.\u201cWell, it\u2019s true.\u201d she told him, \u201cYou\u2019re the bane of my existence!\u201d\u201cRight, of course.\u201d Matthias replied in a steely manner as he watched her examine her sticky fingers with great interest. The firelight casted shadows on her face, and though he knew they were golden, her lashes casted a dark shadow over her eyes.Matthias kept watching Leyla as he leaned back in his chair. No matter how insatiable his current lust was towards Leyla, he knew it was bound to die down eventually once he\u2019s had his fill. And when that time came, it would be most prudent if she were to move away and live on with her life.But why does the thought of her leaving him fill him with such emptiness? It was an unfathomable feeling to him.He knew she was only stating facts, but it left him with a bitter taste. Suddenly, Leyla rose from her seat, wobbling as she struggled to stand upright.\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d he hissed at her, also rising from his seat.\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d she replied haughtily, and Matthias scowled in her reply. He charged at her within just a few long strides and grabbed her tightly by the wrists, making her cry out in pain as he pulled her closer to him.She squirmed in his grasps as he trapped her within her arms. She was spewing profanities, but Matthias only ignored her in favor of relishing the feel of her body writhing against his. Eventually, she grew tired and leaned against him without further resistance.He repositioned her in his arms, pressing her back flush to his chest as he buried his face on the nape of her neck. Instinctively, she leaned further to the side, granting him easy access as he greedily breathed in her soft, sweet scent. A fragrance he\u2019d known to only belong to her.He licked a strip up her neck, making Leyla hiss at the sudden contact. She could feel her pulse throbbing erratically as he continued with his ministrations. He proceeded to taste her skin, licking away the sheen of sweat that formed on her neck.Her body shook and shuddered as his warm breath hit her. She couldn\u2019t avoid him any longer. Heat was pooling in her gut, her blood rushing to warm her cheeks, spreading to her ears as her clothes rustled as he gripped onto them, hiking the hem of her blouse up before his hand sneaked right into it.Leyla let out a breathy moan, throwing her head back unconsciously to allow him more access when her eyes caught sight of the night outside the window. Not for the first time she wondered how late the night had gotten.His calloused palms moved all over her stomach, kneading them in that familiar manner, before they trailed up, cupping her bountiful breasts, and began to massage them roughly. She whined as he continued to fondle her, her eyes opening and looked down to watch him groping her breasts.It was a strange view to her, but so erotic in her drunken haze. She leaned her head back, eyes shutting as she basked in the sensation of his warm palms on her chest, his moist lips nibbling on her earlobes, his ragged breathing beside her ears.She vaguely remembered wishing it would all be over soon, but was snuffed out rather quickly by the flooding sensations around her. The music was still playing, still grating at her ears as Matthias thoroughly ravished her with his wandering hands and suckling lips.How she wanted to believe that her enjoyment of this was all because she was drunk. Her sanity slowly faded when his tongue was dancing gracefully on her body in a lustful waltz.\u201cMu-music,\u201d she gasped as he suckled on her neck, \u201cT-turn it off!\u201d she stuttered, wincing when the waltz played a sharp tune, \u201cMy head hurts!\u201d she hissed at him. But Matthias only sunk down, grabbing her by her small waist before he hefted her skirt up.He mouthed at her thighs, turning her to face him, before he looked up with sultry eyes.\u201cThe music is so beautiful, Leyla.\u201d he murmured against her skin, bunching her skirt up to her hips, \u201cIt\u2019s your fault for drinking too much tonight.\u201d and how could Leyla refute that fact? She could only grow angry at herself for letting herself go.He nosed against her clothed nether region, sucking against her sensitive nub. She threw her head back as the rough fabric rubbed against it, his warm tongue making her feel wet. Two warm and gentle fingers sneaked past the borders of her underwear, swiftly burying themselves to the hilt, making squelching sounds as they thrusted into her wetness.Leyla cried out, half in pleasure and half in shame, hazily pushing his hand out of her, but he was persistent, her legs buckling into his fingers as he curled them inside her, rubbing inside her with practiced ease.She brought her hands up to muffle her wanton sounds, but Matthias immediately grabbed them, pulling them away, encouraging her to make more sounds. Even the music couldn\u2019t drown out the way she let out breathy moans, gasping whenever he\u2019d rub against her sensitive nub.Her body convulsed, struggling to hold herself up on the table. Eventually, Matthias pulled his fingers out, leaving her with a bereft feeling of emptiness as she whined in protest. He cupped her cheek, smearing her face with her juices\u2026\u201cYou said you can live well without me,\u201d he whispered against her lips, \u201cYet you spread your legs so eagerly for me.\u201d He wiped her juices against her cheeks, making her sober up slightly as she tried to pull away from him, \u201cFeel how wet you are for me, Leyla.\u201d Leyla only shot him a glare\u2026\u201cSince you were so gracious as to give me what I want, let me give you what you truly desire.\u201d he teased her, carrying her to the closest sofa, easily trapping her beneath him. Leyla glared up at him.\u201cWhat I desire is to be away from you!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t really mean that, do you?\u201d he murmured, deft fingers swiftly unbuttoning her one by one, the fire slowly returning to Leyla\u2019s eyes, mirroring the shame and anger she was currently feeling.\u201cIf you were just going to sleep with me eventually, you should have started earlier!\u201d\u201cAh, but where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d he asked her, and Leyla couldn\u2019t help but scold herself for being so foolish as to hope he called for her to terminate their arrangement. He pulled her blouse off, tossing it to the sides, before he moved to undress her skirt\u2026\u201cAfter all, I want to see your distressed face.\u201d he admitted, carefully removing her glasses and setting them aside. He leaned down, spreading short kisses on her cheeks, showering her with them in every crevice he could reach. Their intimate kisses looked similar to birds rubbing their beaks against one another.\u00a0\u201cAfter all, that\u2019s what I most desire from you.\u201d he whispered against her ear.Leyla couldn\u2019t help the choked up sob that managed to escape her. She watched helplessly as his grin grew wider at the sight of her tears, and all she could feel in the end was the stabbing pain in her heart as she once again gave in to him so easily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLeyla vaguely remembered the rest of the events as she lay exhausted on the bed, all she knew was that they had been in the reception room when it started, and now they were back in the bedroom.Her breathing was ragged as she tried her best to catch more air. She didn\u2019t know what they were doing now, but she was vaguely aware that right now her wrists were bound together above her head. She hardly had any strength left in her to participate further in their activity, but she had enough left to shoot glares at the duke.Matthias on the other hand, only gave her a lethargic grin as he pulled tight the knot on his tie. Leyla gasped as she felt her bounds tighten, making her arch her back in a feeble attempt to get some blood circulation in her hands.\u201cUn-untie me this instant!\u201d she hissed, struggling to loosen up the tie. Matthias only hummed, hovering over her as he ran his fingers through her golden locks.\u201cShh, hold still, Leyla,\u201d he whispered next to her ear, \u201cTry to keep still for me.\u201d he murmured, breathing in the scent of her mixing with that musky scent of sex. He straightened up once more, one hand hefting her up the pillows as the other adjusted her wrists to a more comfortable position.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cKeep struggling and the knots will go tighter around you.\u201dMatthias got up from the bed, fetching the blanket that made its way to the floor, draping it all over her naked body, when she twisted away from him, causing it to fall once more on the floor. He frowned momentarily, before deciding that the warmth from the fireplace would be sufficient enough to keep Leyla warm on his bed, and thus smiled to himself in satisfaction.He climbed back on the bed, situating himself beside her, brushing back the locks that stuck to her face. She kept glaring up at him defiantly, and knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to get her to willingly take a bath with him. Which was a shame because he really wanted to bathe with her. But he had expected she wouldn\u2019t stay inebriated for long, the alcohol\u2019s effect having burned through her system by their strenuous activity.Eventually, he stood up once more, and headed straight for his bathroom. He was confident Leyla wouldn\u2019t be able to leave before he was through with her.He took his sweet time in savoring the hot water running down his skin, lathering his body up with soap as the water pelted his skin continuously. He then got out and dried himself off, before heading back to bed, where he found Leyla dropping off to sleep as she let herself rest against the soft sheets beneath her. Though his eyes narrowed when he saw the pillow he propped her back against had joined the blanket on the floor.With a sigh he came closer to her, swinging the towel over his shoulder as he loosened up the tie around her wrists, revealing reddened skin underneath, making him sigh in disappointment at her continued resistance.\u201cI told you to keep still.\u201d he admonished her. Through her sleep addled brain, Leyla only glared in response.\u201cWhy would I take the advice of a crazy person?\u201d she asked him incredulously, as Matthias proceeded to rub smoothing circles around her sore wrists. She felt disgusted by his touch, but she couldn\u2019t find it in herself to pull away from the delicate way he was touching her.Matthias repositioned her, hooking his arms underneath her back and under the knees. Leyla let herself surrender to his whims, closing her eyes in defense as she felt her body was no longer in her control.Once she was positioned in the middle of the bed, Matthias grabbed the wet cloth he had prepared beforehand at the bedside table and began using it to wipe the dried body fluids and sweat off of her.Leyla could feel the warm, moist roughness of towel scrubbing her all over. His hands trailed from her face, down to her chest, through the valley between her breasts, and then further downward past her lower abdomen.As much as she wanted to continue lying on the bed, and drift off to sleep, she fought to open her eyes to watch Matthias.He looked so calm as he was wiping her clean, but Leyla could see in his eyes how numb he was currently. He looked so different from when he had been busy thrusting into her a while ago. His hands were different before too. Gone was the lust he had when he\u2019d wrapped himself around her, which further embarrassed Leyla deep inside.Every time she thought she knew him, he\u2019d break character all of a sudden, confusing her as to who he really was. It was like he had a switch in his mind, letting him act differently from time to time, a switch he could control when he wanted to.Her eyes drifted close once more as her breathing calmed down to a gentle rhythm once more. Matthias\u2019 eyes drifted towards her, thinking to himself how much she resembled a marble sculpture with how pale she was.Matthias could see a trail of goosebumps up her arms and he pulled away, setting the wetted cloth down on the basin. He immediately took his robe off, draping in on top of her body. He then climbed behind her, pulling Leyla flush to his body, making her turn towards him in surprise.He thought she would squirm once more, but after holding her gaze, she eventually gave in, and let him pull her closer to him. He held her in his arms, watching, and waiting for the time her breathing evened out to soft, gentle breaths.Thinking her asleep, he pulled away from her, before taking a spot once more on his desk and reviewed the remaining documents for the rest of the evening. He had been at it for a while, when Leyla spoke up once more.\u201cI hate you.\u201dshe hissed softly towards him, her voice just above a whisper, but he could hear her words clearly as though she was shouting it right next to his ear. Matthias set the papers down, staring at the woman in his bed. Eventually, he got up and went back to his previous spot, gathering her in his arms once again.Drops of water from his hair tips cascaded down on to her pale cheeks as he stared her down. Her lips quivered as he continued to hold her gently.\u201cI really\u2026 hate you\u2026 so much!\u201d\u00a0she gritted teeth as she tried to stifle her tears. Matthias began to rub circles against the small of her back, while wiping the drops of water off with his free hand.Leyla never felt so much hate for one person until recently. She never hated anyone before.Not the mother who abandoned her, nor the relatives who beat and abused her. Not even Mrs. Etman, who made it her life\u2019s goal to remind Leyla just how insignificant she was. Yes, she held and let go of her hate of them because holding it in her heart only felt like lead\u2026It kept weighing her down, and would soon poison her.Because all her life, she wanted to live as free as a bird. And she worked hard to forgive them for what they did to her, but with Matthias, she found it very difficult to forgive him for the hurt he put her through. She can\u2019t help but hate him to her core.And suddenly, she wasn\u2019t so confident in living that proud and free life she once dreamed of. Her hatred of him weighed heavier than just a fist-full of lead. He felt like a boulder propped over her shoulders, and she feared she would hate him for the rest of her life\u2026And she wasn\u2019t willing to let go so easily.\u2018I hate you. I hate you! I HATE YOU!\u2019\u00a0She repeated like a mantra all over in her head, until she finally succumbed to sleep.Matthias, unaware of her hateful thoughts, only smiled down at her sleeping form, finally satisfied she was fully asleep. With a sigh, he got up from the bed, grabbed the documents and his pen as he went back to bed, opting to work on the bed instead of his usual desk.He regathered Leyla in his arms once again, who seemed to snuggle instinctively closer to his warm body. Matthias couldn\u2019t help but think that if Leyla wanted to continue living well, she need only stop wanting to live far from him.The reminder of how badly she wanted to be free of him left a sour taste in his mouth before he let out a dejected huff. His arms unconsciously tightened around her, and Leyla continued to rest snuggly against him.He had a myriad of things he wanted to give his beautiful mistress, things like a suitable house for her to comfortably live in, an opportunity to study in her dream university. He could even give her the life she dreamed about as she studied her favorite birds.All these were things he, Matthias von Herhardt, could give her and not that poor excuse of a doctor\u2019s son!\u2018And yet you continue to think you could live well without me?\u2019\u00a0he couldn\u2019t help but scoff at the thought. He gazed down at her, caressing her parted lips as she breathed in and out, softly snoring against him.These were the lips that slandered him, and yet despite the cold words she spewed at him, they remained warm and tender against the pad of his thumb.But Matthias had work remaining, and thus reluctantly pulled away, immersing himself back in the word of documents and business. Just having her near him, her smooth, rhythmic breathing as music, was enough for now.He found a different kind of contentment at feeling her warmth next to him, the way her scent flooded his nose. She was absolutely perfect for him, and he loved it! He knew by now, his desire for her would not wane easily.Finally, he got through the last of the documents, and set it on top of the growing pile by the bedside table next to him. When he glanced up, he caught sight of the snow, flickering against the dark as it fell against the windows.He took a trip down memory lane, his thoughts leading him back to when he first saw the snow this year. It was just after the first half of the charity ball, right when Leyla\u2019s chaotic play had just ended. They stood close by the frozen river, as the landscape began to be blanketed by white frost.And Leyla stood, so angelically in front of him beneath a lighted street lamp, haloing her golden locks. He remembered how she looked up in awe as she witnessed the first snow of the season too. The way her lips curved up sweetly at the sight of it falling gently on her face, kissing her skin the way he wanted to.\u201cLeyla,\u201d\u00a0he whispered out in longing. There was a certain stillness in the air, much like it did that first snow, but Leyla\u2019s tossing and turning eventually broke the placid atmosphere between them. The blanket slowly slid down her shoulders, revealing her naked torso as it pooled on her waist.He couldn\u2019t help but think of how prettily she\u2019d smile this time around too if she were awake to witness the snow fall once more.He couldn\u2019t find it in himself to wake her up, and ended up caressing her cheeks instead. Leyla nuzzled into his warm hand, sighing contentedly. Such small gesture, yet it filled Matthias with a different sense of satisfaction as he saw her willingly lean into him.He opted to stay still, deciding not to do anything about his robe sliding off her. She trembled as the cold began to seep into her body, seeking the warmest source she could find; which was him of course, and buried herself further into his embrace.Matthias breath hitched as she moved, not daring to make a move in fear of rousing her from her listless sleep. He could feel something blooming in his chest, something far different, yet closely the same from the lust he\u2019d grown accustomed to around her.It was a flutter, something fragile and miniscule. Much like a snowflake falling down from the skies, resting beautifully as it sticks against the window\u2019s glass.He quickly, yet gently wrapped both his arms around her as her body shivered, giving her more warmth as he pulled her impossibly closer. He ran a soothing palm up and down her back, rubbing some much needed warmth as she burrowed further into him in response.He could only lie awake next to her, holding her as though he was afraid she\u2019d pull away, and leaned into the plush cushion behind him, gently bringing her along with him. His eyes stared out at the swirling snowflakes, watching as they swayed with the wind and felt his eyes grow heavy by the second\u2026He leaned down, planting a ghost of a kiss on each of Leyla\u2019s shut eyelids, while his heart echoed her name over and over like a velvety mellow tune.Leyla\u2026.Leyla\u2026.My Leyla\u2026.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*There was a screeching in the station, and the sound of pressure being relieved as the night train entered the Carlsbar Central Station. It was just before the breaking of dawn, the day\u2019s winter sun not yet up in the skies.There was a certain muteness in the air as people hurriedly rushed out of the train, equipped with their belongings as they huddled in on themselves, wearing fatigue in their expressions as they rubbed the sleep from their eyes. The platform grew more lively as more and more people piled out, while the sparse people that already were in the station met to greet their returning loved ones.Amongst the passengers was Kyle Etman, right in the middle of the bustling crowd. He had come without any notice he was arriving, and thus had no one to greet him. Even Mr. and Mrs. Etman was unaware of his plans of returning instead of traveling to the southern countries of the continent.He still received no reply from Leyla, even after his last heartfelt letter to her. He poured all his heart and soul into every word, and so when he received no letters from her in response, his initial thought was it was time to give up.Which was why he had accepted his father\u2019s suggestion of traveling south. And yet, he changed his mind at the last minute, changing his tickets to take him back home instead of further away.Kyle didn\u2019t know why he wanted to return at first, but the moment he caught sight of them entering Ratz\u2019s borders, something clicked inside him, making everything make sense.He knew now why he wanted to return.He knew where he wanted to go.There was a sense of foreboding building in him as he grew closer and closer to home. It wasn\u2019t like Leyla to reject him without a proper goodbye. He knew her that much at least, and so he worried something must have happened to her.It might just be his desperation blowing everything out of proportion, and maybe she was just fine, but he needed to see her.He wanted to see her.As the crowd slowly died down around him, Kyle found himself moving once more, hauling his enormous trunk behind him as he walked out of the station alone with a determined look in his eye.As he stepped out of the station, he was met with the sight of his hometown covered in snow, everywhere he looked, he could see blankets of white surrounding him. Snow continued to fall, piling on his shoulders the longer he stood still, dancing around him.He was a different man from when he left. He\u2019d grown over the time he parted with Leyla.\u201cLeyla\u2026\u201d he whispered like a prayer, her name flowing desperately out of him as wisps of white puffs flitted around him.Just the thought of her gave a twisted feeling over his heart, a trepidation washing over him at the thought of seeing her for the first time since they broke it off. His knuckles turned white, as his grip on his trunk tightened.[ I will love and cherish you for as long as you will allow it. I swear that no harm shall come to you again, whether by another\u2019s hand or mine.]Those were his words for her. A sincere confession as he wrote out to her, hoping his words would reach her heart as well. He swore if Leyla even gave an inch of a chance, he\u2019d take it as a mile, giving her everything he\u2019d ever promised.[I\u2019ll come to you at once! We can leave Arvis together, and find our happy place in this world!]With that final thought, he found the strength to move forward once more and braved the frosty path on the way to his happiness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His eyes fluttered open, wincing at the bright light before it landed on the sight of his bird, merrily fluttering inside it\u2019s elaborate cage as it sang merrily.It seemed to be happy today, Matthias noted to himself, and continued watching it for sometime, content on laying on his stomach for the time being. It flew down, landing by its water bowl, dipping it\u2019s beak on to the water slightly, before dipping down once more, submerging and reemerging it\u2019s entire body this time.It shook as it perched back on the bowl\u2019s ledge, scattering rivlets of water. Matthias felt himself smirk, sitting up before leaning his back against the headboard. Once it was done bathing itself, the canary began to groom itself, spreading its little wings, nosing at its feathers with its beak.He can\u2019t help but be reminded of his woman.Soon, the bird was done, and fluttered back up to its flush nest, when Matthias decided it was time for him to get up. He picked up the bell from his bedside table, ringing it to summon Hessen inside.Not a moment later, his butler came in, carrying a silver tray with coffee, and the day\u2019s mail. Matthias sat on his desk, waiting for Hessen to finish setting the coffee down. The butler then proceeded to inform him of the progress in their preparations for the crown prince\u2019s visit with his wife, along with the list of guests they expect to host.\u201cI was also informed that Lady Brandt would be arriving this afternoon, master.\u201d Hessen added, the empty tray tucked neatly at his side. Matthias took a sip of his coffee, nodding along with the new piece of information.\u201cI see,\u201d he hummed.\u201cAlso, the Marquis Lindman sent word he\u2019d arrive no sooner than tomorrow afternoon. Since I know the master would be absent in the next few days, I took the initiative of informing both families in advance that you\u2019d be unable to greet them personally.\u201d Hessen helpfully supplied.Matthias gave him an appreciative smile to be polite as he opened up the morning\u2019s newspaper. Him, the crown prince, and even Riette were of the same age, Matthias idly thought, it wouldn\u2019t be strange to know that they were closer compared to the other dukes and lords in the country.Subsequently, Claudine was also one of the few ladies who grew close with the crowned princess. Which also meant she would be spending more time in Arvis during the royal couple\u2019s visit.\u201cMaster, shall I start preparing for your departure? If you leave around ten o\u2019 clock, you\u2019ll be on time to board your train.\u201d Hessen suggested, and Matthias nodded.\u201cWe shall,\u201d Matthias replied, giving him another polite smile. Hessen bowed his head respectfully at his master, backing out a few steps before moving aside to let Matthias walk ahead of him.With the crowned prince\u2019s upcoming visit, Matthias would have to quickly settle his business affairs in the capital city, which in turn made his schedule all the more hectic before the royal couple\u2019s arrival.After bathing, Matthias was quickly aided by Hessen, and was suited up promptly as he continued on with his usual calm demeanor.News of Kyle Etman\u2019s return spread like wildfire in Arvis, reaching him in less than a day of the doctor\u2019s son\u2019s arrival. It wasn\u2019t even through a formal relaying of information, but through the murmurs of his servants he discovered Kyle had returned.He couldn\u2019t help but scoff to himself at the thought, Kyle\u2019s return leaving a nasty taste in him. He didn\u2019t know, nor cared why Kyle chose to return to Arvis now. It didn\u2019t bother him even if Kyle and Leyla had lingering feelings for one another.After all, Leyla was undeniably his already. And it was because of that, he knew Leyla would never accept Kyle back, even if he groveled and poured his heart out to his mistress. He was confident in leaving Leyla behind.Just as the last of his buttons clicked to a close, Matthias\u2019 mouth curled upwards in a subtle smirk. Hessen assisted him in buttoning up his sleeves, pinning an elaborate cufflink on them, making him look all the more regal.As for Leyla, well, he did admire her chivalrous morals, no matter how foolish they were in his opinion. Which was why he trusted that having laid claim on her was the wisest action he could take.And so as he left his room, he reached a single conclusion. There was no further need for him to think about Kyle Etman, in fact, he would sooner wipe his existence off his mind, and planned to enjoy the rest of his trip away.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*There was an onslaught of conversation amongst the servants in Arvis as they gathered around the reception room. Despite the hectic schedule they incurred from the royal couple\u2019s pending visit, they couldn\u2019t help but dilly-dally as they gossiped about Kyle and Leyla\u2019s reunion.\u201cBut is it really because of Leyla?\u201d\u201cDo you think they\u2019re together again?\u201d\u201cSurely there must be another reason he\u2019s back in Arvis.\u201d\u201cI heard he was supposed to be traveling the southern continent.\u201d\u201cSo it really must be Leyla! Oh I knew they wouldn\u2019t split so easily!\u201d\u201cYes, especially since they\u2019ve been together so long! They got along splendidly since their childhood after all.\u201d\u201cAh, what a match-made in heaven!\u201dThere were more swooning and sighing as they all fantasized about what would happen between the past lovebirds. Most were gunning for the fact they\u2019d be back together as soon as they saw one another again.After all, they\u2019ve watched both of them grow, and seen how the two grew closer through many years. At this point it wasn\u2019t just a simple gossip, but well-wishes and hopeful thinking among the servants.\u201cHmm, perhaps it\u2019s time I visit Leyla once more later.\u201d Mrs. Mona, one of the kitchen\u2019s chefs, said to herself softly as she stirred a simmering soup. Her ability to cook was only rivaled by her ability to sniff out a gossip or two and spread it, she should hardly be behind the news!Yes, with Mr. Remmer not home, it was only expected she\u2019d be a little worried for Leyla, and how she\u2019s faring on her own. Perhaps she should bring along some food as well for the girl.\u201cYes, it\u2019ll also give me a piece of mind to see her with my own eyes.\u201d she further hummed to herself, and began to continue her chores for the day.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla spent the rest of her day in her cabin, doing nothing and staring into space. The sky grew darker, but Leyla couldn\u2019t find it in herself to continue being productive as the sun began to sink in the clouds.\u201cLeyla!\u201d a familiar voice called out for her, suddenly breaking the silence. Leyla jolted in surprise, and blinked back into focus, \u201cLeyla are you home?!\u201dIt was Mrs. Mona. She was right in front of their yard, bellowing out her name.\u201cY-yes I am, Mrs. Mona!\u201d she hastily replied. Leyla hurriedly fixed her appearance, before swinging open the door to greet her nosy neighbor. Mrs. Mona beamed at the sight of her, and they exchanged pleasantries before Leyla invited her inside.\u201cOh thank you dear!\u201d\u201cShall I get you some tea?\u201d\u201cOh that would be lovely, thank you.\u201d Leyla nodded, letting Mrs. Mona sit by one of the kitchen stools as she busied herself in heating water for some tea. Just as she finished, Mrs. Mona began to speak up.\u201cAre you alright dear? You look rather pale.\u201d she worried as she carefully looked over Leyla\u2019s general appearance. Leyla only laughed embarrassingly, nodding in a placating manner.\u201cI\u2019m just alright Mrs. Mona.\u201d she replied, smiling politely at her, but Mrs. Mona hardly looked convinced. \u201cI just haven\u2019t been sleeping well.\u201d she added, knowing she had to give Mrs. Mona a little something to leave her be. It was just in her neighbor\u2019s nature to meddle in things after all.\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d Mrs. Mona frowned, \u201cAh, have you been up studying again? While it\u2019s good to learn, it\u2019s also good to know when to rest.\u201d she gently admonished, sounding so sure she was right.Leyla felt no need to correct her.\u201cAh, yes, I brought you some cake!\u201d Mrs. Mona announced, and made to prepare some slices from them. Leyla got up along with her, and began to fix both of them with some tea when the kettle began to whistle.Mrs. Mona cut the cake into equal slices, bringing out two plates and forks as she set one slice on them a piece, and placed them beside their cups of brewed tea.\u201cYou should really learn to take better care of yourself Leyla, just think of how terrible Mr. Remmer would feel if he finds you neglecting yourself.\u201d she continued to admonish her. \u201cBy the way, when will he be returning?\u201d\u201cAh, I just had a word from him saying he won\u2019t be back in fifteen days.\u201d\u201cOh well, I guess that makes sense,\u201d Mrs. Mona hummed, taking a dainty sip of her tea, before setting it back down, \u201cIt must be difficult for him to find all those rare and precious plants in need of replacing. Still, it was so kind for the duke to have dropped the charges, and let him work in Arvis again.\u201d she praised.\u201cY-yes\u2026\u201d Leyla smiled stiffly, \u201cHow kind indeed.\u201d\u201cHe truly is one of a kind you know,\u201d Mrs. Mona proceeded, completely oblivious to the discomfort of Leyla, \u201cIf it were any other aristocrat, they would have left Mr. Remmer to rot in jail!\u201dLeyla opted to take a bite out of the cake instead, not wanting to contribute such false praise for the duke. The cake tasted like nothing in her mouth as she continued to listen to Mrs. Mona speak.And so Mrs. Mona spoke, with Leyla occasionally making agreeing sounds and hums as though she was listening attentively to her. She mentioned something about the crowned prince and his wife arriving sometime next week, and the grand party Arvis would be celebrating in their honor!It was really a life of luxury that Leyla hardly knew anything, nor cared about.\u201cOh yes,\u201d Mrs. Mona paused, clearing her throat as she looked nervously over Leyla, \u201cDid you hear about Kyle? He\u2019s just returned to Arvis.\u201d\u201cAh,\u201d Leyla piped up softly, feeling a little more at ease with the change of subject, \u201cYes, I did hear about that.\u201d she replied, smiling at Mrs. Mona, yet it did not reach her eyes.\u201cWell, I suppose that is a given, what with the whole place talking about it!\u201d Mrs. Mona chuckled nervously, drumming her fingers against her cooled cup of tea, \u201cHave you had the chance to welcome him back?\u201d she asked curiously, finally getting to the point of her current visit.\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d Leyla answered with an air of finality, but Mrs. Mona wasn\u2019t known as a nosy person because she respected boundaries\u2026\u201cWell, personally, if I were you, I\u2019d have eloped with Kyle by now.\u201d Mrs. Mona carelessly remarked, and Leyla stared at her with a foreign look on her face. \u201cSure Mrs. Etman will be humiliated if that were to happen, but it\u2019s clear the boy can\u2019t be without you, so wouldn\u2019t it be in both of your best interests to just run away from here?\u201dLeyla pressed her lips into a thin line before giving her another stiffened smile.\u201cMrs. Mona, Kyle and I no longer have that kind of relationship.\u201d she calmly reminded, but Mrs. Mona only scoffed.\u201cOf course I know that! But my point is, that he most likely returned here for you. The least you could do is actually consider still being with him.\u201d she insisted, \u201cIf it were any other man I would be advising against it, but\u2026\u201d she trailed off,\u00a0 looking at Leyla who was intently staring at her own cup of cold tea.Mrs. Mona reached out, and grasped her hand, squeezing it in a comforting manner.\u201cIt\u2019s Kyle, Leyla, and we both know that Kyle is different from the rest of the men in this world.\u201d It was the best she could do, because how could she really describe Kyle? He just is, wholly himself, and that was his best description.Mrs. Mona finally let her hand go, but still did not move to leave her alone.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve talked it over with Mr. Remmer before,\u201d she continued, \u201cI asked him whether it was the right thing to do, both of you breaking up the way you did.\u201dLeyla wanted to move on from this topic already, but Mrs. Mona was relentless. And so she resolved to just sit across from her in silence, plastering a fake smile on her face. After all, she had nothing more to say in this matter.She\u2019s made her bed, and she\u2019d lie in it.She\u2019d broken it off with Kyle, and now he\u2019s returned for her, or so everyone says. She suspects it has an ounce of truth, after all, she\u2019s read his letters. But how could she just go back to the way they were?Even if she wanted to, there was no way she would ever drag Kyle into the mess she found herself in. She had already agreed to be the Duke\u2019s mistress. And there was no place for a woman like her on Kyle\u2019s side.There was a sudden pang in her heart as though it was being ripped apart in two! Her fists clenched in her lap, hidden from Mrs. Mona\u2019s view, as it\u2019s knuckles turned white. It wasn\u2019t long before the growing pain in her heart was replaced by her deep hatred in one Matthias von Herhardt.\u201cOh silly me, look at the time!\u201d Mrs. Mona gasped in surprise, \u201cAll I did was talk and talk and talk, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d she apologized, \u201cWell, I better be going now.\u201dBoth women stood up as Leyla escorted Mrs. Mona out the cabin, thanking her for both her visit and the cake. Suddenly Mrs. Mona paused, and turned back towards her once more.\u201cOh I almost forgot, I heard Lady Brandt would be coming, so everything\u2019s just getting busier by the second!\u201d she sighed in complaint, \u201cAnyway, she\u2019s going to be staying in Arvis this entire time, just until the crowned prince and his wife leaves.\u201dShe proceeded to complain how she couldn\u2019t see the relationship between the Duke and Lady Brandy working out long-term, if the way they kept delaying their wedding was of any indication.Leyla only politely nodded along, waiting for her to finally leave. With one last goodbye, Mrs. Mona finally walked away, leaving Leyla alone in the frosty white forest, and silence enveloped her once again.There was a strange sensation coming over her at the mention of Claudine. It made her throat feel dry, as she struggled to keep her calm composure. And so, she numbly went back inside her cabin, and tried to finish the cake she had begun eating.Truthfully, she had no appetite, but she hadn\u2019t been eating enough either. She didn\u2019t want to worry her uncle by the time he arrived back home, he\u2019d be so exhausted by then. She couldn\u2019t, mustn\u2019t add up to his worries.Oh how she really loathed that man. Who did he think he was?! Making her lose her faculties at the mere thought of him?!She swallowed down the rest of the cake, washing it down her throat with the cold tea, before piling more of the food Mrs. Mona brought onto her plate.She just kept eating, and drinking; one bite, swallow, drink and then repeat until all that\u2019s left was an empty plate. Memories of how the duke insulted how skinny she was made feelings of shame and humiliation resurface.She\u2019d bear it anyway. She wanted to live a normal life after this, and she\u2019d make sure of it. She needed only to endure for a little while.She washed the dishes, did her chores, and then continued to read her book, slowly clearing her mind of all the negativity piling over her in the last few weeks.On the bright side, the Duke was going away, leaving for the capital and wouldn\u2019t be back until the weekend. It gave Leyla some room to breathe, though she was disappointed the only reason she was given such freedom was because he wouldn\u2019t be around.\u2018When will this nightmare end?\u2019\u00a0she wondered. She snapped her book shut, and looked around. All she could see was nothing but loneliness\u2026She couldn\u2019t help but feel as though the walls were closing in on her. Her breathing grew ragged, and echoes of flesh slapping and guttural moans circled in her mind\u2026She could feel Matthias\u2019 hands all over her..,She needed to get away! She couldn\u2019t stand it anymore!Hurriedly, she ran out of her cabin, grabbing the bare minimum to keep herself warm in the chilled weather. She grabbed her bicycle and began to pedal, aiming for nowhere, just as far away from the confines of her mind\u2019s prison!She sped through the streets, before pausing in front of the library. Thankfully she had the foresight to bring some books and other necessities, and went in to return them. Her next stop was by the grocery store, and went on to buy things she needed for cleaning like powdered soap and brushes.She even made time to stop at a nearby cafe to drink some sweet hot chocolate, feeling the warmth seeping back into her body. She breathed in the cold winter air, smiling softly to herself as she began to relax\u2026Up until she met the eyes of the one person she wanted to avoid most, next to the Duke.\u201cLeyla\u2026\u201d his warm voice breathed out her name. It sounded so good to hear, yet equally mortifying as well.Everything seemed to stand still as Leyla stared at him in shock and the world deafened to a silence around her. It was really him\u2026Right in front of her, stood no one else but Kyle Etman himself, who was smiling beaming brightly at her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kyle was too happy to see her in front of him after a long time, while Leyla was too shocked and torn about how she should feel being confronted by him.\u201cI heard about what happened with Uncle Bill.\u201d Kyle finally spoke, breaking the tense silence between them. Leyla gulped, and nodded hesitantly\u2026\u201cI see.\u201d she replied softly before averting her gaze back down on the table she sat at. Kyle stared at her for a moment, awkwardly standing in the cafe, before he took the seat across from her. He noticed how Leyla tried to subtly look away from him, but he knew her too well.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d he continued, finally managing to get her to look at him. Leyla stared at him inquiringly, asking what he was apologizing for behind the rim of her glasses. Somehow the sight of her looking like that gave him a sense of familiarity he didn\u2019t know he missed so much in his time away.\u201cI should have been here sooner, perhaps I could have helped ease some of your burdens.\u201d he elaborated, rubbing his palms on his lap in a nervous tic, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what had happened until recently, and like an idiot I just kept sending you letters, probably irritating you with how many they were.\u201d he awkwardly laughed at himself, but Leyla could hardly manage a smile.\u201cIt was no fault of yours Kyle, nor anyone.\u201d Leyla pointed out to him, \u201cBesides, I wouldn\u2019t expect you to know what had happened since it wasn\u2019t anything to do with you. It was mine and uncle\u2019s problem after all.\u201d she told him resolutely, \u201cBesides, it\u2019s all resolved now. So there\u2019s\u00a0 no further need for you to worry.\u201dKyle nodded mutely, nodding along as he wetted his lips, another nervous tic of his.\u201cSo\u2026 so everything\u2019s good now? You and Uncle Bill are fine?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she smiled minutely, \u201cIn fact he\u2019s working on restoring the greenhouse again, he\u2019s been very ecstatic.\u201d she tried to say, but she knew her uncle was also having a hard time repaying a\u00a0debt\u00a0that was already paid.Leyla pulled on the sleeves of her sweater, eyes looking back down as she once more avoided his gaze. Kyle observed her for a while, noting how sickly she looked right now. She wasn\u2019t like this when he left.\u201cYou can always ask me for help Leyla,\u201d he softly reminded her, \u201cI\u2019d do everything I can to help you, I hope you know that.\u201dLeyla\u2019s jaw clenched as she listened to him.\u201cWhy do you keep saying that?\u201d she asked, coming out harshly than she intended. Her eyes held a certain contempt as she stared back at him. Kyle only held her gaze.\u201cBecause I know you\u2019re not doing well Leyla.\u201d he answered plainly. Leyla took some deep breaths as she tried to calm herself down. \u201cYou forget I know you Leyla,\u201d he explained, \u201cJust because we\u2019re no longer together, doesn\u2019t mean I care any less for you.\u201dNow that he\u2019d seen her, he\u2019s more assured now that something did, or was happening with Leyla. Every minute he\u2019s spent with her today was proof she was acting less and less like how she was.Leyla grew up in an unideal environment, but when she met Bill, the old gardener had showered her with the best love he could give. Though sometimes, he will fall short in identifying the subtlest of hints when it comes to Leyla\u2019s thoughts and feelings. And Kyle knew that no matter how tired or hurt she was, her pride would never allow herself to seek out help.The moment Kyle had gotten to know Leyla, how she really was, he\u2019d formed the habit of looking out for these subtle hints. Anything that would help him understand Leyla better since they were children. But it didn\u2019t mean he knew everything about her. After all, Leyla also got better over time hiding her feelings from everyone around her.It didn\u2019t mean his efforts were entirely in vain though, because he could sense something was wrong. He just couldn\u2019t tell what it was.\u201cSo why haven\u2019t you been replying to my letters?\u201d he finally asked, moving onto what he hoped was an easier question to answer for her. Leyla held her chin higher, even though she still refused to look directly at him.\u201cPeople change Kyle,\u201d she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to reply to your letters.\u201d\u201cYes, but why?\u201d he insisted. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like you!\u201d Leyla only sighed out and shook her head.\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to.\u201d she said with an air of finality, \u201cAnd just because it isn\u2019t like me from before doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t be like that now. I\u2019ve changed, Kyle, it\u2019s time to accept that.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d Kyle asked with disbelief, \u201cYou\u2019ve changed this much in such a short time?\u201dSilence reigned between them once more, before Leyla finally replied.\u201cIt felt so much longer for me,\u201d she admitted, \u201cSo I\u2019m telling you now, we can never go back to how we were before.\u201d She then moved to leave the cafe, finally done with this conversation.\u201cLeyla!\u201d Kyle called out desperately, but she whirled around in anger, as she looked back at him.\u201cI didn\u2019t answer you Kyle!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cThat should have been enough of an answer to you as to how I really feel. We\u2019re done. Don\u2019t expect anything from me anymore because I\u2019m through with it, and I don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d she finished in a calmer voice.She didn\u2019t want to, but she had to do this.\u201cI just don\u2019t feel the same as you anymore Kyle, our time apart has proven that to me.\u201d she finally said, \u201cEven if your mother were to miraculously agree to our union, I don\u2019t want to. Not anymore. In fact, I can\u2019t even bear the thought of moving away and marrying anyone.\u201dEvery word was like a knife to his heart, and Leyla just kept adding to it.\u201cI kept quiet because I wanted you to hold on to the beautiful times we\u2019ve had together, but you forced my hand here.\u201d Leyla continued, \u201cI loathe you, Kyle.\u201dKyle shook his head in denial as he stared up at her, while only Leyla nodded to affirm her words to him.\u201cN-no, y-you don\u2019t mean that\u2026\u201d\u201cI do. And that\u2019s my only answer to you.\u201d she finished, \u201cSo please, let this be the last time we see each other again. I don\u2019t want to hear about your feelings for me, I don\u2019t want to hear other people wishing we\u2019re back together because I\u2019m sick of it all!\u201d she sighed desperately. \u201cGive me peace Kyle.\u201d she pleaded.Kyle sat there stupefied. What had started out like a dream reunion ended up in a nightmare, only it wasn\u2019t a nightmare. It was real. When he couldn\u2019t form a reply, Leyla busied herself into gathering her belongings, eager to get away from him.She then turned and left, pushing open the cafe\u2019s doors as it chimed open, knocking Kyle out of his reverie\u2026\u201cNo, Leyla, wait!\u201d he called out, hastily packing up his own things as he rushed after her. He might have tripped a couple of times to catch up to her, but he\u2019d just managed to hold onto her shoulder right before she mounted her bike\u2026And when she turned to look back at him, Kyle found himself looking at her red rimmed eyes. She looked as though she was ready to cry any second. And Kyle found himself speechless once more\u2026How could he force her right now? She looked as if she was about to fall into a million pieces if he even dared push through her walls. He couldn\u2019t do that to her. He respected her too much for that. And so he kept his mouth shut, and allowed Leyla to push him away, slapping his touch off of her.He stood there in the middle of the road, watching as she hastily ran away from him, and stayed in his spot long after she\u2019d disappeared.Something really was wrong, and she was suffering for it. No matter what it was, he\u2019d do everything in his power to save her.Even if it\u2019s the last thing he would do.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When Riette came with Claudine to look at the on-going reconstruction of the greenhouse, he couldn\u2019t help but let out a low whistle at the sight of it. He looked around in awe, absolutely gobsmacked at just how much work needed to be done.\u201cWow, it really is\u00a0such\u00a0a big mess!\u201d he exclaimed, letting out an amazed chuckle or two as he continued to look around. Claudine shot him an unamused glare, but he only disregarded it, already used to her disappointment.\u201cSure laugh it up, it\u2019s not like it wasn\u2019t a tragic accident\u2026 oh wait,\u201d Claudine hummed, eyeing him dryly. \u201cIt actually was. Look at that, I didn\u2019t know you could be so heartless.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m heartless,\u201d Riette protested, \u201cI\u2019m just so amazed at how much damage had been done!\u201d he exclaimed, waving his arms towards the whole greenhouse as though to emphasize the scale of it, \u201cI mean, I never expected anything like this to ever happen in Arvis, to be honest.\u201dTruly the glaring difference from his last visit was prominent. The last time he\u2019d been in the greenhouse, it had been such splendor, filled with the most exquisite plants, all arranged perfectly to showcase their beauty. It had been a paradise on earth.But now it was in ruins, much like the aftermath of a war. The plants were dug up, soil was scattered all over the ground, and a large pile of debris was just off to the side while there was continuing hammering and chopping sounds all over.\u201cI still can\u2019t believe Matthias dropped all the charges.\u201d Riette commented, \u201cI mean the damage is massive! And he let him return back to work!\u201d he added offhandedly, \u201cAh, what prestige it must be to be one of the country\u2019s most influential men.\u201d\u201cHmm, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the prestige or the mistress\u2019 influence.\u201d Claudine whispered to him, taking great care to lower her voice in case of any eavesdropper. She bit her lip, if only to prevent more words spilling out of her.Riette gasped from beside her quietly, looking at her in shock.\u201cI didn\u2019t know the great Lady Brandt thought of it that way. Why do you say such things?\u201d Riette asked her worriedly, and Claudine felt some of the tension leave her as she sighed out in resignation.\u201cNothing, there wasn\u2019t any reason Riette, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she apologized, \u201cIt was just a slip of the mind.\u201d she backtracked, and Riette lightly held onto her elbow, and gently steered her to face him.\u201cHey, it\u2019s alright,\u201d he placated, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to apologize, okay?\u201d he smiled down at her gently, before it turned into a roguish grin, \u201cBesides, I think the jealous look quite suits you, my Lady.\u201d he teased, and Claudine scoffed, barking out a short laugh as she turned away from him.\u201cMe? Jealous? As if!\u201dThey exchanged a few more laughs before a comfortable silence settled between them as they continued to walk within the greenhouse. This was why she wanted to be here with Riette, the reason why she invited him over.She knew he could comfort her like no one else. She could whine and complain endlessly in front of him, and he\u2019d distract her with a joke or two, which was just what she needed. There was a comfort in Riette\u2019s mischievousness.They headed towards the small space just a few spaces away from the greenhouse where served tea was awaiting them. Already they could hear the boisterous laughter and loud chatter from the gathering family of the Herhardt house, despite its current head being away on business.And just like that, a switch was slipped, and they were back to acting like the Duke\u2019s fiance and his cousin respectively, and nothing more.Over the course of the gathering, Claudine found herself looking over at Riette, locking gazes from time to time. He even winked at her once in a teasing way when he had been sure no one was paying attention to him. And not for the first time she wondered if she should have chosen him instead of the Duke.However she quickly brushed the thought aside, having already reached the logical answer many times in her solitude. Her parents\u2019 decision on making her pursue the life of a Duchess Herhardt was better than choosing the life of a Marquise Lindman.With how fast the world changed around them, it was no secret the social class where aristocrats belonged suffered the worst when it came to change. The Brandt Household, one of the empire\u2019s main sources of finance, knew that better than anyone. She might not have been trained officially because she was no son, but she was a natural when it came to such analysis.Which was why she went with Matthias.She had poured over her list of suitors, weighing each and everyone of the nobles she had the chance to be with, the Herhardt house was the one she knew for certain would survive no matter what challenge the times would throw at them. And as they creeped into a new era, Claudine wanted to be part of that story.It may not end up in history books, but the house\u2019s glory would forever be etched into society.\u201cI just hope the greenhouse could be fully restored in time for Claudine\u2019s wedding.\u201d a lady on the table remarked, effectively steering the rest of the conversation on the topic of their upcoming nuptials.They had decided to hold the ceremony by next summer, and neither of them seemed to be changing their minds any time soon, with or without the greenhouse.Claudine occasionally joined in on the conversation, looking down from time to time to appear meek and polite while she smiled brightly and politely to those addressing her. When she caught sight of Riette\u2019s soft brown eyes smiling at her.She couldn\u2019t help the warm feeling she had at the sight of him. Even when they were children, she liked seeing Riette\u2026But she chose Matthias already, and she didn\u2019t want to change her mind, not now. Not when she reached this far.Indeed, there was no room for regrets now, Claudine thought to herself. She couldn\u2019t, not when everything was exactly as how she planned her life would be. A life filled with success, paid in full price with her happiness.The topic of her wedding soon shifted towards the possibility of Riette marrying. Claudine knew that he would be expected to find a lady, just like her. A woman that hailed from a good, respectable family that could contribute to the Lindman House.She excused herself from their company, opting to head back into her assigned room. When asked why she had to go, she feigned having a slight headache, nothing a good rest wouldn\u2019t fix in time for dinner.Once she was back in the room, her lady-in-waiting went to fetch some medicine she didn\u2019t really need. Claudine only sat in front of the fireplace, watching as the fire slowly ate away the firewood.Leyla Lewellin.She knew that Leyla was held in high-esteem around their society. She was intelligent as she was beautiful. But no matter how respected she was, it didn\u2019t change the fact she was born of a low-status family. It was only a matter of time before Leyla would leave the life of a mistress behind.There was no way she would allow herself to be in such a relationship too long\u2026But Claudine couldn\u2019t entirely disregard that small possibility that Leyla would choose to stay with Matthias.She had no intention in actually confronting the girl. There was far too much on Leyla\u2019s plate right now, and she wasn\u2019t that thoughtless. She actually decided to keep quiet and act as though Matthias was sleeping around with Leyla behind her back.Suddenly, her lady-in-waiting came in with the medicine, and Claudine schooled her posture into a more appropriate way for one suffering a headache. Unfortunately, her servant tripped and fell, spilling the tray of medicine, and shattering the glass of water she carried with her.Claudine shrieked in surprise, hastily moving out of the way before rushing to her side, carefully avoiding the shards of glass.\u201cAre you alright?!\u201d she asked worriedly to her lady-in-waiting. The girl only hastily got up, bowing apologetically at her.\u201cYes, thank you my lady!\u201d she sputtered, completely red in the face, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the mess!\u201d\u201cOh dear,\u201d Claudine gasped when she saw the blood drip down her servant\u2019s hand, \u201cOh my, your hand!\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s just a small prick my lady!\u201d the girl insisted, \u201cSee? It\u2019s not a big\u2026 deal\u2026\u201d wincing when her hand revealed a shard embedded into her palm. Claudine winced at the sight. It looked as though the shard got it a little too deep to be just a\u00a0small prick.\u201cOh hush now,\u201d Claudine said, quickly fetching some handkerchief to stifle the flowing blood, and gently cupping the girl\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cIt\u2019ll be quite difficult for you to keep working with such a wound, why don\u2019t you take some time to recover?\u201d she suggested, making the girl shake her head.\u201cOh, no, my lady, truly I\u2019m fine!\u201d\u201cI insist you take some time off.\u201d Claudine said, looking at her sternly, and the girl\u2019s protests died down. \u201cAlright, Mary?\u201d she called out, prompting for a response.\u201cO-of course, my lady.\u201d Mary weakly agreed, letting Claudine smile at her agreement. She bowed deeply towards her lady, and moved to get her hand fixed, but stopped for a moment, looking back at Claudine hesitantly.\u201cBut my lady-\u201d\u201cI will be fine Mary,\u201d Claudine insisted once more, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s find someone else to help you.\u201dClaudine led them through the halls of the mansion, finding a few servants to clean up the mess in her room, while some headed off to fetch a first aid kit. She watched as they moved around her. She then looked at Mary\u2019s injured hand, being cleaned and wrapped neatly with a bandage.Mary had been a servant from her own house. Her most favored one, in fact. It was why Mary had volunteered to come with her to Arvis, to continue to serve her lady. Mary had also been with her since she was a child, and Claudine enjoyed being around her so much mostly because of her quick wits and occasional stutter.Satisfied Mary was being well-taken care of, Claudine headed towards the lobby, where the other ladies were chatting. Among them was Elysee von Herhardt. Upon seeing her, the Herhardt matriarch stood up to meet her.\u201cOh Claudine! I heard about your maid. Oh how inconvenient.\u201d she said, \u201cIt would be difficult for you these next few days then, how about I lend you one of my servants to assist you as your attendant in the whole duration of your stay, hm?\u201d she suggested, and Claudine shook her head.\u201cOh, thank you for the offer, but I can assure you I would be fine.\u201d She replied, \u201cBesides, you\u2019ll need every hand you could get to help prepare for the crown prince and his wife\u2019s arrival. I couldn\u2019t possibly add to their workload.\u201d\u201cOh nonsense! Please, I insist you take one of my servants! Otherwise I would just be beside myself if you continue without an attendant.\u201d Elysee insisted back, urging her to accept.Claudine smiled brightly, a thought popping up in her head. She really shouldn\u2019t\u2026But the nagging in the back of her mind grew louder, making her give in.\u201cWell then, how about I have Leyla as my attendant?\u201d she brightly requested. And Elysee blinked back in shock, her own smile stilling on her face at the mention of the gardener\u2019s foster daughter.\u201cLeyla?\u201d Elysee asked, \u201cYou want to have Leyla as an attendant?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d she said, smiling brightly at the matriarch, \u201cI would be more comfortable with her as my attendant, and seeing as it is the school break, she\u2019s most probably free during my stay. That way I wouldn\u2019t be imposing on your servants.\u201d she calmly explained, \u201cThat is, if you would allow it, my Lady.\u201d she added respectfully.There was a dangerous glint in Elysee\u2019s eyes at the mere thought of that gardener\u2019s foster daughter stepping foot\u00a0 in her home. She was still sore about the whole ordeal about the greenhouse too.\u201cWell, are you sure?\u201d Elysee asked once more, \u201cShe probably couldn\u2019t assist you as well as my current servants will.\u201d\u201cOh, I promise Leyla would do just fine as my attendant!\u201d Claudine politely insisted back, ignoring the obvious glare her own mother was shooting at her. \u201cShe\u2019ll only be assisting me, just for a few days tops.\u201dElysee hummed, nodding along in agreement. Her jaw clenched as she smiled at Claudine. And so with a heavy heart, Elysee went to summon one of her maids with a ring of her bell.One maid immediately came rushing in, politely standing a few paces beside her as she awaited for orders. And so, through gritted teeth, Elysee spoke.\u201cPlease summon Leyla to the mansion as soon as possible.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She never expected it was because Claudine needed an attendant since hers had been injured not too long ago.Elysee had immediately explained to her what she was going to do, and when she should do it, but to be honest, Leyla hadn\u2019t really been paying attention. It was like the words entered one ear, and out the other as she nodded along without really understanding anything.\u201cWell, that\u2019s it.\u201d Elysee hummed, \u201cAll you really need to do is help Claudine with whatever things she needed doing. And don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s paid work.\u201d\u201cMadam, I don\u2019t really have the experience though\u2026\u201d Leyla weakly countered, but Elysee only looked at her sternly.\u201cHaven\u2019t you assisted Claudine before?\u201d she cut off harshly, \u201cI know you probably did when you were still children. It won\u2019t be hard work, I assure you. You\u2019ll just assist her maid until her hand heals and she can do it herself.\u201dThe distaste on the matriarch\u2019s face was clear. She had been in a foul mood ever since she called for Leyla.\u201cSurely you won\u2019t refuse such a favor?\u201d Elysee prodded, raising a brow at the woman, \u201cAfter all, Claudine had been so graceful to the fact your uncle destroyed the greenhouse which was supposed to be their wedding venue.\u201d she said as though to add insult to injury, \u201cThink of this as a way to repay her.\u201dThe way the madam mentioned Bill was through gritted teeth. Leyla could tell Elysee wanted her to know she hadn\u2019t forgiven Bill for the accident he caused. A murmur amongst the other ladies with them broke out as they whispered to each other.\u201cYou mean her uncle\u2019s\u00a0that\u00a0gardener?\u201d\u201cMy, if I were her I wouldn\u2019t want anyone related to him working under me.\u201dClaudine eyed the ladies through her peripheral, before walking beside Leyla, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder before pulling away to stand beside her future mother-in-law.\u201cOh will you do this for me, Leyla please?\u201d she said politely with a pleading smile, \u201cI promise it won\u2019t be too much of a hassle for you.\u201d she swore. \u201cI just need help with simple tasks every now and then, the rest of the time you\u2019ll be free to roam the mansion even.\u201dClaudine took the time Leyla thought it through to observe her. She looked paler than she was the last time she saw the woman, but at least Leyla didn\u2019t appear more conniving and ambitious. When Leyla still remained silent, Claudine decided to put her in a corner.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, isn\u2019t it, Leyla?\u201d Claudine asked, pushing her to agree. Somewhere across the room, Riette tried to catch her attention, but she resolutely ignored him as she stared intently at her fiance\u2019s mistress.After all, if Leyla were to decide to stay with Matthias, she\u2019ll have to learn to live with her. She needed this time to get used to that fact, as well as to ensure Leyla wouldn\u2019t get any ideas in the long run.\u201cClaudine expects an answer, girl!\u201d one of the ladies snapped at Leyla, looking at her disapprovingly when she still refused to give an answer. Leyla, on her part, looked at Claudine with the eyes of a lost child. Quietly imploring Claudine to let her be.As Claudine looked back at her, she wondered if it were those eyes who managed to snag such an emotionless man\u2019s heart? She knew what she wanted Leyla to answer, and was content to wait as long as she could to get it.It wasn\u2019t long until Leyla realized she wasn\u2019t allowed to leave.\u201cOf course, my Lady.\u201d she finally replied, bowing her head to look resolutely on the floor. Her hands were clasped in front of her meekly, as she hoped for the upcoming days to be over soon.\u201cOh how kind of you!\u201d Claudine beamed at her, \u201cThank you so much, Leyla!\u201d she added, Leyla finally looked up to give her a hesitant smile in return.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*In his four-day stay in Ratz, Matthias\u2019 work schedule was packed to the brim. He hardly had any time for a break.As most businesses belonging to the Herhardt empire, they were based in Carlsbar. However, there was also a significant number of them in Ratz. All businesses were relevant in managing good relations between the royal family, their respective political circles, as well as social connections in the capital.Which also meant that half the time, the Duke of Arvis stayed in the capital. And that fact wouldn\u2019t change even if he were to get married soon, and would father an offspring.Although, it made him think if perhaps he should make Leyla move with him to Ratz? It was a tempting thought. Matthias looked up at the office\u2019 ceiling after the last group of visitors left.It was no secret that the Herhardt\u2019s mansion in Ratz housed the duke\u2019s mistress for generations. Even his father\u2019s longest mistress once lived here.Back when he was young, Matthias always saw her whenever he\u2019d stop by at the capital to visit his father. Both him and his mother acknowledged her presence, after all, his father still showed them the right courtesy as his wife and son despite his obvious affair.As such, the mistress never dared cross his mother, nor him for that matter. It was the way things were in their household after all. The Herhardt house he grew up in.It certainly would be good for him.After all, he had no plans to get rid of her any time soon, he might as well join the club of his predecessors. It would make little sense for him to allow Leyla to live in Arvis after he got married. Though he wondered if Leyla would be amenable to his plan.She\u2019d been getting a little rebellious lately. Matthias could perfectly recall the way she would glare at him defiantly.It was more likely she would deny the chance to move out of Arvis if that meant cementing her role as his mistress. Plus, she wasn\u2019t the type of woman who\u2019d keep quiet for long. She\u2019ll blab soon enough to her uncle, Bill, who she would choose over him in a second every single time.\u201cAh Leyla,\u201d Matthias sighed out, clicking his tongue at the sound of her name. He swept his hand through his hair, before he rubbed his face in deep thought.That ill-temper of hers had been amusing at first, but it was proving to be more and more of a nuisance as of late. He still didn\u2019t understand her reluctance at being with him when he could give her so much and more.And yet he knew she\u2019d refuse every single one of them if it came from him.He knew he had a strong hold over her, but most of the time it felt as though it was the other way around. He could hardly believe the times he had to reassess his plans because of what she wanted.He thought about her for so long, Matthias finally realized it was becoming a habit for him to keep thinking about her every time he had the time to spare. And yet through all that thinking, he\u2019d yet to reach a conclusion.She filled his thoughts at every second of every moment of everyday.A sudden knock came, and Mark Evers entered politely inside his office, bowing briefly before delivering his news.\u201cMaster, Colonel Farrell has arrived,\u201d he announced. Matthias nodded at him briefly in acknowledgement, before rising to his feet and fixed his appearance. Mark then stepped aside as he strode past him to greet his guest.Mark followed him obediently through the hallway as he proceeded to continue with his news.\u201cMaster, I also received word not too long ago from the Museum of Natural History.\u201d he informed. At the news, Matthias abruptly stopped in his tracks and turned to his attendant, prompting him to continue. \u201cThey\u2019d given word that the person who had carved the crystal ornament of a bird in their ceiling was some merchant named Kraken.\u201dMark proceeded to inform him that aside from supplying the museum, Kraken was also the one responsible for supplying the Imperial family with their exquisite jewelry.\u201cShall I send out word to him that you\u2019d like to purchase an order?\u201d Mark asked him. Matthias took no time to answer.\u201cYes, send word I\u2019d like to purchase a sculpture similar to the one in the museum.\u201d he commanded and went on his way, before stopping once more, \u201cThough with some changes.\u201d\u201cWhat changes would that be, master?\u201d\u201cI want him to make the wings yellow.\u201d he ordered, and Mark jotted the information down before Matthias finally went on his way, stopping no more.In the back of his mind, he recalled the way Leyla had looked up in amazement at the intricate ornament in the museum when they had visited it the first time. The passageway was filled with gaudy bird-like crystal ornaments, and she stood on her tippy toes to reach out to every single one of them\u2026She looked absolutely radiant at that moment when he held her in his arms. He wanted that feeling again.She had been content the entire time they toured the museum, and she spent the rest of the day just writing, observing, and admiring every piece in the museum. Perhaps giving her the chance to study in Ratz now wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea.The thought of giving her an ornament struck him when he passed by the Museum during his stay in Ratz. It was his sole reason why he sought out the sculptor, and instructed his attendant to order something just as spectacular.Which was unlike him really.He finally reached the door to the reception room when the thought of her attending the same college as Kyle struck him. The frustration came bubbling up like a volcano, before quickly dying down to a simmer when he remembered Leyla was already his.Yes, she wouldn\u2019t ever leave him for Kyle, not anytime soon.And so, he entered the room in a considerably lighter mood and played flawlessly his role as the perfect, influential Duke Herhardt, schooling his features back into a neutral expression.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cOh, do you remember this place, Leyla?\u201d Claudine asked as she sat across from her new attendant, smiling brightly as she looked around, \u201cThis was exactly where we first met one another!\u201d she recalled gleefully.\u201cI remember well, my Lady.\u201d Leyla supplied, looking absolutely stiff in her seat as she looked around nervously.How could she forget the place in her youth where the young Claudine had dragged her in and eventually abandoned her at?She kept her gaze down, hoping to avoid any tension between them.At the very least, Claudine hadn\u2019t been lying when she said the work would be simple. Aside from a few random errands, the work she had to do was mostly minor compared to her work as a teacher. She was mostly just a glorified companion, someone Claudine could talk to whenever she grew bored or restless on her own.Truly, it wasn\u2019t anything different from how they interacted when they were still children.\u201cIt feels as though it was just yesterday when we first met, but then I see you and I\u2019m reminded of just how much time passed us by!\u201d Claudine moaned with an air of regret. Leyla didn\u2019t know how to contribute to the conversation.Fortunately, it was when Claudine\u2019s injured attendant rushed in, reminding her young mistress it was time for them to prepare for a tea party, as such a change of clothes were in order.Leyla quietly shut her book, and obediently followed them both inside, and back to the guest bedroom where Claudine was staying. Already, her next set of wardrobe and accessories were laid out, all that needed to be done was to get them on Claudine.Leyla also had the privilege to assist Claudine in this area, with the maid boasting that on the side she could do it with her eyes closed. Unfortunately, it was one of the tasks Leyla struggled to do. She doesn\u2019t know what half of the garments were, while the other she couldn\u2019t secure properly in place.The maid kept scolding her whenever she made a mistake, resulting in Claudine laying a placating hand on her incensed maid, while giving Leyla a bright smile in compensation.\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s all fine, Maria,\u201d Claudine said, before turning to Leyla, \u201cGo on, Leyla, you can do it.\u201d she encouraged.It seemed like Lady Brandt had no intention in calling for another maid to assist her after all. Leyla had to endure the difficulty of dressing her by herself. If it were any other maid, Claudine would have been fully dressed by now.It took Leyla over an hour to finish, and yet she heard neither peep nor sound of a complaint from her temporary mistress. She tried her best really, but she just kept fumbling until it turned out to be an absolute disaster! She couldn\u2019t even secure the corset properly!Claudine glanced at her attire in the floor length mirror in her room, letting out an inaudible sigh at the sight of her. She then reached out, and took off the accessories Leyla draped around her, which included the hat, gloves, shawl, and even the necklace.She certainly felt a lot cooler, and lighter than a while ago.\u201cOh dear, it must have been difficult for you,\u201d Claudine sighed, careful not to let out any hint of irritation or disappointment in her voice, \u201cYou definitely had a hard time just now.\u201d she finished, giving Leyla a pitying smile.Without the accessories on her now, Leyla could definitely look much better than before. She couldn\u2019t help but stiffen up in embarrassment over her failure. With the way Claudine was looking at her, she couldn\u2019t help but feel as though she was just a child once more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She sat in her bed, illuminated only by her sole lamp on the desk as she basked in the darkness of her room.The night had gotten so late already, but she hardly felt the need to sleep. She tried to force herself to sleep at some point earlier, but all she achieved was more tossing and turning. It was in her restlessness she could find clarity in her mind.Her windows immediately rattled by the strong gust of wind, snapping her alert as she whipped her head to stare in alarm at her windows, fearing the worst.For a second she thought Phoebe had come by with a note from the duke, until she realized that couldn\u2019t happen. The duke was away after all, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for Phoebe to visit the mansion.Relief quickly swelled in her chest, enabling her to get up and wrap a shawl around her thin arms. Her lips chattered against the cold, and she tried to imagine what Uncle Bill would see if he were to return at the moment.She felt so lost right now. He\u2019d only left not two days ago, and already she was feeling so lonely. She couldn\u2019t imagine just how hard the next two weeks would be for her.She walked closer to the window, re-checking the locks were secure before she found herself seated at the dining table, cradling a warm cup of tea in her palms.\u201c-it must be difficult for you.\u201dClaudine\u2019s voice echoed in her head, rising above the mingling voices in her head. She could practically hear her ear ringing in the loudness of the silence around her. Leyla put the cup down on the table, having lost the appetite for the tea, the cold digging into her deeper.She wanted to do something. She wanted to scream her heart out and probably kick some stones with her feet in frustration, break something even! Anything!But when she was walking back to their cabin, with her head trailed on the ground beneath her feet in the light of the moon, she only found herself feeling so guilty and ashamed. It didn\u2019t matter if Claudine was antagonizing her purposely or not, Leyla felt like she lost the right to be upset with her.She was sleeping with her fiance after all.And so she could only take solace on the fact that Matthias was away, and didn\u2019t have the luxury of seeing her so submissive and obedient. If he did, it would have brought immense satisfaction for the man, and she swore off that.She downed her cooling tea in one gulp, before refilling it with a still-warm tea from the pot. She removed her glasses, rubbing her eyes gently before pinching the bridge of her nose as she squeezed them shut. She let out a tired sigh, before rubbing her palm over her face and through her hair\u2026She had a vague sense of what she really was to Matthias.In front of others, he\u2019d maintain the facade of a perfect gentleman. He gave them the image of a perfect and respectable duke. But in the confines of his room, and in her company, only then did he feel confident enough to let her see the darker parts he held in him.She doubted he\u2019d ever let Claudine know about that, even if they were to wed.A steely gaze went over her, as she quickly emptied her second cup. She put it down on the table, standing up abruptly to recheck the locks on the doors were secure this time. Leyla glanced out the window, watching the darkened world outside her home.She really hated him.Everything, all the emotions she kept in her all day long; her torture and torment in the Arvis mansion, the turmoil in her mind\u2026They were all because of him. And she\u2019d hate him forever for that.She might be a little unfair, after all, it wasn\u2019t as if the duke was the\u00a0only\u00a0one to blame for the suffering she was put through. He didn\u2019t make her tear Kyle\u2019s heart mercilessly earlier today. She did that of her own volition, but that didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t want to blame that to the duke.She went back to her room, doing one last sweep to secure the locks on both doors and windows, before she curled up in her bed in a fetal position. When dawn came, a thought entered her mind.What if he were to come back earlier? That way, she could at least have an outlet for her frustration. Direct it to the man who\u2019s responsible for her suffering. Yes, that would work indeed\u2026And just like that, Leyla wanted to see Matthias returning soon.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When Dr. Etman went to visit Norma, he brought Kyle along with him. At the sight of the doctor\u2019s son, Catharina beamed, to which Kyle returned effortlessly with his own kind smile to the old Herhardt matriarch.\u201cOh it\u2019s so good to see you Kyle!\u201d Norma greeted, \u201cMy, you\u2019ve grown so much since the last time I saw you!\u201d she praised, and Kyle let out a short laugh in embarrassment. She then turned to her doctor, \u201cIt was nice of you to bring him along, today.\u201d\u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t much trouble really, my Lady.\u201d Dr. Etman replied, \u201cBesides, it was our pleasure to visit you, isn\u2019t that right, son?\u201d\u201cYes it is.\u201d Kyle quickly agreed, shooting them a convincing smile, which he hoped would placate the side-eye his father gave him. Norma seemed to have missed the tension between the father and son duo, and smiled brightly at the confirmation.She had wanted to meet with Kyle soon when she heard he returned to Arvis. She really was fortunate that Dr. Etman suggested he\u2019d bring Kyle with him by his next visit, which happened to be today.She had gotten a slight cold not too long ago, but thankfully caused her no further health problems, which made her treatments short. The rest of their visit was spent with them catching up with one another, and regaling them of tales of their everyday life.Kyle wasn\u2019t really much in the mood to visit, but for Lady Catharina\u2019s sake, he\u2019d be amicable and pleasant. He owed her that much at least. The old Herhardt matriarch always adored him as a child, and he\u2019d hate to disappoint her.Still, his mind was filled with thoughts of Leyla. Just the mere thought of her threatened to break his calm composure as he struggled to keep the tears from forming in his eyes.He knew she lied to him. He was sure of it. It was the only thing that made sense. He replayed her words over and over, how could he not? He remembered everything about her lately.Her speech, the way she left, and her tears when she thought he wouldn\u2019t catch up but did\u2026He was currently planning on an escape route from his father once their visit was over. He needed to see her, despite her telling him she didn\u2019t want to ever again. He wanted to help her, and he needed to know why she felt the need to lie to him.Fortunately, shortly after administering her medicine, Norma began to feel drowsy, an unfortunate side effect. And so his father decided it was best to give her rest, and they all exchanged goodbyes, with a promise to visit when she was better.Kyle was quick to leave before his father after he bid Lady Catharina goodbye, but just as he began to snuck off, he was unexpectedly greeted by one of Arvis\u2019 maids, who stood patiently outside the room, waiting for him and his father.\u201cGreetings Dr. Etman, and his son.\u201dThe maid said, bowing in front of them, sparing him a glance before turning back to his father,\u201cI apologize for the abruptness, but Lady Brandt has invited you over for some tea. If you have time to spare.\u201dHis father\u2019s eyes widened in pleasant surprise, exchanging a small look with Kyle before nodding along with the maid.\u201cIt would be no trouble to accompany Lady Brandt.\u201d his father replied. She then began to lead them towards where Claudine was, eyeing him in an indecipherable way.Kyle couldn\u2019t help but think that even if his father were to decline the invitation, the maid won\u2019t let them say no.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Earlier that day, Elysee had decided to go out to the city, which her entourage of ladies quickly agreed and accompanied her with. Leaving Claudine in Arvis, in the peaceful reception room when afternoon struck.She did her embroidery in front of the fireplace. Sat opposite her was Leyla, reading a book as per usual. Claudine knew that Dr. Etman came by to visit Lady Catharina today. She also knew he brought with him Kyle. Perhaps their visit would be over soon.Her eyes snuck a glance at the door to their reception area, before glancing back at her companion. She was too focused on her book. Claudine couldn\u2019t help but look at Leyla like a mother would with her unsociable child.She knew Matthias would be returning sometime tomorrow. Claudine wasn\u2019t foolish enough to believe it was\u00a0just\u00a0because he finished quickly. He probably finished quickly because he missed his mistress too much.She needed to tread carefully. She didn\u2019t want to know what would happen if Matthias even thought she was mistreating his precious Leyla. Since it was the last day she could be alone with Leyla, she decided to give Leyla a little\u00a0gift, of sorts.Claudine\u2019s lips curled up into a subtle smirk at the thought.Yes, it was good to give Leyla some kind of gift for all the good work she did the past few days. She\u2019d done exceptionally after all, aside from the slight mishap with changing her clothes, she did wonderfully as her aide.But that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t still an orphan, despite her holding her head up high as though she wasn\u2019t a low-born. Yes, even now, Claudine has yet to see her look even guilty or contrite for being Matthias\u2019 mistress. Although she did remain ever modest and polite around her.She wanted Leyla to squirm around her. Such audacity for the mistress to remain so calm around the fiance. She really was quite the shameless mistress. It was the best compliment Claudine could give her right now.Perhaps if she continued to work well as her aide, Claudine might be convinced to give her the position full-time, even well into their wedding. She might even let Leyla take care of her child with Matthias when the time comes.\u201cYou know, I can\u2019t help but wish your marriage with Dr. Etman\u2019s son had come true.\u201d Claudine suddenly piped up, breaking Leyla\u2019s concentration as she looked up in shock at her.\u201cP-pardon?\u201d Leyla asked, her voice just above a whisper.\u201cYour marriage, with, hm, what was his name?\u201d Claudine thought, \u201cKyle was it? I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d she asked Leyla, who nodded shortly in confirmation.\u201cYes, you and Kyle, I wish you did get married.\u201d Claudine continued, \u201cJust imagine it! You and him at the university in the capital, you two would have had the best life right now.\u201d she finished brightly, looking determinedly at Leyla.Leyla\u2019s brows furrowed at the topic.\u201cMy Lady-\u201d but Claudine cut her off.\u201cPlus, both of you look so good together! You had been so happy with him. I never saw you like that around anyone else.\u201d\u201cMy Lady-\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help but think Mrs. Etman had been too cruel to you.\u201d Claudine continued on as though she didn\u2019t hear Leyla. \u201cI know she\u2019s his mother, but what right did she have dictating her son\u2019s marriage, am I right?\u201dThis time, she looked at Leyla, allowing her the chance to reply. Leyla gulped under her stare, before she stared resolutely at her fingers, which unconsciously gripped tightly onto the book in her hands\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s no use reminiscing the past, my Lady,\u201d Leyla sighed, taking slow deep breaths, \u201cKyle and I\u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019d ever get back together again.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Claudine hummed, \u201cI was just sharing my thoughts.\u201d she replied back as she felt a sadistic sense of pleasure at seeing the turmoil in Leyla\u2019s expression.She knew that even if Kyle wanted Leyla back, which he probably did, Leyla wouldn\u2019t. She was far too deep in the Duke\u2019s clutches, she couldn\u2019t find the will in her to leave him for anyone else, not while he still wanted her.It was a sad fate for anyone who\u2019s wings got broken, Claudine supposed. In the end, living your life makes you more miserable.Deciding not to antagonize her further, she switched gears and gave Leyla another pitying look, sending her emphatic signs.After all, why wouldn\u2019t she feel sorry for her? Leyla became a reluctant mistress to a man that was ruining her life bit by bit.Granting her the small opportunity to enjoy some time with Kyle over a cup of tea would be a great gift from Claudine for all her hard work.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*There was a commotion amongst the servants as Hessen, head butler of Arvis Mansion, immediately called the servants to an assembly in front of the lobby hall. Hessen had been prepared to welcome his master tomorrow evening, but it was only a short while ago when he received word the Duke would be arriving today instead.The servants stood in attention, as they quickly schooled themselves with respectable expressions as they welcomed back the Duke of Arvis. Hessen rushed to greet him as the chauffeur opened his master\u2019s door.\u201cWelcome back master!\u201d He greeted, breathing deeply as he bowed in front of the duke. Normally he was composed, but the unexpected change in schedules made him rush a bit in his haste to greet his master properly, along with the other servants in the mansion.Matthias only nodded at him, giving a nod of acknowledgement at his servants before continuing inside the mansion, striding through the polished halls of his home. Hessen rushed after him, giving him news of the events that happened while he was away.\u201cAnd my mother?\u201d\u201cLady Elysee had gone to the city along with a few other ladies not too long ago, while Lady Catharina is resting in her quarters.\u201d he dutifully supplied.\u201cAnd what of Lady Brandt?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s in the small lounge by the second floor, we just prepared some tea for her.\u201dMatthias hummed, swiftly turning on his heels to head up the mentioned area.When Hessen heard Leyla would be serving under Lady Brandt, he\u2019d been skeptical of it. Of course, even if he wanted to be against the idea, it wasn\u2019t in his place to question his master or his betters on their decision.He rushed after his master, wondering how to break the news to him that Leyla was around. He panicked further, when he realized they were nearing the lounge area, and he\u2019d yet to give his master the news!\u201cDuke Herhardt, welcome back!\u201d called out Dr. Etman, who just turned around one of the halls to head into the lounge. Matthias stopped in his tracks to greet the doctor properly, when he caught sight of Kyle behind the doctor.It was only a split second, but Hessen had worked around Matthias long enough to have caught onto his subtle tics.\u201cThank you, I wasn\u2019t expecting you here.\u201d Matthias politely greeted back, smiling appropriately.\u201cAh, we were just about to leave after a visit with your grandmother, when Lady Brandt extended us an invitation for tea.\u201d Dr. Etman jovially explained, smiling at the duke.\u201cAh, then it\u2019s fortunate we get to go there together.\u201d Matthias smiled, gesturing for the doctor to go in first. Matthias quickly glanced at Kyle, who waited for the duke to enter first, before shortly following inside.Hessen paled at the sight of the three men entering the area Lady Brandt and Leyla were in. He tried to stall for some more time, to better prepare his master, but Matthias resolutely ignored him as he pushed the door open\u2026Only for Dr. Etman and his son stiffened at the sight of the two women waiting for them inside. Matthias could only stand still beside them.\u201cOh God\u2026\u201dHessen swallowed down his trepidation, and prayed for the rest of the tea time to go smoothly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He zeroed in on her almost immediately, before he remembered his current company. He snuck a glance beside him, towards both Dr. Etman and Kyle, just enough to grasp the current situation he would be dealing with.Claudine gasped at the sight of him, before presenting him with a bright smile.\u201cDuke Herhardt! You\u2019re back earlier than we expected.\u201d She greeted him politely after a few tense moments of silence. Matthias gave her a courteous smile back.\u201cI apologize for being unable to inform you of the change in schedule my Lady,\u201d he began, \u201cBut I finished work earlier than I thought and figured I should get home. No point in delaying.\u201dHe took a few, long strides, before stopping beside Claudine and kissed her hand. He then turned to look at Leyla, who had stumbled back instinctively under his gaze, almost hitting the window behind her.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you already had a guest.\u201d he pointed out while staring softly at Leyla, who tried to remain inconspicuous within the shadows.\u201cAh, she isn\u2019t really here as a guest.\u201dClaudine admitted after debating in her head what was the best course of action here, and decided the truth was the least hassle to explain.\u201cMy aide had unfortunately hurt her hand in an accident, so I asked if Leyla could replace her temporarily. Your mother agreed.\u201d She added offhandedly, sparing Leyla a glance, before turning back to Matthias,\u00a0 \u201cAnd she\u2019d been a great help, I was so thankful I chose correctly.\u201d Claudine finished explaining.This was also the perfect opportunity for her to observe what Matthias would do with both his fiance and mistress in one room.\u201cAh, so she\u2019s your aide, is she?\u201d Matthias hummed, straightening up beside his fiance in that same undecipherable expression as always. Claudine acted innocently, just continuing to hold onto his hands. Matthias then turned to the other two guests in the room.\u201cThen I guess only Dr. Etman and his son were your planned guests this afternoon.\u201d he stated, and saw both men looked equally confused and bothered by the information. He then turned to look at Claudine, who only continued to beam brightly at him.\u201cYes, I did invite them when I heard they were visiting today.\u201d She beamed, before the smile dropped on her face, and looked worriedly at Leyla, \u201cOh but I completely forgot\u2026\u201d she trailed off, her eyes darting back and forth the past fiances\u2019 in the room apologetically.\u201cOh dear, I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make things so uncomfortable.\u201d Claudine apologized quickly, before Dr. Etman cleared his throat and gave her half a polite smile, and half a grimace.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to apologize, Lady Brandt.\u201d the doctor said, \u201cIt happens to the best of us.\u201d\u201cWell, shall we proceed with tea then?\u201d Matthias asked everyone in the room, acting indifferent to the tension around him. Claudine couldn\u2019t help but eye him warily, wondering what he would do next.\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kyle spoke up suddenly, with a hardened look on his face, \u201cI\u2019m afraid we have to go now, don\u2019t we father?\u201d he asked his father, but more like demanded them to leave by the tone in his voice. Dr. Etman fumbled over his reply, but hastily agreed.\u201cAh, yes, of course!\u201d he almost stuttered and bowed apologetically at the Duke and his Lady, \u201cI just remembered we have another patient to attend to afterwards, we must make haste.\u201d he quickly explained, shooting a nervous glance over Leyla\u2019s unresponsive form.He clearly pitied Leyla\u2019s situation.\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry to hear our time together must be cut short, but we understand.\u201d Matthias replied, nodding his head at them. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to give you a formal invitation for tea next time.\u201d\u201cThank you Duke Herhardt,\u201d Dr. Etman said, bowing to him, then to his lady, \u201cThank you once again, Lady Brandt.\u201d he then turned on his heels, and grabbed onto his son to keep moving, but Kyle kept staring at Leyla with a fire in his eyes.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear Leyla? Let\u2019s go.\u201d Kyle called out, causing the tension around the room to rise once more. Everyone\u2019s eyes were on him, but he pressed on, \u201cYou\u2019re not a maid around here, Leyla. Why are you acting like one?\u201dClaudine\u2019s eyes narrowed over at Kyle in a subtle manner, while Dr. Etman looked at his son as though he was crazy. Matthias\u2019 attention though, was solely focused on his mistress who first had an odd look on her face, before it turned into something desperate\u2026His jaw tightened at the subtle change.She looked like she was begging Kyle Etman. She looked as though it was\u00a0Kyle,\u00a0and not\u00a0him\u00a0who would be able to help her!\u201cYou may go now, Dr. Etman.\u201d Matthias interrupted, his cold voice cutting through the tension like a knife, \u201cAs head of Arvis, I will handle things from here.\u201d he said, looking straight at the doctor with an icy look.\u2018Control your son.\u2019It was what his look demanded, and immediately Dr. Etman forcibly ushered his son out of the reception area despite the wordless protests Kyle had against leaving without Leyla by his side.Kyle caught Leyla\u2019s pleading gaze, begging him to leave her alone. Kyle\u2019s fists clenched beside him, but ultimately had to respect Leyla\u2019s wishes no matter how much he wanted to disobey.The door clicked to a close, just as the doctor and his son managed to leave successfully this time. Matthias then grabbed onto his cup of warm tea, and stirred its contents, watching the vortex swirl in his cup.\u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to spend tea with just me, my Lady.\u201d he stated, and invited his fiance back to tea. When he turned to look at Claudine, she was visibly pale as she nervously looked at him.Matthias decided to ignore her for now, his attention back to observing Leyla, who now held a grief-stricken expression as she continued to dutifully stand at the corner of the room to give them some kind of privacy.And yet she must have felt his gaze on her, for her eyes shifted away and met his own. A viscous smirk paved its way on his lips as she looked at him.\u2018He won\u2019t be coming for you Leyla.\u2019\u00a0he conveyed to her, and the fearful look in her eyes quickly changed into rage. His smirk widened at the sight of it.Yes, that was a much better look on her.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cYour mother should be back soon enough with the other ladies,\u201d Claudine informed him as they sipped on their tea, \u201cShe\u2019d be happy to see you return sooner than expected.\u201dIt had been silent as soon as the Etmans left them. She felt too much like an outsider between the Duke and his mistress. She couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, and decided to break the deafness she was beginning to feel.\u201cWell, it seems to be getting closer to dinner, I should start preparing by now.\u201d Claudine continued. Matthias kept silent, content in letting her talk as he calmly sipped on his tea, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to prepare for dinner as well?\u201d she prompted him to reply.\u201cI think I want to enjoy my tea a little longer.\u201d He finally said, still not looking at her, \u201cYou\u2019re free to do as you wish though, Lady Brandt.\u201d he pointed out. Claudine pursed her lips as she stared at him a little bit more.\u201cWell then, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d she sighed out, and stood up from her seat. There was no point in bothering the Duke more. Should she press the wrong buttons, he might do something to her, and the thought of it terrified her.\u201cAren\u2019t you taking your aide with you?\u201d Matthias asked as soon as she passed him by to leave. Claudine paused, and looked back at him to see him staring at Leyla, who stood in the same spot she had been since tea time began.She glanced at both of them for a while, pondering what to do, before waving her metaphorical white flag to the Duke.\u201cNot tonight.\u201d she told him, \u201cI think Leyla deserves a little reprieve from her temporary tasks.\u201dEarlier, Matthias had acted like the perfect fiance, defending her in front of their guests, while acting like he was unbothered with Leyla\u2019s current status. He passed her little test that much at least, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel more nervous pushing him further as of the moment.\u201cGood work today Leyla,\u201d she turned to the poor woman this time, smiling brightly at her, \u201cConsider yourself duty-free for the rest of tonight.\u201d she praised before swiftly leaving them alone to meet up with her actual servant, who waited patiently for her outside the room.Claudine nodded at the woman outside, who then walked in quietly, handing Leyla some money for her pay for the day. Leyla numbly accepted it, as both Lady Brandt and her aide left them by themselves, and the doors swung to a close behind their retreating backs.Leyla stood rooted in place, her face devoid of her feelings. Matthias would have thought she was a statue if it weren\u2019t for the way her hands shook in front of her. He regarded her thoughtfully for the moment.Was it just him, or her pale complexion that made her lips so rosy today?With a click of his tongue, he gracefully stood from his seat and began stalking towards her like a predator would his prey. He held onto his cup, his knuckles turning white with how strongly he was gripping it. He only stopped when he stood just an inch apart beside her, and stared out the window.\u201cYou are to wait for me in the annex.\u201d he ordered, glancing at her from his side with an icy stare, \u201cOr don\u2019t. It\u2019s your choice in the end.\u201d he whispered right next to her ear. He kept staring at her, and Leyla bowed her head further down to avoid his eyes.The pouch of money in her hands crinkled as her hands continued to shake.Finally he stepped away from her and set the cup down back on the table before swiftly leaving her behind the room alone with her thoughts. He quickly turned towards his study.He sat down in front of his desk and drummed his fingers on the table top before he rang the bell in his study. Not a moment longer, Hessen came walking in, and bowing beside his table.\u201cHow can I help you, master?\u201d Hessen asked dutifully as he retained his bow.\u201cSummon Dr. Etman once more.\u201d Matthias said as he began to arrange the documents in his desk back to their working order. Hessen looked up at him in confusion. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we still need his services after all. I want him to look after another patient here in Arvis.\u201d he finished, leaving no room for any argument.\u201cI will do so at once, master.\u201d\u201cDo send him my apologies for the inconvenience.\u201d Matthias added as an afterthought, and Hessen bowed at him once more, before swiftly leaving his study to call for the doctor once more.Deep down inside, Hessen couldn\u2019t help but worry what had happened earlier, and what would happen later when the doctor arrived.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When Claudine was changed and dressed for dinner, she wasted no time in leaving her room and headed out once more to the room, where the ladies had just returned, and were accompanied by familiar gentlemen gathered around the area.When she entered, eyes turned at her arrival and greeted her with warm smiles.\u201cOh you look beautiful as always Lady Brandt.\u201d\u201cYes, Claudine\u2019s always had a nice figure, and she\u2019s quite tall as well.\u201d\u201cAny dress would compliment her!\u201d\u201cHush you, don\u2019t you see Marquis Lindman is here?\u201dThe ladies chattered, and Claudine only gave them a pleasant smile before she locked eyes with Riette. He had been away for a couple of days since he had to attend a different gathering by the central city, and had just returned tonight. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a little more at ease with him around.Perhaps earlier\u2019s incident wasn\u2019t a big deal. She hadn\u2019t seen hair nor hide of both Matthias and Leyla. Perhaps they\u2019re off frolicking under the sheets, and the entire mishap she made would be forgotten.After all, if the past few days were of any indication, it meant Leyla knew her place was less than Claudine\u2019s. While earlier\u2019s performance made her see that in front of an audience, Matthias knew how to act accordingly and put her in priority compared to his mistress.Yes, she would be fine. She had to believe that.She mingled among them, the atmosphere becoming brighter as they chatted and laughed around with each other in what they\u2019ve been up to in the city. Everything had been going well, at least until Matthias returned with Dr. Etman in tow.The chatter died down, as they looked at the unexpected guest. Madam Norma was the first to recover.\u201cOh, Dr. Etman, are you back so soon?\u201d she asked him, looking confused. She had felt fine all day since he visited her after all.\u201cOh, I\u2019ve been summoned by the Duke. He told me there was a patient I needed to see urgently.\u201d\u201cA patient?\u201d\u201cIs someone sick?\u201d\u201cPerhaps someone\u2019s injured.\u201dMurmurs slowly filled the room, as the nobles looked around to see who needed the help. Riette glanced nervously towards Claudine, who had narrowed her gaze towards Matthias who looked right back at his fiance.\u2018No.\u2019Claudine thought to herself and felt a bead of sweat roll down the nape of her neck.\u2018He wouldn\u2019t.\u2019Her hands twisted into her skirts, fisting her skirt into her clammy palms. She caught the smirk Matthias subtly sent her way and knew then and there he wouldn\u2019t let her go so easily for the mishap earlier.\u201cWhy, my Lady, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d Matthias asked innocently as he blinked at her. \u201cYou told me your maid had gotten into an accident and had been unable to do her duties, so I summoned the doctor to tend to her.\u201d\u201cMy maid?\u201d Claudine asked softly in an incredulous manner, looking nervously at the eyes that turned towards her, \u201cOh, you mean Mary?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Matthias quickly nodded, \u201cIf you would so please summon her here so that the good doctor could tend to her quickly.\u201dEvery noble then began to look at the duke in awe at his thoughtfulness. Others couldn\u2019t even believe he would go as far as to summon their family doctor just for a maid, that wasn\u2019t even really part of their household, never mind the fact it was his fiance\u2019s.\u201cHonestly Matthias, how could you summon our doctor for a maid\u2019s wounds?\u201d Elysee scoffed, and Matthias only smiled at his mother politely.\u201cIt isn\u2019t just any maid dear mother, but my Lady\u2019s.\u201d he calmly explained, \u201cI would hate to see the rest of her stay be uncomfortable because of her maid being so injured to the point she can\u2019t even use her hands. It worried me greatly, so I can\u2019t imagine the burden she must be feeling right now.\u201dThe other ladies cooed at how sweet he was being, Claudine could only breathe deeply as she smiled gratefully at the duke in a nervous manner.\u201cYou are so kind, my Duke.\u201d she replied, licking her lips, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have to trouble yourself over my concerns-\u201d\u201cNonsense,\u201d Matthias interrupted her, \u201cWhat\u2019s your concern, is also my concern. After all, we are to be married soon enough.\u201d he said, staring down at her in faux kindness. Waiting no further confirmation from her, Matthias turned to one of the servants in the room.\u201cFind Lady Brandt\u2019s servant, and bring her here this instant!\u201d he barked, and they swiftly left to do his bidding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as the doctor unwrapped her bandage, it revealed a large gash on her hand, but not deep enough to hinder her from doing her duties.Elysee couldn\u2019t help but scoff at the revelation. She sneered down at the maid, who squirmed underneath all their gazes.\u201cWhat a lazy brat, feigning illness over something so small!\u201d she exclaimed, prompting the others to immediately agree in their assessment, even Madam Norma couldn\u2019t hold back her disapproval at the lie.Claudine on the other hand kept her lips shut as she stared at the duke.\u201cPlease mother, we don\u2019t know if it really is just skin deep.\u201d Matthias pointed out to his incensed mother, \u201cDoctor, if you please?\u201d\u201cAh, of course.\u201d Dr. Etman cleared his throat and assessed the injury with an expert eye. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a large gash, I won\u2019t deny, but the bones beneath seemed to be intact.\u201d he told everyone, \u201cOverall, I would say it\u2019s just a minor cut.\u201dThe maid suddenly burst into tears, unable to hold back her nervousness under their scrutiny. There wasn\u2019t even an ounce of pity thrown her way.\u201cOh, but isn\u2019t that absurd?\u201d Matthias hummed thoughtfully, finally looking towards his fiance, with that glint in his eye, \u201cMy lady specifically told me her maid had been injured and thus couldn\u2019t do her job, hence employing a temporary replacement. Was she wrong?\u201dAll eyes then shifted to Claudine, who inaudibly gulped. On the outside it looked like she was just as clueless as everyone, but anyone who would observe her closely could realize it wasn\u2019t cluelessness, but nervousness instead.\u201cI, I didn\u2019t know,\u201d Claudine stammered, \u201cI honestly believed she was unable to do her work.\u201d she reasoned out, casting a nervous glance at her sobbing maid.At this, Matthias drew closer to the maid and took her hand from the doctor\u2019s, and caressed her gash just right beside it. \u201cWell if that\u2019s true then,\u201d he eyed the maid coldly, \u201cIt must be the maid who lied to my Lady after all.\u201d he pointed out, and there was an uproar amongst the nobles with them.The maid just kept crying, and bowed her head deeply in apology, refusing to utter a single sound aside from an apology. Matthias couldn\u2019t help but feel a tad bit impressed with his fiance.Claudine von Brandt was a different breed of noble, he\u2019d admit. She was intelligent as she was beautiful, and she knew how to use it to her advantage. A desirable trait for his future duchess. Which was why her maid was determined not to rat her mistress out.\u201cI, I can\u2019t think of anything else but believe she did deceive me.\u201d Claudine weakly replied, and Matthias hummed, turning the maids hands up calmly, making the sobbing girl look up at him in fright. He couldn\u2019t help the satisfaction he felt at seeing her cry beneath him.\u201cHow dare you deceive my Lady?\u201d he questioned in a low voice, his icy glare directed towards her. But behind his harsh words, Claudine could hear a hint of amusement hidden so well if she wasn\u2019t looking for it.Immediately Claudine stood up and walked closer to them.\u201cPlease my Duke, let me handle Mary. Forgive her indiscretion, just this once.\u201d Claudine interrupted, gaining Matthias\u2019 attention once more. The audience they had watched with bated breaths, wondering what was about to happen.\u201cIn the meantime, accept my apology on her behalf.\u201d Claudine declared, ignoring the way her mother reached out for her to stop her. The maid looked ready to faint any moment now by the intense stare down Matthias and Claudine had between them.\u201cIt\u2019s my job as her mistress to take care of her, she\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d Claudine persisted, \u201cI must have been neglectful of her that she had no choice but to feign injury for time to rest.\u201d\u201cAnd you would just forgive her like that?\u201d Matthias asked, tilting his head in faux confusion at what she was asking of him, \u201cSomeone who deceived you? You\u2019re too kind for your own good, my Lady.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d Claudine shot back politely, \u201cShe\u2019s been with me for a long time. How could I just ignore the years she served me well over a single mistake?\u201dClaudine had a feeling she would come to regret having said that, but as he was driving her into a corner, she didn\u2019t have any other argument in her arsenal to plead for Mary\u2019s mercy without admitting she lied and knew the extent of the injury.\u201cI\u2019m not so sure I should let it slide.\u201d Matthias admitted, frowning in thought, but Claudine persisted.\u201cYou\u2019d understand it most though, I\u2019m sure my Duke,\u201d she added, \u201cAfter all, you did the same thing with the gardener not too long ago.\u201dMatthias\u2019 gaze hardened for a while at the subtle jab she gave him over his decision to let the charges be dropped against Bill Remmer. He held his fiance\u2019s gaze for a moment, before nodding in agreement.She was confident, he\u2019d give her that too. She wasn\u2019t the kind to lose composure easily in public, even if it was up against someone who already knew what she did. And so he flashed her a pleased smile in front of everyone.\u201cDoes this mean my Lady finally understands why I did what I did?\u201d he asked, a smirk on his lips, knowing he\u2019s once more driven her to a corner. Claudine took a deep breath before nodding at him with a soft smile.\u201cOf course,\u201d she stated, her cheeks growing red, both in embarrassment and frustration, but for everyone watching, they\u2019d simply assume it was because of the loving way he seemingly looked at her,\u201cI am still so amazed by your kindness and generosity. Which is what inspired me to forgive my servant.\u201d she added. Matthias nodded along, and clasped his hands behind his back, before turning to the maid and back to Claudine.\u201cThat is admirable of you, but I believe your maid still owes someone else an apology.\u201d Matthias pointed out. \u201cAfter all, we are not the only ones she\u2019d inconvenienced.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Claudine breathed subtly out of relief, \u201cI\u2019ll take Mary with me tomorrow and visit Leyla to deliver her an apology.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going with her?\u201d Matthias asked, quirking up a brow at her.Claudine seemed to have forgotten a few lessons in protocol in her nervousness, for she completely forgot the implications of what she just said.\u201cHm?\u201d she asked cluelessly.\u201cThat\u2019s right Claudine, why must you go with Mary, it would look like you are the one apologizing instead!\u201d her mother chastised her, before it finally dawned on Claudine what mistake she made.\u201cYou\u2019re right mother, I must have forgotten, I apologize once more.\u201d she said, and looking back at Matthias. He noted how she was becoming more frazzled the longer they stayed on the topic. He deemed she had been put in the spot long enough and decided to end his little test.\u201cIndeed, let your servant apologize to Leyla alone tomorrow, on behalf of both you, and myself.\u201d he finally said, placing his hand at the small of her back to escort her back to their seats.Matthias appeared to be trying to be comforting, but having his hand behind her was like a weight on her shoulders, giving her more pressure and nervousness that chilled Claudine to the bone. How could she be so reckless, trying to take him on in a fight in front of an esteemed audience?!However, she was also glad it was over now. Even more relieved that such a cold-hearted person did not regard her as highly as he did with Leyla.\u201cAs you will, Duke Herhardt.\u201d Claudine finally muttered, and walked ahead of him back to their seats.Satisfied that Claudine was dealt with, Matthias turned back to the maid, who immediately bowed her head when he glanced back at her.\u201cSee that you apologize to Miss Lewellin tomorrow.\u201d he commanded, and glanced back at his pale fiance, \u201cAnd remember the mercy your mistress had shown you today.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When Matthias had gone over to the annex, his first observation was that it was dark. His breathing remained steady as he sighed into the night, scattering his white huffs of breath into the night.He had thought to stop by the gardener\u2019s cabin just to be sure, but chose instead to head directly to the annex. At first it was because she might have chosen not to come, but knowing her, she most probably decided to stay in the darkness.Such stubbornness, he couldn\u2019t help but click his tongue in irritation.He pushed the entrance doors open, and locked it behind him as soon as he entered. The sound of the door\u2019s locks bounced off the walls, echoing in the halls, before dying down and silence reigned once more.He pressed on, headed up to his room, where it was just as dark as the night outside. Not even the lamp was turned on. His room was beyond freezing, the fireplace remaining unused.Matthias frowned, wondering perhaps Leyla really didn\u2019t come. He\u2019d given her the choice not to after all. And so he walked out, to check the whole property just to make sure. Something in him was restless, and he found himself unable to ignore it as he looked all over for her presence.He chanced another glance inside the room, pausing just outside the door to look. Everything was in tranquil state, and still he found no sight of her. His hands dug into his pockets, his right hand clutching into the box well hidden in his coat, as he could feel his lips dry in the chill air.It was almost as if the annex was sucking in the coldness outside, accumulating inside bit by bit until it filled the annex entirely. He swiftly turned on his heels and went back to his room.Despite having ordered her to come over, for once, he wished she\u2019d find the gall to disobey him. Just as he thought she was indeed absent from the annex, he arrived in his room.His eyes have long since adjusted in the dark. He began loosening up his clothes, and looked around when he frowned at the lump he found waiting for him on his wing chair. Matthias sighed in disappointment.There, sitting in front of his unlit fireplace was the woman he\u2019d just been searching for. In that position, she looked so peaceful, all curled up in herself as she slept. She was dressed warmly, but not enough to warm her in the freezing temperature.Usually she would be defiant when they\u2019d be alone together, now she looked a little bit docile.She must have gotten used to him at some point, because it wasn\u2019t long until her eyes fluttered open, to see a half-undressed Matthias looming over her. She blinked up at him blankly, before the anger, fear, disgust and resignation filled her eyes once more.\u201cHave you decided it was easier to freeze to death than starve?\u201d he snapped at her in disappointment, looking down at her like she was an inconvenience. He abruptly turned around and moved to lit up the fireplace.Hessen had already piled up some firewood in the room. It just needed to be lit.\u201cOr perhaps, and I\u2019m giving you the benefit of the doubt here,\u201d Matthias sighed as he straightened up from lighting the fire, \u201cYou did not know how to light a fire?\u201dHe peered up at Leyla, who only remained unresponsive. Finally he straightened up, crossing his arms over his chest, waiting for her answer. Leyla finally gave in after a few more moments in silence.\u201cIt would have been seen.\u201d she weakly replied.\u201cWhat would have been seen?\u201d Matthias prodded.\u201cThe light, the smoke,\u201d Leyla answered weakly, \u201cAnyone would have seen it from the chimney.\u201dCurrently, her face was shined upon by the light from the fireplace, giving Matthias a clearer view of her. He couldn\u2019t tell by the yellow light, but she looked rather pale. It wouldn\u2019t have been a stretch to think she could have frozen to death.\u201cAfter all, I wouldn\u2019t dare light a fire without the owner\u2019s permission.\u201d Leyla clapped back at him, and Matthias sighed at the glare she shot his way.\u201cNo one comes by the annex at night.\u201d he informed her, \u201cIt\u2019s just me. So there was no point for you to worry.\u201d\u201cStill. I didn\u2019t want to have others see it by chance.\u201dLeyla grasped onto her skirt, rubbing her palms on her knees to warm herself up some more, before uncrossing her legs to plant them back on the ground. Matthias watched as she rubbed her palms together, breathing warm breath over them, despite her gloves.\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you stay in the cabin?\u201d he shot back at her. Leyla shot him another glare.\u201cYou ordered me to wait for you.\u201d she hissed back, \u201cI only did as you told me.\u201d\u201cI also said it was your choice.\u201d Matthias pointed out. When she refused to answer, he tilted his head at her, and reached out to caress her cheek, making her flinch away from him, \u201cWhen did you become so obedient to my whims?\u201dLeyla bit her lip, and scooted away when he grazed his knuckles against her cheeks once more.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t come, you would have come after me in the cabin!\u201d she hissed at him, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you stepping foot in my home!\u201d\u201cOho,\u201d Matthias smirked at her, \u201cThen perhaps I should come to you next time after all.\u201d he grinned, before tossing a few more pieces of firewood into the fire. \u201cI wonder how beautiful you\u2019d be crying beneath me then.\u201d\u201cI hate you! I hate you so much!\u201d she exclaimed, standing up to get away from him, despite having no plans to run away from him. She just needed to put more distance between them.Matthias clicked his tongue.\u201cMust you say the same thing every time Leyla?\u201d he teased, \u201cIt\u2019s getting cumbersome hearing the same insult over and over again. Be a little more creative!\u201d He encouraged her.\u201cThat\u2019s great then because I have no plans in entertaining you!\u201d she snapped back, her rage bringing life into her. Matthias seemed pleased with himself to know she won\u2019t be freezing any time soon, not with the way she paced back and forth in her anger.He only chuckled to himself, picking up his coat and tossing it over to the bench nearest his bed. He then walked over to Leyla, who had just taken a seat once more. When she noticed him coming closer, she began to rise from her seat when he boxed her in.He briskly gathered her up in his arms, and repositioned her until she sat on his lap. She struggled against his hold, but he ignored it as he leaned back on the sofa, bringing her along with him. She eventually gave up, and sat limply atop him.His arm snaked behind her waist, as the other grasped onto her hands and he began to rub circles against the small of her back. He gently tucked her head beneath his chin and sighed deeply as he began to relax\u2026\u201cPlease, finish it quickly today.\u201d Leyla whispered to him, muffling her plea against his chest. Matthias\u2019 loving caresses stilled in place.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked, a bitter tone seeping through his voice.\u201cWhat it is you wanted to do with me.\u201d she raised her head to look at him pleadingly, looking so exhausted by everything. \u201cAfter all, it doesn\u2019t matter what I want. You\u2019re going to make me do it anyway.\u201d she laid out to him, before she lowered her gaze once more. \u201cSo I don\u2019t care what it is anymore. Just do it quickly.\u201dMatthias remained unresponsive, which Leyla took to elaborate some more.\u201cI just want to go home and finally rest when all this is over.\u201d she finished.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His hand came up behind her head, grasping her hair tight in his hand.He wanted to make her afraid, to intimidate her once more to submission. He wanted her to look at him and know that he could destroy her beneath him without having to lift a finger.He wanted to see her cry and beg for his mercy before he\u2019d callously toss her aside like the trash his mother sees them as!But when he imagined that all happening, he couldn\u2019t help the sinking feeling in his gut. His grasp on her loosened up, losing his will to do those terrible things to her.Instead, he pulled her closer, pulling her up flush against his warmth. He cradled her in a gentle way, and Leyla went along with no resistance. He knew she told him she wouldn\u2019t disobey him any further, but something was unsettling by how easily she always complied with his wishes.He then stood up from their seat, and carried her towards the bed, gently placing her down over the covers. He tucked a stray lock behind her ear, and kept her gaze on him as he took off her clothing one by one; her shawl, her coat, were the first to go.Somewhere in losing her clothes, Leyla\u2019s eyes wandered all around the room once more, refusing to keep eye contact with him. She resembled a doll, with her strings cut off. She knew by the way her sight blurred he\u2019d taken off her glasses, then the chill bit her fingers as her gloves were taken off as well.She gasped when he gently interlocked their bare hands together, making her look back at him in shock. He then gathered her in his arms, seeing the way the goosebumps ran up her arms once the coldness returned.Leyla looked back at his deep blue eyes, and felt a different kind of warmth fill her as he stared at her with those tender eyes she\u2019d seen him look with before. Her heart fluttered at the knowledge it was now directed at her, filling her with an odd sense of relief.Matthias held themselves together, content at their current contact as he busied himself with keeping her warm. Leyla wanted to look away from him again, but found herself unable to. She was drawn to him. She\u2019d always been drawn to him.She could feel the blood rush to her cheeks the longer they kept eye contact, filling her pale face with a healthy complexion once more. Matthias found himself so captivated by her, he\u2019d let go of her hand, making her gasp.Whether in shock or relief, Leyla couldn\u2019t know. He surged towards her, capturing her dried lips into his warm mouth, and began to kiss her without meaning to.It just felt right to do so.Leyla moaned at the feel of his lips against her, feeling his tongue prod at her lips to gain entrance. She gasped as she tried to pull away, only to let his tongue in, making her feel dizzy as the kiss gave her newer sensations.\u201cAh..\u201dHer body quivered under his roaming touches. One of his hands was busy fondling her, rubbing friction against her skin in a bid to keep her warm, while the other fisted in her hair, tightening in a pleasurable way as she let out a wanton moan in response.These feelings were making her uncomfortable, it was like she had to succumb into his ministrations. She squeezed her eyes shut, but it only heightened her sense of touch, and taste. She must remember why she\u2019s even allowing herself to be taken like this so helplessly!Yes, memories of the hurt she felt by the Duke, his blackmailing, and the immense betrayal she felt when he demanded her to do this was enough to save her from drowning in the tenderness he was showing her.It was as though he was trying to suck the life out of her, with how long he kept making out with her. When he finally pulled away, Leyla could tell her lips were swollen from the kiss, but at least her body was no longer freezing, instead there was a heat pooling under her stomach. She looked up, half-ready to be disappointed.\u201cAre we done?\u201d she asked him in a breathy whisper, they were both gasping for air, their chests heaving in tandem. Matthias just kept staring at her, \u201cDoes that mean I get to go home now?\u201dWhen he still remained silent, Leyla took it as a go-ahead, and began to leave the bed, when Matthias grabbed her by the arm, stopping her from leaving. He then snaked an arm around her waist, and pulled her flush until her naked back pressed against his chest. His warm breath grazed the back of her ear\u2026\u201cBe more like your body Leyla,\u201d he whispered against her ear, \u201cIt\u2019s been so honest so far.\u201d his husky voice encouraged, making her shudder against him. She could feel her cheeks flush once more at the intimacy of their position, feeling his index finger caress her cheeks.She could feel herself getting wetter the more she spent in his arms.Matthias appeared at ease with himself, confident in the way he\u2019d molded her body to respond to him\u2026And she hated it. She hated how her body\u00a0did\u00a0respond to him whenever he\u2019d touch her. How she\u2019d lean into it and respond so readily to him.\u201cI-I can\u2019t control how my body responds!\u201d she protested, gasping when he rubbed up against her, \u201cIt\u2019s similar to how you shiver when you\u2019re cold or grimace in pain when you\u2019re sick\u2026\u2026 It will be the same no matter who touches me. This is not what my heart wants.\u201d she finished. Matthias only hummed, nosing against the nape of her neck\u2026\u201cIs that really the truth? Or you\u2019re just denying it?\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but ask her. His aloofness made Leyla more nervous in his hold\u2026\u201cBelieve me,\u201d she hissed at him, the flickering flames of the fireplace catching her vision despite its blurriness as the fire reflected in her eyes, \u201cI meant it with all my heart that I hate you!\u201dThe memory of Claudine\u2019s maid giving her money for her services, was burned painfully in her mind\u2026\u201cAnd that will never change!\u201d she declared, feeling the tears well up in her eyes, but she didn\u2019t dare let them fall.\u2018I can\u2019t keep living like this!\u2019\u00a0she screamed in her head as she desperately wished for time to fast forward where she was past all this!The anger in her surged through the surface with her wish. All the pent up resentment and hatred she couldn\u2019t express towards Claudine because of her guilt in her affair, reared its ugly head towards the Duke who was the main reason why her life\u2019s been tumbling down the wrong road.\u201cAren\u2019t you prideful enough to not let a woman berate you like I do?!\u201d She hissed at him, and Matthias nodded in agreement,\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cThen just let me go and no woman ever will again!\u201d she exclaimed. Matthias just clicked his tongue.\u201cI told you already Leyla,\u201d he stood up, peering down at her with an intense gaze as he gathered her up in his arms until they\u2019re pressed chest to chest with each other, ignoring the way she squirmed in his hold. \u201cI also find your rebellious ways so endearing,\u201d he teased.He then laid her on the bed, glancing at her naked body in greedy lust as he hovered above her, trapping him within his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re so captivating, it\u2019s driving me crazy to be around you,\u201d he whispered to her, his voice dropping into a low octave, sending shivers up her spine at how hot and bothered she currently felt.She bit her lips, forcing herself to not make a sound. She just needed to endure it, it will be over soon enough, just like the previous times. And then she can go home again and forget.And so she turned away from him, and caught sight of the wall paneling on the side instead. She kept her eyes trailed on it as she heard the ruffling of clothes, and felt Matthias\u2019 warm body close to hers.She squeezed her eyes shut whenever he\u2019d brush up against her sensitive spots either intentionally or not.In Matthias\u2019 eyes, she was absolute perfection. The way her pale skin was in sharp contrast against his dark satin sheets, framing her so erotically as they rumpled beneath her nakedness. Her hair framing out of her head like a halo\u2026She was his own sculptured glass bird ornament, that hovered sensationally in his mind.He remembered stopping by a jewelry shop on his way to the train station. He had custom ordered a piece earlier, and came to pick it up. It was the crystal bird ornament, fashioned into a jewelry piece made only for Leyla.Just the sight of it was enough to send him back on a trip down memory lane, when Leyla had tried to reach up to touch the same ornament in the Natural History Museum. It was such a small thing, for Matthias it was trivial, but it was lodged into his memories.Nothing significant happened there, so why was he able to remember her smile so clearly?Matthias eyes went further south of Leyla\u2019s body, wetting his fingertips with his saliva, before dipping two slender fingers into her moist folds between her legs. Leyla gasped out at the intrusion, arching her back beautifully, her legs unconsciously spreading further to accommodate his body between hers.And yet Matthias\u2019 expression remained cooled and unchanged, so different from how any other man would be when presented with a woman\u2019s spread legs. His gaze kept watch of the way his fingers disappeared knuckle deep inside of her, before trailing up to her slender stomach, her pert nipples, and up to her sweaty face\u2026Beads of sweat were forming on Leyla\u2019s temples, as she stared at him in a dazed manner. Matthias leaned closer, pushing his fingers persistently back and forth, while his thumb rubbed up against her clit. Leyla released a sweet moan, rutting against his fingers in response\u2026\u201cLook at how accommodating you\u2019ve been to me lately, Leyla.\u201d Matthias breathed into her ear, before he began to remove his clothes this time.Leyla mewled as he rubbed circles against her, legs quivering when he curled the fingers in a come hither movement, scraping gently her inner walls. She couldn\u2019t help but watch in captivation the way his shirt slid off to reveal his tanned skin, and sinewy form, bracing his broad shoulders over her as he swiftly removed his fingers to shuck off the rest of his clothes.She gasped at the suddenness of his movements, letting out an instinctive whine when she was left with an emptiness. Leyla felt her heart thumping hard against her chest, watching him strip his underwear down, joining her in bareness.A shiver ran up her body at the sight of his picturesque beauty, before she caught herself and looked away in shame. But Matthias was quick to return to her, situating himself back comfortably between her legs, hiking them up on his shoulders to get closer\u2026She could feel his blunt tip brush up against her opening, making heat pool into her gut once more,And then he pushed\u2026Deeper, and deeper he went in,Leyla could feel herself opening up, stretching herself to embrace his girth. The sound of their\u00a0 bodies rubbing together was coupled with the creaking of the bed.\u00a0 Their breaths mingled with each other\u2019s and she mewled again when he brushed up against that sweet spot deep inside her until he was fully sheathed inside her\u2026\u201cI guess there\u2019s nothing else I can do to resist you too.\u201d Matthias piped up, staring down at her as he braced his shoulders on either side of her head. \u201cI quite like you being docile like this too.\u201d he confessed, before swiftly pulling out and then thrusted in.Leyla gasped, arching her back against the bed, pressing her chest up at his. Matthias kept up his slow paced thrusting, gradually increasing the speed with a gentle circling of his hips.\u201cTell me, Leyla.\u201dHe pleaded against her neck, as he dipped his head, suckling into her sensitive skin to leave a mark, the first of the many he planned to leave her with. He grunted when she felt him clamp down around him,\u201cUgh, tell me the truth.\u201d He hissed right at her ear, soaking it with saliva before pulling away, \u201cIf you hate me, really hate me as much as you claim\u2026 then why do you stare at me in such a way that tells me otherwise?!\u201dLeyla only moaned, shaking her head in denial, as her hands clambered to embrace him, pulling him closer to her as they continued to rut against each other\u2026\u201cTell me!\u201dShe could hardly be bothered to answer him, her mind muddled with intense pleasure as she desperately tried to shake the feeling away, rendering her speechless. Any sound she could make could only be incoherent, even if he demanded her for an answer.She bit down on her lip, and would have bitten it until it bled if he hadn\u2019t taken her lips into his and locked themselves in a kiss as he hoisted her up until she sat firmly on top of him, bouncing her in his lap, hitting deeper inside her in the most heavenly feeling she ever felt!She let out sobs when he pulled away from the kiss, leaving more marks on her skin as he busied himself with suckling on her collarbone.\u00a0 As their skins slapped against each other, Leyla couldn\u2019t help but reminisce about the time she\u2019d seen this man with a glimmer of hope around him\u2026It was back when she\u2019d locked eyes with him as he entered the drawing room. Claudine had been with him, hanging off his arm as a noble lady should. She had been ashamed during that moment, but the sight of him gave her some hope everything would be alright soon\u2026Yes\u2026hope\u2026And like a fool, she thought he would be that kind of man again.Now he instilled in her no hope, just more shame in herself. But she can\u2019t deny the intense pleasure he was indeed giving her.His hips began stuttering, he dropped them back into the bed, her legs unconsciously tightening around his waist to aid his thrusting as they both chased their own pleasures.Her hands tightened in their grip on his shoulders, nails digging into his skin in forming half crescent marks. It was like she was begging him to pleasure her further, to which he happily gave into.\u2018How could I let this happen?\u2019\u00a0she asked in despair to herself, before backtracking\u2026\u2018How could I have avoided this?\u2019\u201cAhh, ngh\u2026\u201d she moaned, turning her head away from him, when Matthias\u2019 hand gently gripped her jaw, to make her look back at him. He grinded up against her, making her moan in ecstasy and shame at how wantonly she responded to him\u2026She looked so erotic, with a flushed face and tears by the corner of her eyes. The sounds she made were music to Matthias\u2019 ears as he groaned at how she tightened up around him, engulfing him in her warmth he desperately craved\u2026He trailed his tongue up her cheeks to wipe the tears away, before diving his tongue deep into her mouth to get another taste of her. And then she came.Matthias knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on any longer when she coated him with her juices, and pulled out, just in time to release himself in spurts of white. Leyla watched as his hands drowned in white, unable to hold back the sigh of pleasure from her lips.It was like she was nailing down her own heart.She was a nobody. She was supposed to be just nobody to him. She was an orphan, with no riches to her name, nor future prospects. And once he\u2019d had his fill of her, she\u2019d go back to being just that.Nothing.She could still remember that moment in the drawing room.Claudine had thrown her arms around him so easily when he\u2019d appeared for her, while she had been in her shabbiest clothes, and not in her best looks compared to the girl. And yet he saw her\u2026And she regretted acknowledging how her heart fluttered at that fact.Untangled thoughts formed as she let a loud moan. Ecstasy and humiliation mixed with pain and pleasure in her thoughts and body. Although she tried a gallant effort to turn her head, Matthias refused to let her keep her last shred of pride.He firmly grasped her chin and redirected her gaze toward him. Tears streamed down her flushed cheeks from her twisted, innocent eyes. She gasped and moaned, and the look on her face as she did so set his heart aflutter.He\u2019d known she\u2019d begun to take over his thoughts for a while now. How could he not realize it when she was all he could think about when he\u2019d been away from Arvis?\u00a0\u00a0She became a constant presence in his thoughts at all hours of the day and night.\u00a0It was a strange sensation, something he\u2019d never felt before, and he couldn\u2019t place a finger on it.It was what led him to ordering something so intricate, so expensive that he knew she would appreciate it over anything else he could give her. A feeling that resurfaced whenever he\u2019d open up the box, and see that jewelry made only for her.When he\u2019d seen her, serving so lowly as Claudine\u2019s maid, in his own mansion , something surged in him. A need to rectify a situation that does not even affect him because it was Leyla. And he\u2019d never felt that way before.\u2018Why?\u2019Why did he?\u00a0\u00a0It was a question he couldn\u2019t ask anyone but himself, yet he was unable to answer.He shook the thought away, opting to focus instead on the after care of their intercourse. He pulled Leyla\u2019s limp, and oversensitive body closer, making her whimper as he brushed up against her.\u00a0 She was so exhausted by their coupling, she couldn\u2019t even lift a finger against him.All she wanted to do was to curl up beneath the covers, or go home and do that and cry. She had grown warm during their activity, and now with the sheen of sweat on her skin, she could clearly feel the cool air against her skin, cooling her body down.Matthias pulled away from her, and headed to the showers, leaving her alone. She heard the faint sound of running water, and thought he was taking a shower when it shut down, and Matthias came back.He sat down on the edge of the bed, closer to where she was. She wondered what he was planning to do now, and tried to open her eyes to glare at him. She saw him sitting beside her, with a basin filled with warm water, and some cloth in his hands.He set them down on the bedside table, and reached out for her hand, pulling it closer towards him.\u201cN-no, I-\u201d Leyla began to protest when he hushed her gently. Looking at her with an indecipherable expression.\u201cStay still.\u201d He commanded her, and Leyla watched as he dipped the cloth into the warm water, wringing out the excess water, and began wiping her down, gently pressing the warm cloth against her skin as he cleaned her body.She grabbed his hand instinctively in panic, when he softly patted her head, whispering sweet nothings at her. Her grip on his wrist loosened up, allowing him to continue.\u201cJust lie still and be quiet Leyla,\u201d he whispered softly, as he scrubbed away the drying fluids all over her body. \u201cThis will all be over soon.\u201d he finished.Gently, he wiped her down, her inner thighs, her stomach, her arms\u2026Even her neck and face got taken care of. Each brush against her skin was purposeful and gentle. He was diligent, and his touch didn\u2019t stray, or made her feel like he was doing this as a precursor to another round of intercourse.It was enough to make her heart skip a beat, before her eyes fluttered close, as his gentle strokes lulled her to sleep.Lub-dub \u2026 lub-dub \u2026 lub-dub\u2026She faintly wondered if she dreamed that musical laugh of his as she drifted into a dreamless sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOnce Matthias was content she was fully clean, he tossed the used cloth into the silver basin, before tucking himself behind Leyla, and hugged her back to his chest. It was crystal clear to him that he\u2019d left marks against her porcelain skin. He opted out of covering them with a blanket, wanting to admire her body some more as the warmth from the fireplace adequately kept the biting cold away.She was sleeping soundly in his arms, and he couldn\u2019t help but admire the hickeys left on her body. They had been fading since, and he made sure to mark the same spots as before.She shuddered when a strong gust of wind breezed past them, before snuggling closer into him, letting out a satisfied smile when he tightened his arms around her. Still, she remained asleep.Matthias continued to pet her, rubbing some friction on her skin whenever she\u2019d shiver, and smiled to himself when she\u2019d calm down at his touch. It was nice seeing her so content with him for a change, even if she was asleep.His hands drifted down, snaking past her waist and down between her legs.Leyla frowned when he brushed up against her still sensitive nub, and her eyes fluttered open, looking over her shoulder to glare at him. \u201cStop!\u201d she hissed, trying to twist away from him, causing Matthias to chuckle in amusement.\u201cI said stop! We\u2019ve done enough already!\u201dShe grabbed tightly onto his wandering wrist and pulled it away from her nether regions and glared back at him in defiance. Even now, he still confused her by the sudden changes in the way he\u2019d treat her back and forth.There had been previous times they had gone on for more than just one round, but Leyla loved to forget it, quickly washing the memories off her mind whenever she\u2019d shower once she got home.It wasn\u2019t that having sex was painful for her, in fact it was the opposite that made her worry.It was getting increasingly difficult to deny herself the pleasure she was feeling during the activities. And every time they\u2019d do it, she found her body more and more into it.Fortunately, Matthias did stop attempting to push his fingers into her, instead wrapped his arms around her waist, while casually tucking her head against the nape of his neck as he turned her body towards him.They were both locked into an intense stare-off with one another, making her look so petite compared to him. She was looking up at him with wide eyes, as a blush rose on her cheeks by how close they were.He was looking at her with those soft eyes once more. And it made her heart skip a reluctant beat.His hands moved back to her waist, giving her a gentle squeeze. He hiked himself up, and looked down on her face, tracing her features with a finger, before pulling away when he saw it made her uncomfortable.\u201cCome with me to the capital.\u201d he whispered softly to her, a twinkling look in his eyes as though he was begging her to say yes. His hand stroked at her gently as Leyla refused to believe it was anything but a demand from him.\u201cWhy should I?\u201d she asked rather harshly, narrowing her eyes at him in contempt. It must be increasingly difficult for him to keep his mistress in Arvis, especially with the wedding drawing closer.He probably wanted to move her quickly to the capital too, which would be best to do while he\u2019s not yet tied down to Claudine.\u201cI remember you told me once you wanted to go to college there.\u201d he supplied helpfully, and Leyla couldn\u2019t help but scoff at him.\u201cSo what? You want to send me off to college?\u201d she asked incredulously, and Matthias nodded without a second to hesitate.\u201cIf you wished to, I would.\u201d\u201cHa, no thank you.\u201d Leyla huffed at him angrily, \u201cI don\u2019t want to add up my debts to you, and make you use it against me further.\u201d she reminded him, turning away from him successfully, pulling the covers around them to cover her body.Despite her bravado, Leyla couldn\u2019t help but shudder at the animosity he was emitting behind her.It was like she just stabbed him, by the way she casually threw his good intentions into his face, and implied she was selling him her body. A tense smile came over Matthias\u2019 lips as he stared icily at Leyla\u2019s back.She knew exactly where he would hurt, and how to make it hurt worse. Such a clever bird he has, but Matthias was not her master for nothing, and he\u2019d make her see it! If she wanted to believe they were in a give-and-take transaction, then he\u2019d make it so!\u201cYou think our bedtime activities would be enough to pay for college education? With your pisspoor performance?\u201d he spat back harshly, before grabbing her by the head of her hair and slowly pulled him back towards him, making her gasp as she grabbed onto his wrists, looking positively frightened\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t grow cocky of yourself Leyla, it doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d he warned. Her eyes blinked back unshed tears and she gulped.\u201cThen why are you even offering?\u201d she asked him in frustration, face flushing in embarrassment. Matthias hummed as he thought deeply how to answer her.Truth be told, he didn\u2019t have any ulterior reason why he wanted to fund her education. He just thought she would appreciate the opportunity, and he had the means to make it true. He could have just as well given her a mansion of equal value, but she wouldn\u2019t appreciate that as much as a chance to be educated in her dream school.\u201cBelieve it or not, I wanted to give you something out of kindness for a change.\u201d he told her plainly, looking at her with cold eyes when she barked out a laugh in disbelief, refusing to believe him.Deeming she had enough of his farce, she moved to get out of bed when he held her back, keeping her in place.Matthias couldn\u2019t believe just how brazen she\u2019d become. While she grated at his nerves with her persistent rebellion against him, he much preferred it to the puppet-like behavior she had when she had been serving as Claudine\u2019s aide, or in her death-like state as she curled in on herself in a cold, and darkened room.Yes, she does possess a bull-headed stubbornness, but he liked this better than her helpless demeanor.But that was just amongst the many things he couldn\u2019t even begin to comprehend whenever he was with her.The whole matter with Claudine was unavoidable, he knew that. She was his fiance, she had every right to be irked, and he had every duty to put Claudine\u2019s needs above Leyla\u2019s\u2026But it was unbecoming of him to openly embarrass Claudine in front of their noble acquaintances, even if it had been in an underhanded manner. After all, no matter what she did to Leyla during those past few days was less worse than what he\u2019d been doing to her for weeks!But even his entire deal with Leyla wasn\u2019t going as smoothly as he wished. And he didn\u2019t know how to make it so.So he just kissed her, then and there, despite the way Leyla tried to dodge his advances, he just took, and took until the lust returned to him because it was all that made sense to him right now.Leyla felt that warmth pooling in her once more as he spread her legs around his waist. Instinctively she grabbed him around the neck as he adjusted them, and in one swift move, buried himself balls deep inside her, making her moan against his lips.But instead of resisting him this time, Leyla allowed his slow and gentle thrusts to continue as he pulled away. He rested his forehead against hers, and they locked eyes on one another. She knew deep down, the Duke was ever doing things that would give him pleasure. This was no different.But to send her to her dream college out of the kindness of his heart? Ha! The thought was ridiculous, it made her laugh.\u201cYou\u2019re lying\u2026\u201d she gasped out, when he hit into her deeply, moaning at the contact. \u201cAll you do is lie\u2026\u201d she protested, stifling back the escaping sounds of pleasure from her mouth.Matthias\u2019 hips stuttered in their movements, before resuming at a quicker pace as he held onto their eye contact, trying to rid her of that hateful gaze directed at him. Her hold on him tightened, as her anger was blanketed with a wave of increasing pleasure\u2026She threw her head back in an unstoppable mewl, her hips moving in tandem with his, before she looked back at him resolutely with her own icy stare\u2026\u201cI know everything about you now Duke.\u201d she gasped against him. She thought she saw a hint of hurt in him when she called him a liar, and she wanted to drive that nail further into him even as he had her caught up in pleasure.\u201cYou\u2019re a liar by heart.\u201d she moaned, biting into his shoulder, before pulling away when he hit her in that sweet spot once more. \u201cAll of you is a lie\u2026\u201d she sighed, and began to lose herself in the pleasure.Matthias smirked disdainfully over her shoulder, his thrusts quick and deep into her, before swallowing whatever words she had for him next with a hungry kiss.Perhaps she was right. Maybe he was lying. Maybe his entire persona was just a lie. But he\u2019d been living in the pretense of that lie too long now\u2026He didn\u2019t even know where the real him lies, or if it was even there anymore.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The next day, Leyla woke up early in the morning, and washed her face. She stretched her limbs to get rid of the lingering soreness from last night\u2019s events as she changed her clothes and got ready for the day.Just as she was about to begin her chores, a knock came at her door, startling her. With a frown, she went to open the door, and was greeted by the sight of Claudine\u2019s maid.Leyla stood there in shock, unaware of what she should do, when the maid suddenly bowed down in front of her.\u201cI\u2019d like to apologize, Miss Lewellin, for my indiscretions.\u201d the maid began, before straightening up, to present her hand, which presented Leyla with a healing gash. \u201cI lied to my mistress that I couldn\u2019t work, and that led you to be inconvenienced because of me.\u201d She explained, though there was a stiffness in her.Even when she was a child, Leyla could tell there was something a little bit off about the maid, despite having done her no wrong and continuously being polite towards her.She was a little perplexed by the apology she was receiving now, but she wasn\u2019t entirely surprised by this turn of events. She suspected something along the lines of this, but even if she did turn out right, Leyla had no will in her to confront Claudine about it.In her mind, she deserved that little bit of unkindness from Lady Brandt.\u00a0 And nothing would have changed if she insisted on them to check if the maid was really unable to do her job.As children, Leyla grew to fear Claudine because she knew she was a countess\u2019 daughter. Had she in any way disobeyed the girl, she feared the repercussions her Uncle Bill would take because of it.But now she was in trouble instead, and it was a stronger fear to someone else.And the whole thing about making her a temporary servant, well, it wasn\u2019t worse than the fact she was sleeping behind her back with the woman\u2019s fiance. Leyla felt like a thief in the night, stealing something that isn\u2019t supposed to be hers. It didn\u2019t matter that she was\u00a0 blackmailed into it.She still did it of her own volition, and in her eyes, and the rest should they discover it, it is still, undeniably, an affair.The rest of the maid\u2019s apologies to her were very polite and courteous towards Leyla. But she couldn\u2019t hide how stiff her movements were, as if she\u2019d rather be serving her mistress than be apologizing to Leyla.And as Leyla looked into her eyes, she saw something more.When the maid was finished explaining, Leyla accepted the apology, and the maid went on their way. Leyla shut the door once she was back on the road, before it clicked in her mind what she saw in the maid.A hint of anger and disdain\u2026She knew it because she\u2019d lately seen it reflected in her eyes. But it wasn\u2019t directed to the duke, no\u2026 this was directed towards her.Lost in the thought, wondering what she could have done to offend the maid, she found herself sitting on top of her bed, when a sickening feeling came over her\u2026\u2018Don\u2019t tell me\u2026.,\u2019Leyla gasped, bringing a hand up to her mouth,\u2018Does Claudine know after all!?\u2019\u00a0she thought in absolute panic.Her stomach churned uncomfortably the more she mulled over the thought. Just then, something bright was reflected at her, and Leyla winced when the light hit her eyes. She turned to look, and saw it was the jewelry box the Duke had given to her last night right before she left the annex.There it lay innocently on top of her bedside table.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dLeyla remembered asking when he\u2019d given it to her. She had turned it over in her hand inquiringly, refusing to open it.He\u2019d taken it out of his coat pocket when she started clothing back up. She was busy picking her clothes, and looked up in shock when he\u2019d suddenly stood in front of her, with the box in an outstretched hand.\u201cOpen it.\u201dHe implored her, grabbing her hand to put the box gently in her palms, closing her fingers around it. She then reached out for her glasses, and wore it on her face to see it clearly.She gasped in shock when she opened the lid, and revealed an intricately designed bird, with golden wings. It was a pendant, clipped to a chain that could be worn. It was laid artistically against the red velvet box, as though it was nesting in it, ready to take flight.It oddly reminded her of those crystal birds she\u2019d seen decorated over the arched aisle of the Museum back in Ratz. They were so beautiful to look at too!She almost dropped the masterpiece when the implication came over her. She refused to believe he was giving this to her because of that day!She looked up\u00a0 at him in disbelief, and saw the way he also regarded the intricate design in a fond manner, before they locked eyes. And not a second later, the emotion she read from him was gone, making her believe she just imagined it.\u201cWhy are you giving me this?\u201d she demanded from him, but it came out in a wobbly voice, just above a whisper.Did he really remember that moment? Did he make it because of that? For her?!\u201cI know you like it.\u201d he answered plainly to her, bringing her an odd sense of disappointment when he elaborated no further. Leyla only grew more confused, desperately stamping out the blooming hope and adoration in her chest.He can\u2019t do these things!He can\u2019t just expect her to swoon back into his arms, as though the past weeks were nothing! She won\u2019t let him! She refused to let him!Her breathing grew ragged, worrying Matthias who stepped closer to look at her, and see why she was reacting in such a way to his gift. She tried to look away from him, but he\u2019d grasped her chin, and made her look up, searching her for an answer\u2026\u2018No!\u2019\u00a0she had thought at the time, and swiftly shut the box to a close and handed it back out to him. Matthias\u2019 eyes narrowed at that action, but remained silent, not moving to take it back.\u201cI don\u2019t like it anymore.\u201d she had spat back at him, holding her chin up high as she glared up at him, \u201cI don\u2019t even need it. So just take it back.\u201d she told him, \u201cThrow it away if you must, cause I don\u2019t want it.\u201dMemories of the cool crystals beneath her fingertips rushed to her mind. There were so many of them in that museum, and she had been so happy when she found that the Duke had lifted her up so she could reach out and enjoy them.But that moment was meaningless in the face of recent tragedies. It was gone, and she could never go back to that foolish girl before.Matthias had stared at the velvet box in silence for a long time before he finally turned away from her, before he turned back. There was a tension in his body that Leyla hadn\u2019t noticed before.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you throw it away yourself?\u201d Matthias challenged, glaring right back at her in that indifferent stare. He then turned on his heels, and left her alone in his room with a loud bang, echoing throughout the empty halls of the annex.And then they parted ways after that.She didn\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t throw it away when she\u2019d left the annex. By all rights, she should. But something in her wanted to keep it.She couldn\u2019t just let it go, that Leyla that had been so carefree before, she wanted her back. She wanted to be her once more\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a pretty good adult.\u201dUncle Bill had once told her, so confident in her future. She\u2019d believed him when he told her that, but now it was like she was being choked up by her shame and disappointment in what she\u2019d become.Not wanting to look at it anymore, Leyla grabbed the box, and hid it deep under her bed. She may not be able to throw it away, but she can keep it out of sight, and out of mind until she would forget about it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was currently sitting in front of her vanity, her aide brushing up her beautiful locks, and making sure there were no tangles in them. Things were silent between them for a while, until Claudine broke it.\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that, Mary.\u201d Claudine began, and met her aide\u2019s eyes in the mirror. Immediately, Mary gently put the brush down on the table, before kneeling beside her mistress and took her hands in hers.\u201cOh please don\u2019t say that my Lady,\u201d she said to Claudine, looking up at her with tearful eyes, \u201cIt was my fault really, I should\u2019ve behaved more properly, and have not troubled you so!\u201d Claudine only smiled kindly at her.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault but mine,\u201d Claudine replied calmly, \u201cAnd yet I let you take the blame, when it shouldn\u2019t have been you who got in trouble.\u201d she sighed, and then stood up gracefully.She went in front of the floor-length mirror, Mary following her dutifully, as she assessed how she looked. She was preparing to greet the Crown Prince and his wife. She must look elegant in doing so, even if she was just one of the hostesses in the estate.\u201cTruly, I won\u2019t forget what you did for me back there,\u201d Claudine told her when she turned back around, \u201cThank you so much Mary, I mean it.\u201d Mary\u2019s eyes welled up with tears at how kind and beautiful her mistress was to her.Mary had been one of House Brandt\u2019s servants who\u2019d been with them for many years. Though in all her years of servitude, this was really the first personal gratitude she received from her ward. It broke her heart to see her mistress so helpless back there.Her Lady, Claudine Brandt, should have the right to hold her head up high, as she belonged among the proud noble family of a Count. Which was why she couldn\u2019t hold back her thoughts on the matter\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s all because of Leyla, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked her mistress, who blinked at her before shaking her head in finality.\u201cDon\u2019t bother thinking about it Mary.\u201d she dissuaded, because really, it wasn\u2019t like it should matter much to her. Satisfied with her appearance, Claudine and her aide exited her chambers to walk around the mansion, inspecting some last minute preparations.It would be a while before the royal couple would actually arrive, but Claudine couldn\u2019t stay cooped up in her guest room as she waited for them. So she decided to go strolling along the still-renovating greenhouse, careful not to dirty her clothes among the dirt and debris.The general sight was still the same, but at least the new repairs were beginning to take shape, as the framing of the wrecked parts were almost in completion. She turned towards the solarium afterwards, wanting to visit the place where the plants and birds that survived had been moved to.The sight of the greenhouse only served to rile her up, her anger at the careless gardener returning, when a familiar voice caught her attention amidst all the noise around her. She turned around, and saw Riette, smiling expectantly at her\u2026\u201cMy Lady, it\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d he greeted her, lightly grabbing her hand, to press a kiss on her knuckles, \u201cAre you feeling better today?\u201d he asked her in genuine concern. They hadn\u2019t seen each other in a while, and Claudine could only smile at him.They both sat down at the table in front of the solarium, where the sweet scent of the flowers wafted over them, and the soft singing of birds replaced the incessant construction noises.\u201cI\u2019m feeling much better, thank you for asking.\u201d Claudine replied sweetly at him, he only beamed right back at her.\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d he then sat himself down from across her, and they began conversing. Each of them was regalling the other with tales of what they did when they were away, Riette more so than Claudine, when she steered the topic to something else.\u201cTo be honest, I think the entire problem was because of Leyla.\u201d she admitted to him, \u201cThe rest of it was simply a stupid idea.\u201d Riette sighed, and looked around them, before leaning closer to her, and lowered his voice.\u201cI think you worry too much,\u201d Riette tried comforting her, \u201cUs men do crazy stuff when it comes to women, believe me, sooner or later his appetite will curb.\u201d Claudine couldn\u2019t help but laugh dryly.\u201cIf he were like other men, I wouldn\u2019t be this worried.\u201d she pointed out, \u201cBut this is Matthias we\u2019re talking about.\u201dAt that, Riette couldn\u2019t form any rebuttal, because it was true. Matthias wasn\u2019t like any other man Riette knew or met before. His early arrival had been unexpected. And to the rest of their companions that day, Matthias had only acted like a true gentleman should with his fiance, and defended her honor successfully against the deceitful maid.That brought a bitter taste to Riette.\u201cHave you ever seen him so attached to anyone before?\u201d she asked him curiously. Riette sighed tiredly at the question.\u201cNo,\u201d he answered without hesitation, \u201cI don\u2019t even think he\u2019s attached to his mother.\u201d Riette pointed out. It was a bit of an exaggeration, Riette would admit to himself, but never out loud.\u201cI just can\u2019t get my head around why he\u2019s so invested with a servant girl.\u201d she exclaimed, making Riette look at her tiredly.\u201cTechnically speaking, Leyla isn\u2019t a servant in Arvis.\u201d he pointed out dryly, making Claudine roll her eyes at him.\u201cDetails.\u201d she scoffed, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what she is, my question remains the same.\u201d She took a deep breath to calm herself down. \u201cI should have realized sooner he\u2019d lied back then, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019d been so blind.\u201d she muttered softly, scolding her past self for her incompetence.On that past summer morning, Claudine had seen Matthias walking alone, on that day someone had broken into the gardener\u2019s cabin. She initially thought he\u2019d be headed to the annex, which was along the way. She had been there earlier, cutting some roses for that flower arrangement she wanted in the garden, when she decided to follow him, curious as to what he was doing so early in the morning.All she knew was that Matthias didn\u2019t want anyone to visit him when he went by the annex, which only made her curiouser to what he really did back there. So with a basket full of roses, she followed him.He moved quickly through the forest, and Claudine struggled to keep up with him, when she saw the most unexpected sight in front of her. Matthias had halted in his tracks, and so she followed his gaze, and found out why.Walking towards him was an unfamiliar man. She\u2019d never seen him before as any of Matthias\u2019 associates, and quickly hid behind one of the trees. Something was telling her she should not have witnessed this.It wasn\u2019t out of character for Matthias to meet with random strangers, Claudine knew she couldn\u2019t know everyone he made business with, but she could tell this was different. And then Matthias resumed walking, not even stopping again when the man passed him by.She had stayed there for a while, confused as to what she just saw before she opted to return back to the mansion instead. It wasn\u2019t long until they received word that Leyla\u2019s money, which was for her tuition, had been stolen.The officers had come by asking questions around the Duke\u2019s residence, and Claudine found herself invested in the matter as well, when she saw them questioning Matthias. When they asked him if he\u2019d seen any suspicious individual around the estimated time of the crime, Matthias denied having seen anyone.She knew he\u2019d seen that man, but she couldn\u2019t piece together why he had lied. She opted back then it was best not to contradict him, but she did suspect it was because of Leyla. Which she now believed was the right and only assumption to what happened back then.After all, the real culprit had been revealed as Mrs. Etman, who was against her son\u2019s marriage with the poor girl from the very beginning. And she\u2019s certain her fiance wants Leyla for himself.Claudine had laughed mirthlessly to herself when she found out.Her fiance, the Duke, was wasting his time devising elaborate schemes, just to keep a servant girl by his side? She shuddered at the thought. He even went as far as destroying one of Leyla\u2019s best prospects.She had thought Matthias von Herhardt was going to be different from the other men she had the displeasure of knowing. But alas, he\u2019s just another one of those sleazy types, who thought they could get away with a mistress on the side. How dare he try and compare her to Leyla?She felt absolutely mortified and humiliated when she realized he sought things she could not give from someone of a lower stature than her!As though sensing her growing turmoil, Riette broke the silence between them, to get her to listen to him.\u201cFret not Claudine,\u201d Riette called out to her, pulling her from her thoughts as she looked back at him, \u201cEven if he is attached to the girl, Matthias is practical. He knows she\u2019s not fit for the role as his Duchess.\u201d\u201cYou really think so?\u201d she asked him softly, the worry imminent in her eyes, and Riette reached out to clasped her hand comfortingly over the table.\u201cI know so.\u201d Riette told her, \u201cHe\u2019d be a fool to choose her over you as the Duchess.\u201dBut Claudine still seemed convinced that something was bound to go wrong. And Riette couldn\u2019t have her getting in trouble like she did just a short while back then.\u201cI get that you\u2019re worried, but I advise you to let them be.\u201d Riette pleaded with her. \u201cMatthias doesn\u2019t get love!\u201d he pointed out, making Claudine frown at him.\u201cWhat do you mean by leaving them alone?\u201d\u201cLook,\u201d he sighed, \u201cSooner or later, his actions will make him lose her. So just let their affair exist as is, don\u2019t bother trying to break them apart sooner.\u201d\u201cAre you that confident he\u2019s that unaware of his feelings for her?\u201d she asked him sharply, and he nodded confidently.\u201cHow could he? He\u2019s never been in love before.\u201d he rebutted, \u201cAll his life, he\u2019s been given what he wants without really having to work for it, and then quickly discards it when it\u2019s no longer his fancy.\u201d\u201cI still don\u2019t think he\u2019s that unaware of his feelings.\u201d Claudine scoffed, when Riette held onto her hands tighter.\u201cClaudine please, I tell you this with utter concern for you,\u201d he held her gaze, hoping she will understand he\u2019s only saying this for her own good, \u201cDon\u2019t try to provoke Matthias, it won\u2019t end well.\u201dHe wants to see his most beloved succeed in her life, even if it means she has to be his cousin\u2019s wife, he\u2019d make sure nothing would stand in her way.He couldn\u2019t help but laugh dryly at himself at how pathetic he was becoming. Nevertheless, he truly wanted her to be happy. And as she was determined it would be as the Duchess Herhardt, he\u2019d be happy to spend time with her in whatever way she can spare for him.Just like at this moment.\u201cDon\u2019t do what you did to Leyla again,\u201d he warned her, \u201cThat could only push Matthias to see what she truly means to him.\u201d Claudine stared at him curiously, prompting him to elaborate, \u201cA person\u2019s heart is a fickle thing, my Lady,\u201d he smiled ruefully towards her, \u201cOnce you realize you\u2019re in love, you can\u2019t stop loving them so easily.\u201d\u2018Just like I can\u2019t stop loving you.\u2019\u00a0he confessed to her in his mind.Suddenly, there was a rush of commotion outside, making Riette pull his hand away from her. Not a minute later, Matthias strode in, all dressed in his best suit and nodded towards his cousin, before holding a hand out to Claudine.\u201cWe must make haste, my Lady,\u201d Matthias told her urgently, \u201cThe Crown Prince and his wife are about to arrive.\u201dGone was that cold look he\u2019d thrown at her when he cornered her in front of their noble acquaintances. He now wore a graceful smile and polite gestures for her instead, and Claudine couldn\u2019t help but flutter her eyes beautifully up at him in response.She took his gloved hand with a smile.\u201cOf course, my Duke.\u201dMatthias nodded to him briefly, and quickly, the pair walked out of the solarium, leaving Riette to smile bitterly to himself at their retreating backs.What a pair they made.He shook the unbidden thoughts of Claudine and his cousin together, opting to just get up and get ready for the royal couple\u2019s arrival as well. He arrived shortly after the engaged couple, joining the line of nobles who were there to greet the prince as well.Somewhere off to the side, Riette caught sight of Leyla, amongst the other commoners, who were out to greet the prince as well.The royals\u2019 car came to a stop right in front of the mansion, and flashes went flickering left and right as photographers fought to get a good angle in capturing the Crown Prince\u2019s arrival.Despite being a friend of the Duke\u2019s, the visit was an official event, as the Crown Prince was officially touring the entire Empire. They had to follow some protocol to welcome him officially into Arvis.Leyla had been to many of these official visits before, but never one as extravagant as this one. Case in fact, the larger crowds gathered around her, and the amazing reception prepared for them.Though she was among many people, Leyla stood with the crowd in anxious tension. She anticipated she\u2019d see the Duke of Arvis, along his arm would be Lady Brandt. And she did see them when they arrived. They were front and center of the Prince\u2019s welcoming committee after all.They looked graceful, and poised. All powerful and calm in front of the raging crowd. It was difficult for her to connect him with the passionate man she\u2019d been with every night, as opposed to this dignified persona of his.Tonight, he was a nobleman.Something was stinging in her eyes the more she watched Matthias and Claudine standing there together, welcoming the Prince with happy smiles. They descended the steps, hand in hand as they exchanged pleasantries with the Crown Prince.She could tell they were close, never mind she couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying from where she stood. Even Lady Brandt seemed well acquainted with the Prince\u2019s wife.She glanced down on her uniform, adorned with the Herhardt\u2019s insignia. She unclasped her hands in front of her, and tucked them behind her instead as she felt herself beginning to tremble.She wasn\u2019t holding onto anything, but they trembled as she felt the ghost of a feeling beneath her fingers. It was achingly similar to when she\u2019d stroke them against those crystalline figures in the museum.It also achingly reminded her of the coin purse\u2019s heavy weight in her hand when Claudine had the maid pay her.She kept her head bowed down low, staring intently on her shoes, as the Crown Prince and his entourage climbed up the steps. She sighed in relief when they passed her by, and finally looked up, before freezing in place\u2026Lady Claudine was looking right at her. She was smiling brightly in her direction, and Leyla\u2019s hand tightened around her fingers as the ghost weight felt heavier and heavier in her hands.She could even hear the loud way the coins jingled as she moved.And so she stood there, amongst the crowd in the pale afternoon sun, casting long shadows over her frozen form.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMrs. Grever\u2019s house was located a little farther from the Capital city. During its rapid development, much of the neighborhood was turned into an idyllic rural setting, equipped with well-maintained roads for ease of transportation. Flanking the roads were rows of beautifully made houses, constructed with wooden frames and paneling.Leyla decided that today was as good as a day to pay her a visit. She had bought a beautiful array of a bouquet to bring with her as a gift, along with a jar of jam that was made with the best summer fruits harvested in Arvis.She drew closer to Mrs. Grever house as she commuted towards the center of the boulevard, where she could see the green-roofed house. She had her transport stop a few blocks away, before she gathered her gifts into her arms.She then rang the doorbell as soon as she got in front of the door. She waited for a few moments, hearing muffled sounds of footsteps getting closer, before the door swung open to reveal Mrs. Grever. The older woman beamed at the sight of her, ecstatically inviting her inside.\u201cOh Leyla! I\u2019m so glad you finally arrived!\u201d Mrs. Grever greeted, \u201cWhen you told me you would be visiting, I couldn\u2019t help but get up earlier than usual.\u201d she immediately began telling Leyla, \u201cI apologize in advance if I seem a little tired.\u201dLeyla only smiled at her pleasantly, before she looked around.\u201cAm I the last one here?\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but ask consciously, before looking down on her wrist-watch. She didn\u2019t think she arrived too late, in fact, she was ten minutes earlier than the appointed time of their meeting. Mrs. Grever only waved her worries away.\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not even late.\u201d she told Leyla, and waved her over to follow her to the dining room, where everyone was gathered, \u201cThe others just got here a little too early, they\u2019ve all been eager to hear about the Crown Prince\u2019s arrival from you.\u201dLeyla blinked in surprise, before she saw her fellow young teachers gathered around the table, chatting amicably with one another. Upon her arrival, they all turned to look at her, before greeting her excitedly, immediately making space between them for her.Even Mrs. Grever seemed to anticipate her tale about the Crown Prince\u2019s arrival with his wife. Leyla couldn\u2019t help but feel a little bit overwhelmed by the expectation. She wasn\u2019t really paying attention to the prince and his family as much as she was looking at the Duke in anticipation.When she asked them what they wanted to know about the Crown Prince\u2019s arrival, they wasted no time bombarding her with questions, one after the next like excitable little children.\u201cTell us about the Crown Prince! Did you really see him?!\u201d\u201cDid you see his wife?\u201d\u201cI heard they had twin babies! Were they there?!\u201d\u201cOh I wish I could have gone, you\u2019re so lucky Miss Lewellin!\u201d\u201cYeah, I only saw the pictures in the newspaper, it must have been a sight to see in person!\u201dLeyla looked from one person to the next, before she laughed awkwardly, holding her hands up in a placating manner as she tried to get them to calm down a little bit.\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much help I could be, I was some ways away from the entourage after all.\u201d She then held up one of the newspapers lying on the table with the pictures of the Prince\u2019s arrival, \u201cThe pictures here though seemed really detailed, I couldn\u2019t even see this much from where I was standing.\u201d she pointed out.\u201cOh boo-hoo!\u201d piped up one of the younger teachers, \u201cWhat matters is you got to be there in person!\u201d they squealed.\u201cYeah!\u201d The others agreed readily.\u201cOh, aren\u2019t the Duke and the Crown Prince best friends or something?\u201d another piped up in the middle of the conversation.Leyla\u2019s stomach dropped at the mention of the Duke, and cold sweat began to escape her temples at the anticipation of where this conversation was going. Fortunately, Mrs. Grever had the foresight to give her a glass of water when she had sat down on the table.She grabbed it nervously, staring at it resolutely while she took a sip of water. The other teachers seemed to be content letting her be for now, which she was thankful for. The conversation between the teachers flowed easily between the Crown Prince, the Duke and even Marquis Lindman.\u201cWell personally, I think the Duke\u2019s the coolest between the three.\u201d Mrs. Grever haughtily declared among the young teachers, \u201cDon\u2019t you agree so too, Leyla?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Leyla blinked, finally back to the conversation, as she noticed the others were now quiet as they waited to hear her answer.\u201cI said the Duke\u2019s the coolest among the three, don\u2019t you agree too?\u201d she prompted, looking expectantly at Leyla.\u201cOh, now that I think about it, Leyla\u2019s met them all in person now!\u201d\u201cHey, that\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cShe could tell us better who\u2019s cooler between the Crown Prince, Duke Herhardt and Marquis Lindman!\u201dLeyla looked like a deer caught in headlights. She looked back and forth at them with a nervous smile on her face as she struggled to formulate her words.\u201cI, I\u2026\u201d she began to stutter, when one of her fellow teachers answered on her behalf.\u201cI think Leyla\u2019s opinion is a bit biased Mrs. Grever,\u201d they pointed out, \u201cThere\u2019s no question she\u2019s going to choose Duke Herhardt, after all, he practically saved her uncle.\u201dShe quickly nodded along to the teacher\u2019s words. She knows they mean it well, and they were all just having pleasant fun, but at the mention of her uncle, the conversation shifted into praising the Duke\u2019s action for dropping the charges.Her heart sank the more she listened in\u00a0 on them.\u2018A savior they say?\u2019\u00a0she couldn\u2019t help but think rather bitterly in her mind.\u00a0\u2018If only they know why he dropped them.\u2019The rest of the visit went by without a hitch, allowing Leyla to enjoy the company and food when the conversation about the Crown Prince and Arvis died down, and shifting to school and their student shenanigans.They all parted ways with light hearts and a full stomach, bidding their host, Mrs. Grever goodbye, with a promise to return sometime soon.Upon her way back home, Leyla decided to stop by at a grocery store along the way. Supplies for home were running short, she should stock up while she\u2019s still outside.As she passed through the entrance, she wasn\u2019t surprised to see another one of those newspapers with the Crown Prince\u2019s arrival as a headline displayed in the front rack. However, the picture on it made her heart flutter, along with an unfamiliar pang in her heart\u2026On the centerpiece of the headline, was an image of the Crown Prince and Duke Herhardt shaking hands, while smiling towards the cameras. Beside the prince was his wife\u2026And beside the Duke, was Lady Brandt.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*In the few days that the Crown Prince and his wife were in Arvis, it was filled with a long life of parties and dinners to attend. Fortunately, the Prince had stated he wouldn\u2019t attend more gatherings until the dinner event to be held in the Herhardt Family\u2019s mansion.This allowed the busy atmosphere to die down in Arvis, giving the servants some room to breathe, as well as their hosts. Come luncheon time, the Crown Prince was accompanied by both Matthias and Riette.The Crown Prince regalled them with the current events around the parts of the continent he recently toured. Riette had been lying languidly across the sofa, while the other two sat on wing chairs. As he listened attentively, he couldn\u2019t help but interrupt the Prince politely.\u201cForgive my interruption, your highness,\u201d Riette began and the Prince nodded for him to continue, \u201cI can\u2019t help but realize that most of the noble families in the continent are bound by blood.\u201d\u201cYes, that is true.\u201d the Prince nodded.\u201cWell then, shouldn\u2019t the discord between their families be easily resolved, taking that fact into consideration?\u201d Riette asked in all seriousness, despite the ease of his current position. The prince could only smile, albeit a little sadly at his opinion.\u201cYou would think that would be the case, but the opposite is true in this case,\u201d the Prince explained, \u201cIn most of history, it\u2019s the arguments between families that end up having brutal aftermaths.\u201d he sighed resignedly, before looking over at the Duke.Matthias had been content to sit out of the conversation. He just remained sitting on his wing chair, as he stared intently into the flames cackling in the fireplace. The melody of the waltz danced around them in soft volumes. His feet tapping along with the beat, head swinging along as he relaxed.But the Crown Prince had a keen eye, and he\u2019s been observing the Duke for some time now. He knew the more quiet the Duke got, the more his mind was being troubled.\u201cAnd what of your thoughts Captain Herhardt?\u201d the Prince called out, making Matthias snap his eyes over to his two companions.\u201cYou\u2019ve been on the frontlines before, what do you think about the looming threat of a war in the continent? Are we able to win it this time around as well?\u201d Riette asked, finally sitting up, genuinely curious about his cousin\u2019s thoughts on the matter.Matthias breathed in deeply, running simulations in his head as he also straightened up in his seat. His finger drummed on the arm rests, staring into the flames with a frown, before he turned back to his two companions.\u201cI don\u2019t think things will be as easy as the previous ones this time around.\u201d Matthias admitted calmly.\u201cThe tensions between Berg and Lovita are simple, and we do stand a good chance of winning,\u201d Matthias began to elaborate, \u201cBut the scale of a war between the two won\u2019t be kept small.\u201dThe Crown Prince hummed in dry agreement, having already known about that, the royal family\u2019s war council already making the same predictions.\u201cI thought as much.\u201d the Crown Prince sighed, as a sullen air settled around the three of them.Riette hadn\u2019t been wrong when he pointed out all the nobles had some blood relations with each other. If you\u2019d trace them far back enough, you can tell which side they\u2019re connected to.But the fighting between the powerful families in the continent was growing day by day. Each one has garnered multitudes of connections through the generations. They\u2019ve cultivated these connections, and treaties have interlocked with each other.It was just one mess growing bigger the more it spread down the line, affecting many more families and businesses within the empire. Soon enough, the war between two regions would become a war for the whole continent.\u201cWell, look on the bright side, Your Highness,\u201d Riette interjected when he noticed the gloomy atmosphere, \u201cThis threat has been going on since my father\u2019s time. Still there\u2019s been no actual war happening. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll breeze past through this until we\u2019re all old and gray with nothing ever really happening.\u201d Riette joked about, before he stopped and sighed.\u201cAlthough in the event it does happen, we\u2019ll be there in the middle of it, aiming to return as war heroes!\u201d Riette proudly declared, making the Prince chuckle good-naturedly at his attempts to lighten the mood.\u201cBy the way Riette,\u201d the Prince began as he regarded the Marquis with a thoughtful look, \u201cYou\u2019re looking a little too serious there yourself. Where did our Riette go?\u201d he exchanged looks with Matthias who only shrugged back at him, \u201cYou\u2019re making me all nervous with being all proper!\u201d the Prince teased.Riette gasped in an exaggerated manner, before mockingly swooning on the couch as he shook his head, while he lay back down on the sofa.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to show my disgracefulness in front of such an esteemed figure!\u201d Riette gasped out loudly, making the Prince bark out in laughter at Riette\u2019s dramatics. And just like that, the air was lifted around them as the Prince was thrown back in pleasant nostalgia.Even when they were children, things were always like this.\u00a0 And though many years have passed, and they spent time less and less with each other as their responsibilities grew, the Prince was glad that they could still behave like this around each other as though they were kids once more.Matthias had smiled and responded accordingly with the conversation, before leaving them both to their own devices as he decided it was more interesting to look out the window. He had noticed Leyla had gone out in the late morning, and was eager to catch sight of her return.She had been dressed beautifully today, that was enough to make him forget about their last conversation. That one had been grating across his thoughts painfully and insistently since she left him.\u2018So she didn\u2019t like the gift, huh?\u2019\u00a0Matthias thought, as a tension settled in his jaw. She wasn\u2019t happy with the gift he presented her with.If it was true that being useful and pleasurable in company was the true worth of a mistress, well, Leyla\u2019s been the farthest example of that by far. He could dig deeper into his thoughts as to why he\u2019s so reluctant to let her go, but it doesn\u2019t seem worth it to him.All he knew, and was comfortable to understand, was that he just wanted to keep her beside him for as long as possible. Even if it meant enduring the endless hate she spewed at him. He\u2019d keep her by his side until his dying breath.She was his alone, and his to use. No one else\u2019s. His little canary.A devious smirk gave way to his lips as he took a careful sip of the lukewarm tea.He could still feel the ghost of her locks running across his palms; still see the silhouette of her quivering form due to his ministrations; hear the echoes of her voice as she gasped and moaned because of him\u2026The more he got to know the inside and out of Leyla Lewellin, the prettier she got in his eyes.Especially if she was in tears. Which reminded him, it had been a while since he last made her cry for him.Just the thought was enough to make him grip his cup tightly, as the urge to seek her out and see her tears grew inside him. Matthias couldn\u2019t understand his obsession with her. It was like he was going crazy without her, and he had no will to stop it from happening.Their first night together had been pure bliss for him. All of his senses drowning in her essences, embracing him in a way he always sought for, yet so much better!His thoughts and feelings drowned in her, and he happily let it overtake him if it meant he\u2019d get to have her for himself. At that moment, she was all he could process, as though she was the only thing in the world he needed to be alive\u2026To feel alive.In his research in taking care of a bird, he\u2019d stumbled upon the knowledge of covering the bird\u2019s eyes, and cutting off their feathers from their wings. The bird would tremble in your palm as you prevented them from seeing you trim their wings\u2026And when it\u2019s all over, they would flap to fly, but found they could no longer go that far away from you.Matthias had perfected it on his little canary bird. He\u2019d dutifully covered the little canary\u2019s eyes with a soft piece of handkerchief, as he trimmed the feathers. He\u2019d watch as they fluttered to the ground with satisfaction before blowing it a kiss and removing the blinds as he showered it with clear affection, before letting it rest inside its cage.Lately he found the strange urge overcoming him. When his canary nestled lovingly in his palm, he wanted nothing more than to close his fingers around its trusting form\u2026And then squeeze it. But then he\u2019d catch himself, and focused on the beautiful songs his canary would chirp for him, and the urge would go away.The same urge kept coming whenever he\u2019d hug Leyla. But unlike his canary, who\u2019d sing to ease him, she endlessly refused him. She kept struggling to escape him, and that just made him want to see her cry, and stop time just so he could cherish those tears flowing out of her\u2026The only ones she seemed to freely give him.But he desired to have her, take all of her and keep her for himself. If he could, he would have swallowed her all up in one go during their sexual intercourses.\u201cMatthias?\u201dMatthias was brought back to the present at the sound of his name. He looked to the sides, and saw his companions looking at him inquiringly as they both stood beside him. Only then did he notice the gathered servants in front of the open door.It seemed he got a little too distracted by Leyla after all. He didn\u2019t like being caught unaware like this.He put the cup down gently, before standing up, brushing off their inquiring gazes at him as though it was nothing.Finally, it was dinner in the Arvis Mansion, and the servants began to escort them towards the dining room, while Matthias waited in the back to lock his study.Just before he\u2019d close the door behind him, a stray thought wandered into his mind.\u2018Had Leyla come back?\u2019\u00a0he couldn\u2019t help but wonder, feeling a strange worry come over him at the thought she hadn\u2019t returned yet. Which didn\u2019t make sense to him. After all, where else could she return to but here?He swiftly shut and locked the door before he decided to go back to his room to prepare for dinner.As he walked through the long hallways, with the fading sun casting orange hues in the walls, he can\u2019t help but think about her again. A cold dread settling in his gut at the thought of her not coming back\u2026\u2018What if she decides it\u2019s not worth it coming back?\u2019Reaching his room with his attendant, Matthias wasted no time changing as he mulled over that thought.Leyla couldn\u2019t dare leaving Bill Remmer on his own. She looked up to him her whole life, she couldn\u2019t just up and leave him behind.\u2018But if it meant she could leave me, then\u2026 could she?\u2019\u00a0Matthias wondered instead.Would she really leave? Because of him?His movements halted just as he was about to secure his cuffs. The cold feeling grew inside him. He could tell it was anger, or nervousness. He\u2019d felt those before, and this wasn\u2019t it.\u201cMaster?\u201d his attendant called out worriedly when he noticed Matthias\u2019 movements paused. Immediately, his master\u2019s movements resumed, quickly finishing securing the cuff links and turned around, to have his coat buttoned up.Once Matthias had buttoned up the coat around him, the attendant busied themselves with brushing some stray dust and flint all over Matthias as his master stood still in front of his floor-length mirror.Matthias was thinking about the first time he tried trimming his canary\u2019s feathers. The little bird struggled incessantly in his grasp, making him cut more than he should, causing blood to ooze out its wings.He\u2019d been worried at first, but was relieved to find his canary alive by the next day. He liked knowing it couldn\u2019t fly away from him. Adored the pitiful sight of its struggles in fact. It wasn\u2019t until it fluttered nervously towards him, and chirped beautifully for him that he got the sense the bird loved him.It\u2019s feathers would grow back, but even if he were to accidentally cut more than he should, the bird loved him. It regarded him as their home. It wouldn\u2019t want to leave him.Though he can help but think it would be better if the bird couldn\u2019t fly permanently too. He wouldn\u2019t need to put it in a cage, he\u2019d just let it wander free forever in his sights. They\u2019d be freer that way too.\u201cYou\u2019re all set, master.\u201d The attendant called out to him once more, bowing his head dutifully at Matthias.Matthias took one last glance of his appearance in the mirror\u2019s frame, before nodding to the attendant in satisfaction. He casted another glance outside his bedroom window, looking over the fading shadows of the trees that stretched across the road the further the sun set in the skies\u2026Leyla was still nowhere to be seen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he followed after his master, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little perplexed by his recent actions.He\u2019d been working in the Arvis Mansion for many years now. He\u2019s filled up every position, from a lowly servant, to an apprentice to the head butler, Hessen, down to the Duke\u2019s attendant. He\u2019d been them all. He\u2019d witnessed many things about them too, but not this.This wasn\u2019t the Duke he was accustomed to.He\u2019d noticed it for a while now, how unfocused his master had been, even in the presence of the Royal couple. It wasn\u2019t like him. The Duke had always been attentive, even though he pretended not to be interested. So when he spaced out back there, Mark could tell something was amiss for his Master.Suddenly, Matthias stopped, startling Mark by his sudden change.His master was turned towards the window, his gaze resolutely looking out the window with an intense look in his eyes. Mark couldn\u2019t help but follow his gaze.And there, he spotted her just as she was passing through the garden, basking in the fading light of the sun as the skies gradually darkened, was Leyla. She was headed for the forest path, located just behind the mansion as she carried a large bag in her arms.Mark opted to wait for his master patiently, instead of breaking his reverie for them to get to the dining room promptly. Leyla must have gone grocery shopping, and was now just returning. Though her load looked rather heavy. It mustn\u2019t be, for she was walking at a leisurely pace, neither in a hurry nor struggling.\u2018She\u2019s back,\u2019\u00a0Matthias thought with a certain relief,\u00a0\u2018Leyla\u2019s returned.\u2019\u00a0Matthias remained looking at her beautiful figure, enamored by the sway of her french braid with every step she took further into the forest.It didn\u2019t escape Mark\u2019s notice how the stiffness in his master\u2019s form slowly eased out of his shoulders the longer he stared at the unsuspecting girl. She didn\u2019t even bother looking towards the mansion.Matthias gaze trailed over her body, taking in every detail. Like the way her coat and skirt fluttered with the winter breeze, revealing some of her porcelain leg\u2019s fair skin. He watched as she paused for a while, shaking something off of her before continuing on her path.Belatedly, he remembered it was supposed to be colder than usual today, and he couldn\u2019t help but frown at her carelessness. She must have been commuting too, because she wasn\u2019t pedaling her way back home, which meant she walked all the way from the entrance of the estate.\u2018What a foolish woman, trying to brave the cold with such a heavy load on her shoulders.\u2019\u00a0Matthias mentally berated her. Deciding he\u2019s had enough, he resumed his pace, and continued on his way to the dining area.But even though he walked away, his mind stayed resolutely on the retreating woman.Even the sight of her was enough to call attention to those unfamiliar sensations he\u2019d been feeling around her lately.\u201cThere you are, my Duke!\u201d Claudine greeted him brightly as she came forward to welcome him into the lounge area, where their other guests were currently assembled at. Matthias politely smiled back at her, offering her his arm before she snaked her own over his forearm.His arrival drew the attention of the crowd as they all welcomed him back.\u201cYou were taking too long, so I decided I should go look for you.\u201d Claudine informed him, \u201cI got worried something happened, it isn\u2019t like you to be late to these events.\u201d she pointed out. Matthias absentmindedly patted her gloved hands.\u201cI apologize, my Lady, for worrying you.\u201d he said, looking down at her indifferently, \u201cI took longer than expected to be prepared for dinner.\u201dClaudine regarded him carefully for a moment, before giving him a small smile.\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to know you\u2019re alright, after all.\u201d she then turned back to their guests, pulling away from him. She conversed with each and every one of their guests naturally with ease. Matthias observed her in a pensive manner.She was going to be the perfect Duchess. A fact he was glad for, and couldn\u2019t deny. Still, his thoughts kept returning to Leyla. His eyes kept trailing to Claudine, following her movements in the room as she drew closer to his mother, and grandmother, who were close to the Crown Prince and his wife.The light from the fireplace casted a faint orange glow all over the lounge\u2019s occupants.Marriage was just another business transaction in their circle. The more powerful or influential the family, the better. This was true for him as it was with anyone in his shoes and Claudine was the best candidate he was presented with.A marriage to her would just cement the Herhardts more into their place of power. But was that all marriage was?He wasn\u2019t one to question his decisions, so why was he starting now?There was a flickering of light from the room\u2019s chandelier, before it brightened up the room indefinitely. Matthias, along with the other guests, squinted at the sudden brightness. Seconds later, Hessen came into the room, announcing that dinner had been served.One by one, their guests made their way to the dining room, leaving Matthias as the last one to leave.There in the middle of the lounge, he could see clearly the portraits of his predecessors, as though they were staring at him.As though they sensed how he was wavering.\u201cMy duke?\u201d Claudine called out, who looked back at him, and Matthias wasted no time in catching up with the rest of his guests, escorting his fiance down the stairs and through the long halls leading up to the dining room.It was fortunate that Matthias had enough foresight to have the generator as one of the first to be repaired. It made the chandelier in their dining room look more majestic, showing off it\u2019s exquisite shine as it basked their guests in a bright white glow.On the long table were rows of their best silverware and cutlery. In the middle of the table was lined ornate candelabras, along with a few cut orchids in vases and some sculpted desk ornaments.All this served as reminders for Matthias that he was a powerful person. He\u2019s the Duke of Arvis, and is well-respected, and highly regarded in both society and among royalty. He had all this in his possession\u2026And yet his mistress walked in freezing temperatures on uneven ground. He could almost imagine her back in her cabin, sitting alone in front of a shabby table, with a poor excuse of a fireplace illuminating her.\u201cDuke Herhardt.\u201d Claudine\u2019s voice called out for him, taking him out of his reverie, and looked over to her. She wordlessly gestured over to the seat in front of him.It was odd. He\u2019d known her since they were children, yet all of a sudden, it was like he was in a room filled with strangers.\u201cMatthias?\u201d Claudine called him softly once more, looking up at him in a confused manner. He acknowledged her once more, before finally taking his own seat, along with a few others.Dinner was just beginning.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The royal couple stayed in Arvis for a total of five days before they finally moved on.On their last day, all of Arvis\u2019 employees lined up in front of the mansion as they all bid the royal couple and their entourage goodbye. Leyla had been part of the group, and stood with the same crowd she was with on the day of their arrival.The security made things such a hassle to move along, but there was also a sense of dismay in the air once they realized their guests would be leaving.In all that time the Crown Prince and his wife were in Arvis, Leyla had not been visited by the Duke, at all. It was almost like he even forgot about her. He sent her no note, not even from Phoebe. There was also no summon for her.She just got to live her recent days worry and stress free from the Duke. The past few days made her feel like she did before this whole affair started, back when she was just Leyla, her uncle\u2019s ward. The days were peaceful for a change.And she loved it.She couldn\u2019t help the hope blooming in her chest. Perhaps these few days were enough to make the Duke rethink about keeping her as his mistress. Maybe he\u2019s finally grown tired of her! After all, his obsession with her made absolutely no sense!Maybe he was just taken with her because he finally found something he couldn\u2019t have for himself, and now he finally did, he\u2019d gotten bored once more.She couldn\u2019t help the smile on her face, believing this would be the day she\u2019d be free of him at long last! He was a prideful man after all. He couldn\u2019t bear to stay with her ungrateful disposition and terrible bedside manner towards him for too long.In her relief at the prospect at the end being within reach, she failed to look away, just as the Duke turned his eyes towards her direction. She knew he was looking at her, and he knew she saw him back.There was that odd sensation running over her body once more, finally making her lower her gaze from him in trepidation. After a few more seconds, she looked back up to him, and saw he was no longer looking at her.Instead, he was busy exchanging farewell with the Prince, with Lady Brandt by his side. Another familiar feeling welled up in Leyla, but she couldn\u2019t put her finger in it.Soon the procession of the Prince\u2019s farewell ceremony ended, and they all left Arvis. Leyla watched on the sidelines as Matthias offered Claudine his arm, and began escorting her inside, with their own entourage following them in suit.The rest of the employees sighed in relief now that their important guest was gone, and things could return back to normal. Leyla remained rooted in place, as the buzz around her grew louder when they all began chatting amongst their respective groups.Somewhere behind her, Leyla could vaguely hear a couple maids gossiping with each other in whispers.\u201cI just think they should have stuck with the schedule.\u201d\u201cI know, they shouldn\u2019t have to push back the wedding.\u201d\u201cLady Brandt is practically the Duchess already, isn\u2019t she?\u201dLeyla felt uncomfortable with their conversation, feeling her heart beating fast at the new information. She silently stepped away from them, and returned back to her own cabin. It didn\u2019t matter what news about the Duke\u2019s wedding was.She fully believed that their time together was running out, and that almost made her skip in her steps for joy! Soon, she can finally work on convincing her uncle to leave Arvis, and she could forget this whole kerfuffle had ever happened!Yes, they would move to the farthest place from Arvis, one where no one knows her, or has even heard of Arvis. Maybe she won\u2019t get to go back to the way things were entirely, and maybe she\u2019ll have to work twice as hard to get their new life in order, but no hardship could hold a candle to the suffering she was now facing.With her world starting to fall in place, Leyla wasted no time in diligently doing her chores, humming happily as she scrubbed the stain out of their laundry, brushed their floors clean. She even baked herself some jam cookies! She hadn\u2019t felt that urge in a long time now.As soon as they finished, she took them out to cool on the rack as she grabbed her book, and poured herself some tea to enjoy the cookies with. She sat leisurely for the first time since the accident at the green house, and read her book as she gobbled up the cookies with no problem.She paused reading after a while, deciding to pen some of her friends who had recently sent her letters. When she just finished sealing the last of her letters, a knock sounded in front of her door, followed soon by a familiar voice.\u201cLeyla! Are you in there?\u201dIt was her friendly, yet equally nosy neighbor, Mrs. Mona.\u00a0 Leyla went out to greet her with a beaming smile.\u201cAh, Mrs. Mona!\u201d Leyla greeted before gasping at the large basket her neighbor was holding, \u201cWhat a feast you got there!\u201d she exclaimed, and Mrs. Mona smiled sheepishly.\u201cOh, I was a bit worried about you dear,\u201d Mrs. Mona sighed and went in as soon as Leyla stepped aside, \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re a grown woman now, you should be eating a lot more by now.\u201d she then breathed in, sniffing the faint smell of cookies in the air, \u201cAh, but I see I shouldn\u2019t have been too worried.\u201d she smiled at Leyla, who only laughed good naturedly.\u201cWell, I did learn from the best.\u201d Leyla praised at Mrs. Mona, who preened at the implication. Leyla led her to their kitchen, and began preparing her some tea.Mrs. Mona did take it upon herself to teach Leyla how to cook when she had been younger. She taught her what to do around the kitchen, following her instructions as best as she could until she became a very skilled housekeeper.It felt as though the warmth was returning in their small cabin, and Leyla couldn\u2019t be happier.They sat across from each other, sharing stories as they chatted back and forth between tea and their sweets. Mrs. Mona was doing the most of the talking, while Leyla took her sweet time listening and enjoying the food.Mrs. Mona moaned as she took another bite from Leyla\u2019s baked cookies.\u201cThese ones really came out delicious, dear.\u201d She praised, \u201cAny man who marries you would be very lucky!\u201d she added as an afterthought, before pursing her lips as she looked back over at Leyla, \u201cSpeaking of, about Kyle-\u201dLeyla quickly cut her off.\u201cOh, that\u2019s because you taught me so well yourself, so really this is all you!\u201d Leyla exclaimed, grabbing a snack from the basket, \u201cPerhaps you can come over next time when I\u2019m baking cakes, and then you can tell me if they\u2019re of any good!\u201dMrs. Mona eyed her carefully, knowing full well Kyle was still a sore topic on the girl. And she looked so happy today, she didn\u2019t have the heart to be the reason it disappeared, not when she was looking so relaxed the last couple of days.\u201cWell then, you\u2019ll have to let me know when you decide to bake them so I can make sure to stop by.\u201d Mrs. Mona conceded, taking another bite of the cookie, moaning at the deliciousness.Everyone was curious and worried at the slow progress of Kyle and Leyla\u2019s reconciliation, but perhaps that was a worry for another day instead, Mrs. Mona decided.So she proceeded to complain to Leyla about the intricate and picky dishes the aristocrats had her cooking in the mansion. They were very picky and snobbish. The kitchen staff never had to worry about so much before, but alas, they had to. They were hosting very important people after all, and nothing but the best should be served!Still, that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t bemoan the stress they had put on her.\u201cPity that the Brandt girl decided to stay behind,\u201d Mrs. Mona grumbled, \u201cI thought she\u2019d be leaving by now, along with all the guests.\u201d she huffed in a pout. \u201cIn all honesty, I don\u2019t know why she insists on staying in Arvis, when the master isn\u2019t even around to entertain her.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Leyla piped up at the mention of Matthias, \u201cThe Duke is not in Arvis now? What for?\u201d she asked curiously and Mrs. Mona nodded.\u201cYes, I think it was something about a business, I wasn\u2019t too privy with the information.\u201d Mrs. Mona was quick to answer, \u201cBut he left for the city, just after the Crown Prince and his entourage did. He won\u2019t be back for a few days, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d She informed.Leyla tried to subtly breathe a sigh of relief at the knowledge.The Duke would be gone for a few more days! Oh this was just the best piece of news she received in forever!\u201cUnfortunately, the Duchesses Norma and Elysee insist on Lady Brandt remaining in the pretense of discussing wedding arrangements.\u201d Mrs. Mona scoffed, \u201cIn all honesty I\u2019m sick and tired of having that snobbish lady around! She\u2019s the pickiest eater I\u2019ve ever met! Doesn\u2019t she know how to just eat what\u2019s being served? Honestly.\u201dThey continued to chat, until Mrs. Mona noticed how late it was getting. They bid each other goodbye, and finally, Leyla was back alone in her cabin. But unlike the aftermath of Mrs. Mona\u2019s visits, Leyla remained in a good mood, and easily finished the cookies left of the place.Each crunch had crumbs breaking off the cookie, and Leyla just dusted them off from her clothes, deciding she\u2019d sweep them clean later. Today was a good day, and would continue to remain good in the following days after all.\u2018Thank god!\u2019\u00a0Leyla sighed in relief as she resumed humming to herself in unabashed bliss.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe schedule was tailored to be finished within four days at the least, but Duke Herhardt was able to finish it all within three. To do that, he took on more work within shorter time frames, and even less breaks over the past few days.Mark Evers had never felt as exhausted as he did as soon as he sunk into one of the hotel\u2019s plush chairs as he waited in the lobby. His master was currently in a lunch meeting, which was the last of their meetings.He glanced out of the hallways\u2019 window, looking outside.The Duke had received invitation after invitation from prominent businessmen and nobles located in the city. Oddly enough, he made sure to instruct them to make his time free after his schedule was done. Though it didn\u2019t take long for Mark to figure out just what he planned doing in his free time\u2026Or rather, who he was planning to spend time with.The answer always pointed back to Leyla Lewellin.Just this morning he received summons from his master, commanding him to send a car over to Arvis with specific orders to be discrete, and bring the gardener\u2019s foster daughter to him. He didn\u2019t know what it was for, and Mark wouldn\u2019t dare question his master.It wasn\u2019t proper after all.The car would have reached Arvis by now, so it won\u2019t be long until Leyla would arrive.Mark didn\u2019t know why he had to be discrete, and he didn\u2019t want to assume anything. Though he wondered how long he could hide his master\u2019s activities? He can\u2019t help but be filled with nervous energy at how precarious his current situation was.Bill Remmer was a force to be reckoned with, and Mark was intimidated by him, but he doubts the gardener knew what his foster daughter had been up to. The same could be said for his mistresses, the Duchesses Norma and Elysee, along with the soon-to-be-duchess, Lady Brandt.The recent events were nerve-wracking!What should he do if they were to be found out? What should he say? Was he even supposed to say anything?!It didn\u2019t even seem like his master was at all concerned about being found out though. He might have been told to be discreet, but overall he had been calm and relaxed when giving the order. What had Leyla gotten herself into?Mark knew this thing happened all the time, but it was a different thing knowing about it, and becoming unintentionally involved because of\u00a0 employment. Additionally, this was Matthias von Herhardt he was talking about!He had been the perfect gentleman all this time and now Mark was seeing a growing scandal in his master\u2019s clean slate! He\u2019d known him long enough to believe he had nothing to worry about on his master\u2019s behalf, but now he was utterly so!Mark couldn\u2019t help but chuckle to himself softly in despair. What a predicament he\u2019d entered. He leaned his head back to rest against the back of the chair as he looked up at the ceiling.His master would be fine, Mark was sure. But the one who would take the brunt of the scandal, should it be revealed was Leyla. If his master was planning on exposing themselves, what did he plan to do with Leyla?Mark pushed himself forward, and hunched in on himself, his elbows resting on his knees as he stared at the ornate pillars around him, and the marble sculptures being displayed. His gaze landed on a green patch in the garden.In the flowerpot, fresh green leaves bloomed beautifully, despite it being in the middle of winter.Bill was just around his father\u2019s age too. They aren\u2019t really close, so to speak, but he was well aware most of the servants employed were in good standing with the man. He was in no doubt the same could be said about Leyla.After all, among them servants, she was dubbed as the beloved child of Arvis.A little too grand for a mere orphan who ended up being raised by their well-respected gardener, but it wasn\u2019t like anyone minded. Never mind, Leyla wasn\u2019t the only child who grew up among their community. There were plenty others.But no other servant\u2019s children were as highly regarded as they were with Leyla.They grew up together, raced and played in the muds of the garden and forests; bathed in the river and ran through the fields of Arvis together. She was beautiful though, Mark could faintly admit. He sometimes thought of her as a fairy whenever they\u2019d run into each other as children.He vaguely remembered wondering if she found happiness in the prospect of marrying Kyle? Would she be happy living as his wife? But then things went wrong, and their engagement broke off.He remembered voicing his thoughts on the matter with Hessen.\u201cChoose your words carefully, Evers,\u201d Hessen had softly warned him back then, \u201cIt is not in our place to hold judgment over their actions.\u201dAnd Mark never brought it up again.Shortly after, he was appointed as the Duke\u2019s attendant, by courtesy of Hessen\u2019s recommendation. But when he met with his superior, Mark knew what Hessen really meant, and why he was placed as the master\u2019s latest attendant.\u201cDo nothing but your task, Evers.\u201d Hessen had reminded him once more, \u201cNothing more, nothing less.\u201d The ominous warning rang through his head, and he\u2019d kept it to heart even to this day.Did Hessen know? Was this what he meant when he implored Mark to not ask questions?Suddenly, the group of men he had been waiting for entered the lobby, and Mark immediately stood in attention and walked over dutifully to the Duke\u2019s side. The last meeting was finally done for the day.Mark could tell his master was also feeling quite fatigued, despite his cool and calm demeanor. Matthias turned to him, quirking up a brow, wordlessly asking for an update about his task.\u201cI sent for Miss Lewellin just before lunch had begun, master.\u201d He quietly informed. \u201cI expect them to arrive around tea time.\u201dMatthias gave him a terse nod. Mark thought he saw some color return to his master\u2019s cheeks, but he wasn\u2019t too sure.\u201cI\u2019ll send her up to meet you in private as soon as they arrive, master.\u201d Mark quickly added, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take this time to rest your feet as we wait?\u201d he calmly suggested.Matthias swiftly bid his companions goodbye, before nodding back to answer Mark\u2019s question. \u201cSend her up to my room, where I\u2019ll be waiting for her then.\u201d he ordered, to which Mark bowed to him in acceptance.\u201cAs you wish, master.\u201dHe must have been more tired than usual because of how hectic the last three days had been, yet Matthias remained tall and proud as they returned back to their place. Mark couldn\u2019t help but feel a little bit ashamed at thinking badly about his master.Perhaps this wasn\u2019t anything but a casual meeting between acquaintances?This was Duke Herhardt and Leyla he was talking about after all. They were both respectable people in their own fields, they couldn\u2019t be doing that. It was downright insulting to even entertain thoughts about their perceived infidelity!\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, Evers.\u201d the Duke interrupted his thoughts, bringing Mark back to reality as he hurried closer to his master\u2019s side, \u201cI have one more request for you.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla\u2019s eyes had turned cold as she looked outside the window as soon as the car rolled to a stop. She expected something would happen with the Duke when he returned, she just didn\u2019t expect him to send over for her.The chauffeur had come with instructions from Mark Evers to bring her over as soon as possible. And so when all was set, he drove as fast as he could to return without garnering any attention from the onlookers as he delivered his cargo\u2026And that cargo was Leyla.When he first arrived, Leyla was ready to get into an argument, and even refused a couple of times to go with him. Unfortunately, he also came bearing a letter from the Duke, which left her with no choice but to comply in the end.What neither Mark Evers, nor the driver knew, were the contents of the letter, and how it convinced Leyla to go along.The chauffeur had been curious initially, but that curiosity soon went away as he rushed through traffic on the road back to Carlsbar. He didn\u2019t know how soon was \u201ctoo soon\u201d. The attendant never specified.Mark waited anxiously for their arrival, wondering why they took so long to return. When he finally saw the car rolling in, he hurriedly met them at the bottom of the steps. The chauffeur immediately got out of the car.\u201cMr. Crook, I was getting a little worried because you were running late!\u201d Mark exclaimed, \u201cWhere\u2019s Leyla?\u201d he asked right after. The chauffeur only bowed to him in apology.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Mr. Evers.\u201d he then opened the door, to reveal Leyla in the back seat.Leyla had been amazed by the extravagant sight in front of her, quickly thanking the chauffeur for opening the door before she resumed sight-seeing.Mark on the other hand, felt flabbergasted by the sight of Leyla.She was dressed poorly! He couldn\u2019t help but internally scream aghast at her state of dress!First off, it was winter, hence it would be colder than usual. So what wasn\u2019t she in a coat? Instead, she only has a small, flimsy shawl wrapped around her shoulders! And the apron, don\u2019t even get Mark started on the apron. It was visibly dirty, having dark stains across its yellowed white fabric!It seemed even the driver was embarrassed at how poorly she was dressed, to meet with their master as he avoided the attendant\u2019s gaze.\u201cMiss Lewellin\u2026\u201d Mark trailed off, unable to voice his disbelief. Leyla seemed unbothered by her clothes as she finally looked at Mark with a steely gaze.\u201cSo this is the place he wants me to be in?\u201d she asked Mark, who was still too stunned to speak, \u201cAm I even allowed to enter the premises?\u201dMark had to reluctantly give her an affirmation, still worrying about her clothes.\u201cWell, then, what are we waiting for?\u201d Leyla asked no one in particular and just began to walk towards the entrance. Mark almost cried in despair as he hurried after her.\u201cWait, Miss Lewellin!\u201d he urgently exclaimed, wincing when his cry garnered the attention of the doorman, who also looked flabbergasted by the state of Leyla\u2019s clothes.Mark wasted no time in removing his long coat, and hurriedly draped it over Leyla\u2019s clothes. It wasn\u2019t that Leyla didn\u2019t look like she could be royalty, it\u2019s just that she wasn\u2019t dressed at all appropriately to enter the premises.He thought she would have at least changed out of her work clothes before coming over, it was only proper. But at least, wrapped up in his long coat, she at least looked a little more respectable with it on.The doorman at least had a little decency to say nothing about what he\u2019d seen, and allowed them to enter, before giving Mark a questioning stare. Mark only bowed apologetically before rushing to lead the girl up to his master\u2019s room.Leyla was nervous about being in such a high societal place, but she couldn\u2019t back down from Matthias.Mark proceeded to expertly dodge the crowds, carefully making twists and turns in a way that hid Leyla from the view of any passerby, and made sure to cover her face with some of the attention she caught.In no time at all, they reached the Duke\u2019s hotel room.Mark Evers straightened up, and knocked on his master\u2019s room.\u201cMaster, we have arrived.\u201d He called out softly. He listened in on the door, lightly pressing his ears against it, and heard a faint murmur coming from inside. \u201cMaster?\u201d he called out once again, a little more loudly, but enough to not disturb any nearby tenants.\u201cCome in.\u201d His master\u2019s voice sounded through the door. Mark straightened up, and took his copy of his master\u2019s door key and let themselves inside the room.Upon their entry, they saw Matthias lying haphazardly on the couch, with his eyes shut, before he opened them to look at his new guest. Mark could tell he was still a little drowsy from his sleep.With a sigh, Matthias then sat up on the couch, before he swept a hand from his face, and up to his hair, trying to rub the sleep off his face. When he looked up, he locked eyes almost immediately with Leyla.He frowned upon seeing another man\u2019s coat wrapped around her.Mark\u2019s eyes darted nervously back and forth from his master, and then to Leyla. He could tell there was some tension between them, and he could also tell he didn\u2019t want to be anywhere near them when it blew up.With a gulp, Mark bowed to Matthias in an attempt to excuse himself. After all, he\u2019s done his task, Hessen told him to do nothing more than what was being asked of him. He could finally leave right?\u201cI shall leave you alone now, master.\u201d he politely informed, before slowly backing up and turned to leave the room.\u201cOh, Mr. Evers!\u201d Leyla called out, halting him from his retreat. Mark reluctantly turned back around, just in time to see Leyla removing the coat around her, and handing it back to him with a smile. \u201cThank you for this.\u201d she said to him.Mark blinked back as he internally screamed. He tried so hard to keep her presentable for his master. But the Duke has seen it now, there was no point in keeping up with further pretenses.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Miss Lewellin.\u201d Mark replied with a stiff smile, before successfully leaving them both to their own devices to escape the thick tension in the room.As soon as they were alone, Leyla reluctantly turned around to face Matthias, who was still looking at her with a deepening frown. She felt blood rush to her cheeks in embarrassment, and clasped her hands in front of her.\u201cForgive me for my clothes, but you said to come immediately.\u201d she haughtily excused, refusing to appear nervous in front of him. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t hide the way her hands shook under his gaze.Matthias took a deep breath as he leaned back on the sofa. He placed a hand beneath his chin as he continued to look at her.Aside from the less than presentable clothes she had on, her hair was also wrapped in a loose braid. There were even a few strands that managed to escape its hold. And her apron, well, it hardly matched the cleanliness of her current surroundings.His eyes trailed down, and saw the creases on the bottom of her brown dress. Further down, on her feet she wore loose woolen socks, sagging around her ankles, and stained leather shoes. He couldn\u2019t help but chuckle in amusement over her poor state of dress.Leyla winced at the sound of his laughter.Matthias languidly got up from the couch, and stood on unsteady feet as he walked towards her. Even in his less than perfect gait, Leyla couldn\u2019t help but freeze in intimidation.\u201cYou never really fail to surprise me Leyla,\u201d he told her in a husky voice as he stopped just a step away from her, \u201cThat\u2019s what I like about you.\u201dHe could clearly see the fire in her eyes as she stared up at him. Her face was less pretty with a frown on, but he still found himself pleased to see her.\u201cYou think this is funny?!\u201d Leyla hissed at him, and Matthias shrugged before humming in agreement. She wasted no time in throwing the letter he sent her in his face. Matthias scooted away in immediate response, and watched the letter fall onto the floor.\u201cNow, now Leyla,\u201d Matthias tutted, \u201cHow could I not find you fun? You\u2019re so pretty all riled up, after all.\u201d he teased. Leyla scoffed at him, her body now shaking with brimming rage at him!How dare he smile as if it was nothing!? She wanted to swipe that smirk off his face permanently!Matthias then moved forward to touch her when she slapped his hand away!\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch me!\u201d she exclaimed, stepping away from him as she looked up at him with tears in the corner of her eyes. She had been shocked at how she managed to do that, but she couldn\u2019t let that stop her.\u201cHow can you stand there smiling at me as if it was nothing!?\u201d she asked him, \u201cAs if your threat was nothing but a joke to you!?\u201dMatthias blinked at that, before looking down at the crumpled letter on the floor. He frowned, before looking back at Leyla.\u201cWhat threat are you talking about?\u201dLeyla barked out a laugh hysterically.\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018what threat\u2019 ?\u201d she asked him incredulously, \u201cThose threats you made in that letter!\u201dMatthias could only stand in front of her as he stared at her raging form.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He put a hand in his pocket before brushing his hair up his forehead as he remembered the letter\u2019s contents.\u201cOh, you mean that.\u201d he finally said, breaking the silence between them. He let out a sigh, before giving Leyla an amused smirk, cupping her cheek with his free hand, and gripping it tight when she tried to brush him off once again. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even a threat.\u201d he lightly informed her.Leyla\u2019s eyes widened in incredulity before she scoffed up at him.\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t a threat then how should I have taken it?!\u201dMatthias shrugged at her.\u201cMaybe advice?\u201d he calmly suggested, \u201cOr maybe a reminder?\u201d he hummed in thought. Leyla only laughed partially in hysterics and disbelief at his audacity.She had been in a great mood these past few days, being away from him and his presence. Even the day had started out beautiful with their clear blue skies, with a warmer temperature in the middle of winter.So she had gone on with her business, enjoying her time away from any problems, a time she hadn\u2019t had much these past weeks with her being at the beck and call of the Duke. She didn\u2019t even receive as much of a note when he left so abruptly after the Crown Prince\u2019s visit.And all of a sudden, it didn\u2019t seem far-fetched for her to think that their time was coming to an end! Life was finally beginning to return to her usual peaceful days.She went out to pick some excellent dried sagebrush, and had gone to bake herself some fresh bread. Right after baking and eating, she had decided to clean her stove, airing out the kitchen as the smell of bread wafted out and about the cabin\u2019s kitchen.All in all, her day had been going great!Up until the time the inconspicuous car rolled in front of her cabin, sending alarm bells ringing in her head when she recognized the Duke\u2019s chauffeur stepping\u00a0 out, and headed for her front door. What else could he be here for, away from the Duke, if it wasn\u2019t for her?She tried blinking back his existence to her imagination, and might have pinched herself in the process. But he was real, and he was in front of her cabin. Hurriedly she answered the door, confirming the dreaded feeling in her gut what this all was for.\u201cGood day, Miss Lewellin,\u201d the chauffeur had greeted her when she came to the door, \u201cI\u2019d like to inform you that the Duke has requested your presence at the earliest time possible.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou can prepare yourself for a while, but I\u2019m afraid we are in a bit of a hurry.\u201d the chauffeur told her kindly, but Leyla\u2019s heart was thundering in her chest.\u201cWhere did he want to see me?\u201d she quickly demanded, narrowing her eyes at the chauffeur, who blinked at her in shock.\u201cI\u2019m to take you to the city, that\u2019s where he\u2019ll be waiting for you. It\u2019s why he sent me here to get you.\u201d he supplied helpfully, which immediately got Leyla to shake her head.\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, before finding her voice again, \u201cNo! I refuse to go there!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you!\u201dThe chauffeur regarded her carefully, before he gently pulled out a sealed note from within his breast pocket, and gave it to her as an offering.\u201cI\u2019ve been given instructions to give this to you as well Miss Lewellin.\u201d he told her as she accepted the envelope. Leyla quickly unsealed the letter, glancing through the contents at incredible pace.His message was clear to her. He was asking her, no, he was demanding her to remember why she\u2019s in this predicament in the first place.Do it for Mr. Remmer.An overwhelming sense of rage and humiliation came over her, neatly tucking the note back in the envelope before it crumpled in her shaking grip. He was treating her like nothing more than a toy, demanding her to do things according to his wishes, to go places he ordered her to go without further ado!It was supposed to be a relationship between just the two of them, but it seemed like he had no qualms revealing it to others after all. She never expected him to disregard her feelings as if they did not even matter.And it hurt her.She didn\u2019t want to go. She wanted to defy him, and make him wait for nothing! Except\u2026Do it for Mr. Remmer.She was left with no choice but to do it. For her uncle\u2019s sake, she will have to come to him, no matter how humiliated she was feeling right now. And that\u2019s why she moved, with no further ado, she got in the car despite the chauffeur questioning her appearance.She thought it was better for him to see him in such a measly manner. He\u2019d bore of her quicker once he\u2019s reminded just how different and below she was of him. It\u2019s her last act of pride before she\u2019d be fed to the lion for slaughter.Though she couldn\u2019t help but think of him cackling in amusement at her pathetic state too, and that made beads of sweat roll down her back.\u201cShouldn\u2019t a noble man like you be knowledgeable of things such as honor, dignity and common decency?!\u201d she spewed at him, \u201cHow callous can you be?! Using Uncle Bill like that against me!?\u201dStill, Matthias seemed to be unbothered by her ire, and it stung her.\u201cI know if I didn\u2019t remind you, you wouldn\u2019t have gotten in that car and come to me.\u201d Matthias explained coolly, still looking at her in that soft, unfamiliar gaze in his cerulean eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be a threat, Leyla. It never was.\u201d\u201cOh, forgive me for jumping to conclusions! How very gentlemanly of you to remind me!\u201d she replied sarcastically. Matthias only chuckled in amusement at her, and gave her a once over.\u201cWell, you\u2019re looking quite the exceptional Lady right now, my mistress.\u201d he smirked at her, \u201cSo it\u2019s only proper I become the perfect gentleman for you.\u201d he said in the low baritone, sending shivers up her spine at how husky he sounded.\u2018I should stomp on his foot to make a point!\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought belatedly to herself.She held his wrists tightly with both hands, resolute in glaring at him straight in the eye, until a knock resounded in the room. Fear seized Leyla\u2019s heart as she immediately thought to hide from the incoming guest, yet Matthias had no such qualms.\u201cCome in.\u201d He invited coolly, ignoring Leyla\u2019s look of panic, and casually sat back down on the sofa. Not a moment later, a maid swung the door open, pushing into the room a food-filled tray cart. Leyla immediately scooted towards the windows to retreat further into herself.Her movement caught the maid\u2019s attention, who seemed to flush in embarrassment at her dirty state. Fortunately, she made no comment, and continued to set out their food in a timely and efficient manner.When she was done, she excused herself right away, smiling gently as she bowed respectfully at them, leaving them alone once more. Leyla couldn\u2019t help but scoot closer to Matthias after the maid had gone away.\u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but ask him.On the table, there was food set. It had warm tea, along with an array of delicious food, that could be enough for two people to share. Matthias only gestured at the table.\u201cWhat else do you think?\u201d he asked her in faint amusement, mixed with a little teasing. He caught sight of the single piece of cake he had ordered Mark to add. It had a pink cream filling, and elaborately designed with pink and white icings.Mark Evers was getting more efficient in his job. He did well today.Matthias went to grab the plate, and held it out for Leyla to take.\u201cThis one is for you.\u201d he told her plainly, making Leyla grab it dumbly, \u201cMake sure to eat it this time.\u201d he ordered her before he laid back down on the sofa.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Leyla wondered in confusion as she watched him throw an arm over his eyes as he settled on the sofa.\u201cWake me up in two hours.\u201d he ordered her, while Leyla could only continue to watch him.\u201cWhat?\u201dWhen she received no reply, she put the cake down on the table and got around the sofa to hover over him.\u201cWhat are you doing right now?!\u201d she hissed at him in confusion. Matthias only hummed in reply, content in letting her go unanswered, but she hovered persistently over him.\u201cWell, seeing as you\u2019re my beautiful Lady right now, I should only treat you like one.\u201d He answered plainly, still keeping his eyes closed in an attempt to catch up on some much needed rest.\u201cI don\u2019t even want to be your lady!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a nice thought though, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense!\u201d Leyla complained, \u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d\u201cWell, if you\u2019re so adamant on not being my Lady, then I shouldn\u2019t have to act like your gentleman either.\u201d he told her in a drowsy manner, \u201cIsn\u2019t that the unspoken rule between us?\u201d he finally opened up an eye to stare up at her.Leyla felt her body freezing in response despite his vulnerable position. How could he have this much power over her?\u201cYou\u2019re staying rather suspiciously over there,\u201d Matthias commented lightly, \u201cPlanning to kill me while I sleep?\u201d he inquired. Leyla only frowned down at him as she took a deep breath.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d she glared at him haughtily.\u201cWell, make sure you succeed then.\u201d He softly challenged, \u201cBecause once you fail, it\u2019s my turn next.\u201d He gave her a miniscule grin, before shutting his eyes closed once more, finally falling into a world of sleep, with the warm afternoon glow basking them both in its fading light.Leyla could only stand there in hopelessness as she watched him drift into sleep. She could never understand him, not his words, nor the actions he\u2019d done. He was beyond her comprehension. He was the one who invited her over, even reminded her why she had to come.And now he sets out a table filled with her favorite food, and falls asleep.She half expected this to be just another ploy to get her to lower her defenses, but it seemed like he really was asleep by the way his breathing slowed down to a rhythmic sound.He really was an unbelievable person.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Claudine had spent the time alone with her maid embroidering. Something about the measured movements gave her a sense of calm despite how stormy her thoughts had become lately. Her movements then stilled, as a new thought came to mind.\u201cI\u2019ve decided I want to go see Leyla after all, Mary.\u201d she calmly told her aide, whose eyes widened in surprise at her mistress\u2019 words. Claudine had then set aside her embroidery as she demurely laid her hands over her lap, to listen to Mary\u2019s thoughts on her decision.\u201cBut what for, my Lady?\u201d Mary inquired worriedly, \u201cHas she done something again?\u201d Claudine just smiled at her and shook her head.\u201cNo, she hadn\u2019t done anything,\u201d she patted her aide\u2019s hand to calm her down, \u201cI just want to invite her over to apologize.\u201d she said in a warm voice, but her eyes held an icy look.The thought just wouldn\u2019t let her be.The Duke had outwardly embarrassed her, just because she had Leyla be temporarily employed as her aide. The others might not have seen it that way, but Claudine could tell he wanted to humiliate her. And now, despite the outward pleasantries they showcased around other people, he was mostly indifferent to her.If Matthias would really bore of her soon, he wouldn\u2019t have gone to such lengths. Which made her believe he did in fact, figured out his growing attachment to the girl.\u201cDo invite her over for some tea with me here.\u201d She smiled at Mary. \u201cI would like to properly apologize for that last incident.\u201d\u201cBut my Lady, I\u2019ve already apologized! You don\u2019t have to lower yourself for her-\u201d Claudine held a hand up to silence her aide.\u201cDo understand me,\u201d she held her aide\u2019s hands in hers, \u201cDo this for\u00a0 me, please?\u201d she stared at Mary imploringly.Mary searched her mistress\u2019 eyes for an unspoken meaning, before she finally understood her mistress\u2019 wishes. Mary shut her protests down firmly and bowed respectfully at her Lady.\u201cIf you wish it so, my Lady.\u201d she solemnly promised, before dismissing herself to quickly do her task. Claudine smiled to herself at seeing her servant\u2019s retreating back, before resuming in her stitching.Matthias might be difficult to read, but Leyla was the easiest. She wore her expressions as plain as day, which is why so many are so entranced with her. She was absolutely transparent. She was looking forward to seeing her again.Upon her servant\u2019s arrival, Claudine paused, and set her stitching aside once more, looking for Leyla. Mary looked at her apologetically.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have failed in bringing her, my Lady,\u201d Mary began as she bowed to her, \u201cBut it seems Miss Lewellin is away.\u201d Claudine looked rather shocked by that piece of information.\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve stood outside her cabin and knocked multiple times when I couldn\u2019t get an answer.\u201d Mary nodded immediately, \u201cI even went around the back, thinking I could see her outside, but it seemed like the cabin was empty.\u201dMary looked up nervously towards her mistress, whose face turned dark momentarily before she gave Mary an understanding smile.\u201cWell, it seems like she really is away for the moment.\u201d Claudine sighed, and leaned back on her chair, tapping her fingers on the arm rest. \u201cPerhaps you can try some time later, see if she\u2019s back by then and invite her over.\u201d\u201cMy Lady, must you really see her today?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The reply came colder than expected, before Claudine smiled at her stiffly, \u201cYes. I will see her tonight if I have to.\u201d she replied calmer this time.Unbidden thoughts came to mind at the implications of Leyla being away. But if she wasn\u2019t to return even if the night fell upon them, then she didn\u2019t know what else to think.\u2018Matthias couldn\u2019t be so brazen. He wouldn\u2019t!\u2019\u00a0Claudine hissed to herself as her grip on the armrest tightened.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Sometime in the middle of her thinking, Leyla had fallen right asleep after the Duke had. When her eyes snapped open, the room had gone completely dark. She was certain it had been way past the two hour mark the Duke told her to wake him in.She carefully got up from the seat across the Duke, and tiptoed towards the lamp. She hesitated for a moment, before turning the lamp on, wincing when light flooded into her eyes.She blinked as her eyes adjusted to the brightness before her eyes fell on the Duke, still sound asleep, even as the light blanketed him in its soft glow. He was still in the same position he\u2019d been when she last saw him.She couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she should wake him up now?She quickly glanced at the wall clock in the room, before quietly returning to the seat she had slept in. Waiting around for him to wake up made her restless. But she also didn\u2019t want to disturb the tranquility she felt around this quiet time she gained.Quietly, she removed the apron around her waist, folding it neatly on an empty surface, before looking around. She rubbed her arms as she hugged herself, feeling the biting cold seeping into her frame.Her eyes were drawn back to the food-filled table, the tea having gone cold so long ago.She refused to eat it in a foolish act of defiance, now all the food prepared had gone cold. Her eyes then glanced at the single piece of cake he specifically set out for her, making her heart skip a beat as she stared at it.Suddenly, her stomach rumbled, making her remember that breakfast was the last thing she ate before being whisked away to the central city. She could just as well go out and eat something to warm her up, but she had left without much thought but to come here so she had no money.She was also unfamiliar with the area, so that idea was terrible from the start.But she also didn\u2019t want to stay waiting for him to wake up.She thought about why he specifically asked her to wake him up in two hours. What was he planning to do in two hours? Suddenly, she found herself in a predicament, but decided not to pay much attention to it.Why should she care what he was planning about? He wouldn\u2019t even bother thinking about her own plans, and just kept making her life miserable! If she worried about him too, she\u2019d just drive herself insane.Her stomach grumbled again, finally making her give in to eating the cake. It would be a good compromise, now that she thought about it. It might have been from the Duke, but eating it would keep her mind off him.However, keeping an eye on him as she ate also seemed a little counter productive. She licked the cream off her lips, as well as the fork, before setting the half-eaten cake back on the table, when the Duke finally tossed in his sleep, making her freeze.She waited in bated breaths, before sighing softly in relief when his eyes resolutely remained closed. She dropped her hands unthinkingly, before she hit the fork by the edge of the table, making it fall on the floor with a soft thud.She cursed herself softly for her carelessness before kneeling down in front of the Duke to pick up the fallen utensil without a second thought. Belatedly, she thought about how pitiful she looked right now and glanced back at the Duke\u2019s sleeping face in panic!As if sensing her presence, Matthias\u2019 eyes suddenly fluttered open making Leyla freeze just when she was about to grab the fork.Matthias woke up a little unfocused. He could see Leyla right in front of him, but with the lamp behind her, he could faintly see her in the dark. Why was it so dark? He belatedly discovered night had fallen between them.His eyes narrowed at wondering why he wasn\u2019t woken up earlier.His immediate response was to grab onto Leyla\u2019s wrist, who immediately squealed in fright as she struggled to stand up, grabbing onto the fork as she tried to get away from him! The fork glinted harshly in Matthias\u2019 eyes, before falling back on the floor once more.Matthias refused to get up though, opting instead to hold Leyla down as he regarded her critically. Leyla felt flushed with his eyes upon her, feeling as though she was a child whose parents caught her hand in the cookie jar.She began to avoid his gaze.There was that amused glint in his eyes once more as he stared at her. Her flush deepened in embarrassment. All she does is bring him more amusement!She struggled to rip her hand off his grasp, but Matthias gave her a strong tug, making her stumble on top of him, her body sprawling over his prone form. He wasted no time in wrapping his arms around her, sighing contentedly in her ear.She squirmed on top of him, her body writhing on him in a futile attempt to get away, but he held onto her tighter. He twisted them around, before Leyla found herself on her back against the sofa, trapped beneath Matthias\u2019 broad body.She looked up, ready to give him more pieces of her mind, when she fell speechless with his intense look on her. She struggled to avert her eyes, but it proved to be difficult, when she just kept getting hypnotized in the blue pools of his gaze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHow was it that this man could always invoke so many feelings inside her?How was it, that his mere presence was enough for her walls to crumble, and let loose those feelings she so desperately tried to keep out of her heart?Suddenly, Leyla could feel that overwhelming urge to cry. She didn\u2019t want to have to speak first, to break this silence between them. Just thinking at how scared she\u2019d acted right in front of him made her heart ache in humiliation.And yet Matthias could see straight through her, pry open her heart and see what she was trying to hide.His eyes landed on the fallen fork, noticing the icing smeared on its surface, before his eyes darted up to the half eaten cake on the table. He barked out a laugh.He had been wondering why she had a fork in hand when he woke up. She must have finally decided to eat the cake he had ordered to be prepared for her. And just like that, all his suspicions on her disappeared, and his heart felt infinitely better having his worries laid aside.These past few days without her was maddening. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her, how she was, what she was doing. Day in and day out, his thoughts were filled with her. That\u2019s why he pushed through the meetings, took little rest, just to free up some time to be with her.He would do anything, as well as buy things she liked, just to keep her beside him. And seeing her eat something he specifically had for her filled him with an unfamiliar satisfaction. So instead of questioning her why she hadn\u2019t woken him up when he told her to, he pulled her to him in a kiss.He could still taste the cake in her mouth, and though he generally disliked sweets, it tasted like heaven.He hadn\u2019t planned so far ahead what he wanted to do once she arrived. He just wanted to be with her. He wanted to do mundane things with her for a change, like go out for walks. Or maybe they could even dine together in a beautiful restaurant, and then drink tea to soothe their stomachs.He found it ridiculous to have to go through the trouble of bringing her here, when he doesn\u2019t even have a proper plan for her. But he opted out of questioning her thoughts about that, for now, he wants to focus on her\u2026To drown in the feel and taste of her against his tongue.The kiss between the two deepened as Matthias\u2019 arms pulled her further up, settling her more comfortably against him.As his arms wrapped around her body tight, he could feel something settling deep inside him. Like all his time feeling nothing as she was apart from him finally made sense. He wanted nothing more than just to stay like this, with just her.Because Leyla wasn\u2019t just anyone for him, and she was all he could ever want.She was his. His little bird.Finally, he pulled away from her, Leyla gasping as he released her lips. Their chests heaved in tandem as they grappled for air. He could see the flush on her cheeks deepening, making her all the more adorable in his eyes\u2026He couldn\u2019t help but laugh in unbridled joy at the sight of her.\u2018Why is he laughing?\u2019\u00a0Leyla couldn\u2019t help but wonder in bewilderment. She was currently anxious and nervous about what he was doing, but she kept her eyes shut, afraid of what she\u2019d see. All she wanted was for everything to be over quickly.But she was also intrigued.He wasn\u2019t acting like his usual self. Normally he would have stripped her off their clothes, and they would do their dance beneath the sheets, but he wasn\u2019t doing that now. Instead, he just kept planting soft kisses all over her face. He would leave sporadic pecks on her cheeks, the tip of her nose, but nothing more.His hands never wandered away from her waist.He turned her head to the side slightly, leaving a muted kiss on the back of her ear, making her look at him in fright as the contact sent tingling shivers through her body. Their ragged breathing matched each other, and he was still looking at her in that intense gaze of his.\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d she whispered pleadingly, her palms splayed on his chest as she tried to push him away. \u201cStop being weird and just do what you always do.\u201d she demanded him, looking up at him with complete confusion and terror.He was doing things to her, things she couldn\u2019t understand. And it frightened her more than usual.Matthias\u2019 movements stilled, before he regarded her carefully. He stared into her eyes, and he could see she was begging him to go back to how things were between them. After a tense moment of silence between them, Matthias gave her a nip in the ears, making her cry out in painful pleasure\u2026Soon the world faded around them, as nothing but their ragged breaths surrounding them in the darkness.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Claudine lied in the guest bedroom, eyes staring resolutely on the ceiling right above her head as she rested on the bed. Memories from when she had been thirteen years old, barely into her teens, came flooding vividly in her mind.It had been summer when it had been decided she would be the next Duchess of Arvis, Duchess Herhardt.It wasn\u2019t their first time visiting the mansion in Arvis. It wasn\u2019t the first time she was meeting with the Herhardts either, but her mother made quite a fuss on her looks, making sure she would be absolutely perfect when she would arrive.\u201cYou\u2019re not a child anymore Claudine,\u201d Her mother admonished her as she harshly brushed the strands off of Claudine\u2019s face back then, \u201cFrom now on, you must be the perfect lady, do you understand?\u201d she asked, after another harsh tug on her scalp, brushing away stubborn tangles.They had gotten ready with the help of their aides, and rode the carriage without further delay. Her mother\u2019s grip on her tiny shoulders had been tight. Claudine could\u2019ve sworn her nails would have dug deeply into her skin if only her mother wasn\u2019t so concerned how messy she would be if she bled.As they grew closer to Arvis, the tighter her mother held onto her. Claudine had looked up at her mother in worry, and saw her mother\u2019s eyes glinted with unshed tears.A few days prior to their visit, her mother gave her a crash course on what it really meant to become society\u2019s lady .Claudine knew she was young, too young to fully understand how heavy the responsibility would weigh on her shoulders, but she was no idiot. She could infer it from the way her mother talked, how harshly she\u2019d scold her from time to time, instilling painful yet memorable lessons as she lived her day to day.It was her quick wit that made her understand that a match with Matthias was inevitable between them.\u201cDoes that mean that Matthias and I will be wed soon?\u201d she asked her mother after one of her lessons. It was her first week in Arvis, and out of the blue, she couldn\u2019t help but question her mother about it while they were in a communal space.Countess Brandt grew embarrassed by her daughter\u2019s brazen inquiry and gracefully grabbed Claudine tightly by her arms, discretely dragging her to their rooms. Once the door shut behind her mother, she shook Claudine by the shoulders, forcing the little girl to look up at her.\u201cIt is what we have agreed upon, but you should also make sure you accept this engagement, do you understand me Claudine?\u201d her mother quietly hissed at her, \u201cOnce you do this, you will show all those other girls you\u2019re the best candidate for the job! Nothing less than perfect, and they won\u2019t think twice about choosing you to be the Duchess of Arvis!\u201dClaudine remembered pouting at her mother\u2019s implication.\u201cBut I\u2019m already the smartest girl amongst my friends, mother.\u201d She reasoned out, \u201cEven my teachers keep telling me that. I\u2019m so observant I never miss anything!\u201d She proclaimed rather proudly back in the day, \u201cI even mastered all the dances they taught and all the etiquette they made us remember.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, I get that, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s important here Claudine!\u201d her mother interrupted, quickly making the proud smile on little Claudine\u2019s face fall, \u201cWhat you must focus on from now on, aside from being the best, is to get along with Matthias. You hear me, child? That\u2019s the most important thing here.\u201dLittle Claudine felt self-conscious. Had she been prioritizing wrong this whole time? If Claudine could go back, she would have quickly shut those self doubts quickly. It wasn\u2019t that she was doing the wrong thing. She was just born a woman.And so Claudine resolved to build a better relationship with Matthias, to allow their marriage to pass by smoothly when the time came. But unlike the other boys she had managed to tame, Matthias was different.Firstly, he was already the Duke, and at such a young age. Every girl that wasn\u2019t her coveted him, and so badly they did. But it wasn\u2019t like she hated Matthias. She didn\u2019t.In fact, her first impression of him was that he was handsome and a wonderful boy. She likened him as the Herhardt\u2019s crown jewel, more valuable than any works of art the Herhardt house possessed.But she found it difficult to imagine being happy around him.Matthias was on the cusp of adulthood back then, never mind they were close in age. Still, whenever he\u2019d look at her, she couldn\u2019t help but feel inadequate in his presence. And Matthias had always been different from the other boys.He might have treated her respectfully, but she was always invisible in his eyes. And she didn\u2019t like that.It didn\u2019t help that her mother was expecting her to be the best Lady in all of Berg. The responsibilities just grew on Claudine. She no longer wanted to be the best, instead, she needed to be the best.\u201cShow everyone that only you, Count Brandt\u2019s sole daughter, is the best! And make those people forget about your father\u2019s sons!\u201dHer mother might be Count Brandt\u2019s wife, but she wasn\u2019t the only woman to give him a child. In fact, they bore him sons, while his mother was shamed for bearing a daughter.\u201cIf I\u2019m to become the Duchess of Arvis, does that mean I\u2019ll be the most powerful woman in the Empire?\u201d she thought curiously.There was a proud glint in her mother\u2019s eye at her question.\u201cWithout a doubt, my child. You\u2019ll be part of the Empire\u2019s elite families. No one will ever think nothing but the best of you!\u201d\u201cAnd all this, this will be mine?\u201d she asked meekly, and her mother nodded excitedly.\u201cYes! Yes, all of Arvis will be yours!\u201dPresent day Claudine got up from her bed, and she looked out the window in deep thought. In front of her were rows and rows of freshly trimmed bushes, and perfectly preserved colorful flowers blooming as the vast estate stretched far and wide in front of her\u2026She had been in this very same position at thirteen.\u201cI like Arvis!\u201d little Claudine beamed at her mother, \u201cI\u2019ll do it mother, don\u2019t worry!\u201dAnd so her mother praised her for being the best girl, and Claudine had learned to perfect her poses and responses for the crowd to see, and for people to judge. And the days just keep closer until that dream would soon turn into a reality.Her reality, no one else\u2019s.So how dare her fiance do this to her?!Unable to sleep, Claudine grabbed her sleep robes, wrapped them around her small frame and began to pace around the bedroom.After Mary had returned a second time today to invite the peasant girl over, she still returned to the mansion alone. At this point, Claudine could safely say that Matthias had gone crazy about the girl!His recent actions further proved her correct!Just the thought of them together made her seethe. He probably sent for her, Leyla, and brought her to where he was staying.She probably wouldn\u2019t be very bothered if it had been anyone else, perhaps a lowly court lady or anyone with a more respectable birth, but to replace her, Claudine von Brandt, with an orphaned girl?!\u2018How dare he humiliate me like this?!\u2019\u00a0Claudine seethed in her mind.But there was nothing she could do against him. As long as he favored that girl as his mistress, she would have to endure it. It was annoying, sure, but it wouldn\u2019t be like she couldn\u2019t tolerate it. She doesn\u2019t want to earn Matthias\u2019 love. She wanted his status.So long as she secured her position as his wife, and the mother of his heir, she would let them tumble in their sheets no matter how long. She knew Matthias felt the same way about her. He could care less about what she does.But the foreboding sense of danger refused to leave Claudine. There was a threat to her, and she couldn\u2019t stand by idly and watch it wreck her ambitions.Dawn broke through the skies, chasing the darkness as the sun slowly woke to a rise. Another memory came to Claudine\u2019s mind.Matthias was looking a little suspicious at the last dinner party held in Arvis, the dinner they held to commemorate the Crown Prince\u2019s visit with them. He was acting rather differently, and when she looked at him\u2026He was staring at her like he was seeing her for the first time, making her uneasy.He had never been affectionate with her, aside from when there were other people around. But he also never looked at her like that. And all of a sudden, she feared he would break off the engagement.She feared he\u2019d abandon her in exchange for a lowly peasant. But that was also a baseless fear because Matthias was the Duke of Arvis first and foremost. It would be a grave mistake of his to do that just to take his mistress as a wife.But that was the old Matthias. This Matthias, this was someone she never knew.She apologized mentally to Riette, knowing she couldn\u2019t just stand aside anymore. She had a feeling Matthias was close to figuring out his feelings. She must make a move now to end them before he ever reached that point.Things were different from when she\u2019d been thirteen, but at the same time, her circumstances never changed. Just now, her fears didn\u2019t stem from being imperfect as a Duchess. It was because she wasn\u2019t born as Leyla, and yet she must marry Matthias.It was the only reward she sought in life. It was the only way to justify all the sacrifices she had to make all those years ago. The turmoil slowly disappeared the longer she stared at the frozen plains in front of her, the moonlight illuminating her soft, yet harsh features.She can\u2019t do anything about Matthias, but perhaps she could do something about Leyla. Leyla must disappear for her to secure her goal. But how could she push Leyla to the breaking point? Enough that it would want to make her leave the Duke despite his hold on her?A grin made its way on her smile as a single person came to mind.\u201cKyle Etman.\u201d she hummed to herself in a whisper, cold puff of air escaping her, fogging up the glass.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla drunkenly blinked awake, feeling warm all over, before her eyes landed on the sleeping man beside her. She was perfectly content right now, and she wanted to bask longer in the mood around them. She breathed in and out softly, rolling over to face him properly.She could see the way his lips were kiss bitten, all red and swollen against his pale complexion. His sharp features are more prominent, even in the dim lighting around them as the dawning light filtered through the glass.She couldn\u2019t deny how beautiful he was. But something about him was familiar.\u2018Ah,\u2019\u00a0she thought with a wide smile as his name clicked in her head,\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s the duke!\u2019\u00a0she thought ecstatically.He\u2019d gone with her to school! She could remember him vividly! She also remembered how intimidated she was of him, but she was also in awe of him. Especially when she\u2019d met him by the forest.But something was strange right now though. Leyla frowned as she looked at him with a pout. He looked younger in her memories, was he stressed? Or maybe he looked older when asleep?She hummed, pulling the blanket over her head down as her head peaked out from under the covers. She gingerly reached out a hand, and cupped his face. She giggled when she managed to do it successfully, squishing his cheeks before frowning.He felt warm to the touch. But then again, should she be feeling him? Wasn\u2019t this a dream? She usually never felt them in dreams.She blinked back, her vision slowly becoming clearer by the second. Her eyes zeroed in on her surroundings, belatedly noticing how different the walls were. She groggily looked around in confusion, before realizing she wasn\u2019t even in her own room!And that was enough for Leyla to sober up, and immediately withdrew her touch on the Duke as though his skin burnt her! She tried to put a distance between them, but Matthias\u2019 arms tightened around her.She was lying on her stomach, head pillowed on his arm. He threw his legs over her, entwining them together, making it more difficult and uncomfortable for her to move. She tried wriggling away, but soon gave up, when his grip remained tight around her waist.One by one, last night\u2019s events flooded her brain, painting one clear picture in Leyla\u2019s mind. She frantically tried to shake the memories away, and back into their forgotten places as she was stuck looking at the Duke.It was strange how she fell asleep so easily beside him. All she did was try to get away from him desperately, escaping from his private touches when she could, and yet he\u2019d come back at her with an equal force, pulling her closer and closer with each step she took farther from him.He was such a crazy person in Leyla\u2019s eyes.And now, instead of being his usual, greedy self, he took the time to ask her about things she liked. Almost as though he valued her opinion. And when he took her last night, he took her gently, coaxing her softly to open up for him.She must have fallen asleep at some point, because she didn\u2019t remember pushing him away from her. She didn\u2019t even remember how last night ended. All she did remember was the sounds they made as he called out for her\u2026\u201cLewellin\u2026\u201d he cried out in passion from time to time, the sounds of their flesh slapping against each other accompanying it, before her memories faded black.She didn\u2019t want them to resume that activity so soon after she woke up, and decided to lie still in his arms instead. She couldn\u2019t bring herself back to sleep, and thus was left no choice but to stare at him until he woke up.Looking back, nothing much changed in his appearance, but his features grew sharper the older he got. The times had also made him rougher. As dawn crept in their window the more the sun rose in the sky, Leyla could only imagine that day she first arrived in Arvis.It had been so long ago, yet the memories remained as though it was like yesterday.She\u2019d come to Arvis, riding a small mail wagon. She was so little back then too, all thin and gangly, with her shoulder blades jutting out of her skin. When she had met Matthias once more later in the years, she remembered releasing a shuddered breath at the sight of him.Because his eyes resembled the deep blue colors of the night sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Matthias opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was Leyla. Immediately, his mind flashed back to when she first witnessed the snow. But this vision here, there was also something ethereal in this moment between them.That strange feeling in Leyla was back, causing her to squirm away from him in an effort to look away when his hand went up to cup her cheek, refusing to let her go and look away from him.Fear flashed in her eyes, thinking they were about to resume last night\u2019s activities, but nothing like that came.He just kept her in place, staring at her, and making her feel unfamiliar things. His fingers began to caress her cheeks soothingly, pressing lightly on her skin. Leyla stilled under his touch, letting him feel her face as they locked eyes with each other, their breath intermingling in the air\u2026\u2018Why does he do this to me?\u2019\u00a0she asked herself.Her head tilted in wonderment, as Matthias just kept staring at her without an outward response. Instead, he seemed to be looking for something. He kept searching her eyes for an answer to a question she didn\u2019t know was being asked.She likened this feeling between them to witnessing the first morning after winter came. Like a sudden clarity had washed over her as she looked at the snowy white plains, just as vast and beautiful as the sky\u2026The sun peeked through the gaps of the curtains, lightly hitting their skin, basking them in a warm glow as Matthias kept caressing her face. The sun beams moved, perfectly framing Leyla\u2019s emerald orbs, redefining Matthias\u2019 definition of a crowning jewel.Because that\u2019s what her eyes were to him, despite the lingering fear they held, a persistent curiosity shone through them too.But there was no answer provided to him, and it made Matthias feel dejected, chuckling mirthlessly to himself, before he moved his hands to tangle them through her golden locks instead. They looked like golden threads, gifted by the heavens.Yet Leyla\u2019s eyes narrowed with his movement, reminding him that she would always doubt his intentions. But the way she squirmed in his arms was also maddening. He couldn\u2019t bear it any longer-\u201cI\u2019m hungry!\u201d Leyla immediately exclaimed, having enough of this moment between them as his hands shifted to touch her bare back. He blinked at her.\u201cWhat?\u201d he frowned, displeased at her interruption.\u201cI said I\u2019m hungry.\u201d she repeated, before firmly pushing away his hand from her.She wasn\u2019t hungry. But it was the only excuse she could think of at the moment. Though demanding something that ridiculous was a little embarrassing, she would rather face that kind of embarrassment than have intercourse with him at such an early morning.\u201cI-I want to eat some breakfast.\u201d Leyla haughtily added, giving Matthias a firm glare as he stared at her in a dumbfounded manner.Leyla\u2019s stomach churned in terror. Had she provoked him after all? The longer the silence persisted from him, the more she feared she did provoke him.But alas, laughter like music echoed against the walls, making Leyla look at him in bewilderment. She\u2019s heard him laugh so many times now, yet every time she hears it, it never ceases to amaze her how warm his laugh would make her feel.She could almost believe this was a different person, but she knows this was still Matthias.Matthias laughed on his back, hands clutched on his stomach as he threw his head back onto the pillows as he chuckled to his heart\u2019s content. His eyes squeezed shut as laugh lines creased the skin of his eyes.An insecurity assaulted Leyla\u2019s thoughts.Was he laughing at her ridiculousness? Did she make herself look stupid in front of him?!She quickly pulled up the blankets, wrapping them around her naked frame, pulling it up to her nose securely. Matthias\u2019 laughter died down as he finally sat up on the bed, before he turned to her with a soft smile.At this angle, Leyla could witness the way the sunlight rolled off his frame beautifully, hitting his sharp features as they casted dark shadows on his other side, making his blue pools shine. His overall image was softer like this, much like those marble sculptures she used to see in art books and museums\u2026It made her heart skip a beat.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do that.\u201d Matthias hummed with that soft smile on his lips. His eyes held hers hypnotically, making blood rise in her chest, \u201cLet\u2019s have breakfast together.\u201dAs he left, still chuckling to himself for unknown reasons, Leyla couldn\u2019t help but wonder how such a cruel man possessed such beautiful laughter? It didn\u2019t make sense. But at the crucial moment, he looked like any other man Leyla saw.He wasn\u2019t a duke, he wasn\u2019t powerful, he wasn\u2019t cruel. Just a normal man she would have met randomly at the street, and that image sent shivers inside her.He was an uncanny man. He was acting so strange lately, it confused her greatly. So Leyla grabbed on tightly on the blanket, and brought it up over her head, refusing to look at him any longer, but it didn\u2019t block out the sounds of his laughter still ringing in her head.She was beginning to feel weird as well.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Kyle stood outside of the most expensive cafe in Carlsbar with clammy palms.He took a deep breath, before he thanked the doorman for opening the door and searched the tables. The cafe was crowded with many noblemen and ladies, given its prestigious reputation, it came as no surprise to him. It was also located in the center of the city, so naturally, it attracted a lot of customers.Finally, his eyes landed on the reason he was here in the first place.He\u2019d received an invitation from Lady Brandt, which he interpreted as a demand for him to meet up in the city. And just as she said, Claudine was seated by the window seat, overlooking the occupants by the second floor of the cafe.It was quieter up there after all, plus, she had the bonus view of the city\u2019s shopping district and its beautiful park.Kyle wasted no time to approach her, wishing for their meeting to be over as soon as possible. He had more important things to do than waste it with her.Claudine beamed at the sight of him, flashing him that sweet smile she used on everyone.\u201cAh, Kyle! I\u2019m so happy you accepted my invitation.\u201d She greeted him. Kyle bowed his head at her, before taking the seat across her. \u201cFor a moment I thought you wouldn\u2019t come.\u201d she lightly remarked, eyeing him in scrutiny.\u201cYes, I apologize for the delay,\u201d Kyle said with a stiff smile, \u201cBut you weren\u2019t very specific on the time of our meeting, I\u2019d been afraid I have missed you.\u201dHis words were pleasant at best, but Claudine could tell there was a hint of dismay in his tone at their meet-up.\u201cSo, why have you invited me out today, Lady Brandt?\u201d Kyle immediately asked, quick to the point, his posture going taut. Claudine could only lightly tut at him in his brazen manner.\u201cWatch that tone Kyle,\u201d she softly warned, \u201cThere are many eyes around us, who knows what rumors would surface at them spotting us together.\u201d\u201cIf you were so worried about so much attention on us, then why did you arrange for us to meet here?\u201d Kyle asked her in confusion, and Claudine only smiled at him, before taking a dainty sip out of her cup.\u201cBecause I have the perfect vantage point in this spot.\u201d she answered plainly. \u201cAlso, meeting up here is more wise if we are to remain inconspicuous instead of a shady place that hardly anyone knows.\u201d She explained to him with a pointed stare, \u201cJust think of the scandal.\u201d she sighed.Kyle could only shoot her back with a wry smile.He wanted to be anywhere but here with her. However, he also knew she had the answers to several of his questions. He knew because she had her aide personally deliver him her letter of invitation.[I need to discuss something with you.][Don\u2019t you wonder why Leyla\u2019s changed so much after you\u2019ve gone?][I\u2019ll see you in the cafe, in front of the central station in Carlsbar city. I\u2019ll be eagerly waiting for your arrival tomorrow.]Those were some lines directly found in her letter, and it did make Kyle curious. And he couldn\u2019t believe that Lady Brandt, who had always despised Leyla since they were children for unknown reasons, had a better understanding of her than him.Something in him unsettled with that piece of information.He could have just ignored her. He had no reason to attach himself with Leyla anymore, but he wanted to help her. Even if it meant subjecting himself to feeling pathetic as he faced the soon to be Duchess of Arvis.It was as though she saw something in him give in, making her grin toothily at his resignation.\u201cI knew you would come,\u201d Claudine hummed, \u201cAfter all, you love her too much just to ignore something this important.\u201d\u201cPlease tell me what I need to know quickly, Lady Brandt.\u201d Kyle prompted, feeling his patience running thin by the second. \u201cI\u2019d like for this to be over soon.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Claudine smirked, raising a brow in a challenge, \u201cWhy, that would be so improper of me to not even bother asking you about your day!\u201d she gasped softly. Kyle could feel his jaw stiffen, stopping himself from snapping at her.Claudine seemed unbothered by his discomfort, and proceeded to flag a nearby waiter. They nodded at her immediately, before rushing down. Kyle saw no words exchanged between them. Claudine only shot him an innocent smile, before the waiter came back with a handful of coffee, balanced precariously on a silver tray.He set their cups down in front of them, taking Claudine\u2019s cold cup of tea with him before leaving them back to their privacy.\u201cTrust me, Lady Brandt,\u201d Kyle spoke dryly to her as the waiter disappeared, \u201cI won\u2019t talk of your improperness if you just say it now.\u201d\u201cWell, alright then.\u201d Claudine smiled victoriously at Kyle.She had thought about this carefully after all. She needed to reveal her fiance\u2019s affair with Leyla, but to someone who cared greatly about Leyla, and had some power over her too.Kyle was the perfect candidate. She could have gone with the gardener, after all, he was the most important person in Leyla\u2019s life, but she found that scenario too pitiful.\u201cFirst, let me clarify a few of my suspicions.\u201d Claudine declared, making Kyle frown at her.\u201cLady Brandt, I insist-\u201d\u201cDid you or did you not return to Arvis in hopes of rekindling your love with Leyla?\u201d Claudine interrupted, making Kyle snap his mouth shut at the unexpectedness.When Kyle resolutely remained silent, she could only smile at him in pity.\u201cOh, poor you. I assume by your reaction Leyla rejected you, no?\u201dKyle still kept silent as he glared at Claudine, who was unbothered by him.\u201cYes, she did, didn\u2019t she?\u201d she hummed, tutting at him in pity, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t blame her for doing that. After all, how could she juggle two men vying for her attention at the same time?\u201d she said plainly as she stared at her nails.It was like a bucket-full of ice had been poured down on Kyle upon her words. He refused to believe this was true, but the grin on Claudine\u2019s face as she stared at his frozen form made him feel otherwise.\u201cWhat do you say Kyle?\u201d Claudine leaned forward, resting her chin on her clasped hands, \u201cAre you still in such a hurry for our conversation to be over?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Kyle couldn\u2019t help but ask after freeing himself from his frozen shock, before Claudine\u2019s eyes turned ice cold, but her smile remained.\u201cWhy, it\u2019s no one else but my fiance ,\u201d Claudine practically hissed, \u201cMatthias von Herhardt, Duke of Arvis.\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The rest of their day together had gone smoothly, just as Matthias hoped.Their breakfast together was splendid, and went beyond his expectations. It was every bit enjoyable as he\u2019d imagined and more!The only downside so far was that Leyla refused to even look up at him. All day long she kept avoiding seeing him, so instead he watched her. He drank in the sight of her rosy cheeks, the sunlight haloing around her crown as she took small bites.He watched her plump lips moisten up with the food and their drinks. It made him want to devour her all the more. Especially when she\u2019d bite down on her lips in that nervous manner.But that was just typical Leyla to him.It made him feel like bursting out into another fit of laughter with how high he was currently feeling, and he didn\u2019t care how it made him look.She\u2019d glance back at him every now and then, but when she\u2019d catch him looking at her, she\u2019d get frazzled and immediately avert her eyes. He especially enjoyed seeing her face grow red, and because of him!But, he was done just watching her, instead, he lightly gestured to the corner of his lip, finally catching her attention. Leyla paused, as she frowned at him.The crumbs on her face looked more appealing than the ones on his plate.Eventually it dawned upon her what he meant, and fumbled around to wipe the crumbs off her face with a napkin. Her flush grew deeper, the red running down to her neck.Once she was done, she proceeded to continue with their meat, albeit with a slower pace this time, still blushing beautifully for him.Every move she made was so delicate for him, even as she tapped on the egg to crack its shell. Matthias couldn\u2019t help but let out a chuckle, making her look up at him in even more confusion.Leyla gingerly scooped out some of the egg, before it disappeared into her mouth with a frown and a pout as soon as he chuckled at her once more.When breakfast was over, they both took their sweet time in doing nothing but just being around each other.Of course, while Matthias reclined himself leisurely on the bed, Leyla refused to sit still and kept pacing and mumbling nothings to herself around the room.She was arguing with herself to keep it together quietly, afraid that the duke would hear. She didn\u2019t know why she felt so jittery around him lately, was it because she was afraid and uncomfortable with him? Or was it something else!?The next time Leyla looked at the Duke, his hair was damp just as he was finished dressing up. Fit to go out.Was he going out and leaving her?\u2018Good!\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought to herself, before she picked up the morning paper on the table and sat herself firmly by the windowsill. She was intent on reading while he\u2019d gone away, unaware he\u2019d approached her.Matthias stared over her shoulder, quietly standing behind her as he read with her. He blinked back as soon as he realized what it was she was reading on the paper. It was one of those serialized novels the papers published, something he never really bothered to pay attention to whenever he\u2019d read the news.Leyla gasped, immediately flushing red in embarrassment once she realized he\u2019d been standing behind her reading all this time! In her rush to get away, she dropped the newspaper between them, looking like a child who was caught with their hand in a cookie jar.Matthias laughed in amusement once more! Who would\u2019ve thought that Miss Prim-and-proper, Leyla Lewellin, was the type who could read such riveting novels with a straight face?She was looking at him as though he was crazy, but Matthias can\u2019t seem to think it\u2019s such a terrible picture. He was having fun right now, and what\u2019s a little fun without being crazy?They left the hotel room as soon as noon struck.Leyla had been against the idea at first, but Matthias was insistent, making her accompany him reluctantly. He had his attendant bring them another one of his coats, before firmly wrapping his own coat around Leyla as he eyed his attendant.Mark Evers never rushed out of sight as fast as he did after that moment.The tailcoat ended up being bigger than expected at Leyla. The ends of the coat were almost touching the floor, but Matthias loved seeing her in something of his.\u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d Leyla asked him in a meek voice, just as they passed the hotel\u2019s main entrance. Matthias gave no answer. Instead, he just kept walking, making Leyla run after him.Matthias slowed down from time to time, careful not to lose sight of her as he led them towards one of the city\u2019s most prominent boutiques. Leyla\u2019s eyes narrowed at the sight of it in front of them.\u201cNo.\u201d she said, glaring at Matthias, \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201dBut Matthias held her gaze steadfast in a wordless demand. Leyla shook her head adamantly, but Matthias wasn\u2019t budging.It was inevitable of her to give in to him.So with great reluctance, Leyla followed him into the boutique. The entrance clanged with a soft chime, indicating new customers had arrived. Once they entered, almost every pair of eyes in the store turned on the new arrivals.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUpon their entrance, every customer and employer were left confused by the new arrivals. Even the boutique\u2019s owner took a while to recover before she went up to them with a bright smile.\u201cWelcome!\u201d she greeted jovially, giving them both a once over.The man looked wealthy. He was tall and handsome, and had a regal air around him as he escorted the petite woman inside, who looked around the store nervously. She had a tailcoat on, which he assumed to be from her companion\u2019s.The man then went up behind her to remove the coat. As soon as the coat came off, the owner\u2019s eyes widened, before he narrowed his eyes on the two of them.She was beautiful, the owner would admit, but she had such ghastly clothes on her! Not appropriate when she\u2019s with such a classy man. But judging by the way the man was looking at her, she would wager a guess that they didn\u2019t have a master-and-maid relationship between them.\u2018A mistress would be most likely.\u2019\u00a0She thought to herself as she gave them a welcoming smile. She politely conversed with them, sending a smile towards the skittish woman as she continued to assess them.She knew many noblemen took on mistresses, but for this man to bring her in here, of all places. Wasn\u2019t that just asking for trouble on his part?She noticed how the woman would scoot away from him, even going as far as shrugging off his touch from her. They must have been at odds with each other for a while now.It was a scene she\u2019d seen many times. Being a boutique that boasted many things of luxury, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for quarreling lovers to bring their women here to buy them something. It was her job to gauge out her customers in what they could potentially like, and convince the man into buying them for her.But these two were different, she could tell.She didn\u2019t even look like she\u2019d like anything in store. She looked around as though she wished she were anywhere else but in her store. She might even be a little bit afraid of her companion. But why would she be afraid?She\u2019d seen many women who would have given anything to be in a position like her. They would even be willing to sleep with men twice their age just to enjoy luxuries in life.But it wasn\u2019t her place to pry, even if she\u2019d been itching to ask them a million questions. For now, she will just have to wait for them to pick out what they want, and then help them make a purchase.Another thing that surprised her from watching them was how incredibly stubborn the woman was! She looked soft, and a pushover, but she was acting very headstrong with the man. Her companion, instead, was the one who kept compromising, giving her suggestions here and there on what would look good on her.The owner loved meeting people who would obviously bring sales into her business like this man, but the woman\u2019s attitude was a little bit off-putting. Perhaps she should help them make a decision.Did she want something more expensive? She just has the thing for them!She made quick work around her store, choosing clothes just around the woman\u2019s size with an expert eye, and picking out some of their most beautiful products that would complement her greatly.She hoped this would be enough for her. She didn\u2019t know what was wrong between them, but she was certain about one thing.The man with her was absolutely taken with her. Surely she couldn\u2019t be so blind to see the way he looked at her?And that made her confident the man would buy her just about anything, no matter the price!With several items on hand, she approached them once more, politely asking them to try the items out and to not hesitate in asking her for more.The turquoise coat she got for her looked absolutely good on her!Matthias made Leyla try them on, the shop owner beaming at her when she got the correct size. Leyla wanted nothing more but to leave the shop, but she reminded herself she needed to do this. Matthias had control over her after all.She mustn\u2019t deny him what he wants.The shop owner did a good job in praising Leyla with lines she knew have been used multiple times with other wealthy customers. She led Leyla towards their shoe display, prompting her to choose the one she liked, before making her sit on the sofa nearby.The other shop attendants came by to assist them, bringing some suggested shoes for Leyla to try on.Leyla looked lost, not knowing what to do and looked away from their suggestions, staring resolutely on the floor instead.\u2018My, what a stubborn woman.\u2019\u00a0The store owner pouted to herself. At that moment, the man chuckled, before he approached them. He gave a glance over to the shoes, then back at his woman, before looking back at the owner.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir,\u201d she apologized, bowing her head at his approach, \u201cThese were the only shoes I made that would be a perfect fit for her.\u201d she explained.With how busy she had gotten lately, she didn\u2019t have the time to make more shoes and clothes that would fit all kinds of customers she got with the highest quality materials. As such, the things she picked out were one of the last in their current stocks.Matthias hummed, stopping right in front of Leyla, before gesturing at her red-stained shoes. \u201cAren\u2019t these the ones you were wearing that day?\u201dThe memory of Matthias pouring ink on her came to mind. She\u2019d tried to get the stain out, but the red ink he\u2019d poured persistently stayed on her shoes.Leyla looked up at him meekly, and bit her lip as she avoided his gaze, refusing to answer him. Matthias\u2019 eyes narrowed at her in disappointment. It was the same shoes, although he also distinctly remembered buying her new ones, to replace the ones he ruined.Why was she still using these?Sensing his disappointment, Leyla finally gave in and sighed.\u201cThese were new shoes,\u201d she pointed out, \u201cThey are stained, but they work perfectly fine. Besides, I had been wearing them when I was home.\u201dHer toes felt frozen. She should have at least chosen proper shoes before leaving her house! Leyla thought as she berated herself. She didn\u2019t realize how much she\u2019d regret not changing properly to come meet him.Though if he were a more decent person, he could have pretended to not know, or at least not have pointed it out to everybody!She hated how he could read her so easily, and how he\u2019d casually reveal a secret or two of her and say it so callously. Although she shouldn\u2019t have expected anything different from a man who made a deal with her just so he could take from her whatever he wanted.She made a deal with him to be his mistress in exchange for her uncle\u2019s freedom. She\u2019d been able to endure all those weeks of sleeping with him, because at the moment, it was the only stipulation he had of their deal. She doesn\u2019t want to owe him more, especially not priceless things she can\u2019t repay him for.Because no matter how much he\u2019ll pay for her, she\u2019ll have to keep paying him with her body. He kept coming back for her dismal performance, but that wasn\u2019t what made her despair. No, it was because if she did accept his gifts, she might as well just be a prostitute.Her cheeks flushed with frustration, head bowed resolutely.Matthias stepped closer to her. She kept acting like he was punishing her.So Matthias knelt in front of her.Leyla snapped her eyes up to meet his gaze, while the others gasped softly as they witnessed him kneeling. Matthias seemed indifferent to their audience, his attention solely on Leyla.Before she could voice out her confusion, Matthias grabbed her by the ankles, gently removing her shoes, and put on the ones he\u2019d chosen would fit her. Leyla soon snapped out of her confusion, the frustrated blush being replaced with a flustered red as she pulled her leg away from him, but he only grabbed it back to secure the shoes on her feet.Even her feet looked so adorable, Matthias thought to himself with a smile.Once he had tied the last knot on the shoes, Matthias casually stood up, and looked down on her. Leyla couldn\u2019t help but hold his gaze in a mesmerized way, oblivious to their audience in the form of the store owner and attendants.But could anyone really blame them?Leyla couldn\u2019t help but watch as Matthias reached out for her\u2026\u2018He\u2019ll just hurt me again.\u2019\u00a0Leyla knew. Whenever he\u2019d be this kind to her, he\u2019d just quickly replace it with an equally cruel act afterwards. How could this be any different than those times? She knew him. She knew all his games, and she won\u2019t fall for it again.Finally, Leyla grew aware of their growing audience before she realized Matthias had been waiting for her to take his hand, so that she could stand up. Embarrassed, she reluctantly took his hand, to which he gave a gentle tug to put his arms around her, wrapping her in a warm one-armed hug.Upon seeing their interaction, the owner sighed in relief. Her assumptions were wrong after all, she wasn\u2019t a mistress.They were lovers\u2026The air might be chilly around them, but the sun surely was shining brightly on them. The boutique owner thought ecstatically as she quickly rang up their purchases when the man told her they\u2019d be buying those things!By the time they left the shop, Leyla was dressed in her brand new clothes, following him obediently as he led them through the streets. Numerous people kept passing them as they headed for downtown.Rush hour was just beginning, if the growing crowd was anything to go by.Eventually they reached the park in the city, and Matthias held out his arm for her to take. Leyla grew flustered at him before she stilled. She thought of the many people around them, before shaking them out of her mind.With a straight composure, she took it without further thought, and Matthias smiled to himself as she accepted him.\u2018I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want this\u2026\u2019\u00a0Leyla kept repeating in her head as she drew closer to Matthias\u2019 warmth. He was starting to get on her nerves.Matthias also grew a little restless at how stiff Leyla was being. He wanted to respect her boundaries, but enough was enough. He removed her hand from his arm, before he firmly, yet gently entwined their fingers together.Her fingers fit perfectly on the gaps between his.Leyla tried to pull away from him, but his grip on her tightened. She gave it a few more tugs, before giving in to his whims.\u2018This is only temporary.\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought to herself as she allowed her fingers to rest in his.The rest of their walk had gone uneventful, before they sat down in front of a cafe\u2019s windows, with a perfect view of the park. Matthias regarded Leyla carefully, knowing by heart she loved to talk. He\u2019d seen her around with other people, yet she refused to grant him the same privilege.\u201cWhat\u2019s that bird?\u201d Matthias suddenly asked, making Leyla jolt in surprise, as the cup clanged on the saucer. She nervously looked at where his line of sight was, before seeing a black bird, perched on one of the trees nearby.\u201cIt\u2019s a crow.\u201d she answered after a quick assessment before looking at him suspiciously. Shouldn\u2019t he know what a crow looks like? After all, there were many of them in Arvis, even she knew that as a child.\u201cHow about that?\u201d Matthias asked.Again and again, he kept asking about the different birds he would spot, and Leyla would answer each one without fail.Varied tit.Forest thrush.Yellow robin.Those were only some of the birds he pointed out to, but the more he asked the more confused she got. What was he playing at?Matthias was content to keep asking his questions. He loved the breathy tone around her voice whenever she\u2019d speak their names. They sounded so much like music to his ears.\u201cHow can you memorize all of them?\u201d\u201cWell\u201d she answered, \u201cSince I am living near a forest.\u201d Leyla bit her lower lip in serious thought.\u201cSo what\u2019s your favorite bird?\u201d Matthias suddenly asked her, shaking her out of her thoughts.\u201cMy favorite?\u201d Leyla looked to the trees, a frown on her face, \u201cI can\u2019t really say. There\u2019s too many to choose from.\u201d She turned to look back at him, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dMatthias blinked at her in pleasant surprise. He thought for sure he\u2019d be the one to initiate conversations this whole afternoon.\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite bird?\u201d Leyla parroted back to him, before she narrowed her gaze, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean your favorite bird to hunt.\u201dHe could only chuckle good naturedly at her.\u201cAh, then that\u2019s easy.\u201d He hummed, perching his hand up in a way that made him see his perched finger carrying Leyla, \u201cA canary.\u201dLeyla blinked back in surprise. It wasn\u2019t a bird she thought he would favor.\u201cYou mean those birds that could sing beautifully?\u201d She asked curiously. \u201cThose kinds of canary?\u201d Matthias hummed in agreement, \u201cBut why? Don\u2019t men like you usually prefer hawks? Or eagles? Or falcons?\u201dAn awkward silence befell between them. She waited for Matthias to reply, but he was content to see her finally look at him expectantly.\u2018If I hold my answer a little longer, will you keep looking at me that way?\u2019\u00a0Matthias thought to himself in melancholic wonder.\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked Leyla, \u201cI think they\u2019re rather beautiful, don\u2019t you?\u201d he finished, looking intensely at Leyla, making heat pool in her gut.Leyla gulped, before she hurriedly averted her eyes from him to plop more sugar cubes into her cup of tea.\u201cI think so too, Duke.\u201d she answered quietly, staring resolutely as she swirled the sugar into her well-saturated tea. Some of the crystals refused to dissolve into the tea, before she finally gathered enough courage to look back at him once again.He was still looking at her, and it made Leyla feel more bothered, but she didn\u2019t know why. Once more she looked outside, just in time to catch sight of a different bird.\u201cOh, that one\u2019s a pigeon.\u201d She automatically supplied for him, and Matthias chuckled in amusement at her, making her flush in embarrassment as she saw him grinning at her.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Leyla\u2019s voice trailed off, before feeling foolish at telling him when he hadn\u2019t even asked. But how was she to know he knew?! He asked her about the crows after all! \u201cWell, I see.\u201d She cleared her throat and grabbed her spoon to keep stirring the tea.A pleasant smile broke out of Matthias lips as he watched her fumble in front of him discreetly. Leyla flinched when she glanced back at him before renewing her attempts at stirring her tea.Beneath the table, Leyla grew completely oblivious how close their pairs of feet had gotten, only noticing it when she felt a familiar brush of his shoes against her new ones. She glanced up at him, and he shot her another smile, sending tingling feelings in her gut\u2026Today continued to shape up into a weird, weird day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He sat there, on his table, taking in what Claudine said in frozen silence. The waiter quietly came up beside him. They dutifully wiped the table down, taking with them the untouched third cup of coffee he had ordered.They glanced over at Kyle, and felt concerned with how pale as a blank sheet he was.\u2018Don\u2019t listen to Claudine,\u2019\u00a0Kyle berated himself over and over back when he was listening to what she had to say to him. He firmly told himself that this was just how Claudine was. She hated Leyla ever since he could remember. She\u2019s trying to ruin Leyla\u2019s image\u2026And he hated how he was beginning to believe her.But he\u2019d catch himself and tell himself that this was Leyla! She was not the kind of woman who\u2019d enter willingly into an affair with an engaged man! There was no way Claudine was telling the truth!But the thought of\u00a0what if\u00a0kept bugging him. What if Claudine was telling him the truth? He did see the way the Duke had eyed Leyla, that couldn\u2019t have just been his imagination! All of a sudden he could feel a chill in the pit of his stomach as anxiousness and despair came over his thoughts.\u2018If the Duke really feels that way towards Leyla, then they could\u2026\u2019\u00a0Kyle\u2019s thoughts trailed off, before shaking the awful thought out of his mind.\u201cTheir relationship blossomed right after you left for the capital, Kyle, did you know?\u201d Claudine casually pointed out as she took a sip of her cup of coffee. Kyle knew better to believe every word Claudine said. He knew that\u2026But she made him believe they were only waiting for the right time, and he can\u2019t help the doubt forming in his mind around that. Another thing that made him doubt that she was telling him all but lies was the tone in her voice.There was something real in them. The genuine hate in her tone was unmistakable, and it strengthened the possibility that what she had been telling him had ounces of truth in them.Because as much as Claudine hated Leyla, she wasn\u2019t the type to spread false rumors about her. Not unless she knew, a hundred percent, what was going on with Leyla and the Duke. Claudine knew that if she made any false accusations, it would make her look bad. Her pride and honor would be tarnished because of misinformation.There was no way she\u2019d risk talking false slanderous things about her fiance and Leyla, just to say it in front of a doctor\u2019s son.\u2018No, it\u2019s not true. Claudine is lying, you know she\u2019s lying!\u2019\u00a0Kyle once again scolded himself, reminding him that this wasn\u2019t just anyone Claudine was implicating in having an affair with her fiance.This was Leyla.Kyle stood up with wobbly feet, and went out of the cafe with a dazed look upon his face. He was looking straight ahead of him, but not really seeing or thinking about where he would go. As the cold winds swept past him until his face numbed in the chill, he just wanted to do one thing.Shutting his dry eyes were too painful, and his breathing grew ragged the more he walked. There was a tightening in his chest that threatened to suffocate him. He can\u2019t think properly, but he knew what would give him his peace of mind back\u2026And it was still Leyla.He was the only one who could lay his troubles to rest, the only one who could provide him a real truth. The only source he trusted in this matter.He must see her. But how would he bring this up to her?*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The rest of their day was spent exchanging casual conversation with each other. Most of the time, it was Matthias initiating the conversation, asking Leyla questions every now and then to which she would respond swiftly, yet briefly.Sometimes she would ask him a few short questions, but not as much as he would. He even noticed most of the questions she\u2019d direct him were formal at best, and not really much about him in general. She was only doing so to appear polite.But he was happy he had her undivided attention. She was looking at him, and exchanging words without hints of being scared or angry with him, and was actively listening to him. He didn\u2019t know what made her act like this, but he wanted it to continue.Looking at her like this, where he could unabashedly stare at her jewel-like eyes and softly flushed cheeks was exhilarating.He took in every subtle change she made, the way her eyes would spark when he\u2019d ask her about birds, or how the tension on her shoulders slowly seeped out of her body with every passing minute. He took them all in greedily, and kept wanting for more, for they filled him up warmly in a way that sent tingles down to his toes.This was getting crazier, how badly she affected him. This couldn\u2019t be normal, but he also couldn\u2019t put a finger on it. He could feel his breath hitching the longer he stared at her, and the heated tension in his body coiling beneath his skin like a snake waiting to strike\u2026And he loved every little sensation he felt from watching her like this.\u201cAre we heading back already?\u201d Leyla asked him cautiously when she noticed Matthias glance down his wrist watch. She was looking expectantly at him, in a way that couldn\u2019t be hidden even if she tried to.\u201cAlright.\u201d Matthias agreed with a hum, brushing off entertaining thoughts on making this moment between them last a little longer.If he could make it so, this time between them would have gone on for forever.Leyla softly breathed out a sigh of relief on his acquiesce, closing her eyes in silent praise at whoever was watching over her. Upon seeing her reaction, Matthias couldn\u2019t help but feel offended at how relieved she was for this day to be over and done with.Yet he can\u2019t keep his eyes off of her.And he wanted her to look at him once more, and to keep him in her eyes at all times. There was a burning need for her, blooming in his chest that grew stronger every moment they spent together.Leyla shivered under a cold gust of wind, before feeling eyes boring holes into her, and nervously looked back at him. Her breath hitched when she saw the intense gaze he had, unconsciously wetting her lips.They had soft ragged breaths as they locked gaze, before Leyla voiced out a question that had been deeply bugging her.\u201cThis thing between us, you promise to keep it a secret right?\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but ask worriedly. Matthias quirked up a brow at her.\u201cA secret?\u201d he repeated, \u201cFrom who?\u201d\u201cFrom Uncle Bill.\u201dAh, there it was again, that name; Matthias thought bitterly, an ugly feeling rearing its head in the back of his mind. She said it so softly, you would have thought she was genuinely worried, but the look on her eyes made it seem like she was determined to make him keep it a secret from her uncle, the most.He\u2019d almost forgotten about the gardener, which was of course why Leyla\u2019s been so willing to spend time with him. Whether he really meant it as a reminder or a threat, that didn\u2019t matter. What mattered was, with Bill Remmer being held over Leyla as leverage made him unpleasant.\u201cPlease Duke, he must never know about us!\u201d Leyla pleaded desperately in a quiet voice, when a frown marred Matthias\u2019 expression.Finally, he straightened up and schooled his expressions back into his cool and indifferent demeanor.\u201cDo you really think you can hold out on never telling Bill our relationship together until your dying breath?\u201d Matthias asked her with a tilt in his head.He knew this thing between them cannot stay like this forever, especially not this type of affair, but it seemed like Leyla had completely misunderstood him once more. She was fond of doing that.\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018until\u00a0my dying breath\u2019?!\u201d she asked, startled at the implications as she looked at him in alarm. All of a sudden, it quickly shifted into a defensive expression.The Duke was due to marry Lady Brandt by summer at the earliest possible moment. What he had with her was a mere shallow obsession which she was indulging in. He shouldn\u2019t force her to continue with their deal even after he\u2019d tied a knot with some other woman!It isn\u2019t right! Leyla won\u2019t allow that to ever happen! Was he planning on making her miserable the rest of her life?!Her hands trembled in front of her.\u2018Forever,\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought hatefully,\u00a0\u2018Such a powerful word to use with our relationship.\u2019\u00a0she couldn\u2019t help but think bitterly.Matthias only hummed after he regarded her carefully, shrugging his shoulders.\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d he began once more, \u201cOne way or another, he will find out about us. Aren\u2019t you supposed to prepare yourself for that probability?\u201d he asked her coldly, rephrasing his question as he took a sip on his glass of water.\u201cNo!\u201d Leyla exclaimed, frustration and anger leaking out of her shouted whisper as she looked around them nervously, before glaring back at him with all the rage she could muster. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you or anyone who knows will never speak about this to him!\u201dShe would leave him before he could ever tie her permanently to him! She\u2019d make sure of it! Above all, she won\u2019t ever let Uncle Bill know about what she\u2019d done.She can\u2019t hurt him like that! She was already upset she had to sleep with him for her uncle\u2019s freedom, but she can take it. She can\u2019t take the thought of causing her uncle grief.If he would ever find out what she\u2019d been doing with the Duke, he would be heartbroken about how low she\u2019d gotten! She\u2019ll have to be extra careful from now on, and make sure this affair between them would be over quickly and to never owe the duke anything ever again!So she\u2019d have to be a better toy for him, an obedient doll to his advances. She\u2019d do anything!\u201cDuke,\u201d she called out, begging for him to hear her as she looked up at him in a pleading manner. \u201cDuke, please\u2026\u201dMatthias stared into her eyes with a sharp look on his face. He could clearly see the fear, mixed with a hint of expectancy in her eyes as she looked at him. It was like something awoke deep inside him as he looked into those two glimmering green orbs of hers\u2026Ah, she was so beautiful like this. He really wanted to have her\u2026And he did. He did have her\u2026But then a frown came upon him as he thought deeply about that fact.\u2018Do I really have her all to myself?\u2019With her dream of leaving Arvis behind, and to marry a random man slipping through her fingers, she had nowhere to go, but stay in Arvis, where he could see her whenever he liked. She\u2019d willingly allowed him to bed her, time and time again, solidifying she was his to have and his to use.It was just as he planned it to be. All he needed to do now, was to just do as he wanted, and nothing more.With a tired sigh, he gave Leyla a terse nod, signifying whatever news Bill Remmer would get about them, would never come from him. After all, it was only a matter of time now, but Leyla didn\u2019t have to know he intended for everyone around them to know she was his.When that would be, he couldn\u2019t really tell.All he knew was that he didn\u2019t want to let her go, and that was the big mystery wasn\u2019t it? He couldn\u2019t fathom his obsession with her. Why is it, with all the women in the world, he chose a woman who was essentially nothing for him?Had he gone insane after all? Was it because she was alway hard to get, even though he\u2019d finally gotten a taste of her? Until when will she continue to torture him this way?Leyla was completely oblivious to his turmoil, sighing in complete relief when he\u2019d given her his word. She\u2019d always been so uncomfortable around him, and couldn\u2019t help but be terrified to be in his presence, but that intimidating air around him was strangely absent for today.Instead, there was something blooming in her chest, something she barely felt before.Suddenly, Matthias stood up, and came up beside her. Leyla followed his movements, looking up at him. He stared down at her with a contemplative gaze, before he just grabbed her by the shin, freezing her to shock at his sudden movements.Suddenly, she took back what she had just thought about not being fearful of him today. She was growing terrified of him right now. She tried to move away from his grip, but he only tightened it up, refusing to let her move.He kept looking down on her, it was like he was boring his eyes straight into her soul, seeing things she didn\u2019t know about her. Eventually, he let her go, pulling away from her.She heaved a breath of relief, looking up at him in a nervous manner, as she massaged her chin, still feeling the ghost of his grip on her. She wondered what he was thinking during that moment, which made her feel a little bit flustered, but she didn\u2019t know why.All she hoped was that he didn\u2019t see how flustered he\u2019d made her.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He told her, and outstretched a hand for her to take. Feeling the eyes trailed on them, Leyla reluctantly took it. As soon as she stood up, Matthias gripped her hand tight, making her wince at his grip as he half dragged her behind him.She bit into her lip, keeping her head trailed down on the ground as she hurried behind him, to keep up with his pace. She wanted nothing more than to scream, but she couldn\u2019t find it in her to do it.Instead, she could only watch as the shoelaces he\u2019d tied on her shoes swayed with every step she took.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Kyle headed back to Arvis as soon as he\u2019d shaken out of his shock, making haste to not waste any more daylight. He soon reached the crossroads that led straight to Etman street, and completely bypassed it.He was focused on reaching Arvis as soon as possible. It was his utmost priority. Nothing else mattered right now. In his one-track focus, he failed to notice just whose car it was that had passed him by.Matthias\u2019 eyes narrowed when he caught sight of Kyle as he stared out the car\u2019s windows. He had a determined look on his face as he stared straight ahead, and he had a good guess at why that is.Why else would he be visiting Arvis outside of his father\u2019s visits to the mansion? He was headed there for Leyla.Matthias took a deep breath, before looking over to the recently vacated space beside him.He was content in delivering her straight in front of her cabin, but Leyla insisted they drop her off somewhere in the downtown area of Carlsbar. She reasoned out she had just remembered she had something to do there, and so with great reluctance, he let her leave.But he knew she was only making excuses to get away from him.She had looked so transparent, the nervousness and fear in her eyes were blatant to him as she asked him to drop her off there. But Matthias soon found out that the look on her face was starting to get old. He cannot find any more amusement in that expression of hers.And he\u2019d been so happy to see her cry before too. He felt such immense satisfaction in bringing her to tears, begging in front of him so beautifully, yet none of those familiar sensations came at that moment.It made him wonder what it really was he wanted from her if not for her misery?The first time he took notice of Kyle, a similar question came to his mind. It was seeded into him at that moment when he first saw how Leyla was around Kyle, and grew into a forest of nagging questions, plaguing his mind day and night.He\u2019d always seen them together, so unabashedly content in each other\u2019s presence, up until their engagement being called off. Leyla, when she\u2019d been with Kyle, always wore a bright and happy smile on her face.And suddenly, his mouth felt dry at remembering that, making him swallow down his unease.She did not hold back in doling out smiles and loving gaze at Kyle. She kept giving it out without a second thought, even if Kyle couldn\u2019t offer her what she wanted like he could. No matter what Kyle did, Leyla continued to be by his side, giving him all her time and attention.But Matthias reminded himself he no longer needed to worry about Kyle. Leyla was his now, in a way Kyle could never have her. He knew things about Leyla that Kyle never did. She wouldn\u2019t dare leave him for an old flame.But that fact is rendered meaningless when Leyla would not even accept him as she did with Kyle so freely. And maybe that\u2019s why Kyle\u2019s presence unnerved him greatly, because he had Leyla, in the way Matthias wanted her.Continuing this line of thought would only bring more discomfort for himself. And he knew he\u2019d never have that kind of relationship with Leyla, yet he couldn\u2019t stop longing to have it. Matthias wanted to erase their pasts, and start anew. Take back those things he did, but he can\u2019t.But when the car rolled into a stop in front of his mansion, gone was the turmoil in Matthias face, and stepped out of the car with a schooled expression.\u201cWelcome back, Duke Herhardt!\u201d Claudine exclaimed, as she went out to greet him back home. Matthias stared at her for a moment, confused as to why she was here when she was supposed to be back in Brandt estate, like their other guests who went home.\u201cMy Lady,\u201d he greeted with a practiced smile, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were waiting for me here.\u201d He greeted back, kissing her on the cheeks as soon as she got close and pulled away, looking at her with an unspoken question.\u2018Why are you here?\u2019\u201cOh, yes, I decided to wait for your return here.\u201d Claudine replied back with her own smile, \u201cI wanted to spend more time with you, so waiting for your return in your own estate was only more practical.\u201dClaudine eyed Matthias with a critical gaze. She then pulled her hands away from his and clasped them demurely in front of her as she met his own assessing stare.\u201cDidn\u2019t you miss me too while you were away?\u201d She asked in an innocent voice, her eyes glancing behind him to look at the empty backseat. She then looked back at him with a prompting gaze.Matthias only widened his smile at her, as though he was pleased with her reasoning.\u201cOf course,\u201d he replied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLeyla knelt on her cabin floors, furiously scrubbing the floorboards clean before she sighed out tiredly, and swiped off some of the sweat off her brows. With the sunbeam light flowing into the room, she could see the fine dust particles floating all over her.The cold was also beginning to subside in the air, signifying that winter was about to come to an end.Despite that, Leyla couldn\u2019t help but think about how strange Kyle had been when she\u2019d returned to Arvis from Carlsbar. Even remembering the look on his face gave her endless confusion about why he\u2019d been acting so weird.It\u2019s been a few days since it happened, yet still she reached no conclusion.She had been successful in making the Duke drop her off in Carlsbar, and went home on her own. Upon her way home, she\u2019d encountered Kyle on the road to Arvis, just as Kyle was just about to leave.\u201cLeyla\u2026\u201d he called out to her with a breathy voice. He looked calm to her, but something in his voice made her think like he wanted to cry for some unknown reason.She wanted to go to him, and ask about how he is, but she caught sight of her shoes, and forced herself not to. These shoes were the ones the Duke had just bought for her, and it reminded her why she needed to get away from Kyle.He repeated her name a few more times, it was almost like he was seeing her, but at the same time, it was like he wasn\u2019t actually\u00a0seeing\u00a0her. It was like his mind was stuck somewhere. At one point it seemed like he was looking right through her and proceeded to look up at the sky.His hands had been shaking when he ran them across his face. Whether it was from the cold or something else, she couldn\u2019t tell. And then he left, without talking to her or looking back at her once more.A few passerbys had seen them, looking over at them curiously, wondering what happened between them now as Kyle continued to walk in a daze passed them. They shot Leyla questioning glances as soon as they noticed his red-rimmed eyes.All the while Leyla could only figure out he\u2019d stopped by for something, as did the others who saw them.But from their point of view, it didn\u2019t seem like that last time Kyle had sought out Leyla.Kyle had been Leyla\u2019s broken first love, but before that he\u2019d been like a brother and her best friend. But gone were the days they would have freely confided in one another, those unspoken conversations they\u2019d exchange across the room with a simple exchange of glances.By now Leyla had completely lost her ability to read Kyle.\u201cLeyla!\u201d a new voice came, shaking her out of her memories.Immediately, Leyla jolted back in attention and put down her cleaning brushes, before running towards the front of the house. It was the mailman! She immediately swung the door open, running out to excitedly receive the telegram delivered by her uncle.She thanked him profusely for his hard work and he gave her a wave of goodbye. As soon as he was gone from her sight, she immediately went back inside and ripped open the envelope to read the letter Uncle Bill had sent her with a quick skim of her eyes. Immediately all the thoughts and worries flowed out of her, temporarily forgotten the more she read the letter!Uncle Bill was coming back to Arvis in two days!*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Lunch in the Arvis mansion was always a quiet affair, and it didn\u2019t change even when Claudine was there, temporarily living under their roof. Soft clanging sounds of cutlery, and scraping sounds echoed along with light chatter among the three ladies in Arvis mansion.The air around them was warm and pleasant as the beautiful spread of food was laid out in front of them. The sunlight streaming into the room made it seem as though spring had just arrived, despite the winter barely beginning its descent.\u201cI like it whenever Claudine stays in the mansion with us here,\u201d Elysee praised the young girl, shooting a grin over her soon-to-be daughter-in-law. \u201cArvis feels so full whenever she\u2019s around!\u201d\u201cI completely agree,\u201d Norma hummed, exchanging smiles with her companions, as Claudine gracefully set her utensils down and demurely wiped the food from her lips, \u201cHaving her around is very reassuring.\u201d Norma finished.\u201cI\u2019m very happy you both think so, my Duchesses.\u201d Claudine beamed at them gracefully, \u201cFor a while I worried I was being burdensome, staying in Arvis for too long.\u201d\u201cNonsense, Claudine,\u201d Norma assured her, before quickly glancing over to her grandson who had been quiet as he ate, \u201cI\u2019m sure had the wedding not been postponed due to unseen circumstances, you\u2019d already be part of the family. Don\u2019t you agree so too, Matthias?\u201dAt hearing his name, Matthias finally looked up from his plate, and spared Claudine a glance, before giving the ladies his usual smile, a smile Claudine was all too familiar with. It was his polite smile, that although looked as though it held no ill-intentions, it sent cold shivers down her spine.Only, Matthias wasn\u2019t answering Norma right away. Instead, he grabbed a glass of water, and took a long, composed sip on his glass of water, making Claudine more uneasy about the changes with him. She had thought she\u2019d stick to his usual style of giving short and succinct replies, but he wasn\u2019t, and the conversation turned into different matters in Matthias\u2019 silence.Claudine wondered what Kyle was doing with the information she\u2019d given him. Had he not confronted them about it?Claudine\u2019s hands, which were hidden beneath the table clutched tightly onto the table napkins, crumpling them in her tightened fists in worry. And then the topic quickly shifted about the recent rumors in Arvis.The one about Leyla.\u201cI guess after what happened, the doctor\u2019s son and the gardener\u2019s foster child will always cross paths with each other.\u201d Elysee sighed out with complete disinterest. Duchess Norma on the other hand, seemed to be excited with this information.\u201cOh, you mean Kyle and Leyla? Oh what a lovely couple they could have been.\u201d Norma sighed wistfully, \u201cHad Mrs. Etman not done what she did, they would have been married by now!\u201d she exclaimed indignantly on the wronged couple\u2019s behalf.\u201cI remember seeing them as children, they really liked each other so much back then too! Got along swimmingly.\u201d Norma continued to praise them, Elysee hummed in slight agreement.\u201cYes, I can\u2019t disagree with you on that.\u201d Elysee told Norma, \u201cDoes this mean he\u2019s ready to go against his mother\u2019s wishes and elope with Leyla instead? Run away far from Arvis?\u201d she asked a little more curiously than before.Norma hummed and frowned at the thought.\u201cDo you think Kyle should start acting so callously now?\u201d Norma asked back a little disapprovingly at the thought of Kyle going against his mother\u2019s wishes. \u201cStill, these are still just hearsays, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on between them.\u201dNorma sighed and straightened out in her seat, before continuing.\u201cBesides, I think Kyle should give his mother a few more years to think about it. He\u2019s still young, and has his whole life ahead of him. Time will tell whether he\u2019ll really risk his relationship with his mother over a first love.\u201dClaudine blinked back in shock at the older matriarch\u2019s words.\u201cI\u2019m surprised you think that Duchess Norma,\u201d Claudine piped up after she finished, \u201cDon\u2019t you like Leyla?\u201d Claudine shot Matthias a discreet glance out of curiosity, yet he was still calmly eating his food as though he could care less about what was being talked about.\u201cOh, I completely adore Bill\u2019s niece!\u201d Norma praised, \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely a sight to behold and such a good-natured girl too, very agreeable that girl.\u201d she smiled, before sighing out with a sad smile, \u201cBut marriage and feelings are a different matter, and it doesn\u2019t matter if I like her or not.\u201dNorma proceeded to tell them that although Mrs. Etman was publicly shamed and ridiculed for her garish behavior which led to the engagement being broken off, no one could really fault her for her reasoning. Especially not with the upper-class mothers.All mothers want only the best for their sons, Mrs. Etman was no different. She went about it the wrong way, but her heart was in the right place.\u201cHmm,\u201d Claudine nodded in understanding, \u201cThough I really think Kyle wants to marry Leyla. He wants to be with her with all his heart.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m surprised you think so my dear,\u201d Norma hummed towards her, \u201cAs your own family\u2019s heir, shouldn\u2019t you know by now that feelings don\u2019t matter in marriages?\u201d Norma asked her curiously. \u201cHaving an orphaned person as a daughter-in-law has no place in the Etman household in the first place.\u201dNorma didn\u2019t mean it in any malicious way. It was just a fact in their society.Claudine nodded at the older matriarch in understanding like the good girl that she was. She chanced a glance over to Matthias, to gouge out his own reaction to what his grandmother just said.\u2018Just this once,\u2019\u00a0She wished in her mind,\u00a0\u2018Let me see behind his mask.\u2019But Matthias was good at pretending. He only looked at his grandmother with an agreeable smile on his face. The fact he could pretend so indifferently unnerved Claudine deeply.Yesterday afternoon, Claudine had been with the two Duchesses, and they all spotted Leyla walking weirdly through the woods as though she was trying to hide from anyone\u2019s sight. What Claudine regretted most was how the other two Duchess had to witness how pathetic Leyla was acting, even though she was sneaking around just to meet up with the Duke.\u2018Are you happy having the love of this kind of a man, Leyla?\u2019\u00a0Claudine wondered as she looked at the Duke\u2019s gentle smile that he would dole out to any noble woman,\u00a0\u2018No, does Matthias even know how to love someone?\u2019Finally, she averted her gaze from him, feeling that small pity she held for Leyla for capturing the attention of such a cold-hearted man. Leyla had already lost Kyle Etman, someone who undoubtedly loved her as though she was the only treasure in the world, and now she was subjected to the whims of a powerful ice king.In Matthias mind, he saw no need to butt into their conversation. What his grandmother had said was a fact he wouldn\u2019t dispute. And she was also correct in her assessment of Leyla, it was why he wanted her as his mistress. Because in doing so, he\u2019d have her and not completely destroy the prospects of his future.He was only doing what he must do.All in all, lunch between them was an uneventful affair, ending with Claudine continuing to spend time with her soon-to-be in-laws for some tea, while Matthias opted to go out for a walk alone in the forest.Afternoons in Arvis had most of the birds chirping overhead in the trees, echoing clearly throughout the quiet nature as the warm sunlight shed light all over everything.Matthias took off in the familiar forest path, with an inexplicable sense of restlessness deep within his chest. Almost as though they were overriding his rational thoughts, filling his head completely with the idea of breaking off his engagement with Claudine\u2026And putting Leyla in that place instead.Just up ahead, saw the unmistakable cabin that housed that person that restlessly filled his mind. He hadn\u2019t intended to be here, but he wasn\u2019t intending to turn around and go back. Instead, he pushed on with a renewed vigor in his steps as the sunlight continued to bathe him in its warm glow.Spring really is coming.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When Leyla got back to Arvis, the sky had been covered with red and orange hues as the sun sunk in the west. She was pedaling as fast as she could, not wanting to reach home by dark. There was a brown paper back on her bike\u2019s basket, rustling against the wind as she picked up speed.She had gone out to buy some ingredients for Uncle Bill\u2019s favorite foods as his welcoming feast. She could only imagine the stories he had for her upon his return when they\u2019d sit by the table to eat the meal she would cook. She really was looking forward to seeing him again!Maybe by then, she\u2019ll also be able to find the courage to convince her Uncle to move away from Arvis with her. To start their lives anew away from the Duke.Convincing him would take some time, but it wasn\u2019t impossible. She knew with Uncle Bill by her side, all will be right in the world again. He kept saying that to her when she was young after all. He\u2019d talked about his own dreams about moving away from Arvis when the work would get too much for him.Of course, his moving away did not mean\u00a0far from Arvis. He wanted to stay close, but within the estate grounds. She was certain she could convince him to move farther away. And once she could leave with him, she\u2019ll look for a different job.She\u2019d teach new students in a new school, and forget about Arvis, and continue life with Uncle Bill and live happily ever after! Much like they did in Arvis before this whole thing with the Duke started.The more she dreamed about what may be, the lighter the feeling in her got. She\u2019d been thinking about this ever since she asked for a transfer to a different school far away from Arvis. She even got rid of the new clothes and shoes he\u2019d bought her.They were not what she was after all. They didn\u2019t scream\u00a0Leyla Lewellin.It wasn\u2019t right for her to be selfish and take them as compensation for what he\u2019s doing to her. She knew how deep the poison of greed could get and wanted nothing to do with it. All she wanted is to erase every bad thing that fell on her that night in the gazebo, that night she first interacted with the Duke.Until she\u2019d erase the image of him entering her life, talking amicably with her fiance.But before that, she must first organize all the things she\u2019d bought, and then change into more comfortable clothes. And then she\u2019d head out to feed their livestock. Things were going to get busier, so she had to be more productive.She was finally within sight of her cabin, and let out a pleased sigh at seeing her home, and quickened up some more, eager to get home as she rode down the forest path. She should also start preparing for her dinner and get the house warmed up too!She parked her bike in front of the cabin, grabbing the shopping bags with her as she opened the door to let herself in. In her excitement, she completely failed to notice the presence of her current companion\u2026\u201cWelcome back, Leyla.\u201d A cool voice from behind greeted her, a cold shiver shooting up her spine at the sound of that unmistakable voice. In her shock, she scrambled to catch the bag she had been carrying in her haste to look at her trespasser!There, seated on her dearest uncle\u2019s chair, was none other than Matthias, sitting in crossed legs, as he lounged back in his seat. He was looking at her in an intense gaze that made Leyla feel he was about to do something to her.She wanted to believe this was all just a nightmare, that she was seeing things, but she wasn\u2019t. He really was in her own home!\u201cWh-why are you here!?\u201d she squeaked out, stuttering in his sudden presence. Matthias only shrugged as he looked around.\u201cIt\u2019s my property, why should I not be here?\u201d he asked her with a hint of a challenge.\u201cIt might be your estate, but you\u2019ve given us this place as our home!\u201d\u201cAnd so what if it is?\u201dLeyla couldn\u2019t help but scoff at his callousness and disregard of their privacy.\u201cIt means you can\u2019t just invite yourself to come in here as you please!\u201d She immediately put the shopping bag down by the edge of the kitchen table, before going back to face him and firmly gestured towards the door. \u201cLeave.\u201d She demanded from him.Matthias held her gaze as he slowly stood up in his seat, and stalked over to her with a smirk like a predator would to a prey. He took a once over at her body, before the smirk slid off his face at the sight of her shoes.Once again she was wearing those awfully stained shoes, when it was clear he made her throw them away. Even her coat wasn\u2019t the one he\u2019d bought for her to wear. He clearly adored her stubbornness, sure. But something churned deep in Matthias\u2019 gut at the thought of her disregarding what he\u2019d just given her.And he didn\u2019t like that.Leyla thought he was finally leaving and grabbed the door handle to hold it out for him as he left. But as soon as she tried to swing the door open, Matthias quickly whirled her back to face him, and slammed the door behind her, pinning her against the door.Leyla\u2019s breathing grew ragged as she looked up at him in fright. And then Matthias dipped his head down\u2026Taking Leyla\u2019s lips into a searing kiss.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Seeing her back in these shabby clothes, and poor state of dress couldn\u2019t help but mock Matthias\u2019 rose tinted glasses on their last moments in Carlsbar.Matthias had already felt foolish when he found himself in the empty cabin. He was feeling lost without Leyla, and just kept walking around as he ran the memories of her over and over in his mind.He had entertained thoughts of letting her go like she was nothing to him. But it seemed he was the one who was nothing to her! But he can\u2019t help but want her too. She possessed something in her that drove him wild beyond what his mind could comprehend!And it\u2019s been like that for a long time now. Perhaps, ever since the beginning.\u201cWhat is wrong with you?!\u201d Leyla couldn\u2019t help but ask him as tears threatened to escape her, \u201cYou don\u2019t have any right to do this to me!\u201d she quickly darted out from under him, but just as quickly as she escaped, he pushed her into the kitchen table, making the shopping bag tumble off the edge, and sounds of glass jars being broken clanged in the kitchen.\u201cRight?\u201d Matthias asked her, a hint of incredulity in his tone, \u201cYou think I have no right?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Leyla spat back at him, \u201cYou don\u2019t have any right to come here and do these things with me!\u201dOnce again, she couldn\u2019t help but feel foolish at how she allowed herself to lower her guard around him all because of that one day in Carlsbar. That day was now just another distant dream. She shouldn\u2019t have expected anything different from him.This would always be how things would be with Matthias.\u201cI am already catering to whatever you want me to do, so why do you insist on making my life so miserable?!\u201d she persisted, \u201cDidn\u2019t you give me your word to never come here?! To my cabin with my uncle!?\u201dShe tried to push him away again, but she was physically weak against him. He grabbed her by the waist, securing her tightly towards him as she continued to struggle, making sure she didn\u2019t have any room to escape from him.It only made Leyla more frustrated with him.She\u2019d seen the Duke and Claudin by the stables on her way back\u00a0 just yesterday, being such a typical couple. She\u2019d stop by because the stable keeper was a close friend of her uncle, so she went to help by pulling a cart full of hay behind her. Afterwards, she would feed the cattle they were raising in Arvis just as she did every other day.He had offered to pull the cart for her, but Leyla had insisted she could handle it, firmly refusing his help. And she was successful, but she found herself in an unexpected place.Lady Brandt was with the Duke walking, with her arm in his, down the path located between the stables and the forest.It was odd seeing her there, because she wasn\u2019t the type of woman to be casually taking a stroll outside of the mansion, or the nearby promenade in the estate. Leyla was terrified at the idea of Claudine noticing her, and immediately hid behind the trees in an attempt to remain inconspicuous.At that moment, Claudine\u2019s head whipped back to her direction, but Leyla saw no indication she had been spotted. After a few tense moments of Leyla wishing to every deity up above she would remain unseen, they resumed their walk until they disappeared in Leyla\u2019s line of sight.Without wasting more time, Leyla immediately hauled the partially filled cart behind her through the trees, heart racing at the close call. She tried not to run too fast as the hays began spilling out of the cart, but she still returned home in record time, with a few hays bundled in her arms.She looked like an absolute mess, with strands of hays sticking on her clothes and out of her hair.That strange feeling in her chest was back again. It happened every time she\u2019d see those two together, which she chalked up to her guilt for Claudine, and fear of Matthias. Still, it was almost like a mix of relief, shame\u2026 and oddly enough, sadness.\u201cWhy are you even doing this now?!\u201d Leyla cried out, \u201cWere these days too boring without your daily dose of tormenting me that you would rather come here just to amuse yourself?!\u201dShe wanted him to give her answers and to tell her why! Why, out of all the girls, he chose her to play with? Why did he keep coming back just to make her life a living hell? She knew it was meaningless to ask, but she wanted to lash out at him.To make him suffer as she did. To feel all the pain he caused her.These emotions were clawing at her walls, gnawing at her thoughts that she has every reason to torment and disrespect the Duke! And she wanted to see it too. Just the thought of seeing the hurt in him made her feel a different kind of exhilaration, she wanted it now.The more she thought back to that day in Carlsbar, the more the rage in her was fuelled.\u201cYou talk too much Leyla.\u201d Matthias finally spoke in a calm voice, as he glared down at her shuddering form. But her words kept ringing around in his head, echoing them louder and louder, making his grip on her tighten up.Leyla froze in shock at the coldness in his tone, but she refused to back down as fiery resentment blazed inside her chest.\u201cThen I suggest you stop playing around so much!\u201d she hissed, \u201cYou\u2019re a real piece of work, you know that? Always do what you want and then leave as soon as you\u2019re done having your fun with no regard for anyone else but yourself!\u201dAs she spewed out everything she\u2019d been holding back, she kept her eyes on him, locking gazes with Matthias, not willing to let go. She was eager to see that hurt in his eyes.\u201cSo tell me, Duke ,\u201d she said his title with such contempt, \u201cDo you want your plaything to undress for you? Oh! But I remember you find it so dull! You know what? You\u2019re so used to doing what you want anyway so go ahead!\u201dShe dared him, finally stopping her resistance in his hold.\u201cGo ahead and take me in whatever way you want then. I don\u2019t care either way. Not anymore.\u201d She finished, heaving a breath as she waited for him to make a move.\u201cStop this nonsense Leyla.\u201d Matthias scolded, a frown marring his features, yet Leyla remained indifferent, a sense of satisfaction filling her at the shaky tone in his voice.\u201cWhy? Am I getting too boring for you already? Come on! Didn\u2019t you say I\u2019m so amusing to you?\u201d she asked again, \u201cYou see, this is all that you\u2019re good for, Duke Herhardt . You take and take and take, until nothing you like is left for you to take and then throw it out.\u201dMatthias\u2019 breathing quickened with every word Leyla let loose.\u201cSo just throw me away now, and I\u2019ll thank you for it.\u201d She felt him loosening his grip on her waist and stood a little taller in front of him. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019ll be the one good thing you\u2019ll ever be able to do for me \u2013 ACK! \u201dA stinging sensation was left on her cheek as she was suddenly facing the table. Matthias wasted no time in grabbing her by the waist, and laid her out on the table as she whirled around to face him, a hand cupping her reddened cheek from where he backhanded her.\u201cAnd how about you?\u201d Matthias growled as he pinned her down on the table, forcibly slotting his body between her legs, bunching up her skirt around her waist, \u201cAren\u2019t you loving the way you drive me crazy too?\u201d he asked her, a manic look in his eyes as he stared at her.He immediately took hold of her wrists, even the one that had just been cupping her cheeks and held them in one hand to pin on the table, in the spot above her head. Leyla looked up at him with a smug look of her own.\u201cPerhaps just as much as you enjoy seeing me cry.\u201dOnce more, Leyla reminded herself to never cry in front of him. She must hold herself together, until she\u2019d see the torment in his eyes\u2026But then her expectations were shattered when Matthias began chuckling slowly to himself, before blowing out into a fully blown manic laughter and threw his head back as he laughed at her. When he looked back at her, she could only see the face of a person who had finally snapped out of his sanity.\u201cThen, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s only fair by now to see you cry too, my Leyla?\u201dWasting no time, his free hand grabbed Leyla by the chin roughly. She was certain he would be leaving not just hickeys on her skin by the end of the night. She only prayed they\u2019d be gone by the time her uncle returns.However, she wasn\u2019t one to back down easily with Matthias, but he won\u2019t let her continue to speak, clamping her jaw shut with his strong grip around her mouth.\u201cThen, let\u2019s begin our pleasurable deal with each other, shall we?\u201d he purred\u00a0 in a low baritone, before she heard the sound of cloth ripping and the sensation of the cool air hitting her legs before he drowned her in the beginning of heated kisses he would leave with her tonight.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The last few days was the time Kyle needed to stop sending himself into a panic attack at Claudine\u2019s words. He needed to distance himself for a while to organize his thoughts before he could even begin to confront Leyla with Claudine\u2019s accusations.It was getting late, but Kyle knew by now Leyla was back in her cabin, and he could talk to her there alone, without any prying ears or eyes to spread further rumors about them.He still had that nagging feeling of a small chance that what Lady Brandt had been telling him was true, but his loyalty to Leyla made him refuse to entertain it. He\u2019d go over there, and lay his mind to rest, and Leyla would assure him all that Claudine said was a lie.He believed Leyla. He knew she wouldn\u2019t lie to him, not with this.\u2018But what if she confirms everything is true? And that\u2019s why she\u2019d never go back to you?\u2019There was that nasty voice in the back of his mind again, growing louder the longer he put it off. He\u2019d been yelling at himself to shut up for hours on end since he returned from Carlsbar, but it kept going louder and louder, making him lose sleep and more of his waning sanity.But if it is even true, maybe Leyla was in trouble! He needed to help her! He knew she wouldn\u2019t ask for help, so that\u2019s why he must go to her and assure her that he has her back, all she needed to do was to let him.He eventually stopped in front of her dark cabin. He took a pause outside as he slowly got off his bike, parking it beside the cabin\u2019s storage hut. Was Leyla asleep?Should he come back tomorrow?\u2018No,\u2019\u00a0Kyle thought to himself as he approached the cabin\u2019s entrance with a determined look,\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s better to rip the band-aid off quickly.\u2019But the more he got closer, the nasty voice in his head grew louder, making his anxiety worse and his stomach churned uncomfortably with every step he took. There were odd sounds coming from inside the house, but it was so muffled that he couldn\u2019t hear it clearly\u2026He went to knock on the door, but a light gust of wind blew past him, making the door swing minusculely open. Kyle paused as his heart froze, he could clearly hear some ragged breaths inside.Quietly, he pushed open the door.Thump\u2026Thump\u2026Thump\u2026His heartbeat thundered in his chest as the ringing in his ear grew louder, drowning out that nasty voice in the back of his mind.\u00a0He could feel his breathing quickening at the sight of\u00a0\u00a0a fallen bag of groceries on the floor thrown haphazardly all over\u2026The next he saw\u00a0some shards of glass glinting in the moonlight\u2026The next he saw was a fallen bag of groceries, with some shards of glass glinting in the moonlight\u2026And then he was drawn to the sounds of the table squeaking as it rocked back and forth. In the dark, he could faintly make out a silhouette of a man rutting on the table\u2019s surface. He was huddled over something he couldn\u2019t make out just yet as he groaned, breathing in ragged breaths\u2026And then he could hear more sounds, like flesh slapping sloppily against each other, and the unmistakable sound of a woman moaning.\u00a0 And then his eyesight adjusted, he could see the tight grip of a smaller arm,\u00a0fingers digging into the man\u2019s clothed back\u2026And then his eyes adjusted further, that he could make out a golden color of the woman\u2019s hair beneath the man\u2019s form, and the way her legs wrapped around the man\u2019s waist with a face full of bliss\u2026It was\u2026\u201cLeyla\u2026\u201d he breathed out in a shocked daze, and Leyla\u2019s eyes snapped open as she finally took note of their unexpected guest.\u00a0Even Matthias stilled in his movements, his looming form seemed to be hiding Leyla from his view, but Kyle could see Leyla\u2019s flushed face as she stared at him with wide eyes.Time stopped as the three of them all locked gazes with one another, until the ringing in Kyle\u2019s ears turned into a deafening silence, and his breathing calmed down to a stop before his eyes shifted to look at the Duke with an indecipherable gaze.Matthias finally straightened out, his clothes having long been rumpled over the beginnings of what could have been another night of pleasure, while Leyla was only partially undressed, the top of her dress hanging off her shoulders, as her breasts laid bare for all to see.Kyle\u2019s eyes were fully adjusted by now, and could see the blooming hickeys left on Leyla\u2019s collarbone,\u00a0as well as the forming wrinkles on the Duke\u2019s usually pristine clothes. He looked so unbothered too at being discovered, while Leyla hurriedly got up to right her clothes\u2026Alarm bells began ringing the back of Kyle\u2019s mind, but the voice in his head stayed oddly quiet\u2026\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but softly ask them instead, body numb at what he had just witnessed. Matthias only stared at him nonchalantly as he straightened up to his full height, allowing Leyla to scramble behind him to cover her indecency.\u201cWhat do you think we\u2019re doing?\u201d he asked the new arrival.And then Kyle\u2019s world turned red\u2026He could barely register Leyla calling out for his name, begging for him to stop as he wrestled with Matthias. He had just tackled Matthias with a scream of rage, yelling profanities at how lowly he was treating Leyla.He\u2019d hit Matthias, and the Duke would hit back just as hard, but the adrenaline running through his veins made him oblivious at how poorly matched he was.The only thought he could think about was how he should be protecting Leyla from such a vile man!At some point, Matthias spared Leyla a glance, and completely missed the fist Kyle threw out to him while Leyla rushed to Kyle\u2019s side, as he was momentarily shocked.Matthias could feel the taste of copper filling his mouth.They both were pleading with each other by now. Leyla kept insisting that Kyle should just leave her behind and that she was fine, while Kyle yelling at him accusations and promises of taking Leyla away from Arvis, while \u2026And it just made Matthias\u2019 blood boil and grabbed Kyle away from Leyla and resumed their fighting. In Matthias\u2019 mind, Kyle must disappear, and then Leyla can be his!\u201cKyle!\u201d Leyla screamed out worriedly as she watched in horror as the two men threw fists at each other once more!Kyle was not a fighter, Leyla knew that best, it\u2019s what she liked about him. But Matthias was. He was a seasoned soldier, who had fought in battles before, Kyle had no chance of winning against him!She could see the way Matthias was pummeling Kyle, and she feared if she couldn\u2019t stop them from going further, Kyle would end up dead because of her\u2026\u201cKyle, stop it please!\u201d she yelled out, tears falling down in rivers from her eyes. \u201cDuke stop!\u201d\u00a0Still, not one of them seemed to be listening to her anymore, both men had their senses overridden by adrenaline and anger.\u201cStop!\u201d\u00a0she screamed, voice cracking as she yelled out in frustration and fear,\u00a0yet both men remained deaf to her cries\u2026\u201cI love him!\u201d she exclaimed, her sudden declaration stilling both men into a stop as she sobbed desperately at Kyle\u2019s\u00a0now swollen eyes, \u201cI love him, Kyle\u2026 I love him\u2026\u201d she cried out as her heart broke for a second time at seeing the fierce protectiveness in Kyle\u2019s eyes diminish in front of her\u2026Matthias looked down, spitting the blood out of his mouth as he finally got off of Kyle\u2019s prone form, finally calm enough to let the man stagger up to his feet to approach his woman.\u201cIt\u2019s not true\u2026 Leyla, tell me it\u2019s not true and I\u2019ll protect you this time\u2026 I swear it\u2026\u201d Kyle whispered as he stared desperately in front of her through his remaining good eye, but Leyla only shook her head at him as she continued to sob at how terrible he looked\u2026And it was all because of her.\u201cI love him Kyle,\u201d she lied through her teeth, before taking a deep breath to look at him more calmly to convince him, \u201cAnd that\u2019s the truth.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She couldn\u2019t bear to look at him after that, letting tears flow freely down her cheeks at the way her heart was tearing apart in the knowledge she had to hurt Kyle to save him.Kyle could feel the aches Matthias\u2019 blows dealt him with, but none of them hurt as much as Leyla telling him she loved the Duke\u2026But seeing her cry in front of him hurt even more, as her tears hit the back of his hands that lied limply in front of him. So with a shaky hand, he went to gently cup her cheeks, futilely wiping her tears away. It was like she was sapped of all her spirit.He took in her appearance, eyeing bitterly the telltale signs of what they were about to do, like her tangled locks, and her haphazardly clothed torso. He could even feel the way she began to shake in his hands\u2026\u201cSo please Kyle, stop this,\u201d Leyla whispered softly, \u201cI did do it with the Duke, but not because of what you thought.\u201d she continued to say, unable to look at him in the eyes.Kyle could faintly feel his heart breaking apart, mistaking her avoidance to look at him because of shame at loving the Duke. At that point, Matthias moved forward, ready to pull Leyla away from Kyle\u2019s grasp when the battered man shot him a glare.He could see the smug look on the Duke\u2019s face, and it made Kyle\u2019s blood boil, but he tampered it down, because he didn\u2019t want to cause any more trouble for Leyla. Which brings him to another concern about their affair\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re already engaged.\u201d Kyle hissed lowly through his cut lips, glaring at the Duke with his remaining good eye. \u201cTo Lady Brandt, I might add.\u201d Matthias only shrugged as if that fact held no meaning for him.Even despite the blooming bruise on his cheek, Matthias held himself up high and composed. One would almost think he was just a passerby in the recent fight that ensued moments prior. How could he remain so nonchalant?!Wasting no more moment, Matthias scooped Leyla into his arms, pulling her away from Kyle. He made sure Kyle was watching as he pulled out a handkerchief and successfully wiped away the tears in Leyla\u2019s face, trailing kisses over the tear streaks and gently ran his fingers through her hair\u2026He locked eyes with Kyle\u2019s broken form as he pulled Leyla into a soft kiss.And just like a final nail to the coffin, Kyle\u2019s heart shattered at the sight of them kissing each other so easily in front of him. He watched as the Duke\u2019s eyes finally closed, and Leyla sank further into his chest\u2026\u2018How could this happen?!\u2019\u00a0Kyle thought, salty tears now flowing down his cheeks, stinging the cuts on his face and lips but he welcomed that pain anyway. It was like he was on the brink of insanity, but at the same time, all the pieces clicked into place.He watched as Matthias pulled away from their kiss, and casually unbuttoned Leyla\u2019s blouse, to button them up properly and fix her clothes.\u2018How long have they been doing this?\u2019\u201cTheir relationship blossomed right after you left for the capital, Kyle, did you know?\u201d Claudine\u2019s mocking voice echoed faintly in the back of his mind\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll come back as soon as our uninvited guest leaves you.\u201d Matthias announced softly, and Leyla nodded tersely at him, refusing to make eye contact as fresh tears flowed down her face. Matthias planted one last kiss on her lips gently, before swiftly taking his leave after giving a slight nod to Kyle.Kyle didn\u2019t know how long he sat limply on Leyla\u2019s cabin floor, the air around them having stilled in place and the silence deafening him. He completely missed the genuine concern Leyla gave him, along with the fear she had just shown.The next thing he had managed to register was Leyla\u2019s hands reaching out to him, and the muffled question of how he was feeling before all his hurt and anger welled up in him.\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d he hissed slowly, making Leyla\u2019s hands stop right in front of him. He didn\u2019t want to look at her, he didn\u2019t want to see the hurt in her eyes when he had so much hurt inside him too!So he looked down resolutely on the ground, body brimming with pain and resentment over both her and the Duke.Leyla looked at Kyle\u2019s face in shock, another set of tears welling up in her at the sound of his voice. He\u2019d never spoken so coldly to her before, and it made her freeze.Kyle didn\u2019t want to stay around Leyla any longer, so despite his limbs screaming at him for rest, he staggered up to his feet, almost tumbling over as the adrenal fatigue came crashing onto him, making him feel every pain in his body tenfold.\u201cOf all the people I expected this from, not once did I think you could do this.\u201d Kyle whispered, the betrayal seeping out of his voice, \u201cHow could you do such a thing, Leyla?\u201d\u201cKyle, I\u2019m so sorry, I-\u201d\u201cIs this why you discarded me so coldly?\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but ask, forcing his shaking fists to stay on his side, afraid to lash out on Leyla despite the hurt she\u2019d just given him, \u201cTo be his mistress? Is this the life you wanted all along?\u201d He heaved a sob, failing to keep the tears from spilling once more from his eyes\u2026He wanted her to deny his accusations, to yell, get mad at him for believing such a blatant lie! But she didn\u2019t, she only stood there, looking so dejected.\u201cI really am sorry.\u201d She squeaked out softly, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you like this Kyle.\u201dWhat good was her sorry? It only served as an insult for Kyle. He wanted to lash out, scream and yell until everyone nearby would hear his despair\u2026But he had more questions.He glanced around the darkened cabin, remembering every single moment he had passed through the threshold. This was his second home. He felt like he belonged here, once upon a time. He had many good core memories here, like when he and Leyla were children, sitting on the chairs with their legs swinging back and forth as they excitedly chatted with one another.If the table could make them see its memories, it would have reminded him of all the secrets they shared, the jokes and laughter they had, and the dreams they made with one another.Unfortunately, it would also remind him of the way Leyla had been in the arms of a man, engaged to wed another.\u201cSince when did this whole thing begin between you?\u201d Kyle asked softly, eyes still trailed on the table. \u201cWere you just waiting for me to disappear all this time?\u201d He could hear Leyla\u2019s soft denials amongst her sobs.\u201cSo I just\u00a0unfortunately\u00a0stumbled upon you, is that it?\u201d Kyle asked, finally looking at Leyla. She looked so ashamed as she shook her head, implying this wasn\u2019t the first time either, but it wasn\u2019t because he was gone. It made Kyle feel ashamed for being so antagonizing with her, but he needed to push through.He also noticed how thin Leyla had gotten. She was fuller before, healthier too. And it reminded him why he needed to keep questioning Leyla. For her own good.\u201cLeyla, can\u2019t you stop being with him?\u201d he pleaded softly, heart softening up before he brushed off her tears once more, \u201cYou know he\u2019s getting married, who\u00a0he\u2019ll be married to.\u201d He warned her in a whisper. \u201cI know you know the consequences, surely you don\u2019t want that!\u201dBecause he still remembers how much she shined when she\u2019d tell him about her dreams for the future. Her enthusiasm infected him deeply as she described how she\u2019ll be in a few years or so. She wanted nothing more than researching birds, and traveling to distant places to see them!Staying with the Duke would only root Leyla in place. She won\u2019t be able to live as freely as she does now, not when the news of their affair would come out.\u201cYou\u2019d have to give up everything just to stay with him, Leyla,\u201d Kyle added softly forcing her to look him in the eyes, gently cupping her face in an angle that would let her, \u201cDo you understand Leyla? You could lose yourself to him.\u201dMemories of Leyla\u2019s wistful expression when they discussed their marriage, confiding in him how many children she wanted, the type of house they would live in. That much wasn\u2019t fake. Leyla loved him before.All he wanted was for her to love him again. To\u00a0choose\u00a0him again.\u2018Please,\u2019\u00a0Kyle pleaded in his mind,\u00a0\u2018See me Leyla, choose me.\u2019\u201cI know.\u201d Leyla finally answered back softly as she gazed at him with pitying eyes, \u201cAnd I am willing to stay with him despite that.\u201d\u201cLeyla-\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kyle.\u201d Leyla swallowed down the desire to wrap him in a warm embrace. Instead, she put her hands on his shaky ones, and softly pulled away from him, before stepping back.\u201cYou must leave now.\u201d she softly demanded of him. Kyle searched her eyes for any lie, but there was only stubbornness reflected in them.After a while, Kyle nodded in compliance at her, before staggering outside of the cabin. As soon as he got outside, Leyla closed the door shut behind him.With only the moon as their witness, two broken hearts cried for a great love that had finally run its final course, never to be together again.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Claudine had caught a glimpse of Kyle hurriedly exiting Arvis estate, but there was still no sight of Matthias.She had been informed moments before dinner that her fiance had expressed his wishes to dine separately for the day, and would be staying in the annex. It wasn\u2019t uncommon of him to do so, he\u2019d done it several times before. Yet, Claudine couldn\u2019t help but wait for any sign of him curiously as she watched the still garden outside.He had given them the excuse of work pulling him away, but Claudine was no fool. She had a feeling what he\u2019d been up to in the annex.\u2018I wonder if the three of them had their own confrontation yet,\u2019\u00a0Claudine wondered idly to herself as she stood in front of her window,\u00a0\u2018But if that was true, then why haven\u2019t I seen Matthias surface yet? Kyle\u2019s already left.\u2019Claudine had always been much too curious for her own good. It was an unfortunate flaw in her she tried to curb, but she must know what happened so far. Immediately she turned to grab her coat, securing it around her before venturing out of her room.In no time at all, she found herself walking through the forest alone, and giggled to herself at how ridiculous she currently looked like. This was unlike her, but the things she must do to quench her thirst for knowledge had her doing many things others would deem ridiculous.And right now, her point of interest was Matthias and Leyla\u2019s relationship progress. That and her Brandt pride couldn\u2019t just let their affair off the hook despite their less than desirable reasons.The forest was different in the light of the moon. In the morning it seemed so full of life and bounty for them, but in the night, there was a gloomy feel in the air. Claudine picked up her pace, nimbly stepping around any roughness on the ground, while white puffs of air escaped her.Soon, she had reached the riverside. She paused for a while, feeling relief fill her lungs. She looked up at the annex, and saw a lone light coming from it. It made her frown, wondering if perhaps Kyle had missed seeing them, and had gone to Leyla\u2019s instead.\u2018He must have brought Leyla here, then.\u2019\u00a0She hummed to herself.\u00a0\u2018Though I was so certain he\u2019d gone to Leyla instead.\u2019Deeming her curiosity satiated momentarily, she decided it was time for her to return, when suddenly the light went out in the annex. Interest piqued, Claudine felt a rush of thrill shot through her as she quickly hid behind one of the willow trees.She waited for a while, wondering why the light went out, when soon enough, a lone figure emerged from the annex\u2019 entrance.It was none other than her fiance, Matthias von Herhardt.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*When Kyle had finally left, Leyla immediately got to cleaning up the mess in the kitchen, scrubbing blood stains off her floor. She wasn\u2019t really thinking about anything in particular, her mind kept rewinding the horrific events just moments earlier as her hands moved robotically.Once that was done, she soon found herself curled up on the bed, staring off into space. She left the door unlocked, not wanting to have to rise up to greet the cruel man when he\u2019d return.And return he did after her silent torment. He\u2019d knocked to let her know he was back, but she made no sound in acknowledgement, the fight in her having long been extinguished along with Kyle\u2019s trust in her.Besides, if she left him locked out, it would only provoke him to do more terrible things towards her.He gave another knock, but when even that was left unanswered, he turned the knob open, and let himself in. The floorboards creaked beneath his weight as he took slow, gentle steps towards where her room would be.With click on the soles of his leather shoes growing closer, the higher the indignation in Leyla\u2019s chest rose.A third knock came as soon as he came upon her door, and Leyla couldn\u2019t help but chuckle mirthlessly to herself.\u2018Always so dignified.\u2019\u00a0She mocked him in her mind.\u00a0\u2018Even when it comes to ruining a whole person\u2019s life.\u2019\u00a0she finished bitterly in thought.And then the door creaked open, the chill filling the room before Matthias finally crossed into the space of her solitude. Leyla spared him an icy glare, but Matthias remained indifferent, still dressed in the clothes he wore before, with splatters of blood on the corners of his collar.She hated thinking it had come from Kyle, but the blooming bruise by the corner of her lips gave her a sadistic satisfaction.Matthias stopped right in front of her fetal position, looking down at her with an amused expression on his face.\u201cI trust you both reached a pleasant closure, then?\u201d he inquired, the fists Leyla hugged close to her chest tightened at remembering Kyle\u2019s broken look when she denied him for the last time.\u201cYou really are a monster.\u201d Leyla hissed through her gritted teeth. Matthias blinked at her in surprise\u2026\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow could you do that to him?\u201d She demanded from him, \u201cHow could you hurt Kyle like that!?\u201d Matthias scoffed at her.\u201cIt was his own doing.\u201d He reasoned out, \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t come seeking you out so late in the night, then I wouldn\u2019t have had to hurt him.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re wrong!\u201d Leyla exclaimed, shooting up from her bed as she rose to meet his eyes with a glare, \u201cYou\u2019re the reason why he had to seek me out! You\u2019re the reason for this whole mess I\u2019m in!\u201dLeyla\u2019s eyes glinted in the moonlight as she tamped down the tears starting to form, refusing to let him see her cry. A while ago it had been different. Her tears had been for Kyle, and she didn\u2019t even think about Matthias.But even with her harsh words, Matthias kept looking at her in wonder, stepping closer and shamelessly began to pet her on the head like he would an obedient dog. Leyla flinched when she felt his touch on her.\u201cSay it again,\u201d he whispered, drawing closer to her, before cupping her cheeks to pull her closer to him, \u201cLeyla, say it again for me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Leyla asked in confusion, \u201cSay what again?\u201d\u201cSay what you said to Kyle again,\u201d Matthias ordered her softly, \u201cSay you love me again.\u201dLeyla stood there in confusion for a moment, before all the anger and resentment in her faded, leaving only a blank face for Matthias to see. She then sighed out in disbelief before turning her face away from him, when he gripped her tightly to keep her eyes firmly on him.\u201cDon\u2019t delude yourself Duke,\u201d Leyla huffed out angrily as she met his gaze, \u201cThat had been a lie for Kyle\u2019s sake.\u201d\u201cThen lie to me again,\u201d Matthias grinned, \u201cI want to hear it again.\u201d\u201cWhat for?\u201d Leyla scoffed, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for me to repeat such a horrible lie in your presence.\u201d\u201cIs it really so terrible Leyla?\u201d\u201cYes it\u2019s terrible!\u201d Leyla shrieked angrily, roughly slapping his hand away from her in indignation. \u201cDon\u2019t you see the gravity of the mess you caused tonight!? I had to hurt Kyle because of you!\u201dMatthias stood there in front of her, unresponsive, before something in his eyes turned dark. He lowered his gaze, until the shadows hid them from Leyla\u2019s view. She watched him with bated breath, ready for whatever retaliation he had in store for her.Suddenly, Matthias began to chuckle. It had been soft and slow at first, sending chills down her spine before she watched him throw his head back and clutched his stomach in a full-blown laughter.When he looked back at her, that manic glint was back in his eyes.\u201cOh! What a wonderful relationship you both have to be able to endure such tragedy for me!\u201d He wiped the tears from the corner of his eyes before looking back at Leyla with a toothy grin, \u201cEven I can\u2019t help but tear up at the thought!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re despicable!\u201d Leyla exclaimed, before squealing in fear when Matthias pulled her harshly towards him by the arm. But she bounced back quickly, having gotten used to his rough treatment of her. \u201cDon\u2019t mock Kyle!\u201d she scolded him\u2026And suddenly Matthias\u2019 stare got colder.\u2018Kyle,\u2019\u00a0Matthias thought bitterly,\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s always Kyle this\u2026 Kyle that\u2026 I\u2019m so sick. Of. Kyle.\u2019Even the way she tried to throw herself in the middle of the fight to pull him off the man grated at his nerves!\u201cSo that lie was for Kyle\u2019s sake?\u201d he asked her calmly, but the menace in his tone was unmistakable.\u201cFor Kyle\u2019s sake, I\u2019d do anything.\u201d Leyla admitted freely in front of him. Matthias chuckled in a low tone, pulling Leyla\u2019s body to his.\u201cYou gave up your body for old Mr. Remmer\u2019s sake,\u201d Matthias purred, dipping his head low to be at eye level with her, \u201cAnd you just gave up your heart for young Mr. Etman\u2019s safety from me.\u201dHe stopped right next to Leyla\u2019s ear, his warmth breath sending shivers down her body in an uncomfortable way.\u201cMy, what a martyr you are becoming Leyla.\u201d\u201cIf a martyr is what I should become to keep Uncle Bill and Kyle safe from the likes of you, then I\u2019ll gladly be one!\u201d\u201cI love him!\u201d Leyla\u2019s earlier declaration rang clearly in the back of her mind.She wanted to take it back as soon as the words left her mouth, but she hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d done plenty of horrible things for her uncle\u2019s sake, but the lie had hit her harder than she thought. It was like she had been forced to drive a stake into her own heart, and just kept twisting, making herself bleed more than she should.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you wishing for a martyr for yourself?\u201d Leyla asked him mockingly. She might as well give him more of his own medicine back. After all, he\u2019d been\u00a0oh so generous\u00a0with her!\u201cHave you eaten dinner yet?\u201d Matthias hummed in wonder, quickly changing the subject, and therefore confusing Leyla. \u201cYou should eat first, you\u2019ll need your strength for our time together soon.\u201d\u201cHow could you remain so callous about these things!?\u201d she screamed at him, unable to reconcile him with such gentle and kind words of concern when she knew him to be anything but.\u201cI just watched myself destroy Kyle\u2019s image of me! Do you get that in your rich and snobbish brain!?\u201d she asked him, \u201cI lied about my feelings for you so that he wouldn\u2019t end up dead! And you think I\u2019d still have the stomach to dine with you?!\u201d\u201cLeyla Lewellin.\u201d He called her out sharply, to get her to remain quiet, but Leyla was no longer listening to him with one of her worst fears having just been realized.Matthias was stronger than her, sure, but she had the element of surprise, and surprise he was when he found himself being pushed abruptly onto Leyla\u2019s bed. He was further astonished, and equally aroused when she hiked her legs on both of his sides, effectively straddling him.\u201cLet\u2019s just do it already.\u201d Leyla sighed out tiredly, nimble fingers popping off the buttons of her blouse, revealing more and more of her torso to Matthias\u2019 greedy and lustful gaze.\u201cI love him!\u201dShe wanted nothing more than to erase that moment in her mind, and losing herself in the sex between them was looking more and more appealing by the second.\u201cCome on, aren\u2019t you in a hurry to be inside me?\u201d Leyla challenged, bracing her arms on either side of his head after tossing her blouse onto the floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She kept eye contact with him, noticing the way his breath hitched when she lightly grazed his collarbone with her fingers, as she splayed her petite hands on his chest.Matthias watched in a mesmerized way, feeling his pants get tighter with each passing second.Leyla dutifully proceeded to take charge, wanting nothing more than to drown herself numb of tonight\u2019s events. She wanted to feel the hurt physically, and not just in her heart. She was practically throwing herself at him, begging for him to take charge just this once because she wanted it tonight\u2026She wanted his roughness.Finally, Matthias snapped out of his daze, and pulled Leyla to him, making her sprawl on top. Leyla gasped when their bare chest made contact, Matthias\u2019 warmth filling her up quickly, and she welcomed the growing heat pooling in her.She surrendered complete control over to him, and Matthias was all too eager to please.He quickly flipped them over, Leyla now lied beneath him as his hands inched down her sides, grabbing the hem of her skirt and began bunching it up to her waist, revealing her bare legs, underwear long discarded before Kyle even arrived.She was glistening underneath, and he could feel his mouth water.Leyla sighed out erotically as he planted soft, yet heated kisses on her inner thigh, her slender fingers grasping onto the tip of his head, lightly pulling at them, making him groan. Matthias held her lust-filled eyes, before diving into her wetness, tasting every inch of her.Leyla\u2019s back arched, gasping quietly in complete ecstasy, legs widening to accommodate him more. His fingers dug deeply into her thighs, her toes curling at the pleasure wracking her body until she felt herself go taut as she reached a sweet release\u2026Yet she needed more.Matthias rose from between her legs, lips wet because of her, to climb over her body. She heard the telltale signs of him unbuckling his pants which soon joined the rest of their discarded clothes on the floor, legs quivering in anticipation for the main event.He rubbed the blunt tip of his member against her entrance, and Leyla bit her lips in impatience. Matthias grinned at her.\u201cLet me hear you Leyla,\u201d he enticed, flicking her sensitive nub, \u201cI want to hear you scream because of me tonight.\u201dAnd in one swift movement, he buried himself up to the hilt deep within her, making Leyla cry out at the sudden intrusion. A hand fisted on the sheets of her bed as she pushed her chest up, lost in the sensation, while the other firmly clamped on her mouth to silence herself.But Matthias swiftly grabbed her arm, pinning it beside her face, and began to thrust in her. She writhed against him, hips rolling in tandem with his thrusts, but eyes completely unseeing as she stared up at him\u2026\u201cKyle\u2026 Kyle\u2026\u201d she gasped out, tears leaking out of her, which only served as a blow to Matthias\u2019 pride.\u201cI love him!\u201d\u201cKyle\u2026\u201d\u201cI love him!\u201d\u201cKyle!\u201d she cried out, and Matthias only picked up his pace, wanting to erase him from Leyla\u2019s mind.\u201cI love him!\u201dThere was a mix of resentment, anger and shame welling up in Matthias as she kept crying out for her past fiance. Her words were insulting at best, but that\u00a0horrible\u00a0lie she told in the night still rang so loudly in his mind, it drowned out the other man\u2019s name.He dipped his head, quickly devouring her lips into his own, as he shoved his tongue down her throat. Leyla moaned against his lips, their tongues battling for dominance as the sounds of flesh sloppily slapping against each other replaced their breathy moans.Leyla\u2019s eyes fluttered shut, mind completely overridden by the pleasure she submitted herself into, moaning relentlessly with every ministrations, spurring Matthias to hit her deeper as she clamped down around him.\u201cLeyla,\u201d he growled, when she still sighed out another man\u2019s name, \u201cWhen are you going to stop holding onto him?\u201dLeyla\u2019s breath shuttered, as her eyes kept shut, but the tension in her body made him aware she was returning to her senses.\u201cOpen your eyes and look at me Leyla.\u201d He commanded. His fingers dug into her waist from where he gripped her steady. Leyla cried out, stubbornly squeezing her eyes shut, but he only tightened his grip more, until finally, she revealed those emerald jewels to him as she glared hatefully at him.Seeing her finally look at him gave him a deep sense of satisfaction, hands moving away from her hips, to thumb her on the sensitive nub of hers. Leyla\u2019s eyes widened, head thrown back at the new simulation down below.Her legs quivered and writhed as he continued his thrusts, while simultaneously swirling his thumb on her nub.She was his woman. She wasn\u2019t allowed to think of anyone else. If she had time to think about anyone else while he\u2019s inside her, then he\u2019ll just have to give her more than she was used to.\u201cFine, be like that then.\u201d Matthias growled when Leyla resumed covering her face away from him.Suddenly, his thrusts stopped. Leyla gave out a whine when he pulled out with a wet squelch, and felt his hands grabbing her by the waist. She had a feeling what he wanted her to do now. It was one of his favorites.And then Leyla found herself on her stomach, her lower body knelt on the bed, her backside raised in ample position for him to enter, while he pushed her shoulders down on the bed, her forearms bracing herself to ease the discomfort.He draped himself all over her back, lightly rutting his member between the crevice of her backside as he planted more kisses on the nape of her neck, suckling the skin there to leave a mark\u2026Leyla\u2019s hands gripped on the sheets in front of her, body shuddering when he left wet, sloppy kisses on her spine.The bed creaked, and the sounds of their coupling resumed as Matthias buried himself deeper than before in their new position.Leyla moaned, hips thrusting back to meet him once more, her body having a mind of its own as they both chased their own pleasure.Matthias could feel the way she was coating him with her juices. He grabbed her by the hair, lightly pulling her towards him in a way that heightened the pleasure in Leyla as he buried two fingers along inside her, rubbing her sensitive nub once more.At that moment, thoughts of her telling she loved Kyle was gone, replaced only by her desire for her relationship with Matthias to remain strictly physical.Suddenly, Matthias stopped and pulled out with a groan, hand gripped tight on his member, before he began pumping himself, his blunt head rubbing against Leyla\u2019s crevice, fingers firmly buried to his knuckles as he pistoned them in and out of her.Leyla reached her climax in no time, coming with a keen sound escaping her lips. Moments later, she felt hot spurts being sprayed all over her backside when Matthias had also reached his own release.Matthias watched as he painted himself all over her with white, licking his lips in appreciation as her sheets got soaked by their bodily fluids. He gently grabbed her by the shoulders, pulling her back flush against his chest.He licked the sweat off the side of her neck, sniffing in her scent before stopping right beside her ear.\u201cHate me all you want Leyla,\u201d he whispered in her ear, hand grasping her chin to make her look at him, \u201cBut you can\u2019t deny that you\u2019re still mine.\u201d And with that, he pulled her to a kiss, getting ready for another round with his mistress\u2026With his Leyla.Leyla\u2026\u2026My Leyla\u2026..*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*It took Claudine some time to catch up with Matthias. She\u2019d taken her sweet time, not wanting to get too close to him in case he noticed her following.As she expected, he led her straight towards the cabin she knew to be where Leyla lived with her uncle. She pondered moments in front of the cabin, her figure still hidden amongst the trees until she pushed forward, curiosity spurring her to move.Still, the disappointment in her at how similar Matthias ended up being with other men who took women on the side despite their marriage couldn\u2019t be helped. And to think she used to think so highly of him too!She didn\u2019t know why she was curious, but she noticed the door being left ajar, and strode in quietly in confidence, assessing the shabbiness of the cabin around them. As expected, the house was mostly dark, the lone lamp was the only source of light in the house she could see.She waited for a few more moments, letting her eyes adjust in the darkness, when the growing sounds from one of the bedrooms caught her attention. The more she stepped closer to the sounds, the more she could make out the unmistakable sound of a woman\u2019s soft moan, paired with the grunting of a man.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias let out a satisfied sigh, plopping right next to Leyla\u2019s limp form on her bed as they both heaved their breaths after another satisfactory round. Silence reigned between them, with Matthias staring up at the wall in contentment, and Leyla resolutely looking at the wall beside her, trying to make herself as small as possible.He looked over at Leyla\u2019s sweaty back, locks of her hair plastered behind her, and casually ran his fingers up her spine. She shuddered beneath his touch, yet refused to look at him. Matthias couldn\u2019t help but smile despondently to himself.He\u2019d never felt such a rush of emotions before. It confused him greatly, driving himself mad as to why it had to be Leyla, but it was. Only she could invoke such confusing emotions in him, and yet she kept pulling away from him just when he thought they made great progress in their relationship.The light in her room basked them both in a soft orange glow, and Matthias reached out for her once more, urging her to turn back to him. He heard her sigh upon his touch, before she finally turned back to him.He cupped her cheeks immediately, and began wiping the sweat off her face with gentle hands, seeing the way her eyes were firmly shut, her breathing hitching with every caress.Leyla wanted to push him away from her, but she was tired of fighting tonight. Her heart was still reeling with pain in her heart, but mostly numbed by her body\u2019s own pain from straining herself in their intercourse. She can\u2019t even open her eyes to look at him.She was just so exhausted.The longer the silence between them stayed, the more relaxed Matthias felt in her room. Once he was certain she was half-asleep, he pulled her into her arms, tucking her head onto the crook of his neck, and planting soft kisses on her forehead.Leyla faintly thanked whichever deity was watching over that there would be no more rounds tonight, for she was already spent.Matthias kept planting kisses all over her face. On her cheeks, the tip of her nose, behind her closed eyelids, and back on her forehead. He was so drunk in endorphins, he couldn\u2019t find it in himself to stop these soft affections he gave her.Leyla\u2019s brows frowned, flinching her face away every now and then, her cute button nose wrinkling when he\u2019d smoothen it out with another kiss again.\u201cStop it.\u201d she grumbled drowsily, with her eyes still closed.\u201cSay it again, Leyla\u2026\u201d He requested once more..\u201cHuh?\u201d Leyla groggily asked, burying her face into his chest, muffling her voice.\u201cSay that you love me again.\u201d He reiterated, \u201cIf you say that, I swear to give you everything you want.\u201dLeyla laughed mirthlessly at his false words. Despite how heavy her eyes felt, she mustered up the strength to look him in the eyes.And just like that, the pain in her body diminished, and the one in her heart blooming in an unstoppable force once more.Leyla brought a hand up to cover her eyes, rolling off of his chest as she lay on her back beside him, and proceeded to laugh at what a mess her life had gotten to be! She kept chuckling in that sad manner, until tears began leaking out her eyes\u2026\u201cShh, don\u2019t cry, Leyla,\u201d Matthias cooed, softly pulling her arm away from her eyes to dab then gently with a cloth. He proceeded to plant more kisses on her eyelids, to which she finally looked him in the eye, the laughter finally dying down\u2026\u201cThis is so weird.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but point out as she stared into his eyes. They almost looked\u2026\u2018Regretful\u2026\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought before shaking it away. He wasn\u2019t one who knew the meaning of that word. For that word to even have meaning, one had to possess a warm heart, but Matthias\u2019 heart was stone cold.\u201cWhat\u2019s so weird?\u201d Matthias asked softly.\u201cYou.\u201d She sighed out, staring up at the ceiling blankly, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten weird lately.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause you keep acting like this.\u201d\u201cLike how?\u201d\u201cLike you\u2019re so concerned about me.\u201d Leyla sighed out, looking back at him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you liked seeing me cry?\u201dMatthias hummed, eyes still focused on her tears, but feeling no satisfaction at the sight of it. He then looked back at Leyla in the eye, propping himself up with one hand to wipe her tears away better.\u201cJust don\u2019t cry Leyla,\u201d he murmured, giving her an encouraging smile, \u201cSmile for me instead.\u201dLeyla raised a brow at him.\u201cDo you want me to smile for you now?\u201d\u201cPerhaps.\u201dA few beats of silence, before Leyla\u2019s face turned blank, still crying as she met his gaze.\u201cThen I guess you would never see me smile again.\u201d She softly declared, face scrunching up as she finally sobbed her heart out in front of him. Matthias watched her in shocked silence, before he laughed to himself at her stubbornness\u2026Strangely, his heart began to feel hollow.Leyla cried for the innocence she lost. She cried for her freedom being taken away. She cried for being involved with such a cruel man. She cried for having to hurt the people she loved in the world.He was like a barbed wire, wrapped around her. The longer she struggled against him, the more she was only harming herself.She was so, so tired of it all, and couldn\u2019t help but sink into his warmth because it was all she could have. But most of all, she was crying because the cruel man she got involved with, was the first one to give her such warmth before\u2026\u2018I\u2019m so disgusting!\u2019\u00a0Leyla screamed in her mind as she huddled closer to him, seeking out the comfort only he could give her,\u00a0\u2018How can you make me feel like this!?\u2019\u00a0She wanted to ask him, but bit her lips to stop the question from spilling out.\u201cOne day, I will see you cry,\u201d Leyla told him, the crying finally coming to a stop once she calmed down, \u201cOne day, I will give you a taste of your own medicine.\u201dShe promised him. Matthias only chuckled at her.\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d He whispered, before kissing her on the lips.Matthias used to think he was the one holding all the cards in their relationship. But maybe that wasn\u2019t always true. Maybe, the cards had always been with Leyla, she just didn\u2019t realize it.Soon Leyla\u2019s vision turned dark, the dreamscapes finally claiming her from her current reality. The next time she opened her eyes, dawn was breaking out of the sky.She thought she was going to be alone, yet to her surprise, Matthias was still beside her, sitting up on her bed, leaning against her head board, and looking down at her with a contemplative look in his eyes.Regaining her strength from her night\u2019s rest, she shot him a glare.\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d She asked him, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you leave by now?\u201dMatthias nodded at her, giving her no verbal answer before he just stood up, having long been dressed. He was only waiting for her to wake up.Leyla watched him through lidded eyes, settling snuggly back into her bed. She watched as Matthias grabbed his discarded coat, putting it on, and turned back to look at her. Feeling conscious, she sat up and pulled the blanket around her, all the way up to her shoulders.She waited for him to say something, not knowing Matthias was expecting the same from her too. The sun gently rose as they stayed in their positions, doing nothing but watch the other.Sunlight crept into the windows, slowly revealing the vibrant colors of the world around them, signaling the both of them that it was time to say goodbye. She watched the vibrant blue in his eyes, reflecting the awakening blue skies outside.Yet during the night, they reflected back dark pools like the night sky, echoing the deep sadness and hurt inside her.Matthias walked towards her, dipping down to plant a kiss on her cheeks, before straightening up once more. He swiftly turned on his heels, and walked out in no particular hurry.Leyla listened to his fading footsteps, until only silence remained with her.Just her, and her tumultuous thoughts.She clutched her nearby pillow to her chest, pulling it flush against her torso, before she plopped limply back onto the bed, curling into a fetal position. She burrowed into the pillow, trying to suffocate the sadness out of her to no avail, sending her off to another round of a listless sleep.On and on it went during the rest of her morning.Her eyes would flutter open to see morning light, before shutting back into darkness.Open\u2026 close\u2026 open\u2026 close\u2026open\u2026 close\u2026 open\u2026She awoke for the final time that morning, breathing out a resigned sigh before sitting up. She stretched her arms overhead, feeling her bones crack as she loosened up the kinks in her muscles from last night\u2019s strenuous activity.Sluggishly, she went to a bath, sinking into the warm water as she scrubbed away the traces he left on her body until the water remained clear. Once the water was drained, she remained in the tub, burying her face into her knees, hugging them close to her chest.She breathed in the steam wafting all over her, wrapping her in fading warmth. Once the heat had all but disappeared, she finally moved out of her daze, intent to finally get dressed when a firm knocking echoed into her almost empty house, followed by a familiar voice, bellowing out her name.It made Leyla freeze in place.\u201cMiss Lewellin!\u201dIt was Mary, Claudine\u2019s maid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayClaudine found herself strolling along the rose garden. Their thin vines arched overhead on the pergola they walked under through, allowing the morning sun to seep through the gaps, but enough to make them remain in the shaded area.She stopped for a moment, glancing around with a pleasant smile on the garden, before she finally turned to her companion.\u201cAh, don\u2019t you think the weather today is nice? Seems like spring really is arriving any day now! Don\u2019t you think so too, Leyla?\u201d She inquired, trying to engage the other woman in light conversation.Leyla stood away from her, a few paces behind, and her head bowed pitifully as a stiff smile was held on her lips. She remained silent. Claudine tilted her head, raising a brow over to the girl.\u201cLeyla?\u201d She prompted once more, and Leyla finally let out a grimace of a smile.She was very pale as she stood in front of the Duke\u2019s fiance, and her damp hair was tied haphazardly behind her, as she was prompted to come quickly in front of Lady Brandt. She barely had time to pick out some proper clothes.She couldn\u2019t help shivering at the droplets that drizzled down her hair and landed on her back.\u201cI- I agree as well, my Lady.\u201d She answered softly. Claudine shot her a satisfied smile, before turning her attention back to the rose garden.Leyla was acting just as she expected. Then again, Claudine also firmly believed if the Duke were to ever have just one mistress, it would always, and remained to be, one Leyla Lewellin.Mistresses in the aristocratic class were not unheard of. In fact, having one was hardly special. But while the Lords would parade their mistresses like trophies on their arm, a mistress was a direct blow to a Lady\u2019s worth.She\u2019s seen and heard of the many Lords who fell for the less desirable sorts. People like their own maids, or prostitutes. They all ended up being humiliated in front of society, especially when their husbands proceeded to make a fool of themselves for everyone to bore witness to.That\u2019s why, as far as wives and fiances were concerned, having a mistress of high stature in society was far better.So perhaps Leyla wasn\u2019t too much of a bad choice. She knew many wives who wished their husband\u2019s mistresses knew their place to not act above a wife, and someone who wasn\u2019t crude or vulgar. Leyla fit that criteria.Additionally, she was considered to be intelligent among her peers, and beautiful. Despite her lower stature, she\u2019s garnered a reputable life. People would think her, Claudine, a fool to ever complain about her fiance having such a mistress.But as she thought earlier, all those qualities would be attributed as a praise for the Duke . Rumours about the Duke\u2019s affair couldn\u2019t be stopped, Claudine knew. And society will praise him for having found such a one-of-a-kind mistress! And where would that leave Claudine?She\u2019d be shamed twice. One for being an insufficient wife, and two, for the Duke\u2019s mistress to be of lesser stature than her.Claudine approached a nearby bench, flapping her handkerchief over a spot with a flick of her wrists before sitting down. The rose garden was in a transition between winter to spring season. She could spot the light dew glinting with sunlight and the lessened thickness of the snow around the ground.A gentle breeze went past them, brushing lightly up against her rosy cheeks, billowing some locks of her hair and ribbons on her hat, behind her gently.Events of last night came back to her, remembering the way she stood right outside the door as she listened to their love making. It was unmistakably Matthias. She would recognize his voice everywhere, but the words did not hear his profile.Those gentle words, they did not seem as though they belonged to be said by such a foul man. If she were an idiot, she would have burst through the doors just to really see it for herself that\u00a0he\u00a0was the one saying them, and not someone else who just sounded like him!But alas\u2026\u2018Should I have done that instead?\u2019\u00a0Claudine mused to herself. It would probably have quieted the incessant disbelief she had in the back of her mind ever since she listened to them.Ever since she returned to the mansion last night, Claudine had kept pacing in front of the window, which brought her a massive view of the forest path. She would have no trouble tracking Matthias\u2019 return at that spot in the mansion.So troubled, she hardly felt the need to sleep. And she was rewarded soon when Matthias returned at the crack of dawn.She watched as he went up the stairs looking a little worse for wear, before he abruptly stopped in his steps, and looked back from where he\u2019d come from. Almost like he was expecting for something to follow.He stood there longer than just a moment, before finally continuing on his path, a sullen look on his face. Claudine had reached her decision by then.She must act now. She didn\u2019t have any more luxury to wait.Matthias was becoming less and less of the Matthias she grew up around in her youth. He was getting harder to predict, and the same could be said about Leyla. Last night\u2019s events bore witness to that.She never expected Leyla to be writhing wantonly in the arms of her tormentor as though Kyle hadn\u2019t just witnessed them moments before. She was getting bolder, and Claudine didn\u2019t like that.She finally spared her companion another glance. Leyla flinched when Claudine\u2019s eyes went back to her.\u201cWhy do you appear so nervous?\u201d Claudine asked, taking off her gloves and holding them daintily in one hand, \u201cPeople might begin to think I\u2019m bothering you, if you act like that Leyla.\u201d She smiled at her prettily, \u201cAren\u2019t we just taking a walk together as friends?\u201dLeyla flinched as Claudine practically called her out.\u201cO-of course we are, m-my Lady.\u201d She stuttered, resolutely standing away from her, turning pale in complexion.\u201cAh well, that eases my troubles then.\u201d Claudine hummed, shrugging her shoulders before adjusting her hat with ungloved hands.Leyla couldn\u2019t help but recall earlier events with Lady Brandt\u2019s maid.Mary had been insistent they needed to leave right away, barely giving Leyla enough time to get dressed and dry herself into a presentable manner. Even before Leyla had come to open the door, she kept calling and yelling for her name\u2026A repeated demand for her to hurry up and answer the door.As soon as Leyla swung the door open, she was met with a cold and calculating gaze from Mary.\u201cI have been given a request to invite you over for a morning stroll Miss Lewellin.\u201d She immediately said. But despite her polite words, her tone implied Leyla had no room to refuse her mistress\u2019 orders.And that there was no further time for delay.Hence Leyla\u2019s less than presentable state of dress. Even her hair was a mess! As soon as they arrived, Leyla felt fear grip her heart at the sight of Matthias\u2019 fiance waiting for her\u00a0 by the garden trail, smiling so amicably as though she was another one of her friends.The two women remained in the garden in pregnant silence. The tension between them remained so thick, you could have cut it with a knife, even as Claudine sat down on the bench, and Leyla remained standing a few paces away beside her.CLANG!The sound of a bracelet hitting the stone floor broke the silence around them, as both looked down and saw the way the bracelet rolled on the floor, before wobbling to a stop. It was Claudine\u2019s platinum bracelet, glinting on the stone floor as the sun\u2019s rays hit it beautifully.Claudine frowned as she felt her wrist grow light before hearing it fall. It seemed as though the clasp had gotten loose and broken through the many times she wore it.\u201cOh my, can you help me Leyla?\u201d She called out softly, and Leyla blinked, unmoving.\u201cY-yes, my Lady?\u201dLeyla felt a little frustrated over this whole thing. Why was it that she had to be here? But when she met his fiance\u2019s eyes, she immediately understood what Claudine was asking of her as soon as she shot her that toothy smile.With an inaudible sigh, Leyla leant down to grab the fallen bracelet. Just as she was about to straighten out, Claudine\u2019s foot moved, and stepped on the bracelet.\u201cAh, m-my Lady-\u201d Leyla\u2019s breath hitched as she landed on her knees and looked up at Claudine, before her eyes widened in surprise and the intense look Claudine was giving her.\u201cOn second thought, I think you should have it.\u201d Claudine hummed, Leyla gulped up at her. \u201cOh, why do you look at me in such a way?\u201d She wondered, before her foot moved up, and stepped right over Leyla\u2019s fingers.She didn\u2019t make any sound, but her eyes started glinting and shimmering as Claudine pressed harder on her.\u201cAren\u2019t you happy I\u2019m giving you something that\u2019s rightfully mine?\u201d she asked, tilting her head at the speechless girl, \u201cAfter all, you have a knack for wanting what\u2019s mine, don\u2019t you?\u201d She hummed thoughtfully, assessing her own pristine fingers before looking back down on Leyla.Leyla refused to make any sound, though Claudine saw them twitch the more she applied pressure over Leyla\u2019s fingers. Her tone was patient with Leyla, as though she was speaking to a naughty child.Claudine felt a tinge of pity at how pathetic Leyla looked. Almost like she\u2019s got a noose over her neck, waiting to snap it apart.\u201cOh, don\u2019t look at me like that, Leyla. It\u2019s true isn\u2019t it?\u201d Claudine continued.She bent down, and grasped Leyla\u2019s face gently, caressing it softly with the tip of her sharpened fingernails. Leyla\u2019s breath hitched once more.\u201cAfter all, don\u2019t you seem so fond of my fiance ?\u201dLeyla\u2019s eyes widened in fear at Lady Brandt\u2019s words.\u201cSo why should my jewels be any different? Let\u2019s stop kidding ourselves Leyla, it\u2019s so unbecoming.\u201d Claudine sighed in slight disappointment as she whispered against the poor woman\u2019s ears.Somewhere by the edge of the garden, stood Claudine\u2019s aide, Mary. She had been tasked by her mistress moments before she left to fetch the Leyla girl to be on a lookout for the Duke.She was to warn her mistress if he arrived unexpectedly.In her vantage point, she could see what was happening by the balcony. She knew before that her orders, though simple, were of vital importance. But what could her mistress be discussing with a lowly orphan?She tried to take a peek out of curiosity at what was going on, but the pergola blocked most of the view of the women from where she stood. Which was a disappointing moment, because she really wanted to see how her mistress was putting that cheeky girl in her place.Mary remembered the first moment she saw Leyla, and immediately felt unnerved about her presence. She\u2019d known the girl since childhood, yet something about her was off, especially when she remained so stiff and ungrateful even as she was being paid to do honest hard work.She took an assessing gaze around the mansion, jaw clenching as she performed her duties.The Duke had mentioned he had a gathering to attend to, and thus couldn\u2019t come home until evening at the earliest moment. It was far from evening, but the Duke was well-known to be prone to finishing things earlier than he said he would. He could even return a day earlier.She needed to remain vigilant, even against the sun\u2019s glaring rays.Leyla remained frozen in place, her heart thundering in her chest as she grew numb to the way Claudine was putting more pressure over her fingers.Everything around her was muffled, as though she was seeing and hearing things under water. It almost felt like a dream\u2026But if it was, then this was just a cruel nightmare.\u201cYou poor thing,\u201d Claudine cooed at her, \u201cLook at how much you\u2019re trembling right now.\u201dShe continued to caress Leyla\u2019s cheeks gently.\u201cOh, but fret not Leyla, I could hardly do anything to my fiance\u2019s precious mistress.\u201d She sighed out, \u201cHe adores you too much for me to be able to do anything.\u201dHer hands stopped caressing Leyla, before it moved to cup her chin gently, lifting it up enticingly to make Leyla look up at her. Claudine looked so innocent and kind, but her eyes held a visceral anger towards Leyla.\u201cContrary to how I usually treat you Leyla, I don\u2019t hate you that much.\u201d Claudine admitted, \u201cIn fact, I find that I am rather sympathetic to your plight, after all how could this have been your fault to begin with?\u201dFinally she removed her feet off Leyla\u2019s fingers. The poor girl let out a shaky breath as she looked up at the woman in confusion with a hint of fear.\u201cM-my Lady?\u201d Leyla\u2019s eyes began to glimmer as tears pooled on the corners.\u201cShh,\u201d Claudine hushed softly, \u201cAre you going to cry in front of me?\u201d She then let out a knowing smile, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say Leyla, but they don\u2019t work on me as well as they do with my fiance.\u201dAnd then the smile slipped away from her face, and the look in her eyes darkened as she continued to look down on Leyla.Leyla felt as though her heart was being seized, her chest tightening as she tried to breath properly, yet the chill in her bones kept her frozen!She couldn\u2019t help but let out a gasp, praying for the deities above to spare her!\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a story of a maid just like that, Leyla.\u201d Claudine told her, releasing her chin, before she began petting Leyla on the head like one would with a well-behaved dog.She began her tale about a daughter, she came from a high ranked family. She was getting married, but before that, she made a request from her maid. She asked if she would sleep with her soon-to-be husband, just to give her an assessment on what kind of a man he would be.After all, no noble lady such as her must engage in premarital acts. It was frowned upon. And she trusted her maid, she\u2019d been proven to be very loyal to her lady, and accepted the task readily.\u201cOur situation is very similar to that one, don\u2019t you think so, Leyla?\u201d Claudine asked the unresponsive girl, \u201cTruthfully, affairs are no problem to me. I\u2019ve learned to navigate around them. So I\u2019m thankful for you.\u201dShe watched as the faint hope in Leyla\u2019s eyes began to dim the more she spoke.It was like she was already being sentenced to hang, and suddenly, the wooden floor beneath her feet was pulled right under her and the noose tightened up around her neck with a painful snap!Claudine had a feeling this could be the final blow for Leyla, and soon she wouldn\u2019t have to endure the incessant cries of noisy birds in the background. She might have gotten\u00a0down and dirty\u00a0against her fiance\u2019s mistress, but who could fault her for trying to create a perfect marriage?\u201cAre you surprised?\u201d Claudine piped up once more, \u201cTo be honest, I was really surprised. All this time I thought my fiance would always be such a cold and calculating man. He probably wouldn\u2019t even break a sweat when our wedding night arrives.\u201dShe gasped, and then tilted her head towards Leyla.\u201cIs he good in bed? I\u2019ve been dying to know. Perhaps it\u2019ll be the only thing I can look forward to in a wedding with him.\u201dLeyla remained trembling in place. With Claudine no longer holding her chin up, she could only remain resolutely staring at the ground beneath her, wishing for the ground to swallow her up now and never return her to this place.\u201cCome now, don\u2019t be shy. After all, the maid in the story was very thorough in describing them to her lady.\u201d Claudine teased, \u201cAlso, I heard you moaning so wantonly last night, so he must be good at it!\u201dSuddenly, the gentle caresses stopped as Claudine gripped a handful of Leyla\u2019s damp locks in her hand, and pulled her up, smiling when Leyla gasped at the sudden harsh treatment she got. Claudine drew closer to Leyla, their breath intermingling with each other.\u201cTell me Leyla, tell me how much you loved it.\u201d she softly demanded.Leyla\u2019s eyes could only glisten blankly as she stared into Lady Brandt\u2019s icy glares. The glassy look in Leyla\u2019s eyes was grating at Claudine\u2019s nerves, but she also found some satisfaction in them, and let it be.\u201cCome now Leyla, your Lady is asking you how much you love basking in the arms of the man who keeps ruining your life?!\u201dIt made Leyla freeze in place.\u201cMiss Lewellin!\u201dIt was Mary, Claudine\u2019s maid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everything was so muddled, she wasn\u2019t paying attention, only so focused on the fact she was found out.But why did she say it like that? Leyla knew how much the Duke ruined her life by making her enter an affair, but why did Lady Brandt make it sound as though it started long before that?It was like she saw something in her eyes, which prompted Claudine to let her go abruptly and laugh pitifully at her.\u201cGoodness, you haven\u2019t realized it yet, did you, you poor girl?\u201d Claudine shook her head in disbelief as she laughed. \u201cOh, you truly are so pitiful.\u201d She sighed, drawing closer to look Leyla firmly in the eyes.\u201cHe helped ruin your engagement with Kyle. Did you know that?\u201d\u2018What?\u2019\u00a0Leyla blinked, as something in her sparked at the new information.\u201cTsk, you\u2019re still the same after all,\u201d Claudine clicked her tongue in disappointment, \u201cYou\u2019re still so clueless about the things around you Leyla.\u201dAnd so Claudine began to tell her.She told Leyla about what the Duke did last summer to break the two of them apart, just so he could finally have Leyla all to himself.Leyla listened in rapt attention, eyes frozen as she stared into space at the memories coming back to her all at once as to why she broke things off with Kyle.She told her about bearing witness to him, unmistakably, meeting with the man who was revealed to be Mrs. Etman\u2019s cousin, who had stolen Leyla\u2019s college funds. She also overheard him lying to the policemen that very morning about not seeing anyone.He then proceeded to have someone run an investigation into Daniel Rayner\u2019s bank finances, something she recently discovered due to her using her father\u2019s name. He must have already assumed Daniel Rayner would be Mrs. Etman\u2019s accomplice, and yet let Mrs. Etman took the fall for it.\u201cCan you see it now Leyla, how all the puzzle pieces fit together?\u201dLeyla looked gobsmacked and downright idiotic at this very moment. How could she have failed to see the signs?And so Claudine continued, telling her of her lack of knowledge what had transpired after that. But if the Duke let Mrs. Etman took the fall, then nothing could be traced back to him. No one would even suspect he\u2019d been involved.Claudine was very pleased she held her tongue back then. It wouldn\u2019t matter as much as it would now. Not for her at least. As for Leyla, well\u2026\u201cIf you doubt my words, then go ahead and ask him yourself.\u201d Claudine hummed, \u201cIt\u2019s merely just speculation on my part after all, interpreting the data as I see fit. But you seem to trust him explicitly.\u201d She grinned towards the poor woman, \u201cYou can rest assured, he won\u2019t lie to you.\u201dShe made it sound like friendly advice, when it was made with intentions that were anything but. Leyla was still stuck in the memories of last summer, even as she listened to Claudine\u2019s words more clearly than she ever did before.She remembered the way the Duke remained in silence as her plans to marry Kyle were being discussed around them, almost as though he was disinterested. He only came back as soon as the conversation was finally over.By then, autumn had just begun.\u2018This was all planned?\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought in disbelief, the gravity of his hold and influence over her life now looming ominously overhead,\u00a0\u2018Impossible\u2026 no man could ever be so cruel!\u2019She refused to believe it!\u201cWell, it is difficult to believe, so I don\u2019t blame you for it.\u201d Claudine sighed, \u201cAfter all, thinking all of that was true would only make you more miserable, I suppose.\u201dShe continued to regard Leyla, before finally sighing. Her job here was almost done.\u201cBelieve it or not, it\u2019s your choice.\u201d Claudine told her, \u201cIt won\u2019t change the truth anyway.\u201dShe stood up from the bench, putting on her gloves back, before she walked over in front of Leyla, who was now collapsed on the floor at the new information she had just imparted on the unknowing girl.\u201cAlthough I guess it was a good thing you didn\u2019t know anything about that. I almost thought I misunderstood you for a moment.\u201d She told her, \u201cI almost thought you\u2019re another selfish girl, who just wanted the benefits of becoming the Duke\u2019s mistress, but alas, you proved me wrong once more.\u201dClaudine began to walk away, before pausing to look back at Leyla\u2019s shivering posture.\u201cAlthough knowing you\u2019ve been so clueless does bring me a new wave of sympathy over your situation.\u201d She leaned down, and patted Leyla\u2019s shoulder comfortingly, ignoring the way she jumped up at the touch.\u201cI am truly sorry for you. Perhaps, if I\u2019ve been more careful, you would have become the next Mrs. Etman by now, instead of being stuck to warm the Duke\u2019s bed.\u201dLeyla remained quiet, her thoughts still swirling in the back of her mind.\u201cOh well, it\u2019s too late to change things by now. And look on the bright side! Claudine beamed at her, \u201cIt does seem he\u2019s taken quite a liking to you, so it can\u2019t be so difficult to get him to dote on you, will it?\u201dShe forced Leyla to look at her once more, gently holding up her chin to turn towards her direction.\u201cI plan to be friends with you Leyla, after all, we both will be stuck with the Duke, so I must get along with you to some degree as someone he holds very dear.\u201d She hummed. \u201cSo don\u2019t feel so guilty about it.\u201dClaudine then frowned in thought before she turned to look at Leyla.\u201cAh, but it will be ridiculous for us to remain in the same estate as soon as we get married, so perhaps looking for other living arrangements outside of Arvis will be best for you.\u201d She informed Leyla.\u201cThen again, it\u2019s the Duke we\u2019re talking about, so of course he knows just where to place you! So really, you have nothing to worry about.\u201d Claudine finished with a smile.Finally, she rose back to her feet, patting Leyla gently a few times, while Leyla hunched in on herself further.\u201cChin up Leyla,\u201d Claudine piped up once more, \u201cYou must now hold yourself up proudly as the Duke\u2019s mistress at this point. There\u2019s no more use for you to degrade yourself further in pity.\u201dLeyla remained silent, even as Claudine grabbed her hands gently, pulling her up away from her huddled position. As soon as she stood up, Leyla hugged herself, wanting nothing more than to curl up.\u201cCome on, Leyla, you can do better.\u201d Claudine told her, \u201cWell, I have to say goodbye now, but before I leave, I do want to establish a clear order between us.\u201dFinally Leyla looked at her with red-rimmed eyes.Claudine might be being harsh on Leyla right now, but she needed to also hold herself up in high dignity as the Duke\u2019s future wife. Leyla only shook her head, as though she was in great pain. She looked as though she didn\u2019t know what she was doing anymore.Claudine\u2019s eyes narrowed at her.\u201cLet\u2019s start again Leyla.\u201d She scolded the girl, \u201cYou must remain polite.\u201d She cautioned her.Such cowardice she was showing her. It sickened Claudine even though her tears refused to fall.Leyla only bowed her head further down in front of her. As soon as she did so, one fat drop of her tears hit the top of her shoes. Soon, more fell down, as finally Leyla cried freely in front of her, as she remained in a bow.Claudine sighed and backed away from Leyla, finding a little more tolerance in her for the other woman\u2019s tears.\u201cWell, at least you\u2019re a good girl.\u201d She mused. Leyla\u2019s mannerisms were still lacking, and considered to be far from polite, but Claudine will have to take what she could for now.Upon her words, Leyla once more collapsed back onto the group in a heapful of uncontrollable sobs. She looked even more undesirable, looking like nothing more than a broken doll.Deeming it time for them to go, Claudine swiftly left her alone, her dress sweeping behind her as it fluttered with the wind as she walked out of the rose-covered pergola. Finally, it felt like she could finally get rid of that nasty feeling as though she was being used like a common earthenware.After all, this was a life rightfully hers, something she worked hard to get. For things like that, Claudine could be downright terrifying, such was the life she was taught and learned to live in.When she reached the end of the pergola, Claudine spared Leyla one last look behind her. She was still in her pathetic state, crying soundlessly to herself as she lay broken on the stone cold floor.Claudine scoffed before she faced forward once more, with a lighter look on her face. She calmly stepped down the marble staircase, where Mary greeted her enthusiastically as soon as she reached the last step in the middle of the rose garden.\u201cI think we should pack up my things by now, Mary.\u201d Claudine calmly announced, making her aide blink back in surprise.\u201cYour things?\u201d She asked in confusion, \u201cDoes this mean you are returning to Brandt Estate, my Lady?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Claudine smiled at her amicably, \u201cYes, I think it\u2019s time to return now.\u201d\u201cBut, my Lady, shouldn\u2019t you wait for the Duke\u2019s return before leaving him so suddenly?\u201d\u201cMary.\u201d Claudine called out her name firmly, and she quickly stilled as her mistress looked at her with a smile, but a stern look in her eyes.Immediately, Mary bowed in agreement, before Claudine wordlessly walked away with absolute grace, and a lightness in her gait.Claudine was absolutely confident that before summer even begins, everything would be set in place once more. Perhaps even before spring truly arrives, all her puzzle pieces would be back in their respective places.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*The day of Bill Remmer\u2019s return, was also the day Kyle Etman left Arvis once more.Just as he arrived, rumors about his departure quickly spread throughout the estate. And where rumors about Kyle were mentioned, Leyla\u2019s name soon followed. Each of Arvis\u2019 occupants gossiped with one another in hushed tones, wondering why he would leave so suddenly.\u201cI don\u2019t get it, how could he just come and go so quickly?\u201d\u201cI bet it\u2019s because Leyla won\u2019t take him back.\u201d\u201cI feel so sorry for him.\u201d\u201cOr maybe he just came to visit his parents? He hasn\u2019t come for a while, has he?\u201d\u201cImpossible, I heard him and his mother were still at odds, even today.\u201d\u201cTruly? Mrs. Etman must still be angry about his almost marriage to Leyla then.\u201dThe endless chatter between the house maids\u00a0 only ended when the bell chimed across the mansion.\u00a0 It was a sound they all knew to be coming from the third floor.It was a summon from Duke Herhardt. It seemed he had some guests with him waiting to be served.Immediately, the house maids scattered, each back to their tasks, while the maid with the longest experience in serving the household wasted no time in preparing them some tray before she hurried up the stairs to attend to their master\u2019s wishes.Although he wasn\u2019t difficult to please, something about the Duke greatly intimidated them, which caused every servant under their employ to hasten every task they were given if he gave the order. Even serving the Duchess was easier to serve, despite her incessant need to complain and nitpick about every single thing they do.Once she arrived outside the Duke\u2019s office, she balanced the tray in one hand, before knocking politely against the mahogany doors.\u201cCome in.\u201dShe heard faintly, and quietly opened the door, carrying the tray with both hands as soon as it was open and went in.Upon entering, her eyes widened momentarily at the sight of her master\u2019s guest.There, sitting across their esteemed Duke from his desk, was the man who was single-handedly responsible for destroying Arvis\u2019 heaven\u2014 as the people used to call it-\u2013 the greenhouse.Mr. Bill Remmer.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Leyla found herself stopping by a portion of the greenhouse\u2019s walls, observing as the repairs were in full swing as they hurried to restore it back to its former glory.She also watched as a few more precious plant specimens were being airlifted overhead, before being relocated to where they were supposed to be planted. Bill Remmer\u2019s return signaled more tasks to come, especially with the new varieties of plants he\u2019d gathered with the others.Leyla tried to keep herself calm as she watched all this progress, clasping her hands in front of her as she fidgeted with her fingers, trying to clear her mind.She hadn\u2019t had the chance to spend much time with her uncle yet, what with the Duke calling for him as soon as he arrived. He didn\u2019t even allow her uncle a time to change and rest with Leyla back in their own cabin.He assured Leyla he\u2019ll be back shortly, telling her it would be rude to refuse their gracious Duke, and followed the attendant without any complaints. Watching him walk away from her, and towards the Duke was a terrifying thing for her.It was like his mere presence in Arvis was suffocating even though she couldn\u2019t see the Duke nearby.\u201cOh Leyla!\u201d one of the garden workers looked up to see her with a teasing smile on their faces, \u201cI thought you\u2019re all grown up now! Yet still you look so much like that little girl struggling to catch up with Mr. Remmer.\u201dLeyla flushed at the observation, before laughing awkwardly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I guess I just missed him so much!\u201dThe others laughed as they began talking over each other, each with their own stories to tell while they\u2019d been away from Arvis. It was nice catching up with them, but soon they had their own tasks to return, and once more Leyla found herself alone.And the easy smile she had, slipped from her lips without a moment\u2019s thought.Was the Duke going back on his word? Would he tell Uncle Bill after all, about what Leyla had been doing behind his back?Her eyes looked over towards the mansion with a steely gaze. She was nothing more than skin and bones now, filled with an endless combination of shame, sorrow, confusion and painful anger deep inside her heart.And that anger was embedded deep into her heart, festering the longer she refused to look away from the mansion that Duke Herhardt owned and was holding her uncle over her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He noticed that Bill seemed a little bit tense, but the old gardener only stiffly agreed, immediately going to grab the cup of tea. Which left Matthias feeling a little bit confused.Matthias watched as Bill took careful sips of his tea as he did the same with his own cup. Once he deemed he let the gardener relax enough, he spoke up once more.\u201cFirstly, I would like to thank you for working hard for us for a long time.\u201d\u201cAh, it was my pleasure, Duke.\u201d Bill stammered, trying to calm himself down in front of the man who spared him. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful that you even allowed me to stay in Arvis, and to correct the great wrong I\u2019ve done. Ah but I\u2019m not saying this to appease you!\u201d He flushed, \u201cTruly, I am so grateful for you, my Duke.\u201dBill bowed his head in reverence at Matthias. He would forever be grateful for the act of mercy the Duke bestowed upon him. He would have rotted in jail because of his negligence, and yet this man prevented that, and allowed him to fix his mistake!How could he ever repay the Duke?\u201cWell then, what do you say about continuing to work for us even after your work in Arvis\u2019 greenhouse? Say, in the Herhardt mansion, located in the capital city?\u201d Matthias offered, cutting straight to the point.He thought about it long and hard, and knew this was the only way Leyla would ever move to the capital\u2019s mansion he owned.Bill Remmer was a permanent fixture in her life, she wouldn\u2019t dare leave him alone. As such, if he were to convince Mr. Remmer to move to Ratz, then Leyla would soon follow, just to remain by her uncle\u2019s side.Bill looked at his young master in a mix of perplexion and confusion.\u201cMy Duke, is\u2026 is this because of the accident?\u201d he asked rather meekly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as though I\u2019m ungrateful for the continued opportunity to work for you, but I had thought after my job with the greenhouse was finished, you would let me go?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Matthias hummed, putting his teacup down on his desk, before clasping his hands in front of him as he stared at Bill, \u201cBut it isn\u2019t just because of the incident that I am thinking of transferring you.\u201dBill looked even more nervous now.\u201cI recognize that the garden in Arvis is too large. I anticipate it will be harder and harder for you to maintain it as the years go by.\u201d\u201cOh it\u2019s not-\u201d\u201cAdditionally,\u201d Matthias interrupted, eyeing Bill a little bit in disapproval for interrupting him when he wasn\u2019t even finished. \u201cThe gardens in the mansion in Ratz are of a smaller scale. Much easier to maintain, plus I want it to be on par with the gardens here, in Arvis.\u201d Matthias finally finished.Bill wanted to deny that work in Arvis was fine as it is despite him advancing in age, but he can\u2019t deny the words of his master, because the Duke was not wrong. It was growing more difficult for him to keep maintaining the vast gardens in Arvis estate, even if he is still in his middle-ages.\u201cTruly, I thank you for this opportunity, but I don\u2019t know where to put myself, Duke.\u201d Bill admitted regretfully, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m at a loss at how I can earn your confidence in me.\u201d\u201cThen you need only continue working for Arvis.\u201d Matthias replied plainly.Bill Remmer eyed him nervously, his eyes dropping down to look at his reflection in the tea, and saw how weary his eyes looked back at him.\u201cDuke Herhardt, I knew since you gave me a second chance, I could never remain to work in Arvis after that. In fact, I already planned to leave Arvis with Leyla as soon as my work is done with the greenhouse. It\u2019s only fair I leave, especially after you\u2019ve given me mercy.\u201dSomething in Matthias\u2019 eyes darkened as he looked at the old gardener.\u201cMr. Remmer, I didn\u2019t free you from your sins out of mercy.\u201dHis tone was calm, yet cold. Bill gulped his tea nervously, before putting the cup down in front of him to look at his young master\u2019s face properly.\u201cAs I was saying, you worked for my family for many years, and your expertise and skills are outmatched.\u201d Matthias explained once more, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why, I want you in Ratz, to make use of your skills there as well. So there\u2019s no need for you to feel indebted to me.\u201d He finished explaining, yet there was still some doubt in Bill Remmer\u2019s eyes.\u201cI-I see, my Duke,\u201d Bill wetted his lips nervously, as he rubbed his clammy palms on his pants. \u201cB-but how could I move so far away and leave my Leyla behind?\u201dMatthias raised his cup over his lips, allowing himself to smirk victoriously before answering him.\u201cThen take her with you.\u201d He pointed out, and Bill blinked in surprise.\u201cTake Leyla with me?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Matthias hummed, and took a sip of tea, before putting it back down on the table. \u201cIn fact, why don\u2019t we become Miss Lewellin\u2019s patrons while she\u2019s staying there?\u201dBill seemed even more flabbergasted.\u201cPatrons?\u201d Bill repeated to himself, before looking back at the Duke with awe in his eyes, \u201cYou mean you would fund Leyla\u2019s college?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Matthias nodded his head lightly in affirmation. \u201cIt was unfortunate that last year\u2019s theft happened, but my grandmother had expressed her wishes to fund Miss Lewellin\u2019s education back then.\u201dMatthias proceeded to tell Bill that things had gotten too hectic before, which was why it hadn\u2019t come up until now. Should Leyla retake the college entrance exam, and get accepted, she would officially be sponsored by the Herhardt house, as was his and his grandmother\u2019s will.Bill couldn\u2019t believe such a generous offer from the people he caused so much trouble to!He really was so fortunate to have been employed by such gracious people! Any other family would have thrown him to jail for his crime, but the Herhardts just kept giving him and Leyla so many blessings on their way!How could such kind people exist in reality? People like this only existed in stories as far as he knew, and yet here was one in front of him!Matthias watched as the light began filling the old gardener\u2019s eyes, and knew he\u2019d convinced the man.\u201cWell, what do you say Mr. Remmer?\u201d Matthias asked coolly at him, \u201cAre you willing to accept this opportunity?\u201d*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*\u201cUncle!\u201d Leyla greeted excitedly, and half filled with relief at the sight of him.The first thing she took note of was how healthy his complexion seemed. At the sight of her, Bill gave her a warm smile, before huffing at the sudden force at Leyla throwing her arms tightly around him.He couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her enthusiasm at seeing him return.\u201cOof! What are you, a child!?\u201d Bill teased as he pulled away and fixed his scarf, \u201cYou seem to forget you\u2019re not as small as you used to be Leyla. And what are you doing out here waiting for me? Didn\u2019t I tell you I\u2019d meet you back home?\u201dHe patted Leyla\u2019s hair fondly like he used to when she was so much smaller, and Leyla only giggled, immediately grabbing onto one of his arms and hugging it close to her as she rested her head on his shoulders.Quietly, she closed her eyes as she sighed in relief.\u2018He still doesn\u2019t know.\u2019They walked peacefully side by side, with Leyla feeling less alone with her uncle back at her side. The trek back to their small cabin was long, but the walk hardly felt tedious with their pleasant company.Leyla jogged a few paces ahead, holding the door open for him to enter as he shuffled through their door, and praised Leyla for the feast she had prepared for his return. Leyla urged him to get changed as she warmed up the food.As soon as that was done, and all the food was warm once more, they both sat down at the table, ready to eat.\u201cAh, Leyla, I would like to tell you that the Duke just offered me a great chance!\u201d He announced excitedly at her, as he piled some of his favorite food on his plate. Leyla\u2019s smile stilled in her expression at her uncle\u2019s words.\u201cA chance?\u201d She asked quietly, careful to keep the smile on her face, \u201cWhat kind of chance?\u201d\u201cHe offered me a transfer to their mansion in Ratz,\u201d Bill started.He proceeded to relay to Leyla the information the Duke gave him in their impromptu meeting. How he would move to stay in the Herhardt mansion in Ratz and tend to their smaller garden there instead.And how he was even allowed to bring Leyla!\u201cAnd that\u2019s not even the best part!\u201d He continued excitedly, \u201cThe Duke even offered to be your patron! They\u2019re going to send you to your dream college! Isn\u2019t that amazing!?\u201d\u201cPatrons\u2026\u201d Leyla mumbled in shock, to which Bill mistook her surprise in being given such a generous offer.\u201cOf course you will need to pass their entrance exams once more, but I know you can do it again!\u201d Bill declared proudly, \u201cIt was originally Duchess Norma\u2019s idea, but the Duke supports her decision wholeheartedly. They both agree how amazing you would be.\u201d He smiled proudly at Leyla.Leyla could only think about how further it would drive her deeper into the Duke\u2019s clutches and control.\u201cDo you think I should take the offer, Leyla?\u201d Bill asked her, looking a little expectantly, and yet despondent at the same time.\u201cUncle\u2026\u201d\u201cTruthfully, I\u2019m feeling a little shameless at accepting the offer about what I just did, but if it\u2019s what you want to do, then I can do it dear.\u201d Bill said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019d be more than happy to stay and move to Ratz if it meant you get to live your dream.\u201dLeyla felt like her throat was closing up. How could she even begin to tell her uncle no?She steadily grabbed her glass of water, trying to delay the time she needed to say her answer. Looking at her uncle\u2019s happy expression stung Leyla\u2019s eyes.She couldn\u2019t bear to see it gone.Suddenly the day Claudine revealed to her all that she knew about the Duke and her affair with him seemed to be so long ago. She didn\u2019t even remember how she stood back up and brought herself home.All she could recall was her bawling her eyes out on the floor, barely unable to stop herself from crying until she exhausted herself.She wanted to deny everything. All of Claudine\u2019s accusations seemed too cruel to be true, but Leyla found herself in front of Daniel Rayner\u2019s house. And with no further thought, she rapped her knuckles against his door to seek answers.She couldn\u2019t even think about how rocky her relationship with Daniel Rayner had become because of what happened. Right now, she felt invincible within her armor of pain and numbness. She needed to prove Claudine false.She couldn\u2019t be right about Matthias planning for her engagement with Kyle to be destroyed.When Daniel had seen her that day, he looked as though he saw a ghost, and moved to close it once more, but Leyla held it open, a desperate plea went out her mouth.\u201cI just need to know one thing!\u201d She exclaimed, holding the door open, \u201cJust one thing! You owe me this!\u201dHer words, fortunately, made him stop and relent to her.\u201cThat day you stole the money meant for my college fund,\u201d Leyla began, ignoring the way he flinched at the reminder of what he did, \u201cDid you, or did you not, meet the Duke on your way out of our cabin?\u201dShe didn\u2019t know how much she would regret ever seeking the truth from him, for she regretted knowing his answer.It took him a while to give it, but by then it was too late for Leyla to turn back.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you need to ask me that after all this time but\u2026\u201d He began, looking so exhausted, as though he wanted to move on from his crimes.\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Leyla trailed off as she recalled that moment.He avoided looking at her as he said it, but she could hear he was telling her the truth. He spoke a few more words, but it was drowned out by the ringing in her ears as the truth hit her in full force.She staggered away from him, and faintly remembered how Daniel Rayner hurriedly slammed the door behind her, sounds of the locks on his door being reinforced, but Leyla hardly cared anymore. She just kept walking, even as the road darkened in front of her and her head pounded, unable to produce more tears.She remembered the police officers telling them how the money failed to turn up, and no witnesses came forward. They even went to the mansion, and asked the Duke himself, but no one had seen anything.The puzzle pieces fell into place.Claudine hadn\u2019t been lying.She knew it had been a possibility. As a noble lady, Claudine von Brandt would dare spread such a baseless lie, not when she would lose too much if she were to get caught defaming her fiance\u2019s good name.\u201cLeyla?\u201d Uncle Bill called out for her once more, shaking her out of her thoughts and she looked back at him with a practiced smile.\u201cIf you need more time to think about it, then I completely understand.\u201d\u201cI agree I will need time to think about it, uncle.\u201d Leyla smiled at him, and he reciprocated it, before looking at her in an apologetic way.\u201cI do want you to consider it though Leyla,\u201d He admitted, \u201cBecause we both know by now, I can\u2019t give you the life you wanted. The duke is offering to give you wings that I can\u2019t give you .\u201d He pointed out sadly.And Leyla felt her heart breaking at her uncle\u2019s words.\u2018Oh uncle, if only you knew he was the one who brutally broke my wings.\u2019\u00a0She thought in complete despair.Uncle Bill reached out from across the table, to hold her hand in a comforting manner.\u201cI know you\u2019re the kind of person who can reach beyond what people expect you to if you put your mind into it,\u201d He praised her softly, \u201cSome will be envious, but more others will be inspired by you.\u201dHe looked at her with such warm, and loving eyes, it shone brighter than the light Leyla had put on the table for them. She could only smile shakily back at him, taking more sips of her water to keep her throat from drying in her guilt and nervousness.They continued to eat their dinner, the topic shifting to what he had seen in his travels, and then exchanging mundane stories of what they had done while away from each other.Dinner ended with them sitting out on the porch, cups of coffee in hand as they leaned against each other. The night had rolled out of the sky, the wind picking up around them, but not yet cold enough to make them freeze.Fortunately for Leyla, Uncle Bill decided to retire to bed early. His travels still left him tired, and Leyla happily let him, staying out on the porch to look up at the starless skies above.She had been struggling to hold in her composure as her uncle was around, but she couldn\u2019t deny the unbridled anger simmering underneath her skin, especially when she closed the door to her bedroom, only to see Phoebe return, with a note attached from the Duke.Just as she thought as she unrolled the small piece of parchment open, his orders remained the same, and she must go to him. But this time, she felt no fear or shame at their impending meeting.No, her mind had never been as clear as they were tonight.She\u2019s determined to escape the clutches of both the Duke and Duchess Herhardt of Arvis Estate.She ripped up the letter, and tossed it into the open flame as she walked over to her closet. She glanced over her wardrobe, before grabbing the clothes and shoes the Duke had bought for her.Next, she sat in front of her vanity, putting more effort into styling her hair in a presentable way. After all, she must look her best tonight. She\u2019s meeting someone very dear to her, she mused sarcastically.This time, she\u2019ll stop begging for him to release her.She stared into her reflection with steely eyes, satisfied at how beautiful she made herself appear to be. The intricate braid she made framed the nape of her neck beautifully, and complemented the clothes perfectly.\u2018Just as I learned from you, I\u2019ll bide my time,\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought as she put on some light make up on her face and smiled enticingly at herself in front of her mirror,\u00a0\u2018This time, it\u2019s my turn to play with you, and break your heart at the right moment.\u2019A strange excitement came over her, making her feel giddy all over, even more than her previous plans of simply denying the Duke whatever he wanted. This time, she knows better. This time, she finally knew how to break a man\u2019s heart.\u2018Looks like it\u2019s time for me to give you your own medicine, my Duke,\u2019She smirked, mind finally made up.She\u2019d be his perfect mistress, give him the excitement he craved, and present herself so beautifully for him. She\u2019d stop fighting him, and make him feel appreciated. She\u2019ll give him promises she\u2019d never intend to keep, before she\u2019d just casually\u2026And cruelly\u2026Rip his heart into a million little pieces.Leyla quietly walked out of her cabin, weeks of experience making it a lot easier than before now that she wasn\u2019t dreading to see him.After all, how would she dread the thought of seeing him on his knees?How could she even dread the thought of seeing him so miserable and in pain one day like he did for her?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stood in front of the doorway in bewilderment, wide eyes staring at her from head to toe.She wasn\u2019t the Leyla he had grown used to seeing.All of a sudden she was here, in front of him. All dressed in the clothes and gifts he\u2019d long given her. Gifts she had sworn off of.\u201cMay I come in?\u201d She asked him in that cautious melodic voice, looking up at him through her curled lashes, blinking them so enticingly.Finally, Matthias stepped away, letting her in, widening the door for her to enter.\u201cWait here for a moment.\u201d Matthias softly commanded her before he strode back into his drawing room. He could sense Leyla begin to follow him quietly.Upon Leyla\u2019s entrance, she saw multitudes of papers strewn across the table. There was a stack of other papers and documents in one corner table. It was as if he was in the middle of doing his work.\u201cYou must be very busy.\u201d Leyla remarked softly as she looked around. Matthias only spared her a glance before he expertly stacked some of the papers neatly on his desk.\u201cOnly a little.\u201d\u201cPerhaps I should return at a later time?\u201d she lightly suggested, when Matthias shot her a knowing smirk, before plopping himself languidly on his sofa.He crossed his legs, spreading his left arm onto the backrest as he leaned back and looked at her with sharp blue eyes. He casually brought over the folder with his right towards him, flipping it open.\u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d He said, \u201cYou can rest just fine here if you like to.\u201d He invited, and Leyla\u2019s eyes narrowed in his direction.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for me to rest.\u201d Leyla reassured him, taking a seat on the sofa right across from him, her hair swaying with her every move in a graceful manner. \u201cI can wait just fine for you to finish.\u201dAnd so she did. She sat patiently and quietly across from him, still dressed and well-poised. Matthias couldn\u2019t help but keep stealing glances at her, still drinking in the sight of her in all the things he\u2019d given her.She hardly looked like the Leyla he knew. No, there was a more powerful air around her, one that screamed neither in helplessness nor support of him.Kyle. The name was right at the tip of his tongue, tempting him to speak the name. He wanted to test her. He wanted to see how she would react if he were to say that name to her now. Especially after this unexpected makeover.But he wouldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t want to destroy this image Leyla was portraying just for him. Not when she\u2019s at the precipice of acting so docile to him on her own volition.He went back to work, a smile settling neatly on his lips as he scanned through his documents.Sounds of papers flipping started filling the room, with the occasional rustling of clothes. Fire was cackling in the background as well, the firewood burning into embers. The air around them was almost peaceful.But Leyla didn\u2019t want to get too ahead of herself. To keep her jitters down, she picked up a nearby newspaper on the table beside her and flipped through its contents. On one of its pages, was an article talking about the resource market fluctuating because of the current unstable situation internationally.She felt herself beginning to calm down, and eventually discarded the article. She hardly understood what it was about, so instead, she looked up to observe Matthias. He was still focusing on his work.Leyla couldn\u2019t help but keep staring at his frame, his features being illuminated by the subtle orange light from the flames.He was still in the same position as before, but now she was beginning to feel that sense of intimidation wafting out of him despite how serenely he looked. He really did have the perfect profile of a royalty.As though he was born with the world being offered beneath his feet. And he\u2019s owning it.She wrung her finger in front of her in secret, biting her lower lip in thought as the anxiety was rising up in her again.\u2018Can I do this?\u2019She asked herself.\u2018Do I really have what it takes to break such a powerful man?\u2019She gulped nervously, gaining Matthias\u2019 attention, who looked up at her direction in that instance. She jolted in her seat once his eyes landed on her, but she didn\u2019t dare look away.They stared into each other, with Matthias carefully looking over at her, before he flashed her a small smile. It was that moment that Leyla could feel hope bloom in her chest.That she could do this.Because as powerless as she was, she was relieved to see how much the Duke wanted to keep her with him too. It was a toxic possessiveness, but one she could use to her advantage. The more she would encourage his attachment to her\u2026The more painful the hurt would be at the end.She couldn\u2019t understand why it took her so long to realize this. His lust for her was a double-edged sword. He was hurting her because of it, but she could just as well use it against him too.She looked back up at him, having failed to notice how her gaze fell back to the ground.He\u2019d taken all her precious firsts from her.When he had forcibly taken her first kiss from her, not even a week later, she heard he\u2019d gotten engaged to Claudine. At that time she was already engaged to Kyle, but she couldn\u2019t deny the stinging in her chest at that knowledge.And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, he proceeded to be the key reason why her marriage to Kyle fell off, through the use of cowardly tactics. And now he\u2019d be marrying someone just as beautiful as she was cruel.Those two were perfect for each other.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d Matthias wondered out loud, the smile still firmly on his lips, yet he looked at her with a sharp glint in his eyes. Leyla held his gaze for a moment, before taking a deep breath.It was time for action.\u201cI heard you ordered Uncle Bill to work in Ratz, and you want me to go with him.\u201dMatthias nodded, not even denying it as he went back to his papers.\u201cAlthough I will argue that it was a suggestion. Hardly even an order.\u201d Matthias argued nonchalantly.\u201cI think otherwise.\u201d Leyla reasoned back, \u201cYou knew very well this so-called suggestion would be difficult. And so you used my uncle, to further my becoming more into your mistress, even beyond your marriage to Lady Brandt.\u201dMatthias chuckled softly, looking up at her through his lashes.\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d\u201cHm, you really are a despicable person.\u201d Leyla hissed softly in a shaky voice.Finally, Matthias closed the folder he was holding and set it aside. He then tilted his head towards her, interest seeping through his eyes the more he observed this new Leyla in front of him.\u201cAre you even aware of how despicable you are?\u201d She asked rhetorically, not expecting an answer as she tried to blink back the welling tears. And Matthias didn\u2019t even deem it important enough to answer her.\u201cAre you aware of how much I despise you?\u201d She slowly got up, and slowly stalked towards him. The corner of her eyes were glinting as the firelight bounced off of her tears. Matthias only chuckled at her words, finding her completely amusing, though half in despondent as well.It flashed only for a moment, before that amused glint was back in his eyes. Leyla hardly noticed it. She was drawn to the way his breathing began to get ragged.\u201cSince you\u2019re all knowing, you would understand my next words too, won\u2019t you?\u201d She asked him softly, eyes trailed on his hands as it slowly went up to loosen his tie around his neck.In Matthias\u2019 mind, he was absolutely prepared for her usual tirade of how much she hated him, how much she despised him and was ruining her well-built life. But what she said next came completely unprompted and caught him completely off guard!\u201cDo you know just how difficult it is to love such a man as much as I hate you?\u201d She asked, stopping a few paces in front of him, barely an arm\u2019s length away.Matthias\u2019 brows crinkled at her statement.\u201cWhat?\u201dHe looked up at her in confusion, and saw the raw hurt and vulnerability in her eyes. She couldn\u2019t possibly be lying. Not when she looked so unsure in front of him all of a sudden.She was a terrible actress. He\u2019d witnessed that first hand. She couldn\u2019t be faking this.\u201cI do,\u201d She admitted to him softly, voice just above a whisper, \u201cI tried to stop it so much and deny it, but I found myself inexplicably attached to you as well.\u201dMatthias watched her in shock, words unable to form in his mouth as something began to stir deep within him with her words.He hardly understood what was happening right now.\u201cWhat I said to Kyle back then, that wasn\u2019t a lie.\u201d She continued, \u201cBecause I do, I love you so much that I hated the thought of it!\u201d her voice cracked\u2026\u2018Am I doing it?\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought desperately to herself,\u00a0\u2018Am I succeeding in deceiving him?\u2019The anxiety in her and the nervousness helped in her portrayal of how much her supposed love was tearing her up inside. It let authentic tears slip through her eyes, further selling the story she wished to tell Matthias.\u201cSo I\u2019m telling uncle to accept your offer, and I will go with him to Ratz.\u201d She declared firmly, \u201cI\u2019ve long been so ashamed of my feelings for you, I wanted nothing more than to run away and escape this undeniable truth\u2026 but it\u2019s getting harder and harder to deny myself this\u2026\u201dMatthias hung onto her every word, slowly rising to his feet. She looked up at him with a tear streaked face, and he wasted no time in backing her into the table behind her, trapping her within his arms.Her breath hitched as she looked up at him in surprise. The hungry beast in him awoke, and his mouth watered at the sight of her beneath him\u2026\u201cAre you saying what I think you\u2019re saying?\u201d He asked her softly in a sultry voice, and Leyla shivered in his arms, \u201cAre you finally accepting into becoming my mistress?\u201dLeyla felt herself flush at the growing intensity in his eyes, and she couldn\u2019t deny the way he was looking at her made heat pool in her gut. She looked down, blinking the tears away, yet his gentle grip caught her, forcing her to look at him.A lone tear ran down her cheek, as she bit into her lower lip and nodded shakily at him. Her heart was pounding deep into her chest, she feared the Duke had heard it and would give her away.She wished desperately for her success!\u2018Just this one thing!\u2019\u00a0She thought harder,\u00a0\u2018Let me succeed in deceiving him!\u2019\u201cI do have a condition,\u201d Leyla finally spoke out, regaining her voice as she grabbed firmly onto his arm, and Matthias\u2019 gaze narrowed towards her.\u201cCondition?\u201d\u201cYou once told me you don\u2019t enter deals that won\u2019t benefit you.\u201d Leyla reminded him, \u201cWell, I want something in return as well.\u201dMatthias seemed to contemplate this, watching her carefully before his sharp gaze softened up. Leyla felt a new wave of hope blooming inside her.\u201cWell, are you willing to listen to my conditions?\u201d She asked again.\u201cThen speak your mind.\u201d\u201cGive me your word first.\u201d She demanded and Matthias raised a brow up at her.\u201cYou want me to agree to a condition without knowing what the stakes are?\u201d He asked her, his eyes narrowing at her in suspicion once more, \u201cWho do you think you are to demand such a gamble from me?\u201dLeyla knew he would be like this. She\u2019ll have to appeal to that primal instinct in him then.\u201cI\u2019m Leyla,\u201d She crooned softly up at him, \u201cYour Leyla, am I not?\u201d she asked, one of her hands letting go of his arm, to cup his cheek tenderly. Matthias leaned into her hand, almost nuzzling into it, before he began to chuckle at her boldness.Leyla fervently wished she wasn\u2019t acting too much, and that he would bite the bait she laid out for him.Matthias had seen many beauties in the world. The river in the night, the lights on his ceiling, and the rows and rows of luxurious paintings in the hallways\u2026But none as beautiful as Leyla.\u201cTell me then Leyla,\u201d he crooned right back, looking into her determined eyes.\u201cGive me your word first.\u201d She demanded once more. She was hanging off his neck, her arm draped around his back as her other hand gripped tightly into his arm.Matthias let out a genuine laugh, his eyes wrinkling in delight.\u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d He told her softly, \u201cSpeak to me Leyla.\u201dHe cupped her cheek instead, his grip on her chin falling away. He looked deep into her emerald eyes, which seemed to be reflecting back his own happiness.\u201cI give you my word.\u201d He promised her.\u2018Finally.\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought in relief.*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Norma paused for a moment, and looked over to her grandson in shock. Even Elysee, who had been leisurely minding her own business, listening to classical music at the side, seemed to be taken aback as well.Only Matthias seemed unbothered by the news he\u2019d just given them.\u201cYou\u2019re really sending Bill Remmer to live in our Ratz Mansion?\u201d Norma inquired over to her grandson, finally breaking free of her shock. Matthias hummed and nodded at her.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThis is all unexpected for you Matthias,\u201d Elysee finally piped in, \u201cWhy the sudden decision?\u201dMatthias looked over to his mother\u2019s direction.\u201cI\u2019ve noticed how unhappy you\u2019ve been with the old gardener since the incident happened.\u201d Matthias began to explain, \u201cBut I won\u2019t deny how useful he\u2019s been in maintaining the gardens, but Arvis is too big and he\u2019s getting older. Ratz would be far easier for him to maintain.\u201d\u201cWell, that is true, but\u2026\u201d Norma trailed off, looking equally helpless as her daughter-in-law. The two current Duchesses remained silent, while Matthias took a calm sip of his coffee, before placing it back down in front of him.He saw no reason to further delay his plans, not when Leyla\u2019s being so agreeable recently. He also saw no further reason to keep their relationship a secret. She\u2019s made her decision after all.\u201cThen make me your lover.\u201d She told him as soon as he\u2019d given her his word. \u201cAs soon as you tie the knot with Claudine, I can\u2019t keep living in Arvis, which means I could never come back.\u201d She laid out for him.She looked absolutely heartbroken when she said that. And Matthias couldn\u2019t exactly deny her. Arvis was the well-known house and Herhardt undisputable property. Which meant it housed the official members of the Herhardt house, which includes the Duke\u2019s legal wife, the Duchess.This was how it had always been, and how it would always be.No mistress had any place in Arvis. Matthias knew that very well.\u201cSo until your marriage, while we\u2019re still here in Arvis, keep me as just a lover.\u201d Leyla asked him, \u201cBefore you hide me away in the shadows of Ratz, let me bask in the sunlight until that time comes.\u201dBut Matthias couldn\u2019t understand. How different was a lover from a mistress? As far as he knew, there wasn\u2019t any. But Leyla seemed to think otherwise.\u201c-hide me away in the shadows-\u201d her watery voice echoed in the back of his mind, something unsettling in him at the thought of her being hidden.Did she really have to voice it that way? It was so unbefitting for her, who needed to be shown off in the light.There was no way Matthias would keep her hidden. She thrived in the sunlight. She shined so brightly, she had blindsided him with her beauty. He wanted to keep that light in her burning, even more\u2026To keep her burning for him.Yet she was right. A mistress will always remain in the shadows of his wife. And that drew a slight frown in Matthias as he thought of that for the first time.\u2018Will she really be alright?\u2019\u00a0Matthias wondered,\u00a0\u2018Will she remain shining just as bright as she does now if I keep her in an eternal shadow?\u2019He\u2019d drawn her into his arms that night, hugging her into his chest and she settled in his arms just right, fitting perfectly the gaps between them.If he had the choice, he\u2019d never stifle that light. Let everyone see her for who she was.She was his.\u201cWell I can\u2019t deny your reasoning, even if it was a little sudden for you.\u201d Elysee remarked softly, humming in thought, \u201cBut if Bill goes to Ratz, what happens to his foster daughter here?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s going with him.\u201d Matthias answered just as quickly, \u201cI offered Bill that I would sponsor Miss Lewellin\u2019s education under the family\u2019s name in that college she was going to apply to.\u201d He elaborated.\u201cYou\u2019re sending her to college?\u201d Elysee gasped in aghast, \u201cAnd under the family\u2019s name!?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Matthias replied, completely unbothered, before he looked over to his grandmother, \u201cI happened to recall grandmother\u2019s wish to sponsor her last year. So I extended the offer.\u201dNorma seemed taken aback that Matthias remembered that. She had almost forgotten she said it.\u201cWell, y-yes, I did mention that\u2026\u201d Norma was unable to deny it.When the old Herhardt matriarch had heard about the young woman\u2019s broken engagement with Kyle, as well as her college admission fund being stolen, she had expressed her willingness to sponsor Leyla instead.\u201cVery well, though I will state, whatever decision both Bill and his foster daughter reach in regards to moving to Ratz must be respected.\u201d She expressed.Matthias allowed himself to smile minutely, which hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the two women who had raised him. Both Duchesses exchanged glances at each other, but opted to not point it out.Not out loud at least. They didn\u2019t have the right words as of currently.\u201cI\u2019ll take your words into advice.\u201d Matthias calmly replied. He gave them a respectful bow, before swiftly making his exit out of their shared drawing room. He still had much to do in the afternoon.Unbeknownst to him, as soon as he left, both his mother and grandmother shared their own conversation.His mind was too caught up in thought. Leyla\u2019s voice still echoing prominently against his purposeful steps, even as it echoed in his empty halls\u2026\u201c-hide me away in the shadows-\u201dAlas, that statement never suited her at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Cry, Even Better if you BegCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen vacation ended, and school began, Leyla found the children she taught had grown up quite a lot. They seemed bigger now, but they also seemed rowdier than before. She had a struggle trying to keep up with them, giving her such a hectic back-to-school day overall.She had been so busy looking out the window, lost in her many thoughts, that she almost missed the cry of a child right behind her.\u201cTeacher, it\u2019s done!\u201d they exclaimed, immediately jolting her out of her reverie. Leyla turned and looked down, taking the abacus from the child\u2019s hands and smiled at them in amazement.\u201cWow! You\u2019ve done so well today. I see your math skills have improved over the winter!\u201d She praised, leaving the young boy in a blushing mess as she acknowledged his growing skills. Suddenly, another burst of cry sounded just off to the side.When Leyla turned to look at what was the problem, she saw Monica crying as she tried to sit still to work on her set of math problems. Further observation made Leyla see that the boy seated behind Monica was pulling at the young girl\u2019s hair, tugging it harshly as they snickered to themselves.Leyla quickly returned the abacus to the young boy she had praised and quickly headed towards the other pair to break off the trouble.She had pulled Monica to her lap, while she harshly scolded the boy for his misbehavior, emphasizing how it was not good to find hurting people funny. The rest of the day went off without any further hitches as she continued to teach her lessons.As soon as she saw them leave when the final school bell rang, she went back inside her empty classroom.She took a seat on her desk, and looked out the window, watching the new blooms of green on the nearby tree branch. Slowly the color was returning all around her, with the winter white beginning to fade out.A new wave of determination washed over her.\u2018I need to finish this quickly.\u2019\u00a0She thought to herself, before quickly packing up her things.After all, she had just accepted to become a cruel man\u2019s lover.Goosebumps ran up her body as she recalled how she had lied to him so blatantly. But despite that, she thought the more appealing she was, the deeper she could hurt him. She could put up with any lie.In fact, she had been so happy he fell for her trap, she could hardly sleep in glee! Ah, she never knew the Duke was capable of giving her such satisfaction, never mind if he didn\u2019t know what he was doing.Right before she was leaving, Leyla made the decision to loosen up her hair, letting her golden locks cascade down her back. She shook her head a few times, loosening up some tangles before she retouched her makeup.She had been working on how to make herself more presentable to the Duke, and she had been improving, but in her mind it wasn\u2019t alluring enough yet. Even the current makeup style she was trying seemed clumsier.Perhaps it was better to remove it? But she didn\u2019t have much time left. She ignored the churning in her stomach the more she tried to beautify herself for the Duke; ignored the thought she had to put on a smile and pretend as if she was receiving gifts from someone she loved\u2026Ignored how she had to pretend once more she was torn with her love for him.And so she looked at her reflection, and gave herself a confident smile.\u2018Keep smiling Leyla,\u2019\u00a0She thought to herself,\u00a0\u2018Keep smiling so beautifully, soon, you\u2019ll show him your fangs that hold a poison just for him.\u2019*.\u00b7:\u00b7.\u2727.\u00b7:\u00b7.*Matthias stopped at the end of the road leading to the village school. It\u2019s been a while since he drove the car, but it wasn\u2019t as strange as he anticipated.When he had expressed his wishes to drive himself, both the attendant and the driver looked at him like he\u2019d grown two heads all of a sudden. They didn\u2019t argue with him though, so Matthias hardly cared about their thoughts on him driving.And so he checked the time, Matthias turning his head slightly to look out of the car window where he had the perfect view of the school. Just as he looked outside, he saw Leyla walking from the end of the road. She looked absolutely divine, especially with her golden hair fluttering along behind her with every dainty step she took.Matthias leaned back in his seat, breathing in deeply. He felt something easing up in his chest as he watched her leisurely. She was a quiet and an exceptionally busy woman and yet he found her so captivating .It was almost like he was watching a bird soaring elegantly in the skies.He\u2019d always been so enamored by her. From the time he first saw her as a child until now, she\u2019s remained unchanged, only growing more beautiful over the years.She appeared to have unanticipated the fact he would be waiting for her, and continued on with her hasty pace. She was so focused on her path, she almost missed the sight of his car until she was right in front of it.She probably would have completely passed him by too if Matthias hadn\u2019t knocked on his window.As expected, she jumped in surprise, and stopped in her steps. She whirled around and looked at the car next to her, before a beautiful blush bloomed in her face. And so Matthias unlocked his car, and casually got out of his car.Leyla took a couple steps back, sending him a grimace of a smile as he straightened up to his full length. Matthias gave her his own grin and Leyla looked around nervously before tilting her head up at him.\u201cUh, Duke, good to see you here.\u201d She greeted politely, before she nibbled on her lower lip, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, why are you here?\u201d She then lowered her voice, \u201cThe meeting place was not here.\u201dMatthias only raised a brow.\u201cYou\u2019re a smart girl, why do you think I\u2019d be here?\u201dLeyla glanced at the car behind him. Her eyes narrowed slightly.\u201cAre you\u2026 here to pick me up?\u201d She asked, careful not to let her disdain for him show. \u201cBy yourself?\u201dShe looked carefully in the car, and remembered he had gotten out of the driver\u2019s seat himself. It was highly unlikely for his chauffeur to be around and let his master drive the car when he could.Matthias did not answer her, but merely walked over to the other side of the car, and opened the passenger\u2019s seat, \u201cGet in!\u201d.Leyla stood undecided in place, hands gripping tightly on her bag\u2019s strap, before she approached him in stuttered steps.As soon as she got close enough, barely a foot away from him, his brows went up in sligh surprise.\u201cDid you put on makeup?\u201d he asked, a light laughter in his voice. It was so unexpected, Leyla floundered in surprise like she had been caught doing something she wasn\u2019t supposed to. Another blush bloomed on her plump cheeks.\u201cIs it weird?\u201d she asked timidly, and Matthias shrugged.\u201cA little,\u201d he told her, feeling a bit mischievous, only because her serious inquiring expression was too adorable to pass up on.Now Leyla grew conscious and unsure what to do. She could feel herself grow more embarrassed, and resolved to just remove the makeup. She hurriedly looked for her handkerchief when Matthias spoke up once more.\u201cDon\u2019t remove it.\u201d He told her, gently grabbing her wrist and taking it out of her bag from when she\u2019d been looking for something to wipe it off with.\u201cB-but you said it was weird!\u201d She spluttered, her blush deepening. He only smiled at her and shrugged. \u201cThen I should erase it!\u201d She insisted, and he lightly shook his head.\u201cKeep it on.\u201d He told her, \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful still.\u201dLeyla frowned.\u201cHow can I be beautiful yet weird?\u201d She asked incredulously. Matthias remained unbothered by her question, even though she had been obviously agonizing over what to do with her makeup.\u2018Did I screw up!?\u2019\u00a0She thought worriedly. Was her plan foiled because she couldn\u2019t wear makeup properly!? She couldn\u2019t help but feel anxious as she got in the car, Matthias shortly following her.Matthias spared her a side glance.\u201cCan\u2019t you just tell me which it really is?\u201d She asked again, the worry clear on her face. Matthias hummed a little bit.\u201cIf I tell you, will you finally do as I say?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Matthias hummed once again, \u201cDon\u2019t you like me having fun with you a little longer?\u201d\u201cThe makeup isn\u2019t for you, Duke.\u201d She insisted, even though it was all a lie, but her indignation made Matthias frown.\u201cThen who\u2019s it for?\u201dLeyla bit her lip, trying to even her breathing.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s for me.\u201d She mumbled softly, \u201cI-I want to make myself look nice\u2026 and then perhaps, you\u2019ll treat me nicely.\u201d She quietly admitted. The only way she could lie was to feed him half-truths, though at the same time it was like she was digging herself further into the ground.But she couldn\u2019t pull back now. She needed to be all in this time.Finally the sound of the car starting up reverberated around them, giving Leyla a sense of relief, until Matthias spoke up again.\u201cTell me Leyla,\u201d He began, looking at her as the car vibrated beneath their bodies. Leyla squeaked out a \u2018yes\u2019 in question, looking back at him. \u201cWhat is it you want me to do?\u201dLeyla spluttered for a few moments, unable to form her words.\u201cYou mean\u2026.if I\u2019m beautiful?\u201dMatthias lips curled up into a smile.\u2018It can\u2019t be this easy.\u2019\u00a0Leyla thought nervously. But what if it was easy because the Duke has some sort of ulterior motive for her. What if he already knew everything she\u2019d been planning?! Was he testing her? But then again, if she was succeeding then\u2026\u201cAm I beautiful now then? To the point you\u2019d wish to be nice to me?\u201d She asked, a little more confident, hoping her false bravado would help her convince him nothing was off about her.The car began to move, removing Matthias\u2019 eyes on her, making her breath a little easier after one last glance over to her.Matthias knew beauty was subjective. But Leyla was a different breed of beauty. He\u2019d seen none as beautiful as her.She really was beautiful, but the prettier she looked, the more he wanted to see her crumble in front of him. He wanted all of her, even her pain, under all costs. It was making him crazy the more he spent time around her.He knew very well when it came to these intense feelings he had for her, that all rational thought would leave him. He was drawn to everything about her. Her walk, her looks, even her terrible attitude towards him.Everything, he wanted to devour all of her if he could. And it seemed as though she was finally accepting him.But did she really just want him to be nice to her? Was it enough for him to just treat her a little bit better than he\u2019d been? It seemed absolutely impossible for that to be all that mattered to her, he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle in amusement.Normally he was unimpressed by the many noble ladies he\u2019s met over the years. Nothing in their expensive dresses, beautiful jewels and accessories made them exquisite to him. Yet here in front of her, despite how dismal her clothes were, he can\u2019t help but feel so driven around her.And seeing her all dressed up heightened that attraction more. When she\u2019d choose her clothes, her hairstyle, and even how clumsy she\u2019d put her makeup on, it just enhanced everything about her.Looking back now, he was already fulfilling her wish despite just making it now. He\u2019s been holding himself back from ripping her clothes off her body and just taking her here and now. He wanted to see her hair all messed up from when he\u2019d dig his fingers into her hair as she\u2019d throw her head back to reveal her pale neck for him to suckle in. To take her lips into his and just ravish her\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re not answering.\u201d She pointed out, \u201cI\u2019ll take it as a yes then.\u201d She quipped lightheartedly. She could still feel the blush firmly on her cheeks and opted to avoid further eye contact with him.A few moments later, she glanced nervously back at him. Feeling her eyes on him once more, Matthias let out a soft sigh, his hands still gripping firmly the steering wheel, with eyes trailed forward.\u201cWhat is it now?\u201d He asked her.\u201cN-nothing.\u201d She clumsily replied, \u201cI, I just didn\u2019t know you could drive.\u201d\u201cIs that so surprising?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d She plainly replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t think you knew anything else other than to ring your bell.\u201d There was a teasing glint in her eyes that made him believe despite her harsh words, she only meant them as a light-hearted joke.At first glance she was all so prim and proper. This certainly was a refreshing change for her, that Matthias couldn\u2019t help but chuckle in response.\u201cI think it\u2019s nice though,\u201d She added afterwards, \u201cFor it to be just us.\u201dThis seemed like the good time to sprinkle in some forms of affection, so Leyla just went with it. She even offered him a beautiful smile, she hoped it was convincing enough. She had been practicing them late at night, when her uncle was asleep, and the Duke wasn\u2019t looking for her.The streets were congested, full of carriages and cars as they drove through. When the car had to stop, only then did Matthias turn to look at her once again, yet Leyla maintained her relaxed state, even when they made eye contact.She held his eyes for a moment, before shyly looking away. A few moments later, she glanced back at him.Matthias on the other hand started feeling warm. It was like he\u2019s spending time with the sun, being in such close proximity with her, enclosed here in their own private bubble in his car.Even his throat had gone dry.\u201cHave you thought about it then?\u201d Matthias finally spoke up, licking his lips lightly before swallowing saliva, \u201cHow do you want me to love you?\u201dThe amused glint in his eye disappeared, now looking over at her slowly. Leyla immediately looked away, eyes trailed on her fumbling fingers over her lap. She felt like he was directly looking into her soul. Like he could see straight through her.She had resolved to become his lover, to seemingly accept that she would be his mistress. But she doesn\u2019t know the first thing about this.What do real lovers do?She would have preferred if the Duke continued to do what he wanted, but it seemed like he was completely fine with letting her take the reins in their relationship as of now.\u201cI, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d She stuttered, and began looking out in the streets once the road began to move along once more. She began to feel herself grow nervous, small beads of sweat sliding down her back as she looked outside for answers\u2026\u201cDinner.\u201d She finally said, after seeing some couples eating out by themselves, \u201cToday, you should take me to dinner.\u201d She elaborated. It was the first definite thing she thought of as she searched for answers outside.\u201cOh, also the fields of Arvis during spring would be filled with beautiful flowers!\u201d She jovially exclaimed, \u201cDid you know that?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cReally? In your own estate?\u201d Leyla asked a little incredulously, \u201cIt\u2019s a really beautiful view.\u201dShe noticed a wistful expression came over Matthias, almost like he was remembering something. So Leyla continued to ramble on about Arvis\u2019 fields when he remained silent.She talked about her childhood. How she used to play in the fields, and when she\u2019d grow tired, she would lie down beneath the shade of the tree. And when she\u2019d grow bored, she\u2019d sometimes bring her books and snacks with her. Sometimes she\u2019d even take a nap.She just didn\u2019t mention how she did all that with Kyle. The one person who\u2019d been hurt by him so cruelly simply because of his greed to have her.She hid her anger at him behind her bright smile, crinkling her eyes to prevent herself from glaring at him. To prevent her tears from forming.\u201cWe should go out in the fields as soon as the flowers begin to bloom this spring.\u201d She lightly suggested, \u201cAnd then I can show you just how beautiful your estate is.\u201d She offered, looking a little calmly, Matthias seemed to agree with her from the way his lips upturned.\u201cDo you like ice cream?\u201d She immediately asked, feeling a little awkward.\u201cIce cream?\u201d He finally piped up, a brow of his raising.\u201cYes! I like ice cream.\u201d She prompted, \u201cVanilla\u2019s my favorite.\u201d She added offhandedly.She had been on her way home, Kyle had been with her. He was waiting for her in front of their school gate back then, and they went to buy themselves some ice cream. As soon as the cold, and soft treat hit her tongue, its smooth and sweet flavor filled her with comfort and warmth.She quietly mourned the fact that those memories will never come to life once more.\u201cI\u2019ll buy it for you as soon as I get my paycheck this month.\u201d She said, \u201cThen we can go eat them together sometime.\u201dDid she finally learn how to lie so effortlessly? Everything was coming so quickly to her now, like the excuses and all these false lines just began flowing out of her. Matthias chuckled lowly, a smile on his face as he kept his eyes on the road still.\u201cYou\u2019re so generous lately,\u201d He pointed out, sparing her a glance at the corner of his eye, \u201cSurely you\u2019re jesting me.\u201dLeyla felt herself go pale.\u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026\u201d She trailed off, trying not to let herself grow further anxious. In her mind, she was wishing desperately for her lie to hold.\u2018Please let me succeed, please let me succeed\u2026\u2019\u00a0Over and over, she repeated that phrase in her mind.\u201c\u2026because I love you.\u201d She told him softly, looking at him calmly, \u201cDo you want me to go back to acting like I hate you?\u201d She asked him softly.Every word out of her mouth tasted ashen. She wanted to take it all back, but she wouldn\u2019t. This was vital to her plan to break him. She could feel her heart thumping wildly in her chest, waiting for Matthias to give her an answer.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t,\u201d She continued, \u201cI want to love you.\u201dFinally, something in Matthias\u2019 eyes softened the longer he watched her. She was a terrible liar. He could sense the truth in her words.And suddenly the heat around them turned into a comforting warmth. That gentle smile she was so freely offering him couldn\u2019t be deceiving. And she was smiling so beautifully, all for him.If only he knew that behind that smile, was the intense need to break him apart.Alas, that statement never suited her at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
