    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: 1Qingquan village after the rain, with a trace of cool in late autumn.At the entrance of the village, Gu Jiao is sweating after a man.This man is no other than Xiao Qin Xianggong, the most learned scholar in the town.Xiao Qin Xianggong is eighteen years old. He was born as beautiful as jade. Gu Jiao has been coveting him for a long time, but she has never caught the chance to approach him.This time, Xianggong of Xiao Qin came to the village and someone told Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao didn't even care to eat, so she ran out. But when Xianggong saw her, he ran to the carriage like a ghost.Gu Jiao pounced on the air and fell to the ground.\"Ha ha ha ha ha!\"There was a roar of laughter around.It's not the first time for Gu Jiao to be stupid, but whenever everyone thinks that she is too stupid to be stupid, she can do more stupid things.Who is Xianggong of Xiao Qin? Can you look up to her? Don't pee or look in the mirror!\"Toad wants to eat swan meat!\"\"Yes! His father is a councillor, and he is a scholar! I'll see a broken shoe! \"\"Broken shoes!\"\"Ugly\"Little fool!\"There are bear children learn to adults mouth unstoppable, one of them even grabbed the mud on the ground toward Gu Jiao threw over.Gu Jiao is so angry that she pours at the child, only to find that she stumbles and falls into the waterAt the bottom of the cold lake, the unconscious woman suddenly opened her eyes.What happened? Wasn't she on a mission when the plane hit an iceberg, destroyed and killed? How did you fall into the water?Gu Jiao struggled to go upstream.However, I don't know if it's because of the tragic fall, she can't make any effort.When she finally swam ashore, she felt that she was about to collapse.The villagers on the bank saw Gu Jiao sink and were going to use the pole to catch her. As a result, she floated up by herself. Everyone looked at each other, Shua scattered!Gu Jiao didn't understand what happened, so she saw a group of people in strange clothes running away.She lay on the cold grass and wiped the water on her face. Then, she was stunned.She looked suspiciously at her hand.This is a pair of 14-5-year-old hands, you know, she has 28, how can she have such a small hand?What's more, as a delicate queen in the secret service world, she knows how to maintain her hands, but her hands are covered with frostbite, and some parts are cracked.Soon, Gu Jiao found that not only her hands had changed, but also her figure was quite different.Gu Jiao's heart flashed a bold guess.She came up to the surface of the water to see what she looked like now, but she almost didn't fall.What are all these colorful things?Gu Jiao took the water to wash the inferior rouge on her face. However, this wash made her even uglier. She was yellow and skinny. There was a big red spot extending to the end of her eyes on her left face.Gu Jiao, who had a pimple for three days in her previous life, suddenly put on such an ugly face. She wanted to die again in the same place!\"Then, where is it? What Dynasty is it? \"As soon as the voice fell, she felt a stab in her head, and a section of memory that didn't belong to her poured up.Originally, she went through a dynasty that did not exist in history. This village is called Qingquan village, which is located at the foot of Qingquan mountain.The original owner, also known as Gu Jiao, is the only child of Gu Sanfang.Mr. Gu was a scholar when he was young. He was admitted as a child student. Later, he became Li Zheng of Qingquan village. This practice lasted for many years. Qingquan village is poor, and there's not much oil and water in it, but it's better to be hungry after all.Mr. Gu has three sons and a daughter who is not in the cabinet. His eldest son, Gu Changhai, has a son and a daughter with the Zhou family; His second son, Gu Changlu, had two sons with Liu.The front two rooms are full of people. When we get to the third room, it's like we've been cursed.It's hard to have Gu Jiao, but she is a girl, ugly and born silly.In the words of the village - this is a loss goods, no, it can't be sold!Since Gu Jiao was born, Sanfang has no children.The village gradually spread gossip that Gu Jiao was unlucky, so he lost his son.At first, Gu family just didn't take it to heart. Until Gu Jiao's parents passed away, Gu family realized that the child was really a devil in his life.Gu's family wants to marry Gu Jiao. The question is, who dares to marry her?It's also a coincidence that one day Gu Jiao strolled around the village and met a man who was hungry and dizzy, so she picked him up.Gu Jiao digested the memory in her head and walked towards a shabby hut in the west of the village.That's the home she lives in now.Hissing\u2014\u2014Halfway through, there was a sharp pain in the back of her head. Gu Jiao raised her hand and touched it, but her hand was full of blood.It must be that I have just knocked a stone under the water. I have broken it. I still have a lot of blood. I have to stop bleeding as soon as possible.Gu Jiao thought and went into her yard.In fact, it's just a small open space surrounded by a fence. Except for the hall, there are two rooms in the cottage. The bigger room in the East is Gu Jiao's.And this is not as big as the cloakroom in her previous life.This miserable journeyGu Jiao sighed and pushed the door open. However, just as she crossed the threshold, she was acutely aware that there was someone in the roomJudging from the breath, it's a man.The man hid behind the door, trying to hold his breath.Gu Jiao's lips started a sneer. If she walked into the room unintentionally, she closed the door with a bang. Almost at the same time, she grabbed the man hiding behind the door and stretched him to the ground!The man is bigger than she thought.If in a previous life, no matter how tall Gu Jiao was, she would not be afraid of it. But now, with her delicate body, she used her cunning strength and pressed her whole body up, and then she locked the other party.With one hand, she pulled off her hair band and tied it to each other's wrist. With the other hand, she grabbed each other's neck and said coldly, 'say! Who are you? What are you doing in my house? \"The man was stunned at first, and then a burst of shame and annoyance came to his head: \"Gu Jiao, you are crazy! It's meDo you know each other?An acquaintance?That's even worse.Gu Jiao not only didn't let him go, but also sat down and pressed the man's waist and abdomen to death.\"You... You get down here!\" The man gritted his teeth in a cold voice.\"Chi ~\" Gu Jiao sneered.She has always been the only one to call on others, but no one else is shouting at her. What's more, this is her house. She hasn't asked him what he's doing in it!Gu Jiao swung her fist and intended to teach him a lesson, but her elbow accidentally knocked open the window lattice behind her.Bright light came in and fell on the man's handsome face. Gu Jiao's eyes suddenly became round.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: 2As a yancon, Gu Jiao has collected many handsome men in her previous life, but she has never collected any... To be exact, all the beautiful men are not as good as the one in front of her.The man had a very clean face. His eyebrows and eyes were as delicate as jade carvings. His eyes were cold and deep as a cold pool.His face was sickly pale, but a touch of bright red appeared because of his shame and annoyance. On the contrary, it was so tempting.In addition to his age, Gu Jiao thought young man was more suitable than a man.\"Have you had enough?\" Xiao LIULANG asked.\"Didn't see enough, but...\" Gu Jiao swept his body board son one eye, Feng Mou tiny a MI, \"afraid to crush you.\"After that, Gu Jiao pretended to get up.However, although people are up, eyes still stick to him, meaningfully spin.\"Gu Jiao you...\" Xiao LIULANG was annoyed by her eyes.\"To help you?\" Gu Jiao poked her hand with a smile.\"No!\"Xiao LIULANG turned cold and stood up with a chair on one side.It can be seen that he is inconvenient, but he still refuses Gu Jiao's kindness.Then he no longer took care of Gu Jiao and limped out of the room.Gu Jiao now remembered who he was. It was Xiao LIULANG, the Prime Minister of the original owner.Xiao LIULANG was picked up by Gu Jiao. When he woke up, the family members asked him about him. They found that he was an orphan and had nowhere to go. They made a quick decision to marry Gu Jiao. Our daughter saved your life. It's better for you to get married. They forced Xiao LIULANG to marry Gu Jiao.It's more like being married. The dilapidated houses they live in are given by their families, and the land they plant is also given by their families. They are all the worst.When she got married, Gu Jiao didn't know that Xiao LIULANG was lame. When she knew that, she gradually began to dislike him and turned her head to \"hook up\" with Xiao Qin Xianggong in the town.People in the village hold injustice for Xiao LIULANG. The way is that a flower is inserted on the cow dung. Xiao LIULANG is the flower and the cow dung is her.Gu Jiao didn't know what Xiao LIULANG thought, but he could not see her in such an awkward way. His disgust for the original owner was obvious.Gu Jiao opens the cupboard door and intends to change her wet clothes, but sadly finds that there is no clean clothes in the cupboard.\"Brother Xiao, are you there?\"There was a beautiful voice outside the door.Here came a little woman in a big purple flowered coat. She wore a shiny bun and painted with powder. She was carrying a basket in her arm, which was covered with flowered cloth. It was hard to see what was in it.Gu Jiao soon found this figure from the memory of the original owner -- Xue Ningxiang, the little widow of Qingquan village.Xue Ningxiang is their neighbor. He likes to drill into their house on weekdays. Most of them choose to let the original owner run into him several times when he is not there. The original owner was stupid and suffered a lot from Xue Ningxiang.This time, the news that Xianggong of Xiao Qin came to the village was also revealed to the original owner by Xue Ningxiang.\"Oh, isn't this sister-in-law Ningxiang? What are you doing at my house in broad daylight? \"Xue Ningxiang was startled by Gu Jiao, who suddenly appeared, and then said disappointedly, \"how are you?\"Gu Jiao smiles, taps on the door and says, \"this is my home. Is it strange to see me? What are you disappointed in? \"Xue Ningxiang choked. Of course, she was disappointed not to see Xiao LIULANG.Xue Ningxiang looks at Gu Jiao again.People are still that person, but become a little strange. It's not as wooden as before. There's aura in the eyes. Even though she was wet, she didn't feel embarrassed. On the contrary, she had a frightening atmosphere.Must be his own eyes, how can a fool change?Xue Ningxiang raised her chin and said, \"I'm here to find brother Xiao!\"Gu Jiao said with a faint smile: \"brother Xiao is so intimate. Do you know my husband very well?\"\"Get out of the way!\" Xue Ningxiang doesn't care about her.\"What if you don't get out of the way?\" Gu Jiao blocked her.Xue Ningxiang didn't pay any attention to Gu Jiao. She raised her hand and pushed her to Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao gently let go, toes a hook.\"Ouch --\"Xue Ningxiang fell to the ground with her basket.\"Gu fool! You trip meThis kind of trip and trip drama has been staged many times before, but this time the object of trip was replaced by Xue Ningxiang.Gu Jiao arms, half leaning on the door, looking at her, as if to say, trip you how? If you have the ability to trip back.Xue Ningxiang seriously suspected that he was dazzled.As a matter of fact, Xue Ningxiang and the original owner have not dealt with each other for a long time. The two most gossiping women in the village are Gu Jiao, a fool, and Xue Ningxiang, a widow. But Xue Ningxiang was good-looking and diligent, and she was more respectable than Gu Jiao.At the beginning, Xiao LIULANG fainted at the entrance of the village, which was discovered by Xue Ningxiang and the original owner. The difference is that Xue Ningxiang was afraid of causing trouble and went to the village to call people, but the original owner picked them up directly.It was proved that Xiao LIULANG was an innocent scholar, and Xue Ningxiang regretted it.Xue Ningxiang opened his voice to scold, and Xiao LIULANG came out with a cold look.When Xue Ningxiang saw him, she suddenly changed her face and began to cry: \"brother Xiao, she bullied me! She tripped me upGu Jiao looked at Xiao LIULANG and said, 'she pushed me first.\"Xue Ningxiang was so excited that she said, \"listen, brother Xiao, she admitted it.\"\"What's the matter with sister-in-law Ningxiang?\" Xiao LIULANG interrupted her.Xue Ningxiang was stunned for a moment.She looked at Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao, picked up the basket on the ground and said, \"I... that... You read my letter last time, but I haven't had a good life to thank you. Don't you have nothing to eat at home? I went to dig some sweet potatoes in the field and brought them to you... \"Xiao LIULANG said: \"no, sister-in-law Ningxiang, there are corn noodles at home. Take them back and eat them yourself.\"Xue Ningxiang bit his lip: \"but...\"Gu Jiao pick eyebrow way: \"all said let you take back, didn't hear?\"Her voice is not big, but there is a chill in her smiling eyes.Xue Ningxiang's scalp was numb, and he didn't dare to wait any longer. He left with a basket on his arm.Gu Jiao looked at his cheap husband with a smile: \"I can't see it. You are a little lame. You are quite popular with women.\"Xiao LIULANG glanced at Gu Jiao faintly and went back to the house clutching his crutch.\"Sizzle\"The wound hurt again.Gu Jiao holds her head and goes back to her house.She sat on the stool and touched the wound. It's a big cut. It's not too deep, but if it's not disinfected in time, it's likely to be infected. But this is ancient times. Where can she get those disinfected things?\"If only my medicine box were still there.\"The idea just flashed over, Gu Jiao then felt his brain again hard to draw pain for a while, directly to her pain dizzy.When she woke up, she was surprised to find a box on the table in front of her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: 3This box is not big. It looks very shabby. It seems that it has been knocked down. It is uneven and the paint has fallen off. I don't know which dump it was picked up from.However, it is such a small broken box, but let Gu Jiao's heart rose from the infinite familiar.Gu Jiao Lengleng opened the box, the result saw the medicine inside, her brain immediately a buzz.noHer medicine box!Why is it here?\"I didn't dream, did I?\"Gu Jiao pinches herself. It hurts! It's not a dream!The box is also true, and all the herbs in it are genuine!Gu Jiao remembered that the small medicine box was beside her when the plane had an accident. Is that why it came here?It's just... How did it get so shabby? What about the flash blind local tyrant gold?Once upon a time, Gu Jiao thought the medicine box was ugly when it was still glittering. Now it's broken, and Gu Jiao thinks it's even uglier.However, Gu Jiao couldn't help holding the box tightly in her arms because she couldn't resist the feeling of intimacy from the bottom of her heart: \"my elder sister doesn't think you're ugly any more, and she'll treat you well in the future!\"Gu Jiao Haosheng wiped the small medicine box. Fortunately, it just broke on the outside, and the things inside were not damaged.Gu Jiao took a few gauze and a bottle of normal saline from the small medicine box to detoxify the wound, and then chose an antibacterial ointment to put on herself. Then took two anti-inflammatory drugs, thought to bandage, later found unnecessary.After dealing with the injury, Gu Jiao is a little hungry. She puts the medicine box into the cabinet and plans to go to the kitchen to find something to eat. But before that, she needs to change into clean and dry clothes.Gu Jiao hesitated, went through the hall and knocked on Xiao LIULANG's door.\"What's the matter?\"Xiao LIULANG's cold voice came from the room.Gu Jiao said, \"I want to borrow your clothes. I haven't washed the clothes in the cupboard. I don't have to change them.\"Xiao LIULANG didn't respond for a long time. Just when Gu Jiao thought that he would not lend her his clothes, the door opened and Xiao LIULANG handed her a dry gown.The material of the sweater is not very good, and the color is a little old, but it is starched clean.If in a previous life, Gu Jiao would never wear a man's clothes, but who made the situation better than others? If she didn't wear this, would she have to wear the moldy ones in the cupboard?After changing her clothes, Gu Jiao washed the dirty clothes and then went to the kitchen.The kitchen is quite clean. Xiao LIULANG should have cleaned it up.The rice bowl is empty, but as Xiao LIULANG said, there is also half a jar of corn flour. Not only that, Gu Jiao also found two eggs and a handful of chives in the cupboard.Gu Jiao took out the eggs, baked two corn flour omelets, sprinkled with chopped scallions, and left a little dough. She made a small pot of corn flour soup.Gu Jiao takes the prepared food to the main hall.Xiao LIULANG's door is open.In my memory, they always eat their own food. Xiao LIULANG will leave a bowl in the pot for the original owner, but the original owner will go to his home to eat most of the time.Gu Jiao paused and knocked on Xiao LIULANG's door.\"What's the matter?\"Xiao LIULANG's cold voice came from the room.Gu Jiao said, \"I made dinner. Would you like to have it together?\"Gu Jiao seldom cooks, even if she does, she won't do his share. Therefore, he plans to wait for Gu Jiao to come out and do her own work.Xiao LIULANG looks at the closed door suspiciously.\"No, I'll eat first.\" Gu Jiao wanted to wait for him, but she was so hungry that she almost fainted on the ground.She has to replenish her strength as soon as possible.Gu Jiao just sat down. Before she picked up her chopsticks, the door creaked open.Xiao LIULANG came out.Xiao LIULANG didn't come to dinner.However, when his eyes inadvertently fell on Gu Jiao, suddenly stopped.When he gave Gu Jiao a long shirt, he took one that he couldn't wear, but it was still too big for Gu Jiao. His thin body seemed empty and clumsy.Most of it was for the convenience of working. She rolled up her hair and sleeves, revealing a thin white neck and thin wrists.Instead of the previous arrogance and madness, he just sat there quietly, eating the things in the bowl seriously.It doesn't look like her anymore.Xiao LIULANG's eyes slightly pause for a while, but finally coldly moved away.At this time, Gu Jiao found him and said to him, \"come on, sit down and have dinner.\"Gu Jiao's opposite is another set of chopsticks. It can be seen that she didn't shout casually twice. She really cooked food for Xiao LIULANG.However, Xiao LIULANG did not move.Gu Jiao understands what he is worried about. The original owner has a bad relationship with him. She suddenly makes food for him, which makes people suspicious. But Gu Jiao can't explain that she is not the person she used to be.After thinking about it, Gu Jiao said: \"there is not much firewood at home. If you don't eat it now, you will have to waste firewood for a while.\"I don't know if this sentence touched Xiao LIULANG. Xiao LIULANG finally sat down opposite her.When the original owner first met Xiao LIULANG, he was surprised by his appearance, otherwise he would not have picked him up. The original owner's dislike of Xiao LIULANG is due to his leg disease in the eyes of outsiders, but it is not in Gu Jiao's eyes.The original owner is stupid, but Gu Jiao is not. Some things are not thoroughly understood by the original owner. Gu Jiao knows everything through her memory.Xiao LIULANG, he just deliberately angered the original owner.He didn't want to be close to the original owner.In fact, she also meant it.Don't look at her teasing him. She can't do anything with him.Gu Jiao was soon full, took her chopsticks to the kitchen and carried a basket out.Xiao LIULANG didn't ask her what she was going to do, and she didn't say it. It was always the same between them.But when Gu Jiao came to the door, she suddenly turned back and said, \"I didn't cheat you just now. The firewood is really almost burnt out. While it's not dark, I'll go to the back mountain to cut some firewood. It may rain later. If I don't come back, you should remember to take away my clothes. \"Xiao LIULANG gave her a deep look.In the past, Gu Jiao would neither see the change of the sky nor explain where she was going.After Gu Jiao went out, there was only Xiao LIULANG left in the room, and the food that she could eat at that table.His family was poor, so Xiao didn't want to see Gu Jiao any more, and he couldn't live with food.He frowned, picked up chopsticks and put a piece of egg cake with scallion in it.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: 4Gu Jiao went out to cut firewood. On the one hand, she was really short of firewood. On the other hand, she wanted to go into the mountains to find something that could fill her stomach.Although the family is not poor enough, it's almost the same. If Xiao LIULANG eats alone, she may be able to support for a few more days. In addition, she is a bit stretched.Now it's late autumn, and the sky is clear.Not only is there no pollution, but Gu Jiao feels that the sky above her head is especially blue, which she has never seen before. The air is fresh and refreshing.Inexplicably came here, I do not know the Institute of that group of lunatics will miss her. Most of them are gnashing their teeth. It's strange that she suddenly disappeared without sending them the latest research results.However, she appears to be a doctor of medicine in the Institute of M University, but she is actually an agent. She joined the organization at the age of eight, and all her experiences since then have been a cover up for her real identity.Of course, she didn't plan to lick blood all her life. She agreed with the organization that this was her last order, and she left when she finished. Unexpectedly, something happened to the planeNow, it's a coincidence that the plane crash happened.It's just meaningless to talk about it now. She's dead, and it's impossible to go back and get revenge.No one should feel sorry for her death.Her parents divorced when she was eight years old. After that, they formed their own families and had new children. She was always redundant.In a sense, her fate is similar to that of the original owner. The original owner's parents left early, so it's unnecessary for the original owner to take care of his family.When the original owner died, no one would really feel sorry for her.Gu Jiao laughed at herself, and her eyebrows were cold.For fear of rain, Gu Jiao didn't go deep into the woods. However, Rao found a lot of good things: fungi, mushrooms, and wild fungus growing on the stump.Auricularia auricula is fat and thick, almost full of most of the stumps, Gu Jiao picked up the big ones.It is obvious that this area has been cut down by the villagers. There are many stumps and many Auricularia auricula.Gu Jiao picked one by one, and soon the basket was heavy.Seeing that the harvest was almost finished, Gu Jiao stopped in time, cut some firewood, tied the firewood to the basket with a rope, and carried it on her back to prepare to go down the mountain.However, as soon as Gu Jiaogang turned around, she suddenly felt that she had stepped on something.Then she heard a dull hum, very slight and weak.She blinked and moved her legs slowly.\"Not so bad...\"She took a deep breath, looked down, and saw a white bearded old man was knocked unconscious by himself in a weedGu JiaoNo, how could anyone lie in the gutter?She just stepped on her partner?Gu Jiao conscience very passable from his body across the past.But without two seconds, Gu Jiao came back without expression.\"First of all, I didn't save you out of conscience.\"\"Cluck, cluck, cluck\"In a tight cloth bag beside the old man, there was a pheasant whistling.Gu Jiao picked to pick eyebrow, carelessly swept that cloth bag one eye, cloth bag instant did not move.Then she looked at the old man with white beard in front of her. There was a big footprint on his face that Gu Jiao stepped on. It was very miserable.Look at the clothes, like an ordinary villager.But between the eyebrows, there was an indescribable dignity.Gu Jiao put down the dry wood on her back and began to feel the pulse for her partner.She studied western medicine when she was in school, but later, in order to perform a very special task, she lurked for five years in the home of the master of traditional Chinese medicine for the reason of learning skills.Judging from his pulse, there is no evil disease in his body. Gu Jiao speculated that she was infected with wind cold and high fever. She accidentally fell into the sewer and dislocated her left arm.Gu Jiao took out her small medicine box from the basket and put an ice bag on his forehead.Then, Gu Jiao took his arm back, cut a piece of wood, tore off his clothes, and brake his arm.After that, Gu Jiao took his temperature again and found that he was still high, so she injected him with a dose of fever reducing needle.Not far away, there is a small grass shed for villagers to rest on the mountain.Gu Jiao moved people there.When the fever subsided and she was about to wake up, Gu Jiao got up and went down the mountain. Before leaving, Gu Jiao left his umbrella to him.\"I don't treat people for nothing.\"Words fall, will a bag of pheasants Shun go.As soon as Gu Jiao got home, the rain began to fall, and soon it became torrential. The mountains are far away, and the villages are covered in rain and fog.Gu Jiao went directly to the kitchen.Xiao LIULANG has cleaned up the dishes and chopsticks, wiped the stove and collected his clothes.Gu Jiao put down the firewood and cloth bag, opened the cupboard and looked at it. She wondered, \"have you finished?\"She kept a lot of them.I didn't expect that the boy looked thin and had a big appetite.Is it really the age of growing up?Gu Jiao picks eyebrows and finds a cage to lock the pheasant in.Gu Jiao separated the small firewood from the big firewood and picked up the ones that needed to be split separately.It was evening when she finished chopping the firewood. The rain had not stopped and the room was wet and cold. She found a brazier and planned to light her own fire. Suddenly thinking of something, he went to Xiao LIULANG's house and knocked on his door.\"Do you want a fire?\"She asked softly.There was no response in the room.She called again, still no response.Gu Jiao saw that the door was covered and pushed it open. She looked up and saw that under the yellow oil lamp, the thin figure had fallen asleep on the old table.I still have an unfinished book in my hand.The book was obviously yellow, the cover was broken and covered with oil paper.Scholars in the countryside are very hard-working, especially Xiao LIULANG. He has been squeezed by his family and the original owner for a long time, and he can't even go to a private school. His learning depends on himself.Gu Jiao hesitated for a moment, walked over lightly, took a cotton padded jacket from the cabinet and put it on him.Xiao LIULANG woke up in the middle of the night.He didn't sleep well a few days ago, and he didn't think he would fall asleep on the table. When he opened his eyes, he found that he had a cotton padded jacket on his body. The center of his eyebrows was a frown, and the bottom of his eyes was a trace of vigilance.He frowned and looked at the book in his hand. Suddenly he heard a crackling sound. He turned his head and saw a burning brazier on the floor.The cold room was suddenly warmed by the fire.Xiao LIULANG's eyes fell on the brazier, showing a thoughtful look.There is only one brazier at home. After giving it to Xiao LIULANG, Gu Jiao doesn't have it here.Gu Jiao hid a small medicine box and quickly got into the bed, wrapping herself like a small silkworm chrysalis.Maybe she tossed a few times during the day, which made her little body very tired, so although she was a little cold, she fell asleep soon.Gu Jiao didn't dream for many years, but tonight she had a dream.She had a dream that a doctor came to the town. Xiao LIULANG went to him to treat his leg. As a result, there was a medical trouble in the pharmacy where the doctor was, and many people were injured by mistake.Xiao LIULANG had a lame leg, and no one else could run fast, so he was cut off by someone.Although the injury did not kill Xiao LIULANG, he missed the exam three days later.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: 5Gu Jiao was very surprised at her dream. She had a dream and a man.\"Do you miss him so much?\" Gu Jiao touched her chin strangely.But it's just a dream. Gu Jiao doesn't really care.At this moment, the sky is bright, and there are several stars in the sky. It seems that it will be a sunny day.Gu Jiao doesn't remember how long she hasn't got up so early. Although it's true that she worked in a research institute in her previous life, everyone who knows her well knows that she is a night owl, and her research and surgery are mostly arranged in the afternoon. As for the tasks given to her by the organization, few of them will work at sunrise and rest at sunrise.Gu Jiao is wearing her own clothes today.Last night, after Gu Jiao took the brazier into Xiao LIULANG's house, she roasted her clothes around the brazier. It's just that she didn't wake Xiao LIULANG up.Gu Jiao goes to the backyard to get water and wash.Xiao LIULANG's door was open, and he was no longer in the room.I thought I got up early, but someone got up earlier than her.Gu Jiao walked back and forth in the house, but she didn't see Xiao LIULANG. She only found that there was a bucket missing beside the water tank.Gu Jiao looked at half of the water tank and touched her chin without saying anything.The bolt of the front door was still inserted. Xiao LIULANG went out through the back door of the stove house and locked it from the outside. In this way, outsiders can't come in at will, but if Gu Jiao wants to go out, she can open the front door and go out.Gu Jiao finished washing, went back to the room to apply ointment and took anti-inflammatory drugs.At this time, before Xiao LIULANG came back, Gu Jiao sent the last corn flour. This is the last grain.Gu Jiao had to find a way to take the pheasant back to the town and sell it to her family in exchange for some food. But the original owner had never been out of the village, so Gu Jiao didn't know how to get to the town.To wake up, Gu Jiao takes a broom and sweeps the backyard, the main room and her own room. When Xiao LIULANG was away, she did not go into his house.Only half of yesterday's clothes were washed, and a few of them were in the wardrobe. Gu Jiao took them all out and put them into the big wooden basin in the backyard.In this dynasty, there were soap pancreases. The original owner had seen them on the stretchers of the peddlers. However, most of the villagers were poor and could not afford to buy them. They used the Gleditsia pods picked from the trees.Gu Jiao smashed the Gleditsia sinensis and put it on the clothes evenly, beating it constantly with a club hammer until a foaming foam came out, which began to scrub repeatedly.Acacia's decontamination ability is not as strong as expected, but Gu Jiao's obsession to clean her clothes is very strong.Finally, the belly pocket was rubbed out of a small hole.Gu JiaoWhen Gu Jiao finished washing her clothes, she almost used half a jar of water.At this time, the noodles also woke up. Gu Jiao made corn flour steamed bread and steamed it in the pot.Xiao LIULANG still didn't come back.There are two wells in the village. The old well is at the end of the village. It's near them, but it's almost exhausted. Gu Jiao estimates that Xiao LIULANG will go to the new well at the entrance of the village to draw water.It was dozens of steps farther than where Gu Jiao fell into the water yesterday. Normal people don't need a quarter of an hour to go back and forth. Xiao LIULANG's legs and feet are inconvenient. In addition to carrying a bucket of water, Gu Jiao reckons that he should be back in two quarters of an hour.Gu Jiao stood in front of the stove, looked at the direction of the front door, and finally opened the door and went out.Gu Jiao found Xiao LIULANG after a big Sophora tree near Gujing.Xiao LIULANG is surrounded by some fierce villains. The bucket falls to the ground and the well water splashes all over the ground.The villains each had two chicken feathers on their heads.The ancient version of Matt?Gu Jiao recognized the villains not only in her own village, but also in the next village. She committed crimes all day long, killing and setting fire, but not infrequently.Xiao LIULANG's crutch was taken away by a little villain. The villain was young, but his face was only 13 or 4 years old, but he was very arrogant.He pushed Xiao LIULANG to the ground and pointed his crutch to Xiao LIULANG's face: \"how many times have I warned you? Don't show up in front of me again! You're damn deaf, aren't you? Get out of Qingquan village for meThe little villain is still in the voice changing period, and his voice is familiar.The little villain's crutch beckons to Xiao LIULANG. Gu Jiao doesn't think about it. She steps up, raises her hand to block Xiao LIULANG, and kicks the little villain's ass.\"Ouch! Who the hell dares to kick me? \"The little villain was kicked to shit, turned his head to curse, but choked all of a sudden.Gu Jiao didn't care whether he choked or not. She took the crutch from his hand, cut his hand and tied it around his neck.The little villain was strangled so hard that he immediately cried out: 'sister! Sister! What are you doing? \"Gu Jiao was stunned.The villains on one side see that the boss is bullied and rush to Gu Jiao.The little villain howled angrily: 'stop it! This is my sisterThe scoundrels stay.Gu Jiao... Gu Jiao remembers who this little villain is, Gu Xiaoshun, the youngest son of Gu family.Gu Xiaoshun, who is 13 years old, is the youngest of his family's grandchildren and the only one who is close to the original owner. He doesn't think the original owner is a fool or ugly.The reason may be that Gu Xiaoshun is too promiscuous to study hard. His brothers and sisters always scold him, and his parents always beat him. Only the original owner would pull his hand foolishly and coax him with the sugar saved from his mouth. Xiaoshun would fight. Xiaoshun is really powerful.Gu Xiaoshun knows that Gu Jiao is stupid, but he is not a smart person.He thinks that whoever is good to him will be good to him.\"Sister! Sister! I'm in pain Gu Xiaoshun cried out wrongly.Gu Jiao let go of him, put her right hand behind her, pulled him up with her left hand, and asked faintly, \"why bully your brother-in-law?\"\"Brother in law?\" Gu Xiaoshun suspected that he had heard wrong, \"didn't you let me beat him?\"\"Me?\" Gu Jiao doubts.\"Yes Gu Xiaoshun looked at Xiao LIULANG and said in a low voice, \"you told me that you don't want this little lame man. Let me drive him away, so that you can be with Mr. Qin!\"He thought he was quiet, but all the people present heard him.Xiao LIULANG's eyes are cold.The villains are gone.Gu Xiaoshun said: 'sister, you won't forget? You told me that yourselfGu Xiaoshun won't cheat her. It seems that the original owner did say such a thing, but he doesn't remember it. Her brother didn't forget a word!\"I'll just... Casually say, are you serious?\"Gu Jiao has a toothache.\"And now what?\" Gu Xiaoshun realized that he seemed to have done something wrong. He hung his head and stood there like a little quail.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: 6Gu Jiao bends over, picks up the crutches on the ground with her left hand, goes to Xiao LIULANG and hands them to him.Xiao LIULANG took the crutch lightly and stood up clubbing.He went to carry the bucket that had fallen to the ground.\"You go.\" Gu Jiao said to Gu Xiaoshun.\"Oh.\" Gu Xiaoshun walks over and takes Xiao LIULANG to lift the bucket.\"Get some water.\" Gu Jiao said to Gu Xiaoshun.\"Get some water!\" Gu Xiaoshun said to a villain under his hand.As soon as the villain drew his lips, he grabbed the bucket and went to fetch water.Xiao LIULANG walked back without expression. He didn't say a word in the whole process.Until he went away, Gu Xiaoshun said again: 'sister, what's the matter? You don't hate him anymore? And sister, how did your strength become so strong? What was that move just now? You make it for me again! I'll do the same when I look back! \"Gu Jiao's knife flew by.Gu Xiaoshun shut his mouth bitterly.\"Boss! Here comes the water The villain came with a bucket full of water.\"If you don't bring it back to my sister... Cough.\" In Gu Jiao's oppressive eyes, Gu Xiaoshun took the bucket and said, \"OK, give it to me. You're all scattered!\"\"Then I went to the next village to play...\"\"What are you fighting for! Get out of here! Get out of hereThe villains broke up.Gu Xiaoshun looked at Gu Jiao with a smile: 'sister, don't be angry. If you don't hate your brother-in-law, I won't bully him any more.\"\"Do you often bully him?\" Gu Jiao asked.Gu Xiaoshun scratched his head: \"not often, just three or four times a month, four or five times? Five, six, seven, eightThe more he got to the back, the smaller his voice was. He had a bad memory and bullied him many times. He didn't know for himself.\"Go back.\" Gu Jiao said.\"Ah Gu Xiaoshun smiles and follows Gu Jiao with a bucket.Suddenly, his eyes fell on Gu Jiao's stiff right arm: 'sister, your hand is injured?\"\"Nothing.\" Gu Jiao said.\"It's all right! It's bleeding! \" Gu Xiaoshun put down the bucket, grasped Gu Jiao's arm, and rolled up her sleeve. There was a red blood on her right wrist. \"Did I just hit her with that stick?\"\"It's all right.\" Gu Jiao draws back her hand.\"And what happened to your head?\"\"A knock before falling into the water.\"The wound is hidden in the hair. How can the boy's eyes be so poisonous?Gu Xiaoshun said again: \"did you fall into the water? When? \"Gu Jiaotou did not go back.\"Ah! Sister! Sister! Wait for meWhen Gu Xiaoshun comes home with Gu Jiao, he suddenly finds that there is a young scholar at the door of the house. The other party is wearing a long shirt, gentle, elegant temperament, is a little proud brow.\"Who are you? What are you doing at my sister's? \" Gu Xiaoshun asked.The other side didn't look at Gu Xiaoshun, but gave Gu Jiao a cold stare: \"you're bullying brother Xiao again, aren't you? You wicked woman\"How dare you scold my sister?\" Gu Xiaoshun put down the bucket and swung his fist to the man.Although he is only thirteen, he is really capable of fighting, otherwise he would not be the first villain in all the villages.A weak scholar can't be his opponent at all.\"Xiaoshun.\" Gu Jiao stopped him.Almost at the same time, Xiao LIULANG changed his clothes and came out of the room.\"My classmate.\" Xiao LIULANG told Gu Jiao.The classmate snorted scornfully, went to hold Xiao LIULANG, and took the heavy burden in his hand: \"let's go!\"Gu Xiaoshun saw that Xiao LIULANG had taken all his baggage with him. He was stunned: \"where are you going?\"I'm not afraid of being beaten by him. I'm really going to leave, right?My classmates don't want to talk to Gu Xiaoshun.Gu Jiao didn't ask much. She just walked into the room in silence.When passing by Xiao LIULANG, Xiao LIULANG glanced at her slightly stiff right hand.Gu Jiao wrapped her hand with her sleeve, and could not see the blood from her wrist.But when she came into the room, she heard Xiao LIULANG's cold voice: \"I'll go to the town.\"\"For legs?\" Gu Jiao asked subconsciously.Somehow, Gu Jiao thought of the dream. She didn't believe it, but\"Are you going to have an exam in three days?\" Gu Jiao looks at him.Xiao LIULANG's eyes flashed a trace of consternation, but he still nodded: \"mmm.\"The classmate said: \"what are you talking about with her? Be careful that she will not let you go again! You forget that you missed the exam last time because of her! And your legs. If she didn't lock you up at home, you wouldn't miss Dr. Zhang! \"Gu Jiao turns to look at Gu Xiaoshun.She doesn't remember these things.Gu Xiaoshun pointed to his nose and said, \"can you speak? What does my sister stop him from going? My sister is ill. Is it decent for him to leave my sister as soon as he gets married? \"When she mentioned this, Gu Jiao had an impression. Shortly after she got married, she was really ill, but she was not really ill, she was pretending to be. Because someone told her that Xiao LIULANG would not come back after he left. She was a little widow like Xue Ningxiang.She didn't want to be a little widow, so she locked up Xiao LIULANG.She didn't know that because of this, Xiao LIULANG missed the exam half a year ago and the only chance to cure his leg.Gu Jiao looked at Xiao LIULANG's leg: \"that, actually...\"\"Brother Xiao, let's go! The carriage is still waiting at the entrance of the village! \" The classmate interrupts Gu Jiao's words and pulls Xiao LIULANG's head to the entrance of the village.\"I want to eat sweet scented osmanthus cake!\" Gu Jiao suddenly came out and looked at Xiao LIULANG and said, \"Li Ji's sweet scented osmanthus cake! I only eat it! If you don't buy it for me, I won't let you in! And burn all your books! \"\"Wicked woman!\" The classmate gritted his teeth and helped Xiao LIULANG into an old carriage at the entrance of the village. \"Brother Xiao, don't listen to her! Li Ji is a time-honored brand. How difficult it is to buy osmanthus cake! When you're finished, Dr. Zhang is gone! He is a doctor from the capital. He is more powerful than the doctor in the town. Only he can cure your leg. You must not be dragged down by that wicked woman! \"\"This is my elder sister, so I have to tell him!\" Gu Xiaoshun gives Gu Jiao a big thumbs up.Gu Jiao helped Fu e: \"do you know where the market is?\"Gu Xiaoshun nodded: \"I know, sister, why do you ask? Are you going to go? What are you doing? \"\"Chicken.\"\"Chicken? Sister, where did you get the chicken\"Pheasant.\"I didn't say that it was my forced payment.By the way, Gu Xiao took it for granted that his elder sister had caught him: \"elder sister, I find that you have changed and become more powerful than before!\"It's not stupid. It's more powerful than before. Gu Xiaoshun never treated the original owner as a fool.Gu Xiaoshun said the direction of the market. The market and the hospital are in the town, but one is in the West and the other is in the East.Gu Xiaoshun insists on going with her, but Gu Jiao refuses.Gu family people do not like Gu Xiaoshun and Gu Jiao go too close, said Gu Jiao silly, will take him silly.Gu Jiao went back to the room, opened the small medicine box, took Iodophor to clean up the wound, and applied some antibacterial ointment.I'm hungry.Gu Jiao went to the kitchen.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: 7After Xiao LIULANG came to the town, he was immediately taken to the hospital by his classmates.There was a long line outside the hospital, all of them came to see the doctor.The two stood at the end of the line.The classmate stood on tiptoe and looked: \"it's not too late, it should be able to line up.\"\"The fare, I'll give it to you later.\" Xiao LIULANG said.Classmate pat chest: \"you and I classmate and fellow townsman, polite this do what?\"? By the way, are you hungry? \"He went out in a hurry and didn't eat. Xiao LIULANG didn't eat any more.He took out a clean little bundle from his wide sleeve and opened it to reveal three beautiful corn flour steamed buns.\"Where did you get the steamed bread?\" Xiao LIULANG thinks these steamed bread look familiar.The classmate said, \"you took it from the stove. I just steamed it when I went.\"Xiao LIULANG twisted his eyebrows: \"how many did you leave?\"Classmate strange way: \"is not a total of only three?\"? Do you remember the steamed bread you made? \"Xiao LIULANG pursed his lips.After a while, he said, \"why didn't you leave one for her?\"The classmate was surprised: \"you said that wicked woman? What do you want for her? Did she hurt you enough? Besides, she doesn't eat what you make! \"The classmate picked up a steamed bread and chewed it. His eyes suddenly widened: \"brother Xiao, why is the steamed bread you made so delicious today?\"Xiao LIULANG walked out of the team.The classmate was stunned: \"brother Xiao, where are you going? You're almost thereXiao LIULANG didn't speak, just walked forward.The classmate looked at the long dragon who was almost in the lane behind him. He stamped his feet in a hurry and said to the woman behind him, \"Auntie, let's go to the toilet and come back soon.\"He caught up with Xiao LIULANG: \"what are you doing?\"\"Buy osmanthus cake.\" Xiao LIULANG said, through the alley, came to Li Ji's shop.Li Ji is a time-honored brand with a hundred years old. The number of people queuing here is no less than that of the hospital.The classmate was impatient: \"are you crazy? What a sweet scented osmanthus cake for that wicked woman! Do you know that Dr. Zhang only sits for half a day? After you buy the sweet scented osmanthus cake, the day lily will be cold! \"Xiao LIULANG is stubborn. Once he decides something, eight horses can't get it back.An hour later, Xiao LIULANG bought Li Ji's sweet scented osmanthus cake.\"I hope Dr. Zhang hasn't left yet.\" The classmate took Xiao LIULANG and went to the hospital.However, when they got to the gate of the hospital, they found that the long queue was gone, only surrounded by a group of people watching, and a group of dignified officers and soldiers.The classmate looked at the middle-aged man and asked, \"uncle, what's the matter here? Why are all the people who see a doctor gone? \"The middle-aged man said: \"just now, a madman rushed into the hospital and said that the doctor in the hospital had killed his mother-in-law. He took a knife and slashed all the people inside! See the aunt at the door? She was the last one to get in. As soon as she got in, the madman came! Fortunately, she ran out, but she also fell and broke her head! \"Isn't that Auntie the one behind them at that time?If they didn't leave, Xiao LIULANG was the last one to enter.With Xiao LIULANG's leg disease, it is absolutely impossible to run out, so most of the people who have been slashed also have him.On the way back, they said nothing.It was getting dark, and the carriage was walking along the quiet path, its wheels creaking.At this time, the town's carriages were no longer willing to run to the countryside. They rented a mule cart for 20 coppers. There was no carriage, only a simple canopy with air leakage at the front and back.They were stiff with cold.Suddenly, a thin little figure broke into Xiao LIULANG's sight.Xiao LIULANG's eyes brightened.It's a fork in the road.The front is the road back to the village, and the west is the road to the market.On the road from the market, Gu Jiao was carrying a heavy basket, panting.The afterglow of the setting sun has dispersed, she cage in the last twilight, skeleton thin.She raised her hand to wipe sweat, revealing the gauze on her wrist, which was covered with blood.\"Stop the car.\" Xiao LIULANG said.The coachman stopped the carriage.\"Why stop?\" The classmate asked puzzledly. Then he saw Gu Jiao walking on foot.Gu Jiao seems not to find them, just as an ordinary mule cart. Without raising her eyes, she turned and passed by the carriage.\"Come up.\" Xiao LIULANG said.Gu Jiao then turned her head and looked at Xiao LIULANG on the mule cart in amazement. Xiao LIULANG was sitting next to the classmate in the daytime.Classmate is still a face disgust, but did not say what not allow Xiao LIULANG to talk to her and so on.\"Come up.\" Xiao LIULANG said again in a cold voice.He is obviously a boy of sixteen or seventeen years old, but he has the calmness and momentum that does not belong to this age.Gu Jiao hesitated and went up.She sat opposite Xiao LIULANG and took down the basket on her back and put it on the ground.Xiao LIULANG looked at the basket and said, \"did you go to the market?\"Gu Jiao nodded: \"well, I went to sell two chickens and bought some rice and white noodles.\" I did something else.Xiao LIULANG took a deep look at her as if he saw something, but he didn't say a word.It is classmate toward Gu Jiao cast strange eyes, this silly evil woman will do business?But Gu Jiao didn't seem to notice him. She asked Xiao LIULANG, \"what about you? Did you see the doctor in town today? \"\"I don't know! It's all your fault! It's not that you are clamoring for sweet scented osmanthus cake. How can we miss Doctor Zhang's visit? \" The classmate won't tell her, because brother Xiao avoided a disaster when he went to buy osmanthus cake for her.\"That's a pity.\" Gu Jiao lowered her eyes and whispered.Her mouth said sorry words, but inexplicably people feel that she is not sorry. Did she already know about the hospital?It's impossible. With her urine nature, will you be so calm when you know you've saved brother Xiao? I saved brother Xiao last time and forced him to marry her. If I save her again this time, I won't go to heaven?The classmate sniffed: \"I ate the sweet scented osmanthus cake! It's not cheap, youGu Jiao calm: \"Oh.\"The classmate punched the cotton.After that, none of them spoke again.A very elegant carriage was coming.The classmate's mind swings, sits upright and says: \"look! That's the dean's carriage\"What Dean?\" Gu Jiao asked.The classmate said, \"the dean of Tianxiang academy! Xiao brother three days later to test the academy! The president is a native of the capital. He was once the first of the four talents in the capital. He is rich in learning and has a good command of the past and the present. No one has surpassed his achievements in the scientific examination twenty years ago! With his advice, he is better than a sage for ten years! If only I could be his disciple! But it's said that the Dean has not accepted apprentices for many years. I've been in the college for half a year, but I haven't even seen the dean's face.... \"The schoolmate chatters endlessly, too excited reason, forgot oneself is talking with the most disgusted person.In the carriage.The president of the hospital, dressed in white, sat respectfully on one side. On the front seat was an old man in cloth.The old man's left arm was bandaged, and he held a small broken umbrella in his arms. A big footprints from nowhere could be seen on his face.This makes it difficult for the president to say anything. He doesn't know, and he doesn't dare to ask.He bowed respectfully: \"why did you suddenly get out of the mountain? Without telling the students, they can send someone to pick you up? \"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: 8The road in the village is not easy to walk, especially to the home of Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao. There are so many potholes that it is easy to sink the wheels.The mule cart stopped at the entrance of the village.\"Brother Xiao.\" The classmate took the lead in jumping out of the carriage, reached out to help Xiao LIULANG down, and then carried Xiao LIULANG's burden down.After Xiao LIULANG stood still, he looked back at Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao jumped out of the carriage and carried the basket on her back.Xiao LIULANG took back his eyes and said to his classmate, \"go back, you don't have to send me any more.\"It's really late, and the coachman is a little impatient.The classmate then said, \"OK, I'm leaving. Don't forget the exam in three days. If the Academy doesn't have a holiday that day, I won't come to pick you up. Remember to go yourself. \"\"Well.\" Xiao LIULANG nodded lightly and took the burden.It's hard to walk at night. They don't have a lantern in their hands. Gu Jiao doesn't move and waits for Xiao LIULANG in silence.The classmate glanced at her coldly, pulled Xiao LIULANG away, and whispered: \"brother Xiao, you are good at taking the exam in three days. If you pass the exam, you will be able to live in the Academy. You don't have to be bullied by this evil woman any more! Don't worry about the leg treatment. I'll continue to inquire about Doctor Zhang. Oh, and you can eat sweet scented osmanthus cake yourself. Don't take advantage of that wicked woman! \"When Gu Jiao came back from the market with her basket on her back, she was sweating all over, but she was all dried on the mule cart. Her red face was white with cold, and she had some eyes in the moonlight.Xiao LIULANG's remaining light swept her, and her classmate wanted to explain a few more words, but Xiao LIULANG interrupted: \"I know, you go back.\"The classmate opened his mouth, but Xiao LIULANG didn't pay attention to him any more. He grabbed the burden in one hand and clubbed the crutch in the other, and turned to his own direction.Gu Jiao keeps up.Gu Jiao keeps a good distance from him and doesn't make people feel too close to him, but if she falls down, she can help people in time.However, Xiao LIULANG was very familiar with this section of the road, and nothing happened at home.Now it's all dark, and every door is closed. Only Xue Ningxiang comes out to pour the bath water, and is stunned at the door for a while.\"Ah Xiang, why don't you come in? What are you looking at? \"Inside, Xue Ningxiang's mother-in-law was lying on the bed and asked her hoarsely.Xue Ningxiang blinked and said, \"no, nothing.\"She must be mistaken. How could Xiao LIULANG and that little fool get together? Although they are two, they are more enemies than enemies.Old house.Today is the big room cooking, Zhou and her daughter Gu Yuee will be hot food end to the main room, set the dishes.In Gu's family, women don't eat at the table. There are only Mr. Gu and his eldest son Gu Changhai, his second son Gu Changlu and three grandchildren on the table.The old lady Wu, with her two daughter-in-law and granddaughter Gu Yuee, sat in the kitchen with a bowl.Mr. Gu is Li Zheng. He is more promising than most of the villagers who only know how to dig food in the field. Everyone can't see meat several times a year, but he can eat twice a month.Today is meat day.Pork stewed cabbage, even the soup exudes a strong meat flavor.But the pork is not much, one person can not eat two chopsticks.After Gu Changhai and Gu Changlu took a piece of each, they did not dare to make the idea of this bowl of meat any more, and turned to take pickles and pickles.Gu didn't eat much himself. He only took a small piece and gave Gu Xiaoshun and Gu Ershun a small piece respectively. The rest was given to Gu Dashun.Gu Xiaoshun carefully counted, full five, but also all big!\"Why do you give it to him?\" Gu Xiaoshun muttered bitterly as he picked up rice.Gu Ershun said softly, \"that's because the elder brother is a scholar. We'll point to the elder brother.\"When he said this, he could not help glancing at the meat in Dashun's bowl.He is greedy.It's really greedy.But he is used to this kind of discrimination.There are so many men in the family, only the elder brother is the material for studying. This year, the elder brother of Qiuwei was admitted to the county school, which is higher than his grandfather's original achievement.\"Cut.\" Gu Xiaoshun rolled his eyes, \"my brother-in-law is also a scholar. Why don't you call him to eat meat?\"\"How can it be the same? Big brother has been admitted to the county school. How can he compare with big brother? \"\"My brother-in-law just didn't take the exam.\"The two brothers still had to fight. Mr. Gu slapped the chopsticks on the table, and they shut up in an instant.Even Gu Changhai and Gu Changlu have some problems.The room was horribly quiet.\"Second brother, have you read the book I gave you? There are notes I made on it. You look good. If you don't understand, please ask meIt's Gu Dashun.He is the only one who dares to speak against the old man's anger.His voice is clear and smooth, and his tone is gentle. He really has the style of a scholar.How does Mr. Gu feel about this golden sun? His anger soon dissipated.Gu Ershun was flattered and said with a smile, \"thank you firstMr. Gu had taught all his three grandchildren, but only Mr. Gu Dashun passed the exam. Later, he could not teach him any more, so he sent him to a private school in the town.Private schools are too expensive, and family care can only afford the best.Gu Ershun dreams of being the same as Gu Dashun.\"Don't bother your brother these days. He wants to take an exam,\" Gu saidGu Ershun nodded respectfully: \"I see, grandfather.\"Gu Xiaoshun didn't want to stay much longer, so he left after three or two stutters.He wanted to go out, but he couldn't get through the front door of the main room or the back door of the kitchen. Wu's family was no easier to deal with than the old man.Gu Xiaoshun decided to climb over the wall.But he just climbed to half, was caught by Liu: \"Gu Xiaoshun! Come down to meGu Xiaoshun was dragged down by Liu.Liu slapped him on the head and said, \"your father's milk is here, and you don't want to live, do you?\"\"Don't hit me on the head!\" Gu Xiaoshun is impatient.\"Why are you out so late?\"\"My sister hasn't come to dinner all day. I'll go and see her.\"Liu snorted: \"it's just right that she doesn't come. What are you going to see? When you become a relative, you run to your mother's house day by day. What's it like? \"Gu Xiaoshun said: \"the third uncle and the third aunt didn't say that before they died. Yenai promised the third aunt that my elder sister would recruit a son-in-law in our family. The one surnamed Xiao is the son-in-law, and my elder sister is still our family.\"Liu said he couldn't do it, and gave him a good pinch!Gu Ershun is obedient but useless. Gu Xiaoshun is neither obedient nor useful. She gave birth to two children with handles!--Gu Jiao bought rice noodles in the market, but she didn't expect Xiao LIULANG to buy some more white steamed bread.Gu Jiao went to the kitchen to heat up the steamed bread.It was Xiao LIULANG who made the fire.Gu Jiao has no affectation.When she went out, the wound on her wrist was not serious. But she did something in the market and the wound was torn. Also thanks to her suspicion of insecurity at home, she took a medicine box with her and bandaged it on the spot.Neither of them mentioned the three corn flour steamed buns in the morning. Xiao LIULANG didn't explain, and Gu Jiao didn't question.\"Just eat here. It's warm.\" Gu Jiao said. She was so frozen that she kept shivering.Xiao LIULANG hesitated for a moment, and sat down on the small Wu beside Gu Jiao.They were so close to each other that he could see the birthmark on Gu Jiao's left face.In the past, Gu Jiao was covered with thick powder, but now she has a plain face and no cover.Xiao LIULANG's pretty lips moved, but he didn't make a sound.Just as she would not ask about him, he would not ask her.This is two unrelated people, there is no need to have a deeper involvement.Steamed bread with white flour has no flavor, but Gu Jiao is hungry all day, so she is not picky about it.Gu Jiao choked and went back to her room to drink. When she got back to the kitchen, Xiao LIULANG was no longer there. There was a bag of things on the small bench.Gu Jiao opens it.It's sweet scented osmanthus cake.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: 9In the twinkling of an eye, it's Xiao LIULANG's exam day.Gu Jiao got up early in the morning, made noodles, steamed a cage of porcelain steamed bread, and cooked a pot of wild mushroom soup.Wild mushrooms were picked up in the mountains. The first time they were picked up had been finished. These were newly picked up in the mountains yesterday. There are still many left. She plans to carry them to the market later.In fact, she also picked Auricularia, but fresh Auricularia is poisonous and must be dried before it can be eaten.While waiting for dinner, she went back to the room and took the medicine.The wounds on her wrist and back of her head are all right, and the medicine is almost finished. The ointment is more effective, and more than half of it is left.On the other side, Xiao LIULANG also got up.Gu Jiao knew that he was studying late last night, but she didn't disturb him in the morning. Unexpectedly, he was still so early.Gu Jiao set the dishes and gave him half a bowl of wild mushroom soup. It's because he's worried that when he goes into the examination room to look for the toilet, it's not full.But I don't know if it's Gu Jiao's illusion. I always feel that Xiao LIULANG's little eyes are a little resentful.The exam lasted all day, and Gu Jiao filled it with steamed bread and water.Pause for a while, do not know what to think of, she put ten coppers into the burden.Xiao LIULANG looked at her action of stuffing the copper plate. His eyes moved and he didn't speak.Gu Jiao handed him the loaded baggage: \"I've paid for the car, and I've said hello. I'll send you directly to the Academy.\"\"Well.\" Xiao LIULANG answered, took the bag and walked out of the door with a crutch.Gu Jiao looked at his little limp and resisted the idea of sending him to the village. I don't think he'll like it either.When Xiao LIULANG arrived at the entrance of the village, uncle Luo's ox cart had already stopped under the locust tree, and many people were sitting there. They were all villagers who took their own vegetables and eggs to sell in the town.When the villagers saw him, they all laughed and snored at him.Xiao LIULANG is a scholar. He looks cold on weekdays, but he doesn't have much airs. Anyone who wants to read a letter or answer a letter will come to him. Although Gu Dashun was also a scholar, he stayed in a private school during the day and went home to study hard at night. The villagers seldom bothered him.There is a last seat on the bullock cart, which should be reserved for him.Xiao LIULANG was just about to go up, when he felt a shadow passing by and blocked in front of him.The other side holds down the ox cart with one hand and holds another figure behind him with the other: \"Shun Zi, go up quickly!\"It is the mother and son of the Zhou family.The Zhou family blocked Xiao LIULANG from getting on the ox cart.On the ox cart, an old lady said: 'shunzi, his mother, is LIULANG first.\"Gu Dashun stopped when he got on the cart.He turned his head and looked over his mother to see Xiao LIULANG.Xiao LIULANG's eyes were cold and his expression was indifferent.\"I'm going to have an exam,\" Chou snorted! He came first. What happened? Coming first will delay my shunzi exam? \"People in the village all know that Gu Dashun is a promising man. He was admitted to the county school a while ago, but he was a scholar. I heard that he didn't have to kneel down to salute when he met the county master.Although Xiao LIULANG is a good guy, his future is not as important as Gu Dashun's.If Gu Dashun develops, he will not only honor his family, but also the whole Qingquan village.Everyone is silent.\"That...\" Luo Er Shu said, \"LIULANG, he... Also went to the exam.\"When Gu Jiao came to see Luo Er Shu last night, she made it clear to Luo Er Shu that Xiao Liu Lang was going to take an examination in an academy. Xiao Liu Lang was not good enough, so she told him to send people to the school. For this reason, he was given two more coppers.Luo Er Shu is very puzzled, and Xiao LIULANG doesn't deal with the little fool who cares for his family. He seems to have changed his mind when he talks and does things.But before he could ask more, Gu Jiao left.Hearing that Xiao LIULANG also went to take the exam, Zhou didn't feel at ease. Can Xiao LIULANG's exam compare with her son's?But Gu Dashun looked at Xiao LIULANG in amazement: \"are you going to Tianxiang academy, too?\"\"Well.\" Xiao LIULANG answered lightly.Xiao LIULANG was already a child when he first came to the village. Gu Dashun was also a child at that time. Later, Gu Dashun was admitted as a scholar. Xiao LIULANG was still a child, so Gu Dashun didn't think much of Xiao LIULANG.\"You haven't been to private school for half a year...\" Gu Dashun shook his head.It's obvious that Xiao LIULANG can't pass the exam at all.Luo Er Shu, who had planned to persuade some villagers to give Xiao Liu Lang a seat, quietly choked his words back.Since I can't pass the exam, I don't have to worry about it.Uncle Luo gave his money.There are two coppers to go to the market, and there are three coppers in a little place. Gu Jiao gave two more coppers, a total of five coppers.Uncle Luo counts the coppers and returns them to Xiao LIULANG. Gu Dashun is pushed onto the ox cart by Zhou.But before he sat down, a thin hand suddenly stretched out from his back, grabbed his back collar and pulled him down from the cart!Gu Dashun is two years older than Xiao LIULANG. He is nineteen this year. He is a solid young man. However, he was dragged to the ground and nearly fell to the ground.Zhou was so scared that he rushed to help Gu Dashun.\"Who is it?\"She turned back in a fury.Then I saw Gu Jiao with everyone.Gu Jiao's eyes were cold, with an uninhibited chill.Everyone was stunned.\"Gu Jiao, what are you crazy about?\" Who is Zhou's so bold, but it turned out to be this little fool.\"Take back the copper.\" Gu Jiao didn't pay attention to Zhou at all. She just looked at Luo Er Shu, who was stiff in the air. She frowned impatiently. \"I decided the ox cart last night. If you want to go back, you can refund everyone's car money.\"\"What do you mean?\" Asked Zhou.\"Literally, Xiao LIULANG can't get on the ox cart today, so no one is allowed to get on the ox cart.\" Gu Jiao said.\"What are you doing?\" Snorted an aunt.Gu Jiao slowly took out the sickle from behind: \"just because I'm a fool?\"Everyone turned white when they saw the knife.Zhou, who wants to rush up and pull Gu Jiao's hair, is too scared to go forward.Fool... Fool can do anything.But a fool didn't like to see Xiao LIULANG before. Why can't he get along with his family members?Not to mention the villagers' doubts, even Xiao LIULANG's eyes flitted a trace of consternation.\"If you want to go, please go quickly.\" Gu Jiao said, blowing the sickle which was polished by herself.Zhou really wants to go.He was stopped by Gu Dashun.It doesn't make sense to reason with a fool. It's not good to delay the exam.Although, Xiao LIULANG will miss the exam, but Xiao LIULANG could not pass the exam, Miss also missed, he is not the same.Finally, uncle Luo thought of a way to let Zhou buy one of the villagers' dishes, and the villagers gave the seat to Gu Dashun.Gu Jiao doesn't care whose seat Gu Dashun bought.However, in order to prevent accidents on the way, Gu Jiao carries a sickle with her.There is no spare seat for her.She dragged a thin little body, Leng is walking more than ten miles, will Xiao LIULANG Enron into the examination room.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: 10After Xiao LIULANG entered the examination room, Gu Jiao left with her basket on her back.She is going to the market to sell the wild mushrooms and dried agaric in the basket, and do something else along the way.Tianxiang academy is famous for its many people who have come to the examination. There are local and Xiao Liulang's registered residence.Each reference person has a recommendation letter from a village school, a county school or a government school in his hand and enters the corresponding examination room.Due to different levels, Xiao LIULANG and Gu Dashun were divided into different examination rooms.Xiao LIULANG is in the last row.Tianxiang academy has a high level. Generally speaking, at least scholars come to study. It's not easy to be a scholar these days. For example, Gu Dashun's entrance examination is commendable when he is less than 20 years old.Xiao LIULANG is only seventeen, the youngest of all the candidates.He is also the most handsome one.Unfortunately, he was lame.Many examinees have cast strange eyes, but not for long, they began to fill in the examination paper.In the morning, poetry and Fu are examined, and in the afternoon, classics and meanings are examined.Most of the examinees who can come here have ink in their stomachs. It's not difficult for them to write some poems on the spot. What's difficult is the Scriptures in the afternoon.The titles of the classics are all from the original texts of the four books and five classics. Candidates must strictly use the eight part essay.The eight part essay consists of eight parts: breaking the title, undertaking the title, starting, starting, starting, middle, back and binding. Metaphor is not allowed. The tone of sage must be used. The annotation can only come from Cheng Zhu school, which limits the examinees greatly.In addition, this time the topic is very difficult, one day after the exam, the faces of candidates almost all become green.When Xiao LIULANG came out, his classmates had been waiting outside the examination room for half an hour.\"LIULANG! Here He waved to Xiao LIULANG.Xiao LIULANG walked past with a stick.The classmate said: \"I just heard many people complain that the title of Jingyi is tricky. Alas, it's also your bad luck. This time, the title was written by the Dean himself. If you didn't have an accident at the beginning, you wouldn't have to be so difficult to take the exam with me... It's all the fault of that wicked woman! \"Xiao LIULANG glanced at him and frowned.The classmate then said, \"by the way, she hasn't bullied you these days, has she? I'm so worried that you can't come today. \"It's true... I almost couldn't come.Xiao LIULANG stopped.Suddenly, not knowing what he felt, he raised his head and looked ahead.At this moment, just after the examination, the street at the entrance of the college was full of people.A thin little figure, carrying a small basket, arms, leaning against the wall, some casual.From time to time someone passed by, because her face cast all kinds of eyes at her, but she did not care, not angry, not angry, not shy, not embarrassed.Soon, the classmate also saw Gu Jiao, eyebrow is a frown: \"ah! Why is she here? I don't want to trouble you! To be honest, did you escape from home today? \"In fact, Xiao LIULANG is not sure if Gu Jiao is coming to him. He only knows that she is leaning against him. She looks like waiting for someoneProbably out of the candidates, and finally attracted the attention of Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao turned her head and looked this way. In the sea of people, she saw the young man with a clear posture.With a little smile, she went to Xiao LIULANG.\"It's over.\" She said.\"Well.\" Xiao LIULANG nodded, \"wait a long time?\"\"Neither.\" Gu Jiao pulled a small ear way.\"Didn't you go to the fair? Why didn't you go home? \" Xiao LIULANG saw that she had fungus and wild mushroom in her basket and knew that she would go to the market. But the market is closed at noon at most.\"It happened to be nearby. Something happened.\" Gu Jiao said.\"What can I do for you?\" The classmate rolled his eyes.However, Gu Jiao's words reminded him.After class early today, he went to the hospital and found that Doctor Zhang had come again and saved a dying man.\"Are you sure it's Dr. Zhang?\" Xiao LIULANG was slightly surprised.Last time, Doctor Zhang also suffered from skin injury. In fact, it wasn't Dr. Zhang who killed the family members of the murderer. He was completely involved, but he was provoked after all. He put down his cruel words and won't come in his life.\"Of course! I saw with my own eyes that the man was carried in. He was covered with blood, his neck was crooked, and his anger was gone. Besides Doctor Zhang from the capital, who else can save him? \"Gu Jiao silently looked at the little ants on the ground and did not speak.The classmate then said, \"Dr. Zhang can even save your leg like that. He must be able to cure it. You don't have to worry about all this. I'll ask when Dr. Zhang goes out for a visit. \"\"When are you going?\" Gu Jiao suddenly opens her mouth.The classmate looked at her contemptuously: \"why do I tell you?\"Gu JiaoThe dinner was eaten in the town. My classmate insisted on taking Xiao LIULANG to taste the Yangchun noodles near the Academy, saying it had the flavor of hometown.After dinner, Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao return to the village in a mule cart. This time, Xiao LIULANG asked for a car with a carriage.Night fell completely, there was no oil lamp in the car, but the bright moonlight came in.Gu Jiao sat opposite Xiao LIULANG, stretching her long legs and stretching her toes.She bought new shoes.It's not embroidered shoes worn by a large family. It's just a pair of low-cost cloth shoes. The pure black vamp has no extra color, but it looks good on her feet unexpectedly.She is clever in playing with her shoes. Her eyes are like broken stars.The mule cart was still parked at the entrance of the village.After two people get off, Gu Jiao also is still following him not far not near place to walk.The story of Gu Jiao's turning over for Xiao LIULANG and Gu Dashun has been spread all over the village. Xue Ningxiang specially guards at the door. As a result, they see each other coming from the night.Wasn't it her last time?Are these two really good?\"Gu fool!\"A voice broke the silence around, Xue Ningxiang turned back to the house.Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG stop outside their house and look at the guy who is rushing towards them. It's Gu Ershun from the second room of Gu family.Gu Ershun and Gu Xiaoshun were born by the Liu family, but Gu Ershun has always been closer to Gu Dashun than his brother.Gu Jiao only glanced faintly, then turned her eyes away, opened the lock, and entered the room with Xiao LIULANG.Gu Ershun came over with a big stride, stood at the door with his waist akimbo, and said angrily: \"Gu fool, I think you are turning the sky, dare to do this to big brother! Do you know you almost delayed my brother's exam! In front of all the people in the village, I have no faceDon't listen, don't listen.Gu Jiao crossed the threshold and was about to close the door.Gu Ershun was angry when he saw that she ignored him. He stepped into the room with one foot and propped up the door with the other hand? Grandfather asked me to come to you! You get over there and kowtow to big brother! Or I'll shoot you! \"Gu Jiao pulled her little ear impatiently.I'm sorry.\"Do you hear me? If you don't make it clear today, you won't be able to... \"He's halfway through.Gu Jiao raised her foot and flew him out!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: 11Gu Ershun was directly kicked by Gu Jiao.Although his status in Gu family is not as good as Gu Dashun's, Liu's family grew up in the end. On weekdays, he was reluctant to ask him to do farm work, and only let him study in the house like Gu Dashun.Only God knows if he wants to read it or not, but his delicate body is true.He lay on the ground and didn't move for a long time.What's this little fool doing today? How dare you kick him? He really wants to rush up to give her a slap in the face, but he won't admit that Gu Jiao's foot scared him.\"You... You wait for me!\" He put down his cruel words and ran away covering his stomach.Gu Jiao put the bolt on the door and turned to enter the room. She saw Xiao LIULANG standing in the main room looking at her. Her eyes were full of looking at her.She thought about it and said calmly, \"he fell out on his own.\"Xiao LIULANGGu's family was waiting for Gu Ershun to bring Gu Jiao to lecture, but only Gu Ershun came back, covered his stomach with a disheartened face, as if he had been beaten by someone.Liu quickly stepped forward: \"Er Shun, what's the matter with you? What about the girl? \"Gu Ershun embellished what happened in front of Gu Jiao's door: \"I kindly advised her to come and make it clear and apologize to my elder brother. She didn't listen and kicked me. I didn't fight back when I took her as my younger sister...\"On hearing this, Liu's scalp exploded: \"little cheap hoof! Whores! Even my brother is on foot! \"In contrast, Zhou is much more calm.The girl even dares to start Dashun, not to mention a Ershun?But in the heart after all is some doubts, this wench recently a little unusual.\"That's ridiculous!\" Liu was angry, but his son was beaten. He rolled up his sleeve and slapped Gu Xiaoshun, \"go! Teach that hoof a lesson! Take it out on your brother\"I'm not going.\" Gu Xiaoshun white Gu Ershun a look, \"who knows what he did?\"Gu Ershun said: \"I didn't do anything! I'll talk to her! Who knows she's on the foot, I think she's a fool, a lunatic, a bereaved star\"Who do you scold?\" Gu Xiaoshun got up with a ruffian.Gu Ershun quickly hid behind Liu.\"You're still talking for the little bereaved star! Who is your brother! \" Liu was so angry that she wanted to beat Gu Xiaoshun, but Gu was there. She didn't dare to beat his grandson.She turned her head and winked at her man: \"you've got to say something!\"What does Gu Changlu dare to say? When the girl didn't come to dinner for a few days, no one asked her. Now she knows how to start a crime.He didn't want to go.It's not that much for Gu Jiao's injustice, and he is the weakest of the three brothers. At the beginning of the accident, he was by his side. If he pulled him in time, maybe he didn't have to die.But the flood was so fierce that he was so scared that he left old three behind and ran away.He didn't dare to talk about it, only the old man knew it.He has always been a little guilty about Sanfang.\"Long sea.\" Mr. Gu called his eldest son, \"go over.\"Gu Changhai hesitated for a while, said: \"Dad, Jiao girl's brain doesn't work well, I think it's OK this time, so as not to make a big fuss, let the village people gossip, the way is our mean old three's flesh and blood.\"Liu's hair exploded: \"how can you do that? It's not your Dashun that dares to hurt, is it? Didn't you see how Ershun was kicked? \"Gu Ershun covers his stomach wrongly.Little bereaved star's foot is really heavy. He's still in pain at the moment.Mr. Gu was calm and hesitant.Gu Changhai said in a low voice: \"Dad, it's very noisy. It's not good for Dashun's reputation.\"After all, Gu Ershun, not Gu Dashun, got the kick. Gu Dashun was just pushed by Gu Jiao in front of the crowd, some of them had no face. But Gu Dashun didn't get hurt, and he didn't delay the exam, so he didn't have to worry about his good reputation.Gu Dashun also reflected that scholars value reputation most, otherwise at the beginning, Gu family could not have forced Xiao LIULANG to submit. He could not have been confused about it.He said mildly, \"forget it, Grandpa, my sister is sick. It seems that we have to pay no attention to her.\"Liu Shi was angry and fell back. Why didn't he say that earlier? I don't care. You stopped Ershun when he went to catch her!Gu was obviously satisfied with his eldest grandson's words: \"you are a sensible man. Learn more from your elder brother. Don't worry about a girl all the time. You'll lose your elder brother status. \"The last few sentences are naturally to Gu Ershun.\"And you, don't go out and make trouble if you have nothing to do, which will damage your big brother's reputation.\"Gu Xiaoshun did not escape.Gu Xiaoshun's left ear goes in and right ear goes out.--Gu Jiao did not know that Gu's family had a fight because of herself.She made a small profit in the town today. She bought a lot of things, but also consumed a lot of things. She lost one anesthetic, two clotting agents, and some sutures and other trauma drugs.Gu Jiao took the salt, star anise, fennel and other ingredients to the kitchen, boiled the water by the way, and finally lit a brazier with the firewood in the kitchen.She took the brazier to Xiao LIULANG.It's still very cold at night. She can go to bed early, but Xiao LIULANG has to light the lamp to read a book, and his injured leg can't get cold.The door was open, and Gu Jiao knocked: \"it's me.\"\"Well.\" Xiao LIULANG answered.Gu Jiao pushes the door in.Xiao LIULANG is reading at his desk. He only lights a small oil lamp, and the light is dim.Gu Jiao put the brazier on the ground and went to turn the oil lamp to the brightest. After thinking about it, she took the oil lamp in her room: \"the light is too dark, it hurts her eyes.\"Xiao LIULANG's eyes moved: \"you use the brazier.\"\"I'm not cold when I sleep.\" Gu Jiao said.After a pause, as if thinking of something, he said, \"can you come to your room to bake before going to bed?\"\"... well.\" Xiao LIULANG nodded, sat upright, and continued to copy the book at hand.Gu Jiao knew that he made money by copying books for others. Although she didn't make much money, she had a small couple in January, so she wanted to take one or two from him. It's called \"public grain for the original owner\".The original owner didn't know that he had paid for the meal at home, and he was really good to himself.To be fair, Xiao LIULANG's attitude to the original owner is not good, and this is also because of their bad relationship, not Xiao LIULANG's bad character.Gu Jiao paused and said, \"you don't have to give any more money to Gu's family. I'll eat it at home in the future.\"Xiao LIULANG gave a hand to his pen.Gu Jiao baked the underdried mattress and clothes.Her movements are very light and her breath is very quiet. If Xiao LIULANG hadn't seen her several times with his spare light, he would not have felt that there was one more person in the room.Clothes baked, before leaving, she suddenly said to him: \"by the way, what's your classmate's name?\"\"Feng Lin.\" Xiao LIULANG said.When Xiao LIULANG got up in the middle of the night, he found that Gu Jiao had baked his clothes and stacked them neatly on the chair.He picked up his clothes and tried to put them in the cupboard, but at the bottom he saw a new pair of shoes.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: 12Since she lost her nightlife, Gu Jiao got up earlier than chicken every day.Before dawn, she carried the bucket out of the door.She came to the ancient well at the entrance of the village to draw water.The villagers got up early. Now several aunts and daughters-in-law were drawing water by the ancient well. When they saw her, they were all shocked.Gu Jiao's big trouble with the bullock cart is very popular in the village. Everyone knows that she pulled Gu Dashun off the bullock cart. In the end is a fool ah, make the disease from home, cousins are hurt.ButWhat's the matter with her coming here so early to carry the water?The little fool never does any work. He sleeps until three hours a day.Gu Jiao ignored the people's eyes and came to the ancient well lightly. She put the bucket down and filled it with water and carried it home with a shoulder pole.Until she went far away, all the people suddenly recovered.Are they dazzled? Just now the little fool looked not silly at all, and she was so good-looking when she was drawing water and walking.Gu Jiao took water and steamed a cage of steamed buns.Yesterday, I bought a piece of bacon, which was soaked in water before I went to sleep. The extra salty flavor was soaked out, but the flavor of bacon was preserved just right.The smell of big meat buns wafted out, and the dogs next door cried greedily.Gu Jiao took two steamed buns up the mountain.She had almost collected the fungus, and there were many wild mushrooms.In fact, villagers can also see these ingredients when they go to the mountains to cut firewood, but most people are afraid to pick them. First, they can't distinguish poisonous mushrooms. Second, they don't know if they can get rid of the poison of fresh agaric.Gu Jiao went to the market after picking mushrooms.Zhendong is a rich and prosperous area. The best hospitals and restaurants are there, and so are Yamen and academy. In contrast, the west of the town is much more complicated. There are markets, workshops, gambling houses, kilns and so on.Gu Jiao came to the market and set up a stall in an open space.The aunt next to her remembered her and gave her a smile: \"you're here. Do you have any mushrooms you picked last time? My eldest grandson likes it. Can I have some more? \"My aunt sells sweet potatoes. The price of sweet potatoes is different from that of mushrooms on the mountain. However, Gu Jiao didn't care. She handed her the basket and let her take it by herself.My aunt grabbed two and put in two big and red sweet potatoes for her.After a while, the woman on the other side also came and said with a smile, \"I... can I exchange some radishes with you? I want to make some stew for my family, too. \"\"Well.\" Gu jiaohun doesn't care about nodding and gesturing to do it herself with her eyes.So she exchanged her two turnips for Gu Jiao's two mushrooms.After that, a few vendors came to buy Gu Jiao's mushrooms with their own dishes.This scene, was diagonally opposite the two men in the teahouse panoramic view.\"Shopkeeper Wang, are you talking about her?\" The questioner was a man in his early thirties, with strong features and tall stature.A middle-aged man in his 40s said, \"if you go back to the second owner, it's her.\"The second owner looked at Gu Jiao and frowned: \"is it stupid for people to exchange such expensive mountain goods for such cheap vegetables? Some people put rotten things in it, and she didn't say it. She's so stupid! \"\"This...\" shopkeeper Wang was speechless.He always thought she was not stupid, she didn't care.\"Are you sure you're right?\" Asked the second owner.\"I was beside her when she rescued the patient. I saw her sew up such a deep and long hole with my own eyes. I won't admit it.\" Shopkeeper Wang said.What shopkeeper Wang didn't say is that he actually met her twice. The first time was in this market, so he knew that she would come here to do business.\"How old is she?\" The second owner frowned, and could not believe that she was the doctor who brought the dying back to life.It's too small, too poor, with a birthmark like that on my face.But shopkeeper Wang won't cheat him.The last medical incident had a great impact. It not only offended Dr. Zhang, but also made the general Hall of the capital very dissatisfied. His position as the second leader was in danger. He urgently needed a doctor who could hold the hand to support the situation.Er Dongjia said, \"go and ask her where her teacher is. I'm willing to pay her a lot of money to attend the clinic.\"This girl's medical skills will never come out of thin air. Inviting her master must be more reliable than inviting her.Shopkeeper Wang thinks this method is feasible, so he turns around to ask. Unexpectedly, just after taking a step, a young man falls down and happens to fall in front of a chicken stall, scaring away all the chickens in the cage.\"Oh! My chicken! My chicken The chicken seller went to catch the chicken in a hurry.The scene was in chaos.Shopkeeper Wang and the second owner's eyes fell on the young man and were stunned.The young man as like as two peas in the chest, cyanosis and shortness of breath appeared almost the same as the symptoms of the patients who died in their hospital, but the situation was more intense and urgent.This is an incurable disease. Even if the doctor from their hospital comes, he can't be cured!At the critical moment, a thin figure came from the crowd, squatted down on one knee in front of the young man, tore open his clothes, and stabbed him down with something on his chest!Everyone take a breath!Is this killing?The next second, Gu Jiao pulled out the core of the puncture needle, and a small stream of air leaked out.The crowd saw that the young man, who was about to suffocate, had his chest shriveled, and immediately recovered his normal breathing.Shopkeeper Wang is silly: 'still... Still want to ask her master?\"\"Ask a fart!\" If there were such a doctor in their hospital, they would not cure the dead.The second owner opened manager Wang decisively, stood up and went to Gu Jiao in person.\"You mean you want me to be a doctor in your hospital?\" Listening to the second owner's words, Gu Jiao looked at the young man.The other side's rib fracture caused a lung tear, which eventually led to pneumothorax. Although the air in the chest was drawn out, it still needs follow-up treatment. Unfortunately, he left alone after he recovered breathing.Gu Jiao took back her sight and asked the second leader, \"which hospital are you?\"The second owner said with a smile, \"in Qingquan Town, we are the only one who can be called a medical school.\"\"Well.\" She touched her chin.The second owner thought that the other party would not easily agree. He was ready for the other party to take Joe, but Gu Jiao said: \"it's just right. I'm going to find you. I can cooperate with Tong Fu Tang, but I said first, I only receive treatment once a month. \"\"Once, once?\" The second owner is stunned, isn't it? Did you agree? You don't want to be a bit of a hypocrite? Raise the price? No, once. She only gets treatment once a month!\"I'm busy.\" Gu Jiao said seriously.Busy selling vegetables?The second owner looked at her basket and the corner of her mouth twitched.To be honest, once he was really dissatisfied, but in business, he was talking about step by step, first entering Tongfutang's door, and then bargaining slowly when he got familiar with it.Er Dongjia said: \"good... Once, once!\"Gu Jiaoding looked at him, as if the next is the point: \"in addition, I have a condition.\"--After class, Feng Lin went to the hospital nonstop.After the medical incident, the business of the hospital was a little bit cold, and the guys were listlessly sorting out the medicinal materials in the lobby.\"Is Dr. Zhang in, please?\" Feng Lin stopped a man and said.\"Doctor Zhang has returned to the capital,\" the man said\"And when will he come again?\" Feng Lin asked politely.\"I don't know.\" The man said.\"Can you ask for me? My friend's leg has been injured for half a year. Only Doctor Zhang can cure him. \" Feng Lin perseveres.He looked at him impatiently: \"to tell you the truth, Dr. Zhang won't come again. If you really want to see him, you can go to the huichuntang in the capital to see him, but his visiting fee is very expensive.\"\"How much?\" Asked Feng Lin.\"Ten Liang.\"\"What? Ten liang? \"Feng Lin was stunned. Even if he added up with Xiao LIULANG, he couldn't get so much silver.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: 13Feng Lin left disappointed. Just as he was about to walk out of the hall, he heard a polite voice in front of him: \"is this young master here to see a doctor?\"\"Ah?\" Feng Lin was stunned for a moment and looked at him. He was a young man in gorgeous clothes. He had a strong air, but his attitude was very gentle.Feng Lin didn't know him: \"you are...\"The guys recognized him and wanted to salute one after another. They were stopped by the second leader's eyes.\"Oh, I'm from rejuvenation hall.\" The second owner said, \"what's wrong with this young master?\"Feng Lin shook his head: \"no, I'm not sick. I'm here for my classmate.\"\"Dare to ask your name.\"My name is Feng Lin Feng Lin arched his hand.\"My name is Hu.\" The second owner returned a gift.\"It's Dr. Hu.\" The other side said that he was a doctor, so Feng Lin naturally took the other side as a doctor here.The second owner didn't correct him. He laughed and said, \"what's wrong with your classmate?\"Feng Lin sighed: \"his leg was injured half a year ago. He went to a lot of doctors, but there was no medicine. I think only Doctor Zhang of the medical school can cure him. But I heard that Doctor Zhang will never come to the hospital again. \"\"Who says he won't come?\" The second owner coughed softly and said, \"he'll come tomorrow.\"\"Diagnosis gold...\"\"Buy it now, 100 Wen!\"Cough!All the guys in the room are choking.Feng Lin choked: \"one hundred Wen?\"\"Is it expensive?\" The second owner blinked and said, \"I'm wrong, it's ten Wen!\"Feng LinGuys, \"...\"No matter how stupid Feng Lin is, he knows that it's very expensive to see a doctor, not to mention Doctor Zhang from the capital. Even a barefoot doctor in the countryside can't be paid ten Wen.\"Doesn't it mean that Dr. Zhang's fee is ten liang?\" He wondered.The second owner's face did not change: \"the in-house clinic is cheaper than the out-patient clinic.\"\"Cheap... So much?\"\"We've done a lot of medicine in our hospital. Business is not good. It's off-season!\"Once again, Feng Lin saidGuys, once again:--Feng Lin immediately went to the village and told Xiao LIULANG about the consultation: \"the consultation fee is only ten Wen, and the herbal medicine fee is calculated separately. Now their business is not good. I guess the herbal medicine fee will not be too expensive.\"It's true that the business of the hospital has been impacted, but it's still unbelievable to say that it's so cheap all of a sudden.Feng Linxing said bluntly, \"I asked manager Wang afterwards, and manager Wang said the same thing. It won't be false. You can wait with ease. At the end of the month, I have a holiday. I'll go with you! \"Even the date has been fixed. It seems to be true.Three days later, the results of the examination came out, and Gu Dashun came in second.This time, there are hundreds of candidates from all over the world, including children from rich families. When they were young, they invited Mr. Gu Dashun to study in a better way than Gu Dashun. In this way, Gu Dashun was able to take the second place in the exam. It was really a shame for the Gu family.In particular, the examination questions were given by the president himself. The academy is passing on. The president is afraid that he will be out of the mountain. He wants to recruit students from this group of candidates.Gu Dashun thinks that he has great hope.\"How was LIULANG's test?\" Mr. Gu asked.Gu Dashun said with a smile: \"he also passed the exam.\"It's also the second, but it's the reciprocal.A total of 100 people were enrolled this time, and Xiao LIULANG ranked in 99.Thinking that Xiao LIULANG had been dumped so far by himself, Gu Dashun was a little proud, but he said: \"he didn't go to private school for half a year, because he was studying hard at home, and he was very successful in the exam.\"\"He studied hard for such a long time, and he almost failed in the exam. It can be seen that studying is about talent. You are much better than LIULANG in this point.\" It's rare for Mr. Gu to say so much. Originally, he didn't dare to have too much expectations for Gu Dashun, but now his achievements have come out. He thinks that Gu Dashun's future in autumn next year is secure.Mr. Gu was very happy and asked his second son to go to town and cut two Jin of pork.Today, it's second room's turn to cook. Liu knows that most of the streaky pork he brings out will go into Gu Dashun's stomach and stealthily touches and hides two pieces in the jar.\"Niang, you hide meat!\"Gu Xiaoshun came in with sharp eyes.Liu shivered and nearly knocked over the jar. She turned around and hit Gu Xiaoshun: \"keep your voice down! What are you yelling atGu Xiaoshun said: \"I want to eat meat.\"\"No!\" Liu turned his back to protect the jar tightly.Gu Xiaoshun snorted: \"if you don't give it to me, Tell ye Nai that you hide meat!\"\"You...\" Liu raised her fist in anger. She was happy to have a son. She was angry to have a son by herself.Liu also knew that Gu Xiaoshun could really do something to poke her out. He opened the jar with pain and took a knife to cut a small piece for him.Before Gu Xiaoshun could taste it, he said, \"why give me half a mouthful? There are two big pieces in the jar\"That's for ER Shun!\" Among the two sons, Ershun is the only one willing to study. Liu hopes Ershun will be promising in the future, so that she can follow Ershun. She can't count on Xiaoshun any more. If she doesn't come to be a loser in the future, she will be Amitabha.Gu Xiaoshun wanted to deliver some meat to his sister, but he couldn't really grab his mother's pot. He had to take advantage of his mother's inattention, lift the lid of the pot, grab some white steamed bread and run away!\"Little beast!\" Liu's hair is fried.Steamed bread with white flour is also a good thing. On weekdays, only Gu Dashun can eat it. They all eat noodles with sticks.Liu was so angry that he picked up a stick and chased him back. However, Gu Xiaoshun ran so fast that he disappeared.Gu Xiaoshun ran to his elder sister and his hands were red with steamed bread.\"Sister!\" He rushed into the kitchen, but suddenly smelled something, and the whole person was settled.He sniffed: \"it smells good, sister. What are you cooking?\"\"Pheasant.\"She sold two of the last three pheasants, and the remaining one was raised for several days before she killed them today.\"What do you have?\" Gu Jiao looks at his hand.\"Steamed bread.\" Gu Xiaoshun drooped his head and wanted to give her something delicious. Who ever thought that her sister would eat chicken here, and these white flour steamed buns were a little weak for a momentGu Jiao took a bowl and asked him to put the steamed bread in. Then she put a basin of cold water in it and said, \"hand, put it in.\"\"Oh.\" Gu Xiaoshun did not ask why, obediently did, hand a bubble in the water does not hurt.\"Eat here.\" Gu Jiao said to him again.\"Well?\" Gu Xiaoshun was stunned.\"I left a bowl for you. I'm thinking about how to send it. If you come, I won't have to go there.\" Gu Jiao said as she opened the cupboard, took out a bowl of chicken and poured it into the pot again.Looking at the bowl of chicken, Gu Xiaoshun knew that her sister didn't say the words just because he came. She really left them for him.There was a whole big chicken leg in it, and he saw it all.Gu Xiaoshun's nose is suddenly a little sour.He came to Gu Jiao's back, bent down, put his forehead on Gu Jiao's back and said, \"elder sister, how can you be so good? Do you think you are actually my motherGu JiaoPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: 14Gu Jiao finally understood why the original owner and Gu Xiaoshun were able to play together. Their intelligence quotient is basically the same level.Today, Gu Jiao is stewing mushrooms with pheasant. Although pheasant tastes delicious, its meat is firmer than poultry. She stewed it in a big iron pot for two hours.She also made a refreshing cold agaric, white radish sauce, staple food is white rice and corn flour cake baked on the iron pot.Although Xiao LIULANG only got a countdown, Gu Jiao still attached great importance to it, so she killed all the chickens for Xiao LIULANG to celebrate. It's just that she doesn't talk about it.\"Call your brother-in-law to dinner.\" She took off the baked cake and asked Gu Xiaoshun.\"Ah Gu Xiaoshun went with a jerk.Xiao LIULANG has just finished copying a book.Some excellent examinees will be borrowed by bookstores after they have been admitted to Juren or Jinshi. They will be sold to other examinees after copying. This kind of book is more expensive than ordinary books, but there are still many candidates flocking to it.Xiao LIULANG's handwriting is pleasing to the eye. The books he copied sell best.\"Brother in law! Eat Gu Xiaoshun poked a small head through the crack of the door.It's good to be cheeky. It's clear that I bullied people a few days ago. Now I'm as intimate as that.Xiao LIULANG's look was as cool as ever. He was not surprised by Gu Xiaoshun's change of attitude. Of course, he didn't throw Gu Xiaoshun's face with Gu Xiaoshun's past ignorance.Gu Xiaoshun suddenly raised his hand, and he was quite comfortable with his brother-in-law.The three sat down to eat.Gu Xiaoshun first took a piece of mushroom. Impression, his sister is not cooking, so he is the first time to taste his sister's craft, did not expect so delicious!He had another piece of chicken.My God!It's so delicious that he's going to cry!Gu Jiao scooped out two big chicken legs, one for Xiao LIULANG and one for Gu Xiaoshun.Chicken drumsticks are also stewed, full of gravy, a bite down, Gu Xiaoshun feel to ascend to heaven.Xiao LIULANG is very calm.But if Gu Jiao knew how much he used to eat, she would not think so.They soon finished a bowl of rice. Gu Xiaoshun went to serve the rice. He saw that Xiao LIULANG's bowl was empty, so he said, \"brother-in-law, I'll serve you a bowl, too!\"\"Well.\" Xiao did not refuse.I don't know whether I didn't refuse his kindness or my brother-in-law.Gu Xiaoshun went to serve the meal.This is the most comfortable meal Gu Xiaoshun has ever had. It tastes good and the atmosphere on the table is good. Although his sister and brother-in-law do not speak, but he can speak! All three of them had a good time!After dinner, Xiao LIULANG helps Gu Jiao clean up the dishes and chopsticks, and Gu Xiaoshun goes to the backyard to chop firewood.After entering the kitchen, Xiao LIULANG suddenly put a purse in Gu Jiao's hand.Gu Jiao looked at him strangely.\"Home.\" He said.Xiao LIULANG gave Gu Jiao two liang of silver, which he earned by copying books for more than a month. He had only ten copper coins left on him. However, the book he has is almost finished. In two days, he should be able to take it to the town for money.Gu Jiao picked eyebrows to see the money bag on the stove and took it.After cleaning up the kitchen, Gu Jiao went to fetch water at the entrance of the village. Gu Xiaoshun grabbed her shoulder pole: \"elder sister, you rest. I'll do this kind of rough work!\"He picked up the shoulder pole and left. Gu Jiao didn't stop him.At this moment, everyone is eating in the room, and no one comes out to draw water. He has occupied the ancient well by himself, and is pumping water. Two powerful men run this way and stop beside Gu Xiaoshun without saying a word.They turned over and dismounted.Gu Xiaoshun felt a fierce murderous atmosphere.He is a villain in the village. At the moment, he can see that the other party has practiced martial arts. All the villains in all the villages are not rivals to any of them.\"Are you from this village?\" Asked one of the strong men.\"Er... Yes, what can I do for you?\" Gu Xiaoshun asked stupidly.\"We're looking for people!\" The strong man flashed out a broken umbrella and asked fiercely, \"have you seen this umbrella?\"Why not? That's his sister's umbrella!Gu Xiaoshun is a bad person.\"You've seen it, haven't you?\" The strong man squinted dangerously.\"I... I...\" Gu Xiaoshun stuttered. What did his sister do? How could such a terrible person come to her?\"Boy.\" The strong man reached out his big hand and gently pressed Gu Xiaoshun's shoulder. \"I advise you to tell the truth, or I'll ask someone else...\"This man is so strong that half of his body can't move!Gu Xiaoshun clenched his teeth: \"it's mine!\"The strong man was stunned.He exchanged a look with his companion.The strong man took back his hand and asked suspiciously, \"your umbrella? Are you sure? \"Gu Xiaoshun's legs and stomach actually began to soften, but he said stubbornly: \"I'm sure of my own umbrella! There is a mark on the handle of the umbrella. It says 'small\". I carved it myself! \"The last few sentences are true. He was bored. He carved his name on the handle of his sister's fan, but he could only write a small word.Of course, the strong men knew that there was a word on the handle of the umbrella, so they believed most of his words.\"So it was you who went to Houshan that day?\"\"It's me!\"\"Is it you who stepped on our master's face?\"\"... yes!\"\"You did our master's arm?\"\"... yes! All of them\"You pricked the buttocks, too?\"Gu Xiaoshun almost fell down. Elder sister, my elder sister, what's the matter with you running to stab people's buttocks?Gu Xiaoshun took a deep breath and closed his eyes: \"yes! All of them! If you don't believe it, just ask, who else can do such a thing besides me, Gu XiaoshunGu Xiaoshun felt that he was going to be beaten to death here today, but the pain in his imagination didn't come. He opened his eyes carefully and saw that the two strong men took a big step back and bowed to him deeply!\"My Lord! We found you at lastGu Xiaoshun\"Sister! Sister Gu Xiaoshun reincarnated like ran into the kitchen, \"I seem to be in trouble!\"\"Keep your voice down, your brother-in-law is studying.\" Gu Jiao made a hissing gesture at him.Gu Xiaoshun cried and told Gu Jiao all about the village: 'sister, what should we do now? What kind of benefactor? Did they mistake me? \"\"So it is.\" Gu Jiao thought of that day in the mountains, nodded thoughtfully, \"you did not ask who they are?\"Gu Xiaoshun drooped his head: \"I forgot to ask.\"\"Have they gone yet?\" Gu Jiao said.\"Not yet.\" Gu Xiaoshun cried.Gu Jiao put down the broom: \"OK, you wait for me here.\"\"Sister, don't go!\" Gu Xiaoshun holds her.\"Nothing.\" Gu Jiao smiles and goes towards the entrance of the village.Gu Xiaoshun didn't know what his sister and the two said. In a word, they left obediently.At dawn the next day, a carriage drove into the village and stopped outside the gate of Gu's house.A refined middle-aged man came down from the carriage.Today is the big room cooking, Zhou and Zhou Yuee got up early.As soon as she opened the door, she saw a middle-aged man who was about to knock on their door and the carriage behind him.Zhou yue'e had never seen this posture, and she was stunned.The middle-aged man said kindly, \"excuse me, is this Gu Lizheng's home?\"Zhou Yuee turned and ran into the room! Someone's looking for grandpa! \"Gu Changhai came out.Gu Changhai is the eldest son of Mr. Gu. He occasionally follows Mr. Gu to the Yamen. He is more knowledgeable than most people in the village.The other side is not small at a glance.Gu changhaike said, \"my father is washing. Are you...\"The middle-aged man arched his hand and said with a smile, \"I'm the steward of Tianxiang Academy. Today I've come to deliver the enrollment documents to Mr. Gu.\"Didn't you go to town to get all the entrance documents by yourself? Could you please send it in person?Did Dashun really do well in the exam?Gu Changhai felt that his waist was more straight. He rushed to the room with pride and said, \"Dashun, the academy has sent you the learning documents!\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: 15Gu Dashun's book can read so well, in addition to the brain is really smart, diligence is inevitable.He got up earlier than Zhou and Gu Yuee. Now he was studying in his room. When he heard his father call him, he put down his book and came out: \"Dad, what's the matter?\"As soon as the voice fell, he saw the middle-aged man outside the door.He felt vaguely familiar with each other's face, but he couldn't remember where he had met. But what is certain is that the other party's dress bearing is extraordinary, I don't know what to do when they visit their home.\"Dad, what did you just say? I'm studying. I can't hear you He turned to Gu Changhai.Gu Changhai pointed to the middle-aged man and said with a smile: \"this is the steward of Tianxiang Academy. He has come to send you the learning documents!\"\"Entrance documents?\" Gu Dashun had the same doubts as Gu Changhai. The Academy had already informed him. After the examination, he got his grades three days later and went to the east gate of the academy to collect the entrance and exit documents seven days later.It's still three days away from seven days. Why did you come out? And delivered it to the door in person?Now the middle-aged man also responded and said with a smile: \"there is another candidate in your house, but Mr. Gu is afraid of some misunderstanding. The document in my hand is not for this candidate, but for another Mr. Gu.\"Gu Changhai oddly said: \"our family only Dashun is the examinee.\"The middle-aged man always kept a decent smile: \"I just said I don't understand. Excuse me, is Mr. Gu Xiaoshun here?\"The father and son were confused.Gu Changhai recovered his voice after a long time: \"you... Are you wrong? Gu Xiaoshun didn't take the exam. \"Gu Xiaoshun is a shrew! Rascal! I won't take the exam in my life!I won't be able to pass the exam!The middle-aged man said with a smile: \"I'm not mistaken, it's Gu Xiaoshun. It's recommended by my master himself. It's entrance free. \"Gu Changlu, who had just got up, heard his son's name and came up to him and said, \"what's the matter with Xiaoshun? Is he in trouble again? Son of a bitch! I'm going to hit him nowGu Chang Lu gangqi described it as a real slovenliness, but the middle-aged man's smile did not change at all: \"my master went up the mountain and fell down accidentally. Fortunately, he was rescued by young master Gu. Well, it's settled. I'd like to trouble the two masters to give the enrollment documents to Mr. Gu, and I'll enter the school in four days. \"\"Our family can't afford to pay two bunches!\" Gu Changhai suddenly opened his mouth.Gu Changlu is still in the cloud and fog. He doesn't understand what happened.The middle-aged man looked at Gu Dashun and Gu Changhai. This time, his eyes did not smile: \"it's written in the document, and the repair is free. In addition, I have the books and hospital clothes ready. Please hand them over to Mr. Gu.\"His father and second uncle didn't pay attention, but Gu Dashun did. The other party called him \"the examinee\", but Gu Xiaoshun always called him \"young master Gu\".Moreover, he came second in the exam, but the other party didn't know it was his family.Gu Dashun's face is not good-looking.He wanted to ask each other and the master's identity in detail, but the middle-aged man gave Gu Changlu a mahogany brocade box and left in the carriage.Gu Changlu couldn't get back to him: \"big brother, does that man... Mean Xiaoshun... Can go to school?\"At breakfast, the whole family knew about it.\"When did you go up the mountain? Who did you save? Why didn't you tell your family? \" Liu asked several questions in succession.\"I... where do I know? Just... Save it. \" His sister won't let him go out, he can only carry the pot, but he didn't expect the result to be like this, how can he go to school?\"Well, since you don't want to fix it, let Xiaoshun go, so that he won't get into trouble all day.\" Gu Changlu said.\"He's gone. Who does the work in the field?\" Zhou was dissatisfied.No money is no money, but there are few people working in the field. It's them who are tired!Gu Dashun looked at Zhou: \"Niang, it's a good thing to have many scholars at home. I'm off school. I can help with my work. \"\"What can I do for you?\" Zhou's veto, her son is born to read the material, not to dig food in the field!Liu doesn't like to hear this. Her son is a noble person. Is his son cheap? But Gu Xiaoshun is really useless. If Ershun is stopped from studying, Liu will go back.\"It's just that... Xiaoshun's temperament needs to be changed. At least he should be able to sit like Ershun.\" Gu Dashun spoke again.He said this as a matter of public concern, yes, with Gu Xiaoshun's ability to read well? I don't have to offend Mr. Gu. Gu Dashun is implicated.\"Or... Let Er Shun read it?\" Liu asked.Ershun is smarter than Xiaoshun and more disciplined than Xiaoshun. If you let him read it, he will be able to read a scholar back!In fact, Zhou still disagrees. She thinks Ershun is just eager to learn. In fact, several times Dashun gave him lectures, but he didn't learn at all.This is not a piece of reading material, that is, Liu's whimsical, always in two Shun body to do scholar mother's dream.But the men who came home didn't object, so Zhou didn't say anything.In the whole process, no one asked Gu Xiaoshun's opinion.Three days later, Xiao LIULANG and Gu Dashun got the admission documents and uniforms of the Academy.The books were prepared by himself. Gu Xiaoshun knew that he didn't have them, so he specially prepared new ones. But now, it's all Gu Ershun's.Gu Jiao carries a basket on her back and sends Xiao LIULANG to the town.As usual, she sent people to the academy and then went on foot to the market.Xiao LIULANG changed into a brand-new uniform, which Gu Jiao also saw others wear, Feng Lin, and many students from the Academy, but no one like Xiao LIULANG, with a long body, white clothes better than snow, and beautiful eyes.On the whole, the stranger is like jade, and the young master is unique in the world.After a while, Gu Jiao's eyes fell on his feet.When she found that he was wearing the new shoes she bought for him, Gu Jiao bent her lips.\"Does it fit?\" Gu Jiao asked.\"Well.\" Xiao LIULANG nodded lightly.Gu Jiao handed him the crutch and went out with him.When he arrived at the entrance of the village, uncle Luo's ox cart was already waiting. Few people went to the town today, except for the two of them, Gu Dashun and Gu Ershun.Two people also put on the hospital uniform.To be honest, Gu's family is not ugly. Even Gu Dashun is more beautiful than most men in the town. He can go to Xiao LIULANG's side, and he is immediately ruined.If Xiao LIULANG did nothing, he could be like a painting, and his whole body was full of elegant scholarly atmosphere.Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG talk about Gu Xiaoshun's rescue of a related household in the Academy. Therefore, they both know that Gu Xiaoshun should be the one who is going to the Academy today.However, they were not surprised to see Gu Ershun in his obviously smaller hospital uniform on the ox cart, as if they had expected that Gu would do such shameless things.Gu Jiao sneered.Xiao LIULANG grabs his own baggage and finds that Gu Jiao has stuffed him with copper again. This time, it's twenty.\"Hum!\" Gu Ershun gave them a white eye.The ox cart soon arrived near the Academy.\"Stop here and we'll walk by ourselves.\" Gu Dashun.However, Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao sat all the way to the gate of the Academy.After Xiao LIULANG entered the Academy, Gu Jiao went to the market with a basket on her back.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: 16This time, the candidates are divided into four classes. According to their grades, they are Tianzi class A, Tianzi class B, dizi class A and dizi class B.Gu Dashun got the second place in the exam, and naturally entered the class a of Tianzi, while Xiao LIULANG was the penultimate and entered the class B of dizi.As for Gu Xiaoshun, a relative household, he was also assigned to class B.At first, Gu Dashun was still thinking about what great man Gu Xiaoshun had saved, but in the end, he was only in the worst class. It seems that he was not very good at Tianxiang Academy.\"Over there is class B, you can go.\" Gu Dashun pointed out the way to Gu Ershun, then turned and went to class A.Gu Ershun dreamed of going to school like Dashun when he was a child. Now he finally got what he wanted, and he was very happy.However, he was not happy to think that he and Xiao LIULANG were in the same class. Although he didn't know the meaning of Tian Zi a class and Di Zi B class, Xiao LIULANG came second from the bottom in the exam. What kind of class could he go to?Looking back, we have to find the master who was saved by Gu Xiaoshun and ask him to transfer himself to Gu Dashun's class!Gu Ershun naturally thought that he didn't think there was anything wrong with this idea.He looked at the students contemptuously, raised his chin and was about to go in. Suddenly, the teacher in the lecture said, \"who are you?\"Gu Ershun said, \"I'm a new student, Gu Ershun.\"Master Wen Yan no longer looked at him and said, \"where did you come from? There's no one in the class. Get out of here. \"Gu Ershun was stunned.All the students looked at him, and Gu Ershun's face turned red: \"I... I am...\"\"Is Gu Xiaoshun here?\" Master interrupted him.The class is very quiet.\"Has Gu Xiaoshun arrived yet?\" The master asked again.The students began to whisper.Gu Xiaoshun, Gu Ershun, what does it matter to you, but the master didn't even askThe students began to whisper, and when they saw Gu Ershun again, their eyes were more intriguing.Gu Ershun's face can't hang. He turns to find Gu Dashun. He originally expected Gu Dashun to solve the problem for him, but unexpectedly, class A has already started.Gu Ershun had nowhere to go. He was so embarrassed that he wanted to find a hole in the ground.After a class, Gu Dashun was called out by his teacher.\"Mr. Chen.\" Gu Dashun saluted respectfully.Chen Fu Zi thought about it and asked him, \"do you know about your brother's enrollment?\"Gu Dashun nodded: \"I know that a steward of the Academy personally sent my brother's enrollment documents to the village. May I ask... What's the matter?\"Chen Fu Zi frowned: \"Gu Xiaoshun was admitted, but Gu Ershun came. Do you know?\"When Gu Dashun looked at Chen Fu Zi's face, he felt that something was wrong. His eyes flashed and he said, \"I don't know. I left first. Those two are the brothers of the second uncle's family.\"\"I see. You go to class first.\" Chen said.\"Master, my brother, he...\" Gu Dashun looked at Chen, looking a little uneasy.Mr. Chen waved his hand: \"it's OK. It's your second uncle's business. It's none of your business. You have a good class. You did well in the exam this time. The dean is very optimistic about you. \"Gu Dashun went to class.He looked in the direction of the corridor.Gu Ershun is very brave, so he should not talk.\u2026\u2026But after Gu Jiao went to the market, she came directly to the former stall. Everyone seemed to know that she would come here to sell mountain goods, so she reserved the seat for her early.Today, Gu Jiao brought fresh mushrooms and dried black fungus.\"Is this edible? Not toxic? \" The sweet potato vendor asked, holding a piece of black fungus.\"I sell it. I can eat it.\" Gu Jiao said.After exposure and air drying, Auricularia auricula has no tannic acid and porphyrin, and will not cause any toxic reaction.The sweet potato seller's aunt wrote to her: \"can I still exchange sweet potatoes with you?\"Gu Jiao nodded: \"well.\"Most of the black fungus and mushrooms in the basket were exchanged by vendors nearby for vegetables, and the rest were sold to passers-by.Gu Jiao grabs the basket with one hand.So heavy back basket, radish, sweet potato, wax gourd and pumpkin, but she was easily caught.They watched her walk out of the market.Gu Jiao did not return to the village, but went to a gray alley.Xue Ningxiang also came to the market.Her mother-in-law's old cold leg was broken again. She had no money to go to the town's Medical Center, so she had to come to the market to buy some herbs from the barefoot doctor.After buying the medicine, she was about to go back, but she caught a glimpse of a familiar figure.She fixed her eyes on each other to make sure that she was right, which made her more confused.\"How did she come here? Where else have you been? \"It's not a good place to go behind that alley. Xue Ningxiang knows about gambling houses, kilns and black workshopsXue Ningxiang couldn't figure out what Gu Jiao was doing there.Have you been cheated orXue Ningxiang frowned and quickly followed.However, as soon as she passed through the alley, Gu Jiao disappeared. On the opposite side was a large gambling shop. On the left side was a kiln. On the right side, I didn't know what it was. From time to time, shrill screams came out, and some people fell out with bruises and bruises. After that, they vomited blood and fell to the ground and couldn't get up any more.Xue Ningxiang was frightened and turned to go back, but he was blocked in the alley by some ruffian men.\"Oh, where's the little lady? What a handsome man\"No? Play with my brothers for a while? \"While talking, the two men in front stretched out salty pig hands to Xue Ningxiang. Although the latter two didn't start, they also laughed obscenely.Four people came round her and surrounded her.Xue Ningxiang wanted to call, but he was covered by one of the men.It seems that these four people are not the first time to do this kind of thing. They cooperate very well. One person covers her mouth, and the other two hold her up. Then all of them start to attack her.Xue Ningxiang couldn't cry out, couldn't move, and burst into tears of despair!At this time, a few people came back with a cold voice: \"Hey, get out of the way.\"How many people are in the mood, suddenly hear the voice of a woman, secretly a joy, and have sent to the door?But when they turned around, they saw a little girl with red spots on her face.Even if the face is so ugly, the body is still thin, and it doesn't look good.Several people immediately lost the interest of pressing her under the body together, the man who covered Xue Ningxiang's mouth said: \"get out of the way!\"\"I said, get out of the way.\"Her voice was not big, and her tone was careless, but somehow, there was a strange chill in everyone's heart.\"Chi ~\" is still the man who covers Xue Ningxiang's mouth. He laughs scornfully and lets Xue Ningxiang go to Gu Jiao.He hit Gu Jiao with one punch!Xue Ningxiang couldn't bear to close her eyes!Click!\"Ah --\"Fracture sound, scream sound, everyone is a surprise.Gu Jiao didn't give anyone a chance to react. She grabbed the second man's collar and threw it on the wall, knocking people unconscious on the spot.The remaining two rushed at her, but they didn't even touch the corner of her clothes. Then they were kicked by her and couldn't get up.However, at this time, the first man who fell to the ground suddenly struggled to get up, grabbed a brick and patted Gu Jiao on the back of her head\u2014\u2014Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: 17\"Ah --\" Xue Ningxiang screamed.Gu Jiao is spin body a foot, kick that person to fly.Xue Ningxiang is silly. She doesn't understand how Gu Jiao did it!Gu Jiao left with a basket on her back when she finished beating. She didn't even look at Xue Ningxiang. It made people feel that she really did it just because these shameless people got in her way.Xue Ningxiang recovered from his great stupor and stood up: \"you... You wait!\"Gu Jiao goes on.Xue Ningxiang wanted to chase her, but her clothes were torn by the men, so she went out, and her body had to be seen. She burst into tears with anxiety.Gu Jiao's steps stop, some fidgety to dial the sideburns, from the basket to take out their own cotton padded clothes, threw on Xue Ningxiang's body.Xue Ningxiang was stunned. She looked at the cotton padded clothes and Gu Jiao: \"you... Aren't you cold?\"\"Give it to me if you don't wear it.\" Gu Jiao reaches out her hand.\"Wear it! I'll wear it Xue Ningxiang put on the cotton padded clothes in a hurry.Gu Jiao's cotton padded clothes were a little thin, especially in her chest, which made Xue Ningxiang flustered.Xue Ningxiang bent down to pick up the herbs that fell on the ground and whispered to Gu Jiao: \"just... Thank you.\"She really didn't expect to encounter this kind of thing, and didn't expect Gu Jiao to help herself. Her mood was a little complicated, but anyway, the gratitude came from her heart.At this moment, she was sure that Gu Jiao was different from before.\"You... Aren't you stupid?\" She asked cautiously.Gu Jiao didn't answer her.\"Or silly...\" otherwise how can you save yourself? I used to bully her like that.Gu JiaoSuddenly, Xue Ningxiang saw the blood dripping from Gu Jiao's left hand: \"you are injured!\"Gu Jiao light way: \"not my blood.\"She's not lying. It's not her.However, I do not know what to think of, she still took the PA to wipe off the blood.Xue Ningxiang looked back at the four bastards who fell on the ground. He said that they didn't bleed. Where did the blood come from? What the hell did she do just now?They went out of the alley.Gu Jiao looked at the sky.Xue Ningxiang suddenly grabbed her sleeve and looked at her pitifully: \"I... can I go back to the village with you?\"Gu Jiao's small eyebrows frowned slightly.She doesn't go back to the village.Xue Ningxiang thinks that it's reasonable for Gu Jiao to refuse. After all, she has a bad relationship with Gu Jiao. She has done her utmost to save herself in the same village. There's no need to take her back to the village.Xue Ningxiang silently drew back her hand.Gu jiaodan said, \"I want to go to the Academy first.\"Xue Ningxiang eyes a bright, raised his head: \"then I can together?\"Gu Jiao didn't speak.He turned and headed east of town.Xue Ningxiang tentatively followed two steps. Seeing that Gu Jiao didn't catch up with her, she was happy to keep up with her.Xue Ningxiang is wrapped with small feet, and the woman wrapped with small feet walks slowly.Gu Jiao fidgetily grabbed small head, but still can stop to wait for her.When they arrived at the college, the school was just over.Xiao LIULANG came out with a book bag. He was stunned when he saw Gu Jiao in the opposite lane.He walked over with the same look: \"is it nearby today?\"\"Well.\" Gu Jiao answered vaguely.Xue Ningxiang was surprised. From the market to here, at least seven or eight Li, this... This can also be called nearby?At this time, Xiao LIULANG finally saw Xue Ningxiang beside Gu Jiao.There was a trace of surprise in Xiao LIULANG's eyes. He racked his brains to figure out how the two could be together. Besides, Xue Ningxiang was still wearing Gu Jiao's clothes.Uncle Luo's ox cart has been waiting in the alley. He said hello in the morning and asked him to pick it up at you'clock.Three people on the cart, Gu Jiao sitting in the middle of the two.Xue Ningxiang used to have a good feeling for Xiao LIULANG, but that terrible thing happened just now. She was still afraid of men. She didn't even fight with Xiao LIULANG.Xiao LIULANG didn't care about Xue Ningxiang's attitude towards him. He just felt a little strange, but he didn't ask.Gu Jiao's cotton padded jacket was given to Xue Ningxiang. She only had a thin jacket on her body. She didn't feel it was fashionable to go on the road. Once she sat down, she would feel a little cold.Xiao LIULANG looked down at his hospital uniform and couldn't help hesitating. To her, their relationship seems not so good; If you don't give it to her, she'll freeze again. Is hesitating, see Xue Ningxiang weak to Gu Jiao by the side, take their own body to warm Gu Jiao.Xiao LIULANGAfter passing through the alley, the ox cart saw Gu Dashun waiting there.Gu Ershun has been \"banished\" home, so Gu Dashun is the only one waiting for the ox cart.Gu Dashun doesn't care about Xue Ningxiang in the bullock cart, but looks at Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG, who have no wave. Thinking of their calm appearance in the morning, he suddenly feels that they have guessed from the beginning that it will be this result.But without saying anything, they watched Gu Ershun be driven out, which made him almost suspected by the master.Whose idea was it? Xiao LIULANG's? Or this little fool's?Breeze blowing, Gu Jiao gently aside the block in the face of hair, did not mind showing the face of the birthmark.Gu Dashun never saw such a Gu Jiao.No, he did. It was on the morning of the exam. She pulled him down from the bullock cart, and she was so calm at that time. But at that time he was angry and didn't pay attention.What happened to this little fool? All of a sudden, he changed his mind. He didn't come to take care of his family for dinner. He got on well with Xiao LIULANG.\"Are you thirsty?\" Xue Ningxiang releases the water bag around her waist and hands it to Gu Jiao.Even widow Xue, who was always against her, became her friend?Gu Dashun frowned deeply.When the ox cart arrives at the village, Gu Dashun jumps out of the ox cart.Gu Jiao did not grab with him, just sitting on the cart, looking at him with a faint smile: \"remember to send Xiaoshun to school tomorrow.\"Gu Dashun clenched his fist.--After returning home, Gu Jiao felt very cold today. Her hands and feet were cold. At night, she came to sunflower water.The country people are undernourished. Most of the sunflower water comes late. It's 14 years old, so it's the first time to come to sunflower water.I don't know if she had a bad stomachache because of the heavy cold and the wind.She has been in the organization for many years, in fact, she has been used to all kinds of pain, but she can't tolerate the abdominal pain in this physiological period.Xue Ningxiang returned Gu Jiao's clothes to her door. As soon as she entered the room, she found that Gu Jiao was sitting on a chair with a pale face. She immediately asked, \"what's the matter with you?\"\"Nothing.\" Gu Jiao said lightly.A woman who can kill four men with one blow in the daytime is so weak that she can't stand up. Can it be nothing? Xue Ningxiang looked at her hand covering her stomach and said in a voice, \"have you come to Kwai Shui?\"Gu Jiao has no strength to pay attention to her.When Xiao LIULANG heard the movement of the room, he came up and asked, \"what's the matter?\"Gu Jiao didn't speak, but Xue Ningxiang said: 'she came to kuishui, and the pain was very severe. Do you have brown sugar at home? Make her a bowl. \"Xiao LIULANG suddenly froze.Xue Ningxiang didn't think so much. She thought that they had been married for half a year. They must have been married early. There was nothing to say about this.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: 18Xiao LIULANG went out awkwardly.There is no brown sugar at home. The market is closed so late. If you want it, you can only borrow it from someone else's house.Xiao LIULANG never asked anyone to borrow anything, let alone the brown sugar that women drank when they came.He stood under the eaves, his cheeks burning.But after taking a few deep breaths, he got up and went to the east of the village.\"Aunt Zhang.\" He knocked on Zhang's door.Aunt Zhang opened the door and saw that it was him. She asked with a smile, \"it's LIULANG. What's the matter with you so late?\"\"I'll... Borrow some brown sugar.\" Xiao LIULANG said calmly.In the countryside, brown sugar is a rare thing. Most people don't have it. Aunt Zhang's daughter-in-law has just given birth to a baby and is sitting in the confinement. Xiao LIULANG hears that she asked her second uncle to bring brown sugar to the market.\"Why brown sugar? Is Miss Gu pregnant Aunt Zhang asked.Xiao LIULANG's cheek was hot again: \"no, no!\"\"Ah, that's sunflower water. What's the matter? For the first time? \" Aunt Zhang is a passer-by. When you look at him, you can see what's going on.Unexpectedly, LIULANG is also a person who will hurt.Aunt Zhang went back to the room and put a piece of brown sugar in a bowl for him. She joked: \"it's a happy event for a woman to come here, which means that she will give birth to a baby for you soon!\"Xiao didn't know how he left.He took the boiled brown sugar water to Gu Jiao's house. Xue Ningxiang had already gone back. Gu Jiao was lying on the bed, a little weak.He did not squint into the room, brown sugar water on the table: \"you drink first, not enough to call me.\"Then he turned and left.Although he walked very fast, Gu Jiao found that his ears were red.Gu Jiao chuckled and drank the brown sugar water in the bowl.She did not expect, brown sugar water really effective, warm body, the whole person comfortable a lot, she soon went to sleep.That night, she dreamed again.She dreamed that she got up late the next day. Xiao LIULANG went out alone and met Gu Xiaoshun at the entrance of the village.They went to the Academy together and entered the same class.Gu Xiaoshun is a very generous person. He fell asleep in the first morning of class. The result is very bad. When it came to the dormitory, no one wanted to live with him, but Xiao LIULANG stood up.They were assigned to the most Western dormitory, which was in disrepair for a long time. As soon as they went in, the roof collapsed. Xiao LIULANG was seriously injured, and Gu Xiaoshun was slightly injured.The next day, Gu Jiao really got up late.Because of the experience of dreaming last time, Gu Jiao is more calm this time.Xiao LIULANG is not here. He should have gone to school.She went to Luo Er Shu's house to ask, and learned that Xiao LIULANG went to the Academy with Gu Xiaoshun. She decided to go to the Academy.Uncle Luo's ox cart went to town. She walked there and arrived at the college at noon.Gu Xiaoshun fell asleep on the table until the student in front of him poked him with a pen: \"Hey, it's time to eat!\"Gu Xiaoshun just rubbed his eyes and sat up: \"ah, do you want to eat?\"The students around him looked at the folds on his face pressed out by the books and all laughed.No one in the class knows that Gu Xiaoshun is a relative and comes in through the back door, but everyone didn't expect that this product is completely ignorant.Even the worst class in Tianxiang academy has never been so lazy.All the people looked at Gu Xiaoshun with a trace of disapproval.Soon, Master Zhang of his class came.Mr. Zhang said, \"today we are going to have separate dormitories. There are four people in one room. You can discuss it by yourself, and then come to me to get the key.\"There are 26 people in class B, which means that only two people will live in one of the rooms.Everyone soon divided up. Xiao LIULANG's deskmate had two friends he had known since childhood in his class. He called Xiao LIULANG to join him.Gu Xiaoshun is much more bumpy here. No one wants to share a room with him. He is successful and single; There is also a student who asked for leave yesterday and entered school today. Because he didn't know everyone, he was also left alone.Obviously, this student also dislikes Gu Xiaoshun: \"I... I don't want to share a room with him!\"\"Well! Then I'll live by myself Gu Xiaoshun holds his arms and looks at the sky.Of course, he can't live on his own. Does the single student have to sleep on the wall?Xiao LIULANG light mouth way: \"I change with you.\"The student was very grateful and said several thanks, but he didn't call his father.Gu Xiaoshun said: \"brother in law, you don't have to live with me! It's not that I don't want to live with you. I feel that... \"Xiao LIULANG took the key from Master Zhang and left without expression.Gu Xiaoshun smacks his lips and reluctantly follows.All the good rooms were chosen, and the one left was the most partial one. They walked forward with their bags.Just in the middle of the walk, a little guy came running with a big sweat: \"who is Xiao LIULANG?\"Xiao LIULANG stopped, turned to him and said, \"I am.\"The boy gasped: \"your family is here! Waiting for you outside, it's urgent! I want you to see her at onceXiao LIULANG is an orphan. She is the only one who can be called his family.Xiao LIULANG stopped and said to Gu Xiaoshun, \"it's your sister.\"\"Here comes my sister?\" Listen to is Gu Jiao, Gu Xiaoshun whole person spirit, \"that still wait for what?\"? Go to my sister quicklyIn fact, it's only a few steps away from the dormitory. It's not impossible to put things in and see her again.But she said it was urgent.Xiao LIULANG quickened his pace and went to the gate of the Academy with Gu Xiaoshun, carrying his baggage and crutches.People came and went in the street, and she was dressed in humble clothes, but Xiao LIULANG recognized her at once.She stood in the cold wind, her face was a little red with cold. Maybe she didn't like the noise, and her brow was slightly wrinkled from time to time.\"Sister! Sister Gu xiaoshunxing rushes to Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao took a look at him and quickly looked away to see Xiao LIULANG behind the crowd.Xiao LIULANG also happened to be looking at her, four eyes opposite, Xiao LIULANG Zheng for a while, Gu Jiao smile.Xiao LIULANG staggers his sight and walks towards her.\"Sister, what are you looking for?\" Gu Xiaoshun asked.\"Oh, nothing.\" Gu Jiao cloud light breeze light way, \"come to seek you to have a meal.\"After that, seeing Xiao LIULANG looking at her suspiciously, she straightened Gu Xiaoshun's collar and said solemnly, \"you can't rest assured on your first day of school.\"They went to a nearby noodle shop and ate three bowls of Yangchun noodles.It's the one Feng Lin took Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao to eat last time.Xiao LIULANG didn't eat well.Gu Jiao said, \"isn't it the noodles from your hometown? You don't like it? \"\"It's not as good as you make.\" This sentence is blurted out, and Xiao LIULANG himself is stunned.Gu Jiao also Leng for a while, then Tuo Ji looked at him, said with a smile: \"OK, I'll make it for you in the evening.\"Gu Xiaoshun has a large amount of food. He finished one bowl and wanted to eat another. But somehow, he suddenly felt full.\"What am I full of?\"Gouzi: eat my food, what do you say!!!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: 19After dinner, Xiao LIULANG and Gu Xiaoshun return to the Academy, only to be told that their dormitory collapsed.\"When did it collapse?\" Asked Xiao LIULANG.\"The student said:\" you just left soon collapsed, many people see you go to bed, are worried that you will be buried in itI was going to, butXiao LIULANG has a slight look.Gu Xiaoshun ran to look at the collapsed dormitory, only to see the ruins of the ground, the floor is broken by the beam. Thinking of what would happen if it hit people's heads, he patted his chest in horror: \"fortunately, my sister came to eat with us! Or we'll both be buried alive! \"Including the medical school, he could see that the president was very satisfied.He thought that the affairs of his disciples should be settled. Even Xiao LIULANG came here somehow.Is it for the bedroom?It's said that his and Gu Xiaoshun's dormitory collapsed at noon, so bad things can also let him meet, it can be seen that he didn't have that life.Thinking about this, Gu Dashun sneered and went back to the classroom.In the central hall, the Dean pointed to the eight part essay on his desk and asked Xiao LIULANG, \"did you write this essay yourself?\"\"Yes.\" Xiao LIULANG said.The dean's sharp eyes fell on Xiao LIULANG. He was only seventeen years old. His face was still green and astringent, but his eyebrows were calm and cold.He has a lame leg, but he seems to be more expensive than any healthy student.\"Why don't you answer the first two subjects?\" Asked the president.The outsider only knew that the student had passed the countdown, but he didn't know three examinations. He handed in two blank papers.I shouldn't have been admitted, but the article was so amazing.The student named Gu Dashun's article was also good, but it belonged to the freshman. Compared with Xiao LIULANG, it was immediately eclipsed.Xiao did not answer the president's question.What a stubborn child, the Dean sighed in his heart, waved his hand and said, \"OK, you go to class.\"Xiao LIULANG saluted a student and turned to go out.Behind the curtain came an old man in cloth.\"Teacher.\" The president stood up immediately and saluted respectfully.The old man in cloth picked up Xiao LIULANG's article and shook his head after reading it: \"you are a student. You are very angry.\"But after saying goodbye to Xiao LIULANG, Gu Jiao went to the nearby market.The market in Zhendong is similar to that in Zhenxi, but it's more upscale and the corresponding price is higher. But now the market is closed, so if she wants to buy things, she can only go to the shop or market.In Gu Jiao's shop, he bought five Jin of white flour and cut two Jin of excellent three line pork, also known as two Jin of salt, which cost more than 100 coppers.When passing by a cloth shop, she remembered that when she collected clothes for Xiao LIULANG a few days ago, his middle coat and inner coat were broken.She went in and bought a new set. She asked the boss for some rags. She would mend some that could be mended.Although she didn't mend her clothes, she sewed her heart. If she took the cloth as a piece of human skin, it would be very good!Gu Jiao put all her shopping into the basket and was ready to go back to the village. When she came out of the shop, she found that there were many more officers and soldiers on the street.There are people whispering to one side.\"What happened?\"\"It's said that the patients in leprosy mountain have run away. The government is searching the streets all over the place.\"\"Oh, leper, that's ok?\"\"Isn't it? Don't go out these days. Don't run into it carelessly! Once the disease is spread, it will not be cured. \"In ancient times, leprosy was an incurable disease. After being infected, they were sent to the mountain of leprosy to die.Gu Jiao suddenly remembered that Xiao LIULANG's elder brother had died of leprosy.The officers and men searched the street and went down one street.Gu Jiao went back to the village.Gu Jiao didn't care about what happened in the street. She went back to her house to make spring noodles.When she was kneading the dough, there was a loud bang outside the door, as if something had hit the door panel of her house.Gu Jiao wiped her hands with a dry cloth. When she walked over, she saw an old lady lying in front of her house.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: 20The old lady was lying on her side. Her face was covered by her disheveled hair. Her body was dirty and she was wearing cloth clothes. Gu Jiao's first reaction was that the villagers of the village might have just come back from the field, but somehow she fainted at her door.Just now that loud noise was her head smashed on the door panel, her forehead was broken and bleeding a little.Gu Jiao's previous life is not that she has never met a porcelain bumper, but if you want to talk about her life, she has not.The other side really fainted.Gu Jiao squats down and wants to see which family she belongs to or send her back. As a result, Gu Jiao finds something wrong as soon as she pulls her body over and lies flat.Her face has symmetrical light colored skin lesions and light red spots. The boundary between the spots is blurred, and there are also spots on the backs of hands on both sides.Gu Jiao's eyebrows frowned slightly. It was clear that\"Sister! We are backAt this time, Gu Xiaoshun carrying an old book bag, flying toward Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao turned her head and looked at him. Her eyes lit up: \"don't come here!\"Gu Jiao had never spoken to Gu Xiaoshun in such a severe tone, and Gu Xiaoshun was stunned.\"Sister...\" he took two more steps forward.\"I said, don't come here!\" Gu Jiao's tone is even colder.This time, Gu Xiaoshun did not dare to move, so he stood about ten steps away from Gu Jiao.When he saw Gu Jiao, he naturally saw the old lady who had fallen in front of her.Intuition told him that it had something to do with the old lady.He asked, 'sister, who is she?\"Gu Gu said: \"I don't know, you go back to Gu first.\"Originally, she was going to call Gu Xiaoshun to come for dinner, but now this kind of thing happened, the safety of the family can not be fully guaranteed, she can not harm Gu Xiaoshun.Gu Xiaoshun was not happy, but since his elder sister said so, he would go back first.\"Well, brother-in-law, I'll go first.\" He turned and said to Xiao LIULANG behind him.Gu Jiao slightly surprised, Xiao LIULANG also came back?Not only Xiao LIULANG, but also Feng Lin.Feng Lin helped his deskmate review his lessons. His deskmate gave him a basket of grapefruit as a token of thanks. He gave Xiao LIULANG half of them. Worried that Xiao LIULANG couldn't carry it, he sent it back to the village.As for Gu Xiaoshun, he always bullies Xiao LIULANG. Feng Lin is also a little worried that Xiao LIULANG will go home with him, a little watching them.Both Xiao LIULANG and Feng Lin noticed the old lady on the ground.\"You'd better not come either.\" Gu Jiao said to them.Feng Lin frowned strangely: \"is she dead? You didn't kill it, did you? \"\"Hello! What are you talking about? \" Gu Xiaoshun can't stand this little white face who always slanders his elder sister.Feng Lin snorted: \"am I wrong? Something must have happened to the old man, otherwise why don't we go over? \"Xiao LIULANG walked over coldly.\"You... Don't come here.\" Gu Jiao said.Xiao LIULANG still came.In fact, he saw something was wrong from a long distance, and only when he came closer and had a closer look could he be sure of his guess.Feng Lin saw him go over and followed him.\"Ah! Why did you all pass! Sister, i... I... \"Gu Xiaoshun scratched his head in a hurry.Feng Lin came to Xiao LIULANG's side and looked at the old lady with a red face. An ominous premonition came to his heart: \"brother Xiao, this is...\"\"Leprosy.\" Xiao LIULANG said with a frown.Feng Lin nearly fell down in a flash!\"This... This old lady is a leper...\" Feng Lin stammered.You know, leprosy is one of the most terrible infectious diseases. It is said that as long as one person gets infected in the village, the whole village will get infected. Moreover, there is no cure for this disease, and if he gets it, he can only wait to die.In the former dynasty, tens of thousands of people died because they didn't pay enough attention to leprosy.After the founding emperor of our Dynasty ascended the throne, the first important thing was to establish the leprosy mountain and send all leprosy patients to the mountain for centralized management.\"Did you touch her?\" Xiao LIULANG looks at Gu Jiao calmly.Gu Jiao nodded.However, she just touched it, and her skin was not damaged, so there was little chance of infection.But others may not think so.If people knew that Gu Jiao had contact with a leprosy patient, they would send her and the patient to leprosy mountain together.Once you go up, you don't want to come down again.Feng Lin took Xiao LIULANG more than ten steps away and said, \"you've heard what she said. She's touched the leper. You must send her away immediately! Otherwise your whole village will be infected! \"Xiao LIULANG frowned slightly.Feng Lin stamped his foot and said, \"Oh, brother Xiao, what are you hesitating about? Don't you always want to get rid of that wicked woman? It is she who has been infected with leprosy. According to the law of the imperial court, she will be sent to leprosy mountain. This is a chance to get rid of herFeng Lin has thought that Xiao LIULANG is a scholar, and his reputation will be ruined if he abandons his wife and son. What's happening now is a timely rain, which can not only save his reputation, but also get rid of that wicked woman!\"No one will be sent to Mt. leprosy.\" Xiao LIULANG said calmly.Feng Lin was stunned.Xiao LIULANG clutching a cane toward Gu Jiao walked in the past: \"take a piece of dry cloth.\"Gu Jiao didn't ask much. She went to the room and took a clean cloth.Xiao LIULANG took the cloth from her hand and squatted down in front of the old lady.Realizing what he was going to do, Gu Jiao said, \"I'll do it.\"\"No Xiao LIULANG put the cloth around the old lady's face, blocking her mouth and nose, \"carry people in.\"\"Good.\" Gu Jiao nodded.\"Ah! Brother Xiao Feng Lin stopped it.Gu Xiaoshun has heard about it now. He dares to know that the old lady is a leper who doesn't know where to fight. His sister is afraid that he will be infected, so she won't let him go.But is Gu Xiaoshun such a man of no loyalty?Gu Xiaoshun ran to help his sister and brother-in-law carry people into the backyard.Feng Lin stamped his feet in a hurry.Crazy!You're all crazy!Then, he also gritted his teeth, risking the risk of infection into the house!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: 21Several people put the old lady on the straw mat in the backyard.Thanks to the fact that the backyard of their room is big enough, otherwise they may not be able to accommodate a leper and those who want to keep a distance from lepers.\"Now what?\" Gu Xiaoshun looked at the old lady on the ground and asked.\"Wash your hands first.\" Gu Jiao said.They washed their hands with water and Gleditsia sinensis.Then Xiao LIULANG went into his room and wrote a prescription.Gu Jiao stood behind him and asked softly, \"what is this?\"Gu Jiao came here, although inherited the memory of the original owner, but the original owner was not literate, so she did not recognize the characters of this dynasty.\"Prescription.\" Xiao LIULANG said.\"What is this word?\" Gu Jiao asked, pointing to the first word on the prescription.\"Earth.\" Xiao LIULANG read, \"land and bones.\"\"And this one?\" Gu Jiao continued to point down.\"Sophora flavescens, Schizonepeta tenuifolia, asarum...\" Xiao LIULANG read Fang Zi along the place Gu Jiao pointed to.Gu Jiao looked very serious, as if she was really reading. Although it was a bit out of time, Xiao LIULANG didn't think much about it.\"How can you have a prescription for leprosy?\" Gu Jiao asked suspiciously.Xiao LIULANG pauses and says, \"at the beginning, my brother was also infected with leprosy. A barefoot doctor gave him an ancestral prescription. I saw my brother get better after drinking it.\"His elder brother's leprosy was mentioned by him by chance. He was stupid and didn't understand what leprosy was, so he didn't pay attention to it and didn't mention it to anyone.Feng Lin knew that it was because Xiao LIULANG's elder brother had leprosy and his fellow villagers disliked him that he left his hometown to study in Qingquan town.Accidentaly across the road, two people met each other, asking for their identity, Feng Lin knew that the other side was their own neighbor when he was a child. But Feng Lin moved away from his family for many years. The two sides changed greatly. They were not named in registered residence. Feng Lin could not recognize him at all.\"Why did he die when he got better?\" Gu Jiao asked.Xiao LIULANG dropped his eyes and said, \"the news about his leprosy has leaked out, and he has been taken to leprosy mountain by officers and soldiers. Not long after that, he died in the mountains. \"i see.Gu Jiao nodded and said, \"is this the prescription your elder brother used to treat the disease?\"Xiao LIULANG said: \"her symptoms are very mild now, similar to my brother's at that time. She is easy to cure. Maybe she can be cured.\"Gu Jiao has already understood the prescription, which is symptomatic, but its efficacy is very slow, which can only delay the development of leprosy. It is difficult to cure it.However, Gu Jiao said nothing.Feng Lin took the prescription: \"I'll get the medicine!\"Xiao LIULANG warned: \"remember to go to different pharmacies.\"After a while, he suddenly realized, \"I understand!\"No one can see that this is a prescription for leprosy, otherwise they will be exposed.\"I'll go too!\" Gu Xiaoshun.\"What are you going to do?\" Feng Lin doesn't want to be with him.Gu Xiaoshun raised his eyebrows and said, \"I'm guarding against you reporting to the government!\"Don't think he didn't hear it. The goods just encouraged his brother-in-law to send his sister to leprosy mountain!Feng Lin rolled his eyes.If Xiao LIULANG hadn't touched the old lady, he would have reported to the official. But Xiao LIULANG had already touched her. If he went to report to the official again, wouldn't he want to capture her with Xiao LIULANG?In any case, Gu Xiaoshun followed him firmly, and Feng Lin had to take him with him.It's impossible to go by ox cart. In case of leakage, it's dangerous. They went to the major pharmacies in the town on foot. About an hour later, they bought all the herbs and a medicine jar.Gu Jiao took the herbs to the kitchen to boil.Waiting for medicine, Gu Jiao asked Xiao LIULANG, \"how did you come back? I heard that Gu Dashun has moved to his dormitory. \"Xiao LIULANG tells Gu Jiao about the collapse of the dormitory.Sure enough, Gu Jiao said secretly, but she was surprised: \"fortunately, you are OK.\"Xiao LIULANG gave her a deep look.It was too cold in the backyard. Gu Jiao picked up the hut for millet, moved a bamboo bed in, spread cotton wadding, and managed to make a bed.\"You go out and I'll feed her.\" Gu Jiao said to several people.\"Sister, you should be careful.\" Gu Xiaoshun worried.\"Don't worry, I've got a sense of propriety.\" Gu Jiao sent several people out and quietly took out the small medicine box hidden in the basket.Xiao LIULANG's judgment is correct. This patient is indeed in the early stage of leprosy, and she belongs to the type of leprosy with few bacteria, less skin lesions and less infectivity. As long as symptomatic treatment is given, she can recover completely without any sequelae.But her coma was not caused by leprosy. It was caused by fatigue. Her clothes were scratched and her shoes were brokenGu Jiao can't help but think of the officers and soldiers she met in the town. Is she the patient who escaped from leprosy mountain?After the old lady regained her consciousness, Gu Jiao took chlorobenzene sulfone and rifampicin from the medicine box and gave them to her. In addition, she added a special drug from the Institute.As for the bowl of traditional Chinese medicine, she also fed the old lady some, but the old lady seemed to be particularly reluctant to drink bitter medicine, and she spit it out in disgust.\"Old man, where are you from?\" Gu Jiao tries to inquire about the origin of the other party, or send her back safely.As a result, the old lady looked at Gu Jiao, snorted and fell asleep.Gu JiaoGu Jiao picked up her things and went to the backyard to wash her hands.\"Sister!\" Gu Xiaoshun, who had been waiting in the backyard, said, \"why did it take so long to come out?\"\"Old people drink medicine slowly. I fed them a little longer.\" Gu Jiao said quietly.\"Cough.\" Gu Xiaoshun looked around and asked in a low voice, 'sister, can she really be cured? I hear leprosy is incurable. \"Gu Jiao lightly smile: \"rest assured, can cure.\"Gu Xiaoshun never heard that leprosy could be cured, but he didn't know what was going on. When his sister said this, he believed it inexplicably.His elder sister said that if it can be cured, it must be cured!It's getting late. It's time for Gu Xiaoshun and Feng Lin to go back.Before he left, Feng Lin secretly said to Xiao LIULANG, \"brother Xiao, I know you are chivalrous and don't want to die. But I still want to remind you that leprosy can't be cured. You should take advantage of the fact that the people in the village don't find it and send them away when they wake up.\"He can't blame Xiao LIULANG for what he did wrong, because Xiao LIULANG saved him from the fire of the post station without recognizing him.Brother Xiao is such a chivalrous man.\"Also, pay attention to that wicked woman. She has more contact with patients, just in case...\"\"She has a name.\" Xiao LIULANG interrupted Feng Lin.Feng Lin was stunned and looked at Xiao LIULANG in a puzzled way.To be honest, Xiao LIULANG is not a person who gets along well with each other for a long time. He always has an air of \"don't let strangers enter\". If it wasn't for his saving life, Feng Lin would probably think that the other party is a very cold young man.But he felt more and more that Xiao LIULANG was a little different from that evil woman.Brother Xiao... You have changed!!!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: 22The seriousness of the incident was clear to all four of them. They didn't say it, but they kept it secret.Gu Jiao told Gu Xiaoshun not to come here these days. Although the infectivity of early leprosy is not so strong, there are still some risks.Gu Jiao didn't go up the mountain to pick mushrooms, so she took care of the old lady at home for a few days.Maybe she's doing a good job of nursing, \"what's the matter? Anything else? \" Mr. Chen noticed that he was eager to talk and stop.Gu Dashun thought about it, but he still had the courage to say: \"I heard that the entrance examination questions were given by the dean. I wonder if the Dean has any plans to recruit students?\"\"It does.\" Mr. Chen would have thought it over after a while, but unfortunately, Mr. Gu Dashun was not the president's choice.Gu Dashun saw a trace of regret from Chen Fuzi's eyes, and his heart was cool: \"is it Xu Hanzhi?\"\"Not him.\" Mr. Chen shook his head. \"This matter has not been settled yet. Don't ask about it. Even if he can't be a disciple of the Dean, the dean will find time to guide the excellent students in the Academy. \"How can it be the same? One is to inherit the president's mantle and be his successor. What he gets is not only knowledge, but also the president's contacts.And random guidance is too weak.He's such a poor boy. He dreams of flying to the sky. If he's not good enough, he's just good enough to be liked by the president.How is he willing?Gu Dashun wanted to ask, but Chen did not want to.Central hall.Looking at Xiao LIULANG, the dean said gently, \"how are you thinking about it?\"Xiao LIULANG said faintly, \"third from last, do you want it?\"In this exam, Xiao LIULANG came third from the bottom. It's not that he made progress, but that he got Gu Xiaoshun at the bottom.The Dean cleared his throat and said, \"I don't want to embarrass you. In this way, you can go back and think about it for a few days, and you don't have to rush to give me the answer. I would have been in the college years ago. When did you figure it out? When would you come back to me? \"It can be said that it is very sincere to say this from the president.Although Tianxiang academy is just a school in the town, its president once ranked first among the four talents in the capital. His reputation and talent are beyond doubt. He would not have left the capital to teach and educate in a small town of Qingquan if there had not been an accident at home.He met so many students that he really had the impulse to accept him as his own disciple. Xiao LIULANG was the first one.\"Just want him? I'm not afraid that I can't help myself. \"After Xiao LIULANG left, the old man in cloth in the screen humed faintly.The Dean saluted Pingfeng and said with a smile, \"I'm really afraid I can't live. Why don't you... Take him as a disciple?\"There was silence behind the screen. For a long time, the old man sighed: \"you forget, I said I would never accept an apprentice again in my life.\"When the young Marquis died, the Imperial College was closed forever, and the teacher's heart was completely dead.After school, Xiao LIULANG and Gu Xiaoshun return to the village in Uncle Luo's ox cart. When they came out of the town, they found that there were several more checkpoints on the official road, all searching leprosy patients, and they became more vigilant.When Xiao LIULANG got home, Gu Jiao would tell him about the old lady: 'she doesn't remember anything.\"Xiao LIULANG doesn't think it's a bad thing. At least he says it's not. If he doesn't know, he won't let it slip.\"Is she clamoring to go out?\" Asked Xiao LIULANG.Gu Jiao shook her head: \"this is not true. I told her that she has tuberculosis and can't go out to blow. The red spots on her face are frozen out. Because tuberculosis is contagious, she'd better stay in her own room so as not to pass the disease on others. Looking at her, she seems to have heard it. She's been very quiet all afternoon. \"Xiao LIULANG went to the house to see the old lady. Her condition has greatly improved. Her skin lesions are much lighter. If you don't look carefully, you can hardly see the red spots on her face.What Gu Jiao didn't say is that after a few days of treatment, her leprosy will lose its infectivity.In the twinkling of an eye, at the end of the month, it was also the day when Feng Lin and \"Doctor Zhang\" made an appointment to treat Xiao LIULANG's leg.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: 23Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG got up early.Xiao LIULANG went to the village to fetch water.Gu Jiao first went to the hut to see the old lady's situation. The red spots on her face were almost invisible, and the skin lesions on the back of her hands were almost disappeared.Although it's still early to cure completely, her infectivity has been blocked.Gu Jiao touched chin contentedly, turn round to cook medicine for her.Looking at the bitter medicine in front of her, the old lady turned her eyes.In order to make her drink medicine better, Gu Jiao asks Xiao LIULANG to bring some preserves from the town. The old lady likes to eat preserves very much, but if she doesn't drink medicine, there will be no preserves.Gu Jiao put a bowl of medicine and a small dish of preserves on the table at the same time.\"So few! Only three The old lady was seriously dissatisfied with the quantity of preserves.\"Preserves are very expensive. Don't eat them.\" Gu Jiao said, reaching out for the dish with the preserved fruit.The old lady gave Gu Jiao a resentful look, grabbed the preserves in her arms and drank a bowl of soup bitterly.Because Xiao LIULANG is going to the hospital today, Gu Jiao has to go too, but she can't leave the old lady at home alone.It's not that Gu Jiao hasn't considered taking the old lady with her, but the pipeline is still at the gate. In case the officials recognize the old lady, they will lose all their previous achievements.Although she was not sure whether the old lady was the leper they were catching, she was very careful.After much deliberation, Gu Jiao calls Gu Xiaoshun over.\"Sister! You finally let me in Gu Xiaoshun said excitedly.Gu Jiao said, \"I'm going to accompany your brother-in-law to town today. You stay at home and help me look after the old lady. She's no longer very sick, and I've detoxified the house. \"Gu Xiaoshun didn't understand the meaning of disinfection, and didn't ask his sister how she knew that the disease had passed away. He didn't have any hesitation to answer: \"OK! Sister, you can rest assured! I'll look at her! \"\"I'm hot in the pot for lunch. Just bring her one.\" Gu Jiao continues to exhort.Gu Xiaoshun patted his chest and said, \"elder sister, I'll do business. Don't worry!\"Thought of what, Gu Jiao exhorted: \"if someone asks, you say is your brother-in-law's relatives, come to him.\"Gu Xiaoshun obediently: \"good!\"As soon as Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG left, the villains who had followed Gu Xiaoshun came to the door.\"Boss! I saw you! I heard that you went to study. Why do you still play Dashun! Let's go! Go and get two tickets! \"\"Roll, roll, roll! I have business! \" Gu Xiaoshun would not want to bombard people away.Although it's been too long, he's itchy, but his sister told him that he had to do it well.When Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG arrived at the rejuvenation hall, Feng Lin had been wandering at the door for a long time. At the beginning, he agreed with huichuntang that it was already time, but he was worried that there were too many people looking for Doctor Zhang for treatment, so Chenshi came.He had been waiting here for half an hour, but there was no sign of queuing.When he was wondering, he saw Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao.His face sank instantly: \"how did you come?\"Gu Jiao said with a smile: \"I'll go around.\"Feng Lin didn't understand. Didn't she hear that she had a crush on others? Why have you been pestering brother Xiao recently? Even brother Xiao came with her to treat the disease!Brother Xiao really is. What do you do with a trouble when it's so important to treat a disease? What if it goes wrong?Feng Lin said coldly, \"I can warn you that you are not allowed to talk or touch other people's things when you enter the hospital. Don't make trouble for brother Xiao and delay brother Xiao's leg treatment!\"\"Oh.\" Gu Jiao should be a, no impatience, no temper.But Xiao LIULANG frowned at Feng Lin and went in clutching his crutch.It was shopkeeper Wang who received them.Shopkeeper Wang had been waiting for a long time. He came up with a smile, looked at Gu Jiao without any trace, and said with a smile to Feng Lin: \"here comes Mr. Feng. This must be Mr. Xiao, Mr. Feng's friend, right? I'm manager Wang of huichuntang. \"Xiao LIULANG nodded lightly.Shopkeeper Wang secretly exclaimed that this young master Xiao was too handsome. He was obviously in poor clothes, but he was more noble than any young master he had ever met.\"This is...\" shopkeeper Wang looked at Gu Jiao, a completely unknown look.Xiao LIULANG stopped: \"my wife Gu.\"Gu Jiao: my wife, Gu Shi, that's a nice name.Shopkeeper Wang arched his hand with a smile: \"it's Mrs. Xiao. It's disrespectful.\"Gu Jiao: you don't sound so good.\"Shopkeeper Wang, is Doctor Zhang really here? Why is there no patient in line here? \" Asked Feng Lin.\"Well, isn't that Doctor Zhang's injury is not healed and can't receive a large number of patients? I didn't let out the news. I just told a few patients who were really worried. You were the only one in the morning, and the rest in the afternoon! \" Shopkeeper Wang had known that Feng Lin would ask questions, so he had already finished his words in advance.\"I see.\" Feng Lin has no doubt about him.Shopkeeper Wang said with a smile, \"Mr. Feng, please have a rest in the lobby. I'll take Mr. Xiao to see Doctor Zhang.\"\"Can't I go in?\" Asked Feng Lin.Shopkeeper Wang said with a smile, \"I'm afraid it's against the rules.\"Feng Lin thought for a moment, nodded and said, \"OK, I'll give brother Xiao to you, shopkeeper Wang. You must let Doctor Zhang cure him!\"Shopkeeper Wang Yu Guang glanced at Gu Jiao with a smile: \"we will try our best.\"After Xiao LIULANG and manager Wang entered the back room, Gu Jiao also stood up.\"What are you doing?\" Feng Lin asked warily.\"Go to the toilet.\" Gu Jiao said.Feng Lin made a big red face: \"go early, return early, don't run around!\"Gu Jiao carried a small basket to the back yard.When she came into the wing room, Xiao LIULANG had fallen asleep on the cane chair.Shopkeeper Wang and his two masters are here.\"Miss Gu.\" The second owner arched his hand.Gu Jiao's eyes swept the fumigation stove on the table, fell on Xiao LIULANG's sleeping face and asked, \"is this incense OK?\"The second owner said with a kind face: \"it's just tranquilizing incense. It's made by our rejuvenation hall. It doesn't hurt our body. Is Miss Gu going to treat him now? \"\"Well.\" Gu Jiao went over and put the basket on the table, which contained her medicine box. However, she did not intend to take it out in front of them.In fact, the second owner wanted to ask Gu Jiao, since Xiao is her husband, why not tell him directly? Or are they not really husband and wife?However, the second owner is a smart man. When he opens the door to do business, he must have more ears and less mouth.Never ask what you shouldn't ask.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: 24Gu Jiao pulls up the screen and checks it for Xiao LIULANG.As early as at home, Gu Jiao observed Xiao LIULANG and found that his problems mainly occurred in his ankles. Now after a careful examination, Gu Jiao decided her guessHis ankle was broken, but the doctor didn't diagnose it. He thought he only hurt his leg, so he only treated his leg. But even if there was no deliberate treatment, his leg was braked, so he almost didn't use his feet. His ankle still grew well, but the broken bones inside didn't clean up, and he would feel painful as soon as he walked.He never showed it, but Gu Jiao speculated that he was just an ordinary ankle stiffness, which was painless. Now that he was diagnosed, he realized how much restraint he used to endure.Ah... It's a real pain in the ass.Gu Jiao had many operations in her previous life, but it was not difficult for her. It was just that the medicine and surgical consumables did not appear in the medicine box for the time being.But... Thinking of her discovery a few days ago, Gu Jiao decided to wait, and now is not a good time for surgery. It's better to wait until the end of the year for the college to have a holiday.The second owner and shopkeeper Wang were waiting outside the screen all the way, without half a peep.In the early days, the two masters actually planned to let the doctors of Tongchuntang watch Gu Jiao's medical skills. But for the first time, it seemed that the request was a little abrupt, so he put up with it.Just now Gu Jiao went in for treatment and pulled up the screen. This attitude itself shows that Gu Jiao is not willing to disclose her medical skills. When she thinks about it, the second owner is a little lucky that she didn't ask for observation.But there is one thing the second owner guessed wrong, that is, Gu Jiao is not unwilling to disclose her medical skills, she can't let people find her small medicine box.Gu Jiao stayed in for a long time.Check for a quarter of an hour, enjoy beauty for half an hour.Cough!No, no, no!The small medicine box was put into the basket by Gu Jiao, and she came out with the basket.The second owner came up and said with a polite smile, \"Miss Gu has been in for so long. Is the injury of young master Xiao very complicated?\"Gu Jiao said without changing her face: \"it's very complicated. I need to have an operation on him.\"Complexity is true, beauty is true.When he heard that surgery was needed, the second company was a bit dazed. Surgery was a medical skill only used in the battlefield, and the folk rarely dabbled in it. On the one hand, it is a high risk; on the other hand, it is also a high demand for doctors' skills. Even the doctors in their rejuvenation hall did not dare to use knives on the injured.\"Are you... Sure?\" The second owner looks suspicious.The doctor who dares to use a knife in the rejuvenation hall is already 50 years old. He is still a descendant of the medical family.\"Well.\" Gu Jiao nodded, \"I'll think about the day first. I'll let you know when it's settled. In addition, there are some things that need to be prepared to trouble the second owner. The silver... Will be deducted from my next consultation fee. \"\"You may as well do it.\" The second owner laughs.Huichuntang is not a place for charity. All the patients who come here have to spend money. The better the medical skills are, the richer the diagnosis money is.\"But... Can you cure any disease?\" Asked the second owner.\"That's not true.\" Gu Jiao way, \"want to see just know, you'd better find some difficult and miscellaneous diseases to me, don't waste the number of visits.\"Listen, that's the bottom line!In fact, anyone who has seen her medical skills has every reason to believe that she can come back from the dead.Gu Jiao needs to find some herbs for Xiao LIULANG to smoke. She carries the basket to the lobby.The second leader laughed strangely: \"Lao Wang, you say she is so good at medicine, can you... Cure the one in the capital?\"\"The one in the capital?\" Shopkeeper Wang was stunned. After a long time, he responded, \"are you talking about the young master of Hou's mansion?\"\"It's him!\" he saidShopkeeper Wang waved his hand in a hurry: \"no, no, no! I can't help itThat's a noble in Beijing! In front of them, the rejuvenation hall is just a civilian. It's not enough to see!\"I think Miss Gu's medical skill is good...\"\"Second master, we all have one head.\"Shopkeeper Wang cruelly snuffed out the idea of the second owner.It's not that he doesn't want to earn money from the Marquis's house, but that the young master's illness is really incurable. If it's broken, he will die.The young master was also poor. He was born in a broken Temple less than a month ago. He didn't bring his mother-in-law with him, so he found one from a nearby village.Premature birth, poor production conditions, coupled with the poor technology of stable mother-in-law, a birth, Mrs. Hou half life.To make matters worse, Mrs. Hou was pregnant with twins. After giving birth to the first, Mrs. Hou's strength was almost exhausted. The second one held in her stomach for a long time. When she came out, she was all purple.The young master was the second child, and above him was a sister.Young master is a weak disease in his mother's womb. When he takes medicine as a child, it's almost as big as the medicine pot.In order to cure the young master's illness, the Hou family has sought many famous doctors over the years. Unfortunately, the young master's illness has never improved. On the contrary, because of frequent medication, he has become more and more weak.It is said that he has only one breath left to hang.If they're not lucky, they'll go down with a dose of medicine, and the young man will die.If the young master really died in their hands, the heads of all the doctors in huichuntang would not be enough to pay for his life.The second owner knew the stakes, but he didn't give up.He was originally a man full of ambition, otherwise he would not see the great value of Gu Jiao.It seems that the young master is the same age as Miss Gu.If the second owner has a way: \"otherwise, let Miss Gu treat Xiao LIULANG's injury first. If she is really cured, let her go to Hou's house to have a try.\"Shopkeeper Wang--When Xiao LIULANG woke up, there was an old doctor with white beard in the room.\"You are...\"The old doctor laughed and said, \"I'm Dr. Zhang. You just went to sleep. It's my fault. I forgot to withdraw the tranquilizer.\"Xiao LIULANG pause: \"may as well.\"\"Let me see your legs.\"\"Good.\"The old doctor went through the process according to Gu Jiao.To be honest, he was very surprised that he had seen Xiao LIULANG's leg disease, and the medical skills of huichuntang today could not cure it at all.That girl, really have a way to let him... Stand up again?Xiao LIULANG took the prescription from the old doctor and went to the lobby. Feng linsou stood up: \"you can figure it out. What does Doctor Zhang say? Do you have a cure for your leg? \"Xiao LIULANG gave a sound and said, \"Doctor Zhang said that he would smoke for a period of time and come back next month.\"In order not to affect his class, Gu Jiao did not let the old doctor mention the operation for the time being.\"I said that Dr. Zhang would be able to cure it!\" Feng Lin was full of joy.But Xiao LIULANG looked around.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: 25At this time, Gu Jiao came from the backyard with a small basket on her back.\"It's a long time to go to the toilet!\" Feng Lin whispered.Xiao LIULANG's eyes fell on Gu Jiao. When she came near, he asked her, \"what's wrong? Let the doctor have a look.\"\"No, let's go.\" Gu Jiao said.She didn't look like she was ill. Xiao LIULANG went to get the medicine. When he paid the bill, he found that the medicine bag for half a month was less than one or two silver: \"is there a mistake?\"\"No, that's the price.\" The man said.\"I've told you that their business is not good. They're cutting prices.\" Feng Lin whispered in his ear.But it's also down... Too much.But in addition to this, Xiao LIULANG couldn't think of any other reason. There would never be any noble person to help him secretly.The party went out of the rejuvenation hall.Two owners personally to the door, and Gu Jiao pass, two owners smile to Gu Jiao stretched out five fingers.The cost of medicine, five Liang silver, should be recorded first.Gu Jiao gave him a domineering small eyes, from the diagnosis... BUCKLE!In other words, the second owner hasn't asked her to see someone else, and doesn't know what kind of business she will receive at that time.\"Brother Xiao, I'll take you back.\" Feng Lin said.Xiao LIULANG couldn't refuse to say, \"no, uncle Luo's ox cart is there. Go back to the academy and study hard. It will end next year.\"When it comes to this, Feng Lin has a big head. In fact, his knowledge is not very good. Master always says that his articles are too rigid and have not enough new ideas. It's good to meet the examiners of the old school. If he meets the examiners of the new school, he will fail.Feng Lin sighed: \"OK, I'll go to the Academy first. Be careful on your way.\"After that, he glared at Gu Jiao again, as if he was worried that Gu Jiao would cause trouble for Xiao LIULANG. However, since Xiao LIULANG said that she had a name, he didn't call her little evil woman any more.After Feng Lin left, Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG didn't go back to the village immediately. Instead, they went to the shop to buy something.Gu Jiao bought some preserves and peanuts and melon seeds. She found that the old lady was very nice. As long as she was given something to eat, she could stay in the house all day.Xiao LIULANG bought some brown sugar. Last time he borrowed brown sugar from Aunt Zhang's family, he never gave it back to her.When they were carrying things to the ox cart, uncle Luo said with a smile, \"what about new year's goods? It's time to do it. It's time to close the new year. \"They were stunned at the same time.Suddenly realized that the end of the year is coming.In fact, they didn't live in a muddle, they just didn't have the habit and plan to celebrate the new year in their hearts. The new year's eve of family reunion is always the loneliest day for them.Gu Jiao left home at the age of eight in her previous life and lived in the organization's experimental base. Once the organization arrived at New Year's Eve, it would have a collective holiday. She was the only one left in the empty base.Gu Jiao doesn't know much about Xiao LIULANG's situation. Maybe he was busy, but there is nothing behind him.She is a lonely soul in a foreign world, and he is a lonely guest in a foreign land.Luo Er Shu's words made them feel at a loss.But they didn't say anything. They just got on the cart with the things in their hands.The ox cart went slowly. It was dark when it arrived at the village.Luo Er Shu drives the ox cart back to her home. Gu Jiao throws everything into her little basket and walks towards her home with Xiao Liu Lang.Just halfway through, I saw something happened at my door, surrounded by a group of people, three floors inside and three floors outside.Aunt Zhang, who was at the door and couldn't leave because she was feeding her two grandchildren, yelled at them: \"Oh, LIULANG, how did you come back? There's something wrong with your family\"What's the matter, Aunt Zhang?\" Asked Xiao LIULANG.\"The caretakers come to the door and quarrel with your... Aunt!\"Auntie?When did such a person come to their family?It can't be... Old lady?The old lady is senile dementia. She will be bullied miserably!Gu Jiao turned to Xiao LIULANG and said, \"I'll go and have a look first.\"Aunt Zhang said quickly, \"go quickly! You are not a fuel-efficient lampGu Jiao has been here for such a long time, but she has not met the original owner's grandmother. She only knows her surname is Wu. She was a shrewd woman when she was young, and then she married Mr. Gu. Mr. Gu was a scholar, and later he became Li Zheng. It is said that Wu should be restrained when he follows him, but Wu is more and more arrogant.Who is the most difficult person in the village is Wu, so Aunt Zhang is worried that Xiao LIULANG's \"aunt\" will be bullied.When Gu Jiao came to her home, she found that all the women of Gu's family had come, Wu's family and her two daughter-in-law, Zhou's and Liu's.Of course, Gu Xiaoshun and Gu Ershun are also here.Gu Ershun stood beside her mother, while Gu Xiaoshun stood beside the old lady.However, what is different from Aunt Zhang's description is that it seems that Wu's three are the ones who are red faced and thick necked!\"You... You have the guts to say that again!\" Wu crossed his waist and pointed to the old lady.The old lady didn't know who had moved a bench for her. She sat on the bench with her legs crossed and grabbed a handful of melon seeds. While knocking, she casually said, \"why do you say it again? Are you hard to understand, or are you deaf? \"The Wu family has been domineering in the village for so many years, but no one has ever been so humiliated.Don't blame two daughter-in-law to invite her to come to scold, this old woman's way, two daughter-in-law can't resist at all!\"I don't care! He must bring me one or two silver tonight! \" Wu said he would not win, so he began to cheat.The old lady vomited her melon seed shell: \"I Pooh! Did he eat your rice or drink your porridge? Kiln girls are more shameful than you! Don't say one or two silver, you won't give a copperIt's like comparing Wu's family to those unruly women in the kiln. Wu's family is going to explode!Wu: \"you...\"The old lady didn't give Wu any chance to play her part: \"besides, don't say how much she ate after my family ate Jiaojiao. How much did you ask LIULANG for? Jiaojiao in my family was going to recruit a son-in-law in the family. But if you don't do it, you'll drive them out. Now that I'm out, it's none of your business to look after your family! \"Wu was so angry that he trembled: \"that... That's just separation!\" What's the matter? If this kind of word is spread, will the reputation of caring for the family still be needed?The old lady took a melon seed again: \"Oh, you admit that you are separated! Now that the family is separated, why do you ask LIULANG to pay you with silver! What about the face? Take it to the wallWu's eyes rolled with choking.Where's the crazy woman, Jane... She's so angry!The villagers are dying of laughter.Wu's mouth has never been defeated in the village, but today it has been turned into a gourd with a saw mouth.At that time, the Gu family claimed that it was Xiao LIULANG's idea. Xiao LIULANG didn't want to live with Gu family, so the villagers didn't have much to say.After Gu Jiao, she always had a meal at Gu's house. The villagers all knew about it, but they didn't expect that Gu's house had collected money!Gu Jiao is just a 14-year-old girl. How much rice can she eat? But Gu asked Xiao LIULANG to give them one or two a month!Isn't that false?One or two silver is enough for a family to eat for two months!Zhou and Liu just saw that Xiao LIULANG didn't give it to his family this month, so they came to ask for it. How could they expect that this situation would become uncontrollable?What should we do now?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: 26My mother-in-law's mouth is not the door. After a long quarrel, she has been trapped by people's stereotype for a long time. What she should say and what she shouldn't say are all told.If it goes on like this, my mother-in-law will expose my care for my family.The sister-in-law exchanged a look and made a decision in their heart. They couldn't let them quarrel any more. They had to pull their mother-in-law back quickly.\"Mother! I don't agree with her! Let's go back first Zhou came forward, took Wu's arm and said.Liu also came over and took Wu's other arm: \"yes, mother, we don't care about this crazy woman!\"If they had said that at first, the villagers might have believed it, but after a fight, Wu and her two daughters-in-law became fried chicken, but the old lady was calm and her lines were not disordered. If she was really a crazy woman, it had to be Wu.The villagers' look at the good play completely angered Wu.Wu's sleeve a smooth, spit star son horizontal fly way: \"old never die! Do you know who I am? I'm Li Zheng's mother-in-law\"Oh.\" The old lady rolled her eyes. \"I'm the emperor's mother!\"All the people around laughed.The old lady is a little interesting. She is not afraid of being beheaded.Wu's own is a mischievous, but met a deeper than their own way, said not to win, she is going to start directly: \"I'll kick you out of the village today --\"Before her voice fell, the old lady poured a basin of cold water on her face, which made her petrified on the spot.Then, the old lady, no matter what, turned and went into the room. She didn't want the bench or Gu Xiaoshun. She closed the door and put the bolt in!It's fast!Everyone's stomachs hurt with laughter.Just now, the old lady's aura was all over the world. They thought she would fight Wu to the end, but they didn't get angry. They knew that they couldn't beat Wu three. They first threw Wu in a daze, and then took the opportunity to shut Wu's mother-in-law and daughter-in-law out!When did the Wu family suffer from such cowardice? He found a stone on the ground and rushed up to smash the door.But the stone didn't hit the door, but a bright sickle came whizzing and chopped on the door!Wu's heart was shocked, and his hand holding the stone froze instantly.If the sickle is half an inch above, it should be cut in her hand.Wu was so surprised that she let go of the stone and hit her own foot.\"Ouch,\" cried Wu.Can the stone used to smash the door be small? She picked the biggest one! Such a big stone hit his foot, Wu's tears came out!The sickle flew fast, and Wu's feet were also smashed fast. People could hardly see what happened.You know, there hasn't been such a big stir in the village for a long time.All of them turned around and saw Gu Jiao come forward calmly.She was carrying a small basket on her back. Her thin figure seemed harmless to people and animals, but her cold eyes showed a murderous air for no reason.People involuntarily shrunk their necks and automatically gave her a way.God knows how she threw the sickle. If she didn't throw it on the door, would it be on the back of whose head?Thinking about this, everyone can't help feeling chilly in the back of their headsLiu took the lead to react and scolded: \"you've come back just right, pretty girl! Let the crazy woman open the door! Look how she sucks you\"Chi ~\" Gu Jiao sneered coldly, \"the old man's eyes are not good. Is the second aunt blind when she is young? Who brought this stone and who hit it on her feet? Don't you count it in your heart? \"Liu's eyes were dumbfounded.This, this girl how can be so to hate a person?If she was stupid when she pulled Gu Dashun and kicked Gu Xiaoshun, it would be a good way to tear her face from Gu's family to scold her and Wu for being blind in public.\"You smelly girl! Dare to scold you? \" Wu was about to move forward when he rolled up his sleeve, but he almost fell to the ground in pain.Zhou helped his mother-in-law: \"mother, be careful!\"Wu's pain and anger, pointing to Gu Jiao nose scolded: \"little beast! Why didn't you drown in the first placeAt this time, Xiao LIULANG came.Recently, Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao have been playing each other frequently. The village has long been saying that they are getting better again, but he has never responded positively. So many people still guess that everything is just the wishful thinking of Gu Jiao.\"LIULANG, look at what your aunt and concubine have done. You are so old...\" the Zhou family reproached Xiao LIULANG.Unexpectedly, before she finished speaking, Xiao LIULANG said: 'since you are old, don't come out to hang around.\"Zhou suspected that he had heard wrong!\"What's the matter with you?\" Xiao LIULANG goes to Gu Jiao and asks.\"No Gu Jiao shakes her head and takes down the sickle on the door.Xiao LIULANG said to the door, \"aunt, we are back.\"The door creaked open.Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao go in.People look at each other face to face, they just have no eyes, right? Is Xiao LIULANG really talking to Gu fool? And ask her if she's ok? They're really good at it?!After entering the house, Xiao LIULANG closed the door, but it was not tightly closed. He could be heard speaking slowly: \"I'll report this kind of thing to the official in the future, and I'll go to the Yamen to write the paper myself.\"As soon as the words came out, the three Wu family members who had planned to rush in were directly nailed.Can this kind of thing be reported to the government? Xiao LIULANG's speech is so straightforward... Should, should be able to repay it?The little cripple's heart is so black!\"Niang, things in the third room...\" Zhou's whispered reminder.The original separation was really tricky. The dowry of Sanfang's field and the third daughter-in-law were deducted by them. They really went to the Yamen for fear of being found out.Wu clenched his teeth and walked away with his two daughters-in-law.The parties have all gone, and the theatre goers have gone home.Gu Ershun also left. Only Gu Xiaoshun walked around the village and ran into his elder sister and brother-in-law's house.Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG are sitting on the chair in the main room, and the old lady is sitting on the bench opposite them. She is still eating melon seeds with her legs crossed. She has no consciousness to explain why she is making trouble.In fact, not only do people in the village think that Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG are different from what they imagined, but even they think that they have lost sight of the old lady, OK?Gu Jiaozhen thought she was Alzheimer's disease, but she was a full-time expert airborne novice village just now. OK?\"Are you pretending these days?\" Gu Jiao asked.The old lady said angrily, \"is that how you talk to your aunt?\"Are you addicted to acting?No, it doesn't look like it was.Gu Jiao said seriously to Gu Xiaoshun, \"come with me.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: 27Gu Jiao closed the door: \"tell me, what happened all day today?\"Gu Xiaoshun honestly explained his nursing experience.It turned out that the old lady really didn't remember. She woke up at Gu Jiao's and Xiao LIULANG's home, and thought she was the person in the family. She clawed the melon seeds and asked Gu Xiaoshun, \"which of the two unfilial sons is my grandson?\"Gu Xiaoshun kept in mind his elder sister's advice and didn't dare to tell the old lady that you actually got leprosy.But he can't really say that his sister and brother-in-law are her grandchildren. In a hurry, he said, \"you're my brother-in-law's aunt. You've come all the way to join him.\".Also Gu Jiao did not expect that the old lady is not Alzheimer's, did not give Gu Xiaoshun a set of words to deal with her.\"Then she said, how does this family look like your sister is in charge? I said, that's not right? My brother-in-law is a burden! She asked again, why didn't you see anyone else? I'll say you're separated. \"Hear here, Gu Jiao straight help forehead, this family where is she in charge? She and Xiao LIULANG have been busy all the time. They only have dinner together occasionally.Xiaoshun, these two goods, have been talked about by the old lady.No wonder the old lady didn't stop when she complained about taking care of her family. She knew the enemy's situation from Gu Xiaoshun.\"Why did she always treat me with indifference when I asked her before?\" She thinks she's slow.Gu Xiaoshun said: 'she said you are not filial, do not want to pay attention to you!\"Gu JiaoDidn't you just give her a few less preserves?Gu Jiao came to the main room. It was obvious that Xiao LIULANG had already talked with the old lady. I don't know what Xiao LIULANG said. The old lady was a little listless without her superior air.\"I'm so sleepy after a quarrel. I'll go to bed first and call me when the meal is ready!\" The old lady snorted, threw a big butt to several people, and went back to the house to feel sleepy.Gu Jiao looks at Xiao LIULANG.Xiao LIULANG paused and said: \"at the beginning, the doctor said that the medicine should be taken according to the prescription for one year, but if it recovers quickly, it will lose its infectivity in one month.\"He didn't strongly persuade Gu Jiao to leave her, but just told her that she would not be handed down soon, hoping that Gu Jiao would continue to accept her.Gu Jiao didn't know that this little black sesame dumpling also showed pity for strangers.Maybe the old lady reminds him of his elder brother who died early.\"Well, let my aunt stay first.\" Gu Jiao said with a sigh.She didn't intend to drive her away.But it would be nice to sell him.For the time being, they recognized their aunt's identity, which is the safest way now.Facts proved that their decision was correct, because on that night, a group of officers and soldiers broke into Qingquan village and searched the patient who escaped from leprosy mountain door to door.The only stranger in the village was the old lady. When they learned that she had just come to the village recently, the officers and soldiers rushed into Gu Jiao's and Xiao LIULANG's home without saying a word.When the officers and soldiers came to the door, the old lady had finished eating and went to the house to heat up. The husband and wife were still eating at the table.A bowl of bacon fried cabbage, a plate of scallion egg cake, a pot of wild mushroom soup, a bowl of cold mixed black fungus and a dish of wine god dish peanuts.Of course, no one drinks.The aroma of bacon and scallion omelette made the soldiers hungry.\"Officials, what can I do for you?\" Asked Xiao LIULANG.The officers and soldiers looked back and said, \"I heard that an old lady has come to your house. Where is she?\"Xiao LIULANG took the man to the old lady's house: \"my aunt just came from Su County a few days ago.\"As she said this, she came forward and took the old lady's plate, which she had no time to hide. \"You've been eating candies again. Don't you mean you're too old to eat too many sweets?\"\"Hum.\" The old lady was caught and turned her face away with resentment.The officers and soldiers did not have any portraits of leprosy patients, but they told us about her features. They said that her face and the back of her hands had already appeared leprosy erythema, her face was sallow, and her spirit was poor.At present, the old lady is not the same except for her age.There is no leprosy spots, but also ruddy complexion, the spirit is not as good as words.Leprosy can not be cured. Some prescriptions can delay the onset of leprosy, but it is impossible to make the other party recover so well in just ten days.Most of the officials' suspicions were gone, and seeing that Xiao LIULANG didn't avoid and dislike the old lady, he felt even more unlikely.But the leader didn't dare to take it lightly. He went to the stove again, pointed to the medicine jar on the stove and said, \"whose medicine?\"Xiao LIULANG said: \"mine, I have a leg injury. This is the medicine I went to the town medical school to get.\"\"Show me the medicine bag.\" He said.Gu Jiao went to get the medicine bag.The man opened a bag and found Sanqi in it.Panax notoginseng is a very common medicinal material for activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Martial arts practitioners are not unfamiliar with it. In addition, safflower is also a common wound medicine.With these two herbs, it can be basically determined that they are not for the treatment of leprosy.\"What's your name?\" Asked the man.\"Xiao LIULANG.\" Xiao Liulang said in a straight voice, \"if a few officials have doubts about my identity, they can go to Tianxiang academy to find the registered residence of the dean.\"The man frowned: \"the dean of Tianxiang academy? Is his surname Li\"That's right.\" Xiao LIULANG said.The officials exchanged a look and were more polite to Xiao LIULANG.Generally speaking, registered residence does not have to run to the Dean, and Xiao Liu Lang has specifically moved him out, telling him that he is the one to be covered by President Li.Although Xiao LIULANG didn't want to be the apprentice of the president, it didn't prevent him from pretending to be powerful.Thick skinned, no pressure at all.President Li's name is still very easy to use. The officers asked a few routine questions and then withdrew.But the officers and soldiers did not go far, but sent a person to quietly turn back, into the next door Xue Ningxiang's home.\"Is the old lady next door really the boy's aunt?\"\"Yes.\"\"When did you come?\"\"Just a few days ago.\" Xue said.\"How did I hear it was ten days ago?\" The officers and soldiers stare at Xue Ningxiang's eyes and ask.Xue Ningxiang said, \"who did you listen to? I live next door. Why don't I know? \"The officers and soldiers looked at Xue Ningxiang's one year old son in his arms. The cold light flashed in his eyes, but he finally left.Xue Ningxiang's back was drenched with cold sweat.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: 28The old lady did come ten days ago, but in the first few days she was out of her mind and didn't remember that she came so early. So Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG delayed the arrival of the old lady a few days later.This is different from the days when the old lady disappeared in Qingquan town.What Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG don't know is that Xue Ningxiang heard the news when the old lady fell in front of Gu Jiao's door.She thought something was wrong with that man at that time\"Ah Xiang.\" Mother in law's voice came from the next room.Xue Ningxiang calmed down and went to her mother-in-law's house: \"Niang, are you awake?\"\"I just heard someone in the room. Is something wrong with the second one?\" One of the two sons has disappeared, and the old man's biggest worry now is his younger son, who is going to be a soldier.Xue Ningxiang said in a low voice: 'second brother is OK. It's the patient on leprosy mountain who has run away. The officers and soldiers have come to search us and gone.\"\"Men and women? How old are you? \"\"No,\" he said Xue Ningxiang said.\"Where can leprosy patients come to us... Cough...\" Xue Ningxiang's mother-in-law coughed violently twice, mumbled a few words and fell asleep.Xue Ningxiang closed her eyes.Although she is not a good thing, Gu Jiao has saved her life.The official search did not cause an uproar in Qingquan village. We have taken photos.Gu Jiao occasionally thinks that the old lady has a lot of history, otherwise how could she attract so many officers to search and not disclose any information about her.But Gu Jiao looked at the old lady with a can of melon seeds in her arms, who was like a squirrel, and she felt that she was thinking too much.Gu Jiao has nothing to do and mends all Xiao LIULANG's clothes at home.What she expected was right. If she treated cloth as human skin, it would be much better!When Xiao LIULANG came back home, he found that his rags had been mended. It was Gu Jiao who mended them.Gu Jiao had never sewed and mended clothes before, at least he didn't see it after he came, but unexpectedly, the mending was good, the stitches were fine, even and neat. The only thing that puzzled people was that other people's sewing threads were all inside. How could she leave all the threads outside when she sewed clothes?The old lady's recovery is much better than brother Xiao LIULANG's at the beginning. Xiao LIULANG once asked the doctor how long he could lose his infectivity according to the speed of his brother's recovery. The doctor said it would take one month. Although the old lady took the medicine for less than a month, it has far exceeded the curative effect of a month, and she has been able to eat at the same table.What Xiao didn't expect was that the old lady almost choked him to death the first time he ate at the same table.\"I said The old lady drank a mouthful of corn keel soup, \"what's the matter with you two? I've been here so long, and I haven't seen you two rooming together. \"Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao choke together.\"Xianggong is still young.\" Gu Jiao said without changing her face.The old lady looked up and down at Xiao LIULANG and nodded, \"it's too small to empty her body.\"Xiao LIULANG--However, after Wu's mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were killed in the hands of the old lady, people in the village speculated whether they would find a chance to get the place back, but they didn't go out for several days.In fact, they didn't want to come out, but Mr. Gu didn't allow them to come out.What happened last time was very big, and then it came to Mr. Gu's ears.Before the third brother died, he promised to take good care of Gu Jiao. Although he didn't say it orally, it meant that he would keep Gu Jiao by his side for the rest of his life and recruit a redundant son-in-law in the future.The main reason for breaking the original promise is to believe that Gu Jiao is a killer. She has already killed the third and the third daughter-in-law. She can no longer be allowed to conquer them in Dashun.But Gu never connived at Wu's asking Gu Jiao and his wife for a family. Wu told him that Xiao LIULANG himself had to be filial to him and that he had to study for Dashun.Mr. Gu believed it.Now I know the truth. Mr. Gu really feels ashamed: \"in the future, LIULANG will study himself. Don't worry about his money any more!\"Wu's hematemesis.Wu said: \"what can a lame man read? It's just a waste of money. I heard that he failed the exam again this time! It's better to give the money to Dashun. If Dashun is developed in the future, it will surely take care of him! \"Her Dashun is going to be the master of the whole family in the future. The master of the whole family can enjoy a meal at will. It's enough for the little lame family to live.Mr. Gu still wants face. The villagers have broken his spine behind his back. If they ask him to ask his grandson-in-law for money, he can't do it.Gu warned Wu not to bring his daughter-in-law to Gu's house to cause trouble.It's not only Wu's mother-in-law and daughter-in-law who have had a bad time these days, but Gu Dashun has also suffered the first blow of his life.At last, he knew who the president wanted to be. It was Xiao LIULANG, whom he would not have expected to kill.Xiao LIULANG is disabled, but he is also shallow. He is good for nothing except his face.He didn't understand how this kind of scum got into the eyes of the dean?Gu Dashun began to recall the change in the president's attitude towards himself. At first, the president praised him more than once and met him alone. But after Xiao LIULANG went to see the president, the president ignored him.He asked himself that there was nothing dissatisfied with the dean in terms of talent and learning.Did Xiao LIULANG arrange something in front of the Dean, which made the Dean think that his virtue was deficient and disgusted him?It must be!Otherwise, why does the Dean want Xiao LIULANG, who is at the bottom of the list?Looking at a person, I didn't expect to be so insidious!Thinking that Xiao LIULANG robbed his own things, Gu Dashun felt that Xiao LIULANG was too mean.\"Xiao LIULANG, wait for me!\"--That night, Gu Jiao had a dream again.Not surprisingly, she dreamed of Xiao LIULANG again.Xiao LIULANG's book happened to be finished, and he sent it to his study at noon. Unexpectedly, there is a case of theft in the study, which is suspected to be on Xiao LIULANG's head.In fact, there was an eyewitness at that time, Gu Dashun. Gu saw with his own eyes that Xiao LIULANG left before the owner entered the study. He also knew that Xiao LIULANG had never entered the owner's room.But Gu Dashun refused to tell the truth and insisted that only Xiao LIULANG went up to the second floor. Although this does not directly prove that Xiao LIULANG is a thief, it eliminates the suspicion of others.However, Xiao LIULANG was not a vegetarian either. He solved the case according to several footprints in the backyard.As the incident progressed here, it was said that it was over. But because of the delay in investigating the case, Xiao LIULANG caught up with a snowstorm when he returned to the village.On the way, the mule car skidded into the ditch and broke Xiao LIULANG's face.The ferocious scar accompanied Xiao LIULANG's whole life and left him an indelible shadow.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: 29The next day, Gu Jiao woke up and sat in bed for a long time.This time, she was not dazzled by her dreams, but by the luck of her husband.What kind of young people?Is that bad luck?What's more, what's destroyed this time is the beauty of the golden age. It's not OK, absolutely not!The whole thing is because Gu Dashun gets in the way. If it wasn't for his false testimony, Xiao LIULANG would not have delayed his return to the village in order to prove his innocence. As a result, he caught up with the heavy snow, had an accident and ruined a good handsome face.\u2026\u2026When Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG had breakfast, the old lady was still sleeping in her room before dawn. Gu Jiao gently sent Xiao LIULANG out of the door.\"It's going to snow today. Wear more.\" Gu Jiao gave him a robe.Xiao LIULANG looked at the stars all over the night sky. He didn't feel like it was going to snow, but he still took her robe: \"thank you very much.\"Gu Jiao sent him to the village as usual.Xiao LIULANG gets on the ox cart, and Gu Jiao waits with him until Gu Xiaoshun comes over with a book bag in his arms.Gu Jiao knows that Xiao LIULANG will go to the study this afternoon and that he will be framed, but she doesn't remind him not to go.She remembers the details of Xiao LIULANG's case, so she knows where the thief went with the stolen goods.\u2026\u2026\"I'm hot in the pot. If I'm hungry, I'll eat by myself. There's also medicine. I can't eat less than one meal. If you pour it out, I'll know.\" In the main room, Gu Jiao said to the old lady.Since the old lady is not really senile dementia, there is no need to guard her. Anyway, she is not infected now. I don't worry about who will be harmed. As for saying that others will harm her? It doesn't exist.The old lady snorted.Gu Jiao went out with a basket on her back. When she passed by Gu's mansion, she happened to meet Gu yue'e, who came out to wash her face.\"Good morning, sister Yuee.\" She said hello.Gu yue'e is influenced by her mother and ER Fang. She is not close to Gu Jiao. Seeing that Gu Jiao takes the initiative to say hello to herself, she doesn't say anything and goes to the house.\"Who's talking?\" Zhou asked.\"Pretty girl.\" Gu Yuee whispered.Zhou Shua opened the door.Gu Jiao and she also said hello: \"good morning, uncle and mother.\"\"Er... Morning, morning.\" Zhou claimed to be a scholar's mother, more polite than Liu. She looked at Gu Jiao with a basket on her back and said with a smile, \"Jiao Niang, where are you going so early?\"Gu Jiao said with a smile, \"I'll pick some mountain goods from the mountains and then take them to the town to sell.\"Zhou's eyes turned and said with a smile, \"do you sell mountain goods for money? I heard that mountain products are poisonous... \"\"I know which ones are not poisonous. My husband taught me.\" No one would believe it if they knew it.A few days ago, the three of Zhou's family came to make a scene. At that time, she could see the things in Gu Jiao's basket. They were melon seeds, candied fruits, brown sugar and peanuts. How much did it cost? I'm afraid the girl earned a lot of money selling mountain goods.Zhou's eyes flashed and he said with a smile, \"can you bring your aunt with you, my darling? You can't pick that many by yourself, can you? Aunt, help you to pick it\"Good.\" Gu Jiao responded generously.Zhou's smile, a fool is a fool, good coax very, wait for oneself to recognize all the mountain goods, where there is her share?This kind of good thing Zhou won't call Liu, but Liu himself heard, carrying a basket came out: 'second aunt also go!\"\"Good.\" Gu Jiao smiles.Gu Jiao and her two aunts went to the mountain to pick mushrooms.In fact, she can pick some fungus and poisonous mushroom to sell them, but that will harm innocent people, she is not so wicked.She took the two of them to pick some common winter mushrooms and filled several people's baskets and baskets before leaving contentedly.\"Can it really sell for money?\" Zhou asked suspiciously.\"Aunt, just go with me. It's easy to sell.\" Gu Jiao said.Zhou wanted to go alone. She decided how much she had sold. She didn't have to give it all to her family. Unfortunately, Liu also had this idea. As a result, both of them followed Gu Jiao.\"Jiaoniang, this is not the way to the market.\" On the way, Liu asked Gu Jiao strangely.Gu Jiao said: \"this time the market is closing. Let's go to the market in Zhendong, where the price is higher.\"As soon as they heard that they could sell more money, they said something more.Passing by an alley, Gu Jiao suddenly said, \"I'm going to the toilet. My eldest aunt and second aunt will wait for me for a while.\"\"Go ahead, go ahead.\" Zhou said.Liu Shibi muttered: \"lazy people have a lot of feces and urine!\"Gu Jiao went through the alley, came to the back door of the rejuvenation hall, opened the door and went in.A quarter of an hour later, Gu Jiao came back.\"Why so long?\" Liu was dissatisfied.Gu Jiao light smile: \"eat bad belly.\"Zhou said: \"well, where is the market, jiaoniang? Let's go and sell the mountain goods quickly. Don't be fresh for a while!\"\"Well.\" Gu Jiao nodded with a smile.Gu Jiao takes them forward.Suddenly, a figure came out of the side lane. Gu Jiao didn't dodge and ran into the man.The man was knocked to the ground.Gu jiaoshua took out the sickle: \"do you dare to bump me?\"That person is confused, girl. Who are we going to bump into?Gu Jiao doesn't care. She cuts at the man with a scythe. The two sides fight together quickly. The man's burden was knocked off by Gu Jiao, but he didn't have time to pick it up. He was chased hundreds of meters away by Gu Jiao.Zhou and Liu itched to open the bag that fell on the ground, and saw the white silver inside. They immediately became greedy.They didn't steal or rob the silver. They picked it up in the street.It's theirs!Two people tacitly, decided to pick up and go, not to leave a little fool!Two people scrambled to get up, in order to who can get more, but also a solid fight!--On the other side of the Academy, Xiao LIULANG went to Yipin pavilion with the copied book after dinner.There are many study rooms in Qingquan Town, but the biggest one is this one. Even at noon, the business is still very good.The books copied by Xiao LIULANG are best sold. Everyone in the study knows him.A waiter is very polite to welcome up: \"the shopkeeper is not here, you go to the second floor of the accounting room for a moment?\"Xiao LIULANG was about to enter the door. Suddenly, a man called him after himself: \"is it Mr. Xiao?\"Xiao LIULANG turned around.\"Young master Xiao, do you remember the little one?\" The man asked with a smile.\"I remember.\" Xiao LIULANG nodded, \"you are from huichuntang. What's the matter?\"The man said, \"well, I caught some wrong prescriptions for you last time. Shopkeeper Wang asked me to come to see Mr. Xiao. I don't know if Mr. Xiao is free now. Come with me to the rejuvenation hall to get some medicine. By the way, let the doctor show you again.\"Generally speaking, if you take the wrong medicine and send it directly, huichuntang offers to see Xiao LIULANG for free, which sounds like an apology.No problem.Xiao LIULANG and the staff of the rejuvenation hall leave, and Gu Dashun takes back his disgusting eyes behind the bookshelf.Xiao LIULANG went to the rejuvenation hall to get the medicine and look at his legs. The man personally took him back to the college. But as soon as they got out of the carriage, they heard the students outside the college whispering.\"Did you hear that? There has been a theft in the study. The thief is a freshman in the tianzijia class of our college. \"\"Freshmen in class a? What's your name? \"\"Gu Dashun!\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: 30This time, Xiao LIULANG was picked up by the staff of the rejuvenation hall before he even entered the door of his study. Then he went to the rejuvenation hall to apply for medicine. The whole rejuvenation hall can testify, and naturally no one doubts him.Gu Dashun was different. Someone saw him go up to the second floor, and the owner's room was also on the second floor.At that time, the owner happened to go out. There was no one on the second floor except Gu Dashun.Everyone who has been to the study knows that the second floor is your wing room except the accounting room, which is not open to everyone. Poor students like Gu Dashun should not appear on the second floor.Gu Dashun cried out: \"it was a master who asked me to choose some books to send to him! He said he would talk to me about poetry and Taoism! \"Gu Dashun was also an ambitious student. He knew very early that his status as a scholar would bring many conveniences to his future. Even some people would come to make friends with him, so he had no doubt at that time.\"Who are you talking about? Call him out Said the man in the study.Gu Dashun said anxiously, \"when I went upstairs, he was no longer there!\"\"Who... Have you met any master?\" The man in the study asked the crowd.The crowd shook their heads.They only noticed Gu Dashun because he was wearing the uniform of Tianxiang Academy. The students of Tianxiang Academy were very attractive everywhere.But Gu Dashun's conversation with the master took place on his way to Chugong. There was no witness on that part of the way.So, people only see Gu Dashun holding a book on the second floor, did not see Gu Dashun was invited.That's killing me.The young man said: \"I didn't expect that the students of Tianxiang academy would do such a dirty thing. There are very valuable things in my childe's burden. If you take the money ticket from my childe, you can't care about it, but you must return the letter! Otherwise, we'll report to the official! \"Gu Dashun was wronged and died. For today's sake, we have to find the master. However, the other party seems to have evaporated in the world, and we can't find him.Gu Dashun had an idea: \"you said I stole something. Where is the stolen goods? I will never eat itThe chief constable squinted: 'search his house!\"Gu Dashun didn't worry about his search. He was not afraid of the shadow. Even if he turned his house upside down, he didn't have the stolen goods!As a result, Gu Dashun was slapped in the face.When the captors rushed into Gu's house, Zhou and Liu just got home and were digging a hole in the backyard to bury silver.The captors quickly recognized that these were the official silver lost by the owner.In Gu Jiao's dream, Xiao LIULANG judged that the murderer was climbing the window through the footprints of the backyard grass and the outer wall. He was six feet tall. The right footprints are deeper than the left footprints. It is speculated that the killer's left foot is slightly lame, but it is not serious. Otherwise, he can't step on the second floor of the wall, and the killer has certain skills.Part of the footprints at the scene of the crime left a small gravel mixed with lime and sandalwood. This is the only sand road in casinos. It was originally used to ward off evil spirits.Therefore, thieves are either gamblers or gamblers. Sooner or later, they will go to gamblers near the market.Gu Jiao is only on the way to the market.It's a pity that Gu Dashun is not Xiao LIULANG. He can't solve the case and prove his innocence. He can only watch himself, Zhou's and Liu's being put into prison.\"Oh, dear.\" In the accounting room of huichuntang, the second owner drinks tea leisurely, and looks very happy.Shopkeeper Wang angrily glanced at him and said, \"if you hurt someone, are you so happy?\"Yes, the second owner is the mysterious master who fooled Gu Dashun into the second floor.The second owner grinned and held out three fingers: \"not one, but three.\"Shopkeeper Wang shuddered: \"that girl's heart is really cruel. She doesn't even blink from her family. Should we be... Careful when we cooperate with such people?\"The second owner looked at the flowing Street: \"what do you know? If you haven't experienced the pain of others, don't try to persuade others to be kind. \"Shopkeeper Wang doesn't understand this. Although he works for the second master, he doesn't know much about the second master. He only knows that he is the legitimate son of the Hu family, but he doesn't seem to be valued by the old man.The second owner took a sip of tea with a smile: \"I really like this girl more and more.\"--Because it had nothing to do with Xiao LIULANG himself, he didn't ask much about it. He only knew that Gu Dashun had stolen people's things. As for who he had stolen and what he had stolen, he didn't know.However, after all, he went to the study. The Dean called him to the central hall to learn about Gu Dashun.\"When you go to the study, can you see Gu Dashun?\" Asked the president.Xiao LIULANG said, \"yes, but I left for the rejuvenation hall at a quarter past noon. I don't know what happened after that.\"That's the truth.After a pause, the dean said, \"can you see Gu Dashun talking to someone in the backyard?\"Xiao LIULANG shook his head: \"I didn't go to the backyard.\"The Dean pressed the brow with a headache: \"OK, I see. Go back to the classroom first.\"Xiao LIULANG turned and left. As soon as he got to the door, the dean said again, \"do you think Gu Dashun really can steal?\"Xiao Liu Lang said, \"this is not like I has the final say.\"Yes, the owner has reported the case to the government. The Yamen has already put the case on file. We have to tell the evidence whether we can steal or not, but all the evidence points to Gu DashunAfter Xiao LIULANG left the central hall, he was called to ask by Chen Fuzi of tianzijia class. After Chen Fuzi asked, Zhang Fuzi of his own class also asked him. Most of them asked him about Gu Dashun.It's getting late after all this trouble.The heavy snow was falling.It really snowed.Xiao LIULANG looked at the snowy sky and walked towards the entrance of the Academy. As soon as he came out, he saw a thin figure.Wearing a small apricot jacket and carrying a small basket, he lowered his head and ran his feet over the small stones on the ground. He looked a little clever.Xiao LIULANG's eyes moved, clutching his walking stick.Gu Jiao saw him, smile: 'school?\"\"Well.\"Thought of what, Gu Jiao way: \"just can't wait for you, I let Luo Er Shu and Xiao Shun go back first.\"\"It's OK. I'll hire a car.\" Xiao LIULANG said.Gu Jiao gently pulled his sleeve with her soft fingertips: \"it's snowy. It's not safe to drive. Let's find an inn for one night.\"Xiao LIULANG looked at the scallion fingertips on his sleeve and said: \"good.\"Xu is approaching the end of the year, the inn is full, two people asked several, finally found a can stay in the inn.Xiao LIULANG said, \"two guest rooms.\"\"My guest, there is only one room.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: 31When they heard that it was the last room, they were stunned.The second child looked at them in doubt: \"what are you hesitating about? I don't mean to say that all the inns are doing very well at the end of the new year. In addition to the sudden heavy snow today, many foreign merchants and guests are stranded in our town. You two can't pick and choose any more! \"They asked all the way where they didn't understand the urgency of the guest room, but... It seemed a little inappropriate.A tangled color appeared between Xiao LIULANG's eyebrows.As for Gu Jiao... She is not entangled at all. They are legal husband and wife. What's the matter with them? Besides, she didn't rush to sleep with him. There was no room left, right?However, she was very cooperative and showed the same tangled color as him, which made her more clever.Most of the time, Xiao LIULANG is also a soft person. She looks like a harmless rabbit, revealing a trace of obedience.At this time, it's a bit hard to pull her thin body to find an inn in the snow.Xiao LIULANG calmed down: \"then stay.\"The second child led them to the wing room on the second floor.It's not unreasonable that it will be the last remaining wing room. The room is small and cold, but considering the heavy snow, the inn gave them a basin of charcoal fire for free.The price is 200 Wen.It's usually 100 Wen, but the price goes up during the new year.The second child put down the charcoal fire and left. When he left, he told them that they could go to the lobby for dinner, or they could be sent directly to the room.Well, there was room service. Gu Jiao was surprised.But Gu Jiao didn't eat in the inn. She pushed open the window and leaned on the windowsill, drooling at a small stall selling sweet scented osmanthus cakes at the entrance of the opposite alley.She found that she had some changes with her previous life. For example, she did not like sweet or spicy food in her previous life, but she came here and became very fond of sweet scented osmanthus cake and pickles.\"Want to eat sweet scented osmanthus cake?\" Xiao LIULANG was beside her and saw her drooling.Gu Jiao nodded: \"well.\"In fact, Gu Jiao is not so greedy, at least not so greedy in Xiao LIULANG's eyes. But this period of time together, let Gu Jiao found a fact, that is, he seems to be difficult to refuse his good appearance.Xiao LIULANG takes Gu Jiao out of the inn.The snow outside is getting bigger and bigger, but the wind has stopped, and the snowflakes are falling quietly, with a sense of tranquility.Xiao LIULANG is more beautiful in the snow, and the pedestrians on the road can hardly move their eyes.In the morning, Gu Jiao reminds Xiao LIULANG to bring more robes, but she forgets them when she goes out. In addition, this small body is really colder than her previous life. Therefore, her shivering is not an act.Xiao LIULANG walked in front of her and looked back at her. After a pause, he took off his robe and handed it to her.She opened her eyes and looked at him innocently, as if she didn't understand him: \"ah?\"Xiao LIULANG opened his mouth and frowned, but it seemed that he had no choice but to put his robe on her.His body temperature and a faint fragrance remained on his robe, warm and pleasant.Gu jiaoshui's eyes blinked: \"thank you very much.\"The voice is soft and sweet.I'm very excited.Xiao LIULANG didn't speak, but Gu Jiao noticed that his pace slowed down.Yo, do you know how to wait for her?When they came across the street to the stall, they found that they not only bought sweet scented osmanthus cakes, but also sold steaming tangyuan.Gu Jiao's eyes can't deceive people, almost can shine.Xiao LIULANG asked for two bowls of rice wine dumplings and sat down with Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao let the boss beat a pocketed egg.The boss thought she wanted to eat, so he beat it in her bowl. But when the dumplings were brought up, Gu Jiao scooped out the poached eggs with a spoon and put them into Xiao LIULANG's bowl.Poor family, they rarely eat outside, see Gu Jiao the only poached eggs to their own, Xiao LIULANG's eyes across a trace of complexity.\"Boss, another poached egg.\"His voice is low and moist, and it sounds a little colder in the wind and snow.The boss was moved by the affection of the couple. He specially cooked the poached egg big and beautiful.Gu Jiao silently took the spoon to poke that yellow orange pouch egg.What? She really just hates poached eggsAfter eating dumplings and poached eggs, they went back to the inn, Gu Jiao's arms with the box of sweet scented osmanthus cake.Originally, it was for the sweet scented osmanthus cake. As a result, a bowl of Tangyuan and a poached egg were all full.There is a charcoal basin in the room. It's not too cold. Gu Jiao takes off her robe and calls the second child to serve a pot of hot tea.The little two asked if they wanted hot water.Gu Jiao asked for some.After washing, they were ready to rest.There's only one bed here. It's freezing. It's impossible to make a bunk on the ground. It will freeze to death. There are two quilts. Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG built one.Cover up, Gu Jiao just understand why to prepare two quilts, not because they have two people, but because a quilt is too cold.Gu Jiao was too cold to sleep, her hands and feet were cold.She listened to Xiao LIULANG's breathing and knew that he was not asleep.\"What...\" Gu Jiao wanted to call him, but she found that she didn't formally call him until now. Of course, he didn't call himself, as if they didn't know what relationship they had.Husband and wife? nofriend? Neither.Gun... No, it's not!In the end, Gu Jiao decided to make it difficult for her to call him Xianggong.\"Xianggong.\"The first time I yelled, I was a little unskillful, and I had a bad voice.Xiao LIULANG didn't respond for a long time. He was probably surprised by the sound.For a long time, he asked in a low voice, \"what's the matter?\"\"Are you cold?\" Gu Jiao asked.\"You're cold?\" Xiao LIULANG asked.\"Well.\" Gu Jiao's voice in the night sounds fine, with a trace of cold after the small nasal.Xiao LIULANG hesitated for a moment, but he divided half of his quilt and covered her quilt.Gu Jiao in line with the principle that you divide me and I also divide you, put his own quilt on him, and then their quilt completely shared.The boy's body is hot, like a small stove.Gu Jiao felt much warmer in an instant.Xiao LIULANG was a little stunned, and seemed to be hesitant about kicking this uninvited guest out of his quilt.\"Xianggong, I'm not cold.\"The girl's voice is soft, with a little bit of naivety and satisfaction.Xiao LIULANG... Can't kick.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: 32Gu Jiao had never shared a bed with anyone in her previous life, even her roommate. She thought she would not be able to sleep, but she soon fell asleep in that reassuring atmosphere.She went to see Duke Zhou, but Xiao LIULANG didn't fall asleep so soon.He looked at Gu Jiao lying beside him. The thin snow light fell on her face through the window paper. She lay on her side, and the half face with birthmark was pressed under.She is really afraid of cold, her face is red with cold, her eyelashes are very long, and her facial features are delicate. If there is no birthmark, she should be a beautiful and refined girl.Inexplicably, Xiao LIULANG's heart flashed a trace of regret.But soon, he frowned again, erasing the emotion from the bottom of his heart.Xiao LIULANG's sleeping appearance was excellent, and he hardly moved all night.Gu Jiao is also a good girl. She is getting closer to Xiao LIULANG, hugs him with her hands and feet, and pillows her head on Xiao LIULANG's shoulder.Gu Jiao slept until daybreak. When she woke up, Xiao LIULANG had already got up and was sitting by the window reading a book.The sky is shining through the window paper, reflecting his handsome face like jade. I don't know if it's Gu Jiao's illusion. I feel that he seems to blush a little.\"You wake up.\" Xiao LIULANG said hello to Gu Jiao solemnly, but he didn't look at Gu Jiao on the bed.\"Well, wake up, good morning.\" Gu Jiao rubbed her eyes and yawned. As soon as she woke up, she was still in a daze, unconsciously with a lazy little milk sound.Early in the morning, normal men who can stand this?Xiao LIULANG only felt his chest rise, and almost stood up: \"I'll go to buy breakfast!\"After that, she opened the door and went out, leaving Gu Jiao with a small head.The snow stopped in the middle of the night. It's sunny today.Because today the Academy was off and they had breakfast, they hired a mule cart to go back to the village.When passing by the entrance of the village, I heard the villagers who were drawing water from the ancient well saying: it snowed suddenly yesterday, and many people who came back to the village at night were injured. In the next village, there were people who turned mule carts into sewers. I heard that people had lost half their lives.Xiao LIULANG thought of hiring a car to go back to the village last night. If she hadn't offered to stay in the inn for one night, they might have suffered an accident.Xiao LIULANG doesn't know what to say.After all... This is the third time that she's survived.They went home.The old lady got up and was sitting in the hall sulking.Yesterday, Gu Jiao thought that it would end very early. She and Xiao LIULANG could come back before the snow, so she only left a lunch in the pot. Unexpectedly, the teachers of the Academy would come and pester Xiao LIULANG about the snow.In order to avoid the bad luck in her dream, she had to stay in the town with Xiao LIULANG.The old lady can't make a fire. She chewed cold steamed bread last night and cold steamed bread again this morning. Her teeth are almost exhausted!Gu jiaoting wondered, you say you are a poor old lady, how can't you make a fire? Are you the old lady of a wealthy family or the Empress Dowager?Gu Jiao silently took out a packet of preserves and a box of sweet scented osmanthus cakes: \"you are allowed to eat two more today.\"Old lady: \"no! FiveGu Jiao: \"three.\"Old lady: \"deal!\"The old lady, holding the candied fruit and sweet scented osmanthus cake, turned her back and began to eat.The story of Gu Dashun and Liu's arrest has long been spread in the village, and even the next village has come to watch the excitement. They don't know what it has to do with Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao, so they all go to Gu's old house to inquire about the news.At noon, two captors came to the door. They came to look for Gu Jiao.It turns out that after Zhou and Liu were arrested in the yamen, they honestly explained the origin of the silver under the severe interrogation: it was the man who fought with the little fool who fell off. They were greedy for a while, and then they went back to the village with the silver before the little fool came back.\"Ah, so it is. How can I go back without seeing the two aunts?\" Gu Jiao said suddenly.The constable looked at him and said, \"Why are you fighting?\"Gu Jiao said coldly: \"he hit me! You are teasing me! And scold meBeing hit and scolded, he chased people with a sickle and cut down a few streets. Girl, you are a hero.For others to do so, the captors are afraid to be suspicious. However, they have learned from Zhou's and Liu's that Gu Jiao is a fool, and his behavior can't be judged by common sense.Therefore, even here, no one doubts that Gu Jiao is deliberately squatting there waiting for a rabbit, and deliberately driving away the thieves, leaving money to the two of Zhou's greedy. Even Zhou and Liu thought that everything was just an accident.Only Xiao LIULANG felt that everything was so coincidental.\"That man may be the thief. What happened to him in the end?\" Said the captor.\"He ran away.\" Gu Jiao shows her hand.\"Do you remember what he looked like?\" The constable asked again.\"He looks... Um...\" Gu Jiao recalled, while gesticulating, another captor is the Yamen painter, he drew the look of the thief, \"is that so?\"\"Well...\" Gu Jiao frowned.At this time, Xiao LIULANG came out with a picture.Gu Jiao's eyes brightened: \"yes! This is the manThe captor exchanged an awkward little look with the painter. Suddenly, the official painter couldn't draw a student. What's the feeling that his job was smashed?After getting the portrait, the Yamen solved the case quickly.However, Zhou and Liu were not immediately released by the Yamen. The reason is that when the Yamen's captors asked the Gu family where their silver came from, they vowed that they had sold mountain goods by themselves.A huge amount of money, together with lying and refusing to pay, properly constituted the crime of embezzlement, one person fined 20 Liang silver, beat 30 big board.As for Gu Dashun, his mother-in-law and second aunt made such a scandal, the family style is not right, he was also nailed to the stigma column.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: 33This time, Gu's family has broken their bones and muscles. Forty taels of silver have been confiscated, and Gu Dashun's painstaking management of renshe has also collapsed.For a long time, Gu family should not be able to find fault at home.Gu Jiao was very happy. She had half an extra bowl of dinner.On this afternoon, there was a little snow again, but it was not big. It stopped after a while, which did not affect the walking on the road. It was just a little cold. When Xiao LIULANG got home, his hands were frozen.Gu Jiao hands the cooked ginger soup to him.Even if it's frozen like this, he's not too quick to drink ginger soup. It's noble and elegant from his bones.Gu Jiao looked at him without blinking.\"What's the matter?\" He turned his head and asked.Gu Jiao, who was arrested, was not embarrassed at all. She said with a smile, \"it's OK. You can drink it. I'll take the meal!\"Gu Jiao brought out the hot food and asked the old lady to eat with her.Just halfway through the meal, an unexpected guest came to the house.\"I'll open the door.\" Gu Jiao put down her chopsticks.\"I'll do it.\" Xiao LIULANG stood up with her crutch.\"Eat yours.\" The old lady said to Gu Jiao.Although in the old lady's cognition, Xiao LIULANG is her nephew and granddaughter, Gu Jiao is only her granddaughter-in-law, she never favors Xiao LIULANG.Gu Jiao goes on to eat. Xiao LIULANG takes off the bolt and opens the door. He finds that it's not the villagers who are standing at the door, but a pair of young servants.The young man, with his luxurious clothes and noble temperament, is the master of a wealthy family.Xiao LIULANG had some accidents. Of course, they were also very surprised. They were looking for a girl who was looking for the family, but they never expected that it was a young man who opened the door.Wearing the white uniform of Tianxiang academy, he has a clean temperament and refined facial features.In such a remote place, there was such a delicate young man as jade. The master and servant were stunned for a moment.The young man said, \"excuse me... Is this Miss Gu's home?\"\"Who is your excellency? What can I do for my wife? \" Xiao LIULANG asked coldly.My wife?The young master was stunned again: \"my name is Qin...\"\"Xiao Qin Xianggong?\" Gu Jiao didn't know when she came over and looked at the young man outside the door strangely, \"Why are you here?\"When Xianggong saw that it was her, he almost turned around and ran away: \"it's my turn to ask you that! Why are you here! \"Gu Jiao said, \"this is my home. Where should I be if I'm not here?\"\"How can you be in Gu...\" in the middle of the conversation, Xianggong Xiaoqin suddenly realized something and said with a gape, \"you... Are you... Miss Gu?\"Gu Jiao pick eyebrow, touched to touch chin: \"originally you still don't know who I am.\"The white blind original master pestered him for so long, but he didn't even inquire about the identity of the original master.Xiao LIULANG's face became cold. He gave Xianggong a cold look and went into the room without looking back!Gu Jiao: \"ah --\"I feel that Xianggong is angry!Xianggong of Xiao Qin discovered Xiao LIULANG's leg disease, and he said, how can such a beautiful young man marry a little fool who doesn't obey the law of women? It turned out to be a lame man.\"What are you doing at my house?\" Gu Jiao asked coldly.Xiao Qin Xianggong then found another thing, that is, the little fool's eyes seem to have lost the previous craze for him, and the little fool doesn't look silly at all.\"If you have something to say, if you have nothing to do, walk slowly.\" Gu Jiao said that she was going to close the door.Xiao Qin Xianggong returned to his senses and held the door down and said, \"I came to ask if you have found a letter?\"The silver in his bundle was picked up by the Zhou family and Liu family, but there was no letter, so he left it on the street. The captors didn't find it, so they thought of the girl who had been back to the scene. Maybe she didn't find it.The captors didn't say that Gu's daughter was a little fool in Qingquan village, otherwise Xianggong of Xiao Qin would not come to him.After listening to Xiao Qin Xianggong's words, Gu Jiao was surprised.To be honest, she didn't expect the owner to be him. In her dream, she only went to see Xiao LIULANG. Where can she remember what the owner looked like?But she did find that letter.Gu Jiao turned to enter the room, turned out the letter, went out of the door and asked him, \"do you say this?\"Xiao Qin Xianggong's eyes brightened: \"you really picked it up! But why didn't you tell the captor? \"Gu Jiao showed her hand: \"the captor didn't ask.\"That's... yeah.The captor forgot.\"Oh.\" Gu Jiao generously gave him the letter.Xianggong of Xiao Qin took the letter quickly. The letter was sealed with wax, and there was no sign of passivity.The surprise of her recovery made Xianggong Xiaoqin change her mind. Maybe she did those stupid things just because her brain was not smart, but she was not bad in nature, and she was a good girl.\"Thank you so much!\" Xiao Qin Xianggong said sincerely.Gu Jiao glanced at him obliquely and said carelessly, \"just a word of thanks?\"Xiao Qin Xianggong was stunned.Gu Jiao said with a faint smile, \"don't you want something substantial, such as silver?\"Xiao Qin Xianggong is petrified.What about the girl who said she would pick up the money?A quarter of an hour later, Gu Jiao came into the house with a hundred taels of silver. This money is three times as much as Zhou's and Liu's, and Xiao Qin Xianggong is willing to give it, reasonable and legal!\"Why? What about Xianggong? \" Gu Jiao asked the old lady.The old lady pours at Xiao LIULANG's house.Gu Jiao pushed the door into the room.Xiao LIULANG is copying a book, his face is cold.Gu Jiao took the money and put it on Xiao LIULANG's desk.Xiao LIULANG didn't look at it.Gu Jiao whispered: \"angry?\"Xiao LIULANG lightly turned his back and ignored Gu Jiao.Gu jiaomeng is ruined by her proud appearance.Gu Jiao leaned over, bent down and sighed in his ear: \"you said I was young, how could I be blind? He is so ugly... \"Xiao LIULANG's eyelashes trembled slightly.So close that her breath fell on his earlobe.Gu Jiao whispered: \"I didn't know it was his letter. I picked it up casually, but I forgot it when I picked it up. Just now he came to me to get the letter. I mistook him for one hundred Liang. \"All the unhappiness in Xiao LIULANG's heart disappeared in the last sentence.It's all mistaken for Xianggong of Xiaoqin. It seems that he really gave up his heart.In fact, he shouldn't be angry. They are not really husband and wife. He will leave her and here one day. He didn't mind how she was with Xiao Qin. He shouldn't mind now.It's just that he can't tell what happened to his anger.Gu Jiao soft coax a way: \"not angry, I hereafter all don't see him.\"\"Look at it.\" Xiao LIULANG said coldly.Gu Jiao smiles and whispers in Xiao LIULANG's ear: \"he's not as good-looking as you.\"Xiao LIULANGPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: 34With the silver, Gu Jiao thought about what to do.The next day, when Xiao LIULANG came back from school, the family of three sat in the main room to eat.In fact, there is no relationship between them, but there is some strange harmony.The old lady gnawed a big chicken leg, glanced at Gu Jiao and said, \"if you have a word, just say it!\"Gu Jiao: the old lady has good eyesight. How can you tell she has something to say?\"I want to buy mountains.\" Gu Jiao said.\"Winter or autumn?\" The old lady gave Gu Jiao a small silent look, as if complaining about this little thing is also worth grinding haw.\"I'm not talking about clothes. I'm talking about mountains, the mountain behind our village.\" Gu Jiao always picks fungus and fungus on the mountain. She finds that there are many good things there. If she buys them, she will be able to pick mountain goods, collect medicine, cut trees and hunt... In a word, all the hillsides are valuable and will never lose money.\"Buy it!\"Surprisingly, the old lady didn't hesitate at all. She was really impeccable and generous in spending money.If you change this into the original owner's own milk Wu, I'm afraid you'll jump up and scold Gu Jiao: \"little bereaved star, black sheep, you also buy the mountain. The silver is generously scraped!\"In the eyes of most villagers, mountains are worthless. At most, they can cut some firewood and pick some wild vegetables. Although there are also mountain goods and prey, no one will buy the whole mountain for these things.Gu Jiao is both knowledgeable and capable of dealing with any danger in the deep mountains, so the top of the mountain will be a huge cornucopia in her hands.She used to make up her own mind about this kind of thing. Xiao LIULANG never interfered in any of her decisions. However, since the old lady came, their mode of getting along seems to have changed imperceptibly.\"Are you talking about the mountain that goes up from the back of Uncle Luo's house?\" Asked Xiao LIULANG.\"Well.\" Gu Jiao nodded.Qingquan village is surrounded by mountains on three sides. What she sees is the top of the mountain in the middle. It is also the top of the mountain that people in the village often go to. Uncle Luo's house is at the foot of the mountain.\"Well, I'll ask Lizheng later.\" Xiao LIULANG didn't hesitate.Gu Jiao grabs her little head. It's her grandfather in it. It's OK for her to ask. She doesn't say it to keep him busy.After dinner, Xiao LIULANG went to Gu's old house.Zhou and Liu were beaten 30 times by the Yamen. These days, they all lie down in the house to heal their wounds. The house is quite clean.\"Brother in law! Why are you here? \" It's Gu Xiaoshun who opens the door.\"I'm looking for Lizheng.\" Xiao LIULANG said.Although he and Gu Jiao became close, he always called him Li Zheng.\"Oh.\" Gu Xiaoshun was only surprised that his brother-in-law would come, but he was not surprised by his brother-in-law's address. After all, the family forced his brother-in-law to get married first, and squeezed his brother-in-law's hard-earned money later. Every stroke was a debt.\"My Lord, my brother-in-law is here!\" Gu Xiaoshun leads Xiao LIULANG to Gu's house.Mr. Gu accidentally glanced at Xiao LIULANG. If he remembered correctly, it was the first time that Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiaoda had come to the old house after their marriage.\"It's so late. What's the matter?\" Mr. Gu asked.Xiao LIULANG said, \"let me ask Lizheng how to sell the mountain behind uncle Luo's house.\"\"Why do you ask? Does anyone in your college want to buy mountains? \" Mr. Gu would never have expected that his granddaughter would buy the mountain. \"That mountain costs a lot of money... Besides, it's not something anyone wants to buy. The mountain is not under the control of our village or the county government. It's the land of the temple. \"\"Temple?\" Xiao LIULANG frowned slightly. He didn't know there was a temple here.Mr. Gu said: \"yes, it's the temple. You haven't been here long, maybe you haven't been there. On the other side of the mountain, you can walk around the foot of the mountain in about an hour. If the people of your academy want to buy mountains, they have to go to the temple to talk to the abbot. \"When he thought of something, Mr. Gu said, \"well, the concubine was born in that temple.\"After Xiao LIULANG came home, Gu Jiao met him and asked him, \"what's up? What does the Gu family say? \"Xiao LIULANG relayed Mr. Gu's original words.\"It's the land in the temple...\" the original owner has never been to the temple. No, according to Gu Laozi, she was born in the temple, so she has been there. \"Didn't you say how much silver it would cost?\"\"I didn't say, but maybe one hundred Liang is not enough.\" Xiao LIULANG said.\"Oh, I have more.\" Gu Jiao said, took out a silver naked son from pocket to put on the table.The old lady stopped when she was eating melon seeds.But it's not over yet. Gu Jiao grabs one more, one more, one more.The old lady and Xiao LIULANG were stunned at the same time. There are at least two or three hundred taels of silver naked children. Where did she get them?Xiao LIULANG calmed down and asked, \"are you the one who earns everything by selling mountain goods?\"\"Well!\" Gu Jiao efforts to open eyes, a face of sincerity, \"is not a fight to hit Da!\"Xiao LIULANG--In ancient times, there were not many holidays for studying, except ten days' holiday every ten days, farmland holiday during busy farming, and clothing leave in September, which only included annual leave from December to January.In the past, the annual leave was in the first ten days of December, but it was delayed to the last ten days of this year. Because of the fast release of annual leave, there will be no ten day leave in the next half month.Gu Jiao didn't want Xiao LIULANG to ask for leave from the Academy for this, so she decided to go to the temple by herself.Taking into account the lessons learned last time, Gu Jiao didn't leave the food in the pot, but found Xue Ningxiang and asked her to take care of the old lady.\"Your aunt...\"\"Her illness is not serious. It's not contagious.\"\"Ah, that's not what I mean.\"How can Gu Jiao not know about Xue Ningxiang's help in telling her a lie? Naturally, she also guessed what Xue Ningxiang had guessed, but Xue didn't report her and didn't alienate her.Xue Ningxiang didn't ask Gu Jiao how to cure leprosy. She just believed Gu Jiao: \"don't worry, I will take good care of your aunt.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: 35Gu Jiao carried the basket to the other side of the mountain.The temple is in the middle of the mountain. It's very difficult to walk. There is still a section of road in the middle without steps. It's full of snow. Fortunately, Gu Jiao has been here since she called. She is diligent in climbing and exercising, but she has not been dissuaded by the dangerous mountain road.She walked faster than ordinary people, but she still walked for an hour. It was almost noon when she arrived at the temple.The temple is not very big. The simple and vicissitudes of life plaque has a few characters of Ning'an temple. I don't know if it's because of the lack of snow and people. Gu Jiao didn't meet a pilgrim along the way.There are not many monks in the temple. Gu Jiao has been in for a long time, but none of them has been seen.\"No, this temple is empty, isn't it?\"But the floor is clean, like someone takes care of it every day.Just thinking about it, Gu Jiao came to Guanyin hall. Standing behind the pillar, she glanced into the hall and finally saw today's first living person.It was a lady in silk and satin. Although she was well-dressed, she was not swaggering. A white cloak was draped over her, like a reflection of snow.From Gu Jiao's point of view can only see each other's back, but can feel each other's body that gentle and elegant atmosphere.She kowtowed a few piously and put her hands together: \"may the Bodhisattva bless my son safe and smooth...\"Even the voice is gentle and pleasant.Gu Jiao seldom pays attention to a stranger, especially a woman. She doesn't like women, right?But when he was distracted, a Jiao drink came from one side: \"where's the little thing from? How dare you peep at my wifeGu Jiao returns to her senses and looks in the direction of her cheering voice. On the corridor opposite, she sees a maid wearing bean green Bijia. The object of her scolding is not herself, but some young monks who don't know when to lie behind another pillar.The little monks saw that the beauty had been caught, whimpered and ran away in panic.So there are monks, but such a small monk!One of them runs backwards and runs towards Gu Jiao. Baji bumps into Gu Jiao's leg and falls on the ground.Gu Jiao was a little girl who was in the same place, and suddenly wanted to help him!But without waiting for her to reach out, xiaotuanzi got up and ran away.The lady who worships the Bodhisattva in the hall came out and said to the green Bijia maid, \"Liu Er, don't be rude.\"\"Madame.\" The servant girl, who was called liu'er, murmured and walked forward. \"A few little guys don't want to teach me a lesson. After a while, they'll kick their noses on their faces and have to run to your Zen room to make trouble!\"\"It's all children.\" Said the lady.The servant girl curled her lips and seemed to disagree, but she didn't continue to contradict her wife.Just when Gu Jiao thought they were going to leave, her wife suddenly looked at Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao's body shape is completely blocked by the pillar, even the servant girl who is coming towards her doesn't find it, and I don't know how the lady is aware of herself.\"Who?\" The servant girl was on the alert for a moment.Gu Jiao had to come out.She was wearing a shabby Lilac Floral jacket, brown cotton trousers, a pair of black cloth shoes that had been soaked in snow on her feet, and a small old basket on her back. However, she was not good at combing women's hair, so she picked her hair and put a ball on the top of it.She was dressed like a poor country girl, not to mention a red birthmark on her face.There was a trace of contempt on the servant girl's face.But there was no dislike in her eyes.When the snow stopped, the roof eaves of the temple were covered with auspicious snow, the beautiful scenery of the mountain was covered with silver, and the world was a vast expanse of ice, but all of these were not as beautiful as her.Gu Jiao is also the first time to see such a beautiful woman.But the most beautiful is her temperament, gentle and elegant, quiet and dignified.\"Did you come to see Guanyin Bodhisattva, too?\" The lady asked Gu Jiao with a smile.What a gentle voice, what a gentle smileGu Jiao Leng Lengshen, Fang said: \"no, I'm looking for the abbot.\"His wife said with a smile: \"the abbot has gone down the mountain...\"In the middle of the conversation, another servant girl came with a food box. There was ice on the road. Her feet slipped and she rushed forward.She did not say, the hand of the box also flew out, see about to hit the lady, Gu Jiao a lunge forward, with her arm to block the box.The food box scattered in the air, and the leaves of the soup and vegetables came out, pouring Gu Jiao's whole body!\"Ma'am, are you all right?\" Liu Er looked anxiously at his wife.The lady shook her head: \"I'm ok.\"After that, she turned her head and looked at Gu Jiao. She was worried in her eyes: \"it's this girl. What's the matter with you?\"Just as she stood in front of her, the flying food box was meant to hit her. It was not the little girl who blocked her. I was afraid that her face would be broken.\"No problem.\" Gu Jiao said.It's too cold. The dishes are not hot any more. It's just that the soup sticks on the body.The lady looked at her in a mess and felt guilty. She looked at the maid who fell to the ground and sighed: \"can't you walk well?\"That servant girl also falls not light, knee all swollen, she holds back the pain to get up, grievance way: \"the road is too slippery...\"The lady also understood that she didn't mean to hurt other people's girls, but she didn't go on purpose in her heart and said to Gu Jiao, \"it's all because I have no way to discipline her. I've soiled her clothes and asked her to come with me to change her clean clothes.\"Gu Jiao thought about it and didn't refuse.This lady seems to be a frequent visitor to this temple. There is a separate Zen room in the temple. The Zen room is at the end of the corridor. It looks like the same as other Zen rooms, but the furnishings inside are elegant and quiet, which complement her temperament.The two servant girls came into the room together.The lady asked the maid in green Bijia named Liu Er to open the cage.Liu ER was not happy: \"madam, here are all the ladies' clothes!\"Where should a country girl wear their lady's clothes?The lady's gentle color gathered three points: \"you go out and bring in a new meal, remember to give this girl a share.\"The servant girl felt the master's authority and bowed her head to answer: \"yes.\"The lady herself picked a suit of clothes from the box and gave it to Gu Jiao: \"I don't know if my daughter's clothes fit you, but it's better than a wet one. You can change them quickly.\"Gu Jiao went to the screen and changed her clothes.I thought it would be a little big, but it fitted unexpectedly.\"It suits you.\" The lady said with a smile that it was her daughter's dress, but the little girl was more bright. \"How old are you this year?\"Gu Jiao replied, \"fourteen.\"Lady Mou son a bright: \"and my daughter is the same age, my daughter was born in this temple.\"Gu Jiao: what a coincidence. Me too.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: 36The lady pointed to the Kang on her side and said with a gentle smile, 'sit down and talk.\"Gu Jiao sat down on the Kang. There was a small table between them. There were some exquisite snacks on the table.The lady pushed the snack in front of her: \"are you hungry? Let's have something to eat first. The fast meal will be here in a moment. \"\"Well.\" After climbing the mountain for such a long time, Gu Jiao's stomach is really hungry. Gu Jiao selects a piece of yellow snack.Gu Jiao is very quiet.\"Is it delicious?\" Asked the lady.\"Well.\" Gu Jiao nodded. Seeing that his wife looked at herself suspiciously, she said, \"it's better than Li Ji.\"\"What is Li Ji?\" Asked the lady.\"The best pastry shop in town.\" Gu Jiao said.The lady was relieved at last. In fact, these snacks were made by her own hands. When she had nothing to do in the house, she would make them to pass the day. It was a pity that her son was too sick to eat, and her daughter was very well, but she didn't like them, which made her doubt that they were too difficult to eat.Gu Jiao doesn't pretend to eat. She really thinks it's delicious.Madame found a sense of achievement in Gu Jiao. She couldn't help looking at Gu Jiao more. There was a birthmark on her face, which she had just noticed.What a nice girl. What a pity, madam.Later, she noticed Gu Jiao's hands, which were a pair of hands that worked all the year round. The palm of her hands was covered with cocoons and the back of her hands was crisscrossed with scars.The lady thought of her daughter. She was glad that her daughter was born in Hou's house and didn't have to suffer from the people's sufferings, otherwise she would have to die of heartache.Gu Jiao sat in his wife's room for a while and ate a plate of chestnut cake. Now the abbot also went back to the temple.Gu Jiao didn't forget the business after all. After leaving with his wife, she went to the Abbot's Buddhist temple.The abbot is a little older, with a gray beard, but he is very hale and hearty. He should be practicing martial arts all the year round.Gu Jiao said concisely: \"I don't know if the abbot is willing to sell it?\"After that, I didn't wait for the abbot to answer. She fixed her eyes and saw the abbot staring at her face without blinking.Gu Jiaogang wants to ask, is there anything on my face? If you think about it, isn't there something on her face?\"Abbot?\" Gu Jiao reminds us.\"Cough, cough!\" The abbot came back, cleared his throat, sat upright and said, \"you just said... You want to buy mountains?\"Gu Jiao: \"yes.\"Abbot: how old are you this yearHuh?Is the topic changing a little fast?\"Can't you buy a mountain when you are young?\" Gu Jiao asked faintly.\"Oh, no, no! Amitabha, little benefactor, don't get me wrong! \" The abbot stood up with one hand and said, \"brother Jingxin, who is in charge of the temple property, is out. It will take three or two days to come back. Why don't you come back in a few days?\"\"Well, I'll come back one day a year ago.\" Gu Jiao said, then got up to leave.The Abbot's eyes always followed her birthmark.Gu Jiao frowned: \"abbot, although I don't mind what other people think of me, you are a monk. Are you always staring at other people's defectsThe abbot quickly made amends: \"I'm impolite. Please don't blame me, little benefactor!\"After Gu Jiao left, the abbot still came back for a long time.A disciple came forward and asked, \"what's the matter with you, abbot?\"\"I think of one thing.\" Said the abbot.\"What's the matter?\" Asked the disciple.The abbot sighed: \"many years ago.\"That night, he drank too much and wanted to give the baby some palace sand. As a result, he shook his hand and put it on the baby girl's faceWhen he woke up the next day, he remembered what he had done and went to make amends to Mrs. Hou. As a result, he found that the child in Mrs. Hou's arms had a white face and no sign of guarding the palace.Because he drank too much, he was not sure about his memory. Since the baby didn't have it on his face, he didn't do it himself, right?Over the years, he has completely forgotten that. But just saw that little girl, the recollection suddenly surged to the heart, he also doubted that that night he was really to guard the palace sand point other people's face?No, he ordered Houfu Qianjin. The girl just said she was a villager at the foot of the mountain.Gu Jiao went to find the lady just after she got out of the meditation room. As a result, she was told that the other party had gone down the mountain.\"These boxes of snacks are from my wife. Please accept them.\" The monk who cleaned the Zen room handed Gu Jiao a big bundle.Gu Jiao took the weight in her hand and knew that the lady had left all the snacks for herself.Gu Jiao sighed. She hasn't returned her clothes yetThe clothes the lady gave Gu Jiao were good-looking, but it was not conducive to walking on the mountain road. It was estimated that she would have to take silk in two steps. It can't be blamed for the poor quality. After all, people who can afford this kind of material don't need to walk on their own.On the way back, Gu Jiao walked very fast. She was worried that the old lady would not be able to get along with the family next door. After all, the old lady had a bad temper and was very selective. She was extremely unsociable.Unexpectedly, Gu Jiao was silly as soon as she came in.What happened? Why so many people? Are they all women?Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG did not take the initiative to walk around with the villagers. In the past, only those who had to write a letter of faith would come to their home. The highest record was three a day, no more.So Gu Jiao didn't understand why their main room was suddenly full?The old lady was sitting on the top chair, while Luo Er Shu's mother-in-law, Luo Er auntie, was standing beside her with a pot of tea.On the other side is Gui Fang, Aunt Zhang's daughter-in-law. Gui Fang carries a tray with melon seeds and tea cups.Gu Jiao is more puzzled. Isn't Guifang just born?The rest of the people do not seem to be qualified to close, so stand opposite, you squeeze me, I squeeze you, just like a rural version of gongdou drama!\"All right, let's go back.\" The old lady put down the melon seeds and waved her hand.Everyone stepped back, and before they left, they all bowed to the old lady.The imperial concubines saluted pleasantly, but a group of village women wrapped in headscarves saluted. It was a big accident scene!Gu Jiao gives Lei de what she doesn't want. She grabs Xue Ningxiang and asks, \"what's my old lady doing?\"Xue Ningxiang said admiringly, \"my aunt is telling the villagers a play! Well saidGu Jiao's mouth Drew: \"what's the matter with salute?\"Xue Ningxiang thought for a while before she understood what Gu Jiao meant: \"Oh, you say this? It's taught by my aunt. She says all the people in the theater are like this! \"The talent of drama garden will not be like this!The old lady is blatantly fooling the big guy to salute her.Gu Jiao wondered where the old lady came from. Can she be a demon like this?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: 37The ancients loved to listen to operas. After all, they couldn't do much except listen to operas, especially women.It's hard to hear opera in the countryside. The nearest opera garden is also in the town. It takes a lot of coppers to get in. The country people can't afford to hear it.Although the old lady can't sing, she can speak in detail.\"Where did you listen to the play?\" Gu Jiao asked.\"I don't remember.\" Said the old lady, shaking her head.Seeing that she didn't look like a liar, Gu Jiao said, \"do you remember anything else?\"The old lady thought seriously, \"no more.\"Gu JiaoGu Jiao then said, \"can you stop fooling people like this in the future?\"The old lady thought seriously again, \"NoGu Jiao--As the new year approaches, Gu Jiao becomes too busy to keep an eye on the old lady. The old lady occasionally acts as a demon, but she can do it all by herself without causing any trouble to Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG.Then Gu Jiao went to the temple again. The master who was in charge of the property had not come back. Gu Jiao decided to come back in a few years.The academy held another exam a few years ago. I don't know if it was affected by the theft. Gu Dashun's performance was much weaker this time. Suddenly, he fell into the class. Some people suspected that he was at the end of his talent, while others suspected that he had cheated in the first place. But President Li has always been firm and trustworthy, and Xiao LIULANG is talented.No matter what others say, he doesn't want to give up Xiao LIULANG.The imperial examination is held once every three years. There will be Qiuwei next year. If you miss it, you have to wait for the next three years.And the examinee that participates in Qiu Wei must pass County examination first, take an examination of scholar.The county examination is held every three months. There is a new year's day. President Li hesitates for a moment and reports his name to Xiao LIULANG without authorization.Gu Jiao doesn't know all this yet. The academy is on annual leave. Tomorrow is the day to operate on Xiao LIULANG. She has to sleep and adjust herself to the best condition.In fact, she didn't have to do too much of this kind of operation in her previous life. It's reasonable that she doesn't have to have any psychological burden at all. It's not the same to operate on a stranger as Xiao LIULANG.So perfect cub, she can't leave any regrets on him.Before going to bed, Gu Jiao checked the small medicine box. Sure enough, the anesthetic and injection needed for the operation have all appeared.These drugs are not those sold in pharmacies in previous generations, they are all institute drugs. Gu Jiao seriously suspected that as long as the Research Institute did not close down, her medicine box would continue to supply.Well, it's a good thing!Gu Jiao had a good sleep. After she got up, she made breakfast and boiled the medicine for the old lady.When Gu Jiao took the medicine to the old lady's house, the old lady hesitated to look at the pills on the plate and the juice in the bowl. She frowned and said, \"why do I think this soup is drinkable\"You think too much. The soup is as important as the pill.\" Gu Jiao said without changing her face.The old lady drank the pills and the soup suspiciously. She rolled her eyes. She seriously suspected that Gu Jiao had come to revenge her for being a demon.Gu Jiao still entrusts the old lady to Xue Ningxiang, and then goes to the hospital with Xiao LIULANG in Uncle Luo's ox cart.Feng Lin will never miss such an important day.He had been waiting in the hospital for a long time, but now it was getting colder and colder, and he didn't want to sit inside and wait. He was frozen into a little popsicle outside.Feng Lin saw the couple on the cart and his face sank.He has a kind of impulse to scold dog men and women, but he pressed, brother Xiao is not wrong, is this woman more and more shameless, always stick to brother Xiao!Gu Jiao saw Feng Lin with a calm face: \"didn't you go back for the new year?\"Feng Lin snorted: \"my home is so far away, how can I go back?\"Gu Jiao then remembered that the transportation was inconvenient in ancient times. The distance that the high-speed railway could reach in one day in previous generations might take a month here. Feng Lin may not have got home yet, and the annual leave is over.Gu Jiao: \"Oh.\"Feng Lin hit the cotton with a fistThe day was set in advance. Shopkeeper Wang and the old doctor were waiting in the clinic at dawn.Feng Lin and Gu Jiao follow in.The old doctor first asked Xiao LIULANG about his medicine fumigation at home these days.\"Every night before going to bed, there is medicine fumigation.\" Xiao LIULANG said truthfully.Every night when he came home from school, Gu Jiao had already cooked the food and cooked his medicine.The old doctor nodded.Feng Lin said, \"Doctor Zhang, is brother Xiao's leg getting better soon?\"Old man way: \"good, to wait until after the operation to know.\"\"What did you say? Surgery? \" Feng Lin was stunned.Xiao LIULANG's eyes also passed a trace of consternation.Gu Jiao was worried about this situation, so she didn't tell them that surgery in this era is not popular, people's acceptance is not high, and it is generally believed that it can only be used in the battlefield.Feng Lin was frightened and said, \"Doctor Zhang! You didn't say that before! \"Of course, the old doctor would not tell the truth. He said with a straight face, \"it's not that the conditions at that time did not allow it. Now the medicine has been smoked for a period of time, and the meridians have been opened, so we can have an operation.\"But after all, this is a major event. Feng Lin hesitated to use a knife on people: \"is there no other way but surgery?\"\"Well.\" The old doctor nodded.\"Will it succeed?\" Feng Lin asked again.\"It's not guaranteed.\" The old doctor felt his conscience and said, \"if he does, he will be able to walk normally. If he fails, he may be worse than he is now.\"This is Gu Jiao's original words. Even if she is the most powerful doctor in the Research Institute, she dare not boast that there is no risk in which operation.\"Brother Xiao...\" Feng Lin backed out. He was a conservative and didn't want to take such a big risk.But Xiao LIULANG lightly moved the corner of his lips and said carelessly, \"then let's have an operation. Please bother Dr. Zhang.\"He promised so fast that even Gu Jiao looked at him.In fact, even if we have been together for so long, Gu Jiao has never really understood him, but at that moment, she seems to feel a cold indifference on him.It's like... He doesn't mind that the operation might fail.Is he really brave or doesn't care about his life at all?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: 38Feng Lin winks at Gu Jiao in the hope that she can persuade brother Xiao. Gu Jiao just doesn't see it and makes Feng Lin angry.Before the operation, the eldest husband handed over a strange document, and Xiao LIULANG stopped slightly.\"What is this?\" He asked.The old doctor coughed softly and said, \"the consent for the operation needs to be signed by the family.\"I'm fascinated.He has been a doctor for decades, and never said such a thing!However, since it was Gu's strong demand, they could only do so.Feng Lin can't sign this word, and Xiao LIULANG can't sign it himself. Dr. Gu finally wants to experience the addiction of her family members, and then sadly discovers that she can't write her own name!How sad are you???Didn't you think about it when you asked the second owner to write the consent for the operation?Will it be regarded as a ghost symbol to sign Gu Jiao with the doctor's body pen of previous life?I'm afraid the air is suddenly quiet.Gu Jiao grabbed the pen pole, scratched her ears and cheeks, and her face turned red.I want to be powerful in front of Xiao LIULANG, but it's all over.Xiao LIULANG takes a look at Gu Jiao and grabs the pen so smoothly that she can write.Finally, it was Xiao LIULANG who signed Gu Jiao's name.Xiao LIULANG was taken to the special room. This time, the old doctor handed him a bowl of Ma Fei San.Mafusan is an ancient anesthetic. It is said that it was created by the miracle doctor Hua Tuo, but the real prescription of mafusan has been lost. Nowadays, most of the mafusan used by doctors are made of Datura flower powder or juice.This kind of medicine can make people anaesthetize and calm at the same time, cause muscle relaxation, sweat gland secretion is inhibited, so it is also called Mongolian sweat medicine.Mongolian sweat medicine is very toxic. Of course, Gu Jiao won't use it for Xiao LIULANG. What's in that bowl is actually the tranquilizer of rejuvenation hall.Xiao LIULANG soon fell asleep.Gu Jiao finds an excuse to leave Feng Lin behind. This time it will take longer than last time. Instead of saying that she wants to go to the toilet, Gu Jiao goes to the street to see what new year's goods she can buy.Feng Lin was so angry with her that she didn't stop brother Xiao just now. Now Brother Xiao is going to be stabbed by someone. She's very happy. She has leisure to see the new year's goods!She is really a heartless woman!Gu Jiao went back to the rejuvenation hall through the back door. The old doctor was waiting at the door of the wing room.The old doctor is an old man in huichuntang. He has worked here for no less than 30 years. Although his medical skill is not as good as that of Dr. Zhang in Beijing, his virtue is absolutely worthy of the conscience of the industry. Otherwise, the second owner will not trust him to participate in this matter.The old doctor was very curious about the operation and wanted to follow Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao didn't seem to get back his meaning, so she closed the door.Old doctor: --Gu Jiao thinks it's not easy for the old doctor to give him a few prescriptions in return. As for the secret of the medicine box, she doesn't intend to let others know for the time being.Gu Jiao opens the medicine box and first gives Xiao LIULANG an injection of local anesthesia.\u2026\u2026An hour later, Gu Jiao came out with a small basket on her back.The old doctor and the second owner rushed up and asked, \"how's the operation?\"Gu Jiao nodded and said, \"the operation was very successful.\"There is no problem with her operation, but the specific recovery varies from person to person, and his ankle has been injured for too long after all. Even if the operation is successful, it will take a long time to recover, and the legs and feet will work together.But at least if the operation is successful, he won't have to hurt any more.Thinking of so many days and nights, he was in pain, and always went to fetch water and burn firewood... To do what she could, Gu Jiao felt a little uncomfortable.If she had known that he was in such pain, she would not let him do any work regardless of his self-esteem.When Xiao LIULANG woke up, he was still surrounded by the old doctor.The old doctor told him about his condition. The operation was very successful. He asked him to go home to have a rest and come back ten days later: \"remember, don't be forced in these ten days. Stay in bed more, don't eat spicy food and avoid alcohol...\"\"Well?\" Xiao LIULANG suddenly gave a confused hum and looked at the old doctor in a trance.The old doctor thought he didn't understand. He laughed and said, \"I told you not to drink, just don't drink. Do you understand? Young people are not allowed to drink even if they are not ill. \"Xiao LIULANG dropped his eyes: \"well.\"After the old doctor told him to go to the lobby to call Feng Lin and Gu Jiao.Feng Lin Chong's first words in the room were: \"brother Xiao, are you still alive?\"Gu Jiao rolled her eyes behind him!Feng Lin came to the bedside and wanted to see Xiao LIULANG's injury, but he had already been wrapped up and could only see a circle of gauze.\"Does it hurt?\" Asked Feng Lin.After the effect of anesthetics had passed, it hurt a little. But after a long time, he was used to the pain, so he shook his head and said, \"it doesn't hurt.\"When he was still asleep, the old doctor went to the lobby to talk to Feng Lin about his condition. Feng Lin knew that the operation was going well, so he was not particularly worried.But suddenly he thought of something. He turned his head and glared fiercely at Gu Jiao: \"you were not here just now. You didn't hear Doctor Zhang's words. I'll tell you again! You remember it for meThe old doctor's advice was repeated to Gu Jiao word for word.Gu Jiao listened very carefully.The old doctor was sweating. Boy, I'm afraid you don't know who explained these precautionsWhen he left Tongren hall, it was late. Second uncle Luo helped Feng Lin to help Xiao LIULANG get on the ox cart. Then second uncle Luo first sent Feng Lin back to the Academy, and then took Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG back to the village.Just in the middle of the walk, Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG's tummies screamed at the same time.They came out after breakfast, but they had been busy for most of the day and forgot about lunch.The sky is overcast. It looks like snow.Gu Jiao thought about it and said to Xiao LIULANG, \"it's going to snow, so we won't eat outside. First, I'll buy some scallion oil cakes to pad my stomach.\"There was a scallion oil cake seller nearby. Xiao LIULANG nodded: \"good.\"The place where they sell scallion cake is just around the corner. Gu Jiao jumps off the ox cart and walks towards her destination. Xu was in such a hurry that he was bumped into.Heaven and earth's conscience, this time, she didn't deliberately bump into others, but others intentionally bump into him.Gu Jiao's past life is not really just a doctor, this kind of insect carving skills also want to deceive her? The person who took advantage of her has not been born yet!After hitting Gu Jiao, the man plunged into the crowd.Gu Jiao sneered and looked at the ground. As soon as her toes were crushed, a stone flew up and was kicked by her toes, hitting the man's head impartially.\"Ah -\" the man fell to the ground with a scream. Then he looked back and saw Gu Jiao behind the crowd, just like a little murderer.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: 39Xu's eyes are too penetrating. Through the vast sea of people, he still pokes the eyes of the thief like a knife.Little thieves almost instinctively feel the danger, get up and run!The thief who escaped from Gu Jiao's hands, eh... Never!Gu Jiao chased him into the alley.The little thief makes the strength of reincarnation come out, but Gu Jiao is still more and more close behind him, and he seems to have chosen a dead end just now. There is no way ahead!The little thief was flustered, and he pulled out the dagger hidden in his sleeve.\"Don't come here! Or I'll kill you! \" He roared with angry eyes.Gu Jiao didn't lift her eyelids. She stepped on the wall with one foot and lifted up with the help of force. With the power of lightning, she kicked the thief's dagger with the other foot and kicked it out.The little thief's big eyes glared. The next second, Gu Jiao fell down and kicked him in the chest. He didn't even have time to scream, so he fell heavily on the ground.Gu Jiao walked over indifferently, lifted his body with her feet and picked up the purse that fell out of his sleeve.Xiao LIULANG is still waiting on the bullock cart. Gu Jiao has no time to spend with him, and she doesn't plan to report to the official. She is ready to leave. Unexpectedly, as soon as she turns around, the thief grabs the dagger on the ground quietly.However, before he did, Gu Jiao stepped on his wrist and immediately broke the bone of his hand.\"Ah --\" the thief screamed bitterly again. He didn't understand how the other party did it. She didn't look back. Did she have eyes on the back of her head?\"Get him!\"In front of the alley, a few men dressed as yard guards suddenly glanced at Gu Jiao. They didn't care and ran straight to the thief.\"Did you find it?\"Just then, a young man came panting.Xu ran too fast and his physical strength was overdrawn. He couldn't run any more and held on to the wall for breath.Gu Jiao passed him by.He suddenly said, \"Miss Gu?\"Gu Jiao stopped to look at him: \"Xiao Qin Xianggong?\"Is the town so small? Catch a thief and meet him?On the other side, the group of guards holding the thief came back. One of them held a scroll in his hand and presented it to Xiao Qin Xiang to be fair: \"young master, I have found it!\"\"So fast? Isn't it hard to catch a habitual thief? \" Xianggong of Xiao Qin took over the scroll.The hospital guard looked at Gu Jiao and said, \"this girl caught him.\"After the last incident, Mr. Qin's impression of Gu Jiao has changed. Although Gu Jiao wronged him by one hundred liang of silver, he is more receptive to her greed than being dogged by her.\"Thank you again this time.\" Xiao Qin Xianggong said politely.Gu Jiao glanced at him: \"Why are you always stolen?\"Xiao Qin Xianggong said in a friendly way: \"it should be that the news has leaked and has been targeted by the right family.\"He didn't say the specific news, and Gu Jiao didn't ask.Gu Jiao just wants to get her money back. It's nothing to do with her. She didn't talk to Mr. Qin any more, and left without expression.Looking at her back without hesitation, Xianggong Xiaoqin frowned. Is she... Really not interested in herself?\"Young master.\" Another nurse came to him and said, \"I found a handkerchief on the ground. I don't know if it belongs to that girl just now?\"Xiao Qin Xianggong grabs the handkerchief and chases Gu Jiao in the direction of leaving.When he came to Gu Jiao, Gu Jiao had already bought scallion cake and returned to the ox cart.\"Miss Gu! Miss Gu Xianggong of Xiao Qin is a scholar with high social status. When he went to chase the thief, he drained his strength. This trip was based on his willpower.He held the cart out of breath and couldn't speak again for a long time.Xiao LIULANG's eyes became cool.Gu Jiao shows off her hand and looks like \"it has nothing to do with me, I don't know him\".\"What's the matter?\" Xiao LIULANG asked faintly.Xianggong of Xiao Qin was stunned and looked at Xiao LIULANG with a look of embarrassment: \"ah... Young master Xiao is also here...\"Xiao LIULANG: so you came after me while I was away?!Xianggong of Xiao Qin handed over the handkerchief: \"Miss Gu, your handkerchief has fallen off.\"Gu Jiao looked and said, \"it's not mine.\"\"Ah...\" Xiao Qin Xianggong was even more embarrassed. He chased all the way, but it wasn't her. How could he feel a little humiliated?In a hurry, Xianggong of Xiao Qin leaned over, and the portrait in his arms fell down. It happened that he hit the ox cart and spread out at Xiao LIULANG's feet.It's a picture of the misty rain in the south of the Yangtze River, with mountains and water, and a boat with a canopy in the rain. Rao is Gu Jiao does not understand calligraphy and painting, but also feel that this painting is full of ink and has a long artistic conception.The painting was not easy to come by. His father told him to keep it safe from being seen when he got it.At this time, the painting suddenly came to light. Xianggong of Xiao Qin was very nervous. It can be seen that Gu Jiao looked at the painting and seemed very curious. He suddenly put the painting away.He said with some pride: \"this is the calligraphy of little Marquis zhaodu! It's called the painting of misty rain in spring mountain. It was written by the young Marquis when he was 12 years old and traveled to the south of the Yangtze River. It's hard to ask for a thousand pieces of money for the paintings of the young marquis. I bought them from my acquaintances at a high price! \"Gu Jiao picked up the painting and opened her eyes wide: \"how good is the painting at the age of 12?\"She was so stunned that even the red birthmark on her face was not ugly in the eyes of Mr. Qin.Xianggong Yu of Xiao Qin said with more and more satisfaction: \"it's just his painting. It's said that he was dissatisfied with the painting and threw it away. His servants kept it secretly. If you like... I'll show you more! \"Gu JiaoXiao LIULANG's eyes swept lightly from the painting, and then said, \"fake.\"Xiao Qin Xianggong was stunned for a moment before he realized that he was talking about the painting and immediately jumped: \"you are nonsense! This painting of mine is an authentic one. How can it be a fake? \"Xiao LIULANG said, \"it's a fake.\"Xiao Qin Xianggong raised the volume: \"where do you see it is a fake?\"Xiao LIULANG seemed to give him a look that was superfluous: \"where don't you see that it's a fake?\"This is too arrogant, it is to say that the painting is too fake to see, where there are flaws.Xiao Qin Xianggong finally couldn't help but blow up his hair: \"what do you know? Do you know painting as a poor scholar? I've been identified by a special person! This is the real work of the young Marquis! \"\"He didn't draw this picture.\" Xiao LIULANG said calmly.\"How do you know he didn't? Do you know him? \"When he said this, Xianggong Xiaoqin laughed.How could a little cripple in the countryside know the famous young Marquis of zhaodu?There are many princes in the capital of Zhao state, and there are many sons of princes. They are all small princes, but only one can be called little princes of Zhao state.The youngest Marquis of zhaodu is the only son of Xuanping marquis. His mother is Princess Xinyang, who is deeply loved by his majesty.When he was three years old, he went to the Jinluan palace to fight against the Confucians and became famous in the first World War! Four years old into the Imperial College, five years old through reading the National Palace, proficient in six languages!Dean li of Tianxiang academy ranks first among the four talents in the capital. That's because he has to be 18 years old to get on the talent list. No one has surpassed him in the imperial examination. That's also because the young Marquis has never passed the imperial examination!When he was 12 years old, he was appointed by his majesty to offer wine to the Imperial Academy. Envoys of five countries all came to celebrate the young man's offering wine. It was the real Fenghua Town, the most famous zhaodu town!However, the unexpected death of the young marquis in a sudden fire in the Imperial College is due to his incomparable background and talent. It is said that he was burned alive.He died on New Year's Eve at the age of 14.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: 40Xiao LIULANG didn't mention him just because he had a good relationship with him. Since he didn't believe it, that's OK.Gu Jiao originally enjoyed the painting, but when she heard that it was a fake, she gave it back to Xiao Qin Xianggong.Looking at her look of disgust, Xianggong Xiao Qin suddenly explained, \"don't listen to him! This painting is the real oneGu Jiao cut off the railway: \"my husband said it was false, that is false!\"\"You...\"Xiao Qin Xianggong is really angry.In the past, he didn't care how a clown looked at his paintings, but today, I don't know what happened. He didn't want to be humiliated in front of her.Xianggong of Xiao Qin straightened up: \"it's true! He has never seen the world, he doesn't know how to draw! \"\"You've never seen the world!\" Gu Jiao doesn't allow anyone to belittle her family!If the last time Mr. Qin came to Gu Jiao to get a letter, Xiao LIULANG only heard the result afterwards, then now he really understands Gu Jiao's indifference to Mr. Qin.She had a fight with him for herself.Xiao LIULANG takes a deep look at Gu Jiao, and suddenly reminds Xiao Qin Xianggong with a generous warning: \"if you take this painting as a gift, I advise you not to be so ugly.\"After that, Xiao LIULANG said to Uncle Luo, \"go back to the village, uncle Luo.\"\"Good!\" Luo Er Shu didn't get involved in the young man's affairs, and drove the ox cart away with a smile.Xiao Qin Xianggong looked at their backs in the cold wind. He was so angry that he wanted to scold them!However, this matter left a thorn in his heart. When he took the painting back to the Qin family, his father could not wait to welcome it: \"how about it? Have you found the painting? \"\"Looking for is to find back...\" Xiao Qin Xianggong wanted to say again.His father panicked: \"what's the matter? Isn't it broken? \"\"Not bad... Alas.\" Xiao Qin Xianggong finally told Xiao LIULANG's words to his father.His father was tougher than he was: \"do you believe a little cripple?\"He is a student of Tianxiang Academy.\" Xiao Qin Xianggong met Xiao LIULANG when he came to Gu Jiao to get the letter. At that time, Xiao LIULANG was wearing the uniform of Tianxiang Academy.\"What happened to the students of Tianxiang academy?\" His father disdained to say.\"They're all great.\" Xiao Qin Xianggong said.His father didn't like it and said, \"aren't you very good, too? I spent so much money to invite you master from the capital, where did you lose to them? What's more, they are all dead scholars. Where have they seen the world? \"I said that at that time!Xianggong of Xiao Qin is actually a very proud man. If someone reminds him like this, he won't listen to a word, but Xiao LIULANG's eyes and aura at that time are very convincing.In the end, Xianggong of Xiao Qin failed to persuade his father to do so. He watched his father wrap up the painting and send it to the noble people in the capital.--It snowed for three days in a row. The roads in the village were closed and the ox cart couldn't walk. Many people in the village wanted to do some business in the market before the new year, but they had to shelve it because of the heavy snow.These days, the big guys are stuffy at home, and no one comes to the old lady to listen to the play. The old lady is bored, so she asks Gu Jiao to call Xue Ningxiang over.The old lady didn't know that Xue Ningxiang and Gu Jiao had had a quarrel. When she came here, their relationship had improved. Moreover, after Xue Ningxiang met her apprentice, she couldn't avoid men.She didn't see any affection for Xiao LIULANG.On the contrary, it was Gu Jiao, who was always sticky from time to time, which made the old lady doubt whether the little widow had taken a fancy to her granddaughter-in-law!However, Xue Ningxiang's needlework was well done and his hair was well combed, which was very popular with the old lady.Five years ago, the little brother-in-law of the frontier sent a letter to his family.Xue Ningxiang is illiterate, so she takes it to Gu Jiao.Er... Of course Gu Jiao can't read, but what makes you have the illusion that I can read all of a sudden? Why did you bring the letter for me to read to you?Gu Jiao is at a loss!\"I... I...\" seeing Gu Jiao frowning, Xue Ningxiang said in a panic, \"you... You're not stupid, I thought you could read too.\"Gu Jiao: when can we equate being not stupid with being able to read?However, Xue Ningxiang doesn't want to trouble Xiao LIULANG. First, the shadow of her heart hasn't been completely eliminated. Second, she knows that she was wrong in the past, so now she has to avoid suspicion with Xiao LIULANG.Xue Ningxiang bowed his head and didn't know what to do.Gu Jiao depressed ground grasped to grasp small head, she is also a eat soft don't eat hard. Xue Ningxiang and her horizontal, that iron horizontal but she, but Xue Ningxiang a weak, she also horizontal not up.Gu Jiao felt that her heart was not so soft, mainly because Xue Ningxiang helped her share a lot of needlework, which was a very useful neighbor.She also wants to be a useful neighbor in exchange for Xue Ningxiang to help her take on all the needlework at home in the future!Gu Jiao then took the letter to Xiao LIULANG's house. Now she doesn't need to knock at his house.Xiao LIULANG has been in bed these days. Knowing that he is going to study, Gu Jiao has made a small table that can be put on the bed. Now he is practicing calligraphy on the table.The 17-year-old boy has a thin body, cool eyebrows, jade wrists and blue temperament.How can there be such a beautiful person in the world?Gu Jiao touched her chin.\"What's the matter?\" Xiao LIULANG found that she was coming and turned to look at her.Gu Jiao stared at him several times and was caught by him. But Gu Jiao was not embarrassed once. She walked over boldly, sat down on the other side of Xiaoji, handed the letter to her and said, \"read the letter to you.\"With that, Gu Jiao saw the red paper on the table: \"eh? What's this? \"\"Red paper, from Feng Lin.\" Xiao LIULANG said that he seemed to be explaining that he didn't buy it himself.Gu Jiao didn't care about its origin. She asked curiously, \"what is it for?\"Xiao LIULANG thought about it and said, \"cut the window flowers and write Spring Festival couplets.\"Gu Jiao's eyes suddenly become bright, she has not cut the window, also has not pasted the couplet.In her previous life, she always saw other people's posts. She was envious of them. Only in her cognition, they were things that would be done when the family was reunited.She had no family to be reunited with, and she had never done such a thing.\"Do you want to write?\" Asked Xiao LIULANG.\"I will not.\" Gu Jiao bowed her head to her little index finger.Xiao LIULANG thought of the way she pointed to the words on the prescription and asked him how to read them one by one. He also thought of the way she grabbed the pen to sign before the operation without saying a word.She wanted to learn to write.Gu Jiao: no! I don't want to!Xiao LIULANG put the book and the letter on the bed and spread out the red paper: \"I'll teach you.\"Gu JiaoPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: 41Gu Jiao never thought that Xueba, who was hatched from high pressure after college entrance examination, postgraduate entrance examination and doctoral entrance examination in her previous life, had to start from a primary school chicken, and she was the worst at the field of writing brush.Gu Jiao is drooping. The whole person is not very well.Although the beauty in the side, beautiful food, but she do not practice brush, do not want!\"Start with your name.\" Xiao LIULANG said.His voice is between the voice changing period of a young man and that of a mature man. Instead of the ugly Drake's throat, it shows a trace of clean and moist.Gu Jiao is a little resistant and incompetent. She opens her eyes wide and silently sees him write down her name on the paper.Unlike what I signed on the consent form earlier, it seems more neat this time.But Gu Jiao still doesn't understand.Gu Jiao is opposite Xiao LIULANG. From her point of view, the word is inverted. Xiao LIULANG turns the paper upside down and asks Gu Jiao to read it carefully.Then he wrote the strokes and stroke order one by one on the paper.Gu Jiao looks at so many strokes, her head is big.This is not traditional Chinese characters, nor is it official script Xiaozhuan Dazhuan, but a completely unfamiliar font.Xiao LIULANG saw Gu Jiao clumsily grasp paralysis, a bitter look, said: \"the gesture is not right, hand up a little, wrist not too rigid.\"\"Is that so?\" Gu Jiao adjusted according to his explanation.Gu Jiao's gesture of holding a pen was actually standard in her previous life, but she didn't look at it enough in front of Xiao LIULANG, an ancient man.\"Index finger.\" Xiao LIULANG said.\"Well?\" Gu Jiao doubts.Xiao LIULANG hesitated for a moment, reached out her slender fingertip and gently pushed her index finger upward.If he did so on other occasions, Gu Jiao would have \"touched my fingertips, rounding them down, even if they were holding hands.\". But he is teaching her to read, rounding is class, Gu Jiao has always been very serious in class.Gu Jiao took off her shoes, sat cross legged opposite him, and practiced with every stroke.Xue Ningxiang is waiting in the main room. She doesn't understand how Gu Jiao went in so long. The letter is not long. Do you want to read it so long?Xue Ningxiang did not know that the two people in the room had completely forgotten the letter. One was reading a book, the other was practicing calligraphy.Xiao LIULANG occasionally corrects Gu Jiao's gesture of holding the pen. As for whether she writes well, he doesn't insist. After all, it's good to hold a pen for the first time and not write on the outside of the paper.If Gu Jiao knew what he thought, she was afraid that she would jump up and run away. How could she hold a brush for the first time!Gu Jiao's memory is still very good, those complicated stroke order she only wrote once, just write too ugly, some miserable.According to Xiao LIULANG's standards, he is a primary school chicken who has just held a pen.After all, he wrote better when he was two years old.The two people imperceptibly stayed in the room for half an hour. In the end, the old lady came to Gu Jiao with a boring mind and found that they were writing in the room.But the old lady didn't look close. She only glanced at the door. It was red paper.She immediately had a judgment in her heart: \"how about writing Spring Festival couplets? Well, it's time to write. If you don't write any more, you can't catch up. Call me when you've finishedShe wants to paste Spring Festival couplets!This is really a beautiful misunderstanding, but Gu Jiao didn't think Xiao LIULANG didn't come to write Spring Festival couplets with the red paper. She just happened to learn to write by herself, which delayed his progress.Now the old lady put forward that we should return to the right track and start writing Spring Festival couplets!\"I'll cut the paper!\" Gu Jiao put down her brush and went to the house to look for scissors.Thank you for saving her! If you continue to practice like this, the claws will be useless!Xiao LIULANG looked at the red paper in front of him, looking a little dazed.But when Gu Jiao cut them neatly in his hand, he wrote a few Spring Festival couplets.\"Write some for Xiao Xue, too.\" The old lady reminded me.The old lady likes Xue Ningxiang very much. Of course, she also likes Gu Jiao. She doesn't say it, but Gu Jiao can feel the kindness and malice of others.Xue Ningxiang and her first meeting with a strong malicious, now this malicious has completely disappeared.The old lady's love for Xue Ningxiang is different from her love for Gu Jiao. She likes Gu Jiao for her family, but she likes Xue Ningxiang for her master.To put it bluntly, she thinks Xue Ningxiang is a good guest, suitable for frequent contacts.As soon as the old lady said this, they finally remembered that they had forgotten Xue Ningxiang and her letter. There was a trace of embarrassment on their faces.I don't know what kind of mood Xue Ningxiang was waiting for them in the main roomHalf an hour later, Gu Jiao came to Xue's house with Xue's letter, Xiao LIULANG's Spring Festival couplets, a plate of sesame sugar and chestnut cake.\"Why so much?\" Xue Ningxiang was stunned.Of course, Gu Jiao would not say that she was here to express her apology. She said solemnly, \"it's almost new year's day. My aunt asked me to bring it here. Spring Festival couplets are for you. Chestnut cake and sesame candy are for your mother-in-law and your son.\"Xue Ningxiang quickly thanks.\"Just now...\" Gu Jiao hesitated and decided to explain.Unexpectedly, Xue Ningxiang gave her a look I understand with a bad smile.Gu Jiao: what do you know? You know it!!!Xue Ningxiang is a passer-by. The little daughter-in-law enters his husband's house and doesn't come out for a long time. What can she do?How could she be angry about such a thing? The reason why we walk away quietly is to avoid seeing what we shouldn't see and hearing what we shouldn't hear.\"Just...\" she whispered to Gu Jiao, \"next time you should remember to close the door. My aunt is still at home.\"Gu Jiao: I think you seem to have misunderstood somethingXue Ningxiang's younger brother-in-law wrote that he had made a small contribution to the frontier, became the commander of the army, and was rewarded with ten Liang silver. All the rewards are sent back to Xue Ningxiang. He asks Xue to take care of her mother-in-law and son and not treat herself harshly.He will earn a lot of silver in the future, so let her not save it.This little brother-in-law is not bad.Gu Jiao asks Xue Ningxiang if she wants to write back. Xue Ningxiang shakes her head. Everyone has gone back to celebrate the new year these days. There is no one in the post station and she can't send it.Gu Jiao gave the things to Xue Ningxiang and went home to eat them. Xue Ningxiang accepted them. She only wanted a pair of Spring Festival couplets because they were too expensive. Gu Jiao said that it was not bought outside, but written by Xiao LIULANG himself. She said, \"paper is expensive.\"The paper was given by Feng Lin, but Gu Jiao didn't care about the price. After she asked Xiao LIULANG, she found that the paper for Spring Festival couplets was several times more expensive than ordinary paper.\"It's not so expensive at ordinary times. The price will rise in the new year.\" Xiao LIULANG explained.\"Then... Is Feng Lin's family well off?\" Gu Jiao asked.Xiao LIULANG thought about it and shook his head: \"I didn't ask, but it shouldn't be very good.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: 42Feng Lin's family situation is only a little better than Xiao LIULANG, but it's not very good, which can be seen from his daily expenses.However, in dealing with Xiao LIULANG, he has always been unconditional and generous. Take the red paper this time. It costs almost half a tael of silver to buy a piece of red paper with dozens of articles.He usually chews pickled vegetables and steamed bread in the Academy.In the evening, the sky was snowing again.Feng Lin was alone in the Academy.He was reading a book in his bedroom. One oil lamp was not bright enough, but he was not willing to light the second one.There was a cold wind coming from the crack in the door, which made him shiver.He didn't burn charcoal. First, the Academy wouldn't let it burn. Second, he was reluctant to burn it.There are four people living in this house. On weekdays, all the students are there, but they don't feel so cold. Now they are all alone. They just feel that all the cold wind is pouring into his stomach.This is his first year in a foreign land.He missed his parents and his sisters, but he couldn't go back.It's far from true. It's not fake that he can save a few taels of money. Of course, what's more important is that he wants to spend all his time studying, and he doesn't want to delay a day.His family has been handed down to him for three generations, and no second son has been born in his generation. In order to support him to study, one of his sisters married a widower to fill a house, and the other was promised to a tea merchant over 50 years old.They put themselves in for him all their lives, and he had to work hard and return home in good clothes.After taking a hot breath at his hand, Feng Lin wrapped his quilt tightly and continued to read.Dong Dong!Suddenly, someone knocked on the door.Strange, this time, who will come to him?The academy is on holiday. Everyone has gone. Even the teachers have gone back for the new year. He is the only one left in the empty Academy.\"Can't it be a ghost...\" he succeeded in frightening himself, his face turned white, wrapped up the quilt and said, \"you... Who are you?\"\"It's me.\"The familiar girl's voice came from outside.Feng Lin opened the quilt, put on his shoes and went to open the door. Seeing Gu Jiao covered with snow, he thought that he might as well go to hell!This is a man's dormitory!What does a woman come here to do!!!\"Why are you here? Is something wrong with brother Xiao? \" In addition to this, Feng Lin could not think of any other reason. Without waiting for Gu Jiao to answer, he immediately put on a cloak and said to Gu Jiao, \"where is brother Xiao?\"\"At home.\" Gu Jiao said.Feng Lin left the house without saying a word.Looking at his fiery back, Gu Jiao calmly said: \"no carriage.\"Those who celebrate the new year are at risk, and they can't be hired.Feng Lin thought and said, \"can't you walk on your legs without a carriage? You must hurryGu Jiao: \"Oh.\"It's not her who can't walk.Facts have proved that Feng Lin's physical strength is not as good as Gu Jiao's. along the way, Gu Jiao's face was not red and she was out of breath, but Feng Lin almost fell down several times.When he finally got to Gu Jiao's and Xiao LIULANG's home, Feng Lin felt that his legs were no longer his own.He tried his best to open the door and looked at it, but he was made a little silly by the scene inside.I saw Xiao LIULANG sitting on the chair in the main room, watching the old lady teach Gu Xiaoshun to cut the window. How ruddy and ruddy is his look? How sick is he?\"I'm back.\" Xiao LIULANG greets them.\"It's Xiao Feng. Sit down quickly!\" The old lady also said hello.Gu Xiaoshun always looks down on Feng Lin, but today he unexpectedly doesn't look down on Feng Lin.Monk Feng Lin couldn't figure it out. He looked at Gu Jiao in a daze: \"no, it's not brother Xiao, he...\"Gu Jiao said, \"that's what you said, but I didn't say it.\"Feng LinWhy didn't you find this woman so cunning before?Feng Lin spent his first new year's Eve away from home with Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG. Because Gu Jiao and Gu Xiaoshun, whom he hated, were here, he thought they would not be comfortable, but it turned out to be an unexpected harmony.Gu Jiao made dumplings according to the custom of the village, and made sweet scented osmanthus candy New Year cake according to the custom of his and Xiao LIULANG's hometown. When the taste of his hometown came to the tip of his tongue, his tears burst out.It's not moving. It's real. It's delicious!Ah!Isn't this little villain a local? Why did Mao make the sweet rice cake so delicious?!Feng Lin was tearful.At first, he really cried because of the delicious food. Later, he recalled his missing for his hometown. He began to think about his sisters and old parents.I don't know how they've been doing this year.Gu Xiaoshun saw that he was crying so miserably. For the first time, he didn't choke him. He also gave him his share of sugar cake.This is undoubtedly a busy New Year's Eve, for Feng Lin and for Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao lived alone in the organization on New Year's Eve in her previous life. When she grew up, she was no longer an experiment in the organization, but she just moved from the laboratory to another room, and she was still the only one.Gu Xiaoshun used to take care of his family for the Spring Festival. There are many people in his family, but no one will notice him. For example, if he runs away tonight, he promises that no one will find out.The old lady can't remember how she spent the past years. Anyway, she had a good time this year. He pasted the couplet in person and taught Gu Xiaoshun to cut the window flowers. As expected, it was worse than her. His heart was in balance! In addition, Jiaojiao also made an exception to let her eat five preserves, usually only to eat two.Xiao LIULANG is very calm, he has never been a person of joy and anger, but Gu Jiao can still feel the melancholy on him.More than usual.Several of them stayed up until midnight.There are only three rooms in the house. It's not easy for the old lady to be crowded with people. Gu Jiao then cleans up Xiao LIULANG's room and lets Feng Lin stay temporarily.No matter how good the relationship between Feng Lin and Xiao LIULANG is, he doesn't know that they haven't lived together so far. He's very happy to stay.On the night of the inn, it was the second time for them to sleep together. Gu Jiao's bed was much wider than that of the inn, and her quilt was thick enough.New year's Eve is not off, the oil lamp on the table exudes a weak light.Two people lie in respective bedclothes, Xiao LIULANG closed his eyes, Gu Jiao knew that he was not asleep.\"Have you had a good year?\" Gu Jiao asked softly.Without waiting for Xiao LIULANG to answer, a small slender hand reached into his quilt and grasped his cold and stiff hand.Gu Jiao: \"next year will be better.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: 43Xiao LIULANG hates New Year's Eve, because every new year's Eve night, he dreams of boundless fire.He tried not to fall asleep, but as soon as he closed his eyes, he could feel the despair in the fire.\"Xiao LIULANG, first of all, we are just nominal couples! You can't do anything to me! \" Gu Jiao said seriously.\"Who's going to do anything to you?\" He turned his face irritably.Gu Jiao brought a bowl of water: \"who can guarantee that? You guys have one thing on your lips, another on your back! In order to prevent you from doing bad things, I'll put a bowl of water here. If you dare to climb over and knock over this bowl of water in the middle of the night, you are a beast! \"\"Well, if I come here, I'm a beast!\"How could he be there?He has no idea of this woman!When he woke up the next day, he looked at Gu Jiao with a dazed face, as if to say, what's up? I'm just not interested in you, am I?But instead of being happy, Gu Jiao gave him a slap: \"you are not as good as animals!\"Xiao LIULANG woke up with a start!He sat up and found that this was not his own room. There were some crooked words of blessing on the wall and some ugly flowers on the window.They are all masterpieces of the old lady and Gu Xiaoshun.Xiao LIULANG finally remembered where it was. He looked to his side.Gu Jiao lies on his side and sleeps. She has a baby's fat cheek and pouts.She held on to his hand all night.Xiao LIULANG thought of that strange animal dream. His handsome little brow frowned and coldly took away Gu Jiao's hand!In her sleep, Gu Jiao was despised. She grunted discontentedly and grabbed his hand again.Xiao LIULANG also took her hand away again, but it was useless. She still entangled her.I don't know how many times he struggled. In the end, he was tired and fell asleep.The nightmare didn't appear until dawn.--Feng Lin lived in Qingquan village for three days, and Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao collapsed and slept together for three nights. Except for the first night, she grabbed his hand, and then she didn't have it. It was all hands and feet. When Xiao LIULANG woke up, he could always find their bedclothes together.Xiao LIULANG was angry and would ask her: \"do you... Do you mean it?\"\"Well?\" Gu Jiao will look at him blankly.Xiao LIULANG was not sure for a moment who was sleeping dishonestly. Maybe he was the one who turned people into bedToday is Xiao LIULANG's day to remove stitches. In fact, Gu Jiao can also remove stitches at home, but it's easy to expose. Moreover, the old lady has finished her traditional Chinese medicine. It's time to catch new ones.Although that prescription is only adjuvant treatment, it will be better with it.After breakfast, Gu Jiao, Xiao LIULANG and Feng Lin went to the town's rejuvenation hall in Uncle Luo's ox cart.All of you have gone back for the Spring Festival. There are only two owners, manager Wang and the old doctor who has been pretending to be a famous doctor for Xiao LIULANG.Three people are specially come from home, want to see the effect after the stitching.Don't mention them, even Gu Jiao is looking forward to it.She made sure there were no mistakes in the operation, but how well she recovered depends on the final result.The thread was removed by the old doctor, and he still has this skill.After the demolition, everyone's eyes fell on Xiao LIULANG.There are so many things related to this operation that the second owner has not given up the idea of treating the young Marquis, even though he was scolded by his father when he returned to Beijing for the Spring Festival.Shopkeeper Wang is looking forward to the success of the operation. After all, he is a man of conscience; But he also hopes that the operation will fail. After all, the premise of being a conscientious person is that he must be a person first, and death is a ghost.Treat the young marquis. He will really die!Xiao LIULANG sat on the chair, his legs and feet had been slowly moved to the ground, and his crutch was beside him, but he didn't reach for it.He stood up holding the chair, first with his uninjured left foot. When he took the first step with his right foot, he felt that the sole of his foot was soft, and the whole person rushed forward!Gu Jiao quickly held him and hugged him.As for the couple, others didn't say anything, but Xiao LIULANG's ears were scalded.Gu Jiao didn't notice that he was different. All her attention was on his ankle.\"Are you all right?\" She asked, staring at his ankle.Xiao LIULANG shook his head: \"it's OK.\"He had been injured for half a year, so he pestered his crutch for half a year. There was little force on his right foot. Every time he was forced, he would feel the pain of heart drilling.It didn't stop just now, but it didn't seem to hurt.Xiao LIULANG took the crutch and tried to walk again. He was sure that it didn't hurt any more.He has no expression all the time, but this time he is a little stupefied, as if he didn't expect that he could really get to this point.I thought I would be lame and painful all my life\"Brother Xiao, are you good or not?\" Feng Lin asked anxiously.\"I don't hurt any more, but I have no strength.\" Xiao LIULANG said.Feng Lin couldn't help asking: \"well... Is that really good? Why is there no strength? \"The old doctor said slowly: \"don't worry, Mr. Feng. Mr. Xiao doesn't hurt any more, which means the operation is very successful. But after all, I've been injured for a long time, blood stasis, muscle weakness, ankle stiffness, and need careful conditioning and hard training. \"\"Can you recover as before?\" Asked Feng Lin anxiously.The old doctor looked at Gu Jiao without any trace and said with a smile, \"as long as young master Xiao is not afraid of hard work.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: 44The success of the operation gave the two owners great encouragement. He decided to talk about the reception with Gu Jiao.Of course, because it's very important, some news that has nothing to do with the patient's condition can not be explained first, for example, if the patient can't be cured, he will be beheaded and so onWho knows he didn't say who the other party was, he was rejected by Gu Jiao.\"Why?\" The second owner was shocked.Gu Jiao said: \"it's too far away. I don't go out. You tell him that if he wants to treat a disease, let him come to the rejuvenation hall by himself. \"\"I...\" the two owners are confused. They can even invite the imperial doctor to the mansion. How can they condescend to come to a small town hospital?\"Not far, not far, in the hot spring villa near Qingquan Town,\" the second owner said with a smileGu Jiao pick eyebrow: \"all out of town, not far?\"\"...\" the two masters were speechless.The second owner often thinks that Gu Jiao is too capable to be a village woman. However, at this moment, she thinks that the hot spring villa is 20 miles away, and her strength explains what it means to be a village woman who has never been far away.The second owner looked at Gu Jiao with some grievances: \"it's agreed that they will receive treatment once a month.\"Gu Jiao said, \"yes, it's a visit, but it's not a visit.\"The second owner\"If Miss Gu didn't promise, she didn't promise. At least she saved our life.\" Shopkeeper Wang was relieved to learn that Gu Jiao refused.\"What do you know?\" he said? All my posts have been handed out.... \"Shopkeeper Wang was so surprised that he jumped up: \"master! What are you talking about? \"The second owner coughed and said, \"I'm thinking that she can cure young master Xiao? I just... I delivered the invitation in advance. \"Quan Zhaoguo knows that the young master of the Marquis's residence in Ding'an is ill. Even if he is cured, the consequences are very serious, but there must be brave men under the heavy money. There are still many doctors queuing up to see the young master.If you just send the post now, when you get to them, you may not be dead.Shopkeeper Wang doesn't know what to say about the second owner!Gu Jiao knew nothing about the conversation between the two owners and shopkeeper Wang. She went to the lobby to catch the medicine. In order not to let people see that she was catching the medicine for the treatment of leprosy, she added several kinds of herbs, which happened to be able to make some golden ulcer medicine at home.Feng Lin returned to the Academy, and Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG returned to the village in Uncle Luo's ox cart.Although Xiao LIULANG didn't feel any pain, he couldn't recover his strength in his right leg and couldn't get rid of his crutch for the time being.He walked back with Gu Jiao clutching a crutch and saw a carriage parked at their door from a distance. The emblem on the carriage was familiar.As if the carriage had just arrived, the coachman lifted the curtain and helped a middle-aged man down.\"Excuse me, is this Xiao LIULANG's home?\" The middle-aged man asked politely outside the door.\"I am.\" Xiao LIULANG made a faint voice.The middle-aged man turned around and saw Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao with a gentle smile: \"I'm the steward of Tianxiang Academy. My name is Liu. The dean and my master asked me to send some things.\"If Gu's family were here, he would be recognized as the man who sent Gu Xiaoshun the entrance documents.He took out a letter from his bundle and handed it to Xiao LIULANG: \"this is from the dean.\" Took a brocade box to Gu Jiao again, \"this is what my master gave to young master Gu.\"As soon as they heard that Gu Xiaoshun had a part, they guessed who the master was.Xiao LIULANG took the letter and Gu Jiao took the brocade box.Gu Jiao said: \"Liu steward, come in and sit down.\"Liu Guanshi laughed: \"no, I have something else to do. I'll go first.\"At this time, the aunt inside called Xiao LIULANG, Xiao LIULANG clutching crutches into the house.Steward Liu took out a brocade bag from his arms and handed it to Gu Jiao: \"this is a gift from my master.\"\"Why give it to me?\" Gu Jiao asked.Liu was in charge, but he didn't smile. He turned and got on the carriage.Gu Jiao went back to the house to see what the old man had sent. She gave Gu Xiaoshun a very delicate Langhao pen, while she gave her a piece of warm jade with soft touch.Her constitution is cold, warm jade wearing on the body, almost like a mini version of the warm baby.Even if Gu Jiao no longer knows anything, she can see that it's a piece of precious jade, and its value is never under Gu Xiaoshun's pen.Gu Jiao held her chin and murmured: \"well, I thought I had concealed it...\"So my grandfather knew it was her.Gu Jiao is very satisfied with her new year's gift. She runs to see what the Dean has sent to Xiao LIULANG. As a result, she sees Xiao LIULANG with a black face, sitting in a chair, eager to tear something up.\"What's the matter?\" Gu Jiao poked out a cerebellar pouch and asked.Xiao LIULANG wants to destroy the evidence he shouldn't have, but Gu Jiao has come over and successfully picked up the document in his hand.\"What is this? It seems to have the official seal of the Yamen. \" Gu Jiao pointed to a word she had just learned on the document and said, \"try. Is there a test? \"\"... well, county test.\"Hateful Dean, even behind his back, reported to him this month's County test!He doesn't want to try at all!!!\"You did?\" Gu Jiao asked.\"The Dean reported it.\" Xiao LIULANG gritted his teeth.This makes Gu Jiao surprised: \"did the whole class report?\"\"I don't think so.\" Xiao LIULANG said.Yes, Gu Xiaoshun didn't.Xiao LIULANG is a famous penultimate in his class. From enrollment to annual leave, he never jumped out of the penultimate three in an exam. On this kind of mud can not help the wall, the president did not give up, but also personally reported to him for the county test, what a great people's teacher!The image of the president in Gu Jiao's mind suddenly became tall!\"Xianggong, I think we should visit the dean and give him some gifts!\" Gu Jiao's eyes are bright. In her previous life, she wanted to bribe the teacher, but on the one hand, no one bribed her. On the other hand, she didn't need to bribe her because of her good grades.Xianggong's grades are so poor, don't you hurry to have a good relationship with the president?\"No.\" Xiao LIULANG refused. Seeing Gu Jiao looking at herself in amazement, he turned his head and said, \"it's too far away.\"\"Where is it?\" Gu Jiao askedXiao LIULANG pressed down his conscience to rebel: \"near the hot spring villa, they are all out of town.\"Gu Jiao lost her memory for a second: \"not far, not far! It's not far at all! You are at home, and Xiaoshun and I will go tomorrow! \"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: 45Xiao LIULANG really doesn't want Gu Jiao to visit the old fox of the Dean, but this proposal has been unanimously approved by his family, who are aunts.Old lady: \"well, it's time to visit.\"Xiao LIULANG went back to the house with the quilt in his arms.Gu Jiao looked at him in surprise: \"are you still sleeping on my side tonight?\"Xiao LIULANG's heart suddenly a burst of embarrassment: \"wrong way.\"Gu Jiao picked her eyebrows and put her hands around her chest: \"I haven't seen you go wrong after living in Westinghouse for half a year. I went wrong after living here for three days.\"Xiao LIULANG choked and his ears turned red. He said angrily, \"it's all wrong!\"Gu Jiao calm: \"Oh.\"Xiao LIULANG--Gu Jiao did what she said and counted out the annual gifts of bribing the teacher that night.The next day Gu Xiaoshun came to have breakfast. He heard that his elder sister was going to take him to visit the Dean near the hot spring villa. He was so excited that he cried.I'm so big! I haven't been out this far!I'm so big! My sister hasn't taken me out yet!The truth is... If Gu Jiao didn't take him with her, Xiao LIULANG would not allow a girl to go out so far alone.It's impossible to take a bullock cart there. The bullock cart is too slow. It may be dark. They are still wandering on the way, but all the car shops in the town are closed, and the carriage can't be hired.After thinking twice, Gu Jiao and her younger brother appear in the rejuvenation hall.In the face of Gu Jiao, who suddenly arrived, the second owner looked inexplicable: \"what advice does Miss Gu have?\"Gu Jiao said without changing her face: \"I've thought about it. It's not far from the hot spring villa. It's only an hour to take a carriage. Let's go now! You have a carriage, don't youI vowed not to go out for a visit yesterday. Why did I change my mind in one night?The second owner looked suspiciously at the bundle she was holding in her hand, and Gu Xiaoshun, who was also holding a big bundle outside the door, \"why do you still have a person and so many things? Are they all for curing diseases? \"Gu Jiao shook her head with a smile: \"these are the annual gifts for the president. I forgot to say that the president of my husband lives near the hot spring villa. After seeing the patient, I can stop by to visit his old man!\"A mouthful of tea from the second owner almost came out. I think it's urgent for you to visit the dean. It's a good way to treat someone's illness. It's not painful to say that the carriage is so fresh and refined!!!The second owner finally compromised.The second owner, Gu Jiao, Gu Xiaoshun and the old doctor got on the carriage together.The carriage ran very fast and arrived at the house near the hot spring villa in less than an hour. The high plaque said Li Fu.This should be the departure of the president.It is said that the president was an official in Beijing. His mother was seriously ill, so he resigned and left Beijing. He bought a separate house here for his mother to live in.Gu Jiao and Gu Xiaoshun get out of the car and knock on the closed door.A little while later, a servant opened the door for them and saw that they were two poor dressed countrymen. Instead of showing any contempt, he politely asked, \"are you...\"Gu Jiao said, \"my husband and my brother are students of Tianxiang Academy. They have come to visit the president of Tianxiang Academy.\"\"Ah.\" The servant was astonished.\"What's the matter?\" An old voice came from the house.The servant turned back quickly and said, \"if you go back to the old lady, it's the master's student!\"The old lady said in a confused voice, \"why don't you invite people in soon? It's freezing. Let's go in and have a cup of hot tea. \"Although Gu Jiao had never met the Dean, the attitude of his family and servants was very comfortable.The servant opened the door and said, \"please come in with me, sir. He's out fishing. If it's fast, he may come back soon. If it's slow, he may come back after dark. Just now that is my old lady, the master's motherThe servant took them to see Mrs. Li, but when they came to her bed, she was already asleep.Old lady Li is an old woman. She is like a baby. She wakes up and sleeps every day.\"Come and have a seat in the teahouse. I'll give you some tea.\" The servants took Gu Jiao and Gu Xiaoshun to the teahouse, served tea and burned charcoal. They were very considerate, not slighted by their humble status.Gu Jiao sat for a while and figured that the Dean would not come back so soon, and Mrs. Li didn't wake up so soon, so she told her servant to go to the Dean herself.The fishing place was not too far, and the servant showed her the way.\"I'm going too.\" Gu Xiaoshun said.Gu Jiao coaxed: \"if the old lady wakes up and finds us both out, she will feel that we are neglecting.\"\"Oh.\" Gu Xiaoshun obediently stayed.Gu Jiao out of the house, turned on the second master's carriage.\"I thought it would be a long time.\" The second owner said.\"The dean is not here.\" Gu Jiao asked, \"where is the patient you mentioned?\"\"Oh, there.\" The second owner waved his hand and saw the end of the path leading to the Castle Peak. The beautiful scenery at the foot of the mountain and the well-known hot spring villa in the Marquis's mansion of Ding'an.About the identity of the other party, the second owner didn't introduce too much, but said that it was the youngest son of a marquis in the capital. He was born prematurely and had a weakness from his mother's womb. After many years of searching for famous doctors, he didn't look very good.\"That young man is about your age. It is said that he will not live to be 15 years old.\" The second owner said with regret.\"Isn't that one year left?\" Gu Jiao is 14 years old this year.\"Isn't it? However, it may not last until June. \"\"Is he really so ill?\"The second owner sighed and nodded: \"yes, poor madam Hou, there is only one son under her knee.\"Although the young master still has a sister, it can't make up for the loss of his son.These have nothing to do with the disease of information, two owners did not account with Gu Jiao.While talking, the carriage came to the entrance of the hot spring villa.Here stands a huge cornice archway, with gilded characters written hot spring villa, and on the right side of the word stands a line of cursive script - Ding'an Marquis house.Several people got out of the carriage.Gu Jiao stands under the grand archway, as small as a rabbit.The style of Hou's mansion is displayed incisively and vividly, and this is just a villa in its name.The second owner passed by the villa many times, but it was the first time he really came here. To be honest, he was also shocked by the archway in front of him. Of course, what he doesn't know is that Gu Jiao's reason for staring at the archway in a daze is not because she was shocked. She is just thinking about whether the gold on the archway is real.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: 46There are two bodyguards under the archway, which are different from the big families' nursing homes in the town. They are big, sharp eyed, armed with long guns, and tall and straight. At first sight, they know that they are well-trained and well regulated.Due to many days in advance to the post, the name of the two owners in the book, the bodyguard let him in.He pointed to the old doctor and Gu Jiao and said, \"our doctor in the rejuvenation hall and his medicine boy.\"It's not common for women to be drug children, but it's not without them.The bodyguard didn't say anything, but doubted Gu Jiao's little basket.\"What's in it?\" A bodyguard asked.Gu Jiao showed him the basket directly.The bodyguard turned over and found that there were some mountain goods and a shabby small box inside. He returned the basket to Gu Jiao.\"Go straight along this road, and you'll be welcomed through the first Pavilion.\" The bodyguard showed the way to the three men.The second owner bowed his hand to thank him, and walked towards the pavilion with Gu Jiao and the old doctor.After a few steps, another carriage came out of the archway. The second owner thought he was from the villa. He didn't care much about it, but he was stopped by a neutral voice: \"what's the man ahead?\"The second owner turned around in surprise and saw a fat man who was about the same age as shopkeeper Wang walking towards him.The man was followed by a doctor in his fifties and a little medicine boy with a medicine box on his back.The second owner's face sank.But the man didn't seem to see his disgust. He walked forward with a smile and gave a salute: \"it's a coincidence that we met here. Do you know that I will bring someone to treat the young master, so you are waiting for me here? But who are these two? \"\"The doctor of rejuvenation hall.\" The second owner said lightly.Both of them. The second boss didn't elaborate, but the man took it for granted that the doctor was only the old doctor. The ugly girl with birthmark on her face was just a little medicine boy.\"Who is he?\" Gu Jiao asked the second owner.The second owner looked at the man coldly and said, \"the manager of the Hu family is the manager of the capital rejuvenation hall.\"\"My name is ho.\" He Guanshi said to Gu Jiao with a smile.Gu Jiao glanced at him askance: \"lotus of lotus? The white one. \"What's in charge of itI feel like she's scolding me.\"Let's go.\" The second owner didn't want to talk to him.But he Guanshi stopped him again, a little more sarcastic in his tone: \"it turns out that the master is also here to treat the young master. Do you know about it?\"Naturally... I don't know. If he told his family about it, he would be the first to disagree.The second owner clenched his fist and his face became very ugly.At this time, Gu Jiao said: \"who is the master? Who is the big boss? \"The second owner took a deep breath: \"the master is my father, the big owner... Is my brother.\"Gu Jiao did not understand: \"why did your brother become a big owner? You're only the second owner? Are you a commoner? \"not.He's the first one.He is the real eldest son of the Hu family.However, his mother left early, and his father married Xuxian. Soon after, his stepmother gave birth to a younger brother. His younger brother is smarter than him, and more pleasing to the old man than him.The old man gradually forgot that there was such an eldest son as him. He threw him to the rejuvenation hall in a remote town on the ground of his mediocrity and incompetence, and the family business of the Hu family was almost handed over to his younger brother.As a second owner, he is actually a good one.Shopkeeper he is just a shopkeeper, but he is a confidant of the big boss, and he doesn't pay attention to the second boss, the head of the Hu family: \"the little childe of Ding'an Marquis's house is not the common people in the town. If you die, you will die. Don't harm the whole Hu family beyond your ability!\"Gu Jiao looked at him and said irritably, \"you like to sing so much. Are you a rooster?\"Shopkeeper he choked.Gu Jiao left.They passed through the pavilion and met several servants of the villa.The clothes of the lower class are more respectable than those of the big families in the town, and their appearance and bearing are not vulgar. Although they are not as simple as the servants of the Dean, they all follow the rules and make no mistakes.Gu Jiao three people are led away by a small Si, manager he three talents come over.\"It's the rejuvenation hall again? How many people have come to huichuntang? \" It was a clever servant girl who received manager he.Although manager he has the support of the Hu family and the rejuvenation hall behind him, he doesn't dare to take Joe with any of the servant girls in the Hou family.Shopkeeper he said with a polite smile: \"girl, look at this token carefully. I'm from Beijing rejuvenation hall. Those are from Qingquan rejuvenation hall. It has nothing to do with our Beijing rejuvenation hall and Hu family! If something happens later, I hope you don't blame our rejuvenation hall. \"\"Isn't it all rejuvenation hall?\" Asked the maid.\"Not the same, not the same.\" Shopkeeper he said with a smile.The servant girl thought, \"do you just happen to have the same name of the hospital?\"\"Er... You can say so.\" Shopkeeper he couldn't find a more suitable explanation for a while.The servant girl nodded: \"know, our Hou mansion won't involve irrelevant people.\"Shopkeeper he breathed a sigh of relief. The mediocre man could not get a powerful doctor. Otherwise, he would not have borrowed Dr. Zhang from the rejuvenation hall in the capital. This time, it would be a bad thing.Thanks to his cleverness, he broke away from his uncle in time.He Guanshi three people walk fast, Gu Jiao three people arrive, they also arrived.The maid who accompanied with shopkeeper he opened the curtain and went into the main room. She whispered to the steward, \"those three are from the rejuvenation hall in the capital. These three are from the town.\"This means, like Gu Jiao three people are rubbing their reputation.This kind of thing is in charge of the Mammy to see many, but since all came, there is no reason not to see a doctor and then blow people out, she said: \"let the three come first.\"\"Good.\" The servant girl should come down.The servant girl called in three people of manager he.Young master has been ill for many years, and he has invited many doctors. However, every doctor has been given a password after seeing a doctor. Therefore, people don't know what ails young master and how much he is ill.Shopkeeper he brought with him a miracle doctor who was known as Hua Tuo in Jiangnan. He was especially good at difficult and miscellaneous diseases. Before he came, they were both full of confidence. However, after only one look, the miracle doctor was stupid.\"What's the matter, doctor Liao?\" Shopkeeper he asked.Instead of answering shopkeeper he's words, doctor Liao turned to the servant girl in the room and asked, \"how long have you been in a coma?\"\"Ten days.\" Said the maid.Doctor Liao turned pale.He hardened his head and gave the young master a pulse. Then he staggered to his feet.\"I'm sorry that Liao's medical skill is too shallow to cure the young master. Please be wise in your house.\"What he really wants to say is that your young master is suffering from a heart disease, which can't be cured. He has been in a coma for ten days and can't be saved. Let's get ready for the future!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: 47With that, doctor Liao fled. He was afraid that he would not be able to leave if he didn't go any more. As soon as the young master died, he would be put to death!\"Ah! Doctor Liao, doctor Liao He Guanshi didn't expect that the great master hired a great deal of money to be so frustrated that he ran away without any treatment!However, he also understood why Dr. Liao ran away. The young master's condition was too bad. Not all the doctors knew that he was going to die.No wonder I heard that Mrs. Hou, who has not lived for many years, kneels up the mountain day by day, kowtows step by step and prays for the blessing of Bodhisattva for her little son.It's really beyond human power to recoverHe Guanshi chased out.The little medicine boy also followed the master and ran away quickly. He Guanshi didn't even catch up with him.Two owners see three people rush out, the bottom of my heart has an unknown guess, see Gu Jiao up to go inside, he suddenly grabbed Gu Jiao's wrist: \"I suddenly remember that there is something else in the rejuvenation hall.\"Gu Jiao: \"Oh, then you go back to deal with it.\"Second owner: \"you go back with me.\"The second owner wants Gu Jiao to cure the young master, which is based on the premise that Gu Jiao can cure each other, but he's in charge of the three people's appearance makes him waver.He is in charge of the affairs of his younger brother. He is still clear about his brother's ability. The local doctor must be invited. As soon as the doctor goes in, he leaves. It only shows that the young master is really incurable.There may be tens of thousands of medical skills for treatment, but only one is enough to determine death.He can't fool Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao goes in now, the young master may die directly in front of her, so she can't retreat all over again.Gu Jiao certainly can't understand his meaning.She had been a doctor in her previous life, but that was just the cover of her identity. She was not a good person in essence, and she would not gamble her own life.\"OK, let's go.\" Gu Jiao nodded.Just as Gu Jiao turned around, her heart suddenly pulled out.\"Childe -\" the servant girl screamed in the inner room.The young master convulsed on the bed.Gu Jiao suddenly felt uncomfortable.She was absolutely sure that she was not ill, so the feeling of panic was almost inexplicable.\"Do I have such medical ethics? Does it make my conscience upset to the point of heartache to leave the patient alone? \"He hurts, and so does she.It's strange.Gu Jiao finally went in.There is a royal doctor in the family. He is dispensing medicine for the young master in the pharmacy. He is not in the young master's room. The next people hurry to invite him.In the chaos, no one cares if Gu Jiao enters the house.When Gu Jiao came to the bed, he had no heartbeat.Gu Jiao's face became serious. Without saying a word, she went to bed, knelt on the side of the young master, pressed his chest with her hands, and began to do emergency cardiac resuscitation for him.\"Gu Gu...\" as soon as the second owner came into the room, she was shocked by the scene. What was the girl doing to the young master?Gu Jiao can't take care of the fact that the medicine box isn't exposed now, so she says: \"hold the door! Don't let anyone in\"... good!\" The second owner's brain was wooden, but he closed the door as fast as he could.The old doctor stayed in the room to see what he could help.Gu Jiao pressed for a while, the other side did not have any reaction: \"take out my medicine box! Oil lamps and candles are on! All of youThe old doctor quickly took out the small broken box in the basket, but found that he could not open it.Gu Jiao opened her own medicine box and went to light the oil lamp and candle.Gu Jiao gave little childe intravenous injection of adrenaline.The old doctor was stunned. What strange thing did the girl take to tie the young master's veins?After the first epinephrine injection, the effect is not ideal.At this time, the steward and servant girl of Houfu came with the royal doctor. The second owner remembered Gu Jiao's advice and took a big step to block their way.\"Who are you?\" The steward asked in a bad way.Just now, the one who brought Gu Jiao was a young man. He had already gone out. Only a servant girl of Yu ya'er recognized him. Yu ya'er was the servant who brought manager he.Yu ya'er pointed to him and said, \"I know it! He's the one who pretends to be the rejuvenation hall in BeijingThe second owner said, \"what's the fake? We are the members of the rejuvenation hall! It's just not the one in Beijing! \"Yu ya'er complains: \"look, Mammy! He admitted itThe second owner is confused, isn't it, girl? Is that what I mean?Although the steward didn't misinterpret the meaning of the two masters, she didn't look up to the hospitals outside the capital. The reason why she could let them in was that Mrs. Hou was desperate and a dead horse should be a live horse doctor.\"What do you mean you're stuck here?\" She asked coldly.The second owner emboldened himself and said, \"the doctor of our rejuvenation hall is rescuing your young master. If you don't want your young master to have an accident, you'd better not go in and disturb her!\"\"Mammy, they cheat!\" A little maid said.She saw it all in the room. The young master is out of breath!\"Are you sure you can save young master?\" The steward's stern voice was like a knife hanging over the head of the second master.The second owner's back burst out in a cold sweat.What a cunning Mammy, it's their responsibility. If something happens to the young master, it's not their poor care, but the treatment of the rejuvenation hall.In fact, they have taken good care of them, but if the young master dies, someone will have to bear the anger of the Lord and the lady.Who wants to be himself?The two owners are shaking.Miss Gu, can you do it or not?no way.I've already used three epinephrines!The old doctor also gradually realized that something was wrong. Even though he didn't know how these strange injections came from, he also understood that they must be used to prolong his life.\"Miss Gu... Give up...\"\"I'll try again!\" Gu Jiao count good time, push the fourth injection into the little boy's body.It's been four times. If this one doesn't work any more, she'll be helplessPeople outside the door can't wait any longer. Every minute is a torment for them.The cold sweat of the second owner was dripping on the ground.The steward's eyes lit up: \"knock the door open for me!\"Two powerful servants pushed the two masters to one side and raised their feet to kick the door. Suddenly, the maid named Yu ya'er opened her mouth: \"mammy! Listen to meThe steward made a gesture and everyone was quiet.\"... it's noisy.\"It's the voice of young master.Very small, very weak.They haven't heard the voice of young master for ten days. They really thought he was going, but just now... Just now\"Did you and you all hear that?\" The steward felt so nervous for the first time.Everyone nodded.It's weak, but they do hear it!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: 48Soon the door opened from the inside.It was quiet in the room, and the candles that had been lit up had gone out one by one, and the light was dim.The old doctor fell to the ground, and his whole body seemed to be dead.To tell you the truth, he didn't rescue people. He just helped to take a box, light a few oil lamps and candles. However, he was the only one who saw Gu Jiao pull people back from the palace of hell.How thrilling that process was. He had never met it before and will never meet it again.The stewardess mother asked the servant girl to help him up, while she went to the bed with small steps. As a result, she saw a little girl dressed as a village girl sitting on the edge of her little master's bed.This is the bed of Prince Hou!Where come of wild wench, dare to dirty little childe's bed!Although the mother opened her mouth to scold, she unexpectedly found that it was not the other party who was lying on her bed, but the young man who grabbed the girl's hand.The steward mother is Mrs. Hou's companion. She watched the young master grow up. What kind of virtue the young master has... Er, no, she can't be more clear about what kind of character he has. He's aloof, inhumane and not close to others, which is the hand of his mother and sister.The steward suspected that she had lost her sight. She went forward to see that she was not clever. She was really grabbed by her own young master, who pinched the back of other people's hands.It's rare that this girl doesn't feel pain to get rid ofThe young master fell asleep again. His breath and face were completely different from those when he was in a coma, so the steward could see that he was getting better.\"Ah, how can, just clearly...\" the little girl who followed in opened her eyes.\"Shut up Steward mother stopped her, big new year, she dares to say a little childe is not angry, she tore her mouth!\"Cough, this is my medicine boy.\" The old doctor explained.It turned out to be the medicine boy of huichuntang.The steward's look was more polite, and she asked in a soft voice, \"did my little son wake up just now?\"\"Well.\" Gu Jiao nodded and turned her head to look at her. \"After waking up for a while, she took the medicine and went to sleep again.\"As Gu Jiao turns her face around, the steward sees her left face clearly. She has such a big birthmark. It's a pity that she thinks she is a little beautyShe originally thought that if the young master really took a fancy to this girl, it would not be impossible to be a considerate person in the room.Young master's eyebrows are stretched out. It seems that he is very comfortable to sleep. The steward can't remember how long he hasn't had a good sleep. He always falls asleep, and then he starts to be out of breath, otherwise he will have night sweats, colic and palpitations.The steward didn't dare to disturb her and stood silently.Gu Jiao just busy rescue, didn't look at his appearance, this will son a careful look, just found that he looks not like words.What a beautiful little girl! It's a foul!OK, for the sake of your beauty, I allow you to hold your hand.The floor of the room was burned with earthworm, which dissipated heat evenly. It was not dry, and it was very comfortable.Gu Jiao sleepy meaning attack, head bit by bit began to peck rice chicks, I do not know how many times to cut, a sound of Dong lying down.The old doctor and the steward were startled to see that Gu Jiao fell asleep beside the young master's pillow. They were so scared that the old doctor couldn't even speak!The steward's mouth draws out and flies. She pulls your hand to give you face. Who let you fall asleep beside the young master's pillow? Put your nose on your face, right!The steward mother doesn't care if she wakes up the little childe. She will pull Gu Jiao up in two or three steps. But when she reaches out her hand, the sleeping little childe seems to wake up.He describes the thin skin, thinner than ordinary people's skin, skin can see light blue blood vessels.He gave the steward a cold look.The steward shivered and staggered several steps by the look in her eyes!The young master of the Hou family is famous for his bad temper and unkind attitude. He is also suffering from serious illness. No one dares to do anything about him. His style is totally unreasonable.None of the servant girls in his room can do it for a month. They are either expelled by him or scared away by him.The steward is Mrs. Hou's confidant, otherwise she would have been expelled by him many times.The steward didn't dare to be tough with him. She laughed and said softly, \"little...\"Young master: \"go away!\"Steward: YesThe steward went out in a hurry.The old doctor was at a loss: that... Do I want to go out?No one cares!What a pity!The young master looked at the sleeping person lying on his pillow. Her face was towards him. Half of her face was pressed out of her. Her mouth was chubby and cute.What she showed was her left face with a birthmark.Mr. Gu hated anything with defects and refused anyone's approach.This time alone is an exception.He didn't think she was ugly at all. He looked at her sleeping and listened to her breathing. A feeling of wanting to be close to her suddenly rose in his heart.Ordinary people may have some scruples, but Mr. Gu is not an ordinary person. He lived a life of waiting for death from birth. How could such a person care about secular rules?He felt comfortable to be close to her, so he did.Mr. Gu leaned against her and held her hand. Instead of releasing it, he weakly raised his other hand and even his quilt for her.Then he lay next to her and fell asleep with great ease.When Mr. Gu woke up, Gu Jiao was no longer there. He angrily tore off several of his father's antique paintings of the previous dynasty!!!--After leaving the villa, the two masters asked about the young master's illness.Gu Jiao did not answer, but first asked: \"how does the imperial doctor say?\"The second master was not idle outside. He inquired about the situation with the royal doctor. The royal doctor was quite generous and told the second master what he knew: \"it's lack of heart qi, blood stasis and heart disease.\"\"What do you think of Dr. Li?\" Gu Jiao asked.The old doctor also gave the pulse to the young master when he was asleep. He said thoughtfully, \"it should be a heart disease.\"Gu Jiao is silent. In fact, the result of her diagnosis is similar to that of the two. In the words of previous life, he suffered from congenital heart disease.This disease was too difficult to cure in ancient times.Medicine alone is not enough. She has to have an operation. This operation is much more complicated than Xiao LIULANG's. she does not have the corresponding operation conditions at present.\"Miss Gu, can you cure it?\" Asked the second owner.Gu Jiao thought about it and said, \"I left him some medicine. Let's treat it conservatively first.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: 49But he said that after he escaped from the villa, he did not leave immediately, but waited for the movement of the villa not far away.Young master, I don't know if that fool will run into him like this?If the young master really died in his hands, the Hu family is afraid that there will be no place for him any more!He shopkeeper is secretly pleased, see Gu Jiao three people safe and sound from the villa.He was just stunned.What happened?Isn't young master dead? Or did they run away without any treatment, just like their own side?But look at their calm, not likeShopkeeper he's amazing Kung Fu. Gu Jiao and her three go to Dean Li's residence in a carriage.The maid named Yu ya'er ran after her: \"Oh! Rejuvenation hall! You wait! \"But the carriage had gone so far that her cry could not be heard.Yu ya'er is holding the pillar of the archway and panting.Shopkeeper he came out from behind the tree, came to her and asked, \"girl, what happened to the three of them?\"Yu ya'er said, \"what can happen to them? It's my little boy... \"Shopkeeper he's eyes are bright!Are you really killed by them?Yu ya'er took a breath, and then said, \"my little boy wakes up. He has a big temper!\"Shopkeeper he knows every word, but together he doesn't understand: \"it's the disease of young master...\"\"There is a miracle doctor in huichuntang! My little boy is awake! There is still strength to be angry Yuya'er was so happy that his young master tore up four antique paintings of houye in one breath. He hasn't been so powerful in a whole year!Shopkeeper he said that he couldn't keep up with the other party's thinkingYu ya'er reproached herself and sighed: \"it's our fault that we are so happy that we forget to give them a diagnosis!\"\"Wait, you mean... They...\" shopkeeper he didn't dare to say anything. It's impossible!Unexpectedly, Yu ya'er nodded and said, \"mm-hmm! It was they who woke up my young master! \"This is a blind cat bumping into a dead mouse!Shopkeeper he can't believe that a doctor in a small town can be so skillful. However, it doesn't prevent him from taking credit for himself!\"That's right, our rejuvenation hall is a magic hand rejuvenation!\"\"What are you doing?\"Yu ya'er rolled his eyes.\"I...\" shopkeeper he said with a smile, \"that man is the second owner of our rejuvenation hall, uncle Hu!\"Yu ya'er sneered: \"isn't it just the same name? They are the rejuvenation Hall of the town, you are the rejuvenation Hall of the capital! There is no relationship between the two families! They have nothing to do with the Hu family! Forget what you said so soon? Ha ha ha--The second owner had a narrow escape. Where do you remember the diagnosis? Gu Jiao remembers, but she thinks the second owner has taken it.When the carriage arrived at President Li's residence, President Li had just come back from fishing. He took off the president's service and put on the fisherman's clothes. He also put on the fisherman's hat and coir raincoat. He looked just like a fisherman.Of course, if near, or can feel his extraordinary temperament and conversation.Gu Jiao and the second master got out of the carriage.\"You are...\" the president has never seen Gu Jiao, and as for the second owner, he has never seen Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao said politely, \"Xiao LIULANG is my husband. I'll visit you with my brother today. My brother is in the house.\"The dean's attitude changed immediately. He always rejected students coming to his home, but if the other party was Xiao LIULANG, the family of his future apprentice, it would be another matter.Second owner: how do I feel that the president suddenly changed his eyes to look at his daughter-in-law?President Wen said in a voice: \"how do I address you?\"Gu Jiao replied, \"my surname is Gu. The villagers call me jiaoniang.\"In fact, the villagers call her a little fool.Gu Jiao also introduced the two masters to the Dean: \"today they also came to the neighborhood and gave me a ride by the way.\"The Dean politely didn't ask the other party what to do nearby. He simply expressed his sincere thanks to the second owner who helped his students and his family, and invited them to come into the room together.\"Is this Dean the dean of Tianxiang academy?\" Entering the courtyard, the second owner asked Gu Jiao in a low voice.\"Well.\" Her husband is a student of Tianxiang college, and his Dean is not the dean of Tianxiang college. Are you just reacting now?The second boss has been nervous all morning about treating the young master. He even forgot his last name. How can he react to this?When he reacts, he thinks it's not easy.The dean's reputation in the small town may not be obvious, but in the capital it is the existence of all people flocking. He was the first of the four talented men in the capital. He grew up in the shadow of the president. Every parent wants his son to grow up to be as talented as the dean. Unfortunately, most of them only grow up to be a chicken.The dean is a nightmare for their generation.Because of this pervert, how many parents think their son is useless?The Hu family is a century old family of Xinglin, and the president is a grassroots. In terms of influence, all the children of the Hu family can't compare with President Li.He was a cabinet bachelor.It's said that I moved here with my mother.The Dean came to Qingquan town earlier than the second owner. At first, the second owner thought about whether to visit him or not, but when he thought of the shadow of his childhood, he quickly gave up.Of course, the main thing is to understand that the president will not see him.\"I heard... He doesn't accept gifts.\" Two owners of Gu Jiao road. The Dean was honest when he was an official, so he offended a lot of people. It was even more shameful to set up an academy here.Gu Jiao took out the mountain goods in the basket: \"Dean, this is LIULANG's filial piety to you!\"President quickly took over, as if afraid of who regret like: \"LIULANG has a heart.\"The second owner was confused: No, you are not polite? Dean, are you short of some mountain goods?President: I don't want to, but my body is very honest. My daughter-in-law has sent me all the teacher worship gifts!Gu Xiaoshun, with Gu Jiao's encouragement, also gave his own annual gift -- his wood carving.He loves to carve things, otherwise he would not have engraved his name on Gu Jiao's umbrella handle. The woodcarving was originally given to Gu Jiao, but Gu Jiao said it was important to give it to the Dean first, and she could carve another one later.Gu Xiaoshun thought what his elder sister said was very reasonable, so he handed over the wood carving!He carved Gu Jiao, lifelike, lifelike, no birthmark on his face, beautiful as a fairy.But... Is it really good to send your sister's statue to your Dean?The second owner is pumping straight from the corner of his mouth.Gu Jiao's mouth also drew down, she completely did not expect that Gu Xiaoshun carved this.Dean: isn't it a bit bad for him to put the statue of the student's daughter-in-law in the room?At this moment, old lady Li woke up. She saw the wood carving with a bright look in her eyes: Bodhisattva!Old lady Li took Gu Jiao's wood carving, put it on the table devoutly, and ordered two incense sticks.Gu JiaoPresident of the hospitalAll of you:Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: 50They had lunch at the dean's house before they left.When we arrived in the town, it was already late. The second owner directly sent Gu Jiao back to the village.Mrs. Li was very satisfied with the \"Bodhisattva\" sent by Gu Xiaoshun. When she left, she specially asked the dean to give Gu Xiaoshun the Buddhist beads that she had collected for many years.The Buddha beads are made of jadeite. They shine in front of the Buddha. No matter their value or significance, they are incomparable with jadeite.But Gu Xiaoshun is not good at this, he gave the Buddha beads to Gu Jiao.Of course, Gu Jiao would not be greedy for his things, but if he was asked to take them back to Gu's family, they would only embezzle them. So she accepted them first, and planned to give them back to him when he married and set up a new house in the future.\"Sister, I'm in.\" Gu Xiaoshun said.Gu Xiaoshun went into Gu's old house. Gu Jiao went on with her basket on her back and soon entered the house.Xiao LIULANG and the old lady are sitting in the main room for dinner. The old lady's face is not good. Seeing Gu Jiao coming back, she shows a very kind expression for the first time: \"Jiao Jiao is back!\"Gu Jiao nodded, so enthusiastic, but it is not necessary.Used to the old lady always smelly face ignore her, suddenly warm up, but let Gu Jiao some not used to.\"What's the matter?\" Gu Jiao looked at the food on the table, it was almost cold, but they didn't move their chopsticks.The old lady shriveled her mouth and said bitterly, \"LIULANG's cooking is terrible!\"He looks like a dog. His cooking skill is worse than Gu Xiaoshun's!!!\"Ah...\" Gu Jiao didn't know how to answer. She looked at the old lady and Xiao LIULANG. She had never tasted Xiao LIULANG's cooking skills. She didn't know whether it was good or bad.But the old lady's dislike is reasonable. How can he still dislike it?He used to cook his own food?Xiao LIULANG was serious and did not speak.Gu Jiao sighed and redone the dish. In addition, she baked some eggs to make pancakes.The old lady's eyes are green!Xiao LIULANG is very serious, but Gu Jiao thinks that maybe she has seen too much of the old lady, so when she looks at Xiao LIULANG again, she feels that there is a green light in his eyes.Xiao LIULANG doesn't talk much at the dinner table, but the old lady will say, if Xiao LIULANG doesn't let her say, she will hum that I'm your aunt!My own aunt, kneeling down, should be filial.The old lady asked about visiting the Dean: \"have you met the dean?\"\"Well, yes, he's kind. He has an old mother and a young servant at home.\" As the dean of Tianxiang academy, Gu Jiao was still in the luxury of his family. She even had a large number of servants, but nothing happened.His house is very large, but also elegant, quiet and simple.Old lady: \"just two?\"Gu Jiao: \"three, and servants.\"Gu Jiao thought with previous life, domestic servants are also people.\"No wife and children?\" Said the old lady.\"His wife passed away.\" Xiao LIULANG suddenly opened his mouth and said, \"he died when he was young, but he never married again.\"\"Poor thing.\" The old lady didn't speak any more.After dinner, Gu Jiao took out the gift from the Dean, a big box of sweet scented osmanthus flavored thousand layer crispy, two fish that the Dean fished.The old lady likes the thousand layer crisp very much, but Xiao LIULANG doesn't like the two fish very much. His eyes are disgusting.Gu Jiao killed the fish, pickled it, and then burned water to wash it. When she took off her clothes, something suddenly fell out.She picked it up and found it was a white jade finger.The quality of this jade finger is excellent. It's warm and moist in texture. It's not ordinary.\"Strange, how can I have this thing?\" She doesn't remember that the dean and Mrs. Li gave her such a big baby?She took the jade finger on the tip of her nose and smelled it. There was a faint smell of medicine.\"Is it his?\"Hot spring villa.Mrs. Hou finished her daily mountain praying and returned to the villa. She was overjoyed to hear that her son woke up. Halfway through, she asked about the specific process and situation.The steward mother said to her one by one: \"the young master's condition is not very good. Fortunately, the miraculous doctor of the rejuvenation hall rescued him successfully.\"She didn't dare to say that the young master was really angry. After all, she didn't see it with her own eyes. In addition, it also saves the little drug boy climbing the bed. He only says that the little drug boy is very clever, and he treats the little boy very well.During the conversation, they came to Gu Yan's yard.When Gu Yan woke up, he tore several antique paintings angrily. After tearing them, he collapsed. The salted fish collapsed on the bed and gasped. His appearance was terrible.But as if he could wake up Mrs. Hou, thank God. Mrs. Hou excitedly stepped forward, sat on the edge of the bed and held her son's hand: \"Yan'er, are you awake?\"Gu Yan speechless said: \"I didn't wake up, still in a coma.\"Madam Hou was choked, not angry but laughing: \"Yan'er has the strength to talk to his mother! You've been in a coma for so long. Are you scared? Fortunately, Bodhisattva blesses... \"\"What's the matter with Bodhisattvas?\" Gu Yan hummed.Mrs. Hou said with a smile, \"yes! It's Yan'er who has a great fortuneGu Yan said seriously, 'she cured me. I know it's her. She left me some medicine.\"Gu Jiao rescue him, he did not wake up, leaving medicine, he did not wake up, but he is a kind of intuition, these things are her.Mrs. Hou thought that Gu Yan was talking about \"he\". The old lady of huichuntang quickly nodded and said, \"Yan'er said that it was the doctor of huichuntang who saved you. My mother would thank them very much. Why? Yan'er, why is your jade finger missing? \"That jade finger is Gu Yan's personal thing. Although I don't know where he got it, he took it with him and never allowed anyone to touch it. Once he couldn't find it in the quilt, he lost his temper and fainted.\"She took it.\" Gu Yan said calmly.\"Who?\" This time Mrs. Hou didn't guess the old doctor. After all, how could a great doctor do such a sneaky thing?Gu Yan did not answer her, but said: 'she took it by accident.\"Although they only saw her once, he seemed to know her very well, and he couldn't tell the truth about this kind of intuition.\"It could be the little girl.\" The steward whispered in Mrs. Hou's ear, \"the old doctor brought it here. It's very young and not very sensible.\"Madam Hou sighed: \"well, they saved Yan'er. It's just a jade finger. Since Yan'er doesn't care, it's nothing for her.

    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: 51In the next few days, Gu Jiao didn't go out again. She stayed at home, learned to write with Xiao LIULANG, and accompanied Xiao LIULANG to recover.Xiao LIULANG doesn't seem to care about whether he can stand up again. Gu Jiao discovered this before the operation, and she doesn't know what he has experienced. He is as apathetic as death. She has no love and enthusiasm for life at all.Feng Lin was worried that he would have an accident during the operation, but he agreed without saying a word. This is not bravery, but it doesn't matter whether he will die or not.But Gu Jiao won't let him die or maim him.\"It's time to exercise.\" Gu Jiao cleans up the house and comes to Xiao LIULANG's house.Now she doesn't treat herself as an outsider any more. She doesn't even knock at the door when she comes in.Xiao LIULANG's face suddenly became ugly.It's not because she doesn't knock when she comes in, it's because he doesn't want to exercise.Gu Jiao guessed that he would be this side effect. She didn't give him the chance to refuse at all. She went over and pulled him up from the chair - not only entered his room casually, but also pulled him around. It was really dishonorable!Xiao LIULANG frowned slightly, but he couldn't do it with one foot. He was dragged out of the room.\"Crutches.\" Xiao LIULANG said.Gu Jiao eyebrow tip a pick: \"from today on, no crutches.\"Xiao LIULANG glanced at her and said faintly, \"I can't walk without crutches.\"Gu Jiao put her hands in front of her chest and said: \"I can't go. I'll help you. I'm your crutch!\"Don't think she didn't see it. He didn't recover well every time he pestered a crutch. He put all his weight on the crutch and didn't get any exercise on his right foot.Xiao LIULANG frowned.Gu Jiao smiles: \"if you want a crutch, go back to the house by yourself.\"Right foot does not have strength, how to return? I can only jump back.Thinking of his appearance, Xiao LIULANG gave up decisively!Xiao LIULANG uses crutches to be lazy, and Gu Jiao strangles him.He can safely press the weight on the crutch, but he can't press the weight on Gu Jiao's soft little body\u2014\u2014\"Xianggong, don't keep pressing me. You should learn to exert yourself.\"\"Yes, that's it!\"\"Do yourself a little more power! I'll be crushed by you\"How can you count on me as a woman for all this?\"Xiao LIULANG gritted his teeth: \"just borrow, borrow a force!\"It's a mess. Can you shut up?!Xiao LIULANG was forced to walk seriously. As usual, he didn't breathe for more than ten times, but now he can't do it for one time. Piansheng Gu Jiao also stipulated that the daily steps should not be less than 100.After a hundred, Xiao LIULANG was soaked through.Gu Jiao took the handkerchief to wipe his sweat: \"Xianggong, do you feel sore all over, like being run over by a big carriage? I'm so tired that I can't move, I can't lift my fingers, and my legs are shaking... \"Xiao LIULANGXiao LIULANG finally ended today's share of the devastation, and then it's his turn to devastate Gu Jiao.\"Have you practiced today?\" He asked gravely.A second ago, Gu Jiao, who was still gloating, suddenly froze.Xiao LIULANG found a little pleasure of revenge, squinted and said: \"you let me go that way every day, but you don't practice a word. Yesterday, you haven't written a hundred words.\"Gu Jiao fidgetily grabbed to grab small head!She hates writing with a brush! Especially so many Zhaoguo characters!Xiao LIULANG said, \"if you don't write today, you will have to write 200 tomorrow.\"Gu Jiao put down her pen: \"then you will walk 200 steps tomorrow!\"Xiao LIULANG: \"I will not go.\"Gu Jiao: \"then I will not write!\"Xiao LIULANG: \"whatever you want.\"Gu JiaoIt doesn't matter whether she writes or not, but he has to be rehabilitated, otherwise he will be a little lame all his life.Xiao LIULANG doesn't care whether he is lame or not. He gives Gu Jiao a light look and goes back to the house with a winning expression.In fact, Xiao LIULANG also saw that Gu Jiao did not like writing. At first, he was curious that the words on the prescription might be just a whim. When he tasted the boredom of practicing calligraphy, he withdrew.He is sure that Gu Jiao can't write.But the next day, as soon as he opened his eyes, he saw a little man sitting cross legged on his bed, holding his chest in both hands. He was like a little wild cat, angry, and staring at him with two huge black circles under his eyes.\"What are you doing?\" Xiao LIULANG looked at her in amazement. He didn't know how long she had been here. Did he just stare at him to sleep?Gu Jiao hummed coldly, then she took out a thick stack of words and threw them in front of him: \"man! This is the word you want! \"Xiao LIULANG looked at the words and her black eyes. He frowned and said, \"you can't stay up all night writing this, can you?\"How many words does it take? I'm afraid she's not crazy!Gu Jiao is like a small beast with fangs finally exposed: \"a thousand words! Today you give me a thousand steps! \"Xiao LIULANG--The day of taking care of the family has begun. Besides eating melon seeds, eating sweets and teasing Xue Ningxiang's son, the old lady's daily pleasure is to watch them torture each other, hate each other and kill each other.\"Jiaojiao, LIULANG has missed one step!\" It's no big deal for an old lady to watch the excitement.Gu Jiao rushed out of the kitchen with a kitchen knife.Looking at Gu Jiao with a kitchen knife enough to kill a cow, Xiao LIULANG looks sad!The shy little girl with her head down in the snow, waiting for him to put on her cape, is that he has lost sight after allIn the twinkling of an eye, after the 15th day of the first month, Tianxiang academy also opened.Xiao LIULANG got up early in the morning and put away his burden.After such a long time, the dormitory of the academy should be repaired. When he lives in the dormitory, he will no longer have to be forced to walk.When he packed up, Gu Jiao didn't say a word.As usual, Gu Jiao took him to Uncle Luo's carriage and handed him his crutch. When she left, she seemed to suddenly think of something and said to him with a smile: \"ah, by the way, I've been so busy recently that I almost forgot to say something. It's not convenient for you to practice walking in the college. I said hello to the Dean when I visited him last time. You don't have to live in the college these months until you... Recover. \"Xiao LIULANG: a bolt from the blue!!!Not long after Gu Jiao left, Gu Xiaoshun came.Gu Xiaoshun sat down next to Xiao LIULANG: \"brother in law, what are you doing with your baggage?\" He only carried a book bag.Xiao LIULANG is not good to say that I was put together by your sister, but asked: \"you don't live in the academy?\"Gu Xiaoshun said: \"my brother-in-law doesn't live, so do I! I'll stay with you! If anything happens on the way, you can take care of it. \"How to say, he is also the first village tyrant in all the villages. He protects his brother-in-law. It's all right!Xiao LIULANG held back his anger: \"didn't you say it earlier?\"\"I won't tell you, she said she'd give you a surprise!\" Gu Xiaoshun spread his hands and said with a smile, \"how about brother-in-law? Are you surprised? Are you surprised? \"Xiao LIULANG's teeth cackle, Gu, Jiao!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: 52On the other hand, Gu Dashun also came out of Gu's old house.Gu Dashun doesn't look good.It's a terrible new year for the family. In the past, the threshold of many people's new year's greetings had to be broken. This year, however, they all heard about yamen, fearing that their reputation would be affected, which would lead them to take care of their families this year.The villagers didn't really think much of Gu Dashun.After living in his hometown for so many years, everyone knows the virtues of Liu and Zhou. But Gu Dashun is a good young man. He urinates differently from other children in the village.He will be famous in the future, but his mother and ER Fang are involved, and people in the village feel sorry for him.But Gu Dashun didn't think so. He felt that everyone was laughing at him, and every look that fell on him was full of contempt and bad intentions.When he got on the ox cart, he saw Gu Xiaoshun talking and laughing with Xiao LIULANG.Gu Xiaoshun didn't stick to Gu Dashun before. Gu Dashun was happy, but now he has the feeling of being isolated.Xiao LIULANG and Gu Xiaoshun didn't pay attention to Gu Dashun in the whole process. Later, they went to class B together. Only when they saw the class's wooden card did Gu Dashun finally succeed.What about collusion? In the end, it's impossible to get ahead.The academy held an examination for the returned students. Gu Dashun wanted to be the first. However, he exerted himself too hard and his mind was too tight. Instead, he did not play as well as before and fell out of the top ten.Gu Xiaoshun is still at the bottom. He went to school just to make his sister happy, not to get a title. Therefore, he took the last place in the exam, and there was no pressure at all.But he didn't really learn anything. He liked carving, and Xiao LIULANG told him that the highest level of carving is not carving people and objects, but carving characters and books. If he can carve out the four books and five classics, it's really powerful.Gu Xiaoshun heard these words in his heart. From that day on, he never took a nap in class again. He was more energetic than a cockfight. He wants to remember every word taught by master. He wants to be a real sculptor!The poor student who asked for leave before the annual leave didn't miss the exam this time, so he was the third from the bottom, and Xiao LIULANG fell back to the second from the bottom.However, his good days did not end. The next day after the examination, he was called to the central hall of the president.Looking at the president who laughs so treacherously on the chair, Xiao LIULANG's eyes are full of alert.The president said with a gentle smile: \"you don't have to be nervous. I didn't ask you to come here for the exam today. Have you received the examination documents of the county exam? There will be another ten days for the county test. I promised jiaoniang that I would help you review your lessons after the start of school and try to make you a scholar. From now on, you will come to the central hall at noon to study. \"I haven't settled with you about the secret registration. You've got the idea of taking my lunch break again?!Xiao LIULANG said 10000 refusals!The dean said with a straight accent: \"jiaoniang and I said that you have been very attentive, and you study very late every day. In fact, your brain is not stupid, but I don't know why you always fail in the exam. Maybe the learning method is not right, or the learning mood is not high... Let me think of something.\"It's not allowed to live on campus, and it's called the dean to open a small kitchen. I didn't know that you two talked so much during the visit!Xiao LIULANG's handsome face is very black.\"How's it going? Let's start now. \" The president looked at Xiao LIULANG with a smile.Xiao LIULANG hissed and said carelessly, \"I won't take part in the county examination. You should die early!\"After that, he clung to his crutch and walked away without looking back.--Gu Jiao doesn't know anything about the Academy. She also thinks that the dean will open a small kitchen for Xiao LIULANG today. Xiao LIULANG has a good talent, but he doesn't put his mind into his study. Once there is a famous teacher to guide him, he will make great progress!Gu Jiao happily cleaned up the house, washed her clothes and chopped the firewood. Then she said to the old lady, \"aunt, I'll go to the temple later.\"The old lady nibbled a melon seed and said, \"what are you doing in the temple? May the Bodhisattva bless LIULANG to become a scholar? \"Huh?Gu Jiao was stunned.So there's another way?Although she believes in science, isn't there a saying that the end of science is theology?She might as well ask the Bodhisattva to bless her husband, and let him change from a scum to a bully!Well, actually, she went to buy mountains.At the end of the year, it's time for the younger martial brother who presided over the abbot to come back from all over the world.Gu Jiao: \"I have lunch...\"The old lady waved her hand: \"Xiao Xue will come and do it. Go ahead!\"The old lady doesn't like to eat hot food in the pot. Although Xue Ningxiang's cooking skill is not as good as Gu Jiao's, the old lady has to eat ready-made food.I don't know who is used to it.Gu Jiao often thinks that the old lady is an ordinary person, but occasionally the other side reveals habits that make her feel that she seems to be a personal person.Thinking too much, Gu Jiao touched her chin and carried the basket to the other side of the mountain.When she arrived at the foot of the mountain, Gu Jiao saw a luxurious carriage. She felt strange. The temple was just a small one. Why did some noble people come here all the time?Gu Jiao didn't pay attention. She walked towards the top of the mountain. When she reached the last few steps, suddenly a woman's figure fell from above.It's a mountain road. The steps are very steep. It's strange to fall down like this.What's more, Gu Jiao is right under her. Gu Jiao doesn't want to fall with her.In the flash of light, Gu Jiao takes a step sideways and grabs her.Then she looked up at Gu Jiao, who also looked at her.Four eyes opposite for a moment, two people were surprised: \"is it you?\"Gu Jiao: isn't this the lady I met in the temple last time?Lady: isn't this the girl who blocked my food box in the temple last time?Lady surprised to smile: \"girl, you saved me again.\"Gu Jiao asked faintly: \"why do you always have problems every time I see you?\"The lady chuckled.Gu Jiao saw the redness and swelling on her forehead, looked at the mud on her knees, and asked, \"did you knock it all the way up?\"\"Well.\" The lady nodded, \"I asked the Bodhisattva to protect my son. As a result, the Bodhisattva appeared. I came to fulfill my wish.\"Although Gu Jiao also wants to go to Zhu Xiang to let the Bodhisattva bless Xiao LIULANG to be a scholar in the exam, she will not do it if she is allowed to do it step by step.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: 53\"Girl, are you looking for the host this time?\" If she remembers correctly, she came to the host last time.Gu Jiao thought for a moment and nodded seriously: \"well.\"Originally intended to ask for the blessing of Bodhisattva for Xiao LIULANG, but Bodhisattva is so stingy that he has to kowtow and kneel down to show his spirit.The lady said: \"then go quickly. The host is in the temple. If you go late, he will go down the mountain again.\"It is said that a family in the town wants to adopt children from the temple.Gu Jiao looked at her as if to say, can you walk alone? Don't fall down again later, no one will save you.Lady read Gu Jiao's eyes, Wen Sheng said with a smile: \"I just should be tired, a little dizzy, now it's all right, not to mention a few steps away.\"Gu Jiao asked: \"do you often feel dizzy? More in the morning or more in the evening? Do you eat more when you are empty or when you are full? \"Madame was stunned by her series of questions, but she replied politely: \"in the morning, when I just got up, I was more than that. If I didn't eat, I would feel dizzy.\"Gu Jiao took a piece of sesame candy from her purse and said, \"eat more sugar.\"After giving the sugar to the lady, Gu Jiao went to the host.Gu Jiao came to the temple for the second time. Many young masters still remember her. Knowing that she came to buy the mountain, they took her to the Buddhist temple.It's also a coincidence that the host has just received a guest. The guest comes out of the Zen room and passes by Gu Jiao.He was a young man in his early thirties, well-dressed and well-dressed.This is the second pilgrim Gu Jiao saw in the temple.\"Is it benefactor Gu?\" The voice of kuanhe came from the Zen room.Gu Jiao gave a sound and stepped into the Zen room.To Gu Jiao's surprise, there are still several bald monks sitting in the Zen room. They are all four, five or six years old. They are tiger headed, with naughty and clean eyes.The same bald, the same clothes, Gu Jiao suddenly feel some face blind.Little monks look at Gu Jiao with wide eyes.Although Gu Jiao came to the temple for the second time, the young monks were scolded and ran away by the lady's servant girl before they could see her last time.So strictly speaking, this is the first time the two sides have met.The eyes of the little monks are full.After a long time, he covered his mouth with his little hand and whispered in a low voice.\"Wow! She has a hair on her face\"Why does she have hair on her face?\"\"Why don't we?\"\"I want to have hair, too!\"Little monks have a hair, but Gu Jiao or understand, is Huahua.So, do they think the birthmark on her face is actually a flower?\"Do you make (draw) your own hair (flowers) A little monk asked.Yes, I was born with painting, but I can't wash it off. Do you envy me? Jealous or not?Gu Jiao looks at a group of curious young monks in her spare time.The abbot cleared his throat and said to the little monks, \"go to find elder martial brother Jingchen first.\"Little monks don't want to go, but elder martial brother Jingchen's charm should be very big. After struggling for a while, little monks ran out to find him.A group of young monks one by one across the threshold, and finally the bar fell.Gu Jiao immediately recognized him. She didn't know his face, but this clumsy little figure was the wrestling ball that hit her thigh last time?Gu Jiao wants to help him again, but he gets up numbly and doesn't give Gu Jiao any chance.Gu Jiao is sorry ground shriveled shriveled mouth son.The abbot beckoned Gu Jiao to sit down.After sitting down and drinking some bitter tea, Gu Jiao thought of the young man coming out of the Zen room, so she asked the abbot, \"is that a pilgrim just now? Or do you come to buy mountains just like me? \"The abbot gave a gentle smile and said, \"he's not here to buy a mountain, he's here to adopt a child.\"Gu Jiao showed a strange look.The abbot explained, \"all the young monks in the temple are orphans. Sometimes, some kind-hearted families will come to adopt them.\"\"Oh.\" Somehow, Gu Jiao thought of that silly bubble wrestling little ball, so silly, no one should want him, right? After all, there are so many smart little monks on the side.The abbot said, \"I've talked about buying mountains with my younger martial brother. He said that if you really want to buy them, you can sell them in the temple, but the price is a little higher than before.\"\"How much was it before?\" Gu Jiao asked.\"2492.\" Presided over the exhibition.\"And now?\" Gu Jiao asked again.\"Two hundred fifty-two.\" The abbot replied.Gu Jiao's mouth: seriously doubt your younger martial brother's intention to me!The abbot sees Gu Jiao's displeasure, and thinks that the price is too high. But his younger martial brother is always in charge of the finance of the temple. He can say as much as he wants. Even the abbot has no right to interfere.The abbot said, \"if you think it's expensive, you can consider other mountains.\"Gu Jiao asked, \"is there any other mountain in your temple?\"The abbot said honestly, \"no more.\"Gu Jiao smoked again at the corner of her mouthAll the silver in Gu Jiao's hand is not enough to buy the mountain, but she treated the young master of the hot spring villa last time, and she hasn't got the money yet.The cost of that visit was not small. Only adrenaline was used. There were only a few boxes of anti heart failure drugs, all of which were left to the young man.She decided to ask the second owner for more money!When Gu Jiao went down the mountain, the lady had already left and the carriage was gone.Gu Jiao did not inquire about her whereabouts, down the mountain to the town.When she came to the rejuvenation hall, she found that there was a luxurious carriage parked at the gate of the rejuvenation hall, which could never have been seen in the town before.What's the matter today? I can always see luxury cars. This reminds her... Should she buy a carriage?Shopkeeper Wang was very polite when he saw Gu Jiao and welcomed her in: \"Miss Gu, what brings you here? Sit down first and I'll make you a pot of tea. \"Gu Jiao light way: \"drink tea to need not, I am come to take diagnostic gold.\"\"Well?\" Wang shopkeeper a Leng, \"what diagnosis gold?\"Gu Jiao looked at him and said, \"the clinic gold of hot spring villa, didn't it treat the young master of Hou mansion? What about the consultation fee? \"At the mention of this, shopkeeper Wang could hardly see his teeth with a smile: \"it's a good time for Miss Gu to come. Did you see the carriage outside the door? Hou Fu's! Last time, the second owner was too nervous and forgot to ask them for the consultation fee. I guess they came to send the consultation fee! \"It turned out to be the coach of the marquis. No wonder it is so luxurious.\"The second owner is in the accounting room. Do you want to go to him?\" Shopkeeper Wang asked with a smile.\"No, I'll go to him after the people of Hou's house have settled the bill.\" Gu Jiao said and turned to the wing room behind the lobby.No sooner had she left than the curtain of the carriage was lifted.First, a well-dressed little servant girl jumped down. Then, a young girl in green clothes and Dai Qingse curtain fence stepped down gracefully with the help of the little servant girl.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: 54The translucent soap gauze on the fence is ankle long, but it is still hard to cover her graceful posture.It's not fashionable for women in the town to wear screen fences. Only noble women in the capital are so particular about it.Her hand on the little arm of the servant girl is as delicate as jade. It's long and beautiful. I don't know how rich people can raise it.After she got out of the carriage, she went into the rejuvenation hall without stopping for a moment. However, all the people around her were shocked and couldn't come back for a long time.In this barren Town, the appearance of such a number one character is just like the fairy in the sky.\"Which family's daughter is this? Is it from the Qin family? \"\"I don't think so. Miss Qin is not so expensive!\"\"Is it the Lu family?\"\"It's not like that either.\"The two largest families in the town are the Qin family and the Lu family; There was a county magistrate sitting at home, covering the sky with his hands in Qingquan town.The daughter of their family is of course very noble. Ordinary people have no chance to see them, but they don't know why, they feel that this daughter can't be from the town.Of course, there are also those who have seen the gold of the Qin family and the Lu family. It's really the difference between them. The gold of the Qin family and the Lu family is not enough to carry shoes for each other.When such a number one person enters the gate of the rejuvenation hall, he can't help but make everyone look up at the hall. They have all been killed. Is it stupid of her to have such a noble person come to the door, or is the hall really good at it?\"Is your master here?\" The girl entered the lobby and asked the stunned shopkeeper Wang.Shopkeeper Wang is stuttering. He has lived most of his life. He has never seen such a beautiful and magnificent woman.The little servant girl frowned unhappily and exclaimed, \"what did my lady ask you? Are you there? \"Little miss?Is this the eldest sister of longfengtai, the daughter of the Marquis?Oh, my God!In his lifetime, he saw such a powerful noble man!Shopkeeper Wang quickly returned to his senses, pinched the big bean in a cold sweat and said, \"yes, yes, I'll go and ask the owner to come out.\"The girl said faintly: \"no, you go to inform me. I'll see him in person.\"\"Dare not, dare not!\"Where can he make the people of Hou's residence wait? Anyway, the second owner has nothing to do at the moment. Shopkeeper Wang simply takes the person to the study behind the lobby.Shopkeeper Wang guessed right. The girl did come to give the consultation money, but she paid a lot of money in addition to the consultation money.The girl was not there when the young master was treated. She heard many things afterwards, but she might as well know what happened.\"My brother is very satisfied with the old doctor and his little medicine boy. He will let them come next time.\" Then the girl got up and left.Houfu Qianjin came to huichuntang in person to appreciate huichuntang's skillful treatment of the young master of Houfu. It doesn't mean huichuntang is really qualified to make friends with Houfu Qianjin.The second owner is a smart man. He knows his weight and that he can't make friends at all, so he doesn't flatter in vain.He politely answered the girl's request and personally sent her to the gate.\"Second master, please go back.\" Said the girl without delay.The two masters bowed their hands and did not turn to enter the rejuvenation hall until the girl got on the carriage and left.After the carriage had gone a long way, the girl suddenly looked at her waist and her face changed slightly: \"no, my jade pendant is missing!\"\"Is it the jade pendant that the Marquis gave you? Are you still wearing them when you go out today? Why is it missing? \" The little servant girl was so anxious that she was looking everywhere, but there was no one in the carriage.The little servant girl asked: \"will it fall in the rejuvenation hall? Today, we're not going anywhere but the rejuvenation hall. \"The girl nodded thoughtfully: \"well, you go and look for it.\"The carriage turned back and stopped near the rejuvenation hall.The little maid came into the hall with her train.When shopkeeper Wang saw her coming back, he couldn't help but be stunned: \"this girl, how did you come back? Is there anything else I can tell you? \"The little maid said angrily, \"my lady's jade pendant is missing! You have to be looked forOn hearing this, shopkeeper Wang immediately became cautious: \"excuse me, what does Gu Qianjin's jade pendant look like? What kind of jade is it? \"The little servant girl said: \"it's so big, ring-shaped, lanzhiyu.\"Shopkeeper Wang immediately took the men in the lobby to look around. The little servant girl was not idle. She went to the study of the second master.She remembered that her young lady had sat there, or perhaps she had fallen there.She didn't wait for the second master to come back, so she went in and searched for a while, and got nothing.After that, she studied in the corridor and the cloister. She still didn't see the shadow of the jade pendant.When she passed by a wing room, she noticed that the door of the wing room was open. She hesitated and went in.On the table in the wing room, there is a rag basket which is out of place here. There are some mountain goods in the basket, as well as a small broken box.The little servant girl looked at the box with disgust, and suddenly found a purse beside the box.When she opened the purse, she felt that it was not right. She poured out the contents of the purse and scattered them on the table. Some bare silver seeds rolled to the ground.The little maid didn't pick it up. She was staring at the jade pendant and a jade finger that fell out with it.She murmured: \"isn't this miss's jade pendant and little childe's jade finger? Why are you here? \"Gu Jiao came to the moon. She went to Gong's room. When she entered the room, she saw a little girl looking through her purse.She walked into the room coldly, looked at the mess on the table and the ground, and asked, \"did you do it?\"The little maid looked up at Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao was dressed up as a village girl with a red birthmark on her face. There was an undisguised disdain on her little servant girl's face: \"what's wrong with me? Are these your things? \"Gu Jiao held her arms in her arms and looked at her in a quiet way. There was no trace of guilt and fear in her eyes.The little servant girl is a servant of Hou's house. Her food and clothing are no worse than those of the young lady of the rich family. When she goes out, I don't know how frightening she is. A little village girl dares to stare at her like that.The little servant girl said angrily, \"are you deaf? Didn't you hear me asking you? \"Gu Jiao: \"Oh.\"\"You...\" the little servant girl was annoyed by her attitude. She said more and more angrily, \"I stole my master's things. I don't dare to admit it, do I?\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: 55\"What happened?\" The second owner and shopkeeper Wang came and asked the second owner.The second owner just went to the opposite bank to cash the silver. As soon as he entered the lobby, he heard from shopkeeper Wang that the Hou family's daughter had lost something in the rejuvenation hall. He and shopkeeper Wang searched together. Unexpectedly, he saw this scene in the wing room.This wing room is specially prepared for Gu Jiao. Although Gu Jiao doesn't use much, no one will break into it. When the servant girl says that she has stolen my lady's things, they think it's the thief.As a result, they found that there were only two people in the wing room, the servant girl and Miss Gu.So, is the thief in the maid's mouth Miss Gu?The little servant girl didn't know Gu Jiao. Seeing that the second master and manager Wang were coming, she immediately pointed to Gu Jiao and said, \"you've come just in time! This little thief stole my lady's jade pendant! She also stole my young master's jade finger! \"Second owner Leng Leng: \"I'm afraid it's not a misunderstanding? She won't steal! \"How can a little girl steal? She was free to go in and out of his account room. She had never moved so many valuable things in the account room.And the little girl's eyes are magnanimous. If she is caught by a thief, she will not even feel guilty.But shopkeeper Wang didn't think so. Although he didn't go to the Marquis's house that day, he heard from the second boss and the old doctor afterwards that it was Miss Gu who rescued young master Gu. She had a chance to steal young master Gu's jade finger.In addition, the jade pendant was stolen and appeared on Gu Jiao's desk as soon as the daughter of Hou family came to huichuntang today. It's hard for manager Wang to think about it.The little servant girl was angry: \"what do you mean she can't steal? Do you mean I'm wronging her? She's nothing, and it's worth me coming all the way to do her wrong! \"This is not pleasant to hear, but it's not rude. The little maid is a servant of the Marquis's house, and her status is more noble than that of the ladies of many rich families. If she wants to frame up, she has to find someone who has enough status. Gu Jiao is just like a mole ant on the ground. She's crazy and won't step on her.Unless she did steal from the hous.\"Are you sure you're right? There are many things in the world that are the same. \" The second owner firmly believes that Gu Jiao is innocent.\"I admit my mistake?\" The little servant girl laughed angrily, \"do you think the ornaments used by my young lady and young master are some rotten Street things? This jade pendant is from the palace. Your whole Hu family can't afford to buy it even if they lose all their money! \"The second owner's face turned white for a moment. If it was such a precious thing, it couldn't be Gu Jiao's, but he still didn't believe that Gu Jiao would steal: \"no fake?\"I don't know if the thing in Gu's hand is fake!Shopkeeper Wang takes a worried look at the second owner. The second owner believes in Gu Jiao, which will undoubtedly offend the marquis. He doesn't want the second owner to have an accident.As he pondered his tone and intended to persuade Gu Jiao not to offend the Marquis, Gu Jiao said faintly: \"it's not fake, it's true.\"\"Listen, listen! She admitted it The little servant girl said maliciously.\"Yuru.\"A gentle and noble voice came out of the door.\"Miss! Here you are The little servant girl changed her respectful look and saluted the girl.The girl wearing the black screen fence walks in slowly with the soap gauze and skirt of the screen fence, combing the clouds and sweeping the moon.She uses the perfume powder that the expensive women in the capital can afford. The lotus steps move gently between the rooms, and the fragrance floats. The fragrance of the whole room is pleasant.\"Sneeze!\" Gu Jiao sneezed.She is allergic to this kind of perfume.The little servant girl glared at Gu Jiao angrily. When she saw that her young lady was not polite, she even dared to sneeze rudely. The village girl is the village girl, and she will never be on the stage all her life!The girl said as usual, \"this jade pendant can't be a fake. The jade it uses is Kunshan Yangzhi jade. In Zhao state, only the royal family has the right to exploit it. It is as like as two peas to make a false charge that it is not the same as to counterfeit the royal family.\"Oh.\" Gu Jiao touched her chin.\"What's your attitude?\" The little servant girl continued to stare at her, but because of the presence of Hou Fu Qian Jin, she was not so domineering as before.The girl looked at Gu Jiao and said in a warm voice, \"are you the little drug boy?\"\"Well.\" Gu Jiao should sound, did not ask her how to guess out, after all, it is not difficult to guess.The girl said without hesitation, \"I'll give you the jade pendant and give it back to me. I'll take it as if it never happened.\"\"Miss!\" The little maid stamped her feet.Shopkeeper Wang didn't expect such an amazing reversal. There are a lot of money in the Marquis's house. You can give away such valuable things without publicizing them to the outside world, which has saved the reputation of Miss Gu and huichuntang.Seeing that Gu Jiao didn't speak, the girl continued: \"the jade pendant is mine. You can take it if you like, but the jade finger belongs to my brother. I must take it back to him.\"Shopkeeper Wang is in a hurry. Please agree!Gu Jiao looked at the girl with no expression and said, \"take back the jade plate. Put it down for me.\"She had suspected that yubianzhi was the son of Houfu, but now she has verified her guess.She didn't explain that she accidentally slipped into her sleeve when rescuing the young master. First, she couldn't tell the rescue process. Second, the master and servant didn't believe it at all.If so, why should she waste her breath?The girl said: \"you can pick things. This jade finger is just of special significance to my brother. When it comes to value, it's not as valuable as that jade pendant.\"Gu Jiao said: \"the reason why I give back the jade finger is that it belongs to your brother. The jade pendant is not yours, so you should give it back to me. \"The little servant girl snorted: \"it's not my master's, is it still yours? You don't pee and look in the mirror. Can you afford such a valuable jade pendant? \"Girl: \"Yuru.\"The second owner frowned: \"girl, please be careful!\"\"You can't help it if you don't believe me.\" Gu Jiao said, holding out her hand, \"I'll say it for the last time, and give it back to me.\"The little maid stepped back: \"you dream! This is my lady's! \"The girl pinched her finger, pressed down her anger, and said to the ER Dong family: \"today, the ER Dong family also saw what happened. She admitted that she had stolen. I won't report it to the official for the sake of your Rejuvenation hall treating my brother. But I hope it doesn't happen againGu Jiao from the beginning to the end only admitted one thing: that is, the jade finger is a little childe, and did not say that it was stolen, but to the other side, it became her confession of stealing.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: 56The stalemate between the two sides lasted for a long time, and all the people in the rejuvenation hall were attracted.There are only three people in huichuntang who know Gu Jiao's medical skills: the second owner, manager Wang and the old doctor.Although Gu Jiao was often seen by others, she was only regarded as the family member of the patient.The two owners and shopkeeper Wang were very polite to her, and they only thought that her husband was a student of Tianxiang Academy.Don't look down on any scholar. They are likely to be the squires, local officials and other officials in the future.I just didn't expect her to do this.\"I can't see that an honest man is a habitual thief.\"\"Yes, I stole someone else's jade pendant and also stole someone else's jade finger.\"\"I said, today her husband didn't come, and she didn't need to apply for medicine. How can she still enter the rejuvenation hall? You're looking at the gold, aren't you? It's the one who chases in and steals! \"\"She's not afraid of hurting her husband's reputation.\"\"Isn't it? It's really bad luck for such a wicked woman at the scholar's stallAll the people present were afraid that no one believed Gu Jiao was innocent except the second owner.Isn't that obvious? She is so poor, how can she have such a good jade pendant?\"Put away the jade pendant, miss.\" The little servant girl said and bowed to hang the jade pendant on the girl's waist.Gu Jiao reaches for it.\"Bold!\" Little maid Mou light a cold, raised a hand to give Gu Jiao a slap.However, before her slap fell on Gu Jiao's face, she was beaten down by Gu Jiao's backhand.People simply don't know how Gu Jiao moves, when reaction comes over, small servant girl already lies on the ground, cheek help son swollen up.The girl was also stunned.Gu Jiao stretched out her hand, which had been injured by years of hard work, lifted the girl's curtain fence and pulled down the jade pendant hanging on her waist.During the whole process, Gu Jiao held her breath and didn't smell the fragrance on her body.Girl apricot eyes round stare at her: \"you... Wanton!\"A country girl is good at touching her!Gu Jiao didn't rush to get her purse back. Instead, she took a clean handkerchief out of her arms and wiped it up and down.The girl's breath stopped.Does this village girl... Dislike her dirty?If Gu Jiao wants to deal with people, it must be omni-directional.The girl felt that her chest was blocked, and her anger was almost out of her way.The girl bit her teeth and said angrily, \"report to me!\"\"Who wants to report to the government?\"Accompanied by a dignified and cold voice of the man, the president came sternly.It's hard to get into trouble again. The guys in the rejuvenation hall have to give way one after another.The Dean went into the room, looked at the girl who was so angry, and looked at the maid who had been lying on the ground for a long time and couldn't get up. She came to Gu Jiao as usual.His position can be seen from where he stands.He turned around and looked at the girl in a dignified way: \"is this girl going to report to the official? I don't know what happened to make the girl so angry? \"His words were polite, but his tone was not.The girl frowned and asked, \"who are you?\"\"I am the dean of Tianxiang academy,\" he saidGirl: \"Dean Li?\"President: I amPresident Li's name is very popular in the capital. Of course, young girls have never heard of it. Although President Li has become a teacher in his seclusion Town, his influence in the capital is still there.The girl was polite to him. She looked at Gu Jiao and said, 'she stole something from our family, but she won't give it back to me.\"\"I didn't steal it. The jade pendant is mine.\" Gu Jiao can no longer care about the views of girls, but she cares about the views of the dean. She is Xiao LIULANG's wife, and she doesn't want to leave a stain in the dean's heart.\"What do you say about Yu Bianzhi?\" Asked the girl.\"I accidentally fell into my sleeve pocket. I didn't find it until I got home.\" Gu Jiao is honest.The servant girl said angrily, \"that's not what you just said. You admit that you stole it!\"Look, that's why Gu Jiao doesn't want to explain to them, because they don't listen well at all.\"Show me the jade pendant.\" President Li told Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao handed him the jade pendant.President Li remembered that as like as two peas in the same way, the teacher also remembered that the teacher had sent Gu Xiaoshun a new year's gift, and he probably understood what was going on.This jade pendant was sent out by the teacher. It doesn't matter whether it was given to Gu Jiao himself or to Gu Xiaoshun, who then transferred it to Gu Jiao.The important thing is that Gu Jiao never stole.The teacher retired, do not want to let people know his whereabouts, he naturally will not move out of the teacher.With a faint smile, he said to the girl, \"the girl is wrong. This jade pendant is not yours. It was given to me by my teacher. Then I gave it to her husband.\"\"She's... My husband?\" The girl looked Gu Jiao up and down.\"Her husband is my own disciple.\" President Li unilaterally declared the apprentice's sovereignty.So, it's all explained.President Li's mentor is the old sacrificial wine of the Imperial Academy. Before he returned to seclusion, he was highly valued by his majesty. It's not surprising that he had something from the court in his hands.But the girl is still a little inconceivable. Many people in the capital want to worship president Li as a teacher, but President Li politely refuses. This little village girl is so poor that she should marry a poor boy from the countryside. How can she get into the eyes of President Li?Just when the girl was suspicious, a man from the rejuvenation hall came panting: \"found it, found it!\"\"Sneeze!\" Gu Jiao smelled the fragrance on the jade pendant, but she couldn't help sneezing.The jade pendant was found in the grass. It also has the same fragrance as the girl. Compared with Gu Jiao's jade pendant, this one is more like her.\"Is the truth clear now?\" Gu Jiao asked.\"Even if you didn't steal the jade pendant, you always steal it.\" The servant girl whispered.\"Stop it, Yuru.\" The girl stopped her, looked at Gu Jiao with a complicated look, stepped forward, bowed and said, \"I'm sorry, I misunderstood the girl.\"\"Miss!\" The servant girl was shocked!How can she be humble to a humble village girl?Even if she's wronged, what's wrong with her? Why apologize?The girl said to the servant girl, \"you also apologize to this girl.\"\"But...\"\"Sorry!\"The girl's tone suddenly became severe. The servant girl didn't dare to disobey and apologized to Gu Jiao with a black face.The girl turned to erdongjia and said, \"I hope this incident will not affect the treatment of my younger brother in the rejuvenation hall.\"The second owner looked at Gu Jiao quietly. Seeing that she had no objection, he nodded to the girl with a smile: \"what did Miss Gu say? We will not delay the treatment of patients because of private affairs. \"\"Thank you very much.\" The girl nodded and left with her black and Blue Maid.Looking at her back, Premier Li said thoughtfully, \"care for your family? Does the one in the capital care for his family? \"The second owner said with emotion: \"in addition to taking care of the family in the capital, who else can raise such a treasure?\"Who can be faultless if people are not saints? However, he can admit his mistake and repent in time, and sincerely apologize to a humble village girl, which shows that he has noble character and cherishes beauty.What Premier Li didn't say was that the name of the daughter was Gu Jinyu.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: 57Gu Jinyu left the hospital and went directly to a teahouse in the town, where Mrs. Hou had been waiting for a long time.Gu Jinyu enters the teahouse, and the swallow pours into Mrs. Hou's arms and calls her mother tenderly.Mrs. Hou held her daughter, who had been away for a long time. Her heart was melting, but she said, \"how old is the child? Still going to my mother's arms? No shame, no shame. \"Gu Jinyu hugged her more tightly and said, \"how old am I? I'm also your daughter and father's daughter. How can I be ashamed?\"How could Mrs. Hou really feel ashamed of her? She just coaxed her to say a few words to comfort her missing for such a long time.Mrs. Hou pinched the tip of her nose: \"you are so spoiled by your father!\"Gu Jinyu snorted: \"who let father have only such a precious daughter as me?\"Mrs. Hou couldn't laugh or cry, and asked her, \"just now I went to huichuntang to pay for the consultation, but it's still smooth?\"Mentioned this, Gu Jinyu's eyes dodged.Mrs. Hou was acutely aware of her daughter's abnormality: \"what's the matter? Is huichuntang dissatisfied with the clinic fees? \"It's also a big Wulong when it comes to the diagnosis. Madam Hou thinks that the servant has given it. The servant thinks that madam Hou has given it.If Mrs. Hou didn't ask, I still don't know that they have been in arrears with the clinic fees of huichuntang.It was for this reason that Hou Fu planned to go to huichuntang in person. Unexpectedly, as soon as he left the villa, he met his daughter who came from the capital. After hearing about the whole story of the incident, Gu Jinyu was duty bound to shoulder the responsibility of paying for the diagnosis, but Mrs. Hou was not idle, but went up to the mountain to offer incense to the Bodhisattva.\"It's not that huichuntang is not satisfied with the clinic money, but...\" Gu Jinyu told her everything about huichuntang, without any embellishment or concealment, but her mother taught her not to judge people by their appearance when she was young, so she didn't deliberately emphasize that the village girl was ugly, and there was a striking red birthmark on her left face.\"My daughter is wrong. She shouldn't be so arbitrary.\" She bowed her head to admit her mistake.Houfu said: \"there are always people who are more valuable than us in this world. If you are higher than her, you can look down on her. If you meet someone who is more noble than you in the future, can you look down on you?\"Although Mrs. Hou loves her daughter, she is not without principles.Gu Jinyu took Mrs. Hou's arm in a coquettish way: \"her daughter is the daughter of Hou's family. Who can look down on her daughter?\"\"You Mrs. Hou gave her a helpless look.\"But what's the matter with my brother's jade finger?\" Gu Jinyu asked.Houfu humanitarian: \"your brother said she took it by accident, you know, your brother will not lie.\"But Gu Jinyu still didn't understand: \"what does it mean to take it away carelessly? How does he know she was careless? Did he see it? \"\"This... I don't know.\" Mrs. Hou still has principles for doting on her daughter, but when she comes to her son, she doesn't count any more. After all, her son is a person who lives one day less. She is not willing to restrain him with rules.Her son didn't want to say more about that day, so she didn't ask much.It's just a jade finger. If it's gone, it's gone. I wish my son was happy.Gu Jinyu snorted: \"I took it by accident last time, but he ignored me for a whole month! I'm still not his own sister? \"\"You.\" Mrs. Hou ordered her forehead and said, \"you are not. Who is it? Is that the little girl with the jade finger? \"Because of this impossible joke, Gu Jinyu was in a better mood. Leaning against her mother's arms, she held out her little hand and said, \"mother, my hand is cold.\"Mrs. Hou touched the back of her hand. It was really cold. She was distressed. She put down the sugar in her hand and warmed her daughter up with a delicate handstove.Gu Jinyu looked at the sesame candy on the plate with a strange look: \"Niang, where did you get this kind of thing? It's not clean at first sight. Be careful to eat a bad stomach. \"Mrs. Hou thought of the little girl, and her eyes were soft: \"a kind girl gave it to me, so I took it.\"--On the other hand, Gu Jiao got her own diagnosis money, a total of 20 Liang, including the silver in her hand, enough to buy the mountain.The second owner was worried that today's event would upset Gu Jiao. He asked in a friendly way: \"that... The next month's visit...\"Gu Jiao light way: \"I promised a month to see a doctor, will not break his promise.\"After that, she took the money to the Academy.Instead of going back to the Academy, the Dean left first.When Gu Jiao arrived at the Academy, the Academy was over. The students in white uniforms came out one after another. Gu Jiao was still waiting at the entrance of the old alley, but she never saw Xiao LIULANG and Gu Xiaoshun.Just as Gu Jiao speculates whether they are left behind by their master, Xiao LIULANG and Gu Xiaoshun come from another direction.Xiao LIULANG and Gu Xiaoshun are carrying a pile of things. When they approach Gu Jiao, they find that they are some incense candles and thick paper money.Gu Jiao asked, \"what do you do with these things?\"Gu Xiaoshun was stunned: \"elder sister, did you forget? Today is the death day of the third uncle and the third auntGu Jiao is dumb.She, she really forgot.There was such an important day in the memory of the original owner. Unfortunately, Gu Jiao was not the original owner, so she forgot the day.\"Thank you for remembering.\" Gu Jiao said to Gu Xiaoshun.Gu Xiaoshun awkwardly scratched his head: \"in fact, I don't remember, it's my brother-in-law.\"Gu Jiao picks an eyebrow to see Xiao LIULANG one eye, she does not remember \"oneself\" once mentioned father and mother's death day with him, he should listen to the village people to say. It's hard for him to remember their current relationship.Gu Jiao: \"thank you very much.\"Xiao LIULANG clutching crutches, expressionless face on the ox cart, he is still angry with Gu Jiao and President Li 'secret pass Qu money\" thing, plan to one day not to talk to her!Gu Jiao doesn't know what happened to his sudden embarrassment, but he helps her remember the death day of her parents. It's definitely not because of her!Gu Jiao got on the ox cart heartlessly.Gu Jiao, who thinks that their relationship is very good, specially chooses the nearest seat to him.Xiao LIULANG himself is half angry, but someone who makes him angry has no awareness of doing something wrong, so Xiao LIULANG is even more angry.After the three returned to the village, Liu called Gu Xiaoshun away directly. Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG went to the graveyard at the other end of the ridge.Gu Sanlang and his wife Xu's grave are next to each other. Because they haven't been taken care of for a long time, the grass at the head of the grave is half a person's height.Xiao LIULANG was sulky, but he still pulled up his sleeve and pulled up the grass one by one.He pulled it carefully, but didn't notice that Gu Jiao was staring at the grave.In the memory of the original owner, Gu Sanlang was washed away by the flood, and the villagers salvaged the body along the river bank for half a month. At that time, the corpse had been too soaked to see. Xu only looked at it once and then collapsed on the spot. After that, it was no better.After only one year, she died on the death day of Gu Jiao's father, leaving her five-year-old daughter.They are excellent parents. They are many times better than Gu Jiao's parents. It's a pity that they left so early.It seems that no matter past or present, she is doomed to have no father or mother.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: 58Two people to Gu Jiao parents on the end of the grave after leaving home.It took a lot of effort for them to clean up the grave. They were all dirty, especially Xiao LIULANG. He pulled out the grass and turned his hands green.Gu Jiao knew that he loved to be clean. When she passed by the river, she said to him, \"go wash your hands.\"\"Well.\" Xiao LIULANG answered and limped towards the river with his crutch.Gu Jiao observed his walking posture. To be honest, the operation was very successful, and he worked hard to recover during this period of time, but he still couldn't get rid of his crutch.Is the strength of rehabilitation not enough?Gu Jiao touched her chin.\"Don't you wash it?\" Xiao LIULANG asked her back.Gu Jiao hehe: \"wash! Let's do it togetherIt's just a hand wash. Why are you so active? It's not a bath, right?After Xiao LIULANG asked, he remembered that this was the river she had fallen into. Maybe she was afraid that she would not come here. She thought that she was too talkative and planned to wash away. But Gu Jiao had already squatted down beside him.The river is a little cold, but neither of them is a respectable young master or a young lady. They can wash with patience.However, as soon as they got up one after another, something suddenly fell out of Gu Jiao's arms and fell into the river.\"My purse!\" Gu Jiao didn't expect such an accident. She was too quick to catch it. She had a lot of silver in her purse. It was heavy and sank in an instant.Gu Jiao didn't even think about it. She jumped into the river.Xiao LIULANG suddenly changed color!She dived more unexpectedly than her purse fell into the water. Xiao LIULANG didn't react, so she disappeared.Xiao LIULANG looked at the rippling lake and his toes moved.Of course, he used to be able to swim, but now he hurt his leg, so he didn't know how to save people.Just as Xiao LIULANG clenched his fist and stared at the surface of the water, Gu Jiao grabbed her purse and floated to the surface: \"found... I found...\"Xiao LIULANG quickly pulled her ashore.Gu Jiao knelt down on the grass, dripping water, panting.Xiao LIULANG frowned at the purse she pulled in her hand: \"it's just a purse. How much silver is worth your life?\"\"Not silver.\" Gu Jiao shakes her head, opens her purse and pours out all the things in it. She doesn't look at the silver nude. She just grabs a palm sized kraft paper bag sealed with wax.\"Do you have a kerchief?\" She looks at Xiao LIULANG.Xiao LIULANG took a clean handkerchief from his arms and gave it to her.He thought that she was going to wipe the water on her face, but she carefully wiped the kraft paper bag with a handkerchief.After drying the kraft paper package, she carefully peeled off the wax on the surface, then opened the kraft paper package, revealing a document with official seal.The document is dry and intact.Gu Jiaochang was relieved.This is the county examination document that the Dean sent to Xiao LIULANG. Xiao LIULANG didn't want to take the examination, so he turned around and threw it into the waste paper ball.Gu Jiao helped him clean up the room, found that the document, only when he was careless, so he carefully kept it.Gu Jiao handed the document to him: \"you take it well, my body is full of water, don't wet the document.\"Xiao LIULANG: \"is that what you want? I'm going to... \"I won't take the exam.It's OK to wash your hands by the river in such weather. People can't carry it if you fall into the water.Gu Jiao was shivered by the cold wind, her wet eyes were wide open, her little hand was stretched out in front of him, her sleeve was dripping with water, but she didn't wet his papers at all.The four words in the mouth around a circle, and finally did not say it, but said: \"anyway, I can not test, why do you bother?\"Gu Jiao said solemnly: \"how do you know you can't pass the exam without taking the exam? Even if I don't pass the exam this time, there will be another time? If you can't pass the exam next time, and next time, you will pass the exam one day! \"Xiao LIULANG said: \"if you can't pass the exam all the time, you'll never be promising...\"\"Who says that if you can't pass the exam, you're just hopeless? There are thousands of ways in life. Reading is only the easiest way out. If you don't like it, you can do something else. \" Think of what, Gu Jiao carefully looked at him, \"you should... Do not like to study?\"Xiao LIULANG looked at the deer's expectant eyes, as if she would be hurt if she said she didn't like it.Xiao LIULANG sighed and took the document.\"Are you stupid?\"His voice was low and light.Gu Jiao looked at him askew: \"hmm? What did you say? \"\"Nothing.\" Xiao turned his back, untied the button, took off his hospital uniform, turned around, bent over and draped it over her, \"go home.\"--Gu Jiao fell ill after falling into the water and went to xiaoliulang county to have a test. She still had a fever on that day. However, she still got up early in the morning and made breakfast for xiaoliulang with her dizzy little head. She also made dry food for the examination room.There are five county tests, one every other day. Every day, they take the test for a whole day. Eating, drinking and Lasa are all in it.The first one is called Zhengchang, which is an exam that must be taken. Only after passing the exam can we enter the second one. If you have passed all five games, you are eligible to take part in the government examination next month.After the government examination, there was also the hospital examination. After the hospital examination, it was the scholar of Zhao state.Of course, there are grades for scholars.The group of candidates with the best results are called students, and they are given food by the government every month; The second is the proliferation, which does not supply food; Finally, epiphytes.Gu Dashun is a real student, and he has been proud of his family for a long time.Gu Jiao felt that her husband didn't have to come back from the same exam as Gu Dashun. In fact, the attached student was not bad! She doesn't have high requirements. Just pass the exam. It doesn't matter if she can't pass the exam. She supports him and doesn't need his imperial examination.Gu Jiao was sitting on the ox cart, her body was shaking by the cold wind. She hung a small snot bubble, and said: \"don't be nervous, we just take the test casually, you just have to go through the stage. I've made a clear inquiry. There are five games in total. It doesn't matter if the first one doesn't play well. There are still four games in the back. I'll accompany you every day... A Xiao! ahchoo! SneezeGu Jiao finished and sneezed three times in succession, making her eyes full of stars.Xiao LIULANG gave her a deep look and didn't speak.After entering the examination room, the examiner assigned the papers to each candidate.The reason why he sits here is that someone almost lost his life for the examination paper he threw away.But that doesn't mean he will take the exam seriously.He is going to hand in a blank paper.\"Sneeze!\" Next door came the sneeze of a candidate.Xiao LIULANG's mind suddenly flashed a picture of someone sneezing wildly in the bullock cart. Her little face was flushed because of the high fever, her eyes were a little confused and lax, and her little body was tottering, but she refused to go back.Thinking of someone waiting for him on the cart all day, Xiao LIULANG picked up his pen impatiently!Xiao LIULANG won't go after a test.The news soon reached Gu Dashun's ears.Generally speaking, there are only two kinds of situations for one test: the first is that if you do too well in the test, you will become the head of the court and be recommended to the government for the test; The second is too bad to enter the next four retests.The first situation is rare. After all, no matter how well you play in the first game, there is no guarantee that no one will catch up with you in the next four games. Not to mention Xiao LIULANG, who is the last student in class B, even if he plays at all levels, he can't be the first.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: 59\"I heard that LIULANG went to the county to try.\" At dinner, Gu asked about Xiao LIULANG.Years ago, something happened to Xianggong of Xiao Qin. Although we didn't expect that Gu Jiao was intentional, we realized that Gu Jiao was really unlucky. Since Xiao LIULANG had become a relative with her, Xiao LIULANG was also unlucky.At this time, when they heard Xiao LIULANG's name, their mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were all flustered. Unfortunately, they were asked by the old man. They did not dare to speak. They just ate in the kitchen.\"Well, he only took one test.\" The answer is Gu Dashun.Gu Changhai wondered: \"why only one? Didn't you take five tests that time? \"Gu Dashun thought: \"I think I failed in the exam, right? The first test, however, is not allowed to participate in the backGu Changhai: \"is the examination fee refundable?\"Gu Dashun: \"no retreat.\"Gu Changhai took a chopstick of pickles: \"Tut, two liang silver! You can make a bubble when you throw it in the cesspit. \"Gu frowned at his eldest son. Gu Changhai counseled him and shut up.A table was filled with manure, except Gu Dashun.Don't think he doesn't know. This exam was given to Xiao LIULANG by the president. The president didn't want his good life, but he had high hopes for Xiao LIULANG's rotten wood. As a result, he could only let himself down.Gu Dashun's heart raised a sense of revenge.Ten days later, the results of the county test came out.Gu Dashun was waiting to see Xiao LIULANG's joke, but he was shocked by a bolt from the blue!I saw a few big words written on the Academy's red news - County trial desk, Xiao LIULANG!In fact, the Yamen didn't release the list so quickly. It was the dean who went to the County Yamen in person and asked about the results. After that, he didn't wait for others to release the list, but first hung up the good news himself.Hang it in the most eye-catching position to ensure that everyone passing by can see it!The Dean stood under the good news and laughed like a fool.What I know is that his students took the county examination, but what I don't know is that his own son was elected.He specially called Xiao LIULANG to zhongzhengtang: \"I knew my hard work would not be in vain.\"You are really moved by me!Xiao LIULANG gave him a blank look: \"I just hate taking so many exams.\"The dean said slowly: \"Oh, then you can hand in the blank paper!\"You don't have to go on the test to hand in the blank paper, do you? Admit it, LIULANG, you just love our president! Not willing to let the Dean down!Xiao LIULANG didn't care about him, so he turned and went out.The good news hasn't come to the village yet. Gu Jiao knows nothing about it. She has been at home for a few days. She has recovered from the cold. Now she is packing up and planning to go to the temple.\"It was a good snack last time. Bring some back.\" Before going out, the old lady stopped her.Gu Jiao thought for a long time before she remembered that the old lady said that when she went to the temple for the first time, the lady gave her a snack: \"it's not a snack in the temple. It's brought by a pilgrim. I don't know if I can meet her this time.\"I said that in my heart, but I felt that I had been there twice and met twice, and the probability was quite high.Gu Jiao put some mountain goods in the basket, and planned to exchange some snacks with her later.But until she went up the mountain, she didn't meet the lady. Instead, she saw some strange little monks.After finishing their homework, the young monks lay down behind the door one by one and poked out their heads. They didn't know who they were looking forward to.When Gu Jiao came to the top of the mountain with the basket on her back, her eyes suddenly became round!\"Here she is! Here she comesShe came with the basket on her back!Here she is! Here she is!She's coming with her hair!\"HideThe little monks retreated quickly, but there were too many small groups, one on the other. The top one couldn't get down, and the bottom one couldn't get away. At last, they could only rush out, rolling all over the ground like a little wax gourd.Gu Jiao looked at a bunch of young monks who suddenly appeared in front of herHuh?Large scale collective porcelain scene?\"Jingfan! Where have you been? \"I fell in front of the beautiful benefactor. They don't want face? Smelly elder martial brother also called their names!Little monks are going to run away when they get up!Gu Jiao suddenly said, \"what were you doing just now?\"A few people's small steps.\"We're not looking at you!\" he saidOzawa: \"yes, I didn't look at you!\"Little monk nodded three times!Gu Jiao picked pick eyebrow: \"why look at me?\"Little monk 123: \"look at you!\"Gu JiaoXiaohe Shangyi pointed to Gu Jiao's birthmark: \"your hair (flower) looks good!\"It's funny that the children in the village treat her as ugly. They either bully her or hide from her when they see her. However, these young monks who haven't gone down the mountain are deeply attracted by her birthmark more than once.Gu Jiao was successful by a few young monks, and took a few pieces of sesame candy from the basket to them.\"We can't take things from the benefactor.\" He refused.Gu Jiao thought about it and said, \"don't you monks all know how to make love? You come to me to make love. After making love, these sesame candies are yours. \"A few little monks think it's reasonable! Immediately back to the house with a small bowl to find Gu Jiao Huayuan, Gu Jiao to them.The little monks, holding small bowls, sat on the steps and began to eat.Gu Jiao counted the head of the little monk and asked, \"eh? There are four of you? Why are there only three left? \"The little monk said, \"what do you mean by clearance? He's going down the mountainIt turns out that the wrestling team is called clearance.Gu Jiao learned the cause and effect from the young monk, and then she knew that wrestling little Tuanzi had been adopted by a well meaning family. The couple of that family had been married for ten years, but they never had any children. They took the wrestling little Tuanzi back to be their own son.\"He must be very sad to leave here, isn't he?\" Gu Jiao asked.The three little monks shook their heads together.\"He's not sad. He wants to go down the mountain for a long time,\" he saidGu Jiao does not understand a way: \"why?\"The little monk said, \"he said you can eat meat when you go down the mountain!\"Gu JiaoWhat kind of misguided monk is this?Gu Jiao also said: \"then you must be very sad, right?\"The three little monks shook their heads again.The little monk said: \"in fact, he can't eat meat when he goes down the mountain. He's dizzy! He didn't know it himselfThere are still people in this world who are dizzy. I'm not a student. Don't cheat me!Gu Jiao said, \"don't you tell him?\"The little monk said, \"if you tell him, he won't leave!\"Gu Jiao pauses and says with emotion: \"you are still thinking for him.\" It's better to be adopted by a kind-hearted family than to be a monk on the mountain for a lifetime.The little monk said boldly, \"who let him eat so much? We've eaten all our food!\"Gu JiaoWhat kind of plastic monks are these?However, xiaotuanzi didn't come down the mountain because the rich family didn't come. The abbot asked people to find out that his wife was pregnant. Last night, he just had a pulse of joy.The doctor swore that he was a son.When Gu Jiao went to the Abbot's meditation room, Xiaohe was sitting on the stone at the door, with a brand-new small burden on his hand. He hung his head and didn't move. His back was a little lonely.Obviously, he knew that he had been abandoned by his adopted family, so his whole body was covered with a little sadness.Gu Jiao thought about it, walked over to him and asked, \"can I sit here for a while?\"The little monk didn't speak. He just pulled the little bundle aside.Gu Jiao sat down next to him.As a Yangou, Gu Jiao has no resistance to good-looking things. In fact, the little monks in the temple are very cute, but this one is especially cute. The head is round, the eyes are big, and the eyelashes are black and long.\"Very sad?\" Gu Jiao asked.\"What?\" Xiaojingkong answered, realized what Gu Jiao was asking, and hummed, \"I'm not sad!\"The voice is chirping.Gu Jiao pick eyebrow way: 'so say, you don't want to go down the mountain?\"Xiaojingkong put his hands in front of his chest, turned his face and said arrogantly, \"yes, what's good about going down the mountain? It's said that they will be forced to eat meat! I don't want to break the precepts! \"Oh, that's not what your little friends said.Gu Jiao teased him: \"really don't want to go down the mountain?\"Xiaojingkong said solemnly, \"of course not! I will never go down the mountain in my life! I want to be a monk all my life! I will be the abbot of the temple in the futureGu Jiao secretly gave a thumbs up and had ambition.Gu Jiao glanced at him and sighed: 'since you are so determined, forget it. I originally planned to talk to the abbot and let you stay at the foot of the mountain with me for a few days.\"Xiaojingkong said with a fork: \"I said I can't go down the mountain! Especially not going down the mountain with you! If you don't believe me, ask me again! \"Gu Jiao Leng asked: \"do you want to go down the mountain with me?\"Small clearance Shua picked up the burden: \"yes!\"Gu Jiao on the spotPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: 60Gu Jiaochang is so big that she has never been passed by like this, especially when she is still a small glutinous rice ball. Gu Jiao is not good at all.\"You just said that you would not go down the mountain with me. Monks don't lie!\"\"That's the small clearance just now. It has nothing to do with the small clearance now! Now I promise to go down the mountain with youGu Jiao: what else?Small clearance ran into the house: \"Abbot! Someone is going to adopt meGu Jiao: No, that's not what I said!\"Who is it?\" Asked the abbot kindly.Small clearance raises a hand to point: 'she!\"Gu Jiao, who had just stepped into the Zen room with one foot, said: \"I'm not sure.\"\"It's benefactor Gu, Amitabha.\" The abbot saluted Gu Jiao with one hand.Gu Jiao cleared her throat and said, \"abbot, I was...\"The abbot gave a gentle smile: \"I understand what you mean. Don't worry. I won't make you embarrassed.\"Gu Jiao breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, the abbot was very sensible.The abbot said earnestly, \"Jingkong is actually my younger martial brother's Apprentice. Generally speaking, I have to get his approval first, but I know little benefactor Gu's behavior. I am in charge of this matter for my younger martial brother.\"Gu Jiao looks confused. Wait a minute. What do you do?The abbot said to xiaojingkong, \"Jingkong, it must be good to go down the mountain. Listen to little benefactor Gu, do you know?Xiaojingkong nodded: \"Well! Yes, abbotGu Jiao: \"aren't you all so casual?Gu Jiao: \"I think you have to ask other people, such as his senior brothers...\"Pop!A chair was carried into the house.\"Jingkong, your favorite little bamboo chair is given to you by elder martial brother! Remember elder martial brother after going down the mountainDong!A top is tucked into the little clearance.\"Jingkong, your favorite top, the second elder martial brother gave it to you! Don't forget the second elder martial brotherThen, each elder martial brother sent the same parting gift. It was as fast as if Gu Jiao would repent if she slowed down.Gu Jiao said: \"little monk, how many evils have you done? Let's see how anxious your elder martial brothers areIs it too late to change it now?Gu Jiao came to buy the mountain. As a result, there was a little oil bottle behind her when she went down the mountain.The abbot grinned: \"buy one and get one free!\"Gu Jiao: I didn't feel like I earned it!--Today is Xiao LIULANG's big day.No matter whether he cares or not, he has completed the great transformation from the countdown to the county trial desk.If the top students in the class of Tian Zi Jia had taken the examination of the front desk, they would never have caused such a stir.To put it bluntly, it's still that he has taken too big a step.Xiao LIULANG was surrounded by people all day in the Academy. He heard from second uncle Luo that the people who reported the good news had gone to the village, and all the villagers must know now.Sure enough, when he went to the door, he saw that the outside and inside were full of people.Countrymen love to be lively. Whenever something happens to their family, the whole village will go to watch.Xiao LIULANG took a deep breath and was ready to be surrounded by villagers for a while. But unexpected things happened.The villagers were so blocked that he couldn't get into the house, so he had to pat the shoulder of the person in front of him: \"aunt Zhao, I'll go in.\"\"What are you doing?\" Aunt Zhao moved her shoulder in disgust.\"It's me, LIULANG.\" He said.Aunt Zhao looked back at him in a hurry: \"LIULANG is back.\"Then he continued to look into the room and ignored Xiao LIULANG!Xiao LIULANG was a little confused.Aren't you stuck here for me? What is this perfunctory attitude?Xiao LIULANG picked up a few villagers and found that they really didn't have time to take care of him. He wondered why they didn't come here for him. What were they doing at his house?When he tried his best to squeeze into the door, he was fooled by the scene in front of him.I don't know when a little monk with three heads came to his hall!The little monk sat obediently on the bench beside the old lady with a cute face!The villagers all come to the little monk. They have never seen such a little monk. He is so lovely and beautiful. It's so strange!Xiao LIULANG won the first place in the exam and was robbed by a little monk. Who can he talk to?When it was dark, the villagers left one after another. Xiao LIULANG's face was very black, especially when he saw Gu Jiao coming out with a bowl of vegetables and xiaotuanzi rushing into Gu Jiao's arms.\"Come on, what's going on?\" He looked at the old lady and Gu Jiao.The old lady said: \"don't look at me, I didn't bring it back!\"Gu Jiao pause: \"I said is to buy mountain send you letter?\"Xiao LIULANG\"Clear space, wash your hands in the backyard. The water is ready for you.\" Gu Jiao told Xiao LIULANG the whole story after she broke the little clearance. Of course, she didn't need the routine of little clearance. After all, it's a bit humiliating. She won't admit it even if she's killed. \"... he's too poor, so I'll bring him back.\"Xiao LIULANG looks at Gu Jiao suspiciously. He always thinks that she is not such a rotten and kind-hearted person: \"are you sure it's not a pit?\"Gu Jiao Mou son opens greatly: \"absolutely not! He's only a few years old. How can he pit me? I'm not that stupid! \"Xiao LIULANG expressed doubt.Gu Jiao turned the page quickly, dropped her eyes and said to her index finger: \"if you don't like it...\"Xiao LIULANG interrupted her: \"no, you just like it.\"It's not a real couple. It's her freedom to raise as many children as she likes, and he has no right to interfere.Gu Jiao goes to the kitchen to serve rice.After washing his hands, Xiao Jingkong went back to the main room. He came to Xiao LIULANG, looked him up and down, and asked seriously, \"are you my father?\"Xiao LIULANG choked: \"does she recognize you as a son?\"Xiaojingkong shook his head: \"that's not true. Jiaojiao says it's up to me. I'll ask you, \"are you going to be my father or what?\"Xiao LIULANG said indifferently, \"I'm not as old as your son.\"\"I'm not big, I'm only six years old,\" he saidXiao LIULANG said: \"is that right? But you look like you're only three years oldIt's true that there is a small clearance of two and a half years old in my lifeXiaojingkong tilted his head and thought, 'so you are going to be my brother?\"Without waiting for Xiao LIULANG to reply, Xiao Jingkong nodded thoughtfully: \"it's OK, but dumplings are delicious, but fun...\"Xiao LIULANG tiger body a shock: 'shut up!\"This is not a serious little monk!!!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: 61The woodcutter in the back mountain had no good words. The little monks had heard them several times, but they didn't remember them. Only Xiao Jingkong never forgot.After all, Jiaozi is really delicious and he really wants to play with Jiaojiao.\"Don't say that again.\" Xiao LIULANG said seriously.\"Why?\" Xiaojingkong asked with blinking eyes.Xiao LIULANG opened his mouth: \"Jiaojiao will not like it.\"After that, he looked at the kitchen without any trace.So far away, she should not have heard that voice.When Gu Jiao brought the food from the kitchen, the two men in the family had established a good relationship with each other.Xiao LIULANG pointed to Gu Jiao and said, 'she's your elder sister, your elder sister.\"You can't make up your mind.Besides, Gu Jiao already has a younger brother anyway, it doesn't matter if she has one more.Xiaojingkong has understood Gu Jiao's family relationship, and sighs like a little adult: \"xingba, although I am not her unique brother, you are not her unique man.\"He patted the small chest, said that he is also a petite little man!Xiao LIULANGLittle monk, you are very arrogant on your first day at home.In order to show that he is a responsible little man, xiaojingkong also helps Gu Jiao set up dishes and chopsticks.In fact, the young monks in the temple are more difficult than the ordinary children. They practice martial arts, have classes and work hard. So although he's small, he's still pretty good at doing things.The dinner was a dry pan of wild mushrooms, green pepper eggs, corn flour soup and cabbage steamed buns. The conditions at home had already been able to eat meat, but today I was too busy to cut meat in the town.Looking at a table full of vegetables, the little monk could not hide his disappointment: \"no meat?\"Xiao LIULANG said: \"aren't you a monk? Can a monk eat meat? \"Xiaojingkong said seriously, \"but I'm not a monk when I go down the mountain!\"Xiao LIULANG's eyes fell on his little bald head.Xiaojingkong quickly covered his small bald head with his small hand: \"I, my hair will grow out!\"Xiao LIULANG said solemnly, \"we can't afford meat.\"Small clearance ah a, looked at the furnishings at home, so humble, as if really poor appearance.\"Oh.\" He stopped eating meat, took his little hand off his head and went to pick vegetables.He is not picky of small clearance, he is very good to support Da!Gu Jiao chuckled: \"your brother-in-law teases you. I'll give you meat tomorrow.\"\"Well!\" Xiao Jingkong smiles happily, thinking of something, and stares at Xiao LIULANG with a serious face, \"bad brother-in-law!\"The amount of food in small clearance can't be underestimated. She eats more than Gu Jiao.After dinner, Gu Jiao goes to clean up the dishes and chopsticks. Xiaojingkong insists on washing her own.This is a habit formed in the temple. In order to make them independent, the elder martial brother puts on his own clothes, washes and dishes.The bath still needs help. After all, it's too small and not as high as the tub.There is no bath bucket at home, only a wooden basin, but he is so small that he will not take a bath by himself.It's strange that Gu Jiao hasn't bathed such a small child.She took the basin to the kitchen. The kitchen had just cooked. There was still firewood in the kitchen. It was warmer than the old lady's room. Besides, there was hot water in the pot. When the basin was cold, it could be added at any time.Gu Jiao goes back to the house to get clothes for Xiao Jingkong.Xiaojingkong sits on the bench waiting for Gujiao.Who knows what he is waiting for is not Gu Jiao, but Xiao LIULANG.Compared with Xiao LIULANG who dislikes himself a little bit coldly, Xiao Jingkong of course prefers Gu Jiao, who sends out endless kindness to him and will be adored by him from time to time.\"Alas.\" Little clearance sighs.I'm disappointed.Xiao LIULANGAfter the bath, it's time for xiaojingkong to go to bed.There are three rooms in the house, and there is no extra room for him. Gu Jiao thinks that other people are small, so it's not a problem to squeeze with others.It's the warmest in an old lady's room, so it's the first choice.\"Go and sleep with your aunt.\" Gu Jiao gave him a small pillow.Xiaojingkong came to the old lady's house with a pillow in his arms. Instead of rushing in, he stood at the door, looked at it seriously and said, \"if you agree to share half of the preserved fruit with me, I'll sleep with you.\"Without saying a word, the old lady slammed the door!Xiaojingkong returned to Gu Jiao's room with a pillow in her arms: \"my aunt won't sleep with me.\"Thinking of the old lady's strange temper and the loud slamming of the door, Gu Jiao pulled the quilt and said, \"then you can sleep with me.\"\"Good!\" Xiaojingkong smiles, puts the pillow on it, and climbs up with his short legs. Just halfway up, he is promoted by Xiao LIULANG.Xiao LIULANG: \"you sleep with me.\"Small clearance: \"I don't want to sleep with you.\"Xiao LIULANG: \"no, you want to.\"Xiao LIULANG carried Xiao Jingkong back to the house.Xiao LIULANG's bed is not as big as Gu Jiao's, but it's not too small. It's more than one big and one small. He's lying on one side with a small clearance. He's like a bull's-eye in the middle of the bed.Xiao LIULANG put down his crutch and frowned: 'sleep well.\"Little clearance rolled around on the bed: \"No.\"Xiao LIULANG said coldly, \"if you do this again, I will throw you down and not give you sleep.\"Xiaojingkong is about to speak.Xiao LIULANG said, \"the door is also locked. I won't let you pass.\"The back road was blocked and the little clearance was silent.Xiao LIULANG brow tip a pick, way: \"you'd better be honest, perhaps I will consider let you squeeze a squeeze.\"Xiaojingkong was stunned for a while, got up and said: \"I should tell you this. Jiaojiao said it. I'm also a member of this family! So I should let you squeeze with me! \"Xiao LIULANG can understand the preceding words, but what is the meaning of the last two sentences?He said, \"what do you mean, let me squeeze?\"Xiaojingkong looked at him with his waist crossed: \"because I am also a member of my family, so the house in my family has my share! You and Jiao Jiao are married. You should sleep in one room. That room is yours! This is mine! Jiao Jiao doesn't sleep with you. Now I'm taking you in! \"Irrefutable Xiao LIULANGWhat's all this nonsense?Also, can you throw the little smelly monk out?A child is the one who can't use common sense to judge. One second ago, he was still in the small clearance with Xiao LIULANG. He turned his head and fell on the soft pillow, and his mouth was watering.Xiao LIULANG likes to be quiet, and he will not adapt to the little things that are playing all night, but he doesn't really throw people out.He took the little headroom off the pillow and tucked it into the quilt to lie down.Xiao LIULANG looked at the little guy who stole the limelight. Because of his arrival, everyone forgot that he was the first in the county test.Although he didn't want to be the first in the exam, he felt a little uncomfortable, just like he was missing something.Crunching\u2014\u2014The door was gently pushed open a seam, Gu Jiao close to the crack in the door asked softly: 'sleep?\"\"No Xiao LIULANG said, and after a pause, he looked at Xiao Jingkong, who was asleep. \"He's asleep.\"\"Then I'll come in.\" Gu Jiao walked in lightly, holding an oil lamp in her hand. \"I think you're running out of oil lamp. I'll use mine tonight.\"\"Well.\" Xiao LIULANG sat on the edge of the bed and answered faintly.Gu Jiao put the oil lamp on his desk: \"that... I still don't congratulate you on the first place in the county test.\"Xiao LIULANG raised his eyelids slightly.\"Here you are.\" Gu Jiao handed him something.\"What?\" Asked Xiao LIULANG.Gu Jiao smile: \"you progress so much, this is a reward for you.\"Xiao LIULANG turned his face: \"I'm not a child, what reward do you want?\"Having said that, he reached for it. It's a sachet made by Gu Jiao herself. There are dry flowers to help sleep in it. She made them herself.Gu Jiao said in a soft voice, \"take the sachet with you, and you can have a good sleep.\"\"You...\" Xiao LIULANG wanted to ask her how she knew he didn't sleep well.Gu Jiao guessed what he wanted to ask and said with a smile, \"you forget, we've slept.\"Xiao LIULANG's eyebrows moved, but he was still calm.Gu Jiao plans to go back to the house. She just takes a step and suddenly turns back. She leans over his ear and breathes: \"you just... Did you call me Jiao Jiao?\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: 62They were so close that her breath fell on his ears. He could clearly feel the burning of his ear tips.\"No He denied that he did not turn to see her.Gu Jiao has been looking at him, his ears and cheeks are hot, black hair under the long and slightly reddish neck, extremely young green and beautiful.\"I don't care. I hear you.\"After that, Gu Jiao went out contentedly.It's getting more and more familiar to tease the little prime minister!Xiao LIULANG looks at the sachet in his hand. He doesn't know when his discomfort has been dispelled. He holds the sachet and has a sound sleep.When he got up, he caught a glimpse of a little foot across his chest.Small clearance, sleep extremely arrogant.Xiao LIULANG takes away his little feet and is silent for a while. He takes out Gu Jiao's sachet and puts it in the most prominent position on the pillow. Then he goes to light the lamp and copy books.Xiaojingkong woke up and saw the sachet on the pillow. He rubbed his big eyes and asked, \"hmm? What's this? \"Xiao LIULANG, while copying, said quietly: 'sachet.\"Xiaojingkong had never seen the sachet, and looked over and over: \"who made it? How beautiful\"Your sister made it.\" Xiao LIULANG said.\"Is it for me?\" Xiaojingkong grabs the sachet, gets up and jumps excitedly on the bed.Xiao LIULANG looked at him without changing his face: \"you think too much, it's for me.\"\"...\" the little clearance suddenly stopped.Xiaojingkong didn't believe it, so he took a sachet to find Gu Jiao, who made breakfast in the kitchen.What Gu Jiao can say, of course, is to admit.Small clearance wronged Baba.He is not a greedy child, just a child's nature, so he did not understand why the bad brother-in-law has, and he did not!That wronged small appearance, and Gu jiaomeng to.Gu Jiao has never raised a child. She doesn't think that this may cause a psychological gap for him. The main reason is that she doesn't know that Xiao LIULANG is so naive and shows off to xiaojingkong with a sachetGu Jiao explains the origin and development of sachet to Xiao Jingkong. Xiao Jingkong is a very sensible child. She is no longer sad when she knows the meaning of sachet.He bravely went back to the house and returned the sachet to Xiao LIULANG.Xiao LIULANG squinted at him: \"not angry?\"Xiaojingkong raised his chin and looked at him piteously: \"you are so poor! The first time you take the exam, you will be rewarded! I'm always the first in the temple exam. I'm used to it. I don't need any reward! \"Xiao LIULANGToday is another day to throw the little smelly monk out.After a while, Gu Xiaoshun came home for breakfast and met the new member xiaojingkong.Xiaojingkong realized that there were not only two men in the family. Gu Xiaoshun was also a man in the family, but he didn't live at home.Compared with Xiao LIULANG, who can always dig holes for xiaojingkong, Gu Xiaoshun's fighting power seems not enough to arouse xiaojingkong's vigilance. Xiaojingkong happily becomes a good brother with him!After they went to school, Gu Jiao was ready to go to town.After the old lady came here, she asked Xue Ningxiang to make her winter clothes. At that time, Xue Ningxiang was not busy, but after spring, Xue Ningxiang was busy with farming and had no time to do needlework. Gu Jiao planned to buy some ready-made clothes for the old lady in the town.Xiaojingkong also needs to buy clothes. He was abandoned in the temple when he was half a year old, and he never went down the mountain again. His burden is full of monk's clothes.When I heard that Gu Jiao was going to town, xiaojingkong immediately put green light on her eyes: \"can I go? Can I go? \"If only to buy clothes, Gu Jiao of course will take him, but Gu Jiao has other things.Gu Jiaoer said to his little bald head, \"I'll take you next time.\"Gu Jiao can see that xiaojingkong still wants to go, but he doesn't have a bad temper and stays.This kid, it's a relief.Gu Jiao went to town with a basket on her back.She doesn't go to practice medicine. She just has the habit of taking the small medicine box with her. After all, the secret of the small medicine box is too big for her to worry about; Second, I may need to use the medicine for a while.Gu Jiao went to the street full of gambling houses, brothels and martial arts.An hour later, Gu Jiao rubbed the wrist of her right hand and came out with a clear mind.After sweating a lot, she took off her cotton padded jacket and only wore a thin jacket.\"I haven't been here for a few days. I've had a lot of babies.\"As she sighed, she turned around and planned to go to the shop in Zhendong to buy clothes for the old lady and xiaojingkong. However, without taking two steps, she noticed something wrong.Someone's following her!Gu Jiao coolly raised the corner of the lip, not surprisingly let a person stare at.It's OK. I haven't played enough. Let's practice a few more.As she was about to leave the lane, Gu Jiao stopped slowly.The group after him also stopped and looked at her with vigilance.Gu Jiao turned around slowly and looked at the crowd indifferently: \"you eight, let's go together!\"The strong man at the head squinted coldly: \"what a big tone! Girl, do you know who we are? \"Gu Jiao looked at him wantonly: \"I don't care who you are. If you want to fight, fight or roll.\"The strong man at the head sniffed: \"girl, Heishui lane is not the place you should come to. I'll give you a chance to beg for mercy. As long as you break your right arm and promise not to disturb our business, I'll give you a small life!\"Gu Jiao's patience is not for these people. She has said all that should be said, and he's still gabbling, which is very annoying!Gu Jiao quickly ran to the other side, one foot on the wall, the other foot a roundabout kick on the head of the strong man's face. The strong man at the head didn't even have time to respond, so the whole man was kicked out!\"Big brother!\"They are all stupid.Gu Jiao won't give them a chance to react. She stabbed them three times in the twinkling of an eye.That's half the way.The remaining four pounce on Gu Jiao. Gu Jiao grabs the first two and slams them on the latter two.Four people are hit vomit blood, cover chest, simply doubt this is not true!Gu Jiao clapped her hands and turned to leave. However, a dark shadow passed over her head.also?And a master of lightness?This is too much of her!Gu Jiao grabs a stick from the ground, steps up the wall and smashes the man in black!The man in black was stunned when he fell.Girl? You have a grudge against me?Gu Jiao: \"Oh, it's no use pretending to be stupid.\"Man in Black: No, I don't know you!Gu Jiao was dizzy with a stick!Man in blackGu Jiao beat this found that there is a nearby, but that person is very alert, in Gu Jiao aware of the moment hidden into the crowd.\"Come on! There's the assassinWith a fierce drink outside the alley, several powerful bodyguards of Kong Wu rushed over.They looked at the unconscious assassin and the local ruffian, and they didn't understand what had just happened? Is the assassin in conflict with the local ruffians in the town, and they are both defeated?But the assassin is also a master. How can he not even fight a few ruffians?\"Girl, didn't you hurt?\" A bodyguard asked Gu Jiao.\"No Gu Jiao shakes her head. She feels that the clothes of the bodyguards are familiar. She seems to have seen them somewhere.Just thinking about it, a carriage stopped at the end of the lane.The curtain of the carriage was slowly lifted by a pale jade hand, and a weak young handsome face appeared.Gu Jiao's eyes are bright. What's wrong with her?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: 63Gu Yan saw Gu Jiao's eyes and knew that she still remembered herself. There was a happy smile on his world weary Xiaojun's face.Gu Jiao saw that he was smiling, and her mood became better. She was about to say hello to him when she saw his jade like index finger on her lips.Gu Jiao instant understanding, drooping eyes as nothing to see.Although these bodyguards were also from the hot spring villa, they didn't see Gu Jiao, so they didn't recognize Gu Jiao's identity. However, seeing that Gu Jiao was ok, they continued to look for her.Sure people go far, Gu Jiaocai came to the carriage.It's a folk carriage. It's very simple. No wonder it can hide the truth from the world. The guards didn't expect that the noble young master of the Marquis would commit himself to such a carriage.The coachman is also from the town. He has given enough money to keep his mouth shut.Gu Jiao opened the curtain, looked at the delicate young man, and asked, \"Why are you here? And you've left all your bodyguards behind? \"\"I've come to you.\" Gu Yan said honestly.\"To me? Are you sick? \" Gu Jiao subconsciously put her hand into the window to feel his pulse. As soon as she grasped his wrist, she remembered that she was just a little drug boy in Hou's house.She drew back her hand quietly.On Gu Yan's pale face, a light smile appeared: \"I know it's you.\"Ah, how do you know that?Where did you show your feet?Gu Jiao grabs her head.Gu Yan was amused by her small appearance: \"others don't know, you come up.\"Her secret is more and more difficult to hold. First, her grandfather, then her second boss and the old doctor, and now she is the young master of the Hou family.Gu Jiao still decided to gouyigou: \"it's not the disease I treated for you. It's Dr. Li of rejuvenation hall. I'm just his little medicine boy!\"Gu Yan said with a smile, \"OK, little drug boy, are you coming up? If they don't come up again, they'll find me. \"Gu Jiao thought about it and finally got on the bus.She sat down beside Gu Yan.Gu Jiao is too shabby to sit in this carriage. It's really hard for the young master of the Marquis's mansion.Gu Yan didn't feel aggrieved at all. As long as he could see her, he could do anything.Gu Yan grinned and stretched out his thin white wrist: \"little medicine boy, do you want to give me a pulse?\"Gu Jiao face unchanged: \"not necessarily accurate.\"Gu Yan nodded with a smile: \"well.\"Gu Jiao gave him his pulse, which was much more stable than last time.Then she opened the small medicine box and took out the stethoscope.\"What is this?\" Gu Yan asked curiously.\"Stethoscope, undress.\" Gu said coldly.Gu Yan was stunnedGu Jiao unbuttoned his clothes and put the stethoscope in.There are still arrhythmias and murmurs. Anti heart failure drugs are effective for him, but they are not so effective.\"It's hard, isn't it?\" Gu Jiao took back the stethoscope.Gu Yan lowered his head and closed his coat with his slender and pale fingertips: \"no, it's really better than before.\"He has been suffering from heart disease for so many years, and has never felt the comfort of normal people. As long as he is less uncomfortable, it will be good for him.\"You've been wronged by the finger pulling.\" Gu Yan suddenly opens his mouth.Gu Jiao Leng for a moment, he did not mention her to forget, in fact, nothing, unimportant people, misunderstood her: \"I took your finger first, I should apologize to you.\"Gu Yan hated her estrangement with herself: \"I don't want your apology.\"Gu Jiao light smile, did not continue this topic: \"why should shake off bodyguard?\"\"They're bored.\" Gu Yan said.Gu Jiao opened the curtain and looked at the man in black on the ground: \"but you will meet an assassin.\"Gu Yan said with a smile: \"he is not an assassin, but my dark guard. He led them away.\"Gu Jiao blinked innocently: \"then he is really unlucky. He was hurt by some ruffians.\"Not far away another dark Wei a mouth old blood vomited out, girl, open your eyes to say lies really good?\"Well.\" Gu Yan chuckles, \"I've been hurt by ruffians. I don't care about him. Let him live and die.\"Not necessarily.Gu Jiao cleared his throat: \"you have more than one dark guard, right?\"Gu Yan continued to smile: \"there are two.\"It seems that the one who ran away was his dark guard. That's right. Fortunately, he didn't catch up with him, otherwise he would be in trouble.Gu Jiao's face is full of embarrassment.\"What's your name?\" Gu Yan asked.\"Gu Jiao.\" Gu Jiao said.Gu Yan was surprised: \"your surname is Gu, too. My name is Gu Yan. We were one family five hundred years ago.\"Gu Jiaole, you're the son of the Marquis's family. You've fallen into a relationship with a village girl. Aren't you afraid of beating you when the Marquis knows?\"Are you hungry?\" Gu Yan asked.Gu Jiao got up early and walked all the way. Now she was really hungry.The west of the town is not as prosperous as the east of the town. There is no restaurant on the top of the table. It took a long time to find a small restaurant that is still alive.\"Have you ever been to a place like this?\" Gu Jiao got out of the carriage and asked.\"No Gu Yan said honestly.As a little sick seedling who can't wait to fall when the wind blows, the Hou family has brought him up in the palm of their hands. How can they allow him to come here?Of course, he didn't have much interest either. First, he didn't have the strength to toss. Second, he was tired of the world and didn't bother to toss.Now it's different.He didn't feel that bad, and he wanted to see her.They find a quiet corner to sit down. Gu Yan's appearance, temperament and clothes are destined to attract many eyes. He hates being watched, but if he is with her, he doesn't mind.Xiao Er has never seen such a noble young master before. He even forgot to call.Gu Yan ordered a good table.Gu Jiao frowned: \"can you eat it?\"It's also rock sugar elbow, it's braised lion's head, and it's steamed with preserved meat. He's sick, so he has to avoid it!Gu Yan looked at her: \"you help me eat.\"Gu JiaoGu Jiao wanted to be reserved, but he ordered all her favorite dishes.In fact, Gu Yan always wanted to eat, but the imperial doctor didn't let him.Finally, Gu Jiao is eating big fish and meat, and Gu Yan can only drink porridge on one side.However, watching her eat, as if she had eaten, that kind of satisfaction is unprecedented.After dinner, Gu Yan goes to check out, and Gu Jiao looks at the small medicine box again.Sure enough, there are anti heart failure drugs.Gu Jiao's original packaging was removed and put in several different small porcelain bottles as last time. The usage and dosage of the bottles were written in cinnabar.When Gu Yan came over, Gu Jiaogang handed him the medicine: \"are you finished soon?\"Gu Yan looked at the medicine in her hand and fell into a deep meditation for a moment.\"Gu Jiao continued:\" Doctor Li gave it to me! \"Gu Yan: \"Oh.\"Gu Jiao then said: \"it's OK to take medicine on time and go out to relax, but don't let go of the bodyguard, especially your dark guard's ability is not good enough. You can beat him down with a stick...\" Gu Jiao said solemnly, and suddenly caught a glimpse of him looking at himself with a smile. He said solemnly, \"I didn't fight, I didn't! I don't hit people! \"\u2014\u2014There is no silver here.Gu Yan's smile turned into a Muggle.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: 64Gu Yan didn't stay in the small restaurant for long, because the guard of Hou's house came to him.Gu Yan didn't let them disturb Gu Jiao. He said goodbye to Gu Jiao quietly.Looking at his back, thinking of his modesty and politeness, Gu Jiao's heart was lost. Why did the Lord torture him?As soon as he got into the coach of Hou's house, a modest and polite little girl had no sense of smile, no sense of hostility, cold eyes, and was very different from Gu Jiao.The man in black, who was stun by Gu Jiao, had already returned to Gu Yan with his companion. They tried to reduce their sense of existence, but they did not dare to give it out.They have seen the shameless little childe. Can they pretend like this? If you have the ability, you can be a little darling in front of Mrs. Hou and Mr. Hou!Who the hell is that annoying guy who's so angry all day long???Strictly speaking, today they are dereliction of duty, but the young master doesn't even have a sentence of punishment. It can be seen that he is really in a good mood. In this case, can you tell him the news?\"Not yet. What's the matter?\" Gu Yan asked in disgust.They exchanged a look, and finally the man in black, who had been stifled, opened his mouth: \"the Marquis is on his way here.\"Gu Yan's aura suddenly cooled down.After a while, he held out his hand: \"painting.\"They each handed over an antique painting collected by the marquis.Gu Yan grabs it and tears it off!On the other hand, Gu Jiao also plans to leave.Today's food is very delicious. Gu Jiao bought a rock sugar elbow and a bowl of braised lion's head, and paid a deposit of 50 Wen. She went to the store to take two cans and packed them, intending to take them back to her family.But just as she walked out of the restaurant with the jar in her arms, a steed galloped by. The driver waved a whip in his hand and drove the crowd in the street.In order to avoid his whip, one of them bumped into Gu Jiao's jar.Gu Jiao's jar fell to the ground, smashed to pieces with a bang, spilled soup and elbow balls all over the ground, and was soon trampled by another aunt in a panic.\"Ouch --\"Aunt son foot slip, nearly fell, Gu Jiao stretched out her hand to pull her, will she pulled to one side.After the old lady responded to what happened, she quickly apologized to Gu Jiao: 'sorry, girl, i... I didn't mean to...\"She is not to blame for this, but the man who runs the horse in the street.The man turned a deaf ear to the confusion he caused, and didn't even give Gu Jiao a look. Gu Jiao's eyes narrowed. When he waved the whip again and passed him by, Gu Jiao grabbed his whip.Then, without giving the other party room to discuss, he dragged the man down from the carriage.The man fell heavily on the ground, and the horse ran away and disappeared!He's a trainer. This fall didn't hurt much. He just suffered a slight injury. However, he was very angry, who was so bold that he was pulled off the horse in the street!He dashed toward Gu Jiao, who held the whip in her hand and beat him with a whip, which made him fly out.He ran into the carriage behind him.The carriage swung suddenly. The girl in the car didn't hold her head firmly. She knocked her head on the wall of the car and uttered a painful exclamation: \"ah --\"At this time, the carriage was forced to stop, and the man who was whipped by Gu Jiao got up from the ground in fear, knelt on one side of the carriage, arched his hands and said: \"I'm guilty! Please punish meGu Jiao frowned strangely. What's the matter with you?In the carriage, marquis Gu helped his daughter who hit her head and asked anxiously, \"how are you, Jinyu? Can I help you? \"Gu Jinyu's forehead is red. In fact, it's not even a small injury. Gu Jiao's hand is stretched out. Any new wound or old scar is much more serious than this. But who let Gu Jinyu grow up in a spoiled way?She didn't suffer at all. She didn't suffer at all.Gu Jinyu covered his forehead and looked at Marquis Gu wrongly. His tears rolled in his eyes: \"it hurts.\"\"Let Dad see.\" Marquis Gu took Gu Jinyu's hand. When he saw her red forehead, he was furious.He opened the curtain and looked coldly at the guard kneeling on the ground: \"what's the matter?\"The bodyguard pointed at Gu Jiao and said, \"my subordinates are in front of me. Unexpectedly, she grabbed my subordinates' whip and pulled them down from the horse. She whipped my subordinates with the whip. Then my subordinates ran into the Marquis's carriage.\"When the people around heard the Marquis's words, they were all so scared that their legs softened. Hula, they knelt on the ground. Gu Jiao was the only one standing there stubbornly.Gu Hou Ye's eyes fell coldly on Gu Jiao's face.It was a face that people didn't want to see for a second time. Her eyebrows and eyes were cold and her blood red birthmark made her complexion white and uninhibited.Her eyes were cold and sharp, and she didn't dodge the sight of Lord Gu.She dressed like a villager in the countryside. She was about the same age as Jinyu, but she had such terrible eyes.Marquis Gu said coldly, \"you are not a coward!\"Whether it's beating his bodyguard in the street or not kneeling for him, it's too bold!Gu Jiao did not flinch because of his scolding. She came forward with a whip.The bodyguard Shua stood up and pulled out his sword to stop her.Without raising her eyelids, Gu Jiao whipped his sword back to its scabbard!Everyone was shocked!Marquis Gu was also stunned.Gu Jiao came to the carriage, and the rest swarmed around her. She still looked the same.She held out her hand to Marquis Gu.Marquis Gu frowned: \"what to do?\"Gu Jiao light way: \"can 50 Wen, rock sugar elbow 60 Wen, braised lion head 40 Wen, and I want to let the shop do a new, 100 Wen delay cost, a total of 250.\"Marquis GuI feel scolded.Marquis Gu looked at the mess on the ground and looked at the bodyguard who caused the trouble. The guard humbly lowered his head, and Marquis Gu understood everything.Marquis Gu snorted coldly: \"my people are wrong, but are you too arrogant, little girl? Are you not afraid that I will punish you to death? \"Gu Jiao looked at him as if she was seriously thinking about his words. In a moment, she said, \"249 Wen.\"\"...\" Marquis Gu is so lost. What is it all about?Gu Jinyu recognized Gu Jiao. She pulled the sleeve of marquis Gu and shook her head at him.Lord Gu frowned and said to Gu Jiao, \"my daughter pleads for you, and I'll forgive you!\"After that, throw a silver spindle to Gu Jiao, put down the curtain and let the coachman drive away.Gu Jiao said 249 Wen, only 249 Wen, he gave more.Gu Jiao broke off a small piece of the silver spindle and threw the rest back to his carriage.The silver spindle hit Marquis Gu's head impartially, and immediately hit a big bag!Marquis Gu:Marquis Gu:! \"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: 65Marquis Gu was furious, and his strong and handsome face was full of blue veins. Just when he was going to let someone catch the girl to cure her, a guard of marquis mansion came with a horse: \"tell Marquis that something has happened to the young man!\"Marquis Gu can't take care of the trouble of looking for Gu Jiao. He quickly let the bodyguard lead the way and went to the place where his son had an accident.Gu Yan's carriage overturned on the way. Although the dark guard stabilized the carriage in time and didn't let it fall to the ground, it still tilted seriously and Gu Yan fell.Gu Yan's body is weaker than that of a child. People in the house never dare to let him knock. Marquis Gu was half nervous all the way. However, when he saw Gu Yan, he found that Gu Yan was all right.Gu Yan sat on the small Wu, stretching a pair of slender legs, leisurely basking in the sun.\"Brother!\" Gu Jinyu got out of the carriage with his train, came to Gu Yan, squatted down, took his hand and said, \"are you ok?\"Marquis Gu came forward with a strange look and gave his son a steady look: \"is there anything wrong?\"Gu Yan answered faintly: \"I can't die.\"In his letter, marquis Gu learned that his son was much better. He once doubted something, but now he found it was true.It was impossible in the past for the carriage to turn over and people to be OK.Marquis Gu put his heart down for a while and let his son sit in his carriage.Father and son had a bad relationship. When they got on the bus, neither of them spoke. Only Gu Jinyu said a few words from time to time to break the awkward atmosphere in the car.On the forehead of marquis Gu, there was a big bag of silver, and Gu Yan looked at his big bag.Gu Jinyu thought that his younger brother was worried about his father. He quickly explained, \"younger brother, you don't know who we just met. It's the little drug boy who took your jade finger... Her father gave her silver, but she didn't want it. Look what she smashed him.\"\"She did it?\" Gu Yanfeng's eyes glared.\"Well.\" Gu Jinyu nodded.Gu Yan suddenly became happy.He made no secret of his schadenfreude.Marquis Gu was so angry that he wanted to beat people. If it wasn't his own, he would have killed him!In the outside was a wild girl angry half dead, came back and let his son angry half dead, he did not understand, this is why? All agreed?The carriage soon arrived at the hot spring villa.Everyone in Chuang Tzu knew that the Marquis was coming, and they all looked happy, as if they were going to celebrate the new year.It's not surprising that they are so excited. It's the Marquis who works in Beijing and seldom comes to the villa. Only Mrs. Hou accompanies the young master to live here all the year round. As for the young lady, she runs from both ends. She lives in the villa for a period of time and in the capital for a period of time.The kitchen arranged a table of good dishes for Marquis Gu, and the four members of the family seldom got together for a meal.After dinner, Gu Jinyu took his younger brother back to their respective rooms, leaving only Mr. Gu in Mrs. Yao's room.When the children were in front of them, their love was as good as ever. But as soon as the two children left, Yao's smile faded away for a few minutes: \"it's late. It's time for the Marquis to have a rest. I'll ask someone to prepare the room.\"Marquis Gu took her hand and whispered softly, 'still angry with me?\"Yao turned his face: \"how dare I be angry with the Marquis? Don't be joking, LordMarquis Gu gave her a pet look and said with shame, \"it's my fault. I shouldn't have been absent for so long, but I really can't leave. You know the situation in the capital. The princes are old, and your majesty is in his prime... \"Yao interrupted: \"I don't want to talk to a little woman about what happened in the court. I don't know about it. What's the matter with your sudden visit to the villa this time? \"Marquis Gu wants to talk but stops.Of course he has something.However, he was not sure whether to tell her so early.Marquis Gu said quietly, \"I found a famous doctor in the capital and brought him to treat Yan'er.\"Yao said, \"Yan'er's condition is much better.\"Marquis Gu said: \"I know that Jinyu has already told me that the doctors in huichuntang are very good at medicine, and Yan'er's health is greatly improved. However, they are not sure that they can cure Yan'er, are they? There is always more hope for more doctors. \"On this point, Yao agreed with Marquis Gu.Marquis Gu hugged his wife from behind and said softly in her ear, \"I'll come later and leave the door for me.\"Yao's eyes should be a good voice, then played the curtain into the inner room.Marquis Gu looked at his wife's estranged figure and sighed helplessly.Marquis Gu went to his study and called doctor Zhuge, who had been waiting for a long time, to Gu Yan's house.Gu Yan had gone to bed, but Marquis Gu didn't wake him up. After holding back everyone, he left Dr. Zhuge in the room.The reason why Marquis Gu was so cautious was that the identity of doctor Zhuge was special. He could not be found out that he had left the capital, let alone that he had contacts with Marquis Ding'an.Marquis Gu looked coldly at doctor Zhuge: \"your apprentice treated my son. After that, he said some treacherous words to me. I hope you understand that I am not a fool! Never try to fool me\"The little ones don't dare.\" Dr. Zhuge said in a neutral voice.Marquis Gu gave him a deep look, let him come to the bedside, and took a drop of blood from Gu Yan's fingertip with a silver needle.After that, they went to Gu Jinyu's room.Marquis Gu said, \"Jinyu, the doctor wants to take a drop of your finger blood.\"\"Oh, is it still for my brother this time?\" As early as a few months ago, a doctor came to the villa to take her finger blood, saying that it could be used as a medicine guide for her younger brother.\"Yes, it's still a drug guide.\" Marquis Gu said without changing his face.Gu Jinyu was afraid of pain, but for the sake of her brother, she put up with it. She closed her eyes and held out her hand: \"take it, doctor!\"Dr. Zhuge took a drop of her finger blood.Gu Jinyu was in tears with pain. Marquis Gu comforted his daughter, and then went to the study.About a quarter of an hour later, doctor Zhuge came over with a complicated look.\"How?\" Marquis Gu asked nervously.Dr. Zhuge looked directly into the eyes of marquis Gu and said, \"your son and your love's blood really can't mix. They are not brothers and sisters.\"Rao was psychologically prepared, but when he really heard this from doctor Zhuge, he was just like a bolt from the blue, and stunned the whole person of marquis Gu.Gu Yan, needless to say, must be his own. That boy is like him everywhere and has the same bad temper. Except for his mother's eyes.On the contrary, Gu Jinyu was not like him and Yao when he was young. The more he grew up, the less he was!Marquis Gu is not without wonder, if the two children were born one after the other, marquis Gu is suspicious. But they are twins, one is biological, the other can be false?He never thought of the possibility of holding it wrong.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: 66Gu Hou Ye Leng for a long time to find his voice: \"this in advance do not tell anyone, especially his wife, I do not want her to be any stimulation.\"Doctor Zhuge said: \"as long as the Lord can let go my useless apprentice, I will keep my mouth shut for the LORD all my life. However, is the Marquis sure that his wife gave birth to twins? \"\"I'm sure my wife was awake when she gave birth.\"\"There's only one possibility.\"It's wrong.Marquis Gu pondered for a moment and said, \"you stay in the mansion first. If you have something, I will call you.\"Dr. Zhuge bowed: \"at any time, I'll wait for you to send me.\"\"You step back.\"\"Yes.\"After Dr. Zhuge left, marquis Gu slumped down on the chair. His strength seemed to be drained, and his brain was numb.The night in the villa was terrifying. The cool moonlight fell on the ground silently, shining on the trees and flowers in a yard.The baby is wrong.As for how to hold the wrong, we can only ask the servants who accompanied Yao in those years.It's a pity that after so many years, those people are no longer in Hou's residence. It's very difficult to find them.Besides, he was not sure if the child was still alive.It's false to say that he doesn't care a bit, but it's also false to say that he cares so much that he doesn't look back.For the sake of his son's illness, Yao's body has been exhausted. He must consider whether Yao can bear the blow of the truth.If he told her it would kill her, he would rot the truth in his stomach all his life.At the same time, he has to consider Jinyu's situation.Jinyu is the child he raised in the palm of his hand. He loves her more than his four sons. He doesn't want Jinyu to be hurt at all.Finally, it's the child.He didn't know whether to recognize the child or not, but he had to find her anyway.She is Gu Yan's only medicine guide. She can save Gu Yan's life.\"Somebody\"Marquis.\"\"Call mammy Fang.\"\"Yes.\"Mother Fang is the steward of Zhuangzi and the companion of Yao.When Yao's younger brother got married, Yao went to the Yao family in Qingcheng without knowing that he was pregnant. After living in the Yao family for half a year, he returned to Beijing. I was going to go back to Beijing to give birth, but it broke out on the way.That time, Mammy Fang was not by Yao's side, but she knew more about that year than most people.Mammy Fang came into the room and gave a salute to Marquis Gu: \"master, are you looking for a maid?\"Marquis Gu raised his hand. There was no light in the room. His look was half bright and half dark in the moonlight.Marquis Gu asked, \"in which temple did my wife give birth?\"Mammy Fang was slightly shocked: \"how did the Marquis suddenly ask about this?\"Marquis Gu said faintly: \"I heard that my wife often went to that temple to worship Bodhisattva recently. Yan'er's etiology has improved. I plan to add incense to the temple another day.\"Mammy Fang found it strange that the Marquis never believed in Buddhism. How could she suddenly propose to go to the temple to offer incense?--On the other hand, Gu Jiao took the silver and went to the store to make new rock sugar elbows and braised lion heads, which were still packed in jars. After that, she went to the cloth shop and bought some shoes and clothes.There were too many things for her to carry in her small basket, so she packed two big bags and held them well.Xiao LIULANG knows that she will come to town today, and as long as she comes to town, she will come to pick him up from school. He asks Luo Ershu to wait.After waiting for half an hour, even Gu Xiaoshun was thinking whether his elder sister had gone back, and then Gu Jiao appeared.Her body is small, but the burden is so big that almost all her people are blocked. She is very difficult to stick out a small head from the side of the burden. Her face is red, and she gasps.She's not tired, she's suffocating.Three people help her to pick up the burden and put it on the cart.After sitting down, Gu Xiaoshun urged: \"Uncle Luo, hurry back to the village, I'm hungry!\"Uncle Luo said with a smile, \"OK!\"Gu Jiao wiped the sweat on her forehead: \"why haven't you gone yet?\"Gu Xiaoshun said, \"wait for you. My brother-in-law said you would come.\"Gu Jiao took a look at Xiao LIULANG and said seriously, \"after waiting so long, aren't you afraid I've gone back?\"I have to wait for her, really!Xiao LIULANG said quietly, \"are you not afraid that we have left since you came so late?\"It's not a good way to get here from Buzhuang. I have to take a long way to see if he is waiting for her! Damn it!Gu Xiaoshun felt his stomach and muttered: suddenly he was full. Why?When he got home, xiaojingkong had been waiting at the door for a long time. The old lady told him that Jiaojiao would come back from counting to 100.After counting hundreds, the ox cart finally entered the village.He spread his feet and ran out: \"Jiaojiao! JiaojiaoHe likes to call Jiao Jiao, and Gu Jiao follows him. She was about to remind xiaotuanzi not to fall when she saw xiaotuanzi running towards her.He was used to wrestling. He hugged his bald head and rolled to Gu Jiao's feet like a wax gourd.Gu Xiaoshun carries the burden. Gu Jiao's hands are free. She pulls up the little clearance and pats the dust on him: \"does it hurt?\"Xiaojingkong shook his head: \"no! No pain! I'm a good wrestlerGu Jiao: it's hard to fall others. It's hurt to fall yourself.\"Call people.\" Gu Jiao pointed to Xiao LIULANG and Gu Xiaoshun.Xiaojingkong is a polite child. She called her brother-in-law and Xiaoshun.Although I don't want to.Gu Jiao leads xiaojingkong home.Small clearance a jump, very happy!When he got home, Xiao Jingkong went to the kitchen and brought over some big baked sweet potatoes.\"Jiaojiao, eat sweet potato! I baked itIn fact, Xue Ningxiang brought the sweet potatoes when he came to cook at noon. The fire was made by Xue Ningxiang and the sweet potatoes were washed by Xue Ningxiang. Xiaojingkong just put the cleaned sweet potatoes into the stove with tongs. Even after baking, Xue Ningxiang pulled them out.But in xiaojingkong's opinion, he has completed the most soul - baked sweet potato, so this is his sweet potato!What sister Xue does is called taking sweet potato, washing sweet potato and grilling sweet potato!Gu Jiao tasted it with face.\"Is it delicious? Was it good? Is it delicious? \" Little clearance cocked his head.\"Well, it's delicious.\" It's a little cold. She can't eat well, and Xiaoshun is OK, but Xiao LIULANG's stomach is delicate and may be upset.Gu Jiao took the roasted sweet potato to the kitchen and warmed it up. Then she took out two bowls and filled them with some rock sugar elbows and braised lion's head.Xue Ningxiang gave her some boiled eggs and steamed bread.When Gu Jiao came back, xiaojingkong had already set up the dishes and chopsticks.A family of five sat down to eat.Small clearance waiting for feeding.Gu Jiao put a fat but not greasy elbow into his bowl.Xiaojingkong was so excited that he grabbed the chopsticks to pick up the meat, but he didn't eat it yet. He just smelled it for a short time, then turned his eyes and fell backward with a thump!He fell on his back, head tilted, tongue out, unconscious!Gu JiaoIn this world, some people are really dizzy!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: 67What's wrong with your body?Gu Jiao holds the person back to the room to check, what matter wood has.For two generations, I've seen blood sickness, I've seen needle sickness, and I've seen meat sickness for the first time. I've seen it for a long time.The rest of the people were also surprised, but when they heard that the little guy could snore, they knew that he was OK.When xiaojingkong woke up, the meat on the table was gone. He fell on the table and cried!\"My meat! My meat! My meat... \"People: it's not that we don't keep meat for you, it's that you can't eat it at all.Cajoling is not Gu Jiao's strong point. The old lady took part in the battle herself. She cheated the most powerful person in the world, a little fart. She was not afraid at all!The old lady coaxed for a while and then stopped.Xiaojingkong went out of the old lady's house and came to Gujiao's house. She said to Gujiao, \"meat says that it doesn't want to be eaten by me.\"Gu Jiao was stunned: \"ah... It doesn't want to be eaten by you...\"Xiaojingkong held back her tears and said firmly, \"my aunt said that because I am still too young, when I grow up, it will be eaten by me.\"Gu Jiao's admiration for her aunt was so overwhelming that she could think of such an excuse to deceive the king. Didn't she deceive people before?The old lady can't remember clearly. She just vaguely feels that she has cheated a lot of people. Those who are more powerful than her and those who are less powerful than her are all fooled by her.After Xiao LIULANG has bathed Xiao Jingkong, Xiao Jingkong goes back to Xiao LIULANG in his bedroom. Er, no, his own room!Gu Jiao is ready to rest after washing.At this time, xiaojingkong came over with a small pillow in her arms.\"What's the matter?\" Gu Jiao looked at him, \"what's wrong?\"Xiaojingkong opened his watery eyes: \"my bed says it doesn't want me to sleep today.\"Gu Jiao a Leng, this words how so familiar?No, it's just a theory of talent and learning. Are you drawing inferences from one instance?Gu Jiao hands embrace: \"your bed did not say so.\"Small clearance: \"it has.\"Gu Jiao: \"it doesn't, it can't speak.\"\"How does Jiao Jiao know that she can't speak?\" she said? My flesh can speak, so can my bedGu Jiao: \"I can't refute it.Gu Jiao looks for the old lady with a serious face.Whoever instills the wrong ideas will take care of it!The old lady resolutely put the bolt on the door and lay on the bed, covering her head with a quilt: \"asleep! SleepGu JiaoIt's not right for you to be so irresponsible. After fooling around, you don't even have after-sales service. Bad comment!Gu Jiao will not be strong to the weak children, she eventually brought the small clearance back to her house.During this period, Xiao LIULANG did not say a word.Xiao Jingkong waved to Xiao LIULANG with a winning expression: \"Westinghouse will let you sleep tonight! Don't miss me so muchHappy small clearance holding a pillow in Gu Jiao's bed jumped for a long time, after jumping tired, he fell asleep.But it would be naive for xiaojingkong to think that she could sleep with Gujiao all night.As soon as he fell asleep, Xiao LIULANG came over clutching a crutch and, without saying a word, carried him back to Westinghouse.There is no deepest routine, only deeper routine, your brother-in-law or your brother-in-law!When Xiao Jingkong woke up, he found himself lying on Westinghouse's bed. He was not surprised to be sad!He felt like he was sleeping in vain!!!Of course, he didn't think Jiaojiao didn't want him. He could guess that he was stolen back to the house by someone with his toes!Rao Shixiao Jingkong, no matter how sensible he is, can't hold his back now. He raises his head, pulls his voice, kicks his legs and wails: \"bad brother-in-law! Bad brother-in-law! He stole the baby! He stole me in the middle of the night! He's humanThe old lady who is eating melon seeds in the main room shakes her hand and spills all the melon seeds!Return the human teeth? Is that how it works?Xiao LIULANG went to school, and Gu Jiao went to pick mountain goods. There was only a little clearance and an old lady left at home.The old lady once again played a trick, but this time the small clearance is not easy to fool.\"I want darkness! I want it to be dark! \"\"It will be dark at night...\"\"No, no! I want it now! It's dark now! Wow -- \"Sensible children generally don't cry. When they cry, ordinary people can't stand it.Xiaojingkong cried so much that all the villagers rushed over. The questioning eyes seemed to be that the old lady abused the little monk at home.The old lady has a big head!Last night did not do after-sales of the old lady, finally a person to carry all.--Gu Jiao doesn't know that Xiao Jingkong broke down and cried after she got up. She has no experience in raising children, and she has no experience in this respect since she was a child.If she was picking mushrooms in the back mountain, she could hear Xiao Jingkong's cry. But she went a little far today and went to the other side of the mountain to dig bamboo shoots.When she adopted xiaojingkong back, she found that there were bamboo shoots in the woods near the temple.When she was selling mountain products in the market, someone once exchanged winter bamboo shoots with her for two handfuls of fungus. She boiled chicken soup with winter bamboo shoots, and Xiao LIULANG drank all the soup.There are no winter bamboo shoots now, but spring bamboo shoots are also delicious.The road in the woods is very difficult to walk, so there are not many people coming to dig bamboo shoots. Gu Jiao soon put the basket in a heavy load.Just as she was about to go down the mountain, a groan of pain came from the depth of the forest.Gu Jiao's first reaction was which villager was injured. Without hesitation, she walked towards the deep forest.When she came to the scene, she was surprised to find that a man fell into a two meter deep trap.It's a bit familiarEr... It seems that she dug it years ago.Because there has been no prey, she forgot the trap herself.I didn't expect that in the past so long, I didn't catch the prey. On the contrary, I was caught by a living man!Who dares to come to such a deep forest?Gu Jiao leans out her head and looks into the pit.The man only felt the light on the top dim and immediately raised his head.Four eyes opposite, two people are stunned.\"It's you?\"\"It's you?\"speak with!Gu Jiao: isn't this the smelly Marquis who let the bodyguard rampage on the street, knocked over her things and almost broke the debt?Marquis Gu: isn't this the smelly girl who beat his bodyguard in the street and smashed his head with his money?Marquis Gu's face suddenly cooled down, and the bottom of his heart rose, and the joy of being redeemed disappeared.Gu Jiao: ha ha.Gu Jiao turns around and goes!This person, she did not save!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: 68Marquis Gu looked at Gu Jiao appear, and looked at Gu Jiao leave, the bottom of the heart of the anger rubbed rubbed rubbed to burn up.\"Stop!\" He drank hard.Oh, if you ask me to stop, stop. Who are you?Gu Jiao can walk natural and unrestrained, didn't have the slightest hesitation because of his identity, or his anger.Marquis Gu has never seen such an arrogant person in most of his life!He has learned her identity from his daughter. She is a little medicine boy in the rejuvenation hall. Her master, Dr. Li, has made great contributions to Yan'er's treatment.Because of this, he decided to let bygones be bygones for her offenses in town.But she's good. She can't help him in the mountains!Especially her just now that is what look in the eyes, a cheap life unexpectedly also dare to despise a country Marquis ye, this is live tired of, red fruit fruit ground provocation Ding'an Marquis's authority!When he goes out, he has to punish her for her disrespect!If you don't save him, he can go out by himself!Whoops\u2014\u2014Deeper in the woods, there came a wolf howl.Generally speaking, adult wolves don't bark during the day. This is a young wolf, and it can't control its wolf nature very well. It makes a sharp howl, so it should be hungry.No accident, the wolf of his family will come out to look for food soon.Gu Jiao sat down under a big tree nearby and began to wait for the wolf.Marquis Gu pulled out a dagger in the trap. He was tall, and the trap was not deep for him. The difficulty was that his foot was caught by the trap.He tried to pry the clip open with a dagger, but it didn't seem to be an ordinary clip. He pryed it for a long time without shaking it.\"You can't pry it open.\" Gu Jiao took out the water bag and drank a drink lightly.It's strange that the trap she made can be easily pried open.Marquis Gu frowned: \"you didn't go? Yes? Waiting to see Ben Hou's joke? \"Gu Jiao light way: \"you are not funny, also not good-looking.\"Marquis GuIs that what he meant?Also, what is he not good-looking?It's not that Marquis Gu is arrogant, but that his face has covered up his talent since he was a child, and even that he has become a family and a business. What the world talks about most is his face.This is the first time someone has said that he is not good-looking.Marquis Gu is essentially a man who looks like dirt. But Gu Jiao really said that, and he was not comfortable.The young wolf howled again. The wild wolf should be coming soon. He didn't think that a little girl had the ability to deal with one or even several adult wild wolves.He snapped: \"what are you doing? Why don't you try to get king Raben up? After a while, the wolf comes. You can't live on your own! \"\"Wait a minute.\" Gu Jiao said.What are you waiting for?If you wait any longer, the wolf will come!Marquis Gu is very anxious.Rao Shi is a man of martial arts, and he can't guarantee that he can still kill adult wolves when he is caught in a trap.The rustling sound came from the grass. It was the wolf.Gu Jiao climbed up the tree.When Marquis Gu saw that she didn't agree, he went up the tree. He was so angry that his heart ached.Will you die if you save him and climb the tree again?Leaving him alone in the trap, waiting to sacrifice the wolf?Wolf did not accident found the trap of Gu Hou ye, it put green eyes, open mouth, saliva dripping on the ground.Marquis Gu tightly grasped the dagger in his hand.The wolf jumped out of the trap with a whoosh, slapped Mr. Gu's dagger with one paw, and tore it hard at Mr. Gu's neck!At the critical moment, a thin figure came down from the sky, grabbed the wolf's head and cut its throat with a sickleFresh blood splashed on marquis Gu's face.Marquis Gu is confused!At that moment, he really thought that he was going to die. When the blood spattered out, his first reaction was his own. He didn't realize that he was saved until the wolf fell to the ground by Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao clapped her hands, bent over to pick with a sickle, and lifted the trap away.Marquis Gu looks at Gu Jiao, who is calm and relaxed. For a moment, he doubts that he is dazzled.Did the girl really kill a wolf? How do you think she looks like she cut a bag of cabbages!Gu Jiao had a mission in her previous life. She had more terrible things than the wolf. If she could not kill the wolf, she would have died in the mission.Gu Jiao holds the wolf in one hand and the rope hanging from the tree in the other. She goes out of the trap in three or two steps.\"Will you come up?\" Gu Jiao throws the rope to him.Gu Hou Ye won't admit that he was shocked by the girl. He grabbed the rope and let Gu Jiao pull him up.Gu Jiao's trap is not sharp. It's just a tight bite, but his other foot is sprained and swollen.He sat on the ground for a long time before he came back to himself: \"did you just... Use me as bait?\"Gu Jiao didn't speak.Marquis Gu gritted his teeth: 'speak quickly! Did you use Ben Hou as bait? \"Gu Jiao looked at him openly: \"in that case, if you don't make bait, you will be caught up, and it's more convenient for me to kill it in the trap. On the flat ground, you will be bitten twice by it. \"Lord Gu was so angry that his teeth cackled: 'so you just took him as bait! You vicious wild girlGu Jiao said, \"I'm not a wild girl. I have parents.\"Marquis Gu sneered, \"is that right? Where's your father? \"Gu Jiao thought about it and said seriously, \"he can't come, but you can go to him.\"Marquis Gu smoothed his sleeve: \"OK, where is he?\"Son is not a godfather's fault. He wants to see what bastard gave birth to such a vicious girl!Gu Jiao glanced at the soles of his feet: \"he's under the ground.\"Marquis GuGu Jiao prepares to go down the mountain.Gu Hou ye said coldly: \"you just leave me here?\"Gu Jiao gave him a strange look.Who are you? Why should I care about you?Marquis Gu's heart aches again. He finds out that this girl has never seen the world. She doesn't understand how powerful a marquis is. It's the saying that a newborn calf is not afraid of tigers.\"Fortunately, I'm not a killer,\" he said Or you're dead!Gu Jiao took a deep look at him and nodded: \"it's really lucky.\"People who want to kill her, she will definitely do it very clean.Marquis Gu: how do you feel a little cold behind your neck\"Do you know how to get to the temple near here?\" Marquis Gu asked.\"I know.\" Gu Jiao said.\"Lead the way.\" Lord Gu ordered.Gu Jiao looks at the wolf corpse on the ground, a face hesitates.Marquis Gu knew that she was reluctant to give up the wolf. The wolf should be able to exchange a lot of money when she got it on the market, which is a great fortune for poor farmers.\"I bought it,\" he said impatientlyGu Jiao did not refuse: \"twenty Liang.\"Marquis Gu handed her a twenty Liang silver note: \"can we go now?\"Gu Jiao collected the banknote and looked at the wolf corpse on the ground again: \"what are you going to do with it?\"Marquis Gu said: \"throw it away!\"\"Are you sure you want to throw it away?\" Gu Jiao looks at him suspiciously.Lord Gu said with disdain, \"it's just a wolf. Can't I afford to throw it? Why don't you lead the way? \"\"Oh.\" Gu Jiao bent down and easily picked up the wolf and carried it on her shoulder. \"You've thrown it away. I picked it up. Don't ask me for it.\"Marquis GuPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: 69You can carry it. Why didn't you just say that? To make that indecisive appearance, is it to decide which hand to carry?Marquis Gu thought that if he died young, he would make the smelly girl angry.Think about how gentle and lovely her daughter is. Look at this girl again. She is everywhere!Luckily it wasn't his daughter!Gu Jiao knew nothing about the inner drama of Gu Hou Ye. She carried the wolf in front of her and soon got out of the woods.She came to the steps, pointed to the top of the steps and said, \"go up the steps and you'll see the temple.\"Then she turned and walked up the mountain.Marquis Gu stopped her and said, \"wait, don't you take me up?\"Gu Jiao stopped and looked at him strangely: \"why should I take you up?\"\"You...\" Mr. Gu took a deep breath and asked with a smile, \"why do you think I bought your wolf? I don't want to buy it. Throw it away on the spot? \"Gu Jiao thought about it and said seriously, \"because you are stupid and have a lot of money?\"Marquis Gu is going to vomit blood!Ah, ah!What kind of angry girl is this!At first, he thought that Gu Yan was very irritating, but when he saw this girl, he began to think that his little son was especially cute!Marquis Gu finally failed to coerce Gu Jiao to show him the way. In fact, when he saw these steps, he knew how to go up the mountain, but he couldn't face up to it. He wanted to call the girl, but she didn't eat\u2014\u2014Marquis Gu is angry, but he can't really fight a girl, especially the others\"Don't let me see you next time, or I'll settle the old and new accounts with you!\"Gu Jiao didn't even pay attention to him. She left him behind and went underground!Marquis Gu covered his cracked chest, calmed down and limped up the mountain.He went straight to the abbot and told him his identity.The abbot looked at the bloody man in front of him. He almost thought that he was a desperate grass-roots bandit. He was about to call his disciples to set up the eighteen Arhats array to destroy the bandits\"Originally, it was the Marquis of Ding'an. I'm sorry, but I'm far away.\" The abbot said.Mrs. Hou is a frequent visitor to the temple, but Mr. Gu is here for the first time, so the abbot doesn't know him.Marquis Gu said calmly, \"abbot, don't be polite. I'm here today. I want to ask him about something.\"The abbot looked behind him and said, \"did the Marquis come alone?\"\"Yes,\" said Marquis GuHow could he have lost his way if he hadn't come alone?In fact, it was also his fault that he refused to dismount. When he got to the foot of the mountain, he found out the way up the mountain. It was just because he was riding a horse and it was not easy for him to walk on the steps, so he planned to go through the forest.Unexpectedly, he was trapped in a trap, and the horse disappeared. Finally, he walked up the mountain honestly.The abbot realized the importance of the matter and asked his disciples to guard the door and not allow anyone to get close to himMarquis Gu said bluntly: \"my wife gave birth in the temple. I want to ask if there were other mothers who gave birth in the temple that night?\"An ominous premonition rose from the bottom of the Abbot's heart: \"why does the Marquis ask this?\"\"The abbot doesn't care why the Marquis asked. You just answer the Marquis, yes or no?\"The abbot pondered for a moment and pinched the beads in his handMarquis Gu's heart was tight: \"abbot, do you know where the child is now?\"The abbot shook his head: \"I don't know. The benefactor came only once, leaving no name. He went down the mountain within two days after giving birth. He was a daughter. \"Marquis Gu is not surprised that it is his daughter. After all, if it is not, it is impossible to be wrong.Thinking of what, he asked, \"does that woman look like a rich family?\"The abbot shook his head again: \"no, there are patches on her clothes.\"He just saw the benefactor from a distance. He didn't even see her face clearly. He only vaguely remembered that she was wearing very simple clothes.If there are so many pilgrims in the temple, why do you have an impression of the benefactor? It's mainly because she has a big stomach and goes up the mountain to offer incense.No one expected that it would rain heavily in the afternoon, so she and Mrs. Hou had to stay in the temple.It's hard to remember who broke out first. After all, Mrs. Hou was being served, but the benefactor was alone in the Zen room. When the midwife came, she found that she was about to give birth.It was a very chaotic night.Especially the abbot was cheated into drinkingIt's hard to look back on the past. The abbot collected his thoughts and said, \"Amitabha.\"Marquis Gu was silent.He had thought that the child might not have been taken away by such a family as Zanying, but he didn't expect that he would be poor enough to wear patches.He didn't dare to think what kind of child such a family would raise.Jinyu knows that being raised so well in Houfu shows that birth is not the most important thing, but the family that grows up is.Can a child who grew up in the countryside really become a marquis's daughter?However, the child's situation was really miserable. At least it was the blood of Hou family. He would not treat her badly even if he didn't recognize her in the future.He'll make it up to her from somewhere else.After the conversation with abbot, marquis Gu got up and said goodbye: \"please don't tell anyone about my coming to the temple.\"Although the abbot didn't know why Marquis Gu secretly investigated the benefactor's child, he still nodded and agreed.Marquis Gu went back home.It's really hard to lose a horse.The other foot was swollen into a pig's hoof.Finally, he came to the foot of the mountain. His last strength was drained. He sat on the last step and gasped.All of a sudden, he felt the light on his head dim, as if something huge was covering him.He held the dagger on his waist and raised his head warily. Then he saw a strong horse.This horse looks familiarWait, isn't this the horse he lost?The next second, he found a man sitting in front of a wolf.\"It's you?\" Marquis Gu was so surprised that he stood up!Gu Jiao rode an ancient horse for the first time. It's strange and fresh. She sat on a tall horse with a small body. In a moment, she had a feeling of arrogance!She pulled the reins in her hand, looked down at Lord Gu, nodded seriously and said, \"well, it's me.\"Marquis GuMarquis Gu looked at her horse strangely: \"where did you get the horse?\"Gu Jiao honest way: \"pick up.\"Marquis Gu's face is covered with black lines. Can you pick up horses? What kind of luck?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: 70\"This is my horse.\" Marquis Gu said seriously.Gu Jiao looked at him suspiciously, as if judging the truth of his words.Marquis Gu's heart trembled with her eyes. He suddenly remembered the wolf and said, \"I didn't throw it away. I lost it by accident!\"Although the lost things can also be picked up, if the owner asks for them, they must be returned, otherwise they will constitute the crime of embezzlement.Zhou and Liu, who refused to return Xiao Qin's silver, suffered this loss. As a result, they were beaten in the Yamen and fined a large amount of silver.Of course, marquis Gu didn't know his family's own Wulong, but he thought that a little girl should be able to bluff: \"if you don't give it back to me, you will be caught by the county magistrate to beat the board.\"No matter how fierce she is, she is a country girl after all. What do country people fear most? Of course, she was an official. Although she was a marquis, she didn't say what he was. She didn't know and was fearless.County Lord is different, it is a real snake, no country people are not afraid of!Gu Jiao listened to his words, did not refute immediately.Marquis Gu thinks there is a play!The next second, he heard her ask him, \"how can you prove that this is your horse?\"Marquis Gu was stunned.Yeah, how to prove it?In order to travel in a low-key way, instead of riding in his own sweaty BMW, he chose a guard's horse, and even the Houfu emblem on the saddle was deliberately erased by him.\"Horseshoe! It's the horse in the army. It's different from all the horseshoes on the market. \" Marquis Gu finally thought of an evidence.Unexpectedly, Gu Jiao said, \"I haven't seen any other horseshoes. How can I know if it's your one-sided view?\"Lord Gu choked.It's a scholar meeting a soldier. I can't explain why!Gu Jiao said fairly: \"otherwise, you go to the Yamen to report. If the county magistrate says that the horse belongs to you, I will give it back to you.\"County Master is a few heads, dare not award the horse to him? But the problem is that he lost a horse and went to the small county government to report the case?Why, he must be short of a horse? How poor is he? Is she too poor to open a pot, or is she too poor to beg in the street, and she competes with a country girl for the horse she picked up on the way?Especially an ordinary horse which is not very expensive.Does he want face?Gu Jiao looked at him, pondered for a moment and said, \"if you really want it, I can sell it to you. Well, it's not easy for me to get it back. \"Where on earth is it not easy for you? Isn't it carrying you all the way? You can't even walk! Wolves don't have to carry on their own!Marquis Gu is so spoiled by him.However, he can't walk any more.Only when he got to the town could he hire a carriage, and from here to the town for at least twenty or thirty miles, he was afraid that his leg would break and he would not be able to get there.\"Fifty Liang.\" Gu Jiao said.How can a broken horse be more expensive than a wolf? You start from the ground! \"Gu Jiao said seriously: \"the wolf is not your just need, the horse is.\"It's just a need, it's going to start!Marquis Gu is so angry that his liver hurts!At last, marquis Gu bought his horse back for fifty taels of silver.My own horse, where can I reason?--It was evening when Marquis Gu returned to the villa. The afterglow of the setting sun fell on the eaves of the villa, reflecting a glare like gilding.Marquis Gu gave the horse to the bodyguard in the mansion and went to the inner courtyard of a family of four.As soon as he got to the door, he heard a loud noise. With a frown on his brow, he crossed the threshold and saw that almost all the servants in the yard were coming, hiding behind the trees and flowers, not daring to move or walk.Under the corridor, on a cane chair watched by all the servants, his son, Gu Yan, was lying in awe.Beside Gu Yan stood Gu Jinyu, who was pale with anger.Gu Jinyu is holding a white rabbit in her arms.\"Why can't I have rabbits?\" Gu Jinyu asked discontentedly.Gu Yan snorted lazily: \"you are not allowed to raise it.\"Gu Jinyu said angrily, \"if you have the ability, give me a reason!\"Gu Yan put his hand behind his head and said leisurely, \"this is my yard. If I don't let you raise it, I won't let you raise it!\"Gu Jinyu held the rabbit and stomped: \"this is my yard, too!\"Gu Yan snorted faintly: \"your yard is in the capital!\"Gu Jinyu lived in the capital half of his time. Unlike Gu Yan, who lived here for many years, Gu Yan naturally thought that this place belonged to him more.People don't dare to argue with each other, and they don't dare to leave. In case there's a quarrel between sister and brother, they can't afford it.Marquis Gu almost understood what was going on. Gu Jinyu liked cats and dogs when she was young, but Gu Yan was very disgusted. The two brothers and sisters quarreled about raising a pet.He used to wonder that they were twins and the closest people in the world. They should have a good relationship, but Gu Yan never spoke and would bully Jin Yu.Gu Yan didn't let Jinyu eat Yao's milk, and he would cry as soon as he ate it. He didn't let Yao hold Jinyu, and he would even punch and kick Jinyu as long as he lay in a cradle.At that time, Gu Yan was just a little milk bag, who didn't care about it. He just thought it was a child's possessiveness.Gu Yan is too old to bully Jinyu, but he doesn't get close to Jinyu.The things that I couldn't figure out seemed to be clear after I knew Jinyu's life experience.Gu Yan and his sister had been together for ten months in the womb, and they were really the closest people in the world. Therefore, after Gu Yan was born, he could clearly feel that the baby girl lying beside him was not his sister.He wants his sister.Only his sister could make him as stable as he was in the womb, but he was surrounded by a completely strange baby girl.No wonder he always cried so loudly. He was asking for his sister.Unfortunately, no one understood him.Until he was older, he did not remember, but the rejection of Gu Jinyu remained in his bones.Marquis Gu thought this speculation was ridiculous, but he couldn't think of a better explanation.The quarrel between the sister and brother continued.Gu Jinyu was aggrieved and said: \"the rabbit is neither noisy nor noisy. Why don't you let me raise it? Will you be reasonable? \"Gu Yan looked up at the sky: \"it's unreasonable!\"Gu Jinyu bit his lip: \"why?\"Gu Yan raised his eyebrows: \"I like it!\"\"You...\" Gu Jinyu's face was red with anger!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: 71Gu Jinyu failed to beat Gu Yan in the end.Although she is the only daughter in the family, Gu Yan is the youngest, and Gu Yan is really in poor health.Looking at Gu Jinyu reluctantly let people take the rabbit away, Gu Yan happily pick eyebrows, Gu Hou Ye's heart is mixed.Gu Yan was not sociable when he was young. He was not close to anyone, including Yao.He rejected all those who were good to Gu Jinyu, but almost no one in the whole family was bad to Gu Jinyu.If he doesn't know the truth, he will think it's all his son's fault as before. He didn't think that the most important person in his son's life is missing, and his son is the most injured one.However, even if he thought it was his son who was wrong, he never scolded him, but he would redouble his efforts to make up for Jinyu's grievances.But Jinyu's grievances can be made up for. What about her son?What they can't give their son, can that child give it?But she said that Gu Jiao didn't rush home after she went down the mountain. Instead, she carried the wolf to the market and sold it for 18 Liang silver.After that, Gu Jiao went to the academy to pick up Xiao LIULANG and Gu Xiaoshun from school, and they went back to the village together.The old lady, who had been quarreled by little clearance all day, was finally liberated.She was paralyzed on the rattan chair like a salted fish. She felt that if they didn't come back, she could die in the same place!Xiaojingkong has been looking forward to Gujiao all day, but when Gujiao comes back, he runs away again.A man closed the door and sat on a small bench in the corner, his face against the wall. How pitiful it was.Gu Jiao didn't understand what had happened and didn't see xiaojingkong. She was surprised: \"eh? What about the clearance? \"The old lady weakly pointed to Westinghouse: \"angry, avoid you.\"Gu Jiao puzzled: \"angry? Who provoked him? \"The old lady looked at Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG angrily: \"you two! Who told you to take him in the middle of the night? Who told you to leave before dawn? \"The first is talking about Xiao LIULANG, and the second is talking about Gu Jiao.\"I'm so tired!\" The old lady said she didn't want to talk to the couple!Gu Jiao didn't understand, but when the old lady said it, she understood.Gu Jiao went to Westinghouse.When Xiao Jingkong heard someone coming, his ears stood up, but he didn't turn around.Gu Jiao came behind him, bent down, looked at his side face and said, \"angry with me?\"Small clearance turned a direction on the stool, continued to back to Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao whispered: \"I didn't mean to. I didn't know you would be afraid.\"\"I'm not afraid,\" he said! I'm not that timid! \"Gu Jiao pretended to be surprised: \"is that right? Then why are you angry? \"\"I... i... i... I was...\" xiaojingkong teased for a long time, but he didn't say \"miss you\".Gu Jiao came to him again. He didn't look at Gu Jiao, but Gu Jiao looked at him firmly: \"well, I'm wrong today. I apologize to you. Can you forgive me?\"Xiaojingkong took a quick look at Gu Jiao, quickly lowered her head, pinched the corner of her dress, and said softly, \"it takes a kiss to forgive you.\"Gu Jiao's heart is about to sprout. What's so cute? Don't say one kiss, she will give ten!Gu Jiao gave him a kiss on his little face without hesitation!Little clearance confused!He opened a pair of big eyes like black grapes and blinked at Gu Jiao for several seconds. Finally, he cried out!\"AhIt's said casually that you are so close!The small hand of small clearance covers the face and runs away shyly!I had a little clearance for kissing. I felt like I had drunk all night, and my face was very red.During the meal, he sat beside Gu Jiao and behaved like a little Mimosa.At night, Xiao LIULANG bathed him as usual. He sat in a small basin and handed over his left face: \"washing this side is enough. Don't wash that side. There are relatives there!\"Xiao LIULANG grabs the towel in the basin and claps it on his right face.Small clearance:Small clearance:! \"\"Wow --\"Suddenly, Xiao Jingkong burst into tears in the kitchen. The old lady who ate the candied fruit in the kitchen trembled and nearly lost her life!The old lady growled: \"LIULANG! What have you done to him again! \"Xiao LIULANG didn't do anything. He just washed all the kisses on a young monk's face.Xiao Jingkong cried so sad.Finally, Gu Jiao came over and gave him another kiss. He could stop his tears.After that, xiaojingkong was very careful. He always protected his face with his little hand to prevent the bad brother-in-law from sneaking attack.He has no hair and can go to bed after taking a bath and wearing clothes.Holding his little pillow, he went to the old lady's room to say hello, and then to Gu Jiao's room to say hello: \"Jiao Jiao, I'm going to sleep. See you tomorrow.\"\"Go to sleep, I'll call you tomorrow morning,\" Gu said\"Well!\" Little clearance bounced back to Westinghouse.He took off his shoes and crept into bed.Xiao LIULANG is sitting at his desk.Xiaojingkong takes a wary look at the bad brother-in-law and swings the little pillow in, far away from the bad brother-in-law's pillow!Xiao LIULANG didn't lift his eyelids for a moment. He only gave a faint sound.Xiaojingkong said with a fork: \"you don't want to touch my kiss!\"Xiao LIULANG brow tip a pick: \"your kiss?\"Xiaojingkong complacently said: \"Jiaojiao gave it to me! You didn't! \"Xiao LIULANG looked at him slowly. His eyes fell on his fat little face. He said slowly, \"don't move. When you fall asleep, they will fly away.\"Xiao Jingkong's face changed!He seemed to have seen the cruel picture of two relatives leaving him when he didn't pay attention. He was not good at all!These two little traitors!Three seconds later, Xiao Jingkong jumped out of bed and went to Gu Jiao's house. She asked Gu Jiao for a veil to wrap on her face and head.He wrapped himself up like a little peasant woman who was going to work in the field.Then he took a standard farmer Chuai, valiantly back to the house.Xiaojingkong raised his chin and said to the bad brother-in-law, \"I'm blindfolded! They can't fly away! \"Xiao Jingkong is a very clever boy. Although he is under four years old, he can recognize more words than the elder martial brothers in the temple. When the other young monks are having a headache about how to read the Scriptures, he can recite them like a stream.So he once said to Xiao LIULANG, \"I always get used to being the first in the exam.\" it's not a boast, it's just a statement of objective facts.He has a complete logic of his own, and is not interfered by anyone. All the senior brothers can't say him, and the abbot can't do him. In fact, he is a very troublesome existence in the temple.That is to say, when he met Xiao LIULANG, he was occasionally taken to the wrong side.However, his logic is still invincible and powerful, so no matter how Xiao LIULANG interferes with him, he will find his own solution.Xiao LIULANG said, \"what's the use of covering up? Tomorrow you take down the veil and they will fly away\"No, I planted them,\" he said! Sprout in the morning! You can't leave me any more! \"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: 72Xiao LIULANG is speechless.In fact, Xiao LIULANG has never raised a child. I don't know if other people's family is so wonderful.Xue Ningxiang's family certainly is not, that small bean can only eat, unlike the little monk Gu Jiao brought back, the brain is strange, simply do not know what to install.Waiting for the germination of small clearance, holding the quilt Huhu to sleep.Today's Westinghouse in Gu Jiao's care and repair, has long been not wet, the mattress is just a few days ago, soft and warm.Xiaojingkong is very comfortable to sleep, and her face seems to be filled with happy smile.Xiao LIULANG took a look at xiaojingkong, but he didn't take it to heart and continued to copy.Xiao LIULANG copied a line of words, frowned slightly, put down his pen, picked up a book and read it.Soon found that the book is not easy to read, he deeply frowned.In a moment, he turned his head and his eyes fell on the little monk who was sleeping on his back.He stood up, came to the bed, bent slightly, reached out his slender fingertips, and gently untied the veil wrapped in his head.The small clear sky sleeps thunder to be unable to wake up, does not know the slightest ill brother-in-law once again to oneself to make the demon.Xiao LIULANG looked at his red face and pulled it out on his face!Gu Jiao finished her work and came to Westinghouse to ask Xiao LIULANG to do rehabilitation.The door was open, and she came in so dignified that she saw Xiao LIULANG lying on the bed, with delicate hands like jade carving scratching over the small clear face, as if pulling out some invisible grass!He is more serious than studying!Gu Jiao is crazy.What is this for?Is it evil?Is it childish to look at old scholars and play with children?The next day, xiaojingkong was awakened by Gu Jiao.When xiaojingkong woke up, the first thing he did was to feel his veil. Seeing that it was still wrapped around his head intact, he was relieved.A night has passed, bud bud must have grown out, after Jiaojiao kiss will always be in his face!Gu Jiao can't bear to tell him that your little seed, Xiaoya, was killed by your brother-in-law last night!After breakfast, Gu Jiao sent Xiao LIULANG to the village. She used to send them by herself, but now she has a little space. The two of her sisters... Er, no, the two of her sisters send them together.A family of three, strange neat!It is worth mentioning that Xiao LIULANG took the county examination desk, which made him famous in the town, and many people came to him to copy books. But in order to make him prepare for the exam, Gu Jiao did not allow him to copy books to supplement his family.Xiao LIULANG finished the book he had promised and took ten liang of silver, which was less than half of the amount he used to copy, but the silver was several times more.He gave all the money he earned to Gu Jiao, and then he didn't take on the task of copying books.The day of the government examination is approaching, and the examinees begin to make arrangements.The county and government examinations in this dynasty are earlier than those in the previous dynasty. In late February, the candidates will leave for the Gongyuan in Fucheng to welcome the government examination.It took several days to get from the town to Fucheng by coach. Although Xiao LIULANG recovered day by day, he still couldn't lose his crutch. Therefore, Gu Jiao didn't feel at ease. He went out alone.Gu Jiao wants to go to the city with him, but there are old and young in her family. She can't walk easily.Fortunately, Feng Lin asked for leave from the academy and accompanied Xiao LIULANG to Fucheng.Before leaving, Gu Jiao packed up Xiao LIULANG's clothes and silver, and also filled several bottles of emergency medicine from the small medicine box, in case he was carsick after a long journey, and in case he was acclimatized and upset.The carriage to the town was prepared by the president. Gu Jiao didn't refuse. Although she doesn't lack money to hire a carriage now, where is the president's carriage?The coachman is also a member of the academy and is familiar with the Fucheng area.Before dawn, the coachman came to the village with a carriage. Feng Lin was waiting in the town.Gu Jiao took the burden to the car and gave the driver a purse: \"it's hard for you.\"\"No, no, no!\" The coachman was ordered by the dean to send Xiao LIULANG to the government for an examination. He had never seen the Dean care so much for any student, so he did not dare to take care of Jiao's benefits in private.What's more, the dean is honest. If the Dean knows that he has accepted bribes, he must be expelled from the college.Gu Jiao said: \"take it. The red envelope for the dean is bigger than that for you.\"CoachmanOn the other side of the toilet, Xiao Jingkong and Xiao LIULANG start a conversation between men.Xiaojingkong looked serious: \"do you want to talk about it?\"\"About what?\" Xiao LIULANG is calm and calm.Little clearance glanced at him and said, \"you don't have to hush behind my back. I won't peek.\"Xiao LIULANG has no expression: 'say the point.\"\"I heard that you and Jiaojiao have been married for such a long time and haven't been far away yet,\" said xiaojingkongXiao LIULANG raised his eyebrows and said, 'so?\"Small clearance visual front: \"at home a little worried about you.\"Xiao six Lang lightly pulled to pull lips Cape: \"ah.\"Xiaojingkong raised a small palm solemnly and made a gesture of 'stop and say no more:\" you don't have to have too much pressure. It doesn't matter if you don't do well in the exam. Anyway, when I grow up, I will do well in the exam. I don't have to rely on you at home. I can support myself! \"Having said that, he got up from the toilet, put on his pants, and went out with a domineering face!Xie geshou also met Xiao LIULANG who despised the chainWhat kind of arrogant little monk?!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: 73On the other side, marquis Gu lives in the hot spring villa.Marquis Gu has an important position in the capital. He should not leave for long, but it is very important. He has written to the second son of Jingzhong, asking him to go to the palace to ask for leave on his behalf.Ordinary Marquis may not see his majesty, but who let Marquis Gu's sister be his favorite? Therefore, it is not difficult for Mr. Gu to enter the palace.Your majesty is aware of Gu Yan's situation. He guesses that it may be that Gu Yan is not very well for Marquis Gu to stay here. He asks Marquis Gu to stay at the villa and take care of his family's affairs.... I just didn't say that I would return to Beijing after dealing with Gu Yan's affairs.Marquis Gu knows nothing about his Majesty's inner drama. He is busy looking for the child.Marquis Gu first found wenpo who was the midwife of Yao.Wenpo was invited from a nearby village. The scope of the search was not wide, and soon there was news.It's a pity that the midwife passed away a few years ago. Her family only knew that she did go to the temple to deliver the baby and got a big reward. As for more of her family, it's not clear.Marquis Gu used his dead horse as a living horse doctor. He first found some clues from the nearby villages.There are five children born in the temple, one is eighteen, one is nineteen, and the other is only seven years old. None of the three children are right. The remaining two are right. They are all villagers at the foot of the mountain, one in Xinghua village and the other in Qingquan village.The bodyguard of marquis Gu's confidant went to Xinghua village first, but found that the other party was a boy and the month was not right.The twins were born in October, and the boy was born in August.In this way, only the child in Qingquan village is left.If this is not right, they will have to look outside Qingquan Town, so that the scope of the search will be wide.\"Marquis.\" Huang Zhong, the bodyguard in charge of the investigation, was a confidant brought by Marquis Gu from the capital. He said, \"Marquis, Qingquan village is not the village at the foot of the temple. It's all around the other side of the mountain. I'm afraid...\"It's not very likely.Marquis Gu also thought so, so he put Qingquan village in the last investigation.Marquis Gu didn't hold too much hope in his heart. He said to Huang Zhong, \"go and have a look first. Don't come back. If you do, I'll wait for you at the tea shop in the town.\"\"Yes.\"Huang Zhong immediately took a carriage to Qingquan village.Huang Zhong is in his early 40s. He is a big man with a gentle face. He is a good man at first sight and can easily win the trust of strangers.\"That's the baby of the family!\" Said an old man sitting in the sun at his door.The old man is a little bit old and forgetful. He remembers that there is a doll in Gu's family who was born in a temple.\"Who cares about the family?\" Huang Zhong asked.\"Li Zheng! Gu Li Zheng With a wave of his hand, he pointed the way.Even Gu? What a coincidence.Huang Zhong thanks uncle and drives the carriage to Gu's old house.Gu Dashun and Gu Xiaoshun have gone to school. Gu Li is taking Gu Changhai to Yamen to get rice. Gu Changlu and Gu Ershun are sowing in the spring. There are only Gu Yuee and Wu's mother-in-law and daughter-in-law at home.It's Gu Yuee who opens the door.Gu Yuee is not the first time to see the noble and the carriage, but still a Leng Leng: \"you, who are you looking for?\"The country girl had never seen the world before, and the reaction was normal. Huang Zhong laughed and said, \"is Gu Li there?\"Gu Yuee was afraid to talk to a strange man, so she turned her head and ran into the house: \"milk! Someone's looking for grandpa! \"Her mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were all chopping peppers in the backyard. Seeing Gu Yuee running in a panic, Wu frowned impatiently: \"who's looking for your grandfather?\"Gu Yuee pointed back: \"I don't know. I came here in a big carriage.\"It was a carriage. Wu's expression was different.Wu put down his kitchen knife, wiped his hands with a rag, and quickly went to the door.Huang Zhong's two horse carriage was more than the one he sent Gu Xiaoshun's post to. Wu's mind was immediately measured. This person's identity was higher than that of the dean of the academy!But how could such a noble man come to their house?Wu asked with a smile, \"who are you? What's the matter with my husband? \"\"My name is Huang. I heard that there is a child born in a temple in your family. I want to know about that child. \"Wu's smile disappeared.I'm looking for the little disaster star. As long as I get involved with the little disaster star, it's not good!Wu's black face is about to close the door, but Liu's eyes flashed and came over, laughing and saying: \"that can't ask for nothing.\"Huang Zhong, knowing and smiling, took out a silver ingot from his arms.The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law's eyes were straight in an instant.Liu reached for it, but Wu grabbed the silver first! Liu secretly clenched her teeth. She asked for the silver. How did she get into her mother-in-law's pocket?Wu's face looked much better after he received the money: \"what do you want to ask, ask!\"\"How old is the child? Is it a girl? \"\"Fourteen! GirlThis time, Huang Zhong's eyes brightened: \"how many months?\"This can put Wu asked, a money loser little fool, who would bother to remember her birthday.Liu said: \"I know! Born in OctoberShe was just pregnant with Gu Xiaoshun that month, so she was very impressed.Unexpectedly, even the month is on, Huang Zhong's heart began to be excited: \"what's the date?\"\"Seventeen or eighteen?\" Liu can't remember clearly. It seems that no one will remember Gu Jiao's birthday except Gu Xiaoshun.The twins were born on the 18th. These clues are very close.Huang Zhong continued to ask: \"in which temple was he born?\"Liu pointed to the way: \"on the other side of the mountain temple ah, which one?\"At this time, Gu Changlu came out with a hoe.Liu waved to him: \"Er Shun, his father, was Jiao Niang born on the 18th or the 17th?\"\"Eighteen, what's the matter?\" Gu Changlu said, looking at the man and the carriage in front of the door strangely.Huang Zhong is so excited that everything is right. It should be right. I didn't expect that the child who didn't hope at all was the one they were looking for!Gu Long Lu came into Wu and Liu's side, at this time, Zhou also came out to watch the excitement.Only Gu Yuee was timid, hiding in the back door of the main room and peering over here.Huang Zhong's excitement was already a little hard to hide. Gu Chang looked him up and down, and asked Liu Shi, \"why did you suddenly ask about jiaoniang?\"Liu pulled Gu Changlu aside, pointed to Wu's pocket, and whispered: \"he came to inquire about jiaoniang's news and gave her a ingot of silver, which was taken away by her!\"Gu Changlu stares at Liu, dissatisfied with Liu's use of this tone to complain about his mother, but Wu's approach he does not quite agree with.He went to Wu's side and said, \"Niang, we can't accept this silver.\"Wu tugged the purse tightly: \"why can't I take it?\"Gu Changlu took a look at Huang Zhong and said, \"I don't know who he is. What does she do? What if he's a bad guy, and he's plotting against her? \"Wu is not happy to hear this. Does the little disaster star do her shit? Dead clean, save harm to the whole family!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: 74Huang Zhong said, \"don't worry. I'm not a villain. This may be a bit abrupt. I wonder if I can meet my concubine? \"\"No way.\" Gu Changlu refused without thinking about it.The other party won't even let him see him. How can he take people to the town for the Marquis to see? He can't knock the whole family out. Why don't you tie that child?Besides, he doesn't even know who the child is now!Huang Zhong thinks that it's very likely that the other party is his own young lady. In this case, it's not easy for him to offend the young lady's adoptive parents.He slowed down and said, \"where is the child's parents, please? I have something to say to them. \"Wu said: \"her parents passed away. I was her nurse. I raised her! What do you want to tell me? \"Did you have no parents since childhood? Huang Zhong's mood suddenly became complicated. He thought about it and asked, \"can you come in and talk?\"Wu brought Huang Zhong into the house.Huang Zhong asked about the details of the production, especially why Xu went up the mountain with a big stomach.It turns out that Xu's family is not from this village. She is married far away. Her mother's family came and wrote that her father was dying. She was asked to find a way to go home.With Xu's body in mind, her mother-in-law naturally did not allow her to go far away, but she wanted to go to the temple to ask for Bodhisattva.She went without telling her mother-in-law that she was going to pick some wild vegetables so that she could be back before dark. Who had thought of a thunderstorm, she was trapped in the temple and slipped.Mrs. Hou's premature birth was caused by twins, but her premature birth was an accident.At first, Gu didn't know that she had gone to the temple. It was raining so hard that she didn't come back. Gu Sanlang wanted to find his daughter-in-law, but he was held down by his two brothers.It's not fatal to enter the forest in a thunderstorm!Xu came back two days later. When she came back, the child had already been born. She was a girl with a red spot on her face. She was not as ugly as Gu Sanlang.Gu Sanlang is famous for his good appearance. Many people from all corners of the country rushed to be his daughter-in-law, and finally chose Xu. The main reason is that Xu has a lot of dowries.Wu once doubted whether Xu had fallen the child into the mountain. For fear that his family would blame him, he picked up a child and brought it back.Xu is an honest man. She said that she gave birth to the baby in the temple. If you don't believe it, you can ask the abbot in the temple.Wu and his second daughter-in-law Liu really went to ask, and determined that Xu gave birth to a baby in the temple. The baby was born alive, and the whole temple heard the cry.\"Not picked up?\" Wu asked at that time.The monk all laughed: \"do you know who was the other benefactor who gave birth here that night? It's a noble man in the capital. Who can pick up her children? \"Wu was silent for a moment.Noble child, it is more noble than gold. Let alone pick it up, you can't steal it.Hearing this, Huang Zhong has been able to completely confirm that Xu's child is the person he is looking for.But it seems that Xu didn't know he was wrong.\"It's a coincidence that it's also Gu.\" Huang Zhong suddenly had a sense of fatalism. He quickly asked, \"do Xu and Sanlang love that child?\"What the hell is that? Xu and Gu just didn't tie the child to his belt!This is also the dissatisfaction of Wu family. Xu's hen, who doesn't lay eggs, dominates such a good husband as Sanlang, but can't give birth to one with a handle.Finally gave birth to a girl, not only ugly, but also silly.Silly is later grew up to find that other children can jump, she can't even walk, three years old just called Niang.But the couple didn't dislike it at all, and they were in pain for the child.Gu jiaoniang's hard life began after the couple's death.Of course, Wu didn't say that.Huang Zhong had so many clues to digest that he didn't notice Wu's desire for words.He looked at Wu's family and said: \"to tell you the truth, the lady who gave birth in the temple was my wife, two children... Maybe I had the wrong baby.\"Wu's several people were shocked.\"I... I didn't quite understand. Say it again.\" Wu stammered.Huang Zhong laughed and said, \"Saburo's daughter is my miss.\"Wu opened his mouth: \"your family is...\"Huang Zhong said mildly: \"Ding'an Marquis's residence.\"Boom!All the people in the room were thunderstruck.They didn't understand, but they understood the last two words.Houfu!That dead wench is actually Hou Fu's?\"Is the Marquis and the Marquis's office bigger than the county magistrate's?\" Liu asked cautiously.Houfu is not an official, but a mansion. Houye is an official. But Huang Zhong understood what Liu meant. Huang Zhong said with a smile, \"that's natural.\"Huang Zhong didn't say how much more, and they didn't understand.Those who dare to ask in the capital may have been crushed to death by the marquis.Compare him with a bullshit county magistrate. Who do you look down on?Huang Zhong is more polite to the family members. After all, the family raised their young lady. He said with a pleasant face, \"my Lord is in the town. Can I take the child to meet my lord?\"These people have been completely scared silly, even can't say words, one is surprised, didn't expect that girl's life experience is so terrible; Second, they have bullied that girl all these years. Let the Lord know that they are so mean to his own daughter. Will they take them to the Yamen one by one?At the moment when a room full of people are at sixes and sevens, Gu Changhai comes home.He first found the carriage outside the door, and then saw a room full of frightened birds.He glanced at Huang Zhong, who was very powerful. He frowned and asked Wu, \"mother, what's the matter?\"\"Where's your father?\" Wu looked behind him.Gu Changhai said, \"my father has gone to my uncle. Let me come back first.\"\"That...\" Wu didn't know how to tell his son.Huang Zhong gave an understanding smile: \"in this way, I'll ask someone to report a letter to Hou ye first. You can discuss how to tell her. If it's absolutely inconvenient for you to say it, I'll do it.\"When such a big thing happened, it would take time for people to digest the emotion and reason, but it must not be delayed too long. He must see the child anyway today.After Huang Zhong goes out, his mother-in-law and daughter-in-law tell Gu Jiao's life experience with fear.Although Gu Changhai is an old man, his reaction is no better than that of the three women. His whole face is white and his legs are weak.If they are nice to Gu Jiao, they will be happy to hear the news. The key is that they don't treat Gu Jiao as a person at all!Without her, she is responsible for all the heavy and dirty work, such as cutting pig grass, feeding pig food and picking pig dung. That is to say, she is stupid and always can't do it well, so she is not allowed to do it.But beating and scolding were still common, and when she was less than 14 years old, they forced her to marry a lame man and drove them out to live alone.If you let the Marquis know about this, do they still have a way to live?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: 75\"Dashun's father, what should we do?\" Zhou was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. He asked Gu who was the worst to Gu Jiao, either Wu or her.Of course, Liu is not a good bird, but Gu Xiaoshun took half of his anger away from Liu. Liu beat Gu Xiaoshun the most fiercely.There is a saying that \"anger starts from the heart, evil comes from the edge of courage\". People are extremely angry and can do anything. Similarly, people are scared to the extreme and can do anything to protect themselves.Gu Changhai now made a bold decision: \"let yue'e go.\"\"What?\" Zhou was stunned.Wu and Gu Changlu were also stunned.Did they hear it wrong? Do you want to replace your daughter?\"Big brother, I can't use it!\" Gu Changlu was the first to object.Apart from the guilt of Sanfang, he was too timid to do such a powerful thing.Liu is not happy either. It's not her daughter who is going to be the Marquis's daughter. Instead of enjoying happiness, she follows Dafang and refuses!Wu and Zhou didn't say a word. One of them was Gu Yuee's milk, the other was Gu Yuee's mother. They could benefit directly from it.And they have a lot of guts.Gu Changhai began to persuade Er Fang: \"Er Di, er Di Mei, don't you think about yourself, don't you think about Er Shun? Ershun is also a very clever child, but Dashun was born in front of him and went to school first. The family couldn't provide for the two children, so Ershun was delayed. Yue'e went to Hou's house. I will let her take Er Shun to the capital to study! With ER Shun's cleverness, can he not read a famous book? \"This is said to Liu's heart.Liu's dream wants to touch the light of Er Shun, she also firmly believes that Er Shun is able to stand out, but the opportunity is taken by Gu Dashun!Gu Changhai said: \"the third brother's child is not close to us. We can't count on her, and we can't be sure that the child will be sent back by Houfu! You can't expect the Marquis's house to compensate us for a sum of money. They have raised their daughter for their third brother. They don't owe each other! If we really owe them, we owe them! How much does the Hou family spend on the third younger brother and daughter every year, and how much do we spend on the concubine every year? Really, do we have to lose money for them? \"Hearing the loss, the second room's face changed.Gu Changhai then said: \"but as long as yue'e goes there and says more good things for us, can Hou Fu not follow her? Yue'e is what you grow up with. Don't you understand her temperament? I love her two aunts the mostLiu's waist is straight.Gu yue'e and Liu's relationship is not very close, but Gu yue'e is obedient, industrious and soft tempered. Liu does not hate her, and she has never had a red face with Liu.Zhou said: \"yes, she likes the second aunt best! Also said that the second aunt looks good! Better than meIn the past, Zhou won't admit that Liu is better looking than himself, but now is not to coax Liu?Liu's success was coaxed to, embarrassed to smile: \"month e that child who does not like?\"After Liu's success, Gu Changhai turned his head and looked at Gu Changlu: 'second brother, I know you don't like farming and you like doing business. When yue'e goes to Hou's house and asks her to buy you the best shop in the town, you can sell anything you want!\"Gu Changlu was speechless all of a sudden.He is worthy of Sanfang, but... He really wants to have his own business.\"Dad there...\" Liu said weakly.Gu Changhai is very familiar with the old man's character. His love for Gu Jiao is true, and his preference for boys over girls is not false. But if you really let him do such a bad thing, he may not be able to do it.\"I'll tell him later.\"Liu Shi curled his lips and said, \"well, don't talk about us!\"Gu Changhai grinned: \"don't worry, second younger brother and sister, it's my idea. If the old man wants to scold me, just scold me.\"\"Will the Marquis's office doubt it?\" Gu Changlu asked suddenly.Gu Changhai said with a smile: \"how can it be? Who could have guessed that we had so much courage? What's more, the man came to take care of his family after asking in the village. He won't ask again. \"Zhou said, \"how about blood? I heard that there is such a thingGu Changhai said with a deeper smile: \"that's easier. Yue'e and her third brother's daughter are blood relatives. At that time, let yue'e think of a way to change the blood from the other side of Hou's house into the blood of her third brother's daughter. Naturally, she can hide it from the world.\"The whole family decided Gu Jiao and Gu Yuee's life just like they had decided Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG. They never thought that the two parties would agree.Gu yue'e cried and didn't want to be a daughter for others. Zhou and Liu tried to persuade her not to listen. Gu Changhai slapped her down and she was honest.Zhou changed her daughter's decent clothes. Liu took out the jewelry at the bottom of the box that Xu had for herself and put it on Gu yue'e.Just now Gu Changhai slapped Gu Yuee's head. There was no trace on her face, but she cried and her eyes were red and swollen.In this regard, Gu's explanation is that the little girl can't accept the fact and is a little sad.Huang Zhong feels that this is human nature. It's not as good to be born as to be raised. After all these years, it's time to be raised.But Huang Zhong didn't expect that the little girl who opened the door for him was his own. Just now, she was even more shabby and timid, and she was full of family spirit.Huang Zhong thought of Gu Jinyu again and sighed.Gu Yuee has been in tears.Huang Zhong couldn't bear to say, \"Lord Hou doesn't want to take you back immediately. He came here today to see you first. If you really don't want to...\"Wu said hastily, \"nothing! A family reunion should be! What's the point? The Marquis is her fatherHuang Zhong opened the curtain of the carriage himself: \"Miss, please get on the carriage.\"Gu Yuee did not move, Wu urged: \"go, Yue... Cough, jiaoniang.\"Zhou and Liu helped Gu Yuee into the carriage.It is estimated that Gu Yuee was most valued by her family since she was born. The whole family took her as a Bodhisattva, but Gu Yuee was not happy.She doesn't want to go to a strange place or leave home.Where does the family care about Gu Yuee's life and death, they all begin to have their own spring and autumn dream.Gu Changhai urged: \"it's getting late, go early and return early.\"If you don't leave again, the old man should come back, so Gu Yuee can't leave.Several people did not expect that Huang Zhong and Gu Yuee did not meet the old man, but met Gu Xiaoshun who came back from the academy!Gu Xiaoshun wandered back, throwing his bag as he walked.Gu Changhai eyebrows a jump: 'small Shun how so early back?\"Xiao LIULANG went to kaofu, the provincial capital, to try. Gu Xiaoshun didn't have to ride in Uncle Luo's ox cart alone. He walked back by himself. His foot was much faster than the ox cart!At this time, Huang Zhong's carriage was almost out of the village. Zhou said, \"it's OK. He can't see it.\"Gu yue'e is sitting on the carriage. Can Gu Xiaoshun still lift the curtain with his hands?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: 76I'm afraid the family members forget that Gu Xiaoshun is from humble to big.For this reason, I have been beaten by Liu since I was a child.When the carriage passed by Gu Xiaoshun, Gu Xiaoshun said, \"eh? Gu YueeGu Yuee is only two months younger than Gu Jiao. She is also Gu Xiaoshun's elder sister, but Gu Xiaoshun never calls her by her name.Gu yue'e was immediately flustered.Although she didn't want to leave home, she was more afraid of being beaten by her father when she failed.Huang Zhong stops the carriage.He jumped out of the carriage and came to Gu Xiaoshun. Gu Xiaoshun grabbed the curtain of the car window in his hand and asked coldly, \"where's the boy from?\"Gu Xiaoshun was dressed in the uniform of Tianxiang academy, but every hair on his body seemed to write something improper.After studying too much, it seems that people forget that he is the first bully in all the villages.Just now he saw Gu Yuee crying in the carriage.There was a bad guess in his heart. Gu Yuee was old enough to be married. His family was worried about Gu Yuee's marriage. The poor family didn't like Gu Yuee, and the good family couldn't.This bad old man is not going to buy Gu Yuee to be a little girl, is he?Gu Xiaoshun's bad temper came up: \"even if you don't know your grandfather Xiaoshun, do you dare to come and rob people? Yuee, get out of the carGu Yuee didn't move.Gu Xiaoshun step on the carriage, will Gu Yuee to drag down.Huang Zhong is a martial arts practitioner. He grabbed Gu Xiaoshun's arm and said coldly, \"boy, you have something to say.\"Gu Xiaoshun said angrily, \"how much money did my uncle ask you? Sell all your daughters? \"\"What, your uncle's daughter? This is Gu's daughter, Gu jiaoniang! Wait, are you a family man? \" Huang Zhong was suddenly stunned, as if something was wrong.At this time, Gu Changhai, Zhou and Liu came breathlessly.Gu Changhai said: \"Xiaoshun! Come hereGu Xiaoshun didn't look at Gu Changhai. Instead, he looked at Huang Zhong strangely. He opened the curtain with one hand and pointed to Gu Yuee with the other: \"are you stupid? I don't know my sister, do you? Open your eyes and see clearly, Gu Yuee, the daughter of the familyThe streets of the town are flowing with the wind and the sun.Marquis Gu was sitting in the wing room on the second floor of the tea shop, tasting tea and listening to the driver's report.The window beside him is wide open, and the sunshine and noise come together. Different from the bustle of the capital, the bustle of the town is a bit more local.\"... when I went to the village, the family name was Gu.\" Said the coachman.It matters a lot. Marquis Gu uses people he can trust, and the coachman is no exception.The coachman gave a full account of what he had heard from Gu's family.When he heard that the other person's surname was Gu, marquis Gu's reaction was not very big, but when he heard that the child was indeed the wrong baby girl, marquis Gu's Cup clattered on the table.The coachman was frightened: \"Hou, Hou ye, are you ok?\"He found his long lost child. He thought he would be calm, but he was a little nervous.\"Where are the people?\" he askedThe coachman said, \"I'm on my way. Bodyguard Huang asked me to give you a message in advance. He'll take you there in a moment.\"Marquis Gu's heart was a little excited. He straightened his skirt and asked the coachman, \"is it OK for me to look at it?\"The coachman was stunned. You are not looking at each other.Marquis Gu lowered his face: \"I asked you, but it would frighten the child!\"The coachman trembled!Marquis Gu took a deep breath and lowered his fierce expression.In fact, there is nothing to worry about. Jinyu likes him very much, and the child will like him.The main reason was that he was afraid that he would scare the child away if he was too powerful.Time seemed to slow down suddenly. Marquis Gu couldn't sit upstairs any more. He simply got up and went downstairs.As soon as he got out of the tea shop, he ran into a small glutinous rice ball with a snack.Xiaotuanzi fell on the ground face down with a whoop, and a box of snacks in his hand fell out and rolled a drop.Xiaotuanzi was stunned when he saw that the dim sum he bought was gone.\"What's the matter, clearance?\"Gu Jiao bought a sugar gourd not far away and saw the little guy lying on the ground with his face covered in circles. She hurriedly came forward and picked him up.Xiaojingkong looks at Gu Jiao and the osmanthus cake scattered all over the place. Her mouth is shriveled and her eyes are full of tears: \"the osmanthus cake and osmanthus cake are gone...\"Today is xiaojingkong's first visit to the town. It's the first time that she has met so many people, and it's also the first time that she has queued up to buy osmanthus cake.He cherished it. He didn't want to eat any of them. As a result, he lost them.Gu Jiao looked at the sweet scented osmanthus cake on the ground and asked Xiao Jingkong, \"does it hurt? Is there any injury? \"Xiaojingkong covered his heart and said, \"I'm hurt here.\"Gu JiaoThis is Li Ji's sweet scented osmanthus cake. They waited most of the time to buy it. The little guy was sad.But do you want to play so much? Did you give it to the show?Gu Jiao took a handkerchief and wiped his little hand clean: \"be careful next time.\"\"I'm very careful. It's not my fault. He hit me!\" Xiao Jingkong finished, raised his hand and pointed to Marquis Gu, who was neither walking nor staying.Strictly speaking, he was in a hurry. Xiaojingkong didn't move at that time, so he waited for Gujiao to buy him sugar gourd with snacks under the eaves.It's just that Marquis Gu didn't mean to. He didn't see the small clearance.When he plans to ask someone to lift the small clearance, Gu Jiao appears.Why is there such a girl everywhere? Marquis Gu was surprised.Gu Jiao coldly looks at Marquis Gu. Marquis Gu is a little guilty by her sharp eyes, but it is impossible for him to admit his mistake to a child.He coughed and said, \"who let him get in the way? Why don't you take care of people when you say you bring a child out? Well, I'm in a good mood today. I'll spare you. A hundred boxes of sweet scented osmanthus cakes are enough for this little silver! \"After that, he took out a ingot and threw it on the ground in front of them.Ordinary people kowtow to appreciate so much silver, but Gu Jiao and Xiao Jingkong didn't move.Marquis Gu swept coldly: \"Oh, it's up to you!\"After that, he left with great strides.His clothes are either rich or expensive, so no one dares to speak for Gu Jiao.However, just as he passed Gu Jiao, Gu Jiao gently stretched out her foot and tripped him.He jumped out of the room and fell on the spot!He is instantly angry, turn a head to stare fiercely to Gu Jiao: 'smelly wench, you seek to die?\"Gu Jiao returned his words to him intact: \"who let you get in the way?\"Gu Jiao made a trip and turned away with little clearance.Marquis Gu was really angry this time. It happened that the county magistrate passed by with the governor.In his anger, marquis Gu let the county magistrate arrest him!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: 77As soon as the county master left, Huang Zhong arrived.\"Lord! Marquis\"Why are you alone? And the child? \"\"I almost fell for it! It's not Gu's! \" Huang Zhong told the story of Gu's family and Li daitaojiang, \"fortunately I met Xiaoshun brothers, otherwise I'll make a mistake!\"Marquis Gu is very angry. Good. These people don't want to live! Deal with them later!\"If I ask you, are you deaf?\" Marquis Gu stares at Huang Zhong.Huang Zhong turned his lips. At first, he was still hesitating whether to recognize people? Are you in such a hurry now?Huang Zhong took out a lifelike wood carving from his arms: \"it was given by Xiaoshun brothers, saying that this is miss!\"The last wood carving was given to the old mother of the dean. Later, Gu Xiaoshun carved a new one, but he didn't have time to give it to Gu Jiao.Huang Zhong had a heart this time, but he didn't tell Gu Xiaoshun the truth. He just said that his master had received his sister's favor and wanted to ask her to go to the town to thank him.Gu Xiaoshun was afraid that they would thank the wrong person again, so he gave the wood carving to him.Marquis Gu thinks the wood carvings look familiar.\"There's something missing.\" Huang Zhong touched it in his arms again, and found a small piece of dough, which was pasted on the left face of the woodcarving. \"Xiaoshun brother said that there was a red birthmark on the young lady's face.\"Red birthmarkMarquis Gu finally knows where the woodcarving looks familiar. Isn't this the smelly girl he just ordered to take away?\"Are you mistaken?\" Marquis Gu frowned.\"There's nothing wrong this time!\" In order to verify the authenticity, Huang Zhong went to the people in the village to verify that he was the real child who cared for the family!Marquis Gu only felt a few days of thunder on his head, the whole person began to crumble.Huang Zhong noticed the difference of his Marquis and asked anxiously, \"what's the matter with you, marquis? You don't dislike miss's looks, do you? Brother Xiaoshun said, \"although there is a birthmark, it's not ugly at all!\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and immortality is in the eye of the younger brother. Gu Xiaoshun never thought it was difficult for his elder sister to see it.Huang Zhong is talking to Marquis Gu. The next second, marquis Gu is gone!Marquis Gu naturally went after Gu Jiao. He didn't expect that the smelly girl was the child he was looking for!It's overHe sent people to prison with his own hands!I don't know if I'll come back. I'm afraid it's hard to ask her for blood as a drug guide at that time!When Marquis Gu arrived at the county government, the county magistrate and his party had just arrived.Just now, he was clear about his identity and asked the county magistrate to obey his orders. When the county magistrate saw him, he hurried forward to salute him. Unexpectedly, marquis Gu didn't even look at him and went to the carriage where Gu Jiao and his wife were imprisoned.Something unexpected happened. The carriage was empty and there was no one in it!Gu Hou Ye Mou son a stare: \"person?\"The county master is also silly. Yes, what about people? I saw her and the child get into the carriage with my own eyes. They didn't stop all the way. Why did they disappear?Is that girl still a hiding master?The county magistrate pinched a cold sweat and said, \"I'm sorry for my dereliction of duty. I'll send someone to take her back! Great punishment! How dare she escapeJust nine grade sesame officials, dare to serve the blood of the Marquis? Marquis Gu immediately said, \"officer dog! Two kids, too! And the punishment! Why don't you go to heavenThe county magistrate said, \"didn't you let me arrest you?\"Marquis Gu kicked in the past: \"if I want you to catch me, will you catch me? Who is the official? What do you want to do if you don't plead for the people, don't stand out for the people, and only know how to curry favor with others? \"County Master in the windTwilight four, the last touch of setting sun disappeared in the sky, the sky gray, half dark unknown.Gu Jiao, holding xiaojingkong's hand, walks leisurely on the quiet street.Although there is no sweet scented osmanthus cake, there is still sugar gourd.Xiaojingkong is small, but he is brave. Just now a series of things didn't cause him any fright. He licked the sugar gourd one by one. He licked it very seriously!Gu Jiao pause, or can't help but ask him: \"afraid?\"\"Well?\" Xiao Jingkong licked the sugar gourd and opened his big eyes to Gu Jiao. After a while, he realized, \"I'm not afraid!\"He said so.Gu Jiao gave a hum.I'm not afraid.Gu Jiao's first lesson is the way to survive. She doesn't care too much about good people but not good people. However, with little clearance, she seems to care more and more.Prison break or something, it seems not good for children to learn.Gu Jiao is thinking about how to educate xiaojingkong. She sees xiaojingkong shaking her hand: \"Jiaojiao, you are very powerful!\"\"Well.\" Gu Jiao only thinks that he is talking about children.Small clearance: \"I also want to become very powerful! Better than Jiaojiao! You don't have to be so cute! \"\"Well?\" Gu Jiao stopped and looked at him.Xiaojingkong raised his head and looked into Gu Jiao's eyes without any impurities: \"is Jiao Jiao very hard? The master said, \"the most powerful people have suffered a lot, and they will continue to suffer a lot in the future.\"In fact, he doesn't understand why people have to suffer when they become worse. Master said, because the powerful people are destined to go up the mountain, the people who go up the mountain are hard, and it's comfortable to go down the mountain.This is the first time that someone has asked Gu Jiaoxin if she works hard.She entered the organization at the age of eight, whipping, electric shock, torture... Almost trained to shock every day. Only people care if she can take the next task, but no one cares if she works hard.Gu Jiao didn't know how to answer for a moment.Xiaojingkong thought of what happened just now, and lowered her head in a low mood: \"do I... Make Jiaojiao feel hard?\"Gu Jiao did not expect that he would say so, Gu Jiao touched his little bald head: \"no, it's not hard to raise a little headroom.\"\"Really?\" Xiaojingkong looks at her.Gu Jiao saw a trace of hesitation from the bottom of his eyes. This heartless little guy is actually more vulnerable than anyone else.Gu Jiao nodded firmly: \"well, really.\"Xiaojingkong once again had a smile in his eyes. He patted his chest and vowed, \"Jiaojiao, when I grow up, I will carry you up the mountain!\"If all the powerful people have to go up the mountain, he will go up the mountain with Jiaojiao on his back!Jiaojiao doesn't have to walk. He will eat Jiaojiao's pain!Gu Jiao didn't understand what went up and down the mountain, but she felt the little guy's concern.She crouched down and gently scraped the tip of his little nose.At this time, Gu Jiao did not know that the oath made by someone at the age of three and a half really did it when she grew up.This cute little glutinous rice ball one day turned out to be such a majestic general that no one in the six countries or the whole world dared to make her suffer.Back in the village, xiaojingkong was already asleep, lying in Gu Jiao's arms, drooling.There is a carriage at the entrance of the village. Gu Jiao doesn't care. However, when she comes near, she finds a man standing beside the carriage.It's no one else. It's Marquis Gu who ordered her and Xiao Jingkong to go to prison.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: 78There was no one beside him except Huang Zhong, the bodyguard.Gu Jiao ruled out the possibility that he was coming to catch her.But if it's not for her, why are you here?Gu Jiao doesn't like the Marquis who looks at the common people like ants. She hugs the little clearance in her arms and looks at him warily.If he dares to do something to hurt them, she doesn't mind killing him here.Marquis Gu saw Gu Jiao's hostility, coughed lightly, and said: \"I'm not here to catch you, I don't have any malice.\"Gu Jiao did not care about this stubble, is still alert and alert to look at him.Marquis Gu's mood is very complicated. On the one hand, he can't digest the girl who has ruined himself over and over again. On the other hand, he can't look back on their relationship.But anyway, since we're here, we have to make it clear.Marquis Gu winked at Huang Zhong, and Huang Zhong gave up.Lord Gu brushed his sleeves and said, \"my name is Gu. I'm Marquis Ding'an of Wenquan villa.\"Gu Jiao actually guessed his identity very early. When she first met him, Gu Jinyu was sitting in his carriage.She recognized Gu Jinyu's voice.It seems unlikely that there will be a second person who can sit in Gu Jinyu's carriage and call himself marquis.Later, she met him in the woods. She looked at his face closely. It was very similar to Gu Yan's face. If it wasn't Gu Yan's father, she would not believe it.But he didn't say it all the time, and Gu Jiao didn't point it out.Marquis Gu: \"what happened today...\"Gu Jiao interrupted him: \"if you are here to apologize, no need, I don't care.\"Marquis Gu's eyes glared: \"no, i... how do you speak? Is there such a small one as you? \"He came with a trace of guilt. Yes, but he is the marquis. How can he apologize to a girl!Don't she know that there are no parents in the world?Her parents didn'tWell, he and Yao really didn't teach her.Gu Sanlang and Xu left early, but they didn't have time to teach her.It's said that she used to be a fool, but recently she got better.Thinking of this, marquis Gu felt that he could be more tolerant to her.He pressed down the tumbling anger and said to her, \"I've come to you for something to tell you. Maybe you don't believe it, but you... And me... We...\"Well, why can't you say it?Marquis Gu was worried.\"Me and you what?\" Ren Gujiao racked her brains and couldn't think of any relationship between this man and herself, but she had lived for two lives, and had never seen any wonderful flowers. \"You don't have any quirks, do you like me?\"Although she looks disabled, but she is small, some men taste is so heavy mouth.Marquis Gu faltered and almost didn't fall into the well in front of him!What does this girl think of him as? Is there anyone who slanders his own father like this?\"Do you know who I am? I'm you -- \"\u2026\u2026A quarter of an hour later, marquis Gu limped back to the carriage.Huang Zhong came over and was stunned: \"Mr. Hou, have you been beaten? You're not going to be beaten up by a young lady, are you? Can't you even beat miss? \"\"I don't care about her!\" growled Marquis GuI don't admit that I can't beat her!This is too miserable. Huang Zhong can't bear to look directly at him. He has been following the Marquis for more than ten years and has never seen him so embarrassed.Huang Zhong asked, \"Miss, is she so heavy? Didn't you tell her you were her father? \"At the mention of this, marquis Gu was even more furious: \"why didn't you tell me?\"Huang Zhong didn't understand: \"what did you say?\"Marquis Gu was indignant and said, \"I said I was her Laozi! She said I scolded her and then beat me up! \"It's a terrible beating!Marquis Gu has never been wronged since he was young!Huang Zhong: why don't you say you are her uncle? Is father a hot word or something?--Gu Jiao beat up and went home with her sleeping little clearance.Xiao LIULANG is not here. He will go to the provincial capital for an exam and will come back next month.All of a sudden, one person is missing, and the room seems to be quiet.In fact, Xiao LIULANG was very quiet at home. Most of the time, he stayed in his own room. However, when Gu Jiao opened the door of Westinghouse, she couldn't see the boy studying at his desk, and suddenly she was not used to it.Gu Jiao will be small clearance on the bed, pull over the quilt to cover him.Then she went to the kitchen and cooked dinner.Xiaojingkong was full in the town, but Gu Jiao didn't wake him up. She sat in the main room with the old lady for dinner.Gu Jiao asked, \"eh? Xiaoshun didn't come? \"Gu Xiaoshun reviews his old house after dinner every night.\"He said to stay in the Academy for a while.\" Said the old lady, adding a piece of braised pork.Without LIULANG and xiaohanhan, the braised meat is not fragrant!Gu Jiao asked curiously, \"why did he suddenly go to live in the academy?\"The old lady said, \"I don't know. He's in a hurry.\"Gu Xiaoshun spoiled Gu's good deeds. Gu Changhai and his wife and Liu wanted to kill him. In order to escape, he stayed in the Academy overnight.The Academy doesn't allow outsiders to enter. The only one who can enter is Gu Dashun. If Gu Dashun has the ability, he can't beat him!\"I'll send him some silver tomorrow.\" Gu Jiao is worried that Gu Xiaoshun will have no money to eat.\"I did.\" Said the old lady.\"Where did you get the silver?\" Gu Jiao asked.When she first came to the house, the old lady was very down-to-earth. She had nothing to do with silver.During the Spring Festival, Gu Jiao gave her a big red envelope, but it was a silver note.The old lady snorted, \"I told people in vain?\"Gu Jiao is stunned. How dare you develop a sideline at home?The old lady said, \"and your medicine. Anyway, you don't want it. I'll sell it all.\"Gu Jiao asked curiously, \"what medicine?\"The old lady said, \"golden sore medicine! You've been making trouble at home for days, when I didn't know! \"Gu Jiao: \"Oh, you know.\"She makes medicine in the daytime. Xiao LIULANG is not at home. Although the old lady is there, she didn't think that she would know the drug, so she didn't avoid the old lady.She has a high demand for drugs. She has made more than ten bottles, leaving only three of the most effective.She didn't care if the rest of the cans were gone. She just thought that the old lady had thrown them away. Who expected that the old lady had sold them privately?Gu Jiao heard her tone like an old hand: \"have you ever done such a thing before?\"\"You said selling medicine, well, maybe! But I don't think I'm selling acne medicine. \" The old lady thought seriously, and put out a name from the few memories, \"it seems to be an aphrodisiac.\"Gu JiaoAccording to later records, virtuous empress once sold aphrodisiac to concubines, and accepted bribes to control the green card.After the virtuous words: \"do not talk about feelings with the palace, the emperor, the high price sleep!\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: 79After dinner, Gu Jiao cleaned up the house, went to Westinghouse to give Xiao Jingkong a quilt, and then went back to her room to sleep.Two months have passed since she last dreamed, and Gu Jiao never dreamed again.But that night, she had a dream again.But what she dreams about is not Xiao LIULANG, but herself.She dreamt that she had become the daughter of Gu's family, met Gu Jinyu of Wenquan villa, and went back to the capital with Gu Jinyu.She lived in Diaolianghuadong's house. Every day, more than a dozen servants were waiting on her, and her family members were not masked.People respectfully called her Miss Gu, but it didn't last long.Gu Jinyu is beautiful, quiet and elegant, knowledgeable, and has an extraordinary conversation.On the other hand, she has a rudimentary face, rude manners, can't read a big word, and is clumsy in speaking.In Gu Jinyu's strong contrast, she became a complete joke.Everyone is saying that Gu's family brought back a country girl.The servants began to laugh at her, and the daughters began to alienate her. Even the family who once loved her didn't seem to know how to face her.In order to retrieve the things that should belong to her, she did some bad things at the instigation of someone who had a heart, which led to the disappointment of all people.Finally, she was sent to biezhuang outside the capital. She was depressed and heartbroken every day, and finally died in a cold winter.Gu Jiao wakes up and wonders why she has such a dream.When she dreams about things related to Xiao LIULANG, she knows that those things will happen, but they are not on her own.For nothing else, just because the 'she\" in the dream is not her at all.She was not ignorant or clumsy.She doesn't care what others think of her, she doesn't envy Gu Jinyu, she doesn't get instigated, and she doesn't use those mentally retarded tricks against Gu Jinyu.She really wants to kill someone. She'll do it cleaner than wiping the floor.As for being heartbroken if you don't get the love of your family, that's all the more ridiculous.So, why did she have such a wild dream? Are you out of your mind?On the other hand, Xiao LIULANG and Feng Lin's carriage finally arrived at Pingcheng, the city of Fu, after several days of long journey.They didn't come early. The Inns on the edge of the examination room were full. They chose the Inns one street apart.Two taels of silver for a room, it's like asking for a lot of money.But there is no way, who let the candidates wait? I have to pay for it.When the government test was over, Xiao LIULANG only did it for half an hour and went to bed.Can you... Stop being so desperate? How simple the essay is! Can't even write this? How did you get on the desk in the county examination? You this session of examinee is so immovable?!The last one is the eight part essay, which has been tested for two days, which shows the difficulty.This time, in particular, Zhuang Cishi, who came from the capital, put forward the topic in person. Zhuang Cishi picked two sentences from the Analects of Confucius, which were different from each other: poor but not flattering, rich but not arrogant, sensitive but cautious, and asked the candidates to join them together to solve the topic.However, a quarter of an hour, there are two candidates too much pressure down.They were carried out and the exam was cancelled.Invigilator secretly scolded the bastard. Why don't you give me such a difficult question!He thought Xiao LIULANG would give up going to bed in less than half an hour this time. Unexpectedly, he just sat there.\"Poor but not flattering, rich but not arrogant, quick but cautious in speech.\" why did Mr. Zhuang assign such a difficult assignment? Ah Heng, do it for meThe girl's bright smile flashed through my mind, just like yesterday.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: 80At dusk on the fourth day, the examination was over.Feng Lin stayed here early in the morning for a whole day, and other candidates came out one after another. Only Xiao LIULANG didn't see anyone. He couldn't help worrying.Just hesitating whether to ask the people inside, Xiao LIULANG came out coldly.Feng Lin rushed to meet him. He found that he didn't look well, so he asked, \"what's the matter? Is there something wrong? Or did you not do well in the exam? \"\"Nothing.\" Xiao LIULANG said lightly.Feng Lin heard that his voice was sound, it should not be a physical problem, relieved: \"I just heard the examinees say that this test is particularly difficult, you don't lose heart, maybe they don't do as well as you do!\"\"Go back to the inn.\" Xiao LIULANG said and turned to the direction of the inn.Feng Lin wants to talk but stops.It seems that he has never seen Xiao LIULANG like this. Although he has always been very cold, he will not be so cold that he dare not get close to him. His whole body is filled with a chilling anger, as if he is going to do something terrible next second.\"LIULANG, LIULANG, wait for me!\"Feng Lin was afraid to return, but he still gritted his teeth to catch up.Now he doesn't call him brother Xiao. Originally, he is older than Xiao LIULANG. He is called brother Xiao because Xiao LIULANG saved him.But they had a good friendship together on New Year's Eve. If you call brother Xiao again, you will be unfamiliar!Xiao LIULANG walked faster than Feng Lin with his crutch. Feng Lin soon caught up with him.They went back to the inn together.When passing a tea shop, two middle-aged men in splendid clothes came out of the tea shop. One of them glanced at Xiao LIULANG. At first did not care, for a moment like suddenly aware of what, Shua turned his head toward Xiao LIULANG looked in the past.At this time, Xiao LIULANG had crossed the street with Feng Lin and went to the inn opposite.His eyes have been chasing Xiao LIULANG's back, until he completely disappeared in the corner.\"Mr. Zhuang, what's the matter with you? Did you see any acquaintances? Would you like me to say hello? \"The questioner is the prefect of Pingcheng, surnamed Luo.Zhuang Xianzhi shook his head: \"no, I'm not an acquaintance of this officer. It's just a bit similar.\"The young marquis is dead. He dug his body out of the ruins of the Imperial College. The body has been burned to a scorched body. No matter how long it has been, he can't forget the miserable appearance.Perhaps, it's not a bit similar at all, but it's just his eyes.With the appearance and talent of the young Marquis, it is impossible to find a second one in the six countries.\"Do you want to confirm with me?\" Seeing that Lord Zhuang seemed very concerned about the man who had admitted his mistake, Luo Tai Shou asked to have a look for him.Zhuang Xianzhi shook his head again: \"no, that old friend has passed away.\"\"Ah...\" no need to confirm the dead.Xiao LIULANG and Feng Lin went back to the inn. As soon as they entered, they heard a man shouting, \"Feng Dunzi!\"Feng Lin's hair is bursting!Childhood dominated by the shadow of the moment rushed to the top of the head!He's not the same person he used to be!He lost... Weight!Feng Lin raised his eyes and saw a scholar like young man rushing downstairs. He came to Feng Lin and said with a smile, \"it's you, Feng Dunzi! OK, you've changed so much that I almost didn't recognize you! Why? Who is he? \"The youth's eyes fell on Xiao LIULANG.Xiao LIULANG is more beautiful than a woman. It's hard for people to look at him more. If they are not afraid of being beaten by Feng Lin, they are attracted by Xiao LIULANG first, and then they notice Feng Lin next to him.Feng Lin, who would recognize him, was surprised and said, \"Du Ruohan?\"The young man patted Feng Lin on the shoulder with a smile: \"it's me!\"\"It's you Feng Lin also laughed and introduced Xiao LIULANG, \"LIULANG, do you remember him? Little belly! We three went to a private school together when we were childrenThe young man looked at Xiao LIULANG in disbelief. After a while, he said to Feng Lin, \"are you wrong? He is not LIULANGFeng Lin said: \"I'm not wrong! It's LIULANGThe young man looked at Xiao LIULANG suspiciously: \"the little Liuzi who moved away after living for a year?\"Feng Lin said: \"yes! That's him! It's not two years since he moved, so has your family! We haven't seen each other for more than ten years. \"Young people still feel that the other side is not Xiao LIULANG.He said to Feng Lin, \"I can recognize you. Why can't I recognize him?\"Where is Xiao Liuzi so beautiful?In fact, Feng Lin didn't recognize Xiao LIULANG at first sight. He only knew that he was his childhood neighbor after seeing Xiao LIULANG's Guide. In addition, Xiao LIULANG saved his life, so he had no doubt about Xiao LIULANG's identity.It's normal to say that Xiao LIULANG doesn't remember the past! It's been ten years. Xiao LIULANG was less than seven years old when he moved away. What can a six or seven year old baby remember!\"That boy, when he was a child, was very timid. He always hid behind his mother.\"Xiao LIULANG went upstairs first. The young man and Feng Lin whispered after him. It was the young man who spoke.\"LIULANG is different now! How brave he is! And he saved me Feng Lin said.\"It's different...\" the young man looked at Xiao LIULANG's back. He always felt that there was an air of capital childe on him. It was hard for people who had never seen him to notice.\"What happened to his leg?\" Just now in front of Xiao LIULANG's face, the young man didn't ask.\"I was injured half a year ago in order to save me. Now I'm in treatment.\" Feng Lin felt guilty and asked, \"well, where did you go after you moved away?\"\"To the capital.\" Said the young man.Feng Lin's eyes glared: \"did you go to the capital?\"It's a place that Feng Lin dreams of going to. Unfortunately, the capital is heavily guarded. People like them can never get a guide to the capital unless they go to Beijing for the exam.The young man said, \"my aunt is a concubine in the capital and has taken over our family. Now, are you still envious? \"Feng Lin was silent.The youth laughs: \"cheat you, go!\"They had dinner together. From the young man's mouth, Feng Lin learned that he was studying in a famous Academy in Beijing. He was admitted to a scholar two years ago and was going to take the local examination in August this year. This time, he went out with his uncle to increase his knowledge.The whole process is just a young man talking with Feng Lin. Xiao LIULANG talks little and doesn't like to talk to others.\"This boy was not like this before...\" after Xiao LIULANG returned to the house, the young man held Feng Lin and muttered.Feng Lin said softly, \"his mother and elder brother have passed away. These years have not been easy.\"\"Oh.\" The young man didn't say anything more. After a long time, his words changed, \"are you going to end this year? I'll wait for you in the capital! \"Feng Lin thought about it and said, \"I'll end up with LIULANG.\"How do you know he can pass the exam? That boy's brain doesn't work well. You forget that he is always scolded by the master? \"Even if you can't remember what Xiao LIULANG looked like when he was a child, you can't forget Xiao LIULANG's embarrassment. He is not stupid, but slower than others. This kind of person can do work, but study hard.Feng Lin zhengse said: \"LIULANG is different now. He took the county examination on the desk. This time... Although the title is very difficult, I believe he can be a scholar!\"Youth bad smile: \"play a bet, he can't pass the exam.\"Feng Lin made a decisive order!No one can look down on Xiao LIULANG, even his childhood friends!The young man got bored and was blown out of the Inn by Feng Lin. he lost the mood of wandering and went back to the prefect's house bored.The bodyguard of the prefect's mansion saw him and opened the door respectfully for him.As soon as he stepped into the courtyard, he was intimidated by a sharp drink: \"where have you been? Come back so late! \"The young man turned around and said with a smile, \"Hello, uncle. Didn't you go to check the papers? Is it all over so soon? \"Zhuang Shishi said seriously: \"don't digress from the topic! Where have you been? \"The young man said with a dry smile, \"I met two neighbors who used to live in Songxian County. I had a chat with them for a while. I ate dinner with them too.\"Chuang said coldly, \"do you think I will believe you if you say that? Are you doing something serious again? I promised your aunt to take you out, not to let you idle! Somebody! Put him in the house! He is not allowed to go out without my commandThe young man cried out: \"I didn't! Uncle! I really went to meet friends! They stay at Yuelai inn! One is Feng Lin! One is Xiao LIULANG! Xiao LIULANG is the examinee of this year! I just finished your abnormal test today! My face is green!

    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: 81As soon as these words came out, Du Ruohan knew that he was hopeless today.He hated his mouth. How could he tell the truth at the critical moment!Sure enough, when Luo Taishou came to dissuade Du Ruohan, Zhuang Xianzhi had already used his family method to 'serve\" his parents.Luo Taishou asked awkwardly and respectfully, \"my Lord, do you want to check those two people?\"Zhuang Xian denied: \"does that boy have the truth in his mouth?\"Luo Taishou's mouth: Mr. Du said that your examination question is abnormal. It's quite trueGu Jiao knows nothing about what happened in Pingcheng. She is sitting on the way to the hot spring villa.This morning, the second owner came to visit her in person and talked with her about the visit this month: \"although I know we talked about the reception before, you also know the situation of Mr. Gu. It's really not convenient for him to go out.\"The second owner doesn't know that Gu Yan came to see her not long ago, and that she has given him a follow-up visit.Gu Jiao pause: \"good.\"\"Eh?\" Second owner a Leng, so easy to talk?I've been holding on all the way. What's wrong?It was sunny and the carriage went very fast. It arrived at the villa in less than an hour.The people of the villa had a great change in their attitude towards them. Although the guards were still serious, their manners were very polite.The servant girl who came to pick them up was the same person as last time. It is said that her name was Yu ya'er.Yu ya'er leads Gu Jiao, the second boss and the eldest husband to the pavilion near the small garden: \"young master is soaking in the hot spring. Please wait a moment. I'll report to him.\"The hot spring is close to the pavilion. Yu ya'er is not sure where he wants to see a doctor. If he wants to go to the hot spring, he doesn't have to take them to the main hospital.Yu ya'er asks the young master to show her, and orders a little servant girl to go to the kitchen and bring some snacks and tea to treat Gu Jiao.This treatment is much better than last time.The second owner tasted a mouthful of Rose Crisp and couldn't close his mouth with laughter.\"How delicious is it?\" Gu Jiao asked.The second owner said with a smile, \"the price of Hou Fu's food lies in not being delicious, but not being able to eat.\"He didn't eat dim sum, it was glory!\"Woo! WooWhen several people were waiting, the cry of something came from the small garden.Three people all heard, eldest brother follows prestige to go, ask curiously: \"what sound?\"The second owner had a snack. He listened attentively, but didn't hear it.\"I'll see.\" Gu Jiao said.\"Er... Don't...\" the second owner wants to stop her, but is Gu Jiao so easy to stop?Then she got up and went down the steps to the little garden.She followed the sound and soon found the little thing trapped under the fence.It was a suckling dog who was just born. Somehow, it got stuck in the fence. There was a circle of thorns under the fence. As a result, the more it struggled, the more thorns stabbed into its meat.It hurt badly, tearful, see someone come, I do not know is frightened or excited, stretched out a small tongue, but suddenly licked the thorn of thorns, pain it immediately whimper up.\"What a silly little dog.\" Gu Jiao squatted down and touched her hairy head, \"don't move.\"The little suckling dog didn't understand. It was still moving. It was aching.To get it out, first remove the fence, and then pull out the thorns one by one from the little suckling dog.Gu Jiao chose the best position and started to draw the fence.At this moment, a servant girl in apricot Bijia came over: \"who? Stop itGu Jiao didn't stop.Gu Jiao is dressed like a village girl with a basket on her back.That servant girl only feels that this dress looks familiar, but she doesn't pay attention to it. She strides over and grabs Gu Jiao's little basket: \"I told you to stop, don't you hear me?\"Gu Jiao lightly turned her head, cold eyes such as a knife, scared the servant girl to shake and let go.Then, the servant girl recognized her: \"is it you?\"Gu Jiao also recognized her, the servant who turned her purse in the rejuvenation hall and slandered her as a thief, Gu Jinyu's confidant, named Yuru.\"What are you doing here?\" Yuru frowned, remembering that she had just heard that the doctor of huichuntang came to see the young master again. Her face sank, \"you are just a little medicine boy. You don't have to follow me every time!\"Gu Jiao is too lazy to pay attention to her. She starts to smoke the fence.Yuru yelled, \"what are you doing? It's full of ladies' flowers! Can you afford to break it? \"\"Woo! Woo The little dog barked with pain.Yuru took a look at it and said with a sneer, \"just for a local dog? Your dog? Sure enough, it's a man with a dog! Do you know how much silver a peony is here? That is to sell you and your dog... \"It's noisy.Gu Jiao frowned and pulled up the fence.\"You --\" Yu Ru's face changed and she rushed to her.In fact, Gu Jiao avoided the peonies when she pulled out the fence, but Yuru threw herself on the fence and let the tail of the fence sweep away and broke one of the peonies.It's the most blooming one.Yuru's face turned white.She stepped back several steps, far away from the scene, covered her mouth with one hand and pointed to Gu Jiao: \"you... You've damaged the lady's flower!\"\"You broke it yourself! It's strangeIt's yuya'er's voice.After reporting to Gu Yan, she came back. Gu Yan asked her to take people to the hot spring, but she ran into this scene.\"Shameless!\" Yu ya'er said.Yuru is Gu Jinyu's servant girl. Few of the servants in the villa dare to talk to her like this.Yuru's face was black: 'she broke it! She pulled the fence out! Don't believe you ask... Ask them! They all saw itI don't know when several servants came around to watch.Yuru asked them to testify.Jade bud son fork waist way: \"good, you say! Who broke it? \"The crowd bowed their heads.Gu Jinyu is the backing of Yuru. It's not worth offending her for a little drug boy.It's not that Gu Yan doesn't let people fear, but that Yu ya'er's attitude is not inspired by Gu Yan at all! Who doesn't know that young master hates these dogs and cats most?Yuru sneered: 'see? She broke itGu Jiao, who is pointed by Yu Ru, doesn't pay any attention to the noise around her. She takes the thorns off the little suckling dog and covers it with a clean handkerchief.The handkerchief was soon dyed red by the blood on its body.\"Wu... Wu...\" the little suckling dog was in tears.The second owner and mammy Fang arrived at the same time.Gu Jiao crawls the bed the matter room mammy remembers vividly, to Gu Jiao impression is not good, saw in her hand that bloody dog to be more impatient in particular: \"also does not throw out hastily?\"This is not only to Gu Jiao, but also to the two masters.The second owner knew Gu Jiao couldn't throw it.\"Give it to me. I'll put it on the carriage.\" The second owner reached for the dog.Gu Jiao didn't give it to him.Two owners help the amount, little girl eat soft don't eat hard, good life said not? Do you have to kill her? It's over.Mammy Fang said coldly, \"I'll say it again, throw the little beast out! Or she'll get out of here! \"\"Who do you want to get out of here?\"Accompanied by a not salty voice, Gu Yan's soft sedan chair was carried over.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82: 82\"Young master!\"Mammy Fang and all the people hurriedly salute Gu Yan.The second owner also bowed his hand.Zhao had a strict hierarchy. As a businessman, the second owner had to bow to the Marquis's son. Gu Jiao was no exception, but she had no habit of bowing to others.She just stares at Gu Yan.When everyone bowed down, she seemed to stand out from the rest of the crowd, even if people didn't want to notice.The second owner pulled her sleeve and motioned her to salute.Although they are here to cure young master, they can't be rude to him, can they?But Gu Yan didn't seem to see it. He didn't say hello to Gu Jiao, and he didn't force her to go down the line.He looked at mammy Fang and said, \"do you want me to ask you a second time?\"Mammy Fang was just so shocked that she forgot to answer for a moment. Now she realized she was coming back, so she told Gu Yan about Gu Jiao's refusal to throw the dog out.As for Gu Jiao's damage to the peony, she didn't mention it. After all, she didn't see it with her own eyes. That is to say, it's not her turn to talk about it.Everyone in the house knows that Gu Yan hates these little things most and thinks they are noisy. Not long ago, Gu Jinyu raised a rabbit that can't bark, but Gu Yan forced it out. This girl is really hit on the blade, how to die, I'm afraid I don't know!Sure enough, when Gu Yan's eyes fell on the bloody little suckling dog that Gu Jiao held in her arms, the gas field suddenly became cold.Mother Fang is cold.Let you throw you still, this fall in the hands of young master?\"Where's the dog from?\" Gu Yan asked.\"I picked it up.\" Gu Jiao said, \"it's stuck in the fence and stabbed by thorns.\"Gu Yan's eyes swept to the fence.Gu Jiao took up the fence has been re inserted back, but the renovation of the soil can still see the traces of movement.Yu Ru glanced at the broken peony and said, 'she also broke miss's peony! For this local dogYuya'er said, \"it's you who broke it!\"\"It's her!\" Yuru coldly points to Gu Jiao.\"It's you!\" Yu ya'er is on her hips.Gu Yan's face became extremely cold. Everyone could see that he was angry.He has a heart disease. He can't get angry easily, otherwise he will get sick. Otherwise, the Lord and Lady hou would not be so used to him. Even if they told him to give such precious antique paintings, even though they knew that he was tearing them to vent his anger.\"Shut up, both of you Mother Fang drinks hard.The two little maids were silent for a moment.Gu Yan glanced at all the people present, and then looked at Gu Jiao in the flowers: \"you all see that she made it?\"This is the tone of asking the guilty, and everyone bowed their heads to acquiesce.\"No... it's not her...\" Yu ya'er was frightened by Gu Yan's aura, and her voice became weak.Gu Yan said, \"they all say she did it, but you are the only one to say no.\"\"It's not.\" Yu ya'er whispered.Yuru smugly hooked the corner of her lips.No matter what, the young lady is the elder sister of the young master. How could the young master not believe her servant girl, but a wild girl from outside?As for Yu ya'er, she is only a third-class servant girl in the yard of the young master. She is not qualified to serve the young master.Of course, her words didn't carry much weight.\"Good.\" Gu Yan nodded, \"what's your name?\"Yu ya'er was stunned: \"I... me? Yu ya'er. \"Gu Yan said: \"except for bean sprouts, everyone will be driven out of the villa by my son!\"\"It's Yuya!\"No, out of the villa? Not her?Yu ya'er was stunned.All of them changed their faces. How could the young master not punish Yu ya'er and the little drug boy, but drive them out?The only one with the same look was Gu Jiao. From beginning to end, there was no waves on her face. She only appeased the injured little suckling dog wholeheartedly.Yu Ru came to him in disbelief: \"young master, I am...\"It's a hair. It's a hair!Two dark Wei quickly appear, a finger will hold her, will she and all the servants who try to slander Gu Jiao throw out.The guards who were going to carry out the order were a little silly.Where did these two goods come from?They're fighting for jobs in broad daylight?Man in Black: Oh, you don't know anything about little darling.How can I give you such a good chance to please him?In the end, there was mammy Fang.She is Yao's companion, if the mountain villa's bodyguard certainly does not dare to move her, dark Wei is two words not to say to put her out.Mammy Fang: \"let me go! I want to see Madame! I want to see MadameWhew!A dark guard points her dumb acupoint, and she can't make a sound instantly.The bodyguards all gave a thumbs up. Even mammy Fang dared to move. The cow is still your cow.The dark guard of the man in black finished this and immediately disappeared in the dark.When the little master needs them, they are hidden weapons! When the little master doesn't need them, they are the air!The second owner's mouth was wide open and could not be closed for a long time.Gu Yan asked people to put the sedan chair down. He went down to Gu Jiao and said with a warm smile, \"how about it? Do you want to relieve Qi? \"Second owner: wait, what's the situation? You throw so many people out just to relieve the little girl's anger?Gu Jiao seriously thought about it, nodded: \"Jieqi.\"Gu Yan was even more smiling.He was born good-looking, and then show a smile, it is even the whole garden are dim.\"It's bleeding a lot, isn't it seriously hurt?\" Gu Yan looks at the little suckling dog in her arms and asks.\"Well, I'll find a place to stop the bleeding.\"\"You can come to my yard.\"Gu Yan brings Gu Jiao back to his house: \"bean sprouts, take a clean mattress.\"It's Yuya!!!Jade bud son fork waist, heart roar!With a black face, Yu ya'er takes the mattress to Gu Yan's room and spreads it on Gu Yan's desk.Gu Jiao took Iodophor to clean up the wound of the little suckling dog, applied some of her homemade acne medicine, and wrapped gauze in some places.\"Do you have goat's milk?\" She asked.\"Yes, bean sprouts!\" Gu Yan asks Yu ya'er to get a bowl of fresh goat's milk.The dog licked up and fell asleep.Gu Yan didn't disturb Gu Jiao in the whole process. He sat cross legged on the bed and played with Gu Jiao's stethoscope intently.He hung the stethoscope on his ear and lowered his head, listening to his heart and stomach for a while.WOW!How loud!The cynical and surly young master Gu finally turned into a curious baby.The old doctor gave Gu Yan the pulse of his routine.Gu Yan was very cooperative with the old doctor, and his attitude was so good that the old doctor was flattered.Gu Yan's pulse condition also surprised the old doctor.

He just described the incident as it was, including Gu Jiao's pulling out the fence to save the dog, the dispute between Yu Ru and Gu Jiao, the peony that accidentally damaged Gu Jinyu, and the incident that mother Fang angered Gu Yan.The manager sighed: \"Yuru is from the capital. She has always looked down on the servants of the villa. This time, it's a lesson... It's a pity for mother Fang.\"Marquis Gu snorted coldly: \"what's her pity? Everyone rushes out. I think she's been in charge for too long, forgetting that she's just a slave! \"Whether he recognized the child or not, the child was not a humble slave to be bullied.The manager is a little confused.What happened to the slave? Isn't that still higher than the identity of little drug boy?What's more, Mammy Fang is Mrs. Hou's companion. Mr. Hou always thinks highly of her. Why did she suddenly say such a heavy word? \"Marquis Gu said, \"don't they come in the afternoon? Early? How come no one reported it to the Marquis? \"The Post said afternoon.The second owner was planning to come in the afternoon. I didn't expect Gu Jiao to be so cheerful and start in the morning.Generally, folk doctors don't see the Lord. At most, they kowtow in front of him after the treatment and get a chance to show their face.So the chief manager didn't report to the marquis in advance.Mammy Fang was scolded. Naturally, the manager didn't dare to shirk his responsibility: \"it's the slave who didn't do things properly. Please forgive me.\"\"Where are the people?\" Asked Marquis Gu.\"It's like I went to the little childe's yard.\" The young master also paid too much attention to the huichuntang group. Even though the servants did something wrong, there was no need to drive out mammy Fang and Yuru, right?If you let Mrs. Hou and miss know, isn't it hard to do?\"I'll go and have a look.\" Then Marquis Gu got up from his chair.\"Marquis!\" The manager called him, \"what are you going to do with those people outside?\"Marquis Gu pondered for a moment: \"mammy Fang will stay and the rest will be sent away.\"Mother Fang is Yao's companion. It's not good to tell Yao if she's sent away. Her son can drive people out, but he can't help but bring them back. It's hard to be a father and even harder to be a prime minister.Besides, mother fang had no bad heart except for her disgusting temperament. She was very loyal to Yao and could do things well.\"Is Miss Yuru also dismissed?\" The manager asked.Marquis Gu said in a cold voice: \"don't you get rid of this kind of arrogant servant girl and keep it for the new year? Why are you responsible for JinyuThe manager was in a hurry and said, \"yes, I'll do it now.\"\"There's more.\" Marquis Gu said, \"let mammy Fang not go to Yan'er's yard after she comes back.\"\"... yes.\"Gu Yan has a bad temper and drives away a group of people every month. Therefore, this incident did not cause a big stir in the villa at the beginning, but now people are surprised to hear that mammy Fang and Yuru were also thrown out.No matter how angry he used to be, he would not touch the people around Mrs. Hou and miss. What happened this time?Gu Jiao, the client, knows nothing about people's doubts. After she helps Gu Yan, she quietly goes to the front yard to blow her hair. She wants to be alone.It's also strange that she didn't have to get angry with the boss first, but she didn't expect that the old doctor was so skinny, and she learned the second boss and shopkeeper Wang's boasting.The medicine he made yesterday, she gave it to Gu Yan ten days ago, and she was sold out of her underpants!Gu Yan looked at her with a smile in the corridor.Gu Jiao: still look, you still look! Still smiling! I don't want face!Gu Jiao gives Gu Yan the back of her head.Just at this time, the little suckling dog woke up and began to look around for Gu Jiao.Gu Yan picked it up.As soon as the little suckling dog got close to Gu Yan, he was afraid. His little body was shivering and purring.Gu Yan is not stingy of his own death gaze.He has no love. He hates these lovely little things, especially when she holds them in her armsShe didn't even hold me!Gu Yan glared at it jealously, as if he would crush it in the next second.The little suckling dog felt Gu Yan's murderous spirit and barked even more.\"Ouch, ouch!\"Gu Yan snorted: \"in her face, please forgive me.\"Although I hate this little thing, but she likes it, so he can not hate it so much.When Marquis Gu stepped into the yard, he saw Gu Jiao and Gu Yan squatting on the lawn of the front yard to make a doghouse.There is a pile of wood scattered on the ground. Gu Jiao is responsible for splitting, Gu Yan is responsible for building, and Gu Jiao is also responsible for nailing nails.They have a tacit understanding. When Gu Jiao finishes this step, Gu Yan knows what the next step is, although he has never built such a dog house before.They have the same vision.People carry all kinds of mattresses. They either like them or don't like them.They are like children who play seriously and enjoy each other's company.Are they really twins?Gu Jinyu and Gu Yan grew up together when they were young. Marquis Gu did not know how many ways to try to make them closer, but they just couldn't play together.In fact, it's not only Gu Jinyu, but also other people who are difficult to get along with Gu Yan. The child is full of thorns, who is close to stabbing who.Marquis Gu has never seen such a obedient son. His temper is gone. So is the girl. She is much quieter.If that girl has been like this, it doesn't seem to be so annoying.\"No, it's ugly.\" Gu Yan said with a roof made by Gu Jiao.\"But I don't think it's ugly.\" Gu Jiao said.This is the last step, nailing the roof will be finished.Gu Yan looked at the sky: \"I don't care! I don't want it\"Good.\" Gu Jiao took apart the roof she had finished so hard and made another one.The second owner is also very obsessed. The little girl is easily irritable. Besides Xiao LIULANG, he has never seen her so patient with anyone.Gu Yan is so careful that he can't hide it from Marquis Gu.After the completion of the kennel, Gu Jiao has no reason to stay here.The twins are always special. Even if they do the same thing, it's more interesting to watch them than to watch other children.Maybe recognition is not a bad thing.But if recognize back, Jin Yu there only afraid to suffer some injustice.Marquis Gu worried that Gu Yan would bully Gu Jinyu more and more.If other sons do this, marquis Gu can stop him severely. But Gu Yan has congenital disease. Who can make him unhappy? He can give you a chance to die on the spot!Marquis Gu has a headache.\"Marquis.\" Huang Zhong is here.\"What are you doing here?\" Marquis Gu moved out to prevent people in the yard from seeing him, so as not to disturb the two children's play.Huang Zhong said solemnly, \"I heard that the young lady is coming. I'll protect you from being beaten by the young lady again.\"Marquis Gu gave him a cold eye knife: \"can't I beat her? I'm letting her go\"Oh.\" Huang Zhong didn't believe it.Thinking of what, Lord Gu asked, \"do you have a silver needle?\"\"Yes!\" Huang Zhong took out a concealed weapon box from his arms and said, \"what does the Marquis want the silver needle for?\"Marquis Gu: \"I want to take a drop of her blood.\"Huang Zhong asked, \"what do you want from the young lady's blood? Do you not believe that the young lady was bornMarquis Gu said angrily: \"now is this Marquis? She didn't believe itHuang Zhong thought of Hou Ye's \"I'm your Lao Tzu\" and said, \"that's your way of expression. Is there something wrong...\"Marquis Gu snorted coldly: \"no matter, if she doesn't believe it, I will show her evidence to believe it!\"Huang Zhong said, \"then why don't you tell the lady directly?\"Gu Hou Ye glanced at him: \"do you think she will give it to me?\"Huang Zhong: \"er... No. But are you going too far with the needle? \"\"Why don't you do it?\" Marquis Gu looks at Huang Zhong coldly.\"You... You tie it up.\" Huang Zhong pinched a cold sweat, but he didn't dare.Marquis Gu really took the silver needle.When people in the courtyard saw him, they all got up to salute. Even the second owner and the old doctor who were drinking tea in the courtyard also got up.He waved his hand to show the crowd what to do. Don't make any noise.He came to his sister and brother.Head light a dark, two people looked up at him, who did not pay attention to him, continue to bury his head in the dog house.Marquis Gu, who was ignoredForget it, he's here to get blood. They just ignore him to facilitate his sneak attack.He stood there waiting for the moment.In a moment, they both raised their heads and looked at him with disgust.Marquis Gu said with a smile: \"where can't you get it? I'll help you! \"Gu Yan said, \"you are blocking the light.\"Gu Hou Ye face a black, silently around to two people behind.Soon he found that the position was better.Just one shot is enough.Marquis Gu secretly searched for opportunities.Gu Jiao is Dingding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.Marquis Gu is ready to put the needle. I didn't expect that Gu Jiao was so sharp that she almost caught him!He Shua's hand back to the back with the silver needle!Gu Jiao looked at the salty pig hand he took back and looked at her shoulder. She always felt that he was guilty... Very obscene!\"Don't get in the way of us here!\" Gu Yan is aware of Gu Jiao's rejection of marquis Gu and starts to drive people out directly.Marquis Gu was so angry!He's still not their father? If it wasn't for his own life, he would have killed people!Marquis Gu didn't give up so easily. If you can't do it openly, you can't do it secretly.He coughed softly and said, \"you've worked hard all the way. I have a lot to ask about the condition of my son. I'm tired of looking after the girl. I'd better go to the wing room and have a rest. Hu Erdong's family and Doctor Li will come to the study with me. \"Hu Erdong's family and the old doctor go to Lord Gu's study. Gu Yan and Gu Jiao go back to the wing room with their little suckling dog.Gu Yan can't keep watch of Gu Jiao all the time. While he goes to the thatched cottage, marquis Gu finds a way out of the study.He quietly Mimi underground in the tea some tranquilizer, looking for a maid to send to Gu Jiao.When she falls asleep, it's easy to take her blood.He had a good idea, but Gu Jiao smelled something wrong.She called to the servant girl: \"who asked you to send this tea?\"Servant girl way: \"is Hou Ye.\"Gu Jiao's eyes are cold.I'm going to give her medicine when I'm trying to stretch the salty pig's hand, isn't it?I'm old enough to be her father. I didn't expect that she was so abnormal!Gu Jiao's small fist clenched, she came to the window, a lift open the window lattice son, saw squatting in the window sill under the furtive Gu Hou Ye.Gu Jiao is as fierce as a sword!Marquis Gu noticed something wrong from her murderous spirit. His heart trembled and he stepped back: \"well, listen to me, I'm actually...\"\"Buddha, mountain, Wu, shadow, foot\"\"Ah --\"Boom!Bang!Bang bang!Bang.Dong!Gollum.\u2026\u2026\"I can't water --\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: 84Huang Zhong found his marquis in a big tree 100 steps away from the yard.Marquis Gu was picked up by Gu Jiao and hung on a branch of a big tree. It was like a wet dress. There was no dry place on his whole body and he was dripping.Huang Zhong was startled when he saw him. It's because it's day and night. If you don't know at night, you'll think you've seen a ghost!\"Hou, how did you hang yourself up in the tree?\"Did I hang it up? It's the bold girl!\"And how is your face swollen?\"It's the same girl!Every time I see that girl, it's no good. There's no complete place for him all over!He found out that the girl came to conquer him!\"I don't want to recognize her --\"--Gu Jiao and Gu Yan say goodbye. Gu Yan is very reluctant to part with her, but Gu Jiao agrees that she will come to see him again soon, so he reluctantly lets Gu Jiao go.He and Gu Jiao rode together in his sedan chair and sent Gu Jiao to the carriage.This operation startled the jaw of a group of servants.You know, Gu Yan's sedan chair is his absolute private domain. Once, young Gu Jinyu was curious to climb in and was kicked down by Gu Yan on the spot.\"I'll sit with you next time.\" Gu Yan said to Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao nodded: \"good.\"Gu Jiao didn't go back to the town immediately after she left the hot spring villa. Instead, she went to Dean Li's home first.President Li is in the Academy. There are only Mrs. Li and his servants in his family.Old lady Li doesn't wake up much in a day. It's said that sometimes she doesn't even recognize president Li.However, she seems to know Gu Jiao, and she grabs a lot of sugar for her and laughs.Gu Jiao gave her a physical examination, she did not matter, is older, memory degradation, physical aging.Gu Jiao left a basket of fresh mountain goods and found that old lady Li was always looking at a mulberry tree outside the wall and drooling. Gu Jiao went out of the yard and planned to pick some mulberry for old lady Li.But when she came near, she found that the mulberry tree was not wild on the roadside, but planted in the courtyard next door. Because the crown was too tall, it came out of her own wall.Gu Jiao thought about it and went over to knock on each other's door.\"Cough, who is it?\"Accompanied by a low cough, the vermilion door was opened, and the one who opened the door was a lady with a blue temperament.Gu Jiao recognized her at a glance.She also recognized Gu Jiao.She covered her mouth with a handkerchief, coughed twice, and then showed a smile: \"girl, is that you?\"Gu Jiao Leng, she came to pick a mulberry, how all met the temple's wife?\"Madame, did you live so far?\" It's not too much to go to the temple to offer incense from here.\"My name is Gu.\" Yao said gently.Gu?Is there a second rich and wealthy family caretaker here? The answer is No.Gu Jiao quickly guessed her identity, but she did not say that she was Mrs. Hou, so Gu Jiao did not point out.Yao invited Gu Jiao in. She was just basking in the sun in the yard. The rattan chairs, tables, chairs and benches are complete.She pointed to the wooden stool and said, 'sit down.\"Gu Jiao sat down and found that there was no servant in the yard.Seeing her doubts, Yao said with a smile, \"I want to be alone and let them go to the front yard. This is the back yard. Does the girl live near here, too? \"Gu Jiao said: \"I passed by and saw that the mulberry was delicious. I wanted to come in and ask, but I'm disturbing Mrs. Gu?\"\"It's nothing.\" Yao is very happy to see Gu Jiao. She can't tell why, \"I'll let someone pick it for you.\"Yao called a servant woman to play mulberry for Gu Jiao. She took Gu Jiao and said in the yard: \"I don't know the name of the girl.\"\"Gu Jiao.\" Gu Jiao said.Yao's surprise smile: \"you also surname Gu? We were one five hundred years ago. \"Gu Yan also said this, worthy of being a mother and son.Yao's condition was not very good. After a few words, he coughed violently.Gu Jiao looked at her pale face and said, \"Madam Gu, if you don't mind, I'll feel your pulse.\"\"Is Miss Gu proficient in Qihuang?\"\"A little bit.\"Yao laughed and put his hand out on the table.The servant woman finished a basket full of mulberry, and came to ask Yao to show her. Yao waved her hand and motioned her to step down.The servant put the mulberry gently on the table and then stepped down.Her pulse is not very good, but her condition is worse than it looks.Gu Jiao quietly took back her hand and asked Yao, \"Mrs. Gu, how is your sleep?\"Yao said, \"it's not good. It's hard to fall asleep.\"Gu Jiao asked: \"appetite?\"Yao shook his head slightly: \"it's not big enough to eat.\"Gu Jiao pause: \"before the cold is so?\"Yao: \"well.\"Gu Jiao: \"about how long?\"Yao: \"I don't remember the details. In short, it's been a long time.\"Gu Jiao asked some more questions.In fact, the doctor also asked, but Yao didn't want to open his heart, and often perfunctorily.Yao trusted Gu Jiao and answered truthfully.Gu Jiao then said, \"Mrs. Gu has seen doctors before. What do they say?\"Yao's wry smile: \"they say I worry too much, let me relax, don't think about anything, also prescribed medicine. But it doesn't help much. I'll eat it later. \"That's it.The doctor's worry is too heavy, in other words, depression.But she is also accompanied by hysteria, once the attack is very dangerous.Gu Jiao took two boxes of antidepressants from the small medicine box and replaced them with porcelain bottles.Yao sat opposite Gu Jiao, only to see the upright lid, did not see Gu Jiao's operation.Gu Jiao handed the porcelain bottle to Yao, said the usage and dosage, and told: \"Mrs. Gu, you must take medicine, so that the disease will be cured.\"The medicine of the imperial doctor is invalid. How can the medicine handed over by a little girl be effective?But the little girl worked hard for a long time. Yao couldn't bear to refuse her kindness. She took the medicine and laughed: \"good.\"Gu Jiao seriously looked into her eyes: \"you can't throw the medicine away, you have to promise me that you will really take the medicine on time.\"Yao has not seen such sincere eyes for a long time. Those who want to cure her are not her, but the wife of Hou's house.If she is not Mrs. Hou, no one will look at her.But this little girl is really trying to cure her.Yao's to pay for Gu Jiao diagnosis, Gu Jiao shook the mulberry in the basket.Yao laughed.But Gu Jiao did ask Yao for some extra money, but it was not silver, but a cake she made herself.Yao is very happy.She hasn't been so happy in a long time.Every time I see her, she is always lucky, either saved or cured by her.Is this girl her lucky star?Xu is the same age, Yao soon thought of Gu Jinyu.Although she is a mother and daughter, her relationship with Jinyu is not as close as her relationship with Gu Yan.Even if Gu Yan stinks all day, she can feel Gu Yan's need for her.She stayed in the villa and asked Gu Yan to go to the capital. Gu Yan couldn't do it, but Jin Yu could leave easily. She seemed to yearn for the prosperity of the capital and the hustle and bustle of Hou Fu.It's not that Jinyu doesn't love her, but that Jinyu's world is more than her.Without her, Jinyu can live well.That, she thought, might be a good thing.After all, if one day Gu Yan is gone, she doesn't want to live.At least she doesn't have to worry about Jinyu.On the way back, Gu Jiao asked the second master about hou Fu.\"What do you mean?\" Asked the second owner.\"Madam Hou.\" Gu Jiao said.It's not surprising to ask about Mrs. Hou. After all, the owners of the hot spring villa have met three of them, only the lady has not been masked.The second owner didn't realize Gu Jiao's purpose. He thought about it and said, \"that lady Hou seems to have a surname of Yao. She has some stories to tell. She is the stepmother of marquis Ding'an. Her family is in a state of decline. Her father took a casual job in the household department. It is said that she offended others. In the end, she didn't take a proper job. She is a handkerchief friend with the former Hou's wife. Before the former Hou's death, she visited several times, and there are rumors in the capital that she took advantage of the former Hou's serious illness to hook up with the Marquis of Ding'an. \"Gu Jiao frowned slightly. She was not like this kind of person.The second owner then said, \"the truth is that she has never met the Marquis of Ding'an in the Marquis's residence.\"\"How do you know?\" Gu Jiao asked.The second owner said with a faint smile: \"our huichuntang is still famous in the capital. The imperial doctor who treated the former Hou's wife has some contacts with my family, but the former Hou's wife did ask Yao to take care of her children.\"Gu Jiao asked, \"did Mrs. Hou have children?\"Er Dongjia said, \"yes, I have three sons, and the latter two are twins. Former Hou's wife moved the idea of Yao's making a sequel to Ding'an Hou, but Yao himself disagreed. Yao's own refusal, the imperial doctor in the back of the medicine, all to hear.\"But around the corner, the Marquis of Ding'an finally met Yao and fell in love with her. Marquis Ding'an directly proposed marriage to the Yao family, and the Yao family agreed without saying a word. After that, you should be able to think of all kinds of slander Yao's rumors in the capital.\"Mrs. Hou has been staying in the hot spring villa these years, one is to accompany Gu Yan to recuperate, the other is because she is not comfortable in the capital.\"Marquis Ding'an doesn't have much love for his original wife. On the contrary, he loves Yao very much. Yao's family background is not enough for him. He insists on marrying Yao himself. But the more he loves Yao, the more people feel that Yao is a fox. \"In fact, the second owner once met Yao. She was a woman with no intention. Her eyes were as clean as the lake at the bottom.If she was foxy, there would be no one at the bottom that day.--Ten days after the trial, the government released the list.Candidates went to the government office early in the morning to see if they had passed the exam.The number of candidates admitted in the government examination is very limited. A total of 50 candidates are admitted in the hundreds of candidates, which are divided into two classes: Class A and class B, ten in class A, and the rest in class B.Feng Lin was awakened by Du Ruohan. Du Ruohan slipped out of the palace before dawn: \"Feng Lin, Feng Lin! Get up! Lose money! \"Du Ruohan made a unilateral bet with Feng Lin. he couldn't make a bet on Xiao LIULANG. He bet ten Liang silver.Feng Lin yawned and opened the door: \"I haven't had breakfast yet.\"Du Ruohan immediately put a big meat bun in his mouth and took him downstairs.Feng Lin took the steamed stuffed bun: \"LIULANG hasn't eaten it yet...\"Du Ruohan said, \"OK, OK! If he has hands and feet, will he starve to death? \"Du Ruohan can't help but pull Feng Lin to the gate of the Yamen.There have been many candidates standing there, and the notice column is packed. It took Du Ruohan nine cows and two tigers to pull Feng Lin to the inside.In Du Ruohan's opinion, Xiao LIULANG's chances of getting into the exam are really small.\"Hey, wait to give me the silver, Feng Xiaodun!\"\"I'm not Feng Xiaodun! I... I didn't talk to you... \"In the middle of the conversation, Feng Lin's eyes fell on the name that was so eye-catching that no one could ignore. He suddenly choked, pointed to the list and said,\" you, you see! \"Du Ruohan looked in the direction of his fingers.In a very eye-catching position to see a name - Fu Shi desk, Xiao LIULANG!Du Ruohan's jaw would be startled: \"isn't it? That guy got into the exam? Or the front desk? How is that possible? \"What about the good little nerd?The guy who can't recite all the three character scriptures has become the head of the government trial?It's much more difficult for the head of the government trial than that of the county trial. It's not a scale at all.What's more, the exam was written by his abnormal uncle, which makes it even more difficult for people to start, OK?Feng Lin held out his hand.Du Ruohan: \"why?\"Feng Lin: \"willing to accept defeat.\"No, don't you gamble with me?You're corrupted by that boy!Feng Lin took all Du Ruohan's belongings and went back to the inn happily. He gave half of the silver to Xiao LIULANG, so he didn't have to say anything about his achievements. The person who reported the good news had already gone to the inn to congratulate him.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: 85When the innkeeper learned that there was a case in front of the examinees, he immediately refunded the room expenses of Xiao LIULANG and the three of them, and packed the food for several of them. They were all the most expensive food and wine. If we didn't have any, we could ask Xiao Er to go out and buy them.Although Feng Lin has already been admitted to the scholar, his achievements are not top-notch, so naturally he has never received such treatment.Following Xiao LIULANG this time, he had a good life.It is worth mentioning that Xiao LIULANG did well in the exam, and his articles spread on the day of publication. Naturally, many people who wanted to make friends with Xiao LIULANG were turned away by him.The imperial examination system of our Dynasty has been greatly adjusted compared with that of the previous dynasty. After the previous imperial examination, we have to wait two to three months before the imperial examination. However, our imperial examination is closely ranked in the second day of the imperial examination.During the ten days of waiting for the results, most of the examinees spent their time in fear. They were not easy to be sure that they had passed the exam, but they didn't even have a chance to breathe. They had to enter the next round of the exam.This undoubtedly increases the pressure on candidates.There were two court trials, eight part essay and tie Jing.The difficulty of the Sutra is the same as that of the official examination, and the eight part essay is still the topic of Zhuang CI Shi.Xiao LIULANG has already won two cases in succession, and the next one is Xiao Sanyuan.It has been nearly ten years since Xiao LIULANG was born in Pingcheng. All the officials in the government have high hopes for Xiao LIULANG. However, to everyone's surprise, Xiao LIULANG's Sutra were handed in blank.There is little difference in the scope between the imperial examination classics and the imperial examination classics. They are still required to pass the three classics, but the number of questions is larger and the type of questions is more tricky. However, it is not enough to hand in the blank papers.Of course, every round of the examination does not rule out that candidates may have a variety of unexpected situations - once, a student made a dirty thing on the paper, resulting in the whole paper invalid.It was a once-in-three-year local examination, and the three-year efforts of an examinee were just like this.But it's rare to hand in a blank paper.In particular, the object of this white paper is Xiao LIULANG, who left a deep impression on Zhuangzi in the official examination.If Zhuang Cishi remembers correctly, there are 12 examiners in the examination, of which 11 gave Xiao LIULANG a grade A for his eight part essay.The only one who didn't get a grade was Zhuang Cishi.What he gave Xiao LIULANG is B.But if you know that all that Chuang gave to others was Ding, you can see how valuable Xiao LIULANG's achievements are.Among the Eleven A's, the sutras can be ranked in the top ten even if they are written blindly, but Xiao LIULANG ranks third from the bottom.This surprised Mr. Zhuang.He transferred out the paper and found it was a blank one.Chuang CI asked people to transfer out the examination paper of Sutra that Xiao LIULANG had tried before.If the Sutra of Xiao LIULANG's examination is very bad, this matter may be gone, but the Sutra of Xiao LIULANG's examination is all a volume.That is to say, he is not wrong.\"And it took him only half an hour!\" The invigilator who came to deliver the examination papers.This invigilator was the one sitting opposite Xiao LIULANG during the official examination.The test paper is pasted, and I don't know whose it is when I hand it in. However, after Xiao LIULANG passed the examination, his eight part essay spread. The invigilator secretly went to the inn to see what the examination desk looked like and how he could make such a wonderful essay. He found that the other party was the examinee who had only written the sutras and essays for half an hour.Zhuang Cishi's vision is too high.It's not enough for him to be able to do everything right, but it would be amazing if it took only half an hour.Among the people he saw, the only one who could do better than this candidate was the late young Marquis of zhaodu.Zhuang immediately sent someone to the inn to ask Xiao LIULANG about the situation.\"I didn't hand in the blank paper.\" Xiao LIULANG said.If what Xiao LIULANG said is true, then someone moved his test paper, which is a big deal.The examination paper management of the imperial examination was quite strict. When each examinee handed in the paper, two invigilators went to collect the paper together, and pressed their fingerprints at the same time when pasting the name to prove that they collected the paper.Once there is a problem in the test paper, only the two of them ask.It is worth mentioning that all invigilators are matched by drawing lots after admission. Like the examinees, they can no longer contact the outside when they come in until the end of the examination.It's easy to bribe one of them, but it's too difficult to bribe two at the same time, because no one can guarantee that the two bribed will be divided together, let alone that they will be assigned to Xiao LIULANG's examination room.Nevertheless, Luo Taishou still called the person who collected the book to cross examine him. They both said they didn't have any irregularities.\"But white paper?\"\"I don't know. Before handing in the paper, candidates will cover it with a piece of white paper, which is also to prevent us from peeping at his handwriting.\"Zhuang Cishi nodded and turned to Luo Taishou and said, \"after their hands, the examination papers are pasted, right? The name will not be opened until all examiners have read it. Then I'm very curious. How did that person recognize Xiao LIULANG's test paper and successfully switch it into a blank one? \"Luo Taishou thought about it and said, \"there are two ways: one is to send papers, the other is to read papers. Xiao LIULANG is the head of the court trial. He is the first to sit in the court trial. This is the rule. The first one is his test paper, so you can use it in advance, even if it is pasted later, you can still recognize his test paper.Or, some examiners get Xiao LIULANG's examination papers and take down Xiao LIULANG's notes. When they read the Sutra, they recognize Xiao LIULANG's papers according to the notes.Either way, there must be some dirty hands and feet among the examiners who are marking papers! \"In order to avoid people memorizing candidates' handwriting, the examinee's judgment will be affected.But I can't rule out that someone stealthily got the papers of the government examination. After all, after the marking, the confidentiality of the papers was greatly reduced.In addition to Zhuang Cishi, 11 examiners were all taken into the secret room to accept the severe interrogation of Luo Taishou.Under the severe punishment, I really let the prefect Luo find out the real murderer.He was an examiners surnamed Wu. He had worked in Gongyuan for 20 years. He was as honest as an antique. He thought that he was the most unlikely one.It seems that not betraying is not a person's high morality, but the chips are not high enough.\"The man gave me a thousand taels of silver to destroy Xiao LIULANG's test paper. I originally prepared ink to disguise Xiao LIULANG's carelessness in soiling the test paper. I've seen a lot of such cases. They are all treated as waste volumes, and no one will verify them. But before I started, Lord Wang, who was supported by me, came back.As soon as I shook my hand, I spilled ink on myself. It was too late to find other ink. It happened that there were several blank papers on hand, so I took one and replaced it. \"\"What does that man look like?\"\"He's masked, I can't see.\"\"Voice? How high is it? \"\"I don't remember... I really don't remember!\"Luo Taishou reported the result of the trial to Zhuang Cishi.Generally speaking, in the case of cheating in the imperial examination, all people's examination papers will be invalid, and they will take the examination again. In this way, the government will hurt their muscles and bones, and many candidates will lose their mentality.Examination is always a combination of strength and luck, no one can guarantee that their next game will play better than this one, and no one can guarantee that other candidates will not catch up.Of course, for the unsuccessful candidates, this is undoubtedly a chance to pick up in vain.But the problem is that even if Xiao LIULANG was replaced with a blank paper, he still passed the hospital examination with 11 first-class and one second-class.In other words, those who should have been admitted have been admitted, and those who have failed should have been. The only difference is that they may have been ranked one ahead, while Xiao LIULANG has lost his position as the head of the case.Luo Taishou sighed: \"that person probably didn't expect that Xiao LIULANG could pass the hospital examination, but it's a pity that Xiao LIULANG should have had the chance to be the head of the case.\"Zhuangzi Shi zhengse said: \"this matter can be big or small, take a long-term view, it is a small matter; If you stop here in your life, it's a big deal. \"Small three yuan enough for a scholar scenery for a while, but only for a while.If he really wants to make a name for himself, he must continue to take the local examination, and then go to Beijing to take the examination after he is elected in the local examination.On the contrary, it was the starting point of the road of imperial examination.\"It's up to him to decide this matter. Ask him if he needs to take the exam again,\" Zhuang saidRe examination is not his re examination alone, but all the people who took part in the imperial envoy went through the two examinations again.Prefect Luo went to the inn.He met Xiao LIULANG, euphemistically explained his intention, asked Xiao LIULANG whether to retest.Instead of answering him directly, Xiao opened the window and showed him the students who were exchanging their grades in the lobby on the first floor. The list had already been released, and the students who failed in the exam were disheartened and red.At that moment, no one knew what he was going through.\"Are these candidates innocent?\" He said suddenly.Luo Taishou was stunned and said in a dumb voice for a long time: \"yes, after all, you didn't fail, so there's no one among them who has more than one place in the local examination.\"Xiao LIULANG looked at the examinees and said, \"if you take the exam again, some of them will fail, won't they?\"Luo Taishou sighed and nodded. It's inevitable. The mentality of re examination collapsed. It's hard to play normally.\"What about you, prefect Luo?\" Asked Xiao LIULANG.\"I... what?\" Luo Taishou was stunned.Xiao LIULANG said: \"it's said that the term of office of Luo Taishou is coming. It's a big event for the imperial envoy to take the re examination. It's necessary to report to the imperial court and record a big demerit. Will it affect Luo Taishou's re-election?\"Prefect Luo nodded helplessly.In this dynasty, the imperial examination was strictly controlled. Once the imperial examination was repeated due to fraud, his officials could be regarded as the first.Xiao LIULANG asked leisurely, \"how much do you think your future is worth?\"Prefect Luo was stunned!Is this boy blackmailing him openly?Xiao LIULANG said: \"the prefect is an honest and upright official. He will not be able to give much money. However, that man should have spent a lot of money to bribe the examiners, right? The victim is me. Should my lord compensate me for this money? \"They can buy back their own future, spend nothing, and have a good reputation as honest officials.It's a good deal!Luo Taishou fell into the pit Xiao LIULANG dug: 'should be, should be, a thousand Liang, I will send all to Xiao examinee!\"Xiao LIULANG said: \"also, if there is no one to tamper with the test paper, I am Xiao Sanyuan, which is not denied by Luo Taishou?\"Luo Taishou nodded as if pounding garlic: \"when, of course! The strength of Xiao's examinee is obvious to all of usXiao LIULANG sighed: \"but small three yuan is a bonus, this bonus, I can't get it now.\"Luo Taishou: \"I'm not sure.\"Why does Mao feel that the pit is a little big?The small three yuan bonus is allocated by the imperial court and paid by the Yamen. The Yamen pays one ratio, the Gongyuan pays one ratio, and the county yamen pays another ratio, which adds up to 100 Liang.Because Pingcheng government has not paid a small three yuan for ten years, the bonus has already doubled.In other words, Xiao LIULANG's prize money should be 200 Liang.But in today's situation, we can't take public accounts.In other words, the silver had to be paid by prefect Luo himself.Prefect Luo: I'm so naive that I think I can spend no money. I'm so stupid, really!The fraud ended with Luo Taishou spitting blood and paying for money.Zhuang Cishi is a distant relative of Luo Taishou. If the party concerned doesn't investigate, he doesn't report to the court.Luo Taishou's gossamer hat has been preserved, and the examinees do not need to collapse their mentality. Everyone is happy.As for the person who cheated, it should be a candidate, because he was jealous of Xiao LIULANG's achievements, so he wanted to pull him down.Luo Taishou said he would continue to investigate secretly.It was early April when Xiao LIULANG returned to the village. The village was full of the warmth of late spring. The willow branches beside the pond were sprouting and hanging down the water like a floating emerald curtain.The crops in the field are also growing up. At a glance, they are green.He came to the village at this time last year. Who would have expected that a year had passed.Zhang Bo, who had just come back from the field, turned his head and said to Aunt Zhang behind him, \"his mother, do you think that's LIULANG?\"Aunt Zhang's eyes are better than her own man's. she nodded after seeing it: \"isn't it LIULANG? Ah! The scholar is back! \"She also turned her head and yelled at the villagers who were working in the fields.Xiao LIULANG's achievements have been passed back to the village for a long time. Although he failed in the hospital test, the county test and the government test won the case, and he was also rated as a student.This is the second life in the village after taking care of Dashun.As early as this morning, people from the county government sent dozens of Jin of grain.The white rice looks better than Gu Dashun's!The villagers seemed to know Xiao LIULANG for the first time, but they didn't dare to talk to him.After all, this time is different from the past, people are scholars!\"Uncle Zhang, Aunt Zhang.\" Xiao LIULANG said hello to them.This family is warm-hearted, when Gu Jiaokui had a stomachache, Aunt Zhang borrowed brown sugar to Xiao LIULANG.Two people are flattered, the words all cannot connect!After that, Xiao LIULANG met several villagers again and again, and he said hello to them. He was neither too warm nor too cold, which was no different from his usual cold appearance.Finally, he got to the door.Because he didn't deliver the message in advance, his family didn't know he was back today.There's the sound of little clearance in the backyard.Xiao LIULANG stepped in.In the backyard full of sunshine, Gu Jiao is washing xiaojingkong's hair.Small clearance round little bald head grew out of the blue hair pile, he is particularly proud to ask Gu Jiao how long his hair, is not longer than a few days ago.The old lady sat on a rattan chair, watching monk Xiaomei take a bath and eating melon seeds.On the small bench beside her sat Xue Ningxiang's one year old son, goudan.The dog's eggs are nibbling at the corn cob.Xiao LIULANG was first discovered in xiaojingkong.Xiao Jingkong lowered his head and looked back from his crotch. He saw Xiao LIULANG falling down!He recognized for a long time: \"eh? \"Bad brother-in-law?\"Gu Jiao scooped water and turned her head quietly.She looked at him, and so did he.After more than a month's absence, the family has changed. Xiaojingkong has long hair. The older the old lady is, the younger she is. She seems to have grown taller and looks a little more green and beautiful.Her birthmark is still on her face, but it doesn't look like an ugly red spot. On the contrary, it looks like an enchanting flower, blooming a touch of bright and moving color in the cold and lonely temperament.Gorgeous as peaches and plums.And he is also tall, between the eyebrows faded a little bit of juvenile atmosphere, more than a trace of the book fragrance of the noble.Two people so Leng Leng ground look at, who also did not speak.\"LIULANG is back?\" The old lady turned her head briskly, \"do you have anything to eat?\"Xiao LIULANG recalled: \"I have.\"He said and walked forward, but did not look at the threshold, a stagger almost fell.Gu Jiao calmly turned around and continued to shower xiaojingkong.But as soon as she got under the water, she heard Xiao Jingkong yell, \"Oh! How cold it isGu Jiao is very embarrassed.Scoop, scoop wrong water.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: 86The old lady looked at Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG. Her eyes were full of meaning.I feel like I'm going to have big grandchildren soon!Gu Jiao asked Feng Lin.Xiao LIULANG also replied seriously: \"he went back to the academy and went to Fucheng for a month, which delayed many classes.\"Thanks to Feng Lin this time, Gu Jiao wrote down his kindness.While they were talking, a few yellow chicks swaggered out.Xiao LIULANG discovered that he had been away from home for more than a month, and his family began to raise chickens.Gu Jiao doesn't like raising chickens. It's Xiao Jingkong who occasionally sees the chicks next door. She doesn't like them very much. She asks Gu Jiao if he can raise some.Gu Jiao said that he could raise them, but with one condition, he had to take care of the chickens by himself, feed and water them, and clean the chicken manure.In order to make xiaojingkong understand the difficulty of raising chickens, Gu Jiao asked him to feed the chickens at Xue Ningxiang's house for two days. There were not only cute chicks, but also mature old hens and big cocks.And Gu Jiao told him that all the chicks who are looking at them now will grow into old hens and big cocks one day.As a result, this can not persuade him, Gu Jiao can only let him raise.He had seven, each of them plump.He also gave them names, from one to seven, and did not know how he recognized them.Xiao LIULANG brought Pingcheng's specialty, dried waxberry with sugar. At this time of year, the fruit is just fruiting. The fruit is not big and the sour taste is very strong. But this kind of waxberry is most suitable for sugar. It tastes sour and sweet, and it won't be greasy.Xiao LIULANG took two cans with him, one with nuclear and the other with nuclear.Although it's just two cans of food, it's the most famous candied dried waxberry in Pingcheng. It happens that there are many students in the exam, and they are robbed almost as soon as they come out every day.Xiao LIULANG went to line up in the middle of the night and shrank in the cold wind for a long time.The old lady plucked a seedless dried bayberry for the dog's egg.The dog's eggs drooled.Gu Xiaoshun had not finished school yet. Xiao LIULANG also brought something for him. It was a complete set of wood carving tools, especially complete.The control of iron in Zhao state is very strict, so it is difficult for ordinary people to buy such fine and complete iron tools. Xiao LIULANG bought them by mistaking Luo Taishou.Seeing Xiao LIULANG's burden shrink down.Xiao Jingkong walks the chicken, but he doesn't care about it, but he glances at Xiao LIULANG's burden from time to time.Gu Jiao caught his small strange, asked: \"clearance is also looking forward to their gifts?\"\"I didn't!\" Little clearance turned her head haughtily.Bad brother-in-law won't buy him a present!Xiao LIULANG has a good view of the little guy's discomforts. Originally, the relationship between the two was tough enough. After more than a month's separation, now they are not even strangers.Xiao LIULANG took a set of Kongming locks out of the bag: \"don't forget it. I'll give you dog eggs.\"\"No way!\" Xiao Jingkong jumped down from the chair and grabbed Kong mingsuo in his arms. \"He, he is small! He can't playGoudan looked at his little brother blankly, completely unaware of what had happened.Finally, Gu Jiao.It's a very delicate brocade box. Just look at the box and you will feel that it's valuable.Gu Jiao drew the length of the brocade box.Is it a hairpin?Such an expensive box, at least a silver hairpin.Silver hairpins are rare in the countryside. They are usually wooden hairpins, and the more heroic ones are copper hairpins. Silver hairpin can only be bought by people with good conditions, and it can only be worn on very important days.Of course, the most important thing is that if a man gives a woman a hairpin, it means something unspeakable!Gu Jiao wrote all over her face that I like it so much, I like it so much!Bata.Xiao LIULANG opened the box.It's not a hairpin, but a brush!Gu Jiao was silly on the spot.Xiao LIULANG said: \"your handwriting is always not good. Besides the wrong posture of holding the brush, it has something to do with the brush. This is a Langhao pen made by a famous craftsman in Pingcheng. It's very suitable for your strength. \"He seriously introduced, but Gu Jiao was not very good.Is hairpin hot?Why does Mao want to give her a pen?It's like sending a set of real exam questions to a student who only wants to play krypton. Can she refuse it?!Looking at Gu jiaoqiang holding back his crazy little appearance, the old lady laughed so much that her stomach hurt!\u2014\u2014There is a need that LIULANG thinks you need.Gu Jiao holds the Langhao pen in her arms and her small face turns black into charcoal.Then Xiao LIULANG handed her a pair of copper cards with Zhouji bank engraved on them.\"I'm in the bank now. You need to get it yourself.\"Xiao LIULANG did not say the specific amount, Gu Jiao did not ask, she was also immersed in the violent mood of being given a brush.What Gu Jiao didn't know was that this Langhao pen was more expensive than other people's gifts. It wasn't something common like silver that could buy it.Gu Jiao didn't go on a rampage for long. She still remembers the business.Before leaving, Gu Jiao told Feng Lin to keep an eye on Xiao LIULANG and practice walking every day. Now she wants to check the results!Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG went to Westinghouse to see his ankle.The wound of the operation has been thin to almost invisible, Gu Jiao reached out and pinched: \"is it still painful?\"Xiao LIULANG shook his head: \"no pain.\"\"No pain at all?\" Gu Jiao looks up at him.He nodded, \"well.\"Gu Jiao pinches his legs and stomach again. It feels good. It seems that Feng Lin is not lazy.After nearly four months of rehabilitation, the weakened skin texture has basically recovered, that is to say, Xiao LIULANG has no weakness in his legs and feet.He still hasn't lost his crutch. The biggest problem may come from his psychology.Gu Jiao has seen many similar cases in her previous life, some of which are due to fear of secondary injury and excessive self-protection, but most of them will gradually fade away and get better with the passage of time.The other is more complicated.The patient has a heart knot.If he can't break that knot, he will always live in the state of injury, so as to punish himself or avoid something.Gu Jiao thinks about the gap, Xiao LIULANG has put down his trouser legs, clubbing crutches out.Gu Jiao looked at his cold and lonely back and couldn't help wondering what he had experienced?--Xiao LIULANG was admitted as a scholar and soon spread all over the country. As a big family in the village, Gu's family also heard the news.They really did not expect that Xiao LIULANG could take the first two exams in a row, and finally he was admitted to Yusheng.Mingming even Tianxiang academy almost failed to pass the entrance examination. How did he pass the entrance examination like Dashun?What's more, Xiao LIULANG's rice is obviously more valuable than Gu Dashun's. otherwise, the rice given to Xiao LIULANG would not be much better than Gu Dashun's?\"For the first two cases, only one is less than three yuan.\" At the dinner table, Gu Changlu said enviously.Was he born unwilling to read?noBut he couldn't read it. Later, he had two sons. He expected them to read it. However, the family who was willing to read it couldn't afford it. Gu Xiaoshun was the one who didn't win.Where does the Gu family know? It's not that Xiao LIULANG can't get into xiaosanyuan, it's that he gives up xiaosanyuan on his own initiative.The faces of all the people at the table were a little ugly.The most ugly one is Gu Dashun.Xiao LIULANG, who has always been looked down upon by himself, suddenly turned over and rode on his head. Gu Dashun was upset: \"with President Li personally guiding him, he made great progress. In the month before the county test, I saw president Li calling him to the central hall every day.\"He doesn't believe that Xiao LIULANG soared to the sky by his own ability. He is not as good as himself in terms of talent. If he was tutored by Dean li himself, he would surely get better results than Xiao LIULANG.To put it bluntly, he lost on resources.If in the past, the family attendants must have followed Xiao LIULANG, but tonight they didn't answer a word.This made Gu Dashun frown slightly.He felt that the atmosphere at home recently seemed to be different from before. Everyone looked worried, except Gu Xiaoshun.It's not surprising that he would think so. After the failure of Gu's idea, Gu Jiao's affair was completely destroyed.No matter what interrogation means the Marquis used, Huang Zhong just walked around the village and made Gu Jiao's experience from childhood to adulthood clear.This is the blood of the official family. Can you be bullied like this? Isn't that rubbing Marquis Gu's face on the ground?You can imagine the anger of marquis Gu.If it wasn't for the sake of Gu Jinyu and his wife, marquis Gu would have killed the family!But the death penalty can be avoided, and the living crime can not be escaped.Mr. Gu's life is just beginning.This is the most unjust time for Mr. Gu. He went to the family to have a drink, but when he came back, he lost his custody. He was still trapped by his mother-in-law and his son and daughter-in-law.As for Gu Jinyu, marquis Gu asked the Gu family to give up the custody of Gu Jinyu, and vowed that he would never appear in front of Gu Jinyu.In addition, he kept his mouth shut for Marquis Gu, and not a word was allowed to leak out.So even Gu Dashun and Gu Xiaoshun were kept secret.Gu Ershun overhears some, knowing that Gu Jiao may be holding the wrong child, but more he doesn't know.The above is one of the reasons for the strange atmosphere, and the second is that the female family members of the family went to the table for dinner.Gu Dashun is not used to it.Gu Dashun glanced at his sister Gu Yuee and thought of something. She said, \"I'm so lucky to marry a scholar.\"My sister is not young. It's time to marry her. If she marries a good family, it will help him.Gu Yuee sat down to eat without saying a word.Is it jiaoniang who is blessed? It's Xiao LIULANG! Does he know who he married? A thousand treasures of Hou's mansion!It's a good thing that falls from the sky!It's their carelessness to say that the marriage. If they had known that the girl had such a history, they would not have married her!Stay at home and be a cash cow. I don't know how much benefit I can get from Hou Fu!The caretaker's intestines are blue, but what can he do? That girl is no longer silly good fool, even if they want to repair the relationship is not so easy.Wu gave Liu a wink and asked her to hold the meat in the bowl.It's really big meat. Each piece is cut very thick. It's fat and straight oil. Only Gu Dashun can eat it in the future.Liu swallowed and picked up the thickest piece. She wanted to put it into ER Shun's bowl, but Wu's knife glared at her. She quickly put it into Gu Xiaoshun's bowl.Gu Xiaoshun looked at his mother strangely: \"why?\"Liu said: \"it's not easy for you to come back. Have some meat!\"Gu Xiaoshun lived in the Academy these days. Today, he was invited back by Gu Dashun.Gu Dashun didn't want to invite him, but his father had no choice.Gu Xiaoshun looked at the meat in the bowl and ate it without salt.Gu Ershun was so greedy.Gu Dashun frowned.The rest of us didn't see anything.Liu said with a smile, \"Xiaoshun, you haven't come back to your sister, have you?\"Gu Xiaoshun asked, \"why?\"Liu said with a smile, \"your sister is so kind to you. Why don't you go to see her when you come back?\"Gu Xiaoshun took a bite of rice: \"I'll go in a moment.\"Liu continued to smile: \"your brother-in-law was admitted to the scholar, you remember to say a few words of congratulations.\"Gu Xiaoshun: \"well.\"For a long time, Wu and Dafang were in a hurry.Gu Changhai said: \"Xiaoshun, uncle has prepared a can of good tea and two old hens. I will send them to your sister with you later.\"Gu Xiaoshun said, \"I'll go. What are you doing?\"I'm afraid you can't carry it!Gu Changhai is almost to be Gu Xiaoshun gas out of order, Gu Xiaoshun a rectum to the end, curved road words he can't understand.Gu Changhai simply opened the skylight to tell the truth: \"there is no overnight feud in the family. We did it wrong before, but now we compensate your sister. From today on, our family will have a good life. \"Marquis Gu only said that they were not allowed to Approach Gu Jinyu, but not Gu Jiao, as long as they did not reveal the truth to Gu Jiao.They can probably guess what Marquis Gu means, but they are afraid that Gu Jiao won't be able to accept it for a while, so they only need to get back together with her before they meet their father and daughter!\"You see that my brother-in-law is now admitted to the scholar's college. Do you want to flatter him?\" Gu Xiaoshun put chopsticks on the table lukewarm, \"where are the things?\"The former sentence makes people frown, but the latter one makes the family feel like a drama!Gu Changhai said to Zhou: \"go and get it quickly!\"Not daring to neglect, Zhou went to the house and caught the expensive tea and the fattest two hens in the family.Gu Xiaoshun put down his chopsticks, took things and went out.Gu Changhai held out his hand: \"ah! Wait for meI'll wait for you!You owe my sister!Gu Xiaoshun ran out of the house and went into his sister's house. He slammed the door shut!Gu Changhai, whose nose bleeds from the doorGu Changhai's tea and hen, which he gave up after spending all his money, are gone. He doesn't dare to make noise. Where can he argue?Gu Changhai wanted to knock on the door, but after knocking for a long time, no one paid attention to him, so he had to grit his teeth and go back.Gu Jiaocai can't take care of her family, and the old lady and Xiao LIULANG can't.It's not Gu Xiaoshun who presses the door. The old lady can make a basin for Gu's family on the spot!Gu Jiao is cooking in the kitchen.\"Sister.\" Gu Xiaoshun didn't go back to the village for a long time. He was worried about his sister. He rushed to the kitchen and said hello to Gu Jiao. Then he went to see Xiao LIULANG and the old lady.Xiao LIULANG gave him the knife he had brought from Pingcheng. Gu Xiaoshun liked it very much. He looked at every knife and couldn't put it down.A good sword is to a craftsman the same as a good sword is to a swordsman. The general gift of joy can't replace it.Gu Xiaoshun feels more and more that his brother-in-law is good.Gu Xiaoshun was playing with a knife when he was suddenly called to the house by the old lady.The old lady waved to him enthusiastically: \"Xiao Shun, try the sugar preserved dried bayberry LIULANG bought for me!\"Gu Xiaoshun blinked: \"how can my aunt be so generous today?\"It's more difficult to eat one of her preserves than to go to heaven.\"Here you are.\" The old lady scratched for a long time and gave him the smallest one.Gu Xiaoshun didn't choose, but put it into his mouth.The next second, he saw the old lady 1234567, counting seven big candied waxberry trunks and putting them into her small honeypot, and yelled: \"Jiaojiao! Xiaoshun ate me eight dried bayberry! \"\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGu Xiaoshun almost choked to death!For a few dried bayberry, how about you?!Gu Jiao is in charge of the old lady. She can eat three pills a day at most. She can only eat five during the Spring Festival. She can save seven at a time, which can be said to be a huge windfall!The old lady was very satisfied and asked Gu Xiaoshun what to do.Gu Xiaoshun's face is muddled, which makes him use of it?Gu Xiaoshun plans to find xiaojingkong, only to find that the little guy is out.Xiaojingkong went to walk the chicken.At first, he only strolled in his backyard, and slowly realized that the backyard was not enough, so he took the chickens out.Xiaojingkong's route is from his own home to the entrance of the village, and then back. If he meets villagers, he will greet them politely.Villagers from the initial surprise to now is used to, and even began to like the little monk.Other people's chickens run around when they go out of the door, and his chickens can even have formation.\"Xiao Qi, you can't jump in line.\" Xiaojingkong catches the chicken who sneaks to the fifth place.Xiaojingkong comes to Gu's old house, which is the only way to the village.He knew the relationship between the two families and would not go to take care of the family or greet the family members.Today, however, he was attracted by a strange sound.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: 87It seems to be the sound of men's reading, intermittent, every time to the same place will be stuck, and then read from the beginning.Xiaojingkong's obsessive-compulsive disorder is a little unbearable. He walks past the chicken and sees Gu Dashun's brow locked under a big tree outside his home.Xiaojingkong knew Gu Dashun, but he didn't talk to him. He didn't understand why Gu didn't study at home and ran down the tree.The family is quarreling about the tea and the old hen. Dafang has a bad idea. Gu Xiaoshun of Dafang messes upGu Dashun couldn't concentrate, so he came to hide under the tree. Unexpectedly, he found that he couldn't read a few words.\"Hide! I don't want to read this word Xiaojingkong stood behind him, looking at the words in his book.Suddenly, Gu Dashun was startled by the small milk sound. He turned his head and looked at xiaojingkong in surprise.Xiao Jingkong has been in the village for so long. He has heard about it and seen it from afar, but he has never communicated with it.Xiaojingkong saw that he was confused and thought he didn't understand. He read it again: \"you, Yintong, hide!\"Gu Dashun would not believe him. He turned his face lightly: \"don't talk nonsense if you don't understand.\"Xiaojingkong said: \"I'm not talking nonsense! I've learned itGu Dashun said, \"how could you have learned it?\"Xiaojingkong said: \"I can recite the heart mantra of Vajra Sakyamuni long ago!\"Gu Dashun looked at him suspiciously, pointed to another word and said, \"what about this?\"\"Oh\u2018 According to Prajna paramita, the Buddhas of the third generation have obtained the \"three Bodhisattvas of the third generation\"\u300a Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra He said with a small mouth, without a pause.Even if Gu Dashun didn't understand the Sutra, he also understood that such a difficult sentence could not have been made up by a three-and-a-half-year-old.So he really does.Later, Gu Dashun pointed out a few words to xiaojingkong, some of which he could and some of which he would not. Unexpectedly, xiaojingkong knew all of them and could accurately tell the source.Xiaojingkong looked at Gu Dashun with grief: \"how do you study? I heard that you are a scholar. Are they all so bad? \"Xiaojingkong suddenly remembered that his bad brother-in-law had just been admitted to the scholar's examination. Wouldn't he be so bad?How to support the family?Can you support yourself to grow up?Worried about the unsustainable little clearance at home, he suddenly lost the mood of walking chicken and brought all the children back home.He put the chicken back in the cage and immediately went to Westinghouse.He doesn't know how to write now, mainly because he has little strength and can't grasp the brush, but he has scriptures.He took out some scriptures from his small box and came to Xiao LIULANG. He opened a page and pointed to a rare word on it. He said, \"how can I read this?\"Xiao LIULANG glanced at him and read it faintly.Xiaojingkong frowned solemnly and nodded secretly.No mistake.Small clearance refers to another word, which is the first word that Gu Dashun didn't know.Xiao LIULANG read it out easily.\"Well.\" I'm satisfied with the small clearance.After that, he continued to test many words of Xiao LIULANG, and each of them was right.He also examined Xiao LIULANG's interpretation. Xiao LIULANG's interpretation is similar to master's, and even more concise and transparent than master's.It seems that the bad brother-in-law has studied hard, and the little clearance is a little relieved.Where does Xiao LIULANG know his little Jiujiu? And he suddenly wanted to read.The children in the town are seven years old, but xiaojingkong is smarter than ordinary children, and has a little foundation in temples. Maybe it's OK to send them to elementary school earlier.Xiao LIULANG secretly remembers xiaojingkong's enlightenment.--On the other hand, the injury of marquis Gu was basically healed.He didn't say that he was killed by his daughter. He just said that he fell down accidentally, and people were forced to believe him.Huang Zhong has received a letter from the capital for Lord Gu.After reading the letter, marquis Gu's brow gradually turned into a Sichuan character.Huang Zhong asked, \"what's the matter, marquis? Is something wrong with the Marquis's residence? \"Gu Hou Ye sighed: \"Hou Fu is OK. It's a letter from Shu Fei.\"Huang Zhong wondered, \"lady Shufei? She wants to see you? \"Marquis Gu reluctantly turned the letter back to the envelope: \"her birthday is coming. Jinyu's birthday is the same month as hers. She asked me when I would take Jinyu back to Beijing. This year is Jinyu's hairpin ceremony. Let me never forget it.\"Huang Zhong sighed: \"yes, in a twinkling of an eye, miss will be 15.\"\"It's half a year away,\" said Marquis GuThe twins are born in October.Huang Zhong smiles: \"lady Shufei must miss miss you.\"Shufei is the sister of marquis Gu. She has a good relationship with his wife. She is not very warm to Yao's steproom, and she is not cold to Gu Yan. Only Gu Jinyu has won her favor with her talent.Marquis Gu has a headache.He can't go back to Beijing now, and even if he does, he will take Yao and Gu Yan with him.After all, it was Jinyu's hairpin ceremony. How could she not be accompanied by her mother?Besides, he saw that Gu Yan's condition had greatly improved, and he could follow him back to Beijing.\"What about... Miss?\" Huang Zhong refers to Gu Jiao.\"Of course, I'll take it with me.\" Marquis Gu said.So decisive? Are you abusive?Huang Zhong Leng Leng: \"no blood test?\"Marquis Gu said: \"you have to hold it! Why don't you get it? \"Huang Zhong shrunk his neck: \"I dare not.\"Marquis Gu frowned and said: \"Yan'er is so close to her, it can't be wrong. As for the introduction of medicine, the medicine of huichuntang is effective for the time being, and it doesn't matter if the introduction of medicine is later. It's just\"Just what?\" Huang Zhong asked.Marquis Gu pondered for a moment, and said: \"the child grew up in the countryside, with bad habits, half of his words and deeds, and no manners of his daughter's family. When he returned to the capital, he was bound to be criticized. You have to find someone to teach her before you go back. \"Huang Zhong's eyes turned: \"did you... Skip any key steps? For example, miss may not like it herselfMarquis Gu dusted his sleeve: \"hum! Is there any room for her not to like this? I'm her father! Believe it or not, if I really want to take her away, can she do the opposite? \"Huang Zhongpai's mouth is curled. Who was it that Miss hung on the tree?Marquis Gu is not a fat man with a swollen face. What he worries about most is not Gu Jiao, but Yao.He didn't know how to talk to Yao in order to minimize the stimulation to Yao.\"And Madame?\" Asked Marquis Gu.Huang Zhong recalled: \"it's like the peony garden outside the hot spring. I saw my wife when I passed there just below.\"Yao is really in peony garden.After Gu Jinyu's peony was damaged, marquis Gu sent several peonies to Gu Jinyu, and built a new courtyard to make a peony garden for Gu Jinyu.This can also be regarded as the compensation for Gu Jinyu's loss of her servant girl Yuru.Gu Jinyu and Yao sat in the center of the peony garden playing chess: \"Niang, it's your turn.\"Yao is out of his mind.Gu Jinyu shook her hand in front of her eyes: \"Niang, Niang!\"Yao looked back and laughed apologetically: \"have you arrived? Let's see how to get there. \"Gu Jinyu took the chess piece she had just picked up and said in a warm voice, \"it's been a long time. You must be tired. Why don't you have a rest and have something to eat.\"\"Well.\" Yao nodded and asked the maid to remove the chessboard. She took a plate of fresh cut fruits and a box of Osmanthus cake she had made herself.Gu Jinyu ate some melons and fruits, and also tasted a small mouthful of sweet scented osmanthus cake.Yao can see that she doesn't want to eat much. The reason is that Jinyu's aunt Shufei once said that if she ate too many snacks, she would get fat.Jinyu didn't touch anything sweet and greasy after that.\"Niang, you look good recently.\" Gu Jinyu said to Yao with a smile.Yao touched his cheek.Yes, after using Gu's medicine, she felt much more relaxed. She could eat and sleep, and she was not so easily depressed.The only puzzling thing is that she has been thinking about Miss Gu recently. Just now, when she was distracted, she also thought of her.I shouldn't be so absent-minded when playing chess with my daughter.\"Niang, just a moment!\" Gu Jinyu put down the dim sum in his hand, stepped to the nearby wing room, took a cloak and put it on Yao's body, \"it's windy, be careful to catch cold.\"The daughter is considerate, but the daughter's considerate, Yao's shame.No one knows. There's always a secret in her heart.She used to hate Jinyu.She has loved Gu Yan more than Jin Yu since she was in confinement. When she looked at the baby in her infancy, she always felt that she could not be close to her.So when they were three years old, Gu Yan spilled a bowl of Medicine on Jin Yu. Jin Yu was so angry that she rushed over and threw Gu Yan on the ground and rode on Gu Yan.Gu Yan was overwhelmed.After she found out, she came and rudely pulled Jinyu away and slapped her with her backhand!Gu Yan is the first to move the hand, Jinyu counterattack is normal, not to mention are only three-year-old children.As a mother, she just separated the two children. There was no need to hit her.She still remembers Jinyu's surprised and injured eyes.Jinyu cried and called her mother, but she had to be heartbroken. On the contrary, she had an impulse to leave her!After such a long time, the two children lost their memory at that time, and she finally found her feelings for her daughter in her day-to-day relationship.It's just that when she thinks about it, she feels unworthy of being a mother.Everyone thinks that her heart trouble comes from her relationship with the Marquis and from the criticism of the world.Not really.As long as she thought of herself as a mother, she could not forgive herself for not loving her children or even abandoning them.Jinyu is a perfect child.Even if she had hurt her like that, she still respected herself, and was always bullying her brother.\"Mother, why are you crying?\" Gu Jinyu found Yao's tears.Yao Shi wiped tears, wry smile way: \"can you feel Niang these years... Not good enough to you?\"Gu Jinyu took Yao's hand and said solemnly, \"how can it be? My mother is very kind to me. Like my father and grandmother, you and my brother are my daughter's closest people in the world. My daughter will love you all her life. \"On the way back, Gu Jinyu was called away by the servant girl. Another peony arrived. She had to check the goods.Yao went back to the yard alone and didn't let the servant girls follow him.Passing by a rockery, Yao heard the sound of quarrel.\"You're not going to die? This kind of thing can be nonsense? Be careful that you will be told to the Marquis and his wife. It will kill you\"Auntie, I'm not talking nonsense! I heard it with my own earsYao recognized their voices, one was mother Fang in her yard, the other was mother Fang's cousin Cuicui.Cuicui is sweeping outside Lord Gu's study.The conversation continued, and Yao stopped.\"I'm afraid you didn't hear me wrong!\" Mother Fang scolded.Cuicui said in a loud voice, \"I heard you right! That's what Marquis said! Our miss is wrong! She was not born to the Lord and his wife! \"Yao only felt a slap in the head and said, \"what are you talking about? Who's wrong? \"\"Madame?\" Cui Cui and mammy Fang turned their heads and were stunned.Yao came to Cuicui in a dazed way: \"repeat what you just said. What's wrong? What is not natural? \"\"Madam, don't listen to her nonsense...\"\"Shut up!\" he saidYao is a gentle temperament, but when the rabbit is in a hurry, he sometimes bites.Cuicui lowered her head and hesitated: \"Miss... Is wrong. She is not the daughter of you and Mr. Hou. The real miss is a vagrant. She grew up in a village. She is ugly and stupid. She is often bullied. When Mr. Hou found her, she...\"Yao didn't hear the words behind. She felt that her eyes were black and she was whirling.Then she closed her eyes and fell heavily on the ground.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: 88Study.Marquis Gu was hesitating about how to open his mouth to Yao when he heard his servant report that Yao had fainted.During this period of time, Yao's family lived in xiaobie hospital and only came to visit Gu Yan and Gu Jinyu every day.When Marquis Gu arrived at xiaobie courtyard, Yao had been put on the bed by mother Fang and Cuicui.Mammy Fang is not in front of her because she has been affected by the cold in recent days. Mammy Fang takes care of the affairs in the yard. She went to the imperial doctor herself.Marquis Gu looked at the unconscious Yao family and the shivering servant girls in the room. His face sank: \"who is waiting on his wife today?\"Two servant girls plopped down on their knees.One of them cried: \"I don't know what happened... When I went back to the yard... My wife had fainted in the room!\"Marquis Gu snapped: \"how do you serve your wife? Let the lady be alone in the yard? \"Another servant girl could not cry and said: \"please forgive me, madam. I don't like to be followed... I dare not listen to you...\"\"A bunch of trash!\" When Marquis Gu was angry, mother Fang came with the imperial doctor.They were about to salute Marquis Gu. Marquis Gu waved his hand: \"don't have to. Hurry to treat your wife!\"\"Yes The imperial doctor came forward with a medicine box on his back, put a silk handkerchief on Yao's wrist and began to feel her pulse.To be honest, the royal doctor is not optimistic about Yao's condition.Yao was not seriously ill. In fact, she had already exhausted her body. Meanwhile, she had heart disease. She could not be stimulated most. When it was serious, she might have illusions and madness, and did something irreparable.Marquis Gu is afraid of such a situation, has been hesitant to tell the truth.The imperial doctor felt the pulse for a long time.After a long time, the cold sweat of marquis Gu came out.\"What's the matter, Doctor Chen?\" He asked anxiously.Mother Fang also looked nervously at Doctor Chen.Chen Yu Yi frowned thoughtfully and caught Yao's pulse again: 'strange, really strange.\"Marquis Gu said quickly, \"what's strange? Is it serious, madamChen Yuyi shook his head: \"it's not serious.\"Yao's body has been very empty, and can not be stimulated, general syncope will be very dangerous, but Yao's pulse at this time is more stable than imagined.That's why he was surprised.\"What medicine is madam taking recently?\" Asked the doctor.Marquis Gu looked at mammy Fang.Mammy Fang was stunned and said, \"isn't that the medicine you prescribed?\"Chen Yu said: \"take it away and show it to me.\"\"Well Mother Fang came to the dressing table, opened Yao's medicine box, and took Yao's small medicine bottle and medicine jar to the royal doctor.The small medicine bottle is filled with white pills, colorless and tasteless. Doctor Chen has never seen this kind of medicine.Inside the medicine jar were small bottles of granules. Chen Yu Yi had never seen this kind of medicine, but he smelled the familiar smell of traditional Chinese medicine. He could vaguely recognize the smell of ginseng, Zizyphus jujuba, Poria cocos, cinnamon, asparagus and rehmannia.\"Can medicine be made like this?\" Doctor Chen murmured.He has only seen pills made of medicine, but has not seen tablets and granules made of medicine, especially the white tablets, which can not identify the ingredients at all.\"Where do these medicines come from?\" Asked Doctor Chen.Mammy Fang looked at Doctor Chen in amazement: \"didn't you open it?\"Doctor Chen Yu said, \"I haven't prescribed these medicines.\"Gu Hou Ye's cold eyes fell on mammy Fang: \"when did madam begin to take these medicines?\"Mammy Fang explained in a hurry: 'specifically... I can't remember clearly. It's been a while. The lady used to refuse to take medicine well. She suddenly took it. The maid thought it was the lady who finally listened to the advice of Doctor Chen. \"\"Is it these medicines that make Madame unconscious?\" Marquis Gu asked Doctor Chen.Doctor Chen pondered: \"it's hard to say... The tranquilizer in the medicine jar should have no harm to the body. I haven't seen another kind of pill. I dare not say it in vain. \"Marquis Gu looked coldly at mother Fang: \"who gave these things to his wife?\"Mother Fang said with a pale face: \"I don't know. Although I'm in front of my wife, it's mother Fang who serves me the most.\"Mammy Fang has gone to take care of her illness. She is not in the villa!Marquis Gu clenched his fist and said, 'send someone to call mother Fang for me!\"Doctor Chen thought about it and said, \"don't worry, marquis. Madam's pulse condition is better than before. Maybe these two kinds of medicine are harmless to madam.\"Gu Hou Ye cold voice way: \"that how explain the madam suddenly coma?\"\"This...\" Doctor Chen couldn't explain, \"my wife should wake up soon. After a while, I can tell the truth by asking her.\"Mother Fang lowered her head and pinched her fingers little by little.Doctor Chen gave a prescription, and mother Fang took it to the pharmacy of the villa.While cooking medicine in the small kitchen, Cuicui sneaks in through the back door.\"Auntie!\"Mother Fang looked out warily, closed the door and said to her, \"Why are you here?\"Cuicui said in a low voice: \"Huang Zhong suddenly went to find mammy Fang. What's the matter?\"Mother Fang narrowed her eyes and said, \"my wife is taking medicine recently. I've taken it well.\"\"What? It's not to say that if you stimulate her, she will... \"Yao was stimulated. At that time, Yao's illness was not so serious, but he was almost not rescued. I thought it was safe this time. How could I expect\"Lady Shufei's letter has arrived. Let the Marquis take the young lady back to Beijing for a trip and hairpin ceremony. The little childe's illness has improved. The marquis will certainly take his wife and the little childe back...\" mother Fang said, her cold eyes falling on the steaming medicine can.\u2026\u2026Huang Zhong went to mother Fang's home and brought her back to the villa.Marquis Gu personally went to the study to question her.There were only two servant girls on duty in the room.Mother Fang took the steaming soup and medicine into the room and said to the two people, \"OK, I'll guard here. You go to the dining room to see if the porridge for your wife is ready, and the fruit for your lady. Don't forget to send it to Lanting Pavilion.\"\"Yes.\" The two servant girls stepped back.There was no third person in the room, and the silence was terrible.Mammy Fang came to the bed step by step with the medicine bowl. She looked down at the sleeping Yao and said with disdain, \"madam, don't blame the maidservant. It's just that someone doesn't want you to go back to the Marquis's house.\"Mother Fang pries Yao's chin open and pours down the medicine in the bowl one by oneToday is the day of huichuntang's return visit to Gu Yan.The second owner didn't come, but Gu Jiao and the old doctor.They are directly taken to Gu Yan's yard by Yu ya'er.Gu Yan's condition is very stable now. As long as he continues to take medicine, he will live for another two or three years.The dog's injury also healed. He still remembers Gu Jiao. He went all the way to rush at her with his short legs, only to fall down and groan.Gu Jiao thought of the total wrestling small clearance.\"The dog house broke down last time. Let's make another one.\" Gu Yan said without changing his face.Gu Jiao gave a strange hum. The house she built is very strong. How could it be broken?People bowed their heads one after another, pretending that they didn't know that the young master pulled down the dog house in the middle of the night.\"All right.\" Gu Jiao should go down.It's nothing to do with one more.Gu Jiao stayed with Gu Yan for an hour, finished the new dog house, and then got up to leave.After leaving the villa, she went to visit old lady Li as usual.When visiting old lady Li, she saw the mulberry tree and couldn't help thinking of Yao. She planned to see if Yao's condition had improved.However, Gu Jiao went there and knocked for a long time, but no one answered.Maybe not.Or maybe something else can't go away.Gu Jiao decided to come back next time.But just as she turned around, her ears moved and she heard a very painful groan.The voice is small and far away, and most people can't hear it. But Gu Jiao's training in her previous life included listening to sounds and recognizing positions. She had to be ready to recognize each other's breathing sounds under the interference of hundreds of sounds.After changing this pair of small body, her physical quality is not as good as her previous life, but it is gradually recovering.The voice is Mrs. Hou's.Gu Jiao can be sure of this.Gu Jiao at the moment, regardless of whether the door is closed or not, stepped back a few steps and jumped into the wall.When Gu Jiao came to Yao's house, there was only Yao left.Yao lay in a coma on the bed, his face turned blue and his seal hall turned black, and his breath was very weak.There was a strong smell of traditional Chinese medicine in the room, but there was no medicine bowl.Gu Jiao found a few drops of medicine juice on Yao's pillow. She leaned over to smell it.It's Aconitum!Aconitum is a traditional Chinese medicine for dispersing cold and relieving pain, but it is toxic and will not be used easily. Yao's constitution is too cold to be contaminated with Aconitum.Gu Jiao is not sure how much Yao drank, but she must spit it out as soon as possible!Gu Jiao pondered for three seconds, immediately opened the small medicine box, took a special material infusion tube from Yao's nose and slowly inserted it into Yao's stomach.This kind of infusion tube is specially prepared for those outlaws in the organization. It's harder than ordinary infusion tube. It could have been used to kill people. Gu Jiao didn't expect that she would use it to save people.Gu Jiao took out a sodium chloride rehydration, connected to the other end of the hose.She grabbed the bag and quickly poured the rehydration into Yao's stomach.One bag was soon filled. When Gu Jiao began to fill the second bag, the two little maids who were supported by mother Fang went back to the house.Two people don't know Gu Jiao, immediately be in front of a scene scared silly eyes.\"Who are you? What are you doing to your wife? \"Two people return to God, toward Gu Jiao rushed in the past.Gu Jiao can't be interrupted by them. A stool is raised on the tip of her foot and they are knocked over on the ground.Little servant girl a: \"ah --\"Little servant girl b: \"it's coming! Someone's going to murder his wife -- \"Outside, mother Fang shook her hand, didn't she? So soon?As soon as the Marquis Gu finished his interrogation, Mammy Fang heard the cry of the little servant girl. He went to Yao's house as fast as he could, and saw Gu Jiao pouring strange things into Yao's nose.When he left, Yao's face was still normal, but now he turned blue and black, as if he had been poisoned.The girl... Is she poisoning her own mother?!Marquis Gu was so angry that he went over and said, 'stop it!\"Gu Jiao ignored him, increased the strength of the squeeze rehydration.Seeing that she didn't listen, marquis Gu stepped up. He was so angry that he took out the whip from his waist and beat Gu Jiao's thin back.Then he heard the sound of a whip, and the whip fell on Gu Jiao's back.It's not an ordinary whip. It's an execution whip.Gu Jiao still did not let Yao go.Marquis Gu gritted his teeth in anger and reached for Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao's cold eyes came: \"if you don't want her to die, get out of my way!\"Marquis Gu was shocked by her eyes and murderous spirit.The last drop of rehydration is also poured in. Gu Jiao pulls out the infusion tube, lifts Yao up, pries Yao's mouth open, and picks her throat with her fingers.The next second, Yao's body was shocked, and he vomited the medicine juice and rehydration together.After vomiting, Yao's face is no longer blue, breathing also has a little strength.Meanwhile, Doctor Chen also arrived.He just went to pinch pills for Mrs. Hou. Why did he leave for a short time? Mrs. Hou seemed to have died once?\"Well? Isn't this the little medicine boy of huichuntang? \" He recognized Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao did not speak, lightly stood up, put away his small medicine box.Chen Yuyi finished the pulse for Yao Shi and frowned: \"how did madam get the poison of Aconitum?\"Marquis Gu frowned!Doctor Chen looked at Gu Jiao and the medicine juice on the ground, and almost guessed what was going on: \"fortunately, the Marquis asked the little medicine boy to vomit for his wife in time, otherwise she would die. I didn't expect that a little drug boy in huichuntang was so powerful... \"Later, marquis Gu didn't listen. His mind was full of the whip he had just given her.He used 100% of the strength of the whip, but 80% of itStubborn girl, can't you say it well?Have to be whipped?!Marquis Gu never admitted that he had a wrong number. It was because she didn't explain that she misunderstood him!But why do you feel a little weak in your heart?Marquis Gu looks at Gu Jiao with a guilty heart, and is about to say something, but Gu Jiao has gone out with a small medicine box on her back and no expression on her face.The wind in late spring is warm, but her back is cold.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: 89Marquis Gu began to order a thorough investigation of Yao's poisoning.According to the two little servant girls, the medicine was cooked by mother Fang and sent by mother Fang. They were sent by mother Fang to send things to Gu Jinyu. What happened after that was not clear.\"Call mother Fang!\" Marquis Gu gave orders in a cold voice.After a while, a servant came to report: \"back to Marquis, mother Fang is gone!\"The big palm of marquis Gu suddenly became a fist.Soon, he thought of mother Fang's niece and daughter-in-law: \"what about the maid named Cuicui? Bring her to the Marquis! \"\"Yes I'm on my way.Mother Fang didn't take Cuicui away in order not to attract people's attention.When Cuicui realized that something seemed wrong, she quickly picked up her burden and left. Unfortunately, she was a little late and was caught by the guards of the villa.When she was brought to Marquis Gu, she realized that Yao was poisoned.Who is the person who poisoned? You can guess it's mother Fang with your toes.Cui Cui fell on her knees and trembled: \"please forgive me! It's not a slave! I don't know anything! The slave is unjustMarquis Gu said: \"wronged? How did your wife faintCuicui hesitated and said: \"yes... Yes...\"Marquis Gu sneered: \"well, it's useless to keep this tongue. It's better to pull it out!\"Cui Cui's body was shocked: 'said the maid! Maidservant says everything! It's mammy Fang... Mammy Fang asked the maidservant to do it! She asked the maid to tell her wife what she had overheardGu Hou Ye's heart was tight: \"what did you say?\"Cuicui was afraid and said: \"just... I said... Miss is not born... She is wrong...\"\"Son of a bitch!\" Marquis Gu was so angry that he broke his tea cup!Cuicui crawls on the fragments of the tea cup, her hands are bleeding, but she doesn't dare to move: \"master, please forgive me... It's mammy Fang who forced me to...\"Marquis Gu was worried about this, so he didn't dare to tell Yao the truth. He would rather not recognize the child all his life than Miss Yao a little!But he was careful, but let two cheap maids poke the truth out!He said harshly: \"Madam treats her well! Why did she do that? \"Cuicui sobbed: \"I don't know... Aunt... It's not... It's mother Fang... She let me do things... I never allowed me to ask why... I don't know why she framed my wife... If I didn't listen to her, she would let her nephew kill me! Marquis Ming Jian, what I said is true\"Oh, you listen to her more than to the Marquis and his wife. Why? Is her words an edict When Marquis Gu comes to this, how can he not see that Cui Cui's words are half true and half false.It's true that she was instructed by mother Fang, but her prodigal ambition is even more true. How could she work for mother Fang if she didn't covet the benefits that mother Fang promised her?She should not be able to ask anything here. Marquis Gu waved his hand in disgust: \"drag it down and beat it to death.\"\"Lord, spare your life! Hou yerao -- \"The bodyguard didn't give her a chance to walk around. He blocked her mouth with a rag and dragged her down to execution.The guards of the mountain villa went to capture mother Fang in four ways. When it was dark, they finally found her trace. Unfortunately, mother fang had already hanged herself on a big tree.\"Dead?\" In the study, marquis Gu's face was cold.Huang Zhong is a martial arts man. He is intrigued. He lacks a clue. However, if we want to examine the corpses, he has been among the dead. He has seen countless deaths. How can we not see that mammy Fang was hung on the tree after she died?Marquis Gu looked dignified: 'so... She was silenced?\"Huang Zhong didn't dare to say anything, but he was sure that mammy Fang was killed by him.Marquis Gu was silent for a long time: \"I know. You strengthen the guard of the villa these days. Except for mammy Fang, all the others are sent away.\"\"YesMarquis Gu went to Yao's house.Mammy Fang was sick and kept in the house. She didn't look well.Marquis Gu said to her, \"go and have a rest. You don't have to come here tonight.\"But mammy Fang didn't withdraw immediately. Instead, she hesitated and said boldly, \"Marquis, do you have to take your wife back to Beijing?\"\"What's the matter?\" Asked Marquis Gu.Mammy Fang said earnestly: \"I know that the Houfu dotes on his wife, but in addition to the houye, I'm afraid no one will welcome her back.\"Marquis Gu clenched his fist: 'she is the wife of marquis. I will protect her. Don't worry about it!\"\"Master hou...\"Marquis Gu's eyes are burning: \"I won't let anything happen to her again!\"Mammy Fang didn't retort any more. She bowed to Marquis Gu: \"I'm leaving.\"Marquis Gu blocked the news of Yao's yard, and didn't let Gu Yan and Gu Jinyu know.An hour later, Yao youyou woke up.Marquis Gu sat by the bed, took her hand and asked softly, \"are you awake? Is there anything wrong? \"Yao shook his head weakly and looked at him steadily: \"where's the child? Where is my child? \"At this point, marquis Gu has nothing to hide. He clenched her hand and took a deep breath: 'she just came here, right here.\"Yao was excited again.For fear that she would faint again, marquis Gu quickly held her shoulders and said, \"don't get excited. Listen to me. She's fine. I've found her. When you get well, I'll take you to see her. \"Yao said: \"I'm fine!\"Marquis Gu said, \"I know, I know. It's just too late today. You used to disturb her. Tomorrow morning, I promise you.\"Yao just lay back.She looked at him puzzled: \"why didn't you tell me earlier?\"Marquis Gu was silent.Yao frowned: \"don't you want to recognize that child?\"Marquis Gu was so scared that his liver trembled. His great desire for survival made him decide between confessing and lying: \"nothing! Don't think about it! She is my own flesh and blood, how can I not want to recognize her? It's just... I've been wrong once, and I don't want to be wrong again. \"Marquis Gu told Yao about the drug introduction.\"... I want to tell you after I get her blood and merge with Yan'er. But Yan'er and she get along very well. I don't think Yan'er would like her so much if she wasn't connected by blood. \"Yao's expression is one Zheng: \"Yan son also met her?\"Marquis Gu nodded slowly: \"yes, she is the little medicine boy in the rejuvenation hall.\"\"Do you have a picture of her?\" Yao can't wait to see his daughter.Marquis Gu hesitated: \"this...\"\"Please, marquis.\" Yao begged him for the first time.Just for the portrait of a smelly girl, marquis Gu has a bad feeling in his heart.But Marquis Gu still insisted on painting. It seems that he can never refuse Yao.However, when Yao opened the picture with excitement, his smile froze: \"what are you painting?\"Circle fork, circle fork?!Is this round and square pie a face?Is two asymmetry small mung bean an eye?Is nostril connected to the sky?And the mouth is also crooked!Marquis Gu coughed awkwardly and said seriously, 'she's ugly.\"Never admit that you painted ugly!The brilliant Marquis Gu always has an unknown secret, that is, his calligraphy and painting are poor. Outsiders only say that Marquis Gu's calligraphy is not available, but they don't know that he is afraid to be seen.\"You're ugly!\" Yao threw the painting back into his arms, lifted the quilt and got out of bed.At a glance, marquis Gu guessed what she wanted to do and said, \"are you going to find Yan'er for a portrait? Hehe, he can't draw as well as I can. \"I really want to kill YaoYao finally got the portrait of his daughter.It was painted by Gu Jinyu.Marquis Gu didn't tell Gu Jinyu the truth. He just asked her to draw the appearance of the little drug boy. Gu Jinyu was very good at painting, and could at least rank in the top three of the expensive women in the whole capital.Marquis Gu took the portrait to Yao.When Yao saw the little girl in the picture, he was stunned.Now it's getting dark. When Gu Jiao returns to the village, the sun has not yet gone down. The village is full of smoke and the smell of food.Gu's family is very quiet recently.It is said that Mr. Gu's position as Li Zheng has been lost, and his family's tens of mu of tenancy fields have been taken away. Those tenancy fields were originally allocated to the Gu family, saying that they were tenancy fields. However, the annual rent is only a hundred jin, which is no different from free gifts.This is not only the light of Mr. Gu, but also the light of Gu Dashun.Now, however, it's all gone.The days of taking care of one's family have become more and more difficult.It's said that Gu Dashun's shuxiu is almost out of hand.But this has nothing to do with Gu Jiao, who is too lazy to pay attention to them.Gu Jiao's back has some hot pain. She doesn't care much and goes to the kitchen to cook dinner.Xiaojingkong squatted in the backyard to feed the chickens. Half way through, he grabbed a little yellow chicken and came over: \"Jiaojiao, Jiaojiao, Xiaoqi doesn't eat! Is it sick? \"\"I said you can't raise chickens. Look, you're going to raise them to death.\"It's Xiao LIULANG's joking voice.Xiaojingkong angrily turned his head and stamped: \"I didn't! Xiao Qi won't die! I have to take good care of it\"Show me.\" Gu Jiao reaches out her hand.Xiaojingkong wrongfully puts Xiaoqi in Gu Jiao's palm.His mouth said confident words, but his eyes were a little red.It can be seen that the little guy is sincere. Xiao Qi will be raised to death by himself.Gu Jiao touched the chicken's stomach and said with a smile, \"it's full and can't eat any more.\"\"Ah?\" Xiaojingkong looked at the chicken with big black eyes, scratched his head, and asked, \"Xiaoqi, are you robbing again?\"Chicken: \"Gee!\"Xiaojingkong took back the chicken, rushed his brother-in-law to spit out his tongue, and put Xiaoqi back into the chicken cage.Xiao LIULANG takes a funny look at him. His eyes turn to Gu Jiao's face and find that her face is paler than usual.\"Dinner's ready. Let's eat.\" Gu Jiao said.Xiao LIULANG pause: \"good.\"At dinner, Gu Jiao had a bad appetite.Xiaojingkong holds the bowl and chopsticks and asks her, \"Jiaojiao, are you full, too?\"Xiao LIULANG gave her a complicated look.The old lady looked at her, too.Gu Xiaoshun also raised his head and said in amazement: \"elder sister, is your face so ugly? Are you sick? \"Xiaojingkong put down the dishes and chopsticks, got up and stood on the stool: \"nonsense! Jiao Jiao won't get sick! \"\"I'm not sick.\"It's true that I didn't get sick. I should have been hurt.Pain is painful, but this kind of pain she had been used to in her previous life, she didn't pay attention at all. She forgot that the base of her body was so strong that she couldn't stand the whip of a general?At night, Gu Jiao's condition worsened.The dark sky flashed and thundered, lighting the room up and down.The little headroom on the bed was lying on his little pillow, drooling.Xiao LIULANG opened his eyes, looked at the direction of the door, hesitated for a while, sat up, first pulled up the quilt for Xiao Jingkong, then put on his coat and went to Gu Jiao's house.Gu Jiao used to lock the door. Once upon a time, Xiao Jingkong was awakened by a nightmare in the middle of the night. She came to her with a pillow, but she couldn't open the door. She was scared and cried for a long time.After that, Gu Jiao did not lock the door.Xiao LIULANG pushed open the door of the room, and there was a faint smell of blood.Xiao LIULANG frowned. After a pause, he stepped into the room.\"Gu... Gu Jiao.\"He called her and didn't respond, so he came to the bed.He reached out and touched Gu Jiao's forehead. It was very hot!Another flash of lightning started and made the room as bright as day. Xiao LIULANG saw the blood clothes on the chair.His face changed. He picked up the blood coat and found it was a small one.Not soft cheap material, once honed on her delicate skin, the cover of blood smell exudes a girl's fragrance.Xiao LIULANG red ears to see the blood position, make sure Gu Jiao is injured in the back, he took a deep breath, intend to turn Gu Jiao over, and then go to ask a doctor to come over.As soon as his hand approached Gu Jiao, he was caught by Gu Jiao's cold little hand.She tugged to say: \"do not sleep in the middle of the night, want to take advantage of me ah.\"Xiao LIULANG was embarrassed and explained: \"no, I am...\"\"Not too much.\" Gu Jiao said vaguely and fell asleep.So... Is it a dream talk?Xiao LIULANG breathed a little, and his cold sweat seeped out.However, this is not the most terrible.He turned his head inadvertently, and another flash of lightning started, which showed the old lady's gloomy little figure at the door.His hair is standing up!The old lady came into the room without expression and put a bottle of acne medicine on Gu Jiao's desk.Xiao LIULANG's back clothes are all wet.He couldn't tell whether he was more afraid or more guilty.After all, his hand was still on her chest. Although she pulled him over, it seemed that he had taken the initiative.\"Don't get me wrong, aunt...\"\"Isn't it the couple? What's wrong? \"The old lady put down the medicine and snorted out.Damn it!Black moon and high wind!Don't give her the whole great grandson!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: 90Where does Xiao LIULANG know the old lady's inner drama? I don't know where she came from. But when she was thinking about something, Gu Jiao's condition was very serious. She had to be cured immediately.Although they shared the same bed, they were all in the condition of complete clothes. Now, he had to lift up her clothes.Xiao LIULANG calmed down, turned her over gently and let her sleep on her stomach.His slender fingertips, with a slight tremor, stirred up her slightly hot profanity and slowly lifted it a little.The whip mark was very long, extending from her looming right waist to her left shoulder.He had to lift all her clothes up to show her clean back.Her hands on the pillow, she was pressed out of the beautiful shape of a girl.In order to see her injury, Xiao LIULANG lights an oil lamp in the room, but Xiao LIULANG's eyes inadvertently fall on the wrong place.He was short of breath. He quickly turned his face and did not dare to look at it.After calming down again, he dipped cool ointment into his fingertips and daubed it on her whiplash.It's really ferocious. It doesn't look like the ordinary whip.She doesn't seem to be bullied. At least she isn't now. Xiao LIULANG can't help but wonder how she got hurt and who did she get into trouble with?And she didn't care at all, as if she was used to it.Although she has been bitter since she was young, she has not been beaten at all times.Xiao LIULANG is full of doubts. After applying the medicine, he finds a clean cloth to cover her wound. After that, he puts down his clothes and covers her quilt.After that, he planned to go back to the house, but he kicked something as soon as he got up.There was a thump, like a box falling to the ground, and then the things in it rolled all over the ground.Xiao LIULANG picked up the small wooden box and put it on the table. He also picked up the things on the ground and put them on the table one by one. Then he was a little confused when he looked at the things piled up on the whole table.\"What are these things?\"\"And how can there be so many?\"These strange things spread all over the table. I don't know how a small broken box can hold it?On the day when Gu Jiao fell into the water for the first time, he came to Gu Jiao's house to look for something. He was absolutely sure that she didn't have the box at that time.First, the inexplicable injury, and then the strange box, how many secrets does she hide?Xiao LIULANG looked at Gu Jiao with a complicated look. Suddenly he was a little irritable, but he couldn't say what he was irritable about.But he didn't have the habit of investigating people's privacy. He didn't study the drugs on the table and put them back into the small medicine box one by one.After loading, he felt magical. What kind of box can be loaded.Now he's really going back to the house.But he didn't put the small medicine box steady, and the small medicine box clattered and fell off the table.The contents rolled out again.However, it's amazing that the things that fall out this time seem to be different from those just now!\"Is it me or...\"Xiao LIULANG looked at the drugs on the ground strangely and doubted his eyes for the first time.He packed the things back and planned to knock the box over and verify it again. But all of a sudden, Gu Jiao on the bed turned over, pressed the wound, and made a painful gibberish.Xiao LIULANG's action, suddenly realized that he turned the box in the middle of the night seems not right. With a sigh, he put the box back on the table and turned back to the room.The next day, Xiao LIULANG got up early.Gu Jiao's fever subsided most of the time, but she was too tired, so she was still sleeping.Xiao LIULANG didn't wake him up. He went to the kitchen to make breakfast and told the old lady. Then he went to the Academy.On the other side of the villa, Yao, who had been waiting all night, couldn't wait for Marquis Gu to bring her to the village.It's small clearance that opens the door.In the countryside, the door is usually not locked, but today Gu Jiao is sleeping. In case of being disturbed, Xiao Jingkong just put the bolt on the door.Xiaojingkong pokes out a small round head from the crack of the door and looks curiously at Yao and Marquis Gu at the door.Yao is a beautiful benefactor who always goes to the temple to offer incense.He knew Marquis Gu, and he was the villain who ordered him and Jiaojiao to be taken away!The two of them are togetherXiaojingkong thought seriously and asked, \"benefactor, have you been arrested by him too?\"Yao's face was puzzled.Marquis Gu was embarrassedLast night, Yao let Marquis Gu say a lot about Gu Jiao, but how dare Marquis Gu tell her all at once? At least did not say that they let people to Gu Jiao and her side of a small doll to catch.Afterwards, he inquired that the doll was a child adopted by Gu Jiao from the temple.I can't keep myself alive, and I've got a little oil bottle. I don't know what this girl thinks!Yao didn't understand xiaojingkong's words, but she vaguely remembered that this was the little monk in the temple. She squatted down and looked at xiaojingkong gently: \"I remember you. You are the little master in the temple. What's your name?\"Xiaojingkong blinked her big black eyes and said, \"my name is Jingkong! I'm not a little master now. I'm going down the mountain! \"Yao touched his little head with a little hair and said with a gentle smile, \"I'm looking for Jiaojiao. Is Jiaojiao at home?\"Xiaojingkong was surprised: \"well, you know Jiaojiao, too?\"Yao nodded: \"yes, I know her.\"Xiaojingkong drooped his head and said sadly, \"you may not see her today. She is ill and can't see the guests.\"Yao immediately worried: \"why is she sick?\"\"My aunt said she was too tired.\" Xiaojingkong thought about it and said to himself, \"it must be that I'm tired of raising you.\"After all, I eat so much.Marquis Gu is a little guilty. I'm afraid the girl was not hurt by his whip yesterday?He didn't dare to tell Yao about itYao looked at xiaojingkong in an urgent voice, but his voice was very light: \"can I go in and have a look at her? I promise not to disturb her. \"\"I'm not sure if Jiao Jiao wants to see you. You wait. I'll ask her.\" Xiaojingkong closed the door, ran into the room, came to Gu Jiao's bed, and asked softly, \"Jiao Jiao, the benefactor of the temple has come to see you. Do you want to see her?\"Gu Jiao is sleeping soundly!After a while, xiaojingkong opened the door and said to Yao, \"well, Jiaojiao has no objection. You can go in!\"Yao entered the room full of excitement.Marquis Gu also wants to enter the house.Xiaojingkong put out a small hand to stop him: \"you can't enter.\"Marquis Gu frowned: \"why?\"Xiaojingkong raised her chin: \"Jiaojiao didn't promise to let you in again!\"Marquis Gu is fascinated.Is this her answer? You black hearted little monk didn't ask at all, did you?Marquis Gu said solemnly, \"if you have the ability, ask again! I don't believe she can object! \"People don't wake up. How can they object?Small clearance thought: \"OK.\"Xiaojingkong ran into the room and said, \"jiaojiaojiao, the bad guy is coming to see you. Do you want to see him?\"What is a bad guy?That wench oneself annoy person even if, raise a little monk also so annoy person?Marquis Gu's face is black!Xiaojingkong grabbed Gu Jiao's hand and shook it: \"I know, you don't agree!\"He walked out with high spirits and said to Marquis Gu, \"Jiaojiao refused you!\"Marquis GuIn order not to let someone intrude, xiaojingkong directly moved a small bench and sat at the door, gazing at Mr. Gu.Marquis Gu: \"what are you doing?\"Small clearance: 'staring at you.\"Marquis Gu: \"hum, I won't go in!\"Small clearance: \"who knows?\"Marquis Gu: \"if you don't believe me, just plug in the latch!\"\"What if you go over the wall? I'll keep an eye on you to prevent you from doing bad things! \"Marquis Gu: anyway, I'm also Marquis Ding'an of the capital. Has my reputation been checked to the point where I need a little monk to stare at me?One big one small, so big eyes stare small eyes, confrontation in the door.Yao can't take care of her husband now. Her heart has been filled with Gu Jiao.After entering the room, she sat down directly beside Gu Jiao's bed.Gu Jiao's face was much stronger than that of last night, but she was still a little morbid pale.The so-called disease in the body, pain in the heart of the mother, Yao watched his child become so sick, heart pumping up.Look at the room where she lives, Yao's eyes are red.Yao held her hand again. The cocoon and wound on her hand made Yao's palm ache.Yao could no longer help sobbing silentlyAfter sleeping in the room, the old lady woke up and planned to see how Gu Jiao was doing. As soon as she entered the main room, she saw little headroom sitting at the door like a small stone statue.\"Why? Didn't you go out? \"The old lady wondered.Although xiaojingkong is only a three-year-old, he is very busy every day.He continued the habit of doing morning and evening classes in the temple. When he got up, he would read Buddhist scriptures in his heart. After reading, he went to practice in the woods behind the house.Once the old lady came out and saw him holding his feet with both hands and encircling herself on a big tree. She almost thought she had seen the little snake demon!He practiced basic skills. Occasionally Gu Jiao would practice with him, and he would practice without anyone to accompany him.After practicing kung fu, he would go to his village friends, come back for lunch and help Gu Jiao with her work in the afternoon.It's time for him to go to the village to make trouble for his friends.Xiaojingkong replied: \"Jiaojiao is ill. I want to accompany her.\"No one is allowed to disturb his schedule, only Jiaojiao can.This answer is not unexpected, the old lady oh a, eyes over him, fell on the strange man at the door.\"Who is that?\" She asked faintly.Xiaojingkong held back the \"three words\" of the big villain, because she promised Jiaojiao not to tell her family about their being taken away, so as not to worry her aunt and bad brother-in-law.\"One person.\" Little clearance said in disgust.Old lady: can't I see this man?The old lady didn't think much about it and walked towards the door.At this time, marquis Gu also noticed the old lady coming towards him.Marquis Gu's current situation is clear and clear. He not only knows that she has adopted a young monk, but also knows that she has picked up a lame husband and an aunt who has come to join them.My aunt belongs to the man's family.No, she is so poor. Why is she always picking up people at home?Can you pick up a first assistant or a empress dowager?How many catties do you have in mind?Thinking of this, marquis Gu was very angry.However, when the old lady came close and he saw the other person's face clearly, it was not that she was out of breath, but that she was out of breath at all!\"Ma'am, ma'am...\"Empress Dowager?Marquis Gu's knees softened and he fell on the threshold with a big somersault!The old lady looked at the stranger who fell at her feet. She felt her chin when she met him for the first timeXiaojingkong turned his head and said, \"I'm here to find Jiaojiao. The benefactor has already gone in. I'm here to keep him from going in!\"It's OK not to let a man into the house. The old lady didn't doubt that there was him. She didn't bother to ask who Marquis Gu was. She yawned and went to the backyard to eat melon seeds.Marquis Gu got up with his nearly fallen head.From his point of view, we can clearly see the old lady sitting on the bench outside the back door of the hall. She is dressed in the clothes of a countryman, and her head is wrapped in an old village woman's turban.From this point of view, marquis Gu didn't feel like that again.Empress Dowager Zhuang married the former Emperor at the age of 13 and was granted virtuous title when she entered the palace. She has been dominating the latter palace for several decades and listening to politics behind the curtain for 17 years. Although she did not give birth to a son and a half daughter for the former Emperor, her majesty today supports the throne of God with her own hand. Her status is unshakable both in the latter palace and in the court.Most people don't see the Empress Dowager Zhuang.Marquis Gu had the honor to meet her twice, once at the Palace Banquet of Zhongyuan Festival. He only saw a figure from a distance, but empress dowager Zhuang was so domineering that she compared all the emperors on one side.Another time, he went to the palace to visit a pregnant lady. He ran into empress dowager Zhuang's luanjia.He retreated to the side to salute empress dowager Zhuang.He just took a bold look, and his fierce eyes almost choked him on the spot.Empress Dowager Zhuang is not a good person, otherwise she would not be called queen of poison or demon behind her back.In addition to the appearance of the old lady in front of her, where does she have the air of the Empress Dowager?\"Aunt, are you stealing again?\" Xiaojingkong suddenly found something wrong with the old lady's sound of eating melon seeds. As soon as she looked back, she saw that she didn't know when to hold the jar of candied dried bayberry.The old lady turned her back decisively and threw the small clearance behind her head: \"don't talk nonsense! Where do I have it? \"With that, he grabbed a large hand and stuffed it into his purse.When Xiao Jingkong came to confiscate the jar, she had already stolen a lot.Marquis Gu had a panoramic view of everything, and he was more and more convinced that this man was a foodie, not empress dowager Zhuang!--Inside, Gu Jiao wakes up.She could have woken up earlier, but in order to let her sleep, Yao temporarily made a curtain to cover the window.The dim light really makes people sleepy. Gu Jiao sleeps until noon.She opened her eyes and found a man sitting beside the bed. The alarm rang in her heart!She pulled out the dagger under the pillow, went around the other side's neck, put the tip of the knife on the other side's neck, and buckled the other side in her arms!\"Jiaojiao, it's me!\" Yao said.Gu Jiao heard the familiar voice slightly, the vigilance between eyebrows spread, took away the dagger and let her go: \"Mrs. Gu?\"Just now that, straight Yao's cold sweat all startled.She turned around, calmed down and reached out to touch Gu Jiao's forehead: \"how do you feel?\"Gu Jiao subconsciously deflects her head to avoid her hand.Yao's look a meal, Shan Shan way: \"isn't frightening you?\"The light in the room was dim. Gu Jiao didn't see the redness of her eyes, but saw the blood on her neck.She just made it when she was holding her.When she was in high fever, her strength was not as accurate as usual, so she was hurt by mistake.But her first reaction was not to pay attention to her injury, but to Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao looks at her complexly.Yao noticed Gu Jiao's eyes, covered the wound with a kerchief and said with a smile, \"I'm ok, Jiao Jiao. How do you feel?\"She asked twice.Gu Jiao thought about it, but she answered, \"I'm fine, too. What's Mrs. Gu doing here?\"\"I'll see you.\" Yao said, went to the window, opened the curtain, strong light through the window paper in an instant.Gu Jiao's eyes closed slightly. In a moment, she adapted to the light. She said: \"Mrs. Gu has just been poisoned. She should stay in bed.\"Yao's gentle eyes fell on her small face: \"I know, I come here today, actually I have something to say with you.\"Gu Jiao looked at Yao, and suddenly found that there were crystal tears in her eyes.Yao came to her step by step, took her hand and carefully looked at her thin face.Her body is very weak, but this time with great strength: \"Jiaojiao, I'm your mother.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: 91Marquis Gu waited outside the door for a long time, and he was about to fall asleep. Yao finally came out.Yao's face was full of tears and his eyes were red and swollen. It seemed that he was crying a lot.Marquis Gu stepped forward and held her shoulder: \"madam!\"Yao nodded, held back his tears, turned his head and looked at the old lady in the backyard. He bowed to him and said, \"old man, I'm gone. Jiaojiao, please take care of me.\"Yao has never been in the palace. Naturally, she has never met the old lady. But before she came, she knew that there was Xiao LIULANG's aunt at home, who was very nice to her.The old lady gave her a strange look and said nothing.Yao asked Marquis Gu to take down the dim sum he had left in the carriage and hand it to the old lady: \"I don't know if the dim sum I made is to your taste.\"Well, the old lady looks better.The moment Yao turned around, the old lady suddenly looked at her.\"...\" Yao was stunned for a long time before he realized that the old lady was responding to what she had just said.Is it because I saw the snack that I was willing to take care of her?However, it seems that it is not reasonable, only a tone of charity.Yao made snacks for everyone in Gu Jiao's family, and there was also a little headroom.After that, Yao and Marquis Gu took the carriage back to the mansion.Marquis Gu can't wait to know what mother and daughter have talked about: \"what does that girl say?\"\"What did she say...\" Yao recalled the scene after he finished all the truth.Gu Jiao's reaction is very calm, at least calmer than Yao's imagination, as if what she heard is not her own life experience, but someone else's.Then she gave a puzzled murmur, and a trace of confusion flashed through her eyes.She was clearly in front of Yao, but at that moment Yao felt that her daughter was very far away.From the beginning to the end, Gu Jiao only said a word that made Yao's mind puzzled: \"if only you had been earlier, even if only half a year earlier.\"Yao was puzzled.Mr. and Mrs. Gu died nine years ago.My daughter got married a year ago and separated from my family a year ago.Why do you want them to arrive half a year earlier?What happened half a year ago that they didn't know?Is she hurt?Yao left with such a mood.On the other hand, Xiao LIULANG took half a day off from the Academy, went to the rejuvenation hall to collect some herbs, and on his way back to the village in Uncle Luo's ox cart, he happened to pass by Marquis Gu's carriage.The curtain of the carriage was blown up by the wind. At a glance, marquis Gu saw Xiao LIULANG on the bullock cart.He was so surprised that he staggered again and bumped into the wall of the car. The big bag, which was not easy to disappear, began to drum up again!He rubbed his eyes to see it again, but the cart had already gone far away.He put his head out of the window and peered back.\"What are you looking at?\" Yao asked.Marquis Gu took back his head: \"ah, nothing.\"What happened today? Didn't you read the Yellow calendar?First, I met an old country lady who looked like the empress dowager, and then I met a poor scholar who looked like the little Marquis of zhaodu.The Empress Dowager recuperates in the palace. The young Marquis of zhaodu has already passed away. No one can appear here.Marquis Gu murmured to himself, \"I've seen a ghost.\"Xiao LIULANG actually saw Lord Gu's carriage. He didn't look in the window, so he didn't know who was sitting in it.But he saw and noticed the horseshoe of the steed.It's not an ordinary horseshoe. It's used by the Marquis of the capital.It seems that the carriage is coming from the other side of the village. Xiao LIULANG's first reaction is to find himself. Especially when the cars of both sides are staggering in the opposite direction, the man in the car actually pokes out a head to look at him.Xiao LIULANG didn't look back. He looked coldly and said to Luo Er Shu, \"Luo Er Shu, please hurry up. Jiao Niang is ill.\"\"Good!\" Second uncle Luo answers.--After Yao and Gu left, Gu Jiao stayed in the room for a while.She thought of that wild dream. It was true. She was really the flesh and blood of Houfu.\"Well, then, I misunderstood him that day.\"Marquis Gu said that he was her Lao Tzu, which meant literally that he was looking for a cigarette.That's not the point. That guy is so annoying that he beat him up. The key is the dream.In her dream, she was not met by Yao's family, but by Lord Gu himself.Yao and Gu Yan did not appear from the beginning to the end. It is unlikely that Yao was abandoned because of the relationship between Yao and Gu. Combined with Yao's and Gu Yan's illness, Gu Jiao speculates that Gu Yan and Yao died before they went back to Hou's house.Gu Yan died of a heart attack. Yao may not be able to bear the blow of his son's death, or die of illness or hang himself.Without the protection of his mother and brother, the dreamer himself is like a rootless duckweed, with the name of marquis mansion, but he lives like an outsider.\"Jiao Jiao!\"Xiao Jingkong came in with his injured little finger.Gu Jiao returned to her senses and turned her head to look at the small clearance: \"what's the matter?\"Small clearance went to Gu Jiao in front, let Gu Jiao see his bleeding little index finger: \"injured.\"Gu Jiao pulled his little index finger to have a look: \"how hurt?\"\"The walnut.\" Little clearance said wrongly.Gu Jiao brought the walnuts back from the market. Some people exchanged vegetables for her mountain products, and some people exchanged eggs for her mountain products. She was usually too lazy to take care of them. Sometimes when she came back, she was scared by the things inside.\"Be careful next time.\" Gu Jiao didn't say that he was not allowed to smash it again. It's inevitable for children to stumble. She's not a parent who refuses to eat because of choking.Gu Jiao took out iodophor and cotton swab from the medicine box to detoxify xiaojingkong's wound: \"well, it's not serious. There's no need to wipe medicine.\"\"Whoa, whoa.\" Small clearance said with big eyes blinking.Gu Jiao gave him a shout.Xiaojingkong is not a coquettish child. Compared with the pain of daily practice, this small injury is not painful at all. He just wants to rub a coquettish cry!Get the small clearance of Huhu, and go out happily!Gu Jiao threw the used cotton swabs into a special basket and put the unused iodophor back into the small medicine box.Just now just attend to give small clear space to clean up wound, didn't look carefully, at the moment Mou Guang a sweep, Gu Jiao just found a trace not right.\"Why are there so many drugs all of a sudden?\"The medicine in her medicine box is generally divided into two kinds: one is emergency medicine, which she put in when she was a doctor in the Research Institute. She is organizing life and death. These drugs can save lives; Another kind of medicine appeared after coming here, such as Gu Yan's anti heart failure drugs, Yao's antidepressant drugs, and the anesthetics needed for Xiao LIULANG's operation.But either way, it's something she needs to treat her illness.Right now\u2014\u2014Liuwei Dihuang pill?Qibu Zhuangyang tea?Ziyin Bushen Dali Wan?Let alone these strange tonics. In the middle of the most eye-catching position, there is a box of bright planning, production, use and products!Gu Jiao: who moved her medicine box? How did it suddenly become so unruly?!--However, after returning to Wenquan villa, Yao decided to confess the truth to Gu Yan and Gu Jinyu.Marquis Gu hesitated: \"is this... Too hasty?\"It's nothing to say to Gu Yan, but he likes Gu Jiao so much, and tells him that Gu Jiao is his own sister. He will only feel happy when he is surprised.Jinyu is different.She has always been the only daughter in her family. She is used to being held in the palm of her hand. Suddenly she learns that she is not born to her parents. She will be hit hard.\"Jinyu will be sad.\" Marquis Gu said softly.Yao frowned and said, 'she's sad. Isn't Jiaojiao sad? Jiaojiao also just learned that she was not born to Gu Sanlang and his wife. \"How can it be the same? What family is Gu's and Hou's? That girl... Cough, Jiao Jiao knows her life experience, and she is not sure how happy she is, but Jin Yu will be hit. \"\"Happy?\" Yao shook his head. \"I can't see it.\"Gu Jiao's reaction is so calm that she is almost indifferent. When she doesn't know her life experience, she is not so cold to her. She suddenly becomes her mother. She seems to set up a door in her heart.Yao thought that Gu Jiao was unable to accept her because of her deep relationship with Gu Sanlang. She didn't doubt anything.Seeing that his wife's face was not good, Lord Gu softened his voice and said, \"Jiaojiao is our child, so is Jinyu. Jiaojiao needs the truth, because she has to go back to Houfu; Jin Yu doesn't have to go back to her home. Why do you tell her? \"Yao has seriously considered not to send Jinyu back. To be fair, she is reluctant to send Jinyu away because she has raised Jinyu for so many years. Besides, Gu Sanlang and his wife have passed away, and Jinyu has become an orphan.But it wasn't them who made the final decision, it was Jinyu and Gu family.After all, Jinyu is a family man. Even if her parents are not here, yenai and uncle are there, they have the right to return to Jinyu.Then Jinyu herself, if she insists on going back, she can't stay.Yao is the same to Gu Jiao. She fully respects Gu Jiao's decision.In dealing with the problem of recognition, she is in fact a bowl of water to the two children.But in the eyes of Lord Gu, Gu Jiao made money when she returned to the Marquis's house, but Jin Yu lost money when she returned to the Marquis's house, which is unfair to Jin Yu.\"I don't agree.\" Marquis Gu said.Yao said: \"how much you want to recognize Jiaojiao, how much you want to recognize Jinyu.\"Marquis Gu said: I don't want to recognize that girl! What are you doing? Beat yourself?Marquis Gu also said half of the things about Gu's family. He only said that it was not easy for Gu Jiao to grow up, but he didn't dare to say that Gu's family bullied her badly. He was afraid that Yao would be sad.But now he is afraid that Yao will fall into the trap of the family.Marquis Gu thought about it for a while and said, \"I think that the family has some bad ideas. Let's not associate with them.\"\"What's the matter?\" Yao asked.Marquis Gu said that Gu yue'e had taken the place of Gu Jiao.\"What else?\" Yao frowned, \"isn't Jiaojiao suffering a lot in their family?\"Marquis Gu said hastily, \"I have taught them a lesson!\"Now Yao can't wait to recognize her daughter. Thinking of the hardships she has suffered in recent years, Yao wants to give her all her life.Marquis Gu coughed softly and said, \"look at the general situation of Gu family, we can't let Jinyu go back to suffer.\"\"Of course, I won't let her suffer. She's also my child,\" Yao saidWhen she had a bad time with Jinyu, she did not understand why she could not be a competent mother. Now that she knew the truth of her life, she was relieved.Jinyu is not her own, so she can't hurt Jinyu as much as Gu Yan.But from now on, she will continue to love Jinyu as an adoptive mother with the love of Gu Sanlang and his wife.Yao said, \"Jinyu will be my child whether she goes back to take care of her family or not.\"After listening to Yao's words, marquis Gu was relieved. As long as Yao didn't insist on sending Jinyu away, Jinyu would not leave them.That night, the couple called Gu Yan and Gu Jinyu to the room and confessed their mistake.Marquis Gu zhengse way: \"that child you also know, is the little medicine boy of the rejuvenation hall.\"Sure enough, Gu Yan's eyes are bright!Originally heard that Gu Jinyu is not his sister, he did not respond, but when he learned that his sister is Gu Jiao, he was happy to fly in place.Although Gu Yan was barely sitting, there was already a picture in his mind: Gu Yan raised his hand and ran around the room in the posture of dancing God with a magic wand!\"Eh!\" Marquis Gu held his forehead.Stop thinking!Compared with Gu Yan's excitement, Gu Jinyu was like a bolt from the blue!She didn't expect that she was not born to her parents. The wild girl who was looked down upon was!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: 92Gu Jinyu felt as if she had fallen from heaven to hell overnight. Shock, fear, sadness and the impending loss of her parents were all intertwined in her heart, like a big net, which trapped her\u201c I want to find a time to arrange for you to meet Gu's family... \"Later Yao said a lot, but Gu Jinyu didn't listen to a word.Yao gently took her hand and let her have a rest.It was the night when Gu Jinyu was lying on the luxurious and soft bed, and for the first time he tasted the taste of sleeplessness.There was a strong wind outside, whistling the branches and leaves.Gu Jinyu lifted the quilt and went down to the ground. She opened the door of the room. A strong wind came on her face, blowing her robes and green silk.\"Oh! Miss, how did you come out? Such a strong wind! Beware of catching coldThe servant girl on duty rushed forward to help Gu Jinyu into the room.Gu Jinyu said faintly, \"I can't sleep. I want to go out for a walk.\"\"Ah... But it's so late...\" said the little maid. Seeing that Gu Jinyu didn't plan to go back to her room, she swallowed the admonition, \"wait a minute, miss. I'll take a cloak for you!\"\"Well.\" Gu Jinyu nodded.The little maid found a soft cloak from the wardrobe for Gu Jinyu to put on.Gu Jinyu looked down at his cloak, and suddenly murmured: \"five flower horse, thousand gold fur, hu'er will go out for good wine.\"Little servant girl Leng Leng asked: \"Miss, what's the matter with you? Why do you start to sing poems all of a sudden? Do you want to write poetry? \"The little maid doesn't know poetry, but Yuru knows it. Unfortunately, Yuru is expelled by Gu Yan.Gu Jinyu picked up a corner of his cloak and murmured, \"do you know what a thousand gold fur is? What I have on me is that some people can't buy such clothes even if they don't eat or drink for a few years. \"The little servant girl understood, she said with a smile: \"that's natural, miss is the daughter of Hou family! It's not comparable to those civilians outside! \"\"What's your name?\" Gu Jinyu asked.\"Maidservant, little pear.\" Little servant girl answers.After Yuru left, Gu Jinyu's servants were selected by Marquis Gu. Recently, they were all fresh faces.\"Are you from a nearby village?\" Gu Jinyu asked again.\"Yes The small servant girl opens big bright eyes to answer.Gu Jinyu looked at her up and down: \"you look younger than me. How can your family be willing to let you out to be a servant girl?\"The little servant girl said with a smile: \"Miss, I'm joking. How many people in our village can't ask to be a servant girl in the villa! There are four sisters in the slave's family. Only the slave's job is the bestGu Jinyu was stunned: \"do all the four sisters have to work? No brother at home? \"The little maid nodded and said, \"there is a brother and a younger brother. The elder brother is going to get married. We are making betrothal gifts for him. The younger brother will get married in the future, and he will earn his share. However, if we all marry well, the betrothal gifts we receive should be enough for them to get married. \"There was no complaint in her voice, as if she had been born to live for her brother.Gu Jinyu felt that her three views had been overturned.She has been raised in Houfu since she was a child. She has three brothers and one younger brother in her family. Although her younger brother is naughty, he only bullies her and will not crush her; The three brothers are all young and promising. Even if they don't want to see their room, they never want to sacrifice their stepsister to pave the way for them.Gu Jinyu listens to the little servant girl again, and finds that Marquis Gu and Yao are the best parents in the world.She couldn't give up such a good father and mother, and she couldn't give up everything in Hou's house.The next day, marquis Gu and Yao came to see her. Her eyes were swollen like two walnuts.The little maid explained: \"Miss cried all night last night...\"\"You step back.\" Yao said.\"Yes.\" The little servant girl retreated in fear. She was worried that she didn't serve the young lady well, which made her sad. She didn't want to be driven out of the villa.Mr. Gu and Mr. Yao came to the bed. Mr. Gu stood on the side and Mr. Yao sat down on the edge of the bed.\"Niang --\" Gu Jinyu rushed into Yao's arms, big tears dripping into Yao's mind, \"don't abandon your daughter... Your daughter won't give up your father... Your daughter won't leave you --\"Gu Jinyu cried like this, which made Marquis Gu's heart confused.He said painfully: 'silly child, when did your parents say they didn't want you? Your mother and I have already discussed this matter. It's up to you. If you want to go back -- \"Gu Jinyu cried and interrupted: \"if the daughter doesn't go back, she will be filial to her mother and father all her life!\"Poor child, she was an orphan when she went back. Yao couldn't bear it, especially when she learned that Gu Sanlang and his wife loved Jiao Jiao so much.She stroked Gu Jinyu's face and said, \"it's just that even if you don't go back to Gu's home, you should go to give your own parents incense.\"\"Well!\" Gu Jinyu agreed tearfully.Yao nodded happily, got up and went to see Gu Yan with Marquis Gu. Gu Jinyu suddenly grabbed her sleeve and said chokingly, \"I'm not good. I've occupied my sister's identity for so many years, and I've robbed the best mother and father in the world. When my sister comes back, I'll love my sister. I'll love my sister with what my parents have given me these years.\"Yao touched her head.The couple went to see Gu Yan again.Gu Yan didn't sleep all night. He was as excited as a bullfrog. He croaked all night. Yu ya'er was almost bored to death by him!It's the most lovely young man who is quiet and indifferent!Gu Yan was so happy that he even forgot to give it to his father.Gu Yan said, 'she likes me!\"Yao looked at his son fondly: \"mother knows.\"Gu Yan said, \"I like her, too!\"Yao nodded with a smile: \"well.\"Gu Yan sat up and said, \"I'm going to find her!\"Yao took his son's hand and whispered, \"give her some time to digest.\"Gu Yan stood by the ten thousand little ants in his heart: \"well, OK.\"--village.About his life experience, Gu Jiao didn't hide it from her family, and Xue Ningxiang was also there.Due to Gu Jiao's illness, the old lady couldn't eat Xiao LIULANG's food, so she called Xue Ningxiang to help cook.After she finished, the old lady left her to eat with Gowa.When the old lady asked about Yao's relationship with Marquis Gu at the dinner table, Gu Jiao gave a light account of their identities and their being held wrongly.All the people in the room except Gouwa understood that Gu Jiao was Gu Jinyu, and Gu Jinyu was Gu Jiao. Their identities changed.But Gu Jiao's tone was too calm. What she didn't know was that she just said something like eating cabbage tonight.Xue Ningxiang's chin is about to be startled. How can his neighbor who has been together for so long be the daughter of Hou family? She's eating in Houfu Qianjin's house?!Xue Ningxiang felt that her chopsticks were going to be unstable.She looked at the old lady, Xiao LIULANG and Xiao Jingkong, and found that they were calm all the way except when she heard that Gu Jiao was wrongly held.Don't you, don't you think jiaoniang's identity is very powerful? Her father is Hou Ye!Old lady: I've beaten the most powerful man in the whole kingdom of Zhao. It's nothing but the Marquis!Xiao LIULANG: Marquis of the second grade. He has a title but no real power.Xiaojingkong: how great is a villain who only bullies women and children? Hum!Xue Ningxiang was stunned and looked at a table of calm neighborsShe seems to have found something extraordinary?After dinner, Xue Ningxiang asks Gu Jiao to go back to her room and lie down. She comes to clean up.Gu Jiao really can't do anything, so she doesn't show any affectation with her, thanks and goes back to the room.Xue Ningxiang goes to wash the dishes, Xiao Jingkong goes for a walk, while Xiao LIULANG boils the medicine from huichuntang to Gu Jiaoduan.The door is open.He hesitated for a moment, but still tapped.Gu Jiao closed the small medicine box and raised her head: \"what's the matter?\"Xiao LIULANG's eyes swept from her small medicine box without any trace, and said in a positive way: \"the medicine is good, it's antipyretic medicine.\"\"Oh.\" Gu Jiao pushes the small medicine box to one side and reaches for the medicine he handed over.She didn't like to drink bitter medicine, but she insisted on drinking it for the sake of his cooking.She returned the medicine bowl to him: \"thank you very much.\"Xiao LIULANG said lightly: \"it's a little help.\"Gu Jiao looked at his back and said with a smile, \"I mean, you took the medicine for me last night.\"Xiao LIULANG's back was stiff.Gu Jiao wakes up to find that her wound has been treated, and her whole body smells of golden sore medicine, not to mention a piece of cloth covering the wound on her back.It's not the old lady who can do it so carefully.Xiao LIULANG didn't look back, but he could feel that her real eyes fell on his back. He couldn't help thinking of her naked back and the arc shape under her body.It's killing to see these things at a young age.Xiao LIULANG's throat is dry for a while, calm down, solemnly said: \"nothing.\"Having said that, he took the empty medicine bowl and went out with the same hands and feet!Looking at his back, Gu Jiao murmured: \"it seems that I have seen a lot.\"Today is Xue Ningxiang's medicine for Gu Jiao.In fact, the door was closed, but looking at the closed door, Xiao LIULANG still felt uneasy, so he grabbed a bucket to fetch water at the entrance of the village.In the middle of Gu Jiao's medication, someone knocked on the door.\"I'll see it.\" Xue Ningxiang put down the golden sore medicine, went out of Gu Jiao's house, closed the door to Gu Jiao, opened the door of the main room, looked at the middle-aged man in front of him and said, \"who are you?\"The head of Li Yuan said with a smile, \"I'm the dean of Tianxiang Academy. My name is Li. Is this Xiao LIULANG's home?\"As soon as Xue Ningxiang heard that Xiao LIULANG was studying, she said politely, \"it's the dean. Are you looking for LIULANG? He went to fetch water! Eh? You just came from the village, didn't you meet him? \"President Li's carriage stopped at the entrance of the village, but people came. It was a little dark, and he didn't care much.Xue Ningxiang said: \"you wait, I'll go to him!\"President Li suddenly stopped Xue Ningxiang: \"that... Is jiaoniang there?\"Xue Ningxiang tilted his head: \"eh?\"Gu Jiao invited Dean Li into the hall and poured him a bowl of boiled herbal tea.In recent days, xiaojingkong was on fire. Gu Jiao picked some Houttuynia from the mountain she bought and boiled water for him to drink.Premier Li had never drunk such a bad tea before, but he just dried up a big bowl.Gu Jiao saw that he liked it so much and poured a big bowl for him.President Li, who is difficult to be gracious, said: \"I'm sorry.\"After three big bowls in a row, Gu Jiao shook the teapot and said, \"hmm? No morePresident Li, who almost drank and vomited: Thank God, there is no more!Gu Jiao asked politely, \"what's the matter with the president coming here today?\"\"You've visited my mother many times, but I haven't had a good time to thank you.\" Premier Li said and handed the burden to Gu Jiao. \"The peach tree in the backyard bears fruit. My mother asked me to bring some to you.\"Gu Jiao took over the burden: \"thank you, old lady.\"President Li said gently, \"my mother is old. Sometimes she doesn't even know how many sons she has, but she always remembers you.\"\"How many?\" Gu Jiao looked at him strangely.\"Ah.\" Premier Li was quick to talk about his family. He said with a smile, \"I have four elder brothers. I'm my mother's old son.\"No wonder president Li is less than forty, but old lady Li is old.\"The elder brothers are all in the capital. They haven't seen each other for many years.\" What's more, President Li didn't say.Gu Jiao did not ask again.President Li said, \"there is another thing about LIULANG today.\"Gu Jiao: \"what happened to Xianggong?\"President Li: \"you must have heard about his success in the exam, but there's another thing you don't know - he had a chance to become a little Sanyuan, because someone bribed the examiner to replace his test paper, which made him turn in the blank in the third scene.\"Gu Jiao's eyes are cold.This is the college entrance examination in ancient times. People cheat.President Li then said, \"it's very important to retake the exam. I don't know why he didn't retake it. Maybe he didn't want to, or maybe the government intervened.\"Some of his students worked in the Gongyuan of Pingcheng Prefecture. They only got a little information, but they didn't get all of it.Premier Li asked, \"did he mention it to you?\"Gu Jiao shook her head: \"No.\"\"It's not surprising that he has such a disposition. Everything is hidden in his heart.\" Premier Li said, \"I asked him afterwards, but he refused to say. In fact, it's not too big to be admitted to xiaosanyuan. As long as you are admitted to Xiucai, you will have the opportunity to take part in the local examination. That's the real beginning. \"Gu Jiao: \"but?\"The atmosphere set off to this point, but it's unreasonable.President Li sighed: \"it seems that he is not willing to go to the local examination.\"After thinking about it, he corrected, \"no, when I mentioned the local examination, he didn't have much reaction. When I mentioned that he had to go to Beijing for the examination after the local examination, his face sank. I don't know if it's accurate to say that, but he didn't study hard in the past. It seems that he just wanted to avoid going to Beijing to rush for the exam. \"Don't you want to go to Beijing?Gu Jiao touched her chin and fell into deep thought.President Li came to Gu Jiao to find out about the situation. As a result, he didn't get much. He had no choice but to return.Such a good young man, he really doesn't want to be in a small village.Thinking about things, Dean Li suddenly ran into the gowarden who rolled out of the yard.Gowardesh is rolling down from the haystack. It's also a good thing that he bumps people and stops, otherwise he will have to roll into the puddle.Dean Li quickly picked up the little guy from the ground and patted the dust on him: \"are you ok? Did it hurt you? \"Gowardesh looked at him with big black eyes.Gowardesh has been growing teeth recently, and he has a lot of brats. He is looking at Dean Li while he is flowing with brats. Suddenly he opens his mouth and cries out: \"Dad!\"President Li is shaking all over!Xue Ningxiang, who came out of Gu Jiao's yard, was also shocked!Gowarden is learning to talk. When he meets a woman, he calls her mother, but he hasn't called her father. After all, he doesn't have a father.Xue Ningxiang was so embarrassed that she wanted to find a pit to bury Gowa and herself!She quickly walked over and held Gouwa over. She said, \"I'm sorry, she's not sensible. Don't be surprised.\"President Li Xiaoxiao: \"ah, it's OK.\"Xue Ningxiang quickly takes Gouwa away. Unexpectedly, Gouwa turns his head and shouts dad at Dean Li.Xue Ningxiang was so ashamed and angry that she was about to cry.Baby, don't say your father is dead, even if he is not, it can't be the president of others!What are they? What are you?Where did you get this ability to recognize your father?Call you Gouwa, you really have guts!Xue Ningxiang fled back to the house with her son in her arms. She closed the door, bolted the door and cheered up!President Li shook his head in a funny way.Dad?I'm afraid he can't be a father in his life.Xue Ningxiang took her son back to the house, put him on the bed and seriously corrected him: \"Gouwa, you don't have a father.\"Gouwa: \"Dad.\"Xue Ningxiang: \"not Dad!\"\"Dad.\"Xue Ningxiang: \"no father! Don't call Dad! No! \"Gowardesh crawls out: \"Dad.\"Xue Ningxiang is going to be mad by her son!If you recognize your father again, I can't hold your father's coffin!!!Xue Ning was so fragrant that she shook the pillow and a hard thing fell out and smashed it on the stool.Xue Ningxiang picked up the thing. At first, she couldn't remember it. After thinking for a long time, she frowned: \"eh? This is not... \"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: 93When Xiao LIULANG comes back from the water, Gu Jiao sits in the main room waiting for him.Gu Jiao said, \"president Fang Caili has been here.\"Xiao LIULANG took the water to the backyard and poured it into the water tank: \"well, I met him at the entrance of the village.\"Gu Jiao came to the back door of the main room, leaned lightly on the door and said, \"don't ask what he said to me?\"\"What did he say?\" Xiao LIULANG asked casually.Gu Jiao said quietly, \"he said you have a little wife in the capital.\"\"Cough!\" Xiao LIULANG almost didn't choke to death!\"No?\"\"No\"Nothing?\"\"No concubine!\"It's not that I haven't been to the capital, but I don't have a second wife.Gu Jiao raised her eyebrows: \"Oh, when most people hear that sentence, their first reaction should be,\" I haven't been to the capital, how can I raise a concubine in the capital? \"? You only deny the second point. So, have you been to the capital? \"Xiao LIULANG said calmly, 'so what if I have been there?\"Gu Jiao asked, \"how did you get the guide to the capital?\"The capital is the capital of the state of Zhao. The most valuable people in the state of Zhao all live in it. Its defense is so tight that ordinary people can't get a guide at all.The common people like Xiao LIULANG will never enter the capital unless they win the local examination.\"And you?\" Xiao LIULANG didn't choose to answer Gu Jiao's question directly. Instead, he turned around and pointed at her, \"what's the matter with your box?\"Gu Jiao's pupil shrinks.good heavens.Learn to use her secret to block her mouth, right?Xiao LIULANG walked to her step by step with a crutch, and stopped less than half a step in front of her: \"you tell me where your box came from, and I'll tell you... How I got the capital guide.\"This is the first time that he is so close to Gu Jiao that his breath falls on her head.Gu Jiao found that he was not only a little taller.Gu Jiao can feel the young breath from his body. It's clean and refreshing, but it's more than that. He's growing up and is about to become a real man.His breath was cold and dangerous, like a fierce beast with open tusks!Gu Jiao blinked, suddenly stretched out her little index finger and poked his little chest muscle.Xiao LIULANG\"Ah - I didn't mean to!\"Xue Ningxiang, who just came to the door, covered his face and said he didn't see anything!Xiao LIULANG and Gu Jiao's standing posture is really too close. At first glance, they thought that Xiao LIULANG had knocked her on the wall and was about to do evil to her.It feels good.Gu Jiao poked again.Xiao LIULANGHer chest was full of soft touch from her fingertips. Xiao LIULANG had no fierce animal breath, and went back to the room with red ears.Xue Ningxiang sighed: \"ah... It's the first time I've seen such Xiao LIULANG.\"\"What can I do for you?\" Gu Jiao came over quietly.Xue Ningxiang's eyes suddenly fell on her face. She was caught doing something intimate. How could it be Xiao LIULANG who blushed instead of this girl? Is there something wrong?\"Er... That.\"But Xue Ningxiang didn't forget the business. She handed Gu Jiao an iron card in her hand: \"here, here you are.\"\"For me?\" Gu Jiao took it over and found that it was an iron plate made of bronze. There was no word on the plate, only a strange emblem.\"Well!\" Xue Ningxiang nodded and said with some embarrassment, \"this was found in the place where Xiao LIULANG was in a coma at the beginning. You were just trying to pick people back, but you didn't find this one in the grass. I hid it secretly. I intended to sell it in the market. But my mother-in-law said it was neither gold nor silver. If I could not sell it for a few dollars, I put it aside. But for today... \"Xue Ningxiang awkwardly jumped over Gouwa's recognition of her father and made her shake the pillow angrily. \"Suddenly, she fell out of the pillow. I forgot that I had seen such a thing.\"A year ago, Xiao LIULANG fainted at the entrance of the village, which was discovered by Xue Ningxiang and Gu Jiao.Xue Ningxiang goes to the village to call people. Gu Jiao carries them back directly. When Xue Ningxiang brings people here, Xiao LIULANG is already gone, but Xue Ningxiang finds a heavy sign left in the grass.Xue Ningxiang said, \"I'm not sure if it belongs to Xiao LIULANG. Would you like to ask him?\"Gu Jiao suddenly remembered something.On the first day she came across, Xiao LIULANG secretly rummaged in her room. Is that what she was looking for?Hehe, young man, let's see who reveals whose secret first?Gu Jiao went back to the house with the bronze card.She was absolutely sure that Xiao LIULANG had touched her small medicine box, probably last night.It's impossible for outsiders to open her medicine box, but she was so confused last night that she seemed to forget to lock it.Did those strange pills and family planning supplies appear after Xiao LIULANG touched the medicine box?Gu Jiao looked at the small medicine box fiercely: \"dare to show me these messy things again, and burn you!\"A cold wind blowing, small medicine box as quiet as a chicken.--After breakfast, Gu Jinyu packed up and set out. She promised Yao that she would offer incense to Gu Sanlang and his wife.Before leaving, she went to see Yao and Marquis Gu: \"I should be able to meet my sister when I go to the village, right? I want to see her. \"Yao didn't object.But Marquis Gu worried that Gu Jiao was too fierce and bullied Gu Jinyu. After all, the two children had friction.Marquis Gu asked Huang Zhong to accompany an experienced Mammy.Gu Yan was so excited all night that he fell asleep at breakfast. Now he was sleeping on his bed and didn't know that he had missed the chance to go to the countryside.Gu Jinyu got into the carriage. The maid and mother were in the other carriage. Huang Zhong led several bodyguards to ride on both sides of Gu Jinyu.On the way, Gu Jinyu opened the curtain of the car window and looked at Huang Zhong, who was riding with him. He said with a kind face: \"Lord Huang, you have seen my sister. What kind of person is she?\"\"Ah... This...\" it's hard for Huang Zhong to say.Bad temper, the unfilial girl who keeps the Marquis on the ground?Huang Zhong clenched his fist and coughed a few times: \"although I've seen the young lady, I didn't speak to her.\"Gu Jinyu regretted with a smile: \"me too. I didn't say a few words seriously. If I had known that she was my sister, I wouldn't have done that to her. I'm so stupid that I don't even know my sister. \"Huang Zhongxin said that he was not born in person. Of course you don't know him. Don't you see that young master has been close to the first lady just once? Born or not, it's different!He didn't dare to say these words.At present, the story about the two daughters has not been spread in the government. He and several masters know the truth, but the paper can't hold the fire. It depends on how the Marquis and his wife say it to the outside world.Huang Zhong has been here several times, and he has heard all about the village, including the grave of Gu Sanlang and his wife.Gu Sanlang died a violent death. According to the rules of the countryside, he was not allowed to be buried in his ancestral grave. His grave was far away from Gu's geomantic treasure land. Xu was buried beside him. It is said that Xu asked for it before he died.The carriage stopped at the entrance of the village. The battle was a little big, and Gu Jinyu, who was like a fairy, attracted a lot of hope from the villagers.Gu Jinyu wore a staff, followed by a decent servant girl and mother.The villagers have never seen the gold in the city, so they can't turn their eyes.\"Watch your step, miss!\" It's hard to walk in the countryside. Huang Zhong is afraid that this delicate daughter will fall down on him.Gu Jinyu held the maid's arm tightly. This kind of bumpy dirt road really wronged her rich feet.After the party went away, the villagers began to talk.\"Well? Who are they? \"\"I don't know. It seems that the man has been to our village several times and inquired a lot about his family. \"\"Ah! You see, they are going to Gu Sanlang's grave! \"\"It's not the Xu family, is it?\"Gu family has no such respectable relatives, so the villagers can only guess from Xu family.Xu is not from his own village. His family is better off than Gu's. He is half a city dweller, but after Xu's death, Xu's family broke up with Gu's.When Gu Jinyu arrived at the cemetery, he found a man standing at the head of the tomb. He was in coarse linen, thin, wearing a hat and carrying a small basket.\"Sister... Sister?\"Gu Jinyu spoke tentatively.Gu Jiao bent over to hoe the grass. She straightened up and turned her head to look at Gu Jinyu.Gu Jinyu immediately showed a smile of joy: 'sister, it's really you!\"Gu Jiao glanced at her strangely, ignored her and continued to bend over to hoe.Since the death of Gu Sanlang and his wife, Gu Jiao came to hoe the grave regularly.Gu Jinyu was left out in the cold, but she didn't give up. She let go of the little servant girl's hand and walked towards Gu Jiao.But her delicate embroidered shoes couldn't walk the way to the grave at all, and almost didn't sprain her feet.\"Miss! Be careful The little maid and mammy held her together.\"I'm fine.\" Gu Jinyu gives Gu Jiao a look and signals them to let go. Then she is more careful.She came to Gu Jiao with her clean skirt and held out her hand to Gu Jiao: 'sister, let me come.\"\"I'm not your sister.\" Gu Jiao said, \"you can't come either.\"This kind of swearing can't be done by a spoiled daughter.Gu Jiaocai, who needs to use a shovel, uses a shovel. If she doesn't need a shovel, she starts directly.Gu Jinyu, learning the way she pulled the grass, also reached out and pulled it. The result can be imagined.Little servant girl and mammy don't know the truth, but the servants of Hou's house always know the rules, and never care about what they shouldn't ask.Just don't ask, in the heart is very curious.This little village girl has a big airs. Her young lady puts down her figure and calls her sister. She doesn't appreciate it and gives her face back.\"You step back first.\" Gu Jinyu ordered.The little servant girl and the mother retreated to three Zhang.\"You step down, too.\" Gu Jinyu said to Huang Zhong.Huang Zhong, who is pulling the grass, claps his hands and retreats far away.Only Gu Jiao and Gu Jinyu were left on the grave.Gu Jiao is still weeding like no one else.Gu Jinyu put the straw mat and paper money on the ground, burned the paper money with a fire fold, knelt on the straw mat and kowtowed to Gu Sanlang and Xu respectively.Later, Gu Jinyu kept a kneeling posture, burning paper money while muttering: \"I heard that they were good people in their lifetime and were very good to their sister.\"Gu Jiao finally had a reaction, light way: \"call parents hot your mouth?\"Gu Jinyu choked.Gu Sanlang and Xu are really good parents. If they know that their baby is wrong, they will be very sad. They want to hear their own daughter call them parents.Gu Jiao glanced at her: \"just to burn paper money is not necessary, this paper money, I still can afford to burn.\"Gu Jinyu lowered her head and said in a low voice, 'sister, do you hate me? I know I'm bad. I've taken away your identity, my parents and everything that should belong to you. You should hate me. I don't blame you... \"Gu Jiao ignored her.The person who has been robbed of everything has passed away. Moreover, it is inappropriate to rob. Gu Jinyu is innocent, and she is also the one who was wrongly held.There was no resentment or liking in her heart.This person has nothing to do with her.Gu Jinyu doesn't understand Gu Jiao's idea. She only thinks that Gu Jiao is complaining about herself. There is nothing wrong with this kind of complaining. After all, she took advantage of it.She said sincerely: 'sister, don't worry, I won't argue with you. You are the eldest lady of Houfu. When you get back to Hou's house, I'll move out the yard and give it back to you. But after all, my parents have raised me for so many years, and I ask my sister to allow me to be filial to my parents. \"Gu Jiao is a little fidgety: \"have you finished? And then I'll goGu Jinyu begged: \"elder sister, please come back to Hou's house with me.\"\"No return.\"\"Sister! How on earth would you like to go back with me? You tell me, I promise you everythingGu Jiao looked at her with a faint smile: \"including you clean body out of the house, never appear in Hou Fu?\"Gu Jinyu's expression is stiff!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: 94Gu Jiao's figure is taller than Gu Jinyu's. even if Gu Jinyu wears thick soled embroidered shoes, Gu Jiao can still oppressively look down on her.Gu Jiao light way: \"if even this sincerity all don't have, don't again persuade me to go back.\"Gu Jinyu said, \"if you want to drive me away...\"Gu Jiao said coldly: \"I'm not rare. Take whatever you like. Just don't bother me.\"This is Gu Jiao and strangers said the most words, clearly she only care about the people so patient.Next, Gu Jiao explains what it means to be Gu Jinyu with her strength.Gu Jinyu tried to burn the paper money, but in the end, she didn't call Gu Sanlang's parents in front of Gu Jiao.Gu Jinyu knelt down for a long time, and her legs were numb. It was the little maid and mammy who helped her up.She bowed to Gu Jiao and said, \"I'll go first. I'll visit my sister again when I'm free.\"Not long after she left, xiaojingkong came over from another path: \"Jiaojiao!\"He saw Gu Jinyu not far away and asked, \"eh? Who are they? \"Gu Jiao said, 'stranger.\"\"Oh.\" Strangers, that little clearance will not care about them.\"Why are you here?\" Gu Jiao asked.Xiaojingkong said, \"I'll go home. You're not here. My aunt says you've come to the grave!\"Xiaojingkong has morning classes, exercises and friends in the village every morning. As soon as he has finished his work, he goes home and finds that Gu Jiao is not there, so he asks his aunt where Jiao Jiao has gone.\"Whose grave is this?\" Xiaojingkong asked with big eyes.Gu Jiao looked at the two old tombs and said, \"my parents, this is my father, this is my mother.\"Xiaojingkong put his hands behind him and thought with his head askew: \"it's Jiaojiao's parents, so it's also Jingkong's parents!\"Xiao Jingkong said, kneeling down and kowtowing to Gu Sanlang and Xu.He was so devout that he knocked his head into the earth and called his parents.His voice was milky, but his face was solemn. He knelt down under the desolate grave, which made people cry.An adopted child can still be like this, but his own mother can't even say a word. Gu Jinyu feels a little blocked in her heart, like being slapped in the face.\"Are you all right, miss?\" The little servant girl is aware of Gu Jinyu's abnormality.Gu Jinyu closed her eyes: \"it's OK, go back to the house.\"\"YesGu Jinyu and his party got on the carriage and went back to the mansion.On the other side, Gu Jiao and Xiao Jingkong clean up the weeds on the grave and go back together.\"Jiao Jiao, are you well?\" Small clear space pulls Gu Jiao's hand to ask.\"Well, all right.\" Gu Jiao nodded.The fever has gone, which is good for her.As for the wound scab off scab, it's a routine, not to the heart.When Xiao Jingkong heard Gu Jiao say that she was well, he believed that she was really well. He cheered with joy: \"I just talked to my parents!\"\"Oh? What did you say? \" When Gu Jiao was weeding, she did hear the little guy muttering, but she didn't know what he muttered.Xiaojingkong raised her chin and said with pride, \"I ask my parents to protect Jiaojiao from getting sick again! Mom and dad must have heard that. That's why Jiaojiao got better! \"Gu Jiao: what else?Xiaojingkong firmly believes that it is Gu Sanlang and his wife under the spring who made them manifest. Obviously, he made them manifest himself, so it's actually his credit, not the medicine that the bad brother-in-law took back!\u2014\u2014It can be said that he is a little monk who competes with his brother-in-law all the time!But he said that after leaving the village, Gu Jinyu hurried back to the villa. As soon as he got to the town, he found that something was missing\u201c StopShe said.The coachman stopped the carriage on the street. Huang Zhong rode his horse and asked, \"what's the matter, miss?\"Gu Jinyu rummaged carefully in her sleeve pocket and purse, frowned and said, \"my things have dropped.\"\"What's missing?\" Huang Zhong asked.\"A letter.\" Gu Jinyu said.\"I'll ask them to come and help you find it.\" Huang Zhong called the little servant girl and mammy on the back of the carriage to help Gu Jinyu search in the carriage.As a result, several people rummaged and found nothing Gu Jinyu had lost.\"Is it a very important letter?\" Huang Zhong asked.\"Well.\" Gu Jinyu nodded.It was a letter written by Shufei to her. There was a question in it. It was originally written for the princes. But the fifth prince, Shufei's son, couldn't solve it, so he sent a letter to Gu Jinyu.Gu Jinyu Bing Xueming is more intelligent than the accompanying reading of the fifth prince. From childhood to adulthood, she basically secretly solved the problems for the fifth prince. After solving the problems, she said that the fifth prince made them himself.The Emperor didn't know the truth, so he was really smarter than the other princes.The emperor's fondness for the imperial concubine had something to do with her respect for the fifth prince, so the imperial concubine attached great importance to Gu Jinyu.This time, the title was written by your majesty himself, which is said to have baffled all the princes.All the people in the state of Zhao know that his majesty doesn't like poems and verses. He loves to study arithmetic and astronomy.Shufei repeatedly told Gu Jinyu in her letter that she must help the fifth prince to solve the problem, and she must be quick.Whoever can solve this problem ahead of others can please his majesty.Gu Jinyu took the questions with him day by day. As long as he was free, he counted them.But your Majesty's question is too difficult, she racked her brains, many genius barely half.But even if it's only half of it, it's only after a huge amount of calculation. Today, we've lost what we've been struggling for so long.Gu Jinyu's heart was blocked.Let her do it all over again. She's going crazy.Gu Jinyu pressed her chest and said, \"is it in the village? I've just been kneeling there burning paper money. Maybe I fell out of my sleeve pocket at that time. \"--Xiaojingkong took Jiaojiao's hand and hopped back home.Gu Jiao goes to cook, he goes to feed, shovels chicken Baba and tidies up chicken cages.But before he started, he found one thing.\"Why?\" He looked down at something stuck to his heel, blinked strangely, and bent over to pick it up.It turned out to be a small folded envelope.There was no name on the envelope.He opened the envelope and took out the letter.\"Letter\" is still no name, nor signed, a large white paper full of numbers.\"It's like a question.\" Small clearance showed a small expression of loss.It was a field he had never studied, so he didn't know what to do.More importantly, why did it appear at his feet?He was sure his shoes were clean before he went out.\"Did... My parents give it to me?\"The more he thought about it, the more he felt it was like this. His parents must have heard his plea and then responded to him!He thought for a moment, put the letter into his pocket, ran into the kitchen, squatted down and looked around Gu Jiao's sole.Gu Jiao was confused by him: \"what are you looking at?\"Little headroom shook his head like a rattle: \"nothing! NothingMy parents didn't leave a message for Jiaojiao, they just left it for him.Because Jiaojiao didn't talk to her parents just now, only he did.The idea flashed over, and Xiao Jingkong was more and more convinced that this letter was from his parents under Jiuquan!But because he didn't explain his learning level to his parents, his parents overestimated his ability.In order not to let parents down, xiaojingkong decided to ask for foreign aid.Xiaojingkong returned to the kitchen with a pen and paper: \"Jiaojiao, I can't do this problem!\"When Xiao Jingkong went down the mountain, he brought a lot of Buddhist scriptures and some strange questions that were said to have been written by his master. Some of them were half done by his master, and some of them were not done by his master.Gu Jiao didn't think much about it when she saw it. She just thought it was another one left by his master.The crispy meat is fried in the pot. The oil temperature is just right. It can't be fried too tender or too deep.Gu Jiao took time to solve the problem for him, and then fried a pot of crispy pork until golden. The whole process took less than a minute.Xiaojingkong took the solution to Gu Sanlang's grave.Xiaojingkong is an honest child and doesn't hide what he asked Gu Jiao about.At the same time, he also recited the Buddhist scriptures he had learned to Gu Sanlang and his wife, hoping that they could make questions from these Buddhist scriptures when they test him next time.\"Have a good rest, then. I'll go first! I'll see you again some other day! \"Xiaojingkong put the problem in front of the grave. In order to prevent it from being blown away by the wind, he specially found a small stone to press it!Gu Jinyu and his party came to the entrance of the village again.\"Miss, you wait in the carriage. Let's find it.\" Mammy said to Gu Jinyu.Gu Jinyu is a man of thousands of gold. It's better not to appear in such humble places frequently.Gu Jinyu thought about it, but did not refuse.Mammy, her servant girl and Huang Zhong went to look for her along the road.\"You guys come here. I'll go to the grave with Liu er.\" Mammy said, with a small servant girl went to Gu Sanlang couple's grave.The little servant girl suddenly pointed to a stone on the ground: \"mammy! Look! There is something under the stoneMammy's eyes brightened, and she quickly came forward to take away the small stone, only to find that there was only a pile of burning ashes and a piece of paper money.\u2014\u2014Yes, on the way back, Xiao Jingkong suddenly remembered one thing, that is, the paper money for his parents must be burned before they can receive it, and that question is the same!So he turned back, a fire will do the problem burned!So parents can receive it!\"I'm such a smart kid!\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: 95The little maid and mammy brought the ashes back to Gu Jinyu with a handkerchief.Just burned paper ash is able to see a little writing, but it is only a little, just enough for Gu Jinyu to recognize that it is her problem, but can not spell out the complete process of solving the problem.Of course, Gu Jinyu would not have guessed that it was xiaojingkong who burned it up with a torch. He thought it was because he accidentally left the paper in the paper money, which led to the fact that it was burned away together with the paper money.Think of here, her heart is painful, want to spit blood, fainted on the spot!--After dinner, it's still early. Gu Jiao plans to go to the mountain she bought.Recently, she went up and around the mountain when she had nothing to do. In addition to picking herbs and mushrooms, she also wrote down the landform of the whole mountain. Now only the last point is left, she can build a topographic map of the whole mountain.When Xiao Jingkong heard that she was going up the mountain, he tilted his head and asked her, \"can I go with Jiao Jiao?\"Gu Jiao thought, \"do you want to go back to see your master and elder martial brothers?\"Mainly want to stay with you, but also OK.Xiao Jingkong jumped down from the stool and said to Gu Jiao, \"then I'll go and see them.\"The place I went to this time is very close to the temple. Actually, it's a good way.Gu Jiao himself back a small basket, small clearance a face of envy, Gu Jiao so he also made a small basket.The little basket is filled with the gifts he brought to his friends.There are vegetarian meatballs, fried by Gu Jiao.There are sweet scented osmanthus cakes. Gu Jiao bought them.There are wild fruits, picked by Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao's same basket on xiaojingkong's back was very impressive. He went to the old lady's house to show off, and then ran to the next room to show off in front of Xue Ningxiang and Gouwa.Then they went up the mountain.Although xiaojingkong is young and small, he can bear hardships better than most of the children. He is so far away from the other side of the mountain that he insists on walking down.When he went up the mountain, he ran forward with a thump. Gu Jiao followed him calmly. At the middle of the mountain, he finally exhausted his strength and collapsed on the steps, becoming a little salted fishGu Jiao carried the little salted fish \u00b7 Jingkong up the mountain.At the gate of the temple, the little pure space, who has recovered her physical strength, waves to Gu Jiao: \"Jiao Jiao, go and get busy. I'll find Jingfan, Jingxin and Jingshan myself!\"\"Well.\" Gu Jiao watched Xiao Jingkong enter the temple, said hello to a monk eagerly, and called elder martial brother Jingchen. Then she went to measure her mountain.It cost a lot of money to buy this mountain, but the more she walked, the more she thought it was worth it. I don't know how many wild herbs and wild animals are all hers.Maybe today's luck is really good. On the way, she dug two ginseng plants, which are not very big. Stewing chicken soup is enough.Somehow, Gu Jiao suddenly remembered the trap she had laid in the forest, but no one should be so unlucky this time.But as soon as the thought flashed by, there was movement in the forest, as if something had really fallen down.There's the trap she set up.\"No such coincidence...\"Gu Jiao picks her eyebrows.Maybe it's a big bug?A wolf will do.Gu Jiao is full of expectation to harvest her prey, so she goes there to have a look.Er... This time it's a person.Gu Jiao is a little confused.What she does is a trap for catching beasts. Why are people always attracted?But this time it seems that he is not an ordinary man, but a monk.He was dressed in a gray white monk's robe, with a long body. He didn't know what to hold in his arms. A piece of wrist bone exposed outside his sleeve was as white as jade.Xu is to hear the movement of the ground, he raised his head, a not fall secular face so broke into Gu Jiao's line of sight.The monk has a pair of long and narrow peach blossom eyes. There is a tear mole under his right eye. He can't see how old he is. In short, he is very young.Gu Jiao sighed that even monks are so beautiful in this world? Can't it be the goblins in the woods who have come to charm them?Gu Jiao watched him warily.He raised his bright red thin lips and said with a smile, \"this little benefactor, can you pull me up?\"The voice is also very nice!There is a kind of godlike ethereal.Gu Jiao thought, or took out the rope in the basket, pulled him up.Then Gu Jiaocai found a white rabbit in his arms, and in the trap where he had just stayed, there was the body of a poisonous snake.Gu Jiao looked at the snake and the rabbit in his arms, and said, \"did you fall into the trap to save the rabbit?\"\"Well.\" He nodded with a smile.He smiles very gently, but it's not Yao's maternal tenderness, but the tenderness that makes people dizzy and blush.Unfortunately, Gu Jiao is not shy by nature.Because he is good-looking, so Gu Jiao looked more, but Gu Jiao's heart is actually very calm.When Gu Jiao heard him say this, she said, \"you are very kind...\"Before Liang finished, he saw the other side pull out a dagger and kill the hare.Gu JiaoAfter killing the hare, the monk asked Gu Jiao for some water, washed the hare, raised a bonfire and began to barbecue rabbit meat.Gu Jiao is a little confused.Killing and eating meat, I'm afraid it's not a fake monk?\"Do you want it?\" He cut off the fattest piece of rabbit meat and put it in front of Gu Jiao with a daggerGu Jiao: I shouldn't have saved you, so are you thanking me?Gu Jiao didn't eat much for lunch. She was a little hungry now. She took the rabbit and bit it.It's not bad. It's not delicious. It's a waste of food.\"Ah, I forgot to put the salt.\" The monk patted his head, took out a small bamboo tube from the wide sleeve, pulled out the cover, and sprinkled salt on the rabbit meat.\"It should be much better now.\" He cut another piece and handed it to Gu Jiao.Gu Jiao took the rabbit meat. It tasted delicious after it had salt. She asked, \"you saved it just to eat it?\"The monk naturally said, \"otherwise?\"Gu Jiao mouth a draw, the heart way this is which monk in the temple? How come I've never seen it before?The monk pointed to the trap: \"eat snake meat? If you want to, go and get itGu Jiao said, \"why don't you fish yourself?\"The monk sighed, \"I'm afraid.\"Gu Jiao strange way: \"afraid you also killed it.\"\"Not killed.\" The monk stopped, corrected her and said, \"it was bitten to death.\"Gu Jiao\"Why don't you bite it?\"\"It bit me first!\" The monk said solemnly and pulled up his left trouser leg to expose his leg, which was swollen like a pig's hoof.Gu Jiao was stunned.If the snake bites you, you will bite the snake. What is the operation?Snake estimated to die, did not expect that one day he was bitten to death!And you are so bitten by snakes that you are still in the mood to eat roast rabbit? Don't you know you're going to die?The monk seemed to see Gu Jiao's idea and sighed: \"I know.\"Then he fell to the ground with a bang. He vomited black blood and was unconscious!Gu JiaoWhat kind of wonderful monk is this?!It was a poisonous Bungarus multicinctus that bit him. Fortunately, Gu Jiao's small medicine box contained the antivenom of Bungarus multicinctus.Antivenom serum belongs to horse serum preparation, which contains allogeneic protein and is easy to cause allergy.Time is pressing, Gu Jiao gave up desensitization injection, tenderly gave him two injections of anti allergy drugs.When the monk woke up, he was no longer on the lawn. He found himself sitting under a big tree. The sky was raining.He glanced at Gu Jiao beside him and said in a hoarse voice, \"there are so many thunder in spring. Don't you know who can't take shelter from the rain under the trees?\"Gu Jiao glanced at him carelessly and said, \"if you are bitten by a snake, you can calm down the person who roasts a rabbit. I don't think you are afraid of death.\"The monk choked and coughed softly: \"I didn't think I could not live, how could I be a full dead ghost? So... You saved me? \"He opened his trouser legs and had a look. The wound was bandaged with medicine. The pain had basically disappeared and the edema had disappeared.\"You can even cure snake venom. Are you an expert in the world?\" He said strangely.Gu Jiao did not answer his words, just sitting quietly to avoid the rain.About feeling that he owed two people in a row, the monk was embarrassed and said, \"what's your name, benefactor?\"\"Gu.\" Gu Jiao said that she didn't look at him. She had been looking at the continuous heavy rain.The monk said with a smile, \"I know a little bit about physiognomy. I can see a palm for benefactor Gu.\"\"No Gu Jiao light refused.No woman can refuse such a handsome monk. Gu Jiao said, \"he has a younger sister and a younger brother. His younger sister is the queen and his younger brother is the general of Weiyuan. Ah, I forgot to say that he also married Princess Xinyang. He gave birth to a son with Princess Xinyang. It's a great son, but he died young. \"\"Is that all?\" Gu Jiao asked.\"There are still a few concubines, not enough for the road.\" The monk said and looked at Gu Jiao with a smile again. This time, there was a warning in his smile, \"girl, just pick up this token. Don't take it out to show off. It's easy to lead to death. Besides, don't get involved with the people of Xuanping Marquis's house. It will also lead to death. \"He became serious, but even his address changed.Gu Jiao didn't pay attention to his warning. She was never a person who gave the risk to others to judge.However, this Xuanping Marquis house sounds very powerful. How could Xiao LIULANG have the token of Xuanping Marquis house? What is the relationship between him and Xuanping Marquis mansion?\"That if...\" Gu Jiao's words to half, suddenly realized what, turned a look, found just now in his side chattering monk suddenly disappeared.What's more, Gu Jiao didn't know when he left.Gu Jiao has been a stranger for a long time. This time, she really meets a master.Gu Jiao looked at the place where the monk had just sat, and there was a word written with her finger: Xiao.Gu Jiao pondered: \"Xuanping Marquis house... Surnamed Xiao?\"Xiao LIULANG's surname is Xiao. How can it be so coincidental?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: 96Not long after the monk left, the rain stopped. Gu Jiao went to the temple to meet Xiao Jingkong.Xiaojingkong spent a happy and full day in the temple, exactly half a day.He met the gentle and considerate elder martial brother Jingchen, several other elder martial brothers, abbot abbot and his former playmates Jingfan, Jingxin and Jingshan.Because the abbot and his senior brothers are busy, he spent the longest time with the three little monks.Because there was no clear space to grab food, the three young monks had sufficient nutrients, and each one was rounder than before.Small clearance is not the original small clearance - he changed the monk's clothes, dressed in folk children's clothes, small bald head also grew a small pile of hair.In fact, he was the youngest of the young monks, but he spoke the earliest and the best, and even the abbot could not speak of him later.He was very proud to show his small face to the young monks: 'see xiaoyaya? Jiaojiao gave it to me\"I see it, I see it!\" Jingfan said.\"I saw it, too!\" Jingxin said.Jingshan thought about it in a confused way and said slowly, \"I saw it, too!\"Small clearance, great satisfaction.\"Will that bud grow into a little hair (flower) Jingfan asked, pointing to his small face.Xiaojingkong pauses and shakes his head: \"I don't think so. They only grow up to be relatives. They are always on my face!\"\"Can you eat it?\" Jingfan asked.\"I can't eat it.\" Small clearance said.They could neither grow into beautiful hair (flowers) nor eat it. The three little monks were not interested in kissing xiaoyaya.But there's something else in the little clearance.Xiaojingkong decisively took out a can of vegetarian meatballs that Gu Jiao had installed for him. After opening the lid, a delicious smell of scallion oil floated out and almost filled most of the yard.The little monks were shocked.Jingfan stares at his big eyes: \"what is so fragrant?\"Three people's saliva flowed down.Xiaojing wants to eat meat, but she can't, so Gu Jiao thinks of a way to make vegetarian meat for him with tofu and other ingredients.He can eat what he eats at home - for example, when he eats roast duck at home, he also has \"roast duck\"; He also has 'sausage\" when he eats sausage at home; He also has \"braised meat\" when he eats braised meat at home.Recently, he was eating meatballs at home, so he had his own small meatballs.Xiaojingkong ate a small meatball in front of his friends. His strength shocked him!Young monks are shocked again!\"Are you... Are you eating meat?\"\"Don't you faint?\"\"My God, it's terrible! Elder martial brother, I want to go home! \"Xiaojingkong is not a child full of evil taste. After showing off his prestige, he confessed the truth of Meatballs: \"it's vegetarian meat. Jiaojiao says that her family can eat it too!\"At first, the three little monks hesitated and were afraid that they would be cheated by Jingkong to break the precepts. At last, Jingfan, the eldest of the three, tasted it with the spirit of sacrifice that I would not go to hell and who would go to hell, and then it was out of control.There has always been only a rush to eat other people's small clearance encountered the first wave of life rush to eat!He was in a circle for three seconds!He, a temple food Snatcher, focused on food snatching for three and a half years. One day, he was robbed by others?Not only meatballs but also snacks and wild fruits were robbed.The three former losers seem to fill up their skills in a moment, and they have no defensive power in seizing the small clearance.The small fists of the small clearance beat the small chest sadly, come out to mix, really sooner or later to return!Only today did the three little monks know that the food at the foot of the mountain is so delicious!They suddenly want to go down the mountain. What should they do?Apart from the rush for food, the four people get along very well.Xiao Jingkong describes his life at the foot of the mountain to several people. He learns that he is taking in his brother-in-law every day. Little monk Jingfan asks, \"who is brother-in-law? Your father? \"A few of them are still young, and they don't look like xiaojingkong, so they don't know what brother-in-law means, but the man in the family seems to be the father.Xiaojingkong sighed: \"temporary dad, Jiaojiao may change him at any time.\"Xiaojingkong calls Jiaojiao in her mouth, and she takes Gujiao as her mother in her heart, but he can't guarantee whether xiaoliulang is his father or not.After all, according to his observation for so many days, the father has not been officially in charge, and he is in danger of being laid off at any time.Several people talk, I do not know how to talk about their homework.Little monk Jingfan: \"we recited a lot of Buddhist scriptures when you went down the mountain! You don't even have a backJingxin agreed: \"that's itJingshan nods!\"Oh? What do you recite? \"Little monk Jingfan: \"Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra!\"Small clearance hands: \"two years old on the back.\"Little monk Jingxin: \"Buddha says the Sutra of Buddha's original wish of pharmacist!\"Small clearance shrugged: \"two years old three months on the back.\"Little monk Jingshan: \"Leng, Leng Yanjing!\"Xiao Jingkong took out his little ear and sighed helplessly: \"it's the Shurangama Sutra, stupid. All the names are wrong. Do you really have a back? \"Several young monks blushed.Where did they really recite it? But I have written down the names. I've been writing down the names for several days. I'm tired to death!\"Well, it's no fun talking to you. I'll go to the abbot.\" Xiaojingkong jumps down the steps and goes to the abbot with short legs.The abbot just sat down in the Sutra hall and was about to teach the monks. Suddenly, a little monk came to him in a hurry: \"abbot is not well, Jingkong is looking for you! He wants to talk to you about scriptures and Zen! \"The abbot shook his body, and the beads in his hands were scared.So, the essence of Xiaomo came to him to talk about Zen?Want old life also!!!Xiao Jingkong has been learning Buddhist scriptures since he was a child. He is full of curiosity about everything in Buddhist scriptures. When the abbot says one thing, he can ask ten questions, but in the end he can't answer them!\"All appearances are illusory.\" all appearances are illusory. Is the abbot also illusory? Since the abbot is false, what he said to me is also false! So I can't trust the abbot! If you can't believe the abbot, you can't believe the Buddhist scriptures that the abbot told me! The Sutra is also falseAbbot Abbot: Although you are very reasonable, I think there is something wrongThe abbot, adhering to the super high professional quality, came back and patiently explained to him.After listening, he said, \"I don't think what you said is right.\"Abbot: \"what's wrong? You are too young to understand! \"Xiaojingkong: \"the Buddha is so clever. He must have a way to let me understand. It's because you didn't convey his meaning well. It's not my problem, it's the Abbot's problem!\"There are so many conversations like this. Often the abbot didn't persuade him, but he used his own logic to lead the new monks to the wrong side perfectly.The fear of being dominated by small clearance surged into my heart, and the abbot was not good at all.When Gu Jiao finally came to pick up Xiao Jingkong, Xiao Jingkong had already succeeded in asking the monks of the whole Sutra hall with her own efforts!\"Abbot, I'm leaving. We'll discuss this next time.\" Xiaojingkong's hand was led by Gu Jiao. He turned his head and waved his other hand.I wish Fang Zheng's face was dead on the spot: please, don't come, okThe sister and brother went down the mountain hand in hand.Small clearance is ready to move, a bit like running away.However, just after the rain, the road was wet and slippery. Gu Jiao worried that he would roll down like a little wax gourd, and didn't dare to let go.\"Did you have a good time today?\" Gu Jiao suddenly asked.\"Happy Xiaojingkong said with a cute voice, raised his hands and counted them, \"today I saw Jingxin, Jingfan, Jingshan, elder martial brother Jingchen and Abbot...\"He said a lot, basically let him count what he saw in the temple.\"I didn't see your master?\" Gu Jiao asked.Xiaojingkong sighed: \"he is a ghost in the old man's house, and seldom on the mountain.\"Old people?Gu Jiao thought of the wonderful monk in the forest. That monk is very young. Should he be an old man in xiaojingkong's mouth?What Gu Jiao doesn't know is that the old man is just a name given by Xiao Jingkong compared with his age. In fact, his master's age is not big. He is more than 20 years younger than the abbot!Gu Jiao then said, \"is there any pretty monk in the temple? The best looking one. \"The monk's face is almost as good as Xiao LIULANG's. I'm afraid I can't find a second one.\"Yes Small clearance very solemnly raised his head, pointed to himself, \"I!\"Gu JiaoGu Jiao said, \"except you.\"The little monk said firmly: \"no, I'm the most beautiful little monk in the world! They are not good-looking except meMaster is not good-looking!Because Shifu said he was the best looking in the world, but xiaojingkong thought he was the best looking, so he would never admit that Shifu was good-looking!Gu Jiao gave a murmur.Isn't that man the monk in this temple?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: 97When Gu Jiao and Xiao Jingkong went down the mountain, Xiao LIULANG had come back from the Academy.Gu Xiaoshun recently lived in the Academy. First, he broke up with the Gu family completely. Second, he was fascinated by the knife Xiao LIULANG had brought him. Every night he lit a lamp in his bedroom to carve.As for Xiao LIULANG's safety, he doesn't have to worry about it. Recently, second uncle Luo sprained his foot, and the driver of the ox cart was replaced by his son Dazhuang.Dazhuang has a close relationship with Gu Xiaoshun and guarantees to take good care of Xiao LIULANG.Xiao LIULANG is drawing buckets of water into the room. He can see that he has some difficulty.His legs and feet are inconvenient. Gu Jiao seldom lets him do this kind of heavy work. Gu Jiao walks over and takes the bucket from him: \"I'll do it.\"\"I can.\" Xiao LIULANG said.\"You make a fire and I'll cook later.\" Gu Jiao didn't give him the chance to refuse. She took the bucket decisively, picked it up with a shoulder pole, added another bucket, and turned to fetch water at the entrance of the village.Small clearance patted small chest: \"I also want to help Jiaojiao draw water!\"After that, he found his own special tools from the backyard - a mini pole and two mini buckets. He picked them on his small shoulders like Gu Jiao and went to fetch water bravely!Gu Jiao made this set of tools for xiaojingkong, because he wanted to help, but he couldn't lift the big barrel. So Gu Jiao made a pair of light and small wooden barrels for him, which could be sealed without watering, and matched with a small shoulder pole.The total amount of water he picked up was less than a big bowl. On the contrary, Gu Jiao spent a lot of time and energy making tools for him.After arriving at Gujing, Gu Jiao filled the small empty wooden bucket with water. Although he was allowed to carry water, Gu Jiao ordered him not to draw water in the well.Small clearance is very obedient, never close to the ancient well.A big and a small will bring the water home, Gu Jiao's two buckets of water down, the water level in the tank suddenly rose a lot.Two buckets of water with small clearance go down... Er, like no water.But xiaojingkong, looking at the full water tank, still feels that his two handfuls of water have played a great role. He is very proud!\"Silly what?\"It's Xiao LIULANG.As soon as Xiao LIULANG entered the kitchen, he saw a young monk stepping on the bench and looking at the water tank with pride.It's just a water wave. What I don't know is that he's watching the small rivers and mountains he's hit by himself!Hearing the bad brother-in-law's voice, Xiao Jingkong's little face became serious. He raised his eyebrows and looked at him. He hummed coldly: \"I'm working, I'm working!\"Xiao LIULANG was amused by him and wanted to laugh a little: \"you still know how to work. What can a three-year-old boy do?\"Xiaojingkong jumped down from the bench and said angrily, \"I can do much more! More than you! I can draw water! Can feed chicken! Also can help Jiao Jiao wash clothes! I washed half of the clothes at home! I do more work at home than you do! I'm not a kid! You areXiao LIULANG glanced at his toy pole and toy bucket and said, \"then you can really work.\"Let others work.It's tiring to toss about these things.\"Hum!\" In order to prove that he is really a little expert at home, Xiao Jingkong resolutely goes to the wooden basin where he is soaked in clothes, raises his trouser legs, kicks off his shoes, and jumps into the basin. Xiao LIULANG's clothes are just replaced by Xiao LIULANG's clothes!Xiao LIULANG was stunned.Is this the way to wash clothes at home?The little feet of little clearance are happy to step on.He can enjoy treading on water without rain and wash his clothes by the way. He is really a smart and hardworking child!Gu Jiao came out, originally intended to rub the clothes, see small clearance in step on the temporary did not pass.Xiao LIULANG asked incredulously, \"is this the way to wash clothes at home?\"Gu Jiao said: \"not only clothes, but also pickles you eat every day.\"Xiao LIULANG immediately said \"...!\"\"Ha ha!\" Gu Jiao laughed all of a sudden.She seldom laughs so much, but Xiao LIULANG's expression, which seems to be swallowing a fly, really pokes at the point of her two lives.\"I lied to you.\" She said, \"how could I let him step on pickles?\"Xiao LIULANG breathed a sigh of relief: it's OK.Gu Jiao then said: \"his strength is so small that he can't step on it well.\"Xiao LIULANG said once again: --Isn't it that the feet are not clean and can't be eaten?In this way, if the young monk is strong in the future, he will be able to eat pickles for me?The picture is so beautiful that Xiao LIULANG can't bear to look directly at itGu Jiao bent over with a smile.\"Hoo! Hoo After stepping on xiaojingkong, he was so tired that he went back to his room to drink water.Gu Jiao just stepped forward to wash his wrinkled clothes.Xiaojingkong has the heart to work. Gu Jiao never beats his enthusiasm. The big deal is that every time he finishes, she will clean up again.Gu Jiao didn't go up to the level of scientific parenting. She just felt that he had a good time.Gu Jiao didn't know that all his bravery and strength came from Gu Jiao's powerful childhood.\"You don't have to be so used to him.\" Xiao LIULANG said without expression.\"I'm used to you, too.\" Gu Jiao smiles, takes a clean wooden basin, takes out Xiao LIULANG's clothes and puts them in. Then she rubs them gently with her small hands.\"Your clothes don't usually wash like this. Today you put them in the basin by yourself, and he ran into them.\"The clothes of the three of them are all coarse linen. It doesn't matter if you step on them. Xiao LIULANG's hospital clothes are made of silk and cotton. Gu Jiao cleans them in a special wooden basin with light strength.It's light, so it's slow. One of his clothes is worth washing the whole family.But Gu Jiao never said that.Xiao LIULANG was still immersed in the huge impact brought by her sentence \"I am also used to you\". Then he saw that she washed her clothes carefully and seriously. It seemed that her hands, which were white with Gleditsia sinensis, were not grasping his collar, but his heart.For a moment, he felt that the relationship between them was developing in an uncontrollable direction.Xiao LIULANG was in a cold sweat.may not.They are just husband and wife in name. One day they will have to be lenient.The two of them... Absolutely can't produce anything they shouldn't have.During the meal, Xiao LIULANG sat on the bench, and the dry white hospital clothes fluttered in the wind, which made him a little upset.After dinner, Xiao LIULANG takes a bath for Xiao Jingkong, and then takes an ax to chop firewood in the backyard.Gu Jiao is cleaning up the kitchen.The old lady was eating dried waxberry in her room.The sky began to rain.\"Jiao Jiao Jiao!\" Xiaojingkong suddenly ran out from Westinghouse with a pillow in his arms, \"the roof is leaking!\"Gu Jiao went to Westinghouse with him.At the moment, the rain is not big. It should be that the rain in the afternoon accumulated a pile on the tiles, and now it was blown by the wind.The place where the rain leaks is facing their bed. It's not easy to connect them. Moreover, it may break the tiles if it gets too heavy in the middle of the night. The roof is not honest. It's not good to let the heavy rain collapse again.Gu Jiao said: \"I can't sleep here tonight. Sleep with me. When the rain stops, I'll repair the roof.\"Xiaojingkong holds a small pillow and happily goes to Gu Jiao's house.Of course, Xiao LIULANG could only sleep together.Fortunately, Gu Jiao's bed is big enough for the three to lie down.It's just that xiaojingkong doesn't want to give the bed to the bad brother-in-law. After all, the bad brother-in-law is so big that he has to occupy a large space. Unlike his small one, it's enough to stay in her arms.\"Can sleep with Jiao Jiao, happy!\"Xiaojingkong, full of joy, lies on Gu Jiao's bed as he wishes. He puts himself in a big word - Jiao Jiao's quilt on his body, Jiao Jiao's mattress under his body, Jiao Jiao's pillow, Jiao Jiao's pillow towel, Jiao Jiao Jiao JiaoThe little headroom rolled back and forth on the bed with excitement.All of a sudden, the door was pushed open, and a magic hand reached out to him, grabbed his little waistband and picked him up.Small clearance startled hands and feet for a while: \"aunt?\"Old lady: \"you sleep with me tonight.\"Small clearance: \"I don't want it!\"Old lady: \"you want it.\"Small clearance: \"why?\"Old lady: \"for my great grandson.\"The old lady mercilessly took the little guy back to her house.The dream of xiaojingkong has come to nothing. There was an unreasonable brother-in-law before, and an even more unreasonable aunt after. It's so sad to be a child!When Gu Jiao and Xiao LIULANG finish their work, Xiao Jingkong has exhausted her strength in the fight with the old lady, and her head tilts to snore.Gu Jiao didn't say anything. After taking a bath, she went back to the room and lay down.Today, she was tired all day. She slept fast and breathed evenly.Xiao LIULANG came over after taking a bath. She had already fallen asleep on the pillow.An oil lamp was left in the room for him.Now the weather is getting warmer and the thick quilt can't cover it. She's half covered and half kicked.Xiao LIULANG hesitated for a moment and went to pull up the quilt for her.Then he put out the oil lamp and lay down on her side slowly. At first, he turned his back to her, but after a long time, his body was easily numb.So he turned around.But what he didn't know was that Gu Jiao also happened to turn around and move her head on his pillow.His lips rubbed against her face without warning.His brain immediately hummed and went blank.It rained heavily outside, and he was pounding on the tiles, but he didn't hear anything. All he could think about was his heartbeat.He subconsciously raised his hand and intended to push her away, but what he pushed was not the place. The touch was strange and soft, and his mind exploded--Gu Jiao had a good night's sleep.Xu is the golden sore medicine and the herbal medicine Xiao LIULANG seized back to work. When she gets up, she feels that her wound doesn't hurt at all.However, she found a few drops of dried blood on the pillow.\"Why? Whose blood? \"Xiao LIULANG has already started and is burning the sacred fire in the kitchen.Gu Jiao also went to the kitchen after washing.Today's sky is brighter than winter, and the kitchen is no longer dark. Gu Jiao can see Xiao LIULANG's face clearly.She looked for a long time, blinked her eyes and asked, \"didn't you sleep well?\"With two huge black circles under his eyes, Xiao LIULANG said, \"I read a little late.\"\"Oh.\" Gu Jiao went to bed early, so there was no way to know when he saw in his book.Thinking of what, Gu Jiao said: \"by the way, are you hurt? There's blood on the pillow. \"Xiao LIULANG said, \"it's not my blood.\"Gu Jiao doubted: \"is that mine? My wound has healed long agoXiao LIULANG took a deep look at her and said solemnly: \"you're on fire. I've seen your nose bleed.\"Gu Jiao was puzzled: \"I drink Houttuynia tea every day, how can I get angry?\"Xiao LIULANG said without expression: \"who knows?\"Xiao LIULANG's expression is so serious that it's hard for people to doubt. Gu Jiao goes to the main room and pours a big bowl of Houttuynia tea with her nose.After drinking so much, I won't get angry again!Xiao LIULANG closed his eyes with a guilty heart and broke out in a cold sweat.When he had breakfast, Xiao LIULANG suddenly remembered something: \"I forgot to say yesterday that I found a family in the town for elementary school. Today I can take my free time to school.\"All of a sudden, I was forced to go to school with a small clearance of \"...?!\"\"So suddenly?\" Gu Jiao served a bowl of sweet potato porridge for the old lady and Xiao Jingkong.While sucking sweet potato porridge, xiaojingkong watched the bad brother-in-law warily.... I always feel that it's the plot of a bad brother-in-law!\"I forgot to say it yesterday.\" I was teased as soon as I got home. I really forgot.Xiao LIULANG then said: \"when a child of a wealthy family is five years old, he will invite a teacher at home. When he is six or seven years old, he will read a thousand characters and then he will be sent to a clan school or a private school for elementary education. Although he is a little younger, he is so smart that he has had a class in a temple. It's not a big problem.\"For the first time, he was praised by his bad brother-in-law for being smart, but xiaojingkong was more and more alert.Conspiracy, proper conspiracy!\"Where is the elementary school?\" Gu Jiao asked.Xiao LIULANG said: \"near Tianxiang academy, it is a private school that has been open for more than ten years. There is a primary school class in it. The class time is similar to that of me. He can go to school with me every day.\"Come, come, bad brother-in-law will start to separate him from Jiaojiao!Gu Jiao had a kindergarten in her previous life, so her acceptance of three-year-old children going to school is very high.Gu Jiao is not at home, small clearance is a small trumpet master, all day long, the old lady suffered, also happy to see him go to school.Gu Jiao turns her head and looks at xiaojingkong: \"does Jingkong want to go to school?\"No!Xiaojing's empty words leave an eye on her lips. If she says she doesn't want to go to school, isn't she a child who is tired of learning?The bad brother-in-law really digs holes for him!Fortunately, I am smart!\"If I go to school, Jiaojiao will not see me all day,\" xiaojingkong saidGu Jiao touched his small head: \"it's OK. I'll see you off in the morning and wait for you at the village entrance in the evening. If I have time, I'll pick you up at the private school.\"Speaking of this, xiaojingkong is not a sensible child if she refuses again.He swallowed the sweet potato porridge in his mouth and squeezed out a cute smile: \"well, since Jiaojiao wants me to go to school, I'll go!\"School is a must, but in order to save the day did not see the loss of Gu Jiao, small clearance for their own ask for two parting little relatives.It's not cheap to start a school. If you spend two taels of silver a month, you can have lunch. If you don't go to school, you won't get a refund.Gu Jiao put two liang of silver into xiaojingkong's pocket. He insisted that he should pay shuxiu by himself, instead of breaking his brother-in-law.A big one and a small one get on the ox cart and go to school.Gu Jiao is at home pondering how to repair the roof.She went to the roof to have a look, and found that there were a lot of broken tiles. In a few more heavy rains, it was estimated that all three rooms would leak.She decided to repair the whole roof and, by the way, build two small rooms on the East and west sides of the backyard, so that Gu Xiaoshun would not worry about having no place to live in the village.She had some silver on hand, but it was not enough for her to do so many things. She went to Zhouji bank in the town and took twenty Liang silver. By the way, she asked how much money was left in it.As a result, the bank manager told her: \"one thousand and one hundred Liang.\"Gu Jiao was confused for three seconds.\"Are you mistaken? Not 112? One thousand and one hundred liang? \"The shopkeeper said with a smile: \"our Zhouji bank is about credit. We can't blackmail the girl's money without conscience.\"When Xiao LIULANG gave her the pair of cards, she didn't think much about it. She just thought it was a hundred eighty-two. She never expected so much.In fact, it used to be more, but it took a hundred Liang to buy a brush for Gu Jiao. That's a unique master work of Quan Zhaoguo. Poor Gu Jiao, he has been complaining about his straight man for a long time.The other twenty Liang are the travel expenses Gu Jiao put in Xiao LIULANG's burden. Xiao LIULANG has not spent all of them, but has also been put into the bank.Gu Jiao is a little suspicious of life: \"did he really go to the exam?\"Are you sure you're not going to Fucheng to carry out copy business?Then Gu Jiao suddenly remembered the fraud in the hospital examination that President Li mentioned to her. President Li said that she didn't know why Xiao LIULANG didn't take the exam again. Gu Jiao thought that she probably knew.--After getting the money, Gu Jiao went back to the village to repair the house. She invited some craftsmen from the village to tell them what she wanted, so that they could repair the house in the shortest time.As long as they give more money, they don't worry about people's work. What's more, this is Xiao Xiucai's home. They hope that in the future Xiao LIULANG high school will be able to hang a few acres of free land under Xiao LIULANG's name.Gu Jiao is in full swing to repair the house, but Gu Jinyu is suddenly ill.The night she went back from Qingquan village, she didn't feel right. She just thought that she was tired and didn't go to her heart. She started a fever in the middle of the night.The old servant woman of the villa said that it was something unclean when she went to the grave.The imperial doctor prescribed the medicine, but it had little effect.Marquis Gu was very anxious: \"if I had known, I would not have let Jinyu go to the grave!\"\"Cough...\" Gu Jinyu covered her mouth with a handkerchief and coughed twice. She asked weakly, \"I'm ok. How's my brother?\"Gu Yan is not comfortable these two days. The main reason is that he is naturally weak. After a night of excitement, he overdraw his body.In order to prevent him from running around, Yao had to stay in front of his bed.\"He's fine.\" When it comes to this, marquis Gu is very pleased. His son's body is really much stronger than before. If he dared to do so in the past, he would have lost his life. Now he only lies on the bed for a few days and then he is alive again.However, for the sake of caution, he and Yao both felt that they should let their son rest in the room for a few more days.\"If my brother is OK.\" Gu Jinyu coughed.\"Oh, you are so sick that you worry about your brother,\" said Marquis GuGu Jinyu smile: \"he is my only brother after all.\"Marquis Gu thought of the unfilial girl Gu Jiao, gritted his teeth and said, \"if only the girl could be half as sensible as you. I've heard what Huang Zhong said that day. She gave you a look, didn't she? I don't think you ran into something dirty. It just made that girl angry! \"Gu Jinyu said in a hurry: \"Dad, don't say that about my sister. My sister has been growing up in the countryside these years, and that family is not good to her. She just suffered too much and doesn't know how to deal with people. If it were me, it would not be better than my sister. \"\"You are so kind-hearted,\" said Marquis GuGu Jinyu shook his head: \"my sister is really not responsible for my illness. I blame myself.\"After a pause, she told Marquis Gu about losing the paper.\"My aunt had high hopes for me, but I lost half of the problem I had solved. I fell ill in a hurry.\"Gu Hou Ye patted the back of her hand: 'silly girl, what's so urgent? Even if you can't do it, your aunt won't blame you. \"\"Really?\" Gu Jinyu didn't believe it.Marquis Gu laughed mysteriously: \"your aunt wrote again. Guess what she said in her letter?\"Gu Jinyu thought seriously: \"let my father take me back to Beijing as soon as possible?\"Marquis Gu said, \"this is nature. What else?\"Gu Jinyu's eyebrows slightly frowned: \"my daughter can't guess.\"Marquis Gu gave her a pet look and said with a proud smile, \"your aunt has prepared a big gift for you. I'm going to give you a surprise when you go back to Beijing. It's OK to tell you earlier. Your aunt asked for grace from your majesty. On the day you arrived at the hairpin, your majesty will personally order you to be the head of the county! \"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: 98Yao stayed in front of his son's bed in the room with fragrance of medicine. He was so tired that he leaned against the bed post and went to sleep.Gu Yan quietly opened his eyes. The thief looked at Yao for a while, and then he stretched out his slender hand and shook it in front of Yao's eyes.To make sure that Yao was really asleep, he gave a bad smile, slowly opened the quilt and crept out of bed.It's so big. I'm used to blowing wind and drinking rain. I'm so careful for the first time. It's strange that it's fresh.Gu Yan went out of the house like a thief.Yao's body shakes for a while. Gu Yan is so scared that he almost falls ill. Fortunately, Yao doesn't wake up, and he continues to sleep.The servant girl on duty is also led away by the dark guard at this time. He just goes out of the yard to join them.Unexpectedly, as soon as he entered the front yard, he was caught by Yu ya'er.Yu ya'er, holding a newly sewn quilt, looked at him strangely and said, \"young master, what are you doing? Didn't madam let you lie down in bed? Why did you come out without shoes? \"Gu Yan cleared his throat: \"do you believe me when I say I come out for a walk?\"Jade bud son black under small face, an arm clip quilt, another hand fork waist way: \"do you want to run again?\"Gu Yan blinked with a guilty heart.Yu ya'er stares: \"you really want to run! no way! You can't go out! \"Gu Yan's dangerous eyes narrowed and suddenly became murderous: \"believe it or not, I killed you!\"Yu ya'er looked at death as if she were going home and said, \"you can't go out even if you kill me!\"Gu Yan had no choice but to help his forehead.This girl dead brain, would rather die than surrender, at the beginning is so for Gu Jiao frankly, now is also so he blocked in the backyard!Gu Yan is also willing to compromise, but that was in the past. Now he wants to meet the most important people in his life. He doesn't want any face!Gu Yan, who was still murderous a moment ago, performed Sichuan Opera in a second!He put on an expression of weeping, and looked at Yu ya'er curtly. How pitiful he was.If he screamed again, Yu ya'er would almost think that he was possessed by a little suckling dog.\"Little, little, little boy... What's the matter with you?\" Yu ya'er can't resist such a weak and deceiving young master!Gu Yan wrongly bit red lips: \"I want to go out for a breath, just for a while.\"Yu ya'er was hit by Meng Sha: \"one... One? Really... Really just a minute? \"Gu Yan nodded coquettishly: \"well.\"Yu ya'er covered her heart: \"that's ok... Go ahead... I'll guard here.\"I can't do it. She's going to rub the little boy's head if she stays any longer!Gu Yan successfully cheated Yu ya'er. As soon as he came out of the yard, he looked cold and his lips started to look bad.He successfully came to the small garden to meet with the dark Wei. The dark Wei took him out of the house, got on the carriage already prepared, and galloped all the way to Qingquan village!Aware of Gu Yan's whereabouts, Huang Zhong goes to Lanting pavilion to report to Marquis Gu.Marquis Gu asked him to speak outside the door.Huang Zhong said: \"young master has slipped out of the house! It looks like it's going to the other end of town! \"\"Town?\" Marquis Gu frowned.Gu Jinyu looked at his father and said, \"Dad, did my brother go to see my sister?\"\"Nine times out of ten I went to her.\" Marquis Gu knew that his son could not be locked up. He was not too surprised by the result.\"Do you want my brother back?\"Marquis Gu shook his head: \"you don't know his temperament. Besides your mother, who can stop him?\"To put it bluntly, Gu Yan only gave Yao face in the whole house.If he sent someone to catch him, there would be only two results, one is Gu Yan's Secret guard, the other is Gu Yan's anger.Marquis Gu waved his hand: \"forget it, let him go!\"Anyway, that girl won't bully Gu Yan.In addition, he has another consideration.The sister and brother are close to each other. Maybe Gu Yan can let the girl go back to the Hou mansion willingly.It's not that he is eager to recognize that girl, but Yao and Gu Yan like her very much, and he can only accept her.Just after noon, there were not many pedestrians on the street, and the carriage arrived at Qingquan village unimpeded.Recently, there are always carriages running to the village. The villagers are not surprised. However, when they see a beautiful young man walking down from the carriage, they are still shocked.Gu Yan had a clean and pure temperament, just like a piece of jade that had been tempered without any impurities.The most beautiful person in the village is Xiao LIULANG, followed by Gu Dashun, but there is still a big difference between them. The gap between this young man and Xiao LIULANG is not big, even almost No.The villagers looked straight.\"This... Which family is this? Who are you looking for? \"\"Can I come to you? Of course, I'm looking for LIULANG and jiaoniang! \"The villagers who draw water at the entrance of the village make fun of each other.In the past, this kind of noble man must have come to look for the old Gu family. But a while ago, the old Gu suddenly stopped being Li Zheng. Wu told people that the old Gu was too old to be bothered by the villagers, so he took the initiative to resign.But in the village, it is said that they have offended others and been punished.As for who was offended, the villagers speculated that it was Xiao LIULANG's family - Xiao LIULANG was admitted to Xi Sheng, and his grades were better than Gu Dashun's. the county magistrate valued him, and it was no surprise to teach an old Gu family a lesson for him!Gu Jiao's family is repairing their house recently, and they have built two new large brick houses. They were just completed this morning. Gu Jiao is working with the craftsmen to move in the additional furniture.After moving the last wardrobe, Gu Jiao felt that someone was coming behind her.The man gave her a slight poke on the shoulder.With Yao's warning, Gu Jiao is not so careless now. She turns around calmly and sees Gu Yan who is going to stab her with her finger for the second time.Gu Yan didn't expect that she would turn around so soon, and was stunned.It was like the little suckling dog in Chuang Tzu.Gu Jiao chuckled: \"are you here?\"Gu Yan said with a smile, \"well, I've come to see you.\"Gu Jiao looked at him sweating, probably guessed how anxious he was on the way, she pointed to the chair in the hall: \"you sit down, I'll pour you a cup of tea.\"Gu Yan sat down on the chair.Gu Jiao goes to the kitchen to pour hot tea for him. He begins to look at the room. Gu Yan, who has been well-dressed since he was a child, has never been to such a shabby house. Let alone Hou's house, even the Chaifang of the villa is much wider than here.Gu Yan's initial excitement gradually cooled down, and he felt great heartache.It's true that my heart is hurting.The fetters of the dragon and Phoenix fetuses make him feel deeply for Gu Jiao more than anyone else.When Gu Jiao comes with a big bowl of hot tea, Gu Yan suddenly hugs her waist and sticks her head tightly to her stomach.He has never been so close to Yao since he was three years old.But at this moment, his heart really hurt.Gu Jiao is a very observant person when she carries out a task, but she is a bit slow on weekdays. However, there is such a person in the world who can feel his happiness, anger and sorrow without guessing and thinking.This is probably the reaction of the twins.Gu Jiao knows that he loves himself.Gu Jiao put the tea bowl on the table and patted his head gently: \"I'm fine.\"\"Well.\" Gu Yan buries his face on her.Gu Jiao's eyes suddenly shed a tear.Gu Jiao oddly wiped it with her index finger and said to Gu Yan, \"hmm? Are you crying? \"\"I didn't.\" Gu Yan choked and denied.Gu Jiao patted his head and motioned him to look up at the tears of his fingertips: \"you are crying.\"Her eyes cried with him.It is worthy of the title of \"dragon and phoenix\".Gu Jiao feels amazing!After wiping his tears, Gu Yan raised his head and looked at her as if nothing had happened: \"I'm hungry.\"Gu Jiao said, \"I'll make food for you.\"Gu Yan asked, \"can I have a look?\"He was referring to the house.\"Well.\" Gu Jiao nodded and thought of something. She pointed to her aunt's room and said, \"aunt is sleeping. Just don't disturb her.\"Gu Yan wandered around the house, saying that the house was far fetched. It was just a courtyard. The entrance was a bright hall with east room and Westinghouse on both sides, and the old lady's little east room.Passing through the main hall is a backyard. To the north is a kitchen and a firewood house. To the East are two new rooms. To the West are a small chicken house and a small vegetable garden.\"This room seems to be empty.\" Gu Yan pointed to a room in the East and said.While picking vegetables in a small vegetable garden, Gu Jiao said, \"it's Xiaoshun's house. It's just built. When others are in the Academy, they will come back after ten days off. \"\"Is that the brother who looks after the family?\" Gu Yan asked sourly.Gu Yan heard something about Gu's family. He knew that the family was not good, but Gu Xiaoshun and Gu Jiao had a good relationship.\"Well, that's him.\" Gu Jiao nodded.\"And this one?\" Gu Yan pointed to the brand-new henhouse beside him, which was much bigger than the dog house in his yard!Gu Jiao said: \"it's a clean chicken house. He has a few chickens. He went to school and came back in the evening. \"Gu Yan also knew the little monk she had brought back from the mountain.Gu Yan only feels the sea of vinegar surging. Who is her brother?Gu Jiao paused and asked him, \"do you... Want to live here? If you want, you can live in Xiaoshun... \"Let him live in Gu Xiaoshun's house?Gu Yan was so angry that he snorted and said, \"I don't want to live here!\"Gu Jiao said regretfully, \"well, that's OK.\"Gu Yan coldly pointed to Gu Xiaoshun next door, smelly face asked: \"which brother's house is this?\"\"My brother.\" Gu Jiao said.\"My brother? Oh! Wait, what are you talking about? Kiss, kiss my brother? \" Gu Yan pointed to himself uncertainly, \"mine?\"Just now, he was not allowed to live in Gu Xiaoshun's house, but next door to Gu Xiaoshun?\"Well.\" Gu Jiao nodded, \"but you don't want to --\"\"Yes, yes, yes\"Before Gu Jiao's words were finished, Gu Yan flashed into his room, slammed the door shut and bolted the door in place!No one is allowed to get him out of the house!From now on, he will sprout here!!!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: 99The two dark guards were speechless.Is this a gold house or a silver house? As for the excitement, is it like this? I'm afraid someone will take you out. Look at that leg!Forget that you are a congenital heart disease?Forget that our firewood house is bigger and more luxurious than this farmyard?I do not know who day by day dislike villa residential environment is not good, not high-end atmosphere on the grade!Hum!Double standard!Although two of them were able to get their own little master out of the house, he could not get away from him. He could not help but make complaints about himself.Can't fight, can't move, can't be angry, this is their family's disease, petite!Dark guard armour: \"how to do?\"Dark Wei Yi: \"what can I do? Keep itDark guard armour: \"I mean the other side of the villa. It's not the way to keep going. They'll send someone to look for it.\"If you find it, you will disturb the scene between the young master and the young lady. In that case, the young master will lose his temper, and he will easily get sick if he loses his temperTwo people sigh together!Why do they have such a delicate little master?After some negotiation, they decided to stay here and go to the villa to report a letter.In the villa, marquis Gu is directing his subordinates to repair Gu Yan's yard, mainly to prepare a clean and tidy room for Gu Jiao, build a small flower shed, and then replace her with brand-new and valuable furniture.It's an established fact to recognize that girl. He can't resist.He wants to establish the image of a good father.... show it to Yao.\"Make the shed wider!\" Marquis Gu said seriously.The next humanitarian: \"Hou ye, no matter how wide you are, you'll have to press the pear tree of the young master.\"\"If you cut him down, he won't even say it,\" said Marquis GuAs long as it's for that girl and Gu Yan's own house is demolished, Gu Yan won't have two words!Thinking that he accidentally cut off a pear branch with his sword, the boy was angry with him for a whole month, so Marquis Gu was a little bit subdued.Huang Zhongzhuo said: \"Marquis, is it too early to repair the house? Will the first lady really come to stay? If she doesn't come, don't you move the young master's pear tree in vain? \"Marquis Gu said with a smile: \"with a hundred hearts, she will come! She can't refuse Yan'er because she has such a good relationship with her sister and brother. \"Huang Zhong seemed to know nothing about it. After thinking about it, he said, \"what if the young master didn't ask?\"Marquis Gu glared at him: \"how could he not ask? Don't you see how much he likes that girl? I didn't know it was his sister before, but now I know, can I take her home? \"Two people talk, dark Wei Yi came to Gu Hou ye in front of.Huang Zhong pulled out his sword.Dark Wei Yi flashed out a token: \"I'm the dark Wei of the young master. I'm here to report to the marquis.\"The secret guards around Gu Yan were arranged by the old Marquis. When he was young, the old Marquis trained an army of his own. Later, the army was incorporated by the imperial court, and some of the soldiers who could no longer fight were left by the old Marquis.These dark guards are their descendants. They have excellent martial arts skills and mysterious deeds, but there are not many. Marquis Gu has no one around him.Marquis Gu also saw the old man's dark Wei for the first time. He squinted and said, \"Yan'er asked you to report? Yes? If you bring a girl back, do you have to let the Marquis prepare in advance? \"Dark Wei second way: \"Hou Ye misunderstood, not small childe let me come, small childe have no time to talk to me, I am to tell Hou ye, small childe don't come back.\"\"What, what? Who's not coming back? \" Marquis Gu suspected that he had heard wrong.Dark Wei Yi also suspected that his ears were not working well. He thought about it seriously and said clearly: \"your son, Gu Yan.\"Marquis Gu was confused: \"why didn't he come back?\"Dark Wei Yi calm way: \"he lived in the young lady's house.\" After a pause, worried that he didn't hear it clearly, he said, \"it's your daughter, Gu Jiao.\"\"Don't tell me! I know it's the girlDark Wei Yi a face oddly looks at him: \"really strange, I say young master you didn't react to come over is your son, I say young lady you react to come over is that wench, are you too eccentric?\"Marquis Gu: I can't believe it. Can I understand it?!Dark Wei Yi doesn't understand.Not in the killer class.Marquis Gu is so angry that his heart aches. He asks you to turn the girl back. Who let you be abducted by the girl?!The news soon spread to Yao.Yao's family has moved to Yan's yard. In fact, not long after Gu Yan left, she woke up.Sure enough, he didn't look at his son, but Yao shook his head.She didn't let her son go out. In fact, she wasn't completely worried about her son's health. She was also thinking about whether her daughter had digested her life experience and whether her son's rash going to find her would make her worry.When he learned that Gu Yan was living in his daughter's village, Yao was relieved.If her daughter is willing to accept Gu Yan, it means that she doesn't feel disturbed. Maybe she has accepted her life experience.But mammy Fang was worried: \"madam, the conditions in the village are so poor. How can young master Jin Zunyu be used to living?\"Mammy Fang is a bit headstrong and disgusting, but her loyalty to Yao and Gu Yan is not false. As for Gu Jiao, she is not used to her now.Yao's smile, said: \"Jiaojiao will take care of him.\"Mammy Fang said, \"I'm not used to eating.\"Yao said in a warm voice: \"Jiaojiao is a doctor. She knows more than us. She knows what Yan'er can and can't eat. And as long as it's made by her, Yan'er won't get used to it. \"Mammy Fang didn't think so: 'she is just a little medicine boy. She happened to treat her wife twice. It doesn't mean that she is good at medicine.\"Yao shook Mammy's hand and said gently and solemnly, \"Mammy, you don't know Jiaojiao. When you do, you will like her.\"Mammy Fang shook her head secretly.As servants, do they like the master or not? Since she is the daughter of her wife, she will regard her as her own little master in the future. She will make amends to her in the future.However, the child's heart was so cold that she was afraid that his wife would not cover it.When Marquis Gu came to find Yao, Yao was packing.Marquis Gu asked suspiciously, \"what are you doing?\"Yao said, \"pack up some clothes for Yan'er and send them to him.\"The tone was mild.At present, she doesn't know about Marquis Gu's injury to Gu Jiao. Gu Jiao is not a complainant. Even if she is, she won't poke her grudge against Marquis Gu to Yao. Yao has a serious hysteria and depression tendency. As a doctor, Gu Jiao will try to avoid her being stimulated.Yao found her daughter, in a good mood, together with the face of marquis Gu are good-looking a lot.Marquis Gu felt relieved, but after reflecting the meaning of this sentence, he was not very well: \"do you want to send clothes to Yan'er? Are you really going to let Yan'er live there? \"\"No?\" Yao asked.\"Ah...\" Marquis Gu wanted to talk and stopped, and finally Yao didn't give him a look. If he didn't know what to do, Yao would have to ignore him. He said with a smile, \"yes, yes. I'm not worried that Yan'er can't live without you?\"\"So it is.\" Yao nodded.Gu Hou Ye's heart is a happy, but listen to Yao Shi way: \"or I also move in.\"Marquis GuStop! Stop!How can you move there?!\"Forget it, I'd better not be in such a hurry. It will frighten her.\" Yao felt her daughter's rejection of her last time. It may not be appropriate. In short, her daughter doesn't seem to be ready to accept her.Lord Gu was relieved.But not relieved to the end, Yao said: \"or... I'd better ask her?\"Lord Gu shook his head like a rattle!All of a sudden, marquis Gu had an idea. He grabbed the picture on the table and said to Yao: \"Oh, she has suffered so many years before we appeared. She must not be so easy to accept us in her heart. It will frighten her to go like this! Let Yan'er persuade her for a few days first! If you really miss her, just look at her picture more! \"\"There seems to be some truth in what you say.\" Yao really missed his daughter. The portrait was on the table, and he couldn't see it day and night.Yao's eyes fell on the portrait of his daughter, and his face became gentle.\"Hou ye,\" Yao suddenly said, \"what do you think about the red spots on Jiao Jiao's face? Is she ill? \"She had wanted to ask for this for a long time, but in the past she and Gu Jiao were passers-by, so it was not convenient to ask. Later, although she knew each other, she didn't have time to ask.Marquis Gu said, \"I didn't get sick. The family said that they were born with it. They came back from the temple. It's not so obvious when I'm young. The bigger I get, the bigger the birthmark will open\"No way.\" Yao frowned and shook his head, \"when my daughter was just born, I had a look. It's no different from ordinary babies. If there is a birthmark, I won't forget it.\"Gu Hou Ye Mou son a stare: \"can't make a mistake again!\"Isn't that girl his flesh and blood with Yao's?\"Jiaojiao is my daughter. I'm sure, but I don't understand why her face is like this.\"Wenpo passed away, and the people went back to their hometown. For a while, I really didn't know where to look for the people of that night.Yao pondered for a moment, a flash in his mind: \"no, there is another person who has seen Jiaojiao.\"\"Who?\"\"Abbot.\"--They immediately left for the temple.After listening to their intentions, the abbot was not very well: \"what did you say? Wrong? The girl with the birthmark on her face is the daughter of the MarquisYao's warm voice with a trace of urgency: \"yes, the abbot should have seen her, she came to the temple to see you twice.\"If the abbot can't figure out who the man is, it's hard to say.Is that memory not his drunken dream, but his shaking hands and pointing a big lump of palace sand on the baby's face?\"Amitabha... Sin, sin!\"Abbot Khan Yan explained the incident.When Zhao state's big family Qianjin was born, she would let wenpo point on the palace sand, and the servants around Yao also told wenpo at that time.But no one in the countryside ordered this. Wenpo didn't have that skill. She couldn't say she couldn't. She was afraid she couldn't get the money, so she went to the abbot.If the abbot is sober, he won't agree, because he was fooled by the younger martial brother who didn't know how to drink pear blossom wine.He got drunk in one bite.He said he didn't order the palace sand.Wenpo said, but you've given the monks in the temple a scar. Isn't that the same?The drunk Abbot felt that what wenpo said was reasonable!So he went.So he shook his hands.Later, it seemed that he wanted to find his younger martial brother, but he fell to the ground and fell asleep on the way.He slept for three days and three nights. The first thing he did when he woke up, he went to see Yao to make amends. As a result, he saw Yao holding a white baby girl. The baby girl's face was white. Where was the trace of guarding the palace?Wenpo also went down the mountain and never met her again.\"... I always thought I had a dream.\"Marquis Gu asked, \"what about Xu? Didn't she see something on the child's face? \"The abbot said, \"Xu Shi was in a coma after giving birth and woke up the next day. The poor monk dares to guess that when she sees the child, the child is probably wrong. \"Because Xu was in a coma and couldn't take care of her children, wenpo put her two children in the same room. Gu Jinyu, who was born first, was one or two hours late.Children use Yao's swaddling clothes, so at first glance, it's really easy to be confused.Wenpo was also present, but she had a stomachache and went to the toilet. When she came back, shougongsha had already finished.Although we can't find wenpo to prove it, it's not difficult for Yao and houye to guess the situation at that time.The child's Shougong sand was on her face. Wenpo knew that something had happened and went down the mountain for an excuse all night.When the servants of Houfu came to hold the child, they saw that Gu Jiao had a red birthmark on her face. There was nothing on her face. They took her for granted as Xu's child.After that, the little girl's arm didn't have the palace sand, so Yao thought it was not good to fall off. After returning to Beijing, she asked someone to order it for Gu Jinyu.This should be the whole process.After the couple left, the abbot could not calm down for a long time.With a cold face, he went to his younger martial brother's yard and found a monk who was lying in the sun under the tree without any image. He indignantly said: \"do you know you made a big mistake for me?\"The monk took down the Buddhist Scripture on his face, revealing a beautiful face like a demon.Under the sun, a pair of peach blossom eyes are shining, like a pool of spring water.On the stone stool beside him was a silver mask with the upper half of his face.There are not many people who have seen him. The elder martial brother of the abbot is one of them, and so is the little girl in the forest that day.He put out his hand innocently and said with a smile, \"how can I blame this? I didn't know that the first time I brewed wine would be so powerful? \"The abbot was very angry: \"you still deny it! You lied to me that it wasn't wineHe sighed, \"how old was I then? I'm still a child. Elder martial brother, you've been fooled by a child. Aren't you not smart enough? What's more, I didn't mean to. I'm really not sure I've made wine successfully. I'm a child and can't drink. I can only ask my elder martial brother to try it first. \"Abbot fried hair: \"do you want me to test wine or poison?\"Monk innocent way: \"cough, elder martial brother, see through, don't say wear, save face.\"The abbot in charge was angry to death: \"besides, who said that he was a child when he was 12 years old? The clearance is all up to you, so you can toss people! \"When it comes to headroom, the monk is silent for a few seconds, as if he can't refute the fact that small headroom is particularly frustrating.As a matter of fact, this younger martial brother is a genius. He always likes to make some strange inventions. No one has ever taught him. He goes down the mountain to watch them and then comes back to make them himself.Wine is not the most terrible. Once he mixed it with insect repellent powder. As a result, it was made into arsenic, which poisoned the monks of the whole temple.He almost died himself.The abbot asked him more than once: How did you grow up so big?The monk said with a smile: \"well, I cheated elder martial brother Abbot once, but you also sold my apprentice. We are even!\"The abbot said, \"aren't you happier than anyone when the clearance is gone? How can this be even? \"He spread out his hand and sighed: \"elder martial brother, it's agreed to save face. How can I be so happy? I'm just a little happy, the rest is sadThe abbot gave him a cold look: \"Oh, right? Then I'll go and get the clearance back! \"He stood up and said, \"Oh, no!\"--But after Yao went down the mountain, he let the carriage go to Qingquan village and sent things to the two children, including Gu Yan's clothes and Yao's selected clothes for Gu Jiao.Gu Yan thought they were coming to take him back to the house, and said nothing came out of the house.Yao had to give all the clothes to Gu Jiao.Xiaojingkong went to school, no one stopped him, but he was blocked by some chickens at the door!A few chicks, chirping and chirping, jumped to the threshold and lined up in a row!The chicks looked at him covetously and pecked him as soon as he got close!Marquis Gu wanted to kick them, but as soon as he raised his feet, the chickens began to chirp!Yao looked at him.He closes his feet, stands up and smiles!Marquis Gu: in his lifetime, I will lose to some chickens!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: 100No, people's chickens are all chirping. Why are these chickens all chirping?The saddest thing in the world is that the chicken speaks bird language, and he still can't speak TurkicYao found that her daughter's house had been repaired, the roof tiles had been replaced, the backyard had been enclosed, and two more rooms had been built.\"Jiaojiao.\" Yao said to his daughter who was pouring water into the pot, \"can I... Live here for a few days?\"Gu Jiao put the bucket aside after pouring the water and looked at Yao's slightly puzzled.Yao said, \"I can help you with your work.\"Although Yao was born in a wealthy family, she has not developed a spoiled temperament.Of course, it's far fetched to do farm work in the countryside, but my daughter can suffer from it. Why can't she be a mother?\"No, I can do it myself.\" Gu Jiao refused.There was a trace of loss in Yao's eyes. She knew that what her daughter refused was not work, but her.\"Then... I can cook! I'm a good cook! Didn't you boast that my snacks were delicious last time? I do it for you every day! \"\"Not at all.\" Gu Jiao said.\"What about washing clothes! You see, there are so many people in the family. How can you be busy by yourself? \"Gu Jiao pauses and looks up at Yao.She didn't speak and just looked at her.Yao suddenly understood.My daughter doesn't need her to work, she doesn't need her to live here.It's not that she didn't guess the result, but she didn't give up. She was worried after all.Yao's heart depressed bitterness, as if nothing had happened to smile: \"that Yan'er please you, it's late, you go to your busy, I also went back.\"Then she turned away with a smile.Her expression and tone were impeccable, but her trembling body revealed her sadness.Gu Jiao looked at her back and said, \"it's not your problem.\"Yao's step is a meal.Gu Jiao hesitated for a moment. In expressing her emotions, she was not good at words: \"it's mine.\"She said so, I don't know if Yao can understand.She had very bad parents, which made her reject all the parents in the world.When she grew up, she had her own life. She thought she didn't care any more. With the appearance of Yao, she realized that the hole in her heart had never healed.She can accept Xiao LIULANG, Xiao Jingkong and Gu Yan because they will not be her parents.But these words, she can't say to Yao.Yao looked at Gu Jiao for a moment. She once thought that her daughter didn't accept her because she couldn't forget Gu Sanlang and his wife. Now she's suddenly not so sure.Something must have happened to her daughter, but she refused to say it, and she couldn't bear to ask.Yao reluctantly took the carriage back to the villa.Gu Jiao continues to make a fire to cook.The rice steamed slowly.I don't know if the arrival of Yao reminds her of some things she didn't want to recall. She thinks of herself when she was two years old.At that time, she was wearing a thin pajamas, holding a doll, barefoot standing in the cold winter night.She was forced out of the bed and didn't even wear a pair of shoes.Her parents broke out a fierce quarrel, in fact, because of a very small thing, but the quarrel can not be stopped, and finally the quarrel fell on her head.She was pushed back and forth, fell several times and broke her hand.At the beginning, the man named father went away in anger, and then the woman named mother also left.She was abandoned in the crowded square, she watched a giant in front of her in a hurry, she felt like a tiny ant.\"Mom - whoa - Mom\"She was terrified. She cried.But the woman called mom didn't come back.The man named dad didn't show up either.--The rice is not steamed so fast. Gu Jiao first gives Gu Yan two poached eggs in sugar water. Gu Jiao goes to the door of his house to call him.\"Have they both gone?\" Gu Yan asked.\"Gone.\" Gu Jiao said.Gu Yan just opened the door, but he didn't open it completely. He just opened a small crack, stretched out his head and looked around. He was sure that there was no father or mother before he came out.When the old lady woke up, Gu Jiao cooked a bowl for her, and then told her about Gu Yan's stay.The old lady looked at the delicate young man in front of her. She couldn't tell why. She always felt that she had seen him somewhere.\u2014\u2014Yes, the emperor liked the dragon and Phoenix fetuses in Xuanping Marquis's house very much. She asked Shufei to take the dragon and Phoenix fetuses to the Empress Dowager to have a rest. So the old lady did meet Xiaogu Yan.It's just that she doesn't like children. She just let people leave after giving them something. Now she can't even remember that.Gu Yan was still young at that time, and could not remember what the Empress Dowager was like, so they sat face to face, and no one recognized each other.The old lady looked at the sugar water in her bowl and Gu Yan's, and smacked: \"I'll exchange it with you.\"The old lady wants to avoid eating. The sugar water Gu Jiao gave her is not sweet enough. Gu Yan's is sweet.Gu Yan didn't know the truth, so he changed with her generously.After changing with Gu Yan, the old lady ate the sweet egg she had always wanted!Woo, it's so delicious that I'm going to cry!Before Gu Yan came home, the old lady liked Gu Xiaoshun the most, because Gu Xiaoshun was the easiest to be used to routine, and could help her save a few preserves at any time. As for Xiao LIULANG and Xiao Jingkong, one was too clever and the other was too principled, so the old lady couldn't do routine.Gu Yan's fighting power is obviously stronger than Gu Hanhan's. on the first day of his coming, he let the old lady eat eggs with sugar water.For the sake of her sugar egg business, the old lady decided that this young man, she covered up!--But he said that after Yao and Marquis Gu went down the mountain, he always felt something was wrong. But he remembered that he had never come back to see Gu Jiao for a while. Until they came back to the villa and took out Gu Jiao's portrait, Yao's mind was buzzing.\"Marquis.\" She looked at the birthmark on her daughter's face.\"What's the matter?\" Marquis Gu came to see with her, but he didn't see anything.Yao said anxiously, \"the abbot said that the birthmark on Jiaojiao's face is shougongsha, but Jiaojiao is married. Why... Don't they have different feelings?\"Yao's family is really complaining about Gu's family now: \"I married Jiao Jiao so early. If I were in Hou's house, I would stay with her for a few more years.\"Women in the state of Zhao usually choose their relatives only after they reach the hairpin.Marquis Gu didn't worry about Yao. After all, he didn't intend to admit the marriage from the beginning.A poor scholar is not worthy of his daughter! Back to the point of silver to send the poor boy, and so on to the capital, who knows that girl married? At that time, just find her a good son!Although the girl's character and appearance are far different from Jinyu's, she is the Marquis's daughter in the end, so she can't get married.--On the other hand, Xiao LIULANG, who didn't know that he was going to be sent away by his father-in-law with a sum of money, just left school and was about to pick up Xiao Jingkong at a nearby elementary school.But just a few steps away, he was stopped by a carriage.This is not an ordinary carriage. The wheels are different from those seen on the street. They are bigger, higher and stronger. The car body is made of top-grade yellow pear wood. The silk on the canopy is brilliant. There are also eight huge night pearls inlaid, each of which is worth 100 gold.The coachman is a man in black wearing a hat, with strong arms, tall body and strong bearing.The horse is also very powerful. It's a dark Mongolian horse. It imitates the Buddhist calendar and passes through the battlefield. It's so fierce that none of the nearby drivers dare to get close to it.A man with refined temperament came down from the carriage. He was about the same age as the second owner of huichuntang, but his momentum was far beyond ordinary people's comparison.From time to time, people look this way.But the man seemed to be indifferent. He came to Xiao LIULANG and looked at him carefully. With a smile on his face, he said, \"are you Xiao LIULANG?\"Xiao LIULANG eyes Alert: \"who are you?\"The man raised his hand with a gentle smile: \"don't be afraid. My name is Liu. My master asked me to come to you.\"After that, he took off a token from his waist and said to Xiao LIULANG, \"do you know this token?\"--Private school.When the children in the elementary school class finished school, the teacher and the students were all relieved. The students came out of the classroom with their bags on their faces and ran as fast as a thief, as if some fierce beast was chasing them behind them.But the master couldn't go because of the small clearance.Master took his 108th deep breath today.If his son had not been a student of Tianxiang academy, he would have dropped this annoying little fellow out of school a hundred times!Although Xiao Jingkong always brags at home, he is actually very quiet in class, but if he doesn't sing, he will die!His brother-in-law is the direct disciple of President Li's unilateral announcement. Driving him away is equivalent to President Li wearing shoes for his son.But looking at him, master's eyes hurtXiaojingkong is holding the three character Scripture in both hands. He is chanting the Scripture on the surface, but he glances out from time to time.\"Clearance, hasn't your brother-in-law come yet?\" Asked the teacher in the lecture.\"Well.\" The little clearance answered in a low voice.The master said, 'shall I take you to the door?\"Xiaojingkong snorted: \"does he like to come! I don't want to look at himHaving said that, the number of times he glanced out with his small eyes obviously increased.The bad brother-in-law doesn't want him, does he?It's the same as the families that once agreed to adopt him but eventually abandoned him.\"Clearance.\" The master didn't know when he came to him and patted him on the shoulder. \"Your brother-in-law is here.\"Finally! Finally! The nightmare of one day as a teacher is over!\"Really?\" Xiao Jingkong stood up and quickly realized that he was overreacting. He quickly adjusted himself and put on a calm expression. He packed up his things and said goodbye to his master. He went to see Xiao LIULANG outside the private school.\"You are late today!\"After getting on the bullock cart, Xiao Jingkong said to Xiao LIULANG discontentedly, \"are you not studying hard, and you have been detained by Master Zhang?\"Xiao LIULANG glanced at him unexpectedly: \"do you still know my master's surname Zhang?\"\"Brother Xiaoshun said it Xiao Jingkong said, I know a lot. I not only know that your master is Zhang, but also know that Gu Dashun's master's surname is Chen and your Dean's surname is Li!Xiaojingkong said seriously, \"you haven't answered my question. Have you been detained by the master? Don't be arrogant and complacent when you are a scholar. Don't forget that you are still a student of class B! \"Well, even he knows class B.Xiao LIULANG looked at him angrily and laughingly: \"where do children talk so much?\"Xiaojingkong forked: \"it's clear that you are late, and I'm not allowed to say that you adults are unreasonable!\"Xiao LIULANG said, \"you mean you are very reasonable?\"Xiaojingkong held his arms: \"of course, I'm reasonable!\"Xiao LIULANG raised his eyebrows and said, \"who was that to talk back to the master in class and embarrass him?\"Small clearance said rigorously: \"that's what he said wrong! I'm correcting him! \"Xiao LIULANG said: \"who played truant in the middle of class?\"Xiaojingkong said solemnly, \"that's what he wants to hit me! I didn't do anything wrong! He will not punish children who are not wrong! \"Master has a ruler, and disobedient children have to beat twice in the palm of their hands. Xiaojingkong questioned the master in the court and fought with him. The master was angry, so he took the ruler to punish him. As a result, he fell down and ran away from the private school with his book bag on his back!Xiao LIULANG said quietly: 'since you think you are reasonable, let's take these things to Jiaojiao and let her judge.\"Little headroom didn't speak.Although he firmly believed that he was the Party of justice, he instinctively felt that Jiao Jiao would not agree with him.Xiao LIULANG said: \"why don't you say anything? Are you afraid that you can't stand the truth, or are you afraid that Jiao Jiao is unreasonable? \"Xiaojingkong said boldly: \"Jiaojiao is of course reasonable! I'm right, too! It's just that Jiao Jiao and I are not convinced. It's a matter of reason, not me and Jiao Jiao! \"Xiao LIULANG: I don't know you very well. I almost feel dizzy by you.Two people pinch pinch pinch to the village.They got out of the ox cart and walked towards their home. As soon as they entered the door, they found that there was one more person in the family.This man is clean and good-looking. At first sight, he is not a villager in the village.\"Who are you?\" Asked little headroom askew.\"I'm Jiao Jiao's brother.\" Gu Yan stressed, \"my brother.\"The small body of small clearance is in a flash!Thousands of calculations have missed Jiao Jiao and her brother. Isn't that higher than Gu Xiaoshun's ranking?A strong sense of crisis rose from the bottom of my heart!Xiao LIULANG did not think it was too big to watch the excitement. He laughed at the little monk's head and said, \"ah, who is Jiaojiao's favorite brother?\"Xiaojingkong takes away the evil brother-in-law's claws decisively.He told himself secretly, don't panic, don't panic, even if his brother? He came first! Besides, he has his own advantages, doesn't he?First of all, he's small, he's cute, he's cute!Just at this time, Xue Ningxiang sent a few baked sweet potatoes, she also found the beautiful little boy at home.Compared with the former self, Xue Ningxiang was calm at this time.After all, this family is very strange. If a marquis's daughter comes out, she will not be surprised even if another empress dowager comes out.Gu Yan looked at her for a moment and said to her, \"you are sister Xue next door. My sister mentioned you. I am Gu Yan, Jiao Jiao's brother.\"His voice is as clean as his temperament, his tone is too soft, his smile is charming, and there is a trace of youth's unique innocence and innocence.Xue Ningxiang was killed by Meng.Xiaojingkong's fists beat his chest angrily: ah, it's cute even when they are so big, and it's better than selling themselves! Shame!!!The dark guards on the roof didn't see it. Is it so shameless? What is it like in Hou Fu? Don't you count in your heart? Can you be green tea with green paint?Xiaojingkong is holding a breath, even the dinner is not fragrant.After the bath, small clearance suddenly thought of a great advantage.He is a monk. He can recite scriptures!He's going to recite scriptures to Jiao Jiao!Master has said that he is the best little monk in the world who can recite sutras. Jiaojiao will like to hear him recite sutras!Xiaojingkong pulls out his own wooden fish from the small cage, takes the wooden fish, hangs the Buddha beads, and bravely goes to find Gu Jiao!But as soon as he arrived in the backyard, he heard a melodious sound of the flute. The sound of the flute was like crying, and even the little clear space who didn't understand the music could hear a faint sadness.Small clearance covers the mouth.When the song was finished, xiaojingkong burst into tears.Wuwuwu, this is the best song in the world! It's better than a monk chanting sutras a hundred times, a thousand times!The flute was played by Gu Yan. In the second round, Xiao Jingkong lost again!But xiaojingkong still does not give up. He has the last mace, that is, he, Hui, Yang, Xiao and Ji!He is a super small clearance that can raise seven chickens! He doesn't believe that Gu Yan can be more powerful than him!\"Young master, your dog has come to you.\" Dark Wei Yi handed the little suckling dog from the villa to Gu Yan's arms, then Shua's flash was gone!Gu Yan and Gu Jiao play in the backyard.Xiaojingkong lives in the mountains all the year round. There are no dogs in the mountains. He came to the village only to see a few of them, but they are all fierce rhubarb dogs, unlike the little suckling dog who is soft and cute.\"WoofSmall clearance a stagger, it will also call!Gu Jiao threw a small bone into the vegetable garden.Wheezing, the little suckling dog ran over and took the little bone and put it in front of Gu Jiao.Xiaojingkong thinks it's very difficult to raise chickens. He didn't expect that Gu Yan would raise dogs!How did he manage such a difficult task?The logic of small clearance - all things, small is easy to raise, big is not easy to raise. For example, it's easier to support yourself, just to have enough to eat, but it's not easy for my brother-in-law to support him. I worry about his examination day by day, and I worry about his walking.Xiaojingkong is finally incarnated as a little salted fish, stranded on Westinghouse's bed without soul.\"I'm too hard...\"When Xiao LIULANG returned to Westinghouse after cleaning up the firewood room, Xiao Jingkong was already snoring.Xiao LIULANG covers his quilt and takes back his wooden fish, beads and sutras one by one. After that, he went to the main room.Gu Jiao also just entered the hall room, saw him and asked softly: \"did you sleep?\"Xiao LIULANG nodded and lowered his voice: 'sleep, where's Gu Yan?\"Gu Jiao way: \"also slept.\"They sat on the chair and breathed a sigh of relief at the same time.It's like a couple of parents asking, \"is Xiao Bao asleep?\"\u201c Sleeping, where's Dabao? \"\u201c Dabao is asleep, too. \"Then parents can finally start to do their own things.Gu Jiao said to him, \"go for rehabilitation.\"A cobblestone path was built in the backyard for his rehabilitation. Even if she knew that he was suffering from heart knot, she could not give up any efforts.Xiao LIULANG said to himself, \"I can't leave even after training.\"Gu Jiao pointed to his legs, seriously said: \"at least the muscles will not degenerate, one day you want to go, they can support your dream at any time, take you anywhere.\"Xiao LIULANG's heart was touched.But the next second, he laughed at himself again.Dream?He has no dreams.But her sentence \"if you want to leave\" sounds ordinary, and the delicacy seems to have another meaning.Does she mean \"he walks\" or \"he walks away\"?Xiao LIULANG looked at her with a faint look in his eyes.Gu Jiao didn't explain any more. She bent her lips and said, \"let's go.\"She took his crutch and helped him to the backyard.Late at night, the whole village fell into a deep sleep.The moon was quiet. She took his arm and walked step by step on the cobblestone path in the backyard.The road looked very long, but it came to an end accidentally. I don't know whether it would be the same between him and her.The next day, Xiao LIULANG got up early and went to the Academy. Today, Xiao Jingkong's private school is on holiday. Gu Jiao sent him to the ox cart.It's still early, so it's hard to find a little space to go to school. Gu Jiao thought he would go to bed early, but he woke up as soon as Xiao LIULANG left.He first went to the backyard to take a horse step, and then practiced his stirrups. He split his feet and raised them over his head. He also asked Gu Jiao to put a bowl of water on his feet.The little monk is serious and lovely in practicing.After he had finished practicing, Gu Jiao just finished cleaning up the kitchen and was going to pick some mushrooms on the mountain.It's rare that Gu Yan is still sleeping, and the little monk can monopolize Jiao Jiao. Naturally, he will not miss this opportunity and propose to go up the mountain with Jiao Jiao!Gu Jiao agreed.As soon as they opened the door, they saw a carriage parked at their door.A kind-looking young man came down from the carriage, arched his hand to Gu Jiao, and said with a smile, \"is this Xiao LIULANG's home?\"\"Who are you?\" Gu Jiao asked.The young man said with a kind face: \"are you lady Xiao? I'm in charge of my family. Let me invite Mrs. Xiao to the town for a talk. \"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
